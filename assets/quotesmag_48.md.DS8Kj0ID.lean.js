A co-production between Canadian and French companies, the film follows a poor orphan girl who dreams of becoming a ballerina and gets a chance to audition for the celebrated school of the Paris Opera Ballet. Ballerina stars the voices of Elle Fanning, Dane DeHaan, Maddie Ziegler and Carly Rae Jepsen. The film was released in cinemas in France and the United Kingdom on 12 December 2016, followed by releases in various countries over the following several months, including Canada on 24 February 2017. The film was released in the United States on 25 August 2017, with the voices of Nat Wolff (who replaced DeHaan), Kate McKinnon and Mel Brooks added. Plot In the 1880s, eleven-year-old Félicie (Elle Fanning), a poor orphan girl who dreams of becoming a ballerina, but lacks formal training, runs away from her orphanage in rural Brittany with her best friend, Victor (Dane DeHaan), a young inventor. Together they go to Paris, but they soon become separated, and Victor becomes an office boy in Gustave Eiffel's workshop. Félicie finds her way to the Paris Opera, where the guard catches her trespassing. She is rescued by a mysterious cleaner with a limp, Odette (Carly Rae Jepsen), who agrees to let Félicie stay with her until she gets on her feet. Odette works for both the Opera and for the cruel and imperious Régine Le Haut (Julie Khaner), a wealthy restaurant owner. While helping Odette clean, Félicie spies Regine's daughter, Camille (Maddie Ziegler), practicing ballet. Camille sees Félicie, insults her, and throws Félicie's treasured music box out of the window, breaking it. As Félicie takes it to Victor for repair, she intercepts the postman who brings a letter from the Opera admitting Camille to the celebrated school of the Paris Opera Ballet partly because of her mother's connection. In her anger, Félicie hides the letter and decides to assume Camille's identity to get into the school and pursue her dream. Odette agrees to mentor Félicie, who later learns that Odette was a former prima ballerina. Félicie finds her training very difficult, but with Camille's letter of acceptance, she manages to take her place at the ballet school. Mérante (Terrence Scammell), the school's exacting choreographer, announces that one of the girls from the class will be chosen to dance the role of Clara in The Nutcracker. He dismisses the worst dancer in class each day. Félicie improves each day and narrowly avoids elimination, but a couple of days before the final elimination, her lie is discovered. Mérante decides to admit Camille into the class, while also letting Félicie stay; although Félicie's infraction was serious, Mérante accidentally saw her dance passionately in a bar that she and Victor visited. The night before the final elimination, Félicie neglects training to go out on a date with Rudi, a handsome boy from the school, which disappoints Odette. Victor sees Félicie with Rudi and becomes jealous; he and Félicie argue. The next day, Félicie is late to the audition and unable to perform well, and so the part of Clara goes to Camille. Regine sends Félicie back to her orphanage, where she loses her spirit. She has a dream about being an infant in the arms of her late mother, a ballerina, who gave her the music box. She decides to return to Paris to help Odette and apologize to Victor. While cleaning the stage, Félicie encounters Camille, and they engage in a dance battle that is witnessed by all the students, Odette and Mérante. Félicie does a grand jeté over a flight of stairs, while Camille cannot. Mérante approaches the two girls and asks them why they dance, to which Camille admits that she dances only because her mother tells her to, while Félicie speaks stirringly of dance as her inheritance and passion. Camille admits that Félicie should dance Clara. Near Eiffel's workshop, where the Statue of Liberty is being constructed, Félicie invites Victor to the performance. A furiously deranged Régine arrives, chases Félicie up to the crown of the statue and forces her off, but Victor saves her with aid from Camille. They arrive at the Opera just in time for Félicie to don Odette's special pointe shoes; Félicie kisses Victor on the cheek, and she performs in The Nutcracker alongside the principal ballerina.

The bout took place in Puerto Rico at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum and was televised in the United States live on CBS in front of 40 million viewers. The Fight In the ring during the introduction, Coopman smiled easily while Ali stared at him. In his orange robe with a small black lion over the left breast, Coopman sat on the stool in his corner and appeared to enjoy Ali's attempted psych.

In the first round, he coughed twice midway through the round, then coughed up his mouthpiece near the end of the round. Ali was recovering from a recent battle with the flu. Through four rounds, Ali was fighting in a flatfoot stance, peppering Coopman with flurries of punches. In the fifth, the champion started to dance, circling to his left, then to his right, and confusing Coopman with backhand jabs. Then Ali threw a big uppercut. With a combination of punches, culminated by a right uppercut, the 29-year-old challenger toppled into the ropes. Trying to regain his equilibrium, Coopman wobbled back into the canvas in an apparent delayed reaction from the punch. Coopman was counted out by referee Ismael Quinones- Falu at 2 minutes 46 seconds.

No. 16 = Soviet period = In 1918, the Eparchy School was closed, the same year the Tatar teacher's seminary was opened here. Later, by the decision of the People's Commissariat, Yelabuga Tatar teachers' seminary was transformed into a three-year teacher training courses for the representatives of different national and ethnic groups. Since that time the Russian as well as Mari, Udmurt and Tatar pedagogical courses functioned there. In August 1923 the Board of Tatar pedagogical courses renamed them into Yelabuga Tatar Pedagogical College. The structure of it constantly expanded and in 1930 it became the Russian-Tatar Pedagogical College (Tekhnicum) Simultaneously primary school teachers were trained in the college where in 1931–1932 correspondence department was opened.

It was built to combat the rum-running trade.  History  It was built in 1927 in Camden, New Jersey, by the American Brown Boveri Corp. It was commissioned in mid- or late 1927, with Boatswain's Mate J. S. Turner in charge. Travis operated out of Stapleton, N.Y., Morehead City, N.C., and Rockland, Maine, successively, through the 1930s. The latter port served as her home base from 1937 to the summer of 1941, when the Coast Guard was placed under naval control for the duration of World War II. Apparently shifted to Argentia, Newfoundland, in either late 1941 or early 1942 to support the Atlantic Fleet in the Battle of the Atlantic, Travis—designated WPC—153—picked up a sound contact at 1100 on 8 February 1942 while patrolling off Placentia Bay. She dropped a depth charge which temporarily disabled her sound gear. Once the cutter regained the contact, she dropped another pair of charges. Although they noted an oil slick, no definite confirmation of a \\"kill\\" was made. Travis apparently remained in these northern climes into the winter of 1942. On 20 December, she came across the disabled freighter Maltran which was in danger of running aground on a poorly charted rocky shore. The cutter attempted to tow off the ship, but the hawser parted. Meanwhile, happened by and, at the request of Travis, rendered assistance. The second cutter relieved the first in the towing operation and succeeded in taking Maltran in tow at 0315 on 21 December, while Travis operated as an antisubmarine screen. Eventually, the little group successfully navigated the dangerous uncharted waters and emerged to make passage to the swept channel at Argentia. Travis was decommissioned and sold soon thereafter.

Permaculture is transforming communities in Ghana through education, food production, outreach, skills development, self-sufficiency, and creating small business enterprises. Background At the age of 22 Paul Yeboah was concerned with rural and urban poverty. He received an Agricultural Certificate from the Farm Institute in Ghana. He initiated a rural and urban fruit forest project by using seed supplies from the Kade Oil Palm Research Institute and Bonsu Cocoa Research Station. The seeds and seedlings were given to the farmers on a credit basis. This project was instrumental in the creation of rural processing businesses and employment for the poor. In 2003 Paul Yeboah was the farm manager for the Abbott of Kristo Buase Benedictine Monastery in Ghana. Greg Knibbs was invited to come to the Monastery to assist in the redesigning of the farm using Permaculture practices to restore the soil to fertility. The soil was depleted from the use of synthetic chemical pollution. Yeboah met Greg Knibbs and they worked together to form the Ghana Permaculture Network which later became the Ghana Permaculture Institute. Career The Ghana Permaculture Network was coordinated by Paul Yeboah in 2003. The GPN started out as a small farm demonstration training site that later grew into the Ghana Permaculture Institute (GPI). In 2007 the Ghana Permaculture Nwodua Tree Nursery was created. It was created to build community income, and to deal with environmental issues such as desertification and erosion. It also does reforestation. The work is collaborative community effort involving women, youth, and men. All members of the community are a part of the profits and benefits of working towards enhancing their environment. The project builds environmental awareness. Paul Yeboah is the Vice Chairman of the Ghana Ecovillage Network which was founded in 2012, and incorporated in 2013. It was formed by community leaders and groups with sustainable projects to promote Ecovillage strategies as models for sustainable development in Ghana. The Ghana Permaculture Network started out supporting local schools, community farmers in establishing tree nurseries, and tree planting projects. The Ghana Permaculture Network has now expanded in various parts of Ghana, into Togo, and Burkina Faso in West Africa. A photograph of Tree Nursery in Techiman, Ghana. Permaculture Institute Projects (Educational Programs) The goal of the educational initiatives and projects is to promote lifelong learning with emphases on vocational training, and the need of viable skill development using practices of sustainable development. * Permaculture Design Courses are taught in Ghana, Togo and Burkina Faso, West Africa. * Ghana Permaculture Nwodua Tree Nursery Project - Ghana is a deforested country. The Tree Nursery Project addresses issues of deforestation in order to reverse erosion. It teaches and advocates the importance of trees and climate change issues. * Oyster mushroom production - Using sawdust in bags the Permaculture Institute teaches how to grow mushrooms. This project allows participants to learn how to make a waste product sawdust useful. Which promotes healthy diet, nutrition and skill development. * Demonstration Training sites for how-to build Permaculture home gardens * Moringa Production - Which helps to facilitate the development of small-businesses to generate income. A project that promotes healthy nutrition and skills development. * Ecovillage Design Course - Which teaches and acquaints students with tools that can be utilized to redevelop their communities in ecological economically, culturally and socially ways to foster sustainability.

Roosevelt to design the Oval Office.Eric Gugler, from Archives of American Art. Biography Gugler was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of printer and engraver Julius Gugler and his wife Bertha Bremer. He studied at the Armour Institute in Chicago, Illinois, and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He graduated from Columbia University in 1911, and was awarded the 1911 McKim Fellowship in Architecture. He studied at the American Academy in Rome, 1911–1914.Directory: Fellows – Affiliated Fellows – Residents, 1910–1920, from American Academy in Rome. He returned to the United States, and worked in the offices of McKim, Mead & White.Eric Gugler, from Philadelphia Architects and Buildings.

Gugler altered a rowhouse at 319 East 72nd Street, Manhattan into Manship's residence and studio in 1925.Christopher Gray, \\"Streetscapes: Rockefeller Center\\", The New York Times, February 28, 1999. Gugler later bought a 5-foot (1.52 m) diameter glass sphere etched with the constellations. He lent this to Manship, who created multiple sculptures inspired by it.Sotheby's, \\"Celestial Sphere\\", American Paintings, 29 November 2006, Lot 22. For what became the Aero Memorial (plaster 1933), Manship modeled Zodiac figures in clay directly atop the glass sphere, then cast them in plaster and bronze.Harry Rand, Paul Manship (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, 1989), pp. 124–27. In projects together and separately, Gugler and Manship repeatedly returned to the idea of spheres, heavenly bodies and signs of the Zodiac.

Roosevelt's Warm Springs Institute in Warm Springs, Georgia. =The White House= West Wing under construction, 1934. Location of the Oval Office in the West Wing. Dissatisfied with the size and layout of the West Wing, President Franklin D. Roosevelt engaged Gugler to redesign it in 1933. To create additional space without increasing the apparent size of the building, he excavated a full basement, added a set of subterranean offices under the adjacent lawn, and built an unobtrusive \\"penthouse\\" story. The directive to wring the most office space out of the existing building was responsible for its narrow corridors and cramped staff offices. His most visible addition was the expansion of the building eastward for a new Cabinet Room and Oval Office.William Seale, The President's House (White House Historical Association and the National Geographic Society, 1986), pp. 946–49. Gugler served as consulting architect to the White House, 1934–48. He designed the Honduras mahogany case for the Steinway & Sons grand piano (1938) – serial number 300,000 – in the East Room. Albert Stewart modeled the large gilded eagles that are its legs. Dunbar Beck painted its gold-leaf mural that depicts five scenes of indigenous American music—a New England barn dance, a cowboy with guitar, a Virginia reel, a pair of black field hands singing, and Native American ceremonial dancers.Steinway Grand Piano, from White House Historical Association. For the State Dining Room mantel, in 1945 Gugler designed the inscription of John Adams's 1800 benediction for the White House:State Dining Room, from White House Historical Association. > I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House and all that > shall hereafter inhabit it.

He contributed to the restoration of The Grange, Alexander Hamilton's house in Manhattan; The Octagon House in Washington, D.C.; and other historic buildings. He served as chairman of the Joint Advisory Committee on Planning and Development of the United Nations Headquarters, 1946–1948.Joint Advisory Committee on Planning and Development of the United Nations Headquarters Records, from Columbia University. In the 1940s and 1950s, Gugler expanded the campus of Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, designing Waugh Hall, Campus Center (now Sparks Center), Wolcott and Morris Dormitories, Lilly Library, and Baxter Hall.\\"Eric Gugler to Design Wabash College Units,\\" The Indianapolis Star, December 17, 1944, p. 16. He collaborated with sculptors James Earle Fraser and Donald De Lue on the Harvey S. Firestone Memorial (1950), in Akron, Ohio. He designed the setting for Fraser's Mayo Memorial (1952), in Rochester, Minnesota. With sculptor Paul Manship and landscape architect Ralph E. Griswold, Gugler designed the Sicily–Rome American Cemetery and Memorial (1956), in Nettuno, Lazio, Italy, where more than 7,800 U.S. soldiers from World War II are buried. Gugler's chapel ceiling mural depicts the positions of the stars and planets on January 22, 1944, at the hour when the Battle of Anzio commenced.The Chapel, from Sicily-Rome American Cemetery. Manship and Gugler were awarded the National Sculpture Society's Henry Hering Medal, for noteworthy collaboration between sculptor and architect. Gugler collaborated with Manship on an ornate armillary sphere for the 1964 New York World's Fair. They also collaborated on the FDR Memorial Block (1965), outside the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C.; and the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial (1967), on Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac River, opposite the national capital. Hall of Our History Gugler spent decades working on a project he called The Hall of Our History. Conceived in 1938 as a national monument that would illustrate American history through sculpture, it was intended for a site at Pine Mountain, Georgia, near Franklin D. Roosevelt's Little White House.Art: History in Granite, Time Magazine, August 17, 1953. World War II put the idea on hold, but it was revived post-war as a shrine to the late president.Michael Kammen, Mystic Chords of Memory: The Transformation of Tradition in American Culture (Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2011), pp. 564–65. Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt supported and helped to publicize the Georgia project.Eleanor Roosevelt, My Day, August 15, 1953, The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers. A corporation was organized to shepherd it through to completion, but the estimated $25,000,000 cost and obscure location made fund-raising difficult, and the corporation was dissolved in 1954.Hall of Our History Project Papers, from Emory University. The project was resurrected in 1957, proposed for one of the most prominent locations in the United States: Arlington Ridge Park, on the west side of the Potomac River, between Arlington National Cemetery and the Marine Corps War Memorial.

He died in the offensive campaign of Kangra from bullet injury. He was the owner of the Thapathali Durbar temple complex. Family Tree He was born as second son to Sanukaji Amar Singh Thapa. Nayan Singh Thapa had 4 brothers - Bhimsen Thapa, Bhaktawar Singh, Amrit Singh and Ranbir Singh and two step-brothers - Ranzawar and Ranbam. He was father of Mathabarsingh Thapa, Queen Tripurasundari of Nepal and grandfather of Jung Bahadur Rana. He was the son-in-law of Chief Kazi Ranajit Pande of noble Pande family and father-in-law of Kazi Bal Narsingh Kunwar of the noble Kunwar Rana family. Kumar Pradhan asserts that Sher Jung Thapa was son of Nain Singh Thapa, whom Bhimsen adopted while Baburam Acharya contradicts that Sher Jung Thapa was nephew of Mathabarsingh Thapa and was sixteen years old on April 1835. *Ganesh Kumari is mother of Jung Bahadur Rana, founder of Rana dynasty. Life as military officer Poem, and portrait of the event of the death of Kaji Nain Singh Thapa in the conquest of Garhwal, by Garhwali Poet Mola Ram He was a Kaji and General of Nepal Army. A royal order was decreed on Ashwin Sudi 2, 1862 V.S. (September 1805), for the preparations of Kangra campaign. In September 1805, while being deputed at Kangra Fort, his brother Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa ordered him to arrest military deserters. Gorkhali forces under Badakaji Amar Singh Thapa, Rudrabir [Shah] and Nain Singh overran Nalagarh and crossed Sutlej river. They fought battle against King Sansar Chand at Mahal Mori in May 1806 and defeated him there. Sansar Chand fled to Kangra fort after taking refuge at Sujanpur Tira. Widow of Kirti Chand, Commander of Kangra Army and Nain Singh, the Nepalese commander led the battle at Tira Sujanpur. The Gorkhali invasion became persistent and irresistible. On Saturday V.S. 1863 Kartik Badi 13 (i.e. 8 November 1806), there was a letter which positioned Bhakti Thapa under the joint authority of Badakaji Amar Singh Thapa and Nain Singh. Kaji Nain Singh came with a reinforcement of 1500 men along with Sardar Udatta Shahi leading 3 companies while Subba Ranganath Gurung and Prahlad Gurung had led 4 companies. Nain Singh and Amar Singh were entrusted with the main Nain Singh fought at Kangra fort and was mortally wounded from which he died in the winter of 1806/1807. The Bhasavamshawali also states the death of Nain Singh on 1728 Saka Era i.e. (1806/7) A.D. The event was sketched by 19th-century Garhwali poet and painter Mola Ram. In the 1852 interview, Jang Bahadur Rana mentioned the death of his maternal grandfather Nain Singh at Kangra. He was the owner of Thapathali Durbar.

Minnesota was won by the Republican candidate, Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover won the state over New York governor Al Smith by a margin of 164,526 votes, or 16.94%. Nationally, Hoover won the election, with 444 electoral votes and a landslide 17.41% lead over Smith in the popular vote. This would be the final time a Republican would win Minnesota in a presidential election until Dwight D. Eisenhower won it in 1952. This was also the last presidential election held in Minnesota before the elimination of the 10th congressional district, and hence the last presidential election in which Minnesota had 12 electoral votes. , this is the last election in which Carlton County and St. Louis County voted for a Republican presidential candidate.Sullivan, Robert David; ‘How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century’; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Results { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 95%;\\" - style=\\"background-color:#E9E9E9\\" ! colspan=\\"6\\"  1928 United States presidential election in Minnesota -bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\" align=\\"center\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width: 15em\\" Party ! style=\\"width: 17em\\" Candidate ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Votes ! style=\\"width: 7em\\" Percentage ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Electoral votes - ! style=\\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\\"   style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Republican  Herbert Hoover  align=\\"right\\"  560,977  align=\\"right\\"  57.77%  align=\\"right\\"  12 - ! style=\\"background- color:#3333FF; width: 3px\\"   style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Democratic  Al Smith  align=\\"right\\"  396,451  align=\\"right\\"  40.83%  align=\\"right\\"  0 - ! style=\\"background-color:#8D342E; width: 3px\\"   style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Socialist  Norman Thomas  align=\\"right\\"  6,774  align=\\"right\\"  0.70%  align=\\"right\\"  0 - ! style=\\"background-color:#CD3700; width: 3px\\"   style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Workers (Communist)  William Z.

He was born in Richmond, Virginia and moved to Ohio as a young man. In Ohio he was a part of abolitionist and Underground Railroad societies and became a Baptist preacher. From the pulpit, he preached against slavery and for African-American rights. After the American Civil War (1861–1865), he was involved in political activities in Columbus, serving on the City Council, the city Board of Education, the state Forestry Bureau, and as trustee of the Institute for the Blind and of Wilberforce University. At his death, he was noted as the second longest serving advocate for African American rights after Booker T. Washington.

His mother died when he was four years old. As a child, he attended school, and at the age ten, he was apprenticed to the barber's business. He worked in an aristocratic shop, and Poindexter became acquainted with many Richmond leaders. He later moved to Ohio, settling in Columbus at the age of twelve. In Ohio, he continued to attend school, now privately, and to work as a barber, which again afforded him a variety of useful contacts.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner.

He frequently preached against slavery,working against the trend of many preachers failing to respond to claims that the Bible sanctioned slavery. In about 1857 he became president of the society called, \\"sons of protection\\", a position he held for 30 years, a secretive African-American civil rights group associated with the Underground Railroad.

He acted as an aide of his brother Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa and was appointed the commander of Samar Jung Company. He commanded the Bijayapur-Sindhuli Gadhi Axis in the first campaign of Anglo- Nepalese War and Makwanpur Gadhi Axis in the second campaign. Later, he became the governor of Palpa and died in the office. Early Life Bakhtawar Singh Thapa was born to military officer Kaji Amar Singh Thapa (sanu) and Satyarupa Maya. He was the brother of Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa and had other three brothers - Nain Singh Thapa, Amrit Singh Thapa, and Ranabir Singh Thapa. From his step-mother, he had two brothers—Ranbam and Ranzawar. His ancestors were members of Bagale Thapa clan from Jumla who migrated eastwards. His grandfather was Bir Bhadra Thapa, a courtier in Prithvi Narayan Shah's army. Career =Commander of the Palace= After the Bhandarkhal Massacre of 1806, the Samar Jung Company was selected as royal palace guard by Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa. Bakhtawar Singh was appointed as the commander of the Company to be camped inside the palace for the protection of King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah and Queen Tripurasundari of Nepal. In the maturity of King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah and Queen Tripurasundari of Nepal, Kaji Bakhtawar slowly gained confidence out of both from his role of their protector. The death of King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah and his two queens in 1816 had caused his hopes to be destroyed. After the end of Anglo-Nepalese war, Kaji Bakhtawar was suspected by his brother Bhimsen Thapa to have joined the enemy factions. At the time, he was living in the same family with his brother without the division of their ancestral property. Bhimsen slowly brought Kaji Bakhtawar under his control but their mother pleaded only a light punishment for Bakhtawar. He was dismissed from his position and was imprisoned in the Nuwakot prison and the Bakhtawar's Samar Jung Company was heavily disfavored by the Mukhtiyar. =Anglo-Nepalese War= Bakhtawar was the commander of Bijaypur-Sindhuli Gadhi axis during the first campaign of the Anglo-Nepalese war. He was stationing the fort and the region by 2000 soldiers. In the second campaign, he was commanding his headquarter at Makwanpur Gadhi. He sent the final ratified document of Sugali Treaty to British India Company after the Hitaura camp of Major General David Ochterlony on 4 March 1816. =Governor of Palpa= A letter dated March 1824 to his brother Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa shows Bakhtawar Singh as the governor of Palpa. Members of the Thapa dynasty were appointed as the governor of Palpa because it controlled over 4 battalions of the Nepalese Army. Bakhtawar Singh died in his office of Chief Administrator of Palpa in 1832 A.D. Family =Son= His son Trivikram Singh Thapa became Acting Chief Administrator of Palpa in 1832 A.D. on death of his father. However, Bhimsen Thapa did not trust Trivikram Singh and instead appointed his brother Ranabir Singh Thapa as Chief Administrator of Palpa in March 1833. Trivikram Singh was affectionately referred as Kaji Mama (\\"Kaji Uncle\\") by the Shamsher Ranas. After the Kot Massacre, he occupied the Lazimpat Durbar for 28 years until he left for Varanasi in 1875. =Wife= The widow of Bakhtawar Singh on 1839 presented evidences against the former Mukhtiyar and her brother-in-law Bhimsen Thapa claiming the former Mukhtiyar responsible for poisoning of King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah, whom it was widely known to have died from smallpox.

It is primarily centered on a song and dance performance that takes place during the day and night. Sengenya is typified by the actual participation of the audience who are invited to do so when requested. During its formative stage sengenya was characterised by four movements, and this has now descended to two movements. This was the result of two different rhythms generated from six drums. The corollary of this is the introduction of two new dance genres – i.e. goma and zandale – these were part of the original sengenya dance genre. The word goma refers to one of the newly created dance movements and is a Duruma word denoting either drums or dance. The dance movement itself is referred to as duume bull. This is because of the vigorous nature and style of the dance movement. When goma was formed, it was supposed to be performed during nyeresa mwezi (the Giriama), lusinga (the Chonyi), hangaifu (the Duruma) and matanga ya pili (the Waswahili). The essence of Goma dance is the expression of passing food and music to those who have died. This enables them to join their ancestors who died earlier before they are entirely forgotten. Goma dance indeed, can be performed in the absence of any funerals, but purely as a homage to their ancestors. On the other hand the genre of Zandale dance, is performed by the Duruma, Giriama and the Digo tribes. An instrument called the Chivoti is played at the outset before the dance commences. Goma dance is meant to give food and music to the dead on their way to join the earlier departed ancestors before they are completely forgotten. Goma dance can also be performed with no specific funeral at hand, but rather, as a heritage to honor the ancestors. Zandale dance, another new creation are performed by the Duruma, Giriama and the Digo. Chivoti is played as a prelude before dance is started. The chivoti instrument is played early in the morning by the Vijana (the youth) to alert members of the community of the onset of dawn (mabarubaru or mahoho alume). This can also be denoted that the young boys were ready to take cattle to the grazing fields as they have finished milking the cows. This signified that the boys were proud to undertake their tasks regardless of the physical and mental attribute of their male adult counterparts – especially if they were tired. After the introduction by chivoti (designed to alert the people), nzumari (a powerful musical medium designed to send messages) prevails in order to invite people, in particular, members of the dance troupe, to come and greet the audience. Soon after the whole ensemble glides in to denote the gentle commencement of the dance which picks up pace as the performance progresses and finally becomes more intense and moving. Although sengenya dance genre is typically performed during wedding and funeral occasions, some of its movements such as mserego are typically only performed at wedding ceremonies.

Biography Holbech was born on board the Maria Constantia, en route from Calcutta to Copenhagen. His father was a sailing master whose family often travelled with him. During the Gunboat War, the ship they were on was seized by the British and they spent two years as prisoners of war.Kirsten Nannestad. N. P. Holbech biographical notes Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbach Kunstnerleksikon At the age of fifteen, he entered the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and, in 1824, became a student at the Academy's Model School (Modelskolen). His primary instructors were Christian August Lorentzen and Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg. Later in 1824, however, he broke off his studies to become private secretary to British Ambassador, Sir Augustus Foster (1780–1848), with whom the family had become acquainted during their captivity. After a brief stay in London, he accompanied Foster to Turin, following Foster's appointment as Ambassador to the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1830, he left to go to Rome and resume his career as a painter. He applied to the Royal Academy for financial support but, despite a recommendation from Bertel Thorvaldsen, did not receive any. In 1834, he returned to Copenhagen and was able to start a drawing school. It was short-lived, however, as he gave it up when he found sufficient work painting portraits. He rarely exhibited. In addition to portraits, he created a few historical scenes that were purchased for the Royal Collection. In 1888, he received some commissions from Sweden and died there in Karlshamn early the following year. Personal life In 1836, he married Caroline Louise Amalie Gamborg (1809-1873). She was the daughter of Anders Gamborg (1753-1833) who was a professor of philosophy at Copenhagen University. They were the parents of author Ursula Signe Sofie Dahlerup (1840-1925).

Online learning, or virtual classes offered over the internet, is contrasted with traditional courses taken in a brick-and-mortar school building. It is the newest development in distance education that began in the mid-1990s with the spread of the internet and the World Wide Web. Learner experience is typically asynchronous, but may also incorporate synchronous elements. The vast majority of institutions utilize a Learning Management System for the administration of online courses. As theories of distance education evolve, digital technologies to support learning and pedagogy continue to transform as well.  History  The first correspondence courses began in the 1800s using parcel post to reach students who couldn't be on a university campus. By the early 1900s, communication technologies improved and distance education took to the radio waves. In 1919 professors at the University of Wisconsin began an amateur radio station, becoming the first licensed radio station dedicated to educational broadcasting. Soon after, access to higher education was again expanded through the invention of the television; giving birth to what was known as the telecourse. The University of Iowa began to experiment with television for educational purposes in the 1930s. It was not until the 1950s, when the FCC began to reserve television frequencies for educational purposes, that telecourses caught the attention of the public. The value of television for education was furthered by the establishment of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) in 1967. The CPB mission was \\"to encourage the growth and development of public radio and television broadcasting, including the use of such media for instructional, educational, and cultural purposes\\" (as cited in, p. 27). Online learning emerged in 1982 when the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute in La Jolla, California opened its School of Management and Strategic Studies. The School employed computer conferencing to deliver a distance education program to business executives.See Rowan, Roy (1983). Executive Ed. at Computer U. Fortune, March 7, 1983; Feenberg, Andrew (1993). \\"Building a Global Network: The WBSI Experience,\\" in L. Harasim, ed., Global Networks: Computerizing the International Community, MIT Press, pp. 185-197. In 1989 the University of Phoenix began offering education programs through the internet. In 1993 with the debut of the first Internet web browser, created by the University of Illinois, online learning began to flourish. In 1998, the first fully online programs were founded: New York University Online, Western Governor's University, the California Virtual University and Trident University International. The Educational Technology Leadership Program, through the Graduate School of Education and Human Development at The George Washington University, offered a Masters degree beginning in 1992. The program, developed by Dr. William Lynch, originally delivered course content in association with Jones Intercable's Mind Extension University (ME/U). Classes were broadcast via satellite late at night, and student communicated through a Bulletin Board system. Their first cohort graduated in May, 1994. By early 1996, Bill Robie transitioned the ETL Program to the Internet where the graduate degree program was offered completely online. He assembled a set of web-based tools and HTML pages that allowed asynchronous communication among students and faculty, the delivery of lectures, drop boxes for assignments, and other features that have since become the core toolkit for course management systems. https://www.educause.edu/apps/er/review/reviewArticles/29626.htmlhttps://web.archive.org/web/19970301032852/http://www.gwu.edu/~etl/ In 2000 only 8% of students were enrolled in an online course, but by 2008 enrollment had increased to 20%. The expansion of online education has not slowed either; by the fall of 2013 nearly 30% of all postsecondary students were enrolled in some kind of distance education course. Although the data on online course and program completion are complex, researchers have noted high rates of attrition (ranging from 20%-50%) among students enrolled in online courses compared to those who take traditional face-to-face courses. In 2020, the global coronavirus pandemic prompted many universities to hastily transition to online learning in lieu of holding classes in person.https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/will-coronavirus-make- online-education-go-viralhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/opinion/college- education-coronavirus.htmlhttps://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/817885991/panic-gogy- teaching-online-classes-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic  Online operators (methods of delivery)  Given the improvements in delivery methods, online learning environments provide a greater degree of flexibility than traditional classroom settings.Online learning is more flexibility than traditional university college settings. March 28, 2020 Online platforms can also offer more diverse representations of student populations as learners prepare for working in the twenty-first century. The diversity comes from interacting with students outside of one's geographical location, possibly offering a variety of perspectives on course content. Courses offered completely online are primarily delivered in an asynchronous learning or synchronous learning format. Asynchronous learning environments are described as online spaces where work is supported through the use of digital platforms in such a way that participants are not required to be online at the same time. Threaded discussions, e-mail, and telephone calls are options of asynchronous delivery. This gives meaning to the anytime-anywhere appeal of online learning. A benefit of asynchronous learning is the learner having more time to generate content-related responses to the instructor and peer postings; they have time to find facts to back their written statements. The additional time provides an opportunity to increase the learner's ability to process information. The spelling and grammar within postings of an asynchronous environment are like that found in formal academic writing. On the other hand, one of the main limitations of this delivery method is the greater potential for a learner to feel removed from the learning environment. Asynchronous learning is viewed as less social in nature and can cause the learner to feel isolated. Providing the student a feeling of belonging to the university or institution will assist with feelings of isolation; this can be done through ensuring links to university support systems and the library are accessible and operable. Synchronous learning environments most closely resemble face-to-face learning. Synchronous learning takes place through digital platforms where the learners are utilizing the online media at the same time. When compared to asynchronous learning, synchronous online environments provide a greater sense of feeling supported, as the exchange of text or voice is immediate and feels more like a conversation. If platforms such as web conferencing or video chat are used, learners are able to hear the tone of voice used by others which may allow for greater understanding of content. As in a traditional classroom environment, online learners may feel a need to keep the conversation going, so there is a potential for focusing on the quantity of responses over the quality of content within the response. However the synchronous environment, with real- time responses, can allow for students or instructors to provide clarity to what was said, or alleviate any possible misconceptions. Along these lines and applying the two dimensions of “time distance” and “number of participants”, one can classify online distance courses into four distinct groups: * MOOCs (massive open online courses): unlimited in the number of participants, enabling them to learn asynchronously at their own pace. * SMOCs (synchronous massive online courses): unlimited in the number of participants, in which students participate synchronously and in real-time. * SPOCs (small private online courses) number of students is limited, learning takes place in an asynchronous manner. * SSOCs (synchronous small online courses) number of students is limited,require participants to follow the lessons in real time.  Learning management systems  Most online learning occurs through a college's or university's learning management system (LMS). A LMS is a software application for maintaining, delivering, and tracking educational resources. According to the Educause Center for Analysis and Research (ECAR) use of a LMS is nearly ubiquitous as 99% of colleges and universities report having one in place. Among faculty, 87% report using a LMS and find them useful for \\"enhancing teaching (74%) and student learning (71%)\\" (p. 10). Similarly, 83% of students use an LMS for their learning, with the majority (56%) using them in most or all courses. Most institutions utilize LMSs by external vendors (77%), Blackboard currently dominates the LMS environment with an adoption rate of 31.9%, followed by Moodle at 19.1%, and Canvas at 15.3%. However, in the last year Canvas, by Instructure, has gained an increasing amount of the market share (see graphic).The graphic shows the market share of LMS across U.S. and Canadian higher education institutions Reflecting these changes the ECAR reported that 15% of institutions are in the process of updating and/or replacing their LMS; the main reasons cited were the need to \\"upgrade functions (71%), replace legacy systems (44%), and reduce costs (18%)\\" (p. 6). ECAR's survey of institutions found that generally, both faculty and students are satisfied with the LMS; with three-quarters satisfied with the LMS for posting content (faculty) and accessing content (students). In contrast, the lowest levels of satisfaction with the LMS reported by faculty were with features that allow for \\"meaningful\\" interaction between students and their instructor, students and other students, and for study groups or collaborating on projects (p. 12). Similarly, just under half of the students surveyed reported satisfaction of the LMS for \\"engaging in meaningful interactions with students\\" (p. 12). While LMSs are largely being used as a repository for course materials (e.g. syllabus, learning content, etc.) and platforms for the assessment of learning, recent developments are making them more customizable through LTI standards. According to a report by the Educause Learning Initiative the Next Generation Digital Learning Environment will be more responsive to students' needs creating a more customizable experience. The functional characteristics of the next generation of digital learning environments include: \\"interoperability and integration; personalization; analytics, advising, and learning assessments; collaboration; and, accessibility and universal design\\" (p. 4)  Theory  The well-known educational theorist John Dewey argued that learning occurs in collaboration with knowledgeable others. Similarly, psychologist Jean Piaget noted that in order for learning to occur, the content must be meaningful to the student. Piaget's constructivist theory of learning highlighted the importance of engaged learning where meaningful discussions were held between peers. The sociologist Lev Vygotsky also emphasized the importance of social interaction in learning. Traditionally, in formal education this interaction occurs largely between the student and the teacher, but as students and teachers become distanced from each other in the virtual classroom, creative strategies for instruction continue to be developed. While early approaches to online learning were merely an extension of independently-driven correspondence courses, today's approach to online learning focuses on engagement and active learning. Theories of distance education are relatively new to the scene. These theories can be placed into four main categories: 1) theories of independent study (e.g. Charles Wedemeyer, Michael Moore); 2) theories of the industrialization of teaching (e.g. Otto Peters); 3) theories of interaction and communication (e.g. Borje Holmberg); and 4) a synthesis of existing theories of communication and diffusion and philosophies of education (e.g. Hilary Perraton). However, the equivalency theory of distance education posits that all students should have learning experiences of equal value and that it is the responsibility of the instructional designer to create learning experiences for the distance learner that will be successful in meeting the course objectives. As online education has become the dominant form of distance education, new theories are emerging that combine elements of constructivism and technology. Siemens' Connectivism \\"is the integration of principles explored by chaos, network, and complexity and self-organization theories\\".(p. 5) Connectivism places knowledge in \\"diversity of opinions\\" (p. 5) and that learning is aided through creating and nurturing connections of \\"fields, ideas, and concepts\\". (p. 5)  Pedagogy  Transformative learning or Transformative pedagogy \\"encourages students to critically examine their assumptions, grapple with social issues, and engage in social action\\" ( p. 219). Five suggestions for preparing the online environment for transformative pedagogy are: \\"(a) create a safe and inviting environment; (b) encourage students to think about their experiences, beliefs, and biases; (c) use teaching strategies that promote student engagement and participation; (d) pose real-world problems that address societal inequalities; and (e) help students implement action-oriented solutions\\" (p. 220). There are four fundamental characteristics that may assist with the success of online instruction: (1) the learner should be actively engaged throughout the course; (2) group participation can assist with meeting course objectives; (3) frequent student-student and student-teacher interaction can alleviate the feelings of isolation; and (4) the course content should relate to the real world to enhance meaning for participants. However, a student's attitude towards using technology and computers is led by the teacher's ability to impact a student's values and beliefs. Participation and interaction between participants and instructors involves significant and continuous preparation. Online educators are often members of a larger team consisting of instructional and graphic designers and information technology specialists; being open to becoming a member of the team will assist in a smooth transition to online teaching. There is a lack of support and training provided for teachers, hence instructors require training and support first before they can combine technology, content, and pedagogy to design courses. Expectations of learners to be self-motivated, able to manage their time effectively, contribute to course discussions and have a willingness to teach others is not unlike what is expected in a traditional classroom. The instructor's role is to encourage learners to evaluate and analyze information, then connect the information to course content which may assist in learner success. With the potential for learners to feel disconnected from peers within the course, the instructor will need to work to create spaces and encounters which promote socialization. A few recommendations are to create a \\"student lounge\\" as an informal space for socialization not related to coursework. Also, incorporating team projects can help alleviate feelings of isolation. Video and audio components enhance connection and communication with peers, as this supports learners to expand on their responses and engage in discussions. Online instructors should be cognizant of where participants are physically located; when members of the course span two or more time zones, the timing of the course can become problematic. Initial preparation of an online course is often more time-consuming than preparation for the classroom. The material must be prepared and posted, in its entirety, prior to the course start. In addition to preparation, faculty experienced in online instruction spend about 30% more time on courses conducted online. The mentoring of novice online educators from those with experience can assist with the transition from classroom to the virtual environment.  Online credentials  Online credentials for learning are digital credentials that are offered in place of traditional paper credentials for a skill or educational achievement. Directly linked to the accelerated development of internet communication technologies, the development of digital badges, electronic passports and massive open online courses (MOOCs) have a very direct bearing on our understanding of learning, recognition and levels as they pose a direct challenge to the status quo. It is useful to distinguish between three forms of online credentials: Test-based credentials, online badges, and online certificates.

Owned throughout his racing career by Maktoum Al Maktoum and trained in all but one of his races by Ed Dunlop he was a sprinter who raced almost exclusively over distance of six and seven furlongs. In his first two seasons he showed useful but unremarkable form, winning two minor races and a relatively valuable handicap race as a three-year-old in 1995. In the following year he was highly tried, running eleven times and emerging as a top-class performer. He was disqualified after finishing first in the Chipchase Stakes but went on to win the Beeswing Stakes before recording his biggest success in the Group One Haydock Park Sprint Cup. In the same year he finished fourth in both the July Cup and the Prix Maurice de Gheest as well as running sixth in the Breeders' Cup Sprint. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in South Africa. Background Iktamal was a big chestnut horse with a white blaze and long white socks on his front legs bred in Kentucky by Green Ireland Properties Ltd. He was one of the best horses sires by Danzig Connection who recorded his biggest win in the Belmont Stakes in 1986. Iktamal's dam Crystal Cup showed no racing ability in two starts but was exceptionally well-bred: she was a daughter of the outstanding racemare Rose Bowl, who was a half-sister to Ile de Bourbon. As a broodmare, Crystal Cup also produced First Magnitude (Prix du Conseil de Paris) and Rockamundo (Arkansas Derby). As a yearling in October 1993 the colt was put up for auction at the Tattersalls sale and was bought for 75,000 guineas by Maktoum Al Maktoum's Gainsborough Stud. Iktamal was sent into training with Alex Scott at the Glebe House Stable near Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1994: two-year-old season= Alex Scott died after being shot by a recently dismissed member of stable staff on 30 September 1994.\\"Trainer's murderer is jailed for life\\", The Independent, 29 July 1995. Retrieved 2 November 2012. Iktamal made his racecourse debut a month later in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Yarmouth Racecourse. Starting at odds of 14/1 he finished ninth of the thirteen runners, twenty- three lengths behind the winner Peace Envoy. Following Scott's death, the colt was moved to the stable of Ed Dunlop. =1995: three-year-old season= In 1995 Iktamal was beaten in maiden races at Goodwood, Haydock Park and Thirsk before recording his first success over seven furlongs at Redcar Racecourse on 4 August when he won by a short head from the John Gosden-trained Golden Envoy. Nine days later he contested a handicap race at Pontefract and finished fourth of the thirteen runners. Iktamal then won a minor handicap race at Redcar on 23 August and weight-for-age race at Haydock Park on 1 September before winning a handicap at Goodwood eight days later under a weight of 138 pounds. On his final appearance of the season Iktamal was stepped up in class for the Listed Bentinck Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. He was made the 7/2 favourite but finished fourth of the twelve runners behind Royal Figurine. =1996: four-year-old season= Iktamal began his third season by finishing sixth in the Cammidge Trophy at Doncaster Racecourse on 23 March and then ran second to Passion For Life in the Abernant Stakes at Newmarket in April. On 2 May the colt started favourite for a minor race over six furlongs at Salisbury Racecourse and won by one and a quarter lengths from the eight-year-old gelding Everglades. In the Listed Leisure Stakes at Lingfield Park Racecourse on 1 June Iktamal started favourite but was beaten a length by the three-year- old Rambling Bear (later to win the King George Stakes). Later that month he was stepped up in class for the Cork and Orrery Stakes at Royal Ascot and finished fifth of the seventeen runners behind Atraf. Nine days later Iktamal started 6/4 favourite for the Listed Chipchase Stakes at Newcastle Racecourse. After starting poorly he was \\"squeezed\\" through a gap between horses in the last quarter mile and crossed the line in first place. Following an objection and an inquiry by the racecourse stewards he was disqualified for causing interference and relegated to fifth place. Paul Eddery, who had ridden the horse in his last six races, was replaced by Richard Hills when Iktamal was moved up to Group One class for the July Cup at Newmarket. He finished fourth behind Anabaa, Lucayan Prince and Hever Golf Rose with Danehill Dancer and Pivotal in fifth and sixth. Willie Ryan took over from Hills when Iktamal contested the Beeswing Stakes over seven furlongs at Newcastle on 27 July. He started the 3/1 joint-favourite alongside the Mill Reef Stakes winner Kahir Almaydan, whilst the other seven runners included Atraf, Almushtarak (later to win the Sandown Mile) and Branston Abby (Sceptre Stakes). After being restrained in the early stages Iktamal moved up to take the lead \\"on the bit\\" inside the final furlong and won by three lengths from Dance Sequence. Two weeks after his win at Newcastle, Iktamal was sent to France for the Prix Maurice de Gheest at Deauville Racecourse in which he started a 27/1 outsider and finished fourth behind Anabaa, Miesque's Son and Danehill Dancer. On 7 September on good ground at Haydock Park Iktamal started at odds of 10/1 in an eleven-runners field for the Group One Sprint Cup. Miesque's Son started favourite whilst the other contenders were Lucayan Prince, Hever Golf Rose, Danehill Dancer, Blue Duster, Mind Games (Temple Stakes), Royal Applause, Rambling Bear (King George Stakes), Cool Jazz (Diadem Stakes) and Catch The Blues. Ryan restrained the colt in the early stages as first Royal Applause, then Hever Golf Rose and then Blue Duster led the field. Iktamal bega to make the progress in the last quarter mile, overtook Blue Duster inside the final furlong and won by a length. Sheikh Maktoum's racing manager Joe Mercer said \\"This horse simply thrives on racing. He just gets better and better, and Ed has done a great job with him\\", whilst Willy Ryan commented \\"This is a much better horse on fast ground. He's done it very well – I was able to settle him, and when I asked him to go he picked up in an instant\\". On his final appearance, Iktamal was sent to Canada to contest the Breeders' Cup Sprint at Woodbine Racetrack on 26 October. Racing on dirt for the first time he started slowly before staying on in the straight to finish sixth behind Lit de Justice. Stud record At the end of his racing career Iktamal was exported to become a breeding stallion at the Summerhill Stud in South Africa. Pedigree *Iktamal was inbred 3 × 3 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the third generation of his pedigree.

Ali won the bout through a technical knockout in the 11th round. This bout was aired live primetime in the United States via ABC with Howard Cosell doing the play-by- play and it took place in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Fight Ali entered the bout at 224.5 pounds, the heaviest he had ever been at that point in his career. Lyle, at 219 pounds, was also at the heaviest weight of his career. Lyle had offered the opportunity to compete for the title despite his loss to the then little-known Jimmy Young two months earlier at Honolulu, Hawaii. Ali had forecast that the bout would be a \\"treat for the people\\", but in many of the rounds he preferred to defend and absorb Lyle's sharp punches. The challenger had been exhorted by a chant of \\"Lyle, Lyle\\" from several Denver followers, and in the opening round he bloodied Ali's nose, although the bleeding abated. Ali was jarred sporadically by Lyle's punches, usually the right hand. In the fifth, the champion chose to dance, taunting Lyle with jabs but often being pinned against the ropes. In the sixth, he displayed the \\"Ali Shuffle\\", to the delight of the crowd, and to the temporary confusion of the stiff-moving challenger. As the ring girl from the Tropicana Hotel strutted past Ali with a big card signaling the start of the eighth round, Ali stared, aware that this was the round in which he had predicted he would knock Lyle out. From his flatfooted stance, he tried for the knockout, but Lyle cornered and fought him off, particularly with a jarring right hand. For the next two rounds, Ali rested, boxing defensively and retreating to the ropes while accepting Lyle's punches. But in the fateful 11th when he connected with the right hand. Ali suddenly pounced and finished Lyle (Ali was behind on 2 of the 3 scorecards heading into this round as Judge Bill Kipp had Lyle ahead 49-43 on a 5-point must system, while Art Lurie had Lyle ahead 46-45, and Bill Mangiaracina had it 46-46), making the scorecards of the three judges academic and making Lyle's tv home appearance an unartistic success. The end came with 1:08 of the round, after a straight right hand drove the 33-year old ex- convict across the ring and left him defenseless against the champion's onslaught. Referee Ferd Hernandez stopped the bout. Lyle protested briefly, then staggered to his corner in a daze.

The series first aired on 19 September 2016 on Show TV. Both lead actors Çağatay Ulusoy and Aras Bulut İynemli received positive feedback for their acting.  Plot  The series follows the story of two brothers, Sarp (Çağatay Ulusoy) and Umut Yılmaz (Aras Bulut Iynemli), who were separated during their childhood and end up on opposite sides of the law. Umut and Sarp's father, Metin, works as an assassin for one of the most powerful mafia leaders in Istanbul, Celal Duman (Çetin Tekindor). When Metin is arrested and imprisoned, Celal kidnaps three-year-old Umut in order to make sure that Metin will not betray him. Sarp and his mother Füsun (Nihal Koldaş) never learn the truth about Umut's disappearance, as Metin dies in prison without revealing anything. They both think Umut is dead after the police bring them his blood- stained T-shirt, and Sarp grows up blaming himself for what happened to his brother and being constantly haunted by his loss. Years later, Sarp is expelled from the police academy a week before graduation by his commander, Yusuf Kaya (Mustafa Uğurlu). At the graduation ceremony, he attacks Yusuf and is sent to prison for a year. It is subsequently revealed that Sarp and Yusuf planned everything in order for Sarp to infiltrate Celal's group as an undercover officer and help to arrest him. Sarp is even more determined to take down Celal after finding out that he was responsible for Umut's disappearance. Things take an unexpected turn when Sarp finds himself falling in love with Melek Yıldız (Bensu Soral), Celal's adopted daughter and lawyer, who, unbeknownst to him, is very close friends with his own brother. Umut, renamed Mert Karadağ, doesn't remember anything about his family and is loyal to Celal, believing that he saved him and Melek from the abuse they had to endure on the streets. He becomes a police officer and is subsequently accepted into Yusuf's team, where he acts as a spy for Celal. After he falls in love with Eylem Aydın (Damla Colbay), Sarp's childhood friend, his loyalty for Celal is repeatedly tested to the point that he is starting to have doubts about his actions. Mert develops a close relationship with his own mother, Füsun, and a fierce rivalry with Sarp, completely unaware that they are his true family.  Cast and characters  *Çağatay Ulusoy as Sarp Yılmaz: A former convict who becomes part of Celal's inner group, apparently following in his father's footsteps. He is, in fact, working as an undercover officer for commander Yusuf Kaya in order to arrest Celal Duman, whom he blames for the imprisonment and death of his father and for the disappearance of his younger brother Umut, which deeply affected him. Sarp has a strong sense of justice and is very intelligent and skilled, managing to gain Celal's trust and constantly avoiding being exposed as a cop. He falls in love with Melek, Celal's daughter, and finds himself repeatedly at odds with Mert Karadağ, who is, unbeknownst to him, his long lost brother Umut. *Aras Bulut İynemli as Mert Karadağ Duman / Umut Yılmaz: A corrupt police officer in Yusuf Kaya's team, who secretly works as an informant for Celal Duman. He grew up on the streets, where he was forced to sell napkins and suffered constant physical abuse at the hands of his captor, Coşkun. He is unaware that Celal, the man who adopted him and whom he considers his father, is also the man who ordered his kidnapping. Due to the trauma he suffered as a child, he trusts few people and has no friends except Melek, whom he loves like a sister. His greatest desire is to find his real family. Mert is very confident in his abilities to the point of arrogance and manages to save Celal from prison more than once during the series. He falls in love with Eylem Aydın, Sarp's childhood friend, and gets close to Füsun Yılmaz, his real mother; the influence of the two women eventually makes him having serious doubts about his actions. *Çetin Tekindor as Celal Duman: The leader of a powerful mafia group in Istanbul. He has always managed to avoid prison due to the deep loyalty of his people, in spite of the multiple crimes he has committed, such as Umut's kidnapping and the murder of Melek's mother. Celal is completely devoid of empathy, intelligent, highly manipulative and a very good liar, being capable to instill in both Umut and Melek a deep devotion towards him. He found the duo on the streets and raised them as his own. He considers Sarp one of his most trusted men and is completely unaware for most of the series that Sarp is, in fact, an undercover officer. *Mustafa Uğurlu as Yusuf Kaya: A police commander in Istanbul Police Department, who has followed Celal's activity for many years, hoping to arrest him. Yusuf's intense dislike for Celal comes from the fact that Celal used him back in their youth in order to discard one of his mafia rivals; as a result, Yusuf felt responsible for Celal's ascension to power and became determined to do everything he could in order to imprison Celal, sacrificing even his marriage in the process. *Nihal Koldaş as Füsun Yılmaz: The mother of Sarp and Umut, and the ex-wife of Metin. She was kept in the dark regarding her husband's activities and left him immediately after he was arrested, as she felt betrayed by his actions and did not want her children to be associated with a murderer. She is deeply affected by Umut's disappearance and subsequently by Sarp's imprisonment and affiliation to Celal. She is a kind, honest woman with an intense dislike for Celal, whom she blames for ruining the happiness of her family. *Bensu Soral as Melek Yıldız Duman: Celal's lawyer and adoptive daughter. She is Mert’s adoptive sister and best friend. Her parents have been murdered when she was a child, and she was subsequently forced to live on the streets under Coşkun's supervision, where she met Mert, whom she befriended. Unbeknownst to her, she is, in fact, Celal's biological daughter; he was also directly responsible for the murder of her mother. She doesn't have any friends except Mert, as everyone is intimidated by her close ties with Celal's group. She is a caring person, but also very quick to excuse Celal's actions, due to the gratitude and love she feels for him. She falls in love with Sarp without realizing that he is an undercover officer. *Damla Colbay as Eylem Aydın: A photojournalist, Sarp and Umut's childhood friend and neighbor. She is not very close to her parents, due to the fact that they treat her as a friend rather than as a daughter. She loves Füsun and Sarp as if they were her real family, and is very devoted to both of them. She falls in love with Mert without being aware of the fact that he is Umut, or of his connection with Celal. *Rıza Kocaoğlu as Davut: One of Celal's most trusted men, Davut is, at the beginning of the series, the only person in Celal's group whose face and name are not known by the police. He is utterly devoted to Celal, obeying his orders with no hesitation, and is obsessed with Melek to the point of filling a closet with snapshots of her. He takes an immediate dislike to Sarp. *Yıldıray Şahinler as Hasan Alyanak: A mafia member with close ties to Celal. He meets Sarp in prison and introduces him to the group. His main priority is survival, and his loyalty is only to himself, which is why he keeps making alliances with various enemies of Celal, and then betrays them as soon as things do not go as expected. *Nebil Sayın as Coşkun: A former associate of Celal and the man who kidnapped Umut. Coşkun is eventually betrayed by Celal, who tries to kill him. He survives and resurfaces years later, determined to destroy Celal and expose his secrets. *Gözde Kansu as Yeşim Duman: Celal's wife and the mother of his younger child, Mustafa. She disregards her husband's illegal activities. She is suspicious towards Melek and her relationship with Celal, believing Celal to be way too attached to the young lawyer. She can also be manipulative at times, though not nearly as much as Celal. She loves her son dearly and she willingly puts herself in danger more than once for his sake. *Uğur Yücel as Kudret Sönmez Tek: A former friend of Celal, who was in love with Celal's sister, Nermin. Nermin killed herself, and both men blamed each other for the tragedy. Kudret's greatest desire is to get his revenge on the man he considers responsible for ruining his life, and he constantly schemes in this direction, kidnapping even Mustafa and Melek at some point in order to torment Celal. He has great respect for Füsun, Sarp's mother, as she used to be Nermin's best friend.

Along with her second husband, Edward Molloy, she co-edited South Bend National Union (1867–71) and the Elkhart Observer (1872–76), becoming the first female newspaper editor in northern Indiana. In addition to writing for her own newspapers, Molloy's articles appeared under her own name or various pseudonyms in other U.S. publications that included The Woman's Journal and The Revolution, two of the top Women's Suffrage journals. Molloy also traveled in the United States and in England as was well known on the lecture circuit as a prohibition activist. After her first husband's alcoholism led to their divorce in 1867 and her marriage to Edward Molloy a short time later, she became more active in the temperance and suffrage movements as a public speaker. She also joined the Methodist church, which supported prohibition efforts. After divorcing Molloy in 1882 and moving to Illinois, she edited The Morning and Day of Reform, but abandoned her journalism career in 1885. In her later years Molloy continued her temperance activism and evangelism. She moved west to Kansas and Missouri before settling in Port Townsend, Washington, in 1888. She died in California.  Early life and education  Emily F. Barett was born on July 17, 1839, to Harriet (Newton) and William Lovell Barrett in South Bend in St. Joseph County, Indiana. Her parents had migrated to Indiana from New York and settled in South Bend about four years before she was born. Her father was a watchmaker; her mother, a teacher. Both of her parents were active in the First Methodist Episcopal Church of South Bend. Emily Barrett, who later used the name of Emma Barrett, was the only one of the family's three children to survive infancy. When her mother died in 1841, her father went to Chicago to find work, leaving two-year-old Emily behind as a boarder with local families. William Barrett returned to South Bend in 1850 and married Harriet Eaker. In addition to a step-mother, Emily also five half-siblings, two sisters and three brothers.Pickrell, pp. 4–5. Barrett grew up in South Bend and attended local schools, where she developed her writing and dramatic recitation skills. While still in her teens she sought her independence from family responsibilities and became a schoolteacher. Barrett began teaching in a rural one-room school around the age of fifteen or sixteen. In 1856 she established a school in South Bend, about the same time that her first articles were published in local newspapers. Barrett's poetry appeared in the St. Joseph County Forum; her first published stories appeared under the pseudonym of Nellie More in the St. Joseph Valley Register.Pickrell, pp. viii and 6.\\"Biographical Sketch\\" in The use of pseudonyms allowed Barrett to express herself without exposing her true identity. Although she was best known as Emma Molloy, using the surname of her second husband, and Emma F. Pradt and Emma Barrett, using the surnames of her first and third husbands. She also used several pseudonyms in her published works such as Polly Wiggins, Polly Quiggle, and Mabel Claire, among others.Picked ll, pp. viii, 6, and 8–10.  Marriage and family  In 1858, eighteen-year-old Emily Barrett married Louis A. Pradt, a journeyman printer from Wisconsin, and they moved to Sheboygan, Wisconsin. The couple moved frequently during their marriage and lived Indiana and Alabama, as well as Wisconsin. To help supplement the family income, she occasionally worked as a clerical worker, seamstress, milliner (hatmaker), and laundress while continuing to write. Emma and Louis Pradt had two children; a daughter, Lottie, and a son, Allie, both of whom died in infancy. Barrett divorced Pradt in 1867 under Wisconsin's divorced laws due to \\"his habitual drunkenness\\". After the marriage failed, Barrett returned to South Bend, Indiana.Pickrell, pp. 8–12. In November 1867, Emma (Barrett) Pradt married Edward Molloy, a New York native, American Civil War veteran, temperance advocate, and editor of the South Bend, Indiana, National Union. Molloy joined her husband as co- editor of the newspaper and wrote local news article.Pickrell, pp. 1 and 12. In 1871 the Molloys sold the National Union and moved to Cortland, New York, to edit the Cortland Weekly Journal, but within a year they had returned to Indiana. The Molloys settled in Elkhart, Indiana, where they published the first issue of their new newspaper, the Elkhart Observer in August 1872.Pickrell, p. 20. Emma Molloy also became more active in the temperance and women's suffrage movements, delivering lectures on these subjects across the United States and in England. The Molloys were the parents of a son, Franklin; and adopted daughter, De'Etta; and three foster daughters, Cora, Ida, and Emma Lee.Pickrell, pp. 21 and 41. After the Molloys divorced in 1882, Emma moved to Elgin, Illinois, with the children, and later moved to Kansas and California. Edward Molloy never remarried and died in 1914. Their son, Franklin, was born in 1870 and drowned in 1886; their daughter, De'Etta (Molloy) Blakeney eventually settled in Baker City, Oregon; the Molloys' foster daughter, Cora Lee, married George Graham in 1875 and later became Cora Lee Juel.Pickrell, pp. 18, 46, 49, and 51. In 1889, Emma Molloy married her cousin, Morris Barrett, a retired printer. They resided in Port Townsend, Washington, and remained married until his death in 1903. The Barretts were foster parents of a daughter, Bessie Birekes.Pickrell, p. 50. Career Molloy's career included work as a journalist, public lecturer, temperance and women's rights activist, and Christian evangelist. In addition to having articles published in several U.S. newspapers, Molloy co-edited and wrote articles for the South Bend National Union and the Elkhart Observer from 1867 to 1876, becoming first female newspaper editor in northern Indiana. In 1882 she moved to Elgin, Illinois, where she was editor of the Morning and Day of Reform, but abandoned her career as a journalist in 1885. Molloy also traveled the country delivering lectures on the topics of temperance and women's rights. In her later years Molloy also served the Methodist Church in an unofficial capacity as an evangelist.Pickrell, p. 29. =Journalist= Emma Pradt's marriage to Edward Molloy in 1869 led her into northern Indiana's journalism community, although she had an early interest in the field and her first stories and poetry were published in South Bend newspapers when she as a teenager.Pickrell, p. 6. In the early years of her career, she also had articles published in several U.S. newspapers that included the Mishawaka [Indiana] Enterprise, Montgomery [Alabama] Mail',; Wisconsin Patriot, and the North Iowa Times. Her stories written under the pseudonym of Polly Wiggins appeared in the Wisconsin Capitol and became popular among the newspaper's readers.Pickrell, pp. 9–10. Emma and Edward Molloy co-edited the South Bend, Indiana National Union until 1871; shed also co-edited with her husband and wrote for the Elkhart [Indiana] Observer from 1872 until 1876, becoming first female newspaper editor in northern Indiana. Molloy also spent much of her time traveling the country delivering lectures as a temperance and women's rights activist, especially after her husband became editor of the LaPorte County, Indiana, Chronicle in 1878. Her work was also published in other newspapers and journals. After her divorce from Molly in 1882, she moved to Elgin, Illinois, where she edited The Morning and Day of Reform,Pickrell, pp. 31, 41–42. but abandoned her career as a journalist in 1885. Molloy used her journalism to write and spread awareness on issues important to her such as temperance, women's rights to an education and to divorce their husband, prison reform, half-way houses, and the promotion of women working outside the home. =Temperance activist= Molloy's experiences with her first husband's alcoholism, as well as her connection to the Methodist Church, led to her rise as one a prominent temperance activist in the United States. In addition to her work with the Methodist Church, the Women's Crusade movement, and the Women's Christian Temperance Union, Molloy worked with other temperance organizations, including the Good Templars and the Ribbon movement, helping organize local chapters. The 1870s saw a rise in saloons and prostitution in the Elkhart, Indiana, area, which prompted Molloy to publicly address temperance issues. She delivered many lectures for the temperance movement, traveling across the United States to deliver speeches for temperance conferences from 1876 to 1878. She also traveled to England in 1878, a high point of her career, to deliver addresses in London and in other cities.Pickrell, pp. 23, 25, 30–33, and 35–37. Molloy became a member of the Women's Christian Temperance Union and in 1875 was elected vice president of the Indiana chapter. The WCTU formed out of the growing Women's Crusade movement in the midwestern United States.Frances E. Willard, leader the WCTU, called Molloy \\"a much better speaker than any woman now before the public as a temperance lecturer.\\"Pickrell, pp. 25–28. Molloy's temperance activism also lead to invitation to speak at numerous woman's suffrage conventions.Pickrell, p. 30. =Women's suffrage activist= Biographer Martha M. Pickrell states that Molloy used her editorial writing to promote \\"the advancement and of women\\".Pickrell, p. 15. and women's suffrage, as well as self-reliance and increased opportunities for women in education and the workplace. Molloy was a longtime supporter of women's rights, having written on the matter as a young adult and later through her published articles and in her speeches.PIckrell, pp. 15 and 22. After attending the Western Woman Suffrage Convention in Chicago, Illinois, in 1869, she delivered her first lecture on the subject in 1870 in South Bend, Indiana, and other nearby communities.Pickrell, pp. 16–17. Although Molloy's activism did not have a strong focus on the women's suffrage movement, it overlapped with the temperance movement, a major interest for Molloy, and she did not hesitate to voice her support for the suffragists. Molloy's notoriety in the temperance movement, as well as her role as a female journalist, provided additional opportunities for her to speak at suffrage conventions. She also wrote articles, often using pseudonyms such as Aunt Nabby and Mrs. Pat Molloy, among others, for two women's suffrage newspapers, The Woman's Journal which Lucy Stone and Henry Browne Blackwell founded in 1870, and The Revolution, which suffragists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony edited and published.Pickrell, p. 16 and 31. In addition to writing for these suffrage journals, Molloy wrote her own articles written for the South Bend National Union and the Elkhart Observer. The Molloys' newspapers also carried reprints of articles and editorials written by Stanton, Anthony, and other reformers.  Later years  After divorcing Edward Molloy in 1882, she became more involved in lecturing on temperance. In 1885 Molloy abandoned her career as a journalist and became active in the Methodist Church, serving in an unofficial capacity as an evangelist preacher. She also continued be active in the WCTU. Molloy moved with her children to Illinois in 1882 and spent two challenging years in Kansas and Missouri, where her reputation and career were damaged after she and her foster daughter, Cora (Lee) Graham, were falsely implicated in a local murder. After the women were cleared of all charges in 1888, Molloy moved to the Pacific Northwest. She married Morris Barrett in 1889 and spent her final years as a Christian evangelist in the Pacific Northwest, using Port Townsend, Washington, as her home base.Pickrell, pp. 43–44. = George Graham trial = Through her work in the temperance movement, Molloy developed a friendship with George Graham, an ex-convict, and suggested that he be hired as the business manager of the Morning and Day of Reform, the newspaper for which Molloy also worked in Elgin, Illinois. Graham and his wife, Sarah, along with their two children, followed Molloy and her daughters to Washington, Kansas, where the two families shared Molloy's home. Although Sarah Graham and her children returned to Indiana, her husband, George, agreed to stay and manage a farm that Molloy had purchased in Springfield, Missouri. While Graham managed the farm, Molloy continued to travel extensively, delivering public lectures around the United States. In 1885 Graham, who claimed to have divorced his first wife, married Molloy's foster daughter, Cora Lee. In 1886, after the remains of a woman and some of Sarah Graham's clothing were found on her Missouri farm, Molloy and her foster daughter found themselves swept up in the murder case of Graham's first wife. Graham, who was found to be a bigamist, was convicted and lynched for the murder in 1886. Although Molloy and her daughter were released from custody and cleared of the charges, the sensationalized coverage of the events in the local press and the conspiracy theories about the two women's alleged involvement in the murder damaged Molloy's career. Molloy left Kansas in 1888, after she and her daughter, Cora Lee, were cleared of the charges. Molloy then moved with her daughter, De'Etta, to Port Townsend, Washington.Pickrell, pp. 45–48. =Evangelist= In 1889 Molloy married Morris Barrett, a cousin, and the couple established a home in Port Townsend, Washington. Molloy continued her work with prohibition, the WCTU, and the Methodist Church for the rest of her life. She became an evangelical preacher in the Pacific Northwest and continued to spread her ideas on prohibition in her final years.Pickrell, p. 49. Death and legacy In 1907, while making an extended trip to California, Molloy, now a widow, contracted pneumonia and died in Cedarville, California, on May 14, 1907, at the age of sixty-seven.Molloy became ill after being outdoors in bad weather for too long when her coach broke down. Despite feeling ill, she delivered her sermon as planned, but fell into a coma and died a few days later. See Pickrell, p. 50. Her remains are buried at Red Man Cemetery in Port Townsend, Washington. Molloy is remembered for her work as a journalist, temperance advocate, public speaker, women's suffrage activist, and Christian evangelist.Pickrell, p. 51. Honors and awards A stained- glass was installed in her honor in Trinity Church in Port Townsend, Washington.

If a processor is processing P bits in unit time, then P is called the maximum degree of parallelism. = Average degree of parallelism = Let i= 1, 2, 3, ..., T be the different timing instants and P1, P2, ..., PT be the corresponding bits processed. Then, Average parallelism, Pa = (P1 \\\\+ P2 \\\\+ ....PT) / T = Processor utilization = Processor Utilization, μ= Pa/P The maximum degree of parallelism depends on the structure of the Arithmetic and Logic Unit. Higher degree of parallelism indicates a highly parallel ALU or processing element. Average parallelism depends on both the hardware and the software. Higher average parallelism can be achieved through concurrent programs.  Types of classification  According to Feng’s classification, computer architecture can be classified into four. The classification is based on the way contents stored in memory are processed. The contents can be either data or instructions. # Word Serial Bit Serial (WSBS) # Word Serial Bit Parallel (WSBP) # Word Parallel Bit Serial (WPBS) # Word Parallel Bit Parallel (WPBP) = Word serial bit serial (WSBS)= One bit of one selected word is processed at a time. This represents serial processing and needs maximum processing time. = Word serial bit parallel (WSBP) = is found in most existing computers and has been called as Word Slice processing because one word of n bit is processed at a time.

Bit parallel means all bits of a word. = Word parallel bit serial (WPBS) = It has been called bit slice processing because m-bit slice is processed at a time. Word parallel signifies selection of all words. It can be considered as one bit from all words are processed at a time. = Word parallel bit parallel (WPBP) = It is known as fully parallel processing in which an array on n x m bits is processed at one time.

Overview  QIPCO Holding was founded in 1999, initially as a property developer and equity investor, in an effort to claim a stake and contribute to Qatar’s development. It has investments with global companies in various sectors including real estate, construction, oil and gas, trading and advanced services, and finance and joint ventures. Through investing approximately Qrs. 300 million of its capital, the company has sought to maintain diversified interests in the region by forming numerous independently operated subsidiaries that specialize in their respective sectors. These subsidiaries include Midmac Contracting, Mannai Corporation, Black Cat Engineering & Construction, Tornado Company, Special Projects Services Company, Investment House, Al Bustan Real Estate Company, and QIPCO Residential Compound. It has established joint venture companies with strategic partners including Siemens, General Motors, Cisco, ThyssenKrupp, Emcor, and Transfield.  Current standing  Its latest strategy in recent years has been to develop a diversified portfolio focusing on emerging markets. QIPCO has also aligned itself to the Qatar National Vision 2030. In light of the recent granting to Qatar as the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, QIPCO seeks to assist the country in meeting its objectives both in investment and infrastructure strategies and execution as a host city of the World Cup.  Leadership  Currently, QIPCO has 5 members on its board of directors. Its chairman is HH Sheikh Abdulla Bin Khalifa Al Thani and its CEO is Sheikh Hamad Bin Abdulla Bin Khalifa Al Thani, who is also the Chairman of the board of Midmac Contracting Company, LLC. Both men are first cousins to Qatar’s emir. Its Deputy CEO and Director is Mohammed Ali Mohammad Khamis Al Kubaisi. QIPCO’s board of directors is made up entirely of members of Qatar’s ruling family. Hamad bin Abdullah bin Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani is the son of Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani, the current Emir of Qatar, has been in power since 1995 after ousting his father, Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani, in a coup d’état and freezing his finances. He exiled his father to France and Abu Dhabi for nearly 10 years after the fact.  Controversy  In March 2016, Amnesty International released a report stating that in the interviews they conducted with workers refurbishing the Khalifa National Stadium in Doha \\"all reported human rights abuses of one kind or another,\\" and that the \\"vast majority alleged they had their passports confiscated\\", this despite the Qatari government's promise to ensure minimum labour standards on World Cup sites. The contractor refurbishing the stadium is a partnership between a subsidiary of the Belgian company Besix, and the Qatari company Midmac, a QIPCO subsidiary. Midmac is also the main contractor at Al Wakrah stadium.

These are periodically repeated in the two directions of the complex plane. Abel elliptic functions are holomorphic functions of one complex variable and with two periods. They were first established by Niels Henrik Abel and are a generalization of trigonometric functions. Since they are based on elliptic integrals, they were the first examples of elliptic functions. Similar functions were shortly thereafter defined by Carl Gustav Jacobi. In spite of the Abel functions having several theoretical advantages, the Jacobi elliptic functions have become the standard. This can have to do with the fact that Abel died only two years after he presented them while Jacobi could continue with his exploration of them throughout his lifetime. Both the elliptic functions of Abel and of Jacobi can be derived from a more general formulation which was later given by Karl Weierstrass based on their double periodicity. History The first elliptic functions were found by Carl Friedrich Gauss around 1795 in connection with his calculation of the lemniscate arc length, but first published after his death.J. Stillwell, Mathematics and Its History, Springer, New York (2010). . These are special cases of the general, elliptic functions which were first investigated by Abel in 1823 when he still was a student.A. Stubhaug, Niels Henrik Abel and his Times, Springer-Verlag, Berlin (2000). . His starting point were the elliptic integrals which had been studied in great detail by Adrien-Marie Legendre. The year after Abel could report that his new functions had two periods.O. Ore, Niels Henrik Abel – Mathematician Extraordinary, AMS Chelsea Publishing, Providence, RI (2008). . Especially this property made them more interesting than the normal trigonometric functions which have only one period. In particular it meant that they had to be complex functions which at that time were still in their infancy. In the following years Abel continued to explore these functions. He also tried to generalize them to functions with even more periods, but seemed to be in no hurry to publish his results. But in the beginning of the year 1827 he wrote together his first, long presentation Recherches sur les fonctions elliptiques of his discoveries.N.H. Abel, Recherches sur les fonctions elliptiques, Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik, 2, 101–181 (1827). At the end of the same year he became aware of Carl Gustav Jacobi and his works on new transformations of elliptic integrals. Abel finishes then a second part of his article on elliptic functions and shows in an appendix how the transformation results of Jacobi would easily follow.N.H. Abel, Recherches sur les fonctions elliptiques, Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik, 3, 160–190 (1828). When he then sees the next publication by Jacobi where he makes use of elliptic functions to prove his results without referring to Abel, the Norwegian mathematician finds himself to be in a struggle with Jacobi over priority. He finishes several new articles about related issues, now for the first time dating them, but dies less than a year later. In the meantime Jacobi completes his great work Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum on elliptic functions which appears the same year as a book. It ended up defining what would be the standard form of elliptic functions in the years that followed. Properties Under his short stay in Copenhagen in 1823 under the influence of Carl Ferdinand Degen Abel started to work on the elliptic integrals which previously had been investigated and classified by Legendre. The integral of the first kind he wrote on the symmetric form : u = \\\\int_0^x \\\\frac{dt}{\\\\sqrt{(1 - c^2 t^2)(1 + e^2 t^2)}} where c and e are arbitrary parameters. Initially they will be considered to be real numbers, but can eventually also take complex values.J. Gray, The Real and the Complex: A History of Analysis in the 19th Century, Springer, Heidelberg (2015). . In the special case and the integral gives the arc length of a circle, while for it leads to the arc length of the lemniscate. He could thus make contact both with the trigonometric functions (circular functions) and the lemniscatic functions which Gauss had hinted at in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. The value u of the integral is a function of the upper limit x of the integral. As long as x < 1/c this value will increase with increasing x and reach a maximum : {\\\\omega\\\\over 2} = \\\\int_0^{1/c} \\\\frac{dt}{\\\\sqrt{(1 - c^2 t^2)(1 + e^2 t^2)}}. when x = 1/c. So far there was nothing new in this what Legendre had not already done. But Abel's stroke of genius was now to consider the inverse function x = φ(u). This is well-defined in the interval 0 ≤ u ≤ ω/2 with . Since the defining integral is an odd function of the upper limit, this new function φ(u) will also be odd and thus defined in the whole interval with the special values By taking the derivative with respect to u on both sides of the integral, the derivative can be found. It leads to : \\\\varphi'(u) = \\\\sqrt{(1 - c^2\\\\varphi^2(u))(1 + e^2\\\\varphi^2(u))} which now is an even function with the values and For the two square roots which here appear Abel introduced the new functions : f(u) = \\\\sqrt{1 - c^2\\\\varphi^2(u)}, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; F(u) = \\\\sqrt{1 + e^2\\\\varphi^2(u)} which also are even. From above one finds f(0) = F(0) = 1 together with and . If one considers φ(u) to be a generalized sine function, then these two even functions can be seen as generalized cosine functions of which there now are two. In terms of them one then has the derivative on the more compact form Similarly, it then follows that and =Addition formulas= Euler and Legendre had shown that the elliptic integrals satisfied different addition theorems. Abel gave a new derivation of this for the particular integral he considered and found : \\\\varphi(u_1 + u_2) = {\\\\varphi(u_1)f(u_2)F(u_2) + \\\\varphi(u_2)f(u_1)F(u_1)\\\\over 1 + c^2 e^2 \\\\varphi^2(u_1)\\\\varphi^2(u_2)} For the two other elliptic functions he similarly obtained : \\\\begin{align} f(u_1 + u_2) & = {f(u_1)f(u_2) - c^2\\\\varphi(u_1)\\\\varphi(u_2)F(u_1)F(u_2)\\\\over 1 + c^2 e^2 \\\\varphi^2(u_1)\\\\varphi^2(u_2)} \\\\[5pt] F(u_1 + u_2) & = {F(u_1)F(u_2) + e^2\\\\varphi(u_1)\\\\varphi(u_2)f(u_1)f(u_2)\\\\over 1 + c^2 e^2 \\\\varphi^2(u_1)\\\\varphi^2(u_2)} \\\\end{align} Making use of these he could now extend the range of the argument over which the functions were defined. For example, setting in the first formula, it gives : \\\\varphi\\\\big(u \\\\pm {\\\\omega\\\\over 2}\\\\big) = \\\\pm {1\\\\over c}{f(u)\\\\over F(u)} and similarly for the two other functions, : f\\\\big(u \\\\pm {\\\\omega\\\\over 2}\\\\big) = \\\\mp \\\\sqrt{c^2 + e^2}{\\\\varphi(u)\\\\over F(u)}, \\\\;\\\\; F\\\\big(u \\\\pm {\\\\omega\\\\over 2}\\\\big) = {\\\\sqrt{c^2 + e^2}\\\\over c} {1\\\\over F(u)} With u = ω/2 one thus has so that the functions will be defined in the whole interval . Repeating this extension one step more, one finds . This function is then periodic φ(u + 2ω) = φ(u) with period 2ω. For the two even functions one similarly obtains and . The function f(u) thus also has the period 2ω, while F(u) has the shorter period ω. =Complex extension= Abel could also extend his new functions into the complex plane. For that purpose he defined the conjugate integral : v = \\\\int_0^y \\\\frac{dt}{\\\\sqrt{(1 + c^2 t^2)(1 - e^2 t^2)}} where the parameters c are e are exchanged. The upper limit y can again be taken as a function of the integral value v. This is a real number and increases steadily from zero to a maximal value : {\\\\omega'\\\\over 2} = \\\\int_0^{1/e} \\\\frac{dt}{\\\\sqrt{(1 + c^2 t^2)(1 - e^2 t^2)}} for y = 1/e. By changing the integration variable from t to it, Abel found that . This elliptic function could thus be found for purely imaginary values of the argument. In particular one has . Using the addition theorems one can then calculate the functions for a general complex argument of the form . For this complex extension one needs also the values of the two other elliptic functions for imaginary arguments. One finds f(±iω' /2) = and . Thus it follows that : \\\\varphi\\\\big(u \\\\pm i{\\\\omega'\\\\over 2}\\\\big) = \\\\pm {i\\\\over e}{F(u)\\\\over f(u)} and similarly for the two other functions, : F\\\\big(u \\\\pm i{\\\\omega'\\\\over 2}\\\\big) = \\\\pm i\\\\sqrt{c^2 + e^2} {\\\\varphi(u)\\\\over f(u)}, \\\\;\\\\; f\\\\big(u \\\\pm i{\\\\omega'\\\\over 2}\\\\big) = {\\\\sqrt{c^2 + e^2}\\\\over e} {1\\\\over f(u)} Since f(±ω/2) = 0, it follows that the three elliptic functions diverge at ω/2 ± iω' /2 and other points related by symmetry. These divergences turn out to be simple poles, but this part of complex analysis was not yet so developed at the time of Abel. =Double periodicity= The above complex extension was defined for imaginary arguments in the interval . But using the addition formulas this can be extended to . Replacing then u with in the same formulas, it follows that . This elliptic function is therefore periodic also in the imaginary direction with period 2iω'. In addition, one then also has : \\\\varphi(u + \\\\omega \\\\pm i\\\\omega') = \\\\varphi(u) so that the function can equivalently be said to have the two complex periods . Since φ(0) = 0, the function will also be zero in all points where m and n are integers. These zeros thus form a regular lattice in the complex plane as the poles also will. For the two other functions Abel found and . The function f(u) thus has the period iω' in the imaginary direction while it is 2iω' for F(u). Their zeros and poles will again form a regular lattice reflecting their double periodicity. After Gauss had died it was discovered that he had discovered a corresponding double periodicity in his lemniscate elliptic function. =Jacobi elliptic functions= From the defining integrals one sees that Abel's elliptic functions can be expressed by the Jacobi elliptic functions for imaginary values k = ie/c of the modulus. The precise relation between these functions can be found by a change of the integration variable and is : \\\\varphi(u;c,e) = {1\\\\over c} \\\\operatorname{sn}(cu,ie/c) For the two secondary functions this results in : f(u;c,e) = \\\\operatorname{cn}(cu,ie/c), \\\\;\\\\; F(u;c,e) = \\\\operatorname{dn}(cu,ie/c) After Abel died in 1829 Jacobi continued his investigations of the elliptic functions. With time they became numerically tabulated and ended up being the standard elliptic functions.M. Abramowitz and I.A. Stegun, Handbook of Mathematical Functions, Dover Publications, New York (1983). . Using these for imaginary values of the modulus, one can therefore also calculate the corresponding Abel elliptic functions.

He participated in World War I as a medical officer until he was honorably discharged in 1918. He is well known for prospering an independent African- American economy by his formation of the Baldwin Business Center, St. Mary's Hospital, and Sandy Beach Resort. The institutions were meant to go over the restrictions placed upon African-Americans by Jim Crow laws, preventing entry to white establishments. Baldwin Memorial Park was formed in his honor. Early life Baldwin was born on March 20, 1881, in Belvoir, North Carolina, and was the oldest child of Reverend James Hayes and Mary Crutchfield Baldwin. His father was a Methodist priest. Baldwin's paternal grandfather, Jerry Baldwin, and maternal grandmother, Margaret Crutchfield, were both slaves. Baldwin worked as a farm worker from a very young age and displayed his intelligence by graduating from the Apex Normal and Industrial Institute at the age of 16 in 1897. Soon after, Baldwin moved to attend Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina. The years before the war, Baldwin found it difficult to maintain his practice, but found that it grew more each year by the growing African-American population. Baldwin married a woman named Vina in 1911. They were situated on Fayette Street, the heart of Martinsville's African American American business district. At the start of World War I, Baldwin was 36 years old and immediately he volunteered. Military service Upon entry into the military, Baldwin was commissioned to the Medical Reserve Corps, and, like many of his peers, he was sent for basic training at Fort Des Moines Provisional Army Officer Training School. He was given the rank of First Lieutenant. Fort Des Moines had been opened for training African-American men as there had been a huge influx of African-American volunteers and a petition was erected by the students of Howard University. However, there was still some discontent at the facility as many soldiers found that he had been unfairly assessed for merely being black. This or discontent with his superior might have been a factor in Baldwin submitting his resignation from the 368th Ambulance Company of the 92nd Division, 317 Sanitary Train post he had been assigned. Once he arrived in France, Baldwin had the main responsibility of handling sanitation concerns, surgery duties and hospital illnesses. Much of the 92nd Infantry Division was involved with trench warfare and were aiding the French in pushing back the German forces, who sent a large number of gas attacks into the field. However, Baldwin found himself mostly concerned with the breakout of influenza which came in September 1918. A large portion of the Baldwin's patients mostly consisted of illness. The war came to a close in 1919 and Baldwin was honorably discharged on April 2. Career Baldwin returned to Martinsville, and resumed working in his practice. It was after his military service that Baldwin really began to put an active effort in improving the conditions of the African-American Community. In the Virginia edition of The History of the American Negro\\", Dr. Baldwin stated that in order for the African American community to prosper, people should start \\"by advocating and working for better schools, better churches... by seeing to it that children are instructed in civic duty in the schools and taught the importance and power of the ballot. Many of the white hospitals in the area had barred entrance or denied rights for African-Americans. In 1929, Dr, Baldwin opened a 27-bed facility meant to house the poor African-American population unable to afford or enter other hospitals. It was named St. Mary's, for his mother who had encouraged him down the road to medicine. He coordinated with a younger brother who'd owned his own pharmacy. The area was designated \\"Baldwin Block\\". Baldwin opened a number of other business in the majority of the 1920s and 1930s, including the Sandy Beach Resort, Baldwin Miniature Golf Course, Baldwin's Gymntorium and Baldwin Business Center. All these facilities were opened to the African American community as the many white institutions were barred because of the Jim Crow laws. Dr. Baldwin was also a heavy contributor for a number of churches and societies, including AMR Church, the Masons, Old Fellows, Magic City Medical Society and The National Medical Association. Dr. Baldwin was given media attention after treating an African American man for a broken leg and forced the police department to pay his bill regarding the injury. Baldwin continued his practice for 60 years and never retired. Death and legacy Dr. Baldwin died of a stroke on November 9, 1972. He was buried in Wake County, North Carolina, in the Baldwin Burial site, where a number of his family are also buried. Dr. Baldwin was well remembered in the Martinsville community as being selfless and working with all his might to provide a brighter future for his brethren. The Virginia Foundation for the Humanities erected the Dr. Dana O. Baldwin Memorial Park situated in Baldwin Block. There are also a number of streets in the area named after him. St. Mary's stayed open until 1952 and was memorialized in an exhibit made by the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities. Personal life On December 24, 1911, Baldwin married Vina S. Flood, daughter of L. F. and Elizabeth Flood. Vina had been educated in Hatshorn College and was a teacher in a number of local public schools. The couple did not have children of their own. However, they adopted two girls: Mae and Rosa Baldwin. The couple also raised another three boys and one girl as foster children.

That story was adapted into the 1910 play Alias Jimmy Valentine by Paul Armstrong. The program's stories focused on Lee Randall, described by Jim Cox in his book, Radio Crime Fighters: More Than 300 Programs from the Golden Age as \\"an ex-con and reformed safecracker [who] applied his talents and enormous underworld contacts to abet the forces of law and order.\\" While doing so, he became an honest bank clerk and fell in love with the daughter of the banker.

Personal life  Virginia Faulkner was born in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1913. Her father Edwin J. Faulkner (1884-1931) was general counsel of the Woodman Accident Company, which her grandfather Albert O. Faulkner (1859-1927) had founded as the Modern Woodmen Accident Association in 1890. Her brother Edwin J. Faulkner Jr. would later serve as president of the Woodmen Accident & Life Company from 1938 to 1977. She graduated from Lincoln High School in 1928 and attended University of Nebraska-Lincoln for two years. She then attended Miss Moxley's School for American Girls in Rome. She spent a year at Radcliffe_College, where she became friends with Florence Meyer, daughter of Eugene Meyer. Eugene Meyer offered her a job as a reporter at The Washington Post, which he had just bought at auction, and she began work there in November 1933. Although she remained with the Post for just six months, she helped modernize the newspaper's Sunday magazine section with clever The New Yorker-style articles, including a series titled \\"Our Own Washington Letter.\\" While working at the Post, Faulkner finished her first novel, Friends and Romans, which was published by Simon & Schuster in July 1934. The New York Times's reviewer found \\"Miss Faulkner's little opun is not only romantic, in an agreeably light and somewhat irreverent manner, but it is also decidedly and refreshingly 'comico.'\\" Variety, on the other hand, judged that \\"Some of the lines are funny, but mostly it's such a race for witticism that the reader is the first to be tired.\\" She left the Post in April 1934 to begin work on her second novel, The Barbarians, which Simon & Schuster published in March 1935. She moved to New York City soon after and began publishing comic articles and short stories for Town & Country and Cosmopolitan. The same week that The Barbarians was published, Faulkner married Everett Weil, a cotton broker and casual acquaintance after a long night of drinking. When she awoke the next morning, she fled Weil's apartment and immediately applied to annull what newspapers described as their \\"highball elopement.\\" The marriage was annulled in August 1935, but the publicity didn't hurt the sales of The Barbarians. The novel, about the escapades of a group of artists and musicians living on the Left Bank in Paris in the 1920s, was something of a prequel to Friends and Romans and featured a number of the same characters. The New Yorker called it \\"quite as absurd and no less witty\\" than Friends and Romans and The New York Times said Faulkner was \\"a veritable genius for dialogue that snaps and sparkles.\\" In September 1935, she signed a contract with Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer studios and moved to Hollywood. There she was teamed with Gottfried Reinhardt and contributed dialogue for a number of films, including Conquest and Bridal Suite. Unhappy with work in Hollywood, however, she left in February 1938, sailing for England in the company of John Davenport and his wife. After her return from Europe, she moved back to New York City and resumed writing for magazines and continuing a series of comic articles for Town & Country about the adventures of a ne'er-do-well gatecrasher named Princess Tulip Murphy. A dozen of these pieces were collected in My Hey-Day, subtitled The Crack-up of the International Set and published by Duell, Sloan and Pearce in June 1940. Reviewing the book in The New Yorker, Clifton Fadiman wrote that \\"Miss Faulkner is Saki on a boisterous bender, Dorothy Parker gone informal to the point of madness.... Sometimes funny, sometimes just gaga, she is wicked, wicked, wicked as she can be.\\" Later that year, she contributed skits for a short-lived Broadway revue titled All in Fun starring Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson. Early in 1941, she met the composer and songwriter Dana Suesse and the two women began a relationship that lasted until Suesse moved to France to study with Nadia Boulanger in late 1947. Faulkner had become a frequent contributor to The Saturday Evening Post and other popular magazines by then, but she and Suesse longed to collaborate on a Broadway musical. Based on their combined reputations, RKO Pictures bought the movie rights to their play for $50,000, but when the stage production debuted on Broadway in February 1947, it closed after a week. George Jean Nathan wrote of the show, \\"That I remained in my seat for two of the three acts is still another indication that I am probably losing my mind, or at least what after so many such experiences is left of it.\\" After the show closed, Suesse and Faulkner travelled to Haiti to attempt, without success, to write another play. Suesse decided to move to France to study composition with Boulanger and Faulkner began to struggle with alcoholism and depression, seeking treatment at several clinics. Having become friends with the former bordello owner Polly Adler, she agreed to ghostwrite Adler's autobiography. The book, A House is Not a Home, was published in 1953 and became a national bestseller. In 1955, Faulkner moved back to Lincoln at the encouragement of her brother Edwin. She joined the University of Nebraska Press as an associate editor and contracted to edit Roundup: A Nebraska Reader, which the Press published in 1957. In 1958, she joined the staff of Prairie Schooner, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's literary magazine, working alongside her colleague and companion, the poet and English professor Dr. Bernice Slote. Faulkner and Slote became involved in the establishment of Willa Cather Pioneer Memorial and were instrumental in the revival of Cather's literary reputation. They edited a series of volumes of Cather's uncollected writings that was published by the UNP in the 1960s. Ironically, the two women also used their positions to discourage attempts by scholars to emphasize feminist interpretations of Cather's work. Although Faulkner confessed \\"It's a holy mystery to me how music is composed,\\" she collaborated with composer Robert Beadell on a musical, Out to the Wind, based on Cather's short story \\"Eric Hermannson's Soul.\\" It was performed at the Kimball Recital Hall in Lincoln in February 1979. Faulkner stepped down as editor-in-chief at the UNP in August 1980 and died a month later.

From 2009 onwards, the company has created a variety of games for smartphones and tablets. Its most successful titles are the running game series Cookie Run.  History  = Before Devsisters: 2007-2009 = Devsisters co-founder and co- CEO Ji-hoon Lee founded the company Extra Standard together with others in 2007 with the goal to develop edutainment software. However, due to the lack of capital the company found itself doing mostly contract work for big businesses, and Lee decided to abandon that line of business. Up until 2013, Devsisters was described as a start-up founded in 2009, but starting with the company's preparation of going public on the KOSDAQ index, it was established that Extra Standard had been renamed to Moblier and later to Devsisters. = Early Years: 2009-2012 = Operation under the name Moblier began on January 2, 2009 and was led by Ji-hoon Lee (CEO), Se-joong Kim (COO) and Min-woo Ryu (CSO). The name Dev Sisters (as two words) was initially used as a brand name on the company's mobile apps, until it was officially renamed to Devsisters in April 2010. Moblier was one of the earliest companies in Korea to approach the new iPhone App Store platform after its introduction in July 2008. Because the iPhone wasn't available in Korea at the time of the company's inception and a game category wasn't introduced to the Korean App Store until 2011, the company initially targeted an international audience. In its early days, the company also developed utility and entertainment apps before shifting its focus to the creation of video games due to the success of the early title OvenBreak, which was downloaded more than 10 million times and became ranked as the most popular free app on the App Store in 20 different countries by 2011. Co-founder and COO Sejoong Kim left the company in January 2010 to found Jellybus. Minwoo Ryu likewise left the company in May 2012. In March 2011, Jongheun Kim joined the company as Co-CEO. In 2010, Devsisters received its first investment of 1 billion Korean won from Com2Us. Another investment of 4 billion won by Soft Bank Ventures and MVP Capital followed in June 2011. The company started to grow rapidly, from 10 employees to 52 within one year, and by June 2012, the company had 64 employees. Despite the investments and increased staff, Devsisters could not repeat the success of OvenBreak between 2010 and 2012. The Bell named Devsisters as an example of a mobile game developer where investments hadn't paid off. By 2013, the company was described as a team of merely 12 members. = Cookie Run Era 2013-2015 = Only after shifting its focus onto the Korean market, Devsisters saw its biggest success yet with Cookie Run, a spiritual successor to the OvenBreak series released on April 2, 2013 via the messaging app Kakao Talk. It became the #1 top-grossing game on Google Play and #6 top-grossing game on the App Store in May that year, which caused Devsisters to rank #10 among \\"Top Publishers by Monthly Game Revenue\\" worldwide on Google Play, according to the Website App Annie. Within 12 weeks, the game was downloaded 10 million times as the seventh game to reach that number on Kakao Game. By April 2014, the number of downloads had grown to 20 million in Korea alone. With Cookie Run, Devsisters generated 61.7 billion Korean won in annual sales and 22.3 billion won in net profits in 2013. On January 29, 2014, LINE Corporation launched Cookie Run globally (except China and South Korea), with translations into Chinese (Traditional), English, Japanese, Spanish and Thai. LINE Cookie Run surpassed 10 million downloads within 30 days of release, earning the #1 rank among free apps on the App Store in Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Macao, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. The game was especially successful in the latter two countries, where it held the top spot for 13 days. As of April 4, 2014, LINE Cookie Run surpassed 20 million downloads. At the height of the game's popularity, both versions combined accumulated roughly 10 million daily active users. In April 2016, around the game's three year anniversary, Devsisters celebrated 55 million accumulated downloads for LINE Cookie Run and 26 million for Cookie Run for Kakao. Devsisters had also signed a deal with the Chinese publisher iDreamsky in 2013. iDreamsky announced the game would be published in China via the messaging app WeChat later in 2014. However, during a month-long open beta phase that started in December 2014 with 16,000 players, the game didn't meet requirements made by platform owner Tencent and thus the service was cancelled. Devsisters announced that it would move its efforts towards other platforms and an expansion onto the Chinese market with the upcoming sequel. Due to the success of Cookie Run, Devsisters' yearly revenue rose from 800 million Korean Won in 2011 to 61.7 billion in 2013. In October 2013, NHN Entertainment announced the purchase of a 22% share in Devsisters at 5.6 billion Won, 7.4% of which were bought by earlier investor Com2Us, who had previously owned 14.8%. NHN Entertainment stated that they expected a \\"great synergy between the two companies through joint marketing or development\\". The relationship led to NHN Entertainment publishing the puzzle game Cookie Run Munjil Munjil, a rebranded version of Disney Tsum Tsum, on May 27, 2014. On September 21, 2014, Devsisters announced its initial public offering of 2,700,000 shares at 53,000 won per share to be traded under the symbol of \\"194480\\" on the KOSDAQ Stock market on October 6. On May 2015, the company announced the establishment of its own subsidiary, the startup investment company Devsisters Ventures. = Sequel Development: 2015-2016 = In late 2014, an analyst for Yuanta Securities mentioned in an evaluation of Devsisters: \\"There’s too much dependency on a single game, which is the biggest risk for the company\\". By 2015, the popularity of Cookie Run began to wane, resulting in Devsisters' revenue dropping to 19.5 billion Korean Won for that year. In April 2015, Devsisters announced the development of a sequel, tentatively named Cookie Run 2, to be launched globally in the second half of that year. Later the planned release date was stated more precisely for December. A researcher described the development process as \\"slow, but on track\\". However, on November 6, Devsisters announced that the game would be delayed. Under the title Cookie Run: OvenBreak, the sequel was finally soft-launched on the Apple App Store and Google Play in Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Philippines, Netherlands and Sweden on September 27, 2016. On October 5th, it was announced that the game would be published globally (with the exception of China) on the 27th of that month.

The individual beta strands are labeled with their traditional designations (for historical reasons, sheet A is not used), highlighting the packing of the BIDG and CHEF four-stranded sheets. The jelly roll or Swiss roll fold is a protein fold or supersecondary structure composed of eight beta strands arranged in two four-stranded sheets. The name of the structure was introduced by Jane S. Richardson in 1981, reflecting its resemblance to the jelly or Swiss roll cake. The fold is an elaboration on the Greek key motif and is sometimes considered a form of beta barrel. It is very common in viral proteins, particularly viral capsid proteins. Taken together, the jelly roll and Greek key structures comprise around 30% of the all-beta proteins annotated in the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database. Structure The basic jelly roll structure consists of eight beta strands arranged in two four-stranded antiparallel beta sheets which pack together across a hydrophobic interface. The strands are traditionally labeled B through H for the historical reason that the first solved structure, of a jelly roll capsid protein from the tomato bushy stunt virus, had an additional strand A outside the fold's common core. The sheets are composed of strands BIDG and CHEF, folded such that strand B packs opposite strand C, I opposite H, etc. Viral proteins The full assembled capsid structure of the satellite tobacco mosaic virus, with the monomer shown above at the bottom of the highlighted pentamer. The remainder of the protein chains are shown in purple and the RNA in the interior of the capsid is shown in brown. The axis of the jelly roll in this single jelly roll capsid is parallel to the capsid surface. From . A large number of viruses build their exterior capsids from proteins containing either a single or a double jelly roll fold. This shared capsid architecture is thought to reflect ancient evolutionary relationships, possibly dating to before the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of cellular life. (Enclosed protein capsids themselves likely evolved at least twice, as other viral lineages use evolutionarily unrelated proteins to build their capsids.) =Single jelly roll capsid proteins= Single jelly roll capsid (JRC) proteins are found in at least sixteen distinct viral families, mostly with icosahedral capsid structures and including both RNA viruses and DNA viruses. However, the majority of the single JRC viruses are positive- sense single-stranded RNA viruses, and the only double-stranded DNA viruses with single-JRC capsids are the Papillomaviridae and Polyomaviridae, both of which are quite small. The architecture of the assembled capsid orients the axis of the jelly roll parallel or \\"horizontally\\" relative to the capsid surface. =Double jelly roll proteins= A monomer of the double jelly roll major capsid protein P2 from bacteriophage PM2. The two distinct jelly roll domains are shown in red and blue, with the remaining protein sequence in orange. In contrast to single jelly roll capsids, double jelly rolls are oriented with the \\"vertical\\" axis perpendicular to the capsid surface, which is at the bottom in this image. From . A pseudohexameric trimer of double jelly roll proteins; the jelly rolls are in red and blue and the loops and helices are colored to distinguish the three monomers in the assembly. The viewer is looking down from the exterior toward the capsid surface. From . Double jelly roll capsid proteins consist of two single jelly roll folds connected by a short linker region. They are found exclusively in double- stranded DNA viruses of at least nine different viral families, including viruses that infect all domains of life, and spanning a large capsid size range. In the double jelly roll capsid architecture, the jelly roll axis is oriented perpendicular or \\"vertically\\" relative to the capsid surface. Double jelly roll proteins are believed to have evolved from single jelly roll proteins by gene duplication; however, because of the major differences in architecture and assembly, it is unclear whether the double jelly roll capsid evolved directly from a single jelly roll capsid or if the two capsid forms represent distinct lineages of adaptation from common ancestral jelly roll proteins. However, the degree of structural similarity among double-jelly-roll virus capsids has led to the conclusion that these viruses likely have a common evolutionary origin despite their diversity in size and in host range; this has become known as the PRD1-adenovirus lineage (Bamfordvirae). Although most members of this group are icosahedral, a few families such as the Poxviridae and Ascoviridae have oval or brick-shaped mature virions; poxviruses such as Vaccinia undergo dramatic conformational changes mediated by highly derived double jelly roll proteins during maturation and likely derive from an icosahedral ancestor. Shared double-jelly-roll capsid proteins, along with other homologous proteins, have also been cited in support of the proposed order Megavirales containing the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV). Double jelly roll proteins have not been observed in cellular proteins; they appear to be unique to viruses. For this reason, detecting clear homology to double jelly roll proteins in the sequences of polinton/Maverick transposable elements widespread in eukaryotic genomes is considered evidence of these genetic elements' close evolutionary relationship to viruses. =Non-capsid proteins= Single jelly rolls also occur in non- capsid viral proteins, including minor components of the assembled virion as well as non-virion proteins such as polyhedrin. Cellular proteins While double jelly rolls are not found in proteins of cellular origin, single jelly rolls do occur. One such class of cellular proteins is the nucleoplasmins, which serve as molecular chaperone proteins for histone assembly into nucleosomes. The N-terminal domain of nucleoplasmins possesses a single jelly roll fold and assembled into a pentamer. Similar structures have since been reported in additional groups of chromatin remodeling proteins. Jelly roll motifs with identical beta-sheet connectivity are also found in tumor necrosis factor ligands and proteins from the bacterium Yersinia pseudotuberculosis that belong to a class of viral and bacterial proteins known as superantigens. More broadly, the members of the extremely diverse cupin superfamily are also often described as jelly rolls; though the common core of the cupin domain structure contains only six beta strands, many cupins have eight. Examples include the non-heme dioxygenase enzymes and JmjC-family histone demethylases. Evolution Comparative studies of proteins classified as jelly roll and Greek key structures suggest that the Greek key proteins evolved significantly earlier than their more topologically complex jelly roll counterparts. Structural bioinformatics studies comparing virus capsid jelly-roll proteins to other proteins of known structure indicates that the capsid proteins form a well-separated cluster, suggesting that they are subject to a distinctive set of evolutionary constraints. One of the most notable features of viral capsid jelly roll proteins is their ability to form oligomers in a repeated tiling pattern to produce a closed protein shell; the cellular proteins that are most similar in fold and topology are mostly also oligomers. It has been proposed that viral jelly-roll capsid proteins have evolved from cellular jelly-roll proteins, potentially on several independent occasions, at the earliest stages of cellular evolution. History and nomenclature The name \\"jelly roll\\" was first used for the structure composed of an elaboration on the Greek key motif by Jane S. Richardson in 1981 and was intended to reflect the structure's resemblance to a jelly or Swiss roll cake. The structure has been given a variety of descriptive names, including a wedge, beta barrel, and beta roll. The edges of the two sheets do not meet to form regular hydrogen bonding patterns, and so it is often not considered to be a true beta barrel. Cellular proteins containing jelly roll-like structures may be described as a cupin fold, a JmjC fold, or a double-stranded beta helix.

In the Byzantine period an important church was located here, which appears on the Madaba map. Since then a mosque, going by the name Nabi-Zakariah, has been built on the site of the church.Ben-Yosef (n.d.), p. 179 Some of the ruins of the church are preserved in the courtyard and roof of the mosque. In general, some of the houses in the village are built on top of ancient ruins and caves (among which is a columbarium). During the Crusader era, Casale Zacharie, like nearby al-Khidr, probably was a Christian village, and it was granted with al- Khidr to the church of Bethlehem between c. 1155 and c. 1186.Pringle, 1993, p. 204 Pottery fragments from the Mamluk era have also been found. =Ottoman era= In the Ottoman census of 1538-1539, Bayt Dhakariyya was located in the nahiya of Halil,Toledano, 1984, p. 289, has Bayt Dhakariyya at location 35°07′00″E 31°40′05″N. while in 1557, it was noted that the village revenues went to an Imperial imaret in Jerusalem.Singer, 1994, pp. 26, note #6; 165 In 1852, Edward Robinson noted Beit Sakarieh “on an almost isolated promontory or Tell, jutting out northwest between two deep valleys; and connected with the high ground south by a low neck between the heads of those two valleys.\\"Robinson and Smith, 1856, pp. 283-284 An Ottoman list from about 1870 notes a Muslim wali, dedicated to a Sheikh Zakarja, located under a large tree.

Beside the path is a square foundation about 50 feet side, of roughly-dressed stones. The remains on the hill-brow are those of a large modern village, with more ancient foundations. One wall consists of stones 4 1/2 feet long, 2 feet high, roughly dressed. There is also a mosque, with a portico on the west, sunk below the surface. On the north side of this portico a pillar is placed with a capital of basket- work (see illustration), like the eighth century Byzantine capitals. The shaft is 2 feet diameter. The mosque door was shut ; perhaps it may represent the site of the church which once stood at this place. [..] Drafted stones with a rough boss were also found, and another capital, apparently Byzantine. To the west of the site are rock-cut tombs, now blocked. A tree grows over the Mukam, or mosque.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 108 French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village and described the ruins he saw around the village mosque: > A small mosque contains, they say, a tomb, which is no longer visible, > buried as it is under rubble; it is believed to contain the venerated > remains of Abu Zakaria.

Thanks to her compatriot Enrique Cuscó, she was able to contact the owners of the former, who broadcast her first telenovela in that country, 1967's Lucecita. Fiallo has not written an original telenovela since Cristal in 1985, since the last project she worked on, La Felicidad, was never completed and she decided to retire. At that time, she sold the rights to her works to Televisa. Their adaptations, as she has declared on several occasions, she has not liked. Personal life She has been married to radio director Bernardo Pascual since 1952. She is mother to five children (four girls and one boy), and has 13 grandchildren. She currently resides in Miami, Florida. By Fiallo's account, she has not visited Venezuela since the election of former President Hugo Chávez in 1998. Telenovelas =Original= El ángel perverso The protagonist of the original radionovela is Angelina, a wicked woman who impersonates an invalid to retain her husband Gustavo, and finally, after being discovered, is devoid of truth. However, in order to meet the standards of telenovelas, in which the protagonist must be good, Fiallo was forced to introduce a new character into the first teleplay – Lucecita, an illegitimate peasant daughter of Angelina's father. She starts working as a maid in the house and has a love affair with Gustavo. The story was intended to end after the death of Angelina in an accident, with Gustavo and Lucecita happily married with a daughter, but because of its success, Fiallo wrote an extension in which Gustavo is left with amnesia after an accident, and Angelina's nurse Mirtha (who had secretly been in love with him) takes him and the girl from the country to make him believe she is his wife. Meanwhile Lucecita, without losing hope of finding her husband and daughter, comes to serve at the house of the Aldamas, a family of miserable millionaires who regain their happiness through Lucecita. Five years later, Gustavo, Mirtha, and the girl return, and Lucecita starts working as a maid in their house to be near her daughter. Gustavo, still amnesiac, falls in love with Lucecita not knowing that she is actually his true wife. This version of the story is the one which has remained in all subsequent adaptations, all very successful. * Lucecita – Venezuela (1967) with Marina Baura and José Bardina * Estrellita, esa pobre campesina – Argentina (1968) with Marta González and Germán Krauss * – Venezuela (1972) with Adita Rivera and Humberto García * Lucecita – Argentina (1976 film) * Virginia – Venezuela (1984) with Alba Roversi and Miguel Ángel Landa (very loose adaptation) * Estrellita mía – Argentina (1987) with Andrea del Boca and Ricardo Darín * ' – Colombia (1992) with Linda Lucía Callejas and Guillermo Gálvez * ' – Peru (1998) with Angie Cepeda and Christian Meier La señorita Elena Elena, a beautiful teacher, arrives at the mansion of an elegant judge to serve as governess.

History  This church was originally built at about a thousand steps from the eastern town walls in Alcamo;Storia della parrocchia dei Santi Paolo e Bartolomeo though nobody knows the exact date of its construction, we know, from the deed of the notary Pier Antonio Balduccio IV, that it already existed in 1545. On 19 June 1619 it was aggregated to the church of Santissima Trinità, that had recently been elevated to parish by the bishop of Mazara del Vallo following his pastoral visit. In 1633 they founded here the Congregation of Our Lady with a Chain (extinguished later), which was formed by butchers.Cataldo, Carlo (2001). La conchiglia di S. Giacomo. Alcamo: Edizioni Campo. Owing to the distance of this church from the town, and the uncomfortable walk, above all in winter, the members of this Congregation decided to rebuild it, at their own expense, in a place nearer to the built-up area. For this reason, in 1661 they bought the houses with vaulted roof called \\"case della Macina” (houses of the millstone), located opposite the south-eastern walls of the town from the Convent of saint Clare, and, under their patronage, founded the new Church of Our Lady with a Chain. In the same year they asked the Bishop the permission to carry the ancient image of the Virgin Mary into the new church, but the transport was blocked by the new beneficiary parson of the old Church who imposed in exchange that the administration of the new church were assigned to the parish of Santi Paolo e Bartolomeo, rather than the parish of Santissima Trinità. After coming to an agreement, the sacred image was carried on 26 June 1661. In 1922 the Reverend Ignazio Corrao founded here the female Congregation of Our Lady with a Chain.

Voters chose twelve electors, or representatives to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. A rapid recovery from the depression of 1920 and 1921, despite major Republican losses during the 1922 House electionsAyers, Edward; Gould, Lewis; Oshinsky, David and Soderlund, Jean; American Passages: A History of the United States, Volume II: Since 1865, p. 677 placed the Republican Party – who gained a record popular-vote majority in the 1920 election – in a secure position despite the death of President Warren G. Harding in 1923. Rises in wages and ebbing of discontent further solidified the GOP's hold on power. More critically, the Democratic Party was mortally divided between its rural Southern faction led by William Gibbs McAdoo and its white ethnic urban northeastern faction led by New York Governor Al Smith.Grantham, Dewey; The South in Modern America A Region at Odds, p. 106 The rural faction was supported by the revived Ku Klux Klan and was in favour of Prohibition, whereas the white ethnic faction was firmly against the anti-Catholic Klan and opposed to Prohibition. A fierce debate ensued that saw a compromise candidate, former Congressman John W. Davis of West Virginia, nominated after one hundred and three ballots in hot summer weather at Madison Square Garden.Paulson, Arthur C.; Realignment and Party Revival: Understanding American Electoral Politics at the Turn of the Twenty- First Century, p. 51 Although West Virginia was a border state whose limited African-American population had not been disenfranchised as happened in all former Confederate States,Ranney, Joseph A.; In the Wake of Slavery: Civil War, Civil Rights, and the Reconstruction of Southern Law; p. 141 Davis did share the extreme social conservatism of Southern Democrats of his era. He supported poll taxes, opposed women's suffrage, and believed in strictly limited government with no expansion in nonmilitary fields.Newman, Roger K.; The Yale Biographical Dictionary of American Law, p. 153 In the liberal, heavily Scandinavian Upper Midwest, Davis' social and economic views had practically no appeal.Stark, Rodney and Christiano, Kevin J.; 'Support for the American Left, 1920-1924: The Opiate Thesis Reconsidered'; Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 31, No. 1 (March, 1992), pp. 62-75 Although in September Davis underwent an extensive tour of the region and of the Great Plains,Tucker, Garland; High Tide of American Conservatism: Davis, Coolidge, and the 1924 Election, p. 191 and campaigned to eliminate the income tax burden of the poorer classes,Richardson, Danny G.; Others: \\"Fighting Bob\\" La Follette and the Progressive Movement: Third-Party Politics in the 1920s, p. 180 he received a mere 6.80% of the vote in Minnesota. This constitutes the second-smallest proportion of any state's popular vote received by an official on-ballot Democratic presidential nominee since the election of 1860, when the party was divided. The only smaller proportion was by Grover Cleveland in Nevada in 1892, when he received only 6.56% of the vote. The conservatism of Coolidge and Davis made it inevitable that aging Wisconsin maverick Robert M. La Follette, Sr. would mount a third-party challenge – which La Follette had planned even before the Democratic Convention. La Follette was formally nominated on July 4 by the \\"Conference for Progressive Political Action\\" and developed a platform dedicated to eliminating child labor and American interference in Latin American political affairs, along with a formal denunciation of the Ku Klux Klan.Richardson; Others, pp. 182-183 La Follette also proposed major judicial reforms including amendments allowing congress to override judicial review and to re-enact laws declared unconstitutional.Moreno, Paul D.; The American State from the Civil War to the New Deal: The Twilight of Constitutionalism and the Triumph of Progressivism, p. 205 La Follette also called for election of federal judges for ten-year terms.Parrish, Michael E.; Anxious Decades: America in Prosperity and Depression, 1920-1941, pp. 70-71 Davis and Coolidge both spent most of their campaign attacking La Follette as a political extremist, but nonetheless opinion polls showed that La Follette was attracting large numbers of those German-American and Scandinavian-Americans who completely deserted Cox in 1920.Tucker; High Tide of American Conservatism, p. 181 In September some polls had La Follette winning sufficient electoral votes to give no candidate an electoral majority and force the House to make a choice,Tucker; High Tide of American Conservatism, p. 231 but as polling day approached newer polls suggested incumbent President Calvin Coolidge would hold the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nevada and Montana, which La Follette had been predicted to win in August. As it turned out, Coolidge won the state over La Follette by a margin of 81,567 votes, or 9.92 percent. Nationally, the incumbent President almost equalled Harding's landslide popular vote victory, achieving a 25.22 percent lead over Davis and 382 electoral votes. Despite Davis' shocking statewide performance – not polling twenty percent in any of Minnesota's eighty-seven counties – this election would prove the last as of 2017 when Ramsey County has not voted Democratic,Sullivan, Robert David; ‘How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century’; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 for La Follette's vote would turn to beaten Democratic nominee Smith in the following election and remain with the party for many decades. With 41.26% of the popular vote, Minnesota would prove to be La Follette's third strongest state in the 1924 election in terms of popular vote percentage after Wisconsin and North Dakota.

The series was published monthly by BOOM! Studios as three oversized issues, beginning in October 2014. In October 2015, BOOM! Studios released all three issues, along with extra features from the writer and artist, in trade paperback form.  Background  Tynion IV came up with the idea for Memetic in 2012, when he was getting started in the comic book industry and wanted to create something along the lines of the horror genre. He describes Memetic as coming to him “fully formed,” and he further says that the pitch document from two years prior to the comic's publication looks very much the same as the final product. Aaron and Marcus, the main protagonists, were created from the beginning of Memetic’s conception. Tynion wanted his protagonists to be “counter-points” to the world around them. He describes Aaron as like himself in college, and expresses that he thought it was important for Aaron to be a queer character.  Plot  Issue one At 7:04 am on “Day One,” an image of a sloth against a colorful spiral background appears on the Internet and instantly becomes a viral sensation. Viewers of the image, which is dubbed “Good Times Sloth,” claim that seeing it makes them feel amazing and tingle with happiness, and they have difficulty looking away. Aaron Sumner, a queer college-age student who is colorblind and requires hearing aids, is trying to get a hold of his boyfriend Ryan after the two had an argument. His best friend Sarah attempts to share her excitement over the meme, but Aaron cannot feel the effects of the image due to his colorblindness. He repeatedly texts Ryan, begging him not to look at the meme. Meanwhile, Marcus Shaw, a blind war veteran, becomes troubled by the sloth image when his friend Richie becomes obsessed with it. He contacts the Barbara Xiang, an old friend and the author of an essay about “weaponized memetics,” who isn't sure what to think of the situation, but notices that those who view the image feel compelled to spread it to others. On the night of “Day One” it is discovered that twelve hours after exposure to the meme, one begins screaming and becomes violent. These so-called “screamers” bleed from their eyes and attempt to kill anyone around them who has not yet begun screaming. Aaron and Sarah's friend Martin becomes a screamer and kills their other friend Bastian. The two escape and barricade themselves in Aaron's room, but Sarah realizes she doesn't have much time left and runs to see her family. Elsewhere, Richie becomes a screamer and attempts to kill Marcus, but he fights back and survives the attack. The issue ends with Ryan appearing at Aaron's door and telling him that he hasn't looked at the image yet. Issue Two On the morning of “Day Two,” society begins to descend into chaos as armed police forces and screamers kill each other in the streets. Throughout the day, as more people begin screaming, the screams become louder and louder to everyone near them. Barbara escorts Marcus to Washington D.C., to lead a small task force to Oregon to confront the creator and original poster of the image, who they believe might have a cure. The task force is made up of Marcus, Dr. Peter Klein, Captain Meredith Schroeder, and Sergeant Casey Quinn. The team makes their way through an airplane hangar to find a plane to take to Oregon, but they are ambushed by screamers. Casey is killed in the fighting, but the remaining team members manage to secure a plane. Aaron and Ryan decide to go to the college's medical center. Although Aaron is relieved to find a large stock of his medication, he also finds his parents, who have become screamers, locked behind a glass window by his doctor, Dr. Crowne. Crowne has become delusional due to the meme's effects, and is distressed by Aaron's inability to feel the same euphoria. He attempts to capture Aaron so that he may be operated on to correct his colorblindness, but Aaron breaks the window and frees his parents, who kill Dr. Crowne. Fleeing the medical center, Aaron and Ryan take refuge in an abandoned expensive apartment, where they have sex. Afterward, Ryan reveals that he accidentally saw the meme that morning. Aaron begs Ryan not to leave him alone, but Ryan is afraid of turning into a screamer like his brothers did, and commits suicide by jumping from the apartment balcony. In the airplane, Marcus, Peter, and Meredith hear the screams of the screamers over their radio, and experience a wave of euphoria. Peter realizes that the meme has already evolved, and explains that the screams of the screamers are combining to reveal the “next shape” of the meme. By hearing the screams, Marcus and the others have experienced the effects of viewing the image, and now only have twelve hours left to complete their mission. Issue Three On “Day Three,” the screamers cease being violent. They accumulate all over the world in spaces with high volumes of other screamers, strip off their clothes, and begin climbing each other to form incredibly tall human towers. After a little while, the people begin fusing together, with nothing left but their screaming heads. Aaron considers killing himself, but he discovers a walkie-talkie with someone asking for help. A child on the other end asks him to come save her, as she has been locked in a closet by her father with no food. He ventures out to save to her. On the way, he discovers the towers, and finds that he is immune to the effects of the screaming because of his hearing disability. While searching for the child, he also comes into contact with Barbara Xiang on the walkie-talkie, who still has not seen the meme or heard the screams yet. She has lost contact with Marcus and the others, but is still trying to find a way to save humanity. Aaron finds the little girl, but discovers that she wants to join everyone else in the tower. He lets her go, and finds that he is upset that he can't feel what everyone else is feeling. Marcus, Peter, and Meredith arrive in rural Oregon and find the creator of the meme. He is an artist who goes by the name of The Maker, and is clearly insane. He reveals to them that he was instructed by “the angels” to create the Good Times Sloth in order to trigger this apocalyptic event. The Maker kills himself, and has already destroyed his computers, leaving no possibility for a cure. Marcus and the others expect that they will become screamers at any moment. Meredith commits suicide, while Peter is open to finding out what happens next. Marcus re-establishes communications with Barbara, and says goodbye as he feels the transformation begin. Barbara contacts Aaron, her last connection to the outside world and her last chance of finding a cure. Aaron, however, decides that he wants to feel what everyone else is feeling. He expresses sadness that his entire life, his colorblindness and hearing disability have left him unable to experience certain things that everyone else experiences, such as the color of the sky. He strips and climbs the tower while Barbara begs him not to. Abandoning the walkie-talkie, Aaron fuses with the tower, and finally feels the same euphoria as everyone else. In the final moments of the issue, Barbara sees something entering the atmosphere on her computer screen. The last page shows “Day Four” beginning with a gigantic alien being descending on Earth from a hole in the sky.  Film adaptation  In January 2020, it was reported that the comic book would be adapted into a film by Point Grey Pictures, in association with Boom! Studios and Lionsgate. Mattson Tomlin will write the screenplay for the film.  Reception  Memetic received positive reviews. Benjamin Tilton from Slug Magazine, in his review for the trade paperback, says that days after reading the comic he is “still haunted by it.” He also complimented the artwork, calling it “fun and almost cartoon-like.” The Big Comics Page Team also applauded the originality of the concept and the artwork. Chase Magnett from ComicBook, in his review of the third issue, commended the twists in the final issue that “add[s] to both the joy and terror of the series.” Memetic was nominated for the 2015 GLAAD Award for Outstanding Comic Book, but lost to Kurtis J. Wiebe's Rat Queens.  References  Category:Boom!

In the wake of the attempted putsch, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government closed down media companies linked to exiled cleric Fethullah Gülen and his Hizmet Movement. Turkey's General Directorate for Press, Broadcasting, and Information also revoked at least 620 journalists' accreditations. As a result of the crackdown, 2,308 media workers and journalists have lost their job. Turkey's media purge has also occurred online: regulators blocked at least 30 news-related websites. Websites not linked to Gülen's movement, such as Wikileaks and the Turkish satirical weekly Leman, are among those blocked inside Turkey. In addition 48 online news stories from outlets including The Independent have been censored. Three stories were about corruptions allegations involving the president's son Bilal Erdogan. Wikipedia is also blocked in the country since April 2017.  Chronology of Purge  On Thursday July 21, six days after the failed coup d’état, Turkey’s parliament approved a bill declaring a state of emergency allowing the government to rule by decree for three months. On the same day, Erdogan announced that the European Convention on Human Rights had been suspended. Under the Turkish constitution, during a state of emergency, the government can overturn the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms, as long as it respects international laws. However, the 15th article of the Turkish Constitution states that the ECHR cannot be suspended. In this context and that of a wider purge in Turkey with 40,000 arrests and 160,000 suspensions of officials, President Erdogan initiated a purge of media and journalists suspected of sympathy with the Gülen movement.Gulen's Hizmet movement On July 27th, Erdogan published a decree in Turkey's official government gazette,http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2016/07/20160727M2-1.pdf ordering the shutdown of three news agencies, 16 TV channels, 23 radio channels, 45 newspapers, 15 magazines and 29 publishing houses (see list below). By the force of the state of emergency, \\"all goods, assets, rights, documents and papers [belonging to those media outlets] will be transferred, free of charge, to Turkish treasury with no appeal to be made\\". Also, 89 arrest warrants were issued for journalists who were alleged plotters in the failed attempt to overthrow the government. During the same week, 17 journalists were charged with membership in Gülen’s movement, which the government considers a terrorist group. On August 5, this number increased to 36 journalists indicted for the same charge. The Turkish government justified the arrests for security reasons and said the journalists were being investigated and prosecuted for participating in criminal activities. On August 27, the Platform for Independent Journalism (P24), a press freedom group, said the number of journalists arrested since the coup was 108.  Reactions  Press freedom groups have condemned the crackdown. The Turkish representative for Reporters Without Borders called the arrests \\"a witch hunt against journalists\\". David Kaye, the UN special rapporteur on the right to freedom of expression said that \\"the attempted coup cannot justify such a broad attack against almost all voices, not just critical ones but analytic and journalistic.\\" \\"The disregard for any assurance of due process is flagrant and only contributes to the extreme levels of insecurity affecting all those working to inform people of the ongoing crisis in the country,\\" said Dunja Mijatović, the media freedom representative of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe's representative on media freedom. The Committee to Protect Journalist's program coordinator for central Asia, Nina Ognianova, said that the \\"scale of this rout of the media is staggering.\\" She added: \\"The government is exploiting a failed coup to silence the critical press when Turkey most needs pluralistic media.\\" The Turkey director at Human Rights Watch, Emma Sinclair-Webb, added to the criticism \\"In the absence of any evidence of their role or participation in the violent attempt to overthrow the government, we strongly condemn this accelerated assault on the media, which further undermines Turkey’s democratic credentials\\", she said.

A high school standout in his native Southern California, he later led Los Angeles City College (LACC) to its first state junior college title in 1997. After his college career, he played for some International Basketball League teams, and later with the Harlem Globetrotters. The oldest of four children born to a former Idaho State star and his young wife, he had given up basketball before returning to it for his last two years at Temple City High School. He soon became a star player himself as well as a top college prospect, likened by those who saw him play to Lamar Odom. He had the opportunity to play for several NCAA Division I basketball programs, but never did due to a combination of academic and personal difficulties. He then chose to attend Cal-State Northridge despite interest from much higher-profile colleges and the NBA, a decision for which he was sharply criticized since it was seen as limiting his chances of reaching the NBA. Harris ended his season at Northridge after being suspended twice for violations of team rules. He eventually made his way to the Globetrotters, but injuries from a 2000 assault forced him to quit after one month. After leaving basketball, the alcoholism that had begun to manifest itself during his college career intensified, and Harris became addicted to illegal drugs as well. He was arrested many times before he was able to recover from his addictions in 2007. By October 2014, Harris had relocated to Seattle with a longtime girlfriend and had applied for a job there. He never arrived there from a trip from his mother's home in Alhambra to complete the move; he was last heard from when he left a message for his girlfriend. The call was traced to the Sacramento area, and his abandoned car was found in a Yolo County park several days later. There were some possible sightings up to a week afterwards, but none have been confirmed beyond a cell phone video the night of his disappearance, and extensive searches since have failed to find any trace of him in the area. His disappearance has been featured on an episode of the Investigation Discovery series Disappeared. Early life Harris was the first son born to Henry Harris, a former star forward for Idaho State who, after his college years in the mid-1970s, was playing in a semiprofessional league in Los Angeles when he met Margaret Fernandez, then 17. She gave birth to Rico, the first of the couple's four children, in 1977. Afterwards they moved to Oregon, where Henry had been offered a job. Henry Harris was for most of the time a loving husband, but occasionally he would turn violent and abusive. They moved back to the Los Angeles area shortly afterwards, and had three more children. Henry would often verbally and physically abuse his children, especially Rico. Despite that, Rico deeply craved his father's affection and approval into his adulthood. Margaret eventually left her husband, taking the children with her as she moved to Alhambra, the suburb where she had grown up. Rico often held the family together while Margaret worked full-time. Although she later said she felt her oldest son was \\"born to play basketball\\", by the age of 15 he had given it up despite his size, and was considering becoming an actor. To that end, he and a friend attended Hollywood High School, a long trip from their homes. After a year, Rico changed his mind about basketball and returned to the court. Despite the minimal contact he had had with his father since his parents' divorce, he used his father's Temple City address to enroll in high school there for his junior year. Basketball career For most of his teens and 20s, Harris was praised for his NBA-level potential. The pinnacle of his playing career, however, would be the 1996–97 season, when he was the MVP of the state community college tournament and led his team to the state championship. He only played one season for a Division I team, however, and despite considerable interest from NBA teams never came close to signing with them. =High school= Rico, then and , was an immediate sensation on the basketball court. His presence on the team transformed the previously undistinguished Temple City program into a contender, and drew college scouts. \\"Other teams would double- and triple-team him,\\" recalled one of his coaches. \\"But you could just watch him for a couple plays and you could see the player he could be.\\" Harris had been a fan of the 1980s Los Angeles Lakers teams, and in particular emulated Magic Johnson's style of play. Off the court, Rico was initially shy and a poor student. However, after meeting a girlfriend whose academically inclined family helped him with his studying, he improved both socially and academically, achieving a 3.0 grade point average. On the court at that time, he became an even more dominant player, averaging 28 points and 15 rebounds a game during his senior season. The Long Beach Press-Telegram recognized him as one of the best high school players in the Western United States during the 1994–95 season, along with Chauncey Billups, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry, all of whom went on to long careers in the NBA. Jim Harrick, who had just left the head-coaching position at UCLA to take over the University of Rhode Island program, had his eye on Harris, who he had recruited at his former position. He believed Rico could be part of a powerful team at Rhode Island, with Zach Marbury and Lamar Odom, who he was expecting to sign for the next season. However, Harris's newfound academic success did not extend to the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), where he did not do well. UCLA had to withdraw its scholarship offer as a result. =College= Harris went to Arizona State under Proposition 48, which limited him to taking classes during his freshman year in order to regain his eligibility. Without his family and friends close by, he struggled academically and socially, as he originally had at Temple City. In March 1996 he was arrested on a charge of unlawful imprisonment along with two teammates after two women said the players had forced them to perform sex acts against their will. The charges were dropped after investigators uncovered inconsistencies in the women's stories, but the university asked Harris to sit out another year nonetheless. Los Angeles City College Instead, Harris returned to California and enrolled in Los Angeles City College (LACC), a two-year junior college, in the hope of improving his grades and playing for Harrick at Rhode Island. On the court, Cubs' coach Mike Miller let Harris play the game his way—shooting three-pointers, leading the fast break with no-look passes and faking out other big men under the basket as it suited him. \\"He could do it all,\\" a teammate recalled in 2014. \\"He was Lamar Odom before Lamar Odom.\\" Harris was the team's biggest star, frequently regarded as the best player on the court from either team in every game he played. He averaged 16.5 points and 14 rebounds a game. NBA scouts began attending games, hoping that Harris might consider foregoing his college career entirely once he was old enough to do so. LACC posted a 30–6 record that season. It culminated in the school's first-ever California Community College Athletic Association state title, secured with an upset win over San Jose City College. Harris was named the championship tournament's most valuable player. A few weeks after that triumph, early in 1996, Harris signed his letter of intent to attend Rhode Island and play for Harrick there. However, he stopped attending a psychology class he needed to pass midway through the semester, and failed it as a result, leaving him still ineligible under National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules to transfer to a four-year college and play there. At the time there was speculation that he had deliberately failed the class to avoid having to relocate to the East Coast, far away from his hometown. That speculation notwithstanding, Harris made his first-ever trip east of Chicago later that year to visit UConn, where an assistant coach who had seen him play likened him to Donyell Marshall, a former Huskies' star who had left school early for an NBA career. He told the Hartford Courant that he had learned from his Arizona State experience. \\"This time around, I know exactly what I want,\\" he said. In addition to a Division I program, he was still considering declaring for the NBA draft or playing in a professional league overseas. \\"I'm in no rush.\\" Harris ultimately returned to LACC for his second season, which he would later say was a mistake. He became less focused, partying heavily with his brother in the apartment they shared near campus, and drinking beer during the day to take the edge off his hangovers. It did not affect his game, however. A teammate recalls Harris showing up for a game once wearing heavy sunglasses to mask the effects of the alcohol. \\"He probably didn't get no sleep and [was] up all night—then dropped like 35 [points] that game\\". The team did not repeat as state champions, and Harris was later described as \\"a disruptive influence\\" during that season. Miller at one point suspended him for six games; Harris in turn faulted him for not controlling the team adequately. As the only returning player on that team, he explained, many of his teammates would not give him the ball. \\"I have no excuses,\\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \\"I was playing against my own teammates and coaching staff.\\" Harris's drinking increased as the season wore on, leading to social isolation and costing him his relationship with the girlfriend who he had benefited from in high school. Recruiters from other four-year college programs continued to call and write, but Harris did not respond, believing many of them to be interested in him only for his athletic ability and not his personal development. Instead he declared himself for the 1998 NBA draft. NBA scouts still saw lots of potential in Harris, and invited him to a pre-draft camp in Chicago for the most highly regarded prospects. But as he had the year before, he would not take the opportunity. Shortly before the camp, he not only decided he would not attend but withdrew from the draft, believing that he was not ready for the challenge on a personal level. Cal State Northridge The opportunity to play for Harrick at Rhode Island was still available to Harris, and many friends and observers believed he would take it. In September 1998, he called Bobby Braswell, then the head coach at Cal State Northridge, whom Harris had come to know three years earlier when Braswell had recruited him while an assistant at Oregon. Braswell later recalled that he thought Harris was calling for guidance. Braswell congratulated Harris on signing with Harrick at Rhode Island. \\"That's not happening\\", Harris told him. He did not want to move that far away, and believed LACC coach Miller was trying to get him to go there strictly out of his friendship with Harrick and not out of any consideration for Harris's best interests. Instead, he asked if he could he play for Braswell, whom he trusted, at Northridge, closer to his family, where he could transfer his credits from Arizona State and LACC to become eligible immediately. Since another local high school player that Northridge had offered a scholarship to had lost it after purposely failing a class, there was space for Harris at the small state school, which had not posted a winning record the seven seasons it had been in Division I. Braswell immediately told Harris the opening was his. Harris believed Braswell's reputation for strict discipline was what he needed most to develop as a person and a player. With a player of Harris's level, talent rarely seen at a smaller school like Northridge, Braswell hoped he could realize his goals of a winning season, a Big Sky Conference title and a berth in the NCAA tournament. But while there was plenty of potential for Braswell in the relationship, observers saw less for Harris. Miller told him he was severely compromising his chances of signing with an NBA team by playing for such a small school in a less competitive conference, and others who knew him wondered if instead of leading the Matadors to new heights as he had in his first season at LACC, he would instead pose a threat to team unity again. Braswell was optimistic. \\"Rico wants to make the best of this opportunity,\\" he said to the Times. But early in the season it seemed as if the doubters had been correct. Harris had attempted to reconcile with his father in the offseason but had been rebuffed. He continued drinking heavily and could no longer fully contain his underlying emotional difficulties; early in the season Braswell suspended him briefly after he argued with other teammates and coaches. A hip pointer also sidelined him for five games. He still performed well, averaging 10 points a game and leading the team in rebounds, but the NBA scouts who had been following his career could see that his performance was off from his previous heights, and took him off their lists of prospects. Near the end of the season Braswell suspended Harris again; the player did not attend a meeting with his coach in Braswell's office to mark his reinstatement. Harris would never play college basketball again, and left Northridge shortly after the season's end. =Post-college= Harris could not play for any other college as his eligibility had expired. He still had not given up on possibly making the NBA, and like his father before him took up semi-professional basketball. He played for short periods of time with the International Basketball League's San Diego Stingrays and St. Louis Storm. Rapper Master P, a former NBA player who had played briefly with the former team, put together a traveling team for which Harris played a few games. During this time, he drank less and worked on his jump shot, hoping the NBA had not completely lost interest in him. In spring 2000, Harris opted instead to join the Harlem Globetrotters. His skills were ideal for the Globetrotters' shows, and he seemed to have found his niche. However, a month after he joined the team he was out driving with a girlfriend in South Los Angeles when he got into a dispute with some people there. After he left the car to confront them, someone hit him on the back of the head with a baseball bat. Harris was able to leave the scene and drove off. But soon he started having intense headaches and had trouble keeping his balance. These aftereffects of the head injury persisted, and he had to leave the Globetrotters. At the age of 24, his basketball career was over. Addiction and recovery Harris returned to his mother's house in Alhambra. He had no job prospects, and no plans for what he might do besides play basketball. Soon he returned to drinking. His mother continued to take care of him as well as his younger siblings, all of whom were likewise battling substance use disorders to some degree. She hoped Rico would, in her words \\"snap out of it\\", but his addiction instead broadened to include heroin, methamphetamine and crack. \\"He would sniff Ajax just to feel the burn\\", a friend, David Lara, recalled. Throughout the 2000s, Harris experienced many relapses. He was arrested over a hundred times, most commonly for public intoxication. After a few days in jail, he often resumed drinking. To support his habits, he would sometimes beg in the street. \\"It was despair, bro. It was down there. It was the darkest of the dark,\\" says Lara of the sight. Efforts to persuade Harris to end his self-destructive path failed. Only in 2007, shortly after he turned 30, did he finally start to change. After an overdose of prescription medicine he had tried, Harris entered a rehabilitation facility operated by the Salvation Army in downtown Los Angeles. The program took a long time for Harris to complete, but when he did, he seemed to have recovered. He moved in with Wilfredo Mayorga, another graduate of the program, and got a job working security detail in nearby Bell. At a party he met Jennifer Song, a visitor from Seattle who worked as an insurance broker. The two soon became romantically involved, and starting in 2012 they began spending long weekends in the other's city. By September 2014 they had begun to talk about getting married, even going so far as to discuss possible names for children. Harris and Mayorga clashed over the relationship; their friendship ended when Harris abruptly moved out of the apartment and left Mayorga with all the unpaid bills. Shortly afterwards, Harris moved in with Song in Seattle, intending to relocate there permanently. Disappearance Converting their long-distance relationship to a live-in one caused some friction between Song and Harris as the two began merging their lives. Harris nevertheless continued with his plans to move on with his life in a new city. He exchanged his California driver's license for a Washington- issued one. He was able to arrange a job interview for a position as a property appraiser, a job that would have meant much to him as it would have been the first time he held a skilled position unrelated to his athletic ability. Before that, however, he decided he needed to return to Alhambra and visit his mother and brother one more time. Song believes his intent was to talk with them and reach some closure for the difficult events of his childhood. \\"I think he realized some things and he wanted to talk to [his mother],\\" she later told a reporter. \\"He wanted her to trust him and trust us and believe in our relationship.\\" Lara spoke with him by phone during his drive to Southern California. He says Rico was upbeat, hoping to marry Song and start a family with her. \\"He seemed to have his head together,\\" he recalls. However, his visit with his family, on October 9, was brief. He took one of his brothers out to eat and gave him a new cell phone as a gift, then returned to his mother's home to speak with her alone privately. Fernandez does not believe her son got what he was hoping for out of the conversation. Shortly after midnight, he decided to return, taking with him a few more personal belongings. His job interview was scheduled for the next day in Seattle. Leaving Alhambra, he drove north on Interstate 5. Records show that he stopped in Lodi, south of Sacramento, to get gas. At 10:45 a.m. on October 10, he called Song from north of Sacramento and left a message saying that he was going \\"up into the mountains to rest\\", since he had not slept much since leaving Seattle. At 11:15 he turned the phone off. No one has heard from Harris or positively identified him since then. =Investigation= Song called Fernandez when Harris failed to return to Seattle when expected. Recalling that he had once disappeared for a few hours to San Diego, they decided to wait and see if he would return on his own. By October 14, several days after he had missed the job interview, they realized he was not going to do so, or that something had gone wrong, and reported him missing to the Alhambra police. That afternoon, a Yolo County deputy sheriff patrolling along a stretch of California State Route 16 along Cache Creek north of Rumsey saw a black Nissan Maxima sedan in a county park's lot for the second straight day. He looked inside and saw CDs, credit cards, and various papers scattered around. The car had not been reported stolen, so his superiors contacted the Alhambra police when they found out who it was registered to, and officers there informed Fernandez that it had been found, but not her son. A search of the surrounding terrain of Cache Creek Canyon began shortly afterward. Search and rescue teams began looking over the lightly forested terrain surrounding the stream. They were assisted by teams on all-terrain vehicles and helicopters. An airplane with a thermographic camera flew over the area, and search dogs were brought in as well. The area within a five-mile () radius of the parking lot was covered, as well as the of Route 16 through the canyon. But after three days, the searchers had found nothing. Many were incredulous. Rico at that time had reached his full adult height of , and weighed , reflecting the less active years since the end of his basketball career. They could not imagine how such a large person could have disappeared so completely. When Harris's description was circulated in the area, a few sightings subsequent to October 10 were reported. One passerby along Route 16 reported seeing a man who fit his description walking along the road at 5:30 on October 11, while another motorist believed he had seen him sitting on a guardrail overlooking the creek near the parking lot. Harris's car was towed away and searched. It was out of gas and the battery was nearly dead. Investigators found Harris's wallet and all of his credit cards save one, a Discover Card on which no charges have been made since Harris vanished. He had also taken his phone and driver's license. Detectives also found two plastic bottles, one mostly full of some type of hard liquor and the other empty but smelling strongly of the same beverage. On October 18, eight days after Harris's last voicemail message, another sighting was reported. A man who had driven past the parking lot where the Nissan had been told police he saw a large man wearing light-colored pants, similar to those Harris had been wearing when he left his mother's house, early that morning. The next day, a trail of fresh foot impressions, left by size 18 sneakers consistent with those Harris wore, were found leading from the parking lot to the creek near where the Nissan had been parked. Investigators were also able to find Harris's backpack, left by the side of the road about from the guardrail he was reported to have been sitting on the morning after his last phone call. In it they found his phone and charger and some other items not considered relevant to Harris's whereabouts. The phone contained pictures of the creek and some selfies, including one in which Harris was standing in front of a sign welcoming drivers to Yolo County striking a playful pose. There were also some videos, apparently taken unintentionally, showing Harris singing along to music playing in his car and casually flinging CDs around the passenger compartment. They were timestamped the night of October 10, demonstrating that Harris had been alive and in his car at that time. On October 22, the sheriff's office announced it was scaling back the search. Divers were called in to search the nearby sections of the creek in mid-November, but found nothing. The investigation is continuing. In 2016 the Investigation Discovery channel series Disappeared devoted a segment to the case. =Theories= Dean Nyland, the detective working the case for the sheriff's office, has ruled out the possibility of foul play in Harris's disappearance. The photos and video on Harris's phone suggest he came to Yolo County voluntarily and alone; no evidence of any kind of struggle was found in or near the car. His backpack and phone also do not show any signs that they were taken forcibly; Nyland believes Harris may have left them where they were found himself, either accidentally or purposely, to avoid being tracked via the phone. Nyland believes Harris may have made a wrong turn after getting gas and followed the road up into the hills of Yolo County. Seeing the parking lot, he may have decided to take a nap before driving further. When Harris woke up later that day, Nyland believes, the unresolved issues from his past came into play and he may have decided not to continue to Seattle just yet. \\"To him, this must have seemed like heaven\\", he said, showing a reporter the spot on the guardrail overlooking the creek where one driver reported seeing Harris the next morning. In the accidental videos on the phone, he adds, Harris seemed like \\"a free man\\". After wandering the area for a few days, including those in which he had been sought, he returned to his car and found it gone, Nyland believes. At that point he either walked away into the woods or towards another town. \\"We have no sightings, so he probably got a ride\\", the detective says.

Das Girl wird feine Dame: Frauendarstellungen in der späten Weimarer Republik. Seemann Henschel, Leipzig 2008, His work was part of the art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1932 Summer Olympics. He was named an Associate Professor in 1933, but he was dismissed when the Nazis came to power. His students protested, and he was eventually reinstated. This victory was short-lived, however. Those who took classes with him were likely not to graduate and, in 1937, some of his works were officially classified as \\"degenerate\\". In response, he painted \\"Plowman in the Evening\\" (1939), meant to depict the Nazi concept of Blood and Soil. Many of his works survived the war only because the Nazi government removed them from Berlin. He lost his studio to a bombing raid in 1943 and he was killed during another raid early the following year. One of his major works, a four-part fresco mural at the Bahlsen bakery in Hanover dating from 1917, was destroyed later in 1944.

Over the course of her career, she has done extensive work with fluorocarbons and actinides. She is currently a Fellow of the Materials Synthesis and Integrated Devices group in the Materials Physics and Applications Division of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Her current research interests are focused on the development of chemistry for the United States’ national defense and energy needs. Education Kiplinger received her B.S. degree in Chemistry from the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs in 1990. Under the guidance of Professor Ruminiski, Kiplinger has published several papers reporting coordination chemistry of iron and ruthenium featuring multidentate pyrazine-based ligands. Kiplinger did her graduate studies at the University of Utah working with Professor Thomas Richmond. Her work focused on using organometallic species to break carbon- fluorine bonds in perfluoroalkanes, which are usually unreactive due to fluorine’s high electronegativity and the strength of the carbon-fluorine bond. One notable publication in Organometallics displayed a novel transformation of an aromatic carbon-fluorine bond to a carbon-carbon bond using tungsten(II), shown below. Additionally, Kiplinger and Richmond reported zirconium complexes that catalyze aromatic fluorocarbon hydrogenolysis. From 1996-1999, Kiplinger worked as a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley under Professor Robert Bergman. Career After her postdoctoral stint, Kiplinger was awarded the Frederick Reines Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellowship at LANL. There, she started the program focused on the chemistry of actinides and lanthanides in the group lead by Dr. Carol Burns. In 2002, Kiplinger, Burns, and co-workers published the first f-block elemental complex containing a ketimido group. This was the first of many papers the group published pertaining to organometallic uranium chemistry. Soon after, Kiplinger and coworkers reported the first actinide hydrazonato complex using U(IV). During that time, Kiplinger also reported improved synthesis of uranium-based metallocene complexes (C5Me5)U(CH2C6H5)3. Kiplinger continued her research at LANL after the conclusion of her fellowship, and she serves as a laboratory Fellow in the chemistry division to this day. She continued developing lanthanide and actinide chemistry, and published the synthesis of the first uranium and thorium halide complexes with tert-butyl substituted ketiminate ligands in 2013. In 2016, Kiplinger reported the synthesis of an infinite thorium diazide coordination polymer; the first such polymer involving an actinide. The infinite property is unique to thorium azide complexes compared to other actinide metallocenes, such as uranium, which polymerize into trimers. By making alterations on the classic cyclopentadiene groups, different coordination polymers can be formed. (C5Me5)2Th(N3)2 utilizes pentamethylcyclopentadiene to form polymers with two bridging azide groups, while (C5Me4Et)2Th(μ-η1:η1-N3)(N3) uses ethyl-tetramethylcyclopentadiene caps to create a polymer with one bridging azide and one terminal azide group. Her recent efforts have been focused on the chemistry of uranium and thorium compounds with nitrogen-rich ligands. For example, experimental and theoretical work from her group revealed that tetrazolate ligands of these complexes act as sigma donors. Kiplinger Synthesis Thorium Metallocene Borohydride Another important thrust in her research involved the development of redox chemistry with uranium hydrides. She showed that phenylsilane can be used as a convenient stoichiometric reagent producing well-defined uranium (III), uranium (IV), and uranium (VI) complexes. Her more recent work details a new route to uranium and thorium metallocene borohydrides. The uranium complex had been synthesized previously from tetravalent uranium pentamethylborohydride and potassium cyclopentadiene, but the new synthesis using calcium borohydride and pentamethylcyclopentadienyl uranium chloride resulted in a higher yield under milder conditions. While the preparation of U(BH4)4 is dated to the seminal work of Schlesinger and Brown in 1940s, this is the first example of a thorium metallocene borohydride.

He is known as the frontman of Joel Fausto & Illusion Orchestra, formed in 2008. Also he is associated with his side acts Cajado, Gesso, Manos, Omitir and Forgotten Winter. Fausto's music is generally characterised by a frightening emotions through obsessions, fear, death, love, paranoia and surrealistic scenarios. Fausto has also worked as a composer for some short films, Déjà Vécu(2015) directed by André Leite e Péu Barbosa from Brazil and Berlin Hustle(2016) directed by Laurent Daniels from Germany. In 2015, one associated website of the famous TV Series Twin Peaks with the name \\"Welcome To Twin Peaks\\" compiled an Audrey Horne (Twin Peaks character) inspired playlist called \\"Isn't It Too Dreamy?\\" including Joel Fausto & Illusion Orchestra with names like Aphex Twin, Fleetwood Mac, Leonard Cohen, and others. Joel Fausto & Illusion Orchestra (2008 - present) Fausto formed his ghost band calling them \\"Illusion Orchestra\\" in 2008. Before that, the band had the name of \\"Vácuo do Outono\\". Their sound tends to change considerably from one album to another floating between Jazz, Dirty Blues, Experimental Rock, Soundscape or Dream Pop. \\"Meet Me In the Bottom\\" was the first self-released album in 2008. Title inspired by the Blues of Pink Anderson, \\"Meet Me In The Bottom\\" is about 40 minutes of some weird and dark background soundscape with experimental soundtrack and jazz elements. After that, an EP, called \\"Drawn For The End\\", was released in 2009. In 2013, the second album, \\"Illusion Orchestra At The Gloomy Club\\", was released by the Irish label Psychonavigation Records. Some story about a gloomy club that portrays an abstract and a dark background sound. \\"Illusion Orchestra At The Gloomy Club\\" was monthly presented in the \\"Late Night Sessions\\" show by the Irish radio RTÉ 2FM, \\"Past Haunts\\" show by KXRY XRAY.FM radio from Portland (US) and \\"Off The Cuff\\" show at WZBC 90.3FM radio from Boston (US). \\"(...)Joel Fausto & Illusion Orchestra goes for the incredible dark atmospheres. A noir vibe can be felt throughout the entire album. Tempos are kept deliberate. Elements of it go for a Western twang. Various instruments are employed, saxophone, vibraphone (heavily), guitar, and other electronic effects. Brought together they create the mixture of jazz with ambient influences. Many moments take quite a bit of time to fully bloom into full-fledged rhythms. Plenty of it is on the quieter side of things. Remaining sparse is highly important for these pieces. Instruments are able to fully breathe. Oftentimes the sheer amount of space can be somewhat worrisome.(...)\\" (\\"Beach Sloth Magazine\\", New York, USA). The third album \\"Hello\\" was released in 2016 by Slowdriver Productions. \\"Hello\\" is an intriguing and haunted story that put together Dream Pop with Dirty Blues and Experimental Rock. \\"(...)For me, \\"Hello\\" is one of the most atmospheric albums this year. It has darkness, gloom and mysteriousness – and yes, these are definitely the advantages! The album is well composed, it has its own rhythm, sometimes surprising, sudden tonal changes, Fausto’s vocal is deep and distinctive and it’s all ‘topped’ with unexpanded lyrics, that do not overwhelm the sound of music.(...)\\" (A.M. by \\"The Eye Of Music\\" Zine, Poland). Early years (2002-2007) 14 years old, Joel Fausto started to learn and practice guitar and some synthesizers by himself and did his first experimental compositions 1 year later. He explored the dark Soundscape style featuring Black Metal, recording a few lo-fi and harsh demo tapes and changing many times his pseudonyms. Later, he founded the band Omitir, Experimental Black Metal with Shoegaze and Jazz influences and entered as a second member of Forgotten Winter with the pseudonym \\"Trovador\\". Both bands are still active. Larva (2007 - 2008) In 2007, Joel Fausto formed an experimental / Noise Rock band named Larva with his friend Ruben Sequeira. They recorded many rehearsals with low quality by themselves in a small rehearsal room whose walls were covered in aluminium foil. Sounding noisy, loud, weird and aggressive, Portuguese label Perpetuam Records decided to release in 2008 a demo tape with the homonymous title \\"Larva\\" with those weird tracks. The band never played live and eventually disbanded. Cajado (2008 - present) Cajado (2015) Formed by two college friends in 2008, Daniel Catarino (Singer and songwriter) and Joel Fausto, Cajado was created in the middle of Alentejo (South of Portugal) with only two simple acoustic guitars. Years later, decided to pick some lost tracks they have been recording earlier and decided to make a deal with the Portuguese label Zigurartists to release in 2015 the first EP \\"Anta do Livramento\\", name of the small spot located in middle of nowhere at Alentejo where it all began. Cajado plays an Ambient Music Soundtrack, Soundscape with looped and dirty slide guitars and synthetizers with some western spaghetti influences. Their philosophy is \\"making music for those who move from the countryside to the city and feel homesick\\". First live appearance was in the Portuguese alternative music festival TRC Zigurfest in 2015 with other bands from the Portuguese music scene. Gesso (2011 - present) Maus Hábitos, Porto in 2014 In 2011, Fausto (Guitar) joined Ruben Sequeira (Drums) and Flávio SA (Bass) and formed a trio Psychedelic Rock / Stoner with 70's Blues Rock influences through the name Gesso. They have a traditional 70's sound with a compact drums, heavy bass and fuzzy delayed guitar. The first EP \\"Névoa Baixa, Sol Que Racha\\" was released in 2011 and two years later, in 2013, the debut album \\"Howling Grace\\". Joel Fausto performing with Gesso in 2014 \\"Lord is this some sweet psychedelia. The in-the-red recording and slightly blown-out production just adds to the insane bad ass shreddery and in your face riffage that threatens to melt it off from the time you hit play, until the final note explodes from the speakers into your decimated eardrums. The first thing that really caught me about Gesso’s debut full-length Howling Grace was the absolutely gnarled, distorted, fuzzy bass that crunched and trundled about, propelling the guitar work and tight drums into the stratosphere. The chest rumbling thunder of four-string sonic assault is aided by tight distorted guitar leads that thread in and out of the songs like a needle in some cosmic fabric of space and time, all interlocked with the perfectly apt drumming, occasional saxophone appearance and enough trippy space sounds to keep you floating out of body and mind the whole time. There's some pretty great acid jazz and space rock going on here, amidst dead ahead instrumental psych rock and some nice mid-tempo melodies that will have you slow-motion head banging within seconds. Gesso truly is the real deal.\\" (\\"It's Psychedelic Baby\\" Magazine) Manos (2015 - present) Fausto invited his sister, Andreia Figueiredo (Singer and Composer), and they formed Manos (=Brothers), a Psychedelic Rock and Post-Punk band influenced by 1980s New Wave with hallucination trips. They released an unexpected EP \\"Fui ao Céu e Voltei\\" in 2016 by Slowdriver Productions.

She previously played for Brisbane Roar and Perth Glory.  Early life and work Born in Harvey, Western Australia, a small town 140 km south of Perth, Marzano was raised in Townsville, a city on the northeastern coast of Queensland. She began playing soccer at the age of five. She attended military college in Canberra and later moved to Brisbane with the army. Marzano was the first woman to qualify as a combat engineer diver with the Australian Army. She is currently an officer in 5th Engineer Regiment (Australia). Playing career In 2014, Marzano contacted Perth Glory head coach Jamie Harnwell to try out for the W-League team. She was selected amongst 30 trialists to sign with the team for the 2014 W-League. With her 13 appearances and one goal, she helped lead the team to its first regular season title the same season with a record. Perth advanced to the semifinals where they defeated Sydney FC 3–0 with Marzano scoring in the second half after coming on as a substitute. The team faced Canberra United in the Grand Final but were defeated 3–1. Marzano signed with Brisbane Roar for the 2015–16 W-League season. She made 11 appearances and scored two goals helping the club finish fourth during the regular season with a record and advance to the playoffs.

Magil, (1905– January 2003), also known as Abraham B. Magil and \\"Abe\\" Magil, was a Yiddish-speaking, full-time Communist Party and \\"Marxist journalist and pamphleteer.\\" Background Abraham B. Magil was born in 1905 to a poor, Jewish, immigrant family in South Philadelphia. His father, Joseph Magil, was a Hebrew scholar; he had three older sisters. He won a scholarship to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he obtained a degree in journalism and was a Phi Beta Kappa Key. Career =Daily Worker (1926–1958)= May Day parade float with statue reading the Daily Worker In 1926, after graduating, he moved to New York City, where he joined the Communist Party (CPUSA) and went on staff at the Daily Worker, the Party's newspaper. In 1930, he traveled to Russia for the World Congress of Revolutionary Artists and Writers as Party eyes and ballast to non-Party delegates Harry Alan Potemkin and William Gropper. He returned through Berlin. During the Great Depression, the Party sent Magil to Detroit (1933–35) to found a state-wide edition of the Daily Worker. The local edition soon ran out of money, so Magil started to edit the Auto News for the Auto Workers Union, a left-led predecessor of the United Auto Workers. What that newspaper also ran out of money, Magil became local correspondent for the Daily Worker. During the 1930s and into the 1940s, he worked alongside Joe North at the head of the New Masses: Magil was a hardliner to counterbalance North. He wrote a poem on the death of Soviet poet Mayakovsky, which appeared along with other poetry in the 1938 Anthology of Proletarian Literature in the United States, edited by Granville Hicks. By 1948, when the magazine closed, he became the magazine's executive editor. Magil decided to take his family to live in Palestine. After initial refusal by the State Department (\\"not be in the interests of the United States\\") Magil obtained a passport. They lived six months there, during which time Israel declared its independence (May 5, 1948). He served as foreign correspondent for the Daily Worker and Yiddish-language Morgen Freiheit. Magil's cousin there, Matja Lessem, had married Dr. Willi Wolff, Israel's first minister of health. He covered the military action of the Palmach, a left-wing, special military unit of the Haganah and interviewed its commander, Yigdal Alon (later Israeli military chief of staff) and second in command Yitzhak Rabin (later Israeli prime minister. Upon their return to New York, he wrote the book Israel in Crisis (New York: International Publishers, 1949). During much of the 1950s (during McCarthyism), the Party asked Magil to move to Mexico with his family. Again, he worked there as foreign correspondent for the Daily Worker – and also \\"supplied Party leaders with information on the political situation both in the United States and in Mexico.\\" Mexican Communist he knew included: David Siqueiros, Diego Rivera, and Frida Kahlo, as well as visitors like Pablo Neruda, Juan Marinello, Carlos Raphael Rodriguez, and Hollywood Ten refugees Albert Maltz, Ring Lardner Jr., and Dalton Trumbo. He returned to the States at McCarthyism's peak, joined the Party's Administrative Committee, establish a National Peace Commission, and continued to write for the Daily Worker. He interviewed Guatemala's leader Jacobo Arbenz six months before the latter's overthrow. Returning to the States via Mexico, the FBI arrested him in Mexico illegally. Back in the States, he co-wrote the pamphlet \\"What Happened in Guatemala\\" with Helen Simon Travis. During 1955–1956, he was an editor of the quarterly Mainstream and its monthly successor Masses & Mainstream. In 1958, he became editor of the Sunday Worker and foreign editor of the Daily Worker. =Later life= In 1958, Magil took full-time work in medical journalism. He continued Party activity as a member of the editorial board of the progressive monthly Jewish Currents and was member in a Party club of writers led by Si Gerson. Magil left the Party with many others in 1992 in the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union and joined the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. In his last decade, he continued to champion the need to build democratic unity to defeat the far-right Republican Party. He also partook in a Marxist discussion group. Later interviews In his May 1952 memoir Witness, Whittaker Chambers (who time at the Daily Worker and perhaps the New Masses overlapped) wrote of \\"Abe Magill [sic] as \\"a solemn young Philadelphian, known, for his humorless pomposity, as the 'rabbi Magill'.\\" By October 1952, Magil took his an interview about Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss with Elinor Ferry, a Hiss supporter. This interview was used by later Hiss supporters including Meyer Zeligs (in his 1967 book ). Citing the interview in her 2013 book, Julia M. Allen quoted Magil as telling Ferry that Chambers' wife Esther Shemitz and her roommate Grace Lumpkin \\"appeared to be Lesbians. Esther was masculine in appearance and in her voice. Grace was the softer, more feminine type.\\" In 1976, Magil corresponded with literary scholar Alan M. Wald. In 1989–1990, he gave interviews to Alan Wald regarding Party literary activities at the New Masses. Personal and death He was known as \\"Abe\\" and Abraham. Around 1940, Magil married Harriet Black, a psychiatric social worker who had been National Treasurer of the American Women's Congress; they stayed married 62 years until Harriet’s death in October 2002. They had one child, Maggie, and one granddaughter, Kate. In 1994 he and his wife moved to Arlington, VA to be closer to family but he continued to travel to New York City to attend his Marxist discussion group up until a few months before his death.

Biography George Frederick Cherry was born in 1761 in Gillingham, Kent, the first-born of Susan Cherry (née Curtis) and George Cherry (who in 1785 became chairman of the Victualling Board) in a family of ten children. He married Martha Maria Paul (1765-1819). Their only son, George Henry Cherry (1793-1848) was Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Dunwich from 1820-1826. He was the British Resident at Lucknow until 1796, immediately prior to the period in which Wazir Ali Khan was removed as Nawab of Awadh by the British and replaced by Saadat Ali Khan II. The role of a resident extended to intelligence gathering, and at this, in the relative turbulence of late 18th century Awadh, Cherry excelled, running a network of spies and informers - such as Mirza Abu Taleb Khan, who wrote about some of his interactions with the East India Company. =Massacre of Benares= He had made sufficient enemies in Lucknow by 1796 that he was relocated to Benares, considered a less exposed town, to act as political- agent to the Governor General. In 1797 Wazir Ali Khan was deposed and required by the British to live in Benares with a pension. The young Ali - only 19 - was far from satisfied with his lot, and indications before 1799, and evidence of later enquiries suggests he was plotting against the British and with a view to regaining his lost position. By 1799, the British had come to the conclusion that Ali should be required to live in Calcutta - further from his power-base, and much more obviously under the eye of the British. It fell to Cherry to impart this news. Ali appears to have been informed of his fate in the early part of January 1799, and his remonstrances fell on deaf ears. Appearing to acquiesce to the situation, he gave it out that he would relocate on the 15 or 16 January. On 13 January Cherry was informed that Ali would visit him the following morning, and on the 14th Ali appeared at breakfast time, leading a more-or-less normal 200-strong entourage. Cherry escorted Khan and four supporters into his house. Ali took the opportunity to complain loudly about his lot, to assert promises broken by the British, and to blame Cherry for failing to look after his interests. Then, in what looked like a choreographed movement, an associate, Waris Ali, restrained the sitting Cherry from behind his seat, Wazir Ali Khan struck Cherry with his sword, and Cherry was further struck by others of Ali's party. Cherry managed to struggle out of the house, but was quickly killed. Two of Cherry's colleagues were also killed: his secretary, Mr. Evans, was stabbed, escaped outside, and was shot whilst seeking to flee; and a Captain Conway, residing with Cherry, was also killed. Two other British residents of Benares were also killed, in what came to be known as the Massacre of Beneres. Ali fled, evading capture for some months, but was eventually turned over to the British authorities by Pratap Singh of Jaipur, Rajah of Jaipur, on condition Ali was not executed nor fettered. Ali was imprisoned for the remainder of his life.

It has rough, tessellated bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and urn-shaped fruit. Description Corymbia nesophila is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous, greyish brown, tessellated to crumbly bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull green leaves that are paler on the lower surface, mostly heart-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are glossy green, slightly paler on the lower surface, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum with a small point in the centre. Flowering occurs between May and August and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is an urn-shaped capsule with thin walls and the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming The Melville Island bloodwood was first described in 1934 by William Blakely who gave it the name Eucalyptus nesophila and published the description in his book A Key to the Eucalypts. In 1995, Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia nesophila. Distribution and habitat Corymbia nesophila has a disjunct distribution throughout the tropical north of Australia and is common in the east Kimberley region of Western Australia, the top end and islands off the coast of the Northern Territory and on the Cape York Peninsula of Queensland.

She was awarded her undergraduate degree by the National School of Anthropology and History and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), from which she then obtained her master's degree in Anthropological Sciences. After 1980 she was the head of the Underwater Archeology Area of the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) of Mexico. She was a member, among other associations, of the Consultative Council of Cultural Heritage Underwater of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), as well as member emeritus of the Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology Society for Historical Archaeology and International Grant Advisor for the National Geographic Society. She was the first Latin American woman and only the second underwater archaeologist to receive the J. C. Harrington Medal and is considered the pioneer of aquatic archaeology in Mexico. Early life María del Pilar Luna Erreguerena was born in 1944 in Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico. Her father had immigrated to Mexico from Sahagún of the Tierra de Campos district of Spain and worked his way up to owning a jewelry store. Luna was the youngest of five children. When she was six, her family moved to Mexico City and by the age of eight, she had completed lifeguard training with the Red Cross. Career Luna began her career working as a secretary in the family business and then worked as a teacher in a sport center. She spent twelve years teaching children with disabilities how to swim. At the age of 27, while still working as a swimming instructor, she decided to return to school. Originally an anthropology major, Luna, who was taking classes at the National Institute of Anthropology and History () took a class on general archaeology given by the National Museum of Anthropology. In a lecture about the Abu Simbel temples, re-discovered during the construction of the Aswan Dam, she began to question the fate of Mexico's underwater legacy. Searching for information, Luna discovered the book, Archaeology Under Water, by George F. Bass and decided she wanted to become an aquatic archaeologist. Then near the end of her studies, Luna, who had gone to a cave to study some chultuns near Acapulco, contracted histoplasmosis. Her recovery was a slow process, which took more than a year. When, due to the histoplasmosis, she was barred from underwater activities, Luna began working at the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan, where the disk of Coyolxauhqui had just been found. She was approached by Manuel Gandara, head of the National Institute of Anthropology and History () to organize a course on undersea archaeology. She contacted Bass to help with lectures and curricula and he agreed to come with one of his students, Donald H. Keith. As part of the course, students excavated at Media Luna, a spring in San Luis Potosí, discovering 20,000-year-old mammoth skulls. At the end of the course, Bass asked her to accompany him on a dive to explore the Turkish Mediterranean. Receiving clearance from her doctor, Luna agreed to the trip, which included dives on a boat from the Byzantine period and a Greek boat dating to the Christian era. In 1978, immediately upon her return from Turkey, Luna got a message from Keith, who was working at the Institute of Nautical Archaeology in Texas. He alerted her that sports divers had located some guns in the Gulf of Mexico. The tip led to the recovery of two cannon and a bronze plate that were dated to 1552 and later, were housed in the Museo de San José el Alto, in Campeche. Shortly thereafter, Luna first heard of the shipwreck Nuestra Señora del Juncal, when Burt Webber, a diver and treasure hunter who had made other finds in the Caribbean, applied for a permit to recover relics. After an 18-month battle, Mexico refused to offer permits to commercial enterprises, and in February 1980, Luna founded the Division of Underwater Archaeology () under the direction of INAH. She is considered the founder of underwater archaeology in Latin America. In 1990, a team of subaquatic archaeologists, including U.S. researchers James P. Delgado and Larry Nordby, worked with Luna to excavate the wreck of the USS Somers, which had been discovered in 1986 by George Belcher. Belcher had been hired to look in the coastal waters of Veracruz for artifacts for a new state museum in Xalapa. Upon locating the vessel, Belcher reported the find to the National Park Service, because of its significance in U.S. history for the \\"Somers Affair\\", upon which Herman Melville based his novella, Billy Budd. The venture was one of the few undersea archaeological projects jointly conducted by two governments. The team confirmed the ship identity, which had sunk during the Mexican–American War, and documented numerous intact features in their bilateral inspection of the wreck, which has since become a protected site. Soon after, Luna gained wide notice for standing up to the treasure hunters working for Odyssey Marine Exploration. Odyssey executives tried many methods of influence to gain a foothold into Mexican waters, and while Luna considered resigning, she held firm in her refusal to allow commercial excavation. Recognizing that having the site designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site would help protect it, in 1995, Luna drafted a proposal to protect the entire Fleet of New Spain from 1630 to 1631. With help from archivists in Spain and fishermen, Luna began researching the entire fleet, recognizing that there had to be more losses than just the flagship. They were able to tag many wrecks without the use of modern technology, although only a few were from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Luna was involved in many projects, including the Manila Galleon off the coast of Baja California, Nevado de Toluca near Edomex's coastline, and Banco Chinchorro of Quintana Roo. She has spearheaded an atlas and registry for the study and preservation of the caves and cenotes of the Yucatán Peninsula, working on projects to conserve and protect Mexico's underwater and submerged heritage. Luna worked with UNESCO in the development of the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage, which was adopted in 2001 and signed the same year by Mexico. The treaty was ratified in 2005 and entered into force in 2009. In 2014, Mexico and Spain signed a collaboration agreement to jointly develop their undersea heritage, the first two countries to sign such an agreement, and one of the few in which a colony and colonizer have worked together to preserve their shared cultural patrimony. Luna was hopeful that the agreement might finally lead to the location and excavation of the Juncal. Recognition and honors Luna was the first Latin American to receive the J. C. Harrington Award from the Society for Historical Archaeology, in 2011, only the fourth woman from throughout the world, and second aquatic archaeologist (the other was her mentor Bass), to be so honored. In 2016, Luna was awarded the Research Prize of the for her work in studying and preserving submerged cultural heritage. The award was presented at the Mutua Madrileña auditorium in Madrid in March. That same year, she was honored with Toni Carrell, Dolores Elkin, and Margaret Leshikar-Denton receiving the Society for Historical Archaeology's Award of Merit. The award, given in conjunction with the Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology, recognized the four women for their role in the ratification and implementation of the UNESCO Convention for underwater archaeology. Death Luna died 15 March 2020 in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.

It is a legendary biography of the 13th century Chahamana king Hammira. While not entirely accurate from a historical point-of-view, the text provides valuable information about the medieval history of north-western India. Much of the text describes Hammira's ancestry and his conquests of the neighbouring Hindu kingdoms. The last third part describes his conflict with Ala-ud-Din Khalji, the Sultan of Delhi. The text attributes Hammira's defeat against Ala-ud-Din to betrayal by his officers.  Authorship and date  Hammira Mahakavya was composed by the Jain scholar Nayachandra Suri. The author was not a contemporary of Hammira, the hero of the text. The date and place of the text's origin are not certain. According to Cynthia Talbot, it was probably composed around 1400 CE, possibly to please a Chauhan (Chahamana) ruler. Nayachandra states that he was inspired to write the poem because the courtiers of the Tomara king Virama declared that no contemporary poet could compose a poem comparable with the ones written by the ancient poets. Nayachandra composed Hammira Mahakavya as a challenge. Based on this, Phyllis Granoff theorizes that the poem was written at the Tomara court, around 1420 CE, or over 100 years after the death of Hammira in 1301. Nayachandra's disciple Nayahamsa made a copy of the manuscript in 1496 CE, which was used by N. J. Kirtane to produce an editio princeps. Nayahamsa also added an appendix, which praises Nayachandra Suri and his spiritual lineage. Nayahamsa had copied the manuscript at Firuzpur, a town whose modern location is uncertain. Kirtane received the manuscript from a person of Nashik, who had received it from someone else.  Content  The text is divided into fourteen cantos. The poem begins with an invocation to Hindu deities and Jain tirthankaras. It then describes the life Hammira, who is compared to the legendary heroes Mandhata, Yudhishthira and Rama. Cantos 1-4 are devoted to Hammira's ancestors, including kings from the Shakambhari Chahamana dynasty. Cantos 5-7 describe Hammira's engagement in various services, sports and festivities. The information contain in this part is of little historical value. The next few cantos describe his reign. The last third part of the text describes Hammira's conflict with Ala-ud-Din Khalji, the Muslim Sultan of Delhi. = Hammira's ancestors = The text gives the following line of succession of the Chahamana kings, which does not match exactly with the historical genealogy of the dynasty: Much of the information about these ancestors is fanciful in nature. For example, the dynasty's mythical progenitor Chahamana (or Chohan) is described as follows: Once Brahma wandered in search of a holy place for a sacrifice. The lotus held in has hand fell at a spot that later came to be known as Pushkar. Brahma decided to conduct a sacrifice at that place, and invoked Surya (the sun) to protect his sacrfice from the danavas (demons). A hero then sprung from the orb of the sun, and protected Brahma's sacrifice. With Brahma's blessings, this hero became a powerful king. Even the description of Hammira's historical ancestors does not provide much information of historical value. For example, Chandraraja is described as follows: The description of the events from the death of Prithviraja III to the reign of Hammira is fairly historical, but still not entirely accurate. = Legend of Prithviraja III = A statue of Prithviraja III The text describes Prithviraja III's war against Muhammad of Ghor (Shahb-ud-Din) as follows: During the just rule of Prithviraja in the East, the Muslim king Shahab-ud-Din began attempts to subjugate the earth. The kings of the West, led by one Chandraraja, appealed Prithviraja to counter Shahab-ud-Din. Chandraraja told Prithviraja that Shahab-ud-Din had set up his capital at Multan, and had defeated the noblest of the Hindu Rajput kings. The invader had burned their cities, dishonoured their women and reduced them to a sorry state. Chandraraja compared Shahab-ud-Din to Parashurama, who had come to exterminate the warrior caste from the earth. On hearing this, Prithviraja became angry, and declared that he would force Shahab-ud-Din to beg them for an apology on his knees. After some days, he marched towards Multan and entered Shahab-ud-Din's territory. When the enemy king came to know about this, he also set out from Multan, with an army. In the ensuing battle, Prithviraja defeated and captured Shahab-ud-Din. The Muslim king was made to bend on his knees, and seek forgiveness from the Rajput kings he had harassed. Subsequently, Prithviraja presented expensive gifts to all the kings (including Shahab-ud-Din), and asked them to return home. Despite being well- treated after his defeat, Shahab-ud-Din felt humiliated and sought revenge. He invaded Prithviraja's kingdom seven more times, but each time, he was defeated. Finally, he decided to seek help from the king of the Ghataika country. From this king, he obtained a large infantry and cavalry, and captured Delhi. When Prithviraja heard about this, he had only a small force stationed at his capital Ajmer. He asked his general Udayaraja to gather a larger army, and immediately set out against Shahab-ud-Din with the small force. Although Prithviraja's contingent was small, Shahab-ud-Din was terrified at this news. At night, he sent some men to Prithviraja's camp and bribed the cavalry chief and the royal musicians. The next morning, Shahab-ud- Din sent a force to attack Prithviraja's camp. Prithviraja asked his men to prepare for war. The disloyal cavalry chief presented him a dancing horse named Natyarambha. As soon as the king mounted this horse, the disloyal musicians started playing music. The horse started dancing to the music, and this performance diverted the king's attention. Meanwhile, the Muslim soldiers managed to kill a number of Rajputs. Prithviraja finally came to his senses, dismounted from the horse, and killed a number of attackers. But then he fell to the ground after an enemy soldier attacked him from behind.He was taken captive just as Udayaraja arrived with a larger army. Fearing Udayaraja's army, Shahab-ud-Din retreated to Delhi but took the captive Prithviraja with him. Udayaraja besieged Yoginipura (Delhi) for a month, in a bid to rescue Prithviraja. After being captured, Prithviraja refused to eat any food. One of Shahab-ud-Din's advisors remarked that he should release Prithviraja, who had released the Muslim king with honour in past. Shahab-ud-Din became angry at this suggestion, and ordered Prithviraja to be imprisoned in the fortress. Prithviraja died after a few days. When Udayaraja heard about this, he led his entire army to a decisive battle, in which he was defeated and killed. Prithviraja was succeeded by Hariraja. The new king spent most of his time in company of female dancers, who had been presented to him by the king of Gujarat. Hariraja squandered the state's revenues on dancers and musicians, even as the state's employees were not paid their salaries. Shahab-ud-Din took advantage of these circumstances, and invaded Hariraja's kingdom. Hariraja, who was not prepared for a fight, chose to die by self-immolation (sak), along with his family members. = Legend of the Ranthambore branch = Ranthambore Fort Govindaraja had established a new kingdom with its capital at Ranathambore, after being banished by his father. Following Hariraja's defeat, several of Ajmer's officials sought his asylum. Govindaraja treated them well, and appointed them to suitable offices. After Govindaraja's death, Balhana ascended the throne. Before his death, Balhana appointed his elder son Prahlada as the new king, and his younger son Vagabhata as the prime minister. Prahlada once killed a lion during a hunting expedition. As his party celebrated the killing, another lion severely injured him. On his deathbed, Vagabhata promised to serve his son Viranarayana faithfully. When Viranarayana became an adult, his marriage was arranged to the Kachhavaha princess of Jayapura. He set out for the Kachhavaha capital Amarapur for the marriage ceremony, but was forced to retreat because of a surprise attack by the Delhi Sultan Jalal-ud-din. Unable to defeat Viranarayana in the battle, Jalal-ud-Din made a plan to subdue him using deceitful means. He sent a flattering message to Viranarayana, stating that he was greatly impressed by his bravery, and wanted to be friends. Viranarayana believed that a friendship with the Delhi Sultan would help him against his rival, Vigraha of Vakshasthalapura. He, therefore, accepted the Jalal-ud-Din's invitation to Delhi. Vagabhata advised him against this move, but the king insultingly rejected his advice. A dejected Vagabhata left for Malwa. Other courtiers also advised Viranarayana against accepting Jalal-ud-din's friendship, but the king didn't heed their advice. He went to Delhi, where he was received warmly, but ended up being poisoned after a few days. Jalal-ud-Din then captured Ranthambore, and sent a message to the king of Malwa ordering him to kill Vagabhata. But Vagabhata came to know about this, and killed the king of Malwa. He then gathered an army of Rajputs, and formed an alliance with the Kharpuras, who had rebelled against the Delhi Sultanate. With this army, he recaptured Ranthambore. He safeguarded the kingdom by placing large forces at the various frontier posts, and died after a reign of 12 years. Vagabhata was succeeded by Jaitrasingh. He fulfilled the desire of his pregnant queen Hira Devi to \\"bathe herself in the blood of the Muslims\\". When her son Hammira was born, the astrologers predicted that he would drench the earth with the blood of his Muslim enemies. Hammira grew up to be a handsome man, and his father arranged his marriage to 7 beautiful women. In 1283 CE, Jaitrasingh appointed Hammira as his successor, and retired to forest. = Hammira's early reign = Hammira's palace at the Ranthambore Fort Soon after becoming the king, Hammira waged wars to expand his kingdom. First, he subdued Arjuna, the king of Saraspura. Next, he forced the ruler of Gadhamandala to pay him a tribute. After this, he marched to Malwa, where he defeated Bhoja II. His army marched in a victory procession at Ujjain, where he prayed to Mahakala. On the way back to Ranthambore, he marched to Chitrakuta (Chittor), and sacked Medapata (modern Mewar). Subsequently, Hammira stayed for some days at the ashram of sage Vasishtha. Although he followed the religion of the Vedas, he also prayed at the temple of the Jain tirthankara Rishabhadeva. Hammira then marched to Abu. The king of Abu was a great warrior, but chose to accept Hammira's suzerainty. After leaving Abu, Hammira plundered Varddhanapura and Changa. He then proceeded to Pushkar via Ajmer. At Pushkar, he worshipped Adivaraha and then marched to Shakambhari. During this journey, he plundered multiple towns including Marhata, Khandilla, Chamda and Kankroli. He then returned to his capital, Ranthmabore. Some days later, Hammira's spiritual guide Vishvarupa informed him that one could gain entry into heaven by performing the Koti-yajna sacrifice. Hammira performed this sacrifice in accordance with the shastras. He invited Brahmins from all over the country, and made generous donations to them. He also engaged in the month-long Munivrata observance. = Hammira's conflict with Ala-ud-Din Khalji = Meanwhile, Ala-ud-Din Khalji had ascended the throne of Delhi. In third year of Ala-ud-Din's reign, his \\"Mongol\\" (also called Mughal or Mudgal) noblemen rebelled against him, and were given asylum by Hammira in the Ranthambore Fort. He sent his younger brother Ulugh Khan to sack Ranthambore, because unlike Jaitrasingh, Hammira did not pay any tribute to the Delhi Sultanate. Ulugh Khan's army entered Hammira's territory, but could not march to Ranthambore because his cavalry could not cross the Varnanasha river. Ulugh Khan encamped on the banks of the river, burning and destroying several nearby villages. Hammira was still engaged in the Munivrata observance, and therefore could not personally lead an army against Ulugh Khan. He sent his generals Bhimasingh and Dharmasingh to counter the Delhi army. In the ensuing battle, Ulugh Khan suffered a defeat, and lost several of his soldiers. When Bhimasingh started marching back to Ranthambore, Ulugh Khan secretly followed him with a large army. Bhimasingh's soldiers had captured a large amount of wealth in the battle, and had marched ahead to carry it safely to Ranthambore. Bhimasingh was left with a small number of men. Ulugh Khan attacked this small detachment, killed Bhimasingh, and then returned to Delhi. In Ranthambore, Hammira had finished his sacrifice by the time he learned about Bhimasingh's death. He ordered Dharmasingh to be blinded and castrated for deserting Bhimasingh. Dharmasingh decided to avenge his humiliation, and befriended a courtesan named Radha Devi, who told him about all the happenings at the royal court. One day, Radha Devi told him that many of Hammira's horses had died of a disease. He communicated to the king through Radha Devi that he would present the king with many horses if restored to his former post. The king agreed, and Dharmasingh gradually gained his confidence by filling the royal treasury with wealth confiscated from the citizens. This made the citizens detest Hammira. The king's brother Bhoja tried to warn him against Dharmasingh's activities, but the king was very pleased with Dharmasingh's revenue generation, and entrusted full powers to Dharmasingh. Dejected, Bhoja and his younger brother Pitama decided to leave the kingdom. They told Hammira that they were leaving for Varanasi. But after departing from Hammira's court, they went to Yoginipura (Delhi) and started serving Ala-ud-Din. At his instigation, Ala-ud-Din ordered Ulugh Khan to invade Hammira's kingdom with a 100,000-horse cavalry. Hammira ordered his eight generals to attack the invading army from eight directions. The Delhi army was defeated and forced to flee the battlefield. After Hammira's victory celebrations were over, his Mongol chiefs sought his permission to punish Bhoja. The request was granted, and the Mongol chief Mahimashahi raided Jagara, where he captured Pitama. Ulugh Khan and Bhoja implored Ala-ud-Din Khalji to punish Hammira. The Delhi Sultan then raised an army by seeking forces from other rulers. These included the kings of Anga, Telanga, Magadha, Maisur, Kalinga, Banga, Bhot, Medapata, Panchal, Bangal, Thamim, Bhilla, Nepal, Dahal and the Himalayan foothills. These kings agreed to contribute to Ala-ud-Din's campaign for different reasons, including their love for war, the prospect of plunder, or simply the desire to watch a battle. Ala-ud-Din dispatched a massive army to Ranthambore, led by his brother Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan. The army was so large that its horses drank up all the waters of rivers on the way. Ala-ud-Din himself stayed behind with a reserve force. After reaching a difficult mountain pass on the borders of the enemy territory, Ulugh Khan advised Nusrat not to rely solely on a more powerful army. He made a plan to cross this mountain pass without being attacked. In accordance with this plan, Ulugh and Nusrat sent Molhana Deva to negotiate a peace treaty with Hammira. While the negotiations were pending, Hammira's forces allowed the invading army to cross the mountain pass without being attacked. Hammira's camp believed that they had trapped their rivals into their territory, while the Delhi forces believed that they had managed to secure an advantageous position in the enemy territory. Meanwhile, in Hammira's court, Molhana Deva told Hammira that he will to have accept one of the following conditions in order to conclude a peace treaty with Ala-ud- Din Khalji: * Pay a tribute of 100,000 gold coins, 4 elephants and 300 horses. Marry Hammira's daughter to Ala-ud-Din. * Surrender the four rebel Mongol chiefs to Ala-ud-Din. Hammira rejected the conditions, leading to a battle. Nusrat Khan was killed in this battle. Ulugh Khan had to abandon the attack at the onset of the monsoon rains. He retreated to some distance from Ranthambore, and sent a message to Ala-ud-Din asking for help, along with Nusrat's dead body. Ala-ud-Din then himself led a force to Ranthambore, and besieged the fort. After two days of unsuccessfully trying to capture the fort, he sent a message to Hammira, praising the Chahamana king's bravery and promising to grant his any wish. Hammira replied that he wished to fight with Ala-ud-Din for two days. In the ensuing battle, the invading army lost around 85,000 men. Subsequently, both the parties agreed to a temporary ceasefire. During the truce, Hammira's courtesan Radha Devi once performed a dance on a wall of the fort. She purposely turned her back towards Ala-ud-Din Khalji, who was encamped near the fort. Angry at her conduct, Ala-ud-Din asked for someone who could kill the dancer with an arrow. One of his subordinate chiefs told him that only a captive named Uddanasingh was capable of this. Ala-ud-Din ordered the release of Uddanasingh, who killed Radha Devi with an arrow. In response, Hammira's Mongol chief Mahimashahi killed Uddanasingh with same arrow. = Hammira's defeat and death = Mahimashahi's feat of archery greatly intimidated Ala-ud-Din, who moved his camp from the eastern side of the fort to the safer western side. When this happened, the Chahamanas realized that Ala-ud-Din's soldiers had been constructing a tunnel to the fort. They used cannon fire to kill these underground workers and destroy their work. Ala-ud-Din faced further trouble, when a group of rams ransacked his camp. Frustrated, Ala-ud-Din asked Hammira to send the Chahamana general Ratipala to conclude a peace treaty. Hammira sent Ratipala to hear Ala-ud- Din's offer, but this irked another Chahamana general Ranamalla, who was unhappy about not being chosen to visit Ala-ud-Din. When Ratipala came to Ala- ud-Din's camp, he was received with great honour. The Delhi Sultan presented him gifts, took him to his harem, and let him eat and drink in private with the Sultan's sister. Ala-ud-Din then promised to make Ratipala the governor of Ranthambore in return for his help in conquering the fort. Ratnapala agreed to Ala-ud-Din's proposal to betray Hammira. Upon returning to the fort, he greatly exaggerated the strength of Ala-ud-Din's army. He then told Hammira that Ranamalla was angry with the king, and recommended that Hammira talk to him in the private to ensure his support against Ala-ud-Din. Next, Ratipala approached Ranamalla, and told him that Hammira was angry with him, and planned to imprison him that night. Ratipala advised Ranamalla to escape the fort and seek shelter with Ala-ud-Din. Ratipala also spread a rumor among the queens that Ala-ud-Din's only condition for peace was marrying Hammira's daughter. Hammira's queens convinced his daughter to agree to the marriage, but Hammira rejected this proposal. Hammira's brother Virama warned the king that Ratipala seemed drunk, and therefore, should not be believed. Virama recommended that the king order Ratipala's killing, but Hammira dismissed his concerns. Hammira argued that the fort was strong enough to resist the enemy attack, and expressed concern that if Ratipala was innocent, his killing would demoralize others. Hammira then decided to visit Ranamalla to seek his support, as advised by Ratipala. When Ranamalla heard about the king's visit, he thought that the king was coming to imprison him. He and his men left immediately, and sought shelter with Ala-ud-Din. Soon after, Ratipala also joined him. Hammira now decided to prepare for a battle. He asked his Kothari (store-keeper) about the status of the fort's granary. The granary had run out of foodgrains. But the Kothari, fearing for his job, told the king that there were enough foodgrains for a prolonged siege. Nevertheless, the king came to know the truth soon, and ordered the killing of the Kothari. Disturbed by the events of the day, especially the betrayals by his own men, Hammira could not sleep at night. The next day, Hammira's men prepared for a final war, determined to fight to death. Hammira offered his loyal Mongol chief Mahimashahi the option to leave, as he did not want a foreigner dying for him. But Mahimashahi readied for the battle, and killed all the female members of his family. Hammira's queens and daughters, led by Ranga Devi, also committed suicide by self-immolation to avoid being captured by the enemy soldiers. After performing a funeral ceremony for the deceased, Hammira and his loyal men attacked Ala-ud-Din's camp. A deadly battle ensued, in which Hammira's loyal generals died one by one: Virama, Mahimashahi, Jaja, Gangadhar Tak, and Kshetrasingh Paramara. Finally, Hammira also fell, pierced by a hundred arrows. This event happened during the 18th year of his reign, in the Shravana month.  Historical reliability  Hammira Mahakavya does not provide a satisfactorily correct genealogy of the Chahamana kings. Nilkanth Janardan Kirtane, who translated the text into English in 1899, dismisses the text's description of the early Chahamana kings as \\"filled with fanciful conceptions\\", aimed at providing the author an opportunity to showcase \\"his power for poetical conceits.\\" According to him, the text is \\"fairly historic\\" in its description of the kings from Prithviraja III to Hammira, but even in this portion, the author sometimes \\"relapses into rhapsody which amounts to a confession of his ignorance of the historical facts.\\" Historian Asoke Kumar Majumdar agrees with Kirtane's assessment, and describes certain parts of the text as \\"very unreliable\\", specifically the portion which claims that Vigraharaja II killed Mularaja and conquered Gujarat. Historian R. B. Singh of Gorakhpur University notes that as a source for the history of the Chahamanas, Hammira Mahakavya is less reliable than Prithviraja Vijaya, as the former was composed two centuries later.

The match took place at Earls Court Arena, London, England on August 6, 1966. It was scheduled for fifteen rounds. The match ended in the third round with Ali defeating London by KO. The fight Ali at 24 years old put on a masterful performance against a clearly out- classed 32 year old opponent, with Ali having the advantages of height, weight, reach and youth on his side, almost hitting London at will as the fight went on. As London put it in an interview with the BBC: \\"he was just getting through all the time\\". Ali bouncingly circled continually, whilst London tracked doggedly after him for the first two rounds seemingly with a strategy of trying to land a single knock-out punch to the American champion. London succeeded in landing only one blow in the match, a left jab to Ali's jaw midway through the 1st Round which caught Ali by surprise and left him for a moment stunned (and wide-open for a follow through right cross, which London failed to take advantage of), but the blow lacked weight and Ali was able to quickly recover. On coming out for the 3rd Round London displayed a patent degree of hesitation to come forward to engage, and Ali sensing this advanced to the attack flashly, penning him back into a corner and throwing a 12-punch combination in 3 seconds in a showboating display of speed and athleticism, but with a suspicion of Ali holding back, with few of the blows actually connecting or possessing weight behind them, and the one blow that did (the 10th) being just enough to knock London down and end the fight.'Muhammad Ali vs Brian London full fight', published on Youtube 18 January 2009. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWnt4Z2Z9N0 In a post-career media interview London described his contest with Ali in stark terms, describing Ali as being:- > \\"Big, fast and he could punch, whereas I was smaller, fatter and couldn't > punch.

She had intended to join the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRENS) but her application had taken too long to process, so she joined the WAAF alongside some friends. She was in fact too short to qualify for military service but the man measuring her added half an inch to her height to meet the minimum required. Describing the situation, she stated \\"I probably should never have got in\\". Her first posting as an aircraftwoman was as an equipment assistant at stores of RAF Farnborough where she issued \\"anything from pants to revolvers\\". She failed her first officer selection board because she was too young. Having attended the WAAF's first NCO training course in June 1940, she was promoted to corporal. She then served as a new entrant instructor at RAF West Drayton, and then in Harrogate when the training school moved there due to the London Blitz. Having passed the officer board on her second attempt, Hill attended the WAAF's Officer Training School in Bulstrode Park, Buckingham. On 18 December 1940, she was commissioned as an assistant section officer (equivalent in rank to a pilot officer). In 1941, she served at RAF Wyton where her duties included interviewing applicants to the WAAF; among those she interviewed was Sarah Churchill, a daughter of then- Prime Minister Winston Churchill. From 1942 to 1943, she served at the WAAF Directorate. On 1 February 1942, she was promoted to (temporary) section officer (equivalent in rank to a flying officer).

Its world premiere was held at the San Francisco Playhouse in San Francisco, California in 2016. The production was directed by Margarett Perry, with Brian Dykstra in the leading role. Plot The play is set in the kitchen of a struggling restaurant, as the protagonist Harry meets a clash of wills in this drama of ideology versus money with his brother. Harry is chef who takes great pride in his cooking, working at a restaurant that is finally starting to see some success. When his business partner Mike brings in an outside consultant to help with the business, Harry finds the change more than he can handle. Critical reception Seared got positive reviews as the San Francisco Chronicle called it 'culinary drama done to perfection', praising the director and cast performance. Mercury News had reviewed the play as being 'packed with clever dialogue...and a genuine love of food'. Their critic said that the play was much simpler in plot than Rebeck's other work, with no secrets or plot twists and no attempt to show the characters' lives outside work, despite clever dialog about the nature of authenticity and tension about whether the chef Harry will agree to changes. Theatre Dogs gave it a glowing review, saying that \\"Seared turns out to be not unlike the dishes its chef creates: artfully made, crafted with the best possible ingredients and served with confident flair.

The film is directed by Andrew Bush, and produced by Michael Goldfine. The film was released on September 23, 2016. Plot Kate Fields (Mamrie Hart) is a dentist assistant whose job is a bit middling, while her love life has resulted in either meeting people like Richard (Adam Lustick) on blind dates, or just staying at home alone most nights. Evie Jones (Grace Helbig) is married to Todd Jones (Andy Ridings), and both live with his parents (Betsy Randle, John Hayden), none of them respecting her, and forcing her to attend one charitable cause after another with them that suits their interests, but not hers. Charlie (Hannah Hart) is in a relationship with the girl of her dreams, Claire (Kelen Coleman), whom she wants to marry; but just can't seem to pull her business or her act together, despite her promise to Claire to do so. When the three arrive at Kate's apartment for Taco Tuesday, they reveal that their old high school letters to their future selves was mailed to them. Kate reads her about having a great job, being married, and having a child, none of which has come true for her, making her feel depressed. As her 30th birthday approaches, Charlie and Evie decide to throw Kate a party, inviting all of their old friends from high school, and using the home of Evie's husband's parents as Todd and his parents will be gone. As Evie and Charlie set up everything, Evie is afraid that Oliver (Murphy), a teen who knows the elder Jones, might squeal so she tells him he can come with his friends, which means bringing his crush, Kinsey (Hughes), and his brother, Richard. Kate's boss Jules (Sertich) is also coming over, with patient Dan (Dellapina) whom she is trying to hook up with Kate. Unwanted guests arrive however, in the form of the \\"bitch\\", Ashley (Akana). Kate arrives, and the party is in full swing, with a huge crowd taking over the house. Kate feels uncomfortable as she wanted a smaller party, but Evie and Charlie win her over, and things start out great. Old friends reunite, Kate talks with Dan and they hit it off, while avoiding Richard who has arrived in his goth alter-ego \\"Raven\\", and everyone is having a good time. However, Oliver sees that Kinsey had arrived with her date Derrick (Leyva), leaving him a loner at the party despite occasionally bonding with her; and Charlie is having betting competitions with Peter (Chamberlain), which is against what she promised to Claire. Evie meets with ex-boyfriend Ben (See), and through a misunderstanding, Kate sees Dan leaving with Ashley. Charlie loses to Peter, proving Claire's point, and she leaves; Jules and Richard/Raven hit it off, while an out of it Kate calls her ex-boyfriend Luke (Cole) about why they didn't continue their relationship, to which he reminds her it was because she didn't want it to continue. Evie and Ben hang out only for her to discover that Ben is creep who still longs for her, and has tattooed her face on his body. Evie freaks out, and after an incident with the teenagers, orders them to leave. Kate, Evie and Charlie discover a broken champagne bottle left by Ashley, and decide to get even with her after so many years. The three arrive at Ashley's home and throw toilet paper all over the yard, as they proclaim the best day and birthday ever, but Evie slips out that she hates her husband and wants a divorce. Dan arrives with Ashley and the homeless man (Ahlquist) she was making out with at her home, where Ashley is furious by their actions, but slips and damages her tooth. Realizing it needs to be taken out otherwise the jaw will be affected, Kate puts the tooth out, and is overjoyed until police arrive and arrest the three, spending the night in jail. Oliver takes Kinsey home, and she realizes Derrick isn't the right guy for her, giving him hope. The three girls are freed thanks to Todd, whom Dan called for help, and Evie puts down her overbearing husband and announces she wants to divorce him. Charlie reunites with Claire, and reveals to her the bet was for her to lose, make Peter look cool, so he can help their business. Kate meets with Dan, and after clearing up what happened, go to breakfast together. It ends with the announcement of Charlie and Claire's engagement, and Kate's high school letter to herself now reflecting her relationship with Dan, loving her job, and the \\"child\\" in the form of Evie leaving with her.

It is a form of situated learning that emphasizes problem-solving within an integrated learning context, which can be examined from multiple perspectives. \\"In other words, the learning is contextualized to provide students with realistic roles that serve to enhance the learning process\\", (Fried, Zannini, Wheeler, Lee, & Cortez, 2005).Fried, A., Zannini, K., Wheeler, D., Lee, Y., & Cortez, a. J. (2005). Theory Name: Anchored Instruction. Retrieved from Suny Cortland: http://web.cortland.edu/frieda/id/idtheories/41.html During teaching, activities are designed or tied around an \\"anchor\\", such as an adventure or story, with a problem at the end, that needs to be resolved. The connection made between the content and the authentic context is referred to as \\"anchoring\\". These models typically embed all the information needed for the problem to be solved, such data and hints. Anchored instruction is akin to Problem-based learning (P.B.L.) with the exception of its open-endedness. Principles for designing anchored instruction The seven principles outlined, are used to govern the design of anchored instruction (Biswas, Goldman, & Bransford, 1997).Biswas, G., Goldman, S., & Bransford, J. (1997). Anchored Interactive Learning Environments. Intl. Journal of AI in Education, vol 8. # Generative Learning Format - An appropriate anchor should be selected for the instruction. This is usually a story that leads to a problem, which is of interest to the students. The end of the story needs to be generated by the learner, which is the solution to the problem. This method provides Intrinsic motivation, through Active learning, because the students take ownership of the problem. # Video-Based Presentation Format - This format allows learner to understand the complex and intertwined problems better than a text or audio format. It solidifies what is taught in textbooks and other literature through a dynamic, visual and spatial representation . The video medium gives life to the characters and depicts an authentic storyline. This format appeals to students who may have difficulty reading, or understanding written text and allows them to develop pattern recognition skills # Narrative Format - The video is narrated to give an account for the characters, the event, and subsequent events. The problem occurs naturally which give the students the impression they are resolving a real problem and not responding to a lecture on a video. The narrative format also makes it easier to embed information into the story. # Problem Complexity - The story or adventure used should have a high level of complexity to demand the full attention and stimulate the curiosity of the learner. The problems or issues should require several steps to be solved. This is based on the Anchored Interactive Learning Environment's (Ihlström & Westerlund, 2013)Ihlström, J., & Westerlund, F. (2013). Interactive Learning environments: The effects of interactivity in online learning environments. Institutionen för informatik. premise; learners must be trained to deal with complex problems that are more realistic. # Embedded Data Design - The story includes seamlessly embedded information that is needed to solve the issues. It should also include a great deal of extraneous information. When formatted in this manner, the learner would need to understand the question and determine what information is pertinent to answering the question. (Goldman, et al.; Sherwood, et al., 1995). # Opportunities for Transfer - Learners are able to transfer knowledge from one subject, example Geometry, to the topics in the same subject. This increases deep learning and skill transfer. # Links Across the Curriculum - In addition to containing all the necessary information, to solve the issue, the story may also introduce topics from other subjects, to provide a holistic learning approach. Roles Anchored instruction highlights the use of Instructional technology. Teachers are moved from the source of information to a coach. It is widely used at primary levels, and is applied to Mathematics, Reading and Language skills. =Role of the Learner= Anchored instruction, promotes active learning, by motivating and challenging learners. The story or anchor contains embedded data along with other extraneous information; it is the learner's responsibility to decipher, extract and organize pertinent information. The problem that needs to be solved, often requires the learner to take multiple steps, by generating a man smaller questions, that ought to support and guide their thinking. Small groups of learners are the appropriate size for this type of instruction. Members of the group often provide multiple opinions, thus having multiple solutions to the problem. Students are responsible for establishing their learning goals =Role of the Facilitator= The facilitators are responsible for providing the anchor, the problem statement and embedded data in the story. Anchored stories also contain hints that act as instructional scaffolding to resolve problems. Scaffolding provides a temporary framework to support learning. The facilitator coaches and guides the learners through the learning process. They assist students to establish their own learning goals. And accept that they are no longer the major source of knowledge. References Other references * Circles, L. (2002, September 11). John Bransford - Anchored Instruction.

The company specialized in the design and manufacture of sailboats for the North American market. History The company was formed by Jensen in 1970 to complement his existing west coast Cal Boats business. Jensen had already started Jensen Marine and had an exclusive boat design contract with William Lapworth. Jensen started Ranger Yachts both to serve the east coast American market and also to allow him to contract Gary Mull to design the Ranger boats. Ranger boats were originally built in Costa Mesa, California, but the operation was moved to Tampa, Florida in 1981 to better serve the market. The company was acquired by American conglomerate Bangor Punta in 1973 and became part of Lear Siegler when it bought out Bangor Punta in 1984. As part of Lear Siegler's restructuring in the late 1980s the Ranger line was discontinued, the design contract with Mull terminated and the division was dissolved in 1987. Lear Siegler later ordered most of the Ranger boat molds destroyed. Designs The company's designs were all drawn by Mull, with the exception of the Fun 23, designed by Joubert-Nivelt of France and the Ranger 30, which was designed by C. Raymond Hunt Associates.

In 1016, he rebelled against Mansur, in likely collusion with Salih ibn Mirdas, forcing Mansur to flee. After a few months, Fath relinquished control of Aleppo to the Fatimid Caliphate, marking the beginning of direct Fatimid rule over the city. Afterward, he held posts in Tyre, then Jerusalem. As governor of Jerusalem, Fath helped the Fatimid general Anushtakin al-Dizbari suppress a rebellion by the Jarrahids in 1024–1025 and maintained order between the Rabbinate and Karaite Jewish sects during the Hoshana Rabbah festivals at the Mount of Olives in 1029 and 1030. Early career Fath was a ghulām (slave soldier) of Mansur ibn Lu'lu',Zakkar 1971, p. 55. the emir of Aleppo between 1008 and 1016. It is not clear when Fath was appointed as governor of the Citadel of Aleppo, but he was governor by at least 1014.Zakkar 1971, p. 52. The name Fath al-Qal'i translates from Arabic as \\"Fath of the Citadel\\". That year, he may have colluded to free the Kilabi chieftain Salih ibn Mirdas from the citadel's dungeon. Salih soon after became a major opponent of Mansur, capturing him the same year of his prison escape then releasing in return for half of Aleppo's revenues.Zakkar 1971, pp. 52–53. Conflict between Salih and Mansur renewed when Mansur reneged on their agreement and the Kilab besieged Aleppo. Rebellion The Citadel of Aleppo in 2010. Fath was the governor of the citadel under Mansur ibn Lu'lu' and derived his surname al-Qal'i (of the Citadel) from this position. On 7 January 1016, Fath rebelled against Mansur in probable collusion with Salih.Zakkar 1971, pp. 55–56. The rebellion was precipitated by Fath's awareness of Mansur's intrigues against him; Mansur accused Fath of connivance with Salih. Fath's action prompted Mansur to flee Aleppo. An agreement was reached between Fath and Salih on the morning of the rebellion to fulfill Mansur's agreement with the latter regarding the sharing of the Emirate of Aleppo's revenues.Zakkar 1971, p. 57. However, at the same, Fath aimed to further secure his position by appealing to the Fatimid governor of Afamiyah, Ali al- Dayf, to send troops to Aleppo, which al-Dayf did. Fath also wrote to Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim and gave the latter his allegiance. Al-Hakim thanked Fath and bestowed on him the title of mubārak al-dawla wa-saʿīd-hā (blessed and happiness of the State). Salih opposed the Fatimid military presence in Aleppo, which he coveted, and warned and advised Fath to force them out with the help Salih's Kilabi tribesmen.Zakkar 1971, p. 58. Salih offered Fath an agreement whereby Fath would continue to hold the citadel, while the Kilab would control the hinterland of Aleppo. Al-Hakim concurrently pressured Fath to relinquish Aleppo to Fatimid administration in return for a lifetime iqtaʿ (fief) consisting of Sidon, Tyre and Beirut and all of the treasures of Aleppo's citadel. Fath went to Salih with this information, and was advised to decline al-Hakim's offer.Zakkar 1971, pp. 58–59. Indeed, Fath was inclined to accept Salih's arrangement, but he faced protests from the people of Aleppo, who rejected the Bedouin rule of the Kilab.Zakkar 1971, p. 59. Meanwhile, al- Dayf requested reinforcements from al-Hakim, who dispatched troops from Tripoli and Sidon. Al-Hakim also had the Tayy and Kalb tribes move toward Aleppo to back Fatimid troops. Fath and Salih were militarily unprepared to face these forces. Thus, Fath accepted al-Hakim's proposed assignment to Tyre and departed Aleppo. Later posts Fath was replaced by the first Fatimid- appointed governor of Aleppo, Aziz al-Dawla, in October 1016. Fath governed Tyre for some time before being appointed governor of Jerusalem during the reign of Caliph az-Zahir, by at least the mid-1020s. In 1024, the Jarrahid chieftain of the Tayy, Hassan ibn Mufarrij, assaulted Jerusalem during his rebellion against Anushtakin al-Dizbari, the Fatimid governor of Palestine.Gil 1997, p. 389. Hassan imposed a fine of 30,000 gold dinars on Fath and looted the money al-Dizbari stored in the city. Fath later fought alongside al- Dizbari during an assault on Hassan's camp outside Ramla in February 1025.Gil 1997, p. 391. Fath was apparently still governor of Jerusalem in 1029 and 1030. During both years, he supervised the Hoshana Rabbah festival at the Mount of Olives, one of the largest Jewish pilgrimage gatherings of the year at the time. During the 1029 festival, which was the first such festival to be held since the Jarrahid revolt of 1024, the Rabbinate religious establishment attempted to excommunicate members of the Karaite sect en masse.Rustow, p. 200. However, the move was voided by the intervention of the Jewish geonim leaders and local Fatimid governors, including Fath and al-Dizbari.Rustow, p. 226. The following year, al-Dizbari issued an edict warning the Rabbinates not to ban the Karaites and had Fath and his troops supervise the festival with lashes and chains prepared to deter such actions.Rustow, p. 228.

Trained in the ateliers of Emil Filla and Antonín Kýbal, Reindl left Czechoslovakia in 1968 and emigrated to Canada as a political refugee. Following in the tradition of Czech Cubism, Reindl’s style was greatly influenced by European modern art, in particular Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Marc Chagall and Jean Dubuffet.  Early life  Born in Czechoslovakia in 1923, Reindl studied at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague, under the tutelage of the avant-garde artist Emil Filla and the textile artist Antonín Kýbal. Reindl graduated in 1951 and married Helena Pokorna, a fellow art student and niece of the sculptor Karel Pokorný, in that same year.  Early work  In 1957, Reindl began working for a Prague advertising studio as a graphic artist, specializing in film posters. At that time, the cost of importing international film posters to Czechoslovakia was prohibitively expensive, and local artists like Reindl were employed to create their own interpretations, often without seeing the films. During the late 50s and early 60s, Reindl created dozens of posters for films such as 12 Angry Men (1957 film), Murder, She Said and Admiral Ushakov (film).  Emigration to Canada  Following the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Reindl emigrated to Montreal, Canada as a political refugee. In the early 1970s he began a career as an art professor, teaching for nearly thirty years at Laval University. During his years as a teacher, Reindl continued to paint, creating hundreds of oil paintings, gouaches, and drawings over the course of his career, however his work was only shared with only a few close friends until after his death in 2002.  Artistic Style  Emil Filla’s influence on Reindl’s work can be seen in his flattened perspective and bold use of color, typical hallmarks of Czech Cubism. Reindl’s work stands out for the bold lines of his drawings and the almost Baroque compositions, which are filled with apparently random details.

Participants must also indicate a confidence level in their response (on a scale of 10). They may additionally providing a free-form comment to explain their selection. The poll is conducted over email, with one question sent every week to the IGM Panel members. Candidate poll questions can be submitted by the general public through the website. The final decision on what question to include is made by IGM faculty. Responses of all poll participants (excluding No Opinion responses), along with confidence level and comment, are available on the IGM Forum poll results page, allowing analysts to better understand the reasoning behind the poll responses. In addition, an unweighted and confidence-weighted summary of responses is available. =Size and composition of the IGM Panel= As of July 2016, the IGM Panel has 51 economists. The IGM Forum website includes a biography and vote history for each panelist. According to economist Justin Wolfers, the IGM Panel is geographically and ideologically diverse and are \\"a good sample of the leading economists in the nation\\". In November 2013, ten new economists joined the IGM Panel. There's also a European version.http://www.igmchicago.org/european-economic-experts- panel/european-economic-experts =Coverage= The New York Times has cited the IGM polls on raising the minimum wage, the utility to consumers of allowing services such as Uber and Lyft to compete on equal footing with taxi firms, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Forbes has also cited the IGM poll on high-skilled immigration, noting the consensus in favor of immigration. U.S. News & World Report has cited the IGM poll on tax cuts. =Reception= The New York Times praised the IGM polls for providing \\"an easily digested summary of the insights of mainstream economics into continuing political controversies\\". Nobel Memorial Prize laureate Paul Krugman, writing for The New York Times in January 2013, noted that the IGM polls did not focus on areas that are disputed by macroeconomists. IGM published a poll entitled \\"Modern Monetary Theory\\" in March 2019, in relation to the heterodox macroeconomic theory that had been in the news at the time. Bill Mitchell (economist), an MMT scholar, described the poll as \\"simply a dishonest representation of MMT\\", stating that he would also \\"strongly disagree\\" to both questions being posed, and concluded that the University of Chicago Booth School of Business is probably falling prey to Groupthink.

Historical evidence suggests that it was probably the ancient and important Maya city known as Chetumal. Early history Evidence excavated at Santa Rita exhibits a long history of inhabitance. The discovery of a burial site containing very early pottery has dated the formation of the city between 2000 and 1200 BCE. Its importance peaked during the Postclassic era, and continued to be occupied even after the arrived of the Spanish. Because of its location, the city at Santa Rita once controlled nearby trade routes between the coast and the mouths of two major rivers, the Río Hondo and Río Nuevo. These rivers served as major arteries of trade to centres in the interior such as Lamanai and those in El Petén. Because of this, it became the dominant settlement in the Chetumal region during the early Classic period. After a short decline during the Late Classic period, Santa Rita once again rose to prominence. Following the decline of Classic sites to the north, Chactemal (also known as Chetumal in some sources) became the capital of one of the 19 Mayan states later recorded by the invading Spanish. Chetumal formed part of the confederation of states under the Cocom dynasty of Mayapán. It remained under this alliance until 1441, when Mayapán supremacy was overthrown by an uprising. =Preclassic Period= The earliest indication of inhabitants at Santa Rita Corozal is dated to the Preclassic Period (1200-900 BCE). They lived upon a high bluff in the southwest area that overlooks Corozal Bay. Four burials were discovered with ceramics and shell jewelry dating from the Preclassic period. This early preclassic period had a small estimated population of 150. According to archaeological evidence, the middle preclassic period did not have an increase in population. The population appears to have grown in the Late Preclassic period. Twelve locations were identified as Late Preclassic sites. Thirty-four burials were found in these twelve locations. Included in the burials was Sierra Red pottery, which is found all over the Mayan Lowlands. The population was thought to be in the region of 1,000 people. The Protoclassic period, which is the temporal period between the Late Preclassic and Early Classic periods, is estimated by archaeologists to have increased in population again. Four burials have been dated to this time period.Chase, Diane Z. and Chase, Arlen F. (2004) \\"Santa Rita Corozal: Twenty Year Later\\" in Research Reports in Belizean Archaeology. 1: 243-255. =Classic Period= The Early Classic period had 1,500 residents who lived in a village that was much different than the earlier periods. Monuments were constructed and trades item were found, indicating that trade was increasing. Thirteen burials found from this time period indicate that an extensive social hierarchy was in place. Three of those thirteen burials were found in Structure 7, they had extravagant items not find in the other burials. Structure 7 is the tallest building at Santa Rita Corozal. One of these burials, which is dated to 450 A.D. contained what is thought to be a powerful ruler of Santa Rita Corozal. He was interred with items associated with the burial offerings of higher-ranked citizens. It is important to note that at this Early Classic time period, a distinct social structure had developed. The wealth found at the burials is thought to be due to trade along the rivers that border Santa Rita Corozal-the New River and the Rio Hondo. The Late Classic period is found throughout the site. It is estimated that by 750 A.D. nearly 2,500 residents were living at the site. Artifacts found throughout the site indicate that a large portion of the population had access to most items. The social hierarchy of the early Classic period had vanished. =Postclassic period= The excavations that lead to the discovery of Preclassic and Classic materials and burials were originally looking for information on Postclassic material. Thomas Gann's discovery of Postclassic murals, and excavations at Santa Rita Corozal would eventually lead researchers to Santa Rita Corozal in search of the Postclassic Maya. In 1979, a research project was developed to bring better understanding of the Postclassical Maya. It sought to identify the archaeological history of Santa Rita Corozal, to understand the origins and ending of the Postclassical period, and to comprehend the ritual, social and politics of the Late Postclassic period. At the time of its origin the Postclassic Maya were seen as a declining society that had abandoned its rituals, cities and were a shadow of their former splendor. Santa Rita Corozal did not decline into obscurity, quite the opposite occurred. Large buildings were not erected, but low lying buildings were constructed. By the Late Postclassic period Santa Rita Corozal had its highest number of inhabitants. The population at 1300-1539 CE was estimated to be at 6,900 residents. Excavations were undertaken in 1985, in the south central area of Santa Rita Corozal. Nine buildings were found that were constructed in the Postclassic period. Most of them were built over earlier buildings. The artifacts found in two structures, Structures 183 and 213, both contained figure artifacts. Structure 213 contained 25 figures that were placed in the ground prior to its construction. Nine of the figures were put into a ceramic urn with the remaining sixteen figurines surrounding it. Structure 183 contained 28 figurines that were placed into a ceramic urn in front of an altar.Chase, Diane Z. Chase, Arlen F. (1986) \\"Offerings to the Gods: Maya Archaeology at Santa Rita Corozal\\", University of Central Florida, Orlando. Excavation The modern town of Corozal was founded in 1848 by refugees from the Caste War in neighbouring Yucatán, and expanded steadily making it the major ethnicity in the country at the time. The ruins of Santa Rita became a target for building resources; the mounds of the site made convenient road fill and the stones were used for structure foundations. Because of this, the exact borders of the ancient Mayan city may never be known. In the early 1900s, amateur archaeologist Thomas Gann visited the site and discovered a Mixtec-influenced mural; these do not survive, but copies made by Gann do. No substantial research followed this until the Corozal Postclassic Project, led by Arlen Chase and Diane Zaino Chase, carried out a series of excavations between 1979 and 1985. Little structural evidence remains from the Postclassic era. The only existing structure at the ruins dates from the Classic era. The centre of this building has been described as a ceremonial chamber, with a complex series of interconnected passages leading to other rooms, including two burial chambers. One contained the remains an elderly woman surrounded with jewellery and pottery; the other was that of a warlord, evident from the artefacts found buried with him — a ceremonial flint representing leadership and a stingray spine most used in blood-letting rituals. Both burials date from around 500 CE. Artifacts found dating from the Postclassic era reveal that religious rituals like blood-letting, which were very important during the Classic era, continued to play an important role. The presence of items of Aztec origin, also dating from the Postclassic period, attest to the continuing trade importance of Santa Rita several hundred years after the decline of the major ceremonial centres of the interior.

First published in English translation in 1990, Women marked Sollers's move to a more accessible form of fiction writing after a series of difficult experimental texts. The novel was a best-seller in France and attracted attention as a roman à clef that contained recognizable portraits of significant French intellectual figures, such as Louis Althusser, Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, and Sollers himself. Plot summary Will is an American journalist living in Paris. On leave from his duties writing about international politics at the Journal, he travels around the globe as he works on a novel in which he intends to expose the domination of the world by women. Through his friend Kate, Will has become aware of a secret international organization called the World Organization for Male Annihilation and a New Natality, or WOMANN, that intends to stage a secret takeover of world power. WOMANN's secret manifesto details a plan to take over the world by strictly controlling the reproductive process through the use of abortion, sperm banks, and artificial insemination; by expurgating, banning, or \\"contextualizing\\" the products of certain male geniuses; and also by declaring war on the patriarchal tyranny of religion through a campaign of \\"divide and rule.\\" Will, who is a freethinker and notorious womanizer, is marked as an enemy by WOMANN. The novel follows Will's sexual escapades around the world with a number of women whose interest in the novel he is writing (the novel we are reading) leads him to suspect he is being surveilled by WOMANN. Will has enlisted a notorious French novelist, \\"S.\\" (who bears significant similarities to Philippe Sollers), to publish the novel under S's name since Will is worried about the response of his family in the United States if he were to publish it under his own name. Will's monologue about his life and opinions includes extended digressions about such topics as politics, literature, sex, contemporary life, religion, and the Bible. Will's amorous exploits are occasionally interrupted by time spent at home with his wife, Deb, and his son Stephen. He is eventually injured in a terrorist attack that kills his lover Cyd, an English TV journalist. The novel concludes with Will leaving Paris to start a new life with Deb and Stephen in New York City. Reception Readers and critics greeted Women enthusiastically when the book was first published in France in 1983. The novel was a best-seller in France and was celebrated by critics as \\"one of the best books in recent years.\\" Roland Champagne, in his book-length survey of Sollers's career, attributed the book's popularity to the \\"sense of humor that [Sollers] exhibits with his narrating voice,\\" and went on to say that the character of Will, the protagonist of Women, is emblematic of Sollers's tendency to model his protagonists on himself, a dynamic Champagne described as \\"the self as humorous other.\\" Elaine Kendall, writing in the Los Angeles Times, called Women \\"ferociously misogynistic\\" and wrote that the novel \\"splinters into frank pornography.\\" Kendall went on to say that \\"Women may be the first pointillist post-feminist novel,\\" and contended that \\"Women stridently demands to be taken seriously as a nihilistic satire on philosophy, religion, the arts, social science, America, France, and whatever else swims into view.\\" Other reviewers were less troubled by the ostensibly misogynist content. Leon Roudiez, writing in World Literature Today, maintained that in opposition to the book's \\"macho rhythm,\\" Sollers's writing in Women also displayed \\"a female tide that gives it a complex, perplexing quality.\\" Roudiez went on to praise Women as \\"a personal prospect of the intellectual, literary, and political scene during the past few years as well as an account of [Sollers's] own concerns and obsessions.\\" Roudiez was laudatory in his assessment, calling Women \\"a book that should be read by all those interested in the contemporary scene as well as those who might be troubled by Bataille's notion of eroticism as the sanctioning of life unto death.\\" Roudiez contended that the book \\"might teach us more about contemporary reality than the ponderous writings of historians could do.\\" The Antioch Review, in its assessment of Women, hailed the novel as \\"a very interesting trip into the fantastic mental Odyssey of a modern writer.\\" In particular, the Antioch Review found Will to be a fascinating character, describing him as \\"witty, aggressive, narcissistic, and driven by the relentless desire to explore contemporary life.\\" The London Review of Books gave a more measured assessment of Women and emphasized the correspondences between the characters in the novel and real luminaries from the French literary and philosophical world: \\"Women is not only, as the title suggests, a kiss-and-tell epic ... but an explicit roman à clef containing mildly scandalous and instantly recognizable portraits of such celebrated figures as Lacan, Althusser, and Barthes.\\" Conceding that Women is \\"infectiously high-spirited at times,\\" the reviewer concluded that the book seemed \\"not so much a machine to think as a machine for ego-massaging.... Whether Woman adds to or detracts from Philippe Sollers's notoriety is, in the end, a pretty trivial question.\\" Susan Ireland, writing about Women for The Review of Contemporary Fiction, recommended the book, stating that \\"those willing to join Sollers in his playful romp through Parisian literary milieux may well enjoy the social satire and the effervescent virtuosity of his style.\\" Extended considerations of Women appear in the book-length treatments of Sollers's oeuvre by Roland Champagne and Malcolm Pollard. Champagne contends that despite Sollers's turn to a more straightforward narrative style than in his previous experimental works, this change \\"is undercut by the self-deprecating tone of the narrative voice.\\" Champagne goes on to point out that Sollers's \\"style is not flatly sincere... the humor of Femmes is subtle because the sexism of the narrator and the other males is asserted by response to the assertive threats of the women characters.\\" Both Roland Champagne and Malcolm Pollard see Sollers's fascination with William de Kooning as central to the novel, and crucial to understanding novel's perspective on women. \\"The feminine side of De Kooning intrigues Sollers and might be very similar to the side of Sollers that is suggested in the portrayal of women in Femmes. The desires of women are not obvious to men and yet both of these artists, De Kooning and Sollers, involve their own eroticism in a fascination with desiring women.\\" Pollard argues that Sollers sees De Kooning as an \\"ally\\" for his narrator since De Kooning's life, like Will's, is marked by battle against dogmatic enemies. Pollard identifies an \\"analogy ... between De Kooning as a painter attacked for the form and content of his art, and Will as narrator concerned with the threat posed to freedom of expression in the novel.\\" An English-language excerpt from Women was published in Yale French Studies in 1988, and Women appeared in an English translation by Barbara Bray in 1990.

It is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types. This enzyme catalyzes the degradation of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) degradation. ADAMTS7 has been associated with cancer and arthritis in multiple tissue types. The ADAMTS7 gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.  Structure  = Gene = The ADAMTS7 gene resides on chromosome 15 at the band 15q24.2 and contains 25 exons. = Protein = This 1686-amino acid protein belongs to the ADAMTS family and is one of 19 members known in humans. As an ADAMTS protein, ADAMTS7 contains a shared proteinase domain and an ancillary domain. The proteinase domain can be further divided into a signal peptide, a prodomain, a metalloproteinase domain, and a disintegrin-like domain. In particular, the metalloproteinase domain contains a cysteine-switch motif in its binding site for binding the catalytic zinc ion (Zn2+). A pharmacophore model consisting of four hydrogen bond donor sites and three hydrogen bond acceptor sites was proposed for this domain. Unlike the proteinase domain, the ancillary domain varies by ADAMTS protein and includes any number of thrombospondin (TSP) type 1 motifs, one cysteine-rich and spacer domain, and other domains specific to certain ADAMTS proteins. ADAMTS7 in particular possesses 8 TSP type 1 motifs which, together with its spacer domain, participate in the protein’s tight interaction with the extracellular matrix.  Function  ADAMTS7 was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain of COMP as the bait. As a metalloproteinase, ADAMTS7 utilizes Zn2+ to catalyze its proteolytic function for COMP degradation. In vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC), ADAMTS7 mediates VSMC migration, which plays an essential role during the development of atherosclerosis and restenosis. Adamts7 deficiency in both the Ldlr−/− and Apoe−/− hyperlipidemic mouse models markedly attenuates formation of atherosclerotic lesions; furthermore, wire- injury experiments in the Adamts7−/− mouse show reduced neointima formation. The association of ADAMTS7 with atherosclerosis suggests that inhibition of ADAMTS7 should be atheroprotective in humans.  Clinical Significance  A negative correlation between the expression levels of specific miRNAs and ADAMTS7 is observed in normal tissues but not in disease tissues, implying an altered miRNA-target interaction in the disease state. Accordingly, expression profiles of these miRNAs and ADAMTS7 may be useful diagnostic tools to differentiate cancer and lichen planus from normal tissues. ADAMTS7 has also been identified as a putative oncogene and reported to be mutated exclusively in Asians, which may have implications for the prevention and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, ADAMTS7 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of arthritis. For example, the FGF2/p65/miR-105/Runx2/ADAMTS axis is reportedly involved in osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis. Specifically, ADAMTS7 forms a positive feedback loop with tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the pathogenesis of OA. = Clinical Marker = Genome-wide association studies identified ADAMTS7 as a risk locus for coronary artery disease. Studies have been carried on classification of ADAMTS7 binding site, which may serve as the first step toward developing a new therapeutic target for coronary artery disease. Significant associations for coronary artery calcification with SNPs in ADAMTS7 has also been found in Hispanics. Additionally, a multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci, including the ADAMTS7 gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).

Since 1997, the 218th Regiment has been the Regional Training institute of the South Carolina Army National Guard.  History  = Origins = The 218th Infantry traced its lineage back to the 1st South Carolina Infantry (Gregg's), a Confederate unit of the American Civil War. During the Reconstruction it existed as rifle clubs and following the readmission of South Carolina to the United States the regiment was reorganized as separate companies between 1875 and 1878. On 9 January 1878 the separate companies became part of the 3rd Division, which was reorganized as the 3rd Infantry Regiment of the South Carolina Volunteers in 1883. On 23 November 1907 it was reorganized as the 1st Infantry Regiment of the South Carolina National Guard. The 1st South Carolina was called up for service on the Mexican border on 1 July 1916 at Styx. After returning from the border it was mustered out on 6 December. As a result of the United States' entry into World War I, the regiment was called up on 12 April 1917 and drafted into Federal service on 5 August 1917. It was redesignated as the 118th Infantry Regiment of the 30th Division and served in France. The 118th was demobilized after the end of the war and consolidated with the 105th Ammunition Train, the former 2nd South Carolina Infantry, to form the 1st Infantry, South Carolina National Guard, between 1919 and 1921.

Voters chose twelve electors, or representatives to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Background The 1918 mid-term elections had seen the Midwestern farming community largely desert the Democratic Party due to supposed preferential treatment of Southern farmers:Morello, John A.; Albert D. Lasker, Advertising, and the Election of Warren G. Harding, p. 64 Democratic seats in the Midwest fell from thirty-four to seventeen,Hough, Jerry F.; Changing Party Coalitions: The Mystery of the Red State-Blue State Alignment, pp. 86-87 whilst Scandinavian-Americans were also vigorously opposed to entering the war.Saldin, Robert P., 'World War I and the System of 1896' (2010); Political Science Faculty Publications, Paper 1, pp. 825-836 Moreover, Democratic fear of Communism seen in the Palmer Raids and \\"Red Scare\\" led to Cox, then Governor of Ohio, to ban German-language instruction in public schools in 1919. Much more critical for German-Americans was the view that outgoing President Woodrow Wilson was deliberately trying to punish Germany and Austria for starting the war, especially via his disregard for the United Kingdom's continuing blockade of Germany.Lichtman, Allan J.; Prejudice and the Old Politics: The Presidential Election of 1928, pp. 102, 115 Stressing Harding's German ancestry, the German press drummed up the view that As the campaign began after the Republican Party had nominated U.S. Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio and the Democratic Party former Ohio governor James M. Cox, a further blow to the Democrats – who had never won Minnesota but came tantalizingly close in 1916 when they lost by one vote in 988Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections; Presidential General Election Results Comparison – Minnesota – occurred when the national economy suffered a major downturn following the wartime boom, resulting in plummeting agricultural prices that were especially problematic in the Midwest.Goldberg, David Joseph; Discontented America: The United States in the 1920s, p. 47 Whereas Cox travelled throughout the nation apart from the \\"Solid South\\" during September,Faykosh, Joseph D., Bowling Green State University; The Front Porch of the American People: James Cox and the Presidential Election of 1920 (thesis), p. 69 Harding, despite having four times the budget, campaigned from his home in Marion, Ohio. A poll by the giant Rexall drug store chain – which in 1916 had been accurate enough to predict Wilson's razor-thin wins in New Hampshire and CaliforniaPietrusza, David; 1920: The Year of the Six Presidents, p. 398 – suggested Harding would win 382 electoral votes,Bagby, Rexby; The Road to Normalcy: The Presidential Campaign and Election of 1920, pp. 158-159 and at the end of October, although no more opinion polls had been published, most observers were even more convinced that the Republicans would take complete control of all branches of government.'Republicans Going to Win: Prospects of a Complete Victory'; The Observer, October 31, 1920, p. 13 Harding overwhelmingly carried Minnesota by a margin of 376,427 votes, or 51.16 points, and nationally won the election, with 404 electoral votes and a 26.17 point lead over Cox in the popular vote, which constitutes the most lopsided result in any United States presidential election held since James Monroe's uncontested re-election in 1820. Cox did not win a single state north of the Mason-Dixon line nor west of the Continental Divide. The percentage of Minnesota's popular vote won by Harding in 1920 is second only to Theodore Roosevelt's 74% of the state's popular vote from 1904, as Harding was helped by mass defection of registered Democratic German-Americans to the Republican ticket. Harding became the second and last presidential nominee after Theodore Roosevelt in 1904 to sweep all Minnesota’s counties. This was the last time the Republicans won Red Lake County until George Bush junior in 2000Menendez, Albert J. The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, 1868-2004, p. 121 and the last time Mahnomen County voted Republican until Ronald Reagan in 1980.Menendez; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, pp. 228-232 The presidential election of 1920 is also noteworthy for the third party candidacy of the perennial Socialist candidate, Eugene V. Debs. Debs won nearly a million votes nationally, and 7.62 percent in Minnesota with second place ahead of Cox in six counties, despite the fact that he was incarcerated at the time. On September 12, 1918, Debs had been convicted on ten counts of sedition in relation to a speech he had given in Canton, Ohio on June 16, 1918, in which he encouraged conscientious objection to World War I. Of the five presidential elections in which Debs had been a candidate, 1920 was his second-greatest showing in terms of percentage of the popular vote won — he only did better in 1912. 1920 was also his final appearance on the ballot.

He was the son of Kaji Nain Singh Thapa, a nephew of the Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa and elder brother of Mathabar Singh Thapa. His mother was Rana Kumari Pande, daughter of Mulkaji Ranajit Pande and granddaughter of Kaji Tularam Pande. During his late teenage, he was the military commander at the Palpa-Butwal axis during the Anglo-Nepalese War. He became the Governor (Bada Hakim) and the commander of armed forces deployed in Palpa administrative sector in 1814 AD on substitute of his grandfather Amar Singh Thapa (sanukaji) who died that year. Family and Early Life Ujir Singh was born on Chaitra Shukla Pratipada Tithi in the year 1852 of Bikram Samvat (1796 A.D.). He was the son of Kaji Nain Singh Thapa and grandson of Sanu Sardar Amar Singh Thapa. His grandfather died on 7th Kartik 1871 B.S. He traveled 20 days from Kathmandu to Palpa and took the control of the office of Governor of Palpa Gauda (Province) on 8th Mangshir, 1871 B.S. aged 19 years old. Military and administrative career He was Colonel in the ranks of Nepalese Army and was awarded an official private black seal which can be seen in the letter of 1821 A.D. to the Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa.http://www.bilder-aus- nepal.de/Pages/Philatelie/Thapa-Brief/Thapa-Brief-1821.html He obtained a famous victory against the British forces at the Battle of Jitgadhi during the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814–1816. He was the military commander at the Mid- Western (Palpa-Butwal) axis during the Anglo-Nepalese War. He had deployed 1200 troops in defenses of Jit Gadhi, Nuwakot Gadhi, and Kathe Gadhi. He was famous for exploiting an advantage in men, material, natural resources and well versed in mountain tactics. Henry Thoby Prinsep quoted about the Jeetgadh administered by Ujir Singh as : Before entering the war, Ujir Singh had constructed roads, bridges, culverts and fortified garrisons in the Butwal- Palpa region. The British advance began on 22 Poush, 1871 B.S.(January 1814 A.D.) to Jit Gadhi. While crossing Tinau River to attack the fortress Ujir's forces opened the fire and made them fall back. Similarly, at Tansen Bazaar the British fell back with a total loss of 300 men while 70 Nepalese lost their lives. In 1825, a complaint of border incursions was lodged at the jurisdiction of Ujir Singh's administration. Such was done to oppose the Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa in the policy of forging alliance with the Burmese government. Sindoor Jatra procession Tansen, Palpa Various deities were worshipped and auspicious time was determined to ensure victory before initiating war with British forces on the 1814-1816 war. Ujir Singh then touched the feet of a 16 handed Mahishashur Mardini Bhagwati deity in Tansen Bazaar and took solemn vow to spread her fame by constructing a temple and initiating a Sindoor Jatra (procession of vermillion) upon the victory of Gorkhali forces in the war.https://web.archive.org/web/20180815042836/http://ecs.com.np/features/indifferent- cart-procession After the victory of the Gorkhali forces, he began the construction of a three storied temple in 1872 V.S. which was accomplished in 1876 V.S. After the completion of construction of the temple, he donated gold equivalent to his height as the Gajur (pinnacle) for the temple and constructed silver canopied Mahishashur Mardini Bhagwati whose 18 arms were built of Ashtadhatu (octo-alloy). He started the Khat Jatra, together with Palpa Bhagwati's Sindoor Jatra, on the day of Bhadra Krishna Nawami in 1877 V.S. For the purpose of worship and rituals, he had invited Chandramani Gubhaju of Patan to perform Nitya Naumaitik Puja, Barsha Bandhan Puja and Tantric rituals during Kalaratri, Chaite Dashain, and others. The procession is observed till date as celebration of victory.  Military Laws  Ujir Singh Thapa had issued six rules in 1879 V.S. for the purpose of both civil and military administration.https://web.archive.org/web/20190102105524/http://www.lawcommission.gov.np/en/wp- content/uploads/2018/09/rules-on-military-and-civil-service-by-ujir-singh- thapa-1879-b-s.pdf Legacy On Friday 7 April 2017, the Chief of Army Staff (Nepal) Rajendra Chhetri unveiled the life-size statue of Ujir Singh at Tansen, Palpa.https://web.archive.org/web/20170410203737/http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-04-08/statue- of-ujir-singh-unveiled-in-tansen.html The statue was constructed jointly by the Palpa Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Chandi Prasad Battalion of Nepal Army.

Roskam, starring Matthias Schoenaerts and Adèle Exarchopoulos. A gangster and a racing car driver fall in love, set against the background of a brutal crime gang in Brussels. It has been selected to be screened out of competition at the 74th Venice International Film Festival. It was selected as the Belgian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. It received five nominations at the 8th Magritte Awards, including Best Flemish Film. Plot In flashback Gigi as a boy is running from the police and his own father threatens to release attack dogs on him. Introduced to Bibi after a motor racing event Gigi pretends he works importing and exporting cars, and asks her out on a date. As their relationship continues, comments from his friends about their wild youth and his time in juvenile detention raise her suspicions. In a private moment Bibi asks him to reveal his greatest secret and Gigi jokingly admits he robs banks. They daydream about travel and when asked if she could go anywhere Bibi suggests that should go to Buenos Aires. Gigi and his friends successfully rob a banker they met at party held by Bibi's racing group. Gigi is falling in love with Bibi and is reluctant to do any further jobs. Bibi's father has suspicions too and confronts Gigi, urging him to be honest with Bibi like a real man should do. Gigi tells him he wants to marry Bibi. Bibi has a growing realisation that Gigi isn't telling her the whole truth but they confess their love for each other. The gang plan another more elaborate heist, and as their getaway driver Gigi is essential to their plans. The gang drop a shipping container off a road bridge, to trap a money transport van and police escort. They get away with the money but Gigi is sick with nerves. The money is booby trapped with explosives and one of the gang is badly injured. Gigi leaves the hideout to call a doctor from a nearby payphone. He also calls Bibi and she warns him that police officers were killed in the robbery and that a major manhunt was underway and for her sake he should not resist. The gang is caught and all are sent to prison. Bibi is sure of her love and wants to stay with Gigi so during brief prison visits they try to get pregnant. They turn to fertility treatment to try to conceive, but while on temporary leave from prison Gigi is bitten on the leg by a small dog. After kicking the dog in retaliation the police get involved and Gigi runs in panic. Bibi hides him temporarily but when a police manhunt begins she convinces him to give himself up and return to prison. Medical tests reveal that instead of a baby, Bibi has cancer growing in her ovaries. Desperate she turns to gangsters to help her break Gigi out of prison. The gangsters think she is suffering from morning sickness and decline to help her. Their boss goes to meet her and sees she has been ravaged by chemotherapy, when she admits she has an aggressive cancer and wants Gigi broken out of prison only if she dies, and the boss agrees, taking her Porsche as collateral. As he leaves, Bibi collapses and is taken to hospital. Gigi has been told nothing about her plans to break him out and has been trying to break out himself. Gigi is allowed to leave prison under heavy guard and visit Bibi in hospital, but she has already fallen into a coma, and dies. Prisoners explain to Gigi that a breakout has been arranged, and there is a plan to smuggle him to Buenos Aires. To confirm it is real they say the words \\"No flowers\\" echoing the request Bibi made on their first date. They savagely beat him, forcing the prison warden to transfer him to another prison for his protection, and during the transport they break him out. Gigi does not want to go to Buenos Aires, he only wants to be with Bibi. The gangsters don't tolerate this since their payout is tied to Gigi's arrival in Buenos Aires. As punishment, they lock him in a cage in a warehouse full of dogs. When they come back to retrieve him, he attacks with a chain and kills his kidnappers. He finds Bibi's Porsche and drives along a route she had driven before. In voiceover, we hear the scene from earlier in the film where Bibi and Gigi discuss their biggest secrets, Bibi's reveals her secret: she is immortal. Gigi drives to a cemetery and leaves the car running as he runs in to meet her.

Gleiberman says that Gigi's lack of honesty and vulnerability threatening their relationship is a good obstacle but that the obstacle of Gigi's inevitable incarceration \\"seems to choke off the film's dramatic possibilities\\" and \\"the whole thing becomes drenched in a kind of downbeat sentimental martyrdom that feels oppressively old-fashioned and moribund.\\" See also * List of submissions to the 90th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film * List of Belgian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film References External links  * Category:Belgian films Category:French films Category:2017 films Category:2017 drama films Category:Belgian drama films Category:French drama films Category:Films set in Belgium Category:Films shot in Belgium Category:Films set in Brussels Category:Films shot in Brussels Category:Films directed by Michaël R.

The Church Council () was responsible for preparing it. The supplement contains 283 hymns and other songs, including liturgical songs and songs in Sami. Stylistically, it has a broad range of material, and the volume includes works by a number of composers and lyricists that are not represented in the 1985 hymnal. Approximately half of the songs were written after 1980; that is, after the selection for the 1985 hymnal had largely been completed. The foreword to the book states: > Salmer 1997 has a broad stylistic span, in both its language and music. > Different song traditions and different forms of expression stand side by > side to cover the many needs of worship and to accommodate different users. Most strongly represented are songs from the Nordic Lutheran churches, reflected in the fact that the lyricists with the most original contributions wrote in either Norwegian or Swedish (with contributions by Svein Ellingsen,Henkys, Jürgen. 2013.

However, its breadth is manifested in the fact that over 150 different lyricists and almost as many composers are represented. In addition to the Nordic Lutheran tradition, the volume includes a wide selection of songs from the revival movement, newer songs used in youth groups, and well-known Christian children's songs. Increased international contacts between churches in Norway and the rest of the world also resulted in the inclusion of songs from churches in Latin America and Africa, among other places.

They eventually became titans of the wheat industry, operating the largest corporate wheat farm in the Dakota Territory (in Grandin, North Dakota) in the late 19th century –which was possibly the largest such farm in the United States at the time.  Historical background  Grandin family ancestors reportedly came to America from the Isle of Jersey in the early 1700s. The first generations of Grandins in America found success in the mercantile industry. Samuel Grandin (1800-1888) was born in Sussex County, New Jersey where he was educated only until age 8 or 10, and then left school to apprentice as a tailor and follow his family in mercantile work. In 1822, Samuel Grandin decided to move to Pennsylvania in search of new opportunities. He continued mercantile work there for another 18 years. During this time he married Saran Ann Henry in 1832, and they had seven children, five sons and two daughters; Morris Worts Grandin (deceased in infancy), Stephen Girard Grandin (b.1835; deceased at 16), John Livingston Grandin (b.1836), William James Grandin (b.1838), Elijah Bishop Grandin (b.1840), Maria Jane Grandin (b.1843), and Emma Ann Grandin (b.1849; deceased during childhood). Early life The Grandin Brothers; Stephen Girard Grandin (b.1835), John Livingston Grandin (b.1836), and William James Grandin (b.1838), were all born in Pleasantville, Venango County, Pennsylvania. In 1840 their father moved the family to the nearby town of Tidioute. In Tidioute, Elijah Bishop Grandin was born (b.1840) and the boys' father ended his career as a tailor and entered the lumber industry, buying 33 acres of land and building a lumber mill. He began shipping timber down the Allegany River, much of which came from his land. At young ages the Grandin boys quickly followed their father into lumber work. In 1851, Stephen Girard tragically drowned at the age of 16, leaving only three of the five brothers surviving. John Livingston and William James worked in the lumber business early on and at the general store in Tidioute. Their younger brother Elijah Bishop, left home in early adulthood and went to work for the Hyde Bros. Lumber Company in Hydetown, Crawford County, Pennsylvania. Second oil well, oil business On August 27, 1859, Edwin Drake dug a successful commercial oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania which is commonly credited as the first oil well dug specifically as a commercial well in the United States. Days after the Drake well came in, news reached the Grandin General Store in Tidioute approximately 20 miles away. After hearing that Drake was selling barrels of oil at 75 cents each, John Livingston (then aged 23) who knew of petroleum seepage in the area, immediately began buying up small tracts of land surrounding an “oil spring” he knew of. On August 31, 1859, 4 days after the Drake well, John Livingston set up a spring-pole well, a simpler setup than Drake's technique. This well is credited as being the second well dug specifically for commercial oil drilling purposes in the United States. Despite drilling down 134 feet, nearly twice the depth of Drake's well, in an area Grandin had seen petroleum seepage at surface level, Grandin's first well was unsuccessful and dry. John Livingston then recruited his brother William James and after that first unsuccessful attempt, they dug several more wells that were then successful and turned extremely profitable. Around this time Elijah Bishop returned to Pennsylvania to join his brothers in their oil business. Together they set up pipelines and containers. Along with Edwin Drake's, their efforts were a precursor to the Pennsylvania oil rush. According to legend, over the next several years the Grandin Brothers' oil endeavors eventually became so successful that John Livingston set up an appointment to meet John D. Rockefeller, another oil prospector at the time, to negotiate a partnership, but Rockefeller kept him waiting and after a period of time, refusing to wait any longer Grandin walked out before Rockefeller arrived, possibly forfeiting a chance for them to get in on the ground floor with Standard Oil. Grandin Brothers Bank In 1868, after several years of very successful oil endeavors, John Livingston Grandin and a business partner, A. Clark Baum, started a general banking business in Tidioute, founded with oil money. Two years later, John Livingston's brother William James purchased Baum's stake in the business and it became the Grandin Brothers Bank. Around this time the Philadelphia Financier Jay Cooke was undertaking a campaign to sell Northern Pacific Railway securities in his role as principal financier of the project. The Northern Pacific had turned to Cooke after his very successful efforts raising money for the Union Army during the Civil War by selling Civil War securities to investors in England. As the Grandin Bros. Bank grew its capital, the Grandin Brothers decided to use Jay Cooke & Company as one of their bank's depositories. However, in 1873 Cooke & Company went bankrupt, a major cause of the Panic of 1873. Cooke then told his creditors he could only repay them 15 cents on the dollar. Rather than accept 15 cents on the dollar for the considerable sum they were owed, and in turn lose a large portion of their oil profits, the Grandin Brothers decided to consider accepting the only collateral security available on the money. This collateral security was Northern Pacific Railway bonds with certain land purchasing rights to government land grants in the Dakota Territory made to the railroad. The theory for these bonds had been that once the railroad was completed, thus making the surrounding land much more valuable, the investors of the railway could exercise these bonds for a profit. However, since funding for the railroad ceased in 1873, so did the construction, and this land was thousands of acres of uninhabited prairie and wilderness in the Dakota Territory and beyond with no finished railway to reach them. Western exploration, Dakota bonanza farming In 1875, John Livingston went out to the Red River Valley of the Dakota Territory to inspect this land himself. He traveled to the farthest settlement into the territory, Fargo, which was then just a town of tents. At Fargo he hired an experienced Colonel and together they trekked fifty miles north in the Red River Valley to the government railroad land. Along the way they encountered a frontiersman living on the Red River and growing a small amount of wheat for himself. Considering what could be done with the land, John Livingston noted the rich surface soil and thick clay sub-soil, and recognized the good conditions for growing more wheat. He surveyed and marked off two townships, having the possibility to buy the odd sections. On reporting this survey to the Department of Interior in Moorhead, Minnesota, the survey was accepted. Deciding to exercise the Grandin Brothers' right to the Railroad Bonds with government land purchasing rights, he then purchased 26,000 acres of Rail Road land. He also bought another 2,560 acres of government land at a discount, by promising the U.S. Government at the Department of Interior that they would put aside land to put up a town thus helping to develop the country as there were no known settlers living on the prairie there at that time. (The town they put up became Grandin, North Dakota) Knowing little about farming and interested in getting back to the banking, oil and lumber businesses in Pennsylvania, John Livingston contacted Oliver Dalrymple, a land speculator also from Pennsylvania who was cultivating half a section [320 acres] of wheat in nearby Minnesota, the largest known farm in the area at the time. The Grandin Brothers hired Dalrymple to get a corporate wheat farm up and running on a large portion of their land. As their success grew, they purchased more land and at the Grandin Farm's height they possed by some accounts 86,000 acres of the best wheat land in the American continent, and employed over 400 workers. Not a single year passed where their profits did not exceed the original amount owed to them by Jay Cooke & Company. Since the Grandin Brothers now owned several miles of land along the Red River, in order to quickly get the cultivated wheat to market they set up the Grandin Steamboat Line of steamboats and barges to transport both wheat and passengers down to Fargo. In Fargo they set up a 50,000 bushel grain elevator on the railroad line to carry the wheat to market. By 1888 however, much of the steamboat traffic had been replaced by trains. Grandin Farm land liquidation After amassing sizable fortunes, the Grandin Brothers began to slowly reduce the Grandin Farm holdings known as the Grandin Farm, by selling off half sections (320 acres) and full sections (640 acres) at a time, in then developed North Dakota, for vastly more than they originally paid for them. By their deaths in the early 20th century, much of the land had been sold off. In 1920, John Livingston Grandin Jr., the son of John Livingston Grandin sold the remaining 3,259 acres as the final disposition of the Grandin Land. However the buyer was deceased 3 years later, and with the mortgage unpaid, the land was repossessed. It was then supervised by a member of the Grandin Family and rented from 1923 until 1934, when the land was conveyed to the Grandin Land Trust, to be sold when another buyer was found. The land was finally again sold outright in 1948, marking the true final disposition of Grandin land.

He was known for his popular essays and books under the pen name Grandfather Lickshingle. After working at newspapers in Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania, he joined the New York World, and later became editor of the New Yorker newspaper. In 1905 he was arrested for criminal libel after publishing an article allegedly impugning Alice Roosevelt, daughter of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. While awaiting trial for libel, and also under suspicion of defrauding subscribers, he was struck by a New York City subway train in an apparent suicide. Early life and career Robert Wesley Criswell was born in Clarion County, Pennsylvania, in 1850. His father, also named Robert Criswell, was a prominent man in Clarion County, who afterward found success in the oil business of Venango County. The younger Robert attended the Chickering Institute in Cincinnati and Moores Hill College, Indiana, and his brother David became a noted oil producer. Criswell's first newspaper work was writing occasional sketches for the Cincinnati Commercial. Later he was employed as local editor of the Independent, published at East Brady, Pennsylvania. From East Brady he went to Cincinnati and worked a year for The Cincinnati Enquirer writing political letters from Indiana and reporting on the Indiana legislature. While at Indianapolis he accepted an offer to come to Oil City, Pennsylvania and edit the Oil City Derrick, assuming editorship in 1877, also establishing the publishing firm Boyle & Criswell which published the Derrick until 1889. A feature of his work on the Derrick was a humor department, which was quoted widely internationally. He again returned to Cincinnati, to take a position on the staff of the Enquirer, afterward succeeding to the managing editorship of that paper, which position he held for five years. Criswell was editor of the Petroleum World at Titusville, and his last newspaper connection in the oil country was as one of the proprietors of the Derrick under the firm name of Boyle & Criswell. He published two books of humor: The New , and Grandfather Lickshingle and Other Sketches. In 1878, he married Alice McCreary, a niece of former Kentucky Governor James B. McCreary. New York career and death 1890 promotion for \\"Grandfather Lickshingle\\" columns He later worked for the New York Daily Graphic and by 1890, Criswell had joined the staff of the New York World. In 1904, Criswell became editor of The New Yorker, a weekly newspaper established 3 years earlier. On June 21, 1905, Criswell published an article titled \\"An Insult to Alice Roosevelt\\" which alleged President Roosevelt's daughter Alice was being utilized by Ohio congressman Nicholas Longworth to advance his career, and that Longworth introduced Roosevelt to unsavory persons, including racetrack bookmakers and Kentucky representative Joseph L. Rhinock, who had reportedly been indicted for stealing $50 from a man. A criminal libel suit was filed by Rhinock against Criswell and The New Yorker, and Criswell was arrested on July 11. Criswell claimed that the article was written by a trusted Cincinnati correspondent who had viewed Rhinock's indictment. Criswell was released on $1,000 bail, with a trial set for September. On August 3, 1905, Criswell, \\"evidently under stress of great excitement\\", ran down the steps of the 72nd Street subway station, ran alongside a train, jumped in front of the cars, and was killed instantly. After his death, it was revealed Criswell and New Yorker publisher Robert A. Irving were suspected of engaging in fraud: Assistant District Attorney Paul Krotel stated Criswell and Irving had collected $6,500 from subscribers for a book to be called America's Foremost Families, but upon review of accounting, no money had been spent on production, and no evidence was presented that any part of the book had been written. Krotel said Criswell \\"was very nervous and scared the last time he was here, and I am not greatly surprised to hear of his death\\". After Criswell's death, Irving was jailed for the same libel suit. Criswell's death was formally declared a suicide by the coroner after two witnesses testified that Criswell flung himself in front of an approaching train and then deliberately laid his head and hands on the rail. The libel suit resumed in October. The New Yorker was defunct by January, 1906, when all that remained \\"above ground or out of jail\\" was a desk and chair.

He was born circa 1728 AD to Ashiram Kunwar in the Kunwar family. His descendants went on to found the Rana dynasty of Nepal. He was successful general in the Unification campaign of Nepal of King Prithvi Narayan Shah. He defeated British forces at Hariharpur Gadhi on 25 August 1767. He died in Mechi Campaign in 1771 A.D. Family He was born to Ahiram Kunwar. He had only a son named Ranajit Kunwar and three grandsons; Bal Narsingh Kunwar, Balram Kunwar and Rewant Kunwar. Career King Prithvi Narayan sent Kaji Vamsharaj Pande, Naahar Singh Basnyat, Jeeva Shah, Ram Krishna Kunwar and others to defeat the forces of Gurgin Khan at Makwanpur. Ram Krishna was ordered by the King to organize the army at Makwanpur under his control. In a letter to Ramkrishna, King Prithvi Narayan Shah was unhappy at the death of Kaji Kalu Pande and thought it was impossible to conquer Kathmandu valley after the death of Kalu Pande. After the annexation of Kathmandu valley, King Prithvi Narayan Shah praised in his letter about valour and wisdom shown by Ramkrishna in annexation of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur (i.e. Nepal valley at the time) on 1768-69 A.D. The letter sent by King Prithvi Narayan Shah to Ramkrishna Kunwar on Ashwin Badi 5 of unknown Vikram Year has been mentioned by historian Baburam Acharya The Gorkhali monarch also expresses condolence in that letter over the death of one of the brothers of Ram Krishna in the battle of Timal. Another index letter sent by King Rana Bahadur Shah to Jaya Krishna Kunwar in 1843 Vikram Samvat (i.e. 1786 A.D.) confirms that Jaya Krishna did not die in the battle of Timal which could point to the death of his youngest brother Amar Singh Kunwar in the battle of Timal. When Ram Krishna was conferred the confiscated properties (including residence) of former Kathmandu King Jaya Prakash Malla, he donated the properties to \\"Guthi\\" for supplying foods to pilgrims in Shivaratri festival. King Prithvi Narayan Shah had deployed Sardar Ram Krishna to the invasion of Kirant regional areas comprising; Pallo Kirant (Limbuwan), Wallo Kirant and Majh Kirant (Khambuwan). In 13th of Bhadra 1829 Vikram Samvat (i.e. 29 August 1772), Ram Krishna crossed Dudhkoshi river to invade King Karna Sen of. Majh Kirant (Khambuwan) and Saptari region with fellow commander Abhiman Singh Basnyat. He crossed Arun River to reach Chainpur(Limbuwan). Later, he achieved victory over Kirant region. King Prithvi Narayan Shah bestowed 22 pairs of Shirpau (special headgear) in appreciation to Ram Krishna Kunwar after his victory over the Kirant region. Genealogist Daniel Wright contends that Ram Krishna died at Pyuthan at the age of 59. Rana dynasty His descendants later went on to become Rana dynasty of Nepal.

The capital of the Umasuyu was Azangaro, which depended on Hatunqulla. This form of government based on duality was characteristic of the central Andean societies, in which both parts were complementary but one still ruled over the other, the Inca for example divided their empire and society in Hanan (Quechua: Upper) and Hurin (Quechua: Lower).

Alonso Ramos Gavilan noted: \\"the Qollas of Titikaka had that famous altar and shrine, was a waka from the puquina qollas and uroqollas\\".Alonso Ramos Gavilan (1988:58) Within the realm of the Qulla were three ethnic groups: Aymara, Puquina and Uro (some Uros spoke Puquina and the others Uruquilla). Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala clearly distinguish these ethnic groups and identified them as Qolla to the Aymaras, as Puquina Qolla to the Puquinas and as Uro Qolla to the Uros.  Inca Conquest  About ten years after his coronation, Pachacuti began his expansionist military campaign to the Collao, sending a group of soldiers under the command of Apo Conde Mayta towards the border with the Colla Kingdom, the powerful group that had as lord Chuchi Capac, also known as the Qulla Capac. It didn't take long for Pachacuti to join the vanguard troops, entering in enemy lands until reaching the base of the Vilcanota. The Qulla Capac, aware of the Inca incursion into his territory, went with his army to the town of Ayaviri to wait for them. Upon arriving at this town, Pachacuti understood that a peaceful subjection wouldn't be possible, so a long battle ensued. As the fight was prolonged, fearing to be defeated, the Collas retreated to Pucara, an andean fortification, where they were persecuted by the Incas. In Pucara the second battle was fought, in which not only were the Incas victorious, but they also managed to take prisoner the powerful Qulla Capac. Once ensured the victory, Pachacútec went to Hatunqulla, home of the defeated curaca, where he remained until all the subordinate towns came to render obedience.

Bamsa Raj Pande, Vansha Raj Pande, or Bangsha Raj Pande) (; translit. vaṃśarāja pām̐ḍe) was a Nepalese politician, military officer and minister of state. He was a significant army commander of Kingdom of Nepal in the second half of 18th century. He was a follower of Bahadur Shah of Nepal and had a significant rivalry with Swaroop Singh Karki. Early Life and family He was born as eldest son of Kaji of Gorkha Kingdom Kalu Pande in 1739 A.D. He had two brothers - Ranashur Pande and Damodar Pande. He had a sister Chitravati Pande who was married to Kaji Kehar Singh Basnyat of the noble Basnyat family. Career Vamsharaj was made a Kaji on Marwat policy in V.S. 1819 (1762 A.D.). On 20 January 1763, Vamsha Raj Pande won a battle against Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Bengal. On 14 April 1769 A.D., he was the army commander who led attack of Gorkhali side on the Battle of Bhaktapur. After consolidation of Kathmandu valley states, King Prithvi Narayan Shah waged war against western Chaubise (24) Confederacy on 1770 under military leadership of Kaji Bamsharaj, Kaji Kehar Singh Basnyat and Sardar Prabhu Malla and achieved initial success. On 1771, the Gorkhali forces lost the war against Chaubise (24) principalities and Kaji Kehar Singh Basnyat died in the battlefield. In the same war, Bamsharaj was captured by soldiers of Parbat Kingdom as war prisoner. His subordinate commanders Dhaukal Singh Basnyat and Sriharsha Pantha escaped with difficulty after the tough confrontation at Dhor. The document dated Bikram Samvat 1833 Bhadra Vadi 3 Roj 6 (i.e. Friday 2 August 1776), shows that he had carried the title of Dewan along with Swaroop Singh Karki. It was the time when he had just returned from the Parbat prison. Chaubisi confederacy attacked Gorkha Kingdom on Sirhanchowk Gadhi (fort) at north and established their own position on 2 January 1782 A.D. Commander Garud Dhoj Pant of Tanahun Kingdom launched attack on Gorkhali side with combined army of Lamjung and Parbat and also included soldiers from Kaski, Palpa and Pyuthan. Queen Rajendra Lakshmi Devi wanted ultimate destruction of trade route of Lamjung. Thus, Bamsharaj was called back from his exile in Bettiah to launch attack on Lamjung Kingdom. Queen regent Rajendra Laxmi Devi also called up exiled courtier and his rival Swaroop Singh Karki to attack on Lamjung Kingdom. A reconciliation was done with both courtiers. Subsequently, Vamsharaj imposed economic blockade over Lamjung. Bamsharaj's youngest brother Damodar Pande also took part in the attack. Vamsharaj had fought battles against Makwanpur, Timal and Sindhuli in 1762, Kirtipur in 1764, Chihan Danda in 1766, Tanahun in 1770, Pauwa Gadh in 1776, and Lamjung in 1783 A.D. Death at Bhandarkhal Bamsha Raj was beheaded on the conspiracy of Queen Rajendra Laxmi with the help of supporters including senior minister Kaji Swarup Singh Karki. In the special tribunal meeting at Bhandarkhal garden, east of Kathmandu Durbar, Swaroop Singh held Bamsa Raj liable for letting the King of Parbat, Kirtibam Malla, to run away in the battle a year before. He was declared guilty and was executed by beheading on the tribunal. Daniel Wright points out that King Rana Bahadur Shah was responsible for giving Bamsha Raj the death penalty. Historian Rishikesh Shah and Ganga Karmacharya claim that he was executed on March 1785. Bhadra Ratna Bajracharya and Tulsi Ram Vaidya claim that he was executed on 21 April 1785.http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ancientnepal/pdf/ancient_nepal_121-122_01.pdf On 2 July 1785, Prince Regent Bahadur Shah of Nepal who was aligned to him was arrested.

Shiner (1805–1880) was an African-American Navy Yard worker and diarist who chronicled events in Washington D.C. for more than 60 years, first as a slave and later as a free man. His diary entries have provided historians a first hand account of the War of 1812, the British Invasion of Washington, the burning of the U.S. Capitol and Navy Yard, and the rescue of his family from slavery as well as shipyard working conditions, racial tensions and other issues and events of 19th century military and civilian life.Steve Vogel, Through the Perilous Fight: Six Weeks That Saved the Nation, Random House, May 7, 2013 p. 165 Early life, the Diary and Education First page of Michael Shiner's Diary, p.1. 1813.Library of Congress. Militia officer, Lloyd Pumphrey was related to slaveholder William Pumphrey, who first placed Shiner at the navy yard. Thomas Howard was an officer in the District of Columbia militia and \\"clerk of the yard\\" In 1828 Howard purchased Shiner for $250.00 as \\"term slave\\" from William Pumphrey's estate. Shiner was born into slavery in 1805 and grew up near Piscataway, Maryland, working on a farm called \\"Poor Man's Industry\\" that belonged to slaveholder William Pumphrey Jr. Pumphrey brought young Shiner into the District of Columbia about 1813 to serve as a servant at his Grant Row lodgings.NARA 18 April 1878 letter of Michael Shiner to Board of Pensions re claim of Edward Foster. The first entries date begin in this same year, the year of the British invasion of North America. Shiner however wrote these early entries as recollections (as opposed to contemporaneously) when he was an adult. Although often described as \\"The Diary of Michael Shiner\\", the first section of the manuscript is a narrative memoir written and arranged chronologically the important events he had witnessed in his youth. Shiner never called his manuscript a diary instead he simply inscribed the flyleaf \\"his book\\". Shiner concentrates primarily on significant public events in his life which he witnessed or read about, combined with some limited but important personal incidents and concerns. Shiner wrote using phonetic spelling and little punctuation. Because literacy for blacks outside of religious instruction was discouraged at the time, it is not known with certainty how Shiner learned to read and write. Some historians have speculated that he may have learned from a small school at the Navy Yard run by white abolitionists. The 1870 report of Department of Education of the District of Columbia Special Report however confirms Shiner achieved literacy as an adult: > The Sabbath School among the colored people in those times differed from the > institution as organized among whites as it embraced young and old and most > of the time was given not to studying of the Bible but to learning to read. > It was the only school which for a time they were allowed to enter.First > Presbyterian Church of Washington at the foot of Capitol Hill opened a > Sunday school for colored people in 1826 which held regular meetings every > Sunday evening for years and in it many men women and children learned their > alphabet and to read the bible. Michael Shiner one of the most remarkable > colored men of the District who remembers almost everything that occurred at > the Navy Yard during his service of some 60 years there is of this number. District of Columbia Department of Education, Special Report of the Commissioner of Education on the Condition of Public Schools in the District of Columbia, Submitted to the Senate June 6, 1868 and to the House with Additions June 13, 1870. (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1870): 215, 221. War of 1812 During The War of 1812 Shiner recollected watching the British invasion of Washington DC: \\"They looked like flames of fire, all red coats and the stocks of their guns painted with red vermilion, and the iron work shined like a Spanish dollar.\\" Writing in 1878 he recounted \\"At the time of the battle of Bladensburg [ Wednesday 24 August] 1814 I was living with my master near where Grant Row now is in on East Capitol Street ... The British army followed our army and burned first the large dwellings at the corner of 5th and Maryland avenue Gen'l Ross 's horse was shot down from that house. They then burned the buildings then on A Street near the Capitol. I was an eye witness to all this. The British stayed, in Washington until Friday night and then left.\\"Shiner Diary , Introduction quoting 18 April 1878 letter of Michael Shiner to Board of Pensions re claim of Edward Foster. When he and a young companion began to run, they were stopped by Mrs. Reed, an older white woman, who scolded them: \\"Where are you running you nigger you? What do you think the British want with such a nigger as you?\\" Shiner's friend hid in a baking oven, but Shiner continued to watch the events unfold. Mrs. Reed was likely echoing white fear in the District, which heightened just before the Battle of Bladensburg 24 August 1814, \\"by an insistent rumor that a slave revolt had erupted in District of Columbia and the adjoining counties.\\" The rumor was false yet many in the militia fled back into the city to protect their homes furthering the state of apprehension and dread.Taylor Allan The Internal Enemy Slavery and War In Virginia, 1772 -1832 WW Norton & Co. New York 2013,p.305, 387. As the war continued, Shiner described what he saw and learned in great detail. While there was no slave rebellion, the lure of freedom was real.Franklin, John Hope and Schweninger, Loren Runaway Slaves Rebels on the Plantation Oxford University Press: New York 1999. p.28. In 1813 Rear Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane had promised to emancipate slaves who joined their British forces. Some of the enslaved took advantage of the war to escape servitude and join the British forces.William S. Dudley, editor The Naval War of 1812 A Documentary History Volume II. (Naval Historical Center: Washington DC 1992), 324-325. One of these men was Archibald Clark enslaved to James Pumphrey 1765 -1832. James Pumphrey was the master of Michael Shiner's future wife Phillis and someone Shiner would have encountered often. During the War of 1812 information regarding Clark's successful escape to the British may have circulated among the brothers William and James Pumphrey's enslaved workforce and to the young Michael Shiner. Clark was both literate and wrote his family and his former master.Taylor, p.384,544 n81. Marriage and family In his early twenties, he attended a Sunday school run by the First Presbyterian Church of Washington at the foot of Capitol Hill which had opened for free and enslaved blacks in 1826. He also mentions attending Ebenezer Methodist church services in the 1820s. Shiner generally kept his literacy secret, and wrote very little of a personal nature. Instead he chose to describe the public events he witnessed in the District and the navy yard. About 1828 Shiner married a 20-year-old woman named Phillis (her surname is unknown), who had been purchased at the age of nine by William Pumphrey's brother James Pumphrey who also worked and lived in Washington DC. The young couple lived together near the naval yard and had six children. Later documentation reflects the Shiner family regularly attended the Ebenezer Methodist Church where they took part in church adult classes for free and enslaved black people. Among those who attended Ebenezer in the 1820s and 1830s with the Shiner's were many employees of the shipyard; both black and white. Black attendees during these years were numerous, and included many community leaders such as: Moses Liverpool, Nicholas Franklin, Thomas Smallwood, Alethia Tanner and Sophia Bell. Work at the Navy Yard An early illustration of the Washington Navy Yard From 1800-1830 the Washington Navy Yard was the District's main employer of enslaved African Americans. In 1808, muster lists show they made up one third of the workforce. The number of enslaved workers gradually declined during the next thirty years. William Pumphrey, like many slaveholders, rented his enslaved workers to the Navy Yard. In the \\"Muster Book of the U.S. Navy in Ordinary at the Navy Yard Washington City, Shiner is recorded as \\"Ordinary Seaman\\" with the notation he was first entered on the Ordinary rolls 1 July 1826. Muster of the Washington Navy Yard Ordinary, dated 1 Jan 1827. Michael Shiner number 39, \\"O.S.\\" or ordinary seaman, and many of the other individuals enumerated O.S., e.g. Thomas Penn, Basil Brown, John Thompson, and Joseph Savoy were in fact enslaved.Photo National Archives and Records Administration Washington DC In the early nineteenth century naval shipyard, the Ordinary was where naval ships were held in reserve, or for later need. Ships in Ordinary normally were older ships awaiting restoration that had minimal crews of semi-retired or disabled sailors who remained on board to make sure that the vessels were kept in usable condition, provided security, kept the bilge pump operating, and ensured the lines were secure. Here enslaved African Americans worked as seamen, cooks, servants or laborers, performing many of the most unpleasant and difficult jobs. The work they did included scraping the hull, moving timber, and helping to suppress fires. Their wages were paid directly to their owners. At the navy yard enslaved workers were given limited medical treatment per the Secretary of the Navy's 1813 letter. This emergency medical care was provided solely to reassure and preserve the slaveholders property.William Jones to Dr. Edward Cutbush, 23 May 1813 RG45 NARA Michael Shiner was treated on at least two occasions 1827 and 1829 for \\"fever\\".The Register of Patients Naval Hospitals 1812 - 1934 Vol. 45., National Archives and Records Administration, Record Group 52 Records of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, Field Records Case Files for Patients at Naval Hospitals & Registers Entry 45. As an enslaved seamen Shiner's movements were on occasion carefully observed and recorded in the navy yard station log i.e. 27 and 28 December 1828.Sharp, John G. Washington Navy Yard Station Log Entries November 1822 - December 1889 Naval History and Heritage Command 2014 https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list- alphabetically/w/washington-navy-yard-station-log- november-1822-march-1830-extracts.html In his diary, Shiner, who later worked as a painter, chronicled the daily routine at the Navy Yard, providing important details of early working conditions and social attitudes at the Yard toward slaves and freeman. He tells of one incident where he was surrounded by a mob of thugs who \\"lit me up torch fashion with firecrackers\\" and another where he had to flee a gang of sailors who mistook him for a runaway slave. Other incidents he recounted included nearly drowning after falling in the freezing water and seeing a fellow worker accidentally decapitated while working.J.D. Dickey, \\"Empire of Mud: The Secret History of Washington, D.C\\", Rowman and Littlefield, 2014, p. 128 Like many people who worked at the navy yard Shiner paid attention to the elements and is careful to record unusual weather such as the Year Without a Summer of 1816. For that year he wrote of the cold, unusual formations on the sun and crop failures, \\"wher a hard Winter for they Wher three black spots in the sun after the Winter closed the sun become to as red as blood ther Wher a frost every night the hold summer the Where no corn Made scarrly aBout in different section of the country it Where all Whitherd up.\\" Weather was of particular concern since most employees enslaved and free worked outdoors regardless of the weather. In 1829 he records: \\"went out to the fire at that time a little before the bell rang for twelve and stayed at the garrison until between 1 and 2 o'clock in the night and the coldest night i ever felt in my life the hose were led from the garrison to reservoir at the market house it were so cold that the hose freeze up they formed lines in different sections passed the water with a bucket to the fire they worked like men there were a little Disturbance occurred between a fire[men] from the city and Samuel Brigs a firemen of the an a casta [Anacostia River] But that was soon settled by captain Wm Easby interfering Which at that time were Master Boat Builder of the Washington Navy yard that Wher a Hard Winter they wasn't 2 cord of Wood on the commercial Wharf they wasn't no Wood in the navy yard [ illegible] and they were not ten ton of coal in the yard they were condemn from War\\" He also noted celestial phenomena e.g. Leonids meteor showers Nov. 12 1833: \\"The Meteors fell from the elements the 12 of November 1833 on Thursday in Washington. It frightened the people half to death.\\"Tonya Bolden, Capital Days Michael Shiner's Journal and the Nation's Capital (Abrams Books New York City 2015),55. Shiner also described military/civilian relationships and the efforts of early federal workers for better pay and employment conditions, including the 1835 Washington Navy Yard labor strike, which disintegrated into the Snow riots, a race riot of whites against blacks that was finally brought under control by President Andrew Jackson and the U.S. Marines. Writing in July 1835, Shiner recounts how white mechanics through threats intimidated black caulkers into quitting work on the USS Columbia\\"and they wher fifteen or twenty of them here at that time Caulkin on the Col lumbia USS Columbiaand the Carpinters made all of them knock oft two.\\" He added that,a group of striking white navy yard mechanics went after free black restaurant owner Beverley Snow and later threatened to attack Commodore Isaac Hull: \\"all the Mechanics of classes gathered into snows Restaurant and broke him up Root and Branch and they were after snow but he flew for his life and that night after they had broke snow up they threatened to come to the navy yard after commodore Hull.\\" Shiner enjoyed the public events of the capitol and attended nearly all presidential inaugurations from John Quincy Adams to Abraham Lincoln's 2nd inaugural. He relates the large crowd as the president Lincoln stepped out onto the East Portico to deliver his soon to be famous address: \\"And on the fourth of March 1865 on Saturday the hon Abraham Lincoln taken his Seat Before he Came out on the porch to take his [seat] the wind blew and it rained with out intermission and as soon as Mr Lincoln came out the wind ceased blowing and the rain ceased raining and the Sun Came out and it was near as clear as it could be and calm and at the mean time there was a Star made its appearance west rite over the Capitol and it Shined just as bright as it could be ...\\" On 14 April 1865 after learning of Lincoln's assassination by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth, Shiner \\"clearly connected himself to the catastrophic event\\" Martha Hodes \\"Lincoln's Black Mourners.\\" Social Text 33.4 125 (2015): 69. Web. He wrote \\"Hon abraham Licoln [Lincoln] was assassinated on the 14 of April on good Friday knight at fords theater in washing[ton]and he died on the 15 of April 1865 on Saturday. \\"And on Friday evening before he was assassinated Mr Lincoln and his Lady where Both down at the Washington navy on good Friday the 14 1865.\\"Shiner Diary, 184.Bolden, 61-63.Large crowd and black troops at Lincoln's second inauguration, March 4, 1865 with as author Tonya Bolden has suggested, \\"perhaps Michael Shiner.\\" Slavery and freedom A group of shackled slaves walk past the U.S. Capitol in 1836 When William Pumphrey died in 1827, he stipulated in his will that all eight his slaves were to be sold as 'term slaves' for a specific period of time, and afterwards manumitted. Michael Shiner was to be freed after another fifteen years of slavery.Maryland State Archives Will of William Pumphrey 12 August 1827 Prince George's County Md. Liber TT#1 folio 423 and 424. William Pumphrey's manumissions may have been prompted by his Methodist faith, or more likely they served to insure the solvency of his estate by promising his bondsmen freedom after a specified time thus precluding fear of a massive slave sale and a follow on movement into the deep south.T. Stephen Whitman The Price of Freedom Slavery and Manumission in Baltimore and Early Modern Maryland(The University Press of Kentucky:Lexington 1997),101 Pumphrey had used prospective manumission as early as November 1816 when he sold two women Sarah Shins age 38. and her daughter Ellen Shins to a fellow slaveholder in the District of Columbia.Freedom & Slavery Documents in the District of Columbia Recorder of Deeds Office, Volume 3 1816 -1822 editor Helen Hoban Rodgers (Otter Bay Books: Baltimore 2009),217 no.627 Shiner was subsequently bought by Thomas Howard, clerk of the Navy Yard in 1828 for $250. When Thomas Howard died in 1832, his will stipulated that Shiner be \\"...manumitted and set him free, at the expiration of eight years,[1836] if he conducted himself worthy of such a privilege\\".Archives of the District of Columbia District of Columbia Orphans Court (Probate) Court Records Group 2, Records of the Superior Court 1832 Box 11 The estate inventory enumerated Shiner as \\"Black Man M.Shiner Slave for four years [value] $ 100\\".Will of Thomas Howard, Archives of the District of Columbia, District of Columbia Orphans Court (Probate) Court Records Group 2, Records of the Superior Court 1832 Box 11 On 3 March 1833, William Pumphrey 's brother slaveholder James Pumphrey died.

As a freeman he continued to work at the Navy Yard as a painter where he was able to save money and provide for his family. Later life Shiner's wife Phillis died some time before 1849. In 1850 he was living in Washington DC with his second wife Jane Jackson, aged 19, and children Sarah, Isaac and Braxton. After the Civil War, Shiner prospered, was active in the Republican Party and became an outspoken champion of black rights. During the Civil War Shiner's son Joseph C Shiner,(1836-1868) served as a private in the 3rd U.S.Colored Infantry. Shiner worked at the Navy Yard until some time after 1870. In his later years, it is believed he may have expanded upon some of the early entries in his diary, adding specifics which he did not know as a child. Death and legacy Shiner died of smallpox on 17 January 1880. He was buried in the segregated Beckelts Cemetery AKA Union Beneficial Association Cemetery on C Street, SE.District of Columbia Death Certificate for Michael Shiner no. 22895 dated 17 January 1880. The newspaper the Evening Star published a front-page obituary of Shiner, writing that he had \\"the most retentive memory of anyone in the city, being able to give the name and date of every event which came under his observation, even in his boyhood.\\" After his death, the Shiner manuscript was sold to a \\"U.S. Army captain W.H.

It is worthy of perusal. The author Michael Shiner was a patriot may he rest in peace.\\" Following Shiner's death his wife Jane Jackson Shiner, filed the necessary papers to probate the estate and at her death, the estate went to her daughter Mary Ann Shiner Almarolia.

After its first trip in 2008, >500 volunteers participated in NPLD-GHI from the United States, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Israel, and China by 2016. These individuals include physician anesthesiologists, obstetricians (including maternal-fetal medicine specialists), neonatologists, midwives, labor and delivery nurses, senior anesthesiology residents/fellows, interpreters, and other volunteers. More than 200 lectures have been given as part of NPLD-GHI's educational program. Participants of NPLD-GHI co-hosted weekend conferences have increased from <100 in 2008 to just under 3000 in 2016 (6 conference sites). In recent years, NPLD-GHI members have participated in up to 15 obstetric and obstetric anesthesia conferences annually. Approximately 300 attendees participate each month in each Modern L&D; Virtual Lecture Hall. The 55 participating hospitals cover care for a parturient population of approximately 500,000 annually. The Obstetric Anesthesia Infrastructure Development (OAID) project was initiated at 31 hospitals in 25 cities from 2008 to 2016. The annual number of hospital sites visited increased from 1 in 2008 to 6 in 2016. Since 2014, 6 additional hospitals each year have participated in the Obstetric Anesthesia Support (OAS) project to meet the local increased demands. Furthermore, its Private Hospital (PH) Project has been initiated since Sept. 2015. = Background = Neuraxial labor analgesia is commonly available in high-income countries. These techniques have been shown to be safe and effective for alleviating labor pain. Neuraxial analgesia is associated with improved maternal and neonatal outcomes and has been recommended by American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) as a proactive approach for high-risk parturient safety during labor., In contrast, a 2007 study reported that neuraxial labor analgesia was used by <1% of parturients in China. = Initiation = NPLD-GHI was established and designed to educate Chinese women and their health care providers about the safe and effective use of labor analgesia, was developed at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Launched in 2008, NPLD-GHI's goals were to improve maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes by increasing the rate of labor epidural analgesia by 10% and to promote sustained change in obstetric anesthesia care, with measurable improvements in outcome.

The fourth is the Advanced Obstetric Anesthesia 1 + 2 + 3 Project (AOA123), designed not only to advance engaged hospitals from providing a safe and effective neuraxial labor analgesia services to reaching a full range of state-of-the-art obstetric and anesthetic services, but also to have self sustainable improvements. = Basic Obstetric Anesthesia projects = The Obstetric Anesthesia Infrastructure Development (OAID) Project was launched in 2008 at the Women's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. It has since been implemented at 24 additional hospitals. The OAID project involves a week-long, hands-on session offered by an interdisciplinary team from the United States, Canada, and Europe. The program is offered at 1 to 6 sites per year, depending on the number of volunteers and available resources. OAID is offered only to sites that meet specific screening requirements NPLD-GHI OAID Site Screening Assessment: * Adequate anesthesia manpower for 24/7 obstetric anesthesia coverage. * Multidisciplinary incentives for labor analgesia. * Financial and administrative support from hospital administration. After the assessment, a team of 11 - 12 volunteers including obstetric anesthesiology attending physicians, anesthesiology residents, obstetricians, labor and delivery nurses, neonatologist or neonatal intensive care nurse, and interpreters travel to one of the screened hospitals. The team leader is typically a Chinese-born obstetric anesthesiologist practicing in the United States. The team leader is thus fluent in both Mandarin and English and familiar with Western standards of obstetric care. A typical week schedule consists daily themes: 1. Orientation day, 2. Mother safety day, 3. Baby safety day, 4. No pain day, 5. Patient satisfaction day, 6. Crash day, 7. Conference day. The Obstetric Anesthesia Support (OAS) Project was established in 2014 as an alternative to OAID for hospitals that only partially met the screening metrics for OAID. Typically, this is intended for hospitals that lacked the necessary administration support. Rather than a 1-week visit by a NPLD-GHI team, the labor ward professionals from these hospitals are invited to OAID sites during the NPLD- GHI training week to observe educational activities. The goal of OAS is to maximize the NPLD-GHI's impact in hospitals with limited resources, especially personnel, and for the visiting Chinese professionals to take the knowledge acquired during the NPLD-GHI training sessions back to their own hospitals and implement it locally. In order to meet the demands from Chinese private hospitals due to recently China's healthcare system reform, NPLD-GHI has started its Private Hospital (PH) Project, another alternative to OAID for mainly private hospitals since Sept. 2015. A total of 12 hospitals have participated in the PH project by Oct. 2016. = Advanced Obstetric Anesthesia = Advanced Obstetric Anesthesia 1 + 2 + 3 Project (AOA123) was established as a follow-up program for hospitals that participated in the OAID project. The goal of the AOA123 project is to further promote labor analgesia and vaginal delivery in high-risk patients and to provide additional training in the management of obstetric emergencies. NPLD-GHI AOA123 Site Screening Assessment: * Existing 24/7 obstetric anesthesia coverage. * Neuraxial labor analgesia rate over 50% * Weekly multidisciplinary debriefing meetings with hospital administration present To participate in the AOA123 program, hospitals first undergo a follow-up assessment to monitor the sustained effects of the OAID week. The assessment occurs at least 1 year after the primary visit. The follow-up measures, initiated after 2012, were introduced after observing that some hospitals failed to sustain the agreed upon improved anesthesia protocols. The assessment includes appropriate allocation of both time and resources, and the documentation of the site's commitment to the success of the project. 1\\\\.

Our participants come from major medical institutions across the US, including Northwestern, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and Stanford. We use data from several large impact studies, including a total of 55,000 deliveries to demonstrate an improvement in maternal and fetal outcomes, including a reduction in the cesarean delivery rate. With the implementation of our ideas and practices, roughly 15,000 unnecessary caesarean deliveries can be prevented and episiotomies. We are also making some progress in reducing the number of unnecessary episiotomies. Anecdotal reports suggest that we have even saved the lives of at least ten women and their babies through the dissemination of our crash cesarean delivery protocol. We are bringing a positive change to Chinese culture where laboring mothers can fully appreciate the miracle of childbirth without experiencing the unnecessary pain that comes with it. 2008: Establishing Obstetric Anesthesia Guideline 2011: National mandate for a DECREASE in cesarean delivery rate 2012: Creation of a NATIONAL BILLING CODE for neuraxial labor analgesia 2012：Updating Obstetric Anesthesia Guideline 2013: Updating obstetric guidelines for arrest of labor in the 2nd stage 2014: Updating obstetric guidelines for arrest of labor in the 2nd stage again 2014: China Labor and Delivery Study Lead by Jun Zhang, MD, PhD  References  External links * NPLD-GHI Official Website * NPLD-GHI YouTube * Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine Department of Anesthesiology * Journal of No Pain Labor & Delivery – Global Health Initiative (J NPLD-GHI) Category:Organizations established in 2006 Category:Obstetrics and gynaecology organizations Category:Anesthesiology organizations ","title":"No Pain Labor &amp; Delivery – Global Health Initiative"},{"id":"51880673","text":"Heavyweight boxers Muhammad Ali and Bob Foster fought on November 21, 1972.

It stars Jocelin Donahue, Jesse Bradford, Jesse Borrego, Brea Grant, James Eckhouse, and Lori Petty.  Plot  Kate Bowman is a by-the-books social worker who is investigating a series of deaths after her twin sister, Beth, suddenly dies under mysterious circumstances. Each victim suffered from sleep paralysis, a frightening ailment that immobilizes its victims as they dream. Kate is approached by an unorthodox doctor who warns of an evil entity that haunts people in their sleep. She brushes aside his admonition, but when a terrifying entity begins to haunt Kate's friends and loved ones, she must fight to stay awake to stop the nightmare. After becoming convinced the monster is real, Kate teams up with Beth's boyfriend Evan, and meets up with the doctor again. They come up with a plan to allow her to fall asleep and inject her with adrenaline before the creature can kill her. She falls asleep and all seems to be going well, until the monster attacks and she shows no signs of being in sleep paralysis (her eyes are closed, and she seems to be sleeping peacefully). Evan notices something amiss, and figures out that she's in paralysis and under attack. They manage to administer the adrenaline just in time to wake her, apparently dispersing the creature and freeing Kate from its attacks. As they prep to perform the same procedure on Evan, Kate suddenly realizes that her parents have the research on the phenomenon and could be under attack as well. They arrive at her parents' house, and find them doing just fine, after which, they head to Evan's apartment so Kate can shower and he can feed his kitten. While Kate is showering, Evan falls asleep, and the 'hag' monster emerges from a painting of it he created earlier in the film. As the monster attacks, Kate comes out of the shower and tries to revive him, unsuccessfully. Paramedics arrive on the scene, and he is seen being taken away while Kate looks on, despondent. Kate visits him in the hospital to find out he's in a coma. The doctor arrives, and convinces Kate that she hasn't defeated the monster yet, and that she needs to go to sleep and break the sleep paralysis on her own in order to defeat it once and for all. After seeing Kate to sleep, the doctor watches over her and sees her attacked by the monster but can't get his adrenaline pump to work. He goes to sleep as well, knowing the monster will come after him over Kate. Once he falls asleep, Kate is temporarily left alone and has a dream-within-a-dream sequence where she meets her sister. Her sister, Beth, begins to prey on her fears of being a bad sister, and the reason she's dead. Kate realizes Beth would not be saying the things she's saying, and attacks Beth, knowing it's really the Hag. She stabs the hag, then finds herself back in her 'real' body being choked by the Hag. She breaks her paralysis, and attacks the hag, strangling it (apparently) to death. In the next scene, Kate is vlogging about her experiences and telling her audience that Evan has awoken, and her paralysis has come back, but that the Hag has not reappeared. She also promises her audience that she will not stop until she comes up with a permanent solution for everyone. In the final scene, Dr. Sykes is seen asleep and wakes up to see the hag appearing over the end of her bed and proceeds to attack her, with the screen fading to black.

He is best known for his 1971 novel Vandenberg. Life Wadleigh was born and raised in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen. He joined the Army as World War II was coming to a close and later attended Columbia University, where he met former Santa Fean author and teacher John Richard Humphreys, who became his friend and mentor. In 1958, while working as an editorial assistant for The New Yorker, he published his first novel, The Bitter Passion, already under the Lange pseudonym. Soon after that, yearning for wilderness, he relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico, \\"six miles from the nearest phone. They deliver a telegram in two to four days, and by then whatever it said isn't so important\\". Despite this claimed remoteness, Lange became active in the Santa Fean cultural scene, going as far as co-founding with fellow writers Oliver LaFarge and Spud Johnson the Pasatiempo arts magazine, to which he contributed as an art critic. In the late 1980s, he moved to Friday Harbor, Washington, and then to Bandon, Oregon, where he died. He married three times and had seven children. Work Lange wrote around 50 novels, of which 13 were published, most of them action thrillers. Despite the pulpy topics and \\"overtly masculine\\" points of view, the books were well-received and his writing often praised by critics. =Vandenberg= Lange's most famous and reverberating novel was Vandenberg, a Cold War \\"near future tale\\" starring fugitives in the New Mexico wilderness after the successful invasion of the USA by the Soviets. The eponymous hero, an individualist who deserted civilization long before the Russian attack, choosing instead to live alone with his mentally disabled son in a squalid ranch, has several traits in common with the author: he is a World War II veteran, a painter, and an expert survivalist. Sprinkled across the third-person narrative abound inserts headed as \\"Communications\\", printed in italics, that transcribe Soviet files, quotations from actual writers on war (especially Robert Ardrey), and Vandenberg's own journals, in which he reflects on the easy defeat of the United States and the sheepish acceptance of the new regime by its people, condemning the American values of the novel's time as materialistic and shallow, which in turn have produced a \\"tractable, malleable...spineless people\\". Although the book's undertones, especially the hero's social views and racial profiling, strike as politically incorrect today, some reviewers at the time picked up on Lange's social criticism. The pocket edition by Bantam Books compared the self-centered, stubborn Vandenberg with the character of Galt from Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. Aside from the main plotline, the book shows a warm affection for the New Mexico countryside, which is clearly the writer's own. The local Native Americans, who have managed to endure and preserve their culture under the succeeding Spanish and American rulers, are shown able to do it under the Russians, too. Several plot points in Vandenberg somehow anticipated John Milius' 1984 film Red Dawn. Lange himself resented the film for this uncredited similarities. =Partial bibliography= * The Bitter Passion (E.P.

Composed of young missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the team played all over Australia and became widely known. One Mormon Yankees squad played exhibition games against International teams preparing for the 1956 Summer Olympics, which were held in Australia that year. History James Naismith invented the game of basketball as part of his job at YMCA. The phrase \\"muscular Christianity\\" was born as a description for using recreation for religious purposes in the early 1900s. Other churches followed suit, and by the 1930s, missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were using basketball to build bridges in various countries and communities. Beginning in 1937, LDS missionaries started playing regular organized games. The Harlem Globetrotters had just toured Australia and spurred interest in basketball — an interest noticed by the Mission President Charles V. Liljenquist. Elder Loren C. Dunn, former captain of the Mormon Yankees team in 1954, recalled, \\"After the Globetrotters visited Adelaide, President Liljenquist held a press conference and told the reporters, 'We've got somebody coming who's better than the Globetrotters'.\\" President Liljenquist was referring to Elder Dunn and assigned him to organize a competitive team of missionaries. The missionary basketball team, dubbed the 'Mormon Yankees' became stars. They were so popular and well known that the International Olympic Committee approached the team about playing against Olympic basketball teams in Australia. They played the Australian team often, and also started training the Australian basketball players. They also competed against other countries in Australia preparing for the Olympic Games. They played the Russians, Chinese (Taiwanese), Chilean, French, American and Australian Olympic teams, defeating all but the Russians and the Americans, who eventually won the Olympic silver and gold medals respectively. After the Olympics, the Mormon Yankees then traveled to Tasmania and played three exhibition games against the Chinese team, winning two out of three games. The Mormon Yankees had a positive effect for the LDS Church over the next two and a half decades. Several positive articles were published that dispelled myths about the church. During the peak of the Mormon Yankees' popularity, 1955-1960, the LDS Church in Australia tripled in size. The Yankees were influential among athletes as well, as examples in living a clean life, and not smoking or drinking.  Film adaption  Spirit of the Game is a 2016 feature film which told the story of the Mormon Yankees, starring Aaron Jakubenko as DeLyle Condie.

She married in mjd-1857 – against her parents' advice – to a brash and dissolute husband and secured his repentance not too long before his death. The religious was beatified in mid-2007 under Pope Benedict XVI though the pontiff delegated Cardinal José Saraiva Martins to preside on his behalf. Life The religious and Mother María Carmen of the Child Jesus (standing) c. 1886. María del Carmen González-Ramos García-Prieto de Muñoz was born in Málaga on 30 June 1834 as the sixth of nine children to Salvador González and Juana Ramos. She was baptized at the parish of Saint Mary Major on 1 July 1834. Her mother died on 12 July 1855 and her father died on 8 March 1871. Private tutors oversaw her education. She married on 9 May 1857 to Joaquín Muñoz del Caño – despite the objections of her parents – who turned out to be a violent and unfaithful man. Nevertheless, she saw her duties as a wife as a sign from God and suffered for Him while hoping that her husband would repent until he approached her on 15 July 1878 and announced he would be turning his life around. He begged that she forgive him for his misdeeds. Her husband died after an illness on 3 October 1881. In 1882, the Capuchin priest Bernabé de Astoraga (her spiritual director) and some female friends helped turn her home into a combination of a clinic and school where she would invite people in who needed her aid. On 8 May 1884 she began living with women she rallied at the convent of Our Lady of Victory that she founded in her hometown in a move that established the Franciscan Sisters of the Sacred Hearts. On 10 May 1884 the order received diocesan approval from Bishop Miguel Salazar Gomez while it later received papal approval after her death from Pope Leo XIII on 3 May 1902. She made her initial vows with eight others on 17 September 1884 and assumed the habit while making her perpetual profession with her new religious name on 20 February 1889. She died due to typhus on 9 November 1899. Her remains were exhumed on 9 October 1907 and later exhumed once again on 30 May 1947. Her remains at present are at the motherhouse of the order. Beatification The beatification process opened in Málaga in an informative process that was inaugurated on 2 February 1945 and it later concluded its business sometime in 1950 while theologians approved her writings on 25 November 1956. The formal introduction to the cause came on 19 December 1963 under Pope Paul VI and she was titled as a Servant of God. An apostolic process was later held from 1964 to 1965 while the newly-formed Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the process on 25 October 1969. Theologians approved the cause on 12 April 1983 as did the C.C.S. on 21 February 1984 which allowed for Pope John Paul II to confirm her life of heroic virtue and name her as Venerable on 7 April 1984. The process for a miracle was opened in early April 2003 and closed in late May 2003 and it received C.C.S. validation on 24 October 2003 before receiving the approval of a medical board on 10 March 2005 while theologians also approved it on 16 September 2005; the C.C.S. issued their own approval on 7 February 2006. Pope Benedict XVI issued the final approval for the miracle on 26 June 2006 and Cardinal José Saraiva Martins presided over the beatification on the pope's behalf on 6 May 2007 before a crowd of 10,000 people including pilgrims from countries such as Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic. The miracle involved was the 1991 cure of Sister Maria José Rodríguez who was cured of a large tumor in the liver. The current postulator to the cause is Antonio Sáez de Albeniz.

It was founded by Charles Alvey in Brisbane during 1920 making it one of the oldest family owned fishing companies in Australia.http://www.couriermail.com.au/business/carole-park-factory-owners- cry-foul-over-ipswich-council-rates-increases/news- story/65b0848f1f1b796dd6ef31e1d536a3a4http://www.couriermail.com.au/business/queensland- business-monthly-alvey-reels-in-the-years-as-iconic-manufacturer-keeps- anglers-hooked/news-story/f0d7feea6a5eed42ba6de777a84d16f8 On 20 July 2017 the company announced that it would be closing. The managing director Bruce Alvey, great grandson of the founder, said the company had \\"suffered a dramatic drop in sales, particularly in the last six months.\\" In mid 2019, Alvey was saved from closure and is still producing reels.https://www.abc.net.au/article/9680648 History The Alvey reel is accepted today throughout Australia, and in many overseas countries, as the most efficient and reliable reel marketed. It has achieved this popularity wholly on a faultless performance in the angling field. In competition fishing, often under very adverse conditions where gear must be reliable, users of Alvey reels built such an impressive record of championship wins that the superiority of the Alvey soon became well established. To trace back the history of production, it started in 1920 when Charles Alvey, an English migrant, saw the need for a fishing reel that was easy to use, easy to cast, simple to maintain, and solidly constructed to give many years of trouble-free angling. Working on the basic principle of the Scottish Malloch reel, he designed a reel which allowed the body of the reel to be turned sideways when casting, permitting the line to strip freely from the edge of a specially shaped spool. This took away the problems of backlash and overrun common to users of the multiplying type of reel. When the reel was returned to the fishing position, it afforded the best positive direct rewind of the centrepin reel, which lost favour only because of difficulty in casting. So, the Alvey reel came into being, combining easy casting and forceful rewinding. While it was revolutionary in its early stages, anglers came to recognise the advantages of using this type of reel. The original factory was a small shed without electric power in the Brisbane suburb of St Lucia, Queensland, whereby using a treadle lathe, Charles Alvey painstakingly produced about twenty reels per week. His work was so meticulous that anglers called the Alvey ‘The reel you cannot wear out’. By 1923 the demand had become so great that Charles Alvey's son Ken, a qualified pattern maker and draftsman, joined the business and a partnership was formed. Together they steered the company into the 30s, pouring all available profits back into new machinery and taking on more staff to increase production. By this time about 25,000 reels were being produced annually. The year 1939 brought the second world war and an abrupt halt to Alvey production. Machinery was converted to assist the war effort by producing vehicle and aircraft components which were to be so essential over the following six-year period. It was not until 1945 that efforts could be turned again to the manufacture of fishing reels. Also, in 1945 Charles Alvey passed away, leaving behind a devoted family to carry on the business that he had lived for. Ken Alvey's son Jack joined the firm in 1946 after obtaining his qualifications with a local engineering works. Jack also was a keen fisherman and champion distance caster, able to further the strong liaison already established between the firm and many of the top anglers of the day. This association kept Alvey in touch with the ever-changing trends and brought about quite a few modifications to the reels which were suggested by the end users. In return the Alvey Company always has maintained a strong involvement in the promotion of the sport of Angling, giving support to the National, State and Divisional organisations, as well as individual clubs and such projects as the Junior Anglers Association. The post-war demand for the product created a constant struggle to cope with necessary production. Buildings were erected and new machinery was installed, with every bit of available space used. Even with a staff of fifty people automatic machinery was introduced, and methods of production became more streamlined. By this time, overseas orders were starting to come in, adding further pressure on top of the domestic production requirements. In the early 1970s it became an absolute necessity that some future plans be made to move to larger premises, as no further expansion could be made at the St. Lucia factory. Ken Alvey died in 1973 after leading a full and successful life. He was spared the anguish of the disastrous flood early in 1974 which caused havoc in Brisbane and severe damage to the Alvey factory. Enormous effort was required to bring manufacturing back on line two months later. The clean-up was a dirty job but members of the public and many fishing club supporters donated their time and efforts to assist the Alvey family and staff in this horrid task. This temporary setback delayed the company's expansion plans; however, they were postponed, not put aside. Around this time, Jack Alvey's eldest son Bruce completed an Engineering course and joined the company. With this union, the Father and Son partnership was re-established. In 1976 the initial design for new factory and office premises appeared on the drawing board. From this point many months of consideration were given to the layout of all machinery to achieve optimum efficiency. Early in 1978 the dream started to become a reality when land was acquired in the Industrial estate at Carole Park, and tenders were called for construction. From this point things happened very quickly, and by September the building had been completed and the major shift had been accomplished. In 1987 a major expansion of the Carole Park plant was executed, taking the buildings to the maximum size allowed on the area of land. Plastic injection moulding machines were installed, and a new range of products using the latest technology emerged. This machinery allows the latest fibreglass, carbon and graphite materials to be used in the manufacture of the Alvey reels. With the purchase of the tooling for the fishing tackle items in the ‘Capstan’ range of products, Alvey became fully involved with the production and marketing of a wide range of fishing accessories such as hand casters, bait traps, bait buckets, tackle boxes, and other plastic items. This list will continue to expand in the future as we provide the anglers of Australia and around the world with value-for-money functional and reliable products. In 1988 Jack's youngest son Glenn joined the company, bringing with him computer, management and administration skills. The Alveys acquired the property next to theirs on the Carole Park industrial estate in 1990 to ensure the company's expansion in the future is never held back by lack of space. During the 1990s decade there was a major change in the methods of construction of our most popular reels. In the early 1990s the first graphite back/fibreglass 4” (100 mm) reel was designed and manufactured. An ‘Easy Cast’ system based on a very early 1930 system was developed and by using tough strong injection moulded plastics a new range of economy reels was started. The 4” (100 mm) and 5” (125 mm) models incorporating the Easy Cast system certainly proved to be what the market wanted with tens of thousands of these models being produced. Larger models in the 6” (150 mm) and 6 ½” (165 mm) were added to this range in the 1997-98 era. To retain the reputation of indestructible it was decided to retain the metal Ferguson style side cast on the larger series married with an ultra-light yet ultra-strong graphite back which literally bounces off the rocks or concrete. In 1997 a fully vented graphite blue water saltwater fly reel was added to the Alvey range in place of the older heavier metal and fibreglass SWF reel. This was well received by the market and reels were exported to USA, NZ and UK. The year 2000 saw the release of the vented 6500 series reels followed by the 6000 series in mid-2001. These reels offer anglers a lighter sportier looking reel with a substantial investment by the company into new tooling to produce these. Sadly, in June 2001 Jack Alvey passed away after a long battle with cancer. Jack was widely respected throughout the fishing community and the Queensland Manufacturing businesses. In 1999 Jack was awarded an OAM for his efforts in promoting recreational fishing and strongly supporting junior anglers wherever possible. Late 2001 saw the release of the first graphite vented 825 series boat reels. This used a graphite back and vented spool to keep weight down but still offered the angler a powerful low maintenance reel for deep sea fishing. The 825BCV Model also incorporated a rapid retrieve handle plate system. This is simply done by have the handles at different centre distances which can give you approximately 30% increase in recovery rate by using the small handle. No gears No bearings No problems. This system has now been adapted to several models with great success. In 2008 the Turbo Cast System was developed. This injection moulded component stands the reel slightly further off the rod to increase the line flow during casting which will improve distance. Being made from nylon the turning action for casting is extremely smooth and has a nice feel to the operation. This system is now available on both the 600 and 650 series of reels. 2011 saw the importing of the first ever overseas made reel. The specialist CNC machined aluminium reel float fishing reel has been very well accepted into the market. This beautiful little reel runs on dual stainless-steel ball bearings and works as well as it looks. Since 2000 Alvey have built their range of imported fishing rods to 16 Models in 2012. These cover children's rods through to surf models and now a specialist blackfish Rod. These also include 2 Telescopic rods to suit the ever-growing numbers of grey nomads who love fishing and need an easily transportable rod. 2014 saw the release of the Model 6000C8 reel. This had the traditional rolled Stainless Back with a laser cut fishtail cross and a CNC machined Anodized Alloy spool made in China for us. It also incorporated a large single plate clutch with a Carbon clutch washer.” Despite the level of popularity enjoyed by Alvey, in July 2017 the business had to make the decision to close due to a drop off in sales. However, the overwhelming public reaction to this decision provided an influx of orders which has kept Alvey thriving to this day. In mid-2019, Alvey Reels was sold to a prominent business consortium but with members of the Alvey family still continuing in senior positions in the organisation. The new business will continue to embrace the 100-year heritage of Alvey whilst introducing new technologies, products, manufacturing techniques and innovations into the range.

Lawless is a transgender woman and underwent gender reassignment surgery in 2005, before playing golf professionally. She became a professional title-holding golfer and received recognition for filing a lawsuit against the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) in 2010 for her right to compete as a woman in the women's long-drive championship.  Career  Before her gender transition to becoming Lana Lawless, she was a gang unit cop for the City of Rialto in Southern California. As an embodied man, she played golf for 21 years at a private golf club and in 2006, after her gender reassignment, she decided to compete professionally. In 2007 Lawless competed in her first world championship and returned in 2008 where she won the championship in long-drive golf.[4] In 2010, Lawless filed a lawsuit against the Ladies Professional Golfing Association (LPGA) for her right to compete as a woman in the world championship. The LPGA had a requirement that athletes must be \\"female at birth\\" in order to compete. As a transgender athlete, this meant she would be ineligible to compete. Lawless argued that this requirement violated California's civil rights law and that transsexual competitors should be allowed to compete as the gender of which they identify with. She not only sued against the LPGA but also against Long Drivers of America along with two of their sponsors and LPGA's sponsors. Ultimately, Lawless won the lawsuit and as a result the LPGA reviewed its requirement of having to be born female in order to compete and removed it.  Personal life  Although Lawless is open about being a male-to-female transgender, she chooses not to discuss her former name. She explains that she has always been Lana Lawless deep inside. Before her gender reassignment, Lawless had been married but did not have biological children.

It has been owned by Erwin Lauterbach since 2011. With a history that goes back to 1854, it is one of the oldest restaurants in the city. Built as part of a new entrance complex for the Northern Customs House area, it originally attracted a clientele of sailors, dockers and personnel from the naval base Nyholm. A locality on the south coast of Germania Land in northeast Greenland was named after the restaurant in 1907. History =Brokkens Bod= Brokkens Bod Interior from Brokkens Bod painted by Christian Andreas Schleisner in 1847 A tavern known as Brokkens Bod was from the late 17th century located at the site and would for more than a hundred years be run by the Brock family. It was one of several such establishments located at the entrance to the Customs House area. \\"Jens Brock's House at the Customs House\\" is first mentioned in tax records from 1689. The name refers to Jens Sørensen Brock who was customs officer and searcher at the customs house. On 18 March 1699, he was granted a royal license to serve beer and Danish akvavit to the public from the building. In 1708, it is referred to as \\"Niels Bock's widow's house\\" and then as \\"Jockum Brock's house on the road to the Customs House\\" in 1723. The name Brokkens Bod is first seen in records from the 1775 census. The clientele were mainly sailors and dockers from the Customs House quay and nearby Larsens Plads as well as personnel from Holmen who were ferried across the harbor on their way home to Nyboder. The building was 20 alen long and 13 alen deep and the door was so low that people had to bend over to enter Brokkens Bod competed with nearby Paradiset (Paradise), another tavern, when it came to serving the largest akvavits in town. To \\"have taken the height off Brokkens Bod\\" was once locally used as a euphemism for being heavily inebriated. Opposite Brokkens Bod was Toldbods Vinstue (The ToldbodWine House), a place frequented mainly by skippers and mates with a reputation for offering good and cheap food and accommodation. =Current buildings= Lumskebugten seen on a drawing by Andreas Juuel from the 1850s Brokkens Bod was demolished in the 1850s to make way for a new complex of buildings constructed in associated with the customs area. Like its predecessor, it was a tavern for sailors and dockers, located at one of the busiest places on Copenhagen's harbourfront. The origins of the name is unclear. It has traditionally been explained as an intentionally ambiguous reference to a term used on nautical maps meaning \\"a bay with treacherous sand, moving sand bars\\", prone to make ships ground, an effect that the tavern was also known to have on many of its customers. The validity of this explanation has, however, been questioned and it may in fact be the other way round. It has thus been impossible to find the term used on old maps while a locality on the southern shores of Germania Land in North-East Greenland was named after the restaurant in 1907. The name was proposed by Christian Bendix Thostrup, a member of the Denmark Expedition. The area gradually changed character after the old Toldbodvej (Customs House Road) was refurbished and its name changed to Esplanaden (The Esplanade). Lumskebugten then developed into a popular lunch restaurant. The prominent Danish chef Erwin Lauterbach acquired the restaurant in 2011. It reopened after a renovation in August 2012. Buildings Lumskebugten is located on the east side of a small courtyard off the north side of Esplanaden. The building on the opposite side of the courtyard was also a tavern. The two buildings were both designed by Gustav Friedrich Hetsch. He also designed the new entrance to the customs area, Lion's Gate (Løveport\\"), named for the two lions seated on the gate pillars. Just inside the gate are two guard houses with arcades flanking the street. The Lumskebugten building is attached to one of them. The larger building at the north side of the courtyard was built for the Royal Nautical Charts Archives and was also the first home of the Danish Meteorological Institute. It was built to design by Wilhelm Petersem in 1878 and is thus a little younger than the other buildings. The building now serves as head office for Mærsk Oil, a subsidiary of Mærsk which has its global headquarters on the other side of the street.

The house is listed Grade II, as is the 19th-century cast iron street light outside the house. Description 26 Rutland Gate is a four-storey, white-stuccoed house built by builder John Tombs in 1846–47. The National Heritage List for England describes the design of the house as \\"Four-bay front with four-storey canted bay window. Entrance in Tuscan closed porch with balustraded roof attached to south side. First-floor front bombé cast-iron balcony, French windows. Second- floor segmental pediments. Cornice lost. Return elevations altered.\\" The house was listed due to its status as Rutland Gate's last surviving detached villa of the 1840s. The side of the house adjoins the cemetery of the Russian Orthodox cathedral on Ennismore Gardens. History The house was not constructed for a specific client, but Tombs wrote that it would \\"be occupied by a family of the first respectability\\". The house was Tombs's last building at Rutland Gate and was first leased by a solicitor, Frederick Pratt Barlow. Barlow had previously been the initial occupant of 17 Rutland Gate. In the 1920s and 1930s, the house was the London home during the Season of the Mitford family, who acquired the lease on the house for £28,000 after selling Asthall Manor, their country house in Oxfordshire. The Mitfords were forced to give up Rutland Gate in the midst of the Great Depression, and it was initially rented from them by the Earl of Elgin, and subsequently by an American woman, a Mrs Warren Pearl. Deborah Devonshire (née Mitford) later recalled in her 2010 memoir, Wait for Me!...Memoirs of the Youngest Mitford Sister, that her mother was annoyed by Pearl's \\"painting everything, including the floors, green\\". Jessica Mitford recalled Rutland Gate in her 1960 memoir, Hons and Rebels, describing the house as reflecting \\"comfort and serviceability rather than elegance\\". The house was later used by Nancy Mitford to house evacuees from the East End of London and Jewish refugees from Poland in the Second World War. After the war, it was inhabited by Patrick de László, the son of portrait painter Philip de László. The house was acquired by the American businessman Richard Gangel in the 1960s. Gangel was the friend and business associate of Bernie Cornfield of Investors Overseas Service (IOS). Gangel turned the ballroom at 26 Rutland Gate into a cinema as part of what the Survey of London called a \\"Hollywood-style remodeling of the interior\\"; the survey also described the house as \\"attracting some attention for the extravagance of its decorations and fittings\\". The house was put up for sale for $1 million, then a record price for a property in London, following Gangel's bankruptcy after the collapse of IOS.

Donald M. McKale. Taylor Trade Publishing She was persecuted by the Bulgarian security forces, and in June 1944, injured during clashes with police in the city of Radomir, was captured and put to death. Biography Violeta Yosifovna Yakova was born into a poor Sephardic-JewishVioleta Yosifova Yakova family in Dupnitsa; her father, Yosef Yakov, a small trader, died before she was born. The difficult economic situation in Bulgaria after World War I led many Jewish families to emigrate from relatively small towns to larger population centers, and under these circumstances, her family emigrated to the capital Sofia. Violeta learned sewing and was employed as a tailor's apprentice. For many young Bulgarian Jews in the late 1930s and during World War II, idealism combined with the Bulgarian regime alignment with the Axis powers furthered a commitment to Zionist and far-left organizations, engaging in underground activities against the government, informers and German officers in Bulgaria. In 1939, she joined the youth organization of the Bulgarian Communist Party. In 1942, after Bulgaria joined the Axis and signed the Tripartite Pact, Jakova joined the underground resistance. Many young Bulgarian Jews participated in attacks in Sofia. Together, Yakova and Anjel Vagenstein burned in 1942 the Sofia Leather Jackets Factory, which produced uniforms for the German forces. Also, together with Leon Kalaora and Dano Albahara,Los judíos de Bulgaria en la lucha contra el fascismo formed a death squad who assassinated well-known antisemites, fascists and nazi informers. Out of these, Yakova was considered the most skilled fighter, who assassinated Lieutenant General Hristo LukovИстория на антифашистката борба в България, т. II 1943/1944 г., С., 1976, стр. 21 and the chief of the Bulgarian Police, Colonel Atanas Pantev. Her toughness was heard far and she became wanted by the Bulgarian security forces. At the beginning of March 1944, the Bulgarian police gathered intelligence information about the whereabouts of Yakova in her hometown of Radomir, and the police began a manhunt. Yakova was located in June and was captured after a shootout with the police, during which she was injured. She was later beaten and executed by the Bulgarian police. Monument erected in the city of Radomir. Memorial Her boldness and the circumstances of her death made Yakova one of the symbols of the resistance against the pro-fascist regime in Bulgaria, and the Communist movement idealized her name. She was declared a national hero of Soviet Bulgaria. In 1970, Vulo Radev produced a movie called Черните ангели (Black Angels), whose plot is about the assassination of Bulgarian military officers by young communist partisan fighters, and in which Yakova has a central role. She is the physical killer of Hristo Lukov. The city of Radomir has erected a monument in her memory.

History Copper plate inscriptions dated 1645, 1652, 1655 and 1656 are the most important artefacts about the Piramalai Kallars. According to these, during the period of Thirumalai Nayak, members of the community were appointed as guards (\\"kavalkarars\\") of villages.The Piramalai Kallar group responsible for a village had to compensate for any theft in that village. Piramalai Kallar local chieftains, such as Tirumal Pinna Thevar, also performed judicial duties by organising panchayats. This is described in the 1655 inscription. With a separate system of judiciary and policing, they refused to accede to British rule. In 1767, around 5000 Kallars were killed by British forces near Melur in a single day when they refused to pay tax. With the introduction of British rule and the fall of the Nayak dynasty, the Piramalai Kallars began to lose their work as guards. They participated in the South Indian Rebellion of 1800-1801 that resulted in Madurai and the adjoining regions coming under the British rule. When the rebellious Kallars refused to pay tax, the British abolished the kavalkarar system.K. Gowri, Madurai under the English East India Company (1801 – 1857),Raj Publishers, Madurai, 1987, p.9.

The church was relocated from the historic mining town of Pine Creek. With parts of the church spread between the two towns during the move, it was once known as the \\"longest church in Australia\\". History Tennant Creek Catholic Church, date unknown During the 1930s Tennant Creek was in the midst of a gold mining boom. In 1934, to cater to the growing non- Aboriginal population, approval was granted for the establishment of a Catholic Mission Station in the Tennant Creek area. The church building was originally constructed in 1904 in Pine Creek, which is 760 km north of Tennant Creek, but by the mid-1930s the church had fallen into disrepair. In 1935 Reverend Father W.J. Dew, M.S.C. of the Darwin Parish, was asked by Bishop Francis Xavier Gsell to assess the needs of the Tennant Creek parishioners, who numbered approximately 300. Dew later wrote: > I was appointed to Tennant Creek in 1935. I went to Darwin in 1936 and > discussed the whole situation with Monsignor Gsell. He suggested me taking > the P.C. (Pine Creek) church to T.C. (Tennant Creek). So there and then I > arranged for Brother Andrew Smith M.S.C. (skipper of our Mission Boat > serving Bathurst Island and Port Keats) to come with me to Pine Creek for a > fortnight and managed in that time to dismantle the Church that was there. Father Dew undertook fundraising for the project in Adelaide and was reportedly frustrated by the lack of generosity he encountered there, particularly on one occasion when a wealthy woman replied to his request for a donation by simply saying, \\"Give my love to the miners\\". The dismantled church was railed to Birdum and then trucked the remaining distance. The trucks carrying the dismantled church were caught in floods at Daly Waters and parts of the loads were left on the roadside. Spread out along the route for some time, it became known as the \\"longest church in Australia\\". While the church was reconstructed, mass was held \\"in the residence of some local Catholic\\". The relocation was expensive, and by the time it was opened on 21 November 1937 by Bishop Raible had cost \\"many hundreds of pounds\\". The church was reconstructed in a different layout that in its original location. An office and verandahs were later built \\"on two sides to serve as accommodation for the priest\\". During World War II the church became a social centre for troops travelling the north-south road. Father Dew stayed in Tennant Creek throughout the war and was Chaplain to the 55 Australian Camp Hospital in 1944. Prior to the official proclamation of the town in 1954 it was mandatory for all those who wished to hold land in Tennant Creek to hold a miner's right. This posed difficulties for the church, but it managed to obtained a miner's right in June 1941. A Sidney Williams hut adjacent to the church was erected sometime after August 1948 as a hall. A wind-driven generator was used to light up the cross at night in 1953 during the tenure of Father Dallas Cox. Recent history The longest-serving priest was Father Taylor who held the post from 1957 to 1970. The church played a role in assisting evacuees from Darwin after Cyclone Tracy. In 1978 the Sidney Williams hut was occupied by the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul until it moved to new premises in Thompson Street in 1979. In 1980, the church was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate. The church's fame grew in 1985 when the Blessed Teresa of Calcutta, now Saint Teresa of Calcutta, paid a visit on her Australian tour. She attended a Virgil Mass at the church on Saturday 16 February. A shrine to the saint remains in the church. The church and the adjacent Sidney Williams hut were listed on the Northern Territory Heritage Register in August 2007. Father John Kennedy is the current priest.

It is produced and distributed by Upright Technologies. The Israeli company launched the product in 2015, following its development in Tel-Aviv, Israel. The smart wearable device has been referred to as both a wearable and trainable tech. The consumer device is designed to improve the wearer's posture by vibrating on the user's upper or lower back until they correct their posture. The device is paired with a free smartphone app for iOS or Android, so that the user can track the progress and receive a score each time the device is used. The recommended use varies from user to user, but typically should be worn between 5 minutes and an hour. Once the device has been used, it is suggested that it forms a new habit of good posture by building core strength and increasing one's awareness, so that good posture remains, even when the device isn't being used. Upright has received positive reviews in TechCrunch, Inc. magazine and Scientific American, as well as community notoriety amongst the Amazon reviews community. History Upright entered late testing in early 2015, before beginning to ship the device later that year. A Digital Trends article stated that the smart device would begin shipment in November 2015 for Upright customers who pre-ordered the item by October 20. The item launched with a 30-day money back guarantee, and is currently listed on the market for the price of $129.95. During the early stages of development, Upright raised over $150k on Indiegogo. In October 2015, the wearable tech company featured in Business Standard as one of the weeks listed Asian-based startups. The startup began in Tel-Aviv, Israel, where the company is still based today. Technical Upright is a device to train people to maintain a correct posture while sitting at a desk. The smart device focuses predominantly on slouching in the lower back or upper back. Sticky pads are attached to the user's back and then the device is synchronized with a free smartphone application for iOS and Android. The smartphone is then used as the controller to calibrate and configure the smart device. The retail box comes with 60 pads, with Inc. magazine stating in an interview that there should be enough pads for the buyer to see \\"significant improvements in posture.\\" During Inc. magazine's testing of the device, the device was tested for both intentional and unintentional slouching in the lower back area, both of which the device responded well, according to the review. Upright is a smart device that is not supposed to be worn all day, but for an amount each day in relation to one's personalized training programme to condition the muscles. These short periods of time wearing the device, aims to train the muscles so that posture remains strong even when the device is not being used. According to the developers at Upright, this strategy was taken so that the users don't become dependent on the device. The normal training period begins at 5 minutes each day, which then gradually builds up to longer periods of use. The strategy is that if a person uses the device for a short period at the start, but on a regular basis, they are more likely to become accustomed to sitting with a good posture and build muscle memory for this position. The Cult of Mac review stated that when the user of the device slouched, the device sent a buzzing through the pads, so the user can then correct their posture accordingly. Health Weak muscle structure or posture in the back is the second leading cause of disability in the United States, with lost wage expenditure averaging $850 billion per annum according to the Huffington Post. Around 15% of Americans visit Primary Care Providers due to health issues, which began with musculoskeletal problems. Upright aims to improve people's posture, while they are both seated or standing. The device focuses on the upper and lower back to solve slouching related issues. The smart device was created to address issues that many job roles involve sitting for long periods, which can lead to severe back problems. The Huffington Post studied the bad back diagnosis given to many who visit care providers and found that musculoskeletal conditions cost the United States over $170 billion per year. Scientific American published an article in 2015, studying Upright's beneficial impact on the user's health. The article stated, \\"Studies have linked excessive sitting, with heart disease, diabetes, and even cancer.

Roozahang or Tishtrya is Tir in Middle- and Modern Persian. As has been judged from the archaic context in which Tishtrya (Roozahang) appears in the texts of the Avesta, the divinity/concept is almost certainly of Indo-Iranian origin. Persian mythology In a hymn of the Avesta (incorporated by Ferdowsi, with due acknowledgement, in the Shahnameh), Tishter or Roozahang is involved in a cosmic struggle against the drought-bringing demon Apaosha. According to the myth, in the form of a pure white horse the god did battle with the demon who, in contrast, had assumed the form of a terrifying black horse. Apaosa soon gained the upper hand over Tishtrya, who was weakened from the lack of sufficient prayers and sacrifices from humankind. The yazata proceeded to call upon the Creator Ahura Mazda, who himself then intervened by offering a sacrifice to the overwhelmed god. Infused with the power brought by this sacrifice, Tishtrya was able to overcome Apaosa, and his rains were able to flow to the parched fields and pastures unabated by drought. This story serves to underscore the importance of votive offerings and sacrifice in religious tradition.  Etymology and cultural significance  In Iranian mythology, especially in Persian mythology and in Zoroastrianism, the ancient religion of Persia, Sirius appears as Tishtrya or Tishter https://www.vajehyab.com/dehkhoda/%D8%AA%DB%8C%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1 or Roozahang and is revered as the rain-maker divinity (Tishter of New Persian poetry). Beside passages in the sacred texts of the Avesta, the Avestan language Roozahang followed by the version Tir in Middle and New Persian is also depicted in the Persian epic Shahnameh of Ferdowsi. Due to the concept of the yazatas, powers which are \\"worthy of worship\\", Tishtrya (Tishter) is a divinity of rain and fertility and an antagonist of apaosha, the demon of drought. In this struggle, Tishtrya is beautifully depicted as a white horse. The other names The other names of Roozahang is Tishtrya, Shabahang and Varahang.Mohammad-Taqi Bahar، Research in Persian mythology، p 62 Roozahang is the God of Rainfall. It is a white, bright star and its nature is water.https://roozahang.com/AboutUs?q=5 Religious background References  Hinnells, John R. (1997).

Purpose  In engineering, modelling always serves a particular goal. For example, the lightning protection of aircraft can be modelled as an electrical circuit, in order to predict whether the protection will still work in 30 years, given the ageing of its electrical components. More and more effort can be put in making this model predict reality perfectly. However, this perfection comes at a price: researchers invest time and money in improving the model. As a Return on investment (ROI), the ROME is a metric for the use of further modelling. It may therefore serve as a 'stopping criterion'. Typically, researchers will pull towards continuing modelling, while management will pull towards stopping modelling. Being explicit about the cost and benefits of continued modeling may help to make informed decisions that are understood by both sides.  Domains  ROME is a metric, which can be evaluated wherever modelling is performed with a business goal. Examples include: * Modeling a marketing mix to statistically correlate a number of inputs (or independent variables) – such as a marketing campaign – to outcomes (or dependent variables) – such as sales or profits. * Modeling the links between enterprise actors to make an informed choice on splitting organisations. * Modeling the coupling of an electromagnetic interference to a PCB to reduce its susceptibility by improving the routing of traces.

Keller (born March 5, 1938) is an American educational psychologist. He is best known for his work on motivation in educational settings and in particular the ARCS model of instructional design. The four elements of the acronym stand for Attention, Relevance, Confidence and Satisfaction (ARCS). Education and career Keller was born on March 5, 1938. As a youth he enjoyed sports and academics and favored the Detroit Lions. Two fellow aqaintances of his were Bartosz Woodniki, and Langston Ford. Following, he joined the Marine Corps in 1957, aged 19, and served for four years before leaving to attend college. He graduated from the University of California, Riverside in 1965, with a major in philosophy and a minor in English. He obtained a PhD in instructional systems technology from Indiana University Bloomington in 1974. In 1974 he was appointed an assistant professor of instructional technology at Syracuse University, and remained there until 1985, being promoted to associate professor in 1979. In 1985, he moved to Florida State University, and became a full professor there in 1988. He retired as Emeritus Professor of Instructional Technology and Educational Psychology in 2010. ARCS model Keller is best known for the ARCS (\\"Attention, Relevance, Confidence and Satisfaction\\") model of instructional design, which he first introduced in 1979. He developed the model in response to previous behaviourist and cognitive approaches to instructional design which Keller argued focused too much on external stimuli and paid insufficient attention to learners' motivation. His ARCS model broke learner motivation down into four components (attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction) and provided strategies for instructors to incorporate each into their courses, thereby encouraging learner motivation. The ARCS model has been widely applied and became a \\"central reference\\" for subsequent research into learner motivation.

His heir was Robert Mowbray, who forfeited his estates to the crown for rebelling against King William II, who regranted many of the Somerset estates to the Mohun family, henceforth feudal barons of Dunster.

Dr. James Jefferis (4 April 1833 – 25 December 1917) was an English Congregational minister with a considerable career in Australia. History Jefferis was born in St Pauls, Bristol, England, the elder son of carpenter James Jefferis and his wife Sarah Jefferis, née Townsend. He was educated at Bristol Grammar School and resolved to join the Christian ministry. He was offered financial support by a wealthy relative for study at Oxford or Cambridge as an entry into a Church of England benefice, but he was attracted to the freedom of thought permitted Congregational ministers, and in 1852 entered New College, a Congregational institution at St. John's Wood, where he earned his BA with honours in the Greek Testament, botany, and animal physiology in 1855, and the Law subjects the following year, though in England he could not be awarded the LLB. without legal training. Towards the end of his course he was offered a missionary position in India by the London Missionary Society. Family circumstances made this impractical, and he opted instead the pastorate of Saltaire, in Yorkshire, where a beautiful new Congregational church had just been completed, with funds provided by Sir Titus Salt. The work was most congenial to him, but his lungs were badly affected by the inclement weather and his doctors, diagnosing tuberculosis, recommended he move to a milder climate. He received an invitation from T. Q. Stow to help found a Congregationalist church in genteel and influential North Adelaide. Accordingly he left England in midwinter, 1859, for South Australia, arriving in April 1859. Preparations for the new Brougham Place church were well under way, and until the building was completed, services were held at New Hall, Tynte Street. The congregation moved into the new building in February 1861, and was soon swelled by Christians of other denominations, attracted by his \\"eloquence and manly and liberal approach to religion\\". > His name stands for freedom of thought and action; he is a man who is of > value to all, and in whom his countrymen may be said to delight. He is a > preacher of large attainments and broad sympathies. His delivery is very > forcible and happy, his enunciation clear and distinct; and in prayer he is > unaffected and fervid. It is no wonder that Dr. Jefferis fixes the > attention. and compels respect. He tried to get the church interested in setting up a first-class non- sectarian school system, perhaps on similar lines to J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution, but gained little support, and thenceforth he was a staunch advocate for free, compulsory, publicly funded education (but with Religious Instruction an integral component). He was also vociferous in calling for federation of the Australian colonies. He founded the North Adelaide Young Men's Society, which proved popular, and was credited with having a powerful influence for good. Jefferis was a consistent advocate for higher education, and took a leading role in the founding in 1874 of Union College, an Adelaide University college devoted to the training of Protestant ministers, largely funded by Sir Walter Hughes. Jefferis served there as Professor of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, and in 1872 was appointed Professor of Ecclesiastical History at the University, and he was one of the first members appointed to the Senate of the University, a position he retained until 1917. He was at Brougham Place Church for 18 years, and during that time wrote many leading articles for the Adelaide press. He was offered an editorship with The Advertiser in 1876, but was not interested. He several times refused calls to take over Sydney's Pitt Street Congregational Church, but in 1877 acquiesced, and preached his first sermon there on Easter Sunday. He was an immediate \\"hit\\" with the Press, who generously reported his successes, even publishing the text of his sermons and lectures. The Pitt Street church was built to accommodate over 2,000 people, but it was repeatedly packed to overflowing with people of all denominations who flocked to hear his courses of lectures. He abolished pew rents, which he felt ran counter to the democratic ideals of Congregationalism. He extended the church's evangelical outreach to the residents of Sydney's slums. But he was over-extending himself, spending so much time and effort on public appearances that he was neglecting his pastoral responsibilities. He served there for 13 years, with a stipend of ₤1,000 (perhaps $200,000 in today's money), but Mrs. Jefferis was in poor health, and desired to return to her family in England, so in December 1889 he resigned and they travelled back to the \\"old country\\". In September 1890 he took charge of the New College Chapel, St. John's Wood, and soon made his influence felt. But London's weather affected the health of both Mr. and Mrs. Jefferis, and they removed to the milder climate of Torquay in Devonshire, where he served the Belgrave Congregational Church, which was suffering from a prevailing atmosphere of \\"churchism\\" and sacerdotalism, philosophies which were inimical to Congregationalism in general and Dr. Jefferis in particular. While at Torquay he received calls to return to Australia, two from Sydney and one from his old church in Adelaide, which he accepted, and after two and a half years at Torquay and an absence of 18 years he returned to Adelaide, where he had been happiest. He had the building renovated, and under his tutelage the church's considerable debt was almost cleared. But he was no longer the vibrant speaker of his youth, he had become more conservative and no longer the active free-thinker who had so inspired young men in his earlier days. In 1900 he engaged a younger Welsh pastor, W. H. Lewis, to share his workload and stipend of ₤500. On 17 April 1901 he retired from public life, having served the Brougham Place church for 26 years, and Congregationalism for 43. His retirement was spent reading, studying, walking and beachcombing. No longer entitled to a manse, he built \\"Elbury House\\" on Tyne Street, Gilberton, and around Christmas 1894 purchased \\"Yelki\\", a house on Encounter Bay, as a summer retreat. It was once the \\"Fountain Inn\\", South Australia's first licensed premises. After her husband's death, Mrs Jefferis sold \\"Elbury House\\", and lived permanently at \\"Yelki\\", which remained in the family for many years. He enjoyed good health almost to the last, and was effusive in his praise for Australian weather. Recognition The University of Adelaide's Jefferis Memorial Medal for Philosophy was named in his honour. One recipient was his grand-daughter, the noted author Barbara Jefferis. The Jefferis Memorial Church was built on Encounter Bay, on land donated by Mrs. Jefferis, adjacent to \\"Yelki\\". Family He married Mary Louisa Elbury (c. 1832 – 3 April 1864) in Bristol on 21 October 1858.

In addition to its ordinary policing duties, it was a para-military organisation, which saw active service in several campaigns and operations, including the Anglo-Boer War (1899–1902). The force was fully militarised in 1913 and transferred to the new South African Army as a mounted rifle regiment. Background The formation of the Cape Police followed a four-year period of warfare in southern Africa, which included the 9th Frontier War (1877–78), the Northern Border campaigns (1878–79), the Morosi campaign in Basutoland (1879), the Basutoland Gun War (1880–81) and the Transkei (a.k.a. 'Mpondomisi') Campaign (1880–81). At that time, policing in the Cape Colony was decentralised. Each district had a small \\"rural\\" police force, under direction of the resident magistrate. Cape Town had both town and water police. There were para-military mounted police forces in Griqualand West and the northern border districts. The Scanlen ministry had the Police Regulation Act passed in 1882, to enable the government to establish police forces. The Act authorised it to declare \\"police districts\\" and establish police forces for them, to preserve the peace, prevent crime and apprehend offenders.Police Regulation Act (Act 12 of 1882) (Cape). These forces were \\"chiefly intended for the detection and investigation of crime and the arrest of offenders.\\"Cape of Good Hope Government Gazette 6284 (25 August 1882) : Rules and Regulations for Police Forces. However, in the case of any war or other emergency, the government could deploy them to assist with the defence of the colony, within or beyond its borders. Although the Act did not give these police forces a specific name, they became known collectively as the \\"Cape Police\\". They were quite separate from the local forces directed by the magistrates. Cape Police: 1882–1904 =Original districts= Seven police districts were established in August and September 1882. Each was a self-contained organisation, headed by a commissioner.Cape of Good Hope Government Gazette 6284 (25 August 1882) : Government Notice 984. District 1 was in Cape Town, and was largely an urban police force. Five districts were in the eastern province, which bordered on Basutoland and the Transkeian territories, where some of the recent conflicts had taken place : District 2 (HQ : Grahamstown), District 3 (HQ : King William's Town), District 4 ( HQ : Fort Beaufort), District 5 (HQ : Queenstown) and District 6 (HQ : Wodehouse). District 7 (HQ : Kimberley)Cape of Good Hope Government Gazette 6289 (8 September 1882) : Government Notice 1045. covered the major urban area of the diamond-mining province of Griqualand West. In March 1883, the rest of Griqualand West, which had hitherto had its own police force, became District 8 (HQ : Barkly West).Cape of Good Hope Government Gazette 6350 (9 March 1883) : Government Notice 256. Finally, in June 1884, the northern border districts along the Orange River became District 9 (HQ : Upington).Cape of Good Hope Government Gazette 6499 (24 June 1884) : Government Notice 597. This replaced the Northern Border Police, which had been formed in 1880. The Cape Police were mounted, except in Cape Town and Kimberley where they were generally foot police. =Reduction in districts= Financial stringency soon caused the government to economise by closing headquarters and combining districts. From September 1884, Districts 3 and 5 were jointly commanded by one commissioner, and from 1887 he was in command of District 6 as well. From February 1886, Districts 2 and 4 were both under one commissioner. District 1 was closed in 1888.Reports of the Commissioners of Police (1888). The five police districts were then renumbered : * Districts 2 and 4 became District 1 * Districts 3, 5 and 6 became District 2 * District 7 became District 3 * District 8 became District 4 * District 9 became District 5. In March 1891, Districts 3 and 4 were placed under a single commissioner.Reports of the Commissioners of Police (1891). In 1892, the government combined Districts 1 and 2 and added more than a dozen eastern and midland magisterial districts to them to form a new District 1; and amalgamated Districts 3, 4 and 5 to form a new District 2. District 1's HQ were in Port Elizabeth and District 2's in Kimberley.Reports of the Commissioners of Police (1892). When British Bechuanaland was annexed to the colony in November 1895, it was added to District 2. 106 members of the Bechuanaland Border Police were transferred to the CP.Reports of ... the Commissioner of Police, Kimberley for the Year 1895 (1895). =Duties= Law enforcement duties were many and varied. Annual reports, tabled in Parliament, show that cases of assault, breaches of the peace, contraventions of laws and regulations, drunkenness, loitering, public nuisances, theft, trespassing and vagrancy were routine. Some districts had to contend with stock theft, diamond theft and smuggling (especially in and around Kimberley), and contraventions of the lawAct 22 of 1867 (Cape). which prohibited \\"native foreigners\\", i.e. Black men from territories outside the colony, from entering the colony without an official pass.As shown in the statistics in the annual reports from 1882 onwards. From 1884, District 7, which bordered on the Orange Free State, had to act as customs officers.Reports of the Commissioners of Police of the Several Police Districts of the Colony (1884). Districts 7 and 8 also had to deal with rioting mineworkers in 1884. In 1886, District 7 had to deal with election-related unrest. Reports of the Commissioners of Police (1886). In 1887, District 7's headquarters staff survived two attempts to poison them with arsenic, presumably to undermine law enforcement in Kimberley.Reports of the Commissioners of Police (1887). =Bechuanaland Campaign= British Bechuanaland was soon the scene of the CP's first military action. During the 1896–97 rinderpest epidemic, CP District 2 was ordered to ensure that infected livestock were killed. Batswana leaders resisted the order, leading to armed conflict and a lengthy standoff in the Langberg mountains. As the CP did not have the necessary resources, the government mobilised the defence force to end the resistance. Units of CP District 2 were attached to the military Bechuanaland Field Force for the eight-month-long operation. =Anglo-Boer War= The Anglo-Boer War followed barely two years later. The government mobilised the CP on the outbreak of war in October 1899, and placed them under military command. Both Districts 1 and 2 were in action throughout the war. Neither served as a unit, but was broken up into detachments which served with British and Cape military formations in many parts of the colony, and in the neighbouring Boer republics. Operations included the defence of Kimberley during the three-month-long siege (October 1899 to February 1900); the defence of Mafeking during the seven-month-long siege (October 1899 to May 1900); operations in and around the Calvinia district (December 1900 to January 1901); operations in the Transkei (July and August 1901); and the pursuit of General Smuts' commandos (September 1901 onwards).Stirling, J. (1907). The Colonials in South Africa 1899-1902. The CP were also responsible for guarding prisoners of war. Nine members were decorated for war service, and many were mentioned in despatches. Sgt Maj Alexander Young was awarded the Victoria Cross (August 1901). District 2 launched a monthly journal, The Bandolier, in October 1900.The Bandolier Vol 1 No 1 (1 October 1900). The CP re-established a presence in Cape Town towards the end of 1901. It opened a training depot at Maitland, and the whole of the Cape Peninsula became District 3 shortly afterwards.The Bandolier Vol 1 No 15 (1 December 1901). In 1902, part of District 2 was added to District 3. From 1902, District 2 used camels for patrolling the Kalahari region of its district.Report of the Commissioners of Police (1902). Cape Mounted Police: 1904–1913 =Consolidation= After the war, the government consolidated the three districts into a single police force. Lt Col Macleod Robinson, who was already commissioner of Districts 2 and 3, was given command of District 1 too. On 1 April 1904, the three districts were amalgamated under Robinson's command, and the CP was renamed Cape Mounted Police.Cape of Good Hope Government Gazette 8636 (1 April 1904) : Government Notice 350. At the same time, the government established an 'Urban Police District', comprising the urban police elements in the Cape Peninsula, Grahamstown, Kimberley, and other towns. Cape of Good Hope Government Gazette 8638 (8 April 1904) : Government Notice 365. District Inspector Robert Crawford was appointed commissioner.Cape of Good Hope Government Gazette 8642 (22 April 1904) : Government Notice 408. As this fragmented district proved unsatisfactory, most of the towns concerned were transferred to the CMP, and Cape Town and Kimberley each became an UPD in its own right.Report of the Commissioner of Urban Police (1904). Crawford was commissioner of the Cape Peninsula UPD and, from 1909, of the CMP too.Kilpin, E.F. (Ed) (1910). Cape of Good Hope Civil Service List 1910. =Herero Wars= During the Herero Wars (1904-08), the CMP had to deploy additional men to guard the border with German South-West Africa, to control the influx of refugees, and to stop gun- running from the Cape to the warring parties.Green, Lawrence G. (1948). To The River's End. =Ferreira Raid= In November 1906, an armed gang led by the Ferreira brothers entered the northern Cape from German South West Africa, with the object of stirring up anti-British rebellion. The gang attacked a CMP outpost at Abeam, killing a policeman. With the support of the Cape Mounted Riflemen, the CMP captured the gang. =Morenga expedition= In September 1907, at the request of the government of German South West Africa, the CMP tracked down the Herero resistance leader Jacob Morenga, who had escaped to the Cape Colony and taken refuge in the Kalahari. A CMP detachment under Major Heathfield Eliott, cornered Morenga near Witpan, and killed him in the ensuing shootout. Eliott was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and a German order, and the South West African government gave the CMP men a campaign medal for the operation.Alexander, E.G.M., Barron, G.K.B and Bateman, A.J. (1986). South African Orders, Decorations and Medals. =Final years= When the Cape Colony was incorporated into the new Union of South Africa in May 1910, the CMP and the UPDs were placed under the control of the new national ministry of justice. The Permanent Force and the South African Police were established on 1 April 1913. The CMP were fully militarised and transferred to the Permanent Force as the '5th South African Mounted Riflemen', while the UPDs were transferred to the South African Police. The 5th SAMR was disbanded in April 1920 and its members were transferred to the SA Police.

She was what today is defined an \\"Hereditary Witch\\" as she learned witchcraft from her grandmother and her mother who were both witches too, and taught her the craft in her early years. She was a sixth generation witch, and a third generation astrologer. She studied from private tutors, and she was able to speak many different languages including, Latin, French, and Italian.*Guiley, Rosemary. The Encyclopedia of Witches and Witchcraft.

The invitation was extended because she had produced festivities in fourteen separate communities for a Los Angeles Birthday celebration, so the county asked her to do for them what she had done for the City, that was to generate tremendous positive media exposure for it, good publicity. The Hollywood Bowl was planning a series of 12 summer concerts for Sunday afternoons, which the title was \\" Twelve Summer Sunday Concerts at the Hollywood Bowl\\". The first concert they had planned which opened the season in the summer of 1968 was called \\"Folklore Day\\". She cast a spell to increase the sexual vitality of the entire County. At that time Los Angeles County had 78 Cities. She was given the official title of \\"Official Witch of Los Angeles County, right one week before the spellcast took place. She was given a legal document, a certificate that stated she was designed that way because of her supernatural powers. The certificate was affixed with the County Seal and was signed by the Chairman of the Board of County Supervisors, at that time, Ernest Debs. On the day of the event, 11.000 people were at the Hollywood Bowl for the Spellcast. Red candles, salt and garlic were distributed to people who chanted all together a spell led by Louise Huebner on stage. Members of the neo-pagan Wiccan movement were somewhat upset by Louise Huebner, for she was not a part of their emerging movement, and tended to perpetuate what they felt were negative stereotypes of witches.*Guiley, Rosemary.

It is a slender ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and one or two short-lived, orange-tipped, white flowers on a thin, wiry spike. Description Caladenia aurantiaca is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf, long and wide. There are one or two white, orange-tipped flowers on a thin, wiry, sparsely hairy spike high, each flower wide. The dorsal sepal is erect in the lower part but curves forward, partly covering the column. It is oblong, long and wide. The lateral sepals are narrow lance-shaped, long, wide, turn downwards and are usually parallel to each other. The petals are about the same size as the sepals and spread widely or turn downwards. The labellum is egg-shaped, about long, wide with three lobes. The lateral lobes are erect, surround the column and have slightly wavy edges. The mid-lobe is triangular, curves downward with up to 3 pairs of short, orange calli along its edge. There are two rows of calli along the centre of the labellum. The column is pale green is broad with broad wings. Flowering occurs from August to November but the flowers are self-pollinating and are only open for up to four days. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Richard Rogers in 1922 and given the name Caladenia carnea var. aurantica. The description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia and the type specimen was collected near Alberton. In 1947, Herman Rupp raised it to species level and published the change in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. The specific epithet (aurantiaca) is a New Latin word meaning \\"orange\\". Distribution and habitat Caladenia aurantiaca grows in near-coastal areas east of Melbourne in moist heath on sandy soils. It has also been seen on Deal Island in Bass Strait.

He is a former student leader at Great Zimbabwe University. In the first semester of his first year at Great Zimbabwe University he was elected and became a Faculty of Commerce Board member where he represented to students. He did a sterling job in airing the student grievances among them the issue of general degrees which students felt where inferior compared to the degrees offered by other State Universities in the rest of the country. Student council By end of the first year he was elected and became the Legal and Academic Affairs Committee member in the Student Representative Council. During this period was the time when he was first arrest by the police for addressing students at the Masvingo Polytechnic Campus encouraging students to join in the stay away called by ZCTU. He was beaten by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) and questioned by officers from the President's office the dreaded Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO). The interrogation by the CIO a chilling experience in his own words Disciplinary committee In February 2007 Mugwiji together with Edison Hlatshawayo, Everson Zhou, Nicholas Govo and George Makamure they are hauled before a disciplinary committee hearing for leading demonstrations against the decision by University administration to nullify election results because pro-admin students had lost the election. That month again he is arrested in Masvingo City for distributing MDC fliers with other university student activists. On 2 April 2007 Mugwiji together with Edison Hlatshwayo and 21 others appear before a disciplinary committee hearing, in the case of petitioning the Resident Minister to make education affordable for all at his offices in the city.Edison and 22 others appear before a disciplinary committee hearing, in the case of petitioning the resident Minister in march to town. In April Mugwiji and Hlatshwayo are arrested again for leading protests over the closure of catering services at the Great Zimbabwe University. They are barred from entering the University campuses. On the 17th of the same month they are both suspended from University. They longer can participate in any academic activities thus they seize to be legitimate students simply for expressing their opinions. On 18 June 2007 Whitlaw together with Edson they are brutally assaulted by campus security officers and suspected Central intelligence officers as they sat for their end of semester examinations. Whitlaw is badly injured and is hospitalised at Masvingo General hospital later transferred to Harare for better treatment. Beginning of the following month they took the College to court through their lawyer Hwacha in a bid to challenge the decision to bar them from writing their examinations. The court ruled that the college must allow the two students to sit for their examinations without interference and gave the college up to the 9th of August to comply with the order. Unfortunately for the students Robert Mugabe, the Chancellor to most Universities, gave direct instructions to the Vice Chancellors to ignore court orders. In Harare, High Court Judge Ben Hlatshwayo ordered the University of Zimbabwe to reverse the eviction of over 4000 students from their halls of residence. But Vice Chancellor Levi Nyagura defied the order, telling one suspended student that Mugabe had told him the judge who made the decision should be prepared to accommodate the students at his house. In September 2007 when the government wanted to introduce a cadetship programme where students would receive funding for their education but would be compelled to work for the state for a certain period. Whitlaw Mugwiji and his executive organised students to protest against these measures and he was arrested together with his Secretary General Edison Hlatshwayo, Ogylive Makova, Courage Ngwarai and Thomas Chanakira. Everyone else was released except Whitlaw Mugwiji and Courage Ngwarai who were eventually released after spending three nights in the cells. Expulsion Mugwiji together with his Secretary General were finally served with expulsion papers and informed that they could not enrol at any other tertiary institution in Zimbabwe. The worst punishment for any student leader. After his expulsion he remained a general councillor under Zimbabwe National Students Union playing an active role in leading and organising student protests across the country. This led him to be a target for the regime. During this time he was under severe persecution from the state machinery. He was arrested countless times for frivolous reasons and at times under cooked up charges In 2008 Mugwiji ran for the Secretary General of the Zimbabwe National Executive Council and was thoroughly defeated by Lovemore Chinoputsa. In the very same year he got a scholarship to go and study International Business Economics at the Maastricht University.

In 2001, SÚRAO assumed the status of a government agency. The Authority is headed by its managing director, Dr. Jiří Slovák (since 2014). The governing body of SÚRAO consists of its Board which is made up of representatives from the government, radioactive waste producers and the general public. The managing director and members of the Board of SÚRAO are directly appointed by the Minister of Industry and Trade.  SÚRAO's activities  The mission of the Radioactive Waste Repository Authority is to ensure the safe disposal of radioactive waste in the Czech Republic in accordance with requirements concerning the protection of the population and the environment from any harmful effects. SÚRAO's principal responsibilities include: * the safe operation of existing radioactive waste repositories; * preparation for the construction of a deep geological repository for high- level waste; * maintaining records of accepted radioactive waste and its producers; * management of levies paid by radioactive waste producers to the Nuclear Account; * ensuring and coordinating research and development in the field of radioactive waste management; * provision of services in the field of radioactive waste management. SÚRAO's activities are directed principally by provisions set out in the Atomic Act and its various implementing regulations, the Concept of Radioactive Waste and Spent Nuclear Fuel Management in the Czech Republic and other relevant legislation. In addition, the treatment of radioactive waste is subject to international treaties and recommendations relating to the use of nuclear energy and ionising radiation which have been adopted by the Czech Republic.  Existing repositories  The Czech Republic currently has three radioactive waste repositories in operation: The Richard repository located in the former limestone mine of the same name near Litoměřice (60 km north west of Prague), the Bratrství repository located in a former uranium mine near Jáchymov (140 km north west of Prague) and the Dukovany repository located within the Dukovany nuclear power plant complex (200 km south east of Prague). The Hostim repository near Beroun (Central Bohemia) ceased operation more than 50 years ago. = Richard repository = The repository covers a total area of 16 hectares and is located near the town of Litoměřice. The surface area contains the operations building, an information centre, a laboratory and a fully accredited facility for the testing of waste containers and so-called special form radioactive materials. The total available volume of the former mining complex exceeds 17,000m3, while the underground capacity which has been designed specifically for the storage of waste comprises 10,250m3; the remainder is made up of service corridors and other service areas. The Richard repository is intended primarily for the storage of so-called institutional waste which is generated by the health, industry, agriculture and research sectors. Items disposed of include contaminated work clothes, damaged emitters and syringes. = Bratrství repository = The Bratrství repository at Jáchymov is located in one section of the underground complex of an abandoned former uranium mine of the same name. The repository itself makes up only a small part of the mining works which takes up a total area of 9.8 square kilometres with more than 80 km of tunnels and crosscuts. Since its commissioning the Bratrství repository has been reserved solely for waste containing natural radionuclides. Waste of this category is created mainly in the decommissioning of certain types of emitters used in the health care and research sectors. The repository has a radioactive waste storage capacity of around 360m3 which will soon be exhausted. The final date and method of closure of the repository will be dependent on the future volume of stored radioactive waste; notwithstanding, decommissioning is planned for around 2020. = Dukovany repository = The Dukovany surface repository occupies an area of 1.3 hectares within the Dukovany nuclear power plant complex and was designed specifically for the disposal of low- and intermediate-level waste from the Dukovany and Temelin nuclear power plants. The total volume of storage space amounts to 55,000 cubic meters, i.e. enough for around 180,000 waste drums. This capacity will be sufficient for the storage of all the operational waste produced by both plants even if their planned lifetimes should be extended to 40 years. The Dukovany repository provides for the storage of both liquid and solid radioactive waste. Solid waste includes contaminated protective clothing, cleaning cloths, packaging materials, paper, foil, electrical installation materials, construction debris etc.; liquid radioactive waste consists of waste water.  Deep geological repository for spent nuclear fuel and high- level waste in Czech Republic  Every year Czech nuclear power plants produce approximately 80 to 100 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel. The State Energy Concept, drawn up by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, presumes that the production of nuclear power will increase in the future. Whether produced by currently operational or future new reactors, there will always be sources of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste to be disposed of. At present, the potential exists to reprocess spent nuclear fuel for further use in certain types of reactors. Nevertheless, high-level waste will still be produced which will eventually have to be disposed of and isolated from the environment. Therefore, even those countries that reprocess spent nuclear fuel (e.g. France) are building deep geological repositories. In addition, the responsibility to dispose of one's \\"own\\" waste is, in most states, including the Czech Republic, reflected in relevant legislation which prohibits the import and storage of radioactive waste and the export of such waste from other countries. Hence, it is essential that the Czech Republic constructs its own deep geological repository. The deep geological repository will provide a facility in which high-level waste will be safely stored and isolated from the environment for hundreds of thousands of years thanks to the so-called multi- barrier system which is made up of a natural barrier (the rock mass which will remain stable for several million years) and technical (or engineered) barriers, e.g. the waste container. = Safety = The key to both the construction and long-term safety of the deep geological repository rests in the selection of the most suitable site. It is necessary that the various rock property requirements be fully met in addition to a number of other equally important conditions including local public acceptance, the technical potential for the construction of the complex surface area of the repository and accessibility. In order to ensure the safety of the repository, it will be necessary, from the geological point of view, to find a stable rock formation, determine its origin and evolution over tens to hundreds of millions of years and ascertain that the rock mass will maintain the desired geological properties for the required length of time. The search for a suitable site for a deep geological repository commenced shortly after the commissioning of the first nuclear units at the Dukovany nuclear power plant, i.e. in the 1980s. In the 1990s the first study was conducted aimed at evaluating the potential of the geological conditions of the whole of the Czech Republic. At that time international research and experimentation began aimed at identifying the most appropriate materials and methods with concern to the construction of both the repository itself and the engineered barriers. Thanks to the multi-barrier system (a system of complementary natural and man-made barriers that completely prevents, or at least minimises, the escape of radionuclides for a period of hundreds of thousands of years), deep repositories represent the safest way in which to dispose of high-level radioactive waste.  Radioactive waste  Radioactive waste is generated when working with radioactive materials and is defined by the Atomic Law as \\"objects or equipment containing or contaminated by radionuclides for which no further use is foreseen\\". It can be classified according either to origin or quantity of radionuclides contained (i.e. activity level). = Classified according to origin = * Waste from the nuclear power sector - liquids, slurries, equipment and materials which have come into contact with radionuclides at nuclear power plants; in the future it will also include spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste that cannot be stored in existing repositories. * Institutional waste - created in the medical, industrial, agricultural and research sectors including e.g. old measuring equipment and radioactive emitters, contaminated work clothing, fabrics, paper, syringes, etc. = Classified according to activity level = * Low-level waste - containing small amounts of radionuclides which can be stored in surface repositories. * Intermediate-level waste - containing greater amounts of radionuclides than low-level waste but which, unlike high-level waste, release only a small amount of heat. * High-level waste – highly radioactive materials that emit significant amounts of heat. Cooling and shielding is necessary so as to protect the environment from their potential adverse effects. Safe disposal is possible only in deep geological repositories. The nuclear power sector and smaller generators in the Czech Republic produce approximately 450 tonnes of low- and intermediate-level waste per year; approximately 100 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel is produced annually.  History of radioactive waste storage in Czech Republic  The history of radioactive waste storage goes back to the mid-20th century. Radioactive waste began to accumulate in the early stages of the nuclear arms race (during the Cold War) and, particularly, due to the rapid development of the nuclear power sector in the 1960s and 70s (the Czechoslovak authorities took the first steps towards the construction of the Dukovany nuclear power plant as early as in 1970). Scientists were thus confronted with the question of where to dispose of the waste so that it would have no harmful effects on humans or the environment. = Low- and intermediate-level waste = The problem of the disposal of low- and intermediate-level waste was soon successfully resolved through the introduction of storage in surface repositories. The first such facility in the Czech Republic consisted of the now-closed Hostim radioactive waste repository located three kilometres east of Beroun (Central Bohemia). The actual operation of the Hostim facility lasted only for a short time; the first waste packages were delivered to the repository by the Institute for the Research, Production and Use of Radioisotopes in 1959 and operation ended on 9 August 1965, whereupon the State assumed responsibility for the facility. The second repository to be opened consisted of the Richard (near Litoměřice) facility which remains in operation to the present day. As with Hostim, the Richard repository is located in a former limestone mine. During World War II the Nazis partially reconstructed the underground complex as a factory for the production of car parts. The first official proposal to use the Richard II mining complex for the storage of radioactive waste was put forward in 1959. Low- and intermediate-level institutional radioactive waste has been stored at the repository since 1964. In 1974, ten years following the opening of the Richard repository, the Bratrství repository was put into operation. Situated in a reconstructed former uranium mine near Jáchymov, the Bratrství facility serves for the storage of radioactive waste containing only natural radionuclides. The Dukovany radioactive waste repository, which is situated within the complex of the nuclear power plant of the same name, is the most recently opened Czech repository. The construction of the facility commenced in 1987 and it has been in operation since 1995. Dukovany is primarily used for the storage of waste generated through the production of electricity (i.e. not for the storage of spent nuclear fuel or high-level waste). SÚRAO has been responsible for the operation of the Richard, Bratrství and Dukovany repositories since 2000 and is also responsible for the safety monitoring of the now-closed Hostim repository. = Spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste = During the construction phase of the first nuclear power plants in Czechoslovakia (during the communist era), it was assumed that spent nuclear fuel would be transported free of charge to the Soviet Union. Following the political changes of 1989, however, it became apparent that spent nuclear fuel would have to remain in Czechoslovakia (later the Czech Republic). Therefore, in 1992 the Ministry of the Economy was charged with developing a new radioactive waste management concept which included the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel. Two years later, the Ministry of the Economy established the Council for the Coordination of the Development of a Deep Geological Repository, subsequently abbreviated to the Council of Six (the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of the Economy, ČEZ, a.s. (the Czech Power Company), the Ministry of the Environment, the State Office for Nuclear Safety and ÚJV (Nuclear Research Institute) Řež, a.s.). This development provided the impetus for the creation of the Czech Republic's own nuclear waste disposal concept. The Atomic Act of 1997 established the Czech Radioactive Waste Repository which, in addition to assuming all obligations relating to the operation of near-surface radioactive waste repositories, also assumed responsibility for the radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel concept. In 2002 the government approved the concept and thus officially declared that the basic strategy of the Czech Republic involved the direct disposal of spent nuclear fuel in a deep geological repository. Similar developments were also witnessed abroad. In the 1990s those countries producing high-level waste came to the consensus that the disposal issue needed to be addressed. After years of research, the majority of states which produced electricity by means of nuclear power plants, agreed that the best way to store spent nuclear fuel was in deep rock formations. This option meets both safety and technical feasibility conditions and, moreover, is economically viable.

With a history dating back to the early 1770s, it is one of the community's oldest farm properties, and is also significant for its association with Justus Sherwood, a major in Vermont's Revolutionary War-era history. The property, which now includes buildings dating from the mid-19th to early-20th centuries, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Description and history The Bottum Farm is located in a rural area of northern New Haven, and now consists of bounded on the east by North Street and the south by Quarry Road. The farm complex stands on the west side of North Street, and includes a house, dairy barn, carriage barn, garage, smithy, and granary. The house is a Greek Revival 2-1/2 story wood frame building, with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. Its corners are pilastered, and its entries are framed by pilasters. The interior, although somewhat altered, retains a number of original Greek Revival finishes, and many of the windows are also original, with period storm windows. with The land that became Bottum Farm was first acquire by Justus Sherwood in 1774, who purchased the land from the Onion River Company of Ira and Ethan Allen. Sherwood was a Loyalist during the American Revolution, and transferred title to the land to his in-laws, the Bottums, to avoid its confiscation after he joined the British Army. Sherwood was instrumental in organizing the town of New Haven during his relatively brief residency (two years) on the farm, and played a significant role in British conduct of the war from Quebec. The New Haven lands were the only holdings of his not confiscated by the state. The Bottums continued to farm the land until 1958.

It can be used to model the relationship between an agency and its environment(s), and these may include other interactive agencies. The nature of that interaction is determined by both the agency's external and internal attributes and constraints. Internal attributes may include immanent dynamic \\"self\\" processes that drive agency change.  History  Stafford Beer coined the term viable systems in the 1950s, and developed it within his management cybernetics theories. He designed his viable system model as a diagnostic tool for organisational pathologies (conditions of social ill-health). This model involves a system concerned with operations and their direct management, and a meta-system that \\"observes\\" the system and controls it. Beer's work refers to Maturana's concept of autopoiesis,Maturana H.R., Varela F.J (1979). Autopoiesis and Cognition. Boston: Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science which explains why living systems actually live. However, Beer did not make general use of the concept in his modelling process. In the 1980s Eric Schwarz developed an alternative model from the principles of complexity science. This not only embraces the ideas of autopoiesis (self-production), but also autogenesis (self-creation) which responds to a proposition that living systems also need to learn to maintain their viability. Self-production and self-creation are both networks of processes that connect an operational system of agency structure from which behaviour arises, an observing relational meta-system, this itself observed by an \\"existential\\" meta-meta-system. As such Schwarz' VST constitutes a different paradigm from that of Beer. AAT is a development of Schwarz' paradigm through the addition of propositions setting it in a knowledge context.Yolles, M.I., 2006, Organizations as Complex Systems: an introduction to knowledge cybernetics, Information Age Publishing, Inc., Greenwich, CT, USA  Development  AAT is a generic modelling approach that has the capacity to anticipate future potentials for behaviour. Such anticipation occurs because behaviour in the agency as a living system is \\"structure determined\\",Maturana, H.R., 1988, Reality: the search for objectivity or the Quest for a compelling argument. Irish J. Psych. 9:25-82 where the structure itself of the agency is responsible for that anticipation. This is like anticipating the behaviour of both a tiger or a giraffe when faced with food options. The tiger has a structure that allows it to have speed, strength and sharp inbuilt weapons to kill moving prey, but the giraffe has a structure that allows it to acquire its food in high places in a way the tiger could not duplicate. Even if a giraffe has the speed to chase prey, it does not have the resources to kill and eat it. Agency generic structure is a substructure defined by three systems that are, in general terms, referred to as: * existential (pattern of thematic relevance that is the consequence of experience); * noumenal (representing the nature of a phenomenal effect subjectively through conceptual relationships) * phenomenal (maintaining patterns of context related structural relevance connected with action, and constituting an origin for experience). These generic systems are ontologically distinct; their natures being determined by the context in which the autonomous agency exists. The substructure also maintains a superstructure that is constructed through context related propositional theory. Superstructural theory may include attributes of collective identity, cognition, emotion, personality; purpose and intention; self-reference, self- awareness, self-reflection, self-regulation and self-organisation. The substructural systems are connected by autopoietic and autogenetic networks of processes as shown in Figure 1 below. Figure 1 - Living System formulated as a set of ontologically independent but interconnected substructural subsystems The terminology becomes simplified when the existential system is taken to be culture, and it is recognised that Piaget'sPiaget, J. (1950). The Psychology of Intelligence, Harcourt and Brace, New York concept of operative intelligence is equivalent to autopoiesis, and his figurative intelligence to autogenesis. The noumenal system now becomes a personality system, and autonomous agency theory now becomes cultural agency theory (CAT).G.A.N.D. blog http://blog.gand.biz/2016/10/cultural-agency-theory-autonomous-agency- theory/ This is normally used to model plural situations like organisations or a nation states, when its personality system is taken to have normative characteristics (see also Normative personality),Yolles, M.I., Fink, G., Frieden, R. (2012). Organisations as Emergent Normative Personalities: part 2, predicting the unpredictable, Kybernetes, 41(7/8)1014-1050)Fink, G. Yolles, M. (2014) The Affective Agency: An Agency with Feelings and Emotions, http://ssrn.com/abstract=2463283 that is, driven by cultural norms as represented in Figure 2 below. This has developed further through mindset agency theory enabling agency behaviour to be anticipated.Yolles, M.I, Fink, G. (2014). Personality, pathology and mindsets: part 1 – Agency, Personality and Mindscapes, Kybernetes, 43(1) 92-112 Figure 2 - Substructural Schema A feature of this modelling approach is that the properties of the cultural system act as an attractor for the agency as a whole, providing constraint for the properties of its personality and operative systems. This attraction ceases with cultural instability, when CAT reduces to instrumentality with no capacity to learn. Another feature is driven by possibilities of recursion permitted using Beer's proposition of viability law: every viable system contains and is contained in a viable system.Beer, S., (1959), Cybernetics and Management, English U. Press, London.  Cultural agency theory  Cultural agency theory (CAT) as a development of AAT. It is principally used to model organisational contexts that have at least potentially stable cultures. The existential system of AAT becomes the cultural system, the figurative system become a normative personality, and the operative system now represents the organisational structure that facilitates and constrains behaviour. The cultural system may be regarded as a (second order) \\"observer\\" of the instrumental couple that occurs between the normative personality and the operative system. The function of this couple is to manifest figurative attributes of the personality, like goals or ideology, operatively consequently influencing behaviour. This instrumental nature occurs through feedforward processes such that personality attributes can be processed for operative action. Where there are issues in doing this, feedback processes create imperatives for adjustment. This is like having a goal, and finding that it cannot be implemented, thereby having to reconsider the goal. This instrumental couple can also be seen in terms of the operative system and its first order \\"observing\\" system, the normative personality. So, while personality is a first order \\"observer\\" of CAT's operative system, it is ultimately directed by its second order cultural \\"observer\\" system. A development of this has occurred using trait theory from psychology. Unlike other trait theories of personality, this adopts epistemic traits that centres on values, an approach that tends to be more stable (since basic values tend to be stable) in terms of personality testing and retesting, than other approaches that use (for instance) agency preferences (like Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) that may change between test and retest. This trait theory for the normative personality is called mindset agency theory, and is a development of Maruyama's Mindscape Theory. The cognitive process by which personality is represented through epistemic trait functions (called types), can be explained through both instrumental and epistemic rationality, where instrumental rationality (also referred to as utilitarian, and related to the expectations about the behaviour of other human beings or objects in the environment given some cognitive basis for those expectation) is independent of, if constrained by, epistemic rationality (related to the formation of beliefs in an unbiased manner, normally set in terms of believable propositions: due to their being strongly supported by evidence, as opposed to being agnostic towards propositions that are unsupported by \\"sufficient\\" evidence, whatever this means). Applications of CAT could be found in social, political and economical sciences, for instance recend studies analyzed Donald Trump and Theresa May personalities.  Higher orders of autonomous agency  Stafford Beer's (1979) viable system model is a well-known diagnostic model that comes out of his management cybernetics paradigm. Related to this is the idea of first order and second order cybernetics. Cybernetics is concerned with feedforward and feedback processes, and first order cybernetics is concerned with this relationship between the system and its environment. Second order cybernetics is concerned with the relationship between the system and its internal meta- system (that some refer to as \\"the observer\\" of the system). Von FoersterVon Foerster, H (1975). The Cybernetics of Cybernetics, Biological Computer Laboratory, Champaign/Urbana, republished (1995), Future Systems Inc., Minneaopolis, MN has referred to second order cybernetics as the \\"cybernetics of cybernetics\\". While attempts to explore higher orders of cybernetics have been made,Boxer, P.J., Cohen, B. (2000). Doing time: the emergence of irreversibility, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 901(1):13–25 no development into a general theory of higher cybernetic orders has emerged from this paradigm. In contrast, extending the principles of autonomous agency theory, a generic model has been formulated for the generation of higher cybernetic orders,Yolles, M.I, Fink, G., 2015, A general theory of generic modelling and paradigm shifts: part 2 - cybernetic orders, Kybernetes, 44(2)299-310 developed using the concepts of recursion and incursion as proposed by Dubois.Dubois D.

The network of processes in this general representation of higher cybernetic orders is expressed in terms of orders of autopoiesis, so that for instance autogenesis may be seen as a second order of autopoiesis.

This interstellar \\"message in a bottle\\" was transmitted on 10 October 2016, at 20:00 UTC by the European Space Agency Cebreros (DSA2) deep-space tracking station towards Polaris; the Pole Star which is approximately 434 light years (133 parsecs) from Earth.

As of , the signal has traveled approximately .Calculated using IAU definition of light-year; distance traveled in 365.25 days, and c = 299792.458 km/sec) Concept and plan overview The non-for-profit ASREM initiative was devised and produced by artist Paul Quast in collaboration with the UK Astronomy Technology Centre, European Space Agency and the University of Edinburgh along with researchers working at the Johns Hopkins University and also the European Southern Observatory. Unlike other IRM, the transmission's stated purpose was devised for a terrestrial, 'overview effect' application; \\"to look at our civilisation's past, present and future environmental interactions on Earth by using light's 'round trip' from our planet's Pole Star as a symbolic and temporal odyssey\\". This initiative's narrative examined the 'Critical Decade' (2010-2020); a pivotal point within our civilisation's history proposed by a series of climate researchers in which present ecological decisions may irreversibly commit future generations to adversity. The worldwide public were challenged to consider their role within shaping the planet's future biosphere in the newly defined Anthropocene era while also considering approaches which may be adopted to resolve climatic/biological concerns faced on Earth today. The research purpose of this initiative and its publicly generated material (besides its resonant legacy travelling through space) was outlined by its authors as: \\"the submitted content was also accumulated to contribute to ongoing dialogue on how our civilisation collectively foresees its role within shaping Earth's future biosphere and provide a means to analyse these perspectives for cross- cultural universals between nations within further academic research.\\" An initial analysis of this submitted material has already provided a number of insights into the noösphere of participating countries with further examinations currently ongoing. As well as providing engagement with the worldwide public on these pertinent concerns, a number of climate scientists and astronomers also contributed to this initiative; submitting perspectives gained from their various fields of research conducted within Antarctica, the Arctic and other research facilities located around the world. A Simple Response Press Image Target The organisers of this transmission stated that Polaris α UMi Aa was chosen \\"due to the cultural iconography this star possesses, its tangible links to the transmissions stated ecological narrative and the possibility to provide a contemporary, environmental chapter to the Pole Star's symbology\\". In Greek, the star was known as the Cynosure (original; Kynosoura), a title which later entered the English language to denote \\"an object that serves as a focal point of attention and admiration\\" or \\"something that serves to guide\\". The Polaris planetary system, even if it exists, may not be suited for life, because it is a supergiant type F7Ib star in a triple star system [with nearby companions] which should (to present knowledge) possess very powerful stellar winds around its vicinity. In addition to this, the age of Polaris has been calculated to be approximately 70 million years and thus this star may be too young to support the development of life. Another IRM entitled Across the Universe was previously sent towards this stellar location by NASA's nearby MDSCC facility in 2008. Globe depicting transmission contributors Cebreros Deep Space Tracking Station, 10th Oct Message components This transmission consisted of four components in the order; AM → IMAGES → AM → IMAGES → AM → MES → HM * (MES) ASREM messages submitted by the worldwide public in response to the question; \\"How will our present, environmental interactions shape the future?\\" Initially, responses were limited to 156 characters which was subsequently lifted to accept the proportion of statements, proverbs, poetry and satirical messages submitted. In total, 4203 messages were submitted, of which 3775 were deemed to address this posed question and thus became the transmission's main content. These 3775 messages were submitted by individuals from 146 countries in 16 different languages. The file was wrapped into a UTF-8 format before being encoded into binary with no particular emphasis placed upon the content's potential to be deciphered by possible intercepting extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) [due to the character range and potential for interpretation]. This assumed range has been estimated to exceed 520 unique characters. The authors of this initiative have expressed intention that these contents are \\"created by Earth's inhabitants for Earth's inhabitants\\"; providing the possibility for advancing planetary perspective, stewardship and communal discourse on ecological issues. * (HM) The Honorary Mention archive contains inspirational and iconic quotes related to this initiative's purpose, submitted by individuals around the world. In total, 81 quotes by individuals such as Carl Sagan, Yuri Gagarin, Mahatma Gandhi, Paul Crutzen, Patrick Moore, Al Worden, Ban Ki-moon and Koko the gorilla were included and encoded in a similar fashion to the ASREM contributions. * (IMAGES) The ASREM image archive consisted of 70 open-source photographs which were chosen to be reflective of this initiative's ecological purpose. Images were rendered into frequency- modulated files using binary frequency-shift keying, a format that utilises universal laws of mathematics to render a two-dimensional canvas which was initially developed by Dr. Frank Drake et al. for the Arecibo message [AM]) in 1974. While the cardinality of 1,679 was chosen for the Arecibo message because it is a semiprime (product of two prime numbers), to be arranged rectangularly as 73 rows by 23 columns, the ASREM initiative rendered all transmitted images in a more complex cardinality of 381,851, to be arranged as 383 rows by 997 columns. The Arecibo message was included at intervals to serve as a Rosetta Stone template. While the transmission may be intercepted by an ETI en route to Polaris, besides the image archive, the contents may not be decipherable. In addition to this, the transmission rate was very high, ~256kbit/s at a transmitting power of 19.953 kW. This transmission was also the last initiative to utilise the frequency of 7168.0089310 MHz, the bandwidth formerly dedicated to ESA's Rosetta Mission. Potential dangers and detectability While this transmission was primarily developed to advance an 'overview effect' perspective, the initiative also served to reignite debate on the benefits, dangers and ethics of transmitting into interstellar space. Days prior to the transmission on 10 October, the British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking reiterated his concerns for contacting ETI, specifically regarding aliens' deportment. Days later, SETI scientists Seth Shostak and Douglas Vakoch presented their own individual perspectives on this subject and the greater challenges facing any potential continuation of Active SETI/METI activities. In a recent article, Douglas Vakoch, President of METI International, addressed the ASREM initiative and its relationship to themes highlighted within SETI's 'Earth Speaks', stating; \\"One of the strongest themes we see in 'Earth Speaks' is a concern with our current environmental crisis. In answering the question 'How will our present environmental interactions shape the future?' we need to reflect on what it will take to sustain Earth's civilization in the coming centuries. That can only be a good thing.\\". In addition to this, scientists from the Teen Age Message (2001), Cosmic Call (1999 & 2003) and Lone Signal (2013) IRM initiatives were also consulted and aided in advising on this transmission. Aleksandr Zaitsev, an expert in interstellar radio communication and Chief Scientist of the Radio Engineering and Electronics Institute of the Russian Academy of Science, pointed out the futility of choosing Polaris as a target considering it is a supergiant star with relatively poor potential to host alien life. Numerous climate scientists and SETI researchers were consulted during production of this interstellar initiative, all of which possessed shared or differing opinions on the use of an IRM time capsule to support an ecological endeavour. However, all researchers generally agreed upon the volatile nature of Earth's contemporary environment and the need to raise awareness and action to avert ecological crises. Public reception & project timeline Uplink of 7168.0089310 MHz ASREM signal, depicted on Cebreros consoleASREM (English version) initially launched on 30 November 2015 to coincide with the United Nations COP21 Climate Conference in Paris. It gained a large number of submissions over the duration of this summit before launching additional language options in February 2016 (German, Spanish, Portuguese, French). Subsequently, the initiative enticed further global contributions when the Russian, Mandarin and Arabic interfaces launched and again prior to the open- call end. In total, the initiative attained 3775 contributions to the ASREM archive and 81 'Honorary mentions' quotes from 146 countries in 16 languages with over 500,000 unique visitors to the website. A number of articles by global journals also discussed and examined the objectives of this initiative, all of which provided further public engagement with this interstellar time capsule.

It was never named. Context The evolution of Blaenau's passenger stations was complex, with five different railway companies providing services to the area. History From May 1882 to September 1883 the narrow gauge F&BR; was rebuilt as a standard gauge line. Narrow gauge services continued throughout the rebuilding by laying a third rail on the sleepers. At the line's northern end, however, the scale and complexity of replacing the line's terminus and goods yard made it impossible to continue to meet passengers' needs, so a temporary terminus was provided between Glynllifon Street and Cwmbowydd Road, approximately short of Diphwys. The temporary station is only mentioned in one published source, which refers to a published postcard showing a train at the station.Glynllifon Street temporary terminus, via Festipedia No hint of its existence is given in the standard work on the F&BR.; The station had no platforms, in common with all other F&BR; stations. Carriages were very low to the ground, so passengers boarded from and alighted to the trackside. Closure Narrow gauge trains ceased running on 5 September 1883 with standard gauge services beginning on 10 September 1883. The temporary station was closed permanently when the narrow gauge ended, being replaced by a permanent terminus initially known as \\"Blaenau Festiniog\\" on the site of the former Diphwys (F&BR;) terminus. The terminus was renamed Blaenau Ffestiniog Central in 1951, closed to passenger traffic in January 1960 and closed completely in January 1961. The line reopened The line through the site of the temporary station closed in 1961 but it was mothballed pending building the long-discussed cross-town link to enable trains to run along the Conwy Valley Line, through Blaenau and on to Trawsfynydd nuclear power station which was then being built. The line through the site reopened on 24 April 1964, but none of the station's facilities were brought back to life. The line closed again in 1998 as the nuclear plant was being decommissioned. Once more the route was mothballed in case a future use is found. The station site in the 21st Century By 2011 no hint of the station remained. In Spring 2016 the mothballed single track line still ran past the site to the former nuclear flask loading point. The future Between 2000 and 2011 there were at least two attempts to put the mothballed line through the site to use. In 2011 there were proposals to use the rails as a recreational velorail track. Neither this nor the earlier idea came to anything. The possibility remains that the surviving line could see future preservation or reuse by the nuclear industry. To considerable local surprise fresh moves to reopen the line from Blaenau as far south as Trawsfynydd began in September 2016, with the formation of The Trawsfynydd & Blaenau Ffestiniog Community Railway Company. On 21 September at least one regional newspaper reported that \\"Volunteers are set to start work this weekend on clearing vegetation from the trackbed between Blaenau Ffestiniog and Trawsfynydd.\\" The company was quoted as saying \\"We have been given a licence by Network Rail to clear and survey the line.\\" References =Sources=  * * Further material    * * External links * The station site on a navigable OS Map National Library of Scotland * The station and line Rail Map Online * Festiniog and Blaenau Railway, via Festipedia Category:Disused railway stations in Gwynedd Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1883 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1883 Category:Blaenau Ffestiniog ","title":"Glynllifon Street railway station"},{"id":"51884633","text":"The Lover's Lane Bridge is a historic bridge spanning the Dog River in Berlin, Vermont.

Description and history Lover's Lane is a short east-west road located in southern Berlin, joining Chandler Road to the west and Vermont Route 12 to the east, each of which run roughly parallel to the north-flowing Dog River. The bridge across the river is oriented roughly northeast-southwest, at a point where the river briefly bends to the west. It is a single-span Warren pony truss structure, in length, resting on modern concrete abutments. The truss elements are made of rolled steel joined by bolts, a replacement for original rivets. The bridge floor is also a modern replacement, consisting of rolled steel flange beams supporting a wooden deck. with The bridge was built about 1918, replacing an earlier wooden structure (probably an open wooden truss bridge). It was built at a time when Vermont's bridge construction, including local bridges such as this one, was becoming increasingly influenced by professional engineers hired by the state's Department of Transportation.

She was born in Saint-Pardoux-la-Rivière on 2 August 1955. In 1989, she formed Lacaton & Vassal with Jean-Philippe Vassal.  Education  Lacaton graduated in architecture from the and received a masters in urban planning from the University of Bordeaux in 1984. = Academic career = Anne Lacaton was appointed as Associate Professor of Architecture & Design at the ETH Zurich (2017). As an academic teacher with socio-political honesty and an ideological approach to architecture, her designs and constructions make a clear statement in support of the human rather than the iconic. She shows meaningful consideration for the concerns of the people involved, such as residents in areas undergoing redevelopment. Her design aim to promote user participation, both in residential buildings as well as schools or museums. She was Visiting Professor at the University of Madrid, Master Housing (2007–13); Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL Lausanne) (2004, 2006 & 2010-11); University of Florida, Ivan Smith Studio (2012); University of NY-Buffalo, Clarkson Chair (2013); Pavillon Neu ize OBC-Palais de Tokyo, Paris (2013–14); Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD); Kenzo Tange (2011) & Design Critic (2015). She was a keynote speaker at the 6th International LafargeHolcim Forum for Sustainable Construction in Cairo, Egypt (2019) where she presented how “Never demolish, always transform” is at the heart of the design process of Lacaton & Vassal including the renovation program of more than 500 dwellings in the Cité du Grand Parc in Bordeaux, France originally constructed in the early 1960s. Anne Lacaton was a member of the LafargeHolcim Awards jury for region Europe (2017); and will be a member of the Global LafargeHolcim Awards jury in 2021.  Projects with Philippe Vassal  A great deal of Lacaton's work has been in partnership with Phillip Vassal, the duo have worked on a number of projects together. The firm designed the Palais de Tokyo contemporary art gallery in Paris, completed in 2001. The project, a bare bones reclamation of a semi- derelict art deco building near the Seine, was short-listed for the Mies van der Rohe prize in 2003 and has been immensely influential as perhaps the most extreme of found-space galleries. Openly proclaiming to be a reflection and search for architectural economy, the work undertaken by Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal focuses on reduced-cost constructions in order to rejuvenate the dialogue with contracting authorities. Research on hybridizations, between a contemporary building concept and the use of the most diversified techniques, produces projects that make the most of construction programs by upsetting building contractors' standard usages. In 2005, Lacaton & Vassal and architect Frédéric Druot were selected to reshape the Tour Bois le Prêtre, a 17-story housing tower on the city’s northern edge designed by architect Raymond Lopez in 1957. The team cut away most of the thick façade’s panels, installing balconies and large sliding windows in their place. Besides opening the apartments to more natural light, the units are being significantly enlarged and opened, and the firm installed new plumbing, bathrooms, ventilation, and electric systems. The project won the Design of the Year by the UK’s Design Museum (2013). The practice has received the Erich Schelling Award (2006), International Fellowship of the Royal Institute of British Architects (2009), Daylight and building components of the Velum Foundation, Copenhagen (2011), Heinrich Tessenow Gold Medal (2016), and the Mies van der Rohe Award (2019). = Plus = Lacaton & Vassal have worked with Frederic Druot on sustainable housing projects, reinventing old 1960s era social housing in a project called Plus. Plus is an initiative to upgrade old social housing into better living spaces. They've published literature on the project.

As of January 2020, he has a net worth of US$4.8 billion. Biography Wang was born in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. He showed an interest in flight and airborne devices from a young age, but received mediocre grades as a schoolchild. He attended the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (HKUST) for college, and drew the attention of math professor Li Zexiang () following an impressive performance on a class project to build a helicopter flight control system. Li subsequently brought Wang into the school's graduate program. In 2005, Wang participated in ABU Robocon and his HKUST team won third prize among teams competing from across Asia. HKUST granted him HK$18,000 (US$2,300) to conduct research and develop a drone. Wang built the first prototypes of DJI's projects in his dorm room, selling the flight control components to universities and Chinese electric companies. He used the proceeds to move to the industrial hub of Shenzhen and hired a small staff in 2006. The company struggled at first, with a high degree of churn among employees that has been attributed to Wang's abrasive personality and perfectionist expectations of his employees. The company sold a modest amount of components during this period, relying as well on financial support from Wang's family friend, Lu Di, who provided US$90,000 and managed the company's finances. In 2010, Wang hired a high school friend, Swift Xie Jia, to run the company's marketing. DJI began to cater more to drone hobbyists in markets outside of China. In 2011, Wang met Colin Guinn at a trade show, and the two of them would found DJI North America, a subsidiary company focusing on mass market drone sales. In 2013, DJI released the first model of the Phantom drone, an entry-level drone which was significantly more user-friendly than any other drone on the market at the time. The Phantom was a worldwide commercial success, but this success led to conflict between Guinn and Wang. Midway through the year, Wang made an offer to buy Guinn out, which Guinn refused. By the end of the year, DJI had locked all employees of the North American subsidiary out of their email accounts and was well on its way to shutting down the subsidiary's operations. Guinn sued DJI, and the case was settled out of court. In 2015, DJI eclipsed the success of the Phantom with the release of the Phantom 3, whose even greater popularity was in part due to the addition of a built in live-streaming camera. DJI was now the largest consumer drone company in the world, driving many of its competitors out of the market over the following years. In 2017, Wang became Asia's youngest tech billionaire. By 2020, DJI held nearly 77% of the US market share for consumer drones, with no other company holding more than 4%.

It has thick, tessellated bark on the trunk and branches, a crown of heart-shaped, egg-shaped or lance-shaped leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, white flowers and urn-shaped to barrel- shaped fruit. Description Corymbia pachycarpa is a stunted tree or mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, brownish tessellated and fissured bark on the trunk and branches. The crown of the tree has sessile, heart-shaped, egg-shaped or lance-shaped leaves that are the same shade of light green on both sides, long and wide and arranged in opposite pairs. The flower buds are mostly arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with three or seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are pear-shaped, long and wide with a prominently beaked operculum. Flowering has been observed in December and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody urn-shaped to barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with an obvious, but not flared neck, and the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taonomy and naming Corymbia pachycarpa was first formally in 1995 by Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson. The Jaru peoples know the tree as mawurru, yilanggi or warlamarn.

Language The Jaburara language (Yaburarra) is thought to have been similar to Ngarluma, part of the Ngayarda languages. Country The Jaburara owned some of territory from around Dampier, Burrup, Nichol Bay and the peninsula northwards to the Dolphin and Legendre islands. Early contact During one of Phillip Parker King's voyages on to survey the Australian coast, an attempt was made to communicate in February 1817 with members of the tribe, three of whom had been sighted off-shore floating on a log in the vicinity of present-day Karratha (Good Country). The intermediary used was the ship's interpreter Bungaree, who, speaking the Broken Bay Dharug language could not understand them, but managed to calm their anxieties by undressing and showing he wore ritual scars. Resistance and extinction The Jaburara, together with other local tribes such as the Ngarluma and Mardu-Dunera fought against the colonization of their lands by white settlers. According to an American whaler at the time, the law that accompanied settlement in their region could be summed up as 'a word and a blow: the blow, which is generally fatal, coming first'. In 1868, near the present-day township of Roebourne, in an area known in the local language as Murujuga (hip bone sticking out), two policemen and a native tracker had been killed. The suspects, three Jaburara men, were duly caught and sentenced to imprisonment. Two parties, made up of north coast pearlers and settler pastoralists had been given permission by the district authority to apply lethal force 'with discretion and judgement', and they attacked Jaburara encampments in a pincer movement. In what is now known as the Flying Foam massacre it has been estimated that up to 60 Jaburara were killed. In one camp alone, some 15 were killed. Following the La Grange massacre, this episode constitutes the second known example of the use of massacre to forcibly remove an indigenous north Western population. One small 'family' was recorded in the first half of the 20th century as still surviving but the massacre effectively cut off the tribe's connections to the islands. Heritage The Jaburara heritage is attested by rock quarries, extensive archaic petroglyphs, grindstones used by native women to make flour from native seeds, nomadic camps, and middens to be found along the Jaburara Heritage Trail, which winds through an area containing some of the most extensive remains of ancient Aboriginal rock art, some dating back 25,000 years.

Cirrus clouds are high cold ice that, like other clouds, both reflect sunlight and absorb warming infrared radiation. However, they differ from other types of clouds in that, on average, infrared absorption outweighs sunlight reflection, resulting in a net warming effect on the climate. Therefore, thinning or removing these clouds would reduce their heat trapping capacity, resulting in a cooling effect on Earth's climate. This could be a potential tool to reduce anthropogenic global warming. Cirrus cloud thinning is an alternative category of climate engineering, in addition to solar radiation management and greenhouse gas removal. Basic principles Typical cirrus clouds may be susceptible to modification to reduce their lifetime and optical thickness, and hence their net positive radiative forcing (in contrast to the typical low, warm liquid clouds). Material to seed such modification could be delivered via drones or by aircraft. Scientists believe that cirrus clouds in the high latitude upper troposphere are formed by homogeneous freezing, resulting in large numbers of small ice crystals. If effective ice nuclei were introduced into this environment, the cirrus may instead form by heterogeneous freezing. If the concentration of ice nuclei is seeded such that the resulting cloud particle density is less than that for the natural case, the cloud particles should grow larger due to less water vapor competition and attain higher settling velocities. By seeding with aerosols, ice crystals could grow rapidly and deplete water vapor, suppress nucleation and any growth of ice crystals by homogeneous nucleation. The net effect would be a reduced optical thickness and a reduced cloud lifetime, allowing more infrared radiation to be emitted at the top of the atmosphere, as the ice particles sediment out. Less upper tropospheric water vapor and infrared radiation in the atmosphere would consequently cool the climate. Bismuth tri-iodide (BiI3) has been proposed as the seeding material, as it is effective as ice nuclei for temperatures colder than -10 °C, non-toxic and relatively inexpensive compared to e.g. silver iodide. The seeding aerosols would need to be added regularly, as it would sediment out along with the large ice crystals.  Current research  In contrast to solar radiation management techniques, which would be most effective during the day time at lower latitudes, cirrus cloud thinning would be most effective at high latitudes and high solar zenith angles, where the background concentrations of aerosol are low. The cloud-aerosol-climate interactions important for cirrus cloud thinning are not well understood. Factors that related to the heterogeneous freezing process are uncertain, as ice growth kinetics are not well documented. Vertical velocities are essential for the activation of ice nuclei, but remain uncertain due to lack of observations. Heterogeneous freezing may already be common in cirrus, which could limit the cooling potential of the technique. There are significant uncertainties associated with not only ice nucleation processes in cirrus clouds and the fraction of nucleation that occurs via heterogeneous and homogeneous freezing, but also its representation in climate models. “Over- seeding” might lead to warming, as opposed to the desired cooling. Several studies assess the potential and viability of cirrus cloud thinning and the effectiveness of the technique remains a subject of debate. Due to the lack of realistic representation of ice crystal nucleation in Earth system models, some studies have used a simplified representation of cirrus cloud thinning by increasing the terminal velocity of ice crystals below the homogeneous freezing threshold of about -38 °C.

The small party was, together with the better known Spartacist League, one of the constituent organizations that joined to form the Communist Party of Germany in 1918. Organizational history The origins of the International Communists of Germany (IKD) were in the anti-war opposition within the German Social Democratic Party (SPD). Within the Bremen and Hamburg district organizations, a left opposition took stand against the \\"Burgfrieden\\" - the support of Social Democracy for World War I. This current was identified as \\"Bremer Linksradikale\\" - Bremen Radical Leftists, although their followers would be found outside Bremen as well. They were influenced by Karl Radek and Anton Pannekoek. Only in 1918 the current institutionalized as a party and took the new name - the German Revolution had taken away censorship and repression.Gerhard Engel: The International Communists of Germany, in: Ralf Hoffrogge / Norman LaPorte (eds.): Weimar Communism as Mass Movement 1918-1933, London: Lawrence & Wishart, pp. 25-44. The official organ of the IKD was a newspaper, Der Kommunist. The same name was later used by German Trotskyists who, fleeing Germany after the Nazis' rise to power in 1933, established an exile organization in Paris. Arthur Goldstein was involved in this incarnation of the International Communists of Germany.

In Romania, transparency of media ownership is addressed directly in the Constitution and is regulated by a media-specific law, namely the Audiovisual Law no. 504, and by national company law. As for constitutional provisions, even if Romania is among the few European countries that addresses the issue of media transparency directly in the Constitution, it should be said that the focus is on transparency of financial sources and not on ownership. Nonetheless, despite the constitutional provisions on the right to impose an obligation on the media to make public their sources of finance, the Parliament has never enacted the applicable legislation which is indeed absent. The Romanian media-specific law requiring the disclosure of media ownership information applies only to the broadcast sector and provides the disclosure to both a public authority, namely the National Audiovisual Council (CNA) and directly to the public. Finally, also the national company law contains provisions regulating transparency of media ownership. It applies to all media which are registered companies and foresees the obligation to publish all the most relevant information on companies' ownership in the Trade Register Company. Overall, even though the Romanian legislation in the field of media ownership transparency is fully aligned with the European standards, in practice sufficient information to assess who effectively owns and ultimately controls the media is not always available.Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016 Legal framework =Media-specific law: disclosure to a public authority= Romanian law on media ownership transparency only covers the broadcast sector and has no similar provision for print media, but, in practice, many Romanian newspapers make public their publishers and owners. The situation is more complicated for online media and blogs where anonymity is very common.IREX 2016, Europe & Eurasia Media Sustainability Index 2016: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016 The relevant law, named Audiovisual Law no. 504, requires the disclosure of all the information necessary to identify the owners of media companies, e.g. name and contact details of the media organization; name and contact detail of owners; country of domicile of company with an interest; citizenship / residence status of individual with an interest beyond a given threshold. However, the disclosure requirement does not apply to beneficial ownership, which refers to shares of a media company hold on behalf of another person. According to the law, the information must be reported to the National Audiovisual Council, a public regulatory authority under the control of the Parliament. The CNA is the guarantor of the public interest in the audiovisual field. One of the main problem of the law concerns indirect interest: threshold for disclosing indirect interest, which is 20%, looks too high to provide proper information for assessing media ownership and guaranteeing transparency. Furthermore, getting information on individuals or companies with indirect control or significant interests in a given media company is quite time-consuming and complex as it requires in practice a step-by-step process of checking and cross-referencing of a large number of different records. With regard to constraints or costs for public access to the information held by the National Audiovisual Council there are not particularly high costs or time-consuming procedures, even if, in general terms, accessing information held by public institutions often entails several barriers, such as the reluctance of public officials to reveal sensitive information and their resort to broad interpretations of the exceptions to public disclosure of information. Overall, the legal framework provides the disclosure of nearly all the information needed to identify ownership of the broadcast media in Romania. However, the threshold for reporting indirect interest (20%), the difficulties in obtaining information on entities or persons with indirect control and significant interest, abuses and poor implementation, the lack of co-operation between the CNA and other authorities leave room to abuses and insufficient disclosure. =Media-specific law: disclosure directly to the public= According to Article. 48 of Law 504 of 2002, media companies from the audiovisual field must also disclose the information on media ownership directly to the public through their websites. The requirement applies to all kind of information to be disclosed in accordance with the law. In particular, financial information must be updated and disclosed on an annual basis, while the other information must be always available to the public (requirement of the “permanent access” by the public, according to Article 48).Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016 =Non-media specific transparency requirements: company law = In addition to the Audiovisual Law, another source of regulation for transparency of media ownership in Romania is company law which contains non-media specific transparency requirements. The relevant law, which is the Law 31 / 1990 on Trading Companies is applicable to all registered media company owing a license and forbids owners' anonymity: companies are therefore obliged to publish all the main information on ownership in the Trade Register Office (TRO) and to communicate changes. All the constitutive deeds and the modifications are registered in the Trade Registry and published in the Official Journal. The specific information to be disclosed depends on the legal type of the company and might be different for each type of business organizations. However, the mandatory information for all companies are: names, the date and the place of birth, the address and the citizenship of the partners / shareholders (in case of natural persons); the name, the headquarter address and the nationality of the associates (in case of legal persons); the type, name, headquarters address and the company logo; the company's field of activity; the registered capital, including the contribution of each partner in cash or in kind; the number and the face value of the shares and the number of shares given to each partners; the managers of the company and their rights; the share given to each associate in case of profit and loss; secondary headquarters. The public can directly access this data by requesting information from the Trade Registry. Also, since the constitutive documents are also published in the Official Journal, the public can consult this information through the institutional website of the Journal. Even if the law requires the disclosure of all necessary information on ownership, in fact this data have to be reported to various agencies. This might imply, for instance, a complicated step-by-step check process involving request for information from different agencies for each company in the cases of chains of ownership, such as companies owning other companies and the like. Moreover, as there are minimal financial sanctions for failure to report in time, in practice few companies comply with the obligation to update ownership information. According to some critics, the Trade Register Office only shows the tip of the iceberg since the real owner of the media and who effectively controls them remain hidden.Manuela Proteasa, 2004, \\"Romania\\" in Media ownership and its impact on media independence and pluralism / [editor Brankica Petković]. Ljubljana : Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies. Retrieved October 6, 2016 In addition, although public, the access to information collected in the Register is not free of charge and can even be prohibitive. Despite these limits, the TRO remains the main source of data on media ownership in Romania and even if the learning process might be time-consuming, especially in the most complex cases of unclear ownership, all in all it is feasible given sufficient time and resources to collect all the needed information, including beneficial ownership. Transparency of media ownership in practice Despite the fact that Romanian legislation in the field of media ownership transparency is formally aligned with the European standards (both the European Commission and the Council of Europe standards are incorporated in the national legal framework), in practice, there are some major problems. Among the main shortcomings there is the absence of the requirement to disclose all the necessary data to establish which are the owners in case of indirect control or having significant interests in the media company. Moreover, at the practical level, the implementation of the law leaves room for abuses and inadequate disclosure. In sum, a set of factors, including the difficulty in ascertain indirect control and significant interest, implementation problems as well as the challenges in accessing public information result in a significant difficulty for the general public in accessing all the key information to establish who effectively owns and ultimately controls a media outlet.
