The first major bands were Ill√©s, Metr√≥ and Omega. At the time, rock was not approved of by the Hungarian Communist authorities. In the 1970s, the Communists cracked down on rock, and Ill√©s was banned from recording. Some members of the other bands formed a supergroup called Locomotiv GT, while the band Omega became very popular in Germany. History = 1960s = In 1968, the New Economic Mechanism was introduced, intending on revitalizing the Hungarian economy, while the band Ill√©s won almost every prize at the prestigious T√°ncdalfesztiv√°l. In the 70s, however, the Russians cracked down on subversives in Hungary, and rock was a major target. The band Ill√©s was banned from performing and recording, while Metr√≥ and Omega left. Some of the members of these bands formed a supergroup, Locomotiv GT, that quickly became very famous. The remaining members of Omega, meanwhile, succeeded in achieving stardom in Germany, and remained very popular for a time.Central Europe Review: Rock = 1970s = Rock bands in the late 1970s had to conform to the Record Company's demands and ensure that all songs passed the inspection of the Song Committee, who scoured all songs looking for ideological disobedience. LGT was the most prominent band of a classic rock style that was very popular, along with Ill√©s, Bergendy and Zor√°n, while there were other bands like The Sweet and Middle of the Road who catered to the desires of the Song Committee, producing rock-based pop music without a hint of subversion. Meanwhile, the disco style of electronic music produced such performers as the officially sanctioned Neoton Familia, and Beatrice and Sz≈±cs Judit, while the more critically acclaimed progressive rock scene produced bands like East, V73, Color and Panta Rhei.also born of the band. = 1980s = Tam√°s Soml√≥ of Lokomotiv GT In the early 1980s, economic and cultural depression wracked Hungary, leading to a wave of disillusioned and alienated youth, exactly the people that rock, and the burgeoning worldwide field of punk rock, spoke to the most. Major bands from this era included Beatrice, who had moved from disco to punk and folk-influenced rock and were known for their splashy, uncensored and theatrical performances, P. Mobil, Bikini, Hobo Blues Band, a bluesy duo, A. E. Bizotts√°g, Eur√≥pa Kiad√≥, Szi√°mi and Edda m≈±vek. The 1980s saw the Record Production Company broken up because Hungary's authorities realized that restricting rock was not effective in reducing its effect; they instead tried to water it down by encouraging young musicians to sing about the principles of Communism and obedience. The early part of the decade saw the arrive of punk and new wave music in full force, and the authorities quickly incorporated those styles as well. The first major prison sentences for rock-related subversion were given out, with the members of the punk band CPg sentenced to two years for political incitement. = 1990s = By the end of the decade and into the 1990s, internal problems made it impossible for the Hungarian government to counter the activities of rock and other musical groups. After the collapse of the Communist government, the Hungarian scene become more and more like the styles played in the rest of Europe. = 2000s = The 2000s see the emergence of new different genres, while the classic rock remained in the background.

One of the earliest Hungarian band playing indie rock were The Puzzle from Kaposv√°r. They were the first band whose record, titled Dream Your Life, was released by an international label, PolyGram in 2000. Successes On 10 March 2006, Amber Smith's third studio album, RePRINT, was released by the German Kalinkaland Records. The album included the song Hello Sun which brought the band international recognition. On 10 April 2007, The Moog's first full-length studio album Sold for Tomorrow was released by the American label MuSick.[ Allmusic review]PopMatters review The song I Like You brought international success for the band. On 18 February 2008, Amber Smith's fourth studio album was released titled Introspective. The album included songs like Introspective, Select All/Delete All, and Coded.EST review On 21 July 2009, The Moog's second studio album was released titled Razzmatazz Orfeum. The first single, You Raised A Vampire, was released in colored vinyl 7\\" with stunning artwork by Gris Grimly. The 7\\" also includes a B-side cover of the Bauhaus classic The Passion Of Lovers featuring Bauhaus/Love and Rockets bassist/vocalist David J, who became a fan of the band after seeing them perform in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California in 2008. The video for You Raised A Vampire was shot in the same gothic building where the first Underworld movie was made in Budapest, Hungary where. The 2010s saw the emergence of new indie bands such as Carbovaris and Bastiaan, which is the side-project of The Moog singer Tam√°s Szab√≥. Decline The decline of the Hungarian indie started in the 2010s, although the most notable bands such as Amber Smith, The Moog and EZ Basic did not disband. From the 2010s two new bands, Carbovaris and Fran Palermo, started to take over the Hungarian indie scene, however, with moderate success. These bands did not attract such a big audience as Amber Smith or The Moog could in the mid 2000s. The decline can also be attributed to the fact that Imre Poniklo, singer-guitarist of Amber Smith, started several projects in the 2010s, such as The Poster Boy, SALT III., and Krapulax & Bellepomme. Therefore, one of the most important bands did not play at concerts which lower their popularity. In addition, the Indie rock genre also experienced a decline all over the world which obviously affected the Hungarian indie scene. On 10 April 2012 The Moog released their third studio album titled Seasons in the Underground produced by Ken Scott followed by US tour with bands like B-52s and David Lane. The Moog concentrated on their US carrier with moderate success. On 21 April 2012 Amber Smith released their fifth studio album titled Amber Smith. Although Poniklo claimed that this record is one of the best ones among the previous releases, the band did not achieve those sorts of successes as with the previous records. On 29 November 2013, Amber Smith released their EP titled Another Way including two new songs: Another Way and Merciful Sea.

The show's format had the host presenting simple puzzles which viewers could attempt to solve over the phone. Successfully solving a puzzle would result in a cash prize for the contestant. The show debuted on 16 August 2005, the day after the Big Brother 2005 finale. The first caller in was Big Brother winner Greg Mathew, who congratulated Hotdogs on his new show. The first series ended 22 April 2006 to make way for Big Brother UpLate. The second series started on 31 July 2006, the day of the Big Brother Australia 2006 finale, with Deering returning as host. From August 2006, Hotdogs was joined by co-hosts Big Brother 2006 housemate Rob Rigley and singer Chrissy Bray. On Monday 7 August and Tuesday 26 September former Big Brother contestant Krystal Forscutt co- hosted the show. The show's format initially had the host sitting at a table, with a bowl of popcorn and a mug. After the Christmas and New Year break, the format had changed to Deering walking around the set. In 2006, the show was made available via Internet streaming at QuizTV.com.au, the same site that Big Brother UpLate 2006 streamed from when Big Brother was in season, for the benefit of those not in states that receive The Up-Late Game Show live.

Criticism On 11 August 2006 satirical comedy series The Chaser's War on Everything featured a segment on the influx of late night phone-in quiz shows. The segment mocked the standard of all late night quiz programs and their questions. Accusing this style of programming of making money by \\"hardly ever letting callers through\\", therefore limiting the chances for people to win prizes. The segment showed taped footage of a Quizmania two-minute bonus round, where host Amy Parks stalled for the entire length of the round and no calls were taken, despite the claim of taking \\"as many calls as possible\\". To add further to this Julian Morrow and Chas Licciardello claimed to have been calling the Up-late Game Show hundreds of times during this segment.Chaser Takes on Late Night Quiz Shows Many jokes were also made during the length of the first season about Hotdogs himself, Chris Taylor appearing shocked that Hotdogs failed to take out a Logie. Similar complaints have been voiced by Australian entertainment critics.TV's Getting Dodgy Current affairs show Today Tonight also featured a segment in mid-2006 where viewers complained that despite calling numerous times, they were never put through to the show.

In addition to his business activities, from 1941 to 1944 he served in the Royal Canadian Air Force, and from 1980 to 2009 was a part- owner of the Calgary Flames. Biography = Early life = Daryl Kenneth Seaman was born on 28 April 1922 in Rouleau, Saskatchewan, to Byron Luther Seaman and Letha Mae Patton. Daryl was the second of four children, Dorothy Verna his elder, and Byron James (B.J.) and Donald Roy his juniors. Byron Seaman was born in Wisconsin and had come to Canada during the First World War to help with the harvest. After the United States entered the War on 6 April 1917, Byron returned stateside, joined the army, and fought with the American Expeditionary Forces in Germany. He would return to Canada in January 1920 and marry that same month. Seaman had met Mae Patton in Avonlea, Saskatchewan. Patton was born in Unadilla, Nebraska, in 1899 and moved to Canada with her family in 1912. Until 1928 both Byron and Mae both worked on a farm. In 1928 Byron started a road-construction company, which all of his sons worked for in the summer once they were old enough. = World War II = Seaman graduated high school in the spring of 1939, months before Canada entered the Second World War on 10 September 1939. That fall Seaman entered technical school in Moose Jaw and began playing hockey with the Moose Jaw Canucks. Shortly after beginning school, however, Seaman became ill and returned to Rouleau, dropping out of school. In the fall of 1940 Seaman began an engineering degree at the University of Saskatchewan, but in February 1941 left school after enlisting in the military. Because of his high marks in math and physics, the recruiter suggested that Seaman enlist in the Air Force. The first phase of Seaman's military training took place in Brandon, Manitoba, and following that he was transferred to Regina, Saskatchewan. Being selected as a pilot, he was then sent to the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) at RCAF Virden for flight instruction, first flying in September 1941. That November he was transferred to RCAF Brandon, and on 12 March 1942 was granted his Wings. Shortly after finishing his training, Seaman was sent to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he spent his twentieth birthday. On 1 May 1942, Seaman set sail for Great Britain on the , arriving in Glasgow on 12 May. Upon arrival he traveled to Bournemouth, where he spent a short time before transferring to Cornwall, back to Bournemouth, then to Kirmington, and finally to Harrogate. During this time Seaman underwent additional training, flying in Airspeed Oxfords. By that fall Seaman's initial training was complete, and he was sent to Silloth and assigned to a Lockheed Hudson as part of a four-man crew. From November 1942 to January 1943 the crew practised navigation and bombing, the final phase of training. On 20 February 1943 the crew flew to Portreath, Cornwall where they were given their first mission, which was to fly the plane to Gibraltar. Due to poor weather conditions though, Seaman was forced to fly to Casablanca, Morocco. After arrival in Africa, the crew was then posted to Blida, Algeria. While the crew was on a sortie on 29 March 1943, a German Messerschmitt Me 210 attacked their plane, killing one crew member and hitting Seaman twice in the leg. With the assistance of his two remaining crew members Seaman was able to remain conscious and fly the plane back to base. After surgery and a one- month-long recovery, Seaman returned to duty at the end of April. Between February 1943 and September 1944 Seaman's crew flew 82 missions. On 23 September 1944 the crew returned to England, and shortly thereafter Seaman returned to Canada aboard the Aquitaine, the same ship on which his father had returned to the United States during the First World War. = University and early career = Seaman returned to Saskatchewan, but was not officially demobilized until August 1945. That fall, he began an engineering degree at the University of Saskatchewan. Taking classes during the summers as well, Seaman completed his degree in three years, graduating in the spring of 1948. During the summers of 1945 and 1946 Seaman also played baseball for a Saskatoon veterans' team. Carrying his equipment in a satchel, it was at this time he earned his nickname \\"Doc.\\" Both of his brothers had also graduated with engineering degrees from the University of Saskatchewan - B.J. in 1945 and Don in 1947 - and started working in the oil industry after graduation. When Daryl graduated in 1948, he and B.J. traveled to Edmonton, hoping to find work in the wake of the Leduc No. 1 discovery that took place on 13 February 1947. Both B.J. and Daryl got jobs with seismic company Western Geophysical, working in the Athabasca River area. That September, Seaman married Lois DeLong, whom he had met at university. = Sedco and Bow Valley = While working seismic, Seaman became interested in the prospect of forming his own business. Seaman found a partner in Bill Warnke, another war veteran working in the industry. Seaman and Warnke had half of the capital they required to purchase a new seismic rig, and were unable to get a loan from an Edmonton bank. Travelling to Calgary in the spring of 1949, Seaman acquired a loan from a small insurance company and ordered a Mayhew rig through Seismic Service Supply. It was at this time that he resigned from Western Geophysical. Seaman then flew to Dallas, where the rigs were built, waited a week for its completion, and then drove the rig back to Canada. Seaman and Warnke Drilling Contractors received their first contract shortly thereafter. Later in the year, B.J. joined the company, and a second rig was purchased with money given by their father. In 1950, Don, who had been working in Qu√©bec, also joined. Not long after the company was fully operational, the Seaman brothers bought out Warnke's share of the business and changed the company name to Seaman Engineering and Drilling Company, known as Sedco. Throughout the 1950s Sedco became one of Alberta's largest seismic companies. In 1959 Sedco arranged to purchase the larger Hi-Tower Drilling, a company that had been founded in 1945 by Ralph Will. In 1962 the company name was changed to Bow Valley Industries, which it would remain for the rest of its existence. At this time Seaman also purchased several other companies, and by 1964 Bow Valley became the second- largest drilling company in Canada. Bow Valley's largest discovery came in early 1975 when they struck oil in the North Sea off the coast of Scotland. Wanting to expand internationally, Seaman had in April 1971 acquired Syracuse Oil Company, a British company run by Angus MacKenzie. Joining with two Norwegian companies Bow Valley constructed the semi-submersible it named the \\"Odin Drill\\". Bow Valley was third in line drilling in the region, and both previous companies' wells had come up dry. Beginning drilling in September 1974 and taking eight months, Bow Valley discovered a massive field which flowed 22,000 barrels a day. Named the \\"Brae Field,\\" it remains one of the largest North Sea discoveries. Bow Valley Industries remained one of Canada's largest oil companies into the 1990s. In May 1994, Talisman Energy acquired Bow Valley for C$1.82 billion. Retaining rights to the company name, in 1996 Daryl, B.J., and Don, along with numerous other former Bow Valley employees, formed the new Bow Valley Energy, a mid-sized oil company. = Personal life = Daryl Seaman was a lifelong hockey enthusiast and in his youth had been asked to sign a protection card with the New York Americans. Later in life, Seaman was part of the group that in May 1980 purchased the Atlanta Flames and relocated the team to Calgary. The group was led by Nelson Skalbania and in addition to Daryl Seaman comprised B.J. Seaman, Harley Hotchkiss, Ralph Scurfield, Norman Green, and Normie Kwong. On 9 October 1980 the Calgary Flames played their first game in the Stampede Corral, tying the Quebec Nordiques, 5‚Äì5. After three seasons, the Flames moved into the new Olympic Saddledome, playing their first game there on 15 October 1983, losing to the Edmonton Oilers, 3‚Äì4. During's Seaman's time as an owner, the Flames played in three Stanley Cup Finals, losing in 1986 and 2004, and winning in 1989. At the time of Seaman's death in 2009, only he, Byron Seaman, and Harley Hotchkiss remained from the original ownership group. In addition to his ownership of the Flames, Seaman was instrumental in the construction of the Olympic Saddledome and in bringing the 1988 Winter Olympics to Calgary. In 1987 Seaman purchased the historic OH Ranch and its cattle operation, which he owned until his death in 2009.

It consists of a cluster of houses and a public house (the Blacksmith's Arms) at a crossroads on the A29 road, on the Roman road named Stane Street. Adversane means the hyrne (corner) of the estate of Hadfold and was first documented as Hadesfoldesberne in 1279.From Billingshurst's Heritage An Historical Miscellany of a West Sussex Village, Geoffrey Lawes, 2016, The hamlet was known as Hadfoldshern until the 1850s.From Hadfoldshern to Adversane, Deborah Evershed, 2007 Published by South Grove Books 3 South Grove Petworth West Sussex GU28 0ED Tel. 01798 343496 The Blacksmith's Arms stands beside the site of the blacksmiths shop, where Gaius (George) Carley was the last of many smiths to work the forge until it closed in the 1960s. He lived at Grigg's Cottage, a half-timbered cottage opposite. Stane Street cottages, opposite the pub, were probably built using the Roman road as their foundation, as the road deviates slightly at this point, returning to its straight line a little distance further on, and the sandstone houses are precisely in line with both sections of Stane Street. They are in fact a single building, converted in the 1930s from a malt warehouse built by the Allen brothers of Horsham, whose activities are catalogued in 'A History of Horsham' produced by Horsham Museum. They were maltsters who smuggled malt from the continent during the Napoleonic wars and hid their contraband in secret cellars under this and several other warehouses in the Horsham area. The cellars had a tendency to flood and were filled in during the 1950s together with the reputed secret passage to the pub! The malthouse was part of the setting for 'Martin Pippin in the Apple Orchard' by Eleanor Farjeon, published by W. Collins & Sons Ltd in 1921 and by Oxford University Press in 1952.

Specifically a balanced job complex is a collection of tasks within a given workplace that is balanced for its equity and empowerment implications against all other job complexes in that workplace. It was developed as an alternative to the corporate division of labor. Each worker must do a share of rote tasks (unskilled work) for some time each work day or each week. All workers also share the most rewarding and empowering tasks in the workplace so it is coordinated with everyone's involvement. In this way workers share the burdens and benefits of work that impact each person's ability to participate in democratic decision-making within the workplace. Balanced job complexes imply a lack of owners or formal managers involved in the workplace, as all tasks are balanced for empowerment. Balanced job complexes are central to the theory of participatory economics which emerged from the work of radical theorist Michael Albert and that of radical economist Robin Hahnel. The concept of the balanced job complex was developed and put into practice at South End Press in the late 1970s. In the 1990s, a series of worker-run collectives in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, were founded using parecon-inspired principles, including balanced job complexes, as part of their internal structures. Most notable in this regard have been Mondragon Bookstore and Coffee House, G7 Welcoming Committee Records, and Arbeiter Ring Publishing.

Religious aspect  64 Joginis Temple is a tantric temple, with hypaethral (roofless) architecture as tantric prayer rituals involve worshiping the bhumandala (environment consisting all the 5 elements of nature - fire, water, earth, sky and ether). The Jogini idols are generally representing a female figurine standing on an animal, a demon or a human head depicting the victory of Shakti (Feminine power). The idols express everything from rage, sadness, pleasure, joy, desire and happiness. The number 64 finds its reference in Hindu mythology in various forms viz KƒÅl√° for time, KalƒÅ for performing arts etc. Such temples dedicated to joginis are also seen at Ranipur-Jharial site of the Balangir district in Odisha and seven other places in India.  History  The temple is believed to be built by the Queen Hiradevi of Bramha dynasty during the 9th century. The legend behind the temple according to local priests is of the Goddess Durga taking the form of 64 demi-goddesses in order to defeat a demon. After the fight the 64 goddesses (Joginis) asked Durga to commemorate them in the form of a temple structure. The temple complex is now maintained by Archaeological Survey of India. Kalapahad, a converted Muslim general of 16th CE is believed to have attacked this temple as well and broken the Murtis. He is famously known as the destroyer of Puri and Konark temples.  Architecture  The temple is built in a circular fashion, completely put together with blocks of sandstone. The inside of the circular wall has cavities, each housing the statue of a Goddess. There are around 56 such idols, made of black granite, inscribed within the wall cavities, centring on the main idol which is the Goddess Kali, who stands on a human head representing the triumph of the heart over the mind. Some historians believe that an idol of Maha Bhairava was worshiped in the Chandi Mandapa. The temple seems to follow a madala plan in a way that concentric circles are formed while a Shiva at the center inside the inner sanctum is roundly surrounded by four Yoginis and four Bhairava.

It contains about 24 species of herbs and shrubs that are sometimes described as being suffruiticose and have bipinnate leaves. Desmanthus is closely related to Leucaena and in appearance is similar to Neptunia. Like Mimosa and Neptunia, Desmanthus species fold their leaves in the evening. They are native to Mexico and North, Central and South America. Members of the genus are commonly known as bundleflowers. Donkey beans is another common name and originated in Central America, where Desmanthus species are highly regarded as fodder for these domestic draught animals. Description Desmanthus bicornutus Desmanthus illinoensis seeds Desmanthus pernambucanus Desmanthus pubescens Desmanthus virgatus and buffelgrass Desmanthus illinoensis There are considerable differences in the descriptions of Desmanthus in the literature (see Bogdan 1977; Skerman 1977; National Academy of Science 1979; Allen & Allen 1981; Reid 1983; Hacker 1990). For example, Reid (1983) says that Desmanthus virgatus ranges from \\"leggy\\" plants in the humid tropics to compact bushes in the semi-arid zones to prostrate in the montane zones; Allen and Allen (1981) state that Desmanthus grows to 3 metres; Hacker (1990) states that D. virgatus is an erect shrub 1.3 metres tall. All these views illustrate the great diversity and polymorphism within the genus and between species. Phytochemistry The root-bark of D. illinoensis, which accounts for half of the total weight of the root system, is reported to contain anywhere from 0 to 0.34% DMT and 0.11% N-Methyltryptamine. Alkaloid content is highly variable in this species.Desmanthus (Ayahuasca: alkaloids, plants & analogs) Likewise, root bark of Desmanthus leptolobus has been found to contain N,N-DMT and related tryptamines. While its only reported quantitative analysis was 0.14% (Appleseed), all instances of co-occurrence with D. illinoensis showed it to be noticeably stronger than D. illinoensis, according to co-thin layer chromatography of the root bark.Ayahuasca: alkaloids, plants & analogs: assembled by Keeper of the Trout Uses During the 1990s in Australia, three species of Desmanthus were released as pasture legumes and many other accessions are being evaluated as pasture species for clay soils. The three old released cultivars are: * Desmanthus virgatus Cultivar \\"Marc\\"(Accession number: CPI 78373) which is described as early flowering, decumbent to ascending, growing 30 to 60 cm tall and originates from Argentina. * Desmanthus leptophyllus Cultivar \\"Bayamo\\" (CPI 82285), mid season flowering, ascending type, 95‚Äì135 cm tall, from Cuba * Desmanthus pubescens Cultivar \\"Uman\\" (CPI 92803), late flowering, decumbent shrub, taller and wider spreading than Marc, 40‚Äì100 cm tall, from Mexico. Of these three, only the cultivar Marc is still commercially available. In 2015 five new cultivars of Desmanthus named JCU 1 to JCU 5 have been granted PBR and are commercially available as a blend named \\"Progardes\\", consisting of D. bicornutus, D. leptophyllus and D. virgatus, these have been developed in Queensland Australia as a pasture legume for semi-arid tropical/subtropical alkaline clay soils. Progardes became available in 2013 in Northern Australia and some 35,000 to 50,000 ha has been already sown into native and buffelgrass pasture.. In recent times additional cultivars have seen developed including cv JCU 6,7,8 and 9. These can also be included in the Progardes blend. The breeding of intraspecific and interspecific crosses are well advanced.. In terms of animal production Progardes has been to shown to enhance beef production . In its native range in the United States, the Land Institute is selectively breeding the widely distributed Illinois bundleflower (Desmanthus illinoensis) to be a perennial seed crop for human food, in addition to forage / pasture. It offers many of the advantages in terms of nutrition, protein and nitrogen fixation as soybeans or alfalfa, but as a perennial. Perennial crops tend to require less input of chemicals and energy, and less weed control, for comparable or higher yields to annuals in many systems.

Their name in their own language is Kuupangaxwichem (\\"people who slept here.\\")\\"California Indians and Their Reservations. SDSU Library and Information Access. (retrieved 18 May 2010) They traditionally lived about inland and north of the modern day Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border in the Peninsular Range of Southern California. Today their descendants are members of the federally recognized tribes known as the Pala Band of Luiseno Mission Indians, Morongo Band of Cahuilla Mission Indians, and Los Coyotes Band of Cahuilla and Cupeno Indians. History The Cupe√±o village of Cupa in 1893 Map of Cupe√±o villages Map of Cupe√±o villages with Warner Springs for reference Several different groups combined to form Cupe√±o culture around 1000 to 1200 AD. They were closely related to Cahuilla culture.Bean and Smith, 588 The Cupe√±o people traditionally lived in the mountains in the San Jose Valley at the headwaters of the San Luis Rey River.Pritzker, 124 They lived in two autonomous villages, Wil√°kalpa and K√∫pa,Pritzker, 125 also spelled Cupa, located north of present- day Warner Springs, California. They also lived at Agua Caliente, located east of Lake Henshaw in an area crossed by State Highway 79 near Warner Springs. The Cupe√±o Indian village site is now abandoned but evidence of its historical importance remains.\\"Cupa: San Diego County\\", A History of American Indians in California: HISTORIC SITES, National Park Service, accessed 18 Nov 2009 Spaniards entered Cupe√±o lands in 1795 and took control of the lands by the 19th century. After Mexico achieved independence, its government granted Juan Jose Warner, a naturalized American-Mexican citizen, nearly of the land on November 28, 1844. Warner, like most other large landholders in California at the time, depended primarily on Indian labor. The villagers of K√∫pa provided most of Warner's workforce on his cattle ranch. The Cupe√±o continued to reside at what the Spanish called Agua Caliente after the American occupation of California in 1847 to 1848, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. They built an adobe ranch house in 1849 and barn in 1857, which are still standing. According to Julio Ortega, one of the oldest members of the Cupe√±o tribe, Warner set aside about of land surrounding the hot springs as the private domain of the Indians. Warner encouraged the Cupe√±o to construct a stone fence around their village and to keep their livestock separated from that of the ranch. Ortega felt that if the village had created its own boundaries, the Cupe√±o would still live there today.Morrison, 1962, p.21 In observing the Cupe√±o's living conditions in 1846, W. H. Emory, brevet major with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, described the Indians as being held in a state of serfdom by Warner, and as being ill-treated.May 1902, Out West, p. 471 In 1849, Warner was arrested by the American forces for consorting with the Mexican government and was taken to Los Angeles. In 1851, because of several issues of conflict, Antonio Garra, a Yuma Indian, living at Warner's Ranch, tried to organize a coalition of various Southern California Indian tribes to drive out all of the European Americans.Bean and Smith, 589 His Garra Revolt failed, and settlers executed Garra. The Cupe√±o had attacked Warner and his ranch, burning some buildings. They lost structures at their settlement of K√∫pa, too. Warner sent his family to Los Angeles, but continued to operate the ranch through others. After European contact and prior to the time of their eviction, the Cupe√±os sold milk, fodder, and some craftwork to travelers on the Southern Immigrant Trail, as well as to passengers on the stagecoaches of the Butterfield Overland Mail, which stopped at Warner's Ranch and passed through their valley. The women made lace and took in laundry, which they washed in the hot springs. The men carved wood and manufactured saddle pads for horses. They also raised cattle and cultivated of land. In 1880, after numerous suits and countersuits, European-American John G. Downey acquired all titles to the main portion of Warner's Ranch. In 1892, John G. Downey, former governor of California and owner since 1880, began proceedings to evict the Cupe√±o from the ranch property. Legal proceedings continued until 1903, when the court ruled in Barker v. Harvey against the Cupe√±o. The United States Government offered to buy new land for the Cupe√±o, but they refused. In 1903, Cecilio Blacktooth, Cupe√±o chief at Agua Caliente, said: \\"If you give us the best place in the world, it is not as good as this. This is our home. We cannot live anywhere else; we were born here, and our fathers are buried here.\\"May 1902, Out West, p.475 Forced relocation from Warner's Ranch to Pala (1903) On May 13, 1903, the Cupa Indians were forced to move to Pala, California on the San Luis Rey River, away. Indians at the present-day reservations of Los Coyotes, San Ygnacio, Santa Ysabel, and Mesa Grande are among descendants of the Warner Springs Cupe√±o. Many Cupe√±o believe that their land at K√∫pa will be returned to them. They are seeking legal relief to that end. The Cupa site serves as a rallying point for the land claims movement of contemporary Indian people, particularly their effort to regain cultural and religious areas. Culture Mercedes Nolasquez, a Cupe√±o basket maker at Warner's Ranch, ca. 1900 The tribe is divided into two moieties, the Coyote and Wildcat, which are divided into several patrilineal clans. Clans are led by hereditary male clan leaders and assistant leaders. Marriages were traditionally arranged. Cupe√±o rock mortars for grinding acorns Traditional foods included acorns, cactus fruit, seeds, berries, deer, quail, rabbits, and other small game. The Cupa Cultural Center was founded in 1974 in Pala and underwent a major expansion in 2005. The center exhibits artwork, hosts classes and activities such as basket making and beading, and offers Cupe√±o language classes. During the first weekend of every May, Cupa Days is celebrated at the cultural center.\\"Cupa Cultural Center\\", Pala Band of Mission Indians. 2006 (retrieved 18 May 2010) Language The Cupe√±o language belongs to the Cupan group, which includes the Cahuilla and Luise√±o languages. This grouping is of the Takic branch within the Uto-Aztecan family of languages. Roscinda Nolasquez (1892‚Äì1987), of Mexican Yaqui descent, is considered the last truly fluent Cupe√±o speaker.Brigandi, P. \\"Roscinda Nolasquez Remembered.\\" The Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology. 9 (1) 2009: 3. The language is widely regarded as being extinct. In 1994, linguist Leanne Hinton estimated one to five people still spoke Cupe√±o, and nine people in the 1990 US census said they spoke the language.Hinton, 28 Educational materials for the language exist and young people still learn to sing in Cupe√±o, particularly Bird Songs.Hinton, 29, 42 Population Alfred L. Kroeber estimated the 1770 population of the Cupe√±o as 500. Lowell John Bean and Charles R. Smith put the total in 1795 between 500 and 750. By 1910, the Cupe√±o population had dropped to 150, according to Kroeber. Later estimates have suggested that there were fewer than 150 Cupe√±o in 1973, but 200 in 2000.

The attraction features vehicles designed to resemble submarines. It first opened on June 14, 1959, as one of the first rides to require an E ticket. It was part of a major expansion of Tomorrowland, which included the Matterhorn Bobsleds roller coaster, an expanded version of Autopia, the Disneyland Monorail, and the Motor Boat Cruise. The Submarine Voyage closed on September 9, 1998; at that time, it was reported that the attraction would reopen with a new theme by 2003, but that did not occur. The attraction ultimately reopened in June 2007 themed to Disney and Pixar's Finding Nemo, and now operates as Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage. Attraction A giant clam seen through a submarine porthole. Sea serpent as seen through the port side porthole. Photo by Mike Johansen. As initially conceived, the Submarine Voyage was to feature real fish and other sea creatures, though the idea proved to be unfeasible. A major portion of the ride simulated the voyage under the Arctic Ocean's polar ice cap undertaken by the nuclear submarine on August 3, 1958. =Ride= The submarines followed a long guide rail through the following sections of the ride: Getting under way As the guest enters the submarine, taped narrations play that help create an illusion that the guest is actually getting ready to submerge in a submarine. The Captain gives the order to clear the bridge and secure hatches and vents. When the last guest boards, the dock operators raise the ramps and secure the hatches. As the submarine leaves the dock, the Captain gives the \\"all ahead one-third\\" order. Diving and lagoon As the submarine leaves the dock, it dives below the surface to view the undersea life of a tropical lagoon. The diving effect is accomplished by a dense curtain of small bubbles rushing towards the surface on a slight angle, giving the feeling that the submarine is moving forward and down. Guests can view seaweed, coral reefs, rock formations, and mysterious caves. Some of the specific oceanic creatures on the voyage were: * sea turtle * sea serpent * ocean sunfish * barracuda * battling lobsters * battling crabs * grouper * giant clam * moray eel Graveyard of Lost Ships After a quiet cruise through the lagoon, the navigation room receives word of a surface storm ahead. The submarine begins a dive, which takes it to 250 feet, a point safely below the violence of the turbulent hurricane. The submarine passes through the wreckage of other ships that have not fared so well. Ships from many periods of history lie barnacle-covered and decayed, including Greek, Roman, and Viking ships. A shark guards a treasure chest in the hold of a Venetian galley. Nearby, deep-sea divers work to carry other treasures to the surface. North Pole Sonar detects a polar ice cap ahead, and the diving officer takes the ship deeper in order to clear the ice. The submarine travels directly beneath the North Pole. This is a recreation of the historic voyage of when it left Hawaii on July 22, 1958 and set its course for the North Pole. The Bottom of the Sea After passing beyond the polar region, the submarine journeys to deeper waters where sunlight has never penetrated. Strange creatures can be sighted, including a giant squid and creatures that can change color at will. Mermaids Mermaids can now be seen. Unlike the mermaids on the lagoon, these mermaids are animatronic creations. Lost Continent of Atlantis The submarine continues and enters an area resembling the lost continent of Atlantis. There is some volcanic activity in this area, but the submarine travels safely between teetering columns. Sea Serpent As the submarine safely leaves the area of volcanic disturbance, a sea serpent is sighted. The Captain calls the crew to man their battle stations and stand by for action. He then becomes convinced that he has been at sea too long when the comical cross-eyed laughing sea serpent appears. Return to the Surface As the submarine reaches the surface, preparations are made for entering port. When all lines are secured, the \\"All ashore\\" is given and guests depart the submarine. =Vehicles= The hulls (eight in all) for \\"one of the world's largest peacetime submarine fleets\\" cost $80,000 each to build. They were fabricated at Todd Shipyards in San Pedro, California, then transported to the \\"Disneyland Naval Yard\\" in Anaheim for outfitting under the direction of retired Admiral Joe Fowler. Technical data and advice regarding the design were provided by General Dynamics' Electric Boat Division, builder of the U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered submarines, and also the first company in the world to manufacture submarines. The windows in the submarines, or portholes, were first cut out by hand‚Äîthis cutout was then used to carve out the other windows on the submarine. The vessels were painted in military gray livery with black lower hulls until 1986, when the attraction was updated. The exterior color of the submarines was changed to yellow with white around the 'periscope towers' along with pastel blue or pastel pink trim on the hatch doors, periscope tower and lower hull. However, the newly painted subs' paint started peeling almost immediately and had to be repainted yet again within a few months. This time they were painted mustard yellow along with orange and black trim; the design would remain the same until the attraction closed in 1998. The yellow color made the submarines look like research submarines instead of the previous militarian gray and black subs. (The reason research subs are typically painted yellow is that yellow is one of the last colors to be visible at great depths.) The vessels are not actual submarines as they do not submerge, but are in fact boats, where inside the 38-passenger (now 40-passenger) seating area was positioned below the water level. Portholes along the sides allowed guests to view the many underwater sights. Above the seating area was the conning tower, where the operator stood and controlled the sub's speed. The \\"diving\\" effect was made by bubble screens and using the waterfalls at the entrance to the caves that led the submarines into the cleverly disguised show building. The bubble jets can be seen from outside if one were to look just past the loading dock. In case of a broken porthole, a cushion in the conning tower could be used to plug the hole until the repair crew arrived. Atop of the show building are the majority of the Autopia tracks, some monorail tracks, trees and the currently derelict Rocket Rods/PeopleMover track. During the attraction's opening in June 1959, the Disneyland fleet was christened by Mrs. Mildred Nelson, a former WAVE and wife of Chief Machinist Mate Stuart N. H. Nelson of .

It is difficult to maintain, since divers had to be sent underwater every night to clean up debris and fix the audio-animatronics whenever they broke down. During the summers of 1965‚Äì1967, female cast members dressed in mermaid costumes could be seen sun-bathing themselves and performing synchronized swimming and underwater stunts for four hours each day. Disney ended this feature in 1967 after several mermaid performers reported health concerns related to the submarines' diesel exhaust fumes and the highly chlorinated water. In addition, tourists taking pictures of them would block the thoroughfare between the Matterhorn and the submarine lagoon. The mermaids received $1.65 an hour, which in 2018 dollars would be $13.15 an hour. In 2005, an auction took place at the Disneyland Resort, where several pieces of the original attraction's scenery were sold, such as the shark fighting with the octopus on a rock. They were removed from the lagoon prior to the auction so new scenery for the updated Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage could be built into the lagoon. =Queue= In and around 1982, the waiting line for the attraction had various spiels combined with sea chanties as mood music. Some of these sea chanties were: * \\"The Sailor's Hornpipe\\" (traditional, of Popeye cartoon fame, or of Mike Oldfield's album \\"Tubular Bells\\" fame) * \\"A Whale of a Tale\\" (from the Disney film \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\") * \\"What Shall We Do With the Drunken Sailor?\\" (traditional, played on harmonica in the spiel) Closing and re-opening The Submarine lagoon drained of water while Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage was under construction. Matterhorn Bobsleds can be seen in the background. Hidden Mickey painted in the form of three bubbles in the fence around the dried out lagoon while Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage was under construction. In April of 1998, when the Orange County Register interviewed Disneyland president Paul Pressler regarding the attraction‚Äôs fate after rumors circulated about the attraction‚Äôs closure, Pressler stated: ‚ÄúWe know in the future we need to do something in that location, but we have not made a decision on the subs, and we won‚Äôt make a decision until we know what we want to do in the future there.‚Äù On September 7, 1998, the attraction closed, because Disneyland executives at that time considered it too costly to operate in relation to its capacity. The lagoon stood derelict, filled with water, for seven years, serving as nothing more than a scenic viewpoint. Many rumors went around over the years, saying that a proposed attraction based on the 2001 Disney animated film Atlantis: The Lost Empire was going to replace Submarine Voyage in 2003. However, after the film‚Äôs poor box office performance, this was scrapped. Another rumor was that the lagoon was going to be destroyed in a similar fashion to the submarine lagoon of Walt Disney World's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. In 2005, the lagoon was drained and construction began on a new attraction: Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage, which opened on June 11, 2007. Similar attractions The successor of this attraction was the Jules Verne themed 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: Submarine Voyage at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom. The attraction was given a Nautilus theme and a narration by Peter Renaday, whose voice was similar to that of actor James Mason, who portrayed Captain Nemo in the 1954 Disney film. The attraction was closed in 1994 for a \\"rehabilitation\\" period, but never reopened. Executive leadership felt that continual maintenance of the attraction was simply too costly. The space was cleared of ride elements, and in 2004, ten years after its closure, the water was drained. A small portion of the area was remade into [Pooh's Playful Spot] playground until April, 2010. The remaining open field backstage was ultimately paved over in 2010 to create new space for Fantasyland. A similar voyage attraction now exists at the Tokyo DisneySea in Japan, using the same Nautilus theme from Florida, except instead of boats in water, it is a dark ride through a show building, in enclosed suspended cars (\\"mini-subs\\"). There was a walk-through of the Nautilus sets from the 1954 film at Disneyland from 1955 until 1966, when they were destroyed. However, an updated version of the walk-through was built in 1994 in Discoveryland in Disneyland Paris, known as Les Myst√®res du Nautilus, along with the construction of Space Mountain.

Hjorth was one of Sweden‚Äôs best-known sculptors and painters, and was professor of art at the Royal University College of Fine Arts in Stockholm from 1949 to 1959. On completion of his studies, he lived in Uppsala, where he built his studio home in K√•bo, now the Bror Hjorths Hus museum. He was awarded the Sergel Prize in 1955. Training In 1915, Hjorth spent a month studying under Caleb Althin and a month studying under G. Hallstr√∂m. He took a break from his studies from 1915 to 1919 due to illness, before enrolling at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen for a year and a half, followed by four years studying sculpture in Paris under Antoine Bourdelle. Style, background and works N√§ckens polska statues and fountain in front of Uppsala Central railway station. Hjorth is known for his figures, which are often roughly carved in wood and decorated using only a few bright colours. He also painted a number of landscapes and studio interiors. He grew up among farmers and woodlanders in Dalboda, where he came into contact with local styles of music which came to have a great influence on his work. He showed promising artistic tendencies from an early age - his schoolbooks were decorated with sketches, but this did not prevent him from completing his studies - and his artistic skills continued to flourish in later life. His K√§rlek (Love) sculptures, which he completed in the 1930s, were highly controversial and widely misunderstood.. Highlights of his extensive work include: * Kubistisk flicka (Cubist Girl), sculpture, 1921 * Visdomens Brunn (The Fount of Wisdom), sculpture, 1933 * Begravningen (The Burial), painting, 1925 One indication of Hjorth's significance as an artist is that the Swedish Post Office has on three occasions (including the 100th anniversary of his birth in 1995) issued postage stamps featuring his work.

The following day, Jung released a statement claiming that in August 2014 her fellow group members and SM had been positive about the launch of her fashion business, Blanc and Eclare. As of early September, she claimed, they had all changed their stance, and she was directed to either close the business or cease promotions as a member of Girls' Generation. She claimed to have received the day before a \\"one-sided notice\\" asking her to leave the group. However, according to SM, Jung had unilaterally informed them in early spring that she would leave the group after one more album. But before agreements could be made, she had set up her independent business, which caused problems for the group's professional schedules. This prompted management to begin promoting Girls' Generation as eight members rather than nine, with the intention of announcing the news; however, Jung had already \\"posted her own perspective‚Äù. The company then stated that the group would henceforth continue as eight, while they would still manage Jung's individual schedule.SM States that SNSD will Promote as Eight Without Jessica CJ E&M; enewsWorld (September 30, 2014). Retrieved February 23, 2016. In the days immediately after this news came to light, company stocks dropped by KR‚Ç©3,350 per share, from KR‚Ç©40,750 to KR‚Ç©37,400, losing SM a total of KR‚Ç©69 billion (approximately US$65 million). On August 6, 2015, Jung and SM Entertainment reached an agreement to terminate her contract, with Jung stating, \\"This release is to confirm that SM Entertainment ('SM') and I have officially parted ways. I will cherish the many years we spent and I wish SM the best of luck in all of its endeavors.\\" Lu Han On October 10, 2014, Lu Han became the second Chinese member of EXO to file to nullify his contract with SM Entertainment and leave the group, just over four months after Kris had done the same. His lawsuit included the claim that SM had favored the Korean sub-unit EXO-K over the Chinese sub-unit EXO-M. Within 15 minutes of the announcement, company stocks had dropped by 9.41%, from KR‚Ç©37,000 to KR‚Ç©33,250 per share. The stock's worth contracted by 15%, hitting the maximum decrease in price KOSDAQ allows for a day, and falling to a more-than-one-year low. On July 21, 2016, Lu Han officially parted ways with EXO, although his contract with SM remains valid until 2022. No Min-woo In April 2015, No Min-woo, a former member of TRAX, filed a lawsuit against SM for subjecting him to an unlawful seventeen-year contract. No alleged that SM had also interfered with his career after he had left the company, and sought KR‚Ç©100 million in damages. No lost his lawsuit against SM Entertainment on July 21, 2016. Huang Zitao On August 24, 2015, Tao became the third Chinese member of EXO to file against SM and leave the group, being represented by the same legal team that represented former members Kris and Lu Han. On January 5, 2016, SM won one of its counter-lawsuits against Tao per the ruling of the Intermediate People's Court in Qingdao, China. The agency sued Tao over his failure to repay the company after his departure. They released an official statement saying, \\"SM has ongoing lawsuits against EXO members Wu Yifan (Kris), Luhan, and Tao for violating their exclusive contracts and partaking in illegal promotions in China. Among these lawsuits, SM filed a lawsuit against Tao for failing to repay SM on October 13, 2015. An intermediate court in Qingdao, China made the verdict that Tao is to repay SM Entertainment as well as interest for the delayed payment.\\" =2009 MAMA Awards boycott= On November 21, 2009, SM Entertainment boycotted the Mnet Asian Music Awards event, claiming reservations regarding the standard of fairness and the criteria used in Mnet's selections for award recipients. The company specifically mentioned Girls' Generation, who had topped Korean music charts for nine consecutive weeks and had won numerous awards for their single \\"Genie\\", but had never won on Mnet's weekly M! Countdown show, and had only appeared on their charts a month after the album release. SM also cited the fact that voters had to pay a fee, saying that they \\"did not want to see fans suffer any damage from the poll, which has commercial intentions.\\" =Fair Trade Commission scrutiny= In 2010, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) undertook an investigation into SM Entertainment's policies, especially regarding artists' contract terms, and concluded that they were unfair. Artist contracts were subsequently reduced by a length of three years, and there was a reduction in the penalties for breach-of-contract violations. All the artists signed under SM at the time re-contracted with the agency under the new terms. SM was also one of fifteen companies sued and fined by the KFTC for price rigging in 2011. In 2012, SM was accused of colluding with music distributors, but was cleared of the charge. On August 16, the Seoul High Court revealed their verdict on the issue: \\"The KFTC has canceled all corrective orders against SM Entertainment, and the lawsuit costs will be paid by the defendant.\\" =Red Velvet music video controversy= In August 2014, after the release of Red Velvet's music video for \\"Happiness\\", Japanese media reported that images referencing the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the 9/11 attacks, were seen in the background of the video. SM Entertainment responded to the reports, stating that \\"after questioning the director, we found that he simply used a collage source for the images, and there was no intention behind it.\\" The representative added, \\"As SM wasn't able to catch it before, we will remove the material that caused the misunderstanding as soon as possible. We will make sure not to let this kind of thing happen in the future.\\" SM later uploaded a new version of the music video without the controversial images.

It lies in the historical region of Alsace (Elsass in German). The village lies on the edge of the Ballons des Vosges Nature Park, where the Vosges meet the Upper Rhine Plain. Eguisheim is about from Colmar. The vineyards around Eguisheim produce Alsace wine of high quality. The village is ranked in the top 20 of Les Plus Beaux Villages de France.Eguisheim on the Generation Voyage website (in French) In May 2013 it was voted the ¬´Village pr√©f√©r√© des Fran√ßais¬ª (Favorite French Village), an annual distinction that passes from town to town throughout France.Eguisheim ¬´Village pr√©f√©r√© des Fran√ßais¬ª en 2013 on the lalsace.fr website History Human presence in the area as early as the Paleolithic age is testified by archaeological excavations. Two parts from a human skull (from the frontal and parietal bones) were found in 1865 and given to Charles-Fr√©d√©ric Faudel, a physician in nearby Colmar, who carefully described the find and noted they were found undisturbed between animal bones, which allowed for a relative dating at a time when the very existence of prehistoric humans was still doubted. The find became known in France in 1867 through Paul Broca, and subsequently became a topic of discussion in the debate over what would become Paleoanthropology. Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Br√©au and Ernest Hamy, in their 1873 Crania ethnica, grouped Eguisheim and others with the finds at Neanderthal and Naulette, creating a \\"race of Canstadt\\" that was so flexible that almost all fossil remains of humans would fit. Gustav Schwalbe (who first published on the skull in 1897), in a comparison with other skull fragments including those found in Spy, Belgium, concluded the skull was sufficiently different from Neanderthal skulls and approached the measurements of modern humans. One reviewer cast some doubt on Schwalbe's comparison and argued that only the cranial vault was substantially different from the others, but this, he said, could have been a normal variation from the mean within a group. Later scholars seem to have accepted the identification of the skull as belonging to a Neanderthal, though Schwalbe again, in 1902, insisted on the difference between the Eguisheim and Neanderthal skulls. In 1904 Schwalbe proposed a species he called Homo primigenius for what at least one of his contemporaries called Home neandertalensis, and excluded the Eguisheim skull from that category. In early historic times it was inhabited by the Gaul tribe of the Senones; the Romans conquered the village and developed here the cultivation of wine. In the early Middle Ages, the Dukes of Alsace built a castle here (11th century) around which the current settlement developed. Climate Eguisheim has a climate that is principally oceanic being influenced by the Atlantic Ocean, it is warm and temperate. It is rated as CfB on the K√∂ppen-Geiger scale. Because Eguisheim is landinward temperatures in the summer regularly exceed 25¬∞C. January is generally the coldest month, although the temperature occasionally drops below 0¬∞C, the average temperature is above freezing point. May and June are usually the wettest months of the year (there is rainfall almost every other day). June, July and August are the hottest months with the most sun. September is not extremely wet or hot, making it very suitable for the harvest of grapes. Wine Eguisheim has two areas which produce wine of exceptional quality, Eichberg (in English: Oak Mountain)Eichberg on the Wine Searcher website and Pfersigberg (in English: Peach Mountain)Pfersigberg on the Wine Searcher website, characterised by the very hard Muschelkalk. Besides the usual quality wines Eguisheim produces Edelzwicker, C√¥te d'Eguisheim (a local high end variety of Edelzwicker) and Gentil, all blends of the \\"noble\\" grapes grown locally. Tourism A window in Eguisheim with an inscription in Alsatian. The village is a popular tourist destination, in part because the Alsace \\"Wine Route\\" passes the village. The village is close to Husseren-les-Ch√¢teaux and is in the middle of vineyards. The village is connected to Husseren-les-Ch√¢teaux by the Route du Vin (D14). Around the Route du Vin is a wine trail through the vineyards called Sentier viticole Eguisheim, which tries to explain the different grape varieties and the way wine is made in Alsace. Sentier viticole on the Visit Alsace website The area around Eguisheim is popular with hikers and cyclists. There are many marked trails. Popular destinations are Les Trois Ch√¢teaux (in Husseren-les- Ch√¢teaux) and Ch√¢teau de Hagueneck. A little further away are Ch√¢teau du Hohlandsbourg and Ch√¢teau de Pflixbourg, which can be reached on foot or by car. The village is also a Village Cigogne d'Alsace (in Alsatian: Els√§ssisches Storckadorf), meaning that there are storks in the village. Eguisheim has a park dedicated to the white stork (Ciconia ciconia) which is freely accessible.

They are so named because they are analogues in quantum theories of gravity of instantons in Yang-Mills theory. In accordance with this analogy with self-dual Yang-Mills instantons, gravitational instantons are usually assumed to look like four dimensional Euclidean space at large distances, and to have a self-dual Riemann tensor. Mathematically, this means that they are asymptotically locally Euclidean (or perhaps asymptotically locally flat) hyperk√§hler 4-manifolds, and in this sense, they are special examples of Einstein manifolds. From a physical point of view, a gravitational instanton is a non-singular solution of the vacuum Einstein equations with positive-definite, as opposed to Lorentzian, metric. There are many possible generalizations of the original conception of a gravitational instanton: for example one can allow gravitational instantons to have a nonzero cosmological constant or a Riemann tensor which is not self-dual. One can also relax the boundary condition that the metric is asymptotically Euclidean. There are many methods for constructing gravitational instantons, including the Gibbons- Hawking Ansatz, twistor theory, and the hyperk√§hler quotient construction. Introduction  Gravitational instantons are interesting, as they offer insights into the quantization of gravity. For example, positive definite asymptotically locally Euclidean metrics are needed as they obey the positive- action conjecture; actions that are unbounded below create divergence in the quantum path integral. * A four-dimensional K√§hler‚ÄìEinstein manifold has a self-dual Riemann tensor. * Equivalently, a self-dual gravitational instanton is a four-dimensional complete hyperk√§hler manifold. * Gravitational instantons are analogous to self-dual Yang‚ÄìMills instantons. Several distinctions can be made with respect to the structure of the Riemann curvature tensor, pertaining to flatness and self-duality. These include: * Einstein (non-zero cosmological constant) * Ricci flatness (vanishing Ricci tensor) * Conformal flatness (vanishing Weyl tensor) * Self-duality * Anti- self-duality * Conformally self-dual * Conformally anti-self-dual  Taxonomy  By specifying the 'boundary conditions', i.e. the asymptotics of the metric 'at infinity' on a noncompact Riemannian manifold, gravitational instantons are divided into a few classes, such as asymptotically locally Euclidean spaces (ALE spaces), asymptotically locally flat spaces (ALF spaces). They can be further characterized by whether the Riemann tensor is self-dual, whether the Weyl tensor is self-dual, or neither; whether or not they are Kahler manifolds; and various characteristic classes, such as Euler characteristic, the Hirzebruch signature (Pontryagin class), the Rarita‚ÄîSchwinger index (spin-3/2 index), or generally the Chern class. The ability to support a spin structure (i.e. to allow consistent Dirac spinors) is another appealing feature.  List of examples  Eguchi et al. list a number of examples of gravitational instantons. These include, among others: * Flat space \\\\mathbb{R}^4, the torus \\\\mathbb{T}^4 and the Euclidean de Sitter space \\\\mathbb{S}^4, i.e. the standard metric on the 4-sphere. * The product of spheres S^2\\\\times S^2. * The Schwarzschild metric \\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\times S^2 and the Kerr metric \\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\times S^2 * The Eguchi-Hanson instanton T^*\\\\mathbb{CP}(1), given below. * The Taub-NUT solution, given below. * The Fubini-Study metric on the complex projective plane \\\\mathbb{CP}(2). Note that the complex projective plane does not support well-defined Dirac spinors. That is, it is not a spin structure. It can be given a spinc structure, however. * Page space, a rotating compact metric on the direct sum of two complex projective planes \\\\mathbb{CP}(2)\\\\oplus\\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{CP}}(2). * The Gibbons-Hawking multi-center metrics, given below. * The Taub-bolt metric \\\\mathbb{CP}(2)- \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} and the rotating Taub-bolt metric. The \\"bolt\\" metrics have a cylindrical-type coordinate singularity at the origin, as compared to the \\"nut\\" metrics, which have a sphere coordinate singularity. In both cases, the coordinate singularity can be removed by switching to Euclidean coordinates at the origin. * The K3 surfaces. * The asymptotically locally Euclidean self-dual manifolds, including the lens spaces L(k + 1, 1), the double-coverings of the dihedral groups, the tetrahedral group, the octahedral group, and the icosahedral group. Note that L(2, 1) corresponds to the Eguchi- Hanson instanton, while for higher k, the L(2, 1) corresponds to the Gibbons- Hawking multi-center metrics. This is an incomplete list; there are others.  Examples  It will be convenient to write the gravitational instanton solutions below using left-invariant 1-forms on the three-sphere S3 (viewed as the group Sp(1) or SU(2)). These can be defined in terms of Euler angles by :\\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma_1 &= \\\\sin \\\\psi \\\\, d \\\\theta - \\\\cos \\\\psi \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\, d \\\\phi  \\\\sigma_2 &= \\\\cos \\\\psi \\\\, d \\\\theta + \\\\sin \\\\psi \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\, d \\\\phi  \\\\sigma_3 &= d \\\\psi + \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\, d \\\\phi.  \\\\end{align} Note that d\\\\sigma_i + \\\\sigma_j \\\\wedge \\\\sigma_k=0 for i,j,k=1,2,3 cyclic. = Taub-NUT metric = : ds^2 = \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\frac{r+n}{r-n} dr^2 + \\\\frac{r-n}{r+n} n^2 {\\\\sigma_3}^2 + \\\\frac{1}{4}(r^2 - n^2)({\\\\sigma_1}^2 + {\\\\sigma_2}^2) = Eguchi‚ÄìHanson metric = The Eguchi‚ÄìHanson space is defined by a metric the cotangent bundle of the 2-sphere T^*\\\\mathbb{CP}(1)=T^*S^2. This metric is : ds^2 = \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{a}{r^4} \\\\right) ^{-1} dr^2 + \\\\frac{r^2}{4} \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{a}{r^4} \\\\right) {\\\\sigma_3}^2 + \\\\frac{r^2}{4} (\\\\sigma_1^2 + \\\\sigma_2^2). where r \\\\ge a^{1/4}. This metric is smooth everywhere if it has no conical singularity at r \\\\rightarrow a^{1/4}, \\\\theta = 0, \\\\pi. For a = 0 this happens if \\\\psi has a period of 4\\\\pi, which gives a flat metric on R4; However, for a e 0 this happens if \\\\psi has a period of 2\\\\pi. Asymptotically (i.e., in the limit r \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty) the metric looks like : ds^2 = dr^2 + \\\\frac{r^2}{4} \\\\sigma_3^2 + \\\\frac{r^2}{4} (\\\\sigma_1^2 + \\\\sigma_2^2) which naively seems as the flat metric on R4. However, for a e 0, \\\\psi has only half the usual periodicity, as we have seen. Thus the metric is asymptotically R4 with the identification \\\\psi\\\\, {\\\\sim}\\\\, \\\\psi + 2\\\\pi, which is a Z2 subgroup of SO(4), the rotation group of R4. Therefore, the metric is said to be asymptotically R4/Z2. There is a transformation to another coordinate system, in which the metric looks like : ds^2 = \\\\frac{1}{V(\\\\mathbf{x})} ( d \\\\psi + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\cdot d \\\\mathbf{x})^2 + V(\\\\mathbf{x}) d \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\cdot d \\\\mathbf{x}, where abla V = \\\\pm abla \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}, \\\\quad V = \\\\sum_{i=1}^2 \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x}_i }. :(For a = 0, V = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf{x}}, and the new coordinates are defined as follows: one first defines \\\\rho=r^2/4 and then parametrizes \\\\rho, \\\\theta and \\\\phi by the R3 coordinates \\\\mathbf{x}, i.e. \\\\mathbf{x}=(\\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\cos \\\\phi, \\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\phi,\\\\rho \\\\cos\\\\theta) ). In the new coordinates, \\\\psi has the usual periodicity \\\\psi\\\\ {\\\\sim}\\\\ \\\\psi + 4\\\\pi. One may replace V by :\\\\quad V = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{x}_i}. For some n points \\\\mathbf{x}_i, i = 1, 2..., n. This gives a multi-center Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instanton, which is again smooth everywhere if the angular coordinates have the usual periodicities (to avoid conical singularities). The asymptotic limit (r\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty) is equivalent to taking all \\\\mathbf{x}_i to zero, and by changing coordinates back to r, \\\\theta and \\\\phi, and redefining r\\\\rightarrow r/\\\\sqrt{n}, we get the asymptotic metric : ds^2 = dr^2 + \\\\frac{r^2}{4} \\\\left({d\\\\psi\\\\over n} + \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\phi\\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{r^2}{4} [(\\\\sigma_1^L)^2 + (\\\\sigma_2^L)^2]. This is R4/Zn = C2/Zn, because it is R4 with the angular coordinate \\\\psi replaced by \\\\psi/n, which has the wrong periodicity (4\\\\pi/n instead of 4\\\\pi). In other words, it is R4 identified under \\\\psi\\\\ {\\\\sim}\\\\ \\\\psi + 4\\\\pi k/n, or, equivalently, C2 identified under zi ~ e^{2\\\\pi i k/n} zi for i = 1, 2. To conclude, the multi- center Eguchi-Hanson geometry is a K√§hler Ricci flat geometry which is asymptotically C2/Zn. According to Yau's theorem this is the only geometry satisfying these properties. Therefore, this is also the geometry of a C2/Zn orbifold in string theory after its conical singularity has been smoothed away by its \\"blow up\\" (i.e., deformation). = Gibbons-Hawking multi-centre metrics = The Gibbons-Hawking multi-center metrics are given by : ds^2 = \\\\frac{1}{V(\\\\mathbf{x})} ( d \\\\tau + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\cdot d \\\\mathbf{x})^2 + V(\\\\mathbf{x}) d \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\cdot d \\\\mathbf{x}, where : abla V = \\\\pm abla \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}, \\\\quad V = \\\\varepsilon + 2M \\\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{x}_i  }. Here, \\\\epsilon = 1 corresponds to multi-Taub-NUT, \\\\epsilon = 0 and k = 1 is flat space, and \\\\epsilon = 0 and k = 2 is the Eguchi-Hanson solution (in different coordinates).

' is the act of strolling, with all of its accompanying associations. A near-synonym of the noun is '. Traditionally depicted as male, a is an ambivalent figure of urban affluence and modernity, representing the ability to wander detached from society with no other purpose than to be an acute observer of industrialized, contemporary life. The was, first of all, a literary type from 19th-century France, essential to any picture of the streets of Paris. The word carried a set of rich associations: the man of leisure, the idler, the urban explorer, the connoisseur of the street. It was Walter Benjamin, drawing on the poetry of Charles Baudelaire, who made this figure the object of scholarly interest in the 20th century, as an emblematic archetype of urban, modern (even modernist) experience. Following Benjamin, the has become an important symbol for scholars, artists, and writers. The classic French female counterpart is the ', dating to the works of Marcel Proust, though a 21st-century academic coinage is ', and some English-language writers simply apply the masculine also to women. The term has acquired an additional architecture and urban planning sense, referring to passers-by who experience incidental or intentional psychological effects from the design of a structure. Etymology Charles Baudelaire derives from the Old Norse verb , 'to wander with no purpose'. The terms of date to the 16th or 17th century, denoting strolling, idling, often with the connotation of wasting time. But it was in the 19th century that a rich set of meanings and definitions surrounding the took shape. The was defined in 1872 in a long article in Pierre Larousse's . It described the in ambivalent terms, equal parts curiosity and laziness, and presented a taxonomy of : of the boulevards, of parks, of the arcades, of caf√©s; mindless and intelligent ones.\\" By then, the term had already developed a rich set of associations. Sainte-Beuve wrote that to \\"is the very opposite of doing nothing\\". Honor√© de Balzac described as \\"the gastronomy of the eye\\". Ana√Øs Bazin wrote that \\"the only, the true sovereign of Paris is the \\". Victor Fournel, in (What One Sees in the Streets of Paris, 1867), devoted a chapter to \\"the art of \\". For Fournel, there was nothing lazy in . It was, rather, a way of understanding the rich variety of the city landscape; it was like \\"a mobile and passionate photograph\\" (\\"\\") of urban experience. In the 1860s, in the midst of the rebuilding of Paris under Napoleon III and the Baron Haussmann, Charles Baudelaire presented a memorable portrait of the as the artist-poet of the modern metropolis: Originally published, in French, in Le Figaro, 1863. Drawing on Fournel, and on his analysis of the poetry of Baudelaire, Walter Benjamin described the as the essential figure of the modern urban spectator, an amateur detective and investigator of the city. More than this, his was a sign of the alienation of the city and of capitalism. For Benjamin, the met his demise with the triumph of consumer capitalism. In these texts, the was often juxtaposed and contrasted with the figure of the , the gawker or gaper. Fournel wrote: \\"The must not be confused with the ; a nuance should be observed there .... The simple is always in full possession of his individuality, whereas the individuality of the disappears. It is absorbed by the outside world ... which intoxicates him to the point where he forgets himself. Under the influence of the spectacle which presents itself to him, the becomes an impersonal creature; he is no longer a human being, he is part of the public, of the crowd.\\" In the decades since Benjamin, the has been the subject of a remarkable number of appropriations and interpretations. The figure of the has been used‚Äîamong other things ‚Äì to explain modern, urban experience, to explain urban spectatorship, to explain the class tensions and gender divisions of the nineteenth-century city, to describe modern alienation, to explain the sources of mass culture, to explain the postmodern spectatorial gaze.See, among others: ; ; ; ; ; ; . And it has served as a source of inspiration to writers and artists. Female counterparts The historical feminine rough equivalent of the , the (French for 'walker', 'passer-by'), appears in particular in the work of Marcel Proust. He portrayed several of his female characters as elusive, passing figures, who tended to ignore his obsessive (and at times possessive) view of them. Increasing freedoms and social innovations such as industrialization later allowed the to become an active participant in the 19th century metropolis, as women's social roles expanded away from the domestic and the private, into the public and urban spheres. Twenty-first century literary criticism and gender studies scholarship has also proposed for the female equivalent of the , with some additional feminist re-analysis. In less academic contexts, such as newspaper book reviews, the grammatically masculine is also applied to women (including modern ones) in essentially the same senses as for the original male referents, at least in English-language borrowings of the term.E.g.: Urban life Gustave Caillebotte. Paris Street, Rainy Day, 1877. Art Institute of Chicago. Gustave Caillebotte, Le Pont de l'Europe, oil on canvas, 1876. Mus√©e du Petit Palais, Geneva. While Baudelaire characterized the as a \\"gentleman stroller of city streets\\", he saw the as having a key role in understanding, participating in, and portraying the city. A thus played a double role in city life and in theory, that is, while remaining a detached observer. This stance, simultaneously and , combines sociological, anthropological, literary, and historical notions of the relationship between the individual and the greater populace. In the period after the French Revolution of 1848, during which the Empire was reestablished with clearly bourgeois pretensions of \\"order\\" and \\"morals\\", Baudelaire began asserting that traditional art was inadequate for the new dynamic complications of modern life. Social and economic changes brought by industrialization demanded that the artist immerse himself in the metropolis and become, in Baudelaire's phrase, \\"a botanist of the sidewalk\\". David Harvey asserts that \\"Baudelaire would be torn the rest of his life between the stances of and dandy, a disengaged and cynical voyeur on the one hand, and man of the people who enters into the life of his subjects with passion on the other\\".Paris: Capital of Modernity 14. The observer‚Äìparticipant dialectic is evidenced in part by the dandy culture. Highly self-aware, and to a certain degree flamboyant and theatrical, dandies of the mid-nineteenth century created scenes through self-consciously outrageous acts like walking turtles on leashes down the streets of Paris. Such acts exemplify a 's active participation in and fascination with street life while displaying a critical attitude towards the uniformity, speed, and anonymity of modern life in the city. The concept of the is important in academic discussions of the phenomenon of modernity. While Baudelaire's aesthetic and critical visions helped open up the modern city as a space for investigation, theorists such as Georg Simmel began to codify the urban experience in more sociological and psychological terms. In his essay \\"The Metropolis and Mental Life\\", Simmel theorized that the complexities of the modern city create new social bonds and new attitudes towards others. The modern city was transforming humans, giving them a new relationship to time and space, inculcating in them a \\" attitude\\", and altering fundamental notions of freedom and being: Writing in 1962, Cornelia Otis Skinner suggested that there was no English equivalent of the term: \\"there is no Anglo-Saxon counterpart of that essentially Gallic individual, the deliberately aimless pedestrian, unencumbered by any obligation or sense of urgency, who, being French and therefore frugal, wastes nothing, including his time which he spends with the leisurely discrimination of a gourmet, savoring the multiple flavors of his city.\\" Architecture and urban planning The concept of the has also become meaningful in the psychogeography of architecture and urban planning, describing people who are indirectly and (usually) unintentionally affected by a particular design they experience only in passing. In 1917, the Swiss writer Robert Walser published a short story called \\"\\" (\\"The Walk\\"), a veritable outcome of the literature. Walter Benjamin adopted the concept of the urban observer both as an analytical tool and as a lifestyle. From his Marxist standpoint, Benjamin describes the as a product of modern life and the Industrial Revolution without precedent, a parallel to the advent of the tourist. His is an uninvolved but highly perceptive bourgeois dilettante. Benjamin became his own prime example, making social and aesthetic observations during long walks through Paris. Even the title of his unfinished Arcades Project comes from his affection for covered shopping streets. In the context of modern-day architecture and urban planning, designing for is one way to approach the psychological aspects of the built environment. Photography The 's tendency toward detached but aesthetically attuned observation has brought the term into the literature of photography, particularly street photography. The street photographer is seen as one modern extension of the urban observer described by nineteenth century journalist Victor Fournel before the advent of the hand-held camera: The most notable application of to street photography probably comes from Susan Sontag in her 1977 collection of essays, On Photography. She describes how, since the development of hand-held cameras in the early 20th century, the camera has become the tool of the : Other uses The concept is not limited to someone committing the physical act of a peripatetic stroll in the Baudelairian sense, but can also include a \\"complete philosophical way of living and thinking\\", and a process of navigating erudition as described by Nassim Nicholas Taleb's essay \\"Why I Walk\\". Taleb further set this term with a positive connotation referring to anyone pursuing open, flexible plans, in opposition to the negative \\"touristification\\", which he defines as the pursuit of an overly orderly plan. Louis Menand, in seeking to describe the poet T. S. Eliot's relationship to English literary society and his role in the formation of modernism, describes Eliot as a . Moreover, in one of Eliot's well-known poems, \\"The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock\\", the protagonist takes the reader for a journey through his city in the manner of a . Using the term more critically, in \\"De Profundis\\", Oscar Wilde wrote from prison about his life regrets, stating: \\"I let myself be lured into long spells of senseless and sensual ease. I amused myself with being a flaneur, a dandy, a man of fashion. I surrounded myself with the smaller natures and the meaner minds.\\" (1905).

Biography After obtaining bachelor's degrees in mathematics and philosophy from the University of Illinois, Lynch accepted a position in 1979 as an engineering physicist at Fermilab where he spent some time working on the PDP-11 hardware project. In his spare time, he worked on developing his thesis into a book, which he planned to title Abstract Evolution. Lynch worked extensively on the theoretical underpinnings of idea self-replication, developing a symbolic language and deriving mathematics from epidemiologic formulae to describe idea transmission through populations. While conducting a literature search for his book, Lynch discovered the work of anthropologist F.T. Cloak on socially transmitted technology in birds, and a brief proposal for a field of Memetics in Richard Dawkins' book, The Selfish Gene, although Lynch was not aware of these authors' work until after his own theory was substantially developed. Early chapters of his book came to the attention of Douglas Hofstadter, who featured it in his Scientific American column Metamagical Themas in 1983. The first draft of the book was complete as early as 1984. A grant from a former colleague who had become a video-technology millionaire enabled Lynch to leave Fermilab in 1990 and concentrate full-time on writing. In the early 1990s, he contributed theoretical and mathematical models on idea transmission to the Journal of Ideas, the first scholarly journal dedicated to memetics. Lynch's book, after considerable revision, was eventually published in 1996 as Thought Contagion: How Belief Spreads Through Society. In 1998, Lynch's \\"Units, Events and Dynamics in Memetic Evolution\\" provided much of the scholarly theoretical work omitted from \\"Thought Contagion\\". The paper detailed precise conceptual definitions of memetic terms, symbolic language to model idea replication, and mathematics to model population level idea transmission summarizing a decade of his conceptual work. In August 2004, Lynch appeared to accuse Fast Company magazine and Seth Godin of plagiarism, claiming his complaint was backed, or even encouraged, by an unnamed 'major writers organization'.Fastcompany Aaron Lynch died on November 14, 2005, at the age of 47, from anoxic encephalopathy after taking an overdose of an opiate-based pain killer, described as an accident in the Cook County, Illinois Coroner's Report. His remains are buried in Homewood Gardens in Homewood, Illinois. Outline of Lynch's theory Lynch first developed the themes of Thought Contagion in his 1979 undergraduate senior thesis entitled \\"Abstract Evolution.\\" The thesis explored the notion that an idea which can influence human behavior may blindly evolve the capacity to influence its own prevalence in the human population by motivating its human hosts to engage in behavior that spreads the idea. Just as a virus which elicits sneezes from its human host is more likely to survive by passing from host to host than a similar but non-sneeze-provoking virus, Lynch hypothesized that an idea which stimulated its host to proselytize, e.g., \\"Go and make disciples of all nations\\" (Gospel of Matthew 28:19), would be more likely to survive and become popular than an idea which did not elicit such activity. He identified other mechanisms which might also increase an idea's market share and longevity, such as influencing the human host to produce more children than it otherwise would, to instruct one's children in the belief earlier and more rigorously than one otherwise might, to isolate or effectively immunize oneself or one's children from exposure to competing ideas, to actively impede the communications of nonbelievers, or to utilize mass communications media to spread the idea to people that the host would never personally meet. Cultural anthropology had long held that cultural beliefs and information‚Äîi.e., socially propagated ideas‚Äîsurvive and propagate because of the survival value they provide to the human groups that adopt them. Lynch embraced this notion of host-benefiting idea propagation, but his analysis added to this the notion that ideas could also propagate at the expense of their human hosts. He noted, for example, that beliefs which induced their hosts into self-sacrifice before sufficiently large audiences (e.g. earlier Christians refusing to worship the Emperor and dying serenely in Roman arenas or Islamist suicide bombers taping farewell videos for posthumous broadcast to worldwide audiences) could survive or even multiply just by capturing one or more hosts to replace the one it sacrificed. Lynch questions whether ideas might be \\"shopping\\" for humans as well as vice versa, and asked whether humans own their most cherished beliefs or the beliefs own them. However, Lynch stopped short of suggesting that ideas have consciousness, will or planning abilities. To Lynch, ideas were information encoded in human neurons or other media. Like computer viruses, they are the products of human thinking and are in no way aware of or deliberating controlling their self-replicating abilities. However, unlike computer viruses, ideas often evolve new or improved contagious properties without intentional human design, through copying infidelity mutations or recombination into powerful new belief sets. According to Lynch, Natural selection determines which ideas survive and propagate successfully through human populations and which lose market share to the point of extinction. Lynch's thesis offered an explanation for how not only true and useful ideas, but also unprovable or even false notions with sufficiently \\"contagious\\" properties could, over generations, become the predominant beliefs of whole societies. While he insisted that the contagiousness of ideas was largely independent of their truth value, as he immersed himself in this analysis, his frequently uttered motto became, \\"People don't learn from each other's mistakes. They learn each other's mistakes.\\" Reception and criticism Lynch's work encountered mixed reception among academics and among other memeticists. Some typical criticisms include the following: # Lynch's work is theoretical, as yet unproven by empirical or computer simulation research. # Lynch cites few of the works within the historic literature of social science which foreshadow a theory of social contagion. # Some memeticists dispute his definition of the meme (see memetics article).

In the , Nundah had a population of 12,141 people. Prior to European settlement, Nundah was inhabited by Aboriginal people from the Turrbul tribe. Nundah is primarily a residential suburb, which straddles Sandgate Road, one of the major arterial roads of Brisbane's north. It was first settled by Europeans in the mid-19th century, although the suburb remained primarily a rural area until it was connected to Brisbane via railway in the 1880s. Originally considered a working-class suburb, the area has become gentrified in recent years, and today features a mix of traditional worker's cottages and modern high-density apartment blocks. It is close to the Centro Shopping Centre. Geography Nundah is a mixed-density residential suburb, with some light industry and a commercial retail area concentrated on Sandgate Road. It is adjacent to the suburbs of Clayfield, Northgate and Wavell Heights, and is dominated by a large ridge that runs from the northwest to the southeast. The \\"Nundah Village\\" shopping district and Nundah State School are on this ridge, while the George Bridges Tunnel bisects it along Sandgate Road. The suburb includes the locality and formerly distinct suburb of Toombul, which is centred in the south of Nundah, around Sandgate Road. Various facilities in Nundah are named after this locality, including the large shopping centre Centro Toombul, Toombul Bus Station and the Toombul railway station. Schulz Canal runs through Nundah, bisecting the Toombul Shopping Centre Carpark. The low elevation of the carpark makes it particularly susceptible to flash flooding during peak storm seasons ‚Äì often claiming the cars of unwary shoppers inside the centre and those attempting to cross the Melton Road bridge. The estuary of the canal is a moderately popular recreational fishing spot. College Estate, Nundah was advertised for public auction on Saturday 5 June 1937 by Cameron Brothers auctioneers. 54 splendid residential sites occupying one of the finest positions in Nundah were for sale. History =Aboriginal history= Like most of Northern Brisbane, the area around Nundah was dominated by the Turrbul tribe. Their traditional coastal trade route passed through Nundah, near the modern-day Hedley Avenue. There are also many significant Aboriginal sites near Nundah, such as Dinah Island, which was reportedly the site of the last traditional Aboriginal burial in the Brisbane area. There were a number of bora rings in the area, indicating that the Nundah area was densely populated by Aboriginal people before European settlers arrived. =European settlement= German mission Memorial to the German Missionaries erected in 1938 for the area's centennialThe first permanent European settlement in the area was a mission built in 1838 by German Lutheran missionaries,These missionaries were: * Peter Niquet ‚Äì mason (married) * August Rode ‚Äì cabinet-maker (married) * Johann Leopold Zillmann ‚Äì blacksmith (married) * Gottfried Haussmann ‚Äì farmer (married) * Wilhelm Hartenstein ‚Äì weaver (married) * Carl Franz ‚Äì tailor * Gottfried Wagner ‚Äì shoemaker * August Olbrecht ‚Äì shoemaker * Ludwig Doege ‚Äì gardener * Moritz Schneider ‚Äì medical missionary (married) * Carl Wilhelm Schmidt ‚Äì ordained minister * Christoph Eipper ‚Äì ordained minister under the guidance of Reverend Carl Wilhelm Schmidt and later Reverend Christoph Eipper with the aim of bringing Christianity to the local Aboriginal people. They first called the area \\"Zion\\", and the mission was located in the vicinity of the modern-day street \\"Walkers Way\\". It later became \\"German Station\\". The explorer Dr. Ludwig Leichhardt visited the area in 1843, and spoke very highly of the mission, but despite this the mission met with limited success and was closed at the behest of the colonial government in 1846. This first settlement is nonetheless commemorated with a monument at the corner of Sandgate Road and Wood Street unveiled in 1938 by the then Premier of Queensland William Forgan Smith. The names of these German settlers can be seen in the names of streets in Nundah and surrounding suburbs such as Rode Road and Gerler Road. Growth of the village of German Station A prominent local citizen who contributed significantly to the development of the village of German Station was George Bridges (1820‚Äì1898). George and his young family immigrated from Wilstead, Bedfordshire, England to Queensland in 1852 aboard the \\"Marie Somes\\". In 1855, he acquired of land north of Buckland Road and east of Sandgate Road for farming. However, as Sandgate became an increasingly popular holiday destination, the increasing volume of coach traffic along Sandgate Road encouraged him to open a hotel, which became a popular stop being roughly halfway between Brisbane and Sandgate. The first hotel was called the Kedron Hotel but the third and longest-running hotel was known as the Kedron Brook Hotel and was located alongside Sandgate Road (now Bage St) on the SW corner of his property. Emboldened by the success of his hotel ventures, George Bridges looked for other commercial opportunities. He observed that Sandgate Road at that time did a dog-leg around the SW corner of his property (along Buckland Road) which forced traffic to travel up and over Donkin's Hill. So he created a short-cut across the SW corner of his property that avoided the hill, which was much appreciated by the travellers, allowing George Bridges to sell off parcels of land along this new unofficial piece of Sandgate Road to commercial enterprises, which serviced both the travellers and the local farming community. This unofficial short-cut grew into the Nundah Village shopping street that exists today and eventually became the official route of Sandgate Road. Around 1872, George and his wife Mary retired to Burpengary and began to progressively sell off the land of their German Station property as the village developed. Architectural plans for school and teachers residences at German Station, circa 1880 Creation of the suburb of Nundah German Station State School opened on 2 October 1865 and was renamed Nundah State School in 1895. German Station remained an agricultural area until the 1880s. In 1881, Queensland State Government purchased a strip of land across George Bridges's property to build a railway link between Brisbane and Sandgate. The railway opened in 1882 and resulted in a suburban residential construction boom on Brisbane's northside. This urban sprawl was also encouraged by the Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885, which mandated minimum lot sizes for new urban developments. The village of German Station became known as a location where working-class families could obtain cheap housing on reasonably sized lots not too far from the city. George Bridges sold off his remaining land for residential development in the new suburb. A railway station called German was created in 1882 (again on land originally owned by George Bridges), because they wanted the station to be called German Station rather than German Station Station. However, six weeks after the railway station opened, it was renamed Nundah. The name Nundah is a corruption of the Yuggera language, Turrbal dialect word nanda meaning chain of water holes. This name is probably a reference to the nearby natural water sources at Kedron Brook and the marshy areas formerly to the east of the suburb. In 1888, the name of the Post Office was also changed to Nundah, signalling the renaming of the new suburb. However, the name German Station persisted for many years. For many years it was common to find references to Nundah with the annotation \\"formerly German Station\\" in newspapers and advertisements, until the name Nundah was well established. In 1883 William Alexander Jenyns Boyd relocated his Eton Preparatory School from Milton (where it was established in 1877) to Nundah, where he erected new buildings at a cost of ¬£3,000 on a site. In 1889 Boyd was forced to close the school due to economic hardships preventing families being able to afford to send their sons to boarding school, but he re-opened the school in 1891. However the impacts of the 1893 Brisbane flood forced him to close the school permanently. In June 1893 the Sisters of the Society of the Sacred Advent acquired Eton House to run a boarding school for orphan girls called The Home of the Good Shepherd, which in 1894 also took in paying students as well with Miss Isabelle Caine as headmistress under the management of Sister Emma. In 1897 the orphans were relocated to Ormiston Place, leaving Eton House as a private boarding school known as the Eton High School for Girls. In 1907, the school relocated to Toorak House in Hamilton and then in 1910 to Albion Heights (now Ascot) where it is known as St Margaret's Anglican Girls' School. In 1907 the St Francis Anglican Theological College moved into Eton House under Canon Tomlin. In 1936-7 the theological college relocated to Bishopsbourne in Milton. By June 1937 Eton House had been sold for removal and its grounds subdivided, but the site is believed to be bounded by Bishop Street, Buckland Road, Wand Street and Olive Street (). Boyd Road leads to this area and presumably commemorates Boyd who established the site. From 1890, Nundah was the seat of the Shire of Toombul, which was absorbed into the City of Greater Brisbane in 1925. The Toombul Shire Hall still exists as a community centre. In 1909, Surrey Street in Nundah became the site of the first public housing dwelling in Queensland. In the early twentieth century, Nundah became a major suburban centre, due to its location on Sandgate Road, one of Brisbane's busiest arterial roads, and the adjacent Nundah railway station. Sandgate Road and nearby streets were lined with shops, pubs, cinemas and other commercial premises. St Joseph's Convent and School was dedicated and opened on Sunday 16 January 1916 by James Duhig, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane. The site consisting of Marston House and of land was donated by Harry Donkin. The Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart came from Sydney the previous week to operate the school. It heralded the welcome return of the order to Brisbane after an absence of 36 years after Archbishop James O'Quinn directed the order to leave his diocese in 1879 following disputes with Mary McKillop over control of the schools operated by the Sisters. The Shire of Toombul War Memorial was dedicated by the Governor of Queensland, Matthew Nathan, on 12 November 1921. The memorial commemorates who served in World War I. It is located in Nundah Memorial Park (then known as Buckland Park) (). In November and December 1923, '10 Choice Allotments', were advertised as \\"Wheeler Estate\\", to be auctioned by Isles, Love & Co. Limited Auctioneers on 1 December 1923. This estate was bounded by Sandgate Road to the west, by London Street to the east, and Northgate Road to the north. In 1926, George Walker suggested a monument be built to mark the beginnings of Nundah, which was unveiled by the Queensland Governor Sir Leslie Orme Wilson on 23 April 1938 as part of the First Free Settlers' Centenary Celebrations. This First Free Settlers Monument is listed in the Queensland Heritage Register. Mount St Joseph's Boarding & Day School for girlds opened in 1953. It was operated by Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart. In 1964 it was renamed Corpus Christi College. In 2009, it was renamed Mary McKillop College to commemorate the 100th anniversary of her death and her canonisation. St. George's Anglican Mission Hall in Toombul was dedicated on 11 April 1953 by Archbishop Reginald Halse. Its closure on 28 June 1987 was approved by Assistant Bishop George Browning. Decline of Nundah Nundah's commercial precinct suffered a precipitous decline from the 1970s with the construction of the nearby Westfield Shoppingtown (Later Centro) Toombul shopping centre. Increasing motor traffic along Sandgate Road also reduced Nundah's appeal as a shopping precinct as it was difficult to park. Gradually many shops closed, and those that opened in their place were often \\"low-class\\" establishments such as pawn brokers, charity stores etc. that were unappealing to most shoppers, driving them increasingly to shop at Toombul. Renewal of Nundah However, in 2001 a road tunnel was constructed under nearby Bage Street, diverting through traffic away from the suburban centre. There was considerable popular supportLetter to Dept of Main Roads from Nundah & Districts Historical Society, 1 May 2001 to name the road tunnel after George Bridges in recognition of his contribution to the development of the district and the fact that the tunnel was located on his original land holding. However, the local member Liddy Clark would not support it for fear it would offend the Aboriginal community. In 2009 as part of Queenslands 150th Birthday Celebrations, the Nundah Bypass Tunnel was renamed \\"George Bridges Tunnel\\". In 2008 the Brisbane City Council suburban renewal programme has seen new art installations, caf√©s and commercial enterprises open in Nundah, creating a village-like atmosphere along the now-quiet Sandgate Road. The suburb has now become popular among white collar workers seeking relatively inexpensive housing and apartments only a moderate distance from the Brisbane CBD. Since then, along with the rest of the city, housing prices in the area have skyrocketed, pricing most of the traditional working class out of the suburb. In the , Nundah had a population of 12,141 people.  Heritage listings  The Toombul Shire Hall is a heritage-listed building in Nundah. Corpus Christi Church, 2015 Nundah has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 41 Bage Street: Nundah State School * 136 Buckland Road: Corpus Christi Church * 88 Hedley Avenue: Nundah Cemetery * Sandgate Road: First Free Settlers Monument * Sandgate Road: Nundah Air Raid Shelter * 1141 Sandgate Road: Toombul Shire Hall * 35 Surrey Street: Workers' Dwelling No.1 * 7 Union Street: Nundah Fire Station Demographics In the the population of Nundah was 12,141, 50.5% female and 49.5% male. The median age of the Nundah population was 33 years of age, 5 years below the Australian median. 63.1% of people living in Nundah were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 66.7%; the next most common countries of birth were India 5.9%, New Zealand 4.5%, England 3.2%, Philippines 1.4% and Nepal 1.3%. 72.7% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were Punjabi 2.2%, Hindi 1.6%, Nepali 1.3%, Mandarin 1.3% and Spanish 1.0%. Transport Due to its inner-northern location, there are a variety of options for transport within the suburb. Both the Nundah City railway station and the Toombul City railway station are located within the suburb. Both of these railway stations are on both the Caboolture Line and the Shorncliffe railway line, giving both stations 15-minute frequencies throughout the day seven days a week. There are many council bus services that run through the area, including the Great Circle Line. The Nundah Bypass is a road tunnel, open to general traffic, that runs underneath the Nundah Village commercial area. Completed in 2001, it provides an alternative route to traffic travelling along Sandgate Road, allowing motorists to avoid the narrow streets of the village area, and reducing traffic congestion for local residents. Commerce Nundah Village shopping centre Nundah retails a traditional \\"shopping strip\\" commercial district, centred mainly along the section of Sandgate Road that has been bypassed by the Nundah Bypass. There are plenty of cafes and speciality shops, as well as some medical facilities. There is also a small shopping centre anchored by a Woolworths supermarket, which was opened in mid-2007, containing over 200 parking spots, a Subway store, a Coffee Club, and numerous other small shops. There are proposals to relocate the Nundah Library into the Nundah Village district. The current Nundah Public Library opened in 1968 and had a major refurbishment in 2016.  Governance  Nundah is in the federal electorate of Lilley. The seat has been held by Wayne Swan of the Australian Labor Party since the 1998 federal election. The suburb lies on the border between the state electorates of Clayfield (held by Liberal Tim Nicholls), and Nudgee (held by Labor's Leanne Linard). Locally, the suburb is part of the Northgate Ward, held by LNP's Adam Allan. In earlier times, it was part of the Nundah electorate, one of the historical Electoral districts of Queensland. Toombul District Cricket Club The Toombul District Cricket Club is directly across Duke Street from Nundah Train Station. It covers 3.5 hectares, and is bordered by York Street, Duke Street, Melton Road and Jenner Street. The club was founded in 1882, and has been based at Oxenham Park in the heart of Nundah since 1906. The cricket club provides a family friendly, relaxed atmosphere for local residents to take in a match on Saturdays and Sundays during summer, and enhances the village feel of Nundah by being an exceptionally welcoming club, with full bar and canteen facilities open to locals. In March 2017, Toombul completed renovations to the clubhouse, updating it to become the first rooftop bar in Nundah. Famous players that have played for Toombul at Oxenham Park over the years include three of Don Bradman's 1948 Invincibles; Bill Brown (cricketer), Don Tallon, and Colin McCool. Others include Jeff Thomson, Ken Mackay, Ron Oxenham, Ryan Harris, Matt Renshaw, Chris Lynn and Wally Grout.

He co-created the fictional characters Jonah Hex and Black Orchid. DeZuniga was the first Filipino comic book artist whose work was accepted by American publishers, paving the way for many other Filipino artists to enter the international comic book industry. Biography =Early life and career= DeZuniga began his comics career at the age of 16, as a letterer for Liwayway, a Filipino weekly magazine whose contributors included comic book artists Alfredo Alcala and Nestor Redondo, who would later become his mentors. He eventually received a Bachelor of Science degree in commercial art from the University of Santo Tomas in the Philippines. In 1962, he came to the United States to study graphic design in New York City. He returned to his native country to work in advertising and to freelance for Filipino comics. When he returned to New York City in the late 1960s, DeZuniga entered the American comic book market under editor Joe Orlando at DC Comics, inking pencil art by Ric Estrada on a romance comics tale for Girl's Love Stories #153. DeZuniga's U.S. debut as a penciler came with a self-inked horror story for House of Mystery #188 (Sept./Oct. 1970). =DC and Marvel Comics= DeZuniga's cover for Weird Western Tales #14 (DC, Oct.-Nov 1972) DeZuniga became a regular contributor at DC. With writer John Albano, he co-created the long-running western character Jonah Hex, and with Sheldon Mayer the first Black Orchid.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 156: \\"Very little was known about the Black Orchid, even after writer Sheldon Mayer and artist Tony DeZuniga presented her so-called \\"origin issue\\" in Adventure Comics.\\" DeZuniga served as an introduction to what would be a 1970s influx of Filipino artists to American comics, prompting Orlando and DC publisher Carmine Infantino to visit the Philippines in 1971 to scout talent. Among the artists found there who would soon become mainstays of both DC and Marvel Comics were Alfredo Alcala, Alex Ni√±o, Nestor Redondo, and Gerry Talaoc. He was responsible for the discovery of artist Steve Gan and was Gan's United States art agent in charge of importing his artwork to Marvel from the Philippines. DeZuniga inked John Buscema's penciled artwork for MGM's Marvelous Wizard of Oz (1975). This comics adaptation of the Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer film was the first joint publishing venture between Marvel and DC Comics. DeZuniga relocated back to New York from the Philippines in 1977.\\"Bullpen Bulletins,\\" Marvel Two-in-One #35 (Jan. 1978). He worked for industry leaders Marvel and DC for 18 years. =Later career= DeZuniga later became a videogame conceptual designer, spending a decade with the United States and Japan divisions of Sega. He did freelance work for McGraw Hill and the Scholastic Corporation, and illustrated for TSR's Dungeons & Dragons game in books such as In Search of Dragons. In 1989, he illustrated The DragonLance Saga Book Three, written by Roy Thomas. Upon retirement, DeZuniga began to do commissioned paintings and to teach art. His work has been the subject of at least one gallery exhibition. He returned to Jonah Hex with Jonah Hex: No Way Back, a graphic novel released to coincide with the Jonah Hex film. = Illness and death = In April 2012, DeZuniga suffered a life-threatening stroke. Doctors were able to save him, but numerous complications quickly arose. Both the Philippine and international comics community made an effort to raise funds for his treatment. During Free Comic Book Day on May 5, 2012, Filipino comic book artists banded together and launched a sketch drive, T-shirt sale and auction to help raise funds.Ringgenberg: \\"Filipino cartoonists pooled their talents on Free Comic Book Day in May to sell sketches and t-shirts to raise money for DeZuniga and his family.\\"/> On May 11, 2012, at 1:25 a.m., DeZuniga died from the stroke having led to his subsequent brain damage and heart failure. The doctors attempted to resuscitate him but were unsuccessful. = Legacy = Accolades for DeZuniga started pouring in after his stroke, even before he died. Fellow comic book creators such as Neal Adams praised him as they encouraged comic book aficionados over the world to help with DeZuniga's hospital expenses.

Retrieved on July 8, 2017. Pages: 1, 2, 3 formerly Robinsonville, is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in northern Tunica County, Mississippi, United States, north of the county seat of Tunica. The community is situated mostly between the Mississippi River and U.S. Route 61 along the border with Arkansas. The population as of the 2010 census was 1,910. Tunica Resorts is the site of six casino resorts, and at one time generated the third largest gambling revenues in the nation, after Las Vegas and Atlantic City, New Jersey, but competition has increased in other locations, including properties owned by Native American tribes and operated on their reservations. The use of the name \\"Tunica\\" by the resorts led to the alternative name of Tunica Resorts to make it easier for tourists to find the destination. History In the first half of the 19th century, this area was developed as cotton plantations, part of what was considered the Mississippi Delta extending north to Memphis and south to Vicksburg. It depended on enslaved labor. After emancipation, many African Americans continued to work in agriculture in this area. In the early decades of the 20th century, thousands of African Americans migrated north from Mississippi to Chicago and other industrial cities in the Great Migration to leave the violence and oppression of the South, as well as the loss of jobs due to mechanization of agriculture. Population also declined in the county as railroads and highways drew off traffic from the river. After 1995, gambling casinos and resorts were developed in the unincorporated community of Robinsonville, north of the county seat of Tunica. In a nod to riverboat gambling, to comply with state law, the casinos are built on floating platforms in the Mississippi River. Lacking the structure of an organized city or town, Tunica Resorts consists mainly of casinos and cotton fields, with few permanent residents living in the community. Tunica Resorts has ranked as high as the third-largest casino-gambling destination in the United States, as measured by gaming revenue, behind Las Vegas, Nevada and Atlantic City, New Jersey. Its casinos attract gamblers mainly from nearby Memphis, but also draw visitors from Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama, Missouri, Georgia, Illinois and Kentucky. In the second decade of the 21st century, due to increased legalization of gambling in other states, including on Native American reservations, Tunica places sixth in gaming revenue, after the Las Vegas Strip, Atlantic City, Chicago, Connecticut, and Detroit.\\"Tunica Resorts\\", American Gaming Association, The 2011 Mississippi River floods damaged casino resort buildings and infrastructure in this community. While the casinos float and escaped most damage, the hotels' towers and surrounding businesses are on land. Some of the hotels had major flooding on the lower floors, including the Harrah's Casino Tunica, which was under nearly six feet of water. Economy A Mississippi Blues Trail marker at the Hollywood Cafe in Tunica Resorts As of 2020, the town is home to six casinos: * 1st Jackpot Casino Tunica * Fitzgeralds Casino & Hotel Tunica * Gold Strike Casino Resort * Hollywood Casino Tunica * Horseshoe Casino Tunica * Sam's Town Hotel and Gambling Hall At one time, eleven different casinos were operated in the community. Resorts Casino Tunica, Tunica Roadhouse, Treasure Bay Casino and Grand Casino Tunica closed, and the Isle of Capri (originally the first of three Harrah's locations in the area) was bought by the neighboring Sam's Town resort; it is used only for its hotel tower and parking garage.https://mobi.hotelnewsresource.com/?p=767 The community is remarkable in that there is little infrastructure other than that which adjoins the casinos. Businesses other than the casinos include a small number of motels, convenience stores and fast food restaurants, along with an outlet-style shopping center, and the community's oldest business, the Hollywood Cafe, a blues club immortalized in the popular song, \\"Walking in Memphis,\\" by Marc Cohn in 1991. Small apartment complexes mainly occupied by casino workers are among the few dwellings found in Tunica Resorts. Outside of such structures ‚Äî many built since 1990 ‚Äî table-flat cotton fields mark much of the area, as was the case before the casinos came. Arts and culture In May 2008, the board of directors of the Mid-South Fair announced that the annual event would move to a new site in Robinsonville, on U.S. 61 across from the Tunica Visitors Center. The first fair on the new site was scheduled for 2009. However, mainly because of weather but also because of the poor economy, the fair was instead held at the DeSoto Civic Center, and will continue to be until the new fairgrounds site is ready. Government Beginning in 2007, some Robinsonville residents have tried to incorporate their community into a separate town government, rather than exist under the jurisdiction of Tunica County or move toward annexation into the town of Tunica. If Robinsonville incorporates, the new town government would be a direct beneficiary of casino tax revenue, enabling construction of municipal government offices. Depending on population and revenue growth, fire and police stations, a library and other public infrastructure could be other likely additions. Education Residents are a part of the Tunica County School District. Zoned schools include Robinsonville Elementary School,\\"header_6337099_.jpg.\\" Robinsonville Elementary School.

He was the founder of Tanzeem-e- Islami, an offshoot of the Jamaat-e-Islami. Early life and education Israr Ahmed was born in Hisar, a province of East Punjab of British Indian Empire, on 26 April 1932. His father was a civil servant in the British Government who relocated his family from Hisar to Montgomery, now Sahiwal, Punjab Province of Pakistan. After graduating from a local high school, Ahmed moved to Lahore to attend the King Edward Medical University in 1950. He received his MBBS degree from King Edward Medical University in 1954 and began practising medicine. In addition, he obtained his Masters in Islamic Studies from the University of Karachi in 1965. Ahmed worked briefly for Muslim Student's Federation in the Independence Movement and, following the creation of Pakistan in 1947, for the Islami Jami\`yat-e-Talaba and then in 1950 joined Jamaat-e-Islami led by Abul Ala Maududi, but left the party when the latter opted for participating in electoral politics in 1957. Ahmed resigned from the Jamaat-e-Islami in April 1957 because of its involvement in national politics, which he believed was irreconcilable with the revolutionary methodology adopted by the Jama'at in the pre-1947 period. His interest in Islam and philosophy grew further and he subsequently moved to Karachi, Sindh Province in the 1960s. where he enrolled in Karachi University. Work =Literature and philosophy= He criticised modern democracy and the prevalent electoral system and argued that the head of an Islamic state could reject the majority decisions of an elected assembly. Ahmed was awarded the Sitara-i-Imtiaz in 1981. He has authored over 60 books in Urdu on topics related to Islam and Pakistan, nine of which have been translated into English and other languages.  Health  Ahmed relinquished the leadership of Tanzeem-e-Islami in October 2002 because of bad health. He had appointed Hafiz Akif Saeed (his son) the Emir of the Tanzeem (from 2002 to 2020) to whom all rufaqaa of Tanzeem renewed their pledge of Baiyah. Influences Like Wahiduddin Khan, Naeem Siddiqui and Javed Ahmad Ghamidi, Ahmed also worked closely with Syed Abul A'la Maududi (alternative spelling Syed Maudoodi; often referred to as Maulana Maududi) (1903‚Äì1979) and Amin Ahsan Islahi. Supporters describe his vision of Islam as having been synthesised from the diverse sources. He has also acknowledged the \\"deep influence\\" of Shah Waliullah Dehlawi, the 18th century Indian Islamic leader, anti-colonial activist, jurist, and scholar. \\"In the context of Qur'anic exegesis and understanding, Ahmed was a firm traditionalist of the genre of Mahmud Hasan Deobandi and Shabbir Ahmad Usmani; yet he presented Qur'anic teachings in a scientific and enlightened way\\". Ahmed believed in what he called \\"Islamic revolutionary thought,\\" which consists of the idea that Islam - the teachings of the Qur'an and the Sunnah - must be implemented in the social, cultural, juristic, political, and economic spheres of life. In this he is said to follow Mohammad Rafiuddin and Muhammad Iqbal. The first attempt towards the actualisation of this concept was reportedly made by Abul Kalam Azad through his short-lived party, the Hizbullah. Another attempt was made by Abul Ala Maududi through his Jamaat-e-Islami party. Although the Jamaat-e- Islami has reached some influence, Ahmed resigned from the party in 1956 when it entered the electoral process and believed that such an involvement led to \\"degeneration from a pure Islamic revolutionary party to a mere political one\\". Tanzeem-e-Islami Originally a member of Jamaat-e-Islami, Ahmed became disappointed with its electoral activity, \\"significant policy matters\\", and what he saw as the \\"lack of effort to create an Islamic renaissance through the revolutionary process.\\" He and some other individuals resigned from JI and in 1956 founded the nucleus of Tanzeem-e-Islami, an attempt to create a \\"disciplined organization.\\" \\"A resolution was passed which subsequently became the Mission Statement of Tanzeem-e-Islami.\\" Along with his work to revive \\"the Qur'an-centered Islamic perennial philosophy and world- view\\" Israr Ahmed aimed with his party to \\"reform the society in a practical way with the ultimate objective of establishing a true Islamic State, or the System of Khilafah\\". A major Pakistani English-language newspaper commented about his views of modern democracy and the electoral system, \\"A critic of modern democracy and the electoral system, Dr Israr believed that the head of an Islamic state can reject majority decisions of an elected assembly.\\" =Hizb ut-Tahrir= According to Tanzeem-e-Islami's FAQ, while both Hizb ut- Tahrir and Tanzeem-e-Islami share belief in reviving the Caliphate as a means of implementing Islam in all spheres of life, Tanzeem-e-Islami does not believe in involvement in electoral politics, armed struggle, coup d'√©tat to establish a caliphate, and has no set plan of detailed workings for the future Caliphate. Tanzeem-e-Islami emphasises that iman (faith) among Muslims must be revived in \\"a significant portion of the Muslim society\\" before there can be an Islamic revival. =Abul Ala Maududi= While Israr Ahmed \\"considers himself a product\\" of the teachings of \\"comprehensive and holistic concept of the Islamic obligations\\" of Abul Ala Maududi, he opposes Jamaat-e-Islami's \\"plunge\\" into \\"the arena of power politics,\\" which he considered to have been \\"disastrous.\\" =Danger of foreign powers= In response to the state of emergency in 2007, Ahmed called for lifting the emergency, reinstatement of Supreme Court justices, and withdrawal of all actions taken in pursuance of the proclamation of emergency and the PCO law besides resignation of President Pervez Musharraf. In a televised press conference, Israr Ahmed called for resignation of Pervez Musharraf from both president and chief of army staff. Ahmed appealed to President General Musharraf to lift the state emergency and step down for the nation's greater interests. At the television news channels, Ahmed also predicted and warned the nation that, \\"If the situation worsens, the NATO forces are waiting on the western front to move into Pakistan and may deprive the country of its nuclear assets while on the eastern front, India is ready to stage an action replay of Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 and has alerted its armed forces to intervene in to check threats to peace in the region.\\" Other views In 2006, Canada's National Post newspapers quoted Ahmed as saying that \\"Islam's renaissance will begin in Pakistan... because the Arab world is living under subjugation. Only the Pakistan region has the potential for standing up against the nefarious designs of the global power-brokers and to resist the rising tides of the Jewish/Zionist hegemony. \\"FBI's Latest Outreach Outrage\\" by Steven Emerson, IPT News, Published 7 November 2007, Retrieved 14 December 2018 Asia Times reports that in September 1995 Ahmed told the annual convention of the Islamic Society of North America: \\"The process of the revival of Islam in different parts of the world is real. A final showdown between the Muslim world and the non-Muslim world, which has been captured by the Jews, would soon take place. The Gulf War was just a rehearsal for the coming conflict.\\" He appealed to the Muslims of the world, including those in the US, to prepare themselves for the coming conflict. Death and legacy Israr Ahmed died of cardiac arrest at his home in Lahore on the morning of 14 April 2010 at age 78. He had given up the leadership of Tanzeem-i-Islami in 2002 due to poor health. According to his son, his health deteriorated at around 1:30 am with pain in the back. He was a long time heart patient. His survivors included a wife, four sons and five daughters.

This chapter is divided into 36 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 75 (AD 175-225) *Papyrus 66 (c. 200) *Codex Vaticanus (325-350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330-360) *Codex Bezae (c. 400; extant verses 27-36) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (c. 450; extant verses 34-36) *Papyrus 63 (c. 500; extant verses 14-18)  Nicodemus  Jesus talking to Nicodemus, depicted by William Hole The first part of the chapter begins with Nicodemus, said to be a member of the ruling council, coming at night to talk with Jesus, whom he calls Rabbi. On account of Jesus' \\"miraculous signs\\", Nicodemus and others (\\"we\\" in ) have recognized that Jesus is \\" a teacher come from God\\". It is not clear for whom Nicodemus speaks ‚Äì the translation in The Voice adds wording, \\"Teacher, some of us have been talking ...\\" ‚Äì but many commentators infer from the nighttime setting for this meeting that Nicodemus came alone, privately, \\"through shame, and fear of his brethren of the council\\",Joseph Benson, Benson Commentary on John 3, accessed 11 February 2016 shame possibly arising because, \\"being a master in Israel, [he would not want] to be looked upon as a scholar going to learn of another\\".Matthew Poole's Commentary on John 3, accessed 11 February 2016 Methodist writer Joseph Benson notes, with support, theologian Daniel Whitby's interpretation, that \\"the Pharisees and rulers knew Christ to be a teacher come from God\\". In reply Jesus declared, \\"I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born from above, or born again.\\" The word in may be translated as either \\"again\\" or \\"from above\\". The King James Version, the English Standard Version and the New International Version all say \\"born again\\", whereas the New Revised Standard Version and Young's Literal Translation both have \\"born from above\\" in their text with an alternative note \\"born anew\\".All variants taken from BibleGateway.com Nicodemus's reply, \\"How can someone be born when they are old? Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother's womb to be born!\\" reflects an understanding that Jesus is speaking of a second birth. Nicodemus understands the double entendre literally, whereas Jesus has in mind the figurative sense of ·ºÑŒΩœâŒ∏ŒµŒΩ (born ‚Äúfrom above‚Äù).James L. Resseguie, \\"A Glossary of New Testament Narrative Criticism with Illustrations,\\" in Religions, 10 (3: 217), 11. Jesus then talks of what it means to be born again and the path to heaven. \\"I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.\\" (5-6) =Verse 7= This verse gives emphasis to 'the imperative character of the new birth', with 'nothing optional about it'. =Verse 14= =Verse 16= This chapter is intended to show the importance of the belief in Jesus as the son of God. Jesus is shown here already proclaiming himself the Messiah and laying out aspects of Christian theology, in contrast to Mark for instance, where Jesus seems to try to keep the fact of his divinity secret until his final trip to Jerusalem. Nicodemus appears here, in chapter and is listed in John , and only in John, as helping Joseph of Arimathea to bury Jesus.  Jesus baptizes  In the second part of the chapter, Jesus goes with his disciples into the land of Judea, the region round about Jerusalem,Barnes, A., Barnes' Notes on John 3, accessed 3 May 2019 presumably towards the River Jordan,Meyer, H., Meyer's NT Commentary on John 3, accessed 3 May 2017 and remains there and baptizes. John the Baptist is also baptizing people nearby, at Aenon, near Salim. John's disciples tell John that Jesus is also baptizing people, more than John it seems (John 3:26: \\"everybody is going to Him\\"). John replies that \\"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ, but am sent ahead of him.' The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. He must become greater; I must become less.\\" He finishes by saying \\"Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\\" This passage is meant to show John's acceptance of Jesus's superiority as well as a further emphasis on belief in him as the path to eternal life/heaven. There is a group still surviving today, the Mandaeans, who claim John as the greatest prophet. Use of verses from John 3 Biblical references for verses John 3:7 and John 3:16 are both used in signage and popular culture to communicate the message of the Christian gospel.

Sally Field stars as Gidget with Don Porter as father Russell Lawrence. The series was first broadcast on ABC from September 15, 1965 to April 21, 1966. Reruns were aired until September 1, 1966. Gidget was among the first regularly scheduled color programs on ABC. With a Wednesday night time slot that put it in direct competition with The Beverly Hillbillies, it did poorly in the Nielsen ratings and was canceled at the end of its first season. Background The television series was based upon concepts and characters created by Frederick Kohner in his 1957 novel Gidget, the Little Girl with Big Ideas,Gidget by Frederick Kohner (2001) Berkley Publishing Group. which Kohner based upon the adventures of his teenage daughter Kathy. The novel was adapted into a 1959 movie starring Sandra Dee, James Darren and Cliff Robertson. The 1965 weekly, half-hour television series is seen by some as a sequel to the 1959 film, despite numerous discontinuities in plot, time frame and other details. It can also be seen as an independent incarnation, related to but distinct from either the novels or the films. Kohner served as a script consultant on the show. The series reintroduced Gidget's friend Larue and married sister Anne Cooper, both of whom appear in Kohner's original novel, but are absent from the motion picture series. Gidget's brother-in-law, who appears in the novels as the intelligent but condescending child psychiatrist Larry Cooper, is reinvented in the television series as John Cooper, an obtuse but lovable psychology student. Plot Gidget centers on the father-daughter relationship between Frances \\"Gidget\\" Lawrence and her widowed father Russell Lawrence. Episodes follow Gidget's adventures in school, at home, and at nearby beaches. Russell Lawrence guides his fifteen year-old daughter, while married sister Anne and husband John offer often unsolicited child-rearing tips. Gidget's friend Larue sometimes takes part in her escapades. More often than not, Gidget receives moral instruction from her father and gains wisdom from her experiences. Each episode is narrated by Gidget; on occasion, she breaks the \\"fourth wall\\" and directly addresses her audience, usually reflecting on what she has learned from the evening's story, sometimes ending with \\"Toodles!\\" (an expression Field improvised during production). Characters Don Porter with Sally Field and Betty Conner, 1965. * Frances Elizabeth \\"Gidget\\" Lawrence (Sally Field) - The prototypical southern California beach bunny. * Russell Lawrence (Don Porter) - Gidget's widowed father and English professor at UCLA. * Anne Cooper (Betty Conner) - Gidget's older, married sister. * John Cooper (Pete Duel) - Anne's husband, a psychology student. * Larue Wilson (Lynette Winter) - Gidget's best friend. * Jeff \\"Moondoggie\\" Matthews (Stephen Mines) - Gidget's boyfriend who is away at Princeton University. * Siddo (Michael Nader) - Gidget's schoolmate. * Randy (Rickie Sorensen) - Gidget's schoolmate.

Ranch in Burbank, California, with the exterior and kitchen set borrowed from the Hazel series, which was filming its final season at the time. The house situated next door to the Lawrence residence is the principal residence on the Bewitched series, which was in production simultaneously. The show launched the career of 18-year-old Sally Field, who defeated 75 other teenage girls for the title role. Field exaggerated her surfing experience to the show's casting directors during her audition (she had none); she later took lessons from Phil Sauers just to be able to pretend to surf for the cameras. Sauers served as the series' \\"Surfing Technical Consultant\\" and provided the surfboards used during filming of the series. Don Porter had portrayed Gidget's father, Russell Lawrence, two years prior in the film Gidget Goes to Rome and was asked to reprise the role for the series. While the Gidget of the novel and the original film are both blondes, the Gidget of the television series is a brunette. The lyrics of the theme song \\"\\"(Wait 'Til You See) My Gidget\\" were written by Howard Greenfield, with music by Jack Keller. The song was performed in the pilot by The Four Freshmen, and in the series by Johnny Tillotson. In the credits for the pilot episode, John Cooper is listed as \\"Larry\\". Episodes Reception Gidget faced stiff competition during its initial run. The show originally aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m., opposite The Beverly Hillbillies (CBS) and The Virginian (NBC), two established shows with strong ratings. The series was moved to Thursdays at 8:00 p.m. starting with Episode 18 (\\"Like Voodoo\\") where it performed poorly opposite CBS's Gilligan's Island, despite airing after the Top 5-rated Batman. ABC canceled Gidget in April 1966 ‚Äî just as the show began to find a large teen audience. Summer reruns launched the show into the Top 10 as viewers looked for programs they had not seen during their original fall/winter broadcasts. ABC had a belated hit on their hands, but refused to renew the show because they would have to admit they were premature in its cancellation. In addition, industry practice at the time rarely allowed for cancelled shows to be resurrected. Rather than squander their newly found audience which ABC was hurting for at the time, the network scrambled to find a new starring vehicle for Field. The result was The Flying Nun (1967‚Äì70), where Field reluctantly portrayed Sister Bertrille for three seasons. Field later commented that she has great affection for her young persona and was proud of her work on Gidget but was embarrassed with The Flying Nun. Legacy May 28-June 3, 1966 issue of TV Guide featuring Sally Field; the series had been cancelled by this time, but ratings had significantly improved. Gidget remained in regular syndication for several years, one of the few single- season programs to attain this status. Two made-for-television films followed after its demise: Gidget Grows Up (1969) and Gidget Gets Married (1972). The series gained a new wave of popularity starting in 1983 when reruns began airing on a regular basis (along with The Flying Nun). Another television movie, Gidget's Summer Reunion, was produced in 1985 starring Caryn Richman in the title role. The movie was successful enough to warrant a syndicated sequel series, The New Gidget, with Richman reprising her role. None of the original cast members appeared on the new series, though original series producer Harry Ackerman was present. Episodes of Gidget are available for purchase on iTunes, and streaming for free through The Minisode Network in the U.S. on Hulu and Crackle. Antenna TV began airing the show in summer 2011 on weekends, paired with The Flying Nun. The entire series was broadcast during an Independence Day marathon in 2012 and 2013, and a Memorial Day marathon in 2016 and 2017. As of August 2018, the series was available on Amazon Prime video. Merchandise Milton Bradley Company manufactured a \\"Gidget Fortune Teller\\" game which used Field's image on the box, the playing board and several game cards.Board Games of the 50s, 60s, and 70s: With Prices by David Dilley (October 1994) L-W Promotions Home media On March 21, 2006, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released Gidget: The Complete Series featuring all 32 episodes of the series, on DVD in Region 1.

It is the only one found in the central London area known as Fitzrovia. History The square, nearby Fitzroy Street, and the Fitzroy Tavern in Charlotte Street have the family name of Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton, into whose ownership the land passed through his marriage.Tottenham Court Road in Old and New London: Volume 4 (1878), pp. 467‚Äì480, from British History Online His descendant Charles FitzRoy, 1st Baron Southampton developed the area during the late 18th and early 19th century. Fitzroy Square was a speculative development intended to provide London residences for aristocratic families, and was built in four stages. Leases for the eastern and southern sides, designed by Robert Adam, were granted in 1792; building began in 179410 Fitzroy Square and was completed in 1798 by Adam's brothers James and William. These buildings are fronted in Portland stone brought by sea from Dorset. The Napoleonic Wars and a slump in the London property market brought a temporary stop to construction of the square after the south and east sides were completed. According to the records of the Squares Frontagers' Committee, 1815 residents looked out on \\"vacant ground, the resort of the idle and profligate\\". Another contemporary account describes the incomplete square: > The houses are faced with stone, and have a greater proportion of > architectural excellence and embellishment than most others in the > metropolis. They were designed by the Adams, but the progress of the late > war prevented the completion of the design. It is much to be regretted, that > it remains in its present unfinished state.Leigh's New Picture of London. > Printed for Samuel Leigh, 18, Strand; by W. Clowes, Northumberland Court. > 1819 The northern and western sides were subsequently constructed in 1827‚Äì29 and 1832‚Äì35 respectively, and are stucco-fronted. The south side suffered bomb damage during World War II and was rebuilt with traditional facades to remain in keeping with the rest of the square. Present day The square in 2015 The square was largely pedestrianised in the 1970s, as part of a scheme designed by Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe and undertaken as part of environmental improvement works. In 2008 the square was upgraded by relaying most of the surface at a single level, removing street clutter such as bollards, and further restricting vehicular access.\\"Historic Fitzroy Square goes back to the future - photos\\", Camden.gov.uk.

The title stems from an old Army song which includes lyrics \\"You'll never get rich / by digging a ditch / you're in the Army now!\\" This was Hayworth's first starring role in a big budgeted film from her home studio Columbia Pictures. While the film was in production, Life magazine put her on its cover, and featured inside a photo of Hayworth kneeling on a bed in a nightgown, which soon became one of the most widely distributed pin-ups of all time. Hayworth cooperated enthusiastically with Astaire's intense rehearsal habits, and was later to remark: \\"I guess the only jewels in my life are the pictures I made with Fred Astaire\\". The picture was very successful at the box office, turning Hayworth into a major star, and provided a welcome boost to Astaire, who felt his career had flagged since he had broken with Ginger Rogers. One of the film's songs, Since I Kissed My Baby Goodbye, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song. Plot Theater owner and womanizer Martin Cortland (Robert Benchley) enlists the aid of his manager Robert Curtis (Fred Astaire) to woo dancer Sheila Winthrop (Rita Hayworth) but is caught by his long-suffering wife Julia (Frieda Inescort), who hints that he's gone too far this time and his increasingly unbelievable excuses might soon be judged by \\"twelve strange men.\\" Robert and Sheila are attracted to one another but Robert is caught in Martin's continual attempts to deceive his wife (and keep his marriage, and thus his fortune, intact) and Sheila doubts Robert's sincerity. Captain Tom Barton (John Hubbard), an old friend and potential suitor, invites Sheila and her Aunt Louise (Marjorie Gateson) to visit him and his mother (Ann Shoemaker) on his Army base. Coincidentally, Curtis is drafted into the Army and posted to the same base under the command of The Top Sergeant (Donald McBride), where he quickly befriends fellow draftees Swiv (Cliff Nazarro) and Blain (Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams). Curtis finds himself imprisoned in the guardhouse, where he encounters the visiting Sheila and quickly spins his own web of lies (including a fictitious promotion to Captain) in an attempt to impress her and win her heart. He \\"borrows\\" a Captain's uniform and visits her, where he is introduced as Captain Curtis to several other officers, including Barton and the officer whose coat he was wearing. Sheila takes pity on him and allows him a graceful exit. On his return to the guardhouse, he finds his friends also confined for aiding him. Martin appears on the base to produce a show for the enlisted men and (at his request) is assigned Curtis as his assistant, who offers Martin the use of his apartment in town and insists that Sheila be included as his partner in the show. However, Martin is now in pursuit of another dancer, Sonya (Osa Massen), and has promised the lead to her. Captain Barton learns that he is being transferred to Panama and asks Sheila to marry him and accompany him there. Alarmed, Curtis races to his apartment to retrieve an engraved diamond bracelet that Martin had purchased for Sheila; unknown to him, Martin had had the bracelet re-engraved for Sonya. Martin sends Sheila to town to bring Robert back before he's declared AWOL. In his apartment Robert is startled to find Sonya, who was staying there at the invitation of Martin. Sheila arrives with the MPs on her heels and helps Robert escape, but encounters Sonya and sees her name engraved on the bracelet. She decides to marry Captain Barton and withdraws from the show. Martin's ever-suspicious wife, invited by Curtis, arrives and Sonya is forced to leave the show as well, which is canceled for want of a leading lady. Curtis' friends hold a demonstration to convince Sheila to return to the show. Curtis arranges for a genuine Justice of the Peace to participate in a wedding scene, resulting in (unknown to her) their actual marriage on stage. Martin confesses his machinations to Sheila, who embraces him in relief and calls on her new husband in the guardhouse. The jilted Captain Barton generously arranges for Curtis' release for his honeymoon; the film ends with Swiv and Blain's inept attempt to break into the guardhouse to free Curtis. Cast Publicity still with Astaire for film. * Fred Astaire as Robert Curtis * Rita Hayworth as Sheila Winthrop * Robert Benchley as Martin Cortland * John Hubbard as Captain Tom Barton * Osa Massen as Sonya * Frieda Inescort as Mrs. Julia Cortland * Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams as Kewpie Blain (as Guinn Williams) * Donald MacBride as Top Sergeant * Cliff Nazarro as Swivel Tongue 'Swiv' * Marjorie Gateson as Aunt Louise * Ann Shoemaker as Mrs. Barton * Boyd Davis as Colonel Shiller * Patti McCarty as Young Girl (uncredited) Key songs/dance routines Dance director was Robert Alton, Astaire's second-most-frequent choreographic collaborator after Hermes Pan. As Astaire generally choreographed his own and his partner's routines, Alton concentrated on the choruses. The choreography explores a diverse range of musical rhythms some of which are artfully juxtaposed in Cole Porter's score. * \\"Rehearsal Duet\\": Short but virtuosic tap number with Astaire and Hayworth dancing side by side. * \\"Boogie Barcarolle\\": Porter number which, not unlike Robert Russell Bennett's Waltz In Swing Time from Swing Time, overlays two very different musical rhythms. Astaire leads the chorus which includes Hayworth in an exhilarating and, for Astaire, unusual routine. * \\"Shootin' the Works for Uncle Sam\\": Song and dance number where Astaire and chorus march through Grand Central Terminal. The choreography expresses the notion that Broadway-style dance rehearsals and army camp drills have much in common. The music and dance contrast march and jazz rhythms. * \\"Since I Kissed My Baby Goodbye\\": Haunting and melancholy Porter standard introduced by the Four Tones - an African-American quartet (lead singer Lucius \\"Dusty\\" Brooks, Leon Buck, Rudolph Hunter, and John Porter) - followed by a short Astaire solo, and all executed in the unrealistic - for its time - setting of an unsegregated guard house. Astaire also made a successful recording of this number with Decca in September 1941, backed in this instance by the Delta Rhythm Boys. * \\"March Milastaire (A-Stairable Rag)\\": Another Porter number contrasting march and jazz rhythms, danced in a \\"tour de force\\" tap solo by Astaire, who expresses his sudden joy of being in love by using his taps to make as much noise as possible. This time, the purely instrumental African-American backing group comprised the twenty-year-old Chico Hamilton on drums, Buddy Collette (clarinet), Red Mack (trumpet), Alfred Grant (guitar) and Joe Comfort (jug). * \\"So Near and Yet So Far\\": Porter's rumba melody is set to lyrics (sung by Astaire), which sum up the nature of Hayworth's irresistible allure. Astaire, clearly inspired by Hayworth's exceptional Latin dance pedigree, delivers his first on-screen synthesis of Latin-American and ballroom dance steps in a celebrated romantic partnering. * \\"The Wedding Cake Walk\\": Liltin' Martha Tilton's rendition of this cheerful song is followed by a routine involving Astaire, Hayworth and a large chorus, the former pair ending up dancing on a wedding cake in the shape of a tank.

His 1990 international best-selling novel The Last Station is about the final months of Leo Tolstoy. It was translated into over thirty languages, and adapted into an Academy Award-nominated film (The Last Station) starring Helen Mirren, Christopher Plummer, James McAvoy, and Paul Giamatti. The film was released in December 2009. Parini's historical novel Benjamin's Crossing was a New York Times Notable Book of the year in 1997. It is about the Jewish critic and philosopher Walter Benjamin, and his escape over the Pyrenees from Nazi occupied France into Spain. Michael Lackey notes, \\"Parini brilliantly dramatizes one of Benjamin‚Äôs most important contributions to intellectual history, and it is this contribution that would pave the way for the biographical novel.\\" The The Passages of H.M. (2011) explores the literary great Herman Melville. His most recent novel is The Damascus Road: A Novel of Saint Paul (2019). = Biographies = Parini's biography Robert Frost: A Life won the Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize for best non-fiction book of the year in 2000.

With Devon Jersild, Parini adapted his historical novel Benjamin's Crossing into a screenplay, which is currently in pre- production.  Iraq War protest  Parini, along with Julia Alvarez and Galway Kinnell, was invited to read his poetry at the White House in 2003. However, First Lady Laura Bush canceled the event after learning the poets were intending to protest against the Iraq War. Noelia Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Bush said: ‚ÄúWhile Mrs. Bush respects the right of all Americans to express their opinions, she, too, has opinions and believes it would be inappropriate to turn a literary event into a political forum.‚Äù Parini was disgusted by this decision: \\"For poets to remain silent at a time of national crisis is unconscionable,\\" he said. Fellow poet Julia Alvarez added: \\"Why be afraid of us, Mrs. Bush? You're married to a scarier fellow.\\" Parini said it was naive for organizers to think he and other poets would check their politics at the door of an event sponsored by the first lady. In response to Mrs. Bush's decision, Parini joined a group of poets that took part in a reading on February 16, 2003 at the Congregational Church in Manchester, Vermont, called \\"A Poetry Reading in Honor of the Right to Protest as a Patriotic and Historical Tradition\\". The event was attended by over 700 people, and received national attention, bringing in over 50 reporters and warranting coverage by C-SPAN and 60 Minutes. In 2010, Parini and Christopher Hitchens debated religion, the invasion of Iraq, and the war on terror at the Pages & Places Book Festival in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which drew more than 2,000 people.  Personal life  Parini is married to the writer and psychologist Devon Jersild; they have three sons.  Awards  Parini has won various fellowships and awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1993.

While attending college at De La Salle University-Manila, he was approached to audition for a band that would later become one of the most successful rock bands in the Philippines, The Dawn. After the disbandment of The Dawn in 1995, the band would later on hold a sold-out reunion concert at the ULTRA basketball stadium in 1997, an event that didn't prove to be the spark that would ignite a re-grouping. However, in 1999, the band members were unanimous in taking The Dawn back on the road. Solo work and Jett Pangan Group (1995‚Äì2001) When The Dawn disbanded in 1995, Pangan moved on to work as a recording company executive and was later persuaded to release the solo album, Spell. Not long after, the Jett Pangan Group was formed and successfully released two albums. They disbanded in 2001 with Pangan continuing to perform with The Dawn. Theater Arts In between touring and recording, Pangan finds time to act in musical theater. In 2001, his first musical theater involvement was in a rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar together with fellow musicians Rico Blanco and Noel Cabangon. He was also involved in local productions of \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" and \\"Nine\\". He would later play the lead role in an international musical production of Stephen Soundheim's Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street in 2019 alongside multi-awarded actress Lea Salonga. =Anime roles= *BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad as Saitou Ken‚Äôichi *Voltes V as Draco =Hosting= He was host for the program Myx Live (replacing Bernard Palanca and Rico Blanco).

He is the author of many books and contributes science essays to publications such as The New York Times, Discover, and National Geographic. He is a fellow at Yale University's Morse College and adjunct professor of Molecular biophysics and biochemistry at Yale University. Besides his popular science writing, Zimmer also gives frequent lectures, and has appeared on many radio shows, including National Public Radio's Radiolab, Fresh Air and This American Life. Zimmer describes his journalistic beat as \\"life\\" or \\"what it means to be alive.\\" He is also the only science writer to have a species of tapeworm named after him (Acanthobothrium zimmeri). Zimmer lives with his wife Grace Farrell Zimmer and their two children, Charlotte and Veronica, in Guilford, Connecticut. Carl Zimmer's father is Dick Zimmer, a Republican politician from New Jersey, who was a member of U.S. House of Representatives from 1991 to 1997. Career Zimmer received his B.A. in English from Yale University in 1987. In 1989, he started his career at Discover magazine, first as a copy editor and fact checker, eventually serving as a senior editor from 1994 to 1998. Zimmer left Discover after ten years to focus on books and other projects. In 2004, he started a blog called \\"The Loom\\", in which he wrote about topics related to his books, but later expanded it into what he terms \\"a place where I could write about things I might not be turning into an article for a magazine, but were really interesting‚Äù. The Loom has been hosted by Discover and National Geographic for many years, and was invited to be part of Scienceblogs in the past. It has been transferred to Zimmer's personal website in 2018. As of 2013, Zimmer writes a weekly column called Matter in The New York Times. Zimmer and the STAT project team have put out ‚ÄúGame of Genomes,‚Äù a 13-part series that enlisted two dozen scientists, with the goal of exploring Zimmer's own genome. He has given lectures at some of USA's leading universities, medical schools, and museums. In 2009, Zimmer was the keynote speaker at Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism (NECSS). He has also presented at NECSS 2011 and CSICon 2018. Twice, Zimmer has been a spotlight speaker at Aspen Ideas Festival, in 2017 at Aspen Ideas, and in 2018 for Aspen Ideas: Health. In 2009 and 2010 he was host of the periodic audio podcast Meet the Scientist of the American Society for Microbiology (replacing Merry Buckley). Zimmer's 2004 article Whose Life Would You Save? has been featured in the 2005 The Best American Science and Nature Writing series. Zimmer is widely recognized as one of the finest science essayists and communicators, and has thus received numerous awards including the 2007 National Academies Communication Award, a prize for science communication from the United States National Academy of Sciences, for his wide-ranging coverage of biology and evolution in newspapers, magazines and his blog. For these same reasons, in 2016 Yale University appointed Zimmer Adjunct Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, stating that he is \\"a world-renowned science journalist and teacher, and his ability to make science, particularly biology, accessible to the general public is without peer\\". Zimmer teaches a science communication course at Yale since 2017 and participates in other Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry courses. Opinions on science and skepticism Zimmer publicly expresses his concerns about recent science denial, and notes that attacks on science \\"are in a number of cases well-funded campaigns, and some politicians are backing some of them for their own political ends.\\", where \\"climate change, evolution, and vaccines seem to top the list.\\" He further says that each case of science denial is concerning, and says that some, e.g. spreading misinformation about vaccines to worried parents, leads to needless outbreaks of disease that even puts children at risk of death. Similarly, Zimmer considers global warming as one of the biggest societal issues of our time, as our children and their children will inherit not only our genes, but this planet too, and states that \\"We should think about tinkering with the future of genetic heredity, but I think we should also be doing that with our environmental heredity and our cultural heredity.\\" According to Zimmer there is a broader threat of these particular attacks on science, potentially eroding people's understanding of how science works in general: \\"If people come to see science as just someone else's opinion, rather than a powerful way of knowing based on evidence, then all sorts of trouble may arise.\\" In his keynote talk at The Rockefeller University on 6 September 2017, he noted that democracy, science and journalism are \\"three valuable institutions that have made life...far better than it would have been without them.\\" He stated however that we should not take it for granted that they are free from corruption, and urged to keep them that way. Specifically, he stated that \\"We can look back through history and see how in different places and in different times, each of these pillars cracked and sometimes fell. We should not be smug, when we look back at these episodes. We should not be so arrogant, as to believe that we are so much smarter or nobler that we're somehow immune from this disasters.\\" Zimmer is critical of politicians negative influence on science. Specifically, he is critical of Trump's anti- science stance, specifically his denial of human-caused climate change. Similarly, he is critical of Trump's appointment of science-deniers to lead crucial US environmental agencies, such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy. Zimmer is also critical of Putin's influence on Russian science, specifically Putin's \\"friendly take-over\\" of a Russian science magazine, Putin being the \\"hands-off chairman\\" of the Russian Geographic Society. After publishing She Has Her Mother's Laugh: The Powers, Perversions, and Potential of Heredity, in several interviews Zimmer was asked for his opinion about genome editing and CRISPR. While Zimmer thought that some gene-editing procedures, especially for conditions caused by single gene mutations, might provide simple ways to battle serious diseases, he urged for caution about intervention at the embryonic stage. However, he further pointed out the complexity of the issue and the need to address other countries' practices. Fellowships * 2017: Alfred P.

The word, which means \\"exterminated by the plant\\", was coined in 1928 by Dr. Boris P. Tokin, a Russian biochemist from Leningrad University. He found that some plants give off very active substances that help to prevent them from rotting or being eaten by some insects and animals. Occurrence and use Cedar, garlic, locust, oak, onion, pine, tea tree, many spices, and many other plants give off phytoncides. Garlic contains allicin and diallyl disulfide. Pine contains alpha-pinene, carene, myrcene, and other terpenes. Sophora flavescens contains sophoraflavanone G. More than 5,000 volatile substances defend plants that produce them from bacteria, fungi, and insects. Phytoncides work by inhibiting or preventing the growth of the attacking organism.

He was born in Claines, near Worcester, the son of James Dyson Perrins, the owner of the Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce factory and the grandson of William Perrins, co- originator of the Lea & Perrins secret recipe. Biography He was educated at Charterhouse School and The Queen's College, Oxford, and then served in the Highland Light Infantry. After the death of his father, he took over management of Lea & Perrins. His father had also been a director of Royal Worcester Porcelain Factory, and Charles followed him, becoming a director in 1891. He became chairman in 1901, and supported the factory financially. He bought the company outright in 1934 and ensured its continuity from his own fortune, until it could be taken public in 1954. In 1927, he purchased the Royal Worcester Porcelain Factory's historic ceramics collection for a price above market value, to assist the firm's cashflow. In 1946, he established the Perrins Trust to unite the factory museum collection and his own private holdings of Royal Worcester and ensure their survival. After his death, his widow established the \\"Dyson Perrins Museum\\" at the factory site to house the collection. It is now called \\"The Museum of Royal Worcester\\" (previously \\"Worcester Porcelain Museum\\"). Perrins lived in Malvern for most of his life and amongst his many charitable deeds in Worcestershire was the endowment of Dyson Perrins Church of England Academy in Malvern. He served as Mayor of Worcester for 1897‚Äì98 and as High Sheriff of Worcestershire for 1899‚Äì1900. He was a major benefactor of the Royal Grammar School, Worcester, and endowed new buildings including Perrins Hall (1914) named after his father, an old boy. The school organ is in this building and is played regularly at assemblies. He became a Six Master and chairman of the governors of that school until the 1950s. His portrait by A. Hacker c. 1907 hangs in the hall. In Oxford, he funded the building of the Dyson Perrins Laboratory, which was the main centre for research into organic chemistry at Oxford University from its foundation in 1916 until its retirement as a laboratory in 2003. He received an honorary DCL from Oxford University. During Perrins's life he amassed one of the most important book collections in the world, particularly strong in medieval illuminated manuscripts and printed ballads. To help finance and re-establish the Royal Worcester factory after World War II, he decided to sell his important collection of early printed books, and they were mostly dispersed in a series of sales at Sotheby's in London in 1946 and 1947. His illuminated manuscripts and other remaining printed books were sold after his death in three major auction sales in 1958 to 1960. A record total for a single collection of ¬£1,100,000 was raised by these sales. Items once owned by C. W. Dyson Perrins now form the basis of many other prominent collections, such as the Lessing J. Rosenwald Collection now in the Library of Congress. Many other items from his collection were given or bequeathed by him to public institutions such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Gallery, the Ashmolean Museum, Winchester Cathedral library, and the British Museum. For example, his Mughal manuscript the Emperor Akbar's Khamsa of Nizami is now in the British Library and Palestrina by J. M. W. Turner is in the National Gallery. Family Perrins married: # Catherine Christina Gregory at St Giles' Cathedral cathedral, Edinburgh in October 1889. They had five children. Catherine died at Davenham, the family home, on 31 January 1922, and was buried at the Municipal cemetery, Great Malvern. # Florence Winifred Midwood Milne (known as Frieda) at St John, Chelsea on 6 September 1923. She died on 28 December 1968. Charles William Dyson Perrins died at Davenham on 29 January 1958, and was buried at Great Malvern.

Career Bruch was born in √ñrgryte, Gothenburg, grew up in Sk√•ne, and was later a long-time resident of Malm√∂. His main discipline was the shot put, and later the discus, as he joined the ranks of the world's greatest in the early 1970s. The highlight of his career came in 1972, when he equalled the world record of 68.40 metres at the Dagens Nyheter games in Stockholm and, later that season, won a bronze medal at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.Richard Bruch 1946‚Äì2011. storagrabbar.se Throughout his career, Bruch was known as being both outspoken and controversial. He readily changed his opinions on various matters, and represented around a dozen athletics teams, including his own IK Diskus. Bruch was a solid athlete, but failed to achieve the greatest success possible in major international events. Arguably, Bruch's greatest successes were Olympic bronze in 1972 along with silver and bronze at the European Championships in Athletics. Bruch equaled the world record in 1972 with a throw of 68.40 metres. His personal best (71.26 metres in November 1984) remains the Swedish record and puts him ninth in the all-time performers list. As well as achieving his sporting career and his turbulent personal life, Bruch also acted in light- entertainment films, debuting in the Italian action comedy film Anche gli angeli tirano di destro and appearing in a minor role in the film version of Ronia the Robber's Daughter. After Bruch retired, he admitted to having used doping throughout his career. Despite this, he never tested positive during his career.http://www.is.fi/muutlajit/art-2000001129032.html His autobiography Gladiatorns kamp (The Gladiator's Battle) was printed in 1990, and an anthology of his poetry, Sj√§l och kropp: Dikter (Body and Soul: Poems), has also been published. After a few years away from the glare of publicity in the early 1980s, he returned to the spotlight at the age of 38 in the autumn of 1984 ‚Äì returning to form, he managed a number of throws over the 70 metre mark. He achieved his personal record of 71.26 metres in November 1984 at a competition in Malm√∂. This mark stood as the Swedish record for 33 years until Daniel St√•hl surpassed it in 2019. At the Swedish Championships in V√§ster√•s in 1985, Bruch was involved in a dispute with Anders Borgstr√∂m, the team captain at the time. Bruch's willingness to speak his mind resulted, effectively, in his disqualification. However, he continued to appear in the media from time to time, most recently in a TV4 documentary from July 2005. Bruch died on 30 May 2011 from pancreatic cancer.

It describes itself as a place of \\"enlightenment and understanding of the shared history of Germans and Europeans\\". It is often viewed as one of the most important museums in Berlin and is one of the most frequented. The museum is located in the Zeughaus (armoury) on the Unter den Linden as well as in the adjacent Exhibition Hall designed by I. M. Pei. The German Historical Museum is under the legal form of a foundation registered by the Federal Republic of Germany. Its highest- ranking body is the Board of Trustees (Kuratorium) with representatives of the federal government, the German Bundestag (Parliament) and the governments of the German L√§nder, or states.  Founding and history  The museum was founded on 28 October 1987, on the occasion of the 750th anniversary of the founding of Berlin; it was inaugurated in the Reichstag building in former West Berlin. After the success of an exhibition on Prussia, which was shown in the Martin-Gropius-Bau in 1981, the then Governing Mayor of (West) Berlin, Richard von Weizs√§cker, commissioned four prominent historians ‚Äì Hartmut Boockmann, Eberhard J√§ckel, Hagen Schulze and Michael St√ºrmer ‚Äì to prepare a memorandum, which appeared in January 1982 under the title Deutsches Historisches Museum in Berlin. The project enjoyed great support from Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who termed the founding of a German historical museum in Berlin a national priority of European importance in his speech on the State of the Nation before the German Bundestag on 27 February 1985.Deutsches Historisches Museum. Ideen ‚Äì Kontroversen ‚Äì Perspektiven. Hrsg. Christoph St√∂lzl. Frankfurt/Berlin 1988, p.641. A commission consisting of 16 leading historians, art historians and museum directors worked out a concept for the museum in 1985/86 and put it up for discussion in public hearings in 1986. The final version became the basis for the founding of the DHM. The core of the Museum's brief was to present German history in an international context. Multi-perspective perceptions aimed to encourage an understanding of the viewpoint of others in order to allow for a high level of reflection on history and culture in a time of the internationalisation of everyday life and the globalisation of work and commerce. On 28 July 1987, the partnership agreement was signed between the Federal Republic of Germany and the land of (West) Berlin concerning the establishment of the temporary trusteeship of the German Historical Museum as a private limited company. Originally the Museum was to be located near the Reichstag Building at the Spreebogen, the government complex at the bend of the River Spree. The architecture competition for the project was won by the Italian architect Aldo Rossi in 1988. However, in 1989 the fall of the Berlin Wall led to a change of plans: on the day of reunification 3 October 1990, the Federal Government transferred the collection and premises of the former Museum f√ºr Deutsche Geschichte (Museum for German History) to the DHM; the last government of the GDR had already dissolved that museum in September 1990 and made its property and contents available to the DHM. And thus the Zeughaus of 1695 ‚Äì the oldest building on Unter den Linden ‚Äì became the seat of the German Historical Museum. The first exhibitions were shown in the Zeughaus in September 1991. The DHM began expanding its collections shortly after its founding. Opening in December 1994, the former Permanent Exhibition, then entitled German History in Images and Testimonials, presented an initial cross-section of the collection with more than 2000 exhibits. The fa√ßade of the Zeughaus was restored between 1994 and 1998 on the basis of historical documents. The building was closed from 1998 until 2003 while extensive restoration measures were carried out by the architectural office of Winfried Brenne. In the course of the construction of the new adjacent museum hall by Ieoh Ming Pei between 1998 and 2003, glass roofing was once more installed above the Schl√ºterhof, the inner courtyard with the masks by Andreas Schl√ºter. The new building by I. M. Pei with a surface area of on four floors, and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, was opened for temporary exhibitions in 2003. The Permanent Exhibition German History in Images and Artefacts was inaugurated in the Zeughaus by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 2 June 2006. As of 30 December 2008 the DHM assumed the legal form of a Public Law Foundation of the Federal Government (Stiftung √∂ffentlichen Rechts des Bundes). Founded in 2009 to establish a centre for the remembrance and documentation of flight and expulsion, the Stiftung Flucht, Vertreibung, Vers√∂hnung (Foundation Flight, Expulsion, Reconciliation) is under the aegis of the German Historical Museum.

She currently presents for BBC Sport, Channel 4, BT Sport, is the current president of the Rugby Football League (RFL) and formerly presented the religious programme Good Morning Sunday on BBC Radio 2. Early life and family Balding was educated at Downe House in Berkshire, where she was Head Girl and a contemporary of comedian Miranda Hart. Hart and Balding are in fact tenth-cousins, sharing a nine-times-great-grandfather in Sir William Leveson- Gower, 4th Baronet.Miranda BBC Two, November 2010 Clare Balding applied to read law at Christ's College, Cambridge, but failed her interview and realized that law was not what she most wanted to do.

The latter win led to a very emotional post-race interview with her brother. Her uncle Toby Balding trained winners in the Grand National, Cheltenham Gold Cup and Champion Hurdle. Furthermore, her maternal grandfather was the trainer Peter Hastings-Bass and her maternal uncle the 17th Earl of Huntingdon was once trainer to Queen Elizabeth II. Her maternal grandmother, Priscilla Hastings, is descended from the Earls of Derby and was one of the first women elected to membership of the Jockey Club.

According to Dugarry, Balding removed sections of the text and inserted promotional material about her new book, as well as details of her hosting of the women's European football championships and the words \\"And indeed she [Balding] sparkles all the way through the photo shoot,\\" despite Dougary commenting that this was not the case and that Balding was rather \\"a brisk, jolly-hockey-sticks type\\". In a statement, Saga claimed that it had not given Balding copy control and that the interview was edited in conjunction with the author.

She promised to be back on television covering the Epsom Derby, by the following Saturday. On 21 August 2009, she announced that the radioactive iodine had been successful with no signs of the cancer having spread. In July 2010, Balding made a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission over an article by writer A. A. Gill in The Sunday Times that she felt had mocked her sexuality and appearance and for which the newspaper refused to apologize.Caroline Davies Clare Balding complains to press watchdog over 'dyke' jibe, The Guardian, 30 July 2010 The PCC found in her favour, judging that Gill had \\"refer[red] to the complainant's sexuality in a demeaning and gratuitous way\\".Clare Balding complaint over sexuality is upheld BBC News, 17 September 2010; Retrieved 17 September 2010 In 2014, she was named in the top 10 on the World Pride Power list.

Balding later clarified on BBC's Have I Got News For You quiz that she believed Treadwell, who suffered from microdontia and hypodontia, to have had his teeth \\"kicked out\\" by a horse, a common injury suffered by jockeys, apologising again for her error. However, Treadwell stated that he was pleased with her comment, as a dentist offered to fix his teeth at no cost. \\"It was the best thing Clare ever said\\", Treadwell said. In 2014, Balding publicly backed Hacked Off and its campaign towards UK press self-regulation by \\"safeguarding the press from political interference while also giving vital protection to the vulnerable.\\"  Ancestors  Balding's matrilineal great-great-grandparents Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby and Lady Alice Montagu both descended from Henry VII. The earl's lineage can also be traced back to Sir Thomas Frankland. This makes Balding an 11-times-great-granddaughter of Oliver Cromwell. She is also descended, via Joseph C. Hoagland, from Sarah Rapelje, the first woman of European descent born in what is now New York, to Dutch-settler parents.

Several equivalent formulations, called the conformal Killing equation, exist in terms of the Lie derivative of the flow e.g. \\\\mathcal{L}_{X}g = \\\\lambda g for some function \\\\lambda on the manifold. For n e 2 there are a finite number of solutions, specifying the conformal symmetry of that space, but in two dimensions, there is an infinity of solutions. The name Killing refers to Wilhelm Killing, who first investigated Killing vector fields that preserve a Riemannian metric and satisfy the Killing equation \\\\mathcal{L}_{X}g = 0. Densitized metric tensor and Conformal Killing vectors A vector field X is a Killing vector field iff its flow (locally defined, as it may only be defined for finite times on compact subsets of the manifold) preserves the metric tensor or iff it satisfies : \\\\mathcal{L}_X g = 0. More generally, define a w-Killing vector field X as a vector field whose flow preserves the densitized metric g\\\\mu_g^w, where \\\\mu_g is the volume density defined by g (i.e. locally \\\\mu_g = \\\\sqrt{g} \\\\, dx^1\\\\cdots dx^n ) and w \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R} is its weight. Note that a Killing vector field preserves \\\\mu_g and so automatically also satisfies this more general equation. Also note that w = -2/n is the unique weight that makes the combination g \\\\mu_g^w invariant under scaling of the metric, therefore, only depending on the conformal structure. Now X is a w-Killing vector field iff :\\\\mathcal{L}_X \\\\left(g\\\\mu_g^{w}\\\\right) = (\\\\mathcal{L}_X g) \\\\mu_g^{w} + w g \\\\mu_g^{w -1} \\\\mathcal{L}_X \\\\mu_g = 0. Since \\\\mathcal{L}_X \\\\mu_g = \\\\operatorname{div}(X) \\\\mu_g this is equivalent to : \\\\mathcal{L}_X g = - w\\\\operatorname{div}(X) g. Taking traces of both sides, we conclude 2\\\\mathop{\\\\mathrm{div}}(X) = -w n \\\\operatorname{div}(X). Hence for w e -2/n, necessarily \\\\operatorname{div}(X) = 0 and a w-Killing vector field is just a normal Killing vector field whose flow preserves the metric. However, for w = -2/n, the flow of X merely has to preserve the conformal structure and is, by definition, a conformal Killing vector field. Equivalent formulations The following are equivalent # X is a conformal Killing vector field, # The (locally defined) flow of X preserves the conformal structure, # \\\\mathcal{L}_X (g\\\\mu_g^{-2/n}) = 0, # \\\\mathcal{L}_X g = \\\\frac{2}{n} \\\\operatorname{div}(X) g, # \\\\mathcal{L}_X g = \\\\lambda g for some function \\\\lambda. The discussion above proves the equivalence of all but the seemingly more general last form. However, the last two forms are also equivalent: taking traces shows that necessarily \\\\lambda = (2/n) \\\\operatorname{div}(X). The conformal Killing equation in (abstract) index notation Using that \\\\mathcal{L}_X g = 2 \\\\left( abla X^\\\\flat \\\\right)^{\\\\mathrm{symm}} where abla is the Levi Civita derivative of g (aka covariant derivative), and X^{\\\\flat}=g(X,\\\\cdot) is the dual 1 form of X (aka associated covariant vector aka vector with lowered indices), and {}^{\\\\mathrm{symm}} is projection on the symmetric part, one can write the conformal Killing equation in abstract index notation as : abla_a X_b + abla_b X_a = \\\\frac{2}{n}g_{ab} abla_{c}X^c. Another index notation to write the conformal Killing equations is : X_{\\\\mu; u}+X_{ u;\\\\mu} = \\\\frac{2}{n}g_{\\\\mu u} X^\\\\sigma_{;\\\\sigma}.

The Mountsorrel Railway, carrying granite from the Mountsorrel quarries, used to run to here; the line from Mountsorrel is still followed by a mineral conveyor to Barrow, where quarry rock is sorted for distribution. =Bus= The village is served by the 2 route that runs between Leicester and Loughborough via Sileby. History White's History, Gazetteer and Directory of the Counties of Leicester and Rutland (1877) says The village is known for a plesiosaur that was excavated here in 1851. The specimen of Atychodracon megacephalus, found in a lime pit outside the village, was nicknamed the \\"Barrow Kipper\\". At the centre of the village is a roundabout with a sign depecting its skeleton. The skeleton is now on display at the Leicester Museum & Art Gallery, with a full-size replica at Charnwood Museum in Loughborough. The village's football club has the skeleton on its badge.

Marked as in an espresso stain on the milk used. It is a play on ‚ÄúEspresso macchiato‚Äù which is an espresso with a drop or two of milk or cream. Related drinks Latte macchiato differs significantly from caff√® latte in several ways. First, in a latte macchiato, espresso is added to milk, rather than milk to espresso as in a caff√® latte. Second, a latte macchiato features more foam, rather than simply hot milk. A latte macchiato often uses only half an espresso shot or less. Finally, a latte macchiato is often a 'layered' drink, rather than being mixed as in a caff√® latte. Simply, in a caff√® latte, the emphasis is on the coffee, while in a latte macchiato, the emphasis is on the milk. The macchia is the little \\"spot\\" of cr√®ma left on top of the milk to clearly distinguish that the beverage is a latte macchiato and not a caff√® latte, where the espresso traditionally has been added before the milk, hence having no \\"mark\\". Conversely, caff√® macchiato, another similarly named beverage, is actually espresso \\"stained\\" with a small amount of milk. Preparation A latte macchiato may be prepared simply by frothing milk, generally producing generous foam, pouring it into a glass, and adding espresso. The frothing is generally extensive, yielding significant light, \\"dry\\" foam, with a layer of liquid milk underneath, rather than the \\"wet\\" microfoam used in latte art. Alternatively, it may be prepared as a layered drink, with the espresso gently poured (most gently out of a small espresso brew pitcher, over the back of a spoon) so that it forms a layer between the denser liquid milk below and the lighter foam above. In this case a glass is essential for the layers to be visible. The espresso may be brewed into a standard espresso cup or shot glass and then swiftly dumped in, or may be brewed into a specialized espresso brew pitcher, which makes pouring easier, particularly for layering.

Minister of Antiochus III Seleucus's death placed Hermeias in the possession of almost undisputed power, the young king, Antiochus III (223-187 BC), being then only in his 15th year; and his jealous and grasping disposition led him to remove as far as possible all competitors for power. The formidable revolt of Molon and Alexander in the eastern provinces of the kingdom seemed to demand all the attention of Antiochus, but Hermeias persuaded him to entrust the conduct of the army sent against the insurgents to his generals, Xenon and Theodotus, while he advanced in person to attack Coele-Syria. Here, however, the king met with a complete repulse, while the army sent against Molon was totally defeated by that general, who made himself master in consequence of several of the provinces bordering the Tigris. The opinion of Hermeias, who still opposed the march of Antiochus to the East, was now overruled, and the king took the field in person the following spring. But though the favourite had succeeded in removing his chief opponent, Epigenes, by a fabricated charge of conspiracy,http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/5*.html#50 Polybius 5 50 his utter incapacity for military affairs was fully apparent in the ensuing campaign, in which, nevertheless, Antiochus, having followed the advice of Zeuxis, in opposition to that of Hermeias, defeated Molon in a pitched battle and recovered the revolted provinces. However, during the subsequent halt at Seleucia on the Tigris, Hermeias had again an opportunity to display his evil disposition with the cruelties with which, notwithstanding the opposition of Antiochus, he stained the victory of the young king. Fall Meanwhile, the birth of a son of Antiochus, by Laodice, is said to have excited in the mind of this ambitious minister the project of getting rid of the king himself, in order that he might rule with still more uncontrolled authority under the name of his infant son. This scheme was revealed in time to Antiochus, who had long regarded Hermeias with fear as well as aversion, and he now gladly availed himself of the assistance of his physician, Apollophanes, and others of his friends, to rid himself of his minister by assassination (220 BC). Polybius, who is the sole source for all the preceding facts, has drawn the character of Hermeias in the blackest colours, and represents his death as a subject of general rejoicing, though he considers his fate as a very inadequate punishment for his misdeeds.

LGBT History Month provides role models, builds community, and represents a civil rights statement about the contributions of the LGBTQ+ community. As of 2020, LGBT History Month is a month-long celebration that is specific to Hungary, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Greenland, and the city of Berlin. In the United States, Canada, and Australia, it is celebrated in October to coincide with National Coming Out Day on 11 October and to commemorate the first and second marches on Washington in 1979 and 1987 for LGBT rights. In Hungary and the United Kingdom, it is observed during February; in the UK this coincides with a major celebration of the 2003 abolition of Section 28. In Berlin, It is known as Queer History Month and is celebrated in June.  National celebrations  = Australia = In October 2016, Minus 18 organised the first Australian LGBT History Month in partnership with the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives, and the Safe Schools Coalition Victoria. = Brazil = Brazil celebrates LGBT History Month. = Canada = Canada celebrates LGBT History Month in October. = Greenland = Greenland celebrates LGBT History Month. = Hungary = LGBT History Month has been celebrated in February since 2013, and the planned 2020 event is the 8th. The program series is coordinated by H√°tt√©r Society and Labrisz Lesbian Association, events are organized in partnership with other LGBT organization, cultural and academic institutions, professional organizations etc. The majority of the events take place in Budapest, but a few events are also organized in larger cities all over the country, e.g. in Debrecen, P√©cs, Miskolc and Szeged. In 2013 there were nearly 30 events in the cities of Budapest, Miskolc and Szeged. In 2015 there were 37 events, with some held in Tahit√≥tfalu and Csob√°nka As of 2019 there were about 40 events for the celebration. = United Kingdom = Schools OUT UK - The LGBT+ Education Charity (a registered charity since February 2015), is the founding organiser of LGBT+ History Month UK. The steering committee of around 10 - 15 people has a majority of current or former teachers. Schools OUT evolved from The Gay Teachers' Group, a socially-supportive network established in 1974 following the sacking of a London teacher who had been 'outed' to his managers by a student. LGBT+ History Month was initiated in the UK by Sue Sanders and Paul Patrick, then co-chairs of Schools OUT UK, and first took place in February 2005. After Paul Patrick's death in 2008, Tony Fenwick became co-chair alongside Sanders, then later CEO. In 2016 he was awarded an MBE on behalf of the charity. He died in July 2020, aged 60. Sue Sanders was awarded an Emeritus Professorship by The Harvey Milk Institute in 2015. LGBT+ History Month is an annual event in the United Kingdom taking place every February. The event came in the wake of the abolition of Section 28 in 2003, the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003 as well as the government's proposals to bring in a single equality act and a public duty, although this, in fact, did not come to fruition until 2010. The Month is intended as a means to raise awareness of, and combat prejudice against the LGBT community while celebrating its achievement and diversity and making it more visible. History Month has three taglines -'Claiming our past. Celebrating our present. Creating our future', in addition to the 'Educate OUT Prejudice' motto of parent charity Schools OUT UK The first celebration in 2005 saw the organisation of over 150 events around the UK. The second logo for the organisation behind the month was designed by LGBT typographer Tony Malone in 2006, and was reworked by him in 2007 when it then became the corporate logo for the national committee. Until 2019, each yearly iteration of the Month received its own mark designed by students of the University of the Arts and later by design students at the University of Bedfordshire. The 2020 and 2021 logos were designed by students from Goldsmiths University. For 2022, the design was opened up as a competition for schools and colleges, universities and youth groups. The initiative received government backing from the deputy DfES and Equalities Minister Jacqui Smith, although some sections of the press argued against its political correctness, and pointed out that the sexuality of some historical figures is more a matter of speculation than fact. Supporters of the event countered that it is important to challenge heterosexist attitudes in society. The DfES promised funding for LGBT History Month for the first two years to help get the event off the ground. It is now very well established and has garnered support from other sources. Long standing sponsors include the Metropolitan Police Service, the Metropolitan Police Authority, Amnesty International and the Crown Prosecution Service. Patrons of the Month include Cyril Nri, Ian McKellen, Angela Eagle, Gareth Thomas, Aderonke Apata (founder of African Rainbow), Tom Robinson, Christine Burns, Peter Tatchell and Labi Siffre.  Launches  Each year, a \\"launch event\\" takes place in November, to build awareness for the following February.

On 5 March 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown hosted a reception at Downing Street to mark the Month.  National Curriculum Themes  Since 2011, the month has been linked to a subject in the National Curriculum. The steering committee hope to cover all subjects eventually. There are free resources available on the History Month website.

OUTing the Past festival and the annual Alan Horsfall Lecture  OUTing The Past  OUTing The Past is an annual festival of LGBT history. It runs throughout February and into March. 2015 saw the first edition of OUTing The Past, a festival of LGBT History spearheaded by Dr Jeff Evans. The festival started in three venues in Manchester: the LGBT Foundation, The Central Library and the Peoples History Museum. Comprising several presentations of diverse history presented by a mixture of academics, LGBT enthusiasts and activists. Sitting alongside the popular presentations was an academic conference with the inaugural Allan Horsfall Lecture given by Professor Charles Upchurch of Florida University. This is now a yearly event funded by the Campaign for Homosexual Equality. Stephen M Hornby was appointed as the first National Playwright in Residence to LGBT History Month. The first production created as a result of this was a three part heritage premiere co- written with Ric Brady and performed across the weekend called \\"A Very Victorian Scandal\\" which dramatised new research about a drag ball in 1880 in Hulme. In 2016 the festival expanded to six hubs around England and the conference had its own slot. The Alan Horsfall lecture was given by Professor Susan Stryker of the University of Arizona. The national heritage premieres were \\"Mister Stokes: The Man-Woman of Manchester\\" written by Abi Hynes, which told the story of Harry Stokes a Victorian trans pioneer and \\"Devils in Human Shape\\" by Tom Marshman, which dramatized Georgian sodomy trials in Bristol. In 2017, there were 18 venues round the country and by now over a hundred presentations on LGBT history had been given. The Alan Horsfall lecture was given by Diana Souhami. The national heritage premieres were \\"The Burnley Buggers' Ball\\" by Stephen M Hornby, which told the story of the first public meeting to establish an LGBT Center in the UK in 1971 at Burnley Library, and \\"Burnley's Lesbian Liberator\\" by Abi Hynes which told the story of one of the first demonstrations in support of a woman sacked for wearing a Lesbian Liberation badge by the Burnley & Pendle Bus Company in 1978. In 2018, there were 11 venues which included Wales and Northern Ireland. The lecture was given by Tom Robinson. In 2019 there were 18 venues including the first international events in The Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Norway and New York. The lecture was given by Dr Jeffrey Weeks in Belfast. The national heritage premiere was \\"The Adhesion of Love\\" by Stephen M Hornby, which toured to a number of venues in the North West of England. It told the story of a visit by a member of the Eagle Street College to Walt Whitman in 1891.The festival also premiered another play \\"A Queer C√©il√≠ at the Marty Forsythe\\", commissioned by Dr Jeff Evans and based on events in Ulster‚Äôs LGBT+ history that he witnessed first hand. It was performed in the very social club described in the script. The play earned actor Christopher Grant a nomination as best supporting actor at the Irish Times Irish Theatre Awards 2020 From 2016, Schools OUT UK has partnered with several contract publishers to produce magazines as an Official Guide to LGBT History Month, putting 35,000 copies of their publication into every secondary school in the UK, plus community spaces, charities and businesses. The magazine had introductions from the leaders of all the main political parties and the Mayor of London. The magazine's Diversity Dashboard runs job adverts and events listings from LGBT-friendly employers and the community.  Scotland  In 2005 and 2006, LGBT History Month was celebrated in Scotland as an LGBT community event, receiving support from LGBT community history projects such as Our Story Scotland and Remember When. For 2007 and 2008, the Scottish Government provided funding for a post at LGBT Youth Scotland to bring LGBT History Month into the wider community, including schools and youth groups. In 2020 Scotland's theme was \\"What have we learned? 20 years since the repeal of Section 28.\\" = United States = LGBTQ+ History Month originated in the United States as Lesbian and Gay History Month, and was first celebrated in October 1994. It was founded by Missouri high-school history teacher Rodney Wilson. Wilson, the first openly gay public school teacher in Missouri, originated the idea, served as founder on the first coordinating committee, and chose October as the month of celebration. Among early supporters and members of the first coordinating committee were Kevin Jennings of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN); Kevin Boyer of the Gerber/Hart Gay and Lesbian Library and Archives in Chicago; Paul Varnell, writer for the Windy City Times; Torey Wilson, Chicago area teacher; Johnda Boyce, women's studies major at Columbus State University and Jessea Greenman of UC-Berkeley. Many gay and lesbian organizations supported the concept early on as did Governors William Weld of Massachusetts and Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, Mayors such as Thomas Menino of Boston and Wellington Webb of Denver, who recognized the inaugural month with official proclamations. In 1995, the National Education Association indicated support of LGBT History Month as well as other history months by resolution at its General Assembly. October was chosen by Wilson as the month for the celebration because the first and second LGBT Marches on Washington, in 1979 and 1987, were in October; National Coming Out Day is on 11 October, chosen to mark the date of the Second March of Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights in 1987, and October is within the academic calendar yeart. LGBT History Month is intended to encourage honesty and openness about being LGBT. While it was first known as Lesbian and Gay History Month, the coordinating committee soon added \\"bisexual\\" to the title. It has subsequently become known as LGBTQ+ History Month. The event has received criticism from conservative groups, such as the Concerned Women for America and others who believe it to be a form of \\"indoctrination.\\" In 2006, Equality Forum began picking 31 LGBTQ icons from all over the world through all eras of history and highlighting one each day in October. In 2011, Equality Forum introduced an internal search engine for all Icons from inception in 2006 to present. such as African-American, athlete, California, Germany, HIV/AIDS, Military, Religion, Transgender, Youth; visitors to the site will be provided with links to all Icons in that category. In 2012, for the first time, two American school districts celebrated LGBT History Month. The Broward County school district in Florida signed a resolution in September in support of LGBT Americans, and later that year the Los Angeles school district, America's second-largest, also signed on.  Citywide celebrations  = Berlin = In Berlin, it is known as Queer History Month instead of LGBT History Month. Every year it takes place in June. It is to educate and help people deal with sexual, sexual diversity, and anti-discrimination in small projects. During Queer History Month (QHM), people are able to find detailed lessons on queer history suitable for both school and non-school education. Also, educational institutions provide education to schools and youth institutions directly.

Parker played as a right back for clubs Arsenal and Southampton in his playing career. As a manager he was at the helm of Southampton as well as Norwich City. Playing career =Southampton= Born in Woolston, Southampton, Parker began playing with local sides, such as Sholing Rangers and Sholing Athletic , before joining Southern League side Southampton as an amateur in 1918, just before the end of the First World War. In his first season for the Saints, he was playing in the War League and in friendlies, and made a total of 39 appearances, scoring 12 goals, of which 10 were penalties, thus making him the club's second highest scorer behind Bill Rawlings. In 1919, after the end of hostilities, professional football restarted and for the next seven seasons he was a virtual ever-present at right back, forming a successful full-back partnership with Fred Titmuss. Parker was described in Holley & Chalk's The Alphabet of the Saints as \\"never the fastest of players, he had wonderful positional sense and his tackling was always well-timed\\". Southampton became founder members of the Third Division for the start of the 1920‚Äì21 season and were promoted as champions to the Second Division in 1922. Southampton reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1925 but in the match at Stamford Bridge on 28 March 1925 they were eliminated by Sheffield United when Parker had a dreadful afternoon, first scoring an own-goal, then suffering a rare miss from the penalty spot (shooting straight at the 'keeper) before a mix-up between him and goalkeeper Tommy Allen gave Sheffield their second goal. During his time at Southampton, Parker also won a solitary cap for England, against France on 21 May 1925. Eventually bigger clubs started making overtures towards Southampton for Parker's services. At first these were resisted, but with money needed to finance the purchase of The Dell, Southampton reluctantly accepted an offer of ¬£3,250 from Herbert Chapman's Arsenal in spring 1926, and he was on his way to Highbury. In all he played 275 first-team matches for Southampton, scoring 12 goals (not including his wartime appearances). =Arsenal= Parker made his Arsenal debut against Blackburn Rovers on 3 April 1926. This was the first match of 172 consecutive first-team matches for Arsenal, a club record that still stands today. Reliable and assured at the back, Parker soon became Arsenal captain, and skippered the club to their first Cup final in the 1926‚Äì27 season, which they lost 1‚Äì0 to Cardiff City. Parker's luck was better with his next trip to Wembley in 1929‚Äì30 as Arsenal beat Huddersfield Town 2‚Äì0 and Parker became the first Arsenal captain to lift the FA Cup trophy. He then played in Arsenal's 2‚Äì1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday in the Charity Shield at Stamford Bridge in October 1930. Parker went on to captain Arsenal to their 1930‚Äì31 Championship triumph, and the 1931‚Äì32 Cup final (which they lost 2‚Äì1, controversially, to Newcastle United). Throughout all this time Parker was a near ever-present in the side, missing just six league games in seven seasons with the club. However, by 1932 Parker was nearly 35, and at the start of the 1932‚Äì33 season he was replaced at right back by George Male. He made his last appearance in an Arsenal shirt on 8 October 1932 against Derby County, and left the club in 1933 to become manager of Norwich City. In total, he played 294 matches for Arsenal, scoring 17 goals (the majority of them being penalties, as he was the club's first-choice taker for much of his career). Despite being an FA Cup and League-winning captain, he never won any further England caps to add to the one he picked up at Southampton, with Roy Goodall and Tom Cooper keeping him out of the national side. Management career =Norwich City= With Parker as manager, Norwich City won the Third Division South in 1933‚Äì34 and thus promotion to the Second Division. =Southampton= Parker moved back to his old club Southampton in March 1937, taking over from George Goss who had acted as manager since the previous summer without any real success. On his arrival at The Dell, with money available for new players, Parker set about building a side to push for promotion from Division 2. Over two seasons he spent ¬£9,000 on new players, bringing in wingers Harry Osman and Billy Bevis, goalkeeper Sam Warhurst and centre-half Bill Dodgin. The most important signing, however, was when he signed Ted Bates from his former club Norwich City. Bates was later to go on to transform Southampton into a First Division team. By 1939, Parker had built a settled side but the Second World War soon intervened and put a halt to competitive football, making all Parker's planning wasted. Parker continued as secretary-manager throughout the difficult initial years of the war, fielding sides made up mostly from guest players. In June 1943, after a row with the Saints' board, he resigned his position to take up employment outside football as a ship's surveyor in Southampton Docks with Lloyd's registry. =Norwich City (second spell)= He later had a second, less successful spell at Norwich in the 1950s which saw the club finish at the bottom of the League. After management Parker returned to his job as a ship's surveyor until he retired in 1962. Soon after retirement, he was asked by Ted Bates (who by then was Saints' manager) to take on a part-time scouting role later becoming chief scout, a post he finally relinquished in 1975. He died aged 89 in 1987.

Principal deity of the temple is Sree Muthappan, whose divinity is presented as a ritualistic theyyam enactment in two versions called Thiruvappana and Vellattam. According to the local tradition the presiding deity is a manifestation of Lord Shiva. Vellattam and Thiruvappana are the generic names for two types of ' Theyyam Ketti-aadal ' in the kavu/temples of North Malabar. Vellattom is a minor version of the ritual enactment where the ornaments, decorations and parapharnelia are minimal thanks to which all actions including vaaythari (speech) is maximum and Attam (dance) will be at its peak. If you compare this level of enactment to the idol of a deity in a temple sanctum which is installed as per sathwic sasthra and vedic rituals, Vellattom is at par with the idol alone without the prabha-mandalam which circles it. A more easier example is the Seeveli ceremony with only the small idol on top of the elephant. On the other hand, Thiruvappana is the full version, with royal regalia and bigger dimension of prabhamandalam. Because the decorations are more and are of binding nature, the action is minimal and sluggish and the uriyaadal (replies to prayers) will be crisp, to the point and predictions will be accurate. To compare, Thiruvappana stands at par with temple idol with the Prabha-mandalam (representing the auric circle) around it and the Seeveli with the big Swarna-Kolam covering the small idol on top of the elephant . Muthappan is considered as the manifestation of Lord Shiva himself in Nayattu (hunter) format. The Vellattam which comes initially is Siva himself as the said minimal version. But the Vellattom which comes along with the grand Thiruvappana of Muthappan later on, is the minimal version of Vishnu who according to mythology, comes to Siva's assistance when he started travelling with the poykannu (blindfold) and started suffering serious difficulties to travel and hunt for food. Rituals of the temple is unique in that it does not follow the Satvic Brahminical form of worship, as in other Hindu temples of Kerala. The main mode of worship is the ritual enactment of both the versions of Muthappan, through a traditional dance known as Muthappan Theyyam. Fish, meat and toddy are the customary offerings to Muthappan. Muthappan Thiruvoppana Mahothsavam is the major festival of the temple, celebrated for three days every year on 19, 20 and 21 of Kumbham (the days correspond to 3, 4 and 5 March). The legends of Muthappan Thiruvappana or Valiya Muttapan(Vishnu) on left and the Vellatom or Cheriya Muttapan(Shiva) on right A version of the legend of Ponnu Muthappan is narrated here: The King of Ancharamana (Ayyankara Vazhunnor) of Eruvessi village and his wife, Padikutty Amma, had no offspring. Padikutty was an ardent devotee of Shiva and when she found a baby floating in a basket of flowers in the river water when she was coming back after a bath in the river, she took it as the blessing of Lord Shiva, and so was her husband. The child grew up and in his boyhood, he was always for the benefit of downtrodden and poor people. However, to the agony of his family he practiced hunting, and also started eating flesh, which was not allowed for a Naduvazhi. Unable to bear the indictments from his family, the boy decided to leave home. When his mother attempted to stop him, he looked at her in fury and appeared in his original godly figure before the parent. She bowed down before her son. Nonetheless, she requested him to cover his eyes with a Poikannu, a type of shield for the eyes, since she was afraid that such a fiery look on another occasion may cause to emanate the cosmic force, Shakti, that could change the entire world. Wearing a shield on his eyes, he left the family, and passed through various villages in Malabar, such as Kunnathurpadi, Puralimala, Padavil, Thillenkeri, Kannapuram, Parassinikadavu and Valluvankadav. The legend relates Muthappan with a tribal family for the divine boy started being called as \\"Muthappan\\". Accordingly, when he reached a village called Kunnathurpadi, he got a tribalman, Chantan as his friend. One day, when he saw Chantan tapping toddy from Palm tree the boy asked for it but was denied. All of sudden, Chantan was cursed and became a stone. His wife prayed and offered to perform the rituals, Oottu, Tiruvappana and Amruthakalasam, to propitiate the boy in the month of Dhanu. The boy relented and gave her husband back. The Chantan family started to conduct pooja to propitiate the boy and they called him in the name: \\"Muthappan\\". However, according to another version of the legend Muthappan climbed the coconut tree and emptied the toddy jar in the absence of Chantan. When Chantan returned and saw Muthappan holding the jar, he was provoked and defied the latter. It was at this instant, Chantan was cursed. The legend also describes a dog which always followed Muthappan throughout his journey. Hence, in the temple of Muthappan, dogs are considered divine and the temple entrance has an idol of dog, at both sides. Rituals and festivals The ritualistic enactment of both the minimal and maxima versions of Sree Muthappan, Thiruvappana and Vellattam, is performed daily in the early morning and in the evening. Puthari Thiruvappana festival, conducted on 16 Vrichikam (this Malayalam day corresponds to 1 or 2 December), is the first Thiruvappana of the temple year. It is associated with the harvesting season of the region. The last Thiruvappana of the temple year is on 30 Kanni every year.

He ended the first Persian occupation of Egypt (i.e. the Twenty-seventh Dynasty: 525‚Äì404 BC) and reigned from 404 BC to 399 BC.Clayton 1999, p. 202.

An ancient Egyptian prophetic text, the Demotic Chronicle (3rd/2nd century BC), states: Amyrtaeus was probably the grandson of the Amyrtaeus of Sais who, with the Libyan Overseer, Inaros II (himself a grandson of Pharaoh Psamtik III), led a rebellion between 465 BC and 463 BC against the Satrap of Artaxerxes I. He is known from Aramaic and ancient Greek sources, and is mentioned in the Demotic Chronicle. A \\"virtually unknown ruler\\", he is not known to have left any monuments, and his name in Egyptian is only reconstructed from demotic notices: no hieroglyphic writing of his names has been found.Clayton 1999, pp. 201, 203. Daric of Artaxerxes II, against whom Amyrtaeus rebelled. Cabinet des M√©dailles, Paris. = Coup and reign = Before assuming the throne of Egypt, Amyrtaeus had revolted against the Persian King Darius II (423‚Äì404 BC) as early as 411 BC, leading a guerrilla action in the western Nile Delta around his home city of Sais. Following the death of Darius, Amyrtaeus declared himself king in 404 BC. According to Isocrates, Artaxerxes II assembled an army in Phoenicia under the command of Abrocomas to retake Egypt shortly after coming to the Persian throne, but political problems with his brother Cyrus the Younger prevented this from taking place, allowing the Egyptians sufficient time to throw off Achaemenid rule. While the rule of Amyrtaeus in the western Delta was established by 404 BC, Artaxerxes II continued to be recognized as king at Elephantine as late as 401 BC, but Aramaic papyri from the site refer to Regnal Year 5 of Amyrtaeus in September 400 BC.Sachau, Eduard (1909). \\"Ein altaramareischer Papyrus aus der Zeit der aegyptischen Koenigs Amyrtaeus\\", in Florilegium: ou, Recueil de travaux d'√©rudition d√©di√©s √† monsieur le marquis Melchior de Vog√º√© √† l'occasion du quatre-vingti√®me anniversaire de sa naissance, 18 octobre 1909. Paris: Imprimerie Nationale. pp. 529-538. The Elephantine papyri also demonstrate that between 404 and 400 BC (or even 398 BC) Upper Egypt remained under Persian control, while the forces of Amyrtaeus dominated the Delta. Androsphinx of Pharaoh Nepherites I. Louvre, Paris. In 1st century BC, the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote in his Bibliotheca historica (XIV, 35.3‚Äì5) that a King named Psamtik ‚Äî which seems to be identified with Amyrtaeus, perhaps being \\"Psamtik\\" his lost regnal name ‚Äî murdered the Greek admiral Tamos who had taken refuge in Egypt after the defeat of the rebel Cyrus. If the information was correct, Amyrtaeus would seem to have acted in this way to ingratiate himself with Artaxerxes II. It is likely that King Amyrtaeus concluded an alliance with Sparta implying that Egypt was provided with military aid by Sparta in exchange for grain. = Fall and death = Amyrtaeus was defeated in open battle by his successor, Nepherites I of MendesCimmino 2003, p. 388. and executed at Memphis, an event which the Aramaic papyrus Brooklyn 13 implies occurred in October 399 BC. Nepherites I then transferred the capital to Mendes (Lower Egypt). There is no further information available regarding Amyrtaeus' rule, fall and death. Nepherites I reigned until 393 BC, being succeeded by his designated heir, his son Hakor. References Bibliography * Cimmino, Franco (2003). Dizionario delle Dinastie Faraoniche.

Playing career =High school= Clements attended Canevin Catholic High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Clements was a four-year letterman in both football and basketball. He was also offered a basketball scholarship at North Carolina, but decided to play football instead. He is the only athlete in Canevin history to have his jersey retired. =College= Clements was the starting quarterback for the Notre Dame football team from 1972 to 1974 and led the team to a national championship in 1973. In the December 31, 1973, Sugar Bowl matchup against Alabama, Clements had a 36-yard square-out completion to tight end Robin Weber on 3rd and 9 from his own end zone with 2:00 left to secure a 24-23 victory. In 1974, Clements finished fourth in the voting for the Heisman Trophy and was voted a first- team All-American.http://www.packers.com/team/coaches/tom- clements/bb67e02f-a2b1-4543-83af-00f437249c9f =Professional= After graduation, Clements began a career in the Canadian Football League, quarterbacking the Ottawa Rough Riders for four seasons and winning the league's Rookie-of-the-Year award in his inaugural campaign. The next season, he helped to lead the team to what became the Rough Riders' last Grey Cup victory. After taking a powerful hit, a woozy Clements threw a pass to tight- end Tony Gabriel in the end zone, a catch which became famous in defeating the Saskatchewan Roughriders. During his time with Ottawa, Clements shared the passing duties with Condredge Holloway, from 1975 to 1977 as the quarterback getting the most playing time. In 1978, their stats were comparable, except for Holloway throwing only two interceptions to 12 by Clements. Clements continued his career with the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 1979, but did not fare well, throwing only two touchdowns to 11 interceptions and being replaced by Danny Sanders. However, a trade to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats quickly rejuvenated Clements, and he led the CFL in passing yards with 2,803, the last to do so with less than 3,000 yards. In 1980, Clements was briefly on the roster of the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs, coached by former Montreal Alouettes head coach Marv Levy, but was the third-string quarterback for a team that stressed the running game. In 1981, Clements returned to the Tiger-Cats and threw for 4,536 yards. He improved his numbers the next season with 4,706 yards. In 1983, Clements was traded from Hamilton to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for long-time Blue Bomber quarterback Dieter Brock. The next year, those two teams, Hamilton and Winnipeg, faced each other in the Grey Cup. Clements led the Bombers to their first Grey Cup victory since 1962. In 1986, he set a new completion percentage record with 67.5, 173 out of 256. Clements finished his playing career with Winnipeg in 1987 and was also named the league's Most Outstanding Player. He finished his CFL career with over 39,000 passing yards, 252 passing touchdowns, and a 60.35 completion percentage. In 2005, for the 75th anniversary of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Clements was selected one of the Bombers 20 all-time great players. In addition, in November 2006, he was voted one of the CFL's Top 50 players (#47) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network TSN. Clements was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1994. Coaching career In 1992, Clements was hired as quarterbacks coach for Notre Dame, where he served until 1995 under head coach Lou Holtz. After practicing law in 1996, Clements took his first NFL job, working as the quarterback coach for the New Orleans Saints from 1997 to 1999. Clements would hold the same job in 2000 with the Kansas City Chiefs, and between 2001 and 2003 with the Pittsburgh Steelers; under Clements's tutelage, the Chiefs' Elvis Grbac (in 2000) and the Steelers' Kordell Stewart (in 2001) and Tommy Maddox (in 2002) each reached the Pro Bowl. =Buffalo Bills= In 2004 and 2005 Clements served as offensive coordinator for the Buffalo Bills, but was released by the team after a front-office shakeup in which Marv Levy, his coach with the Chiefs in 1980, assumed the position of general manager and ultimately installed Dick Jauron as the team's new head coach. =Green Bay Packers= Upon the hiring of Mike McCarthy to be the head coach of the Green Bay Packers on January 11, 2006, the Packers parted ways with several assistant coaches, and McCarthy later interviewed NFL Europe head coach Steve Logan and Clements, settling on Clements on January 28, 2006. During Clements time as the quarterbacks coach with the Packers, he has worked with starting quarterbacks: Brett Favre, Aaron Rodgers, and Matt Flynn. In 2007, Favre statistically had one of his best seasons with the Packers, taking them to the NFC Championship game. Clements is also credited for assisting in the development of one of the game's elite quarterbacks in Aaron Rodgers, as the only player in NFL history to throw for 4,000+ yards during his first two years as a starting quarterback in 2008 and 2009, and winning Super Bowl XLV and Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award in Rodgers' third year as a starting quarterback in 2010. In Week 17 of the 2011 season, after the Packers went 14-1, McCarthy chose to deactivate Rodgers to keep him healthy for the playoffs and start backup quarterback, Matt Flynn, on January 1, 2012 at Lambeau Field vs. the Detroit Lions, Flynn's second start in his career. Throughout the game, Clements worked with Flynn on the sidelines, showing him what to look for in the photos from the previous offensive series. Flynn had a record-setting performance, throwing for 480 yards and 6 touchdowns, both single game records for the Packers. On February 12, 2015, Clements role was elevated to assistant head coach with respective play-calling responsibilities. On January 26, 2017, McCarthy announced Clements' contract had expired and he would move on to pursue other opportunities. =Arizona Cardinals= On January 22, 2019, Clements was hired as passing game coordinator/quarterbacks coach for the Arizona Cardinals on the staff of new head coach Kliff Kingsbury after being out of the NFL the past two years. Clements was hired as the primary offensive assistant because no offensive coordinator on the staff was added, with Kingsbury calling plays and doing other coordinator-type duties.https://www.apnews.com/c1a01ce6e253479a91c82e583b07055c Personal life While still in the CFL, Clements received his Juris Doctor degree magna cum laude from Notre Dame Law School in 1986. Upon the completion of his playing career, he practiced law in Chicago for five years at the law firm Bell, Boyd & Lloyd (now K&L; Gates).

The 'thorpe' part of the name is a variant of the Middle English word thorp, meaning hamlet or small village. The parish church of St. Andrew was started in 1220 by the family of Lord William of Ludbrook. It was restored in 1840 and again in 1907. The 14th century tower still remains. The village has three public houses: The Axe and Square, The Bull's Head and The Railway. Another public house, the King William IV was turned into a Tesco Express in 2013.

The Ballantines were both inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2008, with a shared citation. Biography Born in New York City, the son of Stella Commins Ballantine (half-niece of anarchist Emma Goldman) and the Scottish actor and sculptor Edward James Ballantine, Ian Ballantine received his undergraduate degree from Columbia College and his graduate degree from the London School of Economics. His Master's thesis featured the possibilities of paperback printing. In 1939, the year of his marriage to Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Norah, he initiated the distribution of Penguin Books in the United States (Penguin U.S. was later renamed New American Library). As a team, the Ballantines were involved in the formation of Bantam Books in 1945, and he was the first president of Bantam from 1945 to 1952. Ballantine Books was one of the earliest publishers of science fiction paperback originals, with writers including Arthur C. Clarke and Frederik Pohl. During the 1960s, they published the first authorized paperback edition of J. R. R. Tolkien's books. Lin Carter edited their Ballantine Adult Fantasy series of classics by H. P. Lovecraft and others in the 1970s. From 1968 through 1975 Ballantine Books published a series of 156 paperbook books under the series title \\"Ballantine's Illustrated History of World War II\\", later retitled \\"Ballantine's Illustrated History of the Violent Century\\". These were printed in both the United States and United Kingdom. In the 1980s, Bantam books published an 18 book series on the Vietnam war in the same trade paperback format as the earlier Ballantine series, featuring color photographs. After Ballantine Books was acquired by Random House in 1973, the Ballantines became freelance consulting editors and publishers during the 1970s. Ian and Betty Ballantine won one special World Fantasy Award for professional work in 1975 and another one shared with Joy Chant and other creators of The High Kings (Bantam, 1983), a reference book on the Matter of Britain that incorporates retellings. (It was also a runner-up in nonfiction Hugo and Locus Award categories.) Their son Richard Ballantine was an author and journalist specializing in cycling topics. Ballantine Books has a backlist of more than 3,000 titles, and its imprints include Ballantine Books, Ballantine Reader's Circle, Del Rey, Del Rey/LucasBooks, Fawcett, Ivy, One World and Wellspring. Ian Ballantine was 79 when he died of a heart attack in 1995. The speakers at his May 12, 1995, memorial service included Bantam Books publisher Irwyn Applebaum, Ballantine Books vice president George Davidson and Penguin Group chief executive Peter Mayer.

For example, polyethylene is the polyolefin produced by polymerizing the olefin ethylene. Polypropylene is another common polyolefin which is made from the olefin propylene. Industrial polyolefins Most polyolefin produced on an industrial scale are made via polymerization through the use of catalysts. There are four major types of polyolefin catalysts Handbook of Thermoplastics, Second Edition, O. Olabisi & K. Adewale (Ed.) CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, Florida, U. S. A. ISBN: 13: 978-1- 4665-7722-0, 2016, namely: (1) chromium-based catalysts; (2) Ziegler‚ÄìNatta catalysts;(3) metallocene single-site catalysts (SSC); and (4) post- metallocene SSC. All four categories are important for polyethylenes, but the last three categories of catalysts are far more relevant for polypropylenes. ¬∑ Thermoplastic polyolefins: low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), very-low-density polyethylene (VLDPE), ultra-low-density polyethylene (ULDPE), medium-density polyethylene (MDPE),, polypropylene (PP), polymethylpentene (PMP), polybutene-1 (PB-1); ethylene-octene copolymers, stereo-block PP, olefin block copolymers, propylene‚Äìbutane copolymers ¬∑ Polyolefin elastomers (POE): polyisobutylene (PIB), poly(a-olefin)s, ethylene propylene rubber (EPR), ethylene propylene diene monomer (M-class) rubber (EPDM rubber) Properties Polyolefin properties range from liquidlike to rigid solids, and are primarily determined by their molecular weight and degree of crystallinity. Polyolefin degrees of crystallinity range from 0% (liquidlike) to 60% or higher (rigid plastics). Crystallinity is primarily governed by the lengths of polymer's crystallizable sequences established during polymerization.Tashiro, Stein, Hsu, Macromolecules 25 (1992) 1801-1810 Examples include adding a small percentage of comonomer like 1-hexene or 1-octene during the polymerization of ethylene,Alizadeh et. al., Macromolecules 32 (1999) 6221-6235 or occasional irregular insertions (\\"stereo\\" or \\"regio\\" defects) during the polymerization of isotactic propylene. The polymer's ability to crystallize to high degrees decreases with increasing content of defects. Low degrees of crystallinity (0‚Äì20%) are associated with liquidlike-to-elastomeric properties. Intermediate degrees of crystallinity (20‚Äì50%) are associated with ductile thermoplastics, and degrees of crystallity over 50% are associated with rigid and sometimes brittle plastics.A. J. Kinloch, R. J. Young, The Fracture Behaviour of Polymers, Chapman & Hall, 1995. pp. 338-369. Polyolefin surfaces are not effectively joined together by solvent welding because they have excellent chemical resistance and are unaffected by common solvents. They can be adhesively bonded after surface treatment (they inherently have very low surface energies and don't wet-out well (the process of being covered and filled with resin)), and by some superglues (cyanoacrylates) and reactive (meth)acrylate glues.\\"Properties and Applications of Polyolefin Bonding\\" \\" Master Bond Inc.\\" Retrieved on June 24, 2013 They are extremely inert chemically but exhibit decreased strength at lower and higher temperatures. As a result of this, thermal welding is a common bonding technique. Practically all polyolefins that are of any practical or commercial importance are poly-alpha-olefin (or poly-Œ±-olefin or polyalphaolefin, sometimes abbreviated as PAO), a polymer made by polymerizing an alpha-olefin. An alpha-olefin (or Œ±-olefin) is an alkene where the carbon-carbon double bond starts at the Œ±-carbon atom, i.e. the double bond is between the #1 and #2 carbons in the molecule. Alpha- olefins such as 1-hexene may be used as co-monomers to give an alkyl branched polymer (see chemical structure below), although 1-decene is most commonly used for lubricant base stocks. 1-hexene, an example of an alpha-olefin Many poly-alpha-olefins have flexible alkyl branching groups on every other carbon of their polymer backbone chain. These alkyl groups, which can shape themselves in numerous conformations, make it very difficult for the polymer molecules to align themselves up side-by-side in an orderly way. This results in lower contact surface area between the molecules and decreases the intermolecular interactions between molecules.\\"Properties of Alkanes .\\" Retrieved on June 24, 2013 Therefore, many poly-alpha-olefins do not crystallize or solidify easily and are able to remain oily, viscous liquids even at lower temperatures. Low molecular weight poly-alpha-olefins are useful as synthetic lubricants such as synthetic motor oils for vehicles and can be used over a wide temperature range. Even polyethylenes copolymerized with a small amount of alpha-olefins (such as 1-hexene, 1-octene, or longer) are more flexible than simple straight-chain high-density polyethylene, which has no branching. The methyl branch groups on a polypropylene polymer are not long enough to make typical commercial polypropylene more flexible than polyethylene.  Uses  Polyolefins are used for blow moulded or rotationally moulded components, e.g. toys, for heat-shrink tubing used to mechanically and electrically protect connections in electronics, and for rash guards or undergarments for wetsuits. Polyolefin sheets or foams are used in a wide variety of packaging applications, sometimes in direct contact with food. Polyolefin elastomer POE is used as a main ingredient in the molded flexible foam technology such as in the fabrication of self skinned footwear (for example, Crocs shoes), seat cushions, arm rests, spa pillows, etc. Hydrogenated polyalphaolefin (PAO) is used as a radar coolant. Head makes polyolefin tennis racket strings. Polyolefin is also used in pharmaceutical and medical industry for HEPA filter certification‚Äîa PAO aerosol is passed through the filters and the air that exits is measured with an aerosol detector. Elastolefin is a fiber used in fabrics. IKEA's Better Shelter uses structural panels made out of polyolefin foam, stating, \\"They are tough and durable.\\". Piping systems for the conveyance of water, chemicals or gases are commonly produced in Polypropylene, and to a much greater extent Polyethylene. Piping systems in high-density Polyethylene (HDPE, PE100, PE80) are fast becoming the most commonly used drinking water, waste water and natural gas distribution piping systems in the world. Polyalphaolefin, commonly referred to as a synthetic hydrocarbon, is used in various types of air compressors and turbines including reciprocating, centrifugal, and rotary screw compressors where high pressures and temperatures can be an issue. These base fluids are the most widely used variety of synthetic oil blends mainly for their ability to maintain performance in spite of temperature extremes and their similarity to‚Äîbut improved performance over‚Äîmineral oil base fluids. Polyolefin waste can be converted into many different products, including pure polymers, naphtha, clean fuels, or monomers.

The shrine where Muthappan is worshipped is called Madappura.The Parassinikadavu Madappura is the most important. Practices in Muthappan temples are quite distinct from those in other Hindu temples of Kerala.The Worshipping system is according to Shakteyam where Panja-ma-kara are offered, sometimes including madyam (Toddy) and mamsam (flesh-fish). The main liturgy is a ritual enactment of Muthappan, performed daily at the Parassinikadavu temple. Most temples in Kerala do not allow non-Hindus to enter; Muthappan temples are said to be much more liberal in this regard. Muthappan is the principal deity in the ritualistic Theyyam dance (Muthappan Theyyam) performed in the famous Parassinikkadavu temple. The ritual performers of Muthappan Theyyam belong to the Vannan community of Kerala. The puja rituals and rites for Muthappan are performed by the Thiyyar community. Myths and legends Thiruvappana performing Vellaattom performing Muthappan is believed to be the personification of two divine figures -- Thiruvappana and Vellatom. The dual divine figures Thiruvappana and Vellatom are similar to those of the Theyyamkaliyattem of the northern Malabar region. Though Sree Muthappan is worshiped as a single deity, it actually represents an integrated or unified form of two gods: Vishnu (with a fish-shaped crown) and Shiva (with a crescent-shaped crown). Sri Muthappan's Theyyams are performed year-round whereas other Theyyams are seasonal (lasting October to May). =Muthappan stories= Parassinikkadavu Muthappan The traditional story of Parassinikkadavu Muthappan describes the background of the deity. The ruler (naduvazhi) Ancharamanaykkal Vazhunnavar of Eruveshi, Kannur was unhappy, as he had no child. His wife Padikutty Amma was a devotee of Lord Shiva. She made a sacrifice to Shiva for children. One day in her dream she saw the Lord. The very next day, while she was returning after a bath from a nearby river, she saw a pretty child lying on a rock nearby (which is worshipped even today). She took the child home and she and her husband brought Him up as their own son. The boy used to visit the jungle near their house (mana) for hunting with His bow and arrows. He would then take food to the poor and mingle with the backward communities like thiyya . As these acts were against the way of life, His parents earnestly requested Him to stop this practice, but the boy turned a deaf ear to their warnings. Ancharamanaykkal Vazhunavar became very disappointed. Ayyankara Vazhunavar decided to take the matters in his hand and admonished him. The boy revealed His divine form (Visvaroopam or Viswaroopa or Cosmic All-Pervading Form) to His parents. They then realized that the boy was not an ordinary child but God. They prostrated themselves in front of Him surrendering themselves to him. The moment he got out of his house, everything that came under Muthappan's vision burned and turned into ashes due to his sadness in leaving the house. His mother told him that he should not walk all the way destroying every creation in this world. Muthappan pierced his eyes so that nothing shall be disintegrated with his vision. Thiruvappana is depicted as blind because of this myth. He then started a journey from Ancharamanaykkal. The natural beauty of Kunnathoor detained Him. He was also attracted by the toddy of palm trees. Chandan (an illiterate toddy tapper) knew that his toddy was being stolen from his palm trees, so he decided to guard them. While he was keeping guard at night, he caught an old man stealing toddy from his palms. He got very angry and tried to shoot the man using his bow and arrows but fell unconscious before he could let loose even one arrow. Chandan's wife came searching for him. She cried brokenheartedly when she found him unconscious at the base of the tree. She saw an old man at the top of the palm tree and called out to Him as \\"Muthappan\\" (\\"muthappan\\" means grandfather in the local Malayalam language). She earnestly prayed to the God to save her husband. Before long, Chandan regained consciousness. She offered boiled grams, slices of coconut, burnt fish and toddy to the Muthappan. (Even today in Sree Muthappan temples the devotees are offered boiled grams and slices of coconut.) She sought a blessing from Him. Muthappan chose Kunnathoor as His residence at the request of Chandan. This is the famous Kunnathoor Padi. After spending some years at Kunnathoor, Sree Muthappan decided to look for a more favorable residence so that He could achieve His objective of His Avataram. He shot an arrow upward from Kunnathoor. The shaft reached Parassini where the famous Parassini Temple stands today. The arrow, when it was found, was glowing in the Theertha (sacred water) near the temple. The arrow was placed on the altar. Since then, Lord Sree Muthappan has been believed to reside at Parassinikkadavu. when thiruvappan traveled through the jungle he reached puralimala near Peravoor and met another muthappan, Thiruvappan called him cherukkan (meaning young boy in Malayalam) and accompanied him .this second muthappan is called as Vellattam.this theyyam carries round shaped throne made of hay. now thiruvappan is called as muththappan and the second muthappan is called as Vellatam =Sree Muthappan and dogs= Sree Muthappan is always accompanied by a dog. Dogs are considered sacred here and one can see dogs in large numbers in and around the temple. There are two carved bronze dogs at the entrance of the temple that are believed to symbolize the bodyguards of the God. When the Prasad is ready, it is first served to a dog that is always ready inside the temple complex. Local legends enhance the importance of dogs to Sree Muthappan, such as the story that follows: : A few years ago, temple authorities decided to reduce the number of dogs inside the temple; so they took some dogs and puppies away. From that very day, the performer of the Sree Muthappan Theyyam was unable to perform; it is said that the spirit of Sree Muthappan enters the performer's body for the duration of the ceremony. But he probably refused to enter the Theyyam performer's body because the dogs had been removed. Realizing their mistake, the dogs were brought back to the temple by the temple authorities. From that day onwards, Theyyam performances returned to normal. Festival procession Tradition requires that the annual Ulsavam festival of the Muthappan Temple at Parassinikkadavu start by a procession led by a male member of the Thayyil clan of Thayyil, Kannur from the family home to the main altar of the temple, where he offers a 'Pooja' (prayer) to the God. Local traditions in Kannur and Kasaragod Sree Muthappan Kalasam dance Several Muthappan temples are seen in Kannur and Kasaragod districts in Kerala and Coorg district in Karnataka and several temples are built by the migrated devotees in Coimbatore Bangalore, Mumbai, Ahemadabad, Delhi, Chennai, and also in Gulf countries. This signifies the popularity of the god in the minds of the people of North Malabar of Kerala and Coorg. Each Madappura has its own tradition. One interesting story relating to God Muthappan is about the Nileshwar Muthappan Madappura. The Sree Muthappan temple near National Highway No 17 in Nileshwar has a rich heritage. It conveys the philosophical, devotional and educational importance of Nileshwar. There is an interesting story regarding the construction of this Sree Muthappan Temple. An elder member of the Koroth family regularly visited the place now known as the Muthappan temple and drank madhu (toddy), the liquor fermented from coconut sap. He was a famous scholar and got the title Ezhuthachan for his commendable achievement as a teacher. Before drinking madhu, he poured a few drops of madhu on the nearby jackfruit tree as an offering for the God Muthappan. He regularly repeated the practice. Several years after the death of the scholar, the natives experienced serious problems and called upon an astrologer for assistance in finding out the cause. The astrologer concluded that as a result of the regular practice of giving madhu to God Muthappan, the God had started residing there. After the death of the scholar, he no longer got madhu and, in a fit of pique, began creating disturbances. The natives erected a Muthappan temple there. The Koroth family then got the right of Koymma [patron] of the temple. As a result of the formation of a committee and the work done by the members of the committee, the temple has developed as a famous centre of pilgrimage and hundreds of people visited it daily. There is a strong belief that the God will cure all diseases and will bestow prosperity on His devotees. The devotees get Payakutti from the temple, and it continues to develop as a great centre of pilgrimage like the Sree Muthappan temple at Parassinikadavu.

He was previously employed by Watford as the club's goalkeeping coach, before leaving the role in 2017 (claims that he was still working at the club until as recent as this week are false). He made 788 league appearances during his 25-year playing career, the final 11 years and 247 appearances of which were with Watford. Career Chamberlain started his career at Ipswich as a trainee, but didn't make a single appearance for the club, moving to Colchester in 1982. He spent 5 years at Layer Road before joining Everton for ¬£80,000. However, the then 23-year- old was unable to displace established Everton goalkeeper Neville Southall, and his only appearances in the 1987‚Äì88 season were during a loan spell at Tranmere. Having failed to make a single first team appearance for Everton in a year there, Chamberlain signed for Luton Town in the summer of 1988 whilst living in Northampton, where he ousted Les Sealey after Sealey had a poor game in the League Cup Final against Nottingham Forest. Chamberlain became first choice goalkeeper for the next four seasons. He did have a loan spell as understudy to Dave Beasant at Chelsea in the 1992‚Äì93, but didn't make any first team appearances. After signing for Sunderland in 1993, Chamberlain played regularly, making 90 league appearances over 3 years. He was part of the team that was promoted in 1995‚Äì96. Towards the end of the 1994‚Äì95 season, he was loaned to Liverpool as understudy to David James after previous deputy Michael Stensgaard suffered an off-the-field injury. Despite never playing a game for the Anfield side he collected a Football League Cup winner's medal as he was a non-playing substitute in the final. In the summer of 1996 he was allowed to join recently relegated Watford, who paid ¬£40,000 for him. He started off unable to get in the team, but finally played when first-choice goalkeeper and two-time Player of the Season Kevin Miller was sold to Crystal Palace in the 1997 close season. Now the first-choice goalkeeper, he was part of the Division Two Championship winning side in 1997‚Äì98, becoming Player of the Season in the process. He continued to play an important role as Watford gained promotion to the Premier League in 1999. In the playoff semi-final second leg against Birmingham City, his save denied Birmingham a winning goal, and won the match for Watford with a penalty shootout save from Chris Holland in sudden-death. He appeared at Wembley when Watford beat Bolton Wanderers 2‚Äì0 in the final. In Watford's Premiership campaign, Chamberlain started off with an injury, and had to wait six games before he could play again. Watford were relegated to Division One at the end of the season. The club signed Tottenham goalkeeper Espen Baardsen, and the two players competed for the starting position through the 2000‚Äì01 season. When Gianluca Vialli arrived as Watford manager at the end of the season, he selected Baardsen as his first choice, but Chamberlain returned to the side in October 2001 and kept his place, finishing as Player of the Season for the second time in five years. Under Ray Lewington, he was first-choice for the whole of the 2002‚Äì03 season. In 2003‚Äì04 he started as first-choice, but lost his place to Lenny Pidgeley for several months, before regaining his place towards the end of the campaign. Chamberlain, now 40, took the job of goalkeeping coach in the autumn of 2004. Chamberlain was given a testimonial by Watford. With Chamberlain in goal Watford lost to Premiership side Charlton Athletic 2‚Äì1. Various events were run throughout the season to celebrate Chamberlain's 10 years at the club. On 20 July 2006, after Watford's promotion to the Premier League via the Championship playoffs, he signed a new one-year contract keeping him as player at Vicarage Road until summer 2007 making him, at 42, the oldest Premier League player in 2006‚Äì07. On 13 May 2007, Chamberlain came on as a substitute to become one of the oldest Premier League players ever. On 19 May 2007 it was announced that Chamberlain would be retiring from playing and would concentrate on his coaching role at the club.

Largely self-educated, he served as a district attorney and member of the Arizona Territorial legislature before fulfilling his childhood ambition of joining the United States Senate. During his time in the Senate, Ashurst was chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs and the Judiciary Committee. Called \\"the longest U.S. theatrical engagement on record\\" by Time, Ashurst's political career was noted for a self-contradictory voting record, the use of a sesquipedalian vocabulary, and for a love of public speaking that earned him a reputation as one of the Senate's greatest orators. Among the sobriquets assigned to him were \\"the Dean of Inconsistency\\", \\"Five-Syllable Henry\\", and the \\"Silver-Tongued Sunbeam of the Painted Desert\\".Johnson, p. 111 Background Ashurst was born on September 13, 1874 in a covered wagon near Winnemucca, Humboldt County, Nevada to William and Sarah Ashurst, the second of ten children. His family moved to a ranch near Williams, Arizona when he was two, and he attended school in Flagstaff.Johnson, p. 114 At the age of ten he showed his ambition to be a Senator by writing \\"Henry Fountain Ashurst, U.S. Senator from Arizona\\" into a speller. After dropping out of school at the age of thirteen, he worked as a cowboy on his father's ranch. The boyhood home of Senator Ashurst near Prescott, Arizona At the age of nineteen, Ashurst was made the turnkey at the county jail in Flagstaff. While working at the jail, he developed an interest in the law by reading Blackstone's Commentaries. He later worked at a local lumber yard and studied law at night. In 1895, he worked as a lumberjack in the Los Angeles area and as a hod carrier in San Francisco. Following a brief return to Flagstaff, Ashurst enrolled at Stockton Business College (now Humphreys College), and graduated in 1896. Ashurst was admitted to the bar in 1897 and began a law practice in Williams. He completed his formal education with a year at the University of Michigan Law School beginning in 1903. In 1904, Ashurst married Elizabeth McEvoy Reno, an Irish- born widow with four children from her first marriage. She had moved to Flagstaff with her children to establish and manage a Weather Bureau station. She served as his political advisor for the rest of her life. Mrs. Ashurst died on November 1, 1939. Political career winged collar. Ashurst was elected to the Territorial House of Representatives in 1897. He was re-elected in 1899, and became the territory's youngest speaker. In 1902, he was elected to the Territorial Senate. He served as district attorney of Coconino County from 1905 to 1908, when he moved to Prescott, Arizona. In 1911, Ashurst presided over Arizona's constitutional convention. During the convention, he positioned himself for a U.S. Senate seat by avoiding the political fighting over various clauses in the constitution which damaged his rivals. With the admission of Arizona as a state in 1912, Ashurst was elected by the Arizona legislature as one of the state's two Senators, taking office on April 2 alongside Marcus A. Smith. He was easily re-elected in 1916 (by popular vote), and again in 1922, 1928, and 1934, serving for almost 29 years. He sought re- election in 1940 but was defeated in the Democratic primary. During his early years in the Senate, Ashurst was a supporter of the Woodrow Wilson administration and served as chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs between 1914 and 1919. The Democrats lost control of the Senate in 1918, and the presidency in 1920. Ashurst became a critic of Republican leaders and policy. The Democrats regained control in 1932, and Ashurst became chairman of the Judiciary Committee, serving until he left the Senate in 1941. Elizabeth McEvoy Reno Ashurst, wife of Senator Ashurst While in office, Ashurst focused on the interests of his constituents. He described this focus with the statement: \\"You (the people of Arizona) send me to Washington to represent you in the Senate. But you do not send me here because you are interested in grave questions of international policy. When I come back to Arizona, you never ask me questions about such policies; instead, you ask me, 'What about my pension?' or 'What about that job for my sons?'\\" While he routinely read correspondence from his home state, letters and telegrams from other states were normally ignored. During re-election campaigns, Ashurst employed one of his favorite quotations, \\"Praise undeserved is scandal in disguise.\\" To this end, his normal technique was to confess his faults and shortcomings to the voters while at the same time praising his opponent. During the 1934 elections he even told his constituents \\"If you don't send me back to the Senate, you'll have an old broken down politician on your hands, and you don't want that.\\" Ashurst was popular with Arizona voters; only in the Republican landslide year of 1928 was his margin less than 10%, and in 1934 he won by 46%. But after five terms in the Senate, Ashurst was defeated in the 1940 Democratic primary by Ernest McFarland. After his defeat, he gave a farewell address to the Senate. The Senate chamber was crowded with fellow Senators and also many U.S. Representatives. Ashurst reflected on the experience of defeat. He said, =Oratory and style= Ashurst had an affection for oration, as expressed by his statement, \\"I simply love speaking ‚Äì just as one may like maple syrup, Beethoven, Verdi, or Longfellow, Kipling, or Shakespeare ‚Äì one hardly knows why.\\" Johnson, p. 115 This combined with his courtly manners and impeccable attire earned Ashurst a reputation as the Chesterfield of the Senate. The New York Times said \\"Sheer eloquence is best personified in the present Senate by Ashurst of Arizona ‚Äì the debonair, balm-tongued chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Without losing one whit of his eloquence, or missing or misquoting a classical phrase, Ashurst can run the range from buffoonery to some of the most challenging remarks heard in Congress.\\" Ashurst's loquacious nature developed at an early age. After obtaining copies of several speeches by Senator Roscoe Conkling, a prominent 19th-century orator, Ashurst developed his speaking range and ability by thundering the words of other to the plants and rocks of the surrounding countryside. He also read a wide variety of classical and literary sources in an effort to learn as much quotable material as possible. As a result of these early efforts, by the time Ashurst joined Congress he had a well-developed speaker's voice and a wide collection of memorized quotations in both English and Latin. To this was added an interest in etymology that aided his vast vocabulary. Ashurst's most celebrated address came on June 15, 1935, when on the Senate floor he chastised Huey Long with a harangue which Time called \\"one of the most devastating speeches the chamber ever heard.\\" Other notable speeches by Ashurst dealt with Hugo Black's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1937, a proposed tariff on imported copper in 1932, and U.S. entry into World War I in 1917.Johnson, pp. 118‚Äì19 Senator Barry Goldwater was so fond of Ashurst's speeches that he compiled fourteen into the book Speeches of Henry Fountain Ashurst of Arizona. Ashurst responded to the book with \\"But, Barry, I made over 5,000 of them.\\"Johnson, p. 113 =\\"Dean of Inconsistency\\"= Through his legislative career, Ashurst maintained a need to be inconsistent in his political actions. He was also noted for an eccentric and flexible record on a variety of issues. Ashurst's pride in his variable record was such that he appointed himself \\"Dean of Inconsistency\\" and awarded Degrees of Inconsistency to other Senators who displayed irregular voting patterns. For his critics, he usually kept a supply of tracts on his person explaining the virtue and necessity of being inconsistent and awarded these to his detractors when he was criticized for his incongruous nature. An example of Ashurst's inconsistency is his behavior regarding the Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937. During the 1936 presidential election Ashurst denounced rumors that Franklin D. Roosevelt planned to reorganize the Supreme Court by \\"whittling, chiseling, indirection, circumlocution, periphrasis, and house-that-Jack-built tactics.\\" He furthermore labeled the rumored plan to pack the court with six new justices \\"a prelude to tyranny\\". Upon Roosevelt's introduction of the plan, Ashurst became the legislation's sponsor and asserted \\"I'm for it, it's a step in the right direction. It will be enacted into law immediately.\\" After the bill's introduction, Ashurst then delayed hearings in the Judiciary Committee, saying \\"No haste, no hurry, no waste, no worry ‚Äì that is the motto of this committee.\\" As a result of his delaying efforts, the bill was held in committee for 165 days, and opponents of the bill credited Ashurst as instrumental in its defeat. Upon receiving a constituent's congratulatory message for his stand on the bill, Ashurst replied \\"Dear Madame: Which stand?\\" Other examples of Ashurst switching positions include: * Advocacy of Prohibition, followed by a vote to allow 3.2% beer. * Voting both for and against the 18th (Prohibition) Amendment. * His four votes on veteran's bonuses, two for and two against, which generated the comment \\"What of it? At least I was fifty per cent right, which is a pretty good record for a politician.\\" Even his speaking skills could contribute to his inconsistency, as was the case on January 21, 1914. Ashurst gave a three-hour speech in support of the Nineteenth Amendment (for women's suffrage), which exhausted the time available to vote on it, and delayed its passage. After office During his farewell speech in the Senate, Ashurst indicated his intention to retire to Arizona, saying, \\"When you are here worrying about patronage, worrying about committee assignments, worrying about bills, I shall possibly be enjoying the ecstasy of the starry stillness of an Arizona desert night, or enjoying the scarlet glory of her blossoming cactus, and possibly I may be wandering through the Petrified Forest in Arizona.\\" But instead of going home, he accepted a position on the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals, serving from April 8, 1941 until his retirement on February 28, 1943. After his retirement, Ashurst lived in Washington, D.C., devoting his time to classical poetry and public speaking. He also made several public appearances. Ashurst was a contestant on the television game show The $64,000 Question; he missed a question, but received a Cadillac car as a consolation prize. He also made a cameo appearance in the film Advise and Consent, in the role of \\"Senator McCafferty\\". Ashurst suffered a stroke on May 15, 1962 and was admitted to Georgetown University Hospital where he died on May 31, 1962. Ashurst kept a journal from June 1910 to July 27, 1937 which contains pen portraits of several fellow Senators. The journal was edited by George F. Sparks and published in 1962 under the title A Many Colored Toga.

It enables the operator to drill or cut work at exact intervals around a fixed (usually horizontal or vertical) axis. Some rotary tables allow the use of index plates for indexing operations, and some can also be fitted with dividing plates that enable regular work positioning at divisions for which indexing plates are not available. A rotary fixture used in this fashion is more appropriately called a dividing head (indexing head). Construction The table shown is a manually operated type. Powered tables under the control of CNC machines are now available, and provide a fourth axis to CNC milling machines. Rotary tables are made with a solid base, which has provision for clamping onto another table or fixture. The actual table is a precision-machined disc to which the work piece is clamped (T slots are generally provided for this purpose). This disc can rotate freely, for indexing, or under the control of a worm (handwheel), with the worm wheel portion being made part of the actual table. High precision tables are driven by backlash compensating duplex worms. The ratio between worm and table is generally 40:1, 72:1 or 90:1 but may be any ratio that can be easily divided exactly into 360¬∞. This is for ease of use when indexing plates are available. A graduated dial and, often, a vernier scale enable the operator to position the table, and thus the work affixed to it with great accuracy. A through hole is usually machined into the table. Most commonly, this hole is machined to admit a Morse taper center or fixture. Use Rotary tables are most commonly mounted \\"flat\\", with the table rotating around a vertical axis, in the same plane as the cutter of a vertical milling machine. An alternate setup is to mount the rotary table on its end (or mount it \\"flat\\" on a 90¬∞ angle plate), so that it rotates about a horizontal axis. In this configuration a tailstock can also be used, thus holding the workpiece \\"between centers.\\" With the table mounted on a secondary table, the workpiece is accurately centered on the rotary table's axis, which in turn is centered on the cutting tool's axis. All three axes are thus coaxial. From this point, the secondary table can be offset in either the X or Y direction to set the cutter the desired distance from the workpiece's center. This allows concentric machining operations on the workpiece. Placing the workpiece eccentrically a set distance from the center permits more complex curves to be cut. As with other setups on a vertical mill, the milling operation can be either drilling a series of concentric, and possibly equidistant holes, or face or end milling either circular or semicircular shapes and contours. A rotary table can be used: * To machine spanner flats on a bolt * To drill equidistant holes on a circular flange * To cut a round piece with a protruding tang * To create large- diameter holes, via milling in a circular toolpath, on small milling machines that don't have the power to drive large twist drills (>0.500\\"/>13 mm) * To mill helixes * To cut complex curves (with proper setup) * to cut straight lines at any angle * to cut arcs * with the addition of a compound table on top of the rotary table, the user can move the center of rotation to anywhere on the part being cut. This enables an arc to be cut at any place on the part. * to cut circular pieces Additionally, if converted to stepper motor operation, with a CNC milling machine and a tailstock, a rotary table allows many parts to be made on a mill that otherwise would require a lathe. Applications Rotary tables have many applications, including being used in the manufacture and inspection process of important elements in aerospace, automation and scientific industries. The use of rotary tables stretches as far as the film and animation industry, being used to obtain accuracy and precision in filming and photography.

Synopsis The series was set in the busy casualty department of a major fictional Melbourne hospital, and is notable for being one of the first-ever dramas shown on Australian television.Albert Moran, Moran's Guide to Australian TV Series, AFTRS 1993 p 160-161 Cast Australian TV drama was relatively rare at the time. Made by Melbourne's GTV-9 in co-operation with the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and based on Britain's Emergency Ward 10, Emergency starred Brian James as Dr. Geoffrey Thompson, Syd Conabere as orderly George Rogers, and Judith Godden as Nurse Jill Adamson. Moira Carleton also featured as Matron Evans. Production The series was produced primarily in the GTV-9 studio, with brief (usually pre-credit) exterior sequences shot on 35mm film by newsreel cameramen. The episodes were not broadcast live, but were kinescoped to meet programming requirements, and facilitate later screening in Sydney. The series' premise was simple: a basic dramatic exploration of cases passing through the Casualty ward. Scripts were written by GTV staffers Roland Strong (series producer) and Denzil Howson (series director) under pseudonyms. Sponsorship came from British Petroleum, and a contract was signed for 52 half-hour episodes. The series debuted on GTV-9 on 16 February 1959, and on Sydney's ATN-7 a week later. Critics initially appeared fairly neutral, however a highly negative article on the series in a Sydney newspaper caused BP to withdraw sponsorship 16 weeks into the series run. Faced with having to carry the production expenses alone, GTV-9 discontinued production, with the final episode airing in Melbourne on 1 June 1959. Patricia Kennedy called it \\"exhausting but exciting.\\" Reception The Australian Women's Weekly called it \\"shudderingly bad.\\" Cast roles after series Following the series demise, the actors went onto other roles Brian James went on to lead roles in the ABC serial Stormy Petrel in 1960, and ATN-7's period drama Jonah in 1962, later appearing as George Tippit in the drama serial \\"Skyways\\" (1979‚Äì81), before becoming best known for his trole in cult series Prisoner Moira Carleton appeared in guest roles in most of the Australian TV dramas on the 1960s and 1970s, with a permanent role as Olive Turner on Bellbird, whilst Syd Conabere starred in serial Sons and Daughters.

It has a number of shops, pubs and other businesses, a Church of St Andrews, as well as Methodist and Baptist churches. In the northern part of the Parish an industrial estate on the former Swanwick Colliery site incorporates the Thornton's Confectionery factory along with other businesses. There is also a Christian conference centre, the largest in the UK. Now largely urbanized, the Parish still has some remaining agricultural land to the north and west.  History The name Swanwick is derived from the Old English \\"Swana\\" meaning herdsmen, and \\"wic\\" meaning a group of buildings.Johnson, Reginald, 1968, p156. 'A History of Alfreton'. The settlement is thought to have begun in the vicinity of the farm above The Hayes (meaning \\"enclosure\\"), on which a number of ancient footpath routes converge. It is first mentioned in 1304 in Sir Thomas Chaworth's grants to Beauchief Abbey. Sir Thomas was the Lord of the Manor of Alfreton, which encompassed Swanwick. The area was exploited for coal from early times, first with small pits in the locality known as The Delves (meaning 'diggings') and later with a major colliery in the north of the parish, which closed in the 1960s. Several families figure highly in Swanwick's long history. The Turners, beginning with George Turner in 1620, owned the local mineral rights and became coal magnates, until the death of Charles Turner in 1736. John Turner built Swanwick Hall around 1690. Elizabeth Turner had a school built in 1740 to provide education for 20 children from poor families. The school house is now a private residence. The other most significant family was the Woods, who occupied the original Swanwick Hall ('The Old Hall') in what is known as Wood's Yard. It was a substantial yeoman's residence of 1678, as evidenced by a datestone high up on the dormer gables, along Derbyshire County Council having bought it two years earlier after the death of Hugo Wood. Swanwick Hayes - now the Hayes Conference Centre - was constructed in the 1850s as the home of Mr Fitzherbert Wright. In the early 1900s, it was converted into a conference centre, and operates as such to this day. The Hayes gained notoriety during World War II, when it served as a prisoner of war camp for both German and Italian prisoners. Franz von Werra, a Luftwaffe officer, escaped from here; he was recaptured at nearby RAF Hucknall, while trying to steal an aircraft. A film entitled The One That Got Away, and starring Hardy Kr√ºger, was made of his exploits.  St Andrew's Church  St. Andrew's Church The History of St Andrew's In 1856 the Revd John Wood gave land for a church to be built in Swanwick, at which time the village's industries consisted of coal mining, farming, the Butterley ironworks, framework knitting, shoemaking and a newly established silk stocking maker.with the crest adopted by the Wood family. The Woods succeeded the Turners as owners of most of the local mineral rights, and Hugo Wood later moved into the newer Hall with his family; a painting of his children, by Joseph Wright of Derby, used to hang in its dining room. The Hall opened as a secondary school in 1922, the With the aid of a donation of ¬£3,230 from Francis Wright the building was completed in 1859 with a nave of five bays, north and south aisles, north porch and bell turret over the west gable. The pointed arches on both sides of the nave and in the chancel imply that the architect, Benjamin Wilson, had Early English architecture in mind when he designed the building. The Church celebrated its 150th Anniversary on Sunday 26 September 2010. The Bishop of Derby, the Rt Revd Dr. Alastair Redfern, presided at a celebratory service. The anniversary was also marked by the publishing of \\"Swanwick 1304-2010 - the Story of our Village\\" which sold over 600 copies. The church has been important in village life for over one and a half centuries and continues to make important contribution to the community. Many have been christened and married here and many have worshipped here in the past and there is still a vibrant congregation today with two or more services every Sunday. See the church website for further details and a downloadable history http://swanwick-pentrich-cofe.btck.co.uk/  Schools  The village has four schools: Swanwick Hall,Swanwick Hall School Swanwick Primary School, Swanwick Pre-School and Swanwick School & Sports College. The Alfreton Learning Community Talent Contest On 27 March 2008, Swanwick Hall hosted The Alfreton Learning Community Talent Contest (later renamed as The Contest for 2009 editions and onwards). The neighbouring schools of Tibshelf Community and Alfreton Park participated as well as the host school. The winner was Tibshelf Community School, who will host the 2009 edition of The Contest. This contest was founded by a student of Swanwick Hall.

It was built to allow for easy dismantling when the site is redeveloped as part of a major commercial development when Punggol New Town is more developed. The bus interchange was officially opened on 30 November 2003. History Before the opening of the Punggol Bus Interchange, there is only one bus terminal at Punggol, which is the Punggol Road End Bus Terminal, which has been existed since the 1980s and is home to Bus Services 82 and 83. Bus Service 83 was shortened to Hougang Central Bus Interchange, and renumbered service 147 in June 1992, and Bus Service 147 was amended via Stamford Road, Selegie Road and Little India area skipping Victoria Street and Lavender Street. Bus Service 82 was converted to a loop service from Serangoon to Punggol Road End with the opening of the North East line, as the actual route duplicated most of Bus Services 100 and 107, before it was amended to terminate at the interchange and loop at Serangoon Central, while it no longer serves Punggol Point. With the amendment, a new Bus Service 84 was introduced to cover the lost sectors of Bus Service 82 which originally served Punggol Point. =Opening= Punggol Bus Interchange in 2006 The SGD $1.9-million temporary Punggol Bus Interchange took 10 months to construct and was officially opened on 30 November 2003 by Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC Teo Chee Hean. Before the opening of the interchange, Punggol's only bus terminal was the Punggol Road End Bus Terminal which had only two Bus Services, 82 and 83. The bus terminal was closed and converted into a bus stop when the interchange started operations. =Expansion= In April 2015, LTA announced that the Punggol Temporary Bus Interchange will be expanded from its current to to cater for 13 new bus spaces on top of the current 38. New boarding berths and an expanded concourse will be added once the construction is complete. Expansion works started in the third quarter of 2015 and were completed on 1 October 2017. Services With the opening of the interchange, Bus Service 83, plying between Sengkang and Punggol, was amended to terminate here, instead of the pair of bus-stops below Punggol. Bus Service 3 was extended from its original looping point at Pasir Ris Street 71 to provide direct links between Punggol and the new towns of Pasir Ris and Tampines, while Bus Service 62 and Bus Service 136 were extended from the former Hougang South Bus Interchange and Upper Serangoon Road to this interchange respectively. As time went by, new services, Bus Services 34, 43, and 85 were introduced to link Punggol to Singapore Changi Airport, Upper East Coast Bus Terminal and Yishun Bus Interchange respectively. Bus Service Enhancement Programme In 2015, LTA introduced the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP) to improve commuting time and planned to roll out 1,000 buses to add more bus services to improve connectivity. Punggol Bus Interchange had its first service upgrade on 21 October 2012, under the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP), Bus Service 119 was extended to terminate at Punggol Bus Interchange instead of terminating at Sengkang Bus Interchange, calling at an additional four pairs of bus stops. This was followed by the introduction of Bus Service 50 on 16 December that year between Punggol and Bishan Bus Interchange. Two more bus services, Bus Service 117, which piles between Punggol and Sembawang Bus Interchange, and Bus Service 118, which plies between Punggol and Changi Business Park Bus Terminal,were introduced on 20 December 2015. =New Feeder Services= On 17 August 2014, under the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP), the bus interchange introduced its first Feeder Bus Service 386. The service plies along Punggol North, looping at Edgefield Plains. Bus Services 382G/382W, which plies along Punggol West, looping at Sumang Link, was introduced on 3 January 2016. On 12 March 2017, Bus Service 381 was rolled out to directly connect Punggol East with Waterway Point, Punggol Plaza and schools in the area. Bus Contracting Model Under the new bus contracting model, all the bus routes were split into 3 route packages: Bus Service 50 under Bishan-Toa Payoh, Bus Service 117 under Sengkang-Hougang and the rest under Loyang Bus Package. On 15 April 2015, the Loyang Bus Package was put up for tender by the Land Transport Authority. On 23 November that year, the tender was awarded to Go-Ahead Singapore Pte Ltd and as a result, Go-Ahead Singapore Pte Ltd took over the operation and management of this interchange and all bus services serving it, excluding Bus Services 50 and 117. In order to ensure a smooth transition with minimal inconvenience to commuters, the 25 bus services in the contract were transferred in two tranches. The first tranche involved the transfer of Punggol Bus Interchange and the Bus Services 3/3A, 34/34A, 43/43M, 62/62A, 82, 83, 84, 85, 118, 119, 136, 382G/382W and 386 to Go-Ahead Singapore Pte Ltd, while the second tranche involved the transfer of Pasir Ris Bus Interchange, Changi Village Bus Terminal and the remaining: Bus Services 2, 6, 12, 15/15A, 17/17A, 36/36A/36B, 354, 358, 359, 403 and 518/518A. Go-Ahead Singapore Pte Ltd took over Punggol Bus Interchange from 4 September 2016 onwards, with the first bus, on Bus Service 82, leaving the interchange at 5.15am. This marked the debut of the company in Singapore.

When the school brass band leaves to perform at a baseball game without their bento lunches, Tomoko and the other girls persuade their math teacher, Mr. Ozawa, to let them deliver the lunches. On the train, the girls fall asleep and miss their stop. They walk back to deliver the lunches to the band, but they have spoiled in the summer heat, and all but their cymbal player, Nakamura, becomes sick. Nakamura holds an audition for band replacements to play at an upcoming baseball game. Only three girls audition: two former members of a punk band, and the shy Sekiguchi. Nakamura confronts the other girls, threatening to turn them in for the food poisoning in if they do not join. The girls have no musical experience and clown around with their instruments, except for Sekiguchi. As they are several members short of a brass band, Nakamura decides to turn the group into a big band and perform swing jazz. The girls train hard for the performance. Sekiguchi's talent inspires the others, and they come to enjoy playing. However, on the day before the game, just as the girls have become confident, the brass band members recover and the girls are devastated. As the new school year begins, Tomoko buys a saxophone and discovers Nakamura playing his keyboard. The members of the swing band gather at school and decide to buy their own instruments. The girls get supermarket jobs to earn money, but Tomoko and several others lose their wages when a cooking demonstration gets out of hand, triggering the store's fire sprinkler system. The remaining girls spend a day picking matsutake mushrooms, but are attacked by a boar; they kill it and claim reward money, as the boar had been destroying crops. With the money, the girls buy cheap damaged instruments, and the two rockers convince their ex- boyfriends, who operate a wrecking yard, to repair them. The group, now dubbed Swing Girls, play their first public show; the performance goes badly, but Sekiguchi is given advice by an anonymous jazz fan. When the group approach him, he runs away. They chase him to his home and discover that he is Mr. Ozawa, who possesses an extensive collection of jazz records. Assuming he is an expert saxophonist player, they convince him to lead the band. The band's skills improve and they record an audition tape for a music festival. They leave Tomoko in charge of the tape, but she sends it too late and the band is rejected. Tomoko is too embarrassed to tell the others. Nakamura discovers that Mr. Ozawa is not really a professional saxophonist, and he quits, embarrassed. On the train to the music festival, Tomoko confesses that the band have no place at the festival, and the train is halted by snow. However, their teacher Ms. Itami informs them that another band has cancelled due to the snow and rushes them to the festival by bus. The Swing Girls rush onstage just in time and perform their set, wowing the crowd.

Together with Shugni, it is classified in a Shugni-Yazgulami subgroup of the areal group of Pamir languages. Virtually all speakers are bilingual in the Tajik language. The Yazgulyam people are an exception among the speakers of Pamir languages in that they do not adhere to Ismailism.  Dialects  The Yazgulami language consists of two dialects: one of these is spoken higher in the mountains, the other lower. The differences are not significant and are limited to the vocabulary. Differences in the vocabulary are also detectable between the languages used in different villages in the lower mountains. The extinct Vanji language (also Van≈æi) is closely related to Yazgulami. Other languages spoken in the Pamirs differ greatly from the Yazgulami language. The disparities are the largest in the vocabulary.  History  The language was first recorded by Russian traveller G. Arandarenko in 1889, listing 34 Yazgulami words recorded in 1882. The language was described in greater detail by French linguist Robert Gauthiot in Notes sur le yazggoulami, dialecte iranien des Confins du Pamir (1916). In 1954 the Yazgulami living on the mountain slopes were resettled, about 20% of them forcibly, to the Vakhsh valley, where they live dispersed among the Tajiks, Uzbeks, Russians and other ethnic groups. Phonology The phonology of the Yazgulyam language differs from the basic \\"Shugni-Roshani\\" type in its system of dorsal consonants: in addition to the velar and uvular stops g, k, q and fricatives xÃå, Œ≥Ãå, x, Œ≥,, Yazgulami has a palatalised and a labialised series, transcribed as ·∏±, «µ (palatalised velars), k¬∞ g¬∞ xÃå¬∞ (labialised velars, there is no labialised velar voiced fricative) and q¬∞ x¬∞ Œ≥¬∞ (labialised uvulars). A significant number of labialised consonants etymologically correspond to Proto-Iranian *Cv or *Cu, e.g. xÃå¬∞arg < *hvaharƒÅ- \\"sister\\", while others are unrelated to Proto- Iranian v, e.g. sk¬∞on < skana- \\"puppy\\". This threefold system of articulation of dorsals has been compared typologically to the three reconstructed rows of dorsals in the Proto-Indo-European language. Morphology In the past tense, Yazgulyam has tripartite marking‚Äîone of the very few languages in the world to have it at all. This means that the subject of an intransitive sentence is treated differently from both the subject and the object of a transitive sentence.Dixon, R.M.W. (1994). Ergativity.

Personal life  Seastrand was born Andrea Heidi Ciszek in Chicago. She graduated from DePaul University in 1963 with a B.A. in education, and then moved to Salinas, California to find work as an elementary school teacher. In 1965, she married Eric Seastrand, a stockbroker, and the couple had two children named Kurt and Heidi.  Political career  From 1982 to 1990, when her husband served in the California State Assembly as a Republican, Seastrand joined the California Federation of Republican Women, later becoming its president. In 1990, Eric Seastrand died of cancer, and Andrea won a special election to succeed him, receiving 65 per cent of the vote. She remained a member of assembly for the next four years, serving on the education committee and as assistant minority leader. Seastrand was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994, narrowly defeating Theology professor Walter Capps and succeeding fellow Republican Michael Huffington. Considered one of the more conservative members of the 104th Congress, she faced Capps again in 1996 and was defeated.  Post-political work  In 1997, after her departure from Congress, Seastrand founded the California Space and Technology Alliance‚Äîa private nonprofit focused on promoting California's participation in space ventures‚Äîwhich later became the California Space Authority. She remained executive director of the organization from its creation until its dissolution in 2011.

Academic career Before entering politics, Capps taught for more than thirty years at the University of California, Santa Barbara. As a Professor in the Religious Studies department he helped define the field, and cataloged the growth and changes in his 1995 book Religious Studies: The Making of a Discipline. An anti-war activist during the 1960s, he later initiated a nationally renowned course titled \\"Religion and the Impact of Vietnam\\" in 1979.

While driving home from a campaign event during the summer of 1996, Capps' vehicle was struck by a drunk supporter. Capps was seriously injured and was unable to actively campaign until the final few weeks of the race. During his absence from the campaign, his opponent, graciously, didn't make his failing health an issue. Ultimately, despite his absence from the campaign trail, Capps won, even as Bob Dole edged Bill Clinton in the district. On October 28, 1997, Capps collapsed after suffering a heart attack at Dulles International Airport, and was pronounced dead at a hospital in Reston, Virginia. Jesse Jackson attended his funeral. Capps was succeeded by his widow, Lois Capps, who won in a special election in the spring of 1998. Subsequent legislation by Congresswoman Capps has mandated the presence of automated external defibrillators in public places.

The global minimum f_{min}=0 is located at (x,y)=(1,1). MCS identifies a position with f\\\\approx 0.002 within 21 function evaluations. After additional 21 evaluations the optimal value is not improved and the algorithm terminates. Observe dense clustering of samples around potential minima - this effect can be reduced significantly by employing local searches appropriately. Multilevel Coordinate Search (MCS) is an efficient algorithm for bound constrained global optimization using function values only. To do so, the n-dimensional search space is represented by a set of non-intersecting hypercubes (boxes). The boxes are then iteratively split along an axis plane according to the value of the function at a representative point of the box (and its neighbours) and the box's size. These two splitting criteria combine to form a global search by splitting large boxes and a local search by splitting areas for which the function value is good. Additionally, a local search combining a (multi-dimensional) quadratic interpolant of the function and line searches can be used to augment performance of the algorithm (MCS with local search); in this case the plain MCS is used to provide the starting (initial) points. The information provided by local searches (namely local minima of the objective function) is then fed back to the optimizer and influences the splitting criteria, resulting in reduced sample clustering around local minima and faster convergence. Simplified workflow The basic workflow is presented in figure 1. Generally, each step can be characterized by three stages: # Identify a potential candidate for splitting (magenta, thick). # Identify the optimal splitting direction and the expected optimal position of splitting points (green). # Evaluate the objective function at splitting points not considered previously. Generate new boxes (magenta, thin) based on the values of the objective function at splitting (green) points. At every step at least one splitting point (yellow) is a known function sample (red) hence the objective is never evaluated there again. In order to determine if a box will be split two separate splitting criteria are used. The first one, splitting by rank, ensures that large boxes that have not been split too often will be split eventually. If it applies then the splitting point can be determined a priori. The second one, splitting by expected gain, employs a local one-dimensional quadratic model (surrogate) along a single coordinate. In this case the splitting point is defined as the minimum of the surrogate and the box is split only if the interpolant value there is lower than the current best sampled function value. Convergence The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the global minimum in the long run (i.e. when the number of function evaluations and the search depth are arbitrarily large) if the objective function is continuous in the neighbourhood of the global minimizer. This follows from the fact that any box will become arbitrarily small eventually, hence the spacing between samples tends to zero as the number of function evaluations tends to infinity. Recursive implementation MCS was designed to be implemented in an efficient recursive way with the aid of trees. With this approach the amount of memory required is independent of problem dimensionality since the sampling points are not stored explicitly. Instead, just a single coordinate of each sample is saved and the remaining coordinates can be recovered by tracing the history of a box back to the root (initial box). This method was suggested by the authors and used in their original implementation. When implemented carefully this also allows for avoiding repeated function evaluations. More precisely, if a sampling point is placed along the boundary of two adjacent boxes then this information can often be extracted through backtracing the point's history for a small number of steps. Consequently, new subboxes can be generated without evaluating the (potentially expensive) objective function. This scenario is visualised in figure 1 whenever a green (but not yellow) and a red point coincide e.g. when the box with corners around (-0.5,0.5) and (1.0,3.5) is split.

Jacob Jansz. Quaeckernaeck (or Quackernaeck or Kwakernaak) (ca. 1543 - 21 September 1606) was a native of Rotterdam and one of the first Dutchmen in Japan, and he was a navigator and later the captain (after the death of the previous captain in the Strait of Magellan) of the Dutch ship De Liefde, which was stranded in Japan in 1600. Some of his shipmates were Melchior van Santvoort, Jan Joosten and William Adams. De Liefde (the Love, sometimes translated as the Charity) departed Rotterdam in 1598, on a trading voyage that was a five ship expedition to the East Indies. After making it through the Strait of Magellan, they became separated, but later rejoined the Hoop (Hope) off the coast of Chile, where some of the crew and captains of both vessels lost their lives in an encounter with natives. They decide to leave hostile Spanish waters and sell their woolen cloth cargo in Japan rather than in the warmer Moluccas. The two ships encountered a storm and Hoop was lost. With a decimated and sick crew (only 24 were still alive, and several were dying) the damaged De Liefde made landfall off Bungo (present-day Usuki) on the coast of Ky≈´sh≈´ in April 1600. Portuguese Jesuit missionary priests claimed that the ship was a pirate vessel and that the crew should be executed. The ship was seized on orders of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the daimy≈ç of Edo (Tokyo) and the future sh≈çgun, and later the crew was ordered to sail her to Sakai (near Osaka) and then on to Edo. Some of them were received by Tokugawa Ieyasu, who questioned them at length on European politics, wars and foreign affairs. The crew eventually went separate ways when some decided they should split the money provided as compensation for their losses of the ship and cargo.Letters Written by the English Residents in Japan, 1611-1623, with Other Documents on the English Trading Settlement in Japan in the Seventeenth Century, N.

Theatre first came to Greenwich at the beginning of the 19th century during the famous Eastertide Greenwich Fair at which the Richardson travelling theatre annually performed. The current Greenwich Theatre is the heir to two former traditions. It stands on the site of the Rose and Crown Music Hall built in 1855 on Crooms Hill at the junction with Nevada Street. But it takes its name from the New Greenwich Theatre built in 1864 by Sefton Parry on London Street, opposite what was then the terminus of the London and Greenwich Railway.The Era 29 May 1864, p 10 New Greenwich Theatre  Richardson's travelling theatre  At the beginning of the 19th century, Richardson's travelling theatre made its annual tented appearance during the famous Eastertide Greenwich Fair. In Sketches by Boz, Charles Dickens reminisced enthusiastically, ‚Äúyou have a melodrama (with three murders and a ghost), a pantomime, a comic song, an overture, and some incidental music, all done in five-and-twenty minutes.‚Äù In 1842, The Era reported that performances at Richardson's theatre attracted upwards of 15,000 people. The Fair was closed down in 1853 ‚Äúin consequence of the drunkenness and debauchery (it) occasioned, and the numerous convictions of pickpockets that took place before the police magistrates‚Äù. On at least two subsequent occasions, the Greenwich Theatre celebrated its Richardson heritage. In April 1868 at Eleanor Bufton's first night as manager, she recited a poem written for the occasion, weaving the Richardson saga around her own. Five years later, at Easter 1873, lessee and manager Mr J. A. Cave reproduced Richardson's performances as closely as possible and even brought back Paul Herring, veteran clown of the 1820s Fair.The Era, 1873 There are also two later newspaper references to a theatre in Greenwich that was burnt down around 1835 but no other details are given.South Eastern Gazette, 24 May 1864 p. 5 Opening of a New TheatreLondon Daily News, 26 May 1864 p. 6 The New Greenwich Theatre.  Greenwich Theatre 1864‚Äì1911  = Sefton Parry = After extensive experience as actor/comedian travelling the world and manager/theatre builder in South Africa, Sefton Parry built his first English theatre on a vacant site on London Street (now Greenwich High Road) at Greenwich. It opened in May 1864 with seating for 1000 people. He promised that the style of performance would be similar to that of the old Adelphi, but there would be improvements to suit contemporary taste that made the most of the latest skills and recent inventions. His aim was to attract the highest class of residents by superior pieces carefully acted by a thoroughly efficient company. His first recruits were Bessie Foote from the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, Eliza Hamilton from the Theatre Royal, Sadler's Wells, Sallie Turner eldest daughter of Henry Jameson Turner of the Royal Strand, Josephine Ruth from the Theatre Royal, Portsmouth, and Marion Foote; also Messrs. Frank Barsby from the Theatre Royal, Brighton, W. Foote from the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh), E. Danvers from the Royal Strand Theatre, and Mr Westland. On opening night The Era described it as 'perhaps the most elegant Theatre within twenty miles of London'The Era, 29 May 1864, p.10 New Greenwich Theatre Initially christened the New Greenwich Theatre, it subsequently acquired several new names including Theatre Royal, New Prince of Wales‚Äôs Theatre, Morton's Theatre and Carlton Theatre. Even so, it continued to be known as the Greenwich Theatre, and was still recorded as such in 1911 before becoming a cinema. The alternative name Theatre Royal, Greenwich emerged as early as 1865 and was used in The Era as late as December 1902. It remained in Parry's ownership until his death in December 1887 when ownership was transferred to the Sefton Parry Trust.The Hull Daily Mail, February 27, 1895,The Royal Changes Hands It was sold by auction as the 'Greenwich Theatre' in 1909.The Era 1909 = The next managers = Parry was soon involved in building further theatres in London. By September 1866, William Sydney (who also managed theatres in Richmond, Norwich & Stockton) had become the lessee and manager, and Herbert Masson his Musical Director. W. J. Hurlstone, who had been Acting Manager for Parry, was re-engaged in the same role.The Era, 15 September 1866 By 1867 the lessee was Mr Mowbray, and the manageress, Miss Fanny Hazlewood. Her agent was Henry Jameson Turner whose agency had at one time acted for Parry.The Era, various in 1867 At the end of Fanny Hazlewood's short tenure before she went to America there were serious issues of non- payment of rent and wages. = Swanborough family = The Swanborough family, who managed the Royal Strand Theatre from 1858 to 1883, popular for its burlesque, were the next lessees of the Greenwich Theatre.‚ÄòLost London Playhouses‚Äô, The Stage, 28 June 1923, p. 21. On 11 April 1868, the theatre opened for the season under the new management of the Welsh actress, Miss Eleanor Bufton (Mrs Arthur Swanborough) . The house had been entirely renovated and redecorated. Eleanor Bufton recited a poem in typical burlesque style, written for her opening night, that recalled the days of Richardson‚Äôs travelling theatre at the Greenwich Fair and included the lines: No matter what the rival shows might be, Richardson's held, o'er all, supremacy; Asserting o'er men's minds the Drama's pow'r With play and pantomime, four times an hour! The Drama, then, in tent of canvas pent, Though, in low booth, upheld its high in-tent! And, 'midst the outside Fair's discordant din, It cried \\"Walk up! - just going to begin. The poem also made topical allusions to John Stuart Mill and the women's suffrage movement.The Era, 19 April 1868, ¬© 2016 Findmypast Newspaper Archive Limited By February 1871, the management had been taken on by Frederick Belton. In August of that year, Eleanor Bufton was involved in a serious railway accident which affected her memory and interfered with her career. = Continuity and decline = In 1872 Mr J A Cave took out a long lease from Sefton Parry and made considerable alterations and improvements before his opening night. He promised that admission prices would be materially reduced without in any way reducing the quality of the entertainment. He said that twenty years of past successes had proved the value of full houses at moderate prices. Additionally, for those who could afford higher prices, ample accommodation would be provided. After Cave's time the theatre gradually sank to a lower and lower level and \\"a once prosperous place was reduced to utter ruin by the incompetence and mismanagement of the speculators\\".The Era, 23 August 1884 p.10 The New Prince of Wales's Those speculating managers included Mr Robertson, Mr H C Sidney, Mrs W Lovegrove & Mr George Villiers, and Mr D M'Intosh. In the autumn of 1879 J Aubrey, then Sole Lessee and Manager, soon after presenting his Christmas pantomime was made bankrupt. = William Morton = In 1884, Parry identified William Morton as the man to take over his ruined theatre. Morton's first theatrical success had been to launch and sustain the careers of the renowned magicians Maskelyne and Cooke at the Egyptian Hall and was also currently managing the thousand-seater New Cross Public Hall. In May that year, Morton took on the lease of the Greenwich Theatre with an option to buy at a specified date and price. Once reconstructed and redecorated, Morton proposed to rename as the New Prince of Wales's Theatre. He intended, if possible, to meet the growing demand for good dramatic performances in south-east London. Morton devoted sixteen years to running the Greenwich Theatre, investing his own money, and rightly claimed that by engaging some of the best of the touring companies such as D‚ÄôOyly Carte, he turned a derelict property into something that mattered. He was often called 'the Greenwich Morton' to distinguish him from others of the same name. He boasted that Greenwich was the only temperance theatre in the whole of London. By 1892, he was involved in many other theatres around the country, including acting as the Sefton Parry Trust's representative and personal agent for all their properties.The Era, March 12, 1892 p.14 advertisement: W. Morton In 1895, he took on the lease of Parry's Theatre Royal in Hull and later purchased it.Hull Daily Mail, February 27, 1895 The Royal Changes Hands Morton engaged Ellen Terry at a guaranteed fee in order to gain prestige for the theatre, knowing that he was bound to make a loss. At 'Treasury' Ellen Terry asked the manager for a statement of the total receipts, and, realising that Morton would have a serious loss, magnanimously said she would accept only a net share, the only instance, said Morton, of any one who offered to take less than their 'pound of flesh'. Dan Leno was involved in a minor drama on the evening of 12 December 1895. Double-booked in Greenwich and Brighton, he was whisked off the Greenwich stage at 10.10 pm, bundled into a cab to New Cross Station where a specially chartered train took him to Brighton. Within 90 minutes he was on the stage of the Alhambra. There were several name changes during Morton's time. New, as is customary, was soon dropped. Later it became 'Morton‚Äôs Prince of Wales‚Äôs Theatre' to distinguish it from a new London theatre bearing the same name but whose letters and telegrams were getting mixed up with theirs. After renovations in 1891, he reopened as Morton's Model Theatre,then called it The Model House and Temperance Theatre, finally around 1898/99 simplifying the name to an earlier usage as Morton's Theatre. By this time, he was the owner. In 1897 he produced plans to build a new theatre seating 3000 on a nearby vacant site but this was never followed through. In 1904 he moved to Hull where in 1934 at the age of 96 he published his memoirs. He attributed his health in old age to hard work, regular habits and an abstemious diet.The Era 30 January 1924 p.10 = Final years = After Sefton Parry's death in 1887, the ownership of his theatres was transferred to the Sefton Parry Trust. William Morton eventually purchased the Greenwich Theatre outright, then, In April 1900, sold it to Arthur CarltonAdvert in The Era, 7 April 1900 p.16 who named it the Carlton Theatre. It remained so until about 1909. During the final twelve months the entertainment had become mainly of the music hall type. The building was auctioned in 1909. By now the cinema revolutionCinema of the United Kingdom ¬ß History had taken full hold and by 1914 it had become the Cinema de Luxe managed by H Morris of Cinema Palaces Ltd. The building was demolished in 1937 to make way for a new Town Hall, now a listed building and under new ownership and renamed Meridian House. Crooms Hill site, 1855 - present time = Rose and Crown 1855 = The site of the current Greenwich Theatre was originally a music hall created in 1855 as modest appendages to, or rooms within, the neighbouring Rose and Crown public house. It was licensed to John Green and known as the Rose and Crown Music Hall. = Crowder's Music Hall = In 1871 it was reconstructed by Charles Spencer Crowder and renamed Crowder's Music Hall with a separate entrance on Nevada Street. According to reports of the time, it was a splendid building boasting a new stage, equal to many of the West End theatres, and a new lavatory! The architect was W R Hough. It briefly rejoiced in the name 'Crowder's Music Hall and Temple of Varieties' but in 1879 was renamed by the new owner, Alfred Ambrose Hurley, as the Royal Borough Theatre of Varieties. = Parthenon et al = In 1898 it was rebuilt to the designs of John George Buckle, possibly for a Mr Hancock, and became the Parthenon Theatre of Varieties. The plaster fa√ßade can still be seen on Nevada Street today. It later became the Greenwich Palace of Varieties, The theatre's entrance on Crooms Hill dates from about 1902 when Samuel and Daniel Barnard took over and it became Barnard's Palace. It finally became the Greenwich Hippodrome. Playbills of the time mention star names such as Harry Champion and Lily Langtree, with more dramatic performances with spectacular effects projected by the latest attraction ‚Äì the Edisonograph. It showed both live performances and films as the Greenwich Hippodrome Picture Palace from 1915 until 1924 when it lost its licence for live entertainment and was converted into a cinema. During the Second World War, the theatre was re-opened as a repertory theatre with films on Sundays, but when an incendiary bomb crashed through the roof into the auditorium the theatre was closed and remained empty, occasionally being used for storage. In 1949, the building was closed. = Greenwich Theatre 1969‚Äìpresent = Greenwich Council bought the site for demolition in 1962, but agreed to support the idea of a new theatre if there was enough local enthusiasm to justify it. Ewan Hooper, a local actor and director, accepted the challenge of rallying support. A new building was designed by architect Brian Meeking within the old shell and it eventually reopened as the Greenwich Theatre in 1969. It had to survive a further crisis in the late 1990s prompted by the 1997 withdrawal of its annual subsidy from the London Arts Board. It eventually reopened in November 1999. The seating capacity is currently 421, around an open thrust stage. Theatrical history 1969‚Äìpresent On 21 October 1969 the theatre re-opened with Martin Luther King, a new piece of musical theatre written by Ewan Hooper, Artistic Director. Alan Vaughan Williams directed. From 1969, the theatre became a showcase for many new dramatic works. Early plays included Chekhov's Three Sisters and Jean Genet's The Maids, featuring Glenda Jackson, Susannah York and Vivien Merchant - many of the Greenwich cast featured in the subsequent film version. In 1975, Vivien Merchant and Timothy Dalton headed the cast of a revival of No√´l Coward's The Vortex.\\"The Vortex (1975‚Äì1976)\\" , Timothy Dalton - Shakespearean James Bond, accessed June 28, 2012 Greenwich Theatre also saw the premi√®re of John Mortimer's A Voyage Round My Father and, on 5 November 1981, Rupert Everett appeared in the 1981 premi√®re of Another Country - another play which successfully transferred to celluloid, having also won accolades in the West End. In 2009, the theatre returned to producing, collaborating with a new company, Stage on Screen, to stage and film plays, making them available on DVD for theatre lovers and students. The first two productions were Dr Faustus and The School for Scandal, followed in 2010 by Volpone and The Duchess of Malfi. (The School for Scandal had first been presented in Greenwich by William Morton in 1884.)'London Theatres', The Era, 23 August 1884 p. 10 In 2013, Sell a Door Theatre Company partnered with the Greenwich Theatre following nine productions at the South London venue. James Haddrell and David Hutchinson officially announced the partnership on 19 November 2013.

His fleet was officially on a trading mission, but its true intent was to destroy Portuguese power in the area. The fleet had 1400 men on board, including 600 soldiers. Matelieff did not succeed in this. The Dutch would ultimately gain control of Malacca more than thirty years later, again joining forces with the Sultanate of Johor, and a new ally Aceh, in 1641. He was born and died in Rotterdam.  Account  Drawings of the dodo from the travel journal of VOC- ship 'Gelderland' (1601‚Äì1603) Born in Rotterdam, Matelief was put in command of a fleet of eleven ships of the Dutch East India Company with the destination of Malacca. Malacca then was an inconvenient stronghold for non- Portuguese ships heading for the Indonesian Archipelago, China or Japan.Opstall, M.E. (1972) De reis van de vloot van Pieter Willemsz. Verhoeff naar Azie 1607 - 1612, p. 81. The fleet set sail from Zeeland on May 12, 1605.The ships were Orange, Nassau, Middelburg, Witte Leeuw, Zwarte Leeuw, Mauritius, Grote Zon, Amsterdam, Kleine Zon, Erasmus and Geunieerde Provincien. It was the third (?) such fleet from the Dutch East Indies Company to visit Malacca. Matelieff met with Steven van der Hagen on the island of Mauritius for a briefing in January 1606. As one of the first, Matelieff described the black rat, the dodo and the macaque monkey. Also his description of the vegetation of the island are most important.http://www.potomitan.info/dodo/c32.php He reached Malacca in April 1606. In May Matelief de Jonge formed a formal pact with the ruler of Johor, Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah III, to expel the Portuguese. In exchange, the Dutch would get Malacca for themselves and would be able to conduct trade with Johor.The two treaties signed on 17 May and 23 September 1606 are reprinted and translated into English in Borschberg, Hugo Grotius, the Portuguese and Free Trade, appendix 14, pp. 215-223. The Dutch and the Malay also agreed to tolerate each other's religion. =First battle of Malacca (August 1606)= Matelief laid siege to the Portuguese-held Malacca for several months,Melaka Falls Again but was repulsed on land by Portuguese troops under Andr√© Furtado de Mendon√ßa and their allies, a contingent of Japanese samurai from Red seal ships. A very large Portuguese fleet under Dom Martim Afonso de Castro, the Viceroy of Goa, arrived on the scene with twenty Portuguese ships on August 14, 1606. The two fleets fought from August 17. Nassau was boarded by Santa Cruz and Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o. Matelief, onboard Orange, went to the rescue but collided with another Dutch ship, Middelburg. These two ships were then attacked by S√£o Salvador and Dom Duarte de Guerra's galleon. Orange manage to break free, but the two Portuguese ships and the Middelburg all caught fire and sank in the action. The Santa Cruz and Concei√ß√£o eventually managed to set the Nassau on fire, leading to an explosion that sank her. Matelief landing troops in Malacca in 1606 Matelief decided to withdraw from the action, with 150 dead on the Dutch side, and around 500 on the Portuguese side. On August 19, 1606, he obtained permission from the Sultan of Johor to anchor his fleet for repairs in the Johor River. =Second battle of Malacca (Sept. 1606)= Matelief came back to the scene of the first battle about a month later. Castro had sailed away, leaving only ten Portuguese ships before Malacca.History of Holland - Chapter VI: The Beginnings of the Dutch Republic (by George Edmundson) Matelief attacked the ships and managed to sink or burn every single one of them, on September 21, 1606. At the end of his trip Matelieff had lost six ships.Opstall, M.E. (1972) De reis van de vloot van Pieter Willemsz. Verhoeff naar Azie 1607 - 1612, p. 176. Matelieff sailed in one ship from Ternate to Canton, and on June 4, 1607 he captured a Chinese junk, loaded with spices from Banda. When six Portuguese ships under Andr√© Pessoa showed up in front of the Chinese coast, he went back, without an agreement with China or reaching Japan. Matelieff arrived unsuccessfully on Bantam on November 24, 1607, and sent Willem Jansz with secret instructions to Banda to forestall the English ships.The First Discovery of Australia He left Bantam on January 28, 1608 =Return to Europe with a Siamese embassy (1608)= The Mauritius by Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom (1600) Matelieff returned to Europe in 1608 with Cornelius Specx, a Dutchman who had established a factory in Ayutthaya in 1604.Early Mapping of Southeast Asia, p.184, by Thomas Suarez Together with them was an embassy of 16 peoples from the Kingdom of Siam sent by the Siamese ruler Ekathotsarot. The embassy was brought to Holland by Matelief onboard Orange.English intercourse with Siam in the seventeenth century, p.38 They arrived in The Hague on September 10, 1608.

It is a prequel to Cruel Intentions (1999) and was released direct-to-video on March 13, 2001. Both films are based on Les Liaisons dangereuses by Choderlos de Laclos. Originally planned as a television series called Manchester Prep, a re-imagined prequel series to the first film, it was picked up by Fox, however, it was cancelled prior to broadcast in September 1999. Due to the cancellation, the three completed episodes were edited together into film re-titled Cruel Intentions 2, and sexual content scenes involving nudity were added for the DVD release. This film is about how Sebastian Valmont and Kathryn Merteuil met and how they started their reign of terror. Plot Troublemaker student Sebastian Valmont (Robin Dunne) is transferring to Manchester Prep following his father's new marriage to a wealthy divorcee. His current principal is insistent on having Sebastian's permanent record relayed to his new school, thereby hampering his chance for a fresh start, but Sebastian already retaliated by pulling a cruel stunt on his wife. Following his arrival in New York, Sebastian discovers the wealth of his new family and first meets his deceitful and determined step- sister Kathryn Merteuil (Amy Adams). Sebastian quickly proves to be able to better her both at piano and vocabulary. This leads to a confrontation between Kathryn and Sebastian whereby she states that she has a comfortable lifestyle and that he \\"better not interfere\\". Sebastian begins school. While waiting to see his new headmaster, he encounters Danielle Sherman (Sarah Thompson), who is, unbeknownst to him, Headmaster Sherman's daughter. Luckily, Sebastian swapped his permanent record for an excelling one before it was sent to the headmaster's office, and he can now start over with a clean slate. A school assembly follows, showing Kathryn delivering a speech to her classmates, but being persistently interrupted by uncontrollable hiccups coming from a student, who then begins to choke on the gum that she was chewing in a bid to stop her hiccups. She is saved by the quick action of Danielle who performs the Heimlich maneuver, allowing the student to expel the gum, which ends up flying into Kathryn's hair. A meeting of a secret society of student elites presided by Kathryn takes place, deciding upon the fate of the new students. This leads them to Cherie (Keri Lynn Pratt), the student with the hiccups, as well as the discovery that Cherie's family is wealthier than that of Kathryn; this, along with the events of the assembly, causes Kathryn to seek a vendetta against Cherie. Sebastain and Danielle become fast friends and Sebastian has a crush on her. They even swap stories about their lives. Sebastian mother was a drug addict and his parents split up when he was a kid. His father was a chartered boats in Miami and met Katherine's mother and married her. Sebastian is living one day at a time with all that wealth. Sebastian and Kathryn just started out of bickering step siblings. Sebastian already caught his father sleeping around in his yacht behind Kathryn's mother back. Sebastian, coming from a more humble upbringing, wishes to befriend his house staff. Doing so angers Kathryn, whose day is interrupted by not being able to contact her driver. This, combined with Kathryn's jealousy of Sebastian, causes her to admit that she is unhappy with her life. Sebastian attempts to woo Danielle: first, asking her for coffee at her work; then later, conversing with her over the telephone. Eventually, this evolves into a relationship, but Kathryn, seeing this, uses it as a way to get back at Sebastian. She tries to lure him away from Danielle by tempting him with identical twins, who confide to Sebastian that Danielle is the only virgin at Manchester. Kathryn's attempt to sabotage Cherie backfires, as Kathryn's mother tells her to become best friends with Cherie, in an attempt to encourage Cherie's mother to donate a large amount of money to the school. In the end, Sebastian stays with Danielle; he professes his love for her, only to find that she does not reciprocate. It turns out that Danielle is actually working alongside Kathryn in a secret plan to dupe Sebastian. Defeated by Kathryn's manipulation, Sebastian states \\"if you can't beat them, join them\\", thus leading to a threesome with Danielle and Kathryn, followed by an alliance of the three to dominate and manipulate others. Danielle gave Sebastian a journal to write down everything. In the last scene, Cherie is seen riding her bike, which is run over by Sebastian's car. Sebastian offers to give her a ride, and has sex with her. Kathryn and Danielle are seen, in the front of the car, pleased with the results.

Various types of probes are used in CMMs, including mechanical, optical, laser, and white light. Depending on the machine, the probe position may be manually controlled by an operator or it may be computer controlled. CMMs typically specify a probe's position in terms of its displacement from a reference position in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system (i.e., with XYZ axes). In addition to moving the probe along the X, Y, and Z axes, many machines also allow the probe angle to be controlled to allow measurement of surfaces that would otherwise be unreachable. Coordinate Measuring Machine Coordinate Measuring Machine Description The typical 3D \\"bridge\\" CMM allows probe movement along three axes, X, Y and Z, which are orthogonal to each other in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. Each axis has a sensor that monitors the position of the probe on that axis, typically with micrometer precision. When the probe contacts (or otherwise detects) a particular location on the object, the machine samples the three position sensors, thus measuring the location of one point on the object's surface. This process is repeated as necessary, moving the probe each time, to produce a \\"point cloud\\" which describes the surface areas of interest. A common use of CMMs is in manufacturing and assembly processes to test a part or assembly against the design intent. In such applications, point clouds are generated which are analysed via regression algorithms for the construction of features. These points are collected by using a probe that is positioned manually by an operator or automatically via Direct Computer Control (DCC). DCC CMMs can be programmed to repeatedly measure identical parts; thus an automated CMM is a specialized form of industrial robot.  Technical facts  = Parts = Coordinate-measuring machines include three main components: * The main structure which includes three axes of motion. The material used to construct the moving frame has varied over the years. Granite and steel were used in the early CMM's. Today all the major CMM manufacturers build frames from aluminium alloy or some derivative and also use ceramic to increase the stiffness of the Z axis for scanning applications. Few CMM builders today still manufacture granite frame CMM due to market requirement for improved metrology dynamics and increasing trend to install CMM outside of the quality lab. Typically only low volume CMM builders and domestic manufacturers in China and India are still manufacturing granite CMM due to low technology approach and easy entry to become a CMM frame builder. The increasing trend towards scanning also requires the CMM Z axis to be stiffer and new materials have been introduced such as ceramic and silicon carbide. * Probing system * Data collection and reduction system ‚Äî typically includes a machine controller, desktop computer and application software. = Availability = These machines can be free- standing, handheld and portable.  Specific parts  = Machine body = The first CMM was developed by the Ferranti Company of Scotland in the 1950s\\"Coordinate Measuring Machine History ‚Äì Fifty Years of CMM History leading up to a Measuring Revolution\\", COORD3 Metrology . Accessed 23 August 2013 as the result of a direct need to measure precision components in their military products, although this machine only had 2 axes. The first 3-axis models began appearing in the 1960s (DEA of Italy) and computer control debuted in the early 1970s but the first working CMM was developed and put on sale by Browne & Sharpe in Melbourne, England. (Leitz Germany subsequently produced a fixed machine structure with moving table. In modern machines, the gantry-type superstructure has two legs and is often called a bridge. This moves freely along the granite table with one leg (often referred to as the inside leg) following a guide rail attached to one side of the granite table. The opposite leg (often outside leg) simply rests on the granite table following the vertical surface contour. Air bearings are the chosen method for ensuring friction free travel. In these, compressed air is forced through a series of very small holes in a flat bearing surface to provide a smooth but controlled air cushion on which the CMM can move in a frictionless manner. The movement of the bridge or gantry along the granite table forms one axis of the XY plane. The bridge of the gantry contains a carriage which traverses between the inside and outside legs and forms the other X or Y horizontal axis. The third axis of movement (Z axis) is provided by the addition of a vertical quill or spindle which moves up and down through the center of the carriage. The touch probe forms the sensing device on the end of the quill. The movement of the X, Y and Z axes fully describes the measuring envelope. Optional rotary tables can be used to enhance the approachability of the measuring probe to complicated workpieces. The rotary table as a fourth drive axis does not enhance the measuring dimensions, which remain 3D, but it does provide a degree of flexibility. Some touch probes are themselves powered rotary devices with the probe tip able to swivel vertically through 90 degrees and through a full 360 degree rotation. As well as the traditional three axis machines (as pictured above), CMMs are now also available in a variety of other forms. These include CMM arms that use angular measurements taken at the joints of the arm to calculate the position of the stylus tip. Such arm CMMs are often used where their portability is an advantage over traditional fixed bed CMMs. Because CMM arms imitate the flexibility of a human arm they are also often able to reach the insides of complex parts that could not be probed using a standard three axis machine. = Mechanical probe = In the early days of coordinate measurement (CMM), mechanical probes were fitted into a special holder on the end of the quill. A very common probe was made by soldering a hard ball to the end of a shaft. This was ideal for measuring a whole range of flat face, cylindrical or spherical surfaces. Other probes were ground to specific shapes, for example a quadrant, to enable measurement of special features. These probes were physically held against the workpiece with the position in space being read from a 3-axis digital readout (DRO) or, in more advanced systems, being logged into a computer by means of a footswitch or similar device. Measurements taken by this contact method were often unreliable as machines were moved by hand and each machine operator applied different amounts of pressure on the probe or adopted differing techniques for the measurement. A further development was the addition of motors for driving each axis. Operators no longer had to physically touch the machine but could drive each axis using a handbox with joysticks in much the same way as with modern remote controlled cars. Measurement accuracy and precision improved dramatically with the invention of the electronic touch trigger probe. The pioneer of this new probe device was David McMurtry who subsequently formed what is now Renishaw plc.Renishaw: Biography Although still a contact device, the probe had a spring-loaded steel ball (later ruby ball) stylus. As the probe touched the surface of the component the stylus deflected and simultaneously sent the X,Y,Z coordinate information to the computer. Measurement errors caused by individual operators became fewer and the stage was set for the introduction of CNC operations and the coming of age of CMMs. Motorised automated probe head with electronic touch trigger probe Optical probes are lens-CCD-systems, which are moved like the mechanical ones, and are aimed at the point of interest, instead of touching the material. The captured image of the surface will be enclosed in the borders of a measuring window, until the residue is adequate to contrast between black and white zones. The dividing curve can be calculated to a point, which is the wanted measuring point in space. The horizontal information on the CCD is 2D (XY) and the vertical position is the position of the complete probing system on the stand Z-drive (or other device component). =New probing systems= There are newer models that have probes that drag along the surface of the part taking points at specified intervals, known as scanning probes. This method of CMM inspection is often more accurate than the conventional touch-probe method and most times faster as well. The next generation of scanning, known as noncontact scanning, which includes high speed laser single point triangulation, laser line scanning, and white light scanning, is advancing very quickly. This method uses either laser beams or white light that are projected against the surface of the part. Many thousands of points can then be taken and used not only to check size and position, but to create a 3D image of the part as well. This \\"point-cloud data\\" can then be transferred to CAD software to create a working 3D model of the part. These optical scanners are often used on soft or delicate parts or to facilitate reverse engineering. ;Micrometrology probes Probing systems for microscale metrology applications are another emerging area. There are several commercially available coordinate measuring machines (CMM) that have a microprobe integrated into the system, several specialty systems at government laboratories, and any number of university-built metrology platforms for microscale metrology. Although these machines are good and in many cases excellent metrology platforms with nanometric scales, their primary limitation is a reliable, robust, capable micro/nano probe. Challenges for microscale probing technologies include the need for a high aspect ratio probe giving the ability to access deep, narrow features with low contact forces so as to not damage the surface and high precision (nanometer level). Additionally microscale probes are susceptible to environmental conditions such as humidity and surface interactions such as stiction (caused by adhesion, meniscus, and/or Van der Waals forces among others). Technologies to achieve microscale probing include scaled down version of classical CMM probes, optical probes, and a standing wave probe among others. However, current optical technologies cannot be scaled small enough to measure deep, narrow feature, and optical resolution is limited by the wavelength of light. X-ray imaging provides a picture of the feature but no traceable metrology information. ;Physical principles Optical probes and/or laser probes can be used (if possible in combination), which change CMMs to measuring microscopes or multi-sensor measuring machines. Fringe projection systems, theodolite triangulation systems or laser distant and triangulation systems are not called measuring machines, but the measuring result is the same: a space point. Laser probes are used to detect the distance between the surface and the reference point on the end of the kinematic chain (i.e.: end of the Z-drive component). This can use an interferometrical function, focus variation, light deflection or a beam shadowing principle. Portable coordinate-measuring machines Whereas traditional CMMs use a probe that moves on three Cartesian axes to measure an object‚Äôs physical characteristics, portable CMMs use either articulated arms or, in the case of optical CMMs, arm-free scanning systems that use optical triangulation methods and enable total freedom of movement around the object. Portable CMMs with articulated arms have six or seven axes that are equipped with rotary encoders, instead of linear axes. Portable arms are lightweight (typically less than 20 pounds) and can be carried and used nearly anywhere. However, optical CMMs are increasingly being used in the industry. Designed with compact linear or matrix array cameras (like the Microsoft Kinect), optical CMMs are smaller than portable CMMs with arms, feature no wires, and enable users to easily take 3D measurements of all types of objects located almost anywhere. Certain nonrepetitive applications such as reverse engineering, rapid prototyping, and large-scale inspection of parts of all sizes are ideally suited for portable CMMs. The benefits of portable CMMs are multifold. Users have the flexibility in taking 3D measurements of all types of parts and in the most remote/difficult locations. They are easy to use and do not require a controlled environment to take accurate measurements. Moreover, portable CMMs tend to cost less than traditional CMMs. The inherent trade-offs of portable CMMs are manual operation (they always require a human to use them). In addition, their overall accuracy can be somewhat less accurate than that of a bridge type CMM and is less suitable for some applications. Multisensor- measuring machines Traditional CMM technology using touch probes is today often combined with other measurement technology. This includes laser, video or white light sensors to provide what is known as multisensor measurement. Standardization To verify the performance of a coordinate measurement machine, the ISO 10360 series is available. This series of standards define the characteristics of the probing system and the length measurement error: * PForm: probing deviation when measuring the form of a sphere *PSize: probing deviation when measuring the size of a sphere *EUni: deviation of measuring length on spheres from one direction *EBi: deviation of measuring length on spheres from left and right The ISO 10360 series consists of the following parts: *ISO 10360-1 Geometrical product specifications (GPS) -- Acceptance and reverification tests for coordinate measuring machines (CMM) -- Part 1: Vocabulary *ISO 10360-2 Geometrical product specifications (GPS) -- Acceptance and reverification tests for coordinate measuring machines (CMM) -- Part 2: CMMs used for measuring linear dimensions *ISO 10360-7 Geometrical product specifications (GPS) -- Acceptance and reverification tests for coordinate measuring machines (CMM) -- Part 7: CMMs equipped with imaging probing systems *ISO 10360-8 Geometrical product specifications (GPS) -- Acceptance and reverification tests for coordinate measuring systems (CMS) -- Part 8: CMMs with optical distance sensors See also *Universal measuring machine *3D scanner References Category:Industrial machinery Category:Measuring instruments Category:Metrology Category:Metalworking measuring instruments Category:Dimensional instruments ","title":"Coordinate-measuring machine"},{"id":"2619015","text":"Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary is a heritage-listed zoological garden at 28 Tomewin Street, Currumbin, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1947 onwards. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2009. The sanctuary is world-renowned for its feeding of huge flocks of free- flying wild rainbow lorikeets, which come to the sanctuary to feast off the special mixture which the lorikeets eat. The multitude of events, shows and attractions include dingo encounters, free flight bird shows and feeding of the park's massive saltwater crocodile. The park also contains a serious aspect of its work and exhibits, and behind the scenes includes a state-of- the-art veterinary and rehabilitation hospital. The sanctuary was opened as the Currumbin Bird Sanctuary by Alex Griffiths in 1947 as a scheme to stop the local lorikeet population destroying his flower plantations. The lorikeets still flock to the sanctuary twice daily to be fed by visitors. The sanctuary now houses one of the largest collections of Australian native species in the world. Exhibits include Tasmanian devils, a reptile house and in December 2017 the sanctuary opened their new exotics precinct Lost Valley which is home to lemurs, red pandas, capybara, cotton-top tamarins, tree kangaroos and one of largest walk-through aviary in the Southern Hemisphere with free flying birds. The sanctuary also has a miniature railway that has been operating since 1964. In May 2011, the hospital has appealed for donations and government support as it faces a funding shortage that may force it to turn away injured wildlife.  History  The Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary was established by beekeeper and floriculturist Alex Griffiths in 1947 as a small-scale tourist venture featuring lorikeet feeding displays in which tourists could participate. By at least 1953 it was known as the Currumbin Bird Sanctuary and by the mid-1950s had become an iconic tourist attraction on the Gold Coast. The place had evolved by the early 1970s to offer visitors a variety of experiences, including: * the chance to see numerous bird and animal species and learn about their part in the regional natural environment; * take a miniature train ride around the large site * purchase souvenirs * enjoy a meal. In 1976 Griffiths gifted the sanctuary to the National Trust of Queensland (the Trust), and the terms of this exchange and its ongoing operation are set out in the Currumbin Bird Sanctuary Act 1976. The place was renamed the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary in 1995. It continues to be operated by the Trust as a nature-based tourism enterprise and is recognised as one of the oldest of its kind to remain in operation in the state. The sanctuary lands gifted by Alex Griffith to the Trust encompassed four main areas: * the original sanctuary site on the southern side of Tomewin Street and three contiguous properties in Teemangum Street, including a house occupied by Alex Griffiths from 1971 until 1998 * a car park and a picnic ground on the northern side of Tomewin Street * of heavily treed land on the western side of the Gold Coast Highway, known as the Western Reserve * a property that Griffiths had named Coolamon, located on the Currumbin Creek-Tomewin Road in the Currumbin Valley just over to the west of the main venue The Trust also took over the leasehold of: * swampy land on either side of Flat Rock Creek formerly leased by Griffiths for sanctuary purposes * a tunnel that Griffith had constructed under the Gold Coast Highway, linking the Tomewin Street site and the Western Reserve. The Currumbin area was taken up as timber leases in the 1860s and 1870s, with some gold fossicking in the creek in the late 1870s. The coastal strip was subdivided into housing allotments in 1886, but was slow to develop. Access to the area at that time was via a coach service that used the beach as a roadway. Bananas were a successful crop from the late nineteenth century and became a key industry in the Currumbin Valley in the twentieth century. In 1903 a rail line between Nerang and Tweed Heads was constructed, and a siding built at Currumbin in 1908 to cater for timber getters and dairy farmers. The Currumbin School opened the following year. During the 1920s and 1930s a rapid rise in private motor vehicle ownership, the construction of a new coastal road (the Pacific Highway) between Brisbane and Southport, and the opening of the Jubilee Bridge over the Nerang River, led to the subdivision and sale of many estates between Southport and the New South Wales border including Currumbin, especially after the final section of the Pacific Highway, between Currumbin and Coolangatta, opened in December 1933. It is ironic that the Currumbin Bird Sanctuary, a nature-based venture, emerged from the post-World War II development boom that saw the Gold Coast establish its present iconic identity as Queensland's premier tourist destination. In the 1950s a greater capacity to pursue leisure, increasing ownership and usage of private motor vehicles, and a growing preference among holidaymakers for American-style resorts and tourist entertainments, resulted in changed accommodation styles on the Gold Coast and increased patronage of \\"tourist attractions\\" other than the natural attractions of surf beaches and estuary bathing and fishing. With the lifting of war-time building restrictions in 1952, an intense period of building development and property speculation at the South Coast followed, attracting entrepreneurs focussed largely on the tourism potential of the place. The term \\"Gold Coast\\" was coined in response to this promise of prosperity and wealth, and was embraced by locals. The South Coast Town Council officially changed its name to Gold Coast Town Council in 1958, and in 1959 the municipality was declared a city. The Currumbin Bird Sanctuary evolved from the flower-farming and bee-keeping activities of Alexander Morris Griffiths. Born in New Zealand in 1911, his family moved in 1927 to Norfolk Island, where they grew bananas for the Sydney market. His parents retired to Currumbin in 1941, acquiring two adjoining parcels of land comprising in Tomewin Street in February 1944. Alex joined them and at their Currumbin property established bee hives, planted gladioli, and ran a small road-side stall selling honey and flowers. However, local lorikeets proved problematic, destroying the marketability of the flowers and eating the honey from the hives. The diversionary solution Griffiths devised to protect his flower crop was to feed the birds honey and bread from a plate. The birds increased in numbers to a point where visitors would come to witness the afternoon feedings. Around 1947 Griffiths erected a small kiosk on Tomewin Street to sell his honey and Devonshire teas. The lorikeet-feeding spectacle continued to gain renown and was included in South Coast tourism promotional material. Griffiths did not charge admission fees to his sanctuary but left a donation box near the exit. He also became the unofficial wildlife carer of the district, caring for fauna in his home and utilising small structures in the sanctuary for sick and recuperating birds and animals. Soon after Griffiths established his nascent bird sanctuary, another nature-based tourism venture commenced in nearby Tallebudgera Valley in 1951 with the establishment of David Fleay Wildlife Park. Fleay had a similar philosophy to Griffiths arguing that fauna should be kept in conditions as close as possible to the natural environment, and was critical of modern zoos; however, Griffiths began as an entrepreneurial amateur while Fleay was a naturalist with scientific training, and before moving to Queensland, when still in Victoria, had been responsible for the first successful captive breeding programs of a number of Australian indigenous animals. During the early 1950s Griffiths expanded his bird sanctuary with the acquisition of more land on the southern side of Tomewin Street, and utilised the adjacent public reserves along Flat Rock Creek. When an application was made for a dredging lease in the Scenic Reserve (R.579) along the creek in January 1956, Griffiths wrote a letter to the editor of The Courier-Mail protesting against the proposed sand mining because he had spent years encouraging wild birds to Flat Rock Creek. He received widespread public support and petitions against the sand mining were lodged. The Land Commissioner inspected the creek and noted that it contained a permanent waterhole frequented by wild ducks, pigmy geese and black swans. He also reported that the South Coast Town Council valued the bird sanctuary as an important tourist attraction and endorsed Griffiths' actions in preserving wildlife. A number of conservation organisations, including the Queensland Naturalists Club and the Save the Trees Campaign, also objected to the sand mining, arguing that, in the wake of other recent sand mining operations on the coast that had caused the loss of many native trees, Currumbin Sanctuary provided alternative food and shelter to displaced birds. The dredging application was withdrawn. This early example of a conservation battle waged on the South Coast occurred twelve years prior to Fleay's battle to save Tallebudgera Creek from canal development. The sanctuary had gained such a level of renown that in October 1956 the (American) National Geographic sent top-ranking nature photographer and journalist Dr Paul Zahl to document the lorikeet-feeding phenomena. He described a scene of expectant lorikeets and tourists waiting for Alex Griffiths to fill pie tins with a mixture of bread, water and honey, and the delight of tourists when allowed to feed the birds. By this time Griffiths had other indigenous wildlife on the property and was well known as a wildlife carer of sick and injured animals and birds. No bird was kept in captivity if it was able to fly. Zahl reported that the sanctuary already had a national profile, attracting 2000 visitors on holiday weekends, but the publication of his article gave it an international profile that enhanced its tourism potential and that of the South Coast. The 1960s was a significant period of expansion for the sanctuary. In 1963 Griffiths was given a licence to enclose the road between the sanctuary and the creek, and a lease on the Scenic Reserve on the banks of Flat Rock Creek contiguous with the road. Around this time he installed a neon sign within the road licence area facing onto Flat Rock Creek, which was visible to travellers along the main road. In June 1964, a miniature railway was introduced. Built in Brisbane by James Jackson, the train hauled six passenger cars and operated on an eleven- inch gauge rail loop for around the Tomewin Street site. Other elements of this expansion scheme included the construction of an octagonal-shaped Rock Shop (now known as the Spirit of the Outback shop), for which planning approval was given by the Gold Coast City Council in April 1964; and a butterfly display which is no longer extant. Both projects cost . The Rock Shop showcased Griffiths' passion for rock collecting and included the production of jewellery on site. He claimed it was the first of its type in Australia. The octagonal form of the Rock Shop was replicated in most of the buildings constructed at the sanctuary during the 1960s and into the 1970s, although the Rock Shop Annex constructed in 1965 did not adhere to this precept. Griffiths formed a number of companies during this time and began acquiring additional lands around his sanctuary under company title, including parcels in Tomewin Street opposite the sanctuary for car parking. In the past, Queensland tourist attractions featuring animals and birds were mostly limited to zoos, such as : * Queensport Aquarium (1889‚Äì95) * Koombul Park near Cairns (early 1900s) * Brisbane Botanic Gardens (early 1900s ‚Äì 1952) * Rockhampton Botanic Gardens (established 1905 and extant in 2009) * Hartley's Creek Crocodile Farm north of Cairns (1934 and still operational in 2009) One of the earliest nature-based tourism ventures was The Jungle near Malanda on the Atherton Tableland in far north Queensland, which showcased indigenous flora and fauna and Aboriginal culture from 1920 until the 1970s. In south-east Queensland, the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary was established in 1927, in response to the last open season on koalas, which had yielded 500,000 skins. On the South Coast, Alex Griffiths' serendipitous establishment of the Currumbin Sanctuary in 1947 was the first tourism venture to showcase fauna in an essentially natural setting. Animal attractions at the Gold Coast have tended to concentrate on their entertainment or curiosity value ‚Äì such as the small zoo and aquarium established at the rebuilt Surfers Paradise Hotel in 1936. The 1950s saw the establishment of Natureland Zoo at Coolangatta and Jack Evans' erroneously named Pet Porpoise Pool at Snapper Rocks, featuring performing dolphins kept in captivity. Evans relocated to Tweed Heads in 1961. Marineland was established on The Spit at Southport in 1966 and Keith Williams' Ski World relocated from Carrara to The Spit in 1970. In 1972 Williams renamed the attraction Sea World, introduced dolphins and Californian sea lions, and built a marine stadium, chairlift and other attractions. He purchased Marineland in 1976 and transferred marine life displays to Sea World. He also purchased Jack Evan's Porpoise Pool business at this time. Marineland then became Bird Life Park. The only venture similar to the Currumbin Bird Sanctuary on the Gold Coast was David Fleay's Fauna Reserve at West Burleigh, which had a greater focus on scientific research. In April 1968, Griffiths announced that in the next two years he planned to develop the sanctuary into a substantial wildlife attraction utilising of land on the western side of the highway, to which he acquired title in October 1968. The site was part of a former dairy and banana farm, and retained a number of artificial ponds or dams at the southern end, patches of subtropical rainforest in the north-western corner, and some transitional forest. Griffiths' plans for the property included a two-mile extension of the miniature railway, and a large aviary encompassing mature trees for birds unable to survive in the wild. The chain of lagoons and ponds along a secondary watercourse to Flat Rock Creek would provide a habitat for water fowl. He also planned a new three-storeyed kiosk on the Tomewin Street site and employed architect Stephen Trotter of the firm Fulton Collin Boys Gilmour Trotter & Partners to prepare a design. He was also negotiating with the Main Roads Department to build a tunnel under the planned new four lane highway to link the two properties. In the late 1960s the Gold Coast City Council demonstrated its support for Griffiths' work by constructing an illuminated fountain in Flat Rock Creek adjacent to the sanctuary, visible at night to passers by on the highway. It is understood that this structure is no longer extant. The new Kiosk opened in March 1972, at a cost of about $120,000. It was a three-storey building made around a concrete frame with some stone wall facings, brick infill and large sliding doors, in an octagonal plan that reflected the approach taken to earlier structures on the site. The architect recalls that this plan geometry was intended to reference the individual chambers of a beehive (although these are hexagonal). With a central lift and stairs, the building had a basement housing service facilities; a main kiosk level that opened to both the street and to the lorikeet-feeding arena; and a mezzanine level used as a VIP lounge. The concrete tiled hipped roof had exposed timber framing on the interior and a large skylight at its apex. In 1972 Hugh Sawrey (1919‚Äì1999), a Queensland-born artist who in the 1970s and 1980s developed a national reputation for his paintings depicting Australian outback life, was commissioned to paint a large mural in the main level of the Kiosk. By 1972 Sawrey kept a successful horse stud at Coomera on the Gold Coast, which he moved that year to Boonah and to Victoria in 1978. His was the inspiration behind of the establishment of the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame and Outback Heritage Centre at Longreach, which opened in 1988, and he was a strong supporter of Alex Griffiths' work at Currumbin. Griffiths' parents' house and a neighbouring property, the former Currumbin Tea Gardens, were demolished for the construction of the new Kiosk. Griffiths then moved to another property that he owned in adjacent Teemangum Street ‚Äì a small, early 1950s fibro cottage with an attached shop. During the early 1970s negotiations continued on the construction of a tunnel under the Gold Coast Highway linking the existing sanctuary to the new Western Reserve. This was built in conjunction with the construction of a four lane highway and new Currumbin Creek Bridge, which opened in November 1974. Leases on the reserves on either side of Flat Rock Creek were secured and eventually a new Reserve for Parks and Recreation (R.579) was gazetted in December 1977. The road reserve between the sanctuary and the Flat Rock Creek leased land was closed in 1993, formally enlarging the sanctuary. Between 1969 and 1973, Griffiths also acquired in the Currumbin Valley that he named Coolamon, an aboriginal word for carry basket, and also the name of the tree which is the floral emblem of the neighbouring Tweed Shire. Coolamon was used as a release area for rehabilitated fauna. It was also considered a possible venue for further educational purposes as it retained remnants of indigenous vegetation. By the early 1970s facilities on the formally laid out site on Tomewin Street included: the original kiosk and fernery, the lorikeet-feeding arena, the Rock Shop and its annex, the new Kiosk, the miniature railway and its butterfly-roofed station shelter, a number of aviaries (including a Rainforest Aviary), a bakery, a mini-cars course, an aquarium, a collector's corner, and a children's playground called Fairyland. This area was complemented by the more informally laid out Western Reserve which housed an array of indigenous fauna, some free ranging. One loop of the miniature railway existed around the southern part of the Western Reserve, travelling along Flat Rock Creek and crossing a chain of lagoons in order to showcase the water birds that frequented the site. There was a small siding (no longer extant) near the current Koala Junction Station. Visitation in 1973 was estimated at 600,000 per annum. Around this time Griffiths sought to find an organisation to take on the management of the sanctuary, stating: \\"I wanted to make sure that on my death the Sanctuary would continue its work as a haven for wildlife... As you can see, I had to ensure that these creatures always had a safe place to come, even after I am gone.\\" He began negotiations with the National Trust of Queensland with a view to gifting the sanctuary to them. This necessitated the drafting of legislation to allow the Trust to take over the property, which was assented to on 3 November 1976. The Currumbin Bird Sanctuary Act 1976 made provision for the Trust to wind up the companies set up by Griffiths to manage various aspects of the sanctuary. These were dissolved early in 1977 so that the sanctuary could operate as a commercial undertaking in its own right. The gifted properties were formally transferred to the Trust between 9 and 15 March 1978. As part of the new management structure, a Board of Advice was established to which Alex Griffiths was appointed Chairman for life. He stepped aside in favour of retired Governor of Queensland Sir Colin Hannah, who was then succeeded by Sir Sholto Douglas. In 1980 the Trust produced a comprehensive development plan with ambitious ideas for the redevelopment of the park, aimed at removing all unserviceable or outdated structures, particularly old aviaries, and adapting existing serviceable buildings. In late 1980 the Trust discontinued the Board of Advice, effectively negating Alex Griffith's role as an advisor to the sanctuary. Both the Trust's need to operate the sanctuary as a commercial venture and Alex Griffith's desire to keep it as a fauna and flora reserve were embodied within the 1976 act, but Griffiths became increasingly estranged from the Trust and its management of the sanctuary. There were philosophical differences between his layman's perception of conservation, and the scientific approach which opposed artificial feeding of wildlife and the maintenance of exotic species. Griffiths had always kept exotic species at the sanctuary and continued to house peacocks at Coolamon, where he moved to live in a caravan from around Christmas 1982. During the 1980s he continued to invest in this property, installing three landscaped dams, a concrete weir and spillways, and a hardwood vehicular bridge. The Trust pursued an active program of site development through the 1980s with the construction of a children's playground (1985‚Äì86), refurbishment of the Rainforest Aviary as the Rainforest Pool Aviary (1987), and construction of a Sub-Tropical Aviary (1988). In the 1990s a number of new facilities were constructed, including the Sir Walter Campbell Environmental Education centre, a new koala exhibit, the Koala Junction Kiosk, a freshwater crocodile display, a Tasmanian devil enclosure, four new cockatoo aviaries, and Flora Gully (which included rare and endangered species of plants). None of these elements is considered to be of cultural heritage significance for the purposes of this entry in the Queensland heritage register. At this period the Trust also made major renovations to the main administration building, extended the Kiosk to incorporate a shop and the nearby Honey House, and renovated two aviaries. In 1995 the Trust adopted a long-term goal for the place: Currumbin Sanctuary was to be recognised nationally and internationally as a pre-eminent institution in the preservation and presentation of Australian indigenous fauna and flora, and in sustaining and promoting heritage-related values and ideas. The name was changed to Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary to reflect this objective. 1996 visitation statistics showed 82,000 local, 96,000 interstate and 340,000 international visitors. Alex Griffiths died on 29 July 1998. He had received numerous awards during his life: he became a Member in the Order of Australia in 1976; was awarded the Order of the White Cross for protection of wildlife in 1977; along with fellow Gold Coast environmentalist David Fleay was given \\"Freedom of the City\\" of the Gold Coast by Mayor Lex Bell in 1989; and received an Honorary Doctorate from Griffith University in 1995. In 1999 Gold Coast City Council named a nearby open space in Teemangum Street, Alex Griffiths Park. The significance of the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary within its local context was recognised in the 1997 Gold Coast Urban Heritage and Character Study which stated: \\"The Currumbin Area is one of a particular character... Generally the area contains more natural vegetation that other areas of the coast due in part to the difficulty of building on the steep hillsides and in part to the presence of the Currumbin Bird Sanctuary ‚Äì a long standing icon and landmark of the Gold Coast.\\" Its significance in Queensland has been recognised recently through its inclusion in the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland's \\"150 must do's\\" as well as being voted one of the top 15 iconic Queensland locations as part of the State's sesquicentenary celebrations (Q150). The sanctuary continues to draw tourists from around Australia and internationally. Visitation statistics for 2007‚Äì2008 indicate 148,000 local, 98,000 interstate and 150,000 international visitors. While local visitation has almost doubled in the past 12 years, international visitors' numbers have dropped markedly, reflective of a general downturn in international tourists visiting the State. Of the facilities existing at the time of Alex Griffiths' gift to the Trust in 1976, only the Kiosk, Spirit of the Outback Store (former Rock Shop) and its annex, miniature railway (particularly its original circuit on the Tomewin Street site and its southernmost circuit on the Western Reserve), the refurbished Rainforest Pool Aviary, site of the lorikeet-feeding arena, and one small octagonal building (possibly a former bird hospital), remain. All of the properties retain significant remnant indigenous vegetation, which Griffiths retained as part of the concept of a flora reserve, and as a sheltering and breeding place for fauna.  Description  Entrance to the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, 2015 The extent of land included within the heritage boundary for the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary encompasses: all those freeholds gifted to the National Trust of Queensland in 1976 and transferred to it in March 1978; and a number of leaseholds along Flat Rock Creek and over the tunnel under the Gold Coast Highway. This comprises approximately of freehold land and of leasehold. The heritage boundary does not include freehold properties acquired by the Trust after March 1978. The sanctuary lands that have been included within the heritage register boundary form two discrete areas: * the main sanctuary with its tourist facilities, located in the suburb of Currumbin on the Gold Coast * a property known as Coolamon situated just over nine kilometres to the south- west in the Currumbin Valley, adjacent to the Nicoll Scrub National Park. Within the heritage boundary, only those facilities associated with Alex Griffith's management of the site are considered to be of cultural heritage significance for the purposes of this entry in the Queensland heritage register. = The main sanctuary = The main sanctuary sits to the south and south-west of the hill that surmounts Currumbin Point on the southern shore of Currumbin Creek, less than from the coast. It is nestled within an area where the high-rise buildings that characterise development elsewhere on the Gold Coast are absent. The sanctuary lands here are intersected by the Gold Coast Highway, which runs north-west to south-east, and Tomewin Street, oriented south-west to north-east. There are four identifiable areas within the main sanctuary: * three on the eastern side of the highway:  the original sanctuary site on the southern side of Tomewin Street  adjacent reserve lands around Flat Rock Creek (leased from the Gold Coast City Council)  a car park and picnic ground on the northern side of Tomewin Street * a substantial area of land to the west of the Gold Coast Highway, known as the Western Reserve. A tunnel under the highway links the eastern and western sides of the main sanctuary.  East of the highway and south of Tomewin Street  The largest expanse of sanctuary land on the eastern side of the Gold Coast Highway is bordered to the north-west by Tomewin Street, to the south-west by Flat Rock Creek, to the north-east by houses and vacant allotments that front Teemangum Street, and to the south-east by a large residential unit development. It covers almost one and a half hectares. The northern end of this area contains the entrance to the sanctuary, leading to a formal complex of structures, miniature train lines and landscaping elements, including a number of facilities installed pre-1976. These include: the Spirit of the Outback Store or former Rock Shop and its annex (completed 1964 and 1965); the three-storeyed Kiosk building (completed 1972, extended 1989 and early 1990s); large sections of the miniature train line; a small fibrous- cement clad building in the south-east corner of the site; and the refurbished Rainforest Pool Aviary at the south-east corner of the Kiosk building. The present lorikeet-feeding arena occupies the same site and shares the same general arrangement employed by Alex Griffiths in his bird-feeding spectacles from at least the early 1950s. The southern side of Tomewin Street forms the public face of the sanctuary, with parking and drop-off bays along its length being shaded by established trees, which are particularly dense towards the highway. The composite-frame, brick and steel sheet-roofed building that lines a significant part of this roadway behind the street trees is based around the 1972 Kiosk, which since completion had been the entry to the sanctuary. This building is organised around interlocking octagonal plan-forms. The entry used by visitors prior to Easter 2009 is now marked by a large pergola made with timber rafters spanning between the building and a steel semi-circular beam that is supported on two steel columns encased in fibreglass resembling tree trunks. A single glass door provides access via a set of stairs to the administration area. A further line of glass doors and windows completes this facade. The largest and the most significant component of this building occupies the easternmost end and houses: a service zone in its basement; on its ground floor a cafe and Hugh Sawrey Room where the artist's large mural is located, toilets, and some conference accommodation to the north-east; and administration offices on the upper mezzanine level. Within this three-level structure is the 1972 octagonally planned Kiosk. It has an upper level surmounted by a hipped eight-panelled roof with a separate, raised clerestory section at the apex and small dormer windows in all but one of its panels, which was installed during the 1989 renovation. On its north-eastern side is a narrow verandah off the conference rooms. On the opposite side a large expanse of timber decking (1989) opens out from the cafe and allows visitors to eat under the trees and observe the adjacent lorikeet-feeding arena to the west. The renovated Kiosk sits on a concrete slab, which supports a central concrete access core and the floor slabs for the main and mezzanine levels. The doors and windows are largely aluminium-framed. The eaves and its wide fascia panels are lined with narrow, stained timber boards. To the south and west a large timber-framed deck area wraps around this building, creating a transition zone between the cafe and its central servery and the lorikeet-feeding arena and entrance to the Spirit of the Outback store (former Rock Shop). It is raised off the ground by approximately one metre and is cutaway to allow for the growth of a number of trees, including a number of palms. A broad timber ramp provides access on the south-west corner into the heart of this sanctuary site. Appended to the Kiosk in 1989 to the north-west is the former shop, which currently serves as the main entrance to the sanctuary and is planned around two partial octagons, one opening toward the street, and the other at the western end opening into the lorikeet-feeding arena. Further to the west along Tomewin Street, and also part of the 1989 Kiosk development project, is a stone-faced platform supporting a shade structure and some seating. Beyond these to the west is the Honey House, which has a room where the lorikeet food is prepared; and a large steel-framed aviary (Forest Fringe Aviary, 1990). These structures are not considered to be of significance. Behind these structures, but still visible from Tomewin Street, is the lorikeet-feeding arena. It comprises a section of ground shaped like a rectangle with rounded ends and separated from the surrounding ground by a low steel fence. The largely flat surrounding surface falls to a drainage line inside this fence before levelling out in the centre. This drainage zone is concreted. Inside an outer ring of grass is a rockery. At either ends are the painted steel, lorikeet-feeding Ferris wheels, which were a signature of the early sanctuary and its bird-feeding displays. While these are later constructions they closely resemble those designed and used by Alex Griffiths. The area also has a few small trees, two clipped hedge shrubs and some other ground cover plantings within the arena. Beyond the narrow strip of concrete that falls outside the fence-line the ground is covered with artificial turf. The lorikeet-feeding arena forms part of a larger internal open space that constitutes the visitor's first experience of the sanctuary and is bounded to the north-west and east by the structures already described. On its south- eastern side is the entrance to the octagonally planned Spirit of the Outback store (former Rock Shop, 1964). There are a number of mature trees in this area, including eucalypts, as well as some areas of lawn and paving concentrated around the decks to the cafe and leading to various connections on the edges of the space. Adjacent to the Kiosk building, against the south- eastern boundary of the site, sits a large steel-framed and wire-mesh-enclosed aviary housing nocturnal birds and animals (pre-1970, refurbished in 1987 as the Rainforest Pool Aviary). This features a rock wall and small waterfall. A length of miniature train track runs through a fence opposite this aviary and up to the concrete block structure described earlier. This marks an earlier course of the miniature train line. The Spirit of the Outback store (former Rock Shop) is founded on a concrete slab with a sloping skirt around the entire building and expressed columns at each wall joint, which hide the downpipes. These consist of a concrete casing. It has a hipped roof clad in corrugated steel and walls faced with stone. Its wide fascia panels and eaves are lined with fibrous-cement sheeting. Inside there is a cathedral ceiling with fibrous-cement sheeting behind narrow timber rafters. The walls are also lined with fibrous-cement sheeting. A south-facing doorway in the former Rock Shop allows visitors into the sanctuary. To the immediate east of this doorway stands the annex built in 1965 to a rectangular plan but with similar materials. To the south-west of this is situated the main train station platform. To the south is the landing of an elevated timber walkway leading into the south-eastern corner of the site and then into the Green Cauldron enclosure, which sits near the site's southern boundary and incorporates at least two earlier building phases carried out after the early 1980s. The Green Guardian Theatre building (1990) sits between this structure and the main train platform. The last four structures are not considered of significance. In the south-eastern corner of the site, visible only to visitors on the walkway, is a fibrous-cement clad building, likely to be one of the oldest structures on the site. It is octagonal in plan and has a concertinaed, hip and valley roof made with flat fibrous-cement sheets and barge boards individual to each roof face. Its walls are similarly clad. It has a number of aluminium-framed, sliding windows. The timber walkway area is shaded by a number of mature trees, which shelter this structure from potentially damaging hail and wind. It sits behind a high chain-wire and thatched fence. To the west the site is bounded by a wide avenue of paving beside a screen of paperbarks (Melaleuca sp.) and gum trees (Eucalyptus sp.) lining the lorikeet habitat of Flat Rock Creek. Between it and the lorikeet-feeding arena are a number of enclosures housing koalas. To the east is the entrance to the Green Guardian Theatre (1990). Toward the north-west, the paved way leads to the concrete tunnel () that joins the eastern and western sides of the sanctuary. Two small residential allotments and a concreted laneway on Teemangum Street (the latter providing service access to the Kiosk building) are also included within the heritage boundary. A single-storeyed fibrous-cement clad house, where Alex Griffiths chiefly resided between 1971 and 1998, with an attached shop, sits on one of these allotments, but is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance for the purposes of this entry in the Queensland heritage register.  East of the highway and north of Tomewin Street  On the north-west side of Tomewin Street is a further area of sanctuary land totalling about . This contains the sanctuary's car parking facilities fronting Tomewin Street and adjacent to a commercial development on the west, and between the car park and a private hospital to the north, a large grassed and treed picnic area. There are some mature trees on the car park site, including a hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) at the entrance, paperbarks (Melaleuca sp.) and mature Moreton Bay figs (Ficus macrophylla).  Reserves  The reserve lands along Flat Rock Creek total about . A number of lagoons exist here, and form a bird habitat. There is a further leased reserve of just over for a tunnel under the Gold Coast Highway, linking the formally laid out eastern side of the main sanctuary with the more informally designed Western Reserve. The tunnel, constructed of reinforced concrete, is approximately wide and high, and accommodates a miniature train track and paved pedestrian pathway.  Western Reserve  The Western Reserve, totalling about of heavily treed land on the western side of the Gold Coast Highway, supports a number of the sanctuary's key tourist attractions. Only those facilities associated with Alex Griffith's management of the site are considered to be of cultural heritage significance. The site slopes steeply to the west and north from low-lying areas along the eastern and southern boundaries where Flat Rock Creek winds its way toward the ocean. Bounded by Currumbin Hill Conservation Park to the north-east, it is otherwise enclosed by residential allotments along the north-western ridge topped by Lansell Avenue and along the western and southern curve of Crest Avenue. It meets Thrower Drive in the north and borders Crest Drive where it forms a south-west-facing corner. The residences on the north-western side of Farrell Drive also border the sanctuary and the long thin lake or lagoon formed by Flat Rock Creek. Emerging from the tunnel leading from the eastern side of the sanctuary, a miniature train line loops around the largely flat areas along Flat Rock Creek, dividing near a spot name Koala Junction to head north and south. Pathways lead visitors west from the tunnel through a vegetated zone on the northern side of the creek. Further west is a junction of paths and rail lines, to the south-west of which is the Koala Junction Kiosk and amenities block. These buildings are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. To the north of Koala Junction are a number of post-1976 structures, enclosures and animal displays, again not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. These include an early 1990s building that provides access to the Extreme Green Challenge on the slopes behind it to the west, and the animal displays in the north-western corner of this site. At the highest point on this side of the Western Reserve there is a timber-framed and decked lookout that can be accessed via steep stairs. It takes in a view of the ocean and some of the residential development on Currumbin Hill and to the south-east around Tugun. It is a structure planned for but not carried out by Alex Griffiths. Paths wind back down the slope to the south-east and onto a path that passes three steel-tube- framed aviaries on its way down the slope. At the end of this path are the various other animal enclosures; again, these are not of heritage significance. The area of land to the west of these paths and enclosures that borders the upper part of Crest Drive and Lansell Avenue is the most heavily treed, with a range of Australian indigenous species. Beyond it, in the south and south-western corners of the Western Reserve, are a series of small ponds or dams (extant when Griffiths purchased the land in 1968) along a watercourse that joins Flat Rock Creek from the west. The train line loops through this system of ponds, over a steel bridge reputedly installed by Griffiths after he had purchased this property. The paths lead along the southern edge of these lakes, under a number of mature trees, to a timber viewing platform and small tea-house building. At the southern end of the Western Reserve, below the chain of artificially created ponds that lead into Flat Rock Creek, are a number of structures not considered to be of cultural heritage significance: three disused timber and concrete block aviaries; an amphitheatre consisting of stepped seating; a former cafe; and some animal enclosures. = Coolamon = Coolamon comprises four allotments, totalling almost of land, located in the Currumbin Valley about halfway between the headwaters of Currumbin Creek and the ocean into which it drains, where Currumbin Creek Road turns toward the Queensland and New South Wales border about one and a half kilometres from the site to the south. Nicoll Scrub National Park adjoins the southernmost allotment to the south-east. There are two gated access points, one to the north, which follows an easement to the main body of the site, and another, the main entrance adjacent to a picnic ground in the south-west. The latter entrance is signed and comprises a steel-framed gate with chain-wire infill set within two tall steel posts and panels of ribbed metal sheeting, which provides access to a section of bitumen roadway. Elsewhere the site is fenced by chain-wire. Adjacent to this gate to the north-west is a toilet block overgrown by vegetation. Opposite this structure and across the roadway a grassed picnic area stretches toward the south. Beyond this are the remains of a timber bridge. A caravan sits at the southern end of the grassed area. Coolamon has in the recent past provided picnic facilities to visitors but currently only serves as a release area for birds and other native animals treated at the sanctuary's hospital (the latter is not located within the heritage boundary).  Heritage listing  Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, established by Alex Griffiths in 1947 as the Currumbin Bird Sanctuary, is important in demonstrating the evolution of nature-based tourism in Queensland. It is an early surviving attraction at the Gold Coast, Queensland's premiere tourism destination, and one of the earliest nature- based tourist facilities established in Queensland, evolving from a site of local interest and the public spectacle of lorikeet-feeding to an internationally recognised nature-based tourism attraction. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As an iconic Queensland tourist destination, Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary has had a strong association as an attractive nature-based tourism experience for the large community of Queenslanders who have visited the site since 1947, when the afternoon lorikeet-feeding spectacle was established by Alex Griffiths. The strength and endurance of this association are powerfully demonstrated by its featuring in tourism advertising since 1953 or earlier; by the widespread community support for the sanctuary demonstrated in 1956 when hundreds of people signed a petition objecting to proposed sandmining adjacent to it; by inclusion in the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland's \\"150 must do's\\" in Queensland in 2009; and being voted by the community as one of the top 15 iconic Queensland locations during the 2009 State sesquicentenary celebrations. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary has a special association with the life work of Alex Griffiths who established the sanctuary in 1947 and remained involved in its ongoing management into the early 1980s, after gifting the sanctuary to the National Trust of Queensland (the Trust) in 1976. Important surviving elements of Griffiths' pre-1976 tourism venture include: the Kiosk; the Spirit of the Outback Store (former Rock Shop) and its annex; an aviary; an early bird hospital; the site of the lorikeet-feeding arena; the concept of the miniature railway circuit and much of the original railway on both the Tomewin Street site and the Western Reserve; the tunnel beneath the Gold Coast Highway; the informally laid out Western Reserve; the bird habitat along Flat Rock Creek; and the bird-release property known as Coolamon.  Awards  In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a \\"location\\".

Non-stop flights of 35 Israeli aircraft, including Israeli Air Force C-130s and El Al Boeing 747s, transported 14,325 Ethiopian Jews to Israel in 36 hours. One of the aircraft, an El Al 747, carried at least 1,088 people, including two babies who were born on the flight, and holds the world record for the most passengers on an aircraft.  History An abandoned synagogue on a Jewish village which became a tourist attraction after desertion of its inhabitants on 1991. No rural Jewish communities were left in Ethiopia after the transfer operation to Addis Ababa that had taken place between 1988 and 1991. Operation Solomon was the third Aliyah mission from Ethiopia to Israel. Before Operation Solomon, there was Operation Moses and Operation Joshua, which were two of the other ways that Ethiopian Jews could leave before they were forced to put an end to these type of programs. In between the time when these operations came to an end and Operation Solomon began, a very small number of Ethiopian Jews were able to leave and go to Israel. In 1991, the sitting Ethiopian government of Mengistu Haile Mariam was close to being toppled with the military successes of Eritrean and Tigrean rebels, threatening Ethiopia with dangerous political destabilization. World Jewish organizations, such as the American Association for Ethiopian Jews (AAEJ), and Israel were concerned about the well-being of the Ethiopian Jews, known as Beta Israel, residing in Ethiopia. The majority of them were living in the Gondar region of the Ethiopian Highlands and were mostly farmers and artisans. Also, the Mengistu regime had made mass emigration difficult for Beta Israel, and the regime's dwindling power presented an opportunity for those wanting to emigrate to Israel. In 1990, the Israeli government and Israeli Defense Forces, aware of Ethiopia‚Äôs worsening political situation, made covert plans to airlift the Jews to Israel. America became involved in the planning of Operation Solomon after it was brought to the US government's attention from American Jewish leaders from the American Association for Ethiopian Jews that the Ethiopian Jews were living in danger. The American government was also involved in the organization of the airlift. The decision of the Ethiopian government to allow all the Falshas to leave the country at once was largely motivated by a letter from President George H. W. Bush, who had some involvement with Operations Joshua and Moses. Previous to this, Mengistu intended to allow emigration only in exchange for weaponry. Also involved in the Israeli and Ethiopian governments' attempts to facilitate the operation was a group of American diplomats led by Senator Rudy Boschwitz, including Irvin Hicks, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs; Robert Frasure, the Director of the African Affairs at the White House National Security Council; and Robert Houdek the Charg√© d'Affaires of the United States Embassy in Addis Ababa. Boschwitz had been sent as a special emissary of President Bush, and he and his team met with the government of Ethiopia to aid Israel in the arranging of the airlift. In addition, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Herman Cohen also played an important role, as he was the international mediator of the civil war in Ethiopia. Cohen struck a deal with Mengistu that as long as Ethiopians would have an understanding with the rebels, change their human rights and emigration policy and change their communist economic practice. In response to the efforts of the diplomats, acting President of Ethiopia Tesfaye Gebre Kidan made the ultimate decision to allow the airlift. The negotiations surrounding the operation led to the eventual London roundtable discussions, which established a joint declaration by the Ethiopian combatants who then agreed to organize a conference to select a transitional government. $35 million was raised by the Jewish community to give to the government in Ethiopia so that the Jews could come over to Israel. The money went to the airport expenses in Addis Ababa.  Lead-up: Internal Debate within the Jewish community  In the decade leading up to the operation, there was a heated division within the Israeli community over whether to accept the Ethiopians. The reasoning against bringing in Ethiopians proved to be very diverse. Some Jews within Israel feared a \\"shanda fur di goyim\\" (Yiddish: ◊©◊ê◊†◊ì◊¢ ◊§÷ø◊ê◊® ◊ì◊ô ◊í◊ï◊ô◊ô◊ù embarrassment in front of the non-Jews), and thus aimed to avoid the issue of stirring up controversy by ignoring the pleas of the Ethiopian Jews. Others advocated for the operation, but avoided public demonstrations that might lead to arrests and further public controversy. Taking a completely different approach, others within the Israeli community claimed that there was a cultural divide which would make the integration process untenable; these included Director General of the Jewish Agency's Department of Immigration and Absorption Yehuda Dominitz, who likened this displacement to \\"taking a fish out of water\\". Still others elaborated on this vague notion with more provocative claims, such as World Zionist Organization writer Malkah Raymist, who argued that the Ethiopians' \\"mental outlook is that of children... It would take several years before they could be educated towards a minimum of progressive thinking.\\" However, ultimately, these counter arguments were in vain, as the Israeli government went ahead and conducted the airlift anyway, and the jubilant Ethiopians were greeted as they exited the planes by thousands of joyous Israelis.  Operation  Olim stepping out of the IAF's Hercules, May 25, 1991 The operation was overseen by the Prime Minister at the time, Yitzhak Shamir. It was kept secret by military censorship. Operation Solomon was sped up with tremendous help from the AAEJ. In 1989, the AAEJ accelerated the process of the Aliyah because Ethiopian-Israeli relations were in the right place. Susan Pollack, who was the director of the AAEJ in Addis Ababa, fought for Operation Solomon to happen sooner rather than later. Israel, who had a gradual plan for this operation, and the US were given a graphic report from Pollack that informed both countries of the terrible conditions that the Ethiopian Jews were living in. The organization went right ahead and got transportation like buses and trucks to have the people of Gondar quickly come to Addis Ababa. To get the Jews in Addis Ababa, many of the Jews that came from Gondar had to venture hundreds of miles by car, horses, and by foot. Some had things taken by thieves on the way, and some were even killed. By December 1989, around 2,000 Ethiopian Jews made their way by foot from their village in the Gondar highlands to the capital and many more came to join them by 1991. In order to accommodate as many people as possible, airplanes were stripped of their seats, and due to the low body weight and minimal baggage of the refugees, up to 1,086 passengers were boarded on a single plane. May 24, 1991 also happened to be a Friday, which begins the Jewish Shabbat, during which transportation is not normally used. This made more vehicles available for the mission, as Jewish religious law permits breaking the Sabbath traditions for saving lives. Many of the immigrants came with nothing except their clothes and cooking instruments, and were met by ambulances, with 140 frail passengers receiving medical care on the tarmac. Several pregnant women gave birth on the plane, and they and their babies were rushed to the hospital. Before Operation Solomon took place, many of the Jews there were at a high risk of infection from diseases, especially HIV. The Jews that were left behind had an even higher risk at the infection because the rate of it kept increasing. After a few months, around 20,000 Jews had made their way over. While they were there, they were struggling for basic resources like food and warmth. They thought they would see their families right away. Upon arrival, the passengers cheered and rejoiced. Twenty-nine-year-old Mukat Abag said, \\"We didn't bring any of our clothes, we didn't bring any of our things, but we are very glad to be here.\\" Operation Solomon airlifted almost twice as many Ethiopian Jews to Israel as Operation Moses. Between 1990 and 1999, over 39,000 Ethiopian Jews entered Israel. =World record= The operation set a world record for most passengers on an aircraft when an El Al 747 carried well over 1,000 people to Israel. The record itself is uncontested, but the number of passengers is unclear: Guinness World Records put the number at 1,088, including two babies who were born on the flight. It noted that contemporary reports cite numbers as low as 1,078 and as high as 1,122.Cf. Lungen, Paul. Canadian Jewish News, November 17, 2005.  Aftermath: Socio-economic strife  Since being transported to Israel, the vast majority of these Beta Israel transfers have struggled to find work within the region. 2006 estimates suggest that up to 80 percent of adult immigrants from Ethiopia are unemployed and forced to live off national welfare payments. Unemployment figures improved significantly by 2016, with only 20 percent of men and 26 percent of women being unemployed.https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/ethiopian-jews-suffer-racism- in-israel/1526782 This struggle can be explained by a number of potential factors. Firstly, the transition from the rural, largely illiterate lands of Ethiopia to a highly urban workforce in Israel has proved difficult, especially when considering the fact that most Ethiopian Jews do not speak Hebrew and are in competition with other, more highly skilled immigrant workers. Nevertheless, the fact that the younger generations of Ethiopian Israelites, who have grown up and been educated in Israel and possess graduate degrees and more forms of formal training, still have a disproportionate amount of trouble finding work suggests that other factors may be at play, including potential racial or even religious bias, given that there has been debate over whether or not Ethiopian Jews should be considered Jewish in the first place.

The ionic strength of a solution is a measure of the concentration of ions in that solution. Ionic compounds, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions. The total electrolyte concentration in solution will affect important properties such as the dissociation constant or the solubility of different salts. One of the main characteristics of a solution with dissolved ions is the ionic strength. Ionic strength can be molar (mol/L solution) or molal (mol/kg solvent) and to avoid confusion the units should be stated explicitly. Quantifying ionic strength The molar ionic strength, I, of a solution is a function of the concentration of all ions present in that solution. :I = \\\\begin{matrix}\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\end{matrix}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i z_i^{2} where one half is because we are including both cations and anions, ci is the molar concentration of ion i (M, mol/L), zi is the charge number of that ion, and the sum is taken over all ions in the solution. For a 1:1 electrolyte such as sodium chloride, where each ion is singly-charged, the ionic strength is equal to the concentration. For the electrolyte MgSO4, however, each ion is doubly- charged, leading to an ionic strength that is four times higher than an equivalent concentration of sodium chloride: :I = \\\\frac{1}{2}[c(+2)^2+c(-2)^2] = \\\\frac{1}{2}[4c + 4c] = 4c Generally multivalent ions contribute strongly to the ionic strength. =Calculation example= As a more complex example, the ionic strength of a mixed solution 0.050 M in Na2SO4 and 0.020 M in KCl is: : \\\\begin{align} I & = \\\\tfrac 1 2 \\\\times \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{l} \\\\\\\\{(\\\\text{concentration of }\\\\ce{Na2SO4}\\\\text{ in M}) \\\\times (\\\\text{number of }\\\\ce{Na+}) \\\\times (\\\\text{charge of }\\\\ce{Na})^2\\\\\\\\}\\\\ +  \\\\\\\\{(\\\\text{concentration of }\\\\ce{Na2SO4}\\\\text{ in M}) \\\\times (\\\\text{number of }\\\\ce{SO4^2-}) \\\\times (\\\\text{charge of }\\\\ce{SO4})^2\\\\\\\\} \\\\ +  \\\\\\\\{(\\\\text{concentration of }\\\\ce{KCl}\\\\text{ in M}) \\\\times (\\\\text{number of }\\\\ce{K+}) \\\\times (\\\\text{charge of }\\\\ce{K})^2\\\\\\\\}\\\\ +  \\\\\\\\{(\\\\text{concentration of }\\\\ce{KCl}\\\\text{ in M}) \\\\times (\\\\text{number of }\\\\ce{Cl-}) \\\\times (\\\\text{charge of }\\\\ce{Cl})^2\\\\\\\\} \\\\end{array}\\\\right]  & = \\\\tfrac 1 2 \\\\times [\\\\\\\\{0.050 M \\\\times 2 \\\\times (+1)^2\\\\\\\\} + \\\\\\\\{0.050 M \\\\times 1 \\\\times (-2)^2\\\\\\\\} + \\\\\\\\{0.020 M \\\\times 1 \\\\times (+1)^2\\\\\\\\} + \\\\\\\\{0.020 M \\\\times 1 \\\\times (-1)^2\\\\\\\\}]  & = 0.17 M \\\\end{align} Non-ideal solutions Because in non-ideal solutions volumes are no longer strictly additive it is often preferable to work with molality b (mol/kg of H2O) rather than molarity c (mol/L). In that case, molal ionic strength is defined as: : I = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{{i}=1}^{n} b_{i}z_{i}^{2} in which :i = ion identification number :z = charge of ion Importance The ionic strength plays a central role in the Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel theory that describes the strong deviations from ideality typically encountered in ionic solutions. It is also important for the theory of double layer and related electrokinetic phenomena and electroacoustic phenomena in colloids and other heterogeneous systems. That is, the Debye length, which is the inverse of the Debye parameter (Œ∫), is inversely proportional to the square root of the ionic strength. Both molar and molal ionic strength have been used, often without explicit definition. Debye length is characteristic of the double layer thickness. Increasing the concentration or valence of the counterions compresses the double layer and increases the electrical potential gradient. Media of high ionic strength are used in stability constant determination in order to minimize changes, during a titration, in the activity quotient of solutes at lower concentrations. Natural waters such as mineral water and seawater have often a non-negligible ionic strength due to the presence of dissolved salts which significantly affects their properties.

Some of his shipmates were Jacob Quaeckernaeck, Jan Joosten, and William Adams. Van Santvoort remained in Japan, where he spent 39 years as a merchant in Nagasaki. De Liefde (the Love, sometimes translated as the Charity) departed Rotterdam in 1598, on a trading voyage that was a five ship expedition to the East Indies. After making it through the Straits of Magellan, they became separated, but later rejoined the Hoop (Hope) off the coast of Chile, where some of the crew and captains of both vessels lost their lives in an encounter with natives. They decide to leave hostile Spanish waters and sell their woolen cloth cargo in Japan rather than in the warmer Moluccas. The two ships encountered a storm and Hoop was lost. With a decimated and sick crew (only 24 were still alive, and several were dying) the damaged De Liefde made landfall off Bungo (present-day Usuki) on the coast of Ky≈´sh≈´ in April 1600. Portuguese Jesuit missionary priests claimed that the ship was a pirate vessel and that the crew should be executed. The ship was seized on orders of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the daimy≈ç of Edo (Tokyo) and the future sh≈çgun, and later the crew was ordered to sail her to Sakai (near Osaka) and then on to Edo. Some of them were received by Tokugawa Ieyasu, who questioned them at length on European politics, wars and foreign affairs. The crew eventually went separate ways when some decided they should split the money provided as compensation for their losses of the ship and cargo.Letters Written by the English Residents in Japan, 1611-1623, with Other Documents on the English Trading Settlement in Japan in the Seventeenth Century, N.

The nineteen bronze cannons were unloaded from the ship and, according to Spanish accounts, later used at the decisive Battle of Sekigahara on October 21, 1600 (between Tokogawa forces and their rivals).http://www.engelfriet.net/Alie/Aad/deshima1.htm Van Santvoort was allowed to leave Japan with De Liefde's Captain Jacob Quaeckernaeck in 1604 on a Red Seal Ship, provided by the daimy≈ç of Hirado, for Pattani in the Malay Peninsula. They had letters from the Japanese with an invitation for the Dutch to come trade. At Pattani, Quaeckernaeck joined the fleet of Cornelis Matelief de Jonge, his compatriot and relative, on August 19, 1606. Quaeckernaeck died however in a naval engagement when Matelief destroyed the Portuguese armada near Malacca on September 21, 1606.History of Holland ‚Äì Chapter VI: The Beginnings of the Dutch Republic (by George Edmundson) The head of the Pattani Dutch trading post, Victor Sprinckel, initially refused to take up the offer of trade with Japan since he was too busy dealing with Portuguese opposition in Southeast Asia. Van Santvoort was only able to return to Japan in 1609, in the company of Jacques Specx, a Dutch merchant with a cargo he wished to sell in Hirado. Once they arrived van Santvoort served as interpreter. He assisted the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, VOC) envoys, Abraham van den Brock and Nicolas Puyck during their diplomatic mission to visit the Sh≈çgun in Sumpu and in Edo. At Edo William Adams, van Santvoort's former shipmate and a hatamoto (samurai who was a direct retainer of the Sh≈çgun), negotiated on behalf of the emissaries. The mission was well received and resulted in permission to establish a trading post in Hirado. Van Santvoort together with another former crewmember of De Liefde, Jan Joosten (also a hatamoto), reportedly made a fortune in trade between Japan and Southeast Asia. Both of them were reported by Dutch traders in the Ayutthaya Kingdom (Siam), onboard richly cargoed junks, in early 1613. Van Santvoort was also reported to have married ‚ÄúIsabella‚Äù a Japanese woman, the daughter of a carpenter. Van Santvoort's daughters married Pieter van Santen, Christy Villanueva, and Willem Verstegen. Van Santvoort operated his business in Nagasaki, but continued to maintain close contact with his compatriots in Hirado. However, the rule of Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Hidetada and his son, Tokugawa Iemitsu was increasingly hostile to foreign contact. Christianity was banned in 1614, and from 1634 the Dutch traders came into conflict with Chinese merchants in Nagasaki. In 1639, an order came from the Sh≈çgun that (with the exception of the VOC merchants at Dejima) all Europeans, their Japanese spouses, and any half-Japanese children were to be expelled from Japan. Van Santvoort left for Formosa (Taiwan) then went on to Batavia. Willem Verstegen married his daughter on Taiwan while on their way to Batavia. Melchior van Santvoort died in Batavia in 1641.

The company was not organized until March 17, 1848, and on February 3, 1849, it was renamed the Jeffersonville Railroad. The first section, from Jeffersonville to just north of Memphis, Indiana, opened in 1850. The next year it leased the Knightstown and Shelbyville Railroad, starting to operate it in 1852. The line opened north to Columbus in August 1852, and on September 1, 1852, it began operating the Rushville and Shelbyville Railroad under lease. On January 27, 1836, an act of the Indiana General Assembly established Indiana's first railroad to actually be built. Construction began on the state-owned Madison and Indianapolis Railroad on September 16, 1836. After building only from Madison to Queensville (just northwest of North Vernon in Jennings County) by 1841, the railroad was transferred to private ownership on June 20, 1842, as the Madison and Indianapolis Railroad Company. This entity completed the remainder of the line from Queensville to Indianapolis, a distance of , by 1847. Although it was successful for more than a decade, it went into decline, was sold at foreclosure on March 27, 1862, and renamed the Indianapolis and Madison Railroad (I&M;). The successor company abandoned the M&I;'s of trackage between Columbus and Edinburgh in 1864 and began running over the Jeffersonville Railroad's nearby tracks. Organized on April 30, 1866, for the purpose of uniting the two lines, the Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad Company (JM&I;) absorbed the Indianapolis & Madison the next day, with the Jeffersonville Railroad being officially merged in on June 1 of that same year, upon the filing of the Articles of Consolidation. On May 22, 1868, the Reno Gang held up the JM&I; Railroad train at Marshfield, Scott County, Indiana, and escaped with $90,000 in cash described as being in \\"new notes.\\" The money was never officially recovered and in today's value, represented more than $2 million.

Any profits earned by a mutual insurance company are either retained within the company or rebated to policyholders in the form of dividend distributions or reduced future premiums. In contrast, a stock insurance company is owned by investors who have purchased company stock; any profits generated by a stock insurance company are distributed to the investors without necessarily benefiting the policyholders.  History  The concept of mutual insurance originated in England in the late 17th century to cover losses due to fire. The mutual/casualty insurance industry began in the United States in 1752 when Benjamin Franklin established the Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses From Loss by Fire. Mutual property/casualty insurance companies exist now in nearly every country around the globe. The global trade association for the industry, the International Cooperative and Mutual Insurance Federation, claims 216 members in 74 countries, in turn representing over 400 insurers. In North America the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies (NAMIC), founded in 1895, is the sole representative of U.S. and Canadian mutual insurance companies in the areas of advocacy and education.  Recent developments in the United States  The \\"mutual holding company\\" structure was first introduced in Iowa in 1995, and has spread since then.Banstetter et al. (1997). The Mutual Holding Company: A New Structural Option.

The term originated from early Greek and Roman poets, who used it to refer to a time when mankind lived in a better time and was pure (see Golden Age). The ancient Greek philosopher Hesiod introduced the term in his Works and Days, when referring to the period when the \\"Golden Race\\" of man lived. This was part of fivefold division of Ages of Man, starting with the Golden age, then the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, the Age of Heroes (including the Trojan War), and finally, the current Iron Age. The concept was further refined by Ovid, in his Metamorphoses, into the four \\"metal ages\\" (golden, silver, bronze, and iron).Ovid, Metamorphoses. Trans. A.D. Melville. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986. pp. ix‚Äìxi The Golden age in Classic literature The Golden Age by Lucas Cranach the Elder, 1530 The Golden Age by Joachim Wtewael, 1605 The Golden age as described by Hesiod was an age where all humans were created directly by the Olympian gods. They did not have women in their ranks, and could not reproduce. They lived long lives in peace and harmony, and were oblivious of death. The \\"Golden race\\" were however mortals, but would die peacefully and in their sleep unmarked by sickness and age. Ovid emphasizes the justice and peace that defined the Golden Age. He described it as a time before man learned the art of navigation, and as a pre-agricultural society. The idea of a Golden age lingered in literature and historical understanding throughout the Greek and Roman periods. It was partly replaced by the Christian Six Ages of the World based on the biblical chronology in the early Middle Ages. Evolution from period to metaphor The term \\"Golden age\\" has always had a metaphoric element. A few centuries after Hesiod, Plato pointed out that the \\"Golden race\\" were not made from gold as such, but that the term should be understood metaphorically. The classical idea of the \\"metal ages\\" as actual historical periods held sway throughout the Greek and Roman periods. While supplemented by St. Augustine's \\"Six Ages of the World\\", the classical ideas were never entirely eradicated, and it resurfaced to form the basis of division of time in early archaeology. At the birth of modern archaeology in the 18th century, the \\"Golden age\\" was associated with a pre-agricultural society. However, already in the 16th century, the term \\"Golden age\\" was replaced by \\"Stone Age\\" in the three-age system. Still, Rousseau used the term for a loosely defined historical period characterized by the \\"State of nature\\" as late as the during the late 18th century. While the concept of an Iron and Bronze Age are still used by historians and archaeologists, the \\"Golden age\\" of Hesiod was a purely mythical period, and has come to signify any period in history where the state of affairs for a specific phenomenon appear to have been on their height, better than in the periods proceeding it and following the \\"Golden Age\\". It is sometimes still employed for the hunter-gatherer tribal societies of the Mesolithic, but only as a metaphor.

In their paper Boender et al. describe their method as a stochastic method involving a combination of sampling, clustering and local search, terminating with a range of confidence intervals on the value of the global minimum. The algorithm of Boender et al. has been modified by Timmer. Timmer considered several clustering methods. Based on experiments a method named \\"multi level single linkage\\" was deemed most accurate. Csendes' algorithms are implementations of the algorithm of [Boender et al.] and originated the public domain software product GLOBAL. The local algorithms used are a random direction, linear search algorithm also used by T√∂rn, and a quasi‚ÄîNewton algorithm not using the derivative of the function. The results show the dependence of the result on the auxiliary local algorithm used.  Background  Extending the class of functions to include multimodal functions makes the global optimization problem unsolvable in general. In order to be solvable some smoothness condition on the function in addition to continuity must be known. The existence of several local minima and unsolvability in general are important characteristics of global optimization. Unsolvability here means that a solution cannot be guaranteed in a finite number of steps. There are two ways to deal with the unsolvability problem. First, \\"a priori\\" conditions on f and A are posed which turns the problem into a solvable one or at least makes it possible to tell for sure that a solution has been found. This restricts the function class that is considered. The second approach which allows a larger class of objective functions to be considered is to give up the solvability requirement and only try to obtain an estimate of the global minimum. In this \\"probabilistic\\" approach it would be desirable also to obtain some results on the goodness of an obtained estimate. Some of the solvable problems may fall in this class because the number of steps required for a guaranteed solution might be prohibitively large. When relaxing the requirement on solvability it seems rational to require that the probability that a solution is obtained approaches 1 if the procedure is allowed to continue forever. An obvious probabilistic global search procedure is to use a local algorithm starting from several points distributed over the whole optimization region. This procedure is named \\"Multistart\\". Multistart is certainly one of the earliest global procedures used. It has even been used in local optimization for increasing the confidence in the obtained solution. One drawback of Multistart is that when many starting points are used the same minimum will eventually be determined several times. In order to improve the efficiency of Multistart this should be avoided. Clustering methods are used to avoid this repeated determination of local minima. This is realized in three steps which may be iteratively used. The three steps are: * (a) Sample points in the region of interest. * (b) Transform the sample to obtain points grouped around the local minima. * (c) Use a clustering technique to recognize these groups (i.e. neighbourhoods of the local minima). If the procedure employing these steps is successful then starting a single local optimization from each cluster would determine the local minima and thus also the global minimum. The advantage in using this approach is that the work spared by computing each minimum just once can be spent on computations in (a) and (b), which will increase the probability that the global minimum will be found. Being a clustering method, their effectiveness is higher for low-dimensional problems and become less effective for problems having a few hundred variables.

It was the first legal casino to open in the Australian Capital Territory, built on land excised from Glebe Park under a 99-year lease agreement between the casino licensee and the territory government. It is small in comparison with other casinos in Australia and does not incorporate any hotel accommodation, theatres, auditoriums or retail stores. It is the only casino in Australia not licensed to operate poker machines. There are 39 gaming tables where blackjack, roulette, baccarat and other games are played. The casino also has a poker lounge and sports lounge with TAB facilities. A rewards program, \\"Advantage\\", allows members to earn points which can be redeemed for prizes, at the casino's restaurant, Natural nine or selected hotels and businesses in the city. Advantage members are entitled to secure parking and entry into gaming tournaments hosted by the casino. History Following permission from the Federal Government to issue a casino licence and despite strong opposition from Dr Hector Kinloch of the Residents Rally, Casinos Austria International was selected by the ACT Government as the preferred operator on 31 January 1992. A subsidiary company, Casino Canberra Limited was formed for this purpose. In exchange for the licence, Casinos Austria paid $19 million up front for lease of the land and an annual $500,000 licensing fee. A temporary casino began operation on 14 November 1992 at the National Convention Centre. The permanent casino opened on 29 July 1994. Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and the ACT Chief Minister Rosemary Follett were among the guests at the large opening party hosted by Dr Leo Walner, then head of Casinos Austria. Bob Hawke was the winner of the golden roulette ball that was used for the first spin of the roulette wheel in the temporary casino. The Aquis Group controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Tony Fung acquired the casino in 2014.Aquis acquires Canberra casino News. 23 December 2014 Licence restrictions Casino Canberra holds the only licence to operate gambling tables in the Australian Capital Territory. Unlike other Australian casinos, it cannot operate poker machines. The casino has previously tried unsuccessfully to lobby the territory government to remove restrictions that prevent it from installing poker machines. These attempts have failed, in part due to concerns from Canberra's clubs, which fear loss of revenue from their own poker machines. Amendments to the Casino Control Act (2006) which would allow the casino to operate poker machines have been unsuccessfully moved in the legislative assembly on two occasions. In March 2013, it was reported by The Canberra Times, amid concerns about its ongoing viability, that the casino was willing to hand back land to the government that would allow the National Convention Centre to be expanded, and pay upfront fees in exchange for licensing rights for 200 machines. In May 2016, following submission of a proposal to massively redevelop the Casino site in exchange for the right to possess 500 poker machine licences, an in- principal agreement was reached with the Chief Minister Andrew Barr. The agreement centred on the possible use of 200 poker machines but only after redevelopment had been completed and only if the poker machine licences were purchased from owners of existing machines under the poker machine cap.

Hosted by G√∂ran Elwin, It dealt with various social issues, featuring both experts and regular people.  The Videov√•ld scandal  Despite covering many issues, the show is now mainly known (and infamous) for an episode broadcast on December 2, 1980 entitled \\"Vem beh√∂ver videon (who needs video)?\\". The episode raised concerns over violent movies on video and the notion that they were being viewed by children. Reporters interviewed children who claimed that they had seen movies such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and showed that children could easily rent violent videos. They then held a debate on how to deal with the issue, featuring a group of parents who all agreed that they couldn't stop their children from viewing these movies. Representing the government of Sweden was the Swedish Minister of Education Jan-Erik Wikstr√∂m (fp) who wanted a ban but stressed that it required a change in the constitution of Sweden. The episode spawned the buzzword videov√•ld (lit Video- violence), and a major moral panic that would shape public perception and even influence new laws. In the end the movies demonized by the show were more helped than harmed, as the exposure made them famous. Today the whole thing is widely regarded as an example of sensationalism and the videov√•ld controversy is mostly over. The Swedish DVD-cover for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre even mentions the episode and proudly claims to have been \\"the most hated movie in Sweden!\\". Because of its cultural significance, the episode has become a cult item among film enthusiasts who see it both as an important document on the issue of censorship, and as unintentional comedy. It has been shown in film- festivals and is circulated as Bootlegs. A parallel can be made to the UK debate on Video Nasties.  Controversy  In 2002 Filmkr√∂nikan ran a feature on the old episode where two of the children (now 33 years old) featured in the original broadcast claimed that they had been bribed, and were forced to say that they had seen violent movies. Other parts of the episode were also criticized, including one segment were a little girl claimed that she couldn't sleep with the nightlight off after seeing one of the videos in question. Her parents found this strange since she didn't have a nightlight. A reporter who worked on Studio S wrote an angry open letter where he denounced the feature as bad journalism, denying that the children were forced and that the harsh criticism of violent movies was valid. A representative of SVT denied the accusation.

Early life Juri≈°iƒá was born in Senj, Croatia. He is first mentioned in 1522 as an officer of Ferdinand I of Habsburg's troops deployed in Croatian forts in defense against the invasion of the Ottoman Empire under Suleiman I, advancing towards Vienna. Between 1522 and 1526, he obtained knighthood.Nikola Juri≈°iƒá in the Croatian Biographical Lexicon (in Croatian) After the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526, the king made him the supreme army commander of the armed forces defending the borders (supremus capitaneus, Veldhauptmann unseres Kriegsfolks wider Turken). Juri≈°iƒá in turn helped Ferdinand of Habsburg become the king of Croatia by brokering the 1527 election in Cetin. In 1530, Juri≈°iƒá was sent to Constantinople to negotiate with the Ottomans for peace. Siege of G√ºns (K≈ëszeg) in 1532 In 1532, Captain Nikola Juri≈°iƒá defended the small border fort of K≈ëszeg (Kingdom of Hungary) with only 700‚Äì800 Croatian soldiers with no cannons and few guns, preventing the advance of the Turkish army of 120,000‚Äì140,000 toward Vienna.Turnbull, Stephen. The Ottoman Empire 1326 ‚Äì 1699. New York: Osprey, 2003. pg 51 There are two versions of that battle. *In one version, after Suleiman I led an army of 140,000 towards Vienna, Nikola Juri≈°iƒá and his 800 soldiers responded to the calls of the Habsburg Emperor to defend the city. While passing through western Hungary they saw helpless women and children in the small fort of Koszeg, and decided to defend it. The fort was on the route to Vienna, so Suleiman II attacked it, and after three days of fighting Juri≈°iƒá wrote: \\"...I and 89 of my knights are tired and low on supplies. If we hold another day it will be a miracle...\\" Before the final charge women and children prayed to Saint Martin for two hours, and the final battle started. After ten minutes of battle the Turks retreated, and reported they saw a flaming knight with flaming sword. * In the second version, the city was offered terms for a nominal surrender. The only Ottomans who would be allowed to enter the castle would be a token force who would raise the Turkish flag. Suleiman withdrew at the arrival of the August rains and did not continue towards Vienna as previously planned, but homeward. He had been delayed nearly four weeks, and during this time a powerful army had been collected in Vienna, which the sultan did not intend to face. By their heroism, Nikola Juri≈°iƒá and his men had saved Vienna from a siege. Later life Following the 1537 Battle of Gorjani, he was again made the supremus capitaneus of Slavonia and Lower Austria. In 1540, he was the capitaneus of Carniola. He spent the last years of his life as a secret adviser at the court in Vienna. Juri≈°iƒá died in K≈ëszeg, Hungary.

Released by Studio !K7 in 1998 to glowing reviews, the album features two original songs among the remixes. Style The compilation album is a selection of remixes produced in the previous five years by either Richard Dorfmeister, Peter Kruder or the two together. The album also contains two original productions. Dorfmeister stated that they worked about two weeks on each remix. John Bush of AllMusic described the album's sound as \\"earthy, downtempo and acid-based, even more so than previous mix albums by the pair.\\" Release The K&D; Sessions was released on 5 October 1998 in both a two- disc CD set and a four-disc vinyl set by Studio !K7. On 28 February 1999, Kruder & Dorfmeister started on a ten city tour of North America to promote the album. After the release and success of the album, the group received several requests from artists for remixes, all of which they turned down. Dorfmeister stated that they had felt like they had \\"already done it,\\" adding: \\"I'd rather release nothing than something that is half and half. ... Perhaps we don't have so much output, but at least then we don't release some bullshit.\\" Reviews The K&D; Sessions received acclaim on its release. Spike Magazine gave the album a positive review, stating that it is \\"one of those albums that comes out of the blue, providing a whole bunch of surprises to make even the most jaded get excited about music again.\\" Spin felt that The K&D; Sessions has \\"less scope and vibrancy\\" than the duo's DJ Kicks album, but nonetheless praised it as a more consistent release. Spin later placed the album at number 19 on their list of top 20 albums of 1999. Music database AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five, opining that \\"the impossibly deep beats on almost every track simply couldn't have been recorded by any other act\\" and referring to the music as \\"the most blissfully blunted music the world has ever heard.\\" Feeling that the album was overlong, the NME gave the album a mixed review, asking \\"does the world really need to own both their reappraisals of Bomb the Bass' 'Bug Powder Dust', even if the first one is a corker?\\" Pitchfork also noted the length of the album referring to the second disc as \\"thoroughly boring\\", but praising the album stating \\"a handful of the tracks on this sprawling two-CD set demonstrate a mastery of rhythm unseen in DJ'd music since DJ Shadow bestowed upon us the gift of Endtroducing......

Career  The Kruder & Dorfmeister releases DJ-Kicks: Kruder & Dorfmeister (!K7, 1996) and The K&D; Sessions (!K7, 1998) are considered pioneering in electronic music. The sound that was formulated became known as downtempo, showing that electronic music need not be confined to cold sounds and metallic beats but could embody sensuality and a deep soulfulness. Both releases have been global bestsellers, with K&D; Sessions having sold more than one million copies worldwide and being considered one of the most influential albums of the 1990s.http://www.ambientmusicguide.com/pages/K/k&d.php; In parallel to his partnership with Dorfmeister, Peter Kruder has also followed his solo projects.

A renowned anti-colonial activist, he campaigned for the restoration of multi-party democracy in Kenya in his later years. He was a ruthless negotiator and a proponent of peaceful but focused politics. He had a reputation for integrity rivaled only by Ronald Ngala. Considered by some as one of the best leaders that never became president, it has been speculated that had he not died, he may have beaten Daniel arap Moi for the presidency in 1992. Early life Henry Pius Masinde Muliro was born in Kimilili area of Kenya, the son of Muliro Kisingilie and his wife Makinia. His parents died when he was young, and he was brought up by an older stepbrother, Aibu Naburuku. After elementary and high school studies in Kenya and Uganda, he joined the University of Cape Town in South Africa in 1949. He enrolled for a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, History and Political Philosophy, and graduated in 1953 with degrees in Arts and Education. In 1954 he returned home with a South African wife, and taught for a while at a government school. In 1957, he quit his job to join politics. Politics In 1948, Muliro had joined the Kenya African Union (KAU), a body formed to champion the interests of Africans in colonial Kenya. When he quit teaching in 1957, he contested the Nyanza North Legislative Council seat which was then held by W.W.W. Awori (Elder brother of the former Kenyan vice president Moody Awori). Muliro won the election. Among his fellow legislators were Daniel arap Moi representing the Rift valley, Tom Mboya representing Nairobi area, Bernard Mate representing Central Province, Ronald Ngala representing Coast Province, James Nzau Muimi representing Eastern Province, Lawrence Oguda representing Nyanza South, and Oginga Odinga representing Nyanza Central. In 1958 Muliro formed the Kenya National Party with the support of 9 Legco members. He later on dissolved his party to join the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU). He was subsequently appointed minister of commerce just before Kenya gained independence in 1963. Muliro worked in various positions in later governments, but was frequently on the wrong side of President Jomo Kenyatta. After Kenyatta's death, Muliro went back to Parliament after winning a petition in court. He served as the Kitale East Constituency until 1988, when the constituency was split up and contested the newly created Cherangany Constituency parliamentary seat in 1988, but lost to John Rotich who held the position only for two years. At the 1990 by-elections, the Cherangany seat was won by Kipruto Rono Arap Kirwa.Center for Multiparty Democracy: Politics and Parliamentarians in Kenya 1944‚Äì2007 Multi-Party Campaign In 1989, Muliro teamed up with Kenneth Matiba, Charles Rubia, Martin Shikuku, Phillip Gachoka and Oginga Odinga to form FORD (Forum for restoration of democracy), a pressure-group agitating for a return to pluralist politics. After violent clashes pitting FORD supporters against police and government supporters, the KANU government accepted multi-partysm in 1991. FORD became a party with Muliro as its vice chairman. Disagreements soon cropped up with two main rivals Oginga Odinga and Kenneth Matiba each wanting to run for presidency and not wanting to listen to reason. It was Shortly after this that Muliro left for London for a fundraising mission for the newly formed Ford political party. It was to be an ill-fated trip: on his return, upon his arrival at the Nairobi airport on the morning of August 14, 1992 he collapsed and died. The controversy of his death was heightened by the absence of an official post mortem. Muliro was buried on his farm in the Kitale area of Kenya. The party, then split into two factions after Muliro died due to a disagreement on who was to run for the presidency against President Moi. Kenneth Matiba and Martin Shikuku claiming that they are the real owners of Ford splitting to form Ford Asili and Odinga and others forming Ford Kenya. Had Masinde Muliro not died, the original FORD would have remained united and possibly would have removed president Moi in 1992. References *Simiyu Wandiiba.

Broadcasting from a transmitter site in Secaucus, New Jersey, WWRL airs an Indian music format as an affiliate of Radio Mirchi. It is owned by Nimisha and Jeetendra Shukla through licensee NJ Broadcasting, LLC. Founded in 1926, WWRL originally had a multi-lingual format serving the various ethnic communities of New York City. The station took on a mostly Spanish identity in the 1950s, then became primarily oriented towards African Americans living in New York City in the mid-1960s, under the direction of News Director, Dick London, who invited community leaders to voice their concerns publicly on air, as the station became advocates for legislative change. The music and news advocacy was an integral part of the Black American community. WWRL played R&B; music from 1964 to 1982 before changing to gospel music and religious programming from 1982 to 1997. After a brief return to R&B; in the late 1990s, WWRL gradually de-emphasized music in favor of more talk radio programming. In 2006, WWRL replaced WLIB as the flagship station for the Air America Radio network and retained a progressive talk radio format for seven years. From 2014 to 2016, WWRL had a regional Mexican music format before changing to the current Indian programming. Transmitter building in Secaucus, New Jersey History =Early history (1926‚Äì1963)= Founded by radio enthusiast William Reuman, doing business as Woodside Radio Laboratory, WWRL began broadcasting at midnight on August 26, 1926 from a studio and transmitter located in his home at 41-30 58th Street in Woodside, Queens, New York on a frequency of 1160 kHz. The station later shared the 1120 kHz frequency with four other AM stations. In its first year of operation, WWRL broadcast live musical performances, usually from Reuman's friends and neighbors. Among them were Astoria singer Ethel Zimmerman, who would later achieve stardom as Ethel Merman. In 1927, the nascent Federal Radio Commission ordered the station to move to 1500 kHz, then the highest AM frequency. Reuman had also begun selling airtime to local merchants. Reuman incorporated as the Long Island Broadcasting Corporation in 1929. With the slogan \\"The Voice of Queens County,\\" WWRL began to broadcast programs in Italian, German, French, Polish, Hungarian, Slovak, and Czech, as well as English. Following implementation of the 1941 North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement the station again changed its frequency, first to 1490 kHz on April 29 that year, then within the year to the 1600 kHz, where the station remains to this day. In 1951 the station's city of license changed from Woodside to New York City. Most programs on the station were oriented towards Hispanic and black listeners, and Greek, Syrian, Irish, Ukrainian, Russian, and Scandinavian shows also joined the schedule. By decade's end, WWRL had a 24-hour broadcast day primarily in Spanish. Leading black disc jockeys joined the station, including Tommy Smalls (known as \\"Dr. Jive\\") and Hal Jackson. =R&B; format (1964‚Äì1982)= Egmont Sonderling bought WWRL from the retiring Reuman in January 1964 and changed its format to R&B.; WWRL was \\"the premier radio station serving New York's Black community\\" at the time, wrote Dan Charnas. Billboard magazine wrote in May 1964 that WWRL and black radio stations offered \\"specific information, personal identification[,] and entertainment not provided by other type stations.\\" DJ's for WWRL in the 1960s included Frankie Crocker and Jocko Henderson, whose \\"on-air shtick...was as important as the music they played.\\" The station was known as \\"The Big RL\\" in the 1960s and \\"Super 16\\" in the 1970s. WWRL's first year in its R&B; format included a three-hour gospel music show in the evenings. Billboard wrote in May 1964 that WWRL and other black radio stations \\"are monitored as a guide to which r.&b.; records could be popular with white audiences...[and] are exerting a great influence on the music played on contemporary and pop-contemporary formatted stations.\\" Beginning in May 1966, WWRL instituted an \\"integrated music programming policy\\" that added rock and pop hits in addition to R&B; to the playlist. By late 1967, however, WWRL began playing more blues tracks and those from lesser-known performers like Johnnie Taylor and Wilson Pickett, to distinguish itself from mainstream pop stations that had begun playing R&B.; A 1971 profile of WWRL by Billboard found that WWRL played \\"three oldies an hour from one of the largest vaults of soul music in the nation.\\" The Federal Communications Commission reprimanded Sonderling Broadcasting in May 1971 for allowing the Reverend James Lofton Jr. to use WWRL facilities to solicit money in exchange for tips for a numbers game. On June 5, 1972, WWRL simulcast with top-40 station WMCA from 8 to 10 p.m. for a special call-in program, Black and White, owing to WMCA focusing on a general audience in contrast to WWRL's primarily black audience. Briefly in the late 1970s, WWRL was an affiliate of the Mutual Black Network. In 1979, Sonderling Broadcasting merged with Viacom. WWRL carried sports talk programming from Enterprise Radio Network briefly in 1981, beginning on January 1. In an era when sports programming on radio was limited to live play-by-play, news briefs, and a select few call-in shows, Enterprise was described as an \\"abortive attempt to launch the all-sports format\\" and shut down before year's end. By the spring of 1981, WWRL went back to playing music. =Religious and community station (1982‚Äì1997)= In 1982, Viacom donated WWRL to the United Negro College Fund, which immediately sold the station to National Black Network subsidiary Unity Broadcasting. On August 14, 1982, Unity changed WWRL's radio format to Christian. Replacing the contemporary R&B; were gospel and reggae music, plus worship services from local churches were broadcast live on evenings and weekends. By that time, increasing competition from FM stations like WBLS decreased the appeal of AM music stations, to the point that even the once-dominant WABC ended its popular music format in 1982. WWRL also broadcast rallies and meetings held by the Reverend Al Sharpton. These rallies included a controversial one on September 9, 1995, in which Sharpton claimed that Jewish building owner Fred Harari wanted to evict a record store so that a \\"white interloper\\" could \\"expand his business on 125th Street.\\" Following that comment, Harari's business, a clothing store named Freddy's Fashion Mart, was destroyed in an arson, leading to eight deaths. The New York Times later said this comment \\"was later widely blamed for fomenting racial tension.\\" The Freddy's Fashion Mart controversy was just one of several instances of anti-Semitism said to be broadcast on WWRL. Community Chorale Beginning in 1985, the station also sponsored a choir with around 70 members called the WWRL Community Chorale, which grew to nearly 100 members by 1996. The Community Chorale toured 26 cities in Germany in December 1996. Technical improvements In fall 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved WWRL's request to increase its power from 5 kW to 25 kW. Subsequently, to resolve issues of co-channel interference, WWRL bought and later shut down three nearby stations on the 1600 or 1590 frequencies: WERA 1590 in Plainfield, New Jersey, WLNG 1600 in Sag Harbor, New York, and WQQW 1590 in Waterbury, Connecticut. By this time, WWRL used the slogan \\"The Spirit of New York\\". =From R&B; oldies to urban talk (1997‚Äì2006)= WWRL logo from the urban talk format era. In April 1997, WWRL reduced gospel programming to Sundays, a move that drew criticism from former program director, the Reverend Paul Stephens. On April 16, WWRL switched to an R&B; oldies format nicknamed \\"100% Pure Soul\\" and playing music from the 1960s and 1970s, in a nod to what its vice president of programming called the station's \\"golden age.\\"R&R; 4/18/97 To distinguish itself from FM R&B; stations WBIX and WRKS, starting in the summer of 1999, WWRL devoted Saturdays to playing Caribbean music, and added R&B; from the 1950s and earlier to its playlist. Additionally, WWRL added brokered talk shows to the weekday lineup that year. In 2001, WWRL was sold to Access.1 Communications Corporation, an African-American owned and operated radio broadcasting company.fccdata.org By then, WWRL began playing more Caribbean music during the week beyond Saturdays.https://web.archive.org/web/20020608223016/http://www.wwrl1600.com/caribe.html In 2002, WWRL added a morning drive time show co-hosted by Peter Noel and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach. The station also broadcast New York Liberty basketball games.https://web.archive.org/web/20030811174749/http://www.wwrl1600.com/wnba.html By the beginning of 2003, WWRL had talk shows for most of the week, with music only broadcast on weekends, specifically Caribbean on Saturdays and gospel on Sundays. Rabbi Boteach resigned in June 2003 shortly after his co-host Noel did the same; Boteach alleged that station management changed his morning show's format from \\"harmonious to adversarial.\\" WWRL subsequently added local shows hosted by Karen Hunter, Steve Malzberg, and Armstrong Williams among others, in addition to nationally syndicated shows from Larry Elder and Alan Colmes. =Progressive talk station (2006‚Äì2014)= The final logo of the WWRL talk radio format. Variations of this logo had been used since 2006. In August 2006, WWRL became the flagship station for Air America, a politically liberal talk radio network that had previously broadcast on WLIB. Beginning on October 29, 2007, Mark Riley and New York television personality Richard Bey co-hosted the WWRL morning show. Bey resigned in March 2008. New York Daily News columnist Errol Louis became the morning host beginning in mid-July 2008. In January 2010, after Air America shut down, WWRL brought back Mark Riley as morning host and added syndicated liberal hosts such as Ed Schultz, Thom Hartmann, Stephanie Miller, Randi Rhodes, and Al Sharpton. On December 13, 2013, WWRL announced it would change format to Spanish programming and cited low advertising revenue as a reason. =Ethnic formats (2014‚Äì2020)= Following a few days of stunting, WWRL launched a regional Mexican music format and brand \\"La Invasora\\" on January 5, 2014. On February 1, 2016, WWRL changed its format to Indian and South Asian talk and music as part of the Radio Zindagi network. Ten days later, Access.1 Communications sold WWRL to NJ Broadcasting, LLC for $7 million. WWRL also added an HD Radio simulcast on WKXW-FM-HD2 for listeners in central and southern New Jersey. = Sale to iHeartMedia, BIN (2020‚Äìpresent) = On September 10, 2020, iHeartMedia announced its intent to acquire WWRL for an undisclosed amount. It will begin operating the station under a local marketing agreement on November 2 as the New York City outlet of the all-news formatted Black Information Network (BIN); BIN programming currently is available in the market via WWPR-FM's HD3 subchannel, and is expected to continue in that capacity. The flip will mark a return to the station's heritage of airing formats serving the region's African-American community.

A Democrat, Miller was the fourth Governor of Missouri before serving three terms in the United States House of Representatives. Early life John Miller was born November 25, 1781 near Martinsburg, Virginia (now West Virginia). Little is known of his youth or family history. In 1803 Miller moved to Ohio and began a career in newspapers, serving as publisher of the Western Herald. Miller would later sell his interest in the newspaper to James Wilson, grandfather of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson., Miller was also involved in early Ohio politics through his newspaper and active in the state militia. He was able to use his political influence to be appointed a brigadier general of the Ohio militia.The Messages and proclamations of the governors of the state of Missouri. Volume 1., Missouri State Historical Society, Columbia Missouri, 1922. =War of 1812= In March 1812, with the threat of war against Great Britain looming, John Miller joined the regular U.S. Army. His rank reduced to lieutenant colonel, Miller was at first assigned to the 17th Infantry Regiment. Then in July 1812 he was promoted to full colonel and transferred to command the 19th Infantry. As commander of the 19th Colonel Miller distinguished himself in one of the bigger battles on the western frontier during the war, the Siege of Fort Meigs. With the British and their Native American allies laying siege to the fort, General (and future U.S. President) William Henry Harrison ordered units from the fort to attack the British gun positions on the south bank of the Miami River. On May 13, 1813 Colonel Miller led 350 regulars and volunteers in capturing the gun battery and took 41 prisoners. However, the British and Native Americans under Captain Richard Bullock, counterattacked and, in hard fighting, drove Miller's detachment back into the fort with heavy casualties. Miller's actions did however distract the enemy long enough to let American relief forces reach the fort to reinforce the garrison James, William. A Full and Correct Account of the Military Occurrences of the Late War between Great Britain and the United States of America: Volume I. London, 1818. pp. 199‚Äì200. The rest of the war passed relatively uneventful for Miller save for a few small skirmishes with Native Americans. During the last months of the war he was in charge of the entire northern frontier.Christensen, Lawrence O. Dictionary of Missouri Biography, University of Missouri Press, Columbia, Mo., 1999. Pp. 546‚Äì547 John Miller remained in the U.S. Army after the war's end, and was assigned to Fort Bellefontaine in the Missouri Territory. In summer, 1815 he commanded the Army troops providing security for the large meeting of Native Americans and U.S. officials as they negotiated the Treaties of Portage des Sioux. Miller served another three years after the event, resigning his commission in 1818. Political career Using his political connections, John Miller was able to secure an appointment as Registrar of the Howard County Land Office in Franklin, Missouri in 1818. At the time Franklin was a booming river town and the epicenter of Missouri politics. Miller held the Registrar's position until 1825, becoming friends with a group of men who would eventually be known as the \\"Central Clique\\" and dominate Missouri Democratic politics through the 1840s. Originally a Democratic-Republican, Miller and friends became staunch Jacksonian Democrats led by Senator Thomas Hart Benton. =As governor= Missouri endured its first governmental crisis in August 1825 when Governor Frederick Bates died in office. Under the state Constitution, Lieutenant Governor, Benjamin H. Reeves would have finished out Bates' term. However, the previous month, July 1825, Reeves had resigned to take a post with the U.S. government. The governorship then fell temporarily to Senate President Pro Tempore Abraham J. Williams until a special election could be held on December 8, 1825. In that special election John Miller edged out Judge David Todd, William C. Carr, and Rufus Easton with 2,380 of the 4,933 votes cast.Historical, Pictoral, and Biographical record of Chariton County, Missouri., Pictoral and Biographical Publishing Company, Salisbury Missouri, 1896. pg. 27 Governor Miller was a strong supporter of moving the state capitol from St. Charles to Jefferson City, Missouri. He also advocated establishing a state prison in the town, to further cement its role as the permanent seat of state government. In 1826 Governor Miller was asked to draw on his previous military experience and help locate a replacement for Fort Bellefontaine. After several days of searching the banks of the Mississippi River, Miller, General Edmund P. Gaines (Commander of the Western Department of the Army), Brig. General Henry Atkinson (commanding officer of the sixth infantry regiment), and explorer William Clark selected a site near the city of \\"Vide Poche\\" or Carondelet, ten miles (16 km) south of St. Louis. At first named Cantonment Miller in honor of the Governor, the name was changed in October 1826 to Jefferson Barracks. John Miller ran for a second term as governor in 1828 and ran unopposed. He would be the only Missouri governor to serve consecutive terms until Warren E. Hearnes in the 1960s. During his second term Miller continued to espouse Jeffersonian principles of limited government. However he did urge the state general assembly to provide support for public education through use of funds generated by land sales. This would help lead to the establishment of the University of Missouri a decade later in 1839. Troubles with Native Americans marked Miller's second term in office as well. In July 1829 Chief Big Neck led a large group of Iowa Indians into their former hunting grounds in northern Missouri near present-day Kirksville. A minor clash with settlers soon occurred and fears of all-out war swept the frontier.A Book Of Adair County History, The Kirksville-Adair County Bicentennial Committee, 1976, pp. 34‚Äì38 In response Governor Miller sent 2,000 state militia and a dozen companies of U.S. Army troops to Chariton county.Ladwig, Tom, Tales of History, published in The Nevada Daily Mail, May 29, 1986 Four Missouri militia and several Native Americans were killed in a skirmish at Battle Creek in present-day Schuyler County. Chief Big Neck and many of his party were captured and put on trial in 1830, putting an end to the \\"Big Neck War\\". With the outbreak of the Blackhawk War in 1832 fears of attack once again caused Miller to call out the militia, but Missouri remained out of the limited fighting in that war. The Santa Fe Trail was proving to be lucrative, if sometimes dangerous, for Missouri merchants in the late 1820s and early 1830s as well. At Miller's urging, the General Assembly petitioned the federal government to provide U.S. Army escorts to wagon trains as protection from Native Americans and bandits. In his final term Governor Miller recommended that a state bank be established, backed by the good faith and credit of the government. This was in keeping with his belief in a hard money policy prevalent among Jacksonian Democrats and strong dislike of the Second Bank of the United States. Governor Miller proved to be an adept and frugal manager of the people's money. By the time he left office in 1832 the state's debt had been reduced to just $37,000. =In Congress= After his second term expired in November 1832 John Miller returned to Howard County, where he had a substantial home and several business interests. He also kept his hand in politics by writing‚Äîand sometimes \\"ghost writing\\" for others‚Äînewspaper editorials on issues facing the state and nation. In 1836 he was elected to the first of three consecutive terms in the United States House of Representatives. Miller seldom, if ever, \\"made waves\\" in his six years in Congress, preferring to be a good \\"party man\\" and supporting the Democratic policies. As far as known he never proposed new or special legislation. Dismayed by the increasing acrimony in national politics brought on by sectional hostilities, Miller chose not to seek a fourth congressional term in 1842. A lifelong bachelor and having no children of his own, Congressman Miller retired to the home of his nephew in Florissant, Missouri. He died there on March 18, 1846 at age 64. First placed in the private vault of wealthy friend John O'Fallon on the O'Fallon estate, Miller was later reinterred at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. He is the namesake of Miller County, Missouri.

It was named after a transport driver named Johnny Coleman who, during a sand storm, abandoned his ox wagon on a small incline opposite the settlement. Once a small but very rich mining village, it is now a tourist destination run by the joint firm Namibia-De Beers. History =Foundation and peak= In 1908, the worker Zacharias Lewala found a diamond while working in this area and showed it to his supervisor, the German railway inspector August Stauch. Realizing the area was rich in diamonds, German miners began settlement, and soon after the German Empire declared a large area as a \\"Sperrgebiet\\", starting to exploit the diamond field. Driven by the enormous wealth of the first diamond miners, the residents built the village in the architectural style of a German town, with amenities and institutions including a hospital, ballroom, power station, school, skittle-alley, theatre and sport-hall, casino, ice factory and the first x-ray-station in the southern hemisphere, as well as the first tram in Africa. It had a railway link to L√ºderitz. =Decline= The town started to decline during World War II when the diamond-field slowly started to deplete. By the early '50s, the area was in a severe decline. Hastening the town‚Äôs demise decades earlier was the discovery in 1928 of the richest diamond-bearing deposits ever known, on the beach terraces 270 km south of Kolmanskop, near the Orange River. Many of the town‚Äôs inhabitants joined the rush to the south, leaving their homes and possessions behind. The new diamond find merely required scouting the beaches as opposed to more difficult mining. The town was ultimately abandoned in 1956. The geological forces of the desert mean that tourists now walk through houses knee-deep in sand. Kolmanskop is popular with photographers for its settings of the desert sands' reclaiming this once-thriving town, and the arid climate preserving the traditional Edwardian architecture in the area. Due to its location within the restricted area (Sperrgebiet) of the Namib desert, tourists need a permit to enter the town. In popular culture *Kolmanskop was used as the location for the South African TV series The Mantis Project (1985).

It commemorates the fall of Barcelona during the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714 and the subsequent loss of Catalan institutions and laws.When the Treaty of Utrecht was signed between April and July, the Principality of Catalonia remained (alongside Majorca) the only realm of which still fought for the cause of Charles III. By 9 July, the General Estates of Catalonia decided to continue the war in order to defend the Catalan constitutions History The Army of Catalonia that initially fought in support of the Habsburg dynasty's claim to the Spanish throne were finally defeated at the Siege of Barcelona by the army of the Bourbon king Philip V of Spain on 11 September 1714 after 14 months of siege. That meant the loss of the Catalan constitutions and the institutional system of the Principality of Catalonia under the aegis of the Nueva Planta decrees, and the establishment of absolutism.Mercader, J. Felip V i Catalunya. (Barcelona, 1968) The holiday was first celebrated on 11 September 1886. In 1888, coinciding with the inauguration of the Barcelona Universal Exposition, a statue in honor of Rafael Casanova was set up, which would become the point of reference of the events of the Diada. The celebration gained popularity over the following years; the Diada of 1923 was a great mass event, with more than a thousand floral offerings, acts throughout Catalonia and a certain institutional participation. But the demonstrations caused 17 wounded, five policemen and 12 protesters, and several arrests. The dictatorship of Primo de Rivera banned the celebration. During the Second Spanish Republic (1931‚Äì1939), the Generalitat de Catalunya (the autonomous government of Catalonia) institutionalized the celebration.La conmemoraci√≥ durant la Segona Rep√∫blica i la Guerra Civil. arxiuhistoric.bcn.cat It was suppressed by Francoist Spain in 1939, and relegated to the family and private sphere, but continued to be celebrated clandestinely. The monument of Rafael Casanova was removed. Since 1940 the National Front of Catalonia took advantage of the day to carry out some propaganda actions: distribution of anti-fascist leaflets, clandestine hanging of senyeres, etc. It was celebrated publicly for the first time again on 11 September 1976, followed by a huge demonstration demanding Catalan autonomy in Barcelona the next year, on 11 September 1977, in which the Casanova's statue was repositioned in its place, and the celebration was reinstated officially in 1980 by the Generalitat de Catalunya, upon its restoration after the Francoist State, becoming the first law approved by the restored Parliament of Catalonia.\\"Onze de Setembre\\" , in: Gran Enciclop√®dia Catalana (online) Celebrations Nationalist organizations, political parties and institutions traditionally lay floral offerings at monuments of those who led the defence of the city such as Rafael Casanova and General Moragues, marking their stand against the king Philip V of Spain. Typically, Catalan nationalists organize demonstrations and meet at the Fossar de les Moreres in Barcelona, where they pay homage to the defenders of city who died during the siege and were buried there. Throughout the day, there are patriotic demonstrations and cultural events in many Catalan villages and many citizens wave senyeres and estelades. The event has become more explicitly political and particularly focused on independence rallies in the 2010s.

Vitellozzo Vitelli (c. 1458December 31, 1502) was an Italian condottiero. He was lord of Montone, Citt√† di Castello, Monterchi and Anghiari. Biography Together with his father, Niccol√≤, tyrant of Citt√† di Castello, and his brothers, who were all soldiers of fortune, he instituted a new type of infantry armed with sword and pike to resist the German men-at-arms, and also a corps of mounted infantry armed with arquebuses. Vitellozzo took service with Florence against Pisa, and later with the French in Apulia in 1496 and with the Orsini faction against Pope Alexander VI. In 1500 Vitellozzo and the Orsini made peace with the pope, and the latter's son Cesare Borgia, being determined to crush the petty tyrants of Romagna and consolidate papal power in that province, took the condottieri into his service. Vitellozzo distinguished himself in many engagements, but in 1501 he advanced against Florence, moved as much by a desire to avenge his brother Paolo, who while in the service of the Republic, had been suspected of treachery and put to death (1499), as by Cesare's orders. While Borgia was actually negotiating with the republic, Vitelli seized Arezzo. He was forced by Borgia and the French to give up the city, to his chagrin, and he began from that moment to nurture hostile feelings towards his master and to aspire to independent rule. Vitellozzo Vitelli wanted revenge for his brother's death. Seizing Arezzo forced scare upon the Florentines and almost forced Cesare to attack Florence, but this action was in conflict with the wishes of Louis d'Orleans, king of France. He took part with the Orsini, Oliverotto da Fermo and other captains in the conspiracy of La Magione against the Borgia, but mutual distrust and the incapacity of the leaders before Cesare's energy and the promise of French help, brought the plot to naught, and Vitelli and other condottieri, hoping to ingratiate themselves with Cesare once more, seized Senigallia in his name. There they were tricked by him and captured while their troops were out of reach. Vitelli and Oliverotto were strangled that same night on December 31, 1502. This incident may have alienated Leonardo da Vinci from Borgia (whose service the artist was in), as he was Vitelli's friend.

Fileteado () is a type of artistic drawing and lettering, with stylised lines and flowered, climbing plants, typically used in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is used to adorn all kinds of beloved objects: signs, taxis, lorries and even the old colectivos, Buenos Aires's buses. Filetes (the lines in fileteado style) are usually full of colored ornaments and symmetries completed with poetic phrases, sayings and aphorisms, both humorous or roguish, emotional or philosophical. They have been part of the culture of the Porte√±os (inhabitants of Buenos Aires) since the beginnings of the 20th century. The filetes were born as simple ornaments, becoming an emblematic form of art for the city. Many of its initiators were European immigrants, who brought from Europe some elements of what later fileteado, which became the distinct Argentinian art form known today when mixed with local traditional art styles. Fileteado was recognized as a unique art after 1970, when it was exhibited for the first time.  History  Fileteado began in the gray carts pulled by horses, that transported fruits, milk, groceries and bread at the end of the 19th century. The painter who decorated the carts was called Fileteador, because he performed the job with long-threaded paintbrushes also called \\"Brushes for making filetes\\". This is a word derived from Latin \\"Filum\\" which means \\"Thread\\", referring to the art in a fine line that serves as ornament. Since it was something that was executed after a cart was done, but before the payment was received, it was a task that had to be performed quickly. At that time, many specialist painters flourished such as Ernesto Magiori and Pepe Aguado or artists such as Miguel Venturo, son of Salvador Venturo. This last one had been a captain of the Merchant Navy of Italy who established in Buenos Aires, where he dedicated to Fileteado, incorporating a lot of motifs from his home country. Miguel studied painting and enhanced his father's technique, being considered by many the painter who shaped the Filete. The introduction of birds, flowers, diamonds and dragons in the motifs is attributed to him, as well as the design of letters in the doors of trucks. Since there was a tax imposed on very big letters, Miguel made smaller ones but surrounded by very colorful and complex designs to draw attention, design that stood for a long time.  Main formal features  In the book Filete porte√±o, by Alfredo Genovese, the anthropologist Norberto Cirio describes the main formal features from fileteado as: #A high degree of stylization #The preponderance of lively colours #The use of shading and highlighting to create the illusion of depth #The preferred use of a Gothic font style or highly detailed letters #The almost obsessive recurrence of symmetry #The framing of each composition when it is finished #The efficient use of available space #The symbolic conceptualization of many of the images represented (the horseshoe as a symbol of good luck, the dragon as a symbol of strength).

Alzeco should not be confused with the Pannonian Bulgar leader Alciocus who joined the Wends before Alzeco was born. 3 shows the Altsikurs of Alzeco moving along Italy. 4 shows the earlier Pannonian Bulgars of Alciocus. After the collapse of Old Great Bulgaria, some of the Bulgars, led by Alzeco, thought to be a son of Khan Kubrat, settled in the lands of the Longobard Kingdom. Paul the Deacon places a settlement in his history of the migration of the Bulgars in the area of the Duchy of Benevento. Under the leadership of Alzeco, the Bulgars (called \\"Vulgars\\" by Paul) came to Italy in Benevento, where they settled in the Molise region.Dillon, John B. \\"Bulgars\\". Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia, ed. Christopher Kleinhenz. London: Routledge, 2004. Alciocus The earlier Khagan called Alciocus who was the leader of Bulgar hordes of the Avar Khanganate, is also known. The main source for these events is the medieval chronicle of Fredegar. In 631 Samo led a rebellion against the Pannonian Avars. Alciocus fled with 9,000 Bulgars to Bavaria where he asked the Frankish king Dagobert II for a piece of land to settle in. The king at first allowed them some land, but one night he ordered his army to slaughter the Bulgars. Only 700 out of 9,000 survived the slaughter and fled for protection to Walluc king of the Wends. Istvan Zimonyi, Muslim Sources on the Magyars in the Second Half of the 9th Century: The Magyar Chapter of the JayhƒÅnƒ´ Tradition, BRILL, 2015, p. 249., After the departure of Alciocus, Kubrat established peace between the Avars and Byzantium in 632. Alzeco Although only three of Kubrat's sons are mentioned by name it has been suggested that Kubrat gave the name Alzeco to one of his other two sons. After Kubrat's death over 40 years later, his empire was divided by his five sons in the 670s. Alzeco gained permission from the King of the Lombards, Grimoald, to settle in the area of Ravenna. Eventually they were sent south into the Duchy of Benevento, where Alzeco was granted the rule of their settlements with the Longobard (Italian) title of gastald.The History of the Papal States: From Their Origin to the Present Day, Volume 2 Page 156 By John Miley =Italian Archaeology= Human graves of a steppe-nomadic character as well as horse burials datable to the second half of the eighth century attest to the presence of Pannonian peoples in the Molise and Campania. Tombe con cavallo a Vicenne, MontidelMatese.it, March 9, 2007 In the lifetime of Paul the Deacon, he recorded that the descendants of these \\"Vulgars\\" still spoke their original language, as well as Latin. Alzeco as Alciocus Researchers have, in the past, claimed one identification of both historical figures.Daniel Ziemann, Vom Wandervolk zur Grossmacht: die Entstehung Bulgariens im fr√ºhen Mittelalter (7.-9. Jahrhundert), B√∂hlau Verlag K√∂ln Weimar, 2007, , p. 133. They have suggested that Alzeco might be identified with the Bulgar leader Alciocus of the Fredegar chronicle. This notion, however, must surmount a significant chronological contradiction, and it is possible that this was a title rather than a personal name.Istvan Zimonyi, Muslim Sources on the Magyars in the Second Half of the 9th Century: The Magyar Chapter of the JayhƒÅnƒ´ Tradition, East Central and Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 450-1450, BRILL, 2015, p. 257., The Cambridge Medieval History Series volumes 1-5, Plantagenet Publishing. Panos Sophoulis, Byzantium and Bulgaria, 775-831, Volume 16 of East Central and Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 450-1450, BRILL, 2011, p. 108. In any case, it seems more likely that the \\"vulgares\\" that settled in the Molise are more likely to refer to the men of Alciocus, as most of the tombs excavated at Campochiaro can be dated around the middle of the VII century, with some being certainly earlier or later. This would indicate a settlement in the area some time before the reign of Romuald as Duke in Benevento and Grimoald as king in Pavia. Furthermore, this is supported by the fact that the Longobards had no control of the Ravennate lands until the second half of the VIII century, meaning that Grimoald would have been unable to settle them in this area without Byzantine approval, which would be strange as Costans II was in the midst of a disastrous Italian campaign against the Southern Longobards. It is very probable that Paul the Deacon confused the settlement of Alzeco/Alciocus in the Molise after his flight from Dagobert I with another event about 50 years later, specifically the settlement of one of Kubrat's/Kurt's unnamed sons around Ravenna, most likely as a form of protection against the Longobards for the nominally Byzantine Exarchate. The name of the leader of this group is completely unknown, although the settlement may have been known thanks to Byzantine records in the Exarchate. Gli √Ävari.

Vincent Baker. \\"How special interest can you get?\\" indie-rpgs.com, 2003-07-31. \\"My design goals are: it's interesting to Mormons, it's relevant to Mormons, and it treats the concerns of Mormonism with subtlety and respect.\\" It was written by D. Vincent Baker and published by Lumpley Games. In the 2004 Indie RPG Awards, Dogs in the Vineyard was awarded Indie RPG of the Year and Most Innovative Game. In 2005 it was nominated for a Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming. It generally encourages narrativist play.  Setting  The game is set in \\"a West that never quite was\\"‚Äîloosely based on the Mormon State of Deseret in pre-statehood Utah. Players are \\"God's Watchdogs\\" (\\"Dogs\\"), who travel from town to town delivering mail, helping out the community and enforcing the judgments of the True Faith of the King of Life. This may involve anything from delivering new interpretations to the town's Steward to executing heretics. Dogs have absolute authority within the Faith, but not within the laws of the Territorial Authority, and so their actions can lead to conflict with the government in the East.  System  The game features a form of conflict resolution, where die rolls are used in poker-style bids. Characters' statistics and traits are represented by dice pools. At the start of a conflict, the Gamemaster and other players decide what is at stake, determine which pools are applicable, and those are rolled at that point. The character with the initiative puts forward a \\"raise\\" of two dice, while narrating a portion of the conflict which is beneficial to their character's position in the conflict. The opponent must respond by putting forward one or more dice whose total exceeds the total of the dice which were used to raise, or \\"give\\"‚Äîi.e. lose the conflict. If three or more dice are needed, the opponent suffers \\"fallout\\"‚Äîa negative outcome to be determined at the end of the conflict. If only one die is needed by the opponent, the attack has been \\"turned against the attacker\\" and the die can be reused to raise in the next round. The opponent now begins a round by putting forward two dice which the first character must match, and so on until one player or the other gives. Players may bring in new dice by \\"escalating\\" the conflict, from non-physical (discussion) to physical (running away) to brawling and then to gunfighting. If the conflict didn't start with non-physical, players may de-escalate from gunfighting to discussion, though it occurs only rarely. The GM's set of rules in conflict is very simple: \\"Say yes, or roll dice.\\" During the \\"Town Creation\\" segment, the moral landscape of the town is laid out in the form of characters, their desires, and what they've done to each other which allows players to engage in the town without making wins or losses the only object of play. Reception Shannon Appelcline comments on this game: \\"A story of God's Watchdogs, trying to preserve the faithful on the hostile frontier of the 19th century. This was one of the first indies to be notably successful, both financially and sociologically. It introduced the idea of 'say yes or roll', where GMs either went along with player suggestions, or gave them opportunity to occur through a die roll.

On October 8, 1808, the privilege of using the name Empecinado was granted to Juan Mart√≠n D√≠ez, not only for himself, but also all his descendants. His nickname has given the Spanish language the verb empecinarse, meaning to persist or insist on achieving one's goals. Early life D√≠ez was born in Castrillo de Duero (Valladolid, Spain) on September 5, 1775. He was a farmer and his house still exists in its original location. Those from Castrillo are often termed \\"empecinados\\", a term which arises from several nearby streams filled with black mud (pecina)pez in Diccionario cr√≠tico etimol√≥gico de la lengua castellana vol.III, pag.762 (50), Joan Corominas, Francke Verlag - Bern, 1954. from stagnant, decomposing waters. It is believed that the local appellation was then applied to D√≠ez, just like other guerrilleros were nicknamed after their trade. D√≠ez had military ambitions throughout his childhood. At 18, he participated in the Rosell√≥n campaign of the War of the Pyrenees (1793-1795). The following two years were pivotal in his training in the art of war and began his hostile attitude towards the French. In 1796, D√≠ez married in Fuentec√©n, Burgos, and D√≠ez settled in that town with his new bride. He farmed there until the occupation of Spain by Napoleon's army in 1808, whereupon he pledged to fight against the invaders. It is said that his decision to fight was spurred on when a woman in his town was raped by a French soldier; D√≠ez afterwards killed the offender. After the invasion, D√≠ez organized a party of warriors composed of his friends and even members of his own family. At first, the conflict centered around the route between Madrid and Burgos. Later, he fought alongside the Spanish Army at the Cabez√≥n de Pisuerga bridge in Valladolid and in Medina de Rioseco, Valladolid. The Spanish Army was routed in both of these battles. Military successes Bronze bust of Juan Mart√≠n D√≠ez in Alcal√° de Henares. The Army's failures caused D√≠ez to believe that he would have better results with a system of guerrilla warfare. Thus started his wartime success, in such places as Aranda de Duero, Sep√∫lveda, Pedraza, and throughout the Duero river basin. In 1809 D√≠ez was promoted to the rank of cavalry captain. During the spring of the same year, his field of action extended along the mountains in Gredos, √Åvila, and Salamanca, and also in the provinces of Cuenca and Guadalajara. The principal function of the guerrilla bands was to disrupt the supply and communication lines of the French army by intercepting the enemy's messages and by seizing convoys of supplies, money, and armaments. The damage to Napoleon's army was considerable, to such an extent that Joseph L√©opold Sigisbert Hugo, a French general, was given the duty to \\"pursue exclusively\\" D√≠ez and his guerrillas. Hugo, after trying unsuccessfully to capture D√≠ez, opted instead to arrest D√≠ez's mother and other members of his family. D√≠ez, not to be cowed, had 100 French prisoners of war executed as retribution. His mother and family thereupon were released. In 1810, D√≠ez was forced to take refuge in the castle of the Salamancan city of Ciudad Rodrigo, which the French army besieged. In 1811, he was placed in command of a hussar regiment from Guadalajara, bringing his total force to some 6000 men. On May 22, 1813, D√≠ez assisted in the defense of Alcal√° de Henares (Madrid), and on the Zulema bridge over the Henares river he and his army defeated a French force twice their size. Later, Fernando VII would approve the construction of a commemorative pyramid in Alcal√° in honor of the victory, only to order its destruction in 1823, deriding it as a symbol of a \\"liberal\\". The people of Alcal√°, however, raised another monument to the Empecinado in 1879; this monument survives to this day. Liberal revolution and decline Memorial to Juan Mart√≠n D√≠ez in Burgos. When King Fernando VII returned to Spain and restored absolutism, he took measures against those he considered \\"liberal enemies\\", among them D√≠ez, who was exiled to Valladolid. In 1820, the revolution of Rafael de Riego commenced, and D√≠ez took up arms - but this time against Fernando VII's royal troops. During the following years, in the trienio liberal (Spanish: three-year period of liberal rule), he was named military governor of Zamora and occasionally Capit√°n General (General Captain). In 1823, during the Absolutist Reaction, a French Army (the so- called Hundred Thousand Sons of St. Louis) invaded Spain to restore absolutism, the liberal regime fell, and D√≠ez fled to Portugal. From there, he asked permission to return without danger of detainment, a request which was granted. But upon his return, he was arrested near Olmillos de Pe√±afiel and moved to Nava de Roa (Burgos) where he was turned over to the mayor, Gregorio Gonz√°lez. He was there imprisoned and displayed in an iron-bar cage. Leopoldo O'Donnell, a liberal military leader, learned of D√≠ez's situation and attempted to have D√≠ez's case heard in a tribunal. The magistrate in Roa de Duero, however, had already ordered D√≠ez's execution, which was carried out on August 20, 1825, in the central plaza of the village. D√≠ez died, hanged in lieu of being shot. It is said that in an outburst of desperation and strength, D√≠ez managed to take the sword from the official that accompanied him to the gallows.

It is the largest living museum in New England, covering more than 200 acres (80 hectares). The Village includes 59 antique buildings, three water-powered mills, and a working farm. The museum is popular among tourists and for educational field trips. Costumed interpreters speaking in modern English help visitors understand 19th-century life.  History  Prior to European colonization, the Nipmuck people inhabited the Quinebaug River. In the early 19th century, the land on which Old Sturbridge Village now stands was a farm owned by David Wight which included a sawmill, a gristmill, and a millpond. The millpond was dug in 1795 and still powers the mills today. In 1795, Wight's son went to Boston to conduct some business on behalf of his father. While in Boston, he bought tickets to the Harvard Lottery which was a fund-raising technique for Harvard College. He won $5,000 (equivalent to $ in today's dollars). He gave his father money to pay off the mortgage on his farm and logged the timber of the cedar swamp which today is the millpond. After the logging was complete, they dug the pond with a team of oxen and a scoop. This entire process took two and a half years. George Washington Wells started a small spectacle shop in Southbridge, Massachusetts in the 1840s which became the American Optical Company. His sons Channing, Albert (called \\"AB\\"), and Cheney followed him into the business, which continued to expand. In 1926, AB began to shop for antiques, and this influenced Cheney to collect early American timepieces and Channing to collect fine furniture. By the early 1930s, AB had more than 45 rooms full of antiques in his Southbridge home. The Wells family and others formed the Wells Historical Museum in 1935, gave it title to the various collections, and charged it with the care and exhibition of the artifacts. In July 1936, the Museum's trustees met to determine how the collections would best be presented to the public. AB wanted to create a small cluster of buildings in a horseshoe around a common, but his son George B proposed creating a live village with operating shops and a source of water power. Within a week of the meeting, the Museum purchased David Wight's farm and soon after hired Malcolm Watkins as the first curator of the museum, which they called Quinnebaug Village in honor of the river. Architect Arthur Shurcliff was called in to help lay out a suitable country landscape. By 1941, the Fitch House, the Miner Grant Store, and the Richardson House (now the Parsonage) were on the common and the Gristmill was in operation. After a pause for World War II, George B.'s wife Ruth became acting director of the Village. They changed its name to Old Sturbridge Village and opened it on June 8, 1946. Attendance climbed, mostly through word of mouth. In a 1950 article in The Saturday Evening Post, the village was featured as \\"The Town That Wants to be Out of Date\\". By 1955, it acquired the Meetinghouse from the Fiskdale neighborhood of Sturbridge, the Salem Towne House from Charlton, Massachusetts, the Fenno House, the Friends Meetinghouse, the Pliny Freeman House, the Printing Office, and the District School. On August 18, 1955, gale- force winds and a torrential downpour from Hurricane Diane created flood waters that broke dams in surrounding towns and flooded the Village, stranding 15 staff members. The Freeman Farmhouse was flooded and the Covered Bridge was swept off its foundation. Helicopters kept staff members supplied for three days until the waters receded. The damage was estimated to be $250,000 in 1955 dollars, but Village employees managed to re-open the Village in just nine days. Structures and exhibits Old Sturbridge Village has more than 40 structures, including restored buildings purchased and relocated from around New England, as well as some authentic reconstructions, and the entire village is divided into three main sections.

He was also a Texas Ranger, a Confederate colonel, doctor, lawyer, and a journalist and newspaper owner. Ford commanded men during the Antelope Hills Expedition and he later commanded the Confederate forces in what was arguably the last engagement of the American Civil War, the Battle of Palmito Ranch on May 12‚Äì13, 1865. It was a Confederate victory, but as it occurred more than a month after Robert E. Lee's surrender it had no effect on the outcome of the war. Early life Ford was born in Greenville District, South Carolina, but grew up in Lincoln County, Tennessee. His parents were William and Harriet Ford. When he was 16 he moved to Shelbyville, Tennessee, to study medicine. There he met his future wife, Mary Davis. However, the marriage ended in divorce and Ford decided to move to Texas, then fighting for its independence from Mexico. Texas Ford arrived in Texas in June 1836, too late to participate in the Texas Revolution. He served in the Texas army until 1838. He opened a medical practice in the east Texas town of San Augustine, where he practiced for eight years.Ford, J.S., 1963, Rip Ford's Texas. Austin: University of Texas Press, He also studied law and passed the bar exam before winning election to the Texas legislature in 1844, advocating annexation by the United States. The following year he moved to Austin, where he purchased the Texas National Register, renaming it the Texas Democrat. When the Mexican War began, Ford enlisted in John Coffee Hays' regiment of Texas Mounted Rifles. However, he was promptly appointed a lieutenant and would serve as both adjutant and medical officer. He saw active duty with his regiment in Mexico, commanding a scout company part of the time. He received the nickname 'Rip' for his peculiarity of including the words \\"Rest in Peace\\" after each and every name when composing his company's casualty lists. In 1849, with Robert Neighbors, Ford explored the country between San Antonio and El Paso and published a report and map of the route, which became known as the Ford and Neighbors Trail. Later the same year he was made captain in the Texas Rangers and was stationed between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande, where he had numerous fights with the Indians during 1850 and 1851. In 1850 he captured the War Chief, Carne Muerto, a son of Santa Anna. After his Ranger unit was disbanded, Ford participated in Jose Maria Jesus Carbajal's Merchant's War (1851-1852) as a Colonel. In 1852 he was elected to the Texas Senate, bought the Southwestern American, and established the State Times in 1853, which he sold in 1857. Early in 1858, he accepted a commission as Senior Captain in the state troops and defeated hostile Native Americans in the Battle of Little Robe Creek on the Canadian River. Late in 1859, he was sent to the Rio Grande by Governor Runnel at the head of fifty-three State troops (Texas Rangers), where he joined operations with Captain George Stoneman of the 2nd Cavalry and Captain Tobin's Texas Rangers against Juan Cortina in the Battle of Rio Grande City. American Civil War In 1861, Ford served as a member of the Secession Convention, and initiated a trade agreement between Mexico and the Confederacy. As a Colonel in the Confederacy, he had command of the Rio Grande Military District. In early April 1861, he commanded troops who defended Zapata County from invaders from Mexico who did not want Texas in the Confederacy in the Second Cortina War. They had entered Zapata County from Mexico and hanged the county judge. Several of the invaders were killed, marking the first deaths in defense of the Confederacy, about two weeks before the bloodless Battle of Fort Sumter.Rip Ford's Texas Memoirs, Briscoe library Between 1862 and 1865 he ran the Bureau of Conscription of the State, and at various times he was engaged in border operations protecting Confederate- Mexican trade. After raising 1300 troops, \\"The Cavalry of the West\\", Col. Ford recaptured Fort Brown on 30 July 1864. His forces defended a Federal attack a few miles above Palmito Ranch on 9 September 1864, forcing them to retreat back to Brazos Island on 12 Sept. 1864. In May 1865, he led Confederate forces in the Battle of Palmito Ranch, by some criteria the last battle of the American Civil War. \\"Some of the Sixty-Second Colored Regiment were also taken. They had been led to believe that if captured they would either be shot or returned to slavery. They were agreeably surprised when they were paroled and permitted to depart with the white prisoners. Several of the prisoners were from Austin and vicinity. They were assured they would be treated as prisoners of war.

It is the capital of J√µgeva County. It is the birthplace of Estonian poet Betti Alver and musician and composer Alo Mattiisen.  History  J√µgeva was first mentioned in 1599 as Jagiwa manor, being established only recently on the lands of the same named village by the orders of the Polish king. During the Polish reign in Estonia (1582‚Äì1622) it was part of Laiuse starostwo, which became Laiuse fief during Swedish rule (1622‚Äì1721). In 1756, J√µgeva manor became the property of Gotthard Johann von Manteuffel (1690‚Äì1763) and remained in the family of von Manteuffel until 1919 when it was nationalized by the government. In 1876, a railway station, named Laisholm after the manor, was established near the village of J√µgeva. The owner of J√µgeva manor, Ernst Gotthard von Manteuffel (1844‚Äì1922), started renting out land around the railway station in 1903. After that, the village grew quickly. On October 13, 1919, J√µgeva became a borough and on May 1, 1938 a town. During the Second World War nearly 60% of the town was destroyed. During the Soviet occupation of Estonia J√µgeva became an important administrative center with several big industries. Many new administrative, commercial and residential buildings were erected at that time. Location J√µgeva is situated on the right shore of Pedja River which flows through the city from north to south. Parallel with the river is the Tallinn‚ÄìTartu railway line.

It proved unreliable and ineffective in operation, prompting the withdrawal of the system during 1941. Continued development of the basic concept led to the UP-2 and UP-3, which had smaller diameters of or (respectively) but longer in length. The latter was used as the basis of the Z Batteries, and later developed in air-to-ground form as the RP-3, most famously used on the Hawker Typhoon.  Operation  The name \\"unrotated projectile\\" was a cover name to disguise the use of a rocket system, and comes from the fact that the projectile was not spin-stabilized. The weapon had 20 smoothbore tubes and fired ten at a time. A small cordite charge was used to ignite a rocket motor which propelled the fin-stabilized rocket out of the tube to a distance of about , where it exploded and released an mine attached to three parachutes by of wire. The idea was that an aeroplane hitting the wire would draw the mine towards itself, where it would detonate.  Development  The UP was developed by Sir Alwyn Crow, who was the director of the Projectile Development Establishment at Fort Halstead. In November 1939, Winston Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty asked Crow to produce urgently a means of laying an aerial minefield and to consider other methods of protecting ships against aircraft. It is likely that Churchill was influenced in his request by his friend and advisor, Frederick Lindemann, who had previously advocated a scheme for \\"dropping bombs hanging by wires in the path of attacking aircraft\\".Furneaux-Smith, 1961, p210. A high-altitude barrage was developed: an aerial minefield up to , the fast aerial mine up to , the PE fuse up to and the UP up to . The 7-inch UP was developed simultaneously with the 2-inch and 3-inch UP systems, the latter being successfully deployed in the anti-aircraft Z Batteries which were operated by the Home Guard and was the basis of the RP-3 air-to-surface rocket and the Mattress surface-to- surface multiple rocket launcher.Furneaux-Smith, 1961, p234.  Effectiveness  The weapon was not very effective as it was slow to load and aircraft could avoid the wires. It was replaced later in the war by the 2-pounder or Bofors 40 mm gun. A demonstration of the weapon for Churchill on Admiral Jack Tovey's flagship at Scapa Flow dramatically exposed a flaw in the concept. Practice bombs were fired, and when there was an unexpected change of wind, they drifted back onto the ship and some became entangled in the rigging and superstructure. The dummy rounds caused little or no damage, but Tovey was amused at the embarrassment thus caused to the weapon's advocates, Lindemann and Churchill. The UP ammunition aboard was seen to be on fire just before she exploded and sank in May 1941. The report of the Admiralty Board of Enquiry into the sinking of Hood in September 1941 concluded \\"That the fire that was seen on Hood's boat deck, and in which UP and/or 4-inch ammunition was certainly involved, was not the cause of her loss\\", but it noted that \\"Action has (already) been taken to land UP mountings and ammunition\\" in the rest of the fleet.ADM 116/4351: Report on the Loss of H.M.S.

He was victorious at least once at the City Dionysia, first probably in the mid-440s (IG II2 2325. 56; the fourth entry after Teleclides and three poets whose names have been lost, and just before Hermippus), and twice at the Lenaia, first probably in the mid- to late 430s (IG II2 2325. 122; just after Cratinus and just before Hermippus). He was especially famous for his inventive imagination, and the elegance and purity of his diction are attested by the epithet ·ºàœÑœÑŒπŒ∫œéœÑŒ±œÑŒøœÇ (most Attic) applied to him by Athenaeus and the sophist Phrynichus. He was the inventor of a new meter, called after him, the Pherecratean, which frequently occurs in the choruses of Greek tragedies and in Horace. According to an anonymous essay on tragedy, Pherecrates wrote 18 plays, suggesting that one or more of the 19 surviving titles must be eliminated somehow (i.e. by assigning the play to another author who wrote a comedy by the same name, and assuming an ancient scholarly error, or by identifying e.g. The Human Heracles and The Fake Heracles as a single play with multiple titles). Surviving Titles and Fragments 288 fragments (including six dubia) of his comedies survive, along with the following 19 titles: *Agathoi (\\"Good Men\\") *Agrioi (\\"Wild Men,\\" or \\"Savages\\") *Anthropherakles (\\"The Human Heracles\\"; possibly the same play as Pseuderakles) *Automoloi (\\"Deserters\\") *Graes (\\"Old Women,\\" or \\"Hags\\") *Doulodidaskalos (\\"The Slave Teacher\\") *Epilesmon (\\"The Forgetful Man\\") or Thalatta (\\"The Sea\\") *Ipnos (\\"The Kitchen\\") or Pannychis (The All- Night Festival\\") *Korianno (\\"Corianno\\") *Krapataloi (\\"Good-For-Nothings\\") *Leroi (\\"Jewelry\\") *Metalles (\\"Miners\\") *Metoikoi (\\"Resident Aliens\\") *Myrmekanthropoi (\\"Ant-Men\\") *Persai (\\"Persians\\") *Petale (\\"Petale\\") *Tyrannis (\\"Tyranny\\") *Cheiron (\\"Chiron\\") *Pseuderakles (\\"The Fake Heracles\\"; possibly the same play as Anthropherakles) The standard edition of the fragments and testimonia is in Rudolf Kassel and Colin Fran√ßois Lloyd Austin's Poetae Comici Graeci Vol. VII. The eight-volume Poetae Comici Graeci produced from 1983 to 2001 replaces the outdated collections Fragmenta Comicorum Graecorum by August Meineke (1839-1857), Comicorum Atticorum Fragmenta by Theodor Kock (1880-1888) and Comicorum Graecorum Fragmenta by Georg Kaibel (1899).

He represented Missouri in the US House of Representatives. Early life Jameson was born in Mount Sterling, Kentucky in Montgomery County, Kentucky on March 6, 1802. His great uncle was Col. John Jameson and he was a second cousin (twice removed) to George Washington.E. O. Jameson, The Jameson's of America, 1647-1900, Rumford Press, Boston, 1901, pp. 136-137 He attended the common schools, moved to Callaway County, Missouri in 1825, studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1826 and commenced practice in Fulton, Missouri. Career He served as a captain in the militia during the Black Hawk War between April and August 1832. He held several local offices including member of the Missouri House of Representatives from 1830 to 1836 and the Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives from 1834 to 1836.

Later life John Jameson, an engraving by Francis Croll, courtesy of the National Galleries of Scotland In 1855, as a lawyer, Jameson led the defense of a slave named Celia in what became an influential trial of a slave. He based his unsuccessful \\"defense on the premise that under Missouri law Celia possessed the same right to use deadly force to defend her honor as did white women.\\" In his later years, Jameson was a farmer and was ordained as a minister in the Christian Church. Personal life Jameson was married to Susan A. Harris (1814‚Äì1890), a daughter of Tyre Harris and Sarah (n√©e Garland) Harris.

The Egyptian historian Manetho named him \\"Mieb√Æd√≥s\\" and credited him with a reign of 26 years,William Gillian Waddell: Manetho (The Loeb Classical Library, Volume 350). Harvard University Press, Cambridge (Mass.) 2004 (Reprint), , page 33‚Äì37. whilst the Royal Canon of Turin credited him with an implausible reign of 74 years.Alan H. Gardiner: The Royal Canon of Turin. Griffith Institute of Oxford, Oxford (UK) 1997, ; page 15 & Table I. Egyptologists and historians now consider both records to be exaggerations and generally credit Adjib with a reign of 8‚Äì10 years.Wolfgang Helck: Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit. (√Ñgyptologische Abhandlungen, Volume 45), Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1987, , page 124, 160 - 162 & 212 - 214. Name sources Cartouche name Merbiape from the Abydos King List Adjib is well attested in archaeological records. His name appears in inscriptions on vessels made of schist, alabaster, breccia and marble. His name is also preserved on ivory tags and earthen jar seals. Objects bearing Adjib's name and titles come from Abydos and Sakkara.Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. Routledge, London 1999, , page 78, 79 & 275. Identity Adjib's family has only partially been investigated. His parents are unknown, but it is thought that his predecessor, king Den, may have been his father. Adjib was possibly married to a woman named Betrest. On the Palermo Stone she is described as the mother of Adjib's successor, king Semerkhet. Definite evidence for that view has not yet been found. It would be expected that Adjib had sons and daughters, but their names have not been preserved in the historical record. A candidate for being a possible member of his family line is Semerkhet.Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards: Early History of the Middle East (The Cambridge Ancient History; Vol. 1, Pt. 2). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2006, , page 27‚Äì31. Reign According to archaeological records, Adjib introduced a new royal title which he thought to use as some kind of complement to the Nisut-Bity-title: the Nebuy-title, written with the doubled sign of a falcon on a short standard. It means \\"The two lords\\" and refers to the divine state patrons Horus and Seth. It also symbolically points to Lower- and Upper Egypt. Adjib is thought to have legitimised his role as Egyptian king with the use of this title.Nicolas-Christophe Grimal: A History of Ancient Egypt. Wiley-Blackwell, London/New York 1994, , page 53 & 54. Clay seal impressions record the foundation of the new royal fortress Hor nebw-khet (\\"Horus, the gold of the divine community\\") and the royal residence Hor seba- khet (\\"Horus, the star of the divine community\\").Stan Hendrickx, Barbara Adams & K. M. Cialowicz: Egypt at its origins: studies in memory of Barbara Adams - proceedings of the international conference \\"Origin of the State, Predynastic and Early Dynastic Egypt. Peeters Publishers, Leuven 2004, , page 1137. Stone vessel inscriptions show that during Adjib's reign an unusually large number of cult statues were made for the king. At least six objects show the depicting of standing statues representing the king with his royal insignia. Seal impression of king Anedjib Stone vessel inscriptions record that Adjib commemorated a first and even a second Heb Sed (a throne jubilee), a feast that was celebrated the first time after 30 years of a king's reign, after which it was repeated every third or fourth year.Jean Daniel Degreef: The Heb Set Festival, Sequence and pBrooklyn 47.218.50, in: G√∂ttinger Miscellen, vol. 223 (2009); , page 27-34. But recent investigations suggest that every object showing the Hebsed and Adjib's name together were removed from king Den's tomb. It would seem that Adjib had simply erased and replaced Den's name with his own. This is seen by egyptologists and historians as evidence that Adjib never celebrated a Hebsed and thus his reign was relatively short. Egyptologists such as Nicolas Grimal and Wolfgang Helck assume that Adjib, as Den's son and rightful heir to the throne, may have been quite old when he ascended the Egyptian throne. Helck additionally points to an unusual feature; All Hebsed pictures of Adjib show the notation Qesen (\\"calamity\\") written on the stairways of the Hebsed pavilion. Possibly the end of Adjib's reign was a violent one. Tomb Adjib's burial site was excavated at Abydos and is known as \\"Tomb X\\". It measures 16.4 x 9.0 metres and is the smallest of all royal tombs in this area. Adjib's tomb has its entrance at the eastern side and a staircase leads down inside. The burial chamber is surrounded by 64 subsidiary tombs and simply divided by a cut-off wall into two rooms.G√ºnter Dreyer: Zur Rekonstruktion der Oberbauten der K√∂nigsgr√§ber der 1.

Chr.

(Museo del Prado). Juan de Mariana , also known as Father Mariana (25 September 1536 ‚Äì 17 February 1624), was a Spanish Jesuit priest, Scholastic, historian, and member of the Monarchomachs.Wm. A. Dunning. \\"The Monarchomachs.\\" Political Science Quarterly 19, no. 2 (1904): 277-301. doi:10.2307/2140284. Life Juan de Mariana was born in Talavera, Kingdom of Toledo. He studied at the Complutense University of Alcal√° de Henares and was admitted at the age of 17 into the Society of Jesus. In 1561, he went to teach theology in Rome, reckoning among his pupils Robert Bellarmine, afterwards cardinal; then passed into Sicily; and in 1569 he was sent to Paris, where his expositions of the writings of Thomas Aquinas attracted large audiences. In 1574, owing to ill health, he obtained permission to return to Spain; the rest of his life being passed at the Jesuits' house in Toledo in vigorous literary activity. He died in Madrid. Works Mariana's great work, Historiae de rebus Hispaniae, first appeared in twenty books at Toledo in 1592; ten books were subsequently added (1605), bringing the work down to the accession of Charles V in 1519, and in a still later abstract of events the author completed it to the accession of Philip IV in 1621. It was so well received that Mariana was induced to translate it into Spanish (the first part in 1601; completed, 1609; English translation by J. Stevens, 1699). Mariana's Historiae, though in many parts uncritical, is regarded for its research, accuracy, sagacity and style. Of his other works the most interesting is the treatise De rege et regis institutione (On the king and the royal institution, Toledo, 1598).In its sixth chapter the question whether it is lawful to overthrow a tyrant is freely discussed and answered in the affirmative, a circumstance which brought much odium upon the Jesuits, especially after the assassination of Henry IV of France, in 1610. A volume entitled Tractatus VII. theologici et historici (published by Mariana in Cologne in 1609, containing in particular a tract, De morte et immortalitate, and another, De monetae mutatione (On the Alteration of Money)) was put upon the Index Expurgatorius, and led to the confinement of its author by the Inquisition. It has been suggested that either the De rege et regis institutione or the De monetae mutatione influenced Chapter 29 of Part One of Cervantes's Don Quijote. During his confinement there was found among his papers a criticism upon the Jesuits, which was printed after his death as Discursus de erroribus qui in forma gubernationis societatis Jesu occurrunt (A discourse on the sickness of the Jesuit order, Bordeaux, 1625), and was reprinted by order of Charles III when he banished the Jesuits from Spain. According to Marjorie Grice-Hutchinson, an academic economist specializing in the School of Salamanca, Juan de Mariana and the Spanish scholastics provided much of the theoretical basis for Austrian School economic thought. =Works in English translation= * \\"A Treatise on the Alteration of Money,\\" Journal of Markets and Morality, Vol. V, No. 2, Fall 2002. * \\"On the Coinage,\\" Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics, Vol. XXI, No. 2, Summer 2018.

It is overlooked by Todleth Hill, Roundton Hill and Corndon Hill. The rivers Caebitra and Camlad have their confluence just outside the village. The nearest town is Montgomery. In the 2011 census the village had a population of 708. The community of Churchstoke covers a wider area than the village, including the neighbouring villages of Hyssington and The Marsh. Recently the detached part of the community around Weston Madoc was transferred to Montgomery's community.Powys County Council Churchstoke boundary review The community is situated on a salient and covers an area of over . Etymology The placename identifies it as a farm (or settlement) with a church; recorded as 'Cirestoc' in 1086 in the Domesday Book. St. Nicholas Church The parish church today is largely the result of 19th- century rebuilding, but it retains its 13th-century tower with a later timber belfry. From the period prior to the 19th century, only a font, a stoup and a chest have survived up to three phases of restoration and reconstruction. The main body of the church with its large high pitched roof dates to the second half of the 19th century, although the sequence of construction is not completely clear. The layout of the churchyard and its location immediately above the River Camlad suggests an early medieval origin. In 1881 the interior was laid out in its present form and the church was rededicated to St. Nicholas (having previously been dedicated to St. Mary). The church has a 13th-century square tower at the western end, reduced in height in 1812 with a typical Montgomeryshire style timber-framed belfry and a pyramidal roof which was re-tiled with oak roof shingles in 2005. The tower was used as a place of refuge during 14th-century feuds and later in English Civil War battles. In 1646 the Parliamentarians attacked the Royalists who were planning to stay overnight at Churchstoke. The Royalists took refuge in the church and in the ensuing battle the Parliamentarians set fire to the church door forcing the Royalists to surrender. The wooden belfry and the spire were added in 1815. The clock was installed in 1887. There is a suggestion that the tower was originally higher than it stands now. In 1751 the south wall of the church was taken down and a new south aisle was constructed. In 1812 the old church was taken down and a new nave was built using stone from Churchstoke Hall and Churchstoke Quarries. It was roofed with slate from Corndon Hill and included a schoolroom and galleries. The present iron columns, made in Coalbrookdale presumably carried the galleries. The columns have octagonal stone bases and square decorative capitals; they now support the lowered roofline. In 1881 the schoolroom and galleries were removed along with the old box pews and the interior was laid out in its present form. The exterior buttresses were added together with the nave windows and the ground level lowered around the church. The north and south walls of the chancel were rebuilt, and a new south porch was added. The aisles are divided from the nave by arcades of six bays above which is a frieze of timber arcading. The chancel is supposed to have been added in 1867 and is narrower than the nave. There are encaustic floor tiles throughout the chancel and sanctuary, and the tiled reredos has recently been uncovered. There is a piscina in the south wall of the chancel, and three 19th Century brasses. These were probably added in 1867. The south transept houses the organ and the north transept forms the choir vestry underneath which is the boiler house. The church is situated in a raised sub-circular churchyard which has been extended in recent times. A few signs of musket shots from the skirmishes in the Civil War can still be seen, notably on the soffit of the upper storey round-headed window on the north wall of the tower. The graveyard extension to the west of the church was consecrated in 1868. The earliest gravestone recorded is a sandstone slab to Sarah (died 1749) and Hugh Pugh (died 1768). There is a sundial without gnomon on the south side of the church near the entrance porch. There are many fine mature trees in the graveyard, which are protected by law, as they are in the Conservation Area. According to a local legend, the church in the nearby hamlet of Hyssington has a miniature bull buried beneath the church step. It is said that the bull terrorised the neighbourhood until it was exorcised by twelve priests. Although physically in Wales, the churches at Hyssington and Churchstoke are within the Church of England Diocese of Hereford.  Methodist church  Churchstoke Methodist Church Churchstoke English Methodist church was built in 1879 and is of polychromatic brick with a slate roof. It is in the Gothic style, with a gable entry plan. The front the church has a plaque inscribed \\"Methodist Church erected 1879\\". Today The village has many facilities including a large supermarket (Harry Tuffins), as well as a primary school, two public houses (The Horse and Jockey and The Court House Hotel), a Chinese takeaway and fresh locally made ice cream. A market is also held here on Sundays. The central area of Churchstoke is a conservation area. According to the 2011 Census, Churchstoke is the community with the 2nd lowest proportion of Welsh speakers in Wales. Only 4.3% of people in the community claim to speak the language. According to details published by the Co-Operative Group on its bottles, both Co-Op Fairbourne Springs Water and their Sparkling Natural Mineral Water are bottled at source in Churchstoke. Governance Churchstoke has a community council representing the community's interests, with nine councillors elected from Churchstoke and three from Hyssington.Churchstoke Community Council, Churchstoke Community.

Joint Task Force Katrina was a joint operation between the United States Department of Defense and the Federal Emergency Management Agency created on September 1, 2005 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi to organize relief efforts along the Gulf Coast in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The operation was headed by U.S. Army Lieutenant General Russel L. Honor√©. Joint Task Force Katrina took over operations from United States Northern Command that had some elements in place before Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast. Included in this was a joint mission of USAF Reserve Security Forces personnel at Kelly Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas. Their mission was to protect Air Force resources and personnel if the displaced persons being housed in shelters at Kelly AFB were to cause a civil disturbance. History JTF Katrina was established the day after Hurricane Katrina finished its path through the Gulf coast. It was established on September 1, 2005 to coordinate the Department of Defense (DOD) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) relief plans for the areas effected by Hurricane Katrina. At its creation Joint Task Force Katrina had about 7,000 National Guardsmen in Mississippi, 10,000 in Alabama, 6,500 in Louisiana, and 8,200 in Florida ready for duty. These troops had originally been put in place by Northern Command. First actions taken were flying helicopters for medical- evacuations that were started on September 1. The aircraft for these operations came from across the United States. Some came from as far as California to help in the relief effort. Pilots of these aircraft orders ranged from flying along the coastline looking for survivors and transporting food, water, and medical supplies to all of the refuge camps across the Gulf. Numerous Naval ships were sent to assist in the aid of the Gulf. for instance the Iwo Jima amphibious Readiness Group sailed from Virginia which consisted of the USS Iwo Jima (LHD-7), USS Shreveport (LPD-12), USS Tortuga (LSD-46) and USNS Arctic (T-AOE-8). The ships were loaded with disaster response equipment which went to Louisiana. In addition, the USNS Comfort (T-AH-20) came from Maryland to give medical supplies to the relief effort. The USS Grapple also was called in to do underwater salvaging of flooded areas throughout the Gulf coast. Multiple working staging areas were set up on multiple air force bases that included Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama; Naval Air Station Meridian, Mississippi; Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana ; Alexandria, Louisiana; and Fort Polk, Louisiana. These were set up to speed up movement of supplies and soldiers to get to needed areas. Joint Task Force Katrina eventually was relocated from Camp Shelby to the Iwo Jima that was in port in New Orleans. The United States Military also had 355 helicopters and 93 planes to the relief effort. Not including the 63,000 Active Soldiers that were also contributing to the cause.

They are large cast- iron sculptures scattered throughout the city of Paris, France, mainly along the most-frequented sidewalks. They are named after the Englishman Richard Wallace, who financed their construction. A great aesthetic success, they are recognized worldwide as one of the symbols of Paris. A Wallace Fountain can be seen outside the Wallace Collection in London, the gallery that houses the works of art collected by Sir Richard Wallace and the first four Marquesses of Hertford. Background During the Franco-Prussian War, Paris went through difficult times. The city was quickly rebuilt, despite the ravages it had suffered. In less than ten years, it was transformed, with new buildings (the Paris Opera, for example) and new boulevards (the Raspail and the St-Germain). Additionally, philanthropy was in fashion among the wealthy bourgeoisie, who financed numerous \\"good works\\" (such as the Red Cross and the Salvation Army) to uphold their image. Sir Richard Wallace Sir Richard Wallace caricatured as a Wallace fountain, by Georges Lafosse published in Le Trombinoscope Among these philanthropists, Sir Richard Wallace (1818‚Äì1890) was one of the most eclectic and reserved. Having inherited a large fortune from his father in August 1870, he decided that all Parisians should profit from it, which made him popular. Wallace's devotion led him to remain in his Parisian villa even as the city was besieged, rather than take refuge on one of his palatial estates, to be in Paris when he was needed. He founded a hospital, where he personally welcomed victims of the bombings and distributed supplies, among his other efforts on behalf of Parisians at war. He remained faithful to his adopted nation, France, and is buried at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. Of his numerous contributions to Parisian heritage, the best known today are the fountains which bear his name. Why fountains? As a result of the siege of Paris and the Commune episode, many aqueducts had been destroyed, and the price of water, already higher than normal, increased considerably. Because of this, most of the poor had to pay for water. Moreover, most of the water provided by vendors was drawn from the Seine river and was likely to be dirty, as run-off from streets and many of sewers drained into it. Hence it was safer to drink beer or other alcoholic beverages, and almost as cheap as water. The temptation to take to liquor was strong among the lower classes, and it was considered a moral duty to keep them from falling into alcoholism. Even today, when water and hygiene are not a problem for the majority of Parisians, these fountains are often the only sources of free water for the homeless. The poor are not the only beneficiaries of these installations. Even if the aim of the fountains was to allow people of modest means to have access to drinking water, they are not the only ones who use them. Anyone passing by may quench his thirst, fulfilling this vital need. There was already a programme of constructing temperance fountains in both the United States and in the United Kingdom. Not only did the fountains accomplish Wallace's philosophy of helping the needy, but they also beautified Paris. Conception Richard Wallace designed the fountains himself and intended them to be beautiful as well as useful. The fountains had to meet several strict guidelines: *Height: They had to be tall enough to be seen from afar but not so tall as to destroy the harmony of the surrounding landscape. *Form: Both practical to use and pleasing to the eye. *Price: Affordable enough to allow the installation of dozens. *Materials: Resistant to the elements, easy to shape, and simple to maintain. The locations, as well as the color (a dark green, like all urban development of that era, in order to blend in with the parks and tree-lined avenues), were quickly chosen by the city government. Wallace created two different models, which were followed by two additional models, thus there were four types of Wallace fountains varying in such properties as height and motif. They were made of cast iron. Inexpensive, easy to mold, and robust, it was one of the most popular materials of the age. The majority of the cost was paid for by Wallace. The city of Paris allocated 1,000 francs for the large model and 450 francs for the wall-mounted model. The fountains are still molded by the historical foundry G.H.M Sculptor Wishing that his project be completed as rapidly as possible, Wallace called on Charles-Auguste Lebourg, a sculptor from Nantes whom he knew and whose talents were already renowned. Lebourg improved Wallace's sketches, already studied and thought- provoking, to make the fountains true works of art. For the large model, Lebourg created four caryatids representing kindness, simplicity, charity and sobriety. Each one is different from her sisters, by the way she bends her knees and where her tunic is tucked into her blouse. Different models The first two models (large model and applied model) were conceived and financed by Sir Richard Wallace. The two other models were created following the success of their predecessors inspired by the same styles and the resemblance is obvious. The more recent designs are not as strongly steeped in Wallace's aesthetic ideals, that in true Renaissance style, they should be useful, beautiful, and symbolic, in addition to being real works of art. =Large model= (size: 2.71 m, 610 kg) The large model was conceived by Sir Richard Wallace, and was inspired by the Fontaine des Innocents. On a foundation of Hauteville stone rests an octagonal pedestal on which four caryatids are affixed with their backs turned and their arms supporting a pointed dome decorated by dolphins. The water is distributed in a slender trickle issuing from the center of the dome and falls down into a basin that is protected by a grille. To make distribution easier, two tin-plated, iron cups attached to the fountain by a small chain were at the drinker's desire, staying always submerged for cleanliness. These cups were removed in 1952 \\"for Hygiene reasons\\" by demand of the Council of Public Hygiene of the old Department of the Seine. For more information, see the Technical File (in French). =Wall- mounted model= (size: 1.96 m, 300 kg) Sir Richard's other model.The French term 'Mod√®le en applique' is similar to :fr:Applique murale meaning wall lamp or sconce, as opposed to a free-standing model. In the middle of a semi- circular pediment, the head of a naiad issues a trickle of water that falls into a basin resting between two pilasters. Two goblets allowed the water to be drunk, but they were retired under the 1952 law cited above. This model, costing little to install, was to have been many units along the lengths of the walls of buildings with strong humanitarian focus, e.g. hospitals. This was not the case, and they do not remain today except for one situated on rue Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. =Small model= (size: 1.32 m, 130 kg) These are simple pushbutton fountains that one can find in squares and public gardens and are marked with the Parisian Seal (although the one installed on the Place des Invalides lacks this seal). They are familiar to mothers who bring their children to play in the many small parks in Paris. Measuring only 4'-3\\" and weighing 286 lbs., they were commissioned by the mayor of Paris more frequently than its older sister models. =Colonnade model= (size: 2.50 m, a little more than 500 kg) This model was the last to be realized. The general shape resembles that of the Large Model and the caryatids were replaced with small columns to reduce the cost of fabrication. The dome was also less pointy and the lower part more curved. Although 30 of these were made, today there remain only two, one on rue de R√©musat and the other on avenue des Ternes. Placement People drinking from a Wallace fountain during Bastille Day celebrations in 1911 The choice of the location of the fountains was left to the city of Paris. They needed to be placed at the will of the public in a practical manner and integrated in the most harmonious fashion with the environment. Most were placed in squares or at the intersections of two roads. The responsibility for choosing such locations fell to Eugene Belgrand, a hydraulic engineer and Director of Water and Sewers of Paris who worked with the prefect Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann. Today Most of the 100 grand model Wallace fountains currently in Paris function and distribute perfectly potable water. Once, these fountains were rare points of free water in the city, much to the relief of the homeless and poor. Today, they are among more than 1,200 points of free, clean drinking water dispensed to citizens and visitors by the city water company, Eau de Paris. Sir Richard Wallace has achieved his goal. The fountains work from 15 March to 15 November (the risk of freezing during the months of winter would imperil the internal plumbing), are regularly maintained and are repainted every few years. They are an integral part of the Parisian landscape, of the same importance as the Eiffel Tower or the street urchins of Montmartre. In Am√©lie, the cinegraphic piece about the glory of Parisian folklore, Jean-Pierre Jeunet baptised a personality Madeleine Wallace (she cried like a madeleine, or like a Wallace fountain), although the English subtitled version renamed the character of Madeleine, to Madeleine Wells for cultural understanding. Wallace Fountains have been a beloved part of the Paris streetscape for almost 150 years. These monuments have never suffered from public criticism. They have always been respected. However, only two Wallace Fountains, both located in Place Louis L√©pine, are classified as registered historic monuments.http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=RETROUVER&REQ;=((PA00086269):REF) In 2018, the Society of the Wallace Fountains (La Soci√©t√© des Fontaines Wallace) was registered in France as an international, non-profit association governed by the French law of July 1901. The Society's purpose is education and information. Its mission is to promote, preserve and protect the Wallace Fountains for future generation. In addition, the Society recognizes and encourages partnerships for the common good in the spirit of Sir Richard Wallace.

He has written on Art Deco, and also a biography of Sir John Betjeman. Life and work Hillier was born in Redhill, Surrey, where the family lived at 27, Whitepost Hill.Writers' Directory, 1980‚Äì1982, Macmillan Press, 1979, p. 571 His father was Jack Hillier, an authority and author on Japanese art; his mother, Mary Louise (n√©e Palmer), was an authority on wax dolls and automata.The International Who's Who, 63rd edition, Europa Publications, 2000, p. 687 Hillier was educated at Reigate Grammar School and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he won the Gladstone Memorial Prize for History. He was employed as a journalist on The Times from 1963 (on the editorial staff until 1968; antiques correspondent from 1970 to 1984; deputy literary editor from 1981 to 1984). From 1984 to 1988, he was an associate editor of the Los Angeles Times.The International Who's Who, 63rd edition, Europa Publications, 2000, p. 687 He has since been a reviewer for The Spectator. In 1968 Hillier's book Art Deco of the 20s and 30s was published by Studio Vista. This was the first major work on a hitherto neglected genre of art that had previously been referred to as Art Moderne (the term Art Moderne has since come to be used to refer to the later streamlined style of Art Deco in the 1930s). Hillier's use of the term Art Deco became definitive. In 1971 Hillier curated a major Art Deco show at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, which helped to increase popular awareness of this style. In 1969 Studio Vista published Hillier's Cartoons and Caricatures, a study of caricature from the 13th century to the late 20th. Hillier has also written books on ceramics and posters, as well as The Style of the Century (1983), a review of the various styles of art in the 20th century, from Art Nouveau through psychedelia and pop art to punk. Hillier's major work, however, is the authorised biography of Sir John Betjeman. It took Hillier 25 years to research and write, and was published by John Murray in three volumes (1988, 2002 and 2004). A one-volume abridgement was published in 2006 for Betjeman's centenary. Betjeman letter hoax In August 2006 a rival biography of Betjeman was published by A. N. Wilson. It was later discovered to contain a hoax letter, purportedly by Betjeman, but actually containing an acrostic insulting Wilson. The letter had been sent to Wilson by \\"Eve de Harben\\", an anagram of \\"Ever been had?\\", and the first letters of each sentence, beginning with the second sentence, spelled out the message \\"A. N. Wilson is a shit.\\" Hillier was an immediate suspect for the literary forgery: the Sunday Times article revealing the hoax was accompanied by a prominent picture of Hillier and noted that an envelope containing a letter supposedly from de Harben to the newspaper had been bought in Winchester, his home town. Hillier initially denied responsibility, but soon admitted that he had written the letter. He explained that he had been angered by Wilson's negative review of the second volume of his biography of Betjeman, and by pre-publication publicity for Wilson's own biography.

However, the two generals were unable to control the rebel satrap and withdrew within the walls of the cities, leaving him in possession of the open country. After the later and final defeat of Molon by Antiochus, Theodotus was selected by that monarch to take the command in Coele-Syria, while Antiochus undertook to reduce Seleucia on the Tigris. What Theodotus accomplished is not known, but the next year (219 BC) he was serving under the immediate command of Antiochus and bearing an important share in the action against Nicolaus, one of the generals of Ptolemy IV Philopator (221-204 BC), near Porphyreon, as well as shortly after at the siege of Rabbatamana. On both these occasions he was associated with Nicarchus, with whom he also shared command of the phalanx during the Battle of Raphia, 217 BC. After that major defeat he was chosen by Antiochus as one of the ambassadors whom he sent to Ptolemy to sue for peace. References *Polybius; Histories, Evelyn S.

The UKWMO was established in 1957 and funded by the Home Office and used its own premises which were mainly staffed by Royal Observer Corps (ROC) uniformed full-time and volunteer personnel as the fieldforce. The ROC was administered by the Ministry of Defence but mainly funded by the Home Office. The only time the combined organisations were on high alert in the Cold War was during Cuban Missile Crisis in October and November 1962. The organisation was wound up and disbanded in November 1992 following a review prompted by the government's Options for Change report. Its emblem-of-arms was a pair of classic hunting horns crossing each other, pointed upwards, with the enscrolled motto \\"Sound An Alarm\\", a title also used for the latter of two contemporary public information films (the earlier one was called \\"Hole in the Ground\\"). Members of the UKWMO qualified for the Civil Defence Medal for fifteen years continuous years service, with a bar for each subsequent twelve years. The task The United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation had five main functions in the event of nuclear war. These were: # Warning the public of any air attack. # Providing confirmation of nuclear strike. # Warning the public of the approach of radioactive fall- out. # Supplying the civilian and military authorities in the United Kingdom and neighbouring countries in NATO with details of nuclear bursts and with a scientific assessment of the path and intensity of fall-out # Provision of a post-attack meteorological service Operational organisation =Professional full-time staff= Headquarters UKWMO was located in a converted barracks building at Cowley Barracks in Cowley, Oxfordshire, and was headed by a Director and Deputy Director supported by a small administrative staff. Five professional Sector Controllers and five Assistant Sector Controllers were co-located at the five UKWMO Sector Controls. =Sparetime volunteers= At each of the twenty five UKWMO group controls the UKWMO was represented by volunteer and specially trained members. In the event of war the senior UKWMO volunteer present would command the group as Group Controller. Assessing the nuclear burst and fallout information and data provided by the ROC was a team of ten or more Warning Officers led by a Chief Warning Officer. The members of the warning team were recruited from mainly local secondary school science teachers, or commercial engineers and technicians with a scientific education and background. They trained every two weeks from printed materials provided by the Home Office scientific branch and through lectures or practical training organised by the Assistant Sector Controller who was the area UKWMO training officer. =During operations= WB1401 warning receiver in a former local authority control centre The Director UKWMO would be located at the United Kingdom Regional Air Operations Command (UK RAOC) within Strike Command's Operations Centre nuclear bunker at RAF High Wycombe to instigate the four-minute warning. The Deputy Director would be located at a standby UK RAOC, described at the time as being \\"elsewhere in the UK\\". It's since been revealed as being at Goosnargh, Lancashire, within the UKWMO Western Sector nuclear bunker. Warnings were instantly distributed around the country by the Warning Broadcast System via 250 Carrier Control Points located at major police headquarters and 17,000 WB400 (later WB1400) carrier receivers in armed forces headquarters, hospitals, post offices, ROC posts and private homes in remote rural areas where hand-operated sirens replaced the power sirens in the urban towns. Sparetime warning team members were activated, through a rehearsed transition to war telephone calling card procedure, by wholetime Royal Observer Corps officers located at the twenty five group headquarters. UKWMO communications used private wires (PWs) (permanently available and with greater protection) or emergency circuits (ECs) (switched for exercises or in the event of an emergency) for data and voice with a radio back up option. Some other UKWMO telephone lines and the warning broadcast system were protected by the Post Office's Telephone Preference Scheme that kept the lines active while the general public's system could be progressively attenuated under wartime regulations. =Specialist training= Both wholetime and sparetime UKWMO personnel undertook specialist residential training at the Emergency Planning College, The Hawkhills, Easingwold, Yorkshire. Several major war simulation exercises were held each year 2 x WARMON (Warning and Monitoring) one day UK exercises and the two-day INTEX (International exercise) along with other NATO countries. Four times a year minor and limited exercises called POSTEX were held on a stop ‚Äì start basis across three evenings of a week, Monday to Wednesday. Realistic simulation material was provided for realtime simulations of a nuclear attack. Approximately every four or five years each group was subjected to a \\"no notice\\" and in depth assessment similar to an RAF \\"TACEVAL\\" or Tactical Evaluation, where a mixed team of UKWMO and ROC full-time staff would appear and evaluate all aspects of the group's planning and operations under realistic wartime conditions over a period of 48 hours. =Modernisation= A large amount of work was completed from the mid 1980s to bring the UKWMO up to date. Modern detection instruments were provided to the ROC together with back up detectors at certain Sector or Group Controls known as Atomic Weapons Detection Recognition and Estimation of Yield (AWDREY) equipment. Updated warning equipment was installed in most government buildings, nuclear bunkers, armed forces HQs, police and fire stations and private houses in remote areas. Major police stations were used as the area control points for power operated sirens, so these were equipped with new WB1400 carrier control warning equipment. If a warning was received then the police could operate the sirens via remote control, the carrier warning signal did not automatically operate the warning sirens (a few of which were those used in the Second World War). Many of the sirens are still in operation in coastal areas and are now used for emergency flood warning. Between 1985 and 1990 all communications links used by the warning system, the UKWMO and the ROC were upgraded and hardened against the effects of electromagnetic pulse damage. Point-to-point SX2000 automated telephone exchanges were installed in the UKWMO Sector and Group Controls and old fashioned telegraph equipment was replaced with modern computerised message switching equipment. =Air raid warnings= Ballistic missile air raid warnings for the UK would have originated from the shared UK/USA Ballistic Missile Early Warning System in England, (the site is now upgraded and still operational at RAF Fylingdales, on the North York Moors) and disseminated through UKRAOC to the carrier warning system. This was commonly, and slightly erroneously, known as the Four minute warning. =Instrumentation= WB400 receiver on the desk For the detection of nuclear bursts * \\"Atomic Weapons Detection Recognition and Estimation of Yield\\", known as \\"AWDREY\\", was a desk-mounted automatic instrument, located at certain UKWMO controls, that detected nuclear explosions and indicated the estimated size in megatons. Operating by measuring the level of electromagnetic pulse (EMP), the instruments were tested daily by wholetime ROC officers and regularly reacted to the EMP from lightning strikes during thunderstorms. AWDREY was designed and built by the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston and tested for performance and accuracy on a real nuclear explosion at the 1957 Kiritimati (or Christmas Island) nuclear bomb test (after being mounted on board a ship). Reports following a reading on AWDREY were prefixed with the codeword \\"Tocsin Bang\\". * The \\"Bomb Power Indicator\\" or \\"BPI\\" consisted of a peak overpressure gauge with a dial that would register when the pressure wave from a nuclear explosion passed over the post. When related to the distance of the explosion from the post this pressure would indicate the power of the explosion. Reports following a reading on the BPI were preceded by the codeword \\"Tocsin\\". * The \\"Ground Zero Indicator\\", or \\"GZI\\" or shadowgraph, consisted of four horizontally mounted cardinal compass point pinhole cameras within a metal drum; each \\"camera\\" contained a sheet of photosensitive paper on which were printed horizontal and vertical calibration lines. The flash from a nuclear explosion would produce a mark on one or two of the papers within the drum. The position of the mark enabled the bearing and height of the burst to be estimated. With triangulation between neighbouring posts these readings would give an accurate height and position. The altitude of the explosion was important because a ground or near-ground burst would produce radioactive fallout, whereas an air burst would produce only short-distance and short- lived initial radiation (but no fallout). Reports following a reading on the GZI were preceded by the codeword \\"Nuclear Burst\\". For the measurement of ionising radiation * The \\"Radiac Survey Meter No 2\\" or \\"RSM\\" was a 1955-meter which counted the particles produced by radioactive decay. This meter suffered from a number of disadvantages: it required three different types of obsolete batteries, it also contained delicate valves that were prone to failure and it had to be operated from outside the protection of the post. These were favoured as they had been tested on fallout in Australia after the Operation Buffalo nuclear tests, and remained in use until 1982 by commissioning a manufacturer to regularly produce special production runs of the obsolete batteries. Within the ROC the RSM was superseded in 1958 by the FSM and the RSM retained only for post-attack mobile monitoring missions. * The \\"Fixed Survey Meter\\" or \\"FSM\\" introduced in 1958, could be operated from within the post with a cable leading to the detector mounted externally and protected by a polycarbonate dome. The FSM used the same obsolete high-voltage batteries as the RSM. In 1985 this instrument was replaced by the \\"PDRM 82(F)\\". * The \\"PDRM82\\" or Portable Dose Rate Meter and the desktop-fixed PDRM 82(F) version of the same meter, that were manufactured by Plessey and introduced during the 1980s, gave more accurate readings and used standard C-cell torch batteries that lasted many times longer, up to 400 hours of operation. The compact and robust instruments were housed in sturdy orange- coloured polycarbonate cases and had clear liquid crystal displays. * The \\"Dosimeter\\" pocket meters were issued to individual observers for measuring their personal levels of radiation absorption during operations. Three different grades of dosimeter were used, depending on ambient radiation levels. The original hand-wound and temperamental dosimeter charging units were replaced during the 1980s by battery-operated automatic charging units. Civil Defence Medal The Civil Defence Medal was instituted March 1961 and awarded for 15 years service in a variety of different organisations including; Auxiliary Fire Service, National Hospital Service Reserve, Civil Defence Corps and the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation. Disbanded UKWMO training effectively ceased in the summer of 1991 after the Home Secretary's stand-down announcement. When the UKWMO was disbanded, and the ROC stood down, the government referred to \\"possible future developments and improvements in automated nuclear explosion and fallout detection from remote sensors\\", but it is unlikely that any such system has yet to be developed or installed. Civil nuclear defence since 1992 has been devolved to UK local authories as an addition to their routine emergency planning responsibilities and under direction of the government's Civil Contingencies Secretariat but the four-minute warning air raid alert system no longer operates.

They split up in 2003, shortly after the release of their second album Hey Petrunko, but announced their reformation in April 2006 and began releasing music again soon thereafter. History =Early years= Ooberman founders Dan Popplewell and Andy Flett met over a piano at their school in Bradford, 1988. The first band they set up was The Forestry Commission, with Flett's younger brother, Steve on bass guitar. The band's life soon ended when Popplewell moved to Liverpool, but the three friends kept in touch. Steve Flett moved to Liverpool in 1992, and Andy Flett later joined him in 1996/7, after commuting back and forth from Birmingham where he was studying. Ooberman was then born, complete with Alan Kelly (Drums) and last member Sophia Churney (keyboards and vocals). The first Ooberman gig was in June 1997, and their eccentric live shows and quirky demos won them the 1997 BT Merseyside Arts Award for Best Newcomers. Their first release was the \\"Sugar Bum\\" 7\\" inch single on Graham Coxon's Transcopic record label, followed by the critically acclaimed \\"Shorley Wall\\" EP on Tugboat Records. The band then secured up a major recording contract with Independiente, on which they released their first proper single: the Top 40 hit \\"Blossoms Falling\\". =The Magic Treehouse= By Spring 1999, the band had finished work on their debut album, The Magic Treehouse. The album got generally positive reviews, including an 8/10 in NME. The reviews, however, did not translate into sales and after a handful of singles missed the Top 40, Independiente and Ooberman parted company, as did their publishing and management companies further down the line. The band (or rather Danny and Sophie) had reportedly had enough with the music industry by this time, but in mid-2000, they (or Rather Danny) started work on their second album. During this time, tension within band members caused the original drummer (Alan) to leave the band, to be replaced by Paul Walsham. =Hey Petrunko= After more than a year working on new material, the band announced that they would release their second album ‚Äì Hey Petrunko ‚Äì at the start of 2002. A mini- album, Running Girl, preceded it in October 2001. As well as getting another new drummer ‚Äì Jaymie Ireland, Popplewell also set up his own record label, Rotodisc. A five track EP ‚Äì \\"Bluebell Morning\\" ‚Äì and a single ‚Äì \\"Beany Bean\\" ‚Äì followed, but Hey Petrunko was delayed. After nearly three years working on the album, it was finally released on 3 March 2003, to some critical acclaim. A tour and another single followed, but the pressure of making Hey Petrunko strained the band, and in May, Popplewell announced that he and Churney were leaving the band. Rotodisc was shut down, and planned releases and tour dates (including festivals and foreign gigs) were scrapped. =Reformation= In February 2005, a website ‚Äì ooberman.net ‚Äì was launched, claiming to be \\"the new official Ooberman website\\". The website had an image, quite distinctly an album cover, entitled \\"Ooberman ‚Äì Rare Recordings\\". Nothing further was heard from the website until December 2005 when Popplewell stated that the new album would be a mix of old, unreleased and new songs. However, in April 2006, the ooberman.net site appeared in full, and a news update dated 20 April stated that \\"the band have now reformed and recorded a new album... there are no current plans to play live.\\" An album, entitled Carried Away was released in August 2006 by Rotodisc, distributed in the UK by Cargo Records. The release was preceded by an extremely limited 7\\" single, \\"The Beauty of Your Soul\\", on 19 June, and a download-only single ‚Äì also entitled \\"Carried Away\\" ‚Äì on 24 July that received radio airplay on stations including XFM and 6music, and prominently on Mark Radcliffe's BBC Radio 2 show. =Diversification= In December 2006, Rotodisc released an album by Symphonika entitled The Snow Queen. Symphonika is an orchestral side-project by Dan Popplewell, and the album featured the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and vocals by Sophia Churney. On 26 February 2007, Andy and Steve Flett released an album of material recorded during Ooberman's time apart under the name Ooberon. It was entitled Waiting For The Sonic Boom. In September 2007 the band released The Lost Tapes ‚Äì Rare Recordings 1991‚Äì2007, a collection of rare and unreleased recordings covering the period in the title. =Free music controversy= In August 2007 they announced on their webpage, that their entire back catalogue would be available for free download as a promotion for The Lost Tapes. Controversially, it included some material owned by Sony, and therefore the band effectively invited legal action from their former label. The Magic Theatre On 7 June 2010, a new album London Town featuring Ooberman members Sophia Churney and Dan Popplewell as \\"The Magic Theatre\\" was released accompanied by eleven free HD videos. The album's orchestral sound was achieved on a low budget by Popplewell writing library music, designed to be used as background for films and television, that fitted his songs, and re- using the recordings with new vocals by him and Sophia Churney. Discography Many of the band's releases have been issued on their own label, Rotodisc. =Albums= *1999 The Magic Treehouse *2001 Running Girl (mini album) *2003 Hey Petrunko *2006 Carried Away *2007 The Lost Tapes ‚Äì Rare Recordings 1991‚Äì2007 =Singles and EPs= *1998 \\"Sugar Bum\\" *1998 \\"Shorley Wall EP\\" *1999 \\"Blossoms Falling\\" *1999 \\"Million Suns\\" *1999 \\"Tears from a Willow\\" *2000 \\"Shorley Wall\\" *2000 \\"Dolphin Blue\\" *2001 \\"Running Girl\\" *2002 \\"Bluebell Morning EP\\" *2002 \\"Beany Bean\\" *2003 \\"First Day of the Holidays\\" *2006 \\"The Beauty of Your Soul\\" *2006 \\"Carried Away\\" (download only) *2006 \\"Crashing Ellipticals\\" (download only) References External links *Official website ‚Äì Ooberman's new official website, with details of the new album *The Magic Treehouse ‚Äì Long-running unofficial website with news, discography and song information *The Oobtube ‚Äì Ooberman forum *Ooberman on MySpace ‚Äì Officially endorsed MySpace page with audio streams Category:English indie rock groups Category:Musical groups from Liverpool Category:Independiente Records artists Category:Rough Trade Records artists ","title":"Ooberman"},{"id":"2619399","text":"Oostpoort with its drawbridge The eastern gate in Delft, Netherlands, is an example of Brick Gothic northern European architecture that was built around 1400.

Released for arcades in 1988 in Japan and in 1989 worldwide, the game was available in a four-player cocktail-style cabinet as well as a three-player upright cabinet. Home computer ports were published by Activision in 1990 for the Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and Atari ST. Gameplay It allows up to four players simultaneously, and the player competes in races with three other cars. It is possible to upgrade the car at a Parts Shop. Every time a player falls off screen, they aew penalized by having gas subtracted from their gas meter. If the gas meter reaches \\"0\\", the game is over. The player can pick up flashing targets symbolized with a \\"G\\". By picking up the target, 20 units gas will be added to the player's gas meter. If the player successfully crosses the finish line, they will be rewarded additional units of gas. After every race, the player goes to the Parts Shop to purchase upgrades for their car. These include three front or rear engines, three types of bumpers, three types of spoilers, and two types of tires. However, the selection of tires is abundant, and include radial tires, speed tires, spike tires, and snow tires. The player may equip either a front or rear engine, not both at once. It is also impossible to have a spoiler and a rear engine equipped simultaneously. There is a total of 30 different races across ten environments: busy highways, dirt roads, a beachside course, a mountain course, farmlands, snowy terrain, a desert, a construction zone, a shipyard, and city streets. There are 3 races per environment, with every third race taking the players to a stadium for a victory ceremony. Afterwards, the players find themselves in a new environment.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Hot Rod on their June 1, 1988 issue as being the fourth most- successful upright arcade unit of the year.

Biography  Sarrette was born in Bordeaux, the son of a shoemaker, and travelled to Paris as an accountant. During the French Revolution, he joined the Garde Nationale. There he proposed the formation of a corps of musicians, and was put in charge, although he was not a musician. He gathered together forty-five musicians from the depot of the Gardes Fran√ßaises, and they formed the nucleus for the music of the Garde Nationale, with Fran√ßois Joseph Gossec as artistic director. In May 1790, the municipality of Paris increased the body to seventy-eight musicians. When the financial embarrassments of the Commune necessitated the suppression of the paid guard, Sarrette kept the musicians near him and obtained from the municipality, in June 1792, the establishment of a free school of music. This cites Constant Pierre, B. Sarrette et les origines du Conservatoire (Paris, 1895). Sarrette was briefly imprisoned from 25 March to 10 May 1794, although the reasons are uncertain. On 18 Brumaire, Year II (8 November 1794), the school was converted into the Institut National de Musique by decree of the convention, and by the law of 16 Thermidor, Year III (3 August 1795), it was finally organized under the name of Conservatoire. Sarrette regained the title of director during the reorganization of 1800. The protection of Napoleon I was a source of disaster to him in 1815, when the conservatoire was closed; its subsequent history was watched by its founder as a mere spectator from outside. For the last forty four years of his life Sarrette lived in retirement, in some type of disgrace. He died in Paris on 13 April 1858 and is buried in that city's Montmartre Cemetery.

It contained primarily policy essays, but also book reviews, interviews, and historical essays. Most articles are commissioned. The last print issue of the journal was published in Winter 2017. Criticism In June 1991 authors Steven Emerson and Cristina del Sesto wrote that World Policy Journal \\"is a publication with a clear bias toward a pro-P.L.O. point of view\\", and that \\"In the entire history of that quarterly's publication, there has never been one analysis presenting the Israeli mainstream point of view.\\" World Policy Institute senior fellow Eric Alterman characterized their critique as \\"wild aspersions\\".  Praise  In a 2002 article, The New York Times described the magazine as \\"one of the voices of dissent in how the United States carries out the war on terror abroad\\", stating: \\"The World Policy Journal has little of the money or reach of Foreign Affairs, its august rival uptown.

They were notable for the Blackthorne 3-D Series, their reprint titles of classic comic strips like Dick Tracy, and their licensed products. Blackthorne achieved its greatest sales and financial success with their licensed 3-D comics adaptations of the California Raisins, but the financial loss suffered by the failure of their 3-D adaptation of Michael Jackson's film Moonwalker was a major contributor to the publisher's downfall.  History  Blackthorne was established in 1985 by husband-and-wife team Steve Schanes and Ann Fera, formerly associated with Pacific Comics (which had gone out of business in 1984). Schanes explained, \\"My abilities have always been to sell and promote, and I needed to have a job to pay my debts and to maintain a minimum life-style with my family. Since I could not locate enough work where I was living, I decided to start up another company, so I borrowed on my credit cards and started Blackthorne.\\" Schanes and Fera raised $16,000 to start Blackthorne (naming the company after the street on which they lived),Sanford, Jay Allen. \\"The History Of Comic Books In San Diego: The '80s,\\" San Diego Reader blog (September 14, 2008). mostly using their credit cards.\\"Comics publisher pins stellar hopes to Moonwalker.\\" San Diego Business Journal (March 6, 1989). Blackthorne's first title was Jerry Iger's Classic Sheena, with a cover date of April 1985, featuring Sheena, Queen of the Jungle reprints and a new Dave Stevens cover. (The book had originally been slated as a Pacific Comics release.) Despite early struggles due to their limited funds, Blackthorne steadily expanded during its first years. To increase their profitability and visibility, the company employed sales representatives which sold their comics to retail stores not covered by any comic book distributors, such as Hallmark Cards, Spencer Gifts, and 7-Elevens nationwide.\\"Blackthorne in 7-11s,\\" The Comics Journal #108 (May 1986), p. 19. By the end of 1987, according to Schanes, the company was publishing 22 comic books a month and was distributing to 900‚Äì1,200 gift stores not covered by comics distributors. Meanwhile, Blackthorne earned praise from critics and hobbyists for its reprints of classic newspaper comic strips.Harvey, R.C. \\"Bringing Back the Reprints\\" The Comics Journal #111 (September 1986), pp. 56‚Äì61: Reviews of reprints of newspaper comic strips by Blackthorne Publishing. Schanes chose to do newspaper strip reprints because they required less financial investment and because there was little competition in the field at the time. Blackthorne immediately bought the rights for 60 different newspaper strips, even though they knew they wouldn't be able to produce most of them for years at best, to lock out any competition in the field. In addition to their comic book line, Blackthorne published paperback books and created faux books for movie props; for instance, the comic books and technical manuals seen in the movie Russkies are all props crafted by Blackthorne Publishing. In 1987, however, with the company losing money on its color line, it cancelled those titles to focus on their 3-D books and black-and-white licensed products.\\"Blackthorne Cancels Color Comics Line, Will Refocus on Licensed Product,\\" The Comics Journal #117 (September 1987), p. 15. Blackthorne also suffered from the contemporaneous financial troubles of the Los Angeles-based distributor Sunrise Distributors.\\"Sunrise announces it may not pay some publishers until July,\\" The Comics Journal #115 (April 1987), p. 24. Sunrise went bankrupt in 1988, and although Blackthorne (along with fellow West Coast publisher Fantagraphics) sued the distributor,\\"Two Publishers Sue Sunrise Distributors,\\" The Comics Journal #120 (March 1988), p. 8.\\"Sunrise Creditors Meet,\\" The Comics Journal #122 (June 1988), p. 22. they were never able to recoup their losses.

In early 1989, the company was still the fifth-largest U.S. comics publisher, bringing in about $1 million in sales and boasting a staff of eight full-time editorial and production employees. They published about 240 different titles a year, with an average print run of about 10,000 copies each. The company made a fatal error, however, when they signed on to adapt the Michael Jackson film Moonwalker to a 3-D comic book. The publisher paid a large licensing fee for the property and when the Moonwalker comic flopped later that year, they experienced a large financial loss.Hudson, Laura. \\"The 5 Greatest Michael Jackson Moments in Comics,\\" Comics Alliance (June 26, 2009). By mid-1989 the company was outsourcing its operations,\\"Blackthorne Temporarily Contracts Operations,\\" The Comics Journal #130 (July 1989), pp. 27‚Äì28. and in November the company laid off eight of its nine employees, including editor-in-chief John Stephenson. $180,000 in debt, Blackthorne limped into 1990 before it finally folded.Hardie, Mary. \\"Cash-strapped comic book maker hits hard times again,\\" San Diego Business Journal (January 22, 1990).\\"Blackthorne Struggles to Stay Afloat,\\" The Comics Journal #134 (February 1990), pp. 7‚Äì8.

Early life Greer was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1955. He claims to have seen an unidentified flying object at close range when he was about eight years old, which inspired his interest in ufology. Greer was trained as a Transcendental Meditation teacher and served as director of a meditation organization. He received a B.S. degree in biology from Appalachian State University in 1982https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-greer-a3b48351 and an M.D. degree from the James H. Quillen College of Medicine of East Tennessee State University in 1987.Steven Macon Greer Virginia Board of Medicine, accessed Jan 20, 2013 He attended MAHEC University of North Carolina where he completed his internship in 1988 and received his Virginia medical license in 1989. That year, he became a member of the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society.\\"College of Medlclne ‚Äî Oelta of Tennessee Class of I987: Steven Macon Greer\\" Career Greer founded the Center for the Study of Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (CSETI) in 1990 to create a diplomatic and research-based initiative to contact extraterrestrial civilizations. The official statements regarding its intentions also included a new category of extraterrestrial encounters, namely CE-5 or 'close encounters of the fifth kind'. This was defined by Greer as human initiated contact and/or communication with extraterrestrial life. Since its inception, the organization has spent anywhere between $3.5 million and $5 million to achieve its goals. The organisation claims to have over 3,000 confirmed reports of UFO sightings by pilots, and over 4,000 proofs of what they describe as landing traces. This refers to incidents where UFOs have supposedly left behind trace evidence, such as electromagnetic readings, after landing on Earth. The organisation utilizes 'Rapid Mobilisation Investigative Teams' with the aim of arriving at landing sites as quickly as possible. CSETI has defined a protocol for human initiated contact to UFOs using consciousness. In 1993, he founded the Disclosure Project, a research project whose goal is to disclose to the public the government's alleged knowledge of UFOs, extraterrestrial intelligence, and advanced energy and propulsion systems. The Disclosure Project was founded in an effort to grant amnesty to government whistle-blowers willing to violate their security oaths by sharing insider knowledge about UFOs. Greer says he gave a briefing to CIA director James Woolsey at a dinner party, although Woolsey has stated that he listened politely. In October 1994, Greer appeared in Larry King's TV special The UFO Coverup? Alt URL In 1995, Greer worked as a physician at the Department of Emergency Medicine at Caldwell Memorial Hospital, where he was chairman. In 1997, Greer, along with other members of CSETI, including Apollo astronaut Edgar Mitchell, made a presentation at a background briefing for members of Congress. In 1998, Greer gave up his career as an emergency room physician in favor of the Disclosure Project. Alt URL In May 2001, Greer held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. that featured 20 retired Air Force, Federal Aviation Administration and intelligence officers. Greer authored Unacknowledged: An Expos√© of the World's Greatest Secret in 2017. The book is also the subject of a 2017 documentary film, titled Unacknowledged, directed by Michael Mazzola. Sirius In 2013, Greer co- produced Sirius, a documentary detailing his work and hypotheses regarding extraterrestrial life, government cover-ups and close encounters of the fifth kind. The film was directed by Amardeep Kaleka and narrated by Thomas Jane, and covers Greer's 2006 book Hidden Truth, Forbidden Knowledge. The movie premiered on April 22, 2013, in Los Angeles, California, and features interviews from former government and military officials. Sirius depicts a six-inch human skeleton known as the Atacama skeleton, and features images and a DNA test of the skeleton. Genetic evidence showed that it was human, with genetic markers found in \\"indigenous women from the Chilean region of South America\\". The director of the center that did the analysis said, \\"It's an interesting medical mystery of an unfortunate human with a series of birth defects that currently [...] the genetics of which are not obvious.\\" Other documentaries about Steven Greer's work In 2017 Unacknowledged was produced and is distributed by Netflix. Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind: Contact has Begun was released April 2020. The documentary was directed and written by Michael Mazzola and stars Dr. Steven M. Greer.

His 12 books include the critically acclaimed Acheson: The Secretary of State Who Created the American World (1998), the definitive biography of former Secretary of State Dean Acheson. In a debate during the 2000 presidential primary, George W. Bush referred to Chace's Acheson as one of the books he was reading at the time. His writings, known for elegant and even literary prose, often influenced American thought in policymaking ‚Äî his coining of the phrase \\"the indispensable nation\\" with Sidney Blumenthal to describe America was widely used when Secretary of State Madeleine Albright began including it in her speeches. Chace was born and raised in Fall River, Massachusetts. His family, of the New England aristocracy, lost nearly everything during the Great Depression after the collapse of the Fall River cotton-mill economy. This experience he later described in his 1990 memoir What We Had. Chace graduated from Harvard University with a degree in Classics. He went to France in 1954 to conduct graduate-study research on painter Eug√®ne Delacroix and writer Charles Baudelaire, but soon found his interest drawn to the current intellectual arena of literature and politics, which led to an intense interest in French political writers including Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre. He returned to France later the same year as a soldier and in 1955 and 1956 worked as an Army translator, which involved the translation of French newspapers for the Central Intelligence Agency. While in France he wrote a novel and was witness to the impact of that nation's withdrawal from Vietnam and its problems with a rebellion in colonialized Algeria. After his return to the United States his interest in foreign policy grew as he served as managing editor for East Europe, a political review of Soviet bloc affairs, from 1959 to 1969, during which time he wrote his book Conflict in the Middle East about the Six-Day War. He also served as the managing editor of the foreign policy journal Interplay (1967‚Äì1970) and Foreign Affairs (1970‚Äì1983). He became editor of the World Policy Journal in 1993, where he served for 7 years. In 1990, he was appointed Professor of Government at Bard College in Annandale- on-Hudson, in upstate New York. He later helped found and chair Bard's international affairs program, the Bard Globalization and International Affairs Program (BGIA), in New York City. His pieces were frequently printed on newspaper op-ed pages and he contributed to the New York Times Book Review in the 1980s and 1990s. Chace's work focused on American statesmanship, the interplay of American interests with American values, and the use of American power. He believed that any statesman effectively leading a nation will understand that resources are limited ‚Äî including blood and political will ‚Äî and that in protecting the interests of the nation those resources cannot be overtaxed. According to fellow writer and good friend Mark Danner, Chace considered the Vietnam War a classic example of a nation failing to prudently balance interests and resources, and saw the Iraq War as another example. Chace died from a heart attack in Paris while doing research for a biography of the Marquis de Lafayette, which would have been his tenth book. At the time of his death, Chace resided in New York City and was survived by former wives Jean Valentine and Susan Denvir Chace, his long-time companion Joan Bingham, and daughters Sarah, Rebecca, and Zoe. He was a close friend and mentor of military historian and author Caleb Carr and historian David Fromkin. He had two grand daughters, Rebecca and Pesha.

He was called Castro Forte (\\"Stronghold\\" or \\"Strong Castle\\") by the poet Lu√≠s de Cam√µes. De Castro was the second son of √Ålvaro de Castro, the civil governor of Lisbon. His wife was Leonor de Coutinho.  Early life  As the younger son of √Ålvaro de Castro, Jo√£o was destined for the church. He studied mathematics under Pedro Nunes, along with Louis, Duke of Beja, son of King Manuel I of Portugal, with whom he formed a lifelong friendship. At eighteen, he went to Tangier for several years, where he was knighted by Dom Duarte de Menezes, the governor.  Voyages to India and the expedition to Egypt  In 1535 de Castro accompanied Dom Louis to the siege of Tunis, where he refused knighthood and rewards from Emperor Charles V. When de Castro returned to Lisbon, the king awarded him the small commandership of S√£o Paulo de Salvaterra in 1538. Soon after, de Castro left for India with his uncle Garcia de Noronha, and participated in the relief of Diu upon his arrival at Goa. In 1540 he served on an expedition to Suez under Est√™v√£o da Gama (the son of Vasco da Gama and then viceroy of Portuguese India), who knighted his son, √Ålvaro de Castro in recognition of D. Jo√£o. After Noronha's death, da Gama succeeded him, and de Castro joined da Gama on an expedition to the Red Sea. Da Gama departed on December 31, 1540, with 12 large galleons (one of which was captained by de Castro) and carracks, and 60 galleys. De Castro kept a detailed journal of the voyage with maps, calculations, pictures, and detailed notes of the coasts of the Arabian Peninsula and regions that are known as Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt today. He traveled to Suez and other ports in the shores of the Sinai Peninsula, all included in the Roteiro do Mar Roxo. Unlike other viceroys, Castro was interested in Indian culture and religion. He collaborated with the humanist Andr√© de Resende to write a book on Indian art. His estate of Penha Verde, in Sintra, contains the two famous black stones of Cambay, retrieved by de Castro and his son.  Later life  Returning to Portugal, de Castro was named commander of a fleet in 1543 to clear Atlantic Europe of pirates. In 1545 he was sent to India with six ships to assist Martim Afonso de Sousa, who had been dismissed as the viceroy. Seconded by his sons (one of whom, Fern√£o, was killed) and by Jo√£o Mascarenhas, de Castro overthrew Mahmud, King of Gujarat, and defeated the army of the Adil Khan. He also captured Bharuch, subjugated Malacca, and traveled by Ant√≥nio Moniz's passage into Ceylon. In 1547, he was appointed to be viceroy by King John III of Portugal. After the victory of his Armada in the relief of Diu, he asked the king to not prolong his term of office beyond the ordinary three years and to allow him to return to the Sintra Mountains in Portugal. After his victory over Mahmud and the Adil Khan, de Castro rebuilt Diu with the money received from the citizens of Goa. He did not live long to fulfill this goal, and died in the arms of his friend, Saint Francis Xavier, on 6 June 1548. He was buried at Goa before his remains were exhumed and transported to Portugal to be reinterred in the convent of Benfica.  The terrestrial magnetism in the Roteiro from Lisbon to Goa: the experiences of Jo√£o de Castro  The ancient Greeks had discovered that a dark stone metal could attract or repel objects of iron. During the voyage, the navigators could not find a ship at sea by longitude because determining this required a clock on board to indicate the exact time at the reference median, and the astronomical determination of longitude gave unacceptable errors. On the trip to India, de Castro carried out a series of experiments that succeeded in detecting the phenomenon with the magnetic needle on board. When de Castro attempted to determine the latitude of Mozambique on 5 August 1538, he noted the deviation of the needle 128 years before Guillaume Dennis (1666) of Nieppe, who is normally credited with this discovery. He observed a magnetic phenomenon on 22 December 1538 near Ba√ßaim, which was confirmed four centuries later. De Castro refuted the theory that the variation of magnetic declination is not formed by geographic meridians.http://www.tgo.uit.no/articl/roadto.html De Castro's recorded values of magnetic declination in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans in the sixteenth century were useful for the study of terrestrial magnetism. He made 43 observations of magnetic declination through measurements of geomagnetic declination over the entire route around Africa. The instrument he used was the Bussola de Variac√£o, which was developed by Felipe Guillen a decade earlier in Seville. He discovered spatial variations of declination in the Bay of Bombay (near Ba√ßaim), which he attributed to the disturbing effects of underwater rock masses. In the 1890s, G. Hellman, quoted by Chapman and Bartels (1940), considered de Castro to be the most important representative of scientific maritime investigations of the time, and the method he tested was universally introduced on ships and used until the end of the sixteenth century.http://www.agu.org/sections/geomag/pubs/2006RG000198.pdf Notes References * *Jacinto Freire de Andrade Vida de D.

Life She was born in Nancy as the daughter of an actor, who took her to Spain. There she played in tragedy at the age of twelve. By 1770 she was back in France at Rouen, and her success as Euphmie in Belloy's Gaston et Bayard caused her to be called to the Com√©die Fran√ßaise. =Career at the Com√©die Fran√ßaise= In 1772, she made her debut at the Com√©die Fran√ßaise as Dido. She played all the classical tragedy parts to crowded houses, until the scandals of her private life and her extravagance ended her popularity. Mlle. Raucourt by Ad√®le Romany Her beauty and talent had made her famous, but her not so secret love affairs with other women made her notorious. She was known to have had numerous affairs with both men and women, preferring the latter. One on-again-off-again lover was opera soprano Sophie Arnould. Famous or not, in her time this could have a negative effect on a career, and a popular scandalous pamphlet claimed that she led a secret society of lesbians in Paris called the Sect of AnandrynesStage Actors and Actresses The Sexuality of History: Modernity and the Sapphic, 1565-1830, p. 201 Part of the ensuing three years she was in prison for debt, but some of the time she spent in the capitals of northern Europe, followed everywhere by scandal. Under protection of the queen she reappeared at the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais in 1779, and renewed her success in Paris, as Cleopatra, and all her former roles. =Later career= At the outbreak of the Revolution she was imprisoned for six months with other royalist members of the Com√©die Fran√ßaise, and she did not reappear upon that stage until the close of 1793, and then only for a short time. In prison she met her last partner, Henriette Simonnot-Ponty, with whom she lived until death. She deserted, with a dozen of the best actors in the company, to found a rival colony, but a summons from the Directory brought her back in 1797. Napoleon gave her a pension, and in 1806 she was commissioned to organize and direct a company that was to tour Italy, where, especially in Milan, she was enthusiastically received. She returned to Paris a few months before her death on 15 January 1815. Her funeral was the occasion of a riot. The clergy of her parish having refused to receive the body, the crowd broke in the church doors, and were only restrained from further violence by the arrival of an almoner sent posthaste by Louis XVIII. She is buried at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, in Paris.

A ‚ÄúMinami Ward‚Äù was one of the original wards, with the division of the city of Nagoya into wards on April 1, 1908; however, none of present-day Minami Ward was within the geographical extent of the original Minami Ward. On August 22, 1922, Minami Ward annexed the neighboring town of Yobitsuki and the village Kasadera from Aichi District. On October 1, 1937 the city of Nagoya was re-divided into ten wards, with the original Minami Ward divided into the new Minami Ward, plus Atsuta Ward, Nakagawa Ward, Minato Ward, and part of Showa Ward. In 1959, the Isewan Typhoon caused severe damage to the area. Economy Minami Ward was traditionally known for its production of sea salt and seaweed.

The film became one of the few low-budget westerns to be nominated for the Oscar for Best Writing, Story or Screenplay. Since its release, the film has become one of the classics of the genre.  Plot  Bounty hunter Morgan Hickman (Henry Fonda) arrives in a small town with the body of an outlaw, seeking the bounty. While the general townsfolk openly abhor Hickman, young sheriff Ben Owens (Anthony Perkins) admires him for taking everything in his stride and knowing how to handle dangerous situations. Hickman tells Owens that he was once a sheriff himself, but Dr McCord, the town's doctor, doubts this. Nevertheless, Owens persuades Hickman to teach him the ways of a lawman, forcing Hickman to face his past and his lost virtues. Hickman lives on the edge of the town with Nona Mayfield, herself an outcast due to her half-Indian son, Kip. Treatment of Indians acts as a sub-plot including scenes such as the gunning down of an Indian by a white man, under the philosophy of nobody cares. Things come to a head when Dr McCord is returning home during the night having delivered a baby son to a remote homesteader. He is waylaid by Ed McGaffey (Lee Van Cleef) asking him to treat a gun wound on his brother. This he does, but then McGaffey decides to kill him as he knows too much, despite the pleas of his now recovering brother. Dr. McCord's horse and trap re-enter the town on McCord Day: where the whole town has come out to celebrate the doctor's 75th birthday. To a resounding chorus of \\"For He's A Jolly Good Fellow\\" the town realize he is dead. A posse is then assembled to catch McGaffey. However, the posse split from Sheriff Owens because they see him as too soft. Young Kip rides out after the posse and Hickman and Owens team up to track him down. In finding Kip they accidentally stumble upon McGaffey and his brother hiding in a mountain cave. After a gunfight in which Owens receives a bullet graze on the forehead they successfully capture the brothers and lock them in the town jail. However the posse is baying for blood and want to lynch the pair. The posse gets drunk in the town bar, to find the courage to do the deed, urged on by the ringleader, Bogardus. Owens stands against the crowd with a shotgun to defend the brothers for a legal trial. Bogardus (who earlier shot the Indian) has a standoff with Sheriff Owens. Owens approaches Bogardus alone, with the mob separating for a gunfight. The newly deputized Hickman holds the shotgun near the jail. Bogardus hesitates as Owens approaches. He appears to back down after Owens slaps him, but turns around and draws after going a few steps. Owens guns him down. At this point the lynch mob disperses. Hickman then happily leaves town (with Nona and Kip Mayfield).  In popular culture  During the opening credits of the early seasons of the 1970s sitcom Happy Days, a poster for The Tin Star is seen at a movie theater. (This would seem to be a continuity error, as an early episode of the show is set around the 1956 United States presidential election, and the film wasn't released until 1957. However, Happy Days was mostly set in the generic \\"Fifties\\" rather than in any particular year.)

He is best known for discovering the Step Pyramid of Sekhemkhet. Before World War II, Goneim worked at Saqqara on the mortuary temple of Unas. He spent the war in Luxor and then returned to Saqqara to work on the Step Pyramid of Sekhemkhet in close association with Lauer who was working on the Step Pyramid of Djoser. He thought he had found an intact burial, as the seals of the alabaster sarcophagus were undamaged, and funerary wreaths lay atop the sarcophagus. There was tremendous media attention, and he invited high state officials, journalists, reporters and film teams to the opening. But on opening the sarcophagus, it proved to be empty. \\"They dig for three years and find nothing,\\" one newspaper reported. There was consequent popular disappointment, although the discovery was still an important one for Egyptology. The Egyptian President Nasser visited the site, and commended Goneim for his work. After this he went on a lecture tour of the USA. He also wrote a book, The buried pyramid, with the aid of Leonard Cottrell, in order to publicise the work further. The book was a success, and was translated into several languages. But he was already in trouble at home, where official harassment had begun. He was eventually falsely accused of smuggling a large, valuable vessel that Quibell and Lauer had found two years earlier near in the Djoser complex out of the country. There was no hard evidence, only accusations and slander. But it devastated Goneim, who was Egyptian himself. He was repeatedly interrogated by the police. His friend Jean-Philippe Lauer attempted to help him by searching for the missing item. In 1959, he tracked the missing vessel to a corner of the Egyptian Museum's depository. But it was too late. The perpetual harassment was too much, and he was either murdered or drowned himself in the Nile on 12 January 1959. Zakaria Goneim was the cousin of the Egyptian Heiress Nofert Sourial Sa'id. Zakaria Goneim's father's family became Muslim in the late 19th century. They were of Coptic descent.  Publications  * The buried pyramid. Longmans, Green; London, New York; 1956 * The lost pyramid.

His father, Heinrich Nikolaus Gerber (1702‚Äì1775), a pupil of J. S. Bach, was an organist and composer of some distinction, and under his direction Ernst Ludwig at an early age had made great progress in his musical studies. In 1765 he went to Leipzig to study law, but the claims of music, which had gained additional strength from his acquaintanceship with Johann Adam Hiller, soon came to occupy almost his sole attention. On his return to Sondershausen he was appointed music teacher to the children of the prince, and in 1775 he succeeded his father as court organist. Afterwards he devoted much of his time to the study of the literature and history of music, and with this view he made himself master of several modern languages. His Historisch-biographisches Lexikon der Tonk√ºnstler appeared in 1790 and 1792 in two volumes; and the first volume of what was virtually an improved and corrected edition of this work was published in 1810 under the title Neues Historisch-biographisches Lexikon der Tonk√ºnstler, followed by three further volumes in 1812, 1813 and 1814.

The proposal was part of the intensive negotiations among five great powers over the future of Belgium after the success of the Belgian revolution for independence. Background Despite increasing popular demands for independence, major European powers were divided over the future of Belgium; France was in favor of the secession of Wallonia, the territory inhabited by speakers of langues d'oil dialects, largely in hope of annexing those territories. Other European nations opposed the French demand, supporting the continued union of the Netherlands, which had been decided at the Congress of Vienna. A popular uprising spread like wildfire and ended Dutch rule in the Southern Netherlands, upsetting arrangements made at the Congress of Vienna. While Belgians formed provisional government in Brussels, major European powers were forced to consider alternative plans to contain the Belgicists and preserve its union with the Netherlands. Since Napoleonic times, Britain had been anxious that Antwerp (\\"a pistol pointing at the heart of London\\") should not be in the hands of a belligerent France.Napoleon Bonaparte recognised the strategic value of Antwerp, and had ordered the building of the Napoleon Dock to house the French fleet. Plan In lieu of the stalemate, Talleyrand proposed partitioning the Southern Netherlands: *The province of Antwerp ‚Äî except the city of Antwerp itself ‚Äî and Limburg, west of the Meuse river ‚Äî except Maastricht ‚Äî would remain in the Netherlands, as would a small part of the province of Brabant, the former Oranje Lordship of Diest; *The parts of the provinces of Li√®ge, of Limburg and of Namur east of the Meuse river as well as the cities of Maastricht, Namur and Li√®ge and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg would go to Prussia; *Part of the province of East Flanders, nearly all of the province of Brabant, the province of Hainaut and the province of Namur west of the Meuse would be assigned to France; *West Flanders, most of East Flanders, including Zeelandic Flanders (which was not generally considered to be part of the Southern Netherlands as it had been under northern Dutch rule for centuries), and the city of Antwerp were to form the Free State of Antwerp, under British protection. It would have been more or less a restored County of Flanders at the river Scheldt. Consequences The Talleyrand plan was rejected by European powers, who ultimately approved a unified Belgian state. However, the Talleyrand plan was one of several ideas exploring the concept of partitioning Belgium, which is considered by some as simply a \\"buffer state\\" between France and other European nations. Modern proposals include the specific separation of the areas inhabited mainly by French-speakers (Walloons) from those inhabited mainly by (Flemish) Dutch- speakers; but one difficulty in this proposal is that mainly francophone Brussels lies within Flanders, not Wallonia. One should also note that there is currently no majority within the Belgian population for such a project and that the proportion of separatists in the country remains stable throughout the years.https://www.lesoir.be/271516/article/2020-01-08/seuls-16-des- electeurs-flamands-veulent-la-scission-du- payshttps://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf09112007_060.

Bazaruto (, from Ushurutswa, island of the mist) is a sandy island located approximately southeast of the mouth of the Save River, Mozambique (). It is the largest island in the Bazaruto Archipelago and in the Bazaruto National Park. The warm, southward-flowing Mozambique Current seems to contribute to the increasing buildup of the sandy coastline. Because the water along this coastal area is very clear, much of the sub-surface channel pattern around the island is discernible. Several narrow lines of plankton bloom parallel the shoreline on the satellite photo below. Bazaruto Archipelago holds the largest population of dugong in Mozambique (around 300 animals) and almost certainly is the last remaining viable population of dugongs left off East Africa. The coastal plains show numerous lakes and a swampy environment that appears to be karst topography. Underlying the area is limestone rock that has eroded into a pockmarked landscape, creating water-filled sinkholes. Rainfall in this humid tropical climate amounts to around 850 mm (33 inches) annually, largely concentrated in the months December to March.http://www.worldclimate.com Information for Vilankulo The closest mainland town to the island of Bazaruto is Inhassoro, although administratively it belongs to the Vilankulo District and Inhambane Province.

Life Fran√ßois-Joseph-Victor Broussais was born in Saint- Malo. From his father, who was also a physician, he received his first instructions in medicine, and he studied for some years at a college in Dinan named after him, \\"Coll√®ge Fran√ßois Broussais\\". At the age of seventeen he entered one of the newly formed republican regiments, but ill-health compelled him to withdraw after two years. He resumed his medical studies, and then obtained an appointment as surgeon in the navy. In 1799 he proceeded to Paris, where he studied under physician, surgeon, and physiologist Xavier Bichat. Bichat's focus on the strong connection between physiology pathology can also be recognized in Broussais' medical theories. In 1803 he graduated as M.D. and in 1805 he again joined the army in a professional capacity, and served in Germany and the Netherlands. He returned to Paris, then left again for active service in Spain. In 1814 he returned to Paris, and was appointed assistant- professor to the military hospital of the Val-de-Grace, where he first promulgated his views on the relation between life and stimulus, and on the physiological interdependence and sympathies of the various organs. His lectures were attended by great numbers of students, keen on his new theories. By degrees his doctrines triumphed, and in 1831 he was appointed professor of general pathology in the academy of medicine. Towards the end of his life he attracted large audiences by lectures on phrenology. Works Three leeches acting as physicians attend a grasshopper patient and decide on bloodletting. Lithograph by Broussais after J. J. Grandville, c. 1832 In 1808 he published his Histoire des phlegmasies ou inflammations chroniques; and in Examen de la doctrine m√©dicale g√©n√©ralement adopte, which brought the opposition of the medical faculty of Paris; In 1828 he published a work De l'irritation et de la folie. When he became ill with indigestion, Broussais applied 50‚Äì60 leeches throughout his body approximately 15 times.  Theory of medicine  Disagreeing with many of his predecessors, such as Laennec, Bayle, and Louis, Broussais believed in the importance of physiology. He believed that diseases occurred when normal functions failed or were modified. Broussais' theory, known as medical physiology, argued that some diseases are just a result of irritation due to excitation or stimulation. This medical physiology became the most popular form of medical theory in Paris in the 19th century. It is believed that irritation then caused inflammation, which primarily occurred at the gastrointestinal tract in most diseases. Then, this irritation would pass to other organs \\"sympathetically\\". This led Broussais to believe that mild blood-letting could heal every illness. Broussais passionately advocated the use of leeches in bloodletting procedures, due to the belief that it was more gentle. With one particular patient, he prescribed around ninety leeches be placed over the body for this purpose. Additionally, Broussais believed that the ill were sthenic and needed to be prescribed sedatives.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Brown & Sharpe was one of the best-known and most influential machine tool builders and was a leading manufacturer of instruments for machinists (such as micrometers and indicators). Its reputation and influence were such that its name is often considered to be inseparably paired with certain industrial standards that it helped establish, including: * The American wire gauge (AWG) standards for wire; * The Brown & Sharpe taper in machine tool spindle tapers; and * The Brown & Sharpe worm threadform for worm gears. Since being acquired by Hexagon Metrology in 2001, Brown and Sharpe has concentrated exclusively on metrology equipment.  History  = Founding (1833) and early years = Joseph R. Brown, 1886 engraving. Browns & Sharpe Shops, Providence RI, 1896Arnold, Horace L. \\"Modern Machine-Shop Economics. Part II\\" in Engineering Magazine 11. 1896 Brown & Sharpe was founded in 1833 on South Main Street in Providence, Rhode Island by David Brown and his son Joseph R. Brown. The elder Brown retired in 1841, and the younger Brown formed a partnership with Lucian Sharpe in 1853, giving the company its name. The early years were full of innovations and inventions, including the first automatic machine for graduating rules (1850) and the precision Gear Cutting and Dividing Engine (1855). The company was incorporated in 1868. In 1866 Samuel Darling joined the partnership and the firm changed its name to Darling, Brown and Sharpe until Darling's interest was bought out in 1892. =Growth and expansion= In 1872, the company moved from Main Street to a 33-acre parcel along the Woonasquatucket River in the Smith Hill neighborhood of Providence. The first building was designed in 1872 by Brown & Sharpe employee Thomas McFarlane. It was a huge 66,000 square-foot structure made of brick, cast iron, and concrete, and held space for all the company's functions. Over the years, more buildings were built, including a carpenter shop, powerhouse, machine shops, warehouses, grinding shop, and steel storage bins. By the early 1900s, Brown & Sharpe was the world's largest manufacturer of machine tools, operating out of the sprawling Brown and Sharpe Manufacturing Company Complex. Brown & Sharpe was instrumental in the development of machine tools and machining technology (including toolmaking, metrology, production, etc.). It was responsible for the improvement and wider dissemination of milling machines, micrometers, turret lathes, screw machines, and other tools. A thorough account of the details is given in a seminal classic of machine tool history, Joseph W. Roe's English and American Tool Builders (1916).. = World War I through World War II = Employees leaving Brown and Sharpe Manufacturing Company, December 1940. Photo by Jack Delano. Like most machine tool builders, Brown & Sharpe rode a business cycle rollercoaster during these decades. After being kept very busy during World War I, builders suffered a slump in the post‚ÄìWorld War I recession and depression of 1920‚Äì21. The Roaring Twenties brought renewed sales, but then the Great Depression slashed them. The armament-buildup period of 1936 to 1940 again renewed machine tool activity, and then the World War II materiel effort exploded demand, pushing it to record heights. Brown and Sharpe machine tools were a mainstay of American metal manufacturing until the late 20th Century and could be found in most machine shops and factories which worked with metal. Additionally, Brown and Sharpe made calipers and micrometers which were essential to products built to fine tolerances. = Post-World War II era = Shortly after World War II, Henry D. Sharpe, Jr. succeeded his father as president of Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company. He led its development as a modern company designed to last. The firm stopped producing its old stalwarts: sewing machines, hair clippers, and certain categories of machine tools (including its line of milling machines). Instead the company refocused on the mass production of automatic screw machines as it completed a three-year, $4 million refitting program for its Providence plant in 1957. In keeping with the latest management theories, Sharpe also reorganized the company into separate divisions, with each one responsible for its own profit and loss. During this era, Brown & Sharpe began to experiment with international expansion, and the company established its first overseas subsidiary in Plymouth, England, in 1955. Between 1957 and 1961 the company further expanded through the acquisition of related manufacturers, most notably the machine- producing Double A Products Company. In the aftermath of these changes and expansion, the company outgrew its central plant just west of downtown Providence. In 1964, Brown & Sharpe followed other Providence-based manufacturers out of the city, moving instead to suburban North Kingstown, Rhode Island. Such relocations were aided by the federal subsidies for highway construction and the rapid expansion in automobile ownership in the postwar era; Providence's suburbs developed throughout the 1950s. As the company's workers had become more mobile and the majority had moved to suburban areas, Brown & Sharpe decided to build a new facility on land cheaper than downtown. The new plant, dubbed Precision Park as a nod to Brown & Sharpe's history of pioneering manufacture of precise measurement tools, contained of easily adaptable floor space. Unlike the old Providence facility, Precision Park was built as one story. This enabled the efficient horizontal movement of materials preferred in modern manufacturing, an improvement over the vertical circulation system of its former multi-storey plant. While the company never again reached its wartime peak employment of 11,000, it still employed 3,394 workers in 1976. Company management had a policy of working to smooth production across the recessions of the 1970s and keep employment steady. During this time, President Sharpe and his successor Don Roach sympathized with the workers, who were concerned about job security at a time of reduction in industrial jobs and the cyclical nature of machine-tool manufacturing. Despite these policies, Brown & Sharpe management made other demands of its workers and union leaders. In 1981, President Don Roach insisted that the company be able to shift machinists between jobs as needed, but many workers worried that they would lose traditional seniority privileges. In response, 1,600 union workers, members of the International Association of Machinists District Lodge 64, walked out on their jobs in what would become the longest- lasting strike in the nation's history. It was also characterized as one of the most antagonistic in recent memory. The strike's hostility transcended the debate over the company's labor policy. It prompted questions among management about the future of the Rhode Island work force. On March 22, 1982, some 800 picketers clashed with members of the state and local police forces, who used tear gas to control the strikers. Governor J. Joseph Garrahy publicly apologized for the actions of the police, which appeared unduly severe to many Rhode Island citizens. Although the strike legally continued after the tear- gas incident, the picket line largely disbanded. Many workers decided to move to other companies or work. In 1998, nearly seventeen years after the strike began, the Rhode Island Supreme Court ruled on an appeal in the legal battle, saying that Brown & Sharpe had not illegally forced the strike. By this point, both Brown & Sharpe and its erstwhile work force were retreating from manufacturing in Rhode Island. During the long legal proceedings, Brown & Sharpe continued to change as a manufacturer and as an employer. During the 1980s and 1990s, the company concentrated on developing coordinate-measuring machines (CMMs), devices for dimensional measuring, as a more modern and larger progression to their established micrometers. The company began to lose money as it shifted production away from machine tools and toward advanced metrology equipment, losing $14.6 million in 1990. By 1993, employment in North Kingstown had fallen to 700, compared with 2,000 in 1982 and more than 3,500 in 1976. In 1994 Brown & Sharpe acquired DEA of Italy, an established manufacturer of CMMs. In 2001, substantially all of the assets of the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company, including the intellectual property, designs, trademarks, facilities and inventory, were acquired by Hexagon AB, although it did not acquire the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company. The Brown & Sharpe brand of measurement products is manufactured by the Hexagon Metrology division of Hexagon AB, which retained many of the key individuals from the former Brown & Sharpe company. Since the acquisition, Brown & Sharpe-brand hand tools have been manufactured by Hexagon Metrology's TESA division in Switzerland.

Plot Within a small town in Tennessee, seed and sod entrepreneur Daltry Calhoun is a local celebrity who has made a name for himself by selling locally produced turf to many of the nation's most exclusive golf courses, and his television spots are well-liked by viewers across town. Daltry's ex-girlfriend arrives unannounced with their teenage daughter, a 14-year-old musical prodigy. She confides that her terminal illness has forced her to seek him out in hopes that he can care for their daughter after she is gone. Despite the early success of Daltry's business and the popularity of his commercials, Daltry's career has become unstable and he's forced to liquidate his assets in hopes of salvaging what he can. Now, faced with much adversity, Daltry vows to make up for lost time by doing right in the eyes of his family and community, caring for his distant daughter, and all the while getting his business back on track. *Tagline: Proudly spreading his seeds across America. Film location Though the film was shot in Maury County, Tennessee, the film's setting is Ducktown, Tennessee, a small town located in the Appalachian Mountains of southeastern Tennessee along the border of North Carolina. It has been argued however, that the setting was actually intended to be a small community called Duck River, Tennessee located just outside of Maury County just across the county line of adjacent Hickman County, Tennessee. The Duck River at 284 miles long, is the longest river contained entirely in the state of Tennessee and winds through many counties including Maury and Hickman. It has been suggested that rather than name an actual town, the film‚Äôs makers chose a variation on the name, not realizing the new name was an actual town located in the same state. Reception and box office Daltry Calhoun received mostly negative reviews from critics, ultimately receiving a 7% score from Rotten Tomatoes and a 30% score from Metacritic. While the film's budget was about $3 million, upon release, it had run in a total of only 13 theaters worldwide. It made a total of $7,758 in sales during its opening weekend and earned $12,551 in Total Lifetime Gross. This resulted in a loss of about $2.9 million.

The tunnel was opened on 13 December 1969, after decades of rejected ideas, delays and frustrated projects (including the idea of using a cable-stayed bridge). The governors of the two provinces, Ra√∫l Uranga and Carlos Sylvestre Begnis, signed a joint treaty authorizing the construction in 1960; the first stone was set in 1962, and the first tubes were built in 1966. Construction was undertaken by a consortium headed by the German firm Hochtief AG. In 2004, traffic statistics on the tunnel counted 2,780,133 vehicles, of which almost 2.2 million were cars or motorcycles, and the rest were trucks (most of them 8- or 10-wheelers). The tunnel is controlled by a board with representatives of both provinces, formally called Ente Interprovincial Ra√∫l Uranga - Carlos Sylvestre Begnis. Until the opening of the Rosario-Victoria Bridge, this was the only road link between two commercially important and populous regions of Argentina, and the only one between the two provinces (more to the south, Entre R√≠os is connected to the province of Buenos Aires by the Z√°rate-Brazo Largo Bridge). Its original name was in tribute to Hernando Arias de Saavedra (commonly referred to as Hernandarias), the first governor in South America descended from Europeans and born in the Americas. In 2001 the name was changed to honour the former governors of the two provinces who had initiated the project. Technical information The tunnel is made of immersed tubes, each measuring 65.45 m and weighing 4,500 tonnes, with 50-cm- wide walls and an outer diameter of 10.8 m. The tube sections measure a total of 2,397 m, and at both ends there are access ramps, 270 m long. The road that goes inside the tunnel is 7.5 m wide, and the height from the road floor to the ceiling is 4.41 m. At its deepest point the tunnel is about 32 m under the average water level of the river.

Both the F70 and F100 were preceded by the first jet airliner manufactured by Fokker, the Fokker F28 Fellowship. Since its first flight in 1993, 47 aircraft, plus one prototype, have been manufactured and 23 are still in active service with airlines around the world. Design and development The Fokker company of the Netherlands started to develop the airliner in November 1992 with an aim to replace its aging Fokker F28 airliner, with a more modern and fuel efficient aircraft. The Fokker 70's first flight occurred on 4 April 1993, at the company's base at Woensdrecht in southern Netherlands, and had a duration of three hours. Following its first flight, the Fokker 70 was flown to Granada and Spain, where many hours were logged in order to obtain the certification at the end of 1994. The first production aircraft first flew in July 1994. Certification was granted on 14 October 1994, while the first delivery of a Fokker 70 to a customer, Ford Motor Company (in an \\"Executive Jet\\" configuration), occurred later in the same month. Fokker 70 Specifications aer.ita.br. Retrieved: 29 January 2012. The launch customer of this aircraft by an airline, announced at the Paris Air Show in June 1993, was the now-defunct Indonesian airline, Sempati Airand Pelita Air. Sempati was the first airline to receive a Fokker 70 in March 1995. The first European airline to order the Fokker 70 was British Midland International in November 1993 with a long-term lease of five Fokker 70. The first US customer was Mesa Airlines who ordered two aircraft in December 1993. The development of the Fokker 70 was based on the requirements of some airlines, for which the Fokker 50 or ATR 42 were too small and the Boeing 737 or MD-80 too large. The development consisted in cutting various sections of the fuselage of the Fokker 100, removing of the plane's total length but keeping the wings and tail. With these specifications, total capacity is 80 passengers, 70 in the U.S., due more to meet \\"scope clause\\" requirements than any Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification. The Fokker 70 is powered by two Rolls- Royce Tay 620 turbofans placed at the back of the fuselage, with 61.6 kN (13,849 lb) of thrust. The weight varies from when empty to at maximum takeoff weight (MTOW). An airbrake on the 70's tail section ‚Äì similar to that found on the BAe 146 ‚Äì allows it to conform with the 5.5¬∞ glide slope at London City Airport. Its avionics suite is similar to the Fokker 100. Most Fokker 70 aircraft were delivered for service in Europe, but in 1995 two aircraft were delivered to Mesa Airlines subsidiary Desert Sun Airlines and were operated as America West Express flights as part of an effort to try to introduce the Fokker 70 to the United States; the purchase agreement allowed the operator to return the aircraft within 12 to 18 months. Although the earlier Fokker 100 did moderately well in the United States with orders from American Airlines and USAir (which subsequently merged with American Airlines), only two aircraft of the Fokker 70 variant were delivered for service in the United States. Fokker's March 1996 bankruptcy ended any hopes of further production for the U.S. market; the two America West Express aircraft operated by a subsidiary of Mesa Airlines became an expensive subfleet and were sent to Europe in 1997, ending the very short tenure of Fokker 70 operation in the United States. The last Fokker 70 was delivered in April 1997, when the production line closed following Fokker's bankruptcy the previous year. Over the 70's short production life, 47 were built. Although official production of the Fokker 70 is completed, Rekkof (\\"Fokker\\" spelt backwards) has, since 1999, tried to negotiate the re-opening of both the Fokker 100 and Fokker 70 lines.

Traditionally he is regarded as identical with Mark the Evangelist, the traditional writer of the Gospel of Mark. Biblical account 6th-century Syriac inscription at the Monastery of St. Mark on Zion, beginning, \\"This is the house of Mary, mother of John Mark.\\" Lion of St Mark outside Bishop's Palace -- Galveston, Texas Several times the Acts of the Apostles mentions a certain \\"John, who was also called Mark\\" or simply \\"John\\": From these passages it may be gathered that John's mother Mary had a large house in Jerusalem to which Peter fled after escaping prison; that John assisted Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary journey to Cyprus and as far as Perga in Pamphylia, but then returned to Jerusalem; and that later controversy over receiving John Mark back led to Paul and Barnabas parting ways, with Barnabas taking Mark back to Cyprus and both thereafter disappearing from the narrative of Acts. The reasons for John Mark's departure to Jerusalem and the subsequent disagreement between Paul and Barnabas have been subject to much speculation. Matthew Henry, for example, suggested that John Mark had departed \\"without [Barnabas and Paul's] knowledge, or without their consent\\".Matthew Henry's Commentary, Acts 15 http://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm accessed 16 September 2015 However, there is simply too little data to regard any explanation with confidence. Some scholars have argued that John Mark's negative portrayal in Acts is a polemic against the presumptive author of the Gospel of Mark, Luke's primary source for his own Gospel. Adela Collins suggests, \\"Since the author of Acts also wrote the Gospel according to Luke, it could be that this critical portrait was intended to undercut the authority of the second Gospel.\\"Collins, Adela. Mark: A Commentary. Fortress, 2007, p. 5. Michael Kok notes that \\"Mark's Gospel was a bit of an embarrassment to the refined literary and theological tastes of an educated Christian like Luke.\\"Kok, Michael. The Flawed Evangelist (John) Mark: A Neglected Clue to the Reception of Mark's Gospel in Luke-Acts?. Neotestamentica, 46(2), pp. 257. Identification It was common for Jews of the period to bear both a Semitic name such as John (Hebrew: Yochanon) and a Greco-Roman name such as Mark. But since John was one of the most common names among Palestinian Jews, and Mark was the most common in the Roman world, caution is warranted in identifying John Mark with any other John or Mark. Ancient sources in fact consistently distinguish John Mark from the other Marks of the New Testament and style him Bishop of Byblos.Pseudo-Hippolytus, On the Seventy Apostles, for example, disguishes \\"Mark the Evangelist, Bishop of Alexandria\\" from \\"Mark cousin of Barnabas, Bishop of Apollonia\\" and from \\"Mark, who is also John, Bishop of Bibloupolis\\". Nor was John Mark identified in antiquity with any other John, apart from rare and explicit speculation.Dionysius of Alexandria, apud Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 7.25.15, speculates in passing on what other Johns there were besides John the Evangelist who might have written Revelation. John Chrysostom, In Acta Ap., Hom. xxvi, seems to suggest that John Mark was the John who accompanied Peter in Acts. Medieval sources, on the other hand, increasingly regarded all New Testament references to Mark as Mark the Evangelist, and many modern scholars have agreed in seeing a single Mark. The very fact that various writings could refer simply to Mark without further qualification has been seen as pointing to a single Mark. First, there is Mark the cousin of Barnabas, mentioned by Paul as a \\"fellow worker\\" in the closings of three Pauline epistles.; Colossians 4:10; 2 Timothy 4:11. In antiquity he was regarded as a distinct Mark, Bishop of Apollonia. If, on the other hand, these two Marks are to be identified, the fact that these epistles were written after the departure of John Mark with Barnabas in Acts must suppose some later reconciliation. But a majority of scholars, noting the close association of both Marks with Paul and Barnabas, indeed regard them as likely the same person. Mark the Evangelist, however, is known only from the patristic tradition, which associates him only with Peter and makes no mention of Paul. Jerome alone suggests that the Mark of whom Paul speaks may be the Evangelist.Jerome, Comm. in Philem. 24. But modern scholars have noted that as Peter fled to the house of John Mark's mother, the two men may have had a longstanding association. A minority of modern scholars have argued, on the other hand, for identifying John the Evangelist and/or John the Elder with John Mark. Later sources The Acts of Barnabas, apparently an apocryphal work of the 5th century, purport to be written by John Mark and to detail the missionary journey and martyrdom of Barnabas in Cyprus, thus picking up where the account of Acts leaves off.Acts of Barnabas. The Encomium of the Apostle St. Barnabas, written by Alexander the Monk in the 6th century, also gives an extensive account of the activity of Barnabas and John Mark in Cyprus. After the death of Barnabas, John Mark leaves for Ephesus, and the account then continues by identifying him with Mark the Evangelist.

Students from numerous Sowetan schools began to protest in the streets of Soweto in response to the introduction of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in local schools. It is estimated that 20,000 students took part in the protests. They were met with fierce police brutality and many were shot and killed. The number of people killed in the uprising is usually given as 176, but estimates of up to 700 have been made.(Les Payne of Newsday said at least 850 murders were documented) Elsabe Brink; Gandhi Malungane; Steve Lebelo; Dumisani Ntshangase; Sue Krige, Soweto 16 June 1976, 2001, 9 In remembrance of these events, 16 June is now a public holiday in South Africa, named Youth Day. Causes of the protests Black South African high school students in Soweto protested against the Afrikaans Medium Decree of 1974, which forced all black schools to use Afrikaans and English in a 50‚Äì50 mix as languages of instruction. The Regional Director of Bantu Education (Northern Transvaal Region), J.G. Erasmus, told Circuit Inspectors and Principals of Schools that from 1 January 1975, Afrikaans had to be used for mathematics, arithmetic, and social studies from standard five (7th grade), according to the Afrikaans Medium Decree; English would be the medium of instruction for general science and practical subjects (homecraft, needlework, woodwork, metalwork, art, agricultural science). Indigenous languages would only be used for religious instruction, music, and physical culture. The association of Afrikaans with apartheid prompted black South Africans to prefer English. Even the Bantustan regimes chose English and an indigenous African language as official languages. In addition, English was gaining prominence as the language most often used in commerce and industry. The 1974 decree was intended to forcibly reverse the decline of Afrikaans among black Africans. The Afrikaner-dominated government used the clause of the 1909 Union of South Africa Act that recognised only English and Dutch (the latter being replaced by Afrikaans in 1925) as official languages as the pretext to do so. While all schools had to provide instruction in both Afrikaans and English as languages, white South African students learned other subjects in their home language. Punt Janson, the Deputy Minister of Bantu Education at the time, was quoted as saying: \\"A Black man may be trained to work on a farm or in a factory. He may work for an employer who is either English-speaking or Afrikaans-speaking and the man who has to give him instructions may be either English-speaking or Afrikaans-speaking. Why should we now start quarrelling about the medium of instruction among the Black people as well? ... No, I have not consulted them and I am not going to consult them. I have consulted the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa ‚Ä¶\\" The decree was resented deeply by the black populace. Desmond Tutu, bishop of Lesotho and later Dean of Johannesburg, stated that Afrikaans was \\"the language of the oppressor\\". Teacher organisations, such as the African Teachers Association of South Africa, objected to the decree.The Youth Struggle, A change in language of instruction forced the students to focus on understanding the language instead of the subject material. This made critical analysis of the content difficult and discouraged critical thinking. The resentment grew until 30 April 1976, when children at Orlando West Junior School in Soweto went on strike, refusing to go to school. Their rebellion then spread to many other schools in Soweto. Black South African students protested because they believed that they deserved to be treated and taught equally to white South Africans. A student from Morris Isaacson High School, Teboho \\"Tsietsi\\" Mashinini, proposed a meeting on 13 June 1976 to discuss what should be done. Students formed an Action Committee (later known as the Soweto Students' Representative Council), which organised a mass rally for 16 June, to make themselves heard. Uprising On the morning of 16 June 1976, between 10,000 and 20,000 black students walked from their schools to Orlando Stadium for a rally to protest against having to learn through Afrikaans in school. Many students who later participated in the protest arrived at school that morning without prior knowledge of the protest, yet agreed to become involved. The protest was planned by the Soweto Students' Representative Council's (SSRC) Action Committee, with support from the wider Black Consciousness Movement. Teachers in Soweto also supported the march after the Action Committee emphasised good discipline and peaceful action. Tsietsi Mashinini led students from Morris Isaacson High School to join up with others who walked from Naledi High School. The students began the march only to find out that police had barricaded the road along their intended route. The leader of the action committee asked the crowd not to provoke the police and the march continued on another route, eventually ending up near Orlando High School. The crowd of between 3,000 and 10,000 students made their way towards the area of the school. Students sang and waved placards with slogans such as, \\"Down with Afrikaans\\", \\"Viva Azania\\" and \\"If we must do Afrikaans, Vorster must do Zulu\\". The police set their trained dog on the protesters, who responded by killing it. The police then began to shoot directly at the children. Among the first students to be shot dead were 15-year-old Hastings Ndlovu and 13-year-old Hector Pieterson, who were shot at Orlando West High School. The photographer Sam Nzima took a photograph of a dying Hector Pieterson as he was carried away by Mbuyisa Makhubo and accompanied by his sister, Antoinette Sithole. The photograph became the symbol of the Soweto uprising. The police attacks on the demonstrators continued and 23 people died on the first day in Soweto. Among them was Dr. Melville Edelstein, who had devoted his life to social welfare among blacks. He was stoned to death by the mob and left with a sign around his neck proclaiming \\"Beware Afrikaans is the most dangerous drug for our future\\". The violence escalated, as bottle stores and beer halls‚Äîseen as outposts of the apartheid government‚Äîwere targeted, as were the official outposts of the state. The violence abated by nightfall. Police vans and armoured vehicles patrolled the streets throughout the night. Emergency clinics were swamped with injured and bloody children. The police requested that the hospital provide a list of all victims with bullet wounds to prosecute them for rioting. The hospital administrator passed this request to the doctors, but the doctors refused to create the list. Doctors recorded bullet wounds as abscesses. The 1,500 heavily armed police officers deployed to Soweto on 17 June carried weapons including automatic rifles, stun guns, and carbines. They drove around in armoured vehicles with helicopters monitoring the area from the sky. The South African Army was also ordered on standby as a tactical measure to show military force. Crowd control methods used by South African police at the time included mainly dispersement techniques. =Casualties= The number of people who died is usually given as 176 with estimates up to 700. The original government figure claimed only 23 students were killed; the number of wounded was estimated to be over a thousand people. At least one white person, Dr Melville Edelstein, was killed. Aftermath The aftermath of the uprising established the leading role of the ANC in the anti-apartheid struggle, as it was the body best able to channel and organise students seeking the end of apartheid. So, although the BCM's ideas had been important in creating the climate that gave the students the confidence to strike out, it was the ANC's non-racialism which came to dominate the discourse of the anti-apartheid movement amongst blacks. The perspectives set out in Joe Slovo's essay No Middle Road‚Äîwritten at just this time and predicting the apartheid government had only the choice between more repression and overthrow by the revolutionaries‚Äîwere highly influential. The clashes also occurred at a time when the South African Government was being forced to \\"transform\\" apartheid in international eyes towards a more \\"benign\\" form. In October 1976, Transkei, the first Bantustan, was proclaimed \\"independent\\" by the South African Government. This attempt to showcase supposed South African \\"commitment\\" to self-determination backfired, however, when Transkei was internationally derided as a puppet state. For the state the uprising marked the most fundamental challenge yet to apartheid and the economic (see below) and political instability it caused was heightened by the strengthening international boycott. It was a further 14 years before Nelson Mandela was released, but at no point was the state able to restore the relative peace and social stability of the early 1970s as black resistance grew. Many white South African citizens were outraged at the government's actions in Soweto. The day after the massacre, about 400 white students from the University of the Witwatersrand marched through Johannesburg's city centre in protest of the killing of children. Black workers went on strike as well and joined them as the campaign progressed. Riots also broke out in the black townships of other cities in South Africa. Student organisations directed the energy and anger of the youth toward political resistance. Students in Thembisa organised a successful and non-violent solidarity march, but a similar protest held in Kagiso led to police stopping a group of participants and forcing them to retreat, before killing at least five people while waiting for reinforcements. The violence only died down on 18 June. The University of Zululand's records and administration buildings were set ablaze, and 33 people died in incidents in Port Elizabeth in August. In Cape Town 92 people died between August and September. Most of the bloodshed had abated by the close of 1976, but by that time the death toll stood at more than 600. The continued clashes in Soweto caused economic instability. The South African rand devalued fast and the government was plunged into a crisis. The African National Congress printed and distributed leaflets with the slogan \\"Free Mandela, Hang Vorster\\", immediately linking the language issue to its revolutionary heritage and programme and helping establish its leading role (see Baruch Hirson's \\"Year of Fire, Year of Ash\\" for a discussion of the ANC's ability to channel and direct the popular anger). =International reaction= The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 392 which strongly condemned the incident and the apartheid government. A week after the uprising began, Henry Kissinger, the United States Secretary of State, met the South African State President, B. J. Vorster in West Germany to discuss the situation in Rhodesia, but the Soweto uprising did not feature in their discussions. Kissinger and Vorster met again in Pretoria in September 1976, with students in Soweto and elsewhere protesting his visit, and being fired on by police. African National Congress (ANC) exiles called for international action and more economic sanctions against South Africa. =1986 Massacre= On the night of Tuesday 26 August 1986, police opened fire on a demonstration in the White City locale, killing between 20 and 25 people, possibly more, and wounding over 60. The South African government officially claimed that 11 people had died, later raising the figure to 12. The South African Information Bureau claimed that police opened fire on two occasions, one after a grenade was tossed at police, wounding four police. Residents said the fighting started when local officials sought to evict tenants who had been refusing to pay their rents for two months as part of a mass boycott. Security forces were said to have initially used tear gas to disperse crowds. Later, a resident telephoned a reporter to say: The police are shooting left and right. They just shot an old man. They are shooting at everyone, everything. UDF leader Frank Chicane described the police actions \\"as if entering enemy territory, with guns blazing.\\" Minister of Information Louis Nel later came under fire for stating at a press conference that \\"Let there be no misunderstanding regarding the real issue at stake. It is not the rental issue, it is not the presence of security forces in Black residential areas, it is not certain remembrance days, it is not school programs. The violent overthrow of the South African state is the issue.\\" As retaliation, a Black Town Councilor was killed the following day, hacked to death by a mob. On September 4, police filled a stadium with tear gas to stop a mass funeral for a number of the victims, then swept through Soweto breaking up other services being held, including one at Regina Mundi Roman Catholic where tear gas canisters were thrown into a bus containing mourners. A service at Avalon Cemetery where thousands were reported to have gathered was also dispersed with tear gas and armored vehicles. Tear gas was also reported to have been dropped from helicopters on processions and crowds. In the media Images of the riots spread all over the world, shocking millions. The photograph of Hector Pieterson's dead body, as captured by photojournalist Sam Nzima, caused outrage and brought down international condemnation on the Apartheid government. The Soweto riots are depicted in the 1987 film by director Richard Attenborough, Cry Freedom, and in the 1992 musical film Sarafina! and the musical production of the same name by Mbongeni Ngema. The riots also inspired the novel A Dry White Season by Andre Brink, and a 1989 movie of the same title. The Soweto uprising also featured in the 2003 film Stander about notorious bank robber and former police captain, Andre Stander. The lyrics of the song \\"Soweto Blues\\" by Hugh Masekela and Miriam Makeba describe the Soweto Uprising and the children's part in it. =Radio= 20 years after the uprising, in June 1996, the Ulwazi Educational Radio Project of Johannesburg compiled an hour-long radio documentary portraying the events of 16 June entirely from the perspective of people living in Soweto at the time.The producers of this documentary included Keketso Semoko, Jeffrey Molawa, Moferefere Lekorotsoana and Andrew Ntsele of Ulwazi, working together with Peter Griffiths of BBC Radio 4. Many of the students who planned or joined the uprising took part, as did other witnesses, including photographer Peter Magubane, reporter Sophie Tema, and Tim Wilson, the white doctor who pronounced Hector Pieterson dead in Baragwanath hospital. The programme was broadcast on SABC and on a number of local radio stations throughout South Africa. The following year, BBC Radio 4 and BBC World Service broadcast a revised version containing fresh interviews and entitled The Day Apartheid Died.Extra material collected by Peter Griffiths and Andrew Ntsele of the Ulwazi Educational Radio Project The programme was runner-up at the 1998 European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) TV & Radio Awards and also at the 1998 Media Awards of the One World International Broadcasting Trust, and was highly commended at the 1998 Prix Italia radio awards. In May 1999, it was re-broadcast by BBC Radio 4 as The Death of Apartheid with a fresh introduction, providing added historical context for a British audience, by Anthony Sampson, former editor of Drum magazine and author of the authorised biography (1999) of Nelson Mandela. Sampson linked extracts from the BBC Sound Archive that charted the long struggle against apartheid from the Sharpeville massacre of 1960, through the riots of 1976 and the murder of Steve Biko, and right up to Mandela's release from prison in 1990 and the future president's speech in which he acknowledged the debt owed by all black South Africans to the students who gave their lives in Soweto on 16 June 1976.All details from Peter Griffiths of BBC Radio 4 in London See also *Hastings Ndlovu *History of South Africa *Liberation before education *International Day of the African Child References Further reading * Baines, Gary. \\"The Master Narrative of South Africa's Liberation Struggle: Remembering and Forgetting 16 June 1976, International Journal of African Historical Studies (2007) 40#2 pp. 283‚Äì302 in JSTOR * Brewer, John D.

Comprising two indoor/outdoor complexes and a range of standalone stores and facilities, the Centre is anchored by Coles and Aldi stores. Other notable facilities are the Jamison branch of the Canberra Southern Cross Club and the Big Splash Water Park. Jamison Centre is serviced by ACTION bus route 32 which connects Jamison Centre to Belconnen Town Centre and Civic.Route 32 Transport Canberra It is also easily accessible by road from Belconnen Way and Bindubi Street. The outdoor Belconnen Trash'n'Treasure Market is held every Sunday morning in the Jamison Centre car park. This is one of Canberra's larger outdoor markets, and is operated by the Rotary Club of Belconnen with assistance from the Rotary Clubs of Ginninderra, Hall and Woden. History Built in 1969, Jamison Centre was the first shopping development in the Belconnen district, preceding the Belconnen Town Centre by nearly a decade. It was named after Thomas Jamison (1752/53‚Äì1811), a First Fleet surgeon and prominent landowner, government official and mercantile trader of the colonial era. Initially, the Jamison Centre was a major commercial area, but it soon began to suffer from the growth of a centrally situated town hub, particularly when the federal government built a major shopping precinct which was later sold to The Westfield Group and is now known as Westfield Belconnen. For many years the Jamison Centre played a significant role in servicing the adjacent area, but decreased in importance and became increasingly neglected. The decline continued until 2000, when the Humphries government and the private owners of the centre commissioned a master plan to turn the area around. After community consultation, several major issues such as building elevation, access, safety and a lack of meeting places, were noted. The final plan, released in 2002, mapped out a number of methods of achieving this, including improving traffic flow and building new shops and restaurants facing the adjacent streets. With the approval of $8.2m of government funding, a major refurbishment began in January 2006, with most major work completed by early 2008. Though the government provided assurances that the centre would remain open throughout the process, much of the complex was vacant for some time with many long-term retailers moving temporarily to nearby locations.

It consists of poems, short stories, novels, plays, and song lyrics, among others. While there is some indication that Telugu literature dates at least to the middle of the first millennium, the first extant works are from the 11th century when the Mahabharata was first translated to Telugu from Sanskrit by Nannaya. The language experienced a golden age under the patronage of the Vijayanagara king-poet Krishnadevaraya.  Sources  There are various sources available for information on early Telugu writers. Among these are the prologues to their poems, which followed the Sanskrit model by customarily giving a brief description of the writer, a history of the king to whom the book is dedicated, and a chronological list of the books he published. In addition, historical information is available from inscriptions that can be correlated with the poems; there are several grammars, treatises, and anthologies that provide illustrative stanzas; and there is also information available from the lives of the poets and the traditions that they followed.  Subject matter  Early Telugu literature is predominantly religious in subject matter. Poets and scholars drew most of their material from, and spent most of their time translating epics, such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata and the Puranas, all of which are considered to be storehouses of Indian culture. From the sixteenth century onwards, rarely known episodes from the Puranas would form the basis for the tradition of Telugu-language kavya. Literary works are drawn from episodes of the Puranas under the name Akhyana or Khanda became popular along with depictions of the fortune of a single hero under the title of Charitra, Vijaya, Vilasa and Abhyudaya. Such titles are examples of what would become the most common subject matter of poetry. In the eighteenth-century, marriages of heroes under the title Parinaya, Kalyana and VivƒÅha became popular. Religious literature consisted of biographies of the founders of religion, their teachings (Sara) as well as commentaries (bhashya). Traditional Hindu knowledge systems such as astrology, law, grammar, ballets, moral aphorisms, and devotional psalms to deities within the Hindu pantheon are characteristics of more popular works of Telugu literature.  Forms  The various forms of literature found in Telugu are: * Prabandham: Stories in verse form with a tight metrical structure and they have three forms mentioned below.  PrakhyƒÅtam: Famous story.  Utpadyam: Purely fictional story.  Misramam: Mixed story. * Champu: Mixture of prose and poetry. * KƒÅvyam: Poem which usually begins with a short prayer called a Prarthana, containing initial auspicious letter \\"Sri\\" which invokes the blessings of the God. The occasion and circumstances under which the work is undertaken is next stated.  Padya kƒÅvyam: Metrical poetry.  Gadya kƒÅvyam: Prose poetry.  Khanda kƒÅvyam: Short poems * Kavita: Poetry * ≈öatakam (anthology): Satakam is a literary piece of art. The name derives from ≈öata, which means a hundred in Sanskrit. Satakam comprises a hundred poems. Hence, a Satakam is a volume (book) of hundred poems. Satakams are usually devotional, philosophical or convey morals. * Da≈öaka (anthology): Dasakam or Dashakam comprises ten poems. * AvadhƒÅnam: Avadhanam involves the partial improvisation of poems using specific themes, metres, forms, or words.Amaresh Datta, The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature, v. 1, \\"Avadhanam\\" (Sahitya Akademi, 2006; ) * Navala: Navala is a written, fictional, prose narrative normally longer than a short story. * Katha : Style of religious storytelling. * NƒÅtakam: Drama. * Naneelu:Epigrams. Ashtadiggajas have written in all three of the Prabandham genres during the Prabandha yugam. Telugu literature uses a unique expression in verse called Champu, which mixes prose and poetry. Although it is the dominant literary form, there are exceptions: for example, Tikkana composed Uttara Ramayana entirely in verse. As Champu Kavyas and Prabandhas were beyond the comprehension of masses, new devices for the dissemination of knowledge among the people were developed in the form of the Dvipada and Sataka styles. Dvipada means two feet (couplet) and Sataka means hundred (a cento of verses). (Popular satakas: Sarveshvara sataka, Kalahastishvara sataka, Dasarathi Sataka) There are some Satakas which are divided into ten groups of ten verses called Dasaka which is adopted from Prakrit. Avadhanam is a literary performance popular from the very ancient days in Sanskrit and more so in Telugu and Kannada languages. It requires a good memory and tests a person's capability of performing multiple tasks simultaneously. All the tasks are memory intensive and demand an in-depth knowledge of literature, and prosody. The number of Prucchakas can be 8 (Ashtavadhanam) or 100 (Sataavadhaanam) or even 1000 (Sahasravadhanam). A person who has successfully performed Ashtavadhanam is called as Ashtavadhani, a Satavadhanam is called a Satavadhani and Sahasraavadhaanam is called Sahasravadhani. = Dwipada = A dwipada is a couplet with a specific rhyme scheme. A stanza contains two short lines, each with less than fifteen characters. Longer poems, composed of many dwipada, can be composed with a \\"highly musical\\" effect. Much of the extant corpus in this form was written using the common language of the time. The form's musicality and accessibility made the form a natural fit for spreading religious messages. Palkurki Somanatha was the first to write in this form in the 12th or 13th century. His works Basava Puranam and Panditaradhya Charitra were \\"immensely singable\\" devotional works to Shiva as Basaveshwara. Influenced by Shaivaite poets' use of dwipada, a Vaishnavite poet wrote the Ranganadha Ramayana, a version of the Ramayana that became incredibly popular for its singability, vernacular diction, and stories not found in Valmiki's version. The form reached its apex with Palnati Vira Charitra, popularly ascribed to the 14th century poet Srinatha. By the end of the Prabandha era, the three most important Sanskrit poems had been translated into Telugu in dwipada: the Mahabharata by Thimmaya, the Ramayana by Ranganadha, and the Bhagavatam by Tekumalla Ranga Sai. The form declined after the dwipada works of the early 17th century king-poet Raghunatha Nayak of Tanjore. Dwipada's accessibility has sometimes meant it was not a prestigious form of Telugu poetry. In the 19th century, scholar Charles Philip Brown noted \\"the learned despise couplets because the poems thus written are in a flowing easy style which uneducated persons read with enjoyment.\\" Only a few writers today use it out of lingering respect its history. = Padam = Padams are lyric poems usually meant to be sung, with an opening line or lines called a pallavi, followed by three caranam verses, each of which is followed by the pallavi refrain. The padam is thus \\"a highly integrated, internally resonant syntactic and thematic unit.\\" Annamacharya, the most famous composer of Telugu padams, is said to have composed a padam a day for the god of the Tirupati temple, Venkateshwara. His poems, of which 13,000 survive on copper plates stored in the temple vaults, deal with the \\"infinite varieties and nuances of the god‚Äôs love life\\" and \\"his sense of himself as an agonized, turbulent human being in relation to the god he worships\\". = Chatu = Chatus (meaning \\"charming utterance\\") are remembered poems passed on by recitation. In premodern South India, literate people recited _chatus_ to each other as a social pastime. Most of these poems have memorable stories that go along with them that explain and contextualize them. They have passed through a lively oral tradition for hundreds of years, and been anthologized since the 19th century by scholars like Veturi Prabhakara Sastri. Many chatus are attributed to Srinatha, Tenali Ramalingadu, and other famous poets. These attributions, most of which are unverifiable, serve to make both mythologize these poets and judge their relative merit. Once made legends, they're free to interact anachronistically in chatus. Poets from different eras meet, exchange poems, and critique each other. In sum, chatus, \\"moving from gnomic advice to metalinguistic criticism, through the domains of desire, social commentary, the articulation of cultural values, and critical taste, these interlocking stanzas embody an entire education, an expressive vision of life and poetry.\\" = Shatakamu = A shatakamu literally means \\"an anthology of a hundred poems\\", but the number is usually somewhat higher, often an auspicious number like 108. The anthology is meant to be taken together. A list of notable such anthologies: * Vemana Satakam * Sumathi Satakam * Sri Kalahastiswara Satakam * Dasarathi Satakam * Bhaskara Satakam * Kumara Satakam * Narasimha Satakam * Sarveswara Satakam * Kumara Satakam * Kumari Satakam * Andhra Nayaka Satakam * Sri Kishna Satakam * Bharthruhari Neethi Satakam * Bharthruhari Vyragya Satakam * Bharthruhari Srungara Satakam * Daksharama Bhimeswara Sathakam  Poetics  The Praudha Prabandha or Maha Kavya is considered as highest form of verse. The essentials of such a composition according to the Telugu poetic theory are * ≈öaili (style): The words chosen neither soft nor very musical but dignified (gambhira), sweetness (madhurya), grace and delicacy (sukumara), fragrance (saurabhya) and symphony. Vulgar language (gramya) is avoided. * ·πîƒÅka (mould): Refers to the embodiment of ideas in language, and the nature and texture of the language employed. There are three types of pƒÅkas: :*DrƒÅksha (wine or grape): Draksha is a crystal clear style where everything is seen through a transparent medium. Mostly Nannayya uses this mould. :*Kadali (plantain): Kadali is complex pƒÅka because the soft skin has to peeled to reach the core of the subject. Mostly Tikkana uses this mould. :*Narikela (coconut): Narikela is the most difficult mould to employ because one has to break the rind to understand the idea. Vishnu Chittiyam or Krishnadevaraya are cast in this pƒÅka. * Rasa (aesthetic flavor): Rasa is the heart and soul of Telugu poetry. An aphorism (sutram), \\"VƒÅkyam RasƒÅtmakam KƒÅvyam\\", means that the soul of a sentence is rasa. There are nine rasas, known as the nava rasas. A perfect kavyam uses all nine of these, namely: :*≈ö·πõ·πÖgƒÅra (love) :*HƒÅsya (comic) :*Karu·πáƒÅ (sympathy) :*Raudram (horror) :*BhayƒÅnaka (fear) :*Bƒ´bhatsa (disgust) :*Vƒ´ra (heroic) :*Adbhuta (wonder) :*Shantam (peace) * AlankƒÅra (ornamentation): There are ≈õabdhalankƒÅras (ornaments of sound) and arthalankƒÅras (ornaments of thoughts). Slesha (double entendre) and yamaka (alliteration) are ≈õabdhalankƒÅras. UpamƒÅna (simile) and utpreksha (hyperbole) are arthalankƒÅras. AlankƒÅras are used in description of events, places and proceedings.  History  = Early writers =  The Pre-Nannayya Period (before 1020 AD)  In the earliest period, Telugu literature existed in the form of inscriptions, precisely from 575 AD on- wards. The 6th or 7th century Sanskrit text Janashrayi-Chhandovichiti (or JanƒÅ≈õraya-chandas) deals with the metres used in Telugu, including some metres that are not found in Sanskrit prosody. This indicates that Telugu poetry existed during or around the 6th century. . Malliya Rechana (940 CE) Malliya Rechana composed the first Telugu poetic prosody book Kavijanasrayam (pre-Nannayya chandassu) around 940 AD. This was a popular one and referred by many poets. There seems to be even an earlier prosody book by Rechana's guru Vaadindra Chudamani which is not available. Veturi Prabhakara Sastry in 1900s mentioned about the existence of Pre-Nannayya Chandassu in Raja Raja Narendra Pattabhisheka Sanchika. Accurate dating of this piece of literature happened after the 1980s discoveries in Karimnagar. ..  The Age of the Puranas (1020‚Äì1400 CE)  This is the period of Kavi Trayam or Trinity of Poets. Nannayya, Tikkana and Yerrapragada (or Errana) are known as the Kavi Trayam.  Nannaya Bhattarakudu or Adi Kavi (1022‚Äì1063 AD)  Nannaya Bhattarakudu's () Andhra mahabharatam, who lived around the 11th century, is commonly referred to as the first Telugu literary composition (aadi kaavyam). Although there is evidence of Telugu literature before Nannaya, he is given the epithet Aadi Kavi (\\"the first poet\\"). Nannaya was the first to establish a formal grammar of written Telugu. This grammar followed the patterns which existed in grammatical treatises like A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ and VƒÅlmƒ´kivyƒÅkaranam but unlike PƒÅ·πáini, Nannayya divided his work into five chapters, covering samjnƒÅ, sandhi, ajanta, halanta and kriya. Nannaya completed the first two chapters and a part of the third chapter of the Mahabharata epic, which is rendered in the Champu style.  Tikkanna Somayaji (1205‚Äì1288 AD)  Nannaya's Andhra Mahabharatam was almost completed by Tikkanna Somayaji () (1205‚Äì1288) who wrote chapters 4 to 18.  Errapragada  Errapragada, () who lived in the 14th century, finished the epic by completing the third chapter. He mimics Nannaya's style in the beginning, slowly changes tempo and finishes the chapter in the writing style of Tikkana. These three writers ‚Äì Nannaya, Tikkana and Yerrapragada ‚Äì are known as the Kavitraya (\\"three great poets\\") of Telugu. Other such translations like Marana‚Äôs Markandeya Puranam, Ketana‚Äôs Dasakumara Charita, Yerrapragada‚Äôs Harivamsam followed. Many scientific works, like Ganitasarasangrahamu by Pavuluri Mallana and Prakirnaganitamu by Eluganti Peddana, were written in the 12th century.  Baddena Bhupala (1220-1280AD)  Sumati Shatakam, which is a neeti (\\"moral\\"), is one of the most famous Telugu Shatakams. Shatakam is composed of more than a 100 padyalu (poems). According to many literary critics Sumati Shatakam was composed by Baddena Bhupaludu () (CE 1220‚Äì1280). He was also known as Bhadra Bhupala. He was a Chola prince and a vassal under the Kakatiya empress Rani Rudrama Devi, and a pupil of Tikkana. If we assume that the Sumati Shatakam was indeed written by Baddena, it would rank as one of the earliest Shatakams in Telugu along with the Vrushadhipa Satakam of Palkuriki Somanatha and the Sarveswara Satakam of Yathavakkula Annamayya. The Sumatee Shatakam is also one of the earliest Telugu works to be translated into a European language, as C. P. Brown rendered it in English in the 1840s. = The Prabandha Period (1400‚Äì1600 AD) =  Srinatha  Srinatha () (1365‚Äì1441) popularised the Prabandha style of composition. He was a minister in the court of Pedakomati Vemareddy of Kondaveedu and wrote Salivahana Saptasati, Shivaratri Mahatyam, Harivilasa, Bhimakanda, Kashi khandam, Shringara Naishadham, Palanati Veera charitra, Dhananjaya Vijayam, Sringara Dipika. These works were concerned with history and mythology. Srinatha's Srungara Naishadhamu is a well-known example of the form. Srinatha was widely regarded as the Kavi Sarvabhowma (\\"the emperor among poets\\").  Vemana  Kumaragiri Vema Reddy (), popularly known as Yogi Vemana, was a 14th-century Telugu poet. His poems were written in the popular vernacular of Telugu, and are known for their use of simple language and native idioms. His poems discuss the subjects of Yoga, wisdom and morality. There is no consensus among scholars about the period in which Vemana lived. C.P. Brown, known for his research on Vemana, estimates the year of birth to be the year 1352 based on some of his verses. His poems are four lines in length. The fourth line is, in the majority of the cases, the chorus Vishwadhabhirama Vinura Vema ‚Äì he thus conveyed his message with three small lines written in a simple vernacular. He traveled widely across south India, acquiring popularity as a poet and Yogi. So high was the regard for Vemana that a popular Telugu saying goes 'Vemana's word is the word of the Vedas'. He is celebrated for his style of Chaatu padyam, a poem with a hidden meaning. Many lines of Vemana's poems are now colloquial phrases of the Telugu language. They end with the signature line Vishwadhaabhi Raama, Vinura Vema, literally Beloved of Vishwadha, listen Vema. There are many interpretations of what the last line signifies.  Bammera Potanaamatya  Bammera Potanaamatya () (1450‚Äì1510) is best known for his translation of the Bhagavata Purana from Sanskrit to Telugu. His work, Andhra Maha Bhagavatamu. He was born into a Brahmin family and was considered to be a Sahaja Kavi (\\"natural poet\\") who needed no teacher. He wrote Bhogini Dandakam a poem praising king Singa Bhoopala's consort danseuse, Bhogini, while young. This is the earliest available Telugu Dandaka (a rhapsody which uses the same gana or foot throughout). His second work was Virabhadra Vijayamu which describes the adventures of Virabhadra, son of Shiva. As a young man, he was a devotee of Shiva and also Rama and was more interested in salvation, from which came the inspiration to translate the Bhagavata Purana.  Annamacharya  Tallapaka Annamacharya (or Annamayya) () (9 May 1408 ‚Äì 23 February 1503) is known as the Pada-kavita Pitaamaha of the Telugu language.Source of his history: http://www.svasa.org/annamacharya1.html He was born to a Vaidiki Brahmin family and his works are considered to have dominated and influenced the structure of Carnatic music compositions. Annamacharya is said to have composed as many as 32,000 sankeertanas (songs) on Bhagwaan Govinda Venkateswara, of which only about 12,000 are available today. His keertana compositions are based on the Vishishtadvaita school of thought. Annamayya was educated in this system of Ramanuja by Sri Satagopa Yateendra of the Ahobila matham.  Tallapaka Tirumalamma  Tallapaka Tirumalamma () (Annamacharya's wife) wrote Subhadra Kalyanam, and is considered the first female poet in Telugu literature. Her main work, Subhadra Kalyanam, which consists of 1170 poems, is about the marriage of Arjuna and Subhadra, who are characters that appear in the Mahabharata. She presented the Telugu nativity and culture in the story taken from Sanskrit epic.  Allasani Peddana  Allasani Peddana () (15th and 16th centuries) was ranked as the foremost of the Ashtadiggajalu the title for the group of eight poets in the court of Krishnadevaraya, a ruler of the Vijayanagara Empire. Peddana was a native of Somandepalli near Anantapur. Allasani Peddana wrote the first major Prabandha and for this reason he is revered as Andhra Kavita Pitamaha (\\"the grand father of Telugu poetry\\"). It is believed that he was also a minister in the king's court and is hence sometimes referred as Peddanaamaatya (Peddana + Amaatya = Peddana, the minister). He wrote Swaarochisha Manu Sambhavam (also known as Manu Charitra), which is a development of an episode in the Markandeya Purana relating to the birth of Svarochishamanu, who is one of the fourteen Manus. Pravarakhya is a pious Brahmin youth who goes to the Himalayas for Tapasya. In the Himalayas Varudhini, a Gandharva girl, falls in love with him, but Pravarakyudu rejects her love. Knowing this a Gandharva youth who was earlier rejected by Varudhini assumes the form of Pravarakhya and succeeds to win her love. To them is born Svarochisha, the father of Svarochishamanu. The theme for his Manu Charitra is a short story from Markandeya Purana. It is about second Manu of fourteen manus (fathers of mankind societies according to Hindu mythology), translated into Telugu from Sanskrit by Marana (1291‚Äì1323), disciple of Tikkana. The original story was around 150 poems and Peddana extended into six chapters with 600 poems by adding fiction and descriptions. His work was treated as one of the Pancha Kavyas, the five best works in Telugu. Some of his other famous works such as Harikathaasaaramu are untraceable now.  Dhurjati  Dhurjati or Dhoorjati () (15th and 16th centuries) was a poet in the court of Krishnadevaraya and was one of the 'Ashtadiggajalu'. He was born to Singamma and Narayana in Sri Kalahasti and was the grandson of Jakkayya. His works include Sri Kalahasteeshwara Mahatyam (The grace/miracles of Lord Shiva) and Sri Kalahasteeshwara Shatakam (100+ poems in the praise of Lord Shiva). Dhurjati took themes from Puranas and added local stories and myths in his work. Unlike contemporaries such as Peddana and Mallana, who chose the stories of kings, he chose devotion as his theme. Krishnadevaraya praised Dhurjati, saying \\"Stuti mati yaina Andhrakavi Dhurjati palkulakelagalgeno yetulita madhuri mahima....\\" (How is Dhurjati's poetry so immeasurably beautiful). On a personal note, he was known as Pedda Dhurjati (\\"elder Dhurjati\\") as there were four other people from the same family line who went by the name of Dhurjati during the same period and after him. His grandson Venkataraya Dhurjati, wrote Indumati Parinayam (\\"marriage of Indumati\\"), a story from Kalidasa's Raghuvamsam.  Krishnadevaraya  Krishnadevaraya () was an emperor of Vijayanagara Kingdom. Literary activities flourished during the rule of the Vijayanagara dynasty, and the period of Krishnadevaraya's rule in the sixteenth century is considered to be the golden age of Telugu literature. Krishnadevaraya, a poet himself, introduced the Prabandha to Telugu literature. Amukta Malyada. Krishna Deva Raya wrote the book Amuktamalyada in Telugu, describing the pangs of separation suffered by Andal (an incarnation of the goddess Mahalakshmi. He describes Andal's physical beauty in thirty verses; using descriptions of the spring and the monsoon as metaphors. As elsewhere in Indian poetry, the sensual pleasure of union extends beyond the physical level and becomes a path to, and a metaphor for, spirituality and ultimate union with the divine. His court had the Ashtadiggajas (\\"eight elephants\\"), who were considered to be the greatest of poets of that time. Some critics dismiss the following period, dominated by prabandhas, as a decadent age. Of the dozens of works of the eighteenth- to mid-nineteenth century, Kankanti Paparaju‚Äôs Uttara Ramayana in campu style, and the play Vishnumayavilasa stand out. Other genres bloomed at the same time. Yakshaganas, indigenous dramas of song and prose, were also produced.  Tenali Ramakrishna  Garlapati Tenali Ramakrishna (), popularly known as Tenali Rama and Vikata Kavi, was another sixteenth-century court poet of the Vijayanagara empire and also one of the Ashtadiggajas. His family had originally hailed from Tenali in Guntur District, he was born in a Telugu Niyogi Brahmin family. His famous work Panduranga Mahatyamu is one among the Pancha Kavyas. He dedicated that to Viruri Vedadri. This book is about the Pundarika Kshetram on the banks of river Bhaimi and its legend. He also composed Udbhataradhya Charitram on the story of Udbhata, a monk, as well as Ghatikachala Mahatyam about Ghatikachalam, a place of worship for God Narasimha near Vellore. He followed the Prabandha style. He took the theme for Panduranga Mahatyam from the Skanda Purana and enhanced it with many stories about the devotees of God Vitthala (Panduranga). He is noted for brilliance and wit and for mocking other poets and great personalities. He created a celebrated character called Nigama Sarma akka (sister of Nigama Sarma) and a story about her without giving her a name. He also had written many Chatuvu (extempore poems). = The post-Prabandha Period (1600-1850) =  Kshetrayya  Kshetrayya or Kshetragna () () was a prolific poet and composer of Carnatic music. He lived in the area of Andhra Pradesh. He composed a number of padams and keertanas, the prevalent formats of his time. He is credited with more than 4000 compositions, although only a handful have survived. He composed his songs on his favourite deity Krishna (Gopala) in Telugu. He perfected the padam format that is still being used today. His padams are sung in dance (Bharatanatyam and Kuchipudi) and music recitals. A unique feature of his padams is the practice of singing the anupallavi first then the pallavi (second verse followed by first verse). Most of the padams are of the theme of longing for the coming of the lord Krishna. He wrote with Sringara as a main theme in expressing madhurabhakti (devotion to the supreme). Sringara is a motif where the mundane sexual relationship between a Nayaki (woman) and a Nayaka (man) is used as a metaphor, denoting the yearning of jeeva (usually depicted as the Nayaki) to unite with the divine (usually depicted as the man). In most of his compositions, Kshetrayya has used the mudra (signature) \\"Muvva Gopala\\" as a reference to himself, which is also a name for Lord Krishna in Kshetrayya's village Muvva, now called as Movva. Kshetrayya's work has played a major role in influencing poetry, dance, music of the South Indian tradition. Kshetrayya was intimately connected with the devadasi women of the temples of south India, who were the subject of many of his compositions. The devadasis were traditionally in possession of the musical/poetic interpretations of his work for a long period of time till the devadasi system was abolished and the compositions became more accepted in the musical community as valuable works of art. The musical community also owes a lot to Veena Dhanammal and T. Brinda, who popularised Kshetrayya's songs with their beautiful musical interpretation. Kshetrayya's padyams now form an integral part of the dance and musical traditions of South India, where his songs are rendered purely as musical works or as accompaniments to dance.  Kancherla Gopanna  Kancherla Gopanna () (c 1620‚Äì1680 CE), popularly known as Bhadradri Ramadasu or Bhadrachala Ramadasu (), was a 17th-century Indian devotee of Rama and a composer of Carnatic music. He is one among the famous vaggeyakaras (same person being the writer and composer of a song) in the Telugu language. His devotional lyrics to Rama are famous in South Indian classical music as Ramadaasu Keertanalu. Even the doyen of South Indian classical music Saint Thyagaraja learned and later improved the style now considered standard kriti form of music composition. He also has written Dasarathi Shatakamu a collection of nearly 100 poems dedicated to the son of Dasaratha (Lord Rama).  Venkamamba  Tarikonda Venkamamba (Telugu:‡∞§‡∞æ‡∞∞‡∞ø‡∞ï‡±ä‡∞Ç‡∞° ‡∞µ‡±Ü‡∞Ç‡∞ï‡∞Æ‡∞æ‡∞Ç‡∞¨ ; alternate spelling: Vengamamba, born 1730) was a poet and staunch devotee of Lord Venkateswara in the 18th century. She wrote numerous poems and songs.  Tyagaraja  Tyagaraja or Tyagabrahmam () (1767‚Äì1847) of Tanjore composed devotional songs in Telugu, which form a big part of the repertoire of Carnatic music. In addition to nearly 600 compositions (kritis), Tyagaraja composed two musical plays in Telugu, the Prahalada Bhakti Vijayam and the Nauka Charitam. Prahlada Bhakti Vijayam is in five acts with 45 kritis set in 28 ragas and 138 verses, in different metres in Telugu. Nauka Charitam is a shorter play in one act with 21 kritis set in 13 ragas and 43 verses. The latter is the most popular of Tyagaraja's operas, and is a creation of the composer's own imagination and has no basis in the Bhagavata Purana. Often overlooked is the fact that Tyagaraja's works are some of the best and most beautiful literary expressions in Telugu language. Valmiki composed the Ramayana, the story of Rama, with 24,000 verses and also composed 24,000 kritis in praise of the lord.  Paravastu Chinnayasuri  Paravastu Chinnayasuri () (1807‚Äì1861) wrote Baala Vyaakaranamu in a new style after doing extensive research on Andhra Grammar which is his greatest gift to Telugu people. Other notable works of Chinnayasuri include Neeti Chandrika, Sootandhra Vyaakaranamu, Andhra Dhatumoola and Neeti Sangrahamu. Chinnayasuri translated Mitra Labham and Mitra Bhedam from the Sanskrit Panchatantra as Neeti Chandrika. Kandukuri Veeresalingam and Kokkonda Venkata Ratnam Pantulu followed his style of prose writing and wrote Vigrahamu and Sandhi in a different pattern. = Modern Period =  Modern Telugu Poetry  This started with Gurajada Apparao, who changed the face of Telugu poetry with his Muthayala Saralu, and was perfected by later writers in the Romanticism era including Rayaprolu and Devulapalli Krishna Sastri. Gurajada's attempt to reform Telugu poetry by shedding old rules and styles reached a zenith with Sri Sri. SriSri's famous work \\"Maha Prastanam\\" is an instant hit with every corners of society. Many writers followed his style and continue to enrich the literature.  Kandukuri Veeresalingam  Kandukuri Veeresalingam (Telugu: ‡∞ï‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡±Å‡∞ï‡±Ç‡∞∞‡∞ø ‡∞µ‡±Ä‡∞∞‡±á‡∞∂‡∞≤‡∞ø‡∞Ç‡∞ó‡∞Ç) (also known as Kandukuri Veeresalingam Pantulu (Telugu: ‡∞ï‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡±Å‡∞ï‡±Ç‡∞∞‡∞ø ‡∞µ‡±Ä‡∞∞‡±á‡∞∂‡∞≤‡∞ø‡∞Ç‡∞ó‡∞Ç ‡∞™‡∞Ç‡∞§‡±Å‡∞≤‡±Å), (16 April 1848 ‚Äì 27 May 1919) was a social reformer of Andhra Pradesh. He was born in an orthodox Andhra Brahmin family. He is widely considered as the man who first brought about a renaissance in Telugu people and Telugu literature. He was influenced by the ideals of Brahmo Samaj particularly those of Keshub Chunder Sen. Veereshalingam panthulu is popularly called Gadya Tikkana. He wrote about 100 books between 1869 and 1919 and introduced the essay, biography, autobiography and the novel into Telugu literatureNatarajan, Nalini and Emmanuel Sampath Nelson, editors, Handbook of Twentieth-century Literatures of India, Chapter 11: \\"Twentieth-Century Telugu Literature\\" by G. K. Subbarayudu and C. Vijayasree' ', pp. 306‚Äì328, retrieved via Google Books, January 4, 20089 His Satyavati Charitam was the first social novel in Telugu. He wrote Rajashekhara Charitamu inspired by Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefied. To him literature was an instrument to fight social evils.  Mangalampalli Balamurali Krishna  Mangalampalli Balamurali Krishna () (born 6 July 1930) is a Carnatic vocalist, multi- instrumentalist and a playback singer. He is also acclaimed as a poet, composer and respected for his knowledge of Carnatic Music. Balamuralikrishna was born in Sankaraguptam, East Godavari District, Andhra Pradesh state. Dr Balamuralikrishna has composed over 400 compositions in various languages like Telugu and Sanskrit. His compositions range from Devotional to Varnams, Kirtis, Javalis, and Thillans. His greatest achievement is the compositions in all the fundamental 72 melakarta ragas.  Aatreya  Aacharya Aatreya () or Kilambi Venkata Narasimhacharyulu (7 May 1921 ‚Äì 13 September 1989) was a playwright, lyrics and story writer of the Telugu film industry. He was born as Kilambi Venkata Narasimhacharyulu on 7 May 1921 in the Mangalampadu village of Sullurpeta Mandalam in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh. His pen name is based on their family Gotra. Known for his poetry on the human soul and heart, he was given the title 'Manasu Kavi'(Poet of Heart), which can be rewritten as 'Mana Su Kavi'(Our Good Poet). His poetry is philosophical and intellectually satisfying.  Tripuraneni Ramaswamy  Tripuranƒìni RƒÅmasvƒÅmi (January 15, 1887 ‚Äì January 16, 1943) was a lawyer, famous poet, playwright and reformer active among the Telugu-speaking people. Popularly known as Kaviraju, he is considered the first poet to introduce rationalism and humanism into Telugu poetry and literature. Ramaswamy chose literary writing as the vehicle for expressing his rationalist thoughts. His famous work 'Sutaparanam' in four cantos was a fierce attack on the ancient Puranas, he has attained the state of excellence in poetic&literary; criticism. His poetic work \\"Kuppuswamy Satakam\\" reveals the theme of social revolution and talks about social evils, blind faith, and indignity to man. He was against Congress and its fight against independence. In his other works such as \\"Sambhukavadha\\", \\"Suthashrama geetaalu', 'Dhoorta maanava', 'Khooni', 'Bhagavadgita', 'Rana Pratap' and 'Kondaveeti patanam', he made a rational analysis of dogmas prescribed by ancient classics and the injustice these dogmas did to people belonging to the lower social orders. Moreover, he attacked discriminatory practices and fought against the idea of untouchability. Sambhuka Vadha created a lot of controversies. Sambhuka was a character who did tapas to go heaven with the live body before death. That was considered as adharma and was killed by Lord Rama. This story was interpreted that Brahmins do not like doing tapas by non-Brahmins, which is why Sabhuka was killed.  Political Movements  = Paryavaran Kavitodyamam = The Paryavaran Kavitodyamam movement started in 2008. It aims to bring awareness and concern among not only the elite class but also the masses through creative forms of literature. The Jagruthi Kiran Foundation initiated it under the leadership of Narayanam Narasimha Murthy, popularly known as \\"Vidyavachaspati\\". The movement has literary activities including Harita Kata. Lot of literature has been produced by various poets, writers on Environment. Magazines such as Malle Teega and Kadhakeli are associated with Jagruthi Kiran Foundation. More than 500 poets and writers are involved in this movement.

Numerous biographical books and documentaries about him have been produced since his death. , nicknamed the , was the founder of one of Japan's most notorious yakuza gangs, the Tosei-Kai. Life =Early years= According to his widow Yasuyo, Machii was born Jeong Geon-Yeong (Ï†ïÍ±¥ÏòÅ/) as the first-generation Korean born in Minami-Sakuma Cho, Shiba Ward, Tokyo. His mother left him in the care of his grandmother in Keijo, Seoul. He returned to Tokyo when he was thirteen. After World War II, Machii became involved in postwar Japan's thriving black market. He entered Senshu University in 1943, however, he dropped out of it. By 1948, he had formed his own gang, the Tosei-kai or \\"Voice of the East Gang\\" which grew to over 1,500 members by the early 1960s. The Tosei-kai became so powerful in Tokyo that they were known as the Ginza police, and even the Yamaguchi-gumi's Taoka had to cut a deal with Machii to allow that group to operate in Tokyo. =Under the American occupation= Like fellow yakuza powerbroker Yoshio Kodama, Machii had good relations with the US occupation authorities due to his staunch anti-Communist stance: Tosei-kai soldiers were often used as strikebreakers during the occupation years. Machii himself worked with the United States Counter Intelligence Corps. While leaders of the Japanese yakuza were imprisoned or under close scrutiny by the American occupying forces, the Korean yakuza were free to take over the lucrative black markets. But rather than trying to rival the Japanese godfathers, Machii made alliances with them, and throughout his career, he remained close to both Kodama and Taoka. Machii's vast empire included tourism, entertainment, bars and restaurants, prostitution, and oil importing. He and Kodama made a fortune on real estate investments alone. More importantly, he brokered deals between the Korean government and the yakuza that allowed Japanese criminals to set up rackets in Korea. Thanks to Machii, Korea became the yakuza's home away from home. Befitting his role as fixer between the underworlds of both countries, Machii was allowed to acquire the largest ferry service between Shimonoseki, Japan, and Busan, South Korea‚Äîthe shortest route between the two countries. =Role in the kidnapping of Kim Dae-jung= He was widely believed to have helped the Korean Central Intelligence Agency kidnap then-leading Korean opposition leader Kim Dae-jung from a Tokyo hotel (see kidnapping of Kim Dae- jung). Kim was whisked out to sea where he was bound, gagged, blindfolded and fitted with weights so that his body would never surface. =Successors to the Tosei-kai= By 1965, increasing police pressure led Machii to disband the Tosei-kai. But in their place, he formed two \\"legitimate\\" front organizations, the Toa Yuai Jigyo Kumiai ( East Asia Friendship Enterprises Association) and the Toa Sogo Kigyo ( East Asia Enterprises Company), which was headed by Kodama. The Toa Yuai Jigyo Kumiai, commonly known as the Toa-kai, is still an active yakuza gang in Japan with an estimated membership of 1,000. The group is still composed mostly of ethnic Koreans, Machii having paved the way for Korean involvement in the Japanese underworld. Machii himself retired in the 1980s. =Struggles involving the Pugwan Ferry= In the late 20th Century, following South Korea's increasing demand for travel due to the country's economic growth, the Busan-Shimonoseki Pugwan Ferry company attempted to expand into the Kyushu island, however the project was abandoned - several articles dated at that time reveal that nearly 70 Toa-kai members were shot or stabbed within a week in Tokyo, and it was strongly believed that the perpetrators, from the underworld, were those belonging to the Kudo-kai (controlling the Kokura Port) or the Dojin-kai (controlling most ports in western Kyushu). The Dojin-kai theory, which indicated that the Dojin-kai attempted to compel the Toa-kai to co-operate in drug trafficking but the Toa- kai rejected it and then the mass attacks started and continued until the Toa- kai determined to abandon the project and pay an outrageous amount of \\"settlement money\\" to the Dojin-kai, was more believed, as this type of gangland attack was historically the Dojin-kai's specialty but not the Kudo- kai's. Speculation exists that if Machii were active, this would never happen; at that time, the Toa-kai was headed by Morihiro Okita, the third-generation president with a bad reputation among the members due to his poor leadership. The Pugwan Ferry company's Hiroshima Port office opened in 2002 and had been active until 2005 before its closure. The Shimonoseki office is still active today.

On the x axis, the pendulum position, and on the y one its speed. In mathematics, a flow formalizes the idea of the motion of particles in a fluid. Flows are ubiquitous in science, including engineering and physics. The notion of flow is basic to the study of ordinary differential equations. Informally, a flow may be viewed as a continuous motion of points over time. More formally, a flow is a group action of the real numbers on a set. The idea of a vector flow, that is, the flow determined by a vector field, occurs in the areas of differential topology, Riemannian geometry and Lie groups. Specific examples of vector flows include the geodesic flow, the Hamiltonian flow, the Ricci flow, the mean curvature flow, and Anosov flows. Flows may also be defined for systems of random variables and stochastic processes, and occur in the study of ergodic dynamical systems. The most celebrated of these is perhaps the Bernoulli flow. Formal definition A flow on a set is a group action of the additive group of real numbers on . More explicitly, a flow is a mapping :\\\\varphi:X\\\\times \\\\R\\\\rightarrow X such that, for all ‚àà and all real numbers and , :\\\\varphi(x,0) = x; :\\\\varphi(\\\\varphi(x,t),s) = \\\\varphi(x,s+t). It is customary to write instead of , so that the equations above can be expressed as (identity function) and (group law). Then, for all , the mapping is a bijection with inverse . This follows from the above definition, and the real parameter may be taken as a generalized functional power, as in function iteration. Flows are usually required to be compatible with structures furnished on the set . In particular, if is equipped with a topology, then is usually required to be continuous. If is equipped with a differentiable structure, then is usually required to be differentiable. In these cases the flow forms a one parameter subgroup of homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms, respectively. In certain situations one might also consider local flows, which are defined only in some subset :\\\\mathrm{dom}(\\\\varphi) = \\\\\\\\{ (x,t) \\\\  \\\\ t\\\\in[a_x,b_x], \\\\ a_x<0 called the flow domain of . This is often the case with the flows of vector fields. = Alternative notations = It is very common in many fields, including engineering, physics and the study of differential equations, to use a notation that makes the flow implicit. Thus, is written for , and one might say that the \\"variable depends on the time and the initial condition \\". Examples are given below. In the case of a flow of a vector field on a smooth manifold , the flow is often denoted in such a way that its generator is made explicit. For example, :\\\\Phi_V:X\\\\times\\\\mathbb R\\\\to X; \\\\qquad (x,t)\\\\mapsto\\\\Phi_V^t(x).  Orbits  Given in , the set \\\\\\\\{ \\\\varphi(x,t) : t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\\\\\} is called the orbit of under . Informally, it may be regarded as the trajectory of a particle that was initially positioned at . If the flow is generated by a vector field, then its orbits are the images of its integral curves.  Examples  = Autonomous systems of ordinary differential equations = Let be a (time-independent) vector field and the solution of the initial value problem :\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{x}}(t) = \\\\boldsymbol{F}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}(t)), \\\\qquad \\\\boldsymbol{x}(0)=\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0. Then is the flow of the vector field F. It is a well-defined local flow provided that the vector field is Lipschitz-continuous. Then is also Lipschitz-continuous wherever defined. In general it may be hard to show that the flow is globally defined, but one simple criterion is that the vector field F is compactly supported. = Time-dependent ordinary differential equations = In the case of time-dependent vector fields , one denotes , where is the solution of :\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{x}}(t) = \\\\boldsymbol{F}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}(t),t), \\\\qquad \\\\boldsymbol{x}(t_0)=\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0. Then is the time-dependent flow of F. It is not a \\"flow\\" by the definition above, but it can easily be seen as one by rearranging its arguments. Namely, the mapping : \\\\varphi:(\\\\mathbb R^n\\\\times\\\\mathbb R)\\\\times\\\\mathbb R \\\\to \\\\mathbb R^n\\\\times\\\\mathbb R; \\\\qquad \\\\varphi((\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0, t_0), t)=(\\\\varphi^{t,t_0}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0),t+t_0) indeed satisfies the group law for the last variable: :\\\\varphi(\\\\varphi((\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0,t_0),t),s) = \\\\varphi((\\\\varphi^{t,t_0}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0),t+t_0),s) = (\\\\varphi^{s,t+t_0}(\\\\varphi^{t,t_0}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0)),s+t+t_0) = (\\\\varphi^{s,t+t_0}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}(t+t_0)),s+t+t_0) = (\\\\boldsymbol{x}(s+t+t_0),s+t+t_0) = (\\\\varphi^{s+t,t_0}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0),s+t+t_0) =\\\\varphi((\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0,t_0),s+t). One can see time-dependent flows of vector fields as special cases of time-independent ones by the following trick. Define :\\\\boldsymbol{G}(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t):=(\\\\boldsymbol{F}(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t),1), \\\\qquad \\\\boldsymbol{y}(t) :=(\\\\boldsymbol{x}(t+t_0),t+t_0). Then y(t) is the solution of the \\"time-independent\\" initial value problem : \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{y}}(s) = \\\\boldsymbol{G}(\\\\boldsymbol{y}(s)), \\\\qquad \\\\boldsymbol{y}(0)=(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_0,t_0) if and only if is the solution of the original time-dependent initial value problem. Furthermore, then the mapping is exactly the flow of the \\"time-independent\\" vector field G. = Flows of vector fields on manifolds = The flows of time-independent and time- dependent vector fields are defined on smooth manifolds exactly as they are defined on the Euclidean space and their local behavior is the same. However, the global topological structure of a smooth manifold is strongly manifest in what kind of global vector fields it can support, and flows of vector fields on smooth manifolds are indeed an important tool in differential topology. The bulk of studies in dynamical systems are conducted on smooth manifolds, which are thought of as \\"parameter spaces\\" in applications. = Solutions of heat equation = Let be a subdomain (bounded or not) of ‚Ñùn (with an integer). Denote by its boundary (assumed smooth). Consider the following Heat Equation on √ó (0,), for > 0, : \\\\begin{array}{rcll} u_t - \\\\Delta u & = & 0 & \\\\mbox{ in } \\\\Omega \\\\times (0,T),  u & = & 0 & \\\\mbox{ on } \\\\Gamma \\\\times (0,T), \\\\end{array} with the following initial boundary condition in . The equation = 0 on corresponds to the Homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. The mathematical setting for this problem can be the semigroup approach. To use this tool, we introduce the unbounded operator defined on L^2(\\\\Omega) by its domain : D(\\\\Delta_D) = H^2(\\\\Omega) \\\\cap H_0^1(\\\\Omega) (see the classical Sobolev spaces with H^k(\\\\Omega) = W^{k,2}(\\\\Omega) and :H_0^1(\\\\Omega) = {\\\\overline{C_0^\\\\infty (\\\\Omega)} } ^{H^1(\\\\Omega)} is the closure of the infinitely differentiable functions with compact support in for the H^1(\\\\Omega)-norm). For any v \\\\in D(\\\\Delta_D) , we have : \\\\Delta_D v = \\\\Delta v = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 }{\\\\partial x_i^2} v ~. With this operator, the heat equation becomes u'(t) = \\\\Delta_Du(t) and . Thus, the flow corresponding to this equation is (see notations above) : \\\\varphi(u^0,t) = \\\\mbox{e}^{t\\\\Delta_D}u^0 where is the (analytic) semigroup generated by . = Solutions of wave equation = Again, let be a subdomain (bounded or not) of ‚Ñùn (with an integer). We denote by its boundary (assumed smooth). Consider the following Wave Equation on \\\\Omega \\\\times (0,T) (for > 0), : \\\\begin{array}{rcll} u_{tt} - \\\\Delta u & = & 0 & \\\\mbox{ in } \\\\Omega \\\\times (0,T),  u & = & 0 & \\\\mbox{ on } \\\\Gamma \\\\times (0,T), \\\\end{array} with the following initial condition in \\\\Omega and u_t(0) = u^{2,0} \\\\mbox{ in } \\\\Omega. Using the same semigroup approach as in the case of the Heat Equation above. We write the wave equation as a first order in time partial differential equation by introducing the following unbounded operator, : \\\\mathcal{A} = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc} 0 & Id  \\\\Delta_D & 0 \\\\end{array}\\\\right) with domain D(\\\\mathcal{A}) = H^2(\\\\Omega) \\\\cap H_0^1(\\\\Omega) \\\\times H_0^1(\\\\Omega) on H = H^1_0(\\\\Omega) \\\\times L^2(\\\\Omega) (the operator \\\\Delta_D is defined in the previous example). We introduce the column vectors : U = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} u^1  u^2 \\\\end{array}\\\\right) (where u^1 = u and u^2 = u_t) and : U^0 = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} u^{1,0}  u^{2,0} \\\\end{array} \\\\right). With these notions, the Wave Equation becomes U'(t) = \\\\mathcal{A}U(t) and U(0) = U^0 . Thus, the flow corresponding to this equation is \\\\varphi(U^0,t) = \\\\mbox{e}^{t\\\\mathcal{A}}U^0 where \\\\mbox{e}^{t\\\\mathcal{A}} is the (unitary) semigroup generated by \\\\mathcal{A}. = Bernoulli flow = Ergodic dynamical systems, that is, systems exhibiting randomness, exhibit flows as well. The most celebrated of these is perhaps the Bernoulli flow. The Ornstein isomorphism theorem states that, for any given entropy , there exists a flow , called the Bernoulli flow, such that the flow at time =1, i.e. , is a Bernoulli shift. Furthermore, this flow is unique, up to a constant rescaling of time. That is, if , is another flow with the same entropy, then , for some constant . The notion of uniqueness and isomorphism here is that of the isomorphism of dynamical systems. Many dynamical systems, including Sinai's billiards and Anosov flows are isomorphic to Bernoulli shifts.

Theodoric was an Arian Christian and decided to let the Goths (Arians) and the Orthodox Chalcedonian Christians live together but separately, and so there were separate neighborhoods and separate religious buildings. Near his palace, the king commissioned an Arian cathedral, now called the Church of Spirito Santo, but originally named Hagia Anastasis (Holy Resurrection). It was re- consecrated as the Chalcedonian cathedral of Saint Teodoro (soldier and martyr of Amasea in Pontus) in 526 AD. Little remains of the original church after its reconstruction in 1543; some historians speculate that the original mosaics were lost over a thousand years earlier during its Catholic reconstruction due to Arian themes. During this same period, Theodoric also had the baptistry built, today referred to as \\"of the Arians\\" in order to distinguish it from the Baptistry of Neon (of the Orthodox) which is about one century older.  Shape and structure  The Baptistry is octagonal in shape with some little apses and arched openings near the top. Along the external perimeter there was once a walkway that stopped at the eastern apse. Clearly, the building was once part of a larger complex. Inside are four niches and a dome with mosaics, depicting the baptism of Jesus by Saint John the Baptist. Jesus is shown as a beardless, half-submerged in the Jordan. John the Baptist is wearing a leopard skin. On the left stands a white-haired, old man in a green cloak, holding a leather bag. He is the personification of the river Jordan. Above, the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove sprays lustral water from its beak. Below, a procession of the Apostles, led in separate directions by Saint Peter and Saint Paul circle the dome, meeting at a throne with a jeweled crucifix resting on a purple cushion. It took the artists several years to complete these mosaics, as can be clearly seen from the different colors of the stones used to depict the grass at the feet of the apostles. The designs are quite simple, but the excessive use of a gold background should be noted, as it was typically used in this era to infuse these simple scenes with an ethereal glow.  Similarity to Eastern Orthodox architecture  The entire composition is remarkably similar to that of the Orthodox Baptistry of Neon. The walls are bare, but were not always so. During archaeological investigations, some 170 kilograms of tessera were found on the floor. Due to the lack of Arian references, it is believed that the artists who created the mosaics were Orthodox Christians, as the Ostrogoths were predominantly goldsmiths and not mosaic artists. In 565, after the condemnation of the Arian sect, this small octagonal brick structure was converted into a Chalcedonian oratory named Santa Maria. Eastern-Rite monks added a monastery during the period of the Exarchate of Ravenna and further dedicated the structure to Saint Maria in Cosmedin. Around the year 1700, the structure passed into private hands, and in 1914 it was acquired by the Italian government. The Allied bombardment of World War II helped clear away other structures which had encroached on it from all sides, enabling researchers to view the details of its exterior for the first time. As with other monuments in Ravenna, the original floor is now some 2.3 meters underground.  Notability  The Baptistry is one of the eight structures in Ravenna registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

It was followed in 1992 by F-15 Strike Eagle III, the final game of the series. The plane is equipped with a M61 Vulcan and three different kinds of missiles, Sidewinders, AMRAAMs and Mavericks. In F-15 Strike Eagle II comes with four scenarios: Libya, Persian Gulf, Vietnam and Middle East. In a mission the player has to fight a variety of enemy aircraft, missile boats, satellite stations and other ground targets, to take out one primary and one secondary target, making sure to not attack friendly targets. Promotions and medals are based on the mission score. Strike Eagle II was very similar in both appearance and game play to MicroProse's previous release F-19 Stealth Fighter. Like many flight simulators of the time, realism was at times sacrificed due to either computing requirements or playability. In 1991, a scenario disk was released called F-15 II Operation Desert Storm. It added three new scenarios, two from the earlier F-19 Stealth Fighter, North Cape and Central Europe, and a new scenario based on the contemporary Gulf War called Desert Storm. In addition night missions, improved sound support and new weapons were included. Reception The game was reviewed positively in Computer Gaming World. The review described it as \\"a gamer's game\\", emphasizing the game aspects over the simulation, and notably less complicated than F-19 Stealth Fighter. 1992 and 1994 surveys in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game three and a half stars out of five.

The series follows the personal and professional lives of one shift of police officers from the fictional Newton Park police station in Merseyside, England. A total of four series were broadcast, with the final episode airing on 19 January 2004. The series had an ensemble cast, initially led by Haydn Gwynne as Superintendent Susan Blake. However, only three actors remained with the programme through all four series: John McArdle, Chris Walker and David Hargreaves. In 2001, prior to the programme's official launch, the first episode attracted controversy due to alleged similarities between its plot and the murder of James Bulger. However, BBC bosses defended the series, stating \\"there are no associations with the tragic case of James Bulger\\". In July and August 2002, Merseybeat faced heavy criticism upon its return for a second series. The broadcasting standards commission criticised the quality of the series, and ratings fell sharply. In June 2002, ratings fell below five million viewers for the first time in the programme's history and, in August of the same year, The Guardian reported that the number of viewers had dropped by one million compared to the opening episode of the second series. In late 2003, when Merseybeat commenced its fourth series, it underwent a major revamp, including the scrapping of the title sequence and theme tune. A new closing theme was introduced, while each individual episode opened with a different musical number, including tracks from the likes of The Mock Turtles, Travis and Cast. A more \\"gritty\\" approach to the series was also taken as part of the revamp, with the introduction of the station's Criminal Investigation Department, led by Mark Womack, formerly of Liverpool 1 as DI Pete Hammond. For the first three series, filming took place mainly in the Cheshire towns of Widnes and Runcorn (both within the Borough of Halton), including other locations within Merseyside - making heavy use of local landmarks such as the Silver Jubilee Bridge and Fiddlers Ferry power station. The police station itself was a disused Golden Wonder factory, which is located in Widnes. For the fourth and final series, filming moved wholly to Liverpool; with some locations used in St. Helens, Merseyside.https://web.archive.org/web/20081203132735/http://merseybeat- online.co.uk/ The programme is notable for having never been repeated since broadcast; and despite strong interest from fans, it has never been released on DVD.

The town of W√©, on Lifou Island, is the administrative centre of the commune of Lifou as well as the provincial seat of the Loyalty Islands Province.  Geology  Like Mar√© and Ouv√©a, the other Loyalty islands, Lifou is made of fossil coral. Lifou is a makatea (raised coral atoll), an ancient lagoon slowly raised by geological processes. Due to the uplift, Lifou consists of a wide, flat centre surrounded by cliffs which correspond to the ancient reefal cliffs. The coral rock exhibits high porosity and hence, neither Lifou nor any of the other Loyalty Islands have surface water. It does, however, have a large freshwater reservoir which can be accessed through caves. These caves were used in the past when searching for fresh water, and are very important to the island's mythology. History =Economic= The first Europeans to have contact with Lifouans were whalers, who had very limited, and certainly not friendly, communications with them. Sandalwood traders also came to New Caledonia around 1841. =Religious= By the mid-19th century, there were Anglican missionaries at work on Lifou, although there had been natives and Polynesian immigrants doing religious work before then. In 1843, French Catholic missionaries arrived on Lifou; shortly afterward, the Anglicans and Catholics became involved in a religious war that lasted until the French takeover of Lifou in 1864. The missionaries even established a school on Lifou Island, and from 1840 to the early 20th century taught most of the population to read. They did enough religious work that in 1998 the Lifouans were referred to as \\"devout Christians.\\" Economy =Tourism= Lifou is a popular cruise port, with many cruises coming from Australia. The most common port-of-call is Easo; the ships anchor just off the island and tender passengers ashore, being too large for the wharf there. Lifou is known for its snorkeling. =Farming= The Lifouans grow several crops, including yams, taro, and bananas; they also produce copra. Famous residents *Christian Karembeu, a French footballer who won the 1998 FIFA World Cup with the French National side, is from Lifou. *Rosine Streeter, trade unionist, was born on Lifou.

Retrieved: 5 October 2009. Design and development In 1935, the Imperial Japanese Army held a competition between Nakajima, Mitsubishi, and Kawasaki to design a low- wing monoplane to replace the Kawasaki Ki-10 (Army Type 95 Fighter) biplane. The new fighter was to have also a better performance than the experimental Mitsubishi Ki-18. The results were the Nakajima Ki-27, the Kawasaki Ki-28, and the Mitsubishi Ki-33 (a modification of the Mitsubishi A5M carrier-based fighter). The Nakajima design was based on its earlier Ki-11 monoplane fighter which lost to the Ki-10 in the Type 95 Fighter competition. When the follow-up Nakajima Ki-12 proposal with a liquid-cooled engine and retractable landing gear was deemed too complex by the Japanese officials, the Ki-27 was designed by Koyama Yasushi to have an air-cooled radial engine and fixed landing gear. The aircraft had the Nakajima trademark wing with a straight leading edge and tapered trailing edge which would reappear again on the Ki-43, Ki-44, and Ki-84. The Ki-27 made its first flight on 15 October 1936. Although it had a slower top speed and worse climb performance than its competitors, the Army chose the Nakajima design for its outstanding turning ability granted by its remarkably low wing loading. The Army ordered 10 pre-production samples (Ki-27a) for further testing, which featured an enclosed cockpit with sliding canopy and larger wings. The type was officially accepted into service in 1937 as the Army Type 97 Fighter. In addition to Nakajima, the Ki-27 was also manufactured by Tachikawa Aircraft Company Ltd and Manshukoku Hikoki Seizo KK, with a total of 3,368 built before production ended in 1942. Battle of Khalkhyn Gol June 1939 Operational history The Ki-27 was the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force's main fighter until the start of World War II. When placed into combat service over northern China in March 1938, the Ki-27 enjoyed air superiority until the introduction of the faster Soviet-built Polikarpov I-16 fighters by the Chinese. A Ki-27 as used in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol. In the 1939 Battle of Khalkhin Gol against the USSR in Mongolia, the Ki-27 faced both Polikarpov I-15 biplane and Polikarpov I-16 monoplane fighters. In the initial phase of the conflict, its performance was a match for the early model I-16s, and was considerably superior to the I-15 biplane. With better trained Ki-27 pilots, the IJAAF gained aerial superiority. The Ki-27 was armed with two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 89 machine guns and as with most aircraft of the period, lacked armor protection for the pilot and self- sealing or fire suppression in the fuel tanks. Later, the Soviet Air Force received improved I-16s. The faster, more heavily armed (with twin wing- mounted 20mm ShVAK cannons) and armored I-16 now nullified the Ki-27's advantages and it could now escape from the Ki-27 in a dive. The VVS introduced new tactics consisting of flying in large tightly knit formations, attacking with altitude and/or speed advantage and hit-and-run (high-energy) tactics much as Claire Chennault would later formulate for the 1941-era Flying Tigers (likewise to fly against Japanese forces). Ki-27s at Nomonhan, 1939 Japanese losses mounted but despite this they claimed 1,340 aircraft (six times the admitted Soviet losses and three times as many as Soviet aircraft admitted to being in the theatre). Japanese losses numbered 120 (including Ki-10s) while the Russians claimed 215 vs. a peak Japanese strength of 200 fighters. (Overclaiming remained commonplace through World War Two, despite gun cameras and expert intelligence assessments.) Top scoring pilot of the incident and top scoring IJAAF pilot on the Ki-27 and overall World War II IJAAF ace was Warrant Officer Hiromichi Shinohara, who claimed 58 Soviet planes (including an IJAAF record of 11 in one day) whilst flying Ki-27s, only to be shot down himself by a number of I-16s on 27 August 1939. The preference of Japanese fighter pilots for the Ki-27's high rate of turn caused the Army to focus excessively on manoeuvrability, a decision which later handicapped the development of faster and more heavily armed fighters. The Ki-27 served until the beginning of World War II in the Pacific, escorting bombers attacking Malaya, Singapore, Netherlands East Indies, Burma and the Philippines (where it initially fared poorly against the Brewster F2A Buffalo). Ki-27 replica at Tokorozawa Aviation Museum The type also saw extensive action against the American Volunteer Group in the early months of the war. Soon outclassed by the American Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, the Ki-27 was replaced in front line service by the Nakajima Ki-43, while surviving examples continued to serve as a trainer. The Ki-27 was also exported for use with Manchukuo and Thai armed forces, seeing combat with both. In Thai service, Ki-27s reportedly damaged two North American P-51 Mustangs and shot down one Lockheed P-38 Lightning and one North American P-51 Mustang. In the final months of the war, desperate lack of aircraft forced the Japanese to utilize all available machines and the Ki-27 and 79 were no exception. Some were equipped with up to of explosives for kamikaze attacks, but some were redeployed as fighters, suffering terrible losses as on 16 February 1945 when the 39th Educational Flight Regiment scrambled 16 Ki-79 trainers from Yokoshiba Airfield to oppose a massive air raid from U.S. Task Force 58 carrier group, losing six aircraft with more damaged and five pilots killed, in return damaging at least one Hellcat and possibly downing a second.

From the effective start date, the coverage exists for perpetuity. The insured deposits money, called a deposit premium, with the insurer for insurance for the life of the risk. The deposit is many times larger than the cost of a non-refundable, annual premium for an equivalent policy with a one-year term. The insurer must earn enough income from investing the deposits to cover losses and operating expenses for the model to be economically viable. Upon cancellation, the insured is entitled to a full refund of the initial deposit premium, usually without interest. Perpetual insurance, first issued in the U.S. in Philadelphia in 1752, is still used for fire and homeowner's insurance. In the United States, there are also tax advantages to perpetual insurance. The deposit premium does not yield any income to the insured. However, the expense of the annual premium for term homeowners insurance is eliminated. Therefore, the tax-adjusted, equivalent rate of return to the insured homeowner on the deposit premium can be calculated by taking the gross amount of money he or she needs to earn to net the amount of an annual premium for a term policy, divided by the amount of the deposit premium. For example, a house which costs $150,000 may typically be charged an annual premium of $1,000 for a term policy. That same house would likely require a $10,000 single deposit premium for a perpetual insurance policy of equivalent coverage. A person in the 28% Tax bracket would need to earn $1,389 in gross income to pay the annual premium. Since that amount no longer needs to be paid annually, the tax-adjusted, equivalent rate of return to the insured homeowner on the single deposit premium would be $1,389, less the after-tax returns that would have been earned on investing the deposit premium (or $600, assuming a 6% after-tax rate of return) divided by $10,000, in other words, 7.89%.

With a total area of 1,207 square kilometers Lifou is located east of Australia at . Background First discovered by the Frenchman Dumont d‚ÄôUrville in 1857, it was soon visited by whalers and traders, and became a destination for Protestant and Catholic Missionaries out to save the local populations' souls. In 1864 the islands were annexed by France who in turn established it as an Aboriginal Reserve as it was not believed suitable for extensive colonialization. Administration The island is part of the commune (municipality) of Lifou, in the Loyalty Islands Province of New Caledonia. The administrative center of the commune is located at W√©, on the east side of Lifou Island at Chateaubriand Bay. The local currency is the CFP Franc (French Pacific Franc). Geography Lifou from space, November 1990 Irregular in shape, Lifou Island is long and 16 to 24 km (10 to 15 miles) wide. The island is flat with no hills or rivers, but has abundant vegetation, dense interior jungles, fertile soils, terraced cliffs and breath taking reefs and corals. Lifou Island is a former coral atoll that was part of a submerged volcano. Nearly 2 million years ago, the island was uplifted to its present shape and elevation, today it sits at a mere 60m above sea level at its highest point. Since there are no rivers on Lifou, the water comes from rain that seeps through the calcareous soil and forms freshwater ponds. Food With its rich Pacific waters fish including crab, lobster, turtle are in abundance, along with typical raised animals such as goat, pig and chicken. Crops include coconut, banana, taro, sweet potato, yam and vanilla. While the French introduction of coffee stayed on. Economy Tourism is a major industry on the island. Chief exports include copra, rubber, vanilla and sugarcane. Culture The term Kanak is used for natives of the islands and their native language of the island is Drehu, with people descending from Melanesians and Polynesians. With a total of 19 different tribes inhabiting the three Loyalty Islands, six of which are on Lifou. The current traditional high chief of the island is Evanes Boula, who is chief of 13 of the three islands tribes, succeeding Henri Boula on 13 June 1999.

It is generally characterised by sparse, syncopated rhythmic patterns with prominent sub-bass frequencies. The style emerged as an offshoot of UK garage, drawing on a lineage of related styles such as 2-step and dub reggae, as well as jungle, broken beat, and grime.AllMusic - Dubstep \\"Absorbed and transfigured elements of techno, drum'n' bass and dub\\"Reynolds, S.(2012),Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture, Perseus Books; Reprint edition (5 Jan 2012), pages 511‚Äì516, (). In the United Kingdom, the origins of the genre can be traced back to the growth of the Jamaican sound system party scene in the early 1980s.The Big Big Sound System Splashdown , New Musical Express, 21 February 1981, . The earliest dubstep releases date back to 1998. In 2001, this sound and other strains of garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the \\"Forward\\" night (sometimes stylised as FWD>>), and on the pirate radio station Rinse FM, which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term \\"dubstep\\" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition, and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in these remixes became more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and grime.IMO Records \\"Hatcha Biography\\" , IMO Records, London, 17 October 2011. Retrieved 22 November 2011. A very early supporter of the sound was BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who started playing it from 2003 onwards. In 2004, the last year of his show, his listeners voted Distance, Digital Mystikz, and Plastician in their top 50 for the year. Dubstep started to enter mainstream British popular culture when it spread beyond small local scenes in late 2005 and early 2006; many websites devoted to the genre appeared on the Internet and aided the growth of the scene, such as dubstepforum, the download site Barefiles and blogs such as gutterbreakz. Simultaneously, the genre was receiving extensive coverage in music magazines such as The Wire and online publications such as Pitchfork, with a regular feature entitled The Month In: Grime/Dubstep. Interest in dubstep grew significantly after BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs started championing the genre, beginning with a show devoted to it (entitled \\"Dubstep Warz\\") in January 2006. Towards the end of the 2000s and into the early 2010s, the genre started to become more commercially successful in the UK, with more singles and remixes entering the music charts. Music journalists and critics also noticed a dubstep influence in several pop artists' work. Around this time, producers also began to fuse elements of the original dubstep sound with other influences, creating fusion genres including future garage and the slower and more experimental post-dubstep. The harsher electro-house and heavy metal- influenced variant brostep, led by American producers such as Skrillex, greatly contributed to dubstep's popularity in the United States.  Characteristics  The music website Allmusic has described dubstep's overall sound as \\"tightly coiled productions with overwhelming bass lines and reverberant drum patterns, clipped samples, and occasional vocals.\\" According to Simon Reynolds, dubstep's constituents originally came from \\"different points in the 1989‚Äî99 UK lineage: bleep 'n' bass, jungle, techstep, Photek- style neurofunk, speed garage, [and] 2 step.\\" Reynolds comments that the traces of pre-existing styles \\"worked through their intrinsic sonic effects but also as signifiers, tokenings-back addressed to those who know\\". Dubstep's early roots are in the more experimental releases of UK garage producers, seeking to incorporate elements of drum and bass into the 2-step garage sound. These experiments often ended up on the B-side of a white label or commercial garage release. Dubstep is generally instrumental. Similar to a vocal garage hybrid ‚Äì grime ‚Äì the genre's feel is commonly dark; tracks frequently use a minor key or the Phrygian mode, and can feature dissonant harmonies such as the tritone interval within a riff. Compared to other styles of garage music, dubstep tends to be more minimalistic, focusing on prominent sub-bass frequencies. Some dubstep artists have also incorporated a variety of outside influences, from dub-influenced techno such as Basic Channel to classical music or heavy metal. = Rhythm = Dubstep rhythms are usually syncopated, and often shuffled or incorporating tuplets. The tempo is nearly always in the range of 138‚Äì142 beats per minute, with a clap or snare usually inserted every third beat in a bar. In its early stages, dubstep was often more percussive, with more influences from two‚Äëstep drum patterns. Many producers were also experimenting with tribal drum samples, such as Loefah's early release \\"Truly Dread\\" and Mala's \\"Anti-War Dub\\". In an Invisible Jukebox interview with The Wire, Kode9 commented on a MRK1 track, observing that listeners \\"have internalized the double-time rhythm\\" and the \\"track is so empty it makes [the listener] nervous, and you almost fill in the double time yourself, physically, to compensate\\". = Wobble bass = One characteristic of certain strands of dubstep is the wobble bass, often referred to as the \\"wub\\", where an extended bass note is manipulated rhythmically. This style of bass is typically produced by using a low-frequency oscillator to manipulate certain parameters of a synthesiser such as volume, distortion or filter cutoff. The resulting sound is a timbre that is punctuated by rhythmic variations in volume, filter cutoff, or distortion. This style of bass is a driving factor in some variations of dubstep, particularly at the more club-friendly end of the spectrum. Wobble bass has been nick named, Wobble-step. = Structure, bass drops, rewinds, and MCs = Originally, dubstep releases had some structural similarities to other genres like drum and bass and UK garage. Typically this would comprise an intro, a main section (often incorporating a bass drop), a midsection, a second main section similar to the first (often with another drop), and an outro. Many early dubstep tracks incorporate one or more \\"bass drops\\", a characteristic inherited from drum and bass. Typically, the percussion will pause, often reducing the track to silence, and then resume with more intensity, accompanied by a dominant sub-bass (often passing portamento through an entire octave or more, as in the audio example). It is very common for the bass to drop at or very close to 55 seconds into the song, because 55 seconds is just over 32 measures at the common tempo of 140 bpm. However, this (or the existence of a bass drop in general) is by no means a completely rigid characteristic, rather a trope; a large portion of seminal tunes from producers like Kode9 and Horsepower Productions have more experimental song structures which do not rely on a drop for a dynamic peak ‚Äì and in some instances do not feature a bass drop at all. Rewinds (or reloads) are another technique used by dubstep DJs. If a song seems to be especially popular, the DJ will \\"spin back\\" the record by hand without lifting the stylus, and play the track in question again. Rewinds are also an important live element in many of dubstep's precursors; the technique originates in dub reggae soundsystems, is widely employed by pirate radio stations and is also used at UK garage and jungle nights. Taking direct cues from Jamaica's lyrically sparse deejay and toasting mic styles in the vein of reggae pioneers like U-Roy, the MC's role in dubstep's live experience is critically important to its impact. Notable mainstays in the live experience of the sound are MC Sgt Pokes and MC Crazy D from London, and Juakali from Trinidad. Production in a studio environment seems to lend itself to more experimentation. Kode9 has collaborated extensively with the Spaceape, who MCs in a dread poet style. Kevin Martin's experiments with the genre are almost exclusively collaborations with MCs such as Warrior Queen, Flowdan, and Tippa Irie. Skream has also featured Warrior Queen and grime artist JME on his debut album, Skream!. Plastician, who was one of the first DJ's to mix the sound of grime and dubstep together, has worked with notable grime setup Boy Better Know as well as renowned Grime MC's such as Wiley, Dizzee Rascal and Lethal Bizzle. He has also released tracks with a dubstep foundation and grime verses over the beats. Dubstep artist and label co-owner Sam Shackleton has moved toward productions which fall outside the usual dubstep tempo, and sometimes entirely lack most of the common tropes of the genre.  History  = 1999‚Äì2002: origins = The Big Apple Records shop, in Croydon, South London. The early sounds of proto-dubstep originally came out of productions during 1999‚Äì2000 by producers such as Oris Jay, El-B, Steve Gurley and Zed Bias. Ammunition Promotions, who run the influential club night Forward>> and have managed many proto-dubstep record labels (including Tempa, Soulja, Road, Vehicle, Shelflife, Texture, Lifestyle and Bingo), began to use the term \\"dubstep\\" to describe this style of music in around 2002. The term's use in a 2002 XLR8R cover story (featuring Horsepower Productions on the cover) contributed to it becoming established as the name of the genre. Forward>> was originally held at the Velvet Rooms in London's Soho and later moved to Plastic People in Shoreditch, east London. Founded in 2001, Forward>> was critical to the development of dubstep, providing the first venue devoted to the sound and an environment in which dubstep producers could premier new music. Around this time, Forward>> was also incubating several other strains of dark garage hybrids, so much so that in the early days of the club the coming together of these strains was referred to as the \\"Forward>> sound\\". An online flyer from around this time encapsulated the Forward>> sound as \\"b-lines to make your chest cavity shudder.\\" Forward>> also ran a radio show on east London pirate station Rinse FM, hosted by Kode9. The original Forward>> line ups included Hatcha, Youngsta, Kode 9, Zed Bias, Oris Jay, Slaughter Mob, Jay Da Flex, DJ Slimzee, and others, plus regular guests. The line up of residents has changed over the years to include Youngsta, Hatcha, Geeneus, and Plastician, with Crazy D as MC/host. Producers including D1, Skream and Benga make regular appearances.Mala of Digital Mystikz, one of the pioneers of dubstep music.Another crucial element in the early development of dubstep was the Big Apple Records record shop in Croydon. Key artists such as Hatcha and later Skream worked in the shop (which initially sold early UK Hardcore / Rave, Techno and House and later, garage and drum and bass, but evolved with the emerging dubstep scene in the area), while Digital Mystikz were frequent visitors. El-B, Zed Bias, Horsepower Productions, Plastician, N Type, Walsh and a young Loefah regularly visited the shop as well. The shop and its record label have since closed. = 2002‚Äì05: evolution = Dubstep producer Skream, one of the most widely known names on the scene since the beginning of the Dubstep movement. All throughout 2003, DJ Hatcha pioneered a new direction for dubstep on Rinse FM and through his sets at Forward>>. Playing sets cut to 10\\" one-off reggae-style dubplates, he drew exclusively from a pool of new South London producers‚Äîfirst Benga and Skream, then also Digital Mystikz and Loefah‚Äîto begin a dark, clipped and minimal new direction in dubstep. At the end of 2003, running independently from the pioneering FWD night, an event called Filthy Dub, co promoted by Plastician, and partner David Carlisle started happening regularly. It was there that Skream, Benga, N Type, Walsh, Chef, Loefah, and Cyrus made their debuts as DJs. South London collective Digital Mystikz (Mala and Coki), along with labelmates and collaborators Loefah and MC Sgt Pokes soon came into their own, bringing sound system thinking, dub values, and appreciation of jungle bass weight to the dubstep scene. Digital Mystikz brought an expanded palette of sounds and influences to the genre, most prominently reggae and dub, as well as orchestral melodies. After releasing 12-inch singles on Big Apple, they founded DMZ Records, which has released fourteen 12\\"s to date. They also began their night DMZ, held every two months in Brixton, a part of London already strongly associated with reggae. DMZ has showcased new dubstep artists such as Skream, Kode 9, Benga, Pinch, DJ Youngsta, Hijak, Joe Nice, and Vex'd. DMZ's first anniversary event (at the Mass venue, a converted church) saw fans attending from places as far away as Sweden, the United States, and Australia, leading to a queue of 600 people at the event. This forced the club to move from its regular 400-capacity space to Mass' main room, an event cited as a pivotal moment in dubstep's history. Later Mala would also found the influential label Deep Medi Musik. In 2004, Richard James' label, Rephlex, released two compilations that included dubstep tracks ‚Äì the (perhaps misnamed) Grime and Grime 2\\\\. The first featured Plasticman, Mark One and Slaughter Mob, with Kode 9, Loefah, and Digital Mystikz appearing on the second. These compilations helped to raise awareness of dubstep at a time when the grime sound was drawing more attention, and Digital Mystikz and Loefah's presence on the second release contributed to the success of their DMZ club night. Soon afterwards, the Independent on Sunday commented on \\"a whole new sound\\", at a time when both genres were becoming popular, stating that \\"grime\\" and \\"dubstep\\" were two names for the same style, which was also known as \\"sublow\\", \\"8-bar\\", and \\"eskibeat\\". = 2005‚Äì08: growth = Dubstep Section at Black Market Records, Soho, London. In the summer of 2005, Forward>> brought grime DJs to the fore of the line up. Building on the success of Skream's grimey anthem \\"Midnight Request Line\\", the hype around the DMZ night and support from online forums (notably dubstepforum.com) and media, the scene gained prominence after former Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs gathered top figures from the scene for one show, entitled \\"Dubstep Warz\\", (later releasing the compilation album Warrior Dubz). The show created a new global audience for the scene, after years of exclusively UK underground buzz. Burial's self-titled album appearing in many critics' \\"Best of ...\\" lists for the year, notably The Wire's Best Album of 2006. The sound was also featured prominently in the soundtrack for the 2006 sci-fi film Children of Men, which included Digital Mystikz, Random Trio, Kode 9, Pressure and DJ Pinch. Ammunition also released the first retrospective compilation of the 2000‚Äì2004 era of dubstep called The Roots of Dubstep, co- compiled by Ammunition and Blackdown on the Tempa Label. The sound's first North American ambassador, Baltimore DJ Joe Nice helped kickstart its spread into the continent. Regular Dubstep club nights started appearing in cities like New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Montreal, Houston, and Denver, while Mary Anne Hobbs curated a Dubstep showcase at 2007's S√≥nar festival in Barcelona. Non-British artists have also won praise within the larger Dubstep community. The dynamic dubstep scene in Japan is growing quickly despite its cultural and geographical distance from the West. Such DJ/producers as Goth- Trad, Hyaku-mado, Ena and Doppelganger are major figures in the Tokyo scene. Joe Nice has played at DMZ, while the fifth instalment of Tempa's \\"Dubstep Allstars\\" mix series (released in 2007) included tracks by Finnish producer Tes La Rok and Americans JuJu and Matty G. BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs. Techno artists and DJs began assimilating dubstep into their sets and productions. Shackleton's \\"Blood on My Hands\\" was remixed by minimal techno producer Ricardo Villalobos (an act reciprocated when Villalobos included a Shackleton mix on his \\"Vasco\\" EP) and included on a mix CD by Panoramabar resident Cassy. Ellen Allien and Apparat's 2006 song \\"Metric\\" (from the Orchestra of Bubbles album), Modeselektor's \\"Godspeed\\" (from the 2007's Happy Birthday! album, among other tracks on that same album) and Roman Flugel's remix of Riton's \\"Hammer of Thor\\" are other examples of dubstep-influenced techno. Berlin's Hard Wax record store (operated by influential dub techno artists Basic Channel) has also championed Shackleton's Skull Disco label, later broadening its focus to include other dubstep releases. The summer of 2007 saw dubstep's musical palette expand further, with Benga and Coki scoring a crossover hit (in a similar manner to Skream's \\"Midnight Request Line\\") with the track \\"Night\\", which gained widespread play from DJs in a diverse range of genres. BBC Radio 1 DJ Gilles Peterson named it his record of 2007, and it was also a massive hit in the equally bassline-orientated, but decidedly more four-to-the-floor genre of bassline house, whilst Burial's late 2007 release Untrue (which was nominated for the 2008 Nationwide Mercury Music Prize in the UK) incorporated extensive use of heavily manipulated, mostly female, 'girl next door' vocal samples. Burial has spoken at length regarding his intent to reincorporate elements of musical precursors such as 2-step garage and house into his sound. Much like drum and bass before it, dubstep started to become incorporated into other media. In 2007, Benga, Skream, and other dubstep producers provided the soundtrack to much of the second series of Dubplate Drama, which aired on Channel 4 with a soundtrack CD later released on Rinse Recordings. A track by Skream also featured in the second series of the teen drama Skins, which also aired on Channel 4 in early 2008.Q&A; with Kyle Lynd - How to get your music on Skins , BBC Introducing blog, 10-Feb-2010 In the summer of 2008, Mary Anne Hobbs invited Cyrus, Starkey, Oneman, DJ Chef, Silkie, Quest, Joker, Nomad, Kulture and MC Sgt Pokes to the BBC's Maida Vale studios for a show called Generation Bass. The show was the evolution from her seminal BBC Radio 1 Dubstepwarz Show in 2006, and further documented another set of dubstep's producers. Silkie and Quest, along with Kromestar and Heny G would all come through the Anti-Social Entertainment crew, with a show on Rinse FM and later Flex FM. As the genre has spread to become an international rather than UK-centric scene, it has also seen a number of women making headway into the scene in a variety of ways. Alongside Soulja of Ammunition Promotions and Mary Anne Hobbs, an influx of female producers, writers, photographers and DJs all have broken through in the up-til-then male orientated scene. With key 12\\" releases on Hyperdub, Immigrant and Hotflush Recordings, producers Vaccine, Subeena and Ikonika have introduced a palette of new sounds and influences to the genre, such as double-time bass drums, 8-bit video game samples, hand percussion and lushly arranged strings. Mary Anne Hobbs commented that, unlike \\"Grime and drum 'n' bass raves, the mood at dubstep nights is less aggressive, or more meditative, leading to a larger female attendance at events than with the genre's precursors. You see the female-to-male ratio constantly going up ‚Äì it's got the potential to be 40:60\\". = 2009‚Äì2014: Mainstream popularity = Borgore performing for crowds on 7 July 2011 at the 10th Anniversary Camp Bisco Music Festival in Mariaville Lake, New York. The influence of dubstep on more commercial or popular genres can be identified as far back as 2007, with artists such as Britney Spears using dubstep sounds; critics observed a dubstep influence in the song \\"Freakshow\\", from the 2007 album Blackout, which Tom Ewing described as \\"built around the 'wobbler' effect that's a genre standby.\\" Benga and Coki's single \\"Night\\" still continued to be a popular track on the UK dance chart more than a year after its release in late 2007, still ranking in the top five at the start of April 2008 on Pete Tong's BBC Radio 1 dance chart list. However, the year 2009 saw the dubstep sound gaining further worldwide recognition, often through the assimilation of elements of the sound into other genres, in a manner similar to drum and bass before it. At the start of the year, UK electronic duo La Roux put their single \\"In for the Kill\\" in the remix hands of Skream. They then gave remix duties of \\"I'm Not Your Toy\\" to Nero and then again with their single \\"Bulletproof\\" being remixed by Zinc. The same year, London producer Silkie released an influential album, City Limits Vol. 1, on the Deep Medi Musik label, using 1970s funk and soul reference points, a departure from the familiar strains of dub and UK garage. The sound also continued to interest the mainstream press with key articles in magazines like Interview, New York, and The Wire, which featured producer Kode9 on its May 2009 cover. XLR8R put Joker on the cover of its December 2009 issue. In April 2009, UKF Dubstep, a YouTube channel brand was founded by Luke Hood which introduced Dubstep to many young generations internationally at the time. UKF Dubstep has exploded in popularity as the music genre has hit the mainstream. In November 2010 the channel had 100,000 subscribers, and as of November 2019 has over one million. \\"UKF features established and up and coming producers from around the world, featuring artists from Flux Pavilion / Knife Party to Friction / Hybrid Minds. We‚Äôre sent a huge amount of music so it‚Äôs our job to pick the best to upload on the channel for our audience to listen to. In just over 3 years our channels now have more than 2m subscribers and 4 channels ‚Äì UKF Dubstep, Drum & Bass, Music and Mixes. The audience is getting more and more International and younger.\\" Luke said on the interview with SoSoActive. In a move foreshadowed by endorsements of the sound from R&B;, hip-hop and recently, mainstream figures such as Rihanna, or The Bomb Squad's Hank Shocklee, Snoop Dogg collaborated with dubstep producers Chase & Status, providing a vocal for their \\"underground anthem\\", \\"Eastern Jam\\". The 2011 Britney Spears track \\"Hold It Against Me\\" was also responsible for promoting dubstep tropes within pop music. Rihanna's Rated R album released such content the very year dubstep saw a spike, containing three dubstep tracks. Such events propelled the genre into the biggest radio markets overnight, with considerable airplay. Other hip-hop artists like Xzibit added their vocals to dubstep instrumental tracks for the mixtape project Mr Grustle & Tha Russian Dubstep LA Embrace The Renaissance Vol. 1 Mixed by Plastician. In summer 2009, rapper and actress Eve used Benga's \\"E Trips\\"; adding her own verses over the beat to create a new tune called \\"Me N My\\"; the first single on her album Flirt. The track was co-produced by Benga and hip hop producer Salaam Remi. Throughout 2010, the presence of dubstep in the pop charts was notable, with \\"I Need Air\\" by Magnetic Man reaching number 10 in the UK singles chart. This presented a turning point in the popularity of mainstream dubstep amongst UK listeners as it was placed on rotation on BBC Radio 1.Magnetic Man ‚Äì 'I Need Air' BBC ‚Äì Chart Blog \\"Katy On a Mission\\" by Katy B (produced by Benga) followed, debuting at number 5 in the UK singles chart, and stayed in the top 10 for five more weeks.UK Charts: Week Ending 04-September‚Äì2010 Also in 2010, American producer Skrillex achieved moderate commercial success in North America with a dubstep-influenced sound. By 2011 his EP Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites had peaked at number three on the U.S.Billboard Dance/Electronic album charts. In February 2011, Chase & Status's second album No More Idols reached No. 2 in the UK album chart. On 1 May 2011, Nero's third single \\"Guilt\\" from their album reached number 8 in the Official UK Singles Chart.UK Charts: Week Ending 07-May‚Äì2011 DJ Fresh and Nero both had number one singles in 2011 with \\"Louder\\" and \\"Promises\\". Strong baselines imported from dubstep continued in popular music with the Taylor Swift song \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\", which made number 1 on Billboard's U.S. Mainstream Top 40 chart. 2011: Post-dubstep  James Blake performing at Glastonbury Festival, June 2011 In early 2011, the term \\"post-dubstep\\" (sometimes known as \\"UK bass\\" or simply \\"bass music\\") was used to describe club music that was influenced by certain aspects of dubstep. Such music often references earlier dubstep productions as well as UK garage, 2-step and other forms of underground electronic dance music. Artists producing music described as post- dubstep have also incorporated elements of ambient music and early R&B.; The latter in particular is heavily sampled by three artists described as post- dubstep: Mount Kimbie, Fantastic Mr Fox and James Blake. The tempo of music typically characterised as post-dubstep is approximately 130 beats per minute. The breadth of styles that have come to be associated with the term post- dubstep preclude it from being a specific musical genre. Pitchfork writer Martin Clark has suggested that \\"well-meaning attempts to loosely define the ground we're covering here are somewhat futile and almost certainly flawed. This is not one genre. However, given the links, interaction, and free-flowing ideas ... you can't dismiss all these acts as unrelated\\" The production duo Mount Kimbie is often associated with the origination of the term post- dubstep. English music producer Jamie xx released remixes which are considered post-dubstep, including We're New Here (2011), a Gil Scott-Heron remix album.  2011: Brostep and American developments  Skrillex performing in 2012 In 2011, dubstep gained significant traction in the US market, by way of a post-dubstep style known as brostep, with the American producer Skrillex becoming something of a \\"poster boy\\" for the scene. In September 2011, a Spin Magazine EDM special referred to brostep as a \\"lurching and aggressive\\" variant of dubstep that has proven commercially successful in the United States.Dubstep 101: A U.S. Primer Andrew Gaerig, 12 September, Spin Magazine, Spin Media LLC. Unlike traditional dubstep production styles, which emphasise sub-bass content, brostep accentuates the middle register and features \\"robotic fluctuations and metal-esque aggression\\". According to Simon Reynolds, as dubstep gained larger audiences and moved from smaller club-based venues to larger outdoor events, sub-sonic content was gradually replaced by distorted bass riffs that function roughly in the same register as the electric guitar in heavy metal.Simon Reynolds, The Art of the Groove, in Computer Music, Computer Music Specials (p. 9), Wed 26 October 2011, Future Publishing Limited The term brostep has been used by some as a pejorative descriptor for a style of popular Americanised dubstep. The producer known as Rusko himself claimed in an interview on BBC Radio 1Xtra that \\"brostep is sort of my fault, but now I've started to hate it in a way ... It's like someone screaming in your face ... you don't want that.\\" According to a BBC review of his 2012 album Songs, the record was a muddled attempt by Rusko to realign his music with a \\"Jamaican inheritance\\" and distance it from the \\"belching, aggressive, resolutely macho\\" dubstep produced by his contemporaries.Mellisa Bradshaw,\\"Dubstep producer tries aligning his output with Jamaican originals, with muddled results.\\" BBC, March 2012. Commenting on the success of American producers such as Skrillex, Skream stated: \\"I think it hurts a lot of people over here because it's a UK sound, but it's been someone with influences outside the original sound that has made it a lot bigger. The bad side of that is that a lot of people will just say 'dubstep equals Skrillex'. But in all honesty it genuinely doesn't bother me. I like the music he makes.\\"I Like The Music Skrillex Makes': An Interview With Skream, The Quietus, 19 December 2011, TheQuietus.com Other North American artists that were initially associated with the brostep sound were Canadian producers Datsik and Excision. Their production style has been described by Mixmag as \\"a viciously harsh, yet brilliantly produced sound that appealed more to Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails fans than it did to lovers of UK garage\\". The brostep sound also attracted the attention of metal bands. Nu metal band Korn's 2011 album The Path of Totality features several collaborations with electronic music producers, including Skrillex and Excision.  2012‚Äì2013: Riddim  In the early 2010s, UK artists began to play with a style of dubstep reminiscent of a resurgence or continuation of original British dubstep styles. This became known as Riddim, a name coined by British producer Jakes around 2012. The name comes from the Jamaican Patois term riddim, which refers to the instrumental of dub, reggae and dancehall music. Riddim is characterised by repetitive and minimalist sub-bass and triplet percussion arrangements, similar to original dubstep, with a sound described as \\"wonky\\". Riddim is looked upon as a subgenre of dubstep, similarly to other sub genres like bro-step, drum-step, and wobble-step. It started gaining significant popularity around 2015. It is said that those who enjoy this style of music describe it as the \\"dirtier, swaggier\\" side of dubstep, whereas those looking at this from the outside, claim that it is \\"repetitive and chaotic\\". Notable artists of the genre include Subfiltronik, Bukez Finezt, P0gman, Badklaat, 50 Carrot, Dubloadz and Coffi. Notable tracks of the genre include \\"Yasuo\\" by Bommer and Crowell, \\"Orgalorg\\" by Infekt, and \\"Jotaro\\" by Phiso. There have been controversial discussions over the topic of Riddim not being its own genre and that it is just dubstep. Riddim producer Oolacile states \\"A lot of people who have been around a lot longer have a different idea of what riddim is. Older fans consider riddim to be the swampy, repetitive sound, and newer fans will associate riddim with the sound of the underground.\\" = 2014‚Äìpresent: Decline in mainstream popularity = Beginning in mid-2014, dubstep began to decline drastically in mainstream popularity, particularly in the United States, where many formerly successful dubstep artists became popular. Artists such as Skrillex, for instance, moved on to producing tracks for trap and pop artists, while artists such as Mount Kimbie and James Blake shifted their sounds from post-dubstep into more experimental or soulful electronic influenced music. Early influencers and pioneers of dubstep such as Skream and Loefah moved away from the genre, moving onto other genres instead. Loefah stopped playing and producing dubstep and moved onto UK bass, founding his record label Swamp81 in the process. Skream shifted away from dubstep, choosing to instead produce and play house and techno music in his DJ sets and releasing various techno songs on Alan Fitzpatrick's record label We Are The Brave.

He was a famous rabbi, Torah and Talmud commentator and a poet.  Biography  Zerachiah was born into a Rabbinic family called Yitzhari of Girona. His father was Isaac Ha-Levi, a Talmudic scholar in Provence, and the son of Zerachiah Ha-Levi, his namesake. The elder Zerachiah was a son of Shem Tov Ha- Levi, one of the greatest Talmudic scholars in Provence, who claimed direct descent of the prophet Samuel, who according to Jewish tradition was a direct descendant of Yitzhar (hence the family name \\"Ha-Yitzhari\\"), son of Kehath, son of Levi, son of Jacob. In his youth, Zerachiah moved to Provence and studied with the Talmudic scholars of Narbonne (one of them was the famous Moshe ben Yosef). At the age of 19 he wrote a piyyut in Aramaic and devoted himself to halakhic problems. For many years thereafter he lived in Lunel (studying with Meshullam of Lunel), but the conflicts, disputes and quarrels constantly splitting the community forced him to leave. Zerachiah was not only a thorough Talmudist of great erudition, with an analytic and synthetic mind, but he was also deeply versed in Arabic literature, in philosophy, and in astronomy, and was, also, a gifted poet, combining elegance of style with elevation of sentiment. Judah Ben Saul Ibn Tibbon said of Zerachiah: \\"he was unique in his generation and wiser than I\\", and praised him for his elaborate style of writing. Jehudah Ibn Tibbon sent his son Samuel ibn Tibbon to study with Zerachiah. Works = Sefer Ha-Maor = Zerachiah knew Arabic well and quickly absorbed the disciplines studied in Provence, but from his writings one could easily feel the tension that existed between him and his surroundings. Fame of a scholar and expert on halakhic problems came to him thanks to his book Sefer Ha-Maor which was begun when he was 19 years old, and was completed in the 1180s. The book is divided into two parts: Ha-Maor Ha- Gadol (the great light) and Ha-Maor Ha-Katan (the small light). In the first part the issues connected to Talmudic tractates \\"Berachot\\", \\"Mo'ed\\" and \\"Chullin\\" are discussed, and in the second part - \\"Nashim\\" and \\"Nezikin\\". In this book the ReZaH consistently and critically objects to the Rif's views, but at the same time holds him and his works in high esteem. Aware of the fact that he was much younger than the \\"Rif\\" whose Halachic decisions were accepted throughout Spain, and his authority was undisputed he vindicates himself, in his prologue, by bringing examples of other young scholars who differed with acknowledged sages, such as Ibn Janach. He is most apologetic in criticizing this giant of Halacha, and justifies himself by saying that his insights serve only to enhance this indispensable code. In a comic and poetic style he writes about himself, \\"Do not classify this youth as an empty barrel, for ofttimes aged wine may be found in a new vessel\\". His father wrote a poem about him as well, praising him and blessing his creator for giving him such a gifted prodigy.The Rishonim, The Artscroll history series, Pg. 163-164 These writings belong to a special kind of Rabbinical literature - so-called \\"objections\\" raised by the scholars of Provence against attempts by the scholars from \\"Eretz Islam\\" to force the adoption of their halakhot and commentaries. From this point of view, Zerachiah stands together with Abraham ben David of Posquieres, known because of his objections to Maimonides, though even between them there was sufficient difference of opinion. Zerachiah, in many cases, prefers the variants of commentaries supplemented by Rashi, and, to a great extent, he relies upon the methods of the scholars of France in commentaries on Gemara. From this point of view, the works of Zerachiah reflect a mingling of the school of halakha and the drasha of the scholars of Spain and France not uncommon in Provence. Zerachiah's independence also displeased the conservatives, however, and refutations of his criticisms were written by Nahmanides under the title Mil·∏•amot hashem, (lit. Wars of God) and by Abraham ben David of Posqui√®res, who alluded in his harsh fashion to Zerahiah as an immature youth who had had the audacity to criticize his master, and even accused him of having appropriated some of his (Abraham's) own interpretations without mentioning the author. A justification of Zerahiah's critique was written by Ezra Malki under the title Shemen la-Ma'or, and since 1552 the Sefer ha-Ma'or has always been printed together with Alfasi. = Sefer Ha- Tsava = Additionally, Zerachiah wrote the book Sefer Ha-Tsava, which explained 13 principles of drasha used in Gemarah and composed various halakhoth related to shechita and Niddah, etc. At the same time endeavored to show that Alfasi had not observed the principles laid down in the Talmud for halakic interpretation. This work, like its predecessor, was criticized by Na·∏•manides, who justified Alfasi. Major differences in opinion also emerged between Zerachiah and the Ravad III who wrote objections to the Sefer Ha-Maor. Zerachiah replied in kind, writing objections to the Ravad's work Baalei Ha- Nefesh which were full of sarcasm and personal attacks. Both the Sefer Ha- Tsava and the criticism of Na·∏•manides were inserted in the Sefer Temim De'im (¬ß¬ß 225, 226, Venice, 1622), and were also published separately at Shklov in 1803. = Other Works = Zerachya was likewise the author of the following works: Hilkot She·∏•i·π≠ah u-Bedi·∏≥ah, mentioned in the Sefer ha-Ma'or at the end of the first chapter on the treatise ·∏§ullin; Hassagot 'al Ba'ale ha-Nefesh, a critique of RABaD's treatise on the laws relating to women, published in part with the Ba'ale ha-Nefesh (Venice, 1741; Berlin, 1762); Dibre Ribot, a controversy with RABaD on civil jurisprudence, mentioned in the Sefer ha-Ma'or on Baba Me·∫ìi'a and cited in part by Bezaleel Ashkenazi in his Shi·π≠·π≠ah Me·∏≥ubbe·∫ìet on Baba Me·∫ìi'a, p. 98a; Sela' ha-Ma·∏•alo·∏≥ot, mentioned in the Sefer ha-Ma'or at the end of the first chapter of Shebu'ot; Pit·∏•e Niddah, quoted by the author's grandson in his Bede·∏≥ ha-Bayit (vii. 3); a dissertation on the Mishnah Kinnim, published at Constantinople in 1795; and responsa, mentioned in the \\"Sefer ha-Ma'or\\" at the end of the second chapter of Gi·π≠·π≠in and quoted in the Sefer ha-Terumot (xlv. 1). Zerachya was the author of numerous liturgical poems, eighteen of which are found in the Sephardic Ma·∏•zor. His poetry is included in various liturgical rites and was published in a critical edition by B. Bar-Tikva.  Legacy  Zerachia Halevi influenced greatly the following generations of rabbis and scholars, and some of them wrote responsa in his defense, among them Nahmanides, who previously had been his irreconcilable critic. Even Ravad, who outlived his friend and rival by 13 years, softened his tone after Zerachiah's death and wrote about him with great respect, criticizing him only on the substance of issues under consideration.

Generally associated with neopatrimonial states, where there is a framework of formal law and administration but the state is informally captured by patronage networks. The distribution of the spoils of office takes precedence over the formal functions of the state, severely limiting the ability of public officials to make policies in the general interest. While neopatrimonialism may be considered the norm where a modern state is constructed in a preindustrial context, however, the African variants often result in bigmanism in the form of a strongly presidentialist political system.Booth, David; Cammack, Diana; Harrigan, Jane; Kanyongolo, Edge; Mataure, Mike and Ngwira, Naomi (2006) Drivers of Change and Development in Malawi.

He remained in office for 31¬Ω years. While in office, he formed a regime in Zaire that attempted to purge the country of all colonial cultural influence and entered wars to challenge the rise of communism in other African countries. His mismanagement of his country's economy, and personal enrichment from its financial and natural resources, makes his name synonymous with kleptocracy in Africa. *Fran√ßois Duvalier ‚Äì President of Haiti from 1957 to 1971. In 1964 he made himself President for Life. He ruled until his death in 1971, in a regime marked by autocracy, corruption and state-sponsored terrorism through his private militia known as Tonton Macoutes. It has been estimated that he was responsible for 30,000 dead and exile of thousands more. *Saparmurat Niyazov ‚Äì President of Turkmenistan from 1990 until his death in 2006. Foreign media criticized him as one of the world's most totalitarian and repressive dictators, highlighting his reputation of imposing his personal eccentricities upon the country, which extended to renaming months after members of his family. *Saddam Hussein ‚Äì President of Iraq from 1979 to 2003. As president, Saddam maintained power during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War (1980‚Äì1988) and the first Persian Gulf War (1991). During these conflicts, Saddam repressed several movements, particularly Shi'a and Kurdish movements seeking to overthrow the government or gain independence, respectively. Whereas some Arabs looked upon him as a hero for his aggressive stance against foreign intervention and for his support for the Palestinians, many Arabs and western leaders vilified him for murdering scores of Kurdish people of the north and his invasion of Kuwait. Saddam was deposed by the U.S. and its allies during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. *Suharto ‚Äì President of Indonesia from 1967 to 1998. The legacy of Suharto's 32-year rule is debated both in Indonesia and abroad. Under his \\"New Order\\" administration, Suharto constructed a strong, centralized and military- dominated government. An ability to maintain stability over a sprawling and diverse Indonesia and an avowedly anti-Communist stance won him the economic and diplomatic support of the West during the Cold War. For most of his presidency, Indonesia experienced significant economic growth and industrialization. Against the backdrop of Cold War international relations, Suharto's \\"New Order\\" invasion of East Timor, and the subsequent 24-year occupation, resulted in an estimated minimum of 102,800 deaths. A detailed statistical report prepared for the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor. By the 1990s, the New Order's authoritarianism and widespread corruption--estimates of government funds missappropriated by the Suharto family range from US$1.5 billion and US$35 billion was a source of much discontent, and was referred as one of the world's most corrupt leaders. Suharto tops corruption rankings. In the years since his presidency, attempts to try him on charges of corruption and genocide failed because of his poor health. *Nicolae Ceau≈üescu was the General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party from 1965 until 1989, President of the Council of State from 1967 and President of Romania from 1974 until 1989. His rule was marked in the first decade by an open policy towards Western Europe and the United States of America, which deviated from that of the other Warsaw Pact states during the Cold War. He continued a trend first established by his predecessor, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, who had tactfully coaxed the Khrushchev regime to withdraw troops from Romania in 1958.Johanna Granville, \\"Dej-a-Vu: Early Roots of Romania's Independence,\\" East European Quarterly, vol. XLII, no. 4 (Winter 2008), pp. 365-404. Ceau≈üescu's second decade was characterized by an increasingly erratic personality cult, extreme nationalism and a deterioration in foreign relations with Western powers and also with the Soviet Union. Ceau≈üescu's government was overthrown in December 1989, and he was shot following a televised two-hour session by a military court.Jeri Laber The Courage of Strangers *Paul Biya, Cameroonian president since 1982 See also *Big man (anthropology) *Cult of personality *Dictatorship *Strongman (politics) References Further reading * *Mic Dic≈£ionar Enciclopedic (\\"Small encyclopedic dictionary\\"), 1978 *Edward Behr, Kiss the Hand you Cannot Bite, Category:Politics of Africa Category:Political science theories Category:Narcissism ","title":"Big man (political science)"},{"id":"2619891","text":"Kustaa Rafael Paasio (6 June 1903 ‚Äì 17 March 1980) was a prominent Finnish politician and editor from Social Democratic Party.

After his schooling, Witt went to the University of Freiburg and the University of G√∂ttingen. He joined the NSDAP (Nazi Party) and was an active party member.According to Schappacher (letter in Mathematical Intelligencer 1996) it was most certainly him and not Oswald Teichm√ºller, who attended Emmy Noether's private seminar held in her house while wearing his SA-uniform. Witt completed his Ph.D. at the University of G√∂ttingen in 1934 with Emmy Noether and later became a lecturer. He was then a member of a team led by Helmut Hasse. During World War II he joined a group of five mathematicians, recruited by Wilhelm Fenner, and which included Georg Aumann, Alexander Aigner, Oswald Teichm√ºller, Johann Friedrich Schultze and their leader professor Wolfgang Franz, to form the backbone of the new mathematical research department in the late 1930s, which would eventually be called: Section IVc of Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht (abbr.

He died in Hamburg in 1991, shortly after his 80th birthday. Work Witt's work has been highly influential. His invention of the Witt vectors clarifies and generalizes the structure of the p-adic numbers. It has become fundamental to p-adic Hodge theory. Witt was the founder of the theory of quadratic forms over an arbitrary field. He proved several of the key results, including the Witt cancellation theorem. He defined the Witt ring of all quadratic forms over a field, now a central object in the theory. The Poincar√©‚ÄìBirkhoff‚ÄìWitt theorem is basic to the study of Lie algebras. In algebraic geometry, the Hasse‚ÄìWitt matrix of an algebraic curve over a finite field determines the cyclic √©tale coverings of degree p of a curve in characteristic p. In the 1970s, Witt claimed that in 1940 he had discovered what would eventually be named the \\"Leech lattice\\" many years before John Leech discovered it in 1965, but Witt did not publish his discovery and the details of exactly what he did are unclear; see his collected works .

In 2008 a new constitution was adopted, which among other things declares Ecuador a peaceful nation and forbid hosting foreign military bases. In 2014, the Security Cooperation Office based in the US embassy was shut down, forcing some 20 US military personnel to leave the country.

Ecuadorean Defense Minister Oswaldo Jarrin described this as the latest move by President Lenin Moreno‚Äôs government to depart form the policies from his leftist predecessor Rafael Correa. Jarrin was careful to stress that the new entity would not violate the country‚Äôs current constitution, which was approved under Correa to ban all presence of foreign military bases in Ecuador. ‚ÄúThere will be a plane that will allow us to share intelligence. It will stay here for three or four days and then return. So in no way it means that a new military base is being established,‚Äù the minister said. He added that due to this arrangement the Ecuadorean Air Force would be handling the cooperation program.

He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman from through , most notably as a member of the Washington Senators team with whom he won a World Series championship in . Judge set American League records for career games (2,056), putouts (19,021), assists (1,284), total chances (20,444), double plays (1,476) and fielding percentage (.993) at first base, and led the AL in fielding average five times, then a record. He also batted over .300 nine times, and hit .385 in the 1924 World Series as the Senators won their only championship. At the time of his retirement in 1934, he ranked tenth in AL history in hits (2,328) and doubles (431), seventh in games played (2,129), eighth in triples (158) and at bats (7,786), and ninth in walks (958). Career Judge, who batted and threw left-handed, was born in Brooklyn, New York City, and grew up on New York's Upper East Side near 66th Street and 1st Avenue on what is now the site of Rockefeller University. He was noticed as a 12-year-old shortstop by a local postman, Bud Hannah, who bought him a first baseman's glove so that he could play at a more natural position. After playing semipro ball in the New York area and having a tryout with the New York Giants in 1911, he signed with the Boston Red Sox in 1914. He hit over .300 as a minor leaguer before his contract was sold to the Senators in , and broke into the major leagues with 12 games late that season. Right fielder Sam Rice, who would be his teammate for the next 18 years, made his debut a month earlier. In the early years of his career, Judge was slowed by the dead ball, and by playing his home games in Griffith Stadium, which defied power hitting. In 12 of his 18 seasons with the Senators, fewer home runs were hit there than in any other AL park. Judge hit 2 home runs in , but that was half of the entire team's total of 4 (three of which were hit in road games; also, opponents hit only 3 HRs while visiting Washington); the only major league team since 1900 to have fewer home runs were the Chicago White Sox, who had 3. Judge ended 1917 with the seventh highest slugging average in the AL at .417, despite having only 2 homers and 15 doubles; however, he also added 15 triples, one of three times he would hit that many. In 1918, he had one of the Senators' five total home runs. In he set a club record with 81 walks, topping the total of 74 shared by Clyde Milan and Doc Gessler; Joe Cronin broke his record with 95 in . On July 1, , Judge preserved the only no-hitter of Walter Johnson's career by snaring Harry Hooper's line drive down the first base line, tossing the ball to Johnson for the final out of the 1-0 victory over the Red Sox. He ended the season with a career-high .333 batting average, and would hit over .300 every year through 1930 except 1922 and 1926. In he tied Ed Delahanty's club record of 10 home runs; Goose Goslin broke the record with 12 in . Judge also passed Howard Shanks to take over the team's career home run record with 27; Goslin moved ahead of him in . In addition, Judge collected 15 triples again along with 32 doubles, and finished eighth in the MVP voting. His 131 double plays that year broke Earl Sheely's AL record of 121 and came within one of George Kelly's major league mark, both set in ; Joe Hauser tied the AL record in 1924 before Sheely broke it again with 136 in 1925. Joe Judge and his father at the World Series baseball game, 1924 The Senators had traditionally struggled, finishing higher than fourth place only four times in their first two decades, but now entered the strongest period in their history. Second baseman Bucky Harris had joined the starting lineup in 1920, and shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh had been acquired in 1922, with rookie third baseman Ossie Bluege also arriving briefly the same year. In 1922 Washington set a major league team record of 161 double plays, breaking the mark of 155 shared by the 1921 Giants and White Sox, and in - the first full season in which all four played together - the Senators shattered their own mark with 182; the record would be broken by the Cincinnati Reds, with 194. In 1923 the Senators also became only the fifth team in major league history - and the first since the Philadelphia Athletics with their \\"$100,000 infield\\" - to have all four infielders lead the league in double plays. Judge led the AL in fielding for the first time that year with a .993 average. In 1924 the Senators won their first pennant, edging the three- time defending league champion New York Yankees by two games. Batting fifth in the World Series against the Giants, Judge scored on Peckinpaugh's double with one out in the ninth inning of Game 2 for a 4-3 victory; he also completed three double plays in the game, one of which ended an inning with the bases loaded. He got three hits each in the losses in Games 3 and 5; Washington took the Series in seven games, winning 4-3 in 12 innings in the last game. They repeated as league champions in 1925, with Judge again pacing the AL with a .993 fielding average, and met the Pittsburgh Pirates in the World Series. Batting cleanup, Judge hit a home run in the second inning of Game 2 at Forbes Field for a 1-0 lead, though Pittsburgh won 3-2. In Game 3 he doubled to drive in the tying run in the third inning, and had a sacrifice fly with the bases loaded in the seventh to again tie the game 3-3; Washington went on to win 4-3. In Game 7 he drew a bases-loaded walk and later scored in a 4-run first inning, but Pittsburgh came back to win 9-7 and take the championship. Joe Judge (front left), receives a flower tribute from the Elks Club for the team before a game in April 1929 Despite his small frame for a first baseman ‚Äì 5 feet 8¬Ω inches and 155 pounds ‚Äì Judge led the AL in fielding average five times, an AL record for first basemen until Don Mattingly did so six times between 1984 and 1993. (Some sources credit Judge with leading the AL six times, but they count 1924 as a tie when he actually lost the title to Wally Pipp by a fraction of a point.) He led the AL in (.996), 1929 (.996) and (.998), committing only two errors in the latter season. In 1926 he broke Clyde Milan's team record of 105 career triples, though Sam Rice passed him the next year. In 1927, Judge also tied Milan's team record of 685 career walks. His career .993 fielding average set an AL mark that stood for more than three decades. In Judge collected a career-best 93 runs batted in and finished third in the MVP balloting. That year he passed George Burns to take over the league record for career games at first base, and he broke Burns' AL mark of 16,892 career putouts in 1929 and his record of 18,231 total chances in 1930. Judge broke George Sisler's AL record of 1134 career double plays in 1928, and his mark of 1251 career assists in . In 1930 he enjoyed his last strong season, again reaching double figures in doubles (29), triples (11) and home runs (10). By the time he left the Senators after the 1932 season he was among the AL's top ten players in career runs and total bases, though he was edged out of the top ten by the time he retired. Judge was disappointed over not being named manager of the Senators in , being passed over in favor of 26-year-old shortstop Cronin, who led the team to the pennant in his first year. Although Judge had no hard feelings about the decision, respecting owner Clark Griffith's hunch and remembering that 27-year-old Harris had managed the Senators to the 1924 championship in his first year, he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers for the 1933 season. After hitting .214 in 42 games in his first National League experience, he switched to the Red Sox in midseason and batted .296 in 35 games for them. He finished his career with 10 games for the Red Sox in early , batting .333, and then briefly managed the minor league Baltimore Orioles for several weeks. In a 20-season career, Judge hit .298 with 1034 RBI in 2171 games; he also collected 2,352 hits and 213 stolen bases with a .378 on-base percentage. He ranked second to Sam Rice in Washington history in games (2084), at bats (7663), hits (2291), runs (1154), RBI (1004), doubles (421), triples (157) and total bases (3239). His 71 career home runs, all with Washington, were second in club history to Goslin's 125. His 249 sacrifice hits for the team remain the record for the Senators/Minnesota Twins franchise. His 2084 career games at first base then trailed only Jake Beckley (2377) and Charlie Grimm (2094) in major league history, and his 1543 double plays trailed only Grimm's 1733. Lou Gehrig broke his AL records for career games, putouts, total chances and double plays at first base in ; Mickey Vernon broke his league record for career assists in . Eddie Yost broke his franchise record of 943 career walks in 1955 as well. Post-playing career Following his retirement as a player, Judge coached the Georgetown University baseball team between 1936 and 1958, except for two seasons as a Senators coach in -46 under manager Ossie Bluege. With his 1946 service, Judge barely qualified for the newly established pension system; his initial $250 investment qualified him for a $510 monthly pension after he turned 63. He was offered the Senators' managing job after the 1947 season, but declined due to his desire to not travel heavily. Judge's son Joseph Judge became a writer and editor, most notably at National Geographic. His grandson, Mark Judge, is a non-fiction author and conservative essayist. Mark wrote a book about his grandfather entitled Damn Senators in 2004. Judge died at 68 after suffering a heart attack while shoveling snow outside his home in the Chevy Chase neighborhood of Washington, D.C., and was buried in Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Silver Spring, Maryland. Trivia *Walter Johnson's roommate, Judge virtually ended Johnson's career in 1927 spring training when a batting practice line drive broke his ankle. *The character of Joe Hardy in the 1955 Broadway musical Damn Yankees may have been based on Joe Judge.

Built by Charlie Mach and designed by the legendary John A. Miller, the Racer opened to the public in 1927 and is one of the oldest operating roller coasters in the world. It features a M√∂bius loop layout, in which both of its trains travel along one continuous track. Each train returns to the station on the opposite side of which it began. Beginnings The first Kennywood Racer was first built in 1910 as a side friction roller coaster by Frederick Ingersoll. It was a twin- track racing coaster designed by John Miller that cost nearly $50,000. When it was built, it was the largest racing coaster in the world. The original Racer had two trains racing side by side on two separate tracks, but it didn't have wheels under the track, so dips and curves were gentle. The trains consisted of three-seat cars with a seating capacity of 18. The Racer was torn down in 1926 and replaced by Kiddieland. Rebirth Racer's trains run close enough together such that riders may high-five riders on the other train The second Racer was designed by John A. Miller in 1927 and built by Charile Mach. Because they liked Miller's previous work, Kennywood hired him to build a new twin or racing coaster. Brady McSwigan wanted a \\"snappy ride that wasn't too much for mothers and children to ride.\\" It cost more than $75,000, because Miller didn't use the topography as effectively as he had with the Jack Rabbit and Pippin. The highest hill of the Racer was built in a ravine and much more lumber was required. The moebius layout is caused by the setup of the station, where the trains turn away from each other upon dispatch. When the trains meet again at the lift hill, they are already on opposite sides than they were in the station, and the tracks do not split for the remainder of the ride. The new Racer's trains were locked onto the tracks, which permitted banked curves as well as curves on the dips. Andy Vettel took the final hill out of the coaster in 1949. The loading platform's facade was redesigned in 1946 by Hindenach and in 1960 by architect Bernard Liff of Liff, Justh and Chetlin. The original front was restored in 1990.

It has about 133,000 inhabitants (). It is the administrative seat of the partido of the same name. It is sometimes called Ciudad de Mar√≠a (City of Mary) due to a series of Marian apparitions that led to the erection of the Sanctuary in honor of Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicol√°s that began during the 1980s and were approved by Bishop Cardelli of the diocese as \\"worthy of belief\\" in 2016.http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/a-marian- apparition-has-been-approved-in-argentina---and-its-a-big-deal-31979/ History San Nicol√°s de los Arroyos was founded on 14 April 1748 by Rafael de Aguiar, who gave it its name to honour Saint Nicholas of Bari, now patron of the city. The closeness to the border between Buenos Aires and two other large provinces made the city a natural stage for the struggle between federalist and Unitarians forces in mid-19th century. The agreement between thirteen provinces on 31 May 1852, which ratified the Federal Pact and called for a Constitutional Assembly sponsored by Justo Jos√© de Urquiza, was signed in this town, and became known as Acuerdo de San Nicol√°s de los Arroyos. Geography The city is located in the north-east of the province of Buenos Aires, 240 km from Buenos Aires City, within the so-called Industrial Corridor that goes from Greater Rosario to La Plata. Its limits are: to the west, Pergamino; to the south, Ramallo; to the east, with the Paran√° River, which separates it from the province of Entre R√≠os; and to the north, with the Arroyo del Medio, a small river that separates it from the province of Santa Fe. Its main accesses are in the north-south axis: the Rosario-Buenos Aires Highway, and the Nuevo Central Argentino railroad. San Nicol√°s has an important port on the Paran√°, able to service large cargo ships. The railway system has passenger and cargo stations, the latter reaching up to the port. Education Rafael de Aguiar Public Library The city has 43 kindergarten institutions, 58 schools of Elementary Education, 28 of High-school level (both public and private), 26 schools for adults and a large number of tertiary studies institutes. It is also home of the San Nicol√°s Regional Faculty, a branch of the National Technological University (UTN) Cultural life There are a variety cultural institutions in the city, though the most important one is perhaps the Rafael de Aguiar Municipal Theatre, founded on August 10, 1908, and designed as a smaller model of the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. Among the many libraries in the city, the oldest and largest is the Rafael de Aguiar Popular Library, founded in 1947 by Juana Couretot de Guella.

It is classified as a type of siu mei (), Cantonese roasted meat. Meat cuts Pork cuts used for char siu can vary, but a few main cuts are common: * Pork loin * Pork belly ‚Äì produces juicy and fatter char siu * Pork butt (shoulder) ‚Äì produces leaner char siu * Pork fat * Pork neck end ‚Äì very marbled (jyu geng yuk) Chinese cuisine A plate of char siu rice Char siu literally means \\"fork roasted\\" (siu being burn/roast and cha being fork, both noun and verb) after the traditional cooking method for the dish: long strips of seasoned boneless pork are skewered with long forks and placed in a covered oven or over a fire. In ancient times, wild boar and other available meats were used to make char siu. However, in modern times, the meat is typically a shoulder cut of domestic pork, seasoned with a mixture of honey, five-spice powder, red fermented bean curd, dark soy sauce, hoisin sauce, red food colouring (not a traditional ingredient but very common in today's preparations and is optional), and sherry or rice wine (optional). These seasonings turn the exterior layer of the meat dark red, similar to the \\"smoke ring\\" of American barbecues. Maltose may be used to give char siu its characteristic shiny glaze. Char siu is typically consumed with a starch, whether inside a bun (chasiu baau, ÂèâÁáíÂåÖ), with noodles (chasiu min, ÂèâÁáíÈ∫µ), or with rice (chasiu faan, ÂèâÁáíÈ£Ø) in fast food establishments, or served alone as a centerpiece or main dish in traditional family dining establishments. If it is purchased outside of a restaurant, it is usually taken home and used as one ingredient in various complex entrees consumed at family meals. Hong Kong cuisine In Hong Kong, char siu is usually purchased from a siu mei establishment, which specialises in meat dishes‚Äîchar siu, soy sauce chicken, white cut chicken, roasted goose, roasted pork, etc. These shops usually display the merchandise by hanging them in the window. As a result, char siu is often consumed alongside one of these other meat dishes, as an independent lunch item on a per-person basis in a \\"rice box\\" meal. More commonly, it is purchased whole or sliced and wrapped and taken home to be used in family meals either by itself or cooked into one of many vegetable or meat dishes which use it as an ingredient. Southeast Asian cuisine Char siu is often served in a noodle soup as here in Chiang Mai, Thailand In Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam, char siew rice is found in many Chinese shƒÅol√† () stalls along with roast duck and roast pork. The dish consists of slices of char siu, cucumbers, white rice and is drenched in sweet gravy or drizzled with dark soy sauce. Char siu rice is also a popular food within the Chinese community in Medan, Indonesia, where it is more called char sio. Char siew rice can also be found in Hainanese chicken rice stalls, where customers have a choice of having their char siu rice served with plain white rice or chicken-flavoured rice, and choose from garlic, chilli and soy sauces. Char siu is called mu daeng (, , \\"red pork\\") in Thailand. In the Philippines, it is known as Chinese asado and usually eaten with cold cuts or served stuffed in siopao. In Flanders and Holland it is sometimes mistaken for the Chinese/Indonesian name 'babi pangang'. This is a different dish (mostly sweeter and served with yellow pickeled chinese cabbage, called Atjar). In fact these Chinese/Indo restaurants serve Cha(r) Sieuw under the original name. These restaurants in the Netherlands derived from Chinese immigrants and are made to adapt to the Dutch palate. Vegetarian char siu also exists, usually made from wheat gluten. It can be found in vegetarian restaurants and stalls in South East Asian Chinese communities. Japanese cuisine ChƒÅsh≈´ ramen Japanese culture has adapted ÂèâÁáí as chƒÅsh≈´ („ÉÅ„É£„Éº„Ç∑„É•„Éº). Unlike its Chinese variant, it is prepared by rolling the meat into a log and then braising it at a low temperature. The Japanese adaptation is typically seasoned with soy sauce, sake, mirin and sugar or other sweetener, without the red food colouring, or five-spice powder. It is a typical ingredient for toppings in rƒÅmen. Pacific Rim cuisine As a means of exceptional flavor and preparation, char siu applications extend beyond pork. In Hawaii, various meats are cooked char siu style. The term char siu refers to meats which have been marinated in char siu seasoning prepared either from scratch or from store-bought char siu seasoning packages, then roasted in an oven or over a fire. Ingredients in marinades for cha siu are similar to those found in China (honey, five-spice, wine, soy, hoisin, etc.), except that red food colouring is often used in place of the red bean curd for convenience. Char siu is used to marinate and prepare a variety of meats which can either be cooked in a conventional or convection oven (often not requiring the use of a fork or cha(zi) as traditional Chinese ovens do), on a standard barbecue, or even in an underground Hawaiian imu. In Hawaii, char siu chicken is as common as char siu pork, and various wild birds, mountain goat, and wild boar are also often cooked char siu style, as are many sausages and skewers.

It was published by TSR, Inc. in 1983. Written by Carl Smith, The Shady Dragon Inn is a supplement used to help dungeon masters introduce fully designed characters into any scenario. Contents The Shady Dragon Inn is a supplement of 118 pregenerated characters, appearing singly and in parties. The book includes a six-page floor plan of the Shady Dragon Inn in 25 mm scale. The book describes groups of non-player characters including fighters, magic-users, clerics, and thieves, various races, special characters, and parties of them all. This part of the book takes up the first 26 pages. The idea of the supplement is to provide a dungeon master with either non-player characters to fill out a campaign or already generated characters for gamers to choose amongst to play in their own right. =Classes= Fighters The book lays out twenty- three different fighters from Abel Artone to Vychan the Little. Each character includes a statistic block, a brief description of their equipment, a physical description, and a very brief biography. Magic Users Eighteen different Magic Users grace the pages of this accessory from Apris the Wondrous to Zarkon the Blue. Like the fighters, each includes statistic blocks and descriptions with the addition of the wizard's spell selection. Clerics Seventeen clerics grace the pages of this manual including everything from Ambrose the Celt to Penelope of West Haven. Like the wizards the cleric description includes known spells along with a description and general possessions. Thieves This class of character maintained the title of thief until changing to rogue in the third edition of Dungeons & Dragons. The supplement details fourteen of the thieves from Aiden Ablefingers to Zacharias the Nimble. =Races= Dwarves Ten dwarves find their way into the manual from Astrid Helmsplitter to Ulf the Sledge. As with the others a statistic block and brief description comes with each of the characters. Elves An even dozen elves including Aithne of Far Isle to Torquil of Deep Hollow occupy this section of the book. As in the original Dungeons and Dragons system, all of the elves are magic-users and their spell books come with their descriptions. Halflings Begol Burrowell is the first of ten Halflings described in the tome and Wat Watershed is the last. Information about their background is included with a statistic block. =Others= Special characters The thirteen characters presented in this section come from the Dungeons & Dragons toy line marketed at this time. Each includes a lengthier, but still short, description block and statistic area. Mercion the cleric is the first described here while Warduke, an evil fighter, is the last. =The Shady Dragon Inn= The inn itself gets a description near the end of the supplement along with the people found there on a daily basis. Prices for the various services provided by the Shady Dragon also come in this section. In 1983, a follow-up article written by product author Carl Smith for Polyhedron Newszine provided additional details about the employees and furnishings of the Shady Dragon Inn (Smith 1983). Parties The last area of the book details group of adventurers, or parties, staying at the inn at any particular time. Publication history AC1 Shady Dragon Inn was written by Carl Smith, with a cover by Larry Day and interior illustrations by Jim Holloway, and was published by TSR in 1983 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder. The inner side of this outer folder is printed with a 20\\" by 17\\" map of the Shady Dragon Inn (ground and top floor), with a scale of 1 inch = 5 feet. Reception Doug Cowie reviewed AC1 for Imagine magazine, giving it a positive review. Calling the accessory \\"very welcome\\", he nevertheless faulted the character sketches for their lack of information on treasure and other items carried. He also noted that the section on parties is \\"a waste of space\\" as it repeats information already provided elsewhere in the book. Cowie called the part of the accessory dedicated to the Inn \\"good stuff\\". He ended his review by noting that AC1 is not a must-have, but the inclusion of the inn - \\"an acceptable adventurer's base\\" - makes it above-average and \\"worth considering\\".

It's seldom referred to as San Nicol√°s, but usually as El Centro (\\"The Centre\\"), and the part east of the 9 de Julio Avenue is known as Microcentro. The limits of the neighbourhood are the C√≥rdoba, Callao, Rivadavia, La R√°bida Norte and Eduardo Madero Avenues. The district is home to 33,305 inhabitants. History The area was named for the San Nicol√°s Parish, consecrated in 1773. Demolished when work on Ninth of July Avenue started, the Obelisk of Buenos Aires now stands in its place. The future Metropolitan Cathedral of Buenos Aires was also built in the San Nicol√°s area between 1770 and 1822. Prospering following the establishment of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, Buenos Aires merchants had Boneo's Pier built in 1802, quickly becoming the city's main shipping terminal. The British Empire opened a consulate here in 1794, leading to the development of a sizable British community in the area, which became known as the \\"English borough.\\" They founded the English Merchants' Society in 1810 and the British Consulate became home to the first modern bank in Buenos Aires, in 1822. A San Nicol√°s street in 1888. The ward retains much of its colonial grid Former Central Post Office on Leandro Alem Avenue. Enjoying close commercial ties to the British Empire, in 1830 Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas donated land in the area for the benefit of the new St. John the Baptist Anglican Church, the oldest in existence in Buenos Aires. A growing community from the United States established the first Methodist church nearby in 1836. The growing importance of the area as a financial center was highlighted by the 1854 establishment of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange. San Nicol√°s remains the financial center of Argentina, something underscored by the presence of the Argentine Central Bank and the National Bank, Argentina's largest. This area also saw the opening of the first railway station in Latin America, which went in service in 1857, facing what today is the Col√≥n Theatre. Several well-known members of the English community lived in the neighborhood of San Nicol√°s, including the Gowland's, belonging to a London family. In 1862 the British established the Bank of London and R√≠o de la Plata, located in the corners of the streets Piedad and Reconquista. The rapid development of the Argentine economy after 1875 made itself evident in San Nicol√°s in the reclaiming of riverfront land, where the shore popular with washerwomen became the Paseo de Julio (today Leandro Alem Avenue) and lots such as the central artillery field became city parks. The area's network of horse-drawn trolleys gave way in 1913 to the first metro stations in the Southern Hemisphere and renowned institutions such as the Col√≥n and Cervantes Theatres were followed in the 1920s and 1930s by the addition of Diagonal Norte Avenue, landmarks such as the Buenos Aires Central Post Office, and one of the greatest concentrations of popular theatres and cinemas in the world. San Nicol√°s acquired its approximate, present layout when, in 1936, five city blocks were demolished (including numerous historical landmarks, such as the Mercado del Plata and the San Nicol√°s Parish) for the first stage of the Ninth of July Avenue. Economy Incorporating most of the Buenos Aires Central Business District, San Nicol√°s is home to the headquarters of numerous leading Argentine firms, including Aerol√≠neas Argentinas,\\"Terms and Conditions.\\" Aerol√≠neas Argentinas.

In 1994, Green won one race but also claimed the Busch Series championship. Terry had four wins out of twenty starts, and Bobby debuted the new No. 33 Dentyne Pontiac, winning at Michigan International Speedway. Green had another win in 1995, but fell to twelfth in the standings. Terry had one win and finished eighteenth in points. In 1996, Bob retired from racing and Bobby became the new listed owner of the 44. With Shell Oil sponsoring, Bobby ran sixteen races and won at Nashville Speedway USA.

Labonte Motorsports was inactive until Justin began running a part-time schedule in 2004. Driving the No. 44 United States Coast Guard Dodge Intrepid, he made sixteen starts and won the Twister 300 at Chicagoland Speedway. The team partnered with Haas CNC Racing in 2005 to allow Justin to run a full-time schedule in the 44 Chevy. Despite three top-tens and a seventeenth-place finish in points, Coast Guard departed for Richard Childress Racing at the end of the season, causing the team to close its doors again.

He split from the Pamyat-led National Patriotic Front in 1992 and formed his own party, the Russian National Union, the following year. This party re-emerged as the RNSP around 1999 after Kasimovsky closed down the Russian National Union and began to move away from the emphasis placed on the Russian Orthodox Church by that group. Despite this lessening of emphasis on religion the party's website lists Orthodox Christianity as one of its four main ideological principles, the others being a strong state, aggressive Russian nationalism and non-Marxist socialism.

Both these languages belong to the Kartvelian language family.Sorosoro.org  History  In the 13th century BC, the Kingdom of Colchis was formed as a result of the increasing consolidation of the tribes inhabiting the region, which covered modern western Georgia. The endonym Margali (·Éõ·Éê·É†·Éí·Éê·Éö·Éò) is presumably reflected in the Greek Manraloi (ŒúŒ¨ŒΩœÅŒ±ŒªŒøŒπ), recorded as a people of Colchis by Ptolemy in the 2nd century BC. By the mid-3rd century, the Lazi tribe came to dominate most of Colchis, establishing the kingdom of Lazica (or Egrisi in Georgian sources. In the 5th century, the first Christian king Gubazes I of Lazica declared Christianity as a state religion of Lazica. Locals began to have closer contact with the Greeks and acquired various Hellenic cultural traits, including in some cases the language. From 542 to 562, Lazica was a scene of the protracted rivalry between the Eastern Roman and Sassanid empires, culminating in the Lazic War. Emperor Heraclius's offensive in 628 AD brought victory over the Persians and ensured Roman predominance in Lazica until the invasion and conquest of the Caucasus by the Arabs in the second half of the 7th century. In the 7th century Lazica fell to the Muslim conquest, however in the 8th century combined Lazic and Abasgian forces successfully repelled the Arab occupation. In 780 Lazica was incorporated to Kingdom of Abkhazia as a result of dynastic succession, the latter led the unification of Georgian monarchy in the 11th century. The nobility and clergy of Lazica switched from the Hellenic ecclesiastic tradition to the Georgian, and Georgian became the language of culture and education. After the fragmentation of the Kingdom of Georgia in the 15th century, Mingrelia was an autonomous principality within the Kingdom of Imereti, until being annexed by the Russian Empire in the 19th century.Mingrelian lady (right) negotiating with the invading Turks, 1856. An episode of the Crimean War. In several censuses under the Russian Empire and the early Soviet Union, Megrelians were considered a separate group, largely because at the time of the annexation Samegrelo was politically separate from eastern Georgia, the historical political and cultural centers of the Medieval Georgian Kingdoms. They were, reclassified under the broader category of Georgian in the 1930s. Currently, most Megrelians identify themselves as a subgroup of the Georgian nation and have preserved many characteristic cultural features - including the Megrelian language - that date back to the pre-Christian Colchian era. Lavrentiy Beria, the Chief of Stalin's secret police, was a Mingrelian. (As is well-known, Stalin himself was a Georgian.) The first President of an independent Georgia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia (1939‚Äì1993), was a Megrelian.McCauley, Martin. Who's who in Russia since 1900.

Approximately 180,000-200,000 people of Georgian and Megrelian provenance have been expelled from Abkhazia as a result of the Abkhaz‚ÄìGeorgian conflict in the early 1990s and the ensuing ethnic cleansing of Georgians in this separatist region.

It excludes the entire watersheds of the Missouri River and Ohio River, and portions of the Arkansas River and the Red River of the South, but otherwise encompasses the entire Mississippi River from Lake Itasca, Minnesota, to the Gulf of Mexico. The division includes all or parts of 13 states: Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Tennessee, Wisconsin, and South Dakota. The mission of the division is to serve the Mississippi Valley region by managing the watersheds and developing collaborative engineering solutions that will reduce risks through the reduction of flood damage potential, maintain and enhance navigation, and protect, restore and enhance environmental ecosystems; while being prepared to respond to regional and national emergencies. Additionally, MVD operates hydroelectric plants within the system, is a large water and construction regulatory body, and maintains over 1.9 million acres for recreation. MVD, and specifically the New Orleans District, is responsible for the design and construction of the Hurricane & Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) which seeks to provide 100 Year storm protection to the City of New Orleans. Overview Mississippi Valley Division building in Vicksburg, Mississippi The Mississippi Valley Division is made up of six districts, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, Rock Island, Illinois, St. Louis, Missouri, Memphis, Tennessee, Vicksburg, Mississippi, and New Orleans, Louisiana. The Division Commander is directly responsible to the Chief of Engineers. Within the authorities delegated, MVD Commander directs and supervises the individual District Commanders. MVD duties include preparing engineering studies and design, constructing, operating, and maintaining flood control and river and harbor facilities and installations, administering the laws on civil works activities, acquiring, managing, and disposing of real estate, and mobilization support of military, natural disaster, and national emergency operations. Mississippi River Commission The MR&T; Project Design Flood MRC Area of Jurisdiction outlined in red The Mississippi River Commission was established in 1879 to facilitate improvement of the Mississippi River from the Head of Passes near its mouth to its headwaters. The stated mission of the Commission was to develop and implement plans to correct, permanently locate, and deepen the channel of the Mississippi River, improve safety and ease of navigation, prevent destructive floods. and promote and facilitate commerce, trade, and the postal service. For nearly a half century, the MRC functioned as an executive body reporting directly to the U.S. Secretary of War. The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 changed the mission of the MRC. The consequent Flood Control Act of 1928 created the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project (MR&T;). The act assigned responsibility for developing and implementing the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project (MR&T;) to the Mississippi River Commission. The MR&T; project provides for control of floods of the Mississippi River from Head of Passes to vicinity of Cape Girardeau, Missouri, control of floods of the tributaries and outlets of the Mississippi River as they are affected by its backwaters, and improvement for navigation of the Mississippi River from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Cairo, Illinois. This includes improvements to certain harbors and improvement for navigation of Old and Atchafalaya Rivers from the Mississippi River to Morgan City, Louisiana. It also includes bank stabilization of the Mississippi River from the Head of Passes to Cairo, Illinois, preservation, restoration, and enhancement of environmental resources, including but not limited to measures for fish and wildlife, increased water supplies, recreation, cultural resources, and other related water resources development programs, and semi-annual inspection trips to observe river conditions and facilitate coordination with local interests in implementation of projects. For over a century the inspections and hearings have been held aboard the M/V Mississippi and its predecessors. There are seven members on the commission. The current President of the Mississippi River Commission is U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Major General Kaiser. The mission is executed through the United States Army Corps of Engineers Mississippi Valley Division Districts in St. Paul, Rock Island, St. Louis, Memphis, Vicksburg, and New Orleans. The headquarters of the operation is in Historic Downtown Vicksburg in the Mississippi River Commission Building.

Its most heavily used section is designated Airport Freeway where it serves the southern entrance of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. History SH 183 was designated on November 30, 1932 from SH 15 east of Mesquite via Mesquite to Dallas. This highway was SH 15A before March 19, 1930, and this highway was erroneously omitted from the March 19, 1930 highway log. On September 26, 1939, it extended to Fort Worth, replacing a section of SH 15. On October 30, 1939, SH 183 was extended west from US 81 to US 80. On October 6, 1943, SH 183 was extended south from US 80 to US 377, and SH 183 was rerouted east to US 77 northwest of Dallas. The section east of US 77 was renumbered as SH 352, and the old route west of US 77 would be designated as FM 684 on February 26, 1946, but this would be changed to SH 356 on August 8, 1946. On December 4, 1957, SH 183 was rerouted to end at I 35-E, and the old route of SH 183 was transferred to Loop 12. On May 13, 1977, SH 183 was extended southeast to I-20 over cancelled Loop 820. On August 29, 1979, SH 183 was rerouted over Spur 350 and SH 121 and I-820. The old route of SH 183 was redesignated as SH 10. Route description Its eastern terminus is the interchange with Interstate 35E in Dallas. It leads northwest as the John W. Carpenter Freeway, then moves westward at the three- way interchange with State Highway 114 and Loop 12 at the former site of Texas Stadium (from which Highway 114 continues as the Carpenter Freeway). The freeway continues as Airport Freeway on its westerly course through Irving, and forms the southern boundary of DFW Airport. Moving into Tarrant County, the freeway, still called Airport Freeway, continues west through Euless, Bedford, and Hurst. In Bedford, 183 joins State Highway 121 and both follow the same co-signed westerly route. At the intersection with Interstate 820, 183 and 121 turn south with the interstate, and all three highways briefly share the same co-signed route. Highway 183 leaves I-820 after less than at a parclo interchange with State Highway 10 (a route that formed the original pre-freeway alignment of SH 183). 183 then turns west as it becomes a surface street, Baker Boulevard, through Richland Hills. After entering Haltom City, 183 joins State Highway 26 and, briefly, U.S. Highway 377, leading southwest through Haltom City as East Belknap Street. At an intersection with Northeast 28th Street and Midway Road, 183 turns west onto the former. After entering the Fort Worth city limits, 183 intersects Interstate 35W/US 287 in a parclo interchange, then passes the historic Fort Worth Stock Yards. In western Fort Worth and its environs, Highway 183 forms a partial ring road. In northwest Fort Worth, this semicircular route begins when 183 curves southwest as Ephriham Avenue. Continuing southwest, 183 becomes River Oaks Boulevard in River Oaks, Westworth Boulevard in Westworth Village, and Alta Mere Drive as it passes the eastern boundaries of Fort Worth Naval Air Base and White Settlement. Turning south past Ridgmar Mall and a cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 30, 183 crosses Spur 580 (formerly U.S. Highway 80, part of the Bankhead Highway) and again meets U.S. Highway 377 at a rotary intersection, referred to locally as a traffic circle. From the circle, it turns southeast as Southwest Boulevard, again becoming a freeway and passing through Benbrook before reaching its southern terminus at Interstate 20 and Southwest Loop 820 near Hulen Mall. This freeway segment served as the alignment of Interstates 20 and 820 before the current route was completed in the early 1980s. Exit list The entire route is located inside Tarrant and Dallas counties.  References   Bibliography  *Fort Worth Street Map. Chicago: Rand McNally, 1990. *\\"Dallas/Ft.

H√•kon Galen was born no later than the 1170s and died in 1214. His epithet \\"the crazy\\" or \\"the mad\\" can also be translated as frenzied, furious or frantic and probably refers to ferociousness in battle. Background H√•kon Galen was the son of Folkvid the Lawspeaker and Cecilia Sigurdsdotter, an illegitimate daughter of king Sigurd Munn. Cecilia had been married off to Folkvid the Lawspeaker in V√§rmland in Sweden, by her father's enemies after he had been defeated and killed in 1155. In 1177, Sverre arrived in Norway and took over leadership of the Birkebeiner rebel faction. Sverre claimed to be an illegitimate son of king Sigurd Munn, and thus Cecilia's half-brother. Subsequently Cecilia left her husband and returned to Norway, probably taking young H√•kon with her. After Sverre succeeded in winning the throne of Norway, Cecilia had her marriage to Folkvid annulled, claiming she had been forced to marry him against her will. Career H√•kon Galen is first mentioned in the Sagas as one of the prominent men among the Birkebeiner fighting for King Sverre in 1193 against a force led by Harald Maddadsson, the Earl of Orkney. He was supported by two sons-in-law of Erling Skakke, Hallkjell Jonsson and Sigurd Magnusson, the latter an acknowledged son of King Magnus V of Norway and claimant to the throne of Norway. The attacking force was gathered from the islands of Orkney and Shetland, giving rise to the name Island Beards (Eyjarskeggjar). In the spring of 1194, King Sverre sailed south to confront the attacking force. The two fleets met on April 3rd in the Battle of Florv√•g (Slaget ved Florv√•g) on Ask√∏y, an island just north of Bergen. Both Hallkjell Jonsson and Sigurd Magnusson died in the conflict. The battle experience of the Birkebeiner veterans proved to be decisive in achieving victory over the Eyjarskeggjar. In January 1204, when King Sverre's son, King H√•kon III died, H√•kon Galen was made leader of the army, given the title jarl (earl) and named steward of the kingdom during the minority of the child Guttorm Sigurdsson. These appointments were made the day after Guttorm became king and H√•kon thus became the real leader of the Birkebeiner, as King Guttorm was only 4 years old. When Guttorm suddenly died in August the same year, H√•kon was the favored candidate among the Birkebeiner military leaders, the lendmenn, to become the next king. However, at the Thing convened in Nidaros to elect the new king, his candidacy was opposed by the Archdiocese of Nidaros and the farmers of Tr√∏ndelag. According to the Bagler sagas, H√•kon's Swedish origins were held against him. In the end, H√•kon's half-brother, Inge B√•rdsson became king. H√•kon remained earl and leader of the military, and was given half the royal revenues. From 1204 until 1208, Inge and H√•kon fought the Bagler rising, under the pretenders Erling Steinvegg and Philippus Simonsson, until the warfare was ended by the settlement of Kvits√∏y. By this agreement, Inge and H√•kon recognized Bagler rule over the eastern parts of Norway with Philippus ruling as earl, under the nominal overlordship of king Inge, while the Birkebeiner remained in control of the rest of the country. Earl H√•kon ruled the western part of Norway, with his power base in Bergen. The relationship between H√•kon and his brother Inge seems to have been tense at times. When it became clear that Philippus was continuing to call himself king, in breach of the Kvits√∏y- agreement, H√•kon made attempts to have himself declared king as well, but Inge refused to accept this. Instead, an agreement was drawn up by which the brother that survived the other would inherit the other‚Äôs lands, while a legitimate son of either would inherit them both. H√•kon's legitimate son, Knut Haakonsson, thereby seemed to be in a strong position to become the next king, as Inge only had an illegitimate son. In 1214, earl H√•kon was suspected of having had a hand in a rising by the farmers of Tr√∏ndelag against king Inge. Open conflict between the two brothers never broke out, however, as H√•kon died of natural causes in Bergen just after Christmas of 1214. Inge took over his part of the kingdom. Personal life In 1205, H√•kon Galen married the Swedish noblewoman Kristina Nilsdotter, whose maternal grandfather was Eric the Saint who reigned as King Eric IX of Sweden. They had a son Knut H√•konsson (c. 1208 - 1261). After the death of H√•kon, Kristina took their son Knut with her and returned to V√§sterg√∂tland, Sweden where she married Swedish nobleman, Eskil Magnusson. H√•kon Galen was buried in the old Bergen Cathedral which was demolished in 1531. Today, a memorial marks its site in Bergenhus fortress. Primary sources The main source of information concerning the life of H√•kon Galen is from the Bagler sagas (Baglersagaene). He is also mentioned in Sverris saga and H√•kon H√•konsson's saga. Historic prospective The Norwegian civil war era (Norwegian: Borgerkrigstida) was the period between 1130 and 1240. During this time, a series of civil wars were fought between rival kings and pretenders to the throne of Norway. After the death of King Sigurd the Crusader in 1130, the goal of the warring parties was always to put their man on the throne. In the first decades of the civil wars, alliances frequently shifted, and centered on the person of a king or pretender to the throne, but eventually, towards the end of the 12th century, two rival parties emerged, known as the Birkebeiner and the Bagler. After these two factions were reconciled in 1217, a more ordered system of centralized government was gradually able to bring an end to such frequent uprisings. The failed rebellion of duke Skule B√•rdsson in 1240 was the final episode of the civil war era. References Sources *J√≥nsson, Karl The Saga of King Sverri of Norway translator J. Stephton.

Needleman, who with an Elo rating of 2242 was untitled at the time of the tournament, was seeded 99th. He defeated GM Alexander Shabalov with black in round 10 and drew with GM Gata Kamsky in the final round, preventing Kamsky from taking first place.

The rapid-play time control tie-break tournament created controversy, as it appeared to some observers that the higher-rated GMs agreed to short draws with each other in order to conserve energy but fought hard in games against Needleman in order to wear him down and ensure that he would finish last.

It has a more restricted range than other members of its genus, Aethia, living only around the Aleutian Islands and on some islands off Siberia (like Commander Islands), and breeding on these islands. It is one of the smallest alcids, only the closely related least auklet being smaller. Its name is derived from the long white feathers on its face that are part of its breeding plumage. The whiskered auklet is a poorly studied species and much research needs to be undertaken on the species. It was originally described as two different species, from specimens collected at different ends of its range, however research has shown that it is a single species with clinal variation along its range. It is not thought to undertake migration, but instead attends its breeding islands year round, and has been shown to roost on land all year round, an unusual trait in the family. Whiskered auklets lay a single egg in a rocky crevice, in loose colonies with other whiskered auklets and also other colonial seabirds. Both parents take part in incubation and chick rearing. The whiskers have been shown to help them sense their way to and out of their nests at night.Seneviratne, Sampath S. & Ian L. Jones (2008) Mechanosensory function for facial ornamentation in the whiskered auklet, a crevice-dwelling seabird. Behavioral Ecology Advance Access. DOI 10.1093/beheco/arn029 Whiskered auklets feed in the inshore zone, usually within 16 km of land, where tidal currents concentrate their prey into dense swarms. They feed predominantly on copepods during the summer months, mostly on the species Neocalanus plumchrus; and switching to euphausiid krill in the fall and winter. Description An odd characteristic of this bird, which is also shared with the Crested Auklet, is that its plumage smells of citrus. Fishing boats pose a huge threat to this bird, since it is attracted to lights at night.Whiskered Auklet  Audubon Field Guide: ‚ÄúConservation Status‚Äù https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/whiskered-auklet References * *Byrd, G.

The park is located in Springbank, Alberta, west of the city limits of Calgary on the Trans-Canada Highway. The park features a variety of rides including a large log flume, called \\"Timber Falls\\", rides \\"Chaos\\" and \\"Storm\\", and the park's two biggest attractions: \\"The Vortex\\", its corkscrew roller coaster, and the \\"Dream Machine\\", a 56-passenger swing ride. There are many other rides that are unique to the park. Calaway Park currently has 32 rides, 20 food locations, 23 games, and covers . The park has been in continuous seasonal operation since 1982. History The park was created by John McAfee, a former Red Deer lawyer, and 15 other investors from British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario. Around 1979, the group paid $500,000 to Hanna-Barbera Productions for the licensing rights to the characters and locations in The Flintstones. While the original TV show ended in 1966, various Saturday morning series continued the basic plot lines, including The New Fred and Barney Show (1979) and The Flintstone Comedy Show. In addition to the Flintstones theme, a Victorian motif was planned for the park; similar to the Grande World Exposition of 1890 in Canada's Wonderland, which opened in 1981. It was presumed by park founders that parents' entrance fees, along with food and gift purchases, would pay operating costs. Alternatively, article also published in Globe and Mail, 21 May 1985, page B10. Originally planned as Flintstone Fun Park, the project was to cost $8 million; costs \\"mushroomed\\" during an energy and real estate boom. The park cost $25 million, including $3 million for the primary corkscrew roller coaster. =Tied up with development appeals= On 16 October 1979, Municipal District of Rocky View No. 44 councillors voted 6 to 1 approve the Flintstone Fun Park, the opposing vote coming from the Springbank councillor. The approval came after council sat as the Development Appeal Board over a six-week period, and included a field-trip to \\"similar\\" parks in the United States. During hearings, residents submitted that it would ruin their rural lifestyle, while the Calgary Regional Planning Commission suggested it would not comply with established planning documents. The approval came with the requirements that there be a distance between it and two nearby schools, that the park and parking lot be in the north end of the property, that development beyond the initial 60 acres (of a total 143 acres) would require further development application and approval, and that the park comply with a noise provision. The park was to have all layout plans, landscaping, landscaping materials, operation practices, and entrance and exit signs meet with M.D. approval. Bill Copithorne, councillor for the Springbank area, suggested to the media that conditions weren't specific enough for residents. The Alberta Appeal Court (AAC) ordered a second hearing by the council, again sitting as the Development Appeal Board. The hearing took place in June 1980; three of the councillors were disqualified by the AAC for having visited the American parks previously. The developers argued that they felt 90 per cent of area residents wouldn't object once they visited the park and realized they'd be \\"proud\\" of it. If approved, the developers suggested that they would welcome a committee \\"mostly of opponents\\" to have a say in planning the park. Locals objected to a proposed fake mountain. McAfee denied knowledge of a statement of company objectives, which included the creation of an on- site hotel. Both sides argued whether the park met the definition of a country recreation centre. The Flintstone Fun Park developers felt 200,000 people would visit in the first year, and somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 annually after a decade or two. By this point, the expectation was that there would be a four-lane overpass above Springbank Road, to lessen the traffic disruption. McAfee said the company did not expect to be profitable in the first few years. Approval was given with conditions. A cement truck depot was seeking to move into Springbank at the same time, it too was opposed. It was blocked quickly on the grounds that the regional plan limited industry in rural areas. Nine land owners filed a motion in the Alberta Appeal Court in mid-July, seeking permission to challenge the ruling on the grounds that council acted contrary to both a local by-law and the Calgary regional plan, didn't adequately explain its decision, and overstepped its powers by attaching conditions. Without the ability to ask the Alberta Planning Board (APB) themselves, the Springbank Action Group (SAG) asked in February 1981 that the Calgary Regional Planning Commission or Rocky View school board refer the matter to the APB, using recent legislation that allowed it to settle the situation. Once either organisation had brought the matter to the APB, the SAG would take over from them and represent the opposition. SAG would probably concede if the APB voted against them, but would be able to appeal the ruling in the courts should the APB rule against the park. With its major challenges out of the way, Flintstone Fun Park changed its name to Calaway Park, and was under development by January 1982. Bill Copithorne, the sole dissenting vote in the Municipal District's initial approval, was now the Rocky View reeve. Talking at an 11 January 1982, town hall meeting organized by the new citizen's group Partners in Progress, Copithorne warned that further development would be inevitable along the Trans-Canada Highway corridor. He called for a new general plan to ensure that further additions would be \\"high- class\\". A proposed commercial strip would include a motel and RV campground. The director of the Calgary Regional Planning Commission disagreed with Copithorne's statement of \\"inevitability\\"; a hearing on the motel and campground were scheduled for 22 January. Rocky View's planning director noted that a commercial zone might not happen, and commercial development in Springbank might happen away from the highway as well. Simultaneously, Municipal Affairs Minister Marvin Moore was considering further Municipal District representation for the Springbank and Bearspaw areas, a request triggered by residents after high population growth. Area resident Mary Luzi asked the area government to block the creation of a 31-metre-high rollercoaster; this was unsuccessful. McAfee, who lived a \\"half-mile away\\" from the park site, admitted he would be displeased if he could see a corkscrew roller coaster from his house. The coaster was painted in earth tones, to blend in with the foothills. Said Luzi: \\"What does that do when there are still purple and red roofs, along with oranges, yellows and blues?\\" Trees, bushes, and landscaping were to block the sitelines. =Opening to financial difficulties= By opening day in 1982, the boom in Calgary had passed. The city was mired in recession and forecasting a decrease in population for the first time in a century. Unlike in the United States, there were many government-supported rival attractions, such as the Calgary Zoo and Calgary Stampede. Initial entrance fee to the park was a \\"hefty\\" $11.95, with unlimited access to attractions. This is standard within the industry; all attractions were available with one ticket at Disneyland as of June 1982. Canadians objected to this simplified plan. The 14 attractions included The Flintstones themed attractions, the Corkscrew roller coaster, a petting zoo, and Cinema 180; entertainment included costumed characters of the Flintstones. American Kent Lamasters was hired as general manager. By 1983, the park was facing 17 lawsuits totaling $1 million, including from Batra Construction Ltd. ($772,000), Canadian Western Natural Gas, the Municipal District of Rocky View, and the Canadian federal government. It sought help from the provincial government's Department of Tourism and Small Business. The government was not interested in the park from an equity standpoint. Alberta Opportunity Co., a Crown corporation set up to finance or assist management of viable small and medium businesses in the province, was not approached, at least in the early stage. On 11 February 1983, the park landed in receivership, with Touche Ross Ltd. (now known as Deloitte) continuing its operations. All 17 lawsuits were stayed upon receivership. To attempt to attain profitability, the park cut admission fees, started events, and began a $1.1 million capital expansion. All of the changes were aimed at older age groups; the child-centric Flintstones theme was considered too minor to support the large facility; dropping the licensing fees helped fund the renovations. Along with new shows and rides, a restaurant was to feature more sophisticated foods and a liquor license. The admission cut was based on general manager Lemaster's success at Silver Dollar City, doing the same while marking things up within the park. Gordon Dixon bought the park, and management reformatted the attraction as an amusement park, rather than a theme park. A third of the landscaping was lost after the first season, as their Ontario landscaper was not familiar with the dry Alberta weather conditions. After the 1984 season ended, receiver Touche Ross ended its stay. A deal with Northland Bank went into effect during the autumn, after waiting for government approval. Northland bought the park from its original owners, selling the new company (Calalta Amusements Ltd.) back on better terms. It took over loans of $3.5 million from the Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of America Canada. They saw promise in attendance numbers, and kept the park open for 1985. (Northland itself was financially shaky, with declared loan losses of $4.5 million in 1983. Northland folded in 1985.) =Reformatting turns park around= During the off-season between 1984 and 1985, there was a rearranging of $17 million of debt, which allowed the park to return to profitability. The 1985 season saw the addition of AquaRage, Canada's only dry-wet ride. This was to replace a large log ride that was too chilly, given the climate. Concerts included Doug and the Slugs, Ozark Mountain Daredevils, and various contemporary tribute acts. By the end of their fourth season, Calaway Park turned a profit, despite 35 bad weather days, 10 above the expected average. The company continued to make loan payments to Northland as part of its five-year loan. When the park opened in 1982, many of the buildings, merchandise, and rides were styled around licensed Hanna-Barbera characters. These can be still seen today in some of the older and colourful Flintstones-style buildings. The licensing was dropped in favour of reinvesting the funds into tangible capital projects to improve the grounds. The park has generally avoided licensing since, aside from its Theodore Tugboat soft playground. The park has paid outside licensees, including for 2009 appearances by Dora, Diego, and SpongeBob SquarePants.\\"2009 Brass Ring Awards Winner: Seasonal or Special Event Program Class 2 Calaway Park, Calgary, Alberta, Canada \\", International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, 2009. Early in their career, in the 1980s, Blue Rodeo did a performance at Calaway Park; their five performance booking was poorly received by the mothers and children at the park. In 1988 Calaway Park introduced two mascots, Jack Bunny and Jill O' Hare, who can now be seen roaming the streets of the Park; The Jack and Jill Club 10th Birthday Bash! musical was presented in 2005. The club is open to season pass holders aged 3 to 12. The park's director of marketing, Bob Williams, became known throughout the Calgary tourist attraction scene as \\"The Coupon King\\". As of 2003, the park would flood the market with 3 million coupons a year, including direct mail discounts to 800,000 households; of those mailed coupons, 70,000 are redeemed. They estimate over 75% of admissions are discounted. =Recent seasons= In 2001, the park developed five new acres of land of the Calaway owns. The Corkscrew Roller Coaster underwent a major transformation in 2005, including a new paint scheme, a new theme, and a new name, becoming The Vortex Roller Coaster. The Vortex roller coaster is tall and has two inversions. The park's gas-powered bumper boats were taken out of service, and newer environment-friendly electric powered boats featuring water squirt guns were introduced, becoming The BumperBoat Splash Challenge! Two thrill rides were also repainted and renamed that year, as the Mountain Scrambler became Adrenaline Test Zone and the family thrill ride SkyRider became the Wave Rider. Also added was Halloweekends, a five-weekend event during which the park undergoes a haunted transformation, including an updated Haunted Hotel, Freaky Food, a Spooktacular Stage Show, and many characters roaming the streets of the park. View of Calaway Park in 2006. The park saw the addition of several new attractions for the park's 25th anniversary. In 2005, park management expressed interest in additional roller coasters. \\"Twiz & Twirl: The World's First Interactive Dual-Zone Maze\\" and thrill ride Chaos were added in 2005, with chair swing Swing Around taken out for next year's The Storm. The park's 25th anniversary, the next year, added The Storm: Mother Nature's Thrill Ride, children's swing ride Swirly Twirl, and U-Drive: Safety School of Motoring, a renovated Turnpike. The park entrance was renovated. Drop tower Free Fallin' replaced Topsy Turvy, swing ride The Dream Machine, ferris wheel Balloon Ascension, and Flying Ace were added in 2007. The Park became a kilometre closer to Calgary in 2007 after the city expanded its borders. Family ride Tip Top was retired at the end of the season. Samba Spin was added in 2008. Mind Blaster debuted for the 30th anniversary of the park in 2011. As of late July, the park attendance was down 3%, due to a \\"cool wet spring.\\" July has been \\"good for business\\", with August traditionally their busiest month.

As of 2003, they had 65,000 season pass holders. The park had record breaking attendance in July and August. Fifty percent of ticket sales are in the Christmas period, when Calaway does extensive marketing of its tickets as \\"stocking stuffers\\". While the park is deemed an \\"important\\" tourist draw in the Rocky View County, CrossIron Mills with its planned racetrack and casino is expected to supplant the park as the biggest draw.

Each employee receives a minimum of 20 general training hours, and 5 to 12 department training hours. About two-thirds of all guest comments about employees are positive. In 2000, the Conference Board of Canada named the park the \\"Top Employer of Youth\\", in Canada. Department managers, as of 2003, were allowed to run their operation as if \\"separate businesses\\", to give a more entrepreneurial drive. Permanent staff are encouraged to actively participate in the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, to gain new ideas, and ensure the park doesn't remain creatively isolated. In 2010, it won \\"Best Reward and Recognition Program (Facility under 1 million)\\" from IAAPA's Human Resources Excellence Awards. Rides and attractions Calaway Park's attractions are geared to a wide range of ages. The park is considered amongst North America's safest amusement parks according to 2005 statistics. Calaway Park offers several mandatory training sessions, safety briefings and ride-employee certifications that take place prior or during the employee's first shift.

Typically, they are enacted to control irrigation because of floods or other natural disasters and are administered by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. These laws were enacted beginning in 1917, with the most recent one being passed in 1965. Background There were several major floods between 1849 and 1936 that moved Congress to pass legislation. The first significant federal flood control law was the Swamp Land Act of 1850. A flood on the Mississippi River in 1874 led to the creation of the Mississippi River Commission in 1879. Booming steamboat traffic on the Missouri River and a flood in 1881 led to the creation of the Missouri River Commission in 1884, but it was abolished by the River and Harbor Act of 1902. Floods on the Mississippi, Ohio, and other rivers in the Northeast led to the Flood Control Act of 1917, which was the first act aimed exclusively at controlling floods. The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 led to substantial flood control funding. And a series of floods in 1935 and 1936 across the nation were critical in the passage of the Flood Control Act of 1936. List of Flood Control Acts *Flood Control Act of 1917 *Flood Control Act of 1928, passed in the wake of the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. FCA 1928 had three important effects. It increased public awareness of advances in flood control theory and practice. It put flood control on par with other major projects of its time with the largest public works appropriation ever authorized. And, FCA 1928 increased debate on local contributions to a new level. *Flood Control Act of 1936. FCA 1936 was part of the profusion of important Depression Era legislation enacted by the 74th Congress in 1935‚Äì1936, including the Social Security Act, the National Labor Relations Act, the Banking Act of 1935, the Wealth Tax Act, the Public Utility Holding Company Act, the Rural Electrification Act, the Soil Conservation Service Act, and the $4.8 billion Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935. *Flood Control Act of 1937 *Flood Control Act of 1938 *Flood Control Act of 1939. FCA 1939 was instrumental in establishing the Federal policy of Cost-benefit analysis, the standard by which the government determines whether or not a project provides sufficient benefits to justify the cost of expending public funds. It specified the standard that \\"the benefits to whomever they accrue [be] in excess of the estimated costs. *Flood Control Act of 1941 *Flood Control Act of 1944, also known as the Pick‚ÄìSloan Flood Control Act of 1944. The Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota tribes lost . The Three Affiliated Tribes, specifically, lost in their Fort Berthold Reservation due to the building of the Garrison Dam. This project caused more than 1,500 American Indians to relocate from the river bottoms of the Missouri river due to the flooding. *Flood Control Act of 1946 *Flood Control Act of 1948. FCA 1948 gave the Chief of Engineers the power to authorize minor flood control projects without having to get Congressional approval. It also authorized several larger flood control projects and amended the budget set forth in the Flood Control Act of 1946. *Flood Control Act of 1950. The Act was prompted in part by floods that swept through the Columbia River watershed in 1948, destroying Vanport, then the second largest city in Oregon, and impacting cities as far north as Trail, British Columbia. By that time, local communities had become wary of federal hydroelectric projects, and sought local control of new developments; a Public Utility District in Grant County, Washington, ultimately began construction of the dam at Priest Rapids. *Flood Control Act of 1965. Prior to 1965, the state of Louisiana designed and built its flood protection through its levee boards. After Hurricane Betsy, Congress gave control of the flood protection to the US Army Corps of Engineers in the Act which called for a flood protection system to protect south Louisiana from the worst storms characteristic of the region. When Katrina struck in 2005, the project was between 60‚Äì90% complete and the projected date of completion was estimated to be 2015. The initial scope of the project was to provide hurricane protection to areas around the lake in the parishes of Orleans, Jefferson, St. Bernard, and St. Charles with the federal government paying 70 percent of the costs and the state and local interests paying 30 percent, the typical cost-share arrangement.

It was designed and built by the Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias (IAC) in Tenerife, Spain, in 1998. Its name comes from \\"COSMOlogical Structures On Medium Angular Scales\\" referring to CMB fluctuations. This experiment grew out experience of the previous Tenerife Experiment with the need to go to smaller angular scales with greater sensitivity. The experiment consists of two instruments, COSMO15 (three channels at 12.7, 14.7 and 16.3 GHz) and COSMO11 (two hands of linear polarization at 10.9 GHz). Both instruments are based on a circular scanning sky strategy, consisting of a 60 rpm spinning flat mirror directing the sky radiation into an off-axis paraboloidal antenna, whose size is 1.8-m in the COSMO15 and 2.4-m in the COSMO11. These antennas focus the radiation on to cryogenically cooled HEMT-based receivers, both at an operating temperature of 20K (-253 C) and in the frequency range of 10‚Äì12 GHz for COSMO11, and 12‚Äì18 GHz for COSMO15. In the COSMO15 instrument, the signal is split by a set of three filters, allowing simultaneous observations at 13, 15 and 17 GHz. Thus, four 1-degree resolution sky maps complete in right ascension and covering 20 degrees in declination are obtained every day at these frequencies. The most important result to come from this experiment is the cleanest detection of \\"spinning dust\\" in the Perseus molecular cloud. These are very small dust grains which can spin thousands of million times a second. If they have an asymmetrical electrical charge they can radiate like a lot of tiny dipole antennas. This cloud is very bright at infra-red wavelengths due to thermal emission from the large dust grains, but very little emission would be expected at microwave wavelengths by this type of dust. Instead there is a broad bump of signal centered on 22 GHz, a factor of 50 above the expected level of signal.

The active components of the Trinity test \\"gadget\\", a plutonium Fat Man-type bomb similar to that later dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, were assembled there on July 13, 1945. The completed bomb was winched up the test tower the following day and detonated on July 16, 1945 as the Trinity nuclear test. The McDonald Ranch House was built in 1913 by Franz Schmidt, a German immigrant, and acquired by the McDonald family in the 1930s. The ranch was vacated by the McDonald family under protest in 1942, when the United States Army took over the land as part of the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range to use in training bomber crews during World War II. The family hoped that the ranch would be returned after the war, but it was not, and in 1970, the Army announced that it would be kept permanently. The McDonald Ranch House was empty and deteriorating until 1982, when it was stabilized by the Army. In 1984 it was restored by the National Park Service to appear as it did on July 12, 1945. The site is now open to visitors twice a year, on the first Saturday in April and October.  Early history  The George McDonald Ranch House sits within an low stone wall. The house was built in 1913 by Franz Schmidt, a German immigrant, whose old house a mile away burned down in 1912. An addition was constructed on the north side by the McDonald family, who had moved into the area in the late 1870s or early 1880s, and acquired the ranch house in the 1930s. The ranch house is a one-story, building. It is built of adobe, which was plastered and painted. An ice house is located on the west side, along with an underground cistern which stored rain water running off the roof. At one time, the north addition contained a toilet and bathtub, which drained into a septic tank northwest of the house. There is a large, divided water storage tank and a Chicago Aermotor windmill east of the house. The scientists and support people used the north tank as a swimming pool during the summer of 1945. South of the windmill are the remains of a bunkhouse and a barn which was part garage. Further to the east are corrals and holding pens. The buildings and fixtures east of the house have been stabilized to prevent further deterioration. The ranch was vacated by the McDonald family under protest in 1942, when the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range took over the land to use in training bomber crews during World War II. Area lands were condemned and ranchers simply told to leave. The occupants were given the option of going to court or accepting a settlement, but had to leave in either case. The McDonalds chose to go to court, and were awarded about $60,000 for their patented land.  Manhattan Project  Sergeant Herbert Lehr, whose informal dress reflects the McDonald House's sweltering conditions in July 1945, delivered the plutonium core for the bomb in a shock-mounted carrying case thumbright Vital Components are loaded at the old McDonald Ranch for the trip to the test site The house stood empty until the Manhattan Project support personnel arrived in early 1945. The northeast room (the master bedroom) was designated the assembly room. Workbenches and tables were installed. To keep dust and sand out of instruments and tools, the windows were covered with plastic. Tape was used to fasten the edges of the plastic and to seal doors and cracks in the walls. The plutonium hemispheres for the pit of the Trinity nuclear test \\"gadget\\" (bomb) were delivered to the McDonald Ranch House on July 11, 1945. Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell, the Deputy Director of the Manhattan Project, signed for them, and handed them over to Louis Slotin, the head of the Pit Assembly Team. The active components of the bomb were assembled in the assembly room on July 13, 1945, The bomb was winched up the test tower the following day. The Trinity test occurred on July 16, 1945. A plutonium Fat Man-type bomb was detonated, similar to the bomb later dropped on Nagasaki. The explosion only away blew most of the home's windows out but did not significantly damage the structure; years of rain water intrusion through the roof were responsible for decades of subsequent deterioration. The barn roof was bowed inward by the blast and some of its roofing was blown away; it collapsed some time thereafter.  1960s‚Äì1980s  On December 21, 1965, the Trinity Site was declared a National Historic Landmark district, and and, on October 15, 1966, the McDonald House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The McDonalds had expected that the ranch would be returned after the war, but this did not occur. In the 1970s it was announced that the land would not be returned. Dave McDonald and his niece, Mary McDonald, staged an armed reoccupation of the ranch in protest in 1982. The house stood empty and deteriorating until 1982. White Sands Missile Range commander United States Army Major General Niles J. Fulwyler, who had directed the restoration of the White Sands V-2 Launching Site, ordered the structure stabilized to prevent any further damage. Shortly after, Fulwyler acquired funding from the Department of Energy and the Army for the National Park Service to completely restore the house to the way it appeared on July 12, 1945. Work was completed in 1984. Fulwyler buried a 25-year time capsule describing the restoration. It was opened during an open house on October 3, 2009. Its artifacts are now in display inside the home. On the back of a photograph of himself Fulwyler wrote: ::: Access For many years the site was open on the first Saturday in April and October. Admission is free. There is a display on the Schmidt family in the house during each open house. In 2014, the White Sands Missile Range announced that due to budgetary constraints, the site would only be open once a year, on the first Saturday in April. In 2015, this decision was reversed, and two events were scheduled, in April and October.

There are two versions, one shorter and one longer, which are in modern editions usually printed as one saga. The authors of both versions are unknown. There are indications that both of them were Icelanders, although this cannot be said for certain. The Bagler Sagas occur during the Civil war era in Norway. The sagas deal with the reigns of the birkebeiner kings Haakon Sverresson, Guttorm Sigurdsson and Inge Baardsson, and the bagler pretenders to the Norwegian throne Erling Steinvegg and Philippus Simonsson. The sagas pick up the story where Sverris saga leaves off, at the death of King Sverre in 1202. The older, and shorter, version ends with the wedding of Philippus in 1209. The later and longer version, also continues the story until the death of King Inge in 1217. The older version is neutral in its depiction of events, without a clear bias for either birkebeiner or bagler. It was probably written not long after the point where it leaves off, in 1209. The newer version was probably written by someone who wanted to expand the older version with more material about the birkebeiner, and continue the story to cover all of Inge's reign. It was probably written no later than the early 1220s. The author of this later version is clearly on the side of the birkebeiner, and shows personal sympathies for king Inge, also in his disputes with his brother, earl Haakon the Crazy (H√•kon Galen).

Andronikos Palaiologos was a son of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos and his wife Helena Draga≈°. His maternal grandfather was the Serb prince Constantine Draga≈°. His brothers included emperors John VIII Palaiologos and Constantine XI Palaiologos, as well as Theodore II Palaiologos, Demetrios Palaiologos and Thomas Palaiologos, who ruled as despots in Morea. In childhood Andronikos survived the sickness which killed his older brother Constantine and two sisters. He never recovered in full, remaining in poor health for the rest of his life, eventually developing leprosy. When he was only eight years old his father made him a despot (despotƒìs) and appointed him imperial representative in Thessalonica, where he succeeded his deceased cousin John VII Palaiologos. As he was still a minor, for the first years of his rule there, until ca. 1415/1416, he was under the tutorship of the general Demetrios Laskaris Leontares. After John VIII assumed control of the imperial government in 1421, the Byzantine Empire faced an increasingly hostile Ottoman Empire. Constantinople was attacked by the Ottomans in 1422, and Thessalonica was subject to a long blockade in 1422-1423\\\\. Under siege, and increasingly unwell, Andronikos began diplomatic initiatives for the surrender of the city to the Republic of Venice. These negotiations resulted (although he did not have the support of the whole of the population, and was opposed by the church, which mistrusted the Latins), in a Venetian force entering the city in 1423. The handing over of Thessalonica to Venice contributed to the outbreak of the first in a series of wars between Venice and the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans conquered Thessalonica in 1430. His fate after the surrender of Thessalonica is obscure, with conflicting accounts in the sources. The contemporary Venetian Morosini Codex mentions a conspiracy led by Andronikos to surrender Thessalonica to the Turks. The plot was discovered in November 1423, and Andronikos and his supporters were exiled, with the Despot sent to Nauplia in the Morea, and his supporters to Siteia in Crete, Andros, and other places. According to the Greek scholar Apostolos Vakalopoulos, this conspiracy may be identical to the imprisonment of four leading aristocrats, led by a certain Platyskalites, for their association with the Ottomans, as reported by the Byzantine historian Doukas. The four men were exiled, first to Crete, and then to Venice itself and Padua. The Byzantine sources do not mention Andronikos' involvement in a conspiracy, and record different fates for him: Laonikos Chalkokondyles records that he went to Mantineia in the Morea, where he died; Theodore Spandounes writes that he sailed for Venice but died during the journey; Sphrantzes claims that he became a monk in the Pantokrator Monastery in Constantinople, where he died in 1429 and was buried next to his father; a number of other sources, including Pseudo-Sphrantzes, claim that he became a monk in Mount Athos, specifically the Vatopedi Monastery, where he died.

The Breslov movement was founded by Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, who died in 1810. Rebbe Nachman's closest disciple, Nathan of Breslov (also known as \\"Reb Noson\\"), shaped and shepherded the movement until his own death in 1844. Reb Nachman Chazan, Reb Noson's closest disciple, then assumed leadership of the movement, guaranteeing the existence and growth of the Hasidut for another 40 years. Chazan, whose grandfather was a follower of Rebbe Nachman, was born three years after the Rebbe's death and was named after him. He was orphaned as a child and was raised by his uncle in Tulchyn, Ukraine. There, in 1822, he met Reb Noson as the latter was passing through on his pilgrimage to Israel. Reb Noson made such a deep impression on the 9-year-old boy that he decided to be close to him forever. When he grew up, Chazan became Reb Noson's closest disciple. He moved to the town of Breslov, where Reb Noson had resided, and lived there for 18 years. Then he moved to Uman, Ukraine, the city in which Rebbe Nachman is buried, and lived there for another 18 years. This latter move shifted the focus of the movement away from the town of Breslov and onto the town of Uman, where it remains focused to this day. Chazan was an extremely modest man whose actions belied his greatness in scholarship and spiritual devotions. He served as the shammes (sexton) of the Breslover synagogue in Uman and regularly filled the water buckets for the benefit of other worshipers. In recognition of his leadership, however, he was accorded the honor of leading the prayers at the annual Rosh Hashana kibbutz in Uman. His family name, Chazan, is derived from his position as chazzan (cantor) for those services. Chazan's son, Rabbi Abraham Chazan, became one of the leading figures in the Breslov community after his father's death in 1884. Publications Chazan published the first volume of Reb Noson's magnum opus, Likutey Halachot, while the latter was still alive. After Reb Noson's death, Chazan edited and published the remaining seven volumes of this work.  References  * Kramer, Chaim (1989). Crossing the Narrow Bridge. Appendix C: Breslov Biographies.

He was widely seen as the outstanding violinist of his time and one of Niccol√≤ Paganini's greatest successors. He was a highly esteemed artist in his day. Many saw him as the superior violinist of his time and Paganini's greatest successor. Not only did he contribute to polyphonic playing, but he also discovered new idiomatic ways to compose polyphonically conceived violin music. His friends included Hector Berlioz and Felix Mendelssohn. Biography Ernst was born in Brno, Moravia on 8 June 1812.M. W. Rowe, Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst: Virtuoso Violinist, Ashgate (2008), p. 20.Most articles concerning Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst say he was born on 6 May 1814. Mark W. Rowe, in his 2008 work, concluded that this date could not be correct. The pressure, as a prodigy, to be young, coupled with the absence of a birth certificate and unreliability of the marriage certificate, makes Rowe think that Ernst was actually born on 8 June 1812, and was therefore nearly two years older than is normally thought. At the age of 9, he began to study violin. Ernst was a child prodigy, educated at the Vienna Conservatory of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, studying violin under Joseph B√∂hm, starting in 1825, and Joseph Mayseder, and composition under Ignaz von Seyfried. In 1828, Niccol√≤ Paganini visited Vienna. Ernst heard him and was deeply impressed by his violin playing. It's said that Ernst then played for Paganini who predicted a brilliant career for him. Paganini gave 14 concerts in Vienna, and Ernst attended many of these to observe the master. In April 1829, Ernst left Vienna for Munich for an employment in the royal orchestra, but Paganini advised him to aim for something higher. After that, Ernst played concerts in the same cities as Paganini. These concerts were appreciated, but he still stood in Paganini's shadow. This depressed him to the degree that he locked himself into his room for five days. Later in Frankfurt in the spring of 1830, Ernst met Paganini again. There, Ernst gave a concert where he played Paganini's Nel cor p√¨√π non mi sento with an accuracy that stunned both the audience and Paganini himself. This work, as with most of Paganini's compositions, was unpublished at that time, which meant that Ernst must have learned it by ear at Paganini's concerts. Some days after, Ernst visited Paganini, who was sitting composing on his guitar. Paganini immediately rose up, threw the manuscript under the bed sheet, and said that he had to protect his composition not only from Ernst's ears, but also his eyes.Fan Elun, The life and works of Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst (1814‚Äì1865) with emphasis on his reception as violinist and composer, Cornell University (1993), p. x. In the following years, Ernst made several tours through France. When he heard that Paganini was to play concerts in Marseille in January 1837, he went there to hear his master again. Ernst was determined to learn the secrets of Paganini's complex technique. With help from relatives of his secretary, he rented a room next to Paganini's. He hid there day and night, listening to Paganini rehearse and writing down what he heard. That must have been difficult, because Paganini did not practice much during his tours, and when he did, he used a mute. Ernst also managed, secretly, to attend all of Paganini's rehearsals in Marseille in pursuit of his goal. He too played concerts in Marseille and managed to get these and the concerts Paganini played to become some sort of competition between the two. He tried to organize two concerts before Paganini arrived, and these concerts were well appreciated by the audience. Then, when Paganini was about to play his first concert, the demands on him were greater because of the comparison to Ernst's playing. Paganini couldn't meet the demands of the audience who thought that Ernst's playing had spoken more to the heart. Paganini then organized another concert and challenged the audience by playing his Mo√Øses, variations on the G string, moving some to tears. After that concert, opinions were divided. Some said Paganini mastered the difficulties better, but Ernst played with more sentiment. Ernst learned this composition through the wall from his room next to Paganini. Perhaps out of respect for Paganini, Ernst later composed his own set of variations on the theme Carnaval de Venise, which he often played at the end of his concert. He also used scordatura in the same manner as Paganini did in his variations. This piece was most popular among Ernst's audience everywhere where he played, and it became his signature. All his professional life, he was on tour around Europe playing concerts and also composed many violin pieces and formed his own style. One piece, Elegie, Opus 10, is mentioned in Chapter 23 of the Leo Tolstoy novella, \\"The Kreutzer Sonata,\\" where it follows Beethoven's sonata in the crucial concert at the Pozdnyshev home. Ernst also played the viola. He performed the solo viola part of Berlioz's Harold en Italie multiple times, the first in September 1842 in Brussels under the direction of the composer. After 1844 he lived chiefly in England. He joined the Beethoven Quartet Society in London, where he chiefly played Beethoven String quartets with Joseph Joachim, Henryk Wieniawski and Carlo Alfredo Piatti. In 1862, his health failed from neuralgia of a most severe kind, which made him unable to play. He spent the last seven years of his life in retirement, chiefly in Nice, where he spent time composing, e.g., the Polyphonic Studies, Othello-Fantasie and Concerto path√©tique in F-sharp minor, Op. 23. Today, his most widely performed composition is the sixth and last of his Polyphonic Studies, \\"Die letzte Rose\\", an infamously difficult set of variations on the Irish folk melody to which Thomas Moore's poem \\"The Last Rose of Summer\\" is usually set. Ernst died in Nice on 8 October 1865.

Meaning: the souls and the body  The nefesh is found in all humans, and enters the physical body at birth. It is the source of one's physical and psychological nature. The next two parts of the soul are not implanted at birth, but can be developed over time; their development depends on the actions and beliefs of the individual. They are said to only fully exist in people awakened spiritually. A common way of explaining the three parts of the soul is as follows: * Nefesh (◊†◊§◊©): the lower part, or \\"animal part\\", of the soul. It is linked to instincts and bodily cravings. This part of the soul is provided at birth. (primary place: liver) The Chassidut teaches that it is possible to make holy even daily habits, such as eating and working. * Ruach (◊®◊ï◊ó): the middle soul, the \\"spirit\\". It contains the moral virtues and the ability to distinguish between good and evil. (primary place: heart) ‚ÄúKnowing heart‚Äù‚Äî a heart that knows that whatever happens in the world comes from God.Rebbe Nachman of Breslov. REBBE NACHMAN'S TORAH: NUMBERS - DEUTERONOMY - Breslov Insights into the Weekly Torah Reading Breslov Research Institute, Jerusalem/New York * Neshamah (◊†◊©◊û◊î): the higher soul, or \\"super-soul\\". This separates man from all other life-forms. It is related to the intellect and allows man to enjoy and benefit from the afterlife. It allows one to have some awareness of the existence and presence of God. (primary place: brain) The initiation for the Kohen Gadol Aaron occurred in fact starting from the head.Pentateuch According to Ramchal and Arizal, God is the \\"First Cause\\" for life of the souls: the spiritual force or quantity and quality of the souls are performed by divine grace and light.  Mode and quality: good and peace  One of the ways of the soul is the good. Just as the goodness of human beings derives from the good, we can also say that love is the decisive consequence. In fact, Maimonides affirms that God supports with the good the one who loves the Torah and the Mitzvot with faith for the Tzaddikim and therefore for God. From this we deduce therefore that the good, the goodness and the love are different levels of same source: the peace. The Zohar admits, however, that all souls are in any case spread throughout the body, so it is easy to deduce their main faculties are the good, the life and the other modalities of Sefirot: The Hebrew Bible tells of the pact of peace between God and the Jewish people, this is possible with the messianic era already prophecy for Elijah: \\"goodness has arrived in the world, peace has arrived in the world, redemption has come to the world\\". As is already known in Jewish philosophy but not only, peace is both a \\"cosmic condition\\" and an inner and collective way, it is therefore the quality of the soul; considering therefore that the soul and the body are close in a bond of life, the principle of the perception of peace is acceptable. This theory allows us to believe and have faith also in the Gemilut Hasidim and in the theological process of \\"reward in Olam Haba\\":  Ruach haKodesh: the holy spirit  Ruach HaKodesh is one of levels of prophecy; the Way of MiddotThe first foundation of the Way of Middot consists in the physical-spiritual balance of pleasure: each desire has its root in the desire of faith for God, thereby referring to prayer itself and the study of the Torah; the Middots however offer the devotee the possibility of not being continually guilty and tense to original sin, when the desire then \\"confused\\" discernment and awareness. Taking on the Way of Middot therefore means freeing oneself from lust, indulgence, gluttony, immorality and every vice inherent in the temptation for sin. R. Meir was in the habit of saying: Put your heart and soul into learning My ways [i.e., study the Torah for its own sake], and watch at the doors of My Torah [i.e., study with single-minded determination], guard My Torah in your heart, and keep My fear before your eyes. Keep your mouth from all sin, cleanse and sanctify yourself from all sin and transgression, then I will be with you wherever you are (Avraham Yaakov Finkel. EIN YAAKOV THE ETHICAL AND INSPIRATIONAL TEACHINGS OF THE TALMUD compiled in the sixteenth century by RABBI YAAKOV IBN CHAVIV Jason Aronson Book 2004) can direct to Ruach HaKodesh with the Sefirot of Khokhmah, Binah and Da'at. Ruach HaKodesh is also the misure of peace, meditation and speaking: Having established the bond of the soul-body foundation, Kabbalah goes further: the four mineral, vegetable, animal and human realms exist; Jewish theology teaches that when the body presents an imbalance between these, it has negative consequences as much as the soul. On the other hand, when the soul does not adhere to the supernal realms, for example through faith in God then through prayer and the study of the Torah, it is lacking in vigor thus causing deficiencies in the body as well. In the same way this can be compared in concordance with the theory of Four elements. Therefore there are many temperaments, including equally numerous even among balanced ones. A decrease in the strength of the soul and its presence or not in the same individual at different times other than death, is absolutely not foreign to Jewish mysticism; in addition to the super-soul of the Shabbat, to the spiritual elevation with the other Jewish festival or with wedding and in the course of existence in this world, it is a concept also present in the scriptures: for example in the Tehillim 51,12 King David reports the request to God so that he can create in him \\"a pure heart by renewing a permanent Ruach\\". In addition to indicating the various vicissitudes or difficulties of spiritual existence - Jewish theology on the seven falls of Tzadik is well known - this reveals the importance of transforming itself better and better by increasing in wisdom and in the bond with God, the Torah and the rest of the Jewish people.  Kabbalah  Shekhnah could have been seen by all persons in Jewish people but Moses and Aaron had had this merit also for other Jewish brothers: a cause of revelation of Shiloh the Mashiach, all people will see the Glory of God. = Chassidut = The Tzaddik is precisely the Mashiach: he, thanks to the revelation of the divine presence, allows all the Jewish people to approach spiritual experience with greater ease; therefore the soul of the Jews \\"dresses\\" in Mitzvot and Torah, of which the Tzaddik is the undisputed guide. Any Jew who wants to rise by strengthening his soul, if he feels the need, will be able to establish a bond with Tzaddik and therefore will be able to strengthen faith in God. The soul can therefore ennoble and elevate the body, even during existence in this world. Without reaching high levels of faith and devotion, the body would remain \\"ignorant\\" about the soul's faculties; what does this mean? Thanks to true faith, devout persons can reach the perception of their own soul, through the knowledge of good, mercy, goodness and peace precisely within themselves. These values of the soul can \\"auto-reveal\\" by growing and increasing in quantity and quality only in a life dedicated to Avodah for God. In the Kabbalah of the Chassidut the soul is compared to oil: the oil in the water\\"Water\\" is the metaphor of Chessed (Sefirah of Mercy) but oil is the symbol of light and soul: we see this important element on Jewish Holiday of Chanukkah is not confused with it, so is the spiritual nature with excellent essence cannot and must not be degraded, instead of maintaining its own Kedushah. = Jewish philosophy = As can be found in Gabirol, finally God created the different creatures of the world in addition to the different species and the various elements present here, with \\"pre-ordered\\" specificities: this means that the most \\"internal\\" peculiar nature of everything is revealed also externally, as can therefore be verified through the senses; so also human beings have different characteristics besides the nature of their bodies, we would even say of the \\"substance of their bodies\\" was determined with reference to their essence precisely: that is the soul. = \\"Eternal soul\\" = In Jewish Kabbalah there is the theory according to which God only existed before creation: God subsequently formed the light (Ohr), the potentiality for creation and finally forged the souls of living beings, moreover as well as giving existence to angelic creatures; according to this perspective, the eternal nature of the soul is an axiom that holds true as a \\"paradigm\\" of its celestial essence. = The \\"accidents\\" in the Guide of the perplexed = Maimonides admits that the link between soul and body entails what he calls \\"accidents\\": the life of the body in fact entails what is desirable and what is unnecessary; the same impurity of the decomposing body, as described both in the written Torah and in the Talmud, it seems to be due in fact to the previous link with the soul: every body of any deceased individual among human beings is impure... From this we deduce that life in its highest excellence and the physical-spiritual purity coincide perfectly. Obviously \\"accidents\\" are not related to impurity in all their cases, however an example among all attests to the truthfulness of what theorized by Maim√≥nides according to sacred texts: \\"the manna did not produce feces\\", so transmitted indicates that it was of \\"celestial origin\\" and therefore not subject to \\"corruption\\". The textual reference is Bereshit Rabbah: the name \\"Adam\\", the first man created on Earth, also derives from the Hebrew word Adam√† which means precisely \\"earth\\", so according to the tradition Adam and Eve [in their bodies] it was also forged from the earth. = The letters of the Torah = The Kabbalah on the Hebrew alphabet suggests that the letters of the Torah are like souls and bodies. For example, the Hebrew letter YOD, the simplest in shape, resembles a soul and often the Hebrew letter VAV is compared to the body, in fact it stands tall; on the other hand, since these are two letters of the Divine Tetragrammaton, the other letters are also almost built on these two and can thus be included in the aforementioned teaching.

During the Iran‚ÄìContra affair, he served as an associate counsel in the Department of Justice, and moved from government into writing during the 1990s. Toobin has written several books, including an account of the O. J. Simpson murder case. That book was adapted as a TV series, The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story, which aired in 2016 as the first season of FX American Crime Story; it won nine Emmy Awards. Early life and education Toobin was born to a Jewish family in New York City in 1960, the son of Marlene Sanders, former ABC News and CBS News correspondent, and Jerome Toobin, a news broadcasting producer.Jewish Ledger (Connecticut edition): Cindy Mindell, \\"Q & A with... Marlene Sanders - Award-winning woman pioneer in broadcasting\\", August 20, 2010 Toobin attended Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School, and then Harvard College for undergraduate studies. He covered sports for The Harvard Crimson, where his column was titled \\"Inner Toobin\\". Toobin graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in American History and Literature, and was awarded a Harry S. Truman Scholarship. He then attended Harvard Law School, where he was classmates with Elena Kagan and graduated magna cum laude with a J.D. in 1986. While there, he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. Career Toobin promoting his book The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court at the 2007 Texas Book Festival Toobin began freelancing for The New Republic while a law student. After passing the bar, he worked as a law clerk to a federal judge and then as an associate counsel for Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh during the Iran‚ÄìContra affair and Oliver North's criminal trial. He next served as an Assistant United States Attorney in Brooklyn. Toobin wrote a book about his work in the Office of Independent Counsel, to which Walsh objected. Toobin went to court to affirm his right to publish. Judge John F. Keenan of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York wrote an opinion that Toobin and his publisher had the right to release this book. Walsh's appeal of the case was dismissed by the court. After three years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, Toobin resigned from the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn, where he had gone to work after working for Walsh, and abandoned \\"the practice of law.\\" He started working in 1993 at The New Yorker and became a television legal analyst for ABC in 1996. Toobin has provided broadcast legal analysis on many high-profile cases. In 1994, Toobin broke the story in The New Yorker that the legal team in O. J. Simpson's criminal trial planned to accuse Mark Fuhrman of planting evidence. Toobin provided analysis of Michael Jackson's 2005 child molestation trial, the O. J. Simpson civil case, and prosecutor Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Bill Clinton. He received a 2000 Emmy Award for his coverage of the Eli√°n Gonz√°lez custody saga.

CNN said Toobin \\"has asked for some time off while he deals with a personal issue, which we have granted.\\" Toobin issued a statement saying \\"I made an embarrassingly stupid mistake, believing I was off-camera. I apologize to my wife, family, friends and co-workers.\\" Personal life  Toobin in 2017 In 1986, Toobin married Amy Bennett McIntosh, whom he met in college while they worked at the Harvard Crimson.

It celebrates the day the country gained independence from the United Kingdom on 21 September 1964. Throughout its existence, Malta had a long and complex history which resulted in the island being ruled by a plethora of foreign rulers. Such rulers include the likes of the ‚ÄúPhoenicians, Romans, Greeks, Arabs, Normans, Sicilians, Swabians, Aragonese, Hospitallers, French, and British‚Äù. Malta's final ruler, Britain, granted Malta self-governance after Malta's brave resistance to the Axis powers and loyalty to Britain during World War Two, which did allow for the movement for independence to grow more in popularity. Malta attained independence from the British Empire and joined the Commonwealth of Nations in 1964 and declared itself a republic a decade later, known as Republic Day. The Maltese people greatly celebrate the occasion with many activities and ceremonies. The number of activities change every year, but there won't ever be a shortage of them. ‚ÄúThere are numerous parades, festivals, musical performances, and cultural events all over the island of Malta and the smaller island of Gozo‚Äù. Every Sunday during the months of March to December, the ‚ÄúIn Guardia Parades‚Äù, a series of historical re-enactments of past battles by veteran reenactors, is played. Background Independence Monument representing Malta liberating herself from shackles of the past while holding onto the national flag Malta has been an area of interest, for its strategic location in the Mediterranean Sea, since classical times. The island allowed for great international trade and a militarily strategic location, the island was wonderful for navies to stop and rest and it was a great base for military assaults from the air and the sea. The island's longest ruler was the Knights of St. John, who controlled the island for 250 years. The Knights lost their control of the island after an invasion by French forces led by Napoleon. Napoleon's fleet was en route to invade Egypt and beyond, but needed a place to rest beforehand. Malta refused Napoleon's request to harbour at its islands, but he was not going to let his invasion fail at the fault of the small island-state so he invaded and seized control of the island. While Malta might have been taken through force, the French did not treat them wrongly. France established many reforms that reflected that of the French Revolution, such as ending the remaining feudalistic policies, building and founding many schools, and abolishing slavery. Despite this, the people of Malta saw those policies as excessive for the locals were \\"largely dominated by [and loyal to] two institutions: the aristocracy and the Church.\\" The Maltese people revolted against the French in response to the policies enacted by France in the occupation of 1799. The French had also been plundering art and national treasures belonging to Malta and taking them back to France, such as the sword belonging to Grandmaster Jean Parisot de la Vallette. During this time, the French had been at war with the British, hence why Napoleon was headed for British-owned Egypt. So when the Maltese resistance attempted to retake their capital of Valletta and failed, they turned to Britain for help. Britain accepted Malta's plea for help since France was Britain's nemesis. With famous Admiral Lord Nelson, British forces blockaded the island and took it in 1800. Britain incorporated Malta into their empire, and in 1869, Malta would become famous for its use as a halfway stop between British Gibraltar and the newly opened Suez Canal. The island would then be built up as a fortress and made into the home the British Mediterranean fleet. A century later would have the Second World War occur. Being the home of the British fleet in the Mediterranean, the Axis powers would try repeatedly to either destroy or control the island. This devastated Malta, but the island never gave in. Their stern resistance against the Nazis and Fascist Italians was rewarded by the British, who both gave the people of Malta the George Cross and promised to give the Maltese people independence. A small amount of local rule was given in 1947, though it wasn't until 21 September 1964 that full independence came. Malta became a republic a decade later and British forces finally left the country after the defence treaty expired on 31 March 1979, which is celebrated as ‚ÄúFreedom Day‚Äù.

Post-war experimental rectangular waxy blocks became available with greater waterproofing abilities but after 1954 Joseph Pickering & Sons Ltd introduced a tinned paste product that didn't need the addition of water and could be applied directly from the tin.

However he found an inclination to play bass and this led him to play the bass guitar for a number of Hillsong Worship albums instead. = Hillsong United and Hillsong = Houston's debut with the Hillsong United as a vocalist was in 2002, however he had been playing bass guitar with the band for several years prior to this, and contributing various songs, including the title track from the group's debut full-length live album, Everyday. As part of Hillsong United music team, Joel Houston has helped lead worship conferences in North America, South America, Africa, Europe and Asia. He has also contributed to the main Hillsong album recordings as well, which are led by worship pastor Reuben Morgan. Many of the songs he has written or co-written are sung in churches worldwide and have been translated into 32 languages. His music has been featured on Hillsong albums that have quickly risen on both the Australian and American Christian music charts. In March 2007, Hillsong United's eighth album All of the Above debuted at No. 6 on the ARIA charts. Joel Houston has been the creative director of Hillsong since 2008. Joel is currently co-pastor of Hillsong NYC with Carl Lentz. = Personal life = Joel married Brazilian model Esther Lima in 2012 and had a son, Zion, in 2013.

History The Treaty of Fort Harmar was signed at Fort Harmar, near present-day Marietta, Ohio, on January 9, 1789. Representatives of the Iroquois Six Nations and other groups, including the Wyandot, Delaware, Ottawa, Chippewa, Potawatomi and Sauk met with Arthur St. Clair, the governor of the Northwest Territory, and other American leaders such as Josiah Harmar and Richard Butler. The treaty was supposed to address issues remaining since the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix and the 1785 Treaty of Fort McIntosh; but, the new agreement did little more than reiterate the terms of those two previous documents with a few minor changes. The negotiations and document failed to address the most important grievances of the tribes, namely, the settlement of New Englanders in the Firelands portions of the Western Reserve, an area that extended into the territory set aside for the tribes. Governor Arthur St. Clair had been authorized by Congress and Secretary of War Henry Knox to offer back some lands reserved for American settlement in exchange for the disputed Firelands of the Western Reserve. St. Clair refused to give up these lands and instead, through threats and bribery, negotiated a treaty that simply reiterated the terms of previous treaties. Many Native American leaders met prior to the treaty negotiations to determine an appropriate strategy. Joseph Brant offered a compromise position which moved the boundary line to the Muskingum River. Some hardline leaders rejected Brant's compromise, so Brant sent St. Clair a letter asking for early concessions; St. Clair refused, and accused Brant of acting for the British. Brant decided to boycott negotiations with the United States, and suggested others do the same. To make matters worse, white settler Lewis Wetzel murdered Seneca Chief Tegunteh on his way to Fort Harmar. (Wetzel was twice arrested for his crimes, but never otherwise punished.) Several regional tribes, such as the Shawnee and Miami, refused to participate when St. Clair refused to attend or sign the treaty, and therefore refused to abide by the treaty. The new treaty did almost nothing to stop the rash of violence along the frontier from confrontations between settlers and Indians. Many native nations were infuriated at the treaty, which recognized native rights to sell their lands, while claiming U.S. sovereignty and forcing native tribes to sell their lands immediately. The failure of the treaty led to an escalation of the Northwest Indian War as a new Western Confederacy fought against settlement and invasion from the United States. The war would continue for six years and see thousands killed, including some of the worst defeats in U.S. Army history, until the United States defeated the tribal alliance at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. In the 1795 Treaty of Greenville, the tribes were forced to give up claims to most of what is now the state of Ohio. This treaty divided the Northwest Territory into two parts; one for the Native Americans and one for the United States settlers.

In the Book of Ether in the Book of Mormon, Jared was the primary ancestor of the Jaredites. He is not to be confused with another Jared, a later Jaredite king who dethroned his father, Omer. Biblical Jared The Book of Mormon Jared has the same name as the biblical patriarch Jared ( Y√©re·∏è, in pausa YƒÅÃÅre·∏è, \\"to descend\\"),The etymology \\"to descend\\" is according to in the Book of Genesis, who was the sixth in the ten pre-flood generations between Adam and Noah; he was the son of Mahalaleel and the father of Enoch, and lived 962 years (Genesis 5:18). The biblical text in Jubilees implicitly etymologizes the name as derived from the root YRD \\"descend\\", because in his days \\"the angels of the Lord descended to earth\\".Fitzmyer, Joseph A. The Genesis Apocryphon of Qumran Cave 1 (1Q20): A Commentary (2004), p. 139. Alternative suggestions for the name's etymology include words for \\"rose\\" and for \\"servant\\".Hess, Richard S., Studies in the personal names of Genesis 1-11 (1993), p. 69. The biblical Jared was a sixth-generation descendant of Adam and Eve. His primary history is recounted in , thus within the timeline of the Book of Mormon, he would have been antediluvian and an ancestor of the Jared of Ether. Migration According to the narrative Jared, along with family and friends came to the \\"promised land\\" (the Americas) shortly after the Great Tower Tower of Babel. When the language of the people was confounded, Jared asked his brother to ask God not to confound their own language, that of their friends, and that of their immediate families. This means that they arrived much earlier than Lehi and Nephi and their families did. The Brother of Jared, often referred to as such in the text, and also called Mahonri Moriancumer is also a significant character. Jared's group, the ancestors of the Jaredites, were guided through the wilderness by God, and then fled across the ocean on unusual barges and established an ancient civilization in the Americas. They also brought with them animals and food. The recorded length of the miraculous trip was 344 days. The Book of Ether's mention of a \\"narrow neck of land\\" has led some to posit various locations for their point of arrival. Some of these include \\"necks of land\\" in Central America or modern-day Mexico. Others favor a location which spanned from the Midwest to the Eastern United States such as New York. However, neither of these are certain, and are not supported by mainstream archeology. Mormon apologists link this story to various traditions similar to that of the tower of Babel said to be found in Central America. Some writers connected the Great Pyramid of Cholula to the Tower of Babel. The Dominican friar Diego Dur√°n (1537‚Äì1588) reported hearing an account about the pyramid from a hundred-year-old priest at Cholula, shortly after the conquest of Mexico. He wrote that he was told when the light of the sun first appeared upon the land, giants appeared and set off in search of the sun. Not finding it, they built a tower to reach the sky. An angered Lord of the Heavens called upon the inhabitants of the sky, who destroyed the tower and scattered its inhabitants. The story was not related to either a flood or the confusion of languages, although Frazer connects its construction and the scattering of the giants with the Tower of Babel. Another story, attributed by the native historian Fernando de Alva Cort√©s Ixtlilx√≥chitl (c. 1565‚Äì1648) to the ancient Toltecs, states that after men had multiplied following a great deluge, they erected a tall zacuali or tower, to preserve themselves in the event of a second deluge. However, their languages were confounded and they went to separate parts of the earth. Question of succession As death was approaching Jared and his brother, Mahonri Moriancumer, gathered together the people to ask them what they desired of them before they died. The people then requested that they anoint one of their sons as king. This was grievous to them, and the Mahonri Moriancumer remarked that \\"surely this thing leadeth into captivity.\\" Ether 6:23 Despite Mahonri's misgivings, Jared pressed him to allow the establishment of a Jaredite kingship at which suggestion the brother of Jared yielded.Ether 6:24 Family References Category:Book of Mormon people Category:Tower of Babel ","title":"Jared (founder of Jaredites)"},{"id":"2620311","text":"State Highway 114 (SH 114) is a state highway that runs from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex westward across Texas to the state border with New Mexico, where it becomes New Mexico State Road 114, which eventually ends at Elida, New Mexico at US 70 / NM 330\\\\. History left The route was originally designated on April 14, 1926 as connector between Dallas and Rhome. In June 1932, SH 114 was extended to Bridgeport. On February 12, 1935, an extension northward from Chico to Sunset was added. On July 15, 1935, the section from Chico to Sunset was cancelled. This section was restored on August 1, 1938. On October 6, 1943, the section of SH 114 from US 77 in Dallas to US 67 was cancelled. On October 1, 1968, the concurrency with SH 24 from Bridgeport to Chico was removed because SH 24 (now US 380) was rerouted. On January 7, 1971, SH 114 was relocated in Bridgeport. This route remained little changed until November 3, 1972, when it was extended northward from Sunset to Bowie. Major rerouting was made on November 24, 1975, when the route was redirected west over U.S. Highway 380, U.S. Highway 281, former SH 199, and U.S. Highway 82 from Bridgeport to Lubbock, with the stretch from Bridgeport to Bowie renumbered as SH 101. On December 14, 1977, the route was extended to the New Mexico border, replacing SH 116. The connecting NM 116 was renumbered to NM 114. On August 2, 1985, Delta Air Lines Flight 191 crossed this route shortly before crashing on approach to Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. One of the aircraft's engines struck a car on the roadway, instantly killing its occupant; 136 people on the flight also died in the accident. In 2010, work began on a stretch, dubbed the DFW Connector, between SH 121 and International Parkway. A quarter of the $1 billion project was funded by federal stimulus funds enacted under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The project's aim was ease congestion at North Texas' worst traffic problem. The project called for as many as 24 lanes and 2 TEXpress lanes along a mile stretch between SH 26 and International Parkway. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) awarded the project in a joint venture led by Kiewit. The SH 114 section of the DFW Connector was completed in 2014.  Route description  Highway 114 starts at the New Mexico border about 17 miles west of Morton, Texas. The route passes through Whiteface, Levelland, and Smyer as Levelland Highway before joining 19th Street in Lubbock. SH 114 crosses over Loop 289 and while crossing over US 82 joins with US 62, forming the southern edge of the Texas Tech University campus. After crossing US 84, the highway veers northeast, joining US 82 before crossing over Loop 289 and leaving Lubbock as Idalou Road. Past Lubbock, SH 114 passes through the rural towns of Idalou, Lorenzo, Ralls (where US 62 turns north), Crosbyton, Dickens, Guthrie, Benjamin, Vera, Red Springs, and Seymour, where US 82 splits north off of SH 114. From there, the highway passes through Megargal, Olney, Loving, and Jermyn before entering Jacksboro with US 281. In Jacksboro, SH 114 joins US 380 and US 281 splits off to the south as SH 114 continues east. Past Jacksboro, SH 114 passes through Runaway Bay, Bridgeport, where SH 114 splits off of US 380, Paradise, Boyd, Aurora, Rhome, briefly running concurrent with US 81 and US 287 before entering Fort Worth and passing the Texas Motor Speedway and crossing I-35W. In the DFW Metroplex, SH 114 goes through Roanoke, crossing US 377 and becoming a freeway, the Northwest Parkway. The highway passes through Westlake, Southlake, and Grapevine. There, SH 114 forms the northern edge of the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport with SH 121. The highway becomes the John W. Carpenter Highway as it travels southeast to its eastern terminus at SH 183. A road was designated on February 21, 1938, from SH 114 to SH 121; either SH 114 Loop or SH 121 Loop. This was renumbered as Loop 10 on September 26, 1939. Business routes SH 114 at an interchange with Dove Road SH 114 has four current business routes. =Levelland business loop= left *Business State Highway 114-B (formerly Loop 44) is a Business Loop that runs from SH 114 on the west side of Levelland (in west Texas) south along West Street, then east through the downtown area on Houston Street to an intersection with US 385 (College Street). The road turns left (north), concurrent with US 385, until intersecting once again at SH 114. The road was designated as Loop 44 on September 26, 1939 as a renumbering of SH 24 Spur, but was changed to Business SH 114-B on January 26, 1993 by district request, and is long. =Rhome business spur= left *Business State Highway 114-J is a Business Spur that goes east into Rhome from the intersection of US 81/US 287 and SH 114 west. The route runs along Rhome Avenue to an intersection with Business US 81-E. It is part of a previous route of SH 114. The Business route was designated on May 31, 1972 as Texas State Highway Spur 440 (but signed as Business SH 114), but was changed to its current designation on June 21, 1990 and is long. Note that an earlier Spur 440 was designated on October 3, 1966 as a spur of SH 34 in Ennis. This was cancelled on or before the day the later Spur 440 was designated. =Roanoke business loop= *Business State Highway 114-K is a business loop that runs through Roanoke. This route runs on Byron Nelson Boulevard, along a previous route of SH 114. The business route was created in 2001 when SH 114 was rerouted further north and east around town. The route is long. Former business routes =Former Bridgeport business loop= left Business State Highway 114-H was located in Bridgeport between June 21, 1990 and March 29, 2007 and was long. The route went east along Halsell Avenue from an intersection with SH 114, to an intersection with 13th Street, then turned right (south) until another intersection with SH 114. This route had been previously designated Loop 373 on November 1, 1962; since 2007, though, the portion along 13th was changed back to Loop 373. =Former Grapevine business loop= left *Business State Highway 114-L (formerly Loop 382 as well as a previous routing of SH 114) is a business loop that runs through Grapevine. This route runs east on Northwest Highway to an intersection with Texan Trail, then turns right to go southbound there. The road continues until it reaches SH 114/SH 121. The portion of the business route along Texan Trail is concurrent with SH 26. The route was designated on April 18, 1963, as Texas State Highway Loop 382 (but signed as Business SH 114), until June 21, 1990, when the road's designation as Loop 382 was discontinued. On November 21, 2013 the entire route was removed and returned to the city of Grapevine.

Series history The original team was led by Battlestone, who had been a former member of Youngblood, as well as a member of Image Comics' \\"Golden Age\\" team the Allied Supermen of America. Having been expelled from Youngblood following the deaths of several Youngblood members who at the time were under his command, he later went on to form Brigade alongside Kayo, Boone, and Lethal. But when one of their missions went awry, he disbanded the team, leaving Boone and Lethal out in the cold. Sometime later, at Kayo's urging, Battlestone recruited brothers Seahawk and Coldsnap, using their newly inherited vast wealth to finance the team. Later on, Thermal and Atlas joined the group, and their final member Stasis was introduced as well. The team's first major enemy was the evil Prince Genocide, who wreaked havoc in their city before both he and Brigade were teleported back to Genocide's homeworld and stranded there for a time. After being aided by a group of alien freedom fighters called the Birds of Prey, the team managed to escape back to Earth, but not before a climactic battle with Genocide resulted in the death of Atlas. The second incarnation of the team came together after Brigade returned to Earth. Stasis, who blamed Battlestone for Atlas' death immediately resigned from the team, only to be shot dead by Cabbot, leader of the government strike team, Bloodstrike, who had orders to take Brigade into custody. During the battle, Kayo and Seahawk were captured and Coldsnap's powers went out of control, turning him into a humanoid ice creature. Battlestone sought out Boone, who was still somewhat bitter about being shut out after the original team folded, but decided to rejoin the new team regardless. Lethal had also resurfaced by now and managed to rescue Seahawk from captivity. Another battle took place between the teams and Kayo was also rescued from captivity by Hacker, Boone's partner. Brigade were the victors and Bloodstrike was defeated. Another new member named Crucible was introduced into the group sometime later. Boone was later revealed to be a traitor to the team working for Project Born Again and stole an expos√© on the team written by Thermal, who was an undercover reporter and was given her powers through technology as a means of planting her into the group and exposing it from within. Thermal, however, during her time with Brigade saw that they were not the menace that they were being portrayed as and decided to destroy all the information she had been gathering. Battlestone, incensed by Boone's betrayal, pursued him and both appeared to die in an explosion. However, they both survived and Battlestone was subsequently subjected to brainwashing to make him subservient to the U.S. government again. Before the team could address the matter of Thermal's expos√©, the majority of them were killed off during the Extreme Sacrifice storyline, one of Extreme Studios' company-wide events, by the assassin called Crypt, with the exceptions of Seahawk and Lethal, who was propelled into the future. They were replaced by more recognizable characters from the Image Comics universe, including Jim Valentino's Shadowhawk and Erik Larsen and Gary Carlson's Vanguard. Seahawk acted as the team's commander, although he had effectively retired from superheroing after the deaths of his brother and teammates. A new incarnation was brought forward in a one-shot published by Liefeld's then-new company Awesome Entertainment. This new version featured such characters as Jeff Matsuda's Kaboom and Youngblood's Badrock. In 2010, a new volume of Brigade was released through Image Comics, which saw the original team updated and the original miniseries reimagined. The team was now formed in response to advance warning of an alien invasion. The history of the main characters has now been changed and the source of their powers stems from genetic advancements. The first issue of the new miniseries was released on 8 July 2010 with Rob Liefeld writing the story, Mark Poulton scripting, and Marat Mychaels returning on art duties. No further issues have been released since then.

The band originally claimed that the word \\"lowgold\\" was derived from a Nordic word, directly translated as \\"of hidden worth\\". However the band later admitted that it is just a word that Ford made up. The band seemingly split up in 2009 with no announcement. The band issued a statement with a vague promise of continuing, but the band appear to have drifted apart and have not worked together since. History Army child Darren Lee Ford, born in Tidworth, Hampshire, spent much of his childhood travelling around Northern Ireland, Germany and England, where his father was stationed before attending boarding school near Dover and spent the previous 10 years before forming Lowgold on the dole and drumming in numerous bands such as The Knievels with his older brother Gary and Shinecello with Miles Willey on guitar as well as touring the stand-up comedy circuit for eight months. Fed up of backing others, he decided to begin singing his songs himself and recorded home demos on a four-track portastudio with friend Dan Symons, from Poole, Dorset, and sent them off to several record labels. Nude Records responded that they were interested, and wanted to hear more songs and see the band live. When the duo informed Nude that there wasn't actually a band, the label suggested that needed to form one. They enlisted Miles Willey, from Bromley, Kent, who in addition to being a former bandmate and current housemate of Ford was an old university friend of Symons' on bass, and drafted in Paul Mayes on drums. Symons and Miles had also previously been in rival bands at University Of Hertfordshire. Symons was a member of Quadpeace, who had previously toured with Shinecello and Willey had been a member of Fetus Eaters. Nude Records signed the band in late 1998 after watching one rehearsal. The band then set about recording their debut album with American producer Tony Lash. During the initial sessions at Chipping Norton Recording Studios it was agreed that Paul's heavier drumming style didn‚Äôt fit Lowgold so he left the band. Along with Ford, Lash took over drum duties for the album, with former Slowdive drummer Simon Scott joining the band after the main album sessions, appearing on \\"Counterfeit\\", a track recorded with Dave Eringa. The band were then left in a state of limbo and barely able to support themselves as any releases were temporarily shelved due to Nude being in financial difficulties. The band were finally able to release their debut single \\"The 108\\" EP in July 2000, which was voted Single of the Week in both the NME and Melody MakerBirmingham Evening Mail 8 September 2000 and toured extensively, including dates with Grandaddy and Doves and a major support tour with Coldplay in October 2000. The band released Just Backward of Square in February 2001, shifting 40,000 copies in the UK and breaking into the Top 40. The band then ran into further problems with their label, who were repeatedly withholding wages from the band. Due to ongoing financial problems, the label were also increasingly reluctant to fund any further touring to promote the album and the band struggled to be able to afford to play Reading Festival and what turned out to be the band's last gig for two years at a Tim Buckley tribute night at the Royal Festival in London in September 2001. In December 2001, Nude and its publishing arm Bare Tunes went into voluntary liquidation due to financial debt, and failed to inform their acts of their intention to do so. The label had lost their distribution deal with Sony and a last-minute new deal with PIAS fell through. Willey later claimed that the label wasted any profit it made from Suede on promoting Ultrasound, who split in 1999 and accused the label of being dishonest and leaving the band up to their \\"necks in financial shit\\". Whilst the label's biggest act Suede were re-signed to Nude's parent label Sony (who had been looking after the band's affairs prior to Nude folding), many of the label's smaller acts, including Lowgold, were left significant debt and no record label. Following the collapse of Nude, the band found that major labels were reluctant to re-sign the band, as Ford admitted the band were now \\"damaged goods - no one wants to buy a suit someone has died in\\". The band were ¬£58,000 in debt and were forced to take day jobs. The band later revealed that Lowgold was set up as a partnership on the recommendation of Nude owner Saul Galpern, as opposed to a limited company and therefore all the partners were personally liable for any debts. The label had approved promotion and touring costs, with no way of funding them. Scott, who joined the band after they had signed to Nude, was not a partner and was technically classed as an employee of the band and therefore not liable for any of the debt. After all the band members, including Scott, had agreed to individually get loans to save themselves from bankruptcy, Scott telephoned Willey the day after to inform him that he was quitting the band, leaving the rest of the band to foot his tax bill also. In December 2002, following showcase gigs with the band's manager and former Wonder Stuff drummer Martin Gilks on drums (and who described the band as \\"more punk than most of the West Coast Middle Class Musos put together‚Ä¶ and they have better songs\\"), the band signed to Sanctuary Records, home to Morrissey and Spiritualized, for a one- album deal plus an option for a second, and set about recording a new album with first album producer Tony Lash as a trio, with Lash on drums. The band headed to the US and recorded the album at Supernatural Sound Recording Studio in Oregon and Lash's home studio. The band then enlisted drummer Rob Lee and keyboardist Colin Hartshorn for live dates. The album Welcome To Winners was released in October 2003, named as such as Symon's cousin's house backed onto Winnersh railway station where someone had crossed out the H on the \\"Welcome To Winnersh\\" sign. The band embarked on a UK tour in support of the album, which saw them supported by an up-and-coming Keane at Manchester Roadhouse. The band's comeback single \\"We Don't Have Much Time\\" wasn't promoted and was then cancelled at the last minute, despite it having already having been distributed to record shops and with the album receiving little promotion and the follow-up single \\"The Same way\\" failing to get any radio play in a musical landscape of teen pop and nu metal, the band felt neglected by Sanctuary and the label didn't take up the option for a follow-up. On the band's time with Sanctuary, Ford commented it was \\"like watching a misunderstood fat kid swim too far out to sea. Sanctuary decided Tubby wasn't worth saving and the lifeboat stayed in the harbour\\". Symons along with his cousin Jon Gilbert, who had helped save the band from bankruptcy, formed independent record label Dedtedrecords to release the anthology set Keep Music Miserable in October 2005, which saw the band release everything they had recorded. As far as the band were concerned, they were going nowhere and the band was finished for good. Ford continued to write, but had no intention of letting anyone else hear anything until the death of manager Martin Gilks in April 2006 which saw the band reunite to play at his funeral. After Symons heard the demos Ford had recorded, the band started demoing new material in early 2007 and released Promise Lands, their fourth studio album on 31 March 2008 through Goldhawk Recordings/Cooking Vinyl. Ford described the album as \\"a very sad record. There are bits of it that are quite raw, bits of it that are quite difficult to listen to for the same reason they were quite hard to write. It‚Äôs probably the most personal thing that we‚Äôve done\\". The future of Lowgold is currently uncertain, though an announcement from the band in August 2009 that they were busy raising children also included confirmation of their plans to continue. Post-split Willey played with Brighton-based Good Morning, Captain and instrumental band -a+M who morphed into Lamp and are signed to independent label Lancashire and Somerset. He currently works as a Doctoral College manager at University of Brighton. Symons went on to forge a career in music marketing, working at Sanctuary, Rough Trade Records and Pledgemusic as well as setting up his own company Band2Market. Ford reportedly continues to write songs and was the author of a number of now defunct satirical blogs, including Misanthrobs, I am Bono (you're not), World Of Worksports and Dick Cheney - The Retirement Years. He also writes for Sabotage Times and surrealfootball.com. In 2013, Ford uploaded a solo demo of a new song \\"Back To Zero\\" on SoundCloud.

This is the anniversary of the withdrawal of British troops and the Royal Navy from Malta in 1979. On taking power in 1971, the Labour Government indicated it wanted to re-negotiate the lease agreement with the United Kingdom. Following protracted and sometimes tense talks, a new agreement was signed whereby the lease was extended till the end of March 1979 at a vastly increased rent. On 31 March 1979 the last British Forces left Malta. For the first time in a millennium, Malta was no longer a military base of a foreign power and it became independent de facto as well as de jure. The main events of the activities commemorating this date take place at the Freedom Day Monument at Birgu (Vittoriosa) and at the War Memorial in Floriana.

He is best known for his socialist cartoons, especially those drawn for the left-wing political magazine The Masses between 1911 and 1917. Biography =Early years= Art Young was born January 14, 1866, near Orangeville, in Stephenson County, Illinois. His family moved to Monroe, Wisconsin, when he was a year old. His father, Daniel S. Young, was a grocer there; his mother was Amanda Young (n√©e Wagner). Art had two brothers and one sister. His brother, Wilmer Wesley Young, studied journalism at the University of Wisconsin and founded its student newspaper, The Daily Cardinal. Young enrolled in the Chicago Academy of Design in 1884, where he studied under J. H. Vanderpoel. His first published cartoon appeared the same year in the trade paper, Nimble Nickel. Also in that same year, he began working for a succession of Chicago newspapers including the Evening Mail, the Daily News, and the Tribune. In 1888, Young resumed his studies, first at the Art Students League of New York (until 1889), then at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris (1889‚Äì90). Following a long convalescence, he joined the Chicago Inter-Ocean (1892), to which he contributed political cartoons and drawings for its Sunday color supplement. In 1895 he married Elizabeth North. In 1895 or 1896, he worked briefly for the Denver Times, then moved again to New York City after his separation with North, where he sold drawings to the humor magazines Puck, Life, and Judge, and drew cartoons for William Randolph Hearst's New York Evening Journal and Sunday New York American. From 1902 to 1906, Young studied rhetoric at Cooper Union to improve his skills as a cartoonist. =The Masses= Good Morning, Aug. 1921 Young started out as a generally apolitical Republican, but gradually became interested in left wing ideas, and by 1906 or so considered himself a socialist. Young would begin increasingly to associate with such political leftist as John Sloan and Piet Vlag, both of whom he would work with at the radical socialist monthly, The Masses. He became firmly ensconced in the radical environment of Greenwich Village after moving there in 1910. He became politically active, and by 1910, racial and sexual discrimination and the apparent injustices of the capitalist system became prevalent themes in his work. Young would explain these sentiments in his autobiography, Art Young: His Life and Times (1939), > I am antagonistic to the money-making fetish because it sidetracks our > natural selves, leaving us no alternative but to accept the situation and > take any kind of work for a weekly wage [...] We are caught and hurt by the > system, and the more sensitive we are to life's highest values the harder it > is to bear the abuse.Young, Art. Art Young: His Life and Times. Ed. John > Nicholas Beffel. New York: Sheridan, 1939. 452. Print In an attempt to curb this abuse, Young ran for the New York State Assembly on the ticket of the Socialist Party of New York City (Part of the Socialist Party of America, SPUSA) in 1913 but was unsuccessful. \\"Poisoned at the Source,\\" cartoon by Young attacking the Associated Press.One facet of the establishment Young challenged in his cartoons and drawings was the Associated Press. His attacks became overt and damning once he joined the staff of the Masses as a co-editor and contributor. He held this position from 1911 to 1918. Young was one of the few original editorial members that stayed with the magazine for its entire run until it folded in December 1917. In July 1913, the magazine published Young's cartoon \\"Poisoned at the Source\\", which depicted the AP's president, Frank B. Noyes, poisoning a well labeled \\"The News\\" with lies, suppressed facts, slander, and prejudice. The cartoon was a response to the lack of national news coverage on the Paint Creek-Cabin Creek strike of 1912 in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The strike had lasted more than a year, and was characterized by deadly clashes between miners and militia hired by the coal companies. The coal companies were successful in having the Federal government declare martial law under a military tribunal, an egregious act according to the editors of the Masses. The fact that little had been heard about these occurrences outside of West Virginia troubled those on the magazine's staff. Young's cartoon and Max Eastman's editorial, published in the same issue, claimed the AP had willfully suppressed the facts to aid the coal companies. The AP responded in kind with two suits of libel against Eastman and Young in November 1913 and January 1914. Both suits eventually were dropped after Young and Eastman's attorney subpoenaed the records of the AP's Pittsburgh office, possibly out of fear that the testimony and evidence would be damaging after becoming public through the legal proceedings. =The Liberator= In 1918 Young subsequently helped to establish a similar publication to the Masses, the above-mentioned Liberator. He also served as an illustrator and Washington correspondent for Metropolitan Magazine (1912‚Äì17) until the magazine released him due to his outspoken anti- war sentiments. In 1918, Young again ran unsuccessfully for public office on the Socialist ticket, this time for the New York State Senate. Unhappy with the way that editors Max and Crystal Eastman and a few others were able to live off the struggling magazine, while he received a nominal fee or worked pro bono, Young left The Liberator in 1919 to start a magazine of his own, Good Morning. This publication was later absorbed by the Art Young Quarterly in 1922. =Other publications= Young also contributed illustrations to The Nation, The Saturday Evening Post and Collier's Weekly, New Leader, New Masses, The Coming Nation, Dawn, The Call, The New Yorker (after 1930), and Big Stick. Of the many books he wrote, two, On My Way (1928) and Art Young: His Life and Times (1939), are autobiographical. Of special note are his series of drawings depicting Hell, published in Cosmopolitan magazine and in several books, including Through Hell With Hiprah Hunt, available at Google Books. He issued a collection of his drawings, The Best of Art Young, in 1936. =Legal difficulties= First Masses Trial Having Their Fling by Art Young was brought into court as evidence during the second trial in September/October 1918. Young would continue to get himself into legal trouble with his drawings during his years at the Masses. In October 1917, Art Young, Max Eastman, John Reed, Floyd Dell, Merrill Rogers, and a one-time contributor were charged under the Espionage Act by the federal government on the charge of conspiracy to obstruct enlistment. The trial began in April the following year and Young was asked to justify his cartoon \\"Having Their Fling\\" in which four men, an editor, a capitalist, a politician, and a minister are depicted dancing in orgiastic bliss as Satan leads a band of war implements. Young stated he was simply illustrating General Sherman's well-known saying that \\"war is hell.\\" It seemed appropriate to Young, then, to have Satan as the conductor. The first trial ended in a hung jury. The official tally was 11‚Äì1 for conviction. Second Masses Trial The second trial began in September 1918, and it was as full of humor and irreverence as the first, perhaps more humorous for the historian than for Young. Throughout the trial, Young had the tendency to nap, an act that brought him dangerously close to being charged with contempt of court. Afraid Young would get into more trouble than he already was, his attorneys insisted he be awakened and given a pencil and pad. Young took the pencil and pad and quickly completed a self-portrait. The drawing, \\"Art Young on Trial for His Life\\", appeared in the Liberator in June 1918. The cartoon depicted Young slumped in a chair, dozing the trial away. Young's propensity for napping worked to the defendant's advantage during the closing arguments. Prosecutor Barnes, wrapped in an American flag and giving a moving speech, told a story of a dead soldier in France. This soldier, Barnes claimed, \\"is but one of a thousand whose voices are not silent. He died for you and he died for me. He died for Max Eastman. He died for John Reed. He died for Merrill Rogers. He demands that these men be punished.\\"Fishbein, Leslie. Rebels in Bohemia: The Radicals of The Masses, 1911‚Äì1917. Chapel Hill: U of North Carolina P, 1982. 28. Print. Roused from his slumber by the impassioned speech, Young exclaimed, \\"What! Didn't he die for me too?\\" The beautiful oration successfully ruined, the second jury was unable to convict or acquit. Eight jurors voted for acquittal and four for conviction. It would be the last time Young appeared in court for the charges, as they were dropped after failing twice to garner any convictions. =Death= Art Young died on December 29, 1943, at the Hotel Irving in New York City at age 77. Legacy and honors Young's papers are housed in the Special Collections Library of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

Its name is derived from the Ainu language for \\"large village‚Äù. It is the second largest island, after Paramushir, in the northern subgroup of the Kurils. It is administratively included in the Severo-Kurilsky District of Sakhalin oblast, Russia. Geography and geology Onekotan is roughly rectangular, with a length of , and a width ranging from .

This volcano was named after Captain Pyotr Krenitsyn of the Imperial Russian Navy. The mountain rises from a depth of from , and contains a deep () central caldera lake with a diameter of , called Tao-Rusyr Caldera. The central peak of this \\"island within the island\\" is actually the highest point on Onekotan Island * Nemo -(; Japanese Ê†πËåÇÂ±±; Nemoyama) with a height of is the peak to the north. It has two nested subsidiary calderas, with the cone of Nemo Peak rising in the southwest end of the youngest caldera and a crescent-shaped crater lake, named Lake Chernoye, partially filling the northeast part. There are seven rivers on the island more than five kilometers long. The largest is Ozernaya River ( long, which flows from the southern part of the caldera of the Nemo volcano to the Sea of Okhotsk. Almost the same length is the Kedrovka River, which flows from the central part of the island into the Pacific Ocean. The climate of Onekotan is characterized by short, cool summers, high humidity, frequent fogs, and especially strong winds. However, the island's climate is generally considered to be mild oceanic with an average annual temperature of about . Even in record cold winters, temperatures below were not observed. Onekotan is separated from the neighboring islands by the Fourth Kuril Strait, Yevreinov Strait, and Krenitsyn Strait. The neighboring islands are Makanrushi, with a volcanic peak, is to the northwest of Onekotan; and Kharimkotan, with a high volcano, is to the southwest. Paramushir is located to the northeast. Onekotan still has an active volcano with the most recent eruption, in 1952, forming a small lava dome on the island's coast. A bay on the eastern shore contains the remains of an abandoned settlement.

History Onekotan, with a number of shallow bays and sandy beaching providing landing points, was inhabited by the Ainu prior to European contact. It appears on an official map showing the territories of Matsumae Domain, a feudal domain of Edo period Japan dated 1644, and these holdings were officially confirmed by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1715. The island was surveyed by Russian geodesists and explorers Ivan Yevreinov and Fyodor Luzhin in 1720, and was subsequently, claimed by the Empire of Russia in 1736 after the Ainu inhabitants were converted to the Russian Orthodox Church; however Russian tax collectors encountered Japanese officials on the islands in 1744‚Äì45. Sovereignty initially passed to Russia under the terms of the 1855 Treaty of Shimoda, but was returned to the Empire of Japan per the Treaty of Saint Petersburg in 1875 along with the rest of the Kuril islands. The island was formerly administered as part of Shimushu District of Nemuro Subprefecture of Hokkaid≈ç. In 1884, the Ainu inhabitants were relocated by Japanese authorities to Shikotan. During World War II, the island had a small Japanese garrison, which surrendered on August 25, 1945 without a fight. After 1945, the island came under the control of the Soviet Union, and is now administered as part of the Sakhalin Oblast of the Russian Federation. A small garrison on the island was withdrawn in 2005. Flora and fauna There are chars in Lake Chyornoye, one of the two lakes on Onekotan, located at the northern end of the island.

(2000). \\"The breeding seabirds of the Russian Far East\\". Seabirds of the Russian Far East, 37-81. Mammals found on the island include foxes and small rodents, with seals and sea lions on the coast. The strong winds and harsh climate limit the growth of trees to small thickets of Krummholz formations of Siberian dwarf pine with a maximum height of 2‚Äì4 meters, mostly in gullies.

The western segment of the loop is named after General Walton Walker, who served and died in South Korea. During the 1950s and 1960s, Loop 12 was the outer beltway in the Dallas area, having since been supplanted by Interstate 635, which is itself being supplanted by the President George Bush Turnpike (SH 190). Loop 12 is, however, the only state highway in Dallas that forms a complete loop (Belt Line Road is also a complete loop but is not a state road except for a stretch as part of Farm to Market Road 1382). Route description Starting in the east at Interstate 30, Loop 12 goes north as Buckner Boulevard, following surface streets past White Rock Lake. Just north of White Rock Lake, it intersects Spur 244 and becomes Northwest Highway to the west; because there is an eastern and a western segment to this part of the road, at certain points the road signs read \\"East Northwest Highway\\". It continues west along surface streets over Central Expressway (US 75) and the Dallas North Tollway and moves north of Bachman Lake and Dallas Love Field. After crossing Interstate 35E, Loop 12 moves south as a freeway, locally known as Walton Walker Boulevard, passing where Texas Stadium once sat at the interchanges with State Highways 114 and 183. The segment between I-35E (Stemmons Freeway) and Spur 408 is the only portion of Loop 12 that is freeway. It is also the only portion that leaves the Dallas city limits, as it runs through the eastern portion of Irving between where the road crosses the Elm Fork of the Trinity River (northern boundary, just north of the former site of Texas Stadium) and where it crosses the West Fork Trinity River (southern boundary). Loop 12 has TEXpress lanes (one in each direction) from State Highway 183 to I-35E TEXpress Lanes or I-35E which connects to the LBJ Express (I-635 TEXpress). After intersecting Interstate 30 for the second time, Loop 12 continues south, joining surface streets again east of Mountain Creek Lake at Mountain Creek Parkway and Patriot Parkway (or Spur 408, which provides a southwesterly freeway link to I-20). It continues to the southeast, turning east along Ledbetter Drive, just north of Dallas Executive Airport (formerly Red Bird Airport). It continues east, crossing US 67, Interstate 35E for the second time, and Interstate 45. At the intersection with US 175 and Murdock Road, Loop 12 turns north again as Buckner Boulevard all the way back to Interstate 30. The portion between Bonnie View Rd. and US 175 is also known as Great Trinity Forest Way, as it passes across an undeveloped portion of the Trinity River and the Trinity River Audubon Center. History Loop 12 was designated on September 26, 1939, from US 175 across US 80 to the Buckner Orphans Home, and across US 67 to SH 114 at White Rock Lake as a renumbering of SH 40 Bypass. On April 23, 1942, Loop 12 was extended from US 175 to US 75. On August 3, 1943, Loop 12 was extended westward and northward to SH 183. On October 6, 1943, Loop 12 was extended northward and eastward back to SH 114 at White Rock Lake. On January 7, 1971, Loop 12 was rerouted on Spur 348 and part of the old location of SH 114; the rest of the old location of SH 114 became new Spur 348, and the old route of Loop 12 became Spur 482.

He made his first screen appearance in the show's pilot, broadcast on October 6, 2000. He was credited in 317 episodes. Guilfoyle's departure was announced in March 2014 and his character left on May 7, 2014. Appearances The character appeared in every episode during his run, with the exception of \\"Felonious Monk\\" from season two, \\"Gum Drops\\" and \\"The Unusual Suspect\\" from season six, \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" from season seven, \\"Blood Moon\\", \\"All That Cremains\\" and \\"Cello and Goodbye\\" from season eleven and \\"Bittersweet\\", \\"Seeing Red\\", \\"Malice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Dune and Gloom\\" from season twelve, \\"Wild Flowers\\" and \\"Dead Air\\" from season thirteen, \\"Last Supper\\", \\"Killer Moves\\", \\"Consumed\\" from season fourteen. He appeared in 303 episodes. Departure On March 24, 2014 it was announced that Jim would be leaving CSI: Crime Scene Investigation by the end of season 14. Guilfoyle was written out of the show after the producers decided to end his character's storyline. The actor found out that he would not be returning for the fifteenth season the week before the announcement. Executive producers Carol Mendelsohn and Don McGill stated \\"In a show about forensics, fans always looked forward to the handcuffs coming out, and Capt. Brass putting his spin on the crime of the week, just as Paul Guilfoyle put his indelible stamp on the character and the show. He will be missed.\\" Jim left the team on May 7, 2014 but returned for the series finale in season 15. Background Brass enlisted in the United States Marine Corps fresh out of high school and did two tours of duty in the Vietnam War. He graduated from Seton Hall University with a degree in history. After the war, he joined the Newark Police. Brass spent 20 years working his way up to homicide detective in Newark, New Jersey. Before he became a homicide detective, he was assigned to Vice. While working in Vice, he worked hard to clean up his department, earning the enmity of many of his former colleagues (and the nickname \\"Squeaky\\", as in \\"squeaky clean\\"). Brass, under stress, sometimes drank and would cover it up by popping cough drops to hide the smell of alcohol on his breath (episode 415, \\"Early Rollout\\"). While his wife Nancy was having an affair with Vice cop Mike O'Toole, Brass was busy with his own affair with another member of the vice squad, Annie Kramer, who later moved to Los Angeles and was promoted to captain. Brass claims later that it was Nancy's affair that ruined their marriage, rather than the other way around, and that she eventually just wanted a way out (episode 520, \\"Hollywood Brass\\"). Brass transferred out of New Jersey in the 1990s and came to Las Vegas. Career Early on, Brass and other officers new to the force were courted by Undersheriff McKeen in regards to taking bribes, the entire group having been invited to McKeen's for a barbecue. Brass made it clear he was not for sale and said he was not invited to any more gatherings after that (episode \\"For Warrick\\"). However, he was very much a player and a partier, describing work as \\"an interruption to his fun\\". He had a fling with former officer Ann-Marie Tolsom, his name later turning up on a list of those who had had physical relations with her when she was believed killed by her ex- husband. (She turned out to still be alive after her ex was killed in prison and it was revealed she had framed him and faked her death; episode \\"The List\\".) Brass eventually left his wilder side behind, and eventually began running the CSI department, more as an administrator than as an investigator. Showing as an example of how much he trusts the team, Brass has stated that he would want Gil Grissom's CSI team to investigate his murder; he gave Grissom power of attorney rights should anything happen to him, which proved useful when Grissom chose to go ahead with his risky but life-saving surgery when he was shot. Brass used to have Grissom's job as the supervisor of the CSI team. After young CSI Holly Gribbs was murdered on her first day in the field, he lost his position to Grissom. Brass was then given the position as a homicide detective, usually serving as the legal muscle for the CSI team and the one who does most of the arresting and interrogating of suspects. Brass is shown to favor heavy-caliber weaponry including a USP .45 handgun and a Remington 870 shotgun. In the two-part episode \\"A Bullet Runs Through It\\", Brass tries to counsel Detective Sofia Curtis, who believes she may have accidentally killed another officer in a chaotic shoot-out with a gang of drug dealers. He later is stunned and guilt-ridden to realize that he was actually the one that killed the officer. Later at the officer's funeral, his widow approached, and when Brass tried to explain how sorry he was, she told him that she knew it was not his fault. While Brass could never be accused of being a \\"soft cop\\", he has a reputation for adhering to the rules and witty sarcasm when interviewing suspects. In the episode \\"Who and What\\", after the FBI's Jack Malone slams a suspect's head on the table, Brass rushes in and pulls him off, saying \\"If you want to rendition him to Gitmo, be my guest. But in this house, we play by the rules.\\" In the episode \\"You Kill Me\\", after David Hodges creates a fictional story in which Brass uses his night stick on a suspect, fellow lab tech Henry comments \\"Captain Brass isn't the type of cop that smacks suspects around.\\" At the end of season 8, in \\"For Gedda\\", Brass tells CSI Warrick Brown \\"I hope you remember how lucky you are\\", after Warrick is cleared of a murder charge. Warrick is murdered at the end of the episode. In the season 9 premiere, \\"For Warrick\\", Brass is shown to be stricken with guilt over these words. Relationships with colleagues Brass has a good working relationship with other members of the team. Protective of his colleagues, he is usually the one to draw his gun and does not like it when the CSIs try to take dangerous matters, like arresting armed suspects, into their own hands. He also gets on Grissom's case for not drawing his firearm, even in appropriate situations. He is close friends with former night shift supervisor Gil Grissom. During Season 6, when he was shot, he gave Grissom the power of attorney. When Grissom left, he developed a friendship with Ray Langston. He had some disagreements with Langston over dealing with serial killer Nate Haskell in Season 10 (\\"Meat Jekyll\\"). In the last episode of Season 11, he tried to protect him by concealing evidence that would indicate Langston had crossed the line from self-defense to murder when Langston killed Haskell. Early in the series, Brass is tough on Warrick, and there is obvious tension between them in several episodes, especially when there was an officer- involved shooting, with Brass believing Warrick to be reckless, and Warrick feeling Brass to be holding him back, but they eventually bury the hatchet, and become good friends and coworkers. When Warrick is murdered, Brass is visibly upset, especially after his ill-timed statement to Warrick immediately before his murder about how lucky he was. Regarding Sara, he is somewhat sympathetic to her, and it is implied he is aware of her personal life in which she witnessed her mother murder her father. He does, however, have to occasionally chastise her when she becomes overzealous and runs into a scene before the officers have a chance to secure it. He also sees shades of himself in her when he notices her popping cough drops at a scene, presumably to hide the smell of alcohol on her breath. Brass has an excellent working relationship with Nick Stokes. Brass treats him much like a nephew, and save for Grissom himself, his relationship with Nick is the friendliest among the CSI's. When Nick is abducted and buried alive, Brass pulls out all the stops to ensure Nick is safely found. Concerning Greg Sanders, Brass sometimes likes to poke fun at Sanders at the latter's expense, often in a light-hearted manner, like saying something was stuck to Grissom's shoe when they walked into a scene together. He doesn't have much interaction with him early in the series, but once Sanders crosses from lab tech to CSI, they begin working more cases together, and they have a mutual respect. Personal life Brass has an estranged daughter, Ellie Rebecca Brass, who is not biologically his (unbeknownst to her). As he explains it to Warrick Brown in the episode \\"Ellie\\": \\"Call it the mailman's. Ellie doesn't know.\\" In fact, Ellie's biological father is former New Jersey Vice cop Mike O'Toole, whom Brass discovered to be dirty. Ellie works as a prostitute in Los Angeles, to the deep disappointment of her father. Despite her rebellious behavior, Brass still loves her deeply, and keeps a picture of her as a child on his desk in his office. When he discovers that she is doing drugs, he keeps after her until she cleans up, but their relationship remains difficult and strained. Brass is shot by William Cutler, a wanted suspect in a triple homicide. When he is in the hospital in critical condition, in the season six finale \\"Way to Go\\", Ellie seems more concerned with the pension than her father's likelihood of survival‚Äîwhich is probably why Brass gave his power of attorney to colleague and friend Gil Grissom, who saved Brass's life by having him undergo surgery to remove the bullet. At the end of that episode, Brass is surrounded by his other family: the CSI night shift team, who watched over him through his ordeal. At the end of the seventh season premiere, \\"Built To Kill, Part 1\\", Brass is seen in a tattoo parlor, having the date of his shooting (May 11, 2006) tattooed just below the bullet scar. In the Season 13 finale \\"Skin in the Game\\", Ellie is apparently kidnapped by a serial killer re-enacting deaths from Dante's Inferno. CSI Morgan Brody goes undercover but is herself kidnapped by the same killer. Brass is emotionally distraught and calls Ellie's mother, who flies to Las Vegas and badgers her ex-husband to find Ellie. When Morgan frees herself and she and Ellie are escaping the killer, Ellie shoots Morgan, nearly killing her‚Äîrevealing herself to be the mastermind behind the killings.

The conjecture is one of Landau's problems (1912) on prime numbers; , the conjecture has neither been proved nor disproved. Prime gaps Legendre's conjecture is one of a family of results and conjectures related to prime gaps, that is, to the spacing between prime numbers. Plot of the number of primes between n2 and (n + 1)2 The prime number theorem suggests that the actual number of primes between n2 and (n + 1)2 () is asymptotic to n/ln(n). Since this number is large for large n, this lends credence to Legendre's conjecture. If Legendre's conjecture is true, the gap between any prime p and the next largest prime would always be at most on the order of \\\\sqrt{p}; in big O notation, the gaps are O(\\\\sqrt p). Two stronger conjectures, Andrica's conjecture and Oppermann's conjecture, also both imply that the gaps have the same magnitude. Harald Cram√©r conjectured that the gaps are always much smaller, of the order (\\\\log p)^2. If Cram√©r's conjecture is true, Legendre's conjecture would follow for all sufficiently large n. Cram√©r also proved that the Riemann hypothesis implies a weaker bound of O(\\\\sqrt p\\\\log p) on the size of the largest prime gaps.. A counterexample near 1018 would require a prime gap fifty million times the size of the average gap. Legendre's conjecture implies that at least one prime can be found in every half revolution of the Ulam spiral. Partial results It follows from a result by Ingham that for all sufficiently large n, there is a prime between the consecutive cubes n^3 and (n+1)^3. Baker, Harman and Pintz proved that there is a prime in the interval [x,\\\\,x+O(x^{21/40})] for all large x. A table of maximal prime gaps shows that the conjecture holds to at least n^2=4\\\\cdot10^{18}, meaning n=2\\\\cdot10^9.. It has been proven that for infinitely many n \\\\in \\\\mathbb N, we have :\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{(n+1)^2}{\\\\log(n+1)} - \\\\frac{n^2}{\\\\log(n)} \\\\right) - \\\\frac{\\\\log(n)^2}{\\\\log(\\\\log(n))} \\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\le \\\\pi\\\\left((n+1)^2\\\\right) - \\\\pi\\\\left(n^2\\\\right), where \\\\pi is the prime- counting function.

The book is a children's biography of Nathaniel Bowditch, a sailor and mathematician who published the mammoth and comprehensive reference work for seamen: The American Practical Navigator. It is an epic tale of adventure and learning. Plot summary In Revolutionary War‚Äìera Salem, Massachusetts, a young Nat Bowditch, the smallest member of a sea-faring family, astounds his schoolteacher with his talent for mathematics. He dreams of someday attending Harvard University but is forced by his family's financial hardships to quit school and work in his father's cooperage. Even that sacrifice isn't enough, and his family contracts him into indentured servitude at a chandlery. Determined to continue his education, he uses his nine years as a clerk to teach himself subjects such as trigonometry, calculus, Latin, and French. Upon the fulfillment of his servitude, he takes a job as a surveyor, which quickly evolves into a career as an officer and supercargo on various merchant ships. Numerous voyages take him to ports around the world and sometime into brushes with the wars being fought by the young United States. In his duties as a navigator, he discovers that many of the navigational sources available contain dangerous errors, and he is compelled to compile a new book of navigational data. His experiences educating crew members on his watch allow him to supplement his numeric tables with information that allow sailors with limited educations to learn the trade of navigation. Eventually Nat becomes a captain and he faces his greatest navigational challenge of all. Reception Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"A readable biography of the man who was scarcely out of his teens before he had written the authoritative book on navigation still used at Annapolis\\". In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1956 to 1965, librarian Carolyn Horovitz wrote of Carry On, Mr. Bowditch, Rifles for Watie, The Witch of Blackbird Pond and The Bronze Bow: \\"All have value, all are told skilfully. If they lack the qualities of greatness, it is largely because their style has a commercial sameness.\\" Further reading Intended for young readers, Carry On, Mr. Bowditch includes many dramatized and fictional components. A serious modern biography is Robert E. Berry's Yankee Stargazer, published in 1941. This book is a true story.

An Encyclopedia of Fairies. Pantheon Books. p. 16. . They appear as beautiful women who seduce their victims before attacking them and draining their blood. Folklore According to the Scottish folklorist Donald Alexander Mackenzie, the baobhan sith usually appears as a beautiful young woman wearing a long green dress that conceals the deer hooves she has instead of feet. Like other vampires she drinks the blood of human victims and will vanish with the rising sun. She may also take the form of a hooded crow or raven.Mackenzie, Donald (1935). Scottish Folklore and Folk Life. Blackie & Son Limited. pp. 236‚Äì7. There are numerous stories about the baobhan sith with a general theme of hunters being attacked in the wilderness at night. In one tale recorded by Mackenzie, there were four men who went hunting and took shelter for the night in a lonely shieling or hut. One of the men supplied vocal music while the others began dancing. The men expressed a desire for partners to dance with, and soon after that four women entered the hut. Three of them danced while the fourth sat beside the vocalist. He then noticed drops of blood falling from his companions and fled from the hut, taking refuge among the horses. His vampiric partner chased him but was unable to catch him, and when daylight came she disappeared. The man went back inside and found all three of his friends dead and drained of blood.Robertson, C. M. (1905). \\"Folklore from the West of Ross- shire\\" in Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness (Vol. 26, 1910). pp. 268‚Äì9. The folklorist Katharine Briggs suggested that the baobhan sith was unable to catch the fourth man among the horses because of the iron with which the horses were shod, iron being a traditional fairy vulnerability. In a similar tale one of the men noticed that the women had deer hooves instead of feet and fled from them. He returned the next morning to find that the other hunters had their \\"throats cut and chests laid open\\".Watson, W. J. (Mrs.) \\"Fairy Tales\\" in The Celtic Review (Vol. 5, 1908-1909). Edinburgh: Norman Macleod. pp. 163‚Äì5. In a third story the hunters took refuge in a cave. Each of the men said he wished his own sweetheart were there that night, but one of them, named Macphee, who was accompanied by his black dog, said he preferred his wife to remain at home. At that moment a group of young women entered the cave, and the men who had wished for their sweethearts were killed. Macphee was protected by his dog who drove the women from the cave.Campbell, John Gregorson (1900). Superstitions of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. Glasgow: James MacLehose and Sons. pp. 112‚Äì116. One recurring motif in these stories is that the baobhan sith appear almost immediately after the hunters express their desire for female companionship. This is connected with a traditional Scottish belief that if one were to make a wish at night without also invoking God's protection, then that wish would be granted in some terrible manner. In literature *The baobhan sith have appeared on a number of occasions in author Mark Chadbourn's fantasy trilogies The Age of Misrule, The Dark Age, and Kingdom of the Serpent. *Baobhan sith are mentioned in Nicole Peeler's Tempest Rising series. *They are also mentioned in Michael Scott's The Magician: The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel. *They appear in Faerie Tale by Raymond E. Feist where they are portrayed as evil fairies of the Unseelie Court, who (aside from their great beauty) possess a strong compelling magic which they use to force solitary males in isolated locations to follow them to their deaths. *Cornelia Amiri is the author of the Dancing Vampire romance series of six novellas: Dance of the Vampires, Vampire Highland Fling, A Bonnie Vampire Dancer, Vampire Waltz, Valkyrie Vampire Sword Dancing, and Some Vampires Shimmy. The series is about seven baobhan sith sisters and each book features a different sister as they fall in love. *Desdemona, an Oriental dancer and commander of the Fae army in Amy Hoff's Scottish urban fantasy series Caledonia, is a baobhan sith. *In Night and Silence, the twelfth installment of Seanan McGuire's October Daye series, the protagonist is attacked and repeatedly bitten by a starving baobhan sith. In this portrayal, a baobhan sith is able to mimic both the appearance and supernatural abilities of anyone whose blood she has recently consumed. *A baobhan sith appears as an adversary in the Fighting Fantasy gamebook \\"Vault of the Vampire\\". In film Baobhan Sith the feature film was released in 2017. It was produced by Scottish independent company Eyedoll Productions and was written and directed by David W Hutchison.

The valley is rich in wide veins of coal, known historically as \\"The Big Vein.\\" Coal was once extracted by deep mines but is only mined today through surface mining. The Georges Creek Valley was once a major center for the US coal industry. History Map of the Georges Creek region, 1907 A series of small mining towns were founded along the Georges Creek Valley in the nineteenth century when coal was discovered in the region. This led mining companies in the valley to develop railroads for transporting the coal. Some of these railroads were merged into the Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad System between 1853 and 1870. A competing railroad, the George's Creek and Cumberland Railroad, operated in the valley between 1876 and 1917, followed by the Western Maryland Railway. Most of the original settlers to the Valley came in response to the abundance of jobs available in the coal mines. Many were Irish, but German, Scottish, and Welsh names also are found in the early records of the town. Table of Cumberland Coal Trade Production Levels 1842-1865 Coal mining quickly became the most important industry in the Cumberland area. Some of the richest beds of soft, bituminous coal in the country lay within the hills and mountains of this region. After the Civil War, coal became one of Maryland's chief products and exports. Coal from the Cumberland area fueled the state's mills and plants, steamships in Baltimore's harbor as well as the US Navy fleet, and was traded to buyers from London, Brazil, Egypt, and beyond. Primarily Scottish and Welsh immigrants provided the labor force for these mines, immigrating with their families for the opportunities America offered. In the Cumberland region, miners escaped the indebtedness to the mining company that plagued miners in surrounding states. The company store system, in which miners were forced to purchase all their supplies and household needs from the mining company, was outlawed in Maryland in 1868. A comparatively high proportion of miners were also homeowners, as local mining firms found it more profitable to sell houses to their miners, than establish \\"company\\" housing. Since regional coal mines were constructed with horizontal shafts, they were far less dangerous than the vertical shaft mines of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Still, the regional miners, blackened from head to foot when they emerged from a mine at the end of a day, knew that the carbon-filled air, which corroded the lungs over time, would lead to an early death. After World War I, coal production started to decline, and today only some strip mining remains as the last vestige of this once all-important industry. Coal trains once went through the valley every day, but now do so only once or twice a month. Image:Allegany coal basin.jpg Towns in the Valley * Westernport: Westernport is the terminus of Georges Creek, where it empties into the North Branch of the Potomac River. The town derives its name from being the westernmost navigable port on the river. In the late 18th century and early to mid part of the 19th century, coal and timber was loaded onto flatboats at Westernport, where Georges Creek empties into the Potomac, then floated down to near Great Falls, Virginia, where the goods were unloaded, the boats broken up to sell as lumber, and the operators walking back to Westernport. The town of Piedmont, West Virginia, lies directly adjacent to Westernport on the other side of the Potomac. * Barton: The Reverend William Shaw, a Methodist minister, settled on the site of Barton in 1794. His son, William Shaw, Jr., laid out the town in 1853, naming it for his father's hometown, Barton-upon- Humber, England. * Lonaconing: The first non-Indian settlers in the late 18th century were explorers, hunters and farmers. Names of some of the first settlers were Dye, Duckworth, Green, Fazenbaker, Beeman, Grove, VanBuskirk, Knapp and Miller. The first stone house built in 1797 in Knapps Meadow just north of Lonaconing was owned by Samuel VanBuskirk. The house still stands as of 2005. * Midland * Frostburg: Frostburg is the home of Frostburg State University, an institution within the University System of Maryland.

Campaigns for both the re-opening of Baschurch Station and Lache Station (near the site of the old Saltney Station) are now under way. The line has recently been upgraded by reinstating a double track between Rossett (near Wrexham) and Chester and improving certain sections of line to allow trains to run at 90 mph.\\"Work on delayed rail upgrade between Wrexham and Chester to resume in March 2017\\" The Leader; Retrieved 13 January 2017  History  =Construction= The North Wales Mineral Railway, connecting Chester via Wrexham to Ruabon, had been constructed from 1844 to take advantage of mineral rights. However, realising that it offered connection opportunities between the Port of Liverpool and the industrialised Midlands, the railway applied to extend to Shrewsbury. This was refused by Parliament. Forming an independent group of similar investors, a Private Act of Parliament authorising the construction of the Shrewsbury, Oswestry and Chester Junction Railway passed in 1845. Initially the proposal was to build a completely new line from a junction south east of , it would cross the River Dee near Farndon completely by-passing the North Wales Mineral Railway between Wrexham and Chester. The route would then go through Overton-on-Dee across the Dee again near Chirk before reaching Oswestry and then heading to Shrewsbury. However, in July 1846, the North Wales Mineral Railway merged with the Shrewsbury, Oswestry and Chester Junction Railway to form the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway. The formation of the new company immediately led to a revision of the plans. Construction of a new line and junction south east from Chester was abandoned. The new company would only need to build a line between Shrewsbury and the North Wales Mineral line at Wrexham. Likewise when construction was completed by 1848, the final route also bypassed Oswestry (one of the scheme's original destinations). Instead the town would be served by a branch line between a halt in the town and . On 24 May 1847, five passengers were killed and many were injured in the Dee Bridge disaster. A Chester to Ruabon train fell into the River Dee, following the collapse of the Dee Railway bridge on the outskirts of Chester. A girder, which had cracked in the middle, gave way as the train crossed. The engine and tender managed to reach the other side of the bridge but the carriages crashed into the river. The bridge was engineered by Robert Stephenson despite warnings from civil engineer, William Fairbairn. He had warned Stephenson about the problems using cast iron girders only a few months before construction of the bridge at a meeting at the Institution of Civil Engineers in London, but his advice was ignored. A Royal Commission following this accident led to a re-evaluation of the use of cast-iron in railway bridges. Many new bridges had to be reinforced or rebuilt. =Mergers and rationalisation= In 1849 the larger London and North Western Railway began aggressively trying to take business from the line in order to put it into bankruptcy. By 1854, the pressure forced the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway to agree to becoming part of the Great Western Railway. The route would become part of the GWR's main line from London Paddington to Birkenhead Woodside. In 1948, following nationalisation of UK's rail system, the former GWR Shrewsbury‚ÄìChester line became part of the Western Region of British Rail. It was later transferred to BR's London Midland Region in 1963. In the 1960s many of the passenger stations serving smaller communities along the line were closed. The track between Wrexham and Saltney Junction was also reduced from a double to a single line in 1983. There was a large reduction in freight traffic on the route as a result of the mineral industries around Wrexham closing in stages beginning with the Wrexham and Minera Railway in 1952 and then the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway in 1954 and the last section through Croes Newydd closed in 1982. Current operations =Expansion= In December 2005, Arriva Trains Wales introduced a new timetable to the line, providing an hourly service between Shrewsbury and Chester, Monday to Saturday, from early morning until around midnight (involving eight additional trains serving Gobowen). This improved service includes a through train every two hours between Holyhead and Cardiff throughout most of the day. The line saw passenger numbers double during 2003‚Äì2004 and increase by 30% since 1999. On 28 April 2008, Wrexham & Shropshire began services along the section of line between Wrexham General and , continuing via to . The service ceased on 28 January 2011, as the operator struggled to gain enough passengers to make it a going concern. =Passenger services= Passenger trains along the line are operated by Transport for Wales and Avanti West Coast, who operate one train per day on weekdays each way between Wrexham General and London Euston, via Chester. At Chester, there are connections towards and (on the North Wales Coast Line), towards Manchester Piccadilly via (on the Chester to Manchester Line), towards Manchester Piccadilly via (on the Mid-Cheshire Line) and towards (on Merseyrail's Wirral line). At Wrexham, there are connections towards Liverpool Lime Street (change at Bidston) via The Borderlands line and London via the West Coast Main Line. Wrexham General also acts as a terminus for many services travelling part of the line. At Shrewsbury, connections are provided towards via and and Manchester via Crewe (via the Welsh Marches line), towards and (on the Cambrian line), towards (via the Heart of Wales line) and towards Birmingham New Street. =Freight services= Freight along the line is half transitory and half generated on the line. Padeswood Hall Cement works at Penyfford does not send any of its finished product out by rail, but it does source its coal via Railfreight, mostly just once a week. Most often these trains are from Scotland and they run-round in Croes Newydd Loop south of Wrexham General station. DB Schenker haul two trainloads of Steel Coil per day from either Llanwern or Port Talbot Steelworks to Shotton steelworks on Deeside. The return empties are twice daily too. Kronospan's board factory at Chirk has inward flows of timber from Carlisle, Baglan Bay, Teignbridge and Ribblehead. Some of the traffic, especially from Ribblehead is seasonal and sporadic. All inbound flows must enter the works heading south and those leaving must head south too. This is because there is no cross over or run-round facility in the works sidings. =Community rail= The line is designated as a community rail partnership. =Wrexham to Chester service improvements= In March 2012 the Welsh Assembly announced that sections of the line would be part of a ¬£46-million improvement scheme. This included redoubling the track between Wrexham and Chester (Rossett Junction and Saltney Junction) and upgrading certain sections of line to allow trains to run at 90 mph. Work started on this project in June 2014 and was scheduled for completion in Spring 2015, but it was delayed until April 2017 by Network Rail due to the need for signalling cables to be replaced in addition to the track, signal and level crossing upgrades already installed.\\"Work on delayed rail upgrade between Wrexham and Chester to resume in March 2017\\" The Leader; Retrieved 13 January 2017 It is hoped this will create increased traffic between Wrexham and Chester and encourage new regular services to London and other new destinations. For example, the line could carry an extended hourly Hull to Manchester Piccadilly TransPennine Express service because it could reach Wrexham via Chester. This would provide a direct passenger service to Manchester, Leeds and Hull. Other suggestions include extending the current hourly Chester ‚Äì shuttle service south to Wrexham and north to Manchester (via Manchester Airport). May 2019 saw the introduction of two daily services between Wrexham General and Liverpool Lime Street via Chester and Runcorn following the reinstatement of services on the Halton Curve. Future developments The Chester to Shrewsbury Rail Partnership aims to promote travel along the line and to seek improvements to services and facilities. It is a member of the Association of Community Rail Partnerships (ACoRP).http://www.chester2shrewsburyrail.co.uk/contact.html In 2006, the Chester to Shrewsbury Rail Partnership commissioned the Scott Wilson Report to assess the feasibility of certain enhancements to the service.http://www.chester2shrewsburyrail.co.uk/index.html These include the re-opening of stations at Rossett and Johnstown & Hafod and the opening of a new station at Lache.

In the Ancien r√©gime, before 1795, France used a system of measures that had many of the characteristics of the modern Imperial System of units. There was widespread abuse of the king's standards to the extent that the lieue could vary from 3.268 km in Beauce to 5.849 km in Provence. In the revolutionary era, France used the first version of the metric system. This system was not well received by the public. Between 1812 and 1837, the mesures usuelles was used ‚Äì traditional names were restored, but were based on metric units: for example, the livre (pound) became 500 g. After 1837, the metric system was reintroduced and has remained the principal system of use to this day.  Ancien r√©gime (to 1795)  In the pre-revolutionary era (before 1795), France used a system of measures that had many of the characteristics of the modern Imperial System of units, but there was no unified system of measurement. Charlemagne and successive kings had tried but failed to impose a unified system of measurement in France. (In England, by contrast, the Magna Carta decreed that \\"there shall be one unit of measure throughout the realm.\\") The names and relationships of many units of measure were adopted from Roman units of measure and many more were added ‚Äì it has been estimated that there were seven or eight hundred different names for the various units of measure. In addition, the quantity associated with each unit of measure differed from town to town and even from trade to trade to such an extent that the lieue (league) could vary from 3.268 km in Beauce to 5.849 km in Provence. It has been estimated that, on the eve of the Revolution, a quarter of a million different units of measure were in use in France. Although certain standards, such as the pied du roi (the king's foot) had a degree of pre-eminence and were used by savants across Europe, many traders chose to use their own measuring devices, giving scope for fraud and hindering commerce and industry. As an example, the weights and measures used at Pernes-les-Fontaines in southeastern France differ from those catalogued later in this article as having been used in Paris. In many cases, the names are different, while the livre is shown as being 403 g, as opposed to 489 g ‚Äì the value of the livre du roi. (The Imperial pound is about 453.6 g.)  Revolutionary France (1795‚Äì1812) decimal and standard time. The French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic Wars marked the end of the Age of Enlightenment. The forces of change that had been brewing manifest themselves across all of France, including the way in which units of measure should be defined. The savants of the day favoured the use of a system of units that were inter-related and which used a decimal basis. There was also a wish that the units of measure should be for all people and for all time and therefore not dependent on an artefact owned by any one particular nation. Talleyrand, at the prompting of the savant Condorcet, approached the British and the Americans in the early 1790s with proposals of a joint effort to define the metre. In the end, these approaches came to nothing and France decided to \\"go it alone\\". Decimal time was introduced in the decree of 5 October 1793 under which the day was divided into 10 \\"decimal hours\\", the \\"hour\\" into 100 \\" decimal minutes\\" and the \\"decimal minute\\" into 100 \\"decimal seconds\\". The \\"decimal hour\\" corresponded to 2 hr 24 min, the \\"decimal minute\\" to 1.44 min and the \\"decimal second\\" to 0.864 s. The implementation of decimal time proved an immense task and under the article 22 of the law of 18 Germinal, Year III (7 April 1795), the use of decimal time was no longer mandatory. On 1 January 1806, France reverted to the traditional timekeeping. The Paris meridian, which passes through the Observatoire de Paris. The metre was defined along this meridian using a survey that stretched from Dunkirk to Barcelona. The metric system of measure was first given a legal basis in 1795 by the French Revolutionary government. Article 5 of the law of 18 Germinal, Year III (7 April 1795) defined five units of measure. The units and their preliminary values were: *The metre, for length ‚Äì defined as being one ten millionth of the distance between the North Pole and the Equator through Paris *The are (100 m2) for area [of land] *The st√®re (1 m3) for volume of firewood *The litre (1 dm3) for volumes of liquid *The gram, for mass ‚Äì defined as being the mass of one cubic centimetre of water Decimal multiples and submultiples of these units would be defined by Greek prefixes - \\"myria\\", \\"kilo\\", \\"hecta\\" (100), \\"deka\\" - and Latin prefixes - \\"deci\\", \\"centi\\" and \\"milli\\". Using Cassini's survey of 1744, a provisional value of 443.44 lignes was assigned to the metre which, in turn, defined the other units of measure. The final value of the metre had to wait until 1799, when Delambre and Mechain presented the results of their survey between Dunkirk and Barcelona that fixed the length of the metre at 443.296 lignes. The law 19 Frimaire An VIII (10 December 1799) defined the metre in terms of this value and the kilogram as being 18,827.15 grains. These definitions enabled the construction of reference copies of the kilogram and metre, which were to be used as standards for the next 90 years. At the same time, a new decimal-based system for angular measurement was implemented. The right angle was divided into 100 grads, which in turn was divided in 100 centigrads. An arc on the earth‚Äôs surface formed by an angle of one centigrad was one kilometre.  Mesures usuelles (1812‚Äì1839) Napoleon I in 1812 The metric system was introduced into France in 1795 on a district by district basis, starting with Paris. However, by modern standards, the introduction was poorly managed. Although thousands of pamphlets were distributed, the Agency of Weights and Measures, which oversaw the introduction, underestimated the work involved. Paris alone needed 500,000 metre sticks, yet one month after the metre became the sole legal unit of measure, there were only 25,000 in store. This, combined with other excesses of the Revolution made the metric system unpopular. Napoleon ridiculed the metric system, but as an able administrator, he recognised the value of a sound basis for a system of measurement. Under the d√©cret imp√©rial du 12 f√©vrier 1812 (imperial decree of 12 February 1812), he introduced a revised system of measure ‚Äì the mesures uselles or \\"customary measures\\" for use in small retail businesses. However, all government, legal and similar works still had to use the metric system and the metric system continued to be taught at all levels of education. The names of many pre-metric units were reintroduced, but were redefined in terms of metric units. Thus the toise (fathom) was defined as being two metres with six pied (feet) making up one toise, twelve pouce (inches) making up one pied and twelve lignes making up one pouce. Likewise, the livre (pound) was defined as being 500 g, each livre comprising sixteen once and each once eight gros and the aune as 120 centimetres.  The metric system restored (1840‚Äì1875) La loi du 4 juillet 1837 (the law of 4 July 1837) effectively revoked the use of mesures usuelles by reaffirming the laws of measurement of 1795 and 1799 to be used from 1 May 1840. However, many units of measure, such as the livre, remained in colloquial use for many years and the livre still does to some extent. When this legislation was introduced, the metric system was beginning to take hold across Europe. Switzerland and the German state of Baden had both defined their Fu√ü (foot) as being 300 mm and the German state of Hessen-Darmstadt has defined its Fu√ü as being 250 mm. Moreover, the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Lombardy and Venice had all adopted the metric system, albeit with local names for the \\"metre\\", \\"kilogram\\" and so on. The metric system was given a boost when the German Zollverein (Customs Union) introduced the Zollpfund of 500 g in 1850. The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London was followed by international exhibitions in Paris in 1855 and 1867. The 1867 exhibition had a stand showing how the diverse units of measure were converging onto the metric system ‚Äì a system that had been developed in France and whose standards were in the custody of the French government, but available for world use. In 1870, while France was preparing to host an international conference to discuss international cooperation in the sphere of units of measurement, the war broke out. France was humiliated by Prussia's military action, but in 1872 France seized the diplomatic initiative and re-issued the invitations for the 1870 conference. The conference met in 1875 and concluded with the signing of the Treaty of the Metre. The principal agreements under the treaty were: * A three-tier organisation would be put into place to provide political (CGPM), scientific (CIPM) and secretarial (BIPM) support for coordinating calibrations of national standards against an international standard. * One of the eighteen seats on the CIPM would always be filled by a Frenchman. * France would provide premises for the secretariat. These premises, at the Pavillon de Breteuil, near Paris would have a diplomatic status. * New prototypes of the kilogram and metre would be manufactured. These were ultimately made in England and delivered in 1889. Thus the French metre and kilogram passed into international control.  International era (1875 onwards)  During the early part of the twentieth century, the French introduced their own units of power - the poncelet, which was defined as being the power required to raise a mass of 100 kg against standard gravity with a velocity of 1 m/s giving a value of 980.665 W. However, many other European countries defined their units of power (the Pferdest√§rke in Germany, the paardekracht in the Netherlands and the cavallo vapore in Italy) using 75 kg rather than 100 kg, which gave a value of 735.49875 W (about 0.985 HP). Eventually, the poncelet was replaced with the cheval vapeur, which was identical to equivalent units of measure in neighbouring countries. In 1977, these units, along with the stere and the livre (and amongst others, the German pfund) were proscribed by EEC Directive 71/354/EEC which required EU member states to standardise on the International System of Units (SI) and therefore to use the watt and its multiples.

It is the story of an Igbo man, Obi Okonkwo, who leaves his village for an education in Britain and then a job in the Nigerian colonial civil service, but is conflicted between his African culture and Western lifestyle and ends up taking a bribe. The novel is the second work in what is sometimes referred to as the \\"African trilogy\\", following Things Fall Apart and preceding Arrow of God. Things Fall Apart concerns the struggle of Obi Okonkwo's grandfather Okonkwo against the changes brought by the English. Novel's title The book's title comes from the closing lines of T. S. Eliot's poem, The Journey of the Magi: We returned to our places, these Kingdoms, But no longer at ease here, With an alien people clutching their gods. I should be glad of another death. Plot summary The novel begins with the trial of Obi Okonkwo on the charge of accepting a bribe. It then jumps back in time to a point before his departure for England and works its way forward to describe how Obi ended up on trial. The members of the Umuofia Progressive Union (UPU), a group of Umuofia natives who have left their villages to live in major Nigerian cities, have taken up a collection to send Obi to England to study Law, in the hope that he will return to help his people by representing them in the colonial legal system, particularly with respect to land cases. However, Obi switches his major to English and meets Clara Okeke, a student nurse, for the first time during a dance. Obi returns to Nigeria after four years of studies and lives in Lagos with his friend Joseph. He takes a job with the Scholarship Board and is almost immediately offered a bribe by a man who is trying to obtain a scholarship for his sister. When Obi indignantly rejects the offer, he is visited by the girl herself, who implies that she will bribe him with sexual favors for the scholarship, another offer Obi rejects. At the same time, Obi is developing a romantic relationship with Clara who reveals that she is an osu, an outcast by her descendants, meaning that Obi cannot marry her under the traditional ways of the Igbos. He remains intent on marrying Clara, but even his Christian father opposes, albeit reluctantly due to his desire to progress and eschew the \\"heathen\\" customs of pre-colonial Nigeria. His mother begs him on her deathbed not to marry Clara until after her death, threatening to kill herself if her son disobeys. When Obi informs Clara of these events, Clara breaks the engagement and intimates that she is pregnant. Obi arranges an abortion which Clara reluctantly undergoes, but she suffers complications and refuses to see Obi. Obi sinks deeper into financial trouble partly due to poor planning on his end, in part due to the need to repay his loan to the UPU and to pay for his siblings' education, and in part due to the cost of the illegal abortion. After hearing of his mother's death, Obi sinks into a deep depression and doesn't go home for the funeral, this is because he thought that the money he would have used to go and come back would be better served in the funeral and to help out across the house. When he recovers, he begins to accept bribes in a reluctant acknowledgement that it is the way of his world. The novel closes as Obi takes a bribe and tells himself that it is the last one he will take, only to discover that the bribe was part of a sting operation. He is arrested, bringing us up to the events that opened the story. Themes Though set several decades after \\"Things Fall Apart\\", \\"No Longer at Ease\\" continues many of the themes from Achebe's first novel. Here, the clash between European culture and traditional culture has become entrenched during the long period of colonial rule. Obi struggles to balance the demands of his family and village for monetary support while simultaneously keeping up with the materialism of Western culture. Furthermore, Achebe depicts a family continuity between Ogbuefi Okonkwo in \\"Things Fall Apart\\" and his grandson Obi Okonkwo in \\"No Longer at Ease\\". Both men are confrontational, speak their minds, and have some self-destructive tendencies. However, this aggressive streak manifests itself in different ways. Where his grandfather was a man of action and violence, Obi is a man of words and thoughts to the exclusion of action. Reception \\"No Longer at Ease\\" debuted to largely positive reviews. Mercedes Mackay of the Royal African Society noted that \\"This second novel of Chinua Achebe is better than his first, and puts this Nigerian at the forefront of West African writers.\\" Arthur Lerner of Los Angeles City College wrote that \\"The second novel of this young Nigerian author continues the promise of its predecessor, Things Fall Apart.\\" The novel was widely praised for its realistic and vivid depictions of life in Lagos in the early 1960s. However, some reviewers felt that Achebe's attention to detail in setting was executed at the expense of fully fleshing out his characters. Ben Mkapa of the W.E.B.

They were roughly as capable as the American GUPPY fleet-boat conversions.Norman Polamr and K. J. Moore, 'Cold War Submarines,' They were a contemporary of the Whiskey-class submarines and shared a similar sonar arrangement. Like most conventional submarines designed 1946-1960, their design was influenced by the German Type XXI U-boat of the World War II era.Sean Maloney, 'To Secure Command of the Sea,' University of New Brunswick thesis 1991, p.315 The first few boats of the class were equipped with twin 57mm and twin 25mm anti-aircraft guns and no snorkels, although the guns were removed and snorkels added soon after the boats entered service.Gardiner, p. 398 Six were converted in 1956 to become the world's first ballistic missile submarines, one armed with a single R-11FM Scud missile and five others with two Scuds each. They were designated as Project AV 611 and received the NATO reporting name of Zulu V. The missiles were too long to be contained in the boat's hull, and extended into the enlarged sail. To be fired, the submarine had to surface and raise the missile out of the sail. Soviet submarine B-67 successfully launched a missile on 16 September 1955. The Zulus were the basis for the very successful Foxtrot-class submarine, which lent their hull to the Golf class of ballistic missile submarine. Twenty-six boats were built overall, entering service from 1952 to 1957, 8 of them in Leningrad and 18 in Severodvinsk. Their names were initially B-61 through B-82 and B-88 through B-91, with most renamed in the 1970s or 1980s. The class received the NATO reporting names Zulu I through Zulu V, the last referring to the five converted missile-firing submarines (excluding the prototype). It is unclear from references how many of each subclass were built. Most were converted to non-combat uses and eventually scrapped.

He led the royal forces in Mesopotamia against the rebel Molon, served as the governor of cis- Tauric Asia Minor from 213 BC onwards, and was a general at the Battle of Magnesia. After that defeat he went to Rome to negotiate a peace.  Career  Zeuxis, son of Kynagos, was engaged in 221 BC in the war with Molon, satrap of Media, whom he prevented from crossing the Tigris.Smith, William (editor); Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, \\"Zeuxis\\", p1324 He was subsequently left in charge of the camp while his commander Xenoetas engaged with Molon. Following Xenoetas‚Äô catastrophic defeat, Zeuxis retreated on the approach of Molon, who was now able to cross the Tigris unopposed. When Antiochus himself marched against Molon, Zeuxis advised him to cross the Tigris in opposition to Hermeias's proposal that the army march down the near side of the river - according to Polybius, despite his fear of Hermeias's power. He was in command of the left wing in the battle that ensued. He also took a prominent part in the siege of Seleucia on the Tigris. It is this same Zeuxis whom we find satrap of Lydia under Antiochus the Great. In the winter of 201-200 BC Philip V of Macedon, when at war with Attalus, applied to Zeuxis for wheat provisions, which he supplied.. He is well attested by inscriptions in his capacity as vice-roy of Asia Minor.J. and L. Robert, Fouilles d'Amyzon en Carie I (Paris, 1983); P. Gauthier, Nouvelles Inscriptions de Sardes II (Paris and Geneva, 1989) In the decisive battle of Magnesia with the Romans in 190 BC, Zeuxis was one of the commanders of the center, and after the defeat of Antiochus was one of the ambassadors sent to Scipio Asiaticus and Scipio Africanus to sue for peace, on which mission he proceeded to Rome. However, by then, the Seleucid position in Anatolia had been so undermined by the campaign of Vulso that he and his fellow ambassador, Antipatros, had little choice other than accept the border on the Taurus.

Regulation of the game can be done completely by a computer or partly deferred to a human referee. Computer-assisted gaming attempts to combine the advantages of PC games with those of face-to-face games. In computer-assisted gaming, computers are used for recordkeeping and sometimes for the resolution of combat, but a Human referee makes any decisions requiring judgement.  Variations  A computer-assisted game can be little more than a collection of rules and notes on computer, or as complete as a computer game, with a human referee needed only to make the non-random decisions. It can be played remotely or with everyone in the same room looking at one or more computer monitors. (The referee must have his own monitor; the players can share one, or each player can have his own. Or only the referee may have a monitor, with the players using paper as usual.) This flexibility allows players to combine the best aspects of paper-and-pencil and computer games while computerizing the game as much or as little as desired. Computer-assisted games are mostly not designed toward recreating the battlefield inside computer memory, but employing the computer to play the role of game master by storing game rules and unit (wargames) or role (role playing games) characteristics, tracking unit or character status and positions or distances, animating the game with sounds and voice and resolving combat (shooting and close combat). All distance relationships are tracked on the tabletop. All record-keeping is tracked by the computer. =Role-playing games= Role-playing games were one of the first types of games for which computer-assisted gaming programs were developed. Computer-aided role-playing game programs are designed to help game masters and players alike. Those programs range from acting as convenient format for a character sheet; or other game materials; all the way up to full automation of the game mechanics of a role-playing game system . This is especially useful for character creation/maintenance and rules resolutions for complex simulationist games. =Poker= There are multiple poker tools that allow players to do statistical analysis of games. An example is a poker calculator, which determines the player's probability of winning, losing, or tying a hand. =Tabletop projection= Another example of computer-assisted gaming growing in popularity among role-playing game players is the use of a digital projector or flat screen monitors to present maps or other visual elements during game play. These elements may be used on their own, or in concert with miniatures to map out combats, and exploration or to introduce other visual media into the game without resorting to printing or drawing these items.; =Webcam data acquisition= Computer-assisted wargaming using the webcam of a tablet. Webcam enabled computer-assisted wargames use computer vision to process firing with images of the camera. In the case of an external USB camera, it is placed behind the firing unit selected (third person shooter) in the direction of the target. When a tablet is used the rear webcam is selected. Precise positioning of the webcam behind the shooting unit is not required : it is sufficient both the shooting unit and the target unit are displayed on the captured image for the shot to be valid. This makes the usage of a tablet very practical for these games. Target detection algorithms (improved magic wand contour, polygon simplification, convex hull algorithms, polygon degree of convexity) allow to analyze the characteristics of the target and to estimate the distance to the target. Damage is computed by taking into the account distance (in distance units) between the firing unit and the target, the type of gun (anti-tank value) of the firing unit and the thickness of the armor of the target (defend value).

Between 2000 and 2009, he was a prominent member of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). In 2007, he unsuccessfully ran for party president. However, he remained one of the main rivals of the former party president Zoran Milanoviƒá. On 5 November 2009, he announced his intention to run for a president, in violation of the party's bylaws which led to his expulsion from the party. On 10 January 2010, he lost the Croatian presidential election to the official SDP candidate Ivo Josipoviƒá in the runoff elections. Although described in 2002 as the SDP's most popular politician for the \\"famous 24 hours he devotes to the service of citizens of Zagreb\\", he has also gained notoriety for a number of actions and statements he has made as mayor. Bandiƒá is viewed as a hands-on mayor because of his ambition and the number of projects related to Zagreb that he has undertaken. He is widely credited for the renovation of Ljubljanska Avenue (now Zagrebaƒçka Avenue), for his work on the Arena Zagreb and the Homeland Bridge (which opened during his third term). Bandiƒá was arrested in the evening hours of 19 October 2014, along with 18 other officials, under the suspicion of malfeasance related to Zagreb Holding. In his absence, his deputy Sandra ≈†valjek took the duties of mayor from 19 October 2014 until 26 March 2015.http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Novosti/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/279857/Bandi- opunomoio-Kusin-za-voenje-Zagreba.aspx Bandiƒá canceled the authorization that he granted to her because some disagreements between them. Consequently, ≈†valjek has resigned all of her duties in city. Bandiƒá's second deputy Vesna Kusin took the duties of mayor on 26 March 2015. On 10 April 2015, Zagreb County Court ruled that Milan Bandiƒá has to be released from prison while pending trial. Consequently, he returned to the position of Mayor.http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/bandic-ostaje-na-slobodi-i-vraca-se- na-mjesto-gradonacelnika/812562.aspx Private life Milan Bandiƒá was born to Jozo and Blagica Bandiƒá (n√©e Tomiƒá) in the small hamlet of Bandiƒáa Brig, a part of Cerov Dolac in the municipality of Grude, Bosnia and Herzegovina (then PR Bosnia and Herzegovina, FPR Yugoslavia).Bandiƒá, Milan. Biografija . Bandiƒá's official web site. Retrieved 2011-10-30 He was the middle child in the family, with an older brother Drago and a younger sister Tonka. His family's main source of income was a tobacco plantation. As a child, Bandiƒá was altar servant in local church. He attended Antun Branko ≈†imiƒá High School in Grude and he was excellent student. In 1974, he moved to Zagreb to study at the Department of Political Science at the University of Zagreb, program of National defense and social self-protection (today non-existent). To pay off his student loans he unloaded sugar and coal and he was also a mason. After graduation, Bandiƒá was conscripted to the Yugoslav People's Army, and after that he was employed in Ledo, producer of ice creams. During his student days he met his wife Vesna. He was married to her until their divorce in 1996, although they still live together in their Stara Pe≈°ƒçenica apartment. They have a daughter, Ana-Marija. Bandiƒá has stated that his divorce was the result of a seven-year separation. Bandiƒá owns two golden retrievers, Bil and Rudi, which he often walks during his work hours. Bandiƒá is an avid distance runner, describing himself as \\"addicted to running\\". He is reported to run 10 kilometers every weekday morning, and in March 2008 completed the 61 km Zagreb‚Äìƒåazma ultramarathon. Political career =Before becoming mayor= After serving the army and short work in Ledo company Bandiƒá was employed in Municipal Committee of League of Communists of Croatia in Pe≈°ƒáenica where he worked as professional political worker. After collapse of SFR Yugoslavia and League of Communists of Croatia Bandiƒá did not want to leave the party because he worked for years in Pe≈°ƒçenica and thus it was matter of pride. He expressed his hopes that he and his colleagues will return to political stage as Croatian social democrats. During the Croatian War of Independence Bandiƒá helped with logistics. Bandiƒá was one of the few Herzegovinian Croats to remain with the party after the first democratic elections in 1990 in which the Communist Party, led by Ivica Raƒçan, reformed and re-branded itself as the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP). He demonstrated organizational ability and populist political instincts. These abilities allowed the SDP to gain in Zagreb blue-collar neighborhoods and attract votes which the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and its then-president Franjo Tuƒëman had considered theirs by default. As such, he proved to be a valuable asset for the Social Democratic Party. In 1993 he became party secretary. Conflict between HDZ and SDP manifested in the 1995 parliamentary and City of Zagreb elections, leading to the Zagreb Crisis: an electoral alliance (in which the SDP was a major partner) won a majority in the Zagreb elections and chose Goran Graniƒá as the new mayor, but Franjo Tuƒëman used a legal loophole to stop Graniƒá from taking office. Several subsequent elections were held, with the SDP winning each time and Tuƒëman promptly removing every candidate. For a time Zagreb was a city without a mayor, which led to public unrest and protests in Ban Jelaƒçiƒá Square. With the final 1997 election of the HDZ candidate Marina Matuloviƒá- Dropuliƒá as the mayor of Zagreb, the crisis faded. Bandiƒá played a role in the crisis by becoming a city councilman in 1995 and the leader of the Zagreb SDP in 1997. During the first campaign his Herzegovinian background became an issue, as the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) suggested that only a native citizen of Zagreb could become the city's mayor. HSS also launched a propaganda campaign against Herzegovinians in an effort to undermine Bandiƒá's campaign. The party hoped that the majority of Zagreb voters would turn away from Bandiƒá. Those expectations were not fulfilled and Bandiƒá later used his Herzegovinian background as an advantage, broadening his support among the ordinary citizens of Zagreb. The HDZ under Bandiƒá eventually lost power in the Croatian capital in 2000. =First and second terms (2000‚Äì2002)= Bandiƒá was elected mayor of Zagreb in 2000 and re-elected in the city election in 2001. His rise in influence among SDP politicians and on the Zagreb political scene created a backlash by the Croatian People's Party (HNS), the other left-of- center party led by Vesna Pusiƒá, who did not trust his nationalist populism and his occasional run-ins with the courts. The HNS campaigned against the SDP in the 2000 elections. However, the HNS entered into a coalition with the SDP in 2001. It governed Zagreb with the SDP until 2005 when it withdrew, again because of Bandiƒá. In 2002, Bandiƒá fled from the scene of a motor vehicle accident while under the influence of alcohol. He tried to bribe the officer who stopped him and threatened the officer with his alleged connections in the Ministry of the Interior. The incident was heavily covered by the media that asked for his resignation. The SDP was at first reluctant to sanction Bandiƒá. Under public pressure, the SDP leadership compelled Bandiƒá to resign. After his resignation there was uncertainty concerning his successor; while the Zagreb SDP had the right to nominate the mayor, it was so dominated by Bandiƒá that it was questionable who could replace him. Eventually Vlasta Paviƒá took over as mayor, while Bandiƒá retained a place in the Zagreb chain of command as deputy mayor. He was eager to become a mayor again, and blocked Paviƒá's development plans (advancing his own) while working toward an early election. In response Ivica Raƒçan (head of the SDP) tried to restrain Bandiƒá's activities. The rules then in force would not allow Bandiƒá to have a second term as mayor during the current term of the assembly. Vlasta Paviƒá attempted to strike a deal ending the ongoing feud, but Bandiƒá eventually succeeded in undermining her. Although no early elections were held, he was re-elected mayor in the May 15, 2005 elections. In April 2004 then-mayor Vlasta Paviƒá criticized Bandiƒá for having spent 15 million kunas (about US$3.26 million) of city money to buy a lot on Heinzelova Avenue which was formerly owned by the meat packing plant Zagrepƒçanka. The controversy was dubbed \\"the Zagrepƒçanka case\\" by the newspapers. The city government could not use the lot, because its ownership was divided among 43 individuals. When (responding to a question from a city counselor) Mayor Paviƒá distanced herself from Bandiƒá, Bandiƒá was accused of cursing her mother in a vulgar way during the talks. He also published a newspaper advertisement on behalf of the city government, entitled Istina je! (\\"It's true!\\"). The advertisement was supported by all SDP members of the city council except Vlasta Paviƒá, the mayor at that time. Ivica Raƒçan later condemned the advertisement as a political mistake, telling the Zagreb SDP that they would face consequences for their action. A court case ensued, with charges being brought against Bandiƒá and others involved. Three years later, Bandiƒá was acquitted and the City of Zagreb was awarded ownership of the Zagrepƒçanka lot in a court judgment. Bandiƒá promised a new business district in the Zagrepƒçanka location. Not all legal troubles have been solved, however, as the city still has to deal with unsolved cases and complaints entered against the lot. In 2008 the sale of the Zagrepƒçanka lot to Institut IGH was announced, but the deal fell through in 2009; this has potential to incur a cost of ‚Ç¨4.5 million to the Zagreb holding company. =Third term (2005‚Äì2009)= Following the illness and death of Raƒçan Bandiƒá announced his candidacy for SDP leadership, planning to resign as mayor afterwards. He competed against ≈Ωeljka Antunoviƒá, Zoran Milanoviƒá and Tonino Picula. Zoran Milanoviƒá was elected on 2 June 2007 as the new SDP leader, while Bandiƒá remained mayor of Zagreb. He did not give up the fight, however, organizing opposition within the party and campaigning to defeat Milanoviƒá in the next party election. A controversy arose on 31 July 2005, when Bandiƒá was on a bus with 30 other people and saw workers waving on the street. He then allegedly cited the Auschwitz motto: \\"Work liberates, the Nazis weren't totally dumb.\\" Hrvoje Kre≈°iƒá, a Novi list journalist, allegedly heard Bandiƒá and published his statement. The following day Bandiƒá threatened to sue Kre≈°iƒá and Novi list; he claimed he said \\"Marxists,\\" not \\"Nazis\\". Bandiƒá's statement was corroborated by several of his nearby colleagues; other journalists at the rear of the bus did not hear anything said by Bandiƒá, due to noise inside the vehicle. Bandiƒá said that if awarded damages, he would donate the money to the Simon Wiesenthal Center. The director of the center, Efraim Zuroff, refused. In January 2006, Bandiƒá publicly threatened a journalist working for Veƒçernji list. The journalist asked Bandiƒá about an offer from a Czech company; Bandiƒá replied aggressively, cursing and threatening the journalist. Afterwards, he claimed he had simply spoken to the journalist in a loud voice. As of October 2007 Bandiƒá was under investigation by the USKOK (Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organized Crime) about several deals he made as mayor of Zagreb, including the July 2007 exchange of a lot at the intersection of Maksimirska Street and ≈†u≈°ak Avenue for a lot in Sesvetski Kraljevec. A court- appointed expert allowed the exchange at a price of 1,300 kuna per square meter (‚Ç¨185) for the Sesvete lot (located in the suburbs, outside the Zagreb bypass) and 2,300 kuna (‚Ç¨321) for the Maksimirska lot (located in the Maksimir district, several hundred meters from downtown). New experts considered the lot on Maksimirska Street to be more valuable than the lot in Sesvetski Kraljevec. Thus, a USKOK source testified that Bandiƒá made a deal damaging to the city budget. The two companies with whom Bandiƒá dealt were headed by inexperienced students, furthering the appearance of impropriety. On 26 June 2008 the Main Committee of SDP received a letter entitled Za ≈°to se, uopƒáe, danas zala≈æe SDP? (\\"What, overall, does the SDP stand for today?\\") by Dra≈æen Laliƒá (a Croatian sociologist) which attacked Bandiƒá by pointing out his misdeeds and errors and questioning Bandiƒá's loyalty to the SDP's principles. The letter was sparked partially by the assault and battery of anti-corruption Zagreb road-authorities director Igor Raƒëenoviƒá, which had not been properly investigated. Another reason was a concert held on Ban Jelaƒçiƒá Square by Marko Perkoviƒá Thompson, a singer known to attract an usta≈°a audience. Bandiƒá supported the concert instead of condemning it, inaccordance with SDP anti- nationalistic principles. Although the letter attacked the SDP as a whole, Bandiƒá was considered a key participant in all events described. Bandiƒá responded to the letter indirectly by encouraging the police to do their job, while failing to appropriately defend his position. Zoran Milanoviƒá responded instead, accusing Laliƒá of trying to buy himself a return to the Croatian political scene. Bandiƒá thus received the SDP's support, ensuring his candidacy in the upcoming 2009 mayoral election. Bandiƒá was involved in the Cvjetni prolaz case (a lengthy affair beginning in 2007), which centered on the controversial demolition and conversion of historical buildings in Petar Preradoviƒá Square into a shopping mall in Zagreb's Lower Town area. The project was headed by developer Tomislav Horvatinƒçiƒá, who was alleged to have used illegal means in an attempt to evict the buildings' residents. These residents included a headquarters and church operated by the Zagreb-Ljubljana metropolia of the Serbian Orthodox Church and the home of the late poet Vladimir Vidriƒá. Bandiƒá is known to be a strong supporter of Horvatinƒçiƒá, publicly criticizing opponents of the project. In August 2008, Horvatinƒçiƒá obtained a license to demolish the old buildings. Residents of the surrounding buildings and environmentalists argued that the license was improperly issued, but the demolition is (as of 2011) still underway. However, Horvatinƒçiƒá is forbidden to demolish Vidriƒá's home or build any part of the project until he obtains a building-location license, which requires him to prove he can build a walkway between Gunduliƒáeva Street and Cvjetni Square. In 2009. Croatian media revealed that Bandiƒá spent 1,55 million kuna (210 000 ‚Ç¨) of city money to build two public toilets. The media mockingly called these \\"The Golden Toilets\\". The media wrote that the job was given to the company T≈ΩV Gredelj, specialized for construction of railway veichles without any tender. Gredelj then hired another company owned by Bandiƒá's godfather to do the actual construction. In 2013. Croatian State Prosecutor's Office for the Suppression of Organized Crime and Corruption announced that they are investigating the case. =Fourth term (2009‚Äì2013)= Until 2009, the mayor of Zagreb was elected by the city assembly (city council). In elections held in the spring of 2009, the mayor was directly elected for the first time. Bandiƒá was forced into a second round not by HDZ candidate (Jasen Mesiƒá) but by outsider Josip Kregar (dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Zagreb), who ran on an independent platform. Bandiƒá won the second round, with 62 percent of the vote to Kregar's 37 percent. In October 2009, Bandiƒá visited the site of a World War II partisan massacre on the island of Daksa with the Croatian Bishops' Conference. On 29 October 2009 Bandiƒá's proposed exceptional budget, with a proposal to hold a referendum on the building of a new football stadium, was rejected. Among those voting against the budget was his own party, the SDP. In 2010, during his fourth term, Bandiƒá provided the voice of the Metroville mayor in the critically and commercially successful Croatian-language version of Megamind, with the other starring roles being prolific actors Ozren Grabariƒá, Igor Me≈°in and Jerko Marƒçiƒá.Milan Bandiƒá i Lana Jurƒçeviƒá u MaksimUmu =Presidential campaign= electionsalt=Pro-Bandiƒá billboard in parking lot, with blue and red letters on white background On 5 November 2009 Bandiƒá announced his presidential candidacy in the 2009‚Äì2010 presidential election after media speculation. Bandiƒá's move resulted in his automatic expulsion from the Social Democratic Party of Croatia and the loss of his positions as party president and leader of the Zagreb branch. He was replaced as leader of the Zagreb SDP by Davor Bernardiƒá. In the 27 December 2009 first round of the election Bandiƒá received 14.83 percent of the vote, placing him in second place after SDP candidate Ivo Josipoviƒá (with 32.7 percent). On 10 January he lost the second round with 39.74 percent of the vote. In Zagreb Bandiƒá lost both rounds of the election, receiving support in only a handful of city neighbourhoods. =Parliamentary election of 2011= On 8 October 2011 Bandiƒá announced that he will compete in Croatian parliamentary election of 2011 with independent list named \\"Stijena\\" ().Bandiƒá na izbore ide s neovisnom listom koju je nazvao Stijena.

Mayoral achievements Bandiƒá at the alt=Bandiƒá smiling and looking to his right, wearing blue-and- white skiing jersey over brown long-sleeved shirt alt=Aerial view of eight- lane highway One of Bandiƒá's best-known projects is the renovation of Ljubljanska Avenue, whose eastern stretch beginning at Svilkoviƒái Street (later Savska Opatovina Rotary) was later renamed to Zagrebaƒçka Avenue. He is also credited with the Zagreb model apartment building (), also locally known as Bandiƒáevi stanovi (\\"Bandiƒá's apartments\\"). Radimir ƒåaƒçiƒá, another investor in the Zagreb apartment market, accused Bandiƒá of trying to undermine the statewide POS housing projects. POS (, \\"subsidized apartments\\") is cheap housing instituted by Radimir ƒåaƒçiƒá during the coalition of SDP, Bandiƒá's party, and several other parties (such as ƒåaƒçiƒá's HNS, which ruled the Croatian government from 2000 to 2003). Bandiƒá has heavily criticized the state of Zagreb's transportation system which he encountered at the beginning of his mayoral career. With the guidance of Zagreb traffic engineers Bandiƒá has approved ambitious transportation projects in Zagreb, such as the Ljubljanska/Zagrebaƒçka Avenue widening, Homeland Bridge construction, renovation of the green wave system in the city center with the addition of bicycle paths and multi-level underground parking garages at Tu≈°kanac, Kvaternik Square and other locations. Bandiƒá has arranged the construction of the Arena Zagreb, a handball arena located in Lani≈°te, which was constructed to prepare the city for the 2009 World Men's Handball Championship. Honors On July 10, 2009, Bandiƒá was made an honorary citizen of Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina. On November 4, 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin honored Bandiƒá with an Order of Friendship. Health problems On 3 July 2003 after a session of the Zagreb City Council Bandiƒá requested medical assistance, stating that he had begun to feel ill during the session. The media reported that he had suffered a minor stroke; the official explanation was that exhaustion and overwork had caused a blood vessel in his endocranium to spasm. He was hospitalized for a few weeks, then went to Krapinske Toplice to recover, and returned to his duties in September.

The character was created by Mark Gruenwald. Fictional character biography The Shape (real name Raleigh Lund) was born in Simak, Lowengard, in the U.S.A. of the alternate Earth of the Squadron Supreme, Earth-712. Although he appears to be an adult male, his emotional and intellectual development is comparable to that of a child. Originally, he was a member of the criminal Institute of Evil, the Squadron's arch-foes, although, lacking sincere criminal intent, he was mostly following the lead of team leader Ape-X, who had been his friend \\"for years and years.\\" After the Institute of Evil lost a battle against the Squadron,Squadron Supreme #5 all of the Institute's members underwent behavior modification, their criminal records were pardoned, and they all joined the Squadron.Squadron Supreme #5 Now, as a public crusader and adventurer, Shape helped supervise the manufacturing of force field belts.Squadron Supreme #8 He also helped his fellow superheroes and babysat for Arcanna Jones' three children, becoming especially close with Drusilla Jones.Squadron Supreme #9 Eventually the behavior modification was reversed by the Squadron's opponents the Redeemers, but the Shape, having never been a criminal at heart in the first place, still chose to side with the Squadron against Nighthawk and the Redeemers. After the battle, Shape helped get the pregnant Arcanna to the delivery room after she collapsed.Squadron Supreme #12 Later, Shape accompanied the Squadron in a futile struggle against the Nth Man.Squadron Supreme Graphic Novel As a result, Shape and the Squadron traveled to Earth. There, Shape and Haywire were mentally coerced by the Over-Mind to prevent Quasar from following the starship in which the Over-Mind had kidnapped the Squadron Supreme.Quasar #13 Powers and abilities The Shape's entire body is extremely rubbery, putty- like and malleable. He has approximately of body mass that he can shift from one area of his body to another; when he is relaxed it settles in his legs and lower body. He can shift up to 80% of his physical mass at will, thus altering his entire shape. He can use this mass to elongate, compress, or enlarge various parts of his body, or form non-humanoid shapes such as hammer-shaped fists or a trampoline-shaped torso, or taking the shape of a hang glider. His bones stretch to a maximum of five times their ordinary length. The Shape's below normal intelligence prevents him from thinking of more creative uses for his shifting body mass. His body tissue can resist extreme temperatures and pressures, burning, lacerations, ballistic penetration, and impacts, without sustaining injury. The Shape has a high physical pain threshold, and superhuman durability. He is not invulnerable; certain extreme physical injuries are beyond his ability to resist. Other versions =Supreme Power= In Part III: High Command, Shape is introduced as Raleigh Lund, a dim-witted, morbidly obese former janitor abandoned as a child by his parents. He survived from a very early age by eating discarded food and sleeping in dumpsters. He possesses superhuman strength and apparent invulnerability. In Supreme Power: Hyperion, he is described by General Alexander as the perfect soldier‚Äîloyal, invulnerable, and strong‚Äîthough he is quite lacking in the area of independent thought and strategy.

Mr. Bowen was an avid member of the Corinthian Sailing Club in the late 1930s and early 1940s. He designed and built several fast and beautiful sailboats in the garage of his home located on Ross Avenue in Dallas TX. He built the boats specifically for club sponsored racing events on White Rock Lake. White Rock Lake is a reservoir located in north-east Dallas, Texas (United States). The lake was formed by damming White Rock Creek, which today widens into the lake before continuing south out of the spillway and emptying into the Trinity River. The lake covers 1,254 acres (5.1 km2) in the east Dallas community. History Before it was a lake, White Rock Lake was a collection of farms owned by the Daniel and Cox families. The first record of the Daniel family farm is in the Family Bible of Thomas Walker Daniel. He and his wife Frances Herndon Daniel seem to have moved to the White Rock area in the late 1830s and early 1840s. Daniel's son had a good friend during the civil war named Cox. When the war was over, the Cox family moved to land adjacent to the Daniel family. Together they had a joint family cemetery called the Daniel-Cox Cemetery. Other pioneer families such as the Humbards, the Glovers, Lavenders, McCommases, Coxes and Donagheys jointly maintained the cemetery. Construction on White Rock Lake began in 1910 in response to a water shortage in Dallas. After the lake was completed in 1911, residential construction around the lake increased, and in the early 1930s the Dallas Park Board, with the help of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), began developing the lakeshores into a municipal park. The White Rock CCC Camp was established at Winfrey Point and included eight barracks buildings. For several years, the men of the CCC deepened and widened the lake, built numerous limestone rock buildings, and made recreation improvements to the park. At the outbreak of WWII, the U.S. Army used the CCC camp as induction point for new recruits. In 1943 the government used the barracks at Winfrey Point to house 403 German prisoners-of-war who had served in Rommel's Afrika Corps. The growing population of Dallas and a drought increased the demand for water, and on September 1, 1952, the beaches of White Rock saw their last swimmers in order to maintain a sanitary water supply. By 1992 White Rock Lake Park was a center of recreational activity for central Dallas, providing picnic areas and bicycle and jogging paths. All that is left of the Daniel and Cox farms is the old \\"Daniel-Cox family cemetery.\\" The Daniel family fell upon hard times and when the cemetery was renovated, the Cox family contributed funds to renovate the cemetery so the current sign reads \\"Cox Cemetery\\".  White Rock Dam  White Rock Dam was completed in 1911 as an earthen dam with a height of 47 feet, a length of 2550 feet at its crest, for storm water control and municipal water supply. With a maximum storage capacity of 39,400 acre-feet, the facility is owned and operated by the City of Dallas.http://ce- npdp-serv2.stanford.edu/DamDirectory/DamDetail.jsp?npdp_id=TX00840  Recreation  Canoeing and paddle boarding on White Rock Lake, TX, July 2014 After its function primarily as a water source was supplanted, White Rock Lake continued to serve as a recreational lake for both City of Dallas and suburban residents. From its earliest days, area residents wanting to get away from home constructed cabins on leased property along its shoreline. The Bonnie Barge, for example, was operated on the lake by Garland resident John H. Williams, Sr. from 1946 to 1956. White Rock offers a number of activities, but one it has become most notable for is rowing. They have a historical boathouse and dock where boats are launched off of almost every day by rowers of all ages. There are also sometimes races that people watch from their sail boats or around the lake. Although originally permitted, swimming was banned in September 1952 and a ban on motorized boats followed in 1958. Current recreational activities on the lake include sailing, kayaking, canoeing and standup paddleboarding, available by rental. The lake is surrounded by White Rock Lake Park, which features a 9.33 mile (15 km) trail for hiking, running and bicycling, the Bath House Cultural Center and the Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden. There are several fishing piers and sailing is permitted. The Bath House once served as a boathouse for several crew teams, including SMU. White Rock Boathouse (established in 1930) was originally used for motor boats, but was later adapted to house sculling boats. The Boathouse later went on to lease the old Filter Building http://www.thefilterbuilding.com/ and holding tanks from the former purification facility and converted them into what may be the largest boathouse worldwide. This building currently houses the boats for SMU, Jesuit Prep, and White Rock Boathouse's own crew teams.http://whiterockrowing.org/  Sailing  The Corinthian Sailing Club was chartered in 1939 to promote the sport of sailing and sailboat racing in the Dallas area. The club focuses on racing with well attended Saturday and Sunday afternoon races, Wednesday evening \\"fun\\" races, club sponsored regattas held year round, and several major annual regattas. The club is nationally known for its excellent sailors and fine race management. CSC, located on beautiful White Rock Lake in Dallas, also sponsors many social activities, teaches adult sailing and supports an active juniors program. The White Rock Boat Club was formed in 1961 as the brainchild of three members of the Corinthian Sailing Club. CSC was having a problem with tracking davit ownership and the price of davits escalated due to demand since the club had no control over prices. Two of the founders, the Oetkings, had also developed a fine catamaran called the Hellcat and had gone into production with growing sales, but they couldn't find davits at CSC. WRBC was constructed not only to supply reasonably priced davits, but to help sell Hellcats. The club sold davits to help pay for the construction of the club, with the provision that the club could buy the davit back if the owner left the club. The club has exercised this right and now owns and leases most of its davits. The club was constructed with a few differences from its present configuration as can be seen in the 1968 photo above. In order to promote organized class sailing, WRBC at one time limited the type of boats kept at the club to racing classes. In the 1970s, the following classes of sailboats were eligible for membership: Butterfly, Coronado 15, Flying Scot, Harpoon, Lido, Lone Star 13, MC Scow, M16 Scow, M20 Scow and Rebel. The club remains active on the lake today. White Rock Lake is also home to the Southern Methodist University Sailing Club which uses the lake primarily as the team's practice water = White Rock Marathon = Many events are held at White Rock Lake, including the White Rock Marathon, which, for part of the course, runs around the lake.Dallas White Rock Marathon - Course Information. Retrieved 9 November 2006. The White Rock Marathon is recognized as a top 10 marathon within the United States, and serves as a Boston Marathon qualifier. The primary beneficiary of the marathon is Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children.  Flora  Dozens of varieties of trees, and more than 100 grass and plant species exist in the park. Known as a jewel in the crown of the Dallas Park System, it is visited by over 1 million visitors a year. Today, the park has an ecosystem that includes grasses, trees, flowers and wildlife that are indigenous to the North Texas area. Grasslands include black prairie grasses as well as more invasive species like Queen Anne's Lace. Wildflowers are planted in un-mowed areas and bloom in late spring. Photos can be taken especially off the East Lawther Trail and close to Mockingbird Lane.  Fauna  Dozens of species of birds call this lake home. The ecosystem of the waterfront makes it a perfect nesting place for small and large water birds including herons, egrets, geese, ducks and pelicans, along with woodland birds such as owls, hawks and eagles. Some feral bird species may also be identified, including parakeets that feed near the trees right off the trail. The wildlife at White Rock Lake is thriving. From squirrels and beavers to larger animals which are white-tailed deer, raccoons, red foxes, bobcats, wild boars, river otters, minks, opossums, skunks and coyotes. White Rock is home to many animals that keep this park in balance. You can see many of these land animals near the Old Fish Hatchery. The lake contains catfish, sunfish, crappie, carp, gar, and bass. A handful of reports in the early 1990s claim that Hagfish had been spotted in White Rock Lake as well. Largemouth bass are found around structures like the reed beds, mouths of creeks, and up Dickson Branch.  Folklore  A well-known Dallas urban legend is the story of the Lady of White Rock Lake. White Rock Lake Park is reported to be haunted by the ghost of a twenty-year-old-looking girl, described as wearing a water-soaked 1930s evening dress, who usually appears at night along the roadside of East Lawther Drive. Witnesses claim the phantom asks to be taken to her home on Gaston Avenue in Dallas before disappearing in the car during the ride leaving a waterlogged car seat. Legend claims the woman to be a drowning victim from a boating accident in the 1930s. Reports of the ghostly encounters were published in Dallas-area newspapers in the 1960s. This legend is said to have been the inspiration for the bluegrass song Bringing Mary Home,This is according to Frankie Miller, on page 69 of the liner notes of his Bear Family Box Set Blackland Farmer. written by John Duffey of The Country Gentlemen. Their version of the song made the Billboard Country Chart in 1965. The song has since been recorded by many others, including Frankie Miller, Mac Wiseman, Red Sovine, Ricky Skaggs, and Daniel O'Donnell. It is now regarded by many as a bluegrass standard. The legend was also the inspiration for Lakewood Brewing Company's second Legendary Series release, La Dame du Lac, a French farmhouse-style bi√®re de garde. Another Lake pastime popular with young adults was viewing The Submarine Races. When there were no curfews at the park, it became a popular spot for high schoolers wanting a deserted, yet beautiful spot for necking. Whether in a car or on a blanket, viewing The Submarine Races at White Rock Lake is still very popular. The lake was shown on a map in the beginning of the TV show Cheaters.

They use a protective sign such as the red cross, red crescent, or red crystal. Attacking medical personnel, vehicles, or buildings marked with one of these protective signs is a war crime. The emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, under the Geneva Conventions, are to be placed on humanitarian and medical vehicles and buildings, and to be worn by medical personnel and others carrying out humanitarian work, to protect them from military attack on the battlefield. There are four such emblems, three of which are in use: the Red Cross, the Red Crescent, and the Red Crystal. The Red Lion and Sun is also a recognized emblem, but is no longer in use. There were also prior disputes concerning the use of a Red Star of David by Magen David Adom (MDA), the Israeli first-aid society; the Red Crystal was created in response to these disputes, thus enabling the admission of MDA to the movement.

After objections from the movement, derivatives and alternatives have come to be used instead. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson has registered the symbol for their medicinal products.

On one hand, the visual symbols of the Red Cross, the Red Crescent, the Red Lion with Sun and the Red Crystal serve as protection markings in armed conflicts, a denotation which is derived from and defined in the Geneva Conventions. This is called the protective use of the symbols. On the other hand, these symbols are used as distinctive logos by those organizations which are part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. This is the indicative use of the emblems, a meaning which is defined in the statutes of the International Movement and partly in the third Additional Protocol. As a protection symbol, they are used in armed conflicts to mark persons and objects (buildings, vehicles, etc.) which are working in compliance with the rules of the Geneva Conventions. In this function, they can also be used by organizations and objects which are not part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, for example the medical services of the armed forces, civilian hospitals, and civil defense units. As protection symbols, these emblems should be used without any additional specification (textual or otherwise) and in a prominent manner which makes them as visible and observable as possible, for example by using large white flags bearing the symbol. Four of these symbols, namely the Red Cross, the Red Crescent, the Red Lion with Sun and the Red Crystal, are defined in the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols as symbols for protective use. When used as an organizational logo, these symbols only indicate that persons, vehicles, buildings, etc. which bear the symbols belong to a specific organization which is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (like the ICRC, the International Federation or the national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies). In this case, they should be used with an additional specification (for example \\"American Red Cross\\") and not be displayed as prominently as when used as protection symbols. Three of these symbols, namely the Red Cross, the Red Crescent and the Red Crystal, can be used for indicative purposes by national societies for use in their home country or abroad. In addition to that, the Red Shield of David can be used by the Israel society Magen David Adom for indicative purposes within Israel, and, pending the approval of the respective host country, in combination with the Red Crystal when working abroad. =Red Cross= The Red Cross symbol The Red Cross on white background was the original protection symbol declared at the 1864 Geneva Convention. The ideas to introduce a uniform and neutral protection symbol as well as its specific design originally came from Dr. Louis Appia, a Swiss surgeon, and Swiss General Henri Dufour, founding members of the International Committee. The red cross symbolizes as an identifier for medical personnel during wartime. The Red Cross is defined as a protection symbol in Article 7 of the 1864 Geneva Convention, Chapter VII (\\"The distinctive emblem\\") and Article 38 of the 1949 Geneva Convention (\\"For the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field\\"). There is an unofficial agreement within the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement that the shape of the cross should be a cross composed of five squares. However, regardless of the shape, any Red Cross on white background should be valid and must be recognized as a protection symbol in conflict. Of the 190 National Societies which are currently recognized by the ICRC, 154 are using the Red Cross as their official organization emblem. Relationship to the flag of Switzerland The Swiss flag According to the ICRC, the emblem adopted was formed by reversing the colours of the Swiss flag of Switzerland. This was officially recorded in the 1906 revision of the Convention. However, according to jurist and Red Cross historian Pierre Boissier, no clear evidence of this origin has been found; the concept that the design was chosen to complement the country in which the convention at which it was adopted was held, was also promoted later to counter the objections of Turkey that the flag was a Christian symbol. =Red Crescent= The Red Crescent symbol During the Russo- Turkish War from 1876 to 1878, the Ottoman Empire used a Red Crescent instead of the Red Cross because its government believed that the cross would alienate its Muslim soldiers. When asked by the ICRC in 1877, Russia committed to fully respect the sanctity of all persons and facilities bearing the Red Crescent symbol, followed by a similar commitment from the Ottoman government to respect the Red Cross. After this de facto assessment of equal validity to both symbols, the ICRC declared in 1878 that it should be possible in principle to adopt an additional official protection symbol for non-Christian countries. The Red Crescent was formally recognized in 1929 when the Geneva Conventions were amended (Article 19). After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the Red Crescent was first used by its successor nation Turkey, followed by Egypt. From its official recognition to today, the Red Crescent became the organizational emblem of nearly every national society in countries with majority Muslim populations. The national societies of some countries such as Pakistan (1974), Malaysia (1975), or Bangladesh (1989) have officially changed their name and emblem from the Red Cross to the Red Crescent. The Red Crescent is used by 33 of the 190 recognized societies worldwide. =Red Crystal= The third protocol emblem, also known as the Red Crystal The introduction of an additional neutral protection symbol had been under discussion for a number of years, with the Red Crystal (previously referred to as the Red Lozenge or Red Diamond) being the most popular proposal. However, amending the Geneva Conventions to add a new protection symbol requires a diplomatic conference of all 192 signatory states to the Conventions. The Swiss government organized such a conference to take place on December 5‚Äì6, 2005, to adopt a third additional protocol to the Geneva Conventions introducing the Red Crystal as an additional symbol with equal status to the Red Cross or Red Crescent. Following an unplanned extension of the conference until December 7, the protocol was adopted after a vote successfully achieved the required two-thirds majority. From the countries which attended the conference, 98 voted in favour and 27 against the protocol, while 10 countries abstained from voting. In the third Protocol the new symbol is referred to as \\"the third Protocol emblem\\".paragraph 2 of Article 2 of AP-3: \\"This distinctive emblem is referred to in this Protocol as the third Protocol emblem.\\" The rules for the use of this symbol, based on the third additional protocol to the Geneva Conventions, are the following: * Within its own national territory, a national society can use either of the recognized symbols alone, or incorporate any of these symbols or a combination of them into the Red Crystal. Furthermore, a national society can choose to display a previously and effectively used symbol, after officially communicating this symbol to the state parties of the Geneva Conventions through Switzerland as the depositary state prior to the adoption of the proposed third additional protocol. * For indicative use on foreign territory, a national society which does not use one of the recognized symbols as its emblem has to incorporate its unique symbol into the Red Crystal, based on the previously mentioned condition about communicating its unique symbol to the state parties of the Geneva Conventions. * For protective use, only the symbols recognized by the Geneva Conventions can be used. Specifically, those national societies which do not use one of the recognized symbols as their emblem have to use the Red Crystal without incorporation of any additional symbol. On 22 June 2006 the ICRC announced that the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement adopted the Red Crystal as an additional emblem for use by the national societies. The ICRC also announced the recognition of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and the Israeli National Society, Magen David Adom (MDA).\\"The 29th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent has amended the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to incorporate the additional emblem of the red crystal, which now has the same status as the red cross and red crescent. [...] the ICRC has now recognized the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and the Israeli National Society, Magen David Adom (MDA)\\" Singapore Red Cross Website - IFRC Press Releases - 22 June 2006 , 22-06-2006 On 14 January 2007, the third additional protocol entered into force. =Red Lion with Sun= The Red Lion with Sun symbol From 1924 to 1980, Iran used a Red Lion with Sun symbol for its national society, the Red Lion and Sun Society, based on the flag and emblem of Iran. The Red Lion with Sun was formally recognized as a protection symbol in 1929, together with the Red Crescent. Despite the country's shift to the Red Crescent in 1980, Iran explicitly maintains the right to use the symbol. =Red Shield of David= Emblem of Magen David Adom for indicative use within Israel The emblem for Magen David Adom for indicative use when operating abroad Magen David Adom, the national society of Israel, has used the Red Shield of David as its organization emblem since its foundation. The Red Shield of David was initially proposed as an addition to the Red Cross, Red Crescent, and Red Lion with Sun in 1931. The proposal was rejected by the ICRC, like the Mehrab-e-Ahmar (Red Archway) symbol of the national aid society of Afghanistan four years later, as well as a wide range of other proposals, due to concerns about symbol proliferation. Israel again tried to establish the emblem as a third protection symbol in the context of the Geneva Conventions, but a respective proposal was narrowly defeated when the Geneva Conventions were adopted by governments in 1949. As the Red Shield of David is not a recognized protection symbol under the Geneva Conventions, Magen David Adom's recognition as a national society by the ICRC was long delayed. It was not until 2006 that the ICRC officially recognized Magen David Adom.Israel allowed to join Red Cross, BBC News, June 22, 2006. The adoption of the third protocol emblem paved the way for the recognition and admission of Magen David Adom as a full member of the International Federation, as the rules of the third protocol allow it to continue using the Red Shield of David when operating within Israel and provide a solution for its missions abroad. Though the organization only recently gained official recognition, it took part in many international activities, in cooperation with both the ICRC and the Federation, prior to its official recognition. =Other proposed symbols= Various other countries have also lobbied for alternative symbols, which have been rejected because of concerns of territorialism. * Red Flame (Siam) ‚Äì Proposed by Siamese delegates at the Hague Peace Conference of 1899.Jean S Pictet, Commentaries on the First Geneva Convention of 1949 at p 298-9 * Red Sun (Persia) ‚Äì Proposed by Persian delegates at the Hague Peace Conference of 1899. * Mehrab-e-Ahmar (Afghanistan) ‚Äì Archway design submitted in 1935, but rejected. * Red Lamb (Republic of the Congo (L√©opoldville)) ‚Äì Used by one of several rival societies in 1963 to 1964. * Red Wheel (India) ‚Äì Hindu swastika design proposed after the Indian independence movement, but abandoned in favor of the Red Cross. * Hakuai Sha (Japan), based on the Japanese flag ‚Äì Founded in 1877, but adopted the Red Cross in 1887. * Red Cedar (Lebanon) ‚Äì Suggested after the Lebanese Civil War, but abandoned in favor of the Red Cross. * Red Rhinoceros (Sudan) ‚Äì Proposed to unite local branches of the Red Crescent Society of Egypt and the British Red Cross, but abandoned in favor of the Red Crescent. * Red Palm (Syria) ‚Äì Proposed after World War II, but rejected in favor of the Red Crescent. * Sapa Unalom Daeng (Thailand) ‚Äì Founded in 1893, but adopted the Red Cross in 1906. * Red Star (Zimbabwe) * Red Triangle (Netherlands) ‚Äì Suggested at the Hague Peace Conference of 1949, but abandoned in favor of the Red Cross. In 1922, a Red Swastika Society was formed in China during the Warlord era. The swastika is used in East, South and Southeast Asia as a symbol to represent Dharma or Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism in general. While the organization has organized philanthropic relief projects (both domestic and international), as a sectarian religious body it is ineligible for recognition from the International Committee. Its headquarters are now in Taiwan. Mottos and mission statements The original motto of the International Committee of the Red Cross was Inter Arma Caritas (\\"In War, Charity\\"). This Christian-spirited slogan was amended in 1961 with the neutral motto Per Humanitatem ad Pacem or \\"With humanity, towards peace\\". While Inter Arma Caritas is still the primary motto of the ICRC (as per Article 3 of the ICRC statutes), Per Humanitatem ad Pacem is the primary motto of the Federation (Article 1 of the Constitution of the Federation). Both organizations acknowledge the alternative motto, and together both slogans serve as the combined motto of the International Movement. The mission statement of the International Movement as formulated in the \\"Strategy 2010\\" document of the Federation is to improve the lives of vulnerable people by mobilizing the power of humanity. From 1999 to 2004, the common slogan for all activities of the International Movement was The Power of Humanity. In December 2003, the 28th International Conference in Geneva adopted the conference motto Protecting Human Dignity as the new Movement slogan. Annual commemoration The 16th International Conference which convened in London in 1938 officially decided to make May 8, the birthday of Henry Dunant, as the official annual commemoration and celebration day of the Movement. Since 1984, the official name of the celebration day has been \\"World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day\\". Museums In Solferino, a small museum describes the history of the Battle of Solferino and of the Risorgimento, the long and bloody Italian struggle for independence and unity. In the Ossario di Solferino (Solferino Ossuary) in close proximity to the museum, a moving display shows the horrors of war. Inside the chapel, 1,413 skulls and many more bones from thousands of French and Austrian troops who died during the battle are shown. Solferino is also host to the International Red Cross Memorial inaugurated in 1959 on the centennial of the Battle of Solferino. The memorial contains stone plaques identifying each recognized national society. In Castiglione delle Stiviere, a small town near Solferino, the International Museum of the Red Cross was also opened in 1959. Moreover, another museum, the International Red Cross Museum stands in Geneva in close proximity to the headquarters of the ICRC. Finally, in the Swiss village of Heiden, the Henry Dunant Museum was opened to preserve the memory and legacy of Dunant himself. Use of the emblems Belgian Red Cross volunteers Example of unauthorized use of the Red Cross symbol, in this case, for an appliance repair company As specified by the Geneva Conventions, the four recognized emblems are to be used only to denote the following: * facilities for the care of injured and sick armed forces members; * armed forces medical personnel and equipment; * military chaplains; * International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and the 190 national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies. In order to ensure universal respect for the emblems, the Geneva Conventions obliged their signatories to forbid any other use of the names and emblems in wartime and peacetime. Nevertheless, the illegal usage of the emblem is widespread and it is often used as a general symbol to indicate first aid, medical supplies and civilian medical services especially in walk-in clinics. Such uses appear in movies (a notable example is The Living Daylights, wherein narcotics were disguised as Red Cross care packages, as a plot device), on television, and in computer software and games. Service companies, such as those for car repair or lawn maintenance, tout themselves as service \\"doctors\\" and incorporate medical symbols to promote themselves. Prior to 1973, ambulances in the United States and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere were typically marked with a safety orange cross, differing from the red cross only in its hue. Toys and paintings of ambulances commonly ignored even that nuance, instead using a red cross. After protests from the American Red Cross that the safety orange cross was insufficiently distinguishable from the protected Red Cross symbol, the U.S. Department of Transportation developed the blue Star of Life as a replacement for the safety orange cross. The blue Star of Life has since been adopted throughout much of the world on ambulances and in other related applications. In 2006, the Canadian Red Cross issued a press release asking video game makers to stop using the red cross in their games; it is an especially common sight to see first aid kits and other items which restore the player character's health marked with a red cross. In order to avoid this conflict, a green cross is often used as a generic alternative. Pre-existing trademarks are protected in the implementing legislation of other countries, including Australia,Implementing Laws and Regulations, Australia New Zealand,Implementing Laws and Regulations, New Zealand and the United Kingdom and its dependencies.Implementing Laws and Regulations, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland In many countries, it is a violation of the rule of law to seize intellectual property lawfully created prior to a ban without compensating its owner through eminent domain, with limited exceptions for offensive or dangerous uses. (For example, a Red Cross on a building conveys a potentially false and dangerous impression of military presence in the area to enemy aircraft, although the building itself would not be attacked; thus the U.S. reservations to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, as noted below, effectively ban that use.) In recognition of this fact, Protocol III expressly preserves most pre-2005 trademarks containing the Red Crystal, as long as they cannot be confused with military uses. Trademarks from after 2005 bearing the emblem are banned as there is no longer an issue of retroactive law. The flag of Tonga designed in 1862 happened to be a red cross on a white field; in 1866, when the similarity to the Red Cross flag was noted, the Tonga flag was changed to put the red cross in a canton. =International protection of images= The protected status of these images was established in the First Geneva Convention which states: * Art. 44. With the exception of the cases mentioned in the following paragraphs of the present Article, the emblem of the red cross on a white ground and the words \\"Red Cross\\" or \\" Geneva Cross \\" may not be employed, either in time of peace or in time of war, except to indicate or to protect the medical units and establishments, the personnel and material protected by the present Convention and other Conventions dealing with similar matters. The same shall apply to the emblems mentioned in Article 38, second paragraph, in respect of the countries which use them. The National Red Cross Societies and other societies designated in Article 26 shall have the right to use the distinctive emblem conferring the protection of the Convention only within the framework of the present paragraph. * Art. 44. (cont.) Furthermore, National Red Cross (Red Crescent, Red Lion and Sun) Societies may, in time of peace, in accordance with their national legislation, make use of the name and emblem of the Red Cross for their other activities which are in conformity with the principles laid down by the International Red Cross Conferences. When those activities are carried out in time of war, the conditions for the use of the emblem shall be such that it cannot be considered as conferring the protection of the Convention; the emblem shall be comparatively small in size and may not be placed on armlets or on the roofs of buildings. * Art. 53 furthermore declares all present and future unapproved usage of said symbols illegal, even when they had been used previously. Signatories of the contract would have had three years after signing to enforce this. As a reference to Switzerland, Article 53 also forbids the use of its flag as a trademark, for advertising or other similar purposes. =Use of the emblems in Canada= The Red Cross, Red Crescent, Red Crystal, and Red Lion and Sun emblems are protected under the Trade-marks Act, section 9(1), paragraphs f, g, g.1, and h, respectively: :Prohibited marks :9 (1) No person shall adopt in connection with a business, as a trade-mark or otherwise, any mark consisting of, or so nearly resembling as to be likely to be mistaken for, ::[...] ::(f) the emblem of the Red Cross on a white ground, formed by reversing the federal colours of Switzerland and retained by the Geneva Convention for the Protection of War Victims of 1949 as the emblem and distinctive sign of the Medical Service of armed forces and used by the Canadian Red Cross Society, or the expression ‚ÄúRed Cross‚Äù or ‚ÄúGeneva Cross‚Äù; ::(g) the emblem of the Red Crescent on a white ground adopted for the same purpose as specified in paragraph (f); ::(g.1) the third Protocol emblem ‚Äî commonly known as the ‚ÄúRed Crystal‚Äù ‚Äî referred to in Article 2, paragraph 2 of Schedule VII to the Geneva Conventions Act and composed of a red frame in the shape of a square on edge on a white ground, adopted for the same purpose as specified in paragraph (f); ::(h) the equivalent sign of the Red Lion and Sun used by Iran for the same purpose as specified in paragraph (f); ::[...] =Use of the emblems in Hong Kong= The , in Section 3(c) \\"Unauthorized distribution of badges and products\\", states: This restriction on the use of the emblem was added in 1995. = Use of the emblems in Singapore = The use of the emblems in Singapore is governed by Geneva Conventions Act (Cap 117). =Use of the emblems in the United Kingdom= The use of the emblems in the United Kingdom are governed by Geneva Conventions Act 1957 as amended by Geneva Conventions (Amendment) Act 1995 and several Orders as Statutory Instruments. Geneva Conventions and United Nations Personnel (Protocols) Act 2009 extended the protection to the Red Crystal. The unauthorised use of the Red Cross on a pantomime costume in Glasgow in 2011 resulted in a request for its removal. =Use of the emblems in the United States= A notable exception to this is the United States where, although the United States first ratified the Geneva Conventions in 1882, for 18 years no legislation was passed to enact treaty obligations regarding the protection of the Red Cross symbol. On 6 June 1900, the bill to charter the American National Red Cross (ARC) was signed into law. Section 4, which ultimately was codified as 18 U.S.C. ¬ß706, protected the Greek red cross symbol by making it a misdemeanor for any person or association to use the Red Cross name or emblem without the organization's permission. Penalties included imprisonment not to exceed one year and a fine between $1 and $500, payable to the ARC. There had been seven trademark registrations for Greek red crosses by entities unrelated to the Red Cross at the time the ARC was incorporated. The existence of these users was recognized in congressional discussion of the act. However, lawmakers took no action to prohibit the rights of these earlier users. In 1905, when Congress was revising the ARC's charter, the issue of pre-existing rights to use the emblem was again raised. Lawmakers reiterated Congress' intent that the prohibitions on use of the Red Cross name and emblem did not make unlawful the use of the Greek red cross by those with otherwise established rights. However, these sentiments were again not reflected in the Red Cross charter revision. At the time of the 1905 revision, the number of trademark registrations with a Greek red cross had grown to 61, including several by Johnson & Johnson. Concerned over potential pre-emption, commercial users lobbied for codification of their existing trademark rights. In 1910, Congress formally established that lawful use of the Red Cross name and emblem that began prior to 5 January 1905, could continue, but only if that use was \\"for the same purpose and for the same class of goods.\\" Later, the U.S. ratified the 1949 revisions to the Geneva Conventions with a specific reservation that pre-1905 Red Cross trademarks would not be disturbed as long as the Red Cross is not used on \\"aircraft, vessels, vehicles, buildings or other structures, or upon the ground\\", all of which are likely to be confused with military uses. Until 2007, U.S. law protected only the Red Cross, and permitted its use only by the ARC and U.S. armed forces; though its use by non-U.S. organizations would normally be implied by the ARC's membership in IFRC and the standard protocols of the military and the Red Cross & Red Crescent movement, the ARC's withholding of IFRC dues from 2000 to 2006 over the Magen David Adom (MDA) issue raised concerns. Both to implement Protocol III (which had received advice and consent from the United States Senate in 2006; the U.S. formalized its ratification in March 2007) and to address these concerns, the Geneva Distinctive Emblems Protection Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-481) was signed into law 12 January 2007, two days before Protocol III went into effect. The law, codified as 18 U.S.C. ¬ß706a, extended full legal protection to the Red Crescent and Red Crystal (but not the Red Lion and Sun) in the U.S., subject to private uses prior to the signing of Protocol III that cannot be confused with military uses; permitted the use of all appropriate emblems under the Conventions by the ICRC, the IFRC, all national Red Cross & Red Crescent societies (including MDA by this time), and \\"(t)he sanitary and hospital authorities of the armed forces of State Parties to the Geneva Conventions\\"; and permitted the United States Attorney General to obtain injunctions against improper use of the Red Cross, Red Crescent, and Red Crystal in the U.S. U.S. law still does not specifically protect the right of military chaplains to use the emblems under the Geneva Conventions; however, military chaplains that are part of their armed forces' \\"sanitary and hospital authorities\\" would have the right to use the emblems in the U.S. The ARC and other Red Cross & Red Crescent entities also employ chaplains; they are entitled to use the emblems through their employment. Johnson & Johnson v. American Red Cross Flag of the Red Cross On 9 August 2007, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Johnson & Johnson (J&J;) filed suit against the American Red Cross alleging trademark infringement. The suit sought to halt the placement of the Red Cross emblem on all first aid, safety and disaster preparedness products not specifically licensed by Johnson & Johnson. The suit also asked for the destruction of all currently existing non-J&J; Red Cross emblem-bearing products of this type, and demanded the American Red Cross pay punitive damages and J&J;'s legal fees. J&J; released a statement to the public on 8 August 2007, detailing its decision to file suit,\\"Johnson & Johnson Statement on Civil Complaint Against The American National Red Cross and Commercial Licenses\\" Business Wire 8 August 2007 claiming prior rights to the emblem. On the same date, the American Red Cross issued a press release of its own,\\"J&J; (NYSE: JNJ) Sues Red Cross Over Use of Red Cross Emblem\\" , The American National Red Cross, 8 August 2007 stating some of the reasons behind its decision to license the Red Cross emblem to first aid and disaster preparedness product manufacturers. It issued a further press release two days later,\\"American Red Cross Defends Use of Emblem and Mission\\" , The American National Red Cross, 10 August 2007 disputing several of J&J;'s claims and asserting that \\"(t)he Red Cross has been selling first aid kits commercially in the United States since 1903.\\" In a statement, the American Red Cross said it had worked since 2004 with several licensing partners to create first aid, preparedness and related products that bear the Red Cross emblem. The charity said that all money it received from the sale of these products to consumers was reinvested in its humanitarian programs and services. \\"For a multi-billion dollar drug company to claim that the Red Cross violated a criminal statute that was created to protect the humanitarian mission of the Red Cross--simply so that J&J; can make more money--is obscene,\\" said Mark Everson, the chief executive of the charity. Johnson & Johnson responded, stating that the American Red Cross's commercial ventures were outside the scope of historically well-agreed usage, and were in direct violation of federal statutes. The federal court rejected Johnson & Johnson's position and ruled for the American Red Cross, holding that federal law authorizes the American Red Cross to use the Red Cross emblem in the sale of mission-related items like first aid and disaster preparedness kits and to license other firms to use its name and emblem to sell such products. The court noted in particular that the American Red Cross had been doing so for over a century, and that Johnson & Johnson had once itself sought to be a licensee of the American Red Cross. After the court rejected the substance of Johnson & Johnson's complaint, the parties ultimately settled their differences, and the American Red Cross remains free to use its emblem commercially.Claim Over Red Cross Symbol Is Settled, The New York Times, June 18, 2008.

Set in woodlands, it was founded in 1398 by Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey, the son of King Richard II's half-brother Thomas, Earl of Kent. It was the last monastery established in Yorkshire, and one of the few founded anywhere in Britain in the period between the Black Death (1349‚Äì50) and the Reformation. It was a fairly small establishment, with space for a prior and twenty-three monks. Mount Grace Priory consisted of a church and two cloisters. The Great Cloister, to the north of the church, had seventeen cells for monks whilst the southern Lesser Cloister had six cells for the lay brothers. Upon the abdication of King Richard II, Holland and others of the king's supporters attempted to assassinate his recently crowned successor, Henry IV, at New Year, 1400, but were captured and executed. Holland's body was eventually recovered and, in 1412, re-buried in the charterhouse that he had founded. The orphaned priory of Mount Grace, bereft of its founder and the income that had been granted to it by Holland and King Richard, depended upon royal largesse for its income for more than a decade. Coat of arms of Mount Grace priory Carthusian Priory On its founding, Thomas Holland ordered that the monks were to pray for the king, queen and several members of the royal family, and for himself and his heirs, and many others including John and Eleanor Ingelby. The prior of the Grande Chartreuse allowed him to nominate Robert Tredwye as the first rector (although the charter refers to him as the first prior) and to dedicate the priory to \\"the Blessed Virgin and Saint Nicholas\\". The second part of the dedication lapsed and the priory became known as the House of the Assumption of the most Blessed Virgin in Mount Grace. Nicholas Love, prior of Mount Grace, succeeded in creating a link between the priory and the Lancastrian administration, in part by submitting his \\"Mirror of the Blessed Life of Jesus Christ\\" to Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, Henry IV's chancellor, in support of the archbishop's campaign against Wycliffism, and by granting Arundel confraternity in the spiritual benefits of Mount Grace in exchange for his provision of material benefits. In 1410 the house was formally incorporated into the order, and Love named as fourth rector and first prior. (But note the disparity with the original charter.) The priory from the south-west The house received a number of grants and charters: *In March 1399 Richard II granted the monks a charter of liberties and franchises in general terms, including the right to mine lead. *In May 1399, at the request of the Duke of Surrey, he gave them the alien priories of Hinckley in Leicestershire, Carisbrooke in the Isle of Wight, and Wareham in Dorset. They were also given, for as long as England and France were at war, lands belonging to the alien priory of Saint Mary of Lire, at Evreux, in Normandy. *When Wareham Priory was lost, soon after Henry's accession, the king granted the monks ¬£100 a year from the Exchequer until they were able to get lands of equivalent value (¬£1,000) and a barrel of the 'better red wine of Gascony' to be received at Hull every Martinmas. *In 1412 Henry V confirmed the gift of Hinckley to support five monks, to pray for himself and Thomas Beaufort, Earl of Dorset. *In 1421 he gave the monks four further alien priories, Long Bennington, Minting and Hagh (Hough-on-the-Hill) in Lincolnshire, and Field Dalling in Norfolk, which redeemed the yearly grant of ¬£100. In 1439 the Priory asked parliament to confirm their title ‚Äì the number of claimants to the estate meant that they dared not continue to build ‚Äì and Henry VI did so in 1440. Following this, the gifts and income continued: *In 1456 Sir James and Lady Elizabeth Strangways of Harlsey Castle granted the priory the advowson of the church of Beighton, in Derbyshire. *In 1462 the king granted the manor of Atherstone, Warwickshire (part of the alien priory of Great Ogbourne in Wiltshire), for the relief of the poor. *In 1471 the king granted the Yorkshire manor of the alien priory of Begare in return for three daily masses being said for the king and the souls of his family (a practice known as frankalmoign) but in 1472 it was re-granted to Eton College, who had been previous holders of a grant. *In 1508 the Prior of Mount Grace leased the chapel of East Harlsey and manor of Bordelby to the Prior of Guisborough for fifty years of at a yearly rent of ¬£8. *In 1522, in the will of Sir Thomas Strangways, a Lady Chapel at Mount Grace is mentioned and directions given for the priest who sang masses there. Writings Mount Grace became an important locus for the production and preservation of contemplative and devotional texts: among writers professed as monks there were John Norton and Richard Methley (the latter known for his Latin translations of The Cloud of Unknowing and of the anonymous English translation of Marguerite Porete's Mirror of Simple Souls). The only surviving manuscript of The Book of Margery Kempe also belonged to Mount Grace Charterhouse. Dissolution The priory was closed in 1539 during the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII. Some of the monks had (in 1534) attempted to avoid taking the oath of supremacy but, after they were imprisoned, the last prior, John Wilson, handed the keys over to Henry VIII's representatives. The site then passed into private ownership. Mount Grace was valued at ¬£382 5s. 11¬Ωd. gross (¬£323 2s. 10¬Ωd. net) which included ¬£104 6s. 8d. from spiritualities in Lincolnshire, ¬£164 from lands outside Yorkshire and the rest from its home county of Yorkshire. In December 1539 the brothers were awarded pensions totalling ¬£195 ‚Äì ¬£60 plus the house and chapel called the Mount for the prior, ¬£7 for each of eight priests and small sums for eighteen. The dissolution of Mount Grace, and life in the priory in the preceding years, is vividly reimagined by Lucy Beckett in her 1986 novel The Time Before You Die. Daily life Unlike monks of other orders, who live in common, the Carthusians‚Äîto this day‚Äîlive as hermits, each occupying his own cell (more like a small house), and coming together only for the nocturnal liturgical hours, and on Sundays and feast-days, in the church; the other hours are sung by each monk separately in his cell. Except for the singing of the liturgy and conversation \\"on grave subjects\\" during a weekly three-hour exercise walk, Carthusians are silent, and their diet is strictly vegetarian. The monks at Mount Grace were very conscious of hygiene and sanitation; included in the reconstructed cell is a reconstructed latrine and visitors are able to investigate the ditches used as sewage systems. Post Dissolution After the dissolution, the ruins of the guest-house of the priory were incorporated into two later houses: a seventeenth-century manor‚Äîa rare building of the Commonwealth period‚Äî built by Thomas Lascelles and the larger house of 1900‚Äì01, an important example of the Arts and Crafts movement. The Manor House at the priory was decorated in Arts and Crafts style under the ownership of the ironmaster Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell. Present day The property is owned by the National Trust and under the care of English Heritage. Visitors today can see the layout of the whole monastery, including one reconstructed monk's cell, together with the typically small Carthusian church and the later house. There is also a museum on the site detailing the history of the priory. English Heritage lets the Prior's Lodge as a holiday cottage. Priors and rectors of Mount Grace The Houses of Carthusian monks: Priory of Mount Grace lists a number of the priors of the house, together with the years they are known to have held office. It might not be correct, as the first two entries could be rectors not priors; nor is it complete as (for example) Carthusian records show Nicholas Love or Luff to be the first prior and fourth rector. The list is: # Robert Tredwye or Tredewy, 1398 # Edmund, occurs 1399 # Nicholas Luff, occurs 1413, 1415, 1416 (Period of office ends in 1417 according to other sources.) # Robert Layton, occurs 1421 # Thomas Lockington ‚Äì Prior from 1421 to 1447 (given in \\"The typescript List of Obiits of the Carthusians of the English Houses\\") (\\"The Houses of Carthusian Monks...\\" shows \\"Thomas, occurs 1428\\" and \\"Thomas Lockington, occurs 1436, 1437, 1439\\" as separate entries.) # Robert, occurs 1449, 1454 # Robert Leke, occurs 1469, 1473 # Thomas, occurs 1475, 1476 # Thomas, occurs 1497 # Henry Eccleston, occurs 1501, 1506 # John, occurs 1527-8, 1531‚Äì2 # William (?)

Trivium was submitted to the Profile II (hardware) of the eSTREAM competition by its authors, Christophe De Canni√®re and Bart Preneel, and has been selected as part of the portfolio for low area hardware ciphers (Profile 2) by the eSTREAM project. It is not patented and has been specified as an International Standard under ISO/IEC 29192-3.ISO/IEC 29192-3:2012 It generates up to 264 bits of output from an 80-bit key and an 80-bit IV. It is the simplest eSTREAM entrant; while it shows remarkable resistance to cryptanalysis for its simplicity and performance, recent attacks leave the security margin looking rather slim. Description Trivium's 288-bit internal state consists of three shift registers of different lengths. At each round, a bit is shifted into each of the three shift registers using a non-linear combination of taps from that and one other register; one bit of output is produced. To initialize the cipher, the key and IV are written into two of the shift registers, with the remaining bits starting in a fixed pattern; the cipher state is then updated 4 √ó 288 = 1152 times, so that every bit of the internal state depends on every bit of the key and of the IV in a complex nonlinear way. No taps appear on the first 65 bits of each shift register, so each novel state bit is not used until at least 65 rounds after it is generated. This is the key to Trivium's software performance and flexibility in hardware. Specification Trivium may be specified very concisely using three recursive equations.eSTREAM Phorum, 2006-02-20 Each variable is an element of GF(2); they can be represented as bits, with \\"+\\" being XOR and \\"‚Ä¢\\" being AND. *ai = ci‚àí66 \\\\+ ci‚àí111 \\\\+ ci‚àí110 ‚Ä¢ ci‚àí109 \\\\+ ai‚àí69 *bi = ai‚àí66 \\\\+ ai‚àí93 \\\\+ ai‚àí92 ‚Ä¢ ai‚àí91 \\\\+ bi‚àí78 *ci = bi‚àí69 \\\\+ bi‚àí84 \\\\+ bi‚àí83 ‚Ä¢ bi‚àí82 \\\\+ ci‚àí87 The output bits r0 ... r264‚àí1 are then generated by *ri = ci‚àí66 \\\\+ ci‚àí111 \\\\+ ai‚àí66 \\\\+ ai‚àí93 \\\\+ bi‚àí69 \\\\+ bi‚àí84 Given an 80-bit key k0 ... k79 and an l-bit IV v0 ... vl‚àí1 (where 0 ‚â§ l ‚â§ 80), Trivium is initialized as follows: *(a‚àí1245 ... a‚àí1153) = (0, 0 ... 0, k0 ... k79) *(b‚àí1236 ... b‚àí1153) = (0, 0 ... 0, v0 ... vl‚àí1) *(c‚àí1263 ... c‚àí1153) = (1, 1, 1, 0, 0 ... 0) The large negative indices on the initial values reflect the 1152 steps that must take place before output is produced. To map a stream of bits r to a stream of bytes R, we use the little-endian mapping Ri = Œ£j=0 ... 7 2j r8i+j. Performance A straightforward hardware implementation of Trivium would use 3488 logic gates and produce one bit per clock cycle. However, because each state bit is not used for at least 64 rounds, 64 state bits can be generated in parallel at a slightly greater hardware cost of 5504 gates. Different tradeoffs between speed and area are also possible. The same property allows an efficient bitslice implementation in software; performance testing by eSTREAM give bulk encryption speeds of around 4 cycles/byte on some x86 platforms, which compares well to the 19 cycles/byte of the AES reference implementation on the same platform. Security , no cryptanalytic attacks better than brute-force attack are known, but several attacks come close. The cube attack requires 268 steps to break a variant of Trivium where the number of initialization rounds is reduced to 799. Previously other authors speculate that these techniques could lead to a break for 1100 initialisation rounds, or \\"maybe even the original cipher\\". This builds on an attack due to Michael Vielhaber that breaks 576 initialization rounds in only 212.3 steps. Another attack recovers the internal state (and thus the key) of the full cipher in around 289.5 steps (where each step is roughly the cost of a single trial in exhaustive search). (Table 6, page 11) Reduced variants of Trivium using the same design principles have been broken using an equation-solving technique. These attacks improve on the well-known time-space tradeoff attack on stream ciphers, which with Trivium's 288-bit internal state would take 2144 steps, and show that a variant on Trivium which made no change except to increase the key length beyond the 80 bits mandated by eSTREAM Profile 2 would not be secure. Using optimised solving strategy, it is further possible to reduce the state-recovery complexity to 2132 steps. A detailed justification of the design of Trivium is given in.

The site is sparsely developed, lacking any buildings or restroom facilities. History The North Branch Potomac River emerging from under the Fairfax Stone The exact boundaries of the \\"Northern Neck Land Grant\\" (later called the \\"Fairfax Grant\\") had been undetermined since it was first contrived in 1649 by the then-exiled King Charles II. John Savage and his survey party had located the site of the source of the North Branch of the Potomac River (the northern boundary of the tract) in 1736, but had made no attempt to establish the western boundaries.Wayland, John (1925), \\"\\"Special Note\\", In: The Fairfax Line: Thomas Lewis's Journal of 1746; Footnotes and index by John Wayland, Newmarket, Virginia: The Henkel Press (1925 publication), pp 86-88. A 1746 survey by Colonel Peter Jefferson (Thomas Jefferson's father) and Thomas Lewis resulted in both the placement of the Fairfax Stone as well as the establishment of a line of demarcation known as the \\"Fairfax Line\\", extending from the Stone to the south-east and ending at the source of the Rappahannock River,Otis K. Rice and Stephen W. Brown (1993), West Virginia: A History, Second edition; Lexington, Kentucky: The University Press of Kentucky, pg 16. a distance of . The North Branch of the Potomac River initially heads west from its source at the Fairfax Stone before curving north and then generally flowing east toward Chesapeake Bay. For this reason, the Stone is only a county corner of West Virginia counties rather than part of the state's border with Maryland, an issue that was only resolved when the Supreme Court ruled against Maryland in 1910 in Maryland v. West Virginia, determining that Maryland would only go westward up the Potomac far enough to meet a point where a line north from the Fairfax Stone would cross that branch of the Potomac. Until the ruling, the boundary of Maryland was indeterminate. Three West Virginia counties--Grant, Preston and Tucker-- share the boundary marked by the Fairfax Stone (West Virginia having seceded from Virginia during the American Civil War). Fate of the original stone The Fairfax Stone in 1881. The original Fairfax Stone, in accordance with common surveying practices of the era, was most likely simply a natural, unmarked rock selected from among the outcroppings in the area. Legal boundary disputes between Maryland and Virginia caused the latter to relocate the stone in 1833 after the site had been lost to memory.Wayland (1925), Op. cit., pg 88. The stone was still intact in 1859 when one Lieutenant Melcher found it again and reran the \\"Fairfax Line\\" on behalf of the two states. The Stone was gone by 1909, however, having been carried away by vandals. There have been six Fairfax Stones, each one replacing the last owing to weathering or vandalism. The current stone is a six-ton rock with a flat face, on which is inlaid a historical plaque detailing the stone's significance. Next to it is the 1910 stone. The present six-ton Fairfax Stone was dedicated on October 5, 1957.Conley, Phil and Boyd B.

Boothroyd, The History of British Political Parties, Politico's Publishing: 2001, p. 15 As such the party advocated reduced spending in government, at both local and national level. It was particularly critical of the retention of the high levels of income tax after the end of the war as well as the funding provided for the 'homes fit for heroes' scheme.Martin Pugh, Hurrah for the Blackshirts: Fascists and Fascism in Britain Between the Wars, Pimlico 2006, p. 76 Electoral performance The party stood in a number of by-elections, taking an increasingly anti-communist line. James Malcolm Monteith Erskine was elected as a joint nominee with an unofficial Conservative Association in the 1921 Westminster St George's by-election, and Murray Sueter was elected in a joint candidacy with the Independent Parliamentary Group in the 1921 Hertford by-election. Rothermere's son Esmond Harmsworth became the leader of the party's Westminster grouping, which co- operated closely with the Independent Parliamentary Group of Horatio Bottomley. Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook was also a leading patron of the group. Dissolution In reaction to the growth of the League, the Conservatives launched a Committee for National Expenditure, led by Eric Geddes, with the aim of cutting spending, and eventually acted on many of its recommendations. As their support dipped in the face of the Conservatives co- opting their ideas the League changed its focus to sponsoring independent candidates and even those from other parties who shared their aims. Following the 1922 general election the League disbanded with most of its members returning to the Conservative Party.

It covers and lies on the northwest boundary of Dallas Love Field in the airport's landing path and the western boundary of the upscale Bluffview neighborhood. At the Western end of the lake, DART provides transit service at Bachman Station, including light rail service via the Green Line and Orange Line.  History & Development  Bachman Lake was originally constructed in 1903 by damming Bachman Branch as a water source for Dallas, but it proved to be too small for the city's needs which led to the construction of White Rock Lake in 1911. Today, Dallas Water Utilities operates the Bachman Water Treatment Plant (WTP), which is the city's oldest operating water treatment plant still in operation. The area surrounding the lake is currently a hot bed of new construction. The Shops at Bluffview brought of upscale apartment, retail, restaurant and office development to the area in 2008. In 2019, Trinisc Residential completed the Aura at Bluffview, a 473-unit Class A apartment community on the lake's northeastern trailhead.  Recreation  Today, Bachman Lake is used as a recreational area that includes the Bachman Recreation Center, several picnic areas, and a playground. A 3.3-mile (5.3 km) paved trail for pedestrians and cyclists surrounds the lake with fitness stations, benches, water fountains, restrooms, and picnic areas at several locations. Bachman Lake also serves as the home of the Dallas Rowing Club and supports sailing and rowing with a marina and boathouse.

Frankweiler is a novel by E. L. Konigsburg. The book follows siblings Claudia and Jamie Kincaid as they run away from home to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It was published by Atheneum in 1967, the second book published from two manuscripts the new writer had submitted to editor Jean E. Karl. Mixed-Up Files won the annual Newbery Medal for excellence in American children's literature in 1968. Summary The prologue is a letter from Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, addressed \\"To my lawyer, Saxonberg\\", accompanied by a drawing of her writing at her office desk. It serves as the cover letter for the 162-page narrative, and provides background for changes to her last will and testament. Twelve-year- old Claudia Kincaid decides to run away from her home in Greenwich, because she thinks her parents do not appreciate her. She takes refuge in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met) in New York City, with her brother Jamie. She chooses Jamie as her companion partly because he has saved all his money. With the help of an unused adult train fare card that she found in a wastebasket, Claudia finds a way to get to the museum for free using the commuter train and a very long walk. Early chapters depict Claudia and Jamie settling in at the Met: hiding in the restroom at closing time, as security staff check to see that all the patrons have departed; blending in with school groups on tour; bathing in the fountain, and using \\"wishing coins\\" for money; and sleeping in Irwin Untermyer's antique bed. A new exhibit draws sensational crowds and fascinates the children: the marble statue of an angel, the sculptor unknown but suspected to be Michelangelo. It was purchased at auction, for only a few hundred dollars, from Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, a collector who recently closed her showcase Manhattan residence. The children research it on site and at the Donnell Library, and give their conclusion to the museum staff anonymously. After learning they have been naive, the children spend the last of their money on travel to Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler's home in Connecticut. She recognizes them as runaways but sets them briefly to the task of researching the angel from files in her long bank of cabinets. Despite the idiosyncratic organization of her files, they do discover the angel's secret--Mrs. Frankweiler has purposefully \\"given away\\" a virtually priceless Michelangelo to the Met. In exchange for a full account of their adventure, she will leave the crucial file to them in her will, and send them home in her Rolls-Royce. Claudia learns her deep motive for persisting in the crazy search: she wanted a secret of her own to treasure and keep. Mrs. Frankweiler may get \\"grandchildren\\" who delight her. Her lawyer gets a luncheon date at the Met, to revise her will.  Characters  The Kincaids live in Greenwich, Connecticut. Mrs. Frankweiler lives on a \\"country estate\\" in Farmington, Connecticut, closer to Hartford. * Claudia Kincaid, 12, is the oldest of four children and the only girl, so she both sets the table and empties the dishwasher.

He served in the Seminole War, the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the Yuma War and the Cortina Troubles. During the American Civil War he was a prominent figure in the early months of the war rising to the command of a corps. The World War II Liberty ship SS Samuel Heintzelman, launched on 30 September 1942, was named in his honor. Early life and military service Heintzelman was born in Manheim, Pennsylvania, to Peter and Ann Elizabeth Grubb Heintzelman. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1826 and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Infantry, July 1, 1826, then in the 2nd U.S. Infantry and served on the Northern frontier at Fort Gratiot, Fort Mackinac, and Fort Brady. On March 4, 1833, he was promoted to first lieutenant and served on quartermaster's duty in Florida during the Second Seminole War. On July 7, 1838, he was appointed captain in the Quartermaster's Department, remaining in Florida with the 2nd Infantry until the close of the war in 1842. In 1847, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he joined General Winfield Scott's army in Mexico, taking part in several engagements, for which he was appointed brevet major on October 9, 1847. In 1848‚Äì49 he accompanied his regiment around Cape Horn to California, and for several years served in California and the Arizona Territory. In December 1851, Major Heintzelman led the Yuma Expedition from the post of San Diego to put down the Yuma uprising, called the Yuma War. His expedition established Fort Yuma and peace was made in October, 1852. He received the brevet of lieutenant colonel for his conduct in the campaign against the Yuma Indians and on March 3, 1855, he was promoted to major of the 1st U.S. Infantry and served with that regiment on the Texas frontier.Robinson, p. 4. In 1859, during the First Cortina War in Texas, he was largely responsible for the defeat of Juan Cortina's forces. Heintzelman was the first president of the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company which established the Cerro Colorado, Arizona, mining town in southern Arizona. The town became famous during the American Civil War for the massacre of mine employees by Mexican outlaws and for buried treasure. Civil War When the Civil War began, Heintzelman was promoted to colonel of the 17th U.S. Infantry and brigadier general of volunteers in May 1861. He led a division at First Bull Run in July and was wounded in the elbow. Heintzelman was in overall command of the 2nd Michigan Infantry regiment that was responsible for the raid, ransacking, and devastation of Pohick Church in Lorton, Virginia, on November 12, 1861. The historic church was built in 1769 by George Washington, George Mason, and George William Fairfax, among others, and restored after the War of 1812 by President Martin Van Buren, John Quincy Adams, and Francis Scott Key, among others. This ransacking caused the loss of a myriad of irreplaceable artifacts.Pohick Church history In March 1862, President Lincoln organized the Army of the Potomac into corps, and Heintzelman received the III Corps of the Army of the Potomac in the Peninsula Campaign. His corps played a prominent role in the siege of Yorktown where Heintzelman and division commander Fitz John Porter were among the first to use the Union Army Balloon Corps. The corps bore the brunt of the fighting at Williamsburg and saw significant action at Fair Oaks, Oak Grove, and Glendale. His corps was temporarily attached to the Army of Virginia and took part in the Second Battle of Bull Run. He was commissioned as a brevet brigadier general in the regular army for the battle of Fair Oaks and a major general of volunteers for the battle of Williamsburg. At the Battle of Glendale, Heintzelman was bruised in the wrist by a spent bullet and was unable to use his left arm for a few weeks. After the Seven Days Battles, he was promoted to major general of volunteers to rank from May 5. His popularity and confidence in the army were eclipsed by the aggressive nature of his subordinate division commanders Joseph Hooker and Philip Kearny, and he did not display any notable leadership or tactical prowess in either the Peninsula Campaign or Second Bull Run, although following the Union retreat from Gaines Mill, he was one of three corps commanders to advocate launching a counterattack against the Army of Northern Virginia.Heintzelman's obituary by John C. Robinson The Second Bull Run campaign had been very hard on the III Corps, which sustained heavy losses, including one of its division commanders, and had come close to being driven from the field in panic. On September 4, Heintzelman was relieved from command, being judged as too old and insufficiently aggressive. He spent the remainder of the war commanding the Washington defenses. At war's end in 1865, Heintzelman reverted to the rank of colonel in the regular army. He served on army boards of inquiry and on occupation duty in Texas as part of Reconstruction. Heintzelman retired on February 22, 1869 and was granted a promotion to major general, entitling him to the pension of that rank. He died in Washington, D.C., on May 1, 1880, at the age of 74. He is buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo, New York. According to his doctor, he died of complications arising from an attack of pleurisy during the Peninsula Campaign eighteen years earlier.Roll of Honor, The Buffalo Commercial, (Buffalo, New York) May 31, 1900, page 8, accessed May 19, 2017 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11102133/roll_of_honot_the_buffalo_commercial/ His grandson Stuart Heintzelman, a West Point alumnus of the class of 1899, served in World War I and rose to the rank of Major General.

In July 2009 Mackay was convicted of fraudulently claiming money from the club as commission for brokering a loan, and was sentenced to three years in prison. Personal life Mackay's family came from an island in the Outer Hebrides, although by the time he was six years old they had moved to the Partick area of Glasgow. He grew up with a keen interest in football, particularly Rangers F.C. whom he supported. Career As well as serving in the Royal Navy for a time, Mackay became directly involved in football, playing in the Highland Football League, gaining coaching qualifications and then working as a players' agent. In this capacity, Mackay represented the majority of the Rangers first team squad during the 1990s. Despite being a FIFA-registered agent for what he himself described as \\"11 unblemished years\\", Mackay's business ventures met with mixed fortunes. He has been a director of five companies that have been struck off the Companies House register, mostly for failure to file accounts or an annual return. From 1993 to 1996, Mackay was made personally bankrupt after the failure of his recruitment agency, MMK Associates, when 19 creditors, ranging from Inland Revenue to a furniture loan company, were left owed ¬£157,659. In 2001, he launched Inside Soccer Recruitment, an innovative player recruitment agency, only for it to be liquidated 16 months later, owing a large tax bill and leaving creditors, including former footballer Terry Butcher, unpaid. Mackay commented, \\"Inside Soccer was a great idea which didn't work. These things happen and I lost more money than anyone\\". Mackay also worked for a time in 2007 as a consultant to Stirling-based sports management company 110Sport. Derby County In October 2003 Mackay became involved in a takeover over of financially troubled Football League First Division club Derby County. A group of investors who wished to remain anonymous had purchased the club following it being placed into temporary receivership by the Co-operative Bank, and had installed barrister John Sleightholme as chairman. Sleightholme was a friend of Mackay's, the two being the only directors of a company called Finance for Football, which had been launched in 2002. Mackay's role at Derby was initially unspecified, although it was thought that he helped with attracting investment. He was subsequently appointed to the director of football role, and with his contacts in international football was instrumental in recruiting players such as Grzegorz Rasiak and I√±igo Idiakez for the club. Mackay, however, reportedly had a poor relationship with George Burley, the manager who led Derby to a play-off place in 2004-05, with rumours of disagreements and meddling in team affairs by Mackay. Burley subsequently resigned from his post in June 2005 stating his position had become \\"untenable\\". Mackay offered his resignation from the board in the wake of Burley's departure but was persuaded to stay after talks. The following season, Mackay had a public dispute with Derby County's chief executive, Jeremy Keith, over the sale of Rasiak to Tottenham Hotspur, for which he was reprimanded by Sleightholme. Following further disagreements with Keith and other board members, Mackay tendered his verbal resignation in December 2005. In a subsequent vote, the Derby directors voted four to one in favour of Mackay leaving, with his only supporter being friend and club chairman Sleightholme. However, Mackay made a U-turn and clung on to his post by claiming no written resignation was ever given to the board. Mackay eventually left his post at Derby County on 22 March 2006, claiming he could leave with his head held high. Fraud conviction Mackay was charged on 12 November 2007 with conspiracy to defraud and conceal criminal property after police investigations at Derby County. Former chief executive Jeremy Keith and finance director Andrew Mackenzie were charged with similar offences. Murdo appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court in Derby on 27 November 2007. Charges were read out, no pleas were entered and the case was adjourned. The trial started at Northampton Crown Court on 2 March 2009. Prior to the court case, Mackay left Scotland to live in Alicante, Spain. Quote from BBC News \\"Two former directors of Derby County football club have been found guilty of fraudulently claiming thousands of pounds in \\"commission\\". Andrew Mackenzie and Murdo Mackay claimed cash totalling ¬£440,625 after brokering a loan for the club. Former finance director Mackenzie, 55, and ex-director of football Mackay, 53, used a ¬£15m loan as a \\"carrot\\".\\" On 20 July 2009, Mackay and Mackenzie were both sentenced to 3 years in prison by Judge Alexander at Northampton Crown Court.

John Wesley preached a sermon \\"On the death of the Rev Mr George Whitefield\\" both here and at Whitefield's Tabernacle, Tottenham Court Road in 1770. The church was rebuilt in stone over a century later in 1868, to a robust Gothic design by C. G. Searle & Son. Immediately west of the church itself (in Leonard Street) a Sunday School was built.

His date and place of birth are uncertain - sources differ on whether he was born in Portugal in 1673‚Äì1674, or less likely in Amsterdam c. 1682. His mother was a Christian but his father was a Jew who moved with his family from Portugal to the Low Countries. During the Grand Embassy of Peter the Great to Europe (1697), the tsar was allowed by the Dutch sailors to command a ship, where Vieira served as a cabin-boy. He was taken by the tsar to Russia in the capacity of his page and orderly, gradually rising to the rank of adjutant- general in 1718. That same year, he fell in love with Prince Menshikov's sister and seduced her. They were apprehended by her brother, who ordered Vieira to be beaten to death. The latter, however, appealed to the tsar for mercy, and Peter ordered Vieira to be liberated and married to Menshikov's sister the very next day. A month later, he was appointed the first chief of St Petersburg Police. During his term in office, Vieira gained renown for his strict attitude towards brigands and outlaws who had previously crowded to the newly built Russian capital. Map of Okhotsk, ink drawing, 1737. After Peter's death, Vieira managed to maintain his position, chiefly through the influence of his wife, a lady-in-waiting at the court of Catherine I. On October 24, 1726, he was made count and admitted to the Senate. His brother-in-law's influence on the Empress, however, was paramount. As Vieira dared to oppose Menshikov's plan of marrying his daughter to the future Peter II of Russia, he was arrested and put to the torture. After 10 days of inquest, Vieira was stripped of his estates and titles and exiled to Yakutia, where he would live in utter oblivion for four years. In 1731, when Vitus Bering was commissioned to set a separate government for Okhotsk, he could not find anywhere in the Far East a more capable and experienced man than Vieira. The latter was summoned to Okhotsk and appointed its governor in 1739. During his term in office, he established a shipyard and a nautical school, which would continue for a century. Upon Elizaveta Petrovna's ascension to the throne in 1741, she was told that the associate of her father was still living on the shores of the Pacific. The old man was recalled to St Petersburg and reinstated as its police chief. Having been restituted in his comital title and invested with the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky, Vieira died in 1745.

It is directed by Thomas Carter, and produced by Roger Birnbaum. The plot follows Scott Roper (Murphy), a hostage negotiator and inspector for the San Francisco Police Department who seeks revenge against a psychotic jewel thief, Michael Korda (Wincott), who murdered Roper's best friend, Lt. Sam Baffert (Evans). Released on January 17, 1997 in the United States, Metro grossed $32,000,301 in the domestic market, which failed to bring back its $55,000,000 budget. Plot SFPD Inspector Scott Roper (Eddie Murphy) is the best hostage negotiator in his department. He is called in to deal with a bank robber, Earl (Donal Logue), demanding a getaway vehicle and police escort. He manages to defuse the situation, shooting Earl non-fatally in the shoulder and rescuing his 17 hostages. That night, Scott accompanies his friend and former partner Sam Baffert (Art Evans) to the apartment of Michael Korda (Michael Wincott), a jewel thief involved in Baffert's investigation. When Sam questions Korda about his involvement, Korda stabs him to death and leaves his corpse inside an elevator for Scott to find. Despite demanding to go after Korda, Captain Frank Solis (Denis Arndt) refuses to let him take the case due to the probable conflict-of-interest. Scott resolves to bring Korda to justice, but in the meanwhile must adjust to his new partner, SWAT sharpshooter Kevin McCall (Michael Rapaport). Scott and Kevin are called to a hostage situation at a downtown jewelry store, with Korda as the hostage taker. When Scott and Korda see each other, the latter grabs a hostage and makes a getaway in a truck. Scott and Kevin use Solis' car to pursue him. Korda wrecks the truck, and boards a cable car, shooting the operator. Scott and Kevin manage to stop the cable car and chase Korda into a parking garage, where they apprehend him. During visitation at the jail with his cousin Clarence Teal (Paul Ben-Victor), Korda orders Teal to kill Ronnie (Carmen Ejogo), Scott's girlfriend, as a way to seek revenge on Scott. Teal attacks Ronnie at her apartment, but Scott intervenes and chases Teal down the fire escape, where the latter is struck and killed by a passing car. An angry Scott visits Korda in jail and warns him to stay away from Ronnie, showing him an autopsy picture of Teal, which enrages Korda. The next morning, Korda escapes from the jail and kidnaps Ronnie, leading Scott and Kevin into a confrontation at an abandoned shipyard. Korda threatens to kill Ronnie by decapitating her on the cutting machine she is pinned to if Scott doesn't follow his instructions. Korda charges toward Scott in a sports car, but is shot from a vantage point by Kevin, causing him to swerve and crash through the warehouse entrance. Scott frees Ronnie, while Kevin engages Korda in a shootout where the former is shot in the abdomen. Korda tries to escape in Scott's truck, but Scott fights for control of it and leaps out of the way as Korda rams into a stack of explosive barrels and is killed in a massive explosion. The movie ends with Scott and Ronnie relaxing on vacation at a Tahitian beach resort. Cast *Eddie Murphy as Insp.

It has 15% on Rotten Tomatoes, despite Roger Ebert giving the film a favorable review; he said \\"[t]he big action scenes are cleverly staged and Eddie Murphy is back on his game again, with a high-energy performance and crisp dialogue.\\" A negative review came from Stephen Holden of The New York Times, who called the film \\"aimless\\" and stated that \\"[t]he vehicular pirouettes and ski jumps are so exaggerated that they correspond neither to the urban geography nor to the laws of physics. And the jiggling camera can't blur the careless mechanical stitching in a sequence that tries to make up for in length what it lacks in inventiveness. After all, when you've seen one spinning car, haven't you seen them all? And hasn't this demolition derby been staged several times before on the same streets with infinitely more pizazz and zest for destruction?\\" Michael Wilmington agreed, saying \\"If it weren't for all the jokes [...] the movie might be unintentionally funny,\\" and that \\"For most of the people who made \\"Metro,\\" shamelessness is probably a virtue, like good muscle tone. At the end, writer Feldman has actually dreamed up a variation on the old silent movie chestnut, where the mustache-twirling villain has the heroine tied to a sawmill plank. I'm not even sure this scene is intended humorously; the actors and director all milk it dry. And, except for Murphy's rapid-fire badinage, \\"Metro\\" has the kind of writing that suggests a mind filled with heroines tied to sawmill planks.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. =Box office= The movie debuted with $9.3 million.

The facility generates power by utilizing four turbines and each, totalling the installed capacity to . Total cost of US$4 billion. An additional cost of more than US$400 million was spent in repairing the damage caused during UNITA's occupation of the area at the time of the Angolan Civil War in 1992 and 1999.Capanda Dam  The design  The principal structures include: * concrete gravity dam, which includes: full section of the spillway dam, spillway bottom hydroelectric power plant, * comprising: GES, four tunnel conduit, * power house open switchgear (ORU 220 kW) * administrative building  Economic significance  As of 2013 Capanda HPP generates more than half of all electricity in Angola and is the largest hydroelectric complex in the country  The history of construction  On September 2, 1982 Angola signed an intergovernmental Soviet-Angolan agreement for the framework contract, for the construction of a hydropower dam. The Ministry of Energy and Petroleum of Angola, formed a cabinet management group to manage construction for the Central Kwanza (GAMEK) contractor consortium of Capanda, which included the Soviet foreign trade association \\"Tekhnopromexport\\", and the Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht. The first draft and the first topographic surveys on the alignment of the dam, were made in 1965 by the Portuguese COBA company. This project involved the construction of an arch dam, based on two gravity abutments. This project was scrapped by Soviet specialists and construction costs were later significantly reduced. Project Capanda HPP 520 MW was completed in 1989. The successfully project passed inspection by the state experts from the organizations of USSR, Angola and Brazil. Construction began in January 1987. The Contract provided for the completion of the dam by the end of 1992. From April to October 1988, the construction of the tunnel excavation was completed. At the end of June 1989, the River Kwanzaa was blocked, and the water flowed into the tunnel. The filling of the reservoir was completed on September 1, 1992. Construction of the dam was conducted under the conditions of the ongoing Civil War in Angola. On November 4, 1992, the site was captured by a UNITA military squad. During this attack about 20 Angolans - mostly police guarding the construction site and three Russian specialists were killed. After the capture of the unfinished hydro-electric site, it stood without any preservation or conservation until 2000. In 1997, an attempt was made to resume construction. During the reconnaissance survey on the upstream side of the dam, traces of powerful explosions were found. The crane towers were found thrown into the river. After UNITA left the area, the construction site was bare except for the remaining concrete dam wall. All residential barracks were burned, and all the new contract builders/engineers had to live in army tents for a while. On February 12, 2000 work was resumed. In July 2002, work began to fill the reservoir. In January 2004 and June 2004, the first two turbines were brought online. Construction continued to the second stage, and in 2007, the third and fourth turbines were brought online. After UNITA left Capanda, all roads leading to the construction site were mined. Despite the fact that de-mining had been carried out, almost immediately after the resumption of construction, at least two large dump truck were destroyed by mines. Landmines were found on the construction site, and later, in places where the heavy rains had washed away soil. Mines in the area of Capanda are a hazard and are still being found today.

An assisted-opening knife is a type of folding knife which uses an internal mechanism to finish the opening of the blade once the user has partially opened it using a flipper or thumbstud attached to the blade.Winter, Butch (2004) King of the Assisted Openers, Blade Magazine, August 2004 When the knife is in the closed position, the blade is held in place by means of torsion springs and an additional blade lock (optional). As the user applies manual pressure to the thumbstud to open the knife, a mechanism such as a torsion spring moves along a track in the liner and rapidly rotates the blade into the open and locked position.

Legality Although commonly confused with switchblade knives, a switchblade can be opened automatically simply with the push of a button, but the user of an assisted- opening knife must open it about one-quarter of the way (45¬∞) before the mechanism opens the knife the rest of the way.Cascio, Pat (2007).Kershaw's Latest Tactical Folders, Knives Illustrated, February 2007 The difference is important legally; because the blade does not open simply \\"by the push of a button or by force of gravity\\" the assisted-opening knife is typically not considered a switchblade,Gardner,Jim (2004)Sweet Onions, Guns Magazine, June 2004 and may escape the restrictions applying to those in many places. In 2018, New York's highest court sustained a criminal conviction for possession of a switchblade against a defendant found in possession of an assisted- opening knife. Additionally, despite the explicit illegal classification of switchblade knives in the UK, assisted opening knives remain permissible to own. Trade names Trade names for assisted-opening knives are: Forward Action Spring Technology, A/O Knife, Torsion Assist Knife, Assisted Knife, Spring Assist Knife, Spring Assisted Knife, Quick Release, Quick Draw, Alternative Automatic, Outburst, SpeedSafe, Blade Launcher, S.A.T (SOG Assisted Technology), and the Semi-Auto. History The first assisted opening knife was designed by Blackie Collins in 1995 and was named the \\"Strut-and-Cut\\"; it was based on the strut of his Ducati motorcycle. A similar concept was developed three years later by knifemaker Ken Onion with Onion's idea based on a similar mechanism in his Harley Davidson motorcycle. Onion applied for a patent on his design in 1998.

For the last 15 km of its run it forms a border between eastern Serbia and western Bulgaria. It is a branchy system of many shorter rivers, many of them having the same name (Timok), only clarified with adjectives. From the farthest source in the system, that of the Svrlji≈°ki Timok, until its confluence (as Veliki Timok), the Timok is 202 km long. The area of the river basin is .Velika Morava River Basin, ICPDR, November 2009, p. 2 The Timok Valley is known for the most important Romanian- speaking population in Eastern Serbia.

The Beli Timok is formed by the confluence of the rivers Svrlji≈°ki Timok (\\"Svrljig Timok\\") and Trgovi≈°ki Timok (\\"Trgovi≈°te Timok\\") at Knja≈æevac. Tributaries of the Timok are Duboki Dol, Beslarica, Golami Dol, Kijevska, Braƒçevicka, Studena Voda, Pivnica and Eleshchev from the right, and Lipoviƒçka River, Crna reka, Jela≈°niƒçka reka, Sala≈°ka reka, Oga≈°u Taba, Brusniƒçki potok, Uroviƒçki potok, Plandi≈°te and Sikolska river from the left.  Course  The Timok turns north-west after its formation at Zajeƒçar, running next to the villages of Vra≈æogrnac, Trnavac, ƒåokonjar, and Brusnik. Passing between the last two it leaves the Timok Valley and enters the Negotin Valley. In the lower course the Timok has no major settlements on the Serbian side (though flowing only 7 km from Negotin). Some 15 km before it empties into the Danube as its right tributary, the Timok becomes a border river, passing next to the Bulgarian town of Bregovo and the Bulgarian village of Baley. The river's mouth represents the northernmost point of Bulgaria, and is only 28 m above sea level, which makes it the lowest point of Serbia. The average discharge is 24 m¬≥/s, but it can grow to 40 m¬≥/s, and the Timok is part of the Black Sea drainage basin. The main (right) tributaries in this section are Crna reka, Sala≈°ka reka, Sikolska reka and ƒåubarska reka (Cyrillic: –¶—Ä–Ω–∞ —Ä–µ–∫–∞, –°–∞–ª–∞—à–∫–∞ —Ä–µ–∫–∞, –°–∏–∫–æ–ª—Å–∫–∞ —Ä–µ–∫–∞ and –ß—É–±–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞ —Ä–µ–∫–∞). Apart from the Timok Valley, the Timok gave its name to a rebellion against Serbian king Milan Obrenoviƒá IV in 1883, Timoƒçka buna (\\"rebellion of Timok\\").  Economy and ecology  At ƒåokonjar, the Sokolovica power plant was constructed in 1947-1951. Opportunities for higher electricity production are not used. The river has been greatly ecologically damaged in recent years by the mining and heavy metal industry in Bor and Krivelj and is consequently polluting the Danube with lead, copper and cadmium.

It formed a semicircle through the inner suburbs of Rochester, following expressways west and east of the city and surface streets south of Rochester. The western terminus of the route was at an interchange with NY 104 west of the city limits in Greece. The eastern terminus was at an intersection with Culver Road in Irondequoit mere yards from Lake Ontario. In between its western and eastern extents, NY 47 met Interstate 490 (I-490) twice. The limited-access highway portions of the route were known as the Rochester Outer Loop (or Outer Loop) in contrast to the Inner Loop around downtown Rochester. NY 47 was originally routed along surface streets through the city when it was assigned . It began at NY 31 in Gates and followed Howard Road and Brooks Avenue southeast into Rochester, where it continued eastward on Genesee Park Boulevard and Elmwood Avenue. NY 47 remained on the latter through Brighton to an area known as Twelve Corners. At this point, the route turned north onto Winton Road and followed that street through the eastern fringe of the city to Irondequoit, where NY 47 ended at a junction with U.S. Route 104 (US 104, now NY 404). The Outer Loop was constructed in stages, beginning with the portion of the Sea Breeze Expressway north of Ridge Road in the early 1950s. From that point on, construction progressed in a generally clockwise fashion around the city. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Outer Loop was complete from NY 383 to US 104 west of the city and from modern I-590 exit 1 to the lakeshore east of Rochester. NY 47 followed the loop from US 104 south to NY 383 and from Elmwood Avenue north to modern NY 590 exit 8; north of that point, the expressway was part of US 104 and NY 18\\\\. NY 47 was extended northward along the remainder of the Sea Breeze Expressway in 1970. On March 18, 1980, the NY 47 designation was removed and replaced with several others, primarily I-390, I-590, NY 390, and NY 590\\\\. Route description Sign assembly on Elmwood Avenue at Winton Road. The empty upper portion was where signage for NY 47 was once mounted. NY 47 followed a half-circle routing around the city of Rochester, beginning northwest of downtown in the town of Greece and proceeding generally counterclockwise around the city before ending northeast of downtown at the Lake Ontario shoreline in Irondequoit. The limited-access highway portions of NY 47 were named the \\"Rochester Outer Loop\\" (or \\"Outer Loop\\") in contrast to the Inner Loop around downtown Rochester. This moniker remains in use to this day, now referring to the designations that have since replaced NY 47 along the loop. Conceptually, NY 104 completes the Outer Loop along the north side of the city. However, only the section east of the Genesee River is expressway, leaving NY 104 from modern NY 390 to the Veterans Memorial Bridge as the only at-grade portion of the loop. The at-grade portion of NY 47 along Scottsville Road and Elmwood Avenue was known as the \\"Rochester Bypass\\" prior to the completion of the Outer Loop. The alignment described within this section is of NY 47 upon its removal in 1980. =Western expressway= NY 47 began at an interchange with NY 104 (now the interchange between NY 390 and NY 104) in Greece one mile (1.6 km) west of the Rochester city limits. Although, at the time, the freeway terminated just north of the interchange, the interchange itself was roughly complete, with only ramps to and from future NY 390 north of the interchange missing. NY 47 followed the modern NY 390 alignment south to I-490, where NY 47 continued onto what is now I-390. The routings of NY 47 and current I-390 were identical to NY 383 (Scottsville Road) in Chili, where NY 47 was forced to grade level via a partially constructed interchange, as modern I-390 had yet to be constructed in the area southeast of NY 383. =At-grade= NY 47's final eastern terminus was at this intersection with Culver Road in Irondequoit (shown as it was in March 2008). This part of NY 47 became NY 590\\\\. Off the expressway and now at- grade, NY 47 turned north onto NY 383, forming a short concurrency with NY 383 into Rochester. At Elmwood Avenue, NY 47 and NY 383 departed Scottsville Road and proceeded eastward on Elmwood Avenue. Two blocks to the east, at an intersection with South Plymouth Avenue, NY 383 split from NY 47, following Plymouth Avenue into downtown Rochester. NY 47 remained routed on Elmwood Avenue, crossing the Genesee River and passing north of Strong Memorial Hospital prior to intersecting NY 15 (Mount Hope Avenue) in the shadow of Mount Hope Cemetery. East of NY 15, NY 47 progressed along Elmwood Avenue, intersecting several local streets before entering Brighton. Within Brighton, NY 47 continued on Elmwood Avenue through \\"Twelve Corners\\", intersecting NY 31 (Monroe Avenue) at the location, to what is now I-590. At the northbound entrance ramp of the modern interchange between I-590 and Elmwood Avenue, NY 47 separated from the latter, entering the freeway. While what is now I-590 was constructed and open from Winton Road to I-490, it had no signed designation between Winton and Elmwood. =Eastern expressway= NY 47 followed modern I-590 northward through Brighton to the Can of Worms, where NY 47 met I-490 for the second time. Due to the way the interchange was designed at the time, traffic continuing on NY 47 across I-490 had to merge with I-490 traffic for roughly before exiting I-490 onto the other portion of NY 47. North of I-490, NY 47 followed the length of what is now NY 590 through Brighton, Rochester, and Irondequoit to Culver Road at the Lake Ontario shoreline. History =Original alignment= { \\"type\\": \\"ExternalData\\", \\"service\\": \\"page\\", \\"title\\": \\"New York State Route 47 (1930).map\\" } When NY 47 was first commissioned in the Rochester area , it was routed along previously unnumbered roadways, with its northwest terminus located at the intersection of NY 31 (Lyell Avenue) and Howard Road in Gates. NY 47 took Howard Road south, passing through Gates Center and intersecting NY 33 before crossing the then-New York Central Railroad main line (now the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision) at-grade. The route remained on Howard Road until the intersection of Howard Road and Chili Avenue (NY 33A), which also included Brooks Avenue at this juncture of time. NY 47 turned east onto Brooks Avenue and proceeded toward the Greater Rochester International Airport, joining the current routing of NY 204 at Beahan Road (now Old Beahan Road). The intersection of Elmwood Avenue and Winton Road at Twelve Corners in Brighton. NY 47 entered on Elmwood from the left and turned north here onto Winton. NY 47 followed the entire alignment of NY 204 to what is now I-390 and continued on Brooks Avenue into Rochester to Genesee Park Boulevard. Route 47 turned south onto the street, which circles around the southwestern quadrant of the city, and followed its length to Genesee Street, where it turned south for a short distance before resuming its eastward alignment on Elmwood Avenue. The route remained on Elmwood Avenue into Brighton, where it turned north onto South Winton Road at Twelve Corners. At Highland Avenue, NY 47 reentered Rochester and became North Winton Road at East Avenue (NY 96). The route remained on Winton through Rochester and Irondequoit before terminating at Empire Boulevard (then US 104, now NY 404) just west of Irondequoit Bay. =Expressway realignments= East of Rochester In the early 1950s, construction began on the Sea Breeze Expressway, a mostly limited-access highway linking the Lake Ontario shoreline to the proposed I-490 east of Rochester. The first portion of the road, a divided highway extending from East Ridge Road in Irondequoit to Culver Road just west of the Irondequoit Bay Outlet, was opened to traffic by 1954 as a realignment of NY 18. Construction on a limited-access extension south to Empire Boulevard (three blocks west of NY 47's western terminus) began at some point between 1956 and 1958 and was completed by 1960 as a realignment of US 104. Another extension of the highway south to the partially complete I-490 in Brighton was completed and largely became part of a rerouted NY 47 by the following year. At the time, NY 47 left the expressway at Blossom Road and followed it west to Winton Road, where it rejoined its original routing. Winton Road (former NY 47) at NY 96 in Rochester By 1964, construction was underway on a new expressway leading south from I-490 at the Can of Worms to Elmwood Avenue east of Twelve Corners. The highway was completed , at which time NY 47 was realigned to follow the Sea Breeze Expressway and the new expressway south through the Can of Worms to its end at a partial interchange with Elmwood Avenue (now I-590 exit 3). It continued west on Elmwood Avenue to Twelve Corners, where it reconnected to its old alignment at Winton Road. West of Rochester The first realignment of NY 47 west of the city occurred when it was rerouted between Chili and Elmwood Avenues to bypass the then-Rochester‚ÄìMonroe County Airport to the south. Instead of turning east onto Brooks Avenue as it did prior to 1962, the route continued south on Beahan Road to Scottsville Road (NY 383), where it turned to overlap NY 383 north to Elmwood Avenue. At the time, Beahan Road connected directly to Scottsville Road (via modern Old Beahan Road) as the primary runway southwest of the airport had yet to be extended to its present length. By 1962, construction was underway on a new limited-access highway paralleling NY 47 (Howard Road) to the east between NY 31 and NY 33. Within two years, work had begun on an extension of the highway south along the Erie Canal to Scottsville Road. Farther east, construction was underway on a new highway leading south from I-490 to Elmwood Avenue east of Twelve Corners. Reference marker for NY 47 on NY 590 in Irondequoit All of the limited-access highway between NY 31 and NY 383 opened to traffic . NY 47 was reconfigured to begin a half-mile (0.8 km) to the east of Howard Road at modern NY 390 exit 21 and follow the new highway southeastward to its temporary end at what is now I-390 exit 17 east of the airport. At this point, NY 47 joined its pre-1965 routing and followed NY 383 northeastward into the city limits. By 1968, construction was underway on a northward extension of the expressway to US 104 in Greece. It was completed and opened to traffic by 1971. =Extensions and deletion= NY 47 was officially extended on both ends on January 1, 1970, to terminate at Lake Ontario on opposite sides of Rochester. In Greece, the designation officially followed what is now NY 390 north to the Lake Ontario State Parkway; however, the portion between US 104 and the parkway had yet to be constructed. To the east in Irondequoit, NY 47 was stretched northward along the Sea Breeze Expressway to Culver Road, resulting in overlaps with both US 104 and NY 18\\\\. At the time, the overlap with US 104 existed only between Empire Boulevard and the Keeler Street Expressway, which became the new alignment of the route through Irondequoit after its completion in 1969.National Bridge Inventory, a database compiled by the United States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, available at www.nationalbridges.com. Accessed December 9, 2007. The overlap with US 104 was eliminated entirely the following year when that route was realigned onto a new expressway alignment between NY 47 and Webster that traversed Irondequoit Bay via the newly built Irondequoit Bay Bridge. The overlap with NY 18 was eliminated when NY 18 was truncated to its current eastern terminus in Kodak Park. reference marker for NY 940L along Howard Road (former NY 47) in Gates On March 18, 1980, the NY 47 designation was eliminated and split into four other routes. From NY 104 in Greece to I-490, NY 47 became NY 390\\\\. The section from I-490 south to NY 383 was designated as part of I-390; however, it would not connect to the existing portion of I-390 south of Rochester until 1981, when the interchange between I-390 and I-590 was completed. The segment of NY 47 from Elmwood Avenue north to the Can of Worms became part of I-590, which continued southwest along the freeway to Winton Road. From the Can of Worms to Lake Ontario, NY 47 was redesignated NY 590. Off the expressways, the former alignments of NY 47 now carry several designations. Howard Road, bypassed by the 1960s realignment in Gates, is still maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation as NY 940L, an unsigned reference route in length. Beahan Road, also bypassed by the same 1960s rerouting, was reconfigured into its current alignment by 1971 due to an expansion by the airport. The section of Beahan Road that carried NY 47 is currently maintained by Monroe County as part of County Route 164 (CR 164), the county's unsigned designation for all of Beahan Road. The portion of NY 47 on Elmwood Avenue from the Rochester city line to I-590 is also maintained by Monroe County as part of CR 87. Lastly, the segments of Winton Road outside of the Rochester city limits are now part of CR 98. The remainder of NY 47 and the former alignments of the route are currently locally maintained.

Statistics Canada. is an unincorporated community recognized as a local urban district located in the Municipality of West Interlake in Manitoba's Interlake Region. The RM of Siglunes was incorporated in 1917. Ashern was named after A. S. Hern, a timekeeper of the firm that constructed the railway that served the Western Interlake. Today the municipality supports the agriculture (mostly beef in addition to a few private pork and chicken farms), fishing, mineral extraction, recreation and tourism industries. The community of Ashern is the largest community in the RM and is a regional service centre to a trading area of approximately 8,000 people.  Activities  During the winter months, there are various sports to partake in: hockey, curling, figure skating, ringette, snowmobiling, ice-fishing and cross country skiing. Different levels of most team sports exist to accommodate the wide range of ages that play on them. Ashern has an indoor skating rink and a curling rink, both with artificial ice. Summer sports include baseball, water sports, swimming, and other games such as horseshoes. Ashern has a nine-hole golf course with grass greens, watered fairways and a licensed clubhouse. Ashern has a community hall, an Elk's Hall and a Royal Canadian Legion Hall that cater to a wide variety of events and community groups. Wedding socials, bingos, dances, and Christmas concerts are some of the things that go on throughout the year. The local beaches boast fine sand and clear, clean water. Lake Manitoba Narrows Lodge and Silver Bay are popular places for local cottage owners and seasonal campers. These areas are privately owned, although camping is available by reservation for the Lake Manitoba Narrows Lodge. Lake Manitoba has many sand bars which are ideal for children. The Ashern Museum is open during the summer months and contains several buildings which house pioneer displays and artifacts. The fall months are welcomed by avid hunters as the Siglunes region is a hunter's paradise. It hosts the Annual Ashern Rodeo during the Labour Day weekend. A street dance, fireworks, parade, rodeo and social are also a part of Labour Day Weekend in Ashern, as well as the Ashern Horse Show. The Ashern Hornets is the hockey team that plays in the SIHL (South Interlake Hockey League). Ashern is the hometown of the former NHL player Chuck Arnason as well as actor Adam Beach. Ashern is about two hours north of Winnipeg. The (Grade 5-12) high school is the largest in the division. It also has an elementary school (Kindergarten- Grade 4), recently built daycare, and a hospital serving the region. Climate Ashern has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb) with warm summers and very cold winters. Due to its position far from large moderating bodies of water and its quite high latitude Ashern see extreme temperature variation over the course of the year.

He was a right arm leg-spinner. Currently Sivaramakrishnan is a cricket commentator started his commentary career in a test match between India Vs Bangladesh on 12 November 2000. He also serves as one of the players‚Äô representatives on the International Cricket Council‚Äôs cricket committee. Early days Siva first drew attention as a 12-year-old claiming 7 wickets for 2 runs (7/2) in a Madras inter-schools championship game. At fifteen, he was the youngest member of the Under-19 India squad that toured Sri Lanka under Ravi Shastri in 1980. He started his first class career at the age of 16, Siva made an immediate impression. On his debut against Delhi cricket team in the quarter final of the 1981/82 Ranji Trophy, he took 7 for 28 in the second innings, all the wickets coming in a spell of eleven overs. On the weight of this performance, he was selected in the South Zone side to play the West Zone in the Duleep Trophy. After going wicketless in the first innings, he took five in the second, including the wicket of Sunil Gavaskar who padded up a to a googly. Siva was immediately noticed and picked for the team to tour Pakistan in 1982/83 and later to the West Indies. He had played only three first class matches till then. Siva made his Test debut at St. John's at the age of 17 years and 118 days. He was the youngest Indian Test cricketer till that point of time. He went wicketless but scored 17 runs in the only innings that he played. In 1984, he toured Zimbabwe with the Young India side under Ravi Shastri . Later that year, he bowled himself back to the Indian side taking of 4 for 27 against the visiting English cricket team for the India Under-25. Rise to the top Siva's second Test appearance was in the first Test against England at the Bombay. His first wicket was Graeme Fowler who was caught and bowled off a full toss. Many of Siva's wickets came off full-tosses and half volleys. He could make the ball dip sharply late in its flight which often made the dismissed batsman look silly. His 6 for 64 and 6 for 117 helped India to an eight wicket win. It was India's first win in a Test match since 1981. Siva took another six wickets in the next innings at Delhi. He took only five more wickets in the series. In the World Championship of Cricket in Australia in the same season, he finished as the top wicket taker. It was a time when spinners, especially leg-spinners, were considered a luxury in one day cricket. A memorable dismissal was of Javed Miandad who was stumped off a leg break in the final. Siva did similarly well in the four nations tournament in Sharjah a few weeks later. Decline and fall His next season saw a sudden drop of form. He played a Test in Sri Lanka and two in Australia with little success. That was the end of his Test career. He made an unexpected comeback to the 1987 World Cup team and played in two matches. The only wicket that he took was that of Zimbabwean John Traicos, caught at midwicket by Gavaskar off a full toss. Siva converted himself into a batsman and continued to play first class cricket on and off for another ten years. He contributed three centuries when Tamil Nadu won the Ranji trophy in 1987/88. There were frequent reports of a comeback to the national team, but they all proved to be rumours. In his last season he played for Baroda. Siva's name With Hugh Bromley-Davenport and B. K. Venkatesh Prasad, he shares the record for the longest 'supposed' surname among Test cricketers. However, Sivaramakrishan is not his surname at all. He started out as L. Sivaramakrishnan but, as is typical with expanding initialled south Indian names, turning the L to Laxmanan caused Sivaramakrishnan to appear to be his surname. Sivaramakrishnan is his given name and his father's given name was Laxmanan and hence he started out as L. Sivaramakrishnan as is common with Tamils to keep the first letter of one's father's first name as initial.  Coaching career  In December 2017, Chennai Super Kings named Laxman Sivaramakrishnan Spin Bowling coach for 2018 Indian Premier League. ICC In May 2013, Sivaramakrishnan was named as a players' representative on the International Cricket Council's cricket committee. In the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 he voiced his first commentary in the Tamil Language which was broadcast by Star Sports Tamil.

DCMT was based in Welham Green, Hertfordshire, north of London. Company history Starting as early as 1939, DCMT manufactured die cast toys for children. The 'Lone Star' name was chosen because of a demand at the time for toy guns and rifles popular in the Western films in cinemas all over Britain (Johnson 1998, 117-118). Eventually, the company also made tie-in toy guns licensed from the James Bond films and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. TV series. Production may have begun as early as 1939, continuing to 1947 in 'The Bridge Garage', Green Lanes, Palmers Green, London, N.13. Reportedly, from 1941 - 1942 temporary additional premises were opened on Pembroke Road, Muswell Hill, London, N.10. From 1947 - 1956 the 'River Works', 152 Green Lanes, Palmers Green, London, N.13, were in operation. In 1956, a milestone occurred with the move to a purpose-built factory of 37,000 sq. ft. at 168 Great North Road, Hatfield, Hertfordshire. In 1958, another factory was acquired at Ambridge, Gower & Mills, Holloways Lane, Welham Green, Hatfield, Hertfordshire. This became the main manufacturing facility through the 1960s. Toy soldiers and other figures Early products included many hand painted hollowcast metal toy soldier figures. These were mostly military, with some cowboy and Native American examples. From 1955 to 1976 figures were made in plastic and included British Guards, Royal Marines and Red Beret Paratroopers, American Civil War, Robin Hood, and safari. World War II soldiers included German and British as well as ANZAC figures which were also painted as the King's African Rifles. The sets were often accompanied by die cast military vehicles. Figures were licensed from other children's TV and film series and included Noddy, Popeye and Zorro as well as James Bond 007 Thunderball frogmen with CIA figures in orange and SPECTRE in black with plastic underwater vehicles. Vehicles =Competition with Dinky and Corgi= Interpreting the base of a Lone Star vehicle can be difficult. Some of Impy Toys read: \\"Lone Star Road-Master Impy Super Cars\\" (Ragan 2000, p. 34). To add to the confusion, elsewhere on the base it would usually say DCMT. Other 1:50 scale vehicles chassis simply read, \\"Lone Star Made in England\\". To keep up with competitors such as Corgi and Dinky, Lone Star began producing Corgi-sized diecast toy vehicles in 1956 with its Road-Master series (later spelled without the hyphen, see Ragan 2000, p. 34, also Johnson 1998, p. 118). Castings on the earlier vehicles, though handsome, were a bit cruder than the competition. For example, the double-deck bus had its casting line, for its two halves, right down the centre of the roof. Also, most earlier Lone Stars have simpler bumper, grille and body detail than Corgi or Dinky. The later Impy series, however, outdid Matchbox by a long shot. Earlier 1960s models commonly had orange tinted plastic transparent windows, but no interior detail. Head and tail lights were emphasised with silver or red paint. Tyres started as rubber, then later in the mid-1960s, switched to hard ribbed black plastic which were advertised as \\"non-scratch\\". Perhaps this was supposed to appeal to parents who were afraid junior would mar the furniture with the toys. Wheels were simple aluminium with regular 'squeaky' axle hubs. Lone Star moved fairly quickly in an expanding ranges including the exceptional OO scale (1/76th) vehicles, and, later, the \\"Lone Star Impy\\" vehicles, which were uniformly about three and a half inches long (varying between 1:43 and 1:50 scales). Thus like Matchbox, vehicle sizes seemed to adhere more to a particular size than to a particular scale. Series of aeroplanes and military vehicles were also offered. In the late 1950s, many DCMT toys were licensed to the French company Jadali. These were made both in Paris and then, later, near Barcelona, Spain. The Spanish toys were called Jadali-Metamol. Most of these toys were diecast cowboy pistols and spaceman ray guns - DCMT vehicle tooling does not seem to have been made available to Jadali. =The Impy Series= Much changed with the introduction of the Impy line in 1966. Bright new packaging was introduced while the older, larger, Road-Master series was discontinued (though the name \\"Roadmaster\\" was still used). The new cars were a smaller three and a half inch size, similar to Mini-Dinkys, and were advertised as the \\"cars with everything\\" (Rixon 2005, p. 39). For example, the 1963 Chrysler Imperial was not offered by any other diecast maker and featured opening doors, hood, trunk, working steering and jewelled headlights (Ragan 2000, p. 35). The Impy Jaguar Mark X outshone the spartan Matchbox version with four jewelled headlights and opening 'everything' (Ragan 2000, pp. 48‚Äì51). Having so many features on a smaller diecast car could be unsightly, however, as cut door lines broke the smooth sides of the car on the Imperial, and other vehicles. On the FIAT 2300S Ghia coupe the cast line was rough and uneven from fender through door to fender again (Ragan 2000, pp. 25, 48). Volvo 1800 coupe. Sometimes door matches were not the best on Lonestar cars - they were a step below Corgi or Dinky in accuracy. It is interesting that Lone Star was the first toy producer to respond to Hot Wheels' hit of low-friction wheels (Rixon 2005, p. 10). In 1968, less than a year after the introduction of Hot Wheels, Impys were refitted with sporty fast wheels which Lone Star now called its \\"Flyer\\" series. The first Flyers' wheels were simple shiny silver wheels with black hubs, rather reminiscent of Corgi's first low-friction gold wheels with red hubs. Eventually cars were given a handsome five-spoke wheel (Rixon 2005, p. 54). By contrast, Topper's Johnny Lightning and Aurora's Cigarbox cars did not change wheel styles until about 1969, nearly two years after Mattel's premier. Similar to Majorette and others, Lone Star also offered gift sets of cars with trailers into the early 1980s, like the Range Rover pulling a zodiac-style inflatable boat (Rixon 2005, p. 115). Earlier Lone Star packaging was coloured similar to Corgi and especially Dinky, with red and yellow box panels. Later packaging was bright - almost luminescent - and Impy boxes were among the first to feature plastic windows, while Matchbox still had closed boxes (Rixon 2005, p. 39). Mini-Dinky, however, had little red garages that its vehicles came in. The Impy boxes featured a cute little red devil figure that may have been distasteful for some prudish adults. Some early D.C.M.T. castings were acquired in the early 1960s Gamda Koor Sabra in Israel. These were a few military vehicles including a very simple armored personnel carrier and a few other trucks. They were crudely reproduced until Gamda made a newer line of 1:43 scale mostly American cars starting about 1967. A Lone Star oddity were Impy series cars sold in the United States as \\"Mini-Cars\\", packaged by the Physio Chem Corporation in blister packs that showed a hand 'holding' the car in the clear blister (the car in the blister was visible from both sides of the package). Physio Chem was known for clever 'how to' chemistry, magic, detective, and sewing kits, and often packaged toys made in other countries under their name. The cars were standard Lone Star Impys made in England and imported for Physio Chem and packaged in the states. Though the Lone Star name appears nowhere on the package, the bases of the cars are standard Impys and say, \\"Made in England\\". =Tuf Tots= About 1968 or 1969, Lone Star introduced a smaller, approximately two inch long vehicles of varied scales called \\"Tuf-Tots\\" that were simply cast vehicles without opening parts similar in concept to the small Tootsietoys. There were four cars, sixteen trucks, and a couple of other vehicles offered. Cars were a Citroen DS convertible, a '68 Dodge Dart, a Corvette Stingray, and a Mercedes- Benz 280 SL. The first series were all convertibles with plastic drivers in different colours (Tuf-Tots cars webpage). The second series had no driver, rather a plastic black roof. Some vehicles of the series were re-released in the mid-1980s as brightly coloured \\"Zippy Zoomers\\" and others, like the DS convertible were used by Microlink Industries of Wales in a series named \\"Mokes\\" which were tied to a comic book storyline (Lone Star 'Tuf-Tots' webpage). Tuf-Tots really couldn't have been for tots, as they were almost small enough to choke on. Aeroplanes Following the lead of Dinky Toys and French CIJ, Lone Star also started producing diecast model jet liners in 1959 with its 2.5.0 Series (standing for 1:250 scale). Planes featured were American Boeings, like the Pan Am 707, but also notable British models like the Bristol Britannia (with \\"British & Commonwealth\\" decals) and the Vickers Viscount. Planes came assembled but unpainted with transfers and paint instructions. Trains A class 23 \\"Baby Deltic\\" Treble-O-Lectric series engine from about 1960. The company started producing (OOO scale), 2mm to the foot, British and American outline model push-along-trains in 1957. These utilised 8.25mm gauge metal track and a range of diecast station buildings. This line was designed by long term Lone Star employee Stuart Goss, and followed in 1960 by \\"Treble-0-Lectric\\" electrically powered working models of two British diesel locomotives: The Class 24 Sulzer Type 2 diesel, the Class 23 Napier Type 2 \\"Baby Deltic\\" diesel, an American Baldwin 0-8-0 Steam Locomotive and an F7 US Diesel Electric which was available in both US and Canadian liveries (Treble-O-Lectric 2012). These were accompanied by track, British & Continental outline rolling stock, scenic items and other accessories, such as the \\"Gulliver County\\" range of rubber moulded buildings in 2mm scale. Vacuum-formed bases were available to form \\"instant\\" scenic layouts and these could be purchased separately or in sets. The electric train models were reasonably well received in the Model Railway press of the time (although some felt that the rubber band drive would be somewhat awkward for children to change) and essentially showed that a viable 2mm to the foot system could be designed, manufactured and marketed in the UK. Lone Star Treble-O-Lectric trains essentially introduced the concept that would later become British \\"N\\" gauge - 10 years ahead of the competition. However, limited toy trade distribution, the existence of the Tri-ang TT scale range and poor reliability of the driving mechanisms (which used final drive from a pair of elastic bands) ensured that the Treble-O-Lectric line never sold well enough to pay back the investment. In 1965, production ceased, but the following year a new range of push-along trains - \\"Treble-O-Trains\\" - was introduced, using the existing tools, and these were sold in blister packs. The premier outlet was the British High Street retail chain Woolworths. In 1968 the range was rebranded \\"Impy/Treble-O-Trains\\" and the term N gauge utilised on the blister pack instead of OOO scale. In 1970 the range was again rebranded as \\"Lone Star Model Trains\\" and boxes used instead of blister packs. Unsold stock was apparently finally cleared from the company's Hatfield warehouse during 1988. U.S. Lone Star expert Dallas J. Mallerich was apparently offered any remaining OOO railway stock but the price quoted was too high. Legacy In 1983, the DCMT Group went into Receivership. German company Weco; famed for their fireworks and owners of toy company Wicke; bought the Hatfield factory and Lone Star brand. Weco had supplied the caps for Lone Star toy guns via its Wicke subsidiary so was keen for Lone Star to continue so it could still make the caps. The other factories were sold by the receivers to other owners. The Palmers Green factory at 152 Green Lanes was sold to a Chemist's Sundries company. The factory in Holloways Lane, Welham Green was sold and demolished in 1984. Toys continued to be made at the Hatfield plant but in 1988, the entire complex closed with production being moved to Hong Kong. The factory was demolished a year later. Sohni Esco of Wetherby, Yorkshire, took over the importing and marketing of Lone Star products. They had previously imported Weco fireworks. Sohni Esco itself closed down in 2001 and in its later years focused solely on fireworks. Today there is a whole new interest in Lone Star as new collectors have begun to take an interest in the marque. A thriving Lone Star collectors circle regularly displays fully working model train layouts solely using Lone Star equipment. Their annual exhibitions are held at Whitewebbs Museum of Transport, at Crews Hill, near Enfield, Greater London. The 'OOO'-gauge train displays, both large and small, are more popular in the UK, but also exist in Europe, U.S.A., Australia, New Zealand and Canada. A vast array of other Lone Star die-cast models and toys are also exhibited by the collectors at Whitewebbs Museum the event usually held on the last Sunday in September. Intellectual property of the 'Lone Star' name is owned by the Heinrich Bauer group and toy guns are still sold under the Sohni-Wicke Armforces und Spielwarenfabrik division of the company (Heinrich Bauer Group 2010).

Levi was born in Giessen, Germany, the son of a rabbi. He was educated at Giessen and Mannheim, and came to Vinzenz Lachner's notice. From 1855 to 1858 Levi studied at the Leipzig Conservatory, and after a series of travels which took him to Paris, he obtained his first post as music director at Saarbr√ºcken, which post he exchanged for that at Mannheim in 1861. From 1862 to 1864 he was chief conductor of the German Opera in Rotterdam, then till 1872 at Karlsruhe, when he went to Munich, a post he held until 1896, when ill-health compelled him to resign. Levi also taught at the Leipzig Conservatory, where his pupils included the conductor Emil Steinbach. Levi's name is indissolubly connected with the increased public appreciation of Wagner's music. He was a longtime friend of Wagner; when preparing for the inaugural Bayreuth Festival, he wrote to his father, \\"Wagner is the best and noblest of men ... I thank God daily for the privilege to be close to such a man. It is the most beautiful experience of my life\\".Derek Strahan, \\"Was Wagner Jewish?\\", Limelight, February 2012, p. 59 He conducted the first performance of Parsifal at Bayreuth in 1882, even though Wagner initially objected to this and was quoted as saying that Levi should be baptized before conducting it. However, Ludwig II of Bavaria, who was Wagner's patron, told him in a letter that ‚ÄúNothing is more repugnant, nothing less edifying than such squabbles; people after all are brothers, in spite of all denominational differences.‚ÄùJoachim K√∂hler, Richard Wagner: The last of the titans, Yale University Press, 2004, p. 480 Levi was connected with the musical life at Bayreuth during the remainder of his career. He visited London in 1895, and died in Munich in 1900. He was interred in a Mausoleum in the grounds of his villa later that year in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. During his early years, Levi also worked as a composer. His first opus number was a piano concerto published in Paris, besides which he also wrote a violin sonata.

It was published in 1984 by TSR, Inc. and written by David Cook. Contents David Cook wrote Combat Shield and Mini-Adventure as a supplement with two purposes in mind. First it included a screen to hide a Gamemaster's material and dice rolls during the course of play and provide useful tables for quick reference. Secondly, a small adventure, The Treasure of the Hideous One, came in the same supplement. =Combat Shield= This DM's screen contains tables for the Basic and Expert D&D; rules. The Combat Shield in this supplement is a precursor to far more elaborate GM screens used today. It can be used with either/or the Basic or Expert set. It included tables for saving throws, thief abilities, undead turning, to-hit rolls, the combat sequence, monster experience tables, and player experience tables among other items. =The Treasure of the Hideous One= Plot summary This adventure follows along relatively traditional paths. The group of player characters finds a message that indicates a long hidden treasure lies somewhere in a swampy region. An expedition led by an intrepid explorer attempted to find the treasure but came to an untimely end. The group eventually fights their way through various enemies to secure the treasure and learn the fate of the original expedition. The module lists several possible treasures to choose as the final reward. Despite the shortness of the adventure it requires a fairly advanced party because of the presence of Rosentos the Vampire. Publication history AC2 Combat Shield and Mini-Adventure was designed by David Cook, with cover art by Jeff Easley, and was published by TSR in 1984 as a cardstock screen with an 8-page pamphlet. The 10th Anniversary Dungeons & Dragons Collector's Set boxed set, published by TSR in 1984, included the rulebooks from the Basic, Expert, and Companion sets; modules AC2, AC3, B1, B2, and M1, Blizzard Pass; Player Character Record Sheets; and dice; this set was limited to 1,000 copies, and was sold by mail and at GenCon 17. Reception Doug Cowie reviewed AC2 for Imagine magazine, giving it a positive review. He particularly praised the looks of the product, singling out the cover art as finally offering a credible visual of the game's monsters. Cowie liked the functionality of the referee screen, noting the sensible choice of tables and the effort to create a single \\"to-hit\\" table for all character classes. However, he found the latter \\"quite difficult to read\\". Cowie also faulted the screen's three-page player side for containing not just the excellent cover and one page worth of information but also one page of \\"hype\\". Cowie thought the mini-adventure \\"rather good\\", \\"original and carefully thought out\\". According to him, the adventure alone was worth the price of the product, with the screen a \\"reasonably useful\\" bonus.

UBA1 participates in ubiquitination and the NEDD8 pathway for protein folding and degradation, among many other biological processes. This protein has been linked to X-linked spinal muscular atrophy type 2, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancers. Structure =Gene= The UBA1 gene is located in the chromosome band Xp11.23, consisting of 31 exons. =Protein= The UBA1 for ubiquitin (Ub) is a 110‚Äì120 kDa monomeric protein, and the UBA1 for the ubiquitin-like protein (Ubls) NEDD8 and SUMO are heterodimeric complexes with similar molecular weights. All eukaryotic UBA1 contain a two-fold repeat of a domain, derived from the bacterial MoeB and ThiF proteins, with one occurrence each in the N-terminal and C-terminal half of the UBA1 for Ub, or the separate subunits of the UBA1 for NEDD8 and SUMO. The UBA1 for Ub consists of four building blocks: First, the adenylation domains composed of two MoeB/ThiF-homology motifs, the latter of which binds ATP and Ub; second, the catalytic cysteine half-domains, which contain the E1 active site cysteine inserted into each of the adenylation domains; third, a four-helix bundle that represents a second insertion in the inactive adenylation domain and immediately follows the first catalytic cysteine half-domain; and fourth, the C-terminal ubiquitin-fold domain, which recruits specific E2s.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the first step in ubiquitin conjugation, or ubiquitination, to mark cellular proteins for degradation. Specifically, UBA1 catalyzes the ATP- dependent adenylation of ubiquitin, thereby forming a thioester bond between the two. It also continues to participate in subsequent steps of ubiquination as a Ub carrier. There are only two human ubiquitin-activating enzymes, UBA1 and UBA6, and thus UBA1 is largely responsible for protein ubiquitination in humans. Through its central role in ubiquitination, UBA1 has been linked to cell cycle regulation, endocytosis, signal transduction, apoptosis, DNA damage repair, and transcriptional regulation. Additionally, UBA1 helps regulate the NEDD8 pathway, thus implicating it in protein folding, as well as mitigating the depletion of ubiquitin levels during stress.  Clinical significance  Mutations in UBA1 are associated with X-linked spinal muscular atrophy type 2. UBA1 has also been implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy, as well as cancer and tumors. Since UBA1 is involved in multiple biological processes, there are concerns that inhibiting UBA1 would also damage normal cells. Nonetheless, preclinical testing of a UBA1 inhibitor in mice with leukemia revealed no additional toxic effects to normal cells, and the success of other drugs targeting pleiotropic targets likewise support the safety of using UBA1 inhibitor in cancer treatment Moreover, the UBA1 inhibitors Largazole, as well as its ketone and ester derivatives, preferentially targets cancer over normal cells by specifically blocking the ligation of Ub and UBA1 during the adenylation step of the E1 pathway. MLN4924, a NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor functioning according to similar mechanisms, is currently undergoing phase I clinical trials.  Interactions  UBA1 has been shown to interact with: *UBC13 *PYR-41 *himeic acid A *hyrtioreticulines A‚ÄìE  References   Further reading        *  External links  * ","title":"UBA1"},{"id":"2620908","text":"Roger Federer defeated Lleyton Hewitt, 6‚Äì0, 7‚Äì6(7‚Äì3), 6‚Äì0, in the final to win the Men's Singles tennis title at the 2004 US Open.

His father, Arthur Mallon, was a salesman and his mother, Caroline, kept the home. Mallon graduated from Sewanhaka High School in 1969. He has often said that he had \\"the kind of happy childhood that is so damaging to a writer.\\"Michael McGregor, \\"Thomas Mallon,\\" Twenty-First-Century American Novelists, Dictionary of Literary Biography, vol. 350. Gale Cengage Learning. Mallon went on to study English at Brown University, where he wrote his undergraduate honors thesis on American author Mary McCarthy. He credits McCarthy, with whom he later became friends, as the most enduring influence on his career as a writer.Andr√© Bernard, \\"An Interview with Thomas Mallon,\\" Five Points, vol. XIII (January 2009): 97-114. Mallon earned a Master of Arts and a Ph.D. from Harvard University, where he wrote his dissertation on the English World War I poet Edmund Blunden. On sabbatical from Vassar College in 1982-1983, Mallon spent a year as a visiting scholar at St. Edmund's House (later College) at Cambridge University. It was here that he drafted most of A Book of One's Own, a work of nonfiction about diarists and diary-writing. The book's rather unexpected success earned Mallon tenure at Vassar College, where he taught English from 1979-1991. Writing career Thomas Mallon's writing style is characterized by charm, wit, and a meticulous attention to detail and character development. His nonfiction often explores \\"fringe\\" genres‚Äîdiaries, letters, plagiarism‚Äîjust as his fiction frequently tells the stories of characters \\"on the fringes of big events.\\"Andr√© Bernard, \\"An Interview with Thomas Mallon,\\" Five Points, vol.

Richard Eder, writing in the Los Angeles Times (28 November 1984) called the book \\"an engaging meditation on the varied and irrepressible spirit of life that insists on preserving itself on paper.\\" In A Book of One's Own, Mallon covers a wide range of diarists from Samuel Pepys to Anais Nin. He explained his enthusiasm for the genre by saying: \\"Writing books is too good an idea to be left to authors.\\" The success of A Book of One's Own won Mallon a Rockefeller Fellowship in 1986.Thomas Mallon, \\"Introduction,\\" A Book of One's Own. Ticknor and Fields (1984). Mallon then began publishing fiction, a genre in which he'd informally dabbled throughout childhood and young adulthood. Mallon published his first novel, Arts and Sciences, in 1988 about Arthur Dunne, a 22-year-old Harvard graduate student in English. Soon after its publication, in 1989, Mallon released a second nonfiction book called Stolen Words: Forays Into the Origins and Ravages of Plagiarism. Henry and Clara, published in 1994, established Mallon as a writer of historical fiction from that point forward. The novel traces the lives of Major Henry Rathbone and Clara Harris, the young couple who accompanied Abraham Lincoln to Ford's Theatre on April 14, 1865. A story of star-crossed lovers intermingles with personal and political tragedies and spans the couple's first meeting in childhood to their eventual derangement.Thomas Mallon. Henry and Clara.

Route description The highway's southern terminus is at Interstate 30 in Dallas. From there, it follows Grand Avenue along White Rock Lake and then Garland Road into Garland as it passes Interstate 635. In downtown Garland, Highway 78 follows the central streets of Avenues B and D before joining Lavon Drive and moving northeastward. It continues to the northeast through Sachse and Wylie, crossing between Lake Ray Hubbard and Lake Lavon. It passes through Lavon before turning north through Farmersville and Blue Ridge. At SH 160, just before SH 121, SH 78 turns east, continuing to Leonard before turning northeast again to Bailey. At Bailey, SH 78 turns north and cuts through Bonham (as Center Street) just before it reaches the border with Oklahoma, where it crosses a 1938 truss bridge over the Red River. The route continues as Oklahoma State Highway 78 through Durant to its terminus at Tishomingo. History 50px The highway was originally designated on August 21, 1923, from Dallas to Bonham, replacing SH 5C. On May 19, 1924, the section from Desert to Bonham was cancelled. SH 78 was instead rerouted on its current route north of Desert to Bonham. On March 30, 1933, SH 78 was extended to Oklahoma. On October 6, 1943, SH 78 was extended south to Loop 12. On June 21, 1951, the section from US 67 to Loop 12 was renumbered to Spur 244. US 67 was rerouted over current I-30, and the old route was transferred to rerouted SH 78 and the rest northeast of SH 78 was renumbered to FM 7, which was cancelled and transferred to SH 66 on November 30, 1961. SH 78A was a spur designated on May 9, 1927 from Desert to Bells. This spur was renumbered as SH 160 on March 19, 1930.  Flooding  In 1990, SH 78 was flooded, as engineers at the Lake Lavon Dam decided to release the water from the lake into the East Fork of the Trinity River. For a month and a half, the traffic going between Wylie and the eastern portion of Collin County was diverted to go through the city of Rockwall, a nearly detour.

P{rinceton, New Jersey: Princeton Architectural Press. p.284 ) is a non-denominational chapel designed by noted architect Eero Saarinen. It is located on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, next to Kresge Auditorium and the Kresge Oval, which Saarinen also designed. Though a small building, the Chapel is often noted as a successful example of mid-century modern architecture in the United States. Saarinen also designed the landscaping surrounding all three locations. Design From the outside, the chapel is a simple, windowless brick cylinder set inside a very shallow concrete moat. It is in diameter and high, and topped by an aluminum spire. The brick is supported by a series of low arches. Saarinen chose bricks that were rough and imperfect to create a textured effect. The whole is set in two groves of London Planetrees, with a long wall to the east, all designed by Saarinen. The wall and trees provide a uniform background for the chapel, and isolate the site from the noise and bustle of adjacent buildings. Within is an intimate space, stunning in its immediate visual impact. Windowless interior walls are undulating brick. Like a cascade of light, a full-height metal sculpture by Harry Bertoia glitters from the circular skylight down to a small, unadorned marble altar. Natural light filters upward from shallow slits in the walls catching rippling reflected light from the moat; this dim ambient light is complemented by artificial lighting. The chapel's curving spire and bell tower were designed by the sculptor Theodore Roszak and was added in 1956.Theodore Roszak: Working Drawings for MIT Bell Tower, MIT List Visual Arts Center, August 15 - December 16, 2005 The chapel has an excellent organ that was custom-designed for the space by Walter Holtkamp of the Holtkamp Organ Company, located in Cleveland, Ohio.

Known in popular culture as \\"The Fight Doctor,‚Äù Pacheco left Ali's team in the mid-1970s after Ali refused his medical advice to retire. For the next two decades, Pacheco was a noted boxing analyst for several television networks, including NBC and Showtime. He also became an author and self-taught painter, with most of his works focused on his career in boxing and his youth in the Ybor City neighborhood of Tampa, Florida. Early life Fernando Pacheco was born in the Cuban-American immigrant community of Ybor City in Tampa, Florida, to J.D., a pharmacist, and Consuela Pacheco, both of Spaniard-Cuban descent. Raised bilingual, Pacheco helped in his father‚Äôs drugstore, which sparked his interest in medicine. As a teenager, Pacheco was also a waiter at the Columbia Restaurant. Though not a boxer himself, Pacheco took an early interest in boxing. Ybor City was a hotbed for the sport, with amateur matches regularly held at the Circulo Cubano de Tampa and other clubs and venues around the neighborhood, and Pacheco attended many bouts. Pacheco also developed an early interest in art, which was inspired by a trip to the Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota with his maternal grandfather, Gustavo Jimenez. Pacheco graduated from Tampa Jefferson High School, earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Florida and completed his medical degree from the Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami. Career As a young physician, Pacheco set up a medical practice in the Overtown community of Miami. In the late 1950s, he regularly attended boxing cards arranged by local promoter Chris Dundee. One night after a fight card, Pacheco was introduced to Angelo Dundee, the promoter's brother, a boxing trainer who ran the 5th Street Gym. Angelo Dundee offered the doctor free tickets to matches if he would \\"help stitch up my fighters\\", beginning an iconic partnership that would last many years. =Muhammad Ali= Pacheco met Muhammad Ali in 1960, when Cassius Clay (as he was known at the time) came to the 5th Street Gym in Miami, Florida to train with Angelo Dundee. Pacheco became Clay's cornerman and fight physician from 1962‚Äì1977. Pacheco described Clay as anatomically the most physically-perfect specimen of a human being he had ever seen. When Clay joined the Nation of Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Ali in 1964, members of the Nation reportedly wanted him to replace Pacheco, Dundee, and the rest of his support staff. Ali refused, preferring to continue working with the team of people who had helped him become heavyweight champion. By the mid-1970s, Pacheco observed that Ali's reflexes had slowed, and expressed medical concern that the now veteran boxer had sustained some brain and kidney damage due to years of punishment in the ring. After Ali won a decision against the hard-hitting Earnie Shavers in September 1977, Pacheco recommended that he retire from the sport. When Ali refused, Pacheco decided that from a medical perspective, he couldn't ethically continue as Ali's primary physician and left the fighter's camp. Pacheco later explained that \\"The New York State Athletic Commission gave me a report that showed Ali's kidneys were falling apart. I wrote to Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer, his wife and Ali himself. I got nothing back in response. That's when I decided enough is enough.\\" Ali fought four more matches (losing three) after Pacheco left his team before finally retiring in late 1981. Despite their disagreement, Pacheco and Ali remained friends. The two were reunited in person for a final time in 2002, when Ali, who was by then suffering the acute effects of Parkinson's syndrome, told his former physician, \\"You was right.\\" Later life Pacheco moved on to become a television boxing analyst, working for NBC and Univision. As a Cuban- American, Pacheco spoke Spanish fluently, and was able to conduct interviews and translate corners between rounds in real time for English speaking networks when bouts featured Latino fighters. Pacheco also provided color commentary in Spanish for fight broadcasts, and other sports-related packages televised on Univision. Pacheco would become Showtime's featured boxing analyst in the early 1980s and continued his association with the network until his retirement from TV in the late 1990s, covering many notable fights along the way. Pacheco was the author of several books, plays, screenplays, and short stories. Many of them are set in the Ybor City neighborhood where he grew up. Pacheco‚Äôs works included a memoir (Ybor City Chronicles), an autobiography (Blood in My Coffee) and a cookbook (The Columbia Restaurant Spanish Cookbook, co-authored with longtime friend Adela Gonzmart). Pacheco was also an award-winning self-taught artist, primarily inspired by Norman Rockwell with influences of Diego Rivera's use of bold colors. As with his writing, the subjects of many of his paintings are boxing and his youth in Ybor City. Pacheco was portrayed by Paul Rodriguez in the cinema film Ali (2001). A biographical film, Ferdie Pacheco: The World of the Fight Doctor, was released in 2004. Death Pacheco died in his sleep on 16 November 2017 at his home in Miami, Florida at the age of 89. Personal life Pacheco resided in Miami with his wife, Luisita, and had three daughters and one son: Dawn Marie, Tina Louise, Evelyn, and Ferdie James.

The film is based on Tezuka's manga series Phoenix. Plot Phoenix 2772 is set in the distant future where the planet Earth is dying from a lack of energy resources and a subjugating political climate sees all human beings produced in test tubes and their roles in society selected by computers, from pilot to politician, etc. Godo is one such child brought up to be a cadet and nursed by a beautiful robot-maid Olga. After noticing his exceptional abilities, Rock, a dictatorial candidate for prime minister, selects Godo to fulfil his agenda and travel into deep space and capture the mystical Phoenix ‚Äì its blood will manifestly heal the Earth, but Rock out of selfishness wants this to make him both prime minister and immortal by drinking its blood. The assignment troubles Godo partly because he has a love of all living creatures and he detests being trained to be a ruthless space hunter. He is told he will also have to leave his best friend Olga behind and that she will be destroyed. Most importantly he is romantically involved with Rena, daughter of Lord Eat (an \\"elite\\") and bride-to-be of Rock which is forbidden for his rank to be involved with such a woman. Godo and Rena are caught together and for his crime, Godo loses his citizenship and is sent to a labour camp in Iceland where energy from the Earth's mantle is being harnessed in a bid to solve the world's energy shortage (but is causing instability between the mantle and Earth's crust and serious long term harm to the planet therefore). While interned and heart- broken over losing Rena, Godo meets Doctor Saruta, a prison professor who wishes to tutor the young pilot, only to secretly plot with him a plan to escape and search for the Phoenix themselves to save the Earth. After a serious earthquake causes chaos and destruction in the facility, Godo is saved by Olga and Pincho (a pet creature of Rena that had helped Olga and found out where Godo had been taken), and they set of into space by stealing a \\"Space Shark\\" ship that Godo would have been given in his mission to capture the Phoenix. After stopping at a planet and meeting Saruta's hermit friend Ban, Godo and the crew of the ship track the Phoenix but find it impossibly powerful and it changes into many monstrous shapes and sizes, from dragons, tentacular leeches and even mimicking a small planet. After learning that Rena has married Rock, Godo had become stricken with misery and pushes away Olga's advances when she shows signs of love for Godo (and previously jealousy for Rena). With the crew all killed one-by-one by the Phoenix and the secret of its weakness lost in Saruta's last words, the Phoenix finally destroys Olga by burning her. Godo is broken and forgets the Phoenix as he cradles the blackened metal body of Olga, realizing how selfish he had been towards his life-long and devoted companion. The Phoenix tries to attack the ship but is repelled each time it gets close by the power of Godo's love and the giant vengeful form dissolves with the bird then appearing inside the ship in a more feminine, peacock-like form. Admiring the power of Godo's love of living creatures, the Phoenix, speaking to Godo through telepathy \\"speaking to his heart\\" admits he is too strong for her and offers to grant his wish of reviving Olga on the condition he gives her something she wants of him (not revealing that this is his love and that the Phoenix inhabits the body of the restored Olga to obtain this). After being reunited with Olga and given a paradisaical planet to live on, Godo still has feelings towards the dying Earth and sets out to return with vegetables and resources, only to be met with Rock (and a now content Rena) and is arrested. But what follows is a series of catastrophic earthquakes that level the whole world and bring about final destruction, Rena dying in the advent by trying to escape on Godo's ship and Rock blinded by a lava emission. Godo gives Rock his last rites and he and Olga stand together on a beach contemplating the impending death of the planet. Godo is so distraught that the Phoenix reveals itself to him through Olga and in an attempt to console him, says he can live forever if he drinks the Firebird's blood and wait the many centuries for the earth's eventual revival. Godo instead offers his life for the revival of the Earth. The Phoenix agrees, admiring Godo's selfless nature despite her own wish that he stay alive. After saying their fondest farewells, Godo collapses, dead into Olga's arms. Olga lays Godo's body on the shore and then lays down beside him, the Phoenix leaves her and the two lifeless forms then transform during the earth's revival - Godo becomes a newborn baby again and Olga becomes a beautiful human woman taking the baby in her arms as her son.

Release Phoenix 2772 was released in Japan on March 15, 1980 where it was distributed by Toho. An American version of the film was released by Toho International Co., Ltd. with English subtitles at its full running time in July 1982. The film was re-issued to home video as Space Firebird at a running time of 95 minutes by Celebrity Home Video and later re-released uncut by Best Film & Video Corp. Reception Variety referred to the film as a \\"well-drawn, imaginative Japanese sci-fi feature\\". The review stated that the film should have been shortened by about half an hour, with scenes involving musical interludes of the pets, certain chase sequences and the climactic cataclysm of Earth be shortened or cut out. The film's animation was as \\"modern and often day-glo colored, with some corners cut: static backgrounds, shake and shimmer characters in place of constant, fluid movement\\" and that \\"the firebird itself figuring prominently in action scenes during later reels, is disappointing in design and out-of-place in the futuristic world.\\" Phoenix 2772 was the Winner of the Inkpot Award at the 1980 San Diego Comic Convention and the Animation Award at the 1st Las Vegas Film Festival in 1980.

Roberts worked with Philip McMann and the Leadfoot Theatre, which led to voice-over roles for local radio spots and clients such as New York Sports Clubs, Playbill.com, Macklowe Properties and KBC Media. This, in turn, led to commercial work and regional theatre. After signing with a talent agency, Dave was cast as a recurring voice-over on the anime hit The Elan. While performing in Henry V in Toronto the summer of 1999, Roberts auditioned for an avant-garde local TV production called MasterStroke and was cast as its lead. The comic soap opera aired for only a short time on Ontario's Star Ray TV but gained acclaim for its star and its young director, Gil Ripley. The two like-minded artists became quick friends and began a writing partnership that led to their co-founding KanDu Productions the following year (2000). They also undertook editorship of The Festival Rag, a monthly online newsletter devoted to the independent film world and published by the entertainment portal Kemek. KanDu's TV comedy projects have ranged from sitcoms to full-length screenplays, as well as reality-based TV programming.

It is located close to Mqabba ≈ªurrieq and Siggiewi. Within its boundaries are two well-known Neolithic temples called Mnajdra and ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim. In this village two feasts are held annually. The feast of Our Lady of Lourdes is celebrated either on the last Sunday of June or on the first Sunday of July, with 15 August the titular feast of the Ascension of Our Lady. This feast is popularly known as the feast of Santa Maria. Although the majority of the village's old core buildings remain today, Qrendi has changed considerably in recent times. A bypass road has been built to divert through-traffic away from the village, modern suburb developments has been built and an open space with a bus terminus being created in front of the Parish Church by removing the walled grounds from an old villa. History Fossilized remains of animals dating back to the Quaternary Period have been found in the environs of Qrendi. The remains were found in caves and coastal deposits within the Magƒßlaq Fault or Wied tal- Magƒßlaq. The caves came to light in 1858, when the area began to be quarried for its hard coralline rock which was used to build the docks in the Grand Harbour. Studies were then taken up by Commander Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt in 1861, who excavated a site known as ƒ¶alq is-Siƒ°ar at Magƒßlaq and confirmed the presence of a variety of fossilised animal remains, including an abundance of hippopotami bones, evidence of dwarf elephants, giant dormice, weasels, owls, bats and birds, besides many other snail fossils. The discovery further yielded complete skeletons of elephants and a large number of bones pertaining to sea birds. In around 3600 BC, the temples of ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim and Mnajdra, which are among the oldest freestanding structures in the world, were built in what is now the outskirts of Qrendi. Other ancient sites such as tombs and dolmens have also been found in the limits of Qrendi. The first known documentation of Qrendi is in the militia list of 1417, when it was a small village of 26 households. During Hospitaller rule, various towers were built in or around Qrendi, while some knights built summer residences in the area. Qrendi became an independent parish in 1618. In the 19th century, while Malta was a British protectorate, Qrendi was ruled by a magistrate who was known as Luogotenente, and a garden was built in Qrendi for his personal use. During World War II, a small airstrip known as RAF Krendi was built roughly halfway between the village and Siƒ°ƒ°iewi. The airstrip consisted of two tarmac runways, and it saw use during the Allied Invasion of Sicily in 1943. The airstrip closed with the end of the war, and the runways have been converted into roads. A number of Qrendin civilians were killed during the war, and a memorial in their honour was inaugurated in 1995. The Qrendi Local Council was established by the Local Councils Act of 1993. Geography =il-Maqluba= Il-MaqlubaThe historical guide to the island of Malta and its dependencies. p. 73. il-Maqluba is a large sinkhole or doline that formed suddenly in 1343, that is associated with local creations legends. =Wied Magƒßlaq= One of the more well known valleys in Qrendi is Wied Magƒßlaq. It is about from the village and the same distance from the other valley within the locality of Qrendi, that is Wied i≈º-≈ªurrieq. =Wied i≈º-≈ªurrieq= The Wied i≈º-≈ªurrieq area is an important fishing hamlet in the region. Due to the environment and setting of this site, it has for a long time been a popular tourist and visitor attraction. The Wied iz-≈ªurrieq valley begins as Wied ƒ¶oxt which can be accessed from the panoramic road that runs from il-ƒ¶nejja or Blue Grotto to the temples of ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim and descends towards the sea ending in the Wied i≈º-≈ªurrieq mouth. The valley had been cut through time in the lower coralline limestone and the result is a ragged and bare rocky landscape. Continuing towards il-ƒ¶nejja or the Blue Grotto a rock feature has emerged which has been titled ƒ†ebla tiƒãƒãaqlaq (that is the moving rock). It consists of a rock hulk which looms to a height surpassing 15 metres and which is stuck firmly into the cliff face. It is said that this rock moves during violent stormy weather making strong sounds caused by these movements. Coastal caves - such as the Reflection Cave, Filfla Cave, Cats Cave, Rotunda Cave, Honey Moon Cave and Blue Window Cave - offer underwater views of marine fauna. =Coastline= To the north of the Wied iz-Zurrieq fishing hamlet one can find other sea caves and grottoes as found on its southern sea leading to the blue grotto. The Nuffield al-Kabir and Nuffied iz-Zghir coves, the capes of tal-Gawija, Rsejjen, Halq it-tafal, Ras nignuna, Maqluba l-bahar, Ghar mantel, and Ras Hamrija are among the Qrendi landmarks that attract visitors. Main sights =Megalithic and other ancient sites= ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim Fa√ßade of the main temple at ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim People were aware of the existence of the Neolithic temples of ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim since many centuries back, at least from the seventeenth century. The temples date to the around 3000 B.C. though they were not built in one instance and thus their different structures span hundreds of years between them. The temples are unusual in that they are sited on the crest of a ridge when most other temples were constructed on the slope below a hilltop. The presence of these large boulders placed in orderly fashion despite their size and weight ignited the fantasy of some and led them to interpret the site as the work of giants, following what others also believed that the island was inhabited by a race of giants who came here after the great Flood described in Genesis 2, believing that these were the descendants of Noah and who in Malta built structures such as ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim temples. The mystery of these big stones jutting out of the ground began to be unravelled in the nineteenth century when excavations started in 1839.by J.G. Vance of the Royal Engineers who was requested by Governor Sir Henry Bouverie to supervise the first dig. He also put forward his opinion on these ruins saying that: \\"I can compare it with no other remains that I have ever seen or read of: I consider it to be quite unique and dissimilar to any discovery hitherto treated of.\\" At the time practically nothing was known about those ruins and all Vance could do was conjecture about their origins and similarities to other temples and cultures. Professor of Prehistoric European Archaeology and Director of the Institute of Archaeology in the University of London in the mid-twentieth century, visited the site and observed: \\"I have been visiting the prehistoric ruins all round the Mediterranean, from Mesopotamia to Egypt, Greece and Switzerland, but I have nowhere seen a place as old as this one.\\" The ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim site is composed of a number of structures consisting of a central building, two smaller ones on the sides and the remaining parts of a third building. The main temple was presumably built in successive stages during the fourth millennium B.C. It thus developed into an irregular and complex ground plan. Its monumental fa√ßade has become a famous and iconic feature and faces the south-east. Of particular note are the large megaliths that shape the outer wall and which are pieced by an entrance in the middle formed of a trilithon structure, which, in turn, leads to a number of chambers. The temple complex has many other interesting features which make the adjacent museum and inside environment enticing to discover, that include stone altars, the mystic oracle hole, two stumps of legs possibly of ‚ÄòMother Goddess‚Äô figures, as well as the discovery of a small clay figurine depicting a woman after having given birth termed as, \\"The Venus of Malta\\", and a small floral engraved stone altar. Mnajdra Niche at the Mnajdra south temple On leaving the ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim complex, going in a western direction, one can walk down a modern-day paved path and 500 meters away comes face to face with the Mnajdra complex of temples. This site differs in some ways from the other temple just visited. Mnajdra is largely constructed from coralline limestone quarried from the area giving the temples a much more rugged, and rather bluish appearance, a result of this hard stone ‚Äì much different from the yellowish and much softer globigerina limestone predominant in the zone where ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim stands and of which it was built. The Mnajdra structures are sited towards the edge of the promontory facing Filfa ‚Äì the islet which pops out of the water a short distance away and separated from the mainland by the blue sea so predominant in this area, and is \\"probably the most atmospheric all the temples\\"; as it is tucked into a hollow of the cliffs and surrounded by the natural and marine environment. The temple complex is composed of three separate buildings, each of which can be entered from a common forecourt, and is an experience going round the temples and its various interior apses that form the different structures. Visitors are stricken with the neatness and regularity of the first course of orthostatic slabs which go round the apses of the middle temple, added to the precision one cannot but notice also the lower than usual size of this first course which barely reaches one meter in height. A unique feature is a small Bas relief engraving of the roofed fa√ßade of a temple which is featured on the largest upright slab to the left of the inner passage of this same temple, amongst other features such as a decorated niche, the ‚Äòoracle‚Äô holes in the lower temple, and a number of pillar altars in the two bigger temples. A particular aspect which is connected with these temples is their relationship with astronomy. It is strongly believed that the Neolithic temples were also oriented to follow the movements of the sun. The Summer Solstice and the Winter Solstice as well as the two equinoxes enter into and hit the two major Mnajdra temples indicating that the temple builders aligned the structures according to the ray of light from the sun reflected on these particular days of the year. ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim too has its own alignment which seems to be linked to the Summer Solstice. The Misqa Tanks The human activity in the area is complemented by a series of holes grouped together in a zone about 250 meters north of Mnajdra temples. The explanation for the presence of these cavities is not a straightforward conclusion, but seems plausible that they were dug there for the collection and maintaining of a secure reservoir of fresh water. Yet to date them is not easy as no datable deposits remain due to these tanks having been cleared many times along the years. These tanks are situated on the top of the Magƒßlaq plateau. Their name ‚Äì il-Misqa has been attributed to the watering place. The eight tanks are bell-shaped and have openings through which the water can be accessed, but share no regular shape. Most openings were closed with an intrigue formation of heavy stone interlocking slabs, whilst one has a round hole in the capping slab allowing water to be drawn through. The place where these tanks are dug was the only feasible place in the temples area and the structure of the rock in this area is arguably unique in that its constitution facilitates the formation of these reservoirs and assures a continuous supply of water in them by means of rain water collection culverts. Misraƒß is-Sinjura dolmen A further reminder of the early times when human beings roamed the area around Qrendi is a dolmen which is found in Misraƒß Sinjura or Misraƒß is-Sinjura from where it took its name. Dolmens are dated to the Bronze Age, that is, to around 2500-1500 B.C. or the Tarxien Cemetery phase. Dolmens are one of the most common megalithic structures found in many parts of the world, and consist of a stone slab placed horizontally over two or more upright stones, serving as a capstone. The Qrendi dolmen, which may have served as a burial chamber is described as having a capstone which is appreciably larger ‚Äì 4.4m by 3.8m ‚Äì supported on a four course irregular dry stone walling. A feature catching one's attention is a groove cut round its perimeter piercing the capping slab by a hole that may have served for religious rituals in the past. The dolmen at Misraƒß Sinjura is also known among the locals as il-ƒ¶aƒ°ra l-Imsaqqfa (the roofed stone). =Churches and chapels= Within the Qrendi countryside one can find the Maqluba doline, an enormous sinkhole that occurred during a storm in 1343. According to legend a small chapel existed at the time, which must make it one of the oldest surviving Christian buildings in Malta. There are seven other churches and chapels in the parish, most of them constructed on the site of earlier structures. The first parish was set up in 1436, when the village was within ≈ªurrieq's parish. Qrendi became a separate parish in 1618. The ornate baroque Parish Church, designed by Lorenzo Gaf√† the architect of Mdina Cathedral, was completed in 1720. Chapels in Qrendi include San Mattew tal-Maqluba, San Mattew i≈º-≈ªgƒßir, Madonna tal- ƒ¶niena, Madonna tal-Grazzja, Santa Katerina, Is-Salvatur. Parish church While Qrendi formed part of the parish of ≈ªurrieq, in 1575 its main church was dedicated to the Nativity of Our Lady. Sometime later, in the year 1594, it was however rebuilt by the people of the village and was rededicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. During second pastoral visit of Mgr Baldassare Cagliares, this Bishop declared Qrendi a separate parish, uniting to it the two small communities of ƒ¶al Lew and ƒ¶al Manin. This dismemberment took place on 15 February 1618 with the consent of Rev. Nicola Bonnici, the parish priest of ≈ªurrieq As many times happened, a few years after a parish was erected, the church identified to serve as the parish church became inadequate for the daily religious needs of the parishioners as these began to grow in number. This created the need for modification, enlargement or replacement of the original church, when, Rev. GioMaria Camilleri thought of building a new church. The site chosen was the land on which two small churches stood next to each other, one dedicated to the Assumption of Our Lady and the other to St Anthony. The work on the new parish church started in 1620, and with the contribution of the community the construction was concluded thirty-five years later, that is in 1655. While the church was still being built a pastoral visit took place. It was Mgr Balageur Camarasa who, following his consecration as Bishop of Malta in February 1636, visited Qrendi, and who then examined the parish church and its altars. The sacristy was already erected whilst he church had three doors and there seemed to be a plan to enlarge the building. The building of the parish church continued when in 1668 work started on the belfry known as ‚ÄòTal-Agunija‚Äô (Agony), which took eleven years to complete. Thus by 1679, and during the administration of the parish priest Rev. Marco Bellia, the parish church was ready and the parishioners could enjoy their new completed church. With the advent of Rev. Domenico Formosa, a native of Qrendi, the parish church was thus once again demolished so that a more spacious edifice could be built. The plan for the new church was the work of the highly experienced and able Lorenzo Gaf√†. other persons who fell under the authority of the Inquisitor, and the members of all the Religious Orders. Don Domenico appears to have been quite an inspiration to his parishioners, maybe also because they saw in him a native of their village and one from their community. His zeal moved the villagers to give their contribution to the construction of the church which began in 1685 and continued till 1691, stopping for a number of years and then resuming in 1695. According to Ferres, who was writing in the mid-nineteenth century, the sacrifices made by the Qrendin to build their church were without comparison in the history of the Maltese Church. One example of extreme sacrifice was the parish priest himself. According to Ferres it was on 17 January 1699 that Don Domenico wishing to encourage his parishioners to do more towards the construction of the church thought of lending a hand so as to lead by example. He thus grasped a stone, put it on his shoulder, and thus burdened climbed up a long ladder. On reaching the top, while Don Domenico was stepping on a plank of the scaffolding he tripped and fell to the ground dying on the spot ‚Äì a victim of his remarkable zeal. Work continued and the edifice was complete in 1712. The church is in the form of a Latin cross, following the general rule of church design found in the majority of churches in Malta. It thus comprises a choir, two transepts, a central nave and two sacristies. While the edifice was still under construction, parish priest Rev. Pietro Zerafa, who took over the administration of Qrendi in 1701, ordered the dismantling of part of the already built structure to enlarge the church. A later addition is the sacristy which stands to the left of the choir; this was added in the nineteenth century on the initiative of Rev. Dr Celestino Camilleri who managed to raise a good sum of money for its erection. The work was done in 1865. The Gaf√† church is 34.44 metres long; the nave is 7.01 metres wide while it measures 23.16 metres from transept to transept. It has ten altars, an elegant dome, and two belfries, one on each side of the fa√ßade. It was consecrated by Bishop Fra Vincenzo Labini on 13 October 1782 during the tenure of office of Rev. Antonio Mizzi ‚Äì a hard-working and highly loved parish priest. The works done by this priest comprise two out of the four bells that hung in the church's belfries. With the Gaf√† church in full function the parish priests who were appointed to administer the parish now saw to it to add necessary facilities and to embellish the parish church. Thus the parish priest Rev. Pietro Paolo Xuereb D.D. commissioned the artist Giuseppe Calleja to decorate the dome, the ceiling and the main pilasters of the church. In 1971, on the initiative of the parish priest Rev. Karm Attard, the ceiling and dome were redecorated. with episodes from the life of the Blessed virgin as commissioned to renowned artist Pawlu Camilleri Cauchi. From its establishment as a parish Qrendi's patron saint has been the Assumption of Our Lady. In the parish church there are three paintings depicting the Assumption. The current titular painting was commissioned in 1917 to the renowned artist Giuseppe Cal√¨ and replaced the one that hung on the main altar, the work of Rocco Buhagiar The Qrendi parish church has two sacristies. One of them, known as the sacristy of the priests, holds the old titular painting of the Assumption of the Madonna done by Rocco Buhagiar in the 18th century. A plaque on the wall commemorates the consecration of the church by Bishop Mgr Labini in 1782. There is also a small chapel adjacent to the sacristy, which also holds some interesting works of art. Among these is the first statue of the Immaculate Conception used for the Marian celebrations in Qrendi. The other sacristy, which is locally known as that of the confreres, holds a portrait of Rev. Celestino Camilleri who brought to Qrendi the remains of St Celestino and who also did the floor of the main altar in 1882. There is also a statue by Karlu Darmanin that represents St Philip Neri and which was in the past carried during the procession of Our Lady of Lourdes. Similar to other parish churches that have been long established, the church of Qrendi possesses a number of statues besides the titular. One such is that of Our Lady of Sorrows which was done by Wistin (Agostino) Camilleri and is a work in papier-m√¢ch√© of 1972. The statue of Our Lady of the Girdle (Consolation) is by Karlu Darmanin and is connected to its Confraternity. Darmanin also completed the statue of Our Lady of Lourdes in 1878, made of papier-m√¢ch√©, twenty years after the apparitions at Lourdes. The statue of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary is the work of Carmelo Mallia known as ‚ÄòIl-Lhudi‚Äô and is associated to the Confraternity of the Holy Rosary of Qrendi. The Qrendin felt the need to have a titular statue representing the Assumption. For this new statue they contracted the sculptor Antonio Chircop from Senglea. The statue depicted the Madonna in a pose in which the position of the arms was unique. The rich colours signify the human and the divine. It was completed in 1837. Chapel of Our Lady of Mercy The old chapel which stood on the same site of the present chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Mercy goes back to medieval times. Situated in the old casale of Leu (Leo or ƒ¶al Lew), the first chapel is thought to have originated in the thirteenth century. It also served as vice-parish when the Qrendi area still formed part of the parish of ≈ªurrieq. Though Mgr Pietro Dusina profaned this chapel when he visited ƒ¶al Lew in 1575, it seems that the building was rehabilitated as indicated from the pastoral visit of Bishop Cagliares of 1621. In a later pastoral visit, this time by Bishop Balaguer which took place in 1636, we get a better description of the medieval structure The present baroque chapel was built between 1650 and 1668, and is considered an architectural jewel. It is accredited to architect Mederico Blondel (active in Malta in the second half of the 17th century). The baroque touches are seen in all their strength in the main altar which is adorned with stone carvings. The titular painting which dates to the 17th century shows the Virgin of Mercy who is seated on the clouds and a moon while holding the child Christ who is standing on her knee. This piece of art was attributed to Giuseppe d‚ÄôArena, an Italian painter who was active in Malta and was connected to the circle of Mattia Preti. However Prof. Keith Sciberras more recently ascribed it to Filippino Dingli The style of the chapel followed the common Latin cross design of Christian churches. According to Ferres this sanctuary attracted so many devotees that it ranked second in the number of visits after that of Mellieha. The church was thought important enough to attract also a number of benefactors such as Bailiff Fra Philipp-Wolfgang Gutenberg who donated various paintings and other objects to this church The continuous flow of the faithful to this church, some of them tired after their long and strenuous journey, needed to be addressed. Thus a well was dug in the church parvis in 1670 so that the faithful could quench their thirst and give water to their beasts of burden when their arrived at the sanctuary. In the 19th century a puteal or wellhead was constructed and which still bears the date ‚Äò1873‚Äô. Two years after the completion of the well, in 1672, a portico was constructed so that the pilgrims could shelter from inclement weather and the heat of the sun. The contractor of this portico was the same procurator of the church, that is, Giovanni Schembri. Many came to this church to leave evidence of the graces received and this is testified by the ex-voto paintings which were hung here. In this church there were a number of paintings but two of these presented rather unusual subjects. One represented the seven mortal or cardinal sins ‚Äì wrath, avarice, sloth, pride, lust, envy and gluttony. This painter depicted a donkey burdened with a number of baskets filled with vices. Each basket had inscribed upon it the particular sin. The donkey symbolises Satan drawn in a very ugly form while on the left of the picture one notes a man in confession The other painting collects within it 14 saint protectors who were invoked in cases of disease and peril: St Blaise (throat diseases), St George (diseases of the skin), St Erasmus (diseases of the bowels), St Pantaleon (tuberculosis), St Vitus (St Vitus dance and poisonous bites), St Christopher (travel and storms) St Dionysius (possession by evil spirits), St Ciriacus (eye diseases), St Acacius (diseases of the head), St Eustachius (burns), St Giles (lunacy and the evil eye), St Margaret (kidney diseases and childbirth), St Barbara (lightning and sudden death), St Catherine (dying people) Chapel of St. Matthew Chapel of St. Matthew This chapel is linked to the landscape and the legend that is tied to it ‚Äì that is il-Maqluba. Strictly speaking there are two chapels dedicated to this same saint. One is very old and may be one of the first chapels erected after the Muslim domination of Malta. This chapel can be better described as a crypt, has a window that gives onto the land depression of il-Maqluba. The newer San Mattew church was initiated in 1674 and was completed in 1682. It was blessed by the Qrendi parish priest Rev. Domenico Formosa. The church is quite spacious and has a single altar. The titular painting done in 1688 by a member of the school or a follower of Mattia Preti and which is today attributed to Giuseppe d‚ÄôArena who had close connections to Preti, represents the martyrdom of St Matthew and had been commissioned by the French Knight Commendatore Nicol√≤ Communette St Matthew fell victim to the Axis bombing during World War Two when on 12 April 1942 it had its fa√ßade and other parts blown out. After the war it was reconstructed on a new design. The new fa√ßade has two belfries instead of the original single bellcote. Chapel of Our Saviour The first chapel on this site goes back many centuries. In his report, Mgr Dusina described the early chapel as having one altar but was very bare, with no income and hence no rector. It was then in 1658 that a new chapel on the same site was erected at the expense of Beneditto Camilleri. A benefactor of this second chapel was Rev. ƒ†alanton Camilleri who left a good amount of money for the celebration of Mass and the singing of vespers on the feast day. Chapel of St. Catherine tat-Torba This chapel is commonly known as ‚ÄòTat-Torba‚Äô, is sited on the outskirts of the village and was commonly known as ‚ÄòTa‚Äô bieb ta≈º-≈ªejtunija‚Äô ‚Äì due to the connection of St Catherine with Zejtun. Mgr Dusina visited the original chapel during his 1575 visit. Some years later it was deconsecrated and instead of the chapel a stone cross was erected in 1624. Benedittu Camilleri decided to build a second chapel with the same dedication some distance away in 1626. Camilleri also left beneficiaries in favour of this chapel known as ‚Äòta‚Äô Wied il-ƒ¶ofra‚Äô Chapel of St. Anne A votive chapel built in thanksgiving for safe deliverance from the Turkish siege of Malta of 1565. The original chapel dedicated to the Nativity of Our Lady was built by Giovanni Schembri to fulfil his vow as also documented in the acts of Notary Giuliano Briffa of 7 September 1565. The present chapel exhibits three windows in the fa√ßade, inside there is a main altar dedicated to St Anne which is flanked by two small side altars. The prospective that surrounds the titular painting is finely decorated. At the top of the altar is a representation of the Holy Ghost. The interior also exhibits a number of ex-voto silver icons representing the ‚Äònewly born‚Äô and various ‚Äòillness‚Äô symbols indicating that this chapel was devotionally sought by those in need. Chapel of Our Lady of Grace This chapel was first dedicated to Our Lady of Victory, and was built by Angelo Spiteri from Qrendi in 1658. Spiteri left funds which were to be used for the singing of vespers and the celebration of Mass on the feast day The present chapel has a simple fa√ßade with no decoration except for three square windows ‚Äì one on each side of the door and the third one high up above it. On the very top of the church there is a small stone crucifix. The two side windows have a kneeling block for the faithful who wished to pray even when the chapel was closed. The inside is void of decoration and has only one altar. =Towers= Cavalier Tower The village of Qrendi was prone to attacks from the sea, and raids by the Ottomans or Barbary corsairs were common up to the early 17th century. Due to this, several towers were built in or around Qrendi: *Cavalier Tower ‚Äì This was built either in the 16th or 17th centuries by the Order of St. John, or earlier on in the medieval period. The tower is octagonal and is unique in the Maltese islands. *Sciuta Tower ‚Äì This was built in 1638, and is one of the Lascaris towers. Its design served as the prototype for the later De Redin towers. The tower was used for military purposes until World War II, and was later converted into a police station. Plans are now being made to restore the tower. *ƒ¶amrija Tower ‚Äì This was built in 1659, and is one of 13 De Redin towers around Malta's coastline. It is situated in the vicinity of the prehistoric temples of ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim and Mnajdra. =Other notable buildings and structures= Guttenberg Palace One prominent member of the Order of St John who chose Qrendi for one of his places of retreat was Fra Philipp-Wolfgang von Guttenberg Guttenberg's fortified house was built in the ƒ¶al Lew area and is sited on the left-hand side of the street as one enters the square in front of the sanctuary dedicated to Our Lady of Mercy. Guttenberg was aware that Qrendi was rather exposed and could easily be attacked by an invading force of corsairs at any time. For this reason he made sure that his palatial house could also be defended if the need arose. The building thus included features which helped its residents to defend themselves such as the drop boxes through which objects and harmful liquids could be dropped on attackers who were close to the walls of the house. Guarena Palace Guarena Palace The defensive dwelling was formerly owned by the Bailiff Fra Pietro Francesco Rovero De Guarena and is situated on the road leading to the temples of ƒ¶agar Qim after passing the small chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Graces. The architecture is rather austere as it misses any elaborate decoration. Not meant as a status of beauty and wealth but rather to serve as a residence offering a measure of protection and defence from any eventual attack from unexpected sea raiders in the Qrendi area. The defensive structure is easily detected from the windows placed high in the walls of the ground floor while the turret on the roof served as a lookout post. The land which Guarena purchased in the mid-eighteenth century was indicated as ‚Äòkontrada tal-Grazzja‚Äô. Besides the house, this Piedmontese knight born in 1679, also included a garden in which he planted ornamental and fruit trees. Guarena, admitted into the Order of St John in 1688 while still a minor, had a successful career holding many high offices. He was an important benefactor who partially financed the silver screen that was put up to enclose what today is the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament in St John's Co-Cathedral and which during Guarena's time was dedicated to Our Lady of Philermos in the Order's Conventual Church. Santa Katerina Windmill Located on the outskirts of Qrendi the Santa Katerina windmill can trace its origins to the period of the Knights of St John. In 1683 Mikiel di Giovanni who at that time rented all the windmills that had been built by the Fondazione Cotoner, petitioned the government to build another three windmills, one each for Qrendi, Mqabba and Rabat. In his request he pointed out that the residents of these localities had asked for a windmill to be built to serve their needs. This plea was granted and the Qrendi windmill was built in 1686. For the first five years it was rented to the same di Giovanni alternating with Domenico Grixti of ≈ªurrieq, ƒ†u≈ºeppi Caruana of Luqa and Mikiel Micallef of Lija. The windmill of Qrendi did not cease its operation as a grain mill with the termination of the Order's rule in Malta, as it still had more than a century of grinding to perform ƒ†nien tal-Kmand In the first decade of British rule while Sir Alexander Ball was Civil Commissioner (1802-1809), it was decided to erect a number of gardens around Malta named ƒ†nien tal-Kmand, whose original aim was to increase the greenery of the islands but the same gardens became also experimental agricultural centres. In them a number of new crops and agricultural practices were tested but it seems that little benefit was eventually extracted except for the potato crop which would in later years become an important export product and a popular food item in the Maltese kitchen and also very much associated with Qrendi. The garden had a variety of trees divided namely into fruit and citrus trees. Including mulberry trees (ƒãawsli), plum trees (gƒßajnbaqar), apricot tree (berquqa), almond tree (lew≈ºa), pear trees (lanƒ°as), vines (dwieli), fig trees (tin), prickly pears (bajtar tax-xewk), pomegranate trees (rummien), apple trees (tuffieƒß ta‚Äô Belludja), peach trees (ƒßawƒß), and quince trees (sfarƒ°el). The citrus family was represented by orange trees (larinƒ°), lemon trees (lumi), tangerine trees (mandolin), and sweet lime trees (lumiƒãell). The abundance of trees and fruit in this garden showed how fertile and productive it must have been. The Qrendi ƒ†nien tal-Kmand as were the others around Malta, was put at the disposition of the village luogotenente or Mayor for his use and enjoyment. Congreve Memorial A memorial to Sir Walter Norris Congreve is located on the coastline, close to ƒ¶amrija Tower and Mnajdra. Congreve was British officer who was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1899 for his gallantry during the Second Boer War, and he later served as Governor of Malta from 1924 to 1927. He died in Malta, and was buried at sea in the channel between Filfla and Malta. The memorial was built nearby in his honour. Qrendi cemetery In all the parishes of Malta and Gozo, in the past the dead were buried in the church, its crypt or in cemeteries very close to a church or chapel. With time the practice of burying in the precincts of a church began to give way to that of interring the dead in cemeteries As the adverse conditions created by the graves were causing so much discomfort, it was thought that the time had come to build a cemetery in line with what many other parishes had done already. Obtaining the permission of both the Church and the State, called on the Qrendin to give their voluntary work towards the creation of this cemetery. The cemetery was completed and as from the beginning of 1953 no more burials were carried out in the parish church. Tal-Ars Cemetery Situated on the Qrendi periphery, exactly on Mqabba to ≈ªurrieq road, one comes across the second cemetery in Qrendi, better known at the \\"tal-Ars\\" cemetery. The exact date of the construction of the cemetery is unknown but graffiti on one of its wall reads 1830. With the cemetery built to receive the dearly departed who had died from infectious diseases within the Qrendi and Mqabba communities. The earliest Qrendi recorded burial at the Tal-Ghars Cemetery is that of Heinnyma Bugeja in 1877 aged 3 years, whilst the most recent is that of M‚ÄôConcetta Bugeja in 1948 aged 42 years. The youngest of the one hundred and forty four Qrendi Arecorded burials is that of Carmel Debono in 1882 recorded as a Baby presumably dying at birth, and that of Alphridus Briffa in 1940 aged one month, whilst the oldest burial is that of M‚ÄôAnna Dimech in 1940 aged 85 years. Economy Agriculture was an important part of Qrendi's economy Until the 20th century, most of the people in Qrendi worked as farmers or fishermen, or in the limestone quarries around the village. Limestone quarries are still an important part of Qrendi's economy, since limestone is one of Malta's few natural resources. Limestone has been used for the construction of houses and other buildings for centuries, and it was also used to build rubble walls in fields. The quarries around Qrendi employed both Qrendin as well as people from nearby villages, and the rocks were cut either manually using simple tools, or by using gunpowder. Education Since the introduction of the Colleges system, the Qrendi Primary School has formed part of St. Benedict's College. The college also includes the primary schools of Bir≈ºebbuƒ°a, Gƒßaxaq, Gudja, Kirkop, Mqabba, Safi and ≈ªurrieq. Since 1992, Qrendi also hosted the Helen Keller Resource Centre, an education centre catering for students aged between 12 and 22 who have particular impairments. Culture =Feasts= Qrendi celebrates two traditional festas. The feast of the Assumption of Mary is celebrated on 15 August, while the feast of Our Lady of Lourdes is celebrated on the first week in July. Both feasts are popular due to the religious manifestations, band marches, and firework displays. =Band Clubs= There are two band clubs in Qrendi: the Saint Mary's Band and the Lourdes Band. They play during village's feast period, as well as prepare the fireworks, elaborate decorations and entertainment for the festivities, and play a central role in Qrendi's society and culture. =Firework factories= Three fireworks factories could be found in Qrendi. Two of these factories are properties of the local band clubs, Lourdes Fireworks Factory and St. Mary's Fireworks Factory. Both factories produce their annual displays in July and August respectively during the feasts of Our Lady of Lourdes and the Assumption of St. Mary. These displays are well known by Maltese and foreign fireworks enthusiasts and are done on a voluntary basis. The third factory, the Independent Fireworks Factory, is a commercial fireworks factory. Both Lourdes Fireworks Factory and St. Mary's Fireworks Factory have participated and won local fireworks festivals. In 2011, Lourdes Fireworks Factory were the winners of the Malta Fireworks Festival. In 2015, Lourdes Fireworks Factory were declared winners of both the Malta Fireworks Festival and the Malta International Fireworks Festival. Also in 2015, St. Mary's Fireworks Factory won the Mechanised Ground Fireworks Festival. Accidents Both factories has been involved in a number of accidents during its existence, which has cost the lives of five people. During the 1950s, an explosion at the Lourdes Fireworks Factory killed one worker and injured another, which caused the buildings to close. It was eventually reopened in another building on 11 November 1976. Albert Bondin, injured in a fireworks incident while manufacturing fireworks on 12 October 2005, died in hospital on 21 October 2005 due to the serious injuries that he suffered. On 22 May 1972, an explosion at Saint Mary's Fireworks Factory occurred which killed local villager John Falzon. This prompted plans and preparations for a new, more modern factory to be built, which began in September that year. On 10 February 1974, another terrible accident occurred when Emanuel Aquilina, Martin Mallia and Jack Bugeja lost their lives whilst manufacturing some fireworks. In the midst of this latest disaster for the Society the joy of Qrendi's firework production turned became monotonous and emotional. On 7 July 2012, Joseph Mifsud succumbed to injuries after he suffered burns in an accident on 29 May 2012. =Other groups or associations= The Qrendi Scout Group was first founded in 1932, but it became dormant in 1956 and it was formally disbanded in 1965. The group was reestablished in 1995, and its members now participate in local, national and international events. The Society of Christian Doctrine teaches Christian doctrine to children after schooling hours, at the MUSEUM religious centre as well as in the Pastoral Centre. Notable people *Julia Farrugia Portelli, politician and Minister for Tourism and Consumer Protection *Hooligan, rapper and hip-hop pioneer Sports Qrendi has various sports clubs: *Qrendi Boƒãƒãi Club ‚Äì The traditional bowls () is practiced in Qrendi on sandy pitches, and where the club currently plays in the National third division. *Qrendi Football Club ‚Äì This club was formed in 1952, and it participates in the National; third division football league, and has a senior side and football nursery.

It rises near Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire in the Cotswold Hills and flows south-east passing near Stow-on-the-Wold, Charlbury, Bladon, and Cassington, and its valley provides the route of the southern part of the Cotswold Line. The river flows for from source to the River Thames. The name Evenlode is a modern-day name; up until the late 1890s the river was called the River Blade, which lent itself to the naming of Bladon, even though Bladon is on the River Glyme. The River Evenlode passes through many villages and towns in Oxfordshire including Ascott-under-Wychwood, Chadlington and Charlbury. The river joins the Thames approximately one mile down river from Cassington on the reach above King's Lock 3 miles (5 km) north-west of Oxford. Between Cassington and Eynsham, the Cassington Canal is fed by the river and joins the Thames upstream of the Evenlode. The river is largely privately owned, used for fishing and other leisure activities. The Environment Agency has undertaken restoration work, as of 2008, to recover from the effects of excessive dredging. Powered craft are not allowed on the river.

The road is around in circumference. Technically, the route is listed as an \\"Inner Ring Road\\", although only a tiny section of the \\"Outer Ring Road\\" was ever constructed, while only one of the two designed carriageways exist. It is divided into seven sections, between seven junctions with nearly all of the main routes into the city. The seven sections are all named after saints (e.g. \\"Ring Road St John's\\"). Originally the names chosen referred to nearby churches; however, with one section still to be built, it was noticed that St George, St Andrew and St Patrick (the patron saints of England, Scotland and Ireland respectively) were included, but St David (of Wales) was not. Thus the final section was named after St David, but not for any local reason. At the time there was a call for it to be named St. James after the church and square which once occupied the site. Clockwise from the south-west corner, the sections are as follows: * Ring Road St Mark's (between the A449 Penn Road and A41 Chapel Ash); * Ring Road St Andrew's (between the A41 and Waterloo Road); * Ring Road St Peter's (between Waterloo Road and the A449 Stafford Street); * Ring Road St Patrick's (between the A449 and A4124 Wednesfield Road); * Ring Road St David's (between the A4124 and A454 Middle Cross/A41 Bilston Street); * Ring Road St George's (between the A454/A41 and A4123 Birmingham Road/Dudley Road; * Ring Road St John's (between the A4123 and A449). Three main roads into the city do not meet the Ring Road, these being the A454 Compton Road from the west, the A459 from the south and the A460 Cannock Road from the north-east; they meet the A41, A4123 and A449 respectively slightly further away from the Ring Road, but within in each case. The A459 use to meet the Ring Road at the junction of Dudley Road and Snow Hill but following the introduction of the A4123 gyratory system as part of the construction of the St. George's section of the Ring Road, it has terminated at Grove Street although some maps still show it as continuing to the Ring Road. The Ring Road was constructed in stages between 1960 and 1986. The St John's and St Mark's sections were the first to be built in the 1960s. The St David's section to was the final section to be completed, and passes under a bridge connecting the east of the city centre to Wolverhampton railway station. It was built as a dual carriageway with very wide central reservations to allow for future grade separation of the junctions, which has never happened. As a result, most of the road has a very green appearance, except for Ring Road St Mark's which has a car park in the centre, reached by an underpass from the city centre. The St. George's Roundabout has a wishbone bridge running through it which carries the Metro light rail line from the City Centre to Bilston Road. Ring Road St. David's has a contraflow bus lane allowing access to the rebuilt bus station which is part of the Interchange project. It officially carries the designation A4150, although this does not appear on any signs with the exception of at the junction of Waterloo Road and Jack Hayward Way, near to Molineux stadium, and not on the Ring Road itself. The southern section of the ring road was home to Josef Stawinoga, a Polish immigrant known locally as \\"Fred the Tramp\\". He set up home in a tent on the ring road's central reservation soon after it opened in the 1960s, and lived there until his death in October 2007 at the age of 86. When Ring Road St. David's was built, a bridge over the Ring Road provided the only road route to the railway station. As part of the rebuilding of Wolverhampton Railway Station, a new road access and taxi rank was built off Sun Street with the existing bridge set to be used by the Midland Metro extension.

It is the third sequel for Galaxian (following Galaga, and Gaplus). It features significantly improved graphics over the previous games in the series, including detailed backgrounds, larger enemies and greater ship details. The game runs on Namco System 1 hardware. Galaga '88 was not as commercially successful as its predecessors, but was greatly praised for its gameplay, graphics, and music. Reviewers complemented its new enhancements that changed and innovated the core gameplay, and for standing out among other games at the time. It has been ported to many home consoles, such as the TurboGrafx-16, and is included in many Namco compilations. It was followed by Galaxian3: Project Dragoon in 1990. Gameplay Arcade version screenshot Galaga '88 is a fixed shooter video game. Its plot involves the launch of a starship named the Blast Fighter to destroy the hostile Galaga forces and their home planet. Its gameplay is similar to its predecessors; as the Blast Fighter, the player must shoot each of the Galaga aliens, who fly into formation from the top and sides of the playfield. Aliens will make an attempt to hit the player by divebombing towards the bottom of the screen. Colliding with an alien or their projectile results in a life being lost. Atop each formation are four larger enemies known as the Boss Galaga, which take two hits to destroy. These aliens use a tractor beam to capture a player's ship, returning with it to the top of the screen. The player can reclaim the captured fighter by shooting a Boss Galaga holding one while it is divebombing. If they are successful, the captured fighter joins with the player's own to create a dual fighter that has additional firepower and a larger hitbox. A Boss Galaga can also capture a dual fighter; rescuing it in the same fashion instead creates a triple fighter, an even larger ship with wide, fast-moving shots. A triple fighter can also be acquired by finding pink-colored capsules. Galaga '88 uses a branching, non-linear level progression system, featuring five different worlds divided into five levels each. Every fourth level is a bonus stage (indicated by the text \\"That's Galactic Dancin'\\"), where enemies fly in a pre- set path without firing at the player. The fifth level is a vertical-scrolling stage where the player face off against several different alien formations before confronting an end-level boss. Destroying large enemies or obstacles such as icebergs rewards the player with a blue capsule; collecting two of these warps them to a new, more challenging level. The game features four different endings, each based on the player's performance. Development =Music= The soundtrack for Galaga 88 was composed by Hiroyuki Kawada, a former game designer that created music for games such as Solvalou, Yokai Dochuki, and Valkyrie no Densetsu. Kawada expressed his admiration for its gameplay, and wanted the music and sound effects to convey a sense of entertainment instead of stoicism. For the Galactic Dancin stages, he created music that tapped into a wide variety of genres, like orchestra, tango, salsa, and big band jazz. Kawada based the idea off his \\"eclectic\\" taste in music, and wanted the soundtrack in Galaga 88 to reflect this. The music was created before the stages themselves were programmed; Kawada composed the tracks while the programmers choreographed the enemy movement to his music. Since Galaga 88 utilized the System 1 hardware, Kawada was able to experiment with the board's sound channels: \\"I loved bringing together the richness of the timbres in FM synthesis, the wave table synthesis that played a crucial role in the Namco sound, and the PCM synthesis that was indispensable for those low resolution real sound effects. When they were all combined and their distinctive colors were used to the fullest, it was possible to create a wealth of musical variety to complement the classic traditional sounds of the Galaga series.\\" Release A prototype of Galaga 88 was demonstrated at the Japan Amusement Machine (JAMMA) trade show in October 1987, presented alongside Pac-Mania and Assault. Namco released the game in Japan in December 1987. The game was released in April 1988 in North America, where it was published by Atari Games as part of its licensing agreement with Namco America. A home conversion of Galaga 88 was released for the PC Engine in Japan on July 5, 1988. It was published by NEC for the console's North American counterpart, the TurboGrafx-16, a year later under the name Galaga 90. Dempa released a version of Galaga 88 for the Sharp X68000 computer the same year. In addition to including a port of the original arcade game, the X68000 version features an additional gamemode that replaces the Galaga aliens with characters from other classic Namco video games ‚Äì this version has been retroactively named Galaga 88 Arrangement. In 2007, Namco Bandai Games digitally re-released the TurboGrafx version through the Wii Virtual Console, followed by the arcade version in Japan in 2009. Two Japanese mobile phone ports were produced; the first was for i-Mode in 2007 and the second for EZweb in 2008. The PC Engine version was re-released for the PlayStation Network in Japan in 2011 under the Game Archives series. Galaga 88 is included in the arcade compilations Namco Museum 50th Anniversary (2005), Namco Museum Virtual Arcade (2008), and Namco Museum Switch (2017). The 2011 iOS compilation Galaga 30th Collection includes remakes of 88 and its three arcade predecessors, utilizing enhanced visuals and audio, achievements, and support for Game Center. 88 is also featured in the arcade games Pac-Man‚Äôs Arcade Party (2010) and Pac-Man‚Äôs Pixel Bash (2019). The TurboGrafx-16 version is one of the included titles in the TurboGrafx-16 Mini by Konami. Reception Galaga '88 proved successful in Japan, remaining in the top earning charts throughout most of the year. The game's simplicity and additions to the gameplay of its predecessors are cited as the reasons for its success and appeal in the country. It was largely unsuccessful in North America by comparison, having only sold a combined 986 arcade units and boards by the end of the year. The game was well received by critics. Computer + Video Games liked its cute visuals and new additions to the core Galaga gameplay, while The Games Machine applauded its addictiveness, soundtrack and replay value. Your Sinclair labeled it \\"one of the most enjoyable machines on offer this month\\". Advanced Computer Entertainment was more negative towards the game for being \\"nothing more than a prettified version of the original\\", although they praised its colorful, detailed visuals and soundtrack. Gamest magazine awarded it the 28th \\"Annual Hit Game\\" award in 1998 based on reader vote, citing that its addictive nature, colorful visuals and catchy music made Galaga '88 stand out among other games at the time. In a 1998 retrospective review, Allgame was positive towards the game's graphics, branching level paths and overall improvements made over its predecessor. They also found the TurboGrafx-16 conversion to be a \\"killer port\\" for keeping the spirit of the original, going on to call it the best shooter released for the system. Reviewing the Wii Virtual Console digital re-release of the TurboGrafx port, Eurogamer found it to be a \\"pitch perfect dose of frenetic arcade blasting\\" for its triple fighter mechanic and branching stages, saying that it sets a good example for how to successfully remake a classic arcade game.

This version dates from around 1582. The earliest version, written in Central German, is dated 1532‚Äì1535 and is part of the Kupferstichkabinett Berlin collection at the State Museums in Berlin. It is illuminated on vellum, with decorative borders like a book of hours, meticulously painted and highlighted with gold. The later copies in London, Kassel, Paris and Nuremberg are equally fine. Twenty versions exist worldwide. The original of Splendor Solis, which contained seven chapters, appeared in Augsburg. In miniatures the works of Albrecht D√ºrer, Hans Holbein and Lucas Cranach were used. The author of the manuscript was considered to be the legendary Salomon Trismosin, allegedly the teacher of Paracelsus, though the name is believed to be a pseudonym. The work consists of a sequence of 22 elaborate images, set in ornamental borders and niches. The symbolic process shows the classical alchemical death and rebirth of the king, and incorporates a series of seven flasks, each associated with one of the then-known planets. Within the flasks a process is shown involving the transformation of bird and animal symbols into the Queen and King, the white and the red tincture. Although the style of the Splendor Solis illuminations suggest an earlier date, they are clearly of the 16th century.

The eponymous Willie Dynamite is a pimp in New York City, who strives to be number one in the city. As he is trying to do so, a social worker named Cora, is trying to change his ways - as well as those of the women who work for him - for the better. It was the first film produced by the Zanuck-Brown Company. Plot Willie Dynamite appears as the film's opening credits begin, with Martha Reeves singing the title song, 'Willie Dynamite.' Willie is driving his 'pimped-out' purple Cadillac on the streets of midtown Manhattan. The front license plate reading the first part of his nickname - 'Willie,' and the back license plate reading the second part - 'Dynamite.' Willie's destination is a midtown hotel, to collect payment from his women - who work the midtown hotels, attracting the many businessmen, conventioneers, who are looking for sex. Willie's 'stable' of seven women are of all ethnicities, dressed in vibrant outfits. Their entrance into the Business International Association convention - by entering as an ensemble through the hotel's main doors in-sync with the title song's description of them - has all the men in the room ogling them. Many conventioneers - including even a pair of police officers - take the women to their hotel rooms. Pashen is the newest hooker working for Willie, and she is last in line to hand in her payments. Willie gets mad at her for producing less than expected. Willie compares his business with those of a production line: \\"Seven girls out there. Every ten minutes, one comes off the production line, like that. This is a business, baby, a production line, and just like GM, Ford, Chrysler, Willie's comin' through.\\" Willie tells of his dreams of being the number one, top-pimp in New York City. Bell, currently the number one pimp, holds a 'pimp council,' and tells the gathered pimps of the police cracking down on prostitution activities across the city. Bell makes a business proposal, wherein each pimp will get his own area to run, instead of the pimps competing for territory. Everyone agrees, except Willie. He argues the idea would hurt his business. Willie says his women are akin to 'animals of the jungle,' having the need to 'roam free,' and 'conquer all that can be controlled.' Soon after the meeting ends, Willie learns Pashen has been arrested. Cora is a social worker, who tries to get the prostitutes in jail, to get out of the business, and turn their lives around. Cora meets Pashen, and tries to educate her on the dangers of being a prostitute. Cora encourages Pashen to change her life, and, as she's so young and pretty, to become a model and get paid for it. Being na√Øve, Pashen dismisses the idea, believing she can make more money as a hooker for Willie. Willie comes to post bail and gets Pashen out of jail. While Willie is out of his apartment, Cora makes an unexpected visit, and tells the women they are being ripped off by Willie. They ponder what Cora said as she leaves the apartment. When Willie comes back, he learns Pashen has been arrested again and the other women are reluctant to work. Willie threatens them if they decide to not work. Cora visits the jail and tries again to persuade Pashen to get out of prostitution. Pashen still insists prostitution - and being part of Willie's 'stable' - is okay, as she's making a lot of money, and she likes the men's attention while working, because she feels like someone 'important,' wanted & beautiful. Cora tells Pashen that she, too, was once a prostitute, on the streets. Cora sneaks into Willie's apartment to find records of Willie's bank accounts, which could provide evidence of his illegal activity, but, the materials she takes would not be able to stand up in court. After this second arrest, Pashen finally decides to take Cora's advice about pursuing modeling, and does a photo-shoot for which she gets paid. She tries to tell Willie she wants out, but, he tells her of his dreams and hopes for her (and for himself), which she's not able to refuse. Willie goes to the hotel convention, and finds his territory has been invaded and his lead hooker, Honey, has been killed after a territorial battle. Willie's life is spiraling downward, as he finds all his bank accounts have been frozen, and he's under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service. Two detectives chase Willie through New York. Willie's seven hookers are arrested after the hotel fight, but Willie can't post bail, and the women are sent to the women's detention center for holding. While in the detention center, Pashen's face gets cut, and she's traumatized by her loss of beauty. When Willie returns home, he is met by Bell and his men, who tells Willie to quit the business, and a fight ensues. Later, Willie is caught by the same two detectives, for possession of drugs. They have to free Willie, as the evidence obtained was done so without a warrant. In the end, Willie thinks back on past events, and after hearing news of his mother's dying, leaves his car - and by inference, pimping - for good. The film ends with Willie walking happily down the streets. Cast * Roscoe Orman as William Andrew \\"Willie Dynamite\\" Short, an ambitious pimp in New York City wanting to become the top, always shown with a vibrant sense of fashion * Diana Sands as Cora, a social worker who was once a prostitute on the streets, trying to reform Willie Dynamite in his ways * Thalmus Rasulala as Daniels, Cora's lover who is a district attorney, also fighting to put Willie Dynamite in jail * Joyce Walker as Pashen, the newest prostitute of Willie, who strives to make good money after being rescued from Willie * Norma Donaldson as Honey, Willie's head hooker, whose job is to make sure the other hookers are working, and dies after a fight with hookers from another pimp * Roger Robinson as Bell, the top pimp of New York, fighting with Willie and his hookers to maintain control of his top status * Albert Hall as Pointer, the black detective chasing Willie, an orthodox man * George Murdock as Celli, the white detective who would do anything for a shortcut and to get paid Production Willie Dynamite is always shown with a bright colored outfit, stereotypical outfit for the pimp. He is always wearing a hat that matches the rest of his outfit. He is first seen wearing a bright candy red suit with a white-striped red jacket and matching white-striped red hat. The second outfit that he is seen in is a clover green suit with a red scarf. With this, he is also wearing a large fur coat and hat. When he is detained by the police for the first time, he is wearing a white fur-striped brown lamb coat, which he loudly announces, \\"Brown coat? This is lamb! I paid over a grand for it!\\" after he is under suspicion for armed robbery for wearing a \\"brown coat.\\" The next outfit he is dressed in is shiny and gold. Blaxploitation theme The film produces many of the qualities seen in blaxploitation films, popular in the 1970s.McCann, Bob. Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland &, 2010. Print. Blaxploitation films would present a black character, usually shown in the ghetto, characterized by poverty, drugs, and violence. These black characters would be seen pitted against white characters of power, usually the police, as seen in this film. In one scene, Willie is aggressively detained by the police while driving. The charge is suspicion of armed robbery, fitting a description of wearing a brown coat. Willie is shouting that he is unlawfully charged and that it's unconstitutional, while the police are laughing about the detainment. This is an example of blaxploitation where white police are committing corrupt acts against black people.Reid, Mark. Black Lenses, Black Voices: African American Film Now. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2005. Print. Willie is later let go after the police lineup proves his innocence. As he exits the station, a police officer tells Willie that his car was parked, by the police from the detainment, in a tow-away zone. With trouble as it is, he then finds two detectives unlawfully searching his car without a warrant. They tell him a black female overdosed and believed it was Willie's fault. The black detective tells Willie he should care, \\"Yeah Willie, she's my sister. She's your sister too.\\" When the two detectives are chasing Willie Dynamite through New York City, the white detective is seen on a rooftop telling the black detective what to do. This is a reflection of the 1970s, where white men had higher power in society, as blacks were a minority. The two detectives represent the blaxploitation images in film, the black detective as a hard working man going by the books, and the white detective looking anywhere for a shortcut. In another scene, the two detectives are talking to each other before their performance review on the police force. Celli, the white detective, reads the newspaper and tells Pointer that he may have to leave the force for his religion. Celli complains that Pointer is too orthodox in his ways, another example of white police looking for a shortcut to make money. Inside the courtroom, when Willie is detained for possession, he announces that the police have obtained evidence without a warrant. This is a recurring example in blaxploitation films, where corrupt police use unorthodox ways to catch black criminals. However, the film has an unusually low body count for a blaxploitation film: a mere two, and one of them is an elderly woman who succumbs to a heart attack. This might be cited as an example of the filmmakers' desire to position it as a more serious example of the genre, the idea being that life has more value than is generally displayed in such films. Additionally, the idea of a Black Muslim cop lecturing Willie about what he is doing to \\"our people\\" was another unique touch. Release Willie Dynamite premiered at the Woods Theatre in Chicago on December 19, 1973 and grossed $54,585 in its first week. It was released in New York City on January 24, 1974 and Los Angeles on March 27, 1974. =Home media= The film was released on DVD on January 11, 2005.

It's located south of Whitehaven and on the River Ehen. Historically in Cumberland, the town, which lies at the foot of Uldale Valley and Dent Fell, has a long industrial heritage including dyeing, weaving and iron ore mining. It had a population of 7,444 in 2001,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Copeland Retrieved 2 June 2010 increasing to 8,194 at the 2011 Census. The town's layout today is much the same as at the time of Richard de Lucy around 1200 with its wide Main Street opening out into the market place. The remains of the Norman castle, built in the 12th century, are situated at the southern end of Main Street near the market place. Egremont was granted a charter for a market and annual fair by King Henry III in 1266.British History Online; Magna Britannia vol 4 The resulting annual Crab Fair now hosts the World Gurning Championships.World Gurning Contest on whitehaven.org The modern economy is based around the nuclear industry at Sellafield. Governance Egremont is within the Copeland UK Parliamentary constituency. Trudy Harrison is the Member of parliament. Before Brexit, it was in the North West England European Parliamentary Constituency. For Local Government purposes it is in the Egremont Ward of the Borough of Copeland and the Egremont Division of Cumbria County Council. Egremont has its own Parish Council; Egremont Town Council.  Economy  Manufacturing industries have declined but service, new media and tourism industries have taken their place. Egremont's Florence Mine was (until 2008) the last working deep iron ore mine left in Western Europe and produced ore, products for the cosmetics industry and high quality haematite for jewellery. The pit head is a listed building. The Florence Mine can be found just south of Egremont. A large local employer is the nuclear site at nearby Sellafield. The last few years have seen the running down of the nuclear power industry and the growth of the nuclear decommissioning industry. Transport Egremont formerly had a railway station on the Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway, but it closed in 1947, the nearest train station is at Nethertown Bus services 6 and X6 link Egremont to Seascale, Gosforth and towns south of Egremont. There are many other bus services that link to Whitehaven and Workington (30, 30A, 22 and 22A). The A595 bypasses Egremont, which gives strong links to to the south and to the north, Whitehaven and Workington.http://www.stagecoachbus.com/timetables/Service6X6from31August2008.pdf Tourism Egremont has Egremont Castle, Florence Mine, Hartley's Ice Cream, Lowes Court Gallery, various walks, Clint's Quarry (SSSI) and cycle paths. Community and culture Egremont has a castle, several churches, two supermarkets and a market selling a variety of goods held every Friday. It has had a brass band since 1904. The band aims to promote brass band music in the local area.Egremont Town Band The town has one secondary school, West Lakes Academy, and four primary schools, which are Bookwell, Orgill and Thornhill primary schools, plus St Bridget's Catholic Primary School.BBC: School league tables It has an active public and community arts programme, called Creative Egremont. The town is home to Florence Arts Centre, based at the nearby Florence Mine (now disused), which has a programme of live events - gigs, theatre and stand-up comedy - and an art gallery. There is a studio on-site for the Florence Paintmakers, a co-operative of artists who use the local iron ore pigment to make oil and watercolour paints, pastels and other art materials. Egremont also has a dedicated town freesheet, published by Egremont & District Labour Party and delivered to thousands of addresses in the town several times a year. The paper is financed by the Copeland Constituency Labour Party,Copeland Constituency Labour Party 2003 accounts showing the financing of the newspaper and its treasurer is David Southward MBE.

This fair is a major local event, with the town's high street being closed to normal traffic for street dancing and a parade, while sports such as Cumberland & Westmorland Wrestling are held on ground nearby.2009 Crab Fair schedule The fair's origins go back to 1267, and it is claimed to be one of the oldest fairs in the world.  History  = History of the town = Egremont pre-dates the Norman conquest. The Danes first established a fort on the site of Egremont Castle around the end of the first millennium AD. In about 1300, the town was established much as it is seen today, surrounded by agricultural lands. In 1322, Robert Bruce attacked the town, causing a huge death toll. For the next 100 years or so an uneasy peace followed and the castle fell into ruins. In 1565, a stone bridge was built over the River Ehen to access the town, which was now smaller because of frequent Scottish raids. Little changed for a century, until new stone buildings appeared on the Main Street, probably built with stone from the castle. In 1683, Edward Benn and his heirs were given land with the provision that they rebuild the stone bridge and maintain it for ever. In 1748, another bridge was built at Briscoe Mill at a cost of ¬£28-15s-0d (¬£28.75), paid for by John Pearson, a local hatter. Soon Egremont began to service the Port of Whitehaven and in 1830, iron ore was mined over several sites. Over the next 60 years new schools, churches and the town hall were built. New housing estates were also built to accommodate the growing town, with many old parts of the town being demolished in 1968. In 1964, Wyndham School was built, an early comprehensive school. In 1970, there was a large increase in workers moving into the town to work on the new nuclear site. In 1990, the Egremont by-pass was opened. = Industrial history = In bygone days, dyeing and weaving were traditional industries based around the River Ehen. Iron ore mining and quarrying has been established in Egremont for more than 800 years. Industrial mining of iron ore started around 1830 with many mines being opened, and continues to this day. Around the early 17th century, agricultural lime was mined at Clints Quarry, with more heavy duty mining being undertaken to supply the iron and ore industry in the mid 19th century, finally ending in 1930. Clints Quarry (now a Site of Special Scientific Interest) can be found just north of Egremont town. In 1950, Rowntrees built a chocolate crumb factory near Christie Bridge and the nuclear industry became established at Sellafield. The Rowntrees site has become a new housing estate, York Place, which is located at the northern end of Main Street. The Sellafield site (now Sellafield Limited) is still operating while undergoing major change. = History of the Barony of Copeland (or Egremont) = When William Rufus extended Norman rule into Cumbria in around 1092,For details, see Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, pp. 36‚Äî8. control of the area was given to Ivo Taillebois, who was married to Lucy of Bolingbroke, heiress of extensive lands in Lincolnshire. When Ivo died in 1094, this authority passed to Lucy's second husband Roger fitz Gerold de Roumare, who survived for only two more years, then to her third husband Ranulph le Meschines. On his becoming the Earl of Chester, his estates were returned to the Crown towards paying for the earldom. Around 1120, Henry I gave the Barony of Copeland to Ranulph's son William who made his home at Egremont and began to build the castle, which took approximately 150 years to complete. The Barony was inherited by William's son Ranulph . With Ranulph having no male heir, the Barony passed to his sister Alice, who married the Scottish prince, William Fitz Duncan; they had a child who, after his death, became known as \\"the Boy of Egremont\\"; again, with no living male heir, William Fitz Duncan's estates passed to his three daughters Annabel, Cecily and Alice. The estates passed down to Annabel's son Richard de Lucy. Richard's two daughters married two brothers of the de Multon family, Alice (now called de Morville) married Alan de Multon and Annabel (also now called de Morville) married Lambert de Multon. Annabel and Lambert de Multon inherited the Barony of Copeland and again, the castle had a lord in residence. Around 1205, the tale of Grunwilda was told; she was the wife of Richard de Lucy and was killed by a wolf on a hunting trip; this tale is recounted in the poem \\"The Woeful Chase\\". Again leaving no male heir, Richard died and the superstition began that no male heir should inherit Egremont Castle because of the conduct of the forefathers. Egremont was granted its royal charter by Henry III in 1267, with the right to hold a weekly market and an annual fair. When the last male Multon died in 1335, one of the co-heiresses married Thomas Lucy, grandson of Thomas Multon. Anthony, the last Lord Lucy, died in 1369, and the lands passed to his brother-in-law Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, staying with the Percy family and its successors ever since. The present lord is John Max Henry Scawen Wyndham, Baron Egremont and Baron Leconfield, who lives in the family home, one of the earliest Percy possessions: Petworth House in West Sussex. The dowager Lady Egremont, Pamela, lives at Cockermouth Castle. June 2010 shootings On 2 June 2010, the area became the centre of a search after a gunman ran amok in Cumbria. Derrick Bird, a 52-year-old local taxi driver, shot and killed twelve people, two of them in Egremont, before committing suicide.

An early warning system can be implemented as a chain of information communication systems and comprises sensors, event detection and decision subsystems. They work together to forecast and signal disturbances that adversely affect the stability of the physical world, providing time for the response system to prepare for the adverse event and to minimize its impact. EWS Observer Controller Model and the Subsystem To be effective, early warning systems need to actively involve the communities at risk, facilitate public education and awareness of risks, effectively disseminate alerts, and warnings and ensure there is constant state of preparedness. A complete and effective early warning system supports four main functions: risk analysis, monitoring and warning; dissemination and communication; and a response capability. Application Risk analysis involves systematically collecting data and undertaking risk assessments of predefined hazards and vulnerabilities. Monitoring and warning involves a study of the factors that indicate a disaster is imminent, as well as the methods used to detect these factors. Dissemination and communication concerns communicating the risk information and warnings to reach those in danger in a way that is clear and understandable. Finally, an adequate response capability requires the building of national and community response plan, testing of the plan, and the promotion of readiness to ensure that people know how to respond to warnings. An early warning system is more than a warning system, which is simply a means by which an alert can be disseminated to the public. History Since the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004, there has been a surge of interest in developing early warning systems. However, early warning systems can be used to detect a wide range of events, such as vehicular collisions, missile launches, disease outbreaks, and so forth. See warning system for a wider list of applications that also can be supported by early warning systems.

They averaged 497 (out of 800) verbal, 514 math and 489 in writing. Dual enrollment The high school offers a Dual Enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. For the 2009-10 funding year, the Delaware Valley School District received a state grant of $43,855 for the program. Classrooms for the future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Delaware Valley School District's application was denied by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, in 2006-07. in 2007-08, Delaware Valley High School received 548,545. The school received another $99,595 in 2008-09 for a total funding of $648,140. The highest funding state wide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. In 2010, Classrooms for the Future funding was curtailed statewide due to a massive state financial crisis. Extracurriculars The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and the rules of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association. By Pennsylvania law, all K12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private non-public school, cyber charter school, charter school and those home-schooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

Established in 1885, Long Beach Unified School District now educates 81,000 students in 84 public schools in the cities of Long Beach, Lakewood, Signal Hill, and Avalon on Catalina Island. The school district is the third largest in California and serves one of the most diverse large cities in the United States. The student population is 53.1 percent Hispanic, 15.6 percent African American, 15.2 percent white, 11.2 percent Asian, 3 percent multi-race, 1.7 percent Pacific Islander and 0.2 percent Native American. More than two-thirds of the student population come from lower-income households and qualify for free and reduced price meals. The school district employs more than 8,000 people, making it the largest employer in Long Beach. History As of 1993 several parents in the LBUSD boundaries enrolled their children in the Los Alamitos Unified School District day care program so that they could then use LBUSD district transfer rules, stating that parents may enroll their children at a school closest to their daycare provider even if the school is in another school district, to obtain an inter- district transfer from the Los Alamitos district and send their children to Los Alamitos schools. As a result, LBUSD was losing money, because state education funds were paid based on attendance. Horn said \\"It was never anyone's intention to make the (child-care) program a drawing card from other school districts. It did turn out that way.\\" Gordon Dillow of the Los Angeles Times said \\"Although school officials say they do not track the racial make-up of their inter-district transfer students, the perception has been that many, perhaps most, of the Long Beach-to-Los Alamitos transfer students are Anglo.\\" Whites were a minority in LBUSD, with 26% of the student body, while they were a majority at Los Alamitos USD, with 75% of the student body. In the 1992-1993 school year, 400 students who lived in LBUSD attended Los Alamitos schools because a parent was working at Los Alamitos schools or because of the after school program. Dillow said that while the loss of that number of students from LBUSD, with 76,000 students, \\"may not seem significant, but it does cause the school district to lose about $4,000 per year for each student in state education funding.\\"Dillow, Gordon. \\"Schools Fight Flight of Students to Los Alamitos : Education: Day care services in the upscale district drain pupils who later enroll in its elementaries.

On January 18, 1994, the LBUSD Board of Education voted to require school uniforms in all elementary and middle schools, with the wearing of school uniforms to start in September 1994. The district was the first large urban school district in the United States to require school uniforms. On August 23, 1994, SB 1269 the School Uniform Law was approved by the Governor of California to support schools that adopt a school-wide uniform policy, which also allowed parents to opt out of the policy. At LBUSD, roughly 2% of the students opt out of the uniform policy. Since starting the uniform policy, LBUSD claimed assaults dropped by two-thirds, suspensions dropped by almost a third, vandalism dropped, attendance improved, and test scores increased. President Bill Clinton mentioned LBUSD's uniform policy in his 1996 State of the Union Address. Numerous other large urban districts have now adopted school uniform policies. Some researchers, including David Brunsma of the Sociology Department of University of Missouri, have said that the benefits ascribed to the implementation of the LBUSD uniform policy were logically attributable to other factors; such as increased school security, collateral attendance enforcement efforts, and in-class programs designed to bolster sagging test scores. LBUSD now has two high schools, Wilson Classical High School, and Millikan High School, that require school uniforms as well. In 1999, Jefferson Leadership Academies became the first public middle school in the United States to convert entirely to single gender classes. Only a few dozen more schools have followed this trend, mostly because of Title IX of the 1972 Education Act, which prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded programs. The school has plans to discontinue the program after scheduling conflicts and disappointing test scores. In 2001, there was a movement to form a Lakewood Unified School District. Because students in the city of Lakewood are currently divided between four different school districts (ABC Unified School District, Bellflower Unified School District, Paramount Unified School District and LBUSD), a petition was started. After gathering the required number of petition signatures and an LA County review, the issue went before the California State Board of Education. The board rejected the petition on February 8, 2001 because the board said the proposed district failed to meet four of the state's nine criteria for new district formation. With that setback, the most current plans () are to try to merge those areas of Lakewood served by Paramount into either the Bellflower or Long Beach Unified School Districts.http://www.pasleyrealty.com/lakewood.htm District awards LBUSD was the winner of the third-annual $1 million Broad Prize for Urban Education in 2017. The Broad Prize is the largest education prize in the country awarded to urban school districts.http://www.broadfoundation.org/flagship/past.shtml In 2004, LBUSD received a second grant from the Broad Foundation for $1.14 million to continue their efforts to improve the organization of the district's schools using Baldrige strategies. In 2004, the Broad Foundation also awarded 55 Long Beach Unified School District seniors $500,000 in scholarships as Broad Prize Scholars. LBUSD has gone on to receive nominations for the award three more times and once prior to winning (2002, 2006, 2007, 2008). Unusual schools Two Harbors Elementary School, at Two Harbors on Catalina Island, is a one-room school. Enrollment () is 12 students. In 2014, the Two Harbors one-room schoolhouse closed due to low enrollment, and students now go to school on the other side of the island in Avalon, which is a 45-minute to 1-hour drive. Previously the district had planned to close the school in fall 2005, but Two Harbors residents and visitors raised enough money to keep the school open.

The name refers to two buildings in which the church met. The congregation originally met in the New Society Room which was built in 1741 for George Whitefield and John Cennick after a separation occurred between them and John Wesley. The former Society Room building was expanded to a large size, and is a grade I listed building. It is now roofless and derelict after an arson attack. In 1851 a very large Gothic building, designed by Henry Masters, was constructed just west of the original tabernacle. In the late 20th century this building was closed and the United Reformed Church congregation moved back into the original 18th-century building for a few years, before leaving both buildings to join together for worship with another congregation associated with the 18th-century revival, the Moravian Church, in the Moravian building on the other side of the High Street. In 2003 the Tabernacle featured in the BBC's Restoration series. As of 2007, there were plans for the redevelopment of the three listed buildings on the Tabernacle site, namely the two churches and the 18th century Chapel House. Besides various proposed memorial facilities, the plan includes flats in the Chapel House and the 19th century building. At February 2011 the site was still derelict although the large disused churchyard had been cleared of vegetation. As at February 2015 the site is still derelict and the graveyard is once again overgrown.

Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 1973, (now: Marquette Plaza), in its original configuration. Gunnar Birkerts (, January 17, 1925 ‚Äì August 15, 2017) was a Latvian American architect who, for most of his career, was based in the metropolitan area of Detroit, Michigan. Some of his notable designs include the Corning Museum of Glass and the Corning Fire Station in Corning, New York; Marquette Plaza in Minneapolis, Minnesota; the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art in Kansas City, Missouri; and the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, Venezuela. In 2014, the National Library of Latvia in Riga was completed to his design. The Corning Fire Station facade and floor plan. The building has a strict form where small vehicles are placed in the narrow portion at the tip. All function spaces have been baked into the base of the triangle, such as changing rooms, storage room, dining room, dormitory and office, where all rooms are accessed via a wide corridor. Biography Birkerts was born and raised in Latvia, but escaped ahead of the advancing Soviet army toward the end of the Second World War. He graduated from the Technische Hochschule, Stuttgart, Germany, in 1949. He acknowledged being influenced by Scandinavian tradition and the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. Birkerts immigrated to the United States that year and worked initially for Perkins and Will, based in Chicago. He moved to the Detroit area in the early 1950s, where he worked for Eero Saarinen, and was chief designer for Minoru Yamasaki before opening his own office in the city's suburbs. Birkerts also maintained an architectural office in Wellesley, Massachusetts He initially practiced in the partnership Birkerts and Straub. In 1963, he set up Gunnar Birkerts and Associates in Birmingham, Michigan. The firm received Honor Awards for its projects from the (national) American Institute of Architects in 1962, 1970, 1973, as well as numerous awards from the Michigan Society of Architects and the local chapter. Birkerts joined the faculty at the University of Michigan in 1959 and taught until 1990. The ACSA (Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture) honored Birkerts with the ACSA Distinguished Professor Award in 1989‚Äì90. Birkerts designed a number of notable buildings in the United States, including the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis, Corning Glass Museum, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, the University of Iowa College of Law, the Duluth Public Library in Duluth, Minnesota, and the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, Venezuela. In 1989 Birkerts was commissioned to design the new building for the National Library of Latvia in Riga, Latvia, which had great personal meaning for him. Also known as the Castle of Light, he drew from Latvian folklore about the Glass Mountain for its architectural form. The building was constructed over the period 2008 to 2014. Legacy and honors In 1970 Gunnar Birkerts was selected as a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, and a Fellow of the Latvian Architect Association in 1971. He received numerous individual awards, including a 1971 fellowship from the Graham Foundation, the Gold Medal of the Michigan Society of Architects in 1980, the Arnold W.

Having a northwest-southeast direction, it is stretched from Kashan to Ardestan for more than 100 kilometres. With an elevation of 3895 metres, the highest peak of the Karkas Mountains is Mount Karkas which is situated close to Natanz.Microsoft Encarta World Atlas, 2001, Microsoft Corporation  Etymology  Although in Persian karkas means vulture, it is possible that the name of this mountain chain is derived from the settlement activity of the ancient Kassites in the area, because in the ancient Assyrian language Kar-Kassi means \\"town or land of the Kassites\\" (modified interpretation after Roman Ghirshman, 1954). Geology The Karkas Mountains were formed mainly during the Eocene volcanism. Located in the Sahand-Bazman volcanic and plutonic belt, this mountain range is composed predominantly of the Eocene volcanic rocks of the Tertiary volcanism. Aside from the Tertiary igneous (plutonic and volcanic) rocks, there are also pyroclastic and sedimentary rocks.

The University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna (, abbreviated MDW) is an Austrian university located in Vienna, established in 1817. Today, with a student body of over three thousand, it is the largest institution of its kind in Austria, and one of the largest in the world. In 1817, it was established by the Society for the Friends of Music. It has had several names: Vienna Conservatory, Vienna Academy and in 1909 it was nationalized as the Imperial Academy of Music and the Performing Arts. In 1998, the University assumed its current name to reflect its university status, attained in a wide 1970 reform for Austrian Arts Academies. In 2019, the Universit√§t f√ºr Musik und Darstellende Kunst Wien (MDW) was named one of the \\"best performing arts schools in the world\\" by the CEOWORLD magazine. The University With a student body of more than 3000, the Universit√§t f√ºr Musik und Darstellende Kunst Wien (MDW) is one of the largest arts universities in the world. The University consists of 24 departments including the Max Reinhardt Seminar, Vienna Film Academy and the Wiener Klangstil. MDW facilities include the Sch√∂nbrunn Palace Theater, Antonio Vivaldi Room, Salesian Convent, St. Ursula Church, Lothringerstrasse (Franz Liszt Room) and the Anton Von Webern Platz (university main campus). Modern film studios were completed on the university campus in 2004, offering the Vienna Film Academy modern equipment. The University organizes around 10 competitions, including the International Beethoven Piano Competition. It also presents an acclaimed students‚Äô film festival every two years. The MDW may be considered a \\"feeder\\" institution to all major orchestras in Austria, with a particular association with the Vienna Philharmonic. History Calls for a music conservatory in Vienna started in 1808. In 1811 an \\"outline for a music education institution\\" for Vienna was published. A year later the Society for the Friends of Music was formed, with the foremost aim of establishing a conservatory. The Vienna Conservatory was founded in 1817. It was meant to be modeled on the Paris Conservatory, but, due to a lack of funds, it began solely as a singing school. Antonio Salieri was the Conservatory's first director. In 1819, it hired violinist Joseph B√∂hm, and by 1827 offered courses in most orchestral instruments. University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna The Conservatory's finances were very unstable. Tuition fees were introduced in 1829, but by 1837 the institution was bankrupt. The state eventually funded the Conservatory from 1841 to 1844 and from 1846 to 1848. In 1848 political unrest caused the state to discontinue funding, and the Conservatory did not offer courses again until 1851. With support from the state and the city, finances again stabilized after 1851. Despite growing state subsidy, The Society for the Friends of Music, which founded the Conservatory, remained in control of the institution. However, by a January 1, 1909 imperial resolution the school was nationalized and became the Imperial Academy of Music and the Performing Arts (k.k. Akademie f√ºr Musik und darstellende Kunst). (Until then its name was the Konservatorium der Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde.) Until 1844, when Gottfried Preyer, professor of harmony and composition became director, the director of the Conservatory was not a member of faculty, but a member of the Society for the Friends of Music. Joseph Hellmesberger Sr. was director from 1851 to 1893. From 1907 Wilhelm Bopp had been the director of Conservatory. The Conservatory was still dominated by the aging Robert Fuchs and Hermann Gr√§dener, both of whom, but especially Fuchs, Bopp considered to be anachronistic and out of touch. In 1912, attempting to rejuvenate the Conservatory Bopp offered teaching positions to Franz Schreker and Arnold Schoenberg. Schoenberg declined the offer, but Schreker accepted it. His teaching duties were carried through with great success and by January 1913 he was awarded a full professorship. Bopp was also instrumental in the 1909 nationalization of the Conservatory. The administration of the Academy was now assigned to a state- appointed president, an artistic director and a board of trustees. After the end of World War I, the State Academy was again reorganized. President Karl Ritter von Wiener resigned and conductor Ferdinand L√∂we was elected director by the teachers. In 1922, Joseph Marx took over. He wanted the Academy to be granted University status. After the Anschluss, many teachers and students were dismissed on racial grounds. In 1941, the Academy became a Reich University (Reichshochschule). After World War II, the institution became a State Academy again. In the process of Denazification, fifty-nine teachers were dismissed; by November 1945, sixteen were reinstated. Only five of the teachers dismissed in 1938 were reinstated. By laws introduced in 1948 and 1949 the institution was granted the status of \\"Art Academy\\". In 1970, the \\"Law on the Organization of Art Colleges\\" effectively gave all Art Academies University status, and in 1998 the title of \\"Art Academy\\" was changed to \\"Art University\\".

There is also a facility in the Capitol Hill neighborhood in downtown Denver, Colorado. The doctrines of the organization are based on teachings and wisdom received by Guy Ballard in 1930.

Gordon Melton studied the group and ranked it in the category \\"established cult\\". Also present in New Zealand, the St. Germain Foundation is considered by writer Robert S. Ellwood as a religious group with theosophical and esoteric roots. The group is recognized by the Theosophical Society and the Great White Brotherhood. The group was labelled as cult in the 1995 report established by Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France. The group founded a community in France in 1956 and is now located in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. It counts less than 50 members.Jean-Pierre Van Girt, La France aux cent sectes, Vauvenargues editions, 1997, p. 193,194 () In 1997, the Belgian parliamentary commission established a list of 189 movements containing I AM. Worldwide, the religious group had over one million members in 1940, but it began to decline after Ballard's death. Among the splinter groups of the Saint Germain Foundation, there have been The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse and the Church Universal and Triumphant.

ASTt groups were the first human occupants of Arctic Canada and Greenland. This was a terrestrial entity that had a highly distinctive toolkit based on microblade technology. Typically tool types include scrapers, burins and side and end blades used in composite arrows or spears made of other materials, such as bone or antler. Many researchers also assume that it was Arctic Small Tool populations who first introduced the bow and arrow to the Arctic, that eventually became the Eskimo archery material culture. ASTt camps are often found along coasts and streams, to take advantage of seal or salmon populations. While some of the groups were fairly nomadic, more permanent, sod-roofed homes have also been identified from Arctic Small Tool tradition sites. The Arctic Small Tool tradition includes a number of cultural groups, including the Denbigh Flint Complex in Alaska, the Pre-Dorset culture in Arctic Canada, Independence I culture in the High Arctic and Saqqaq culture in southern Greenland. The ASTt was followed by the Norton tradition in Alaska and the Dorset culture in Arctic Canada. Siberian connections According to Pavel Flegontov, ASTt may have originated in East Siberia about 5,000 years ago, :\\"Paleo-Eskimo archeological cultures are grouped under the Arctic Small Tool tradition (ASTt), and include the Denbigh, Choris, Norton, and Ipiutak cultures in Alaska, and the Saqqaq, Independence, Pre-Dorset, and Dorset cultures in the Canadian Arctic and Greenland. The ASTt source has been argued to lie in the Syalakh-Bel‚Äôkachi- Ymyakhtakh culture sequence of East Siberia, dated to 6,500 ‚Äì 2,800 calBP.\\" The earliest form of the Norton tradition of Alaska is known as the Choris Stage (ca. 1600‚Äî500 BC). The sites are mostly coastal and contain pottery similar to that of Siberia. This culture expanded as far as the Mackenzie River Delta and Banks Island. Genetic DNA studies also support the connections. Notes References * Fagan, Brian. Ancient North America.

Using Amazon Marketplace, third-party sellers gain access to Amazon's customer base, and Amazon expands the offerings on its site without having to invest in additional inventory. Overview Items purchased on Amazon from third-party sellers are either fulfilled by the merchant (FBM) or fulfilled by Amazon (FBA). FBM goods are kept in the third-party seller's inventory, and shipping and customer service are handled by the third-party merchant. FBA goods are stored in Amazon's fulfillment centers, and shipping and customer service are handled by Amazon. Amazon charges its third-party merchants a referral fee for each sale which is a percentage of the sales price. Additionally, sellers using FBA must pay additional fees which include a pick, pack and weight charge. Third-party sales on Amazon account for around 31% of Amazon's annual sales. In 2016 Amazon.com aided more than 10,000 sellers to generate more than $1 billion of annual sales. The incredible ease of creating an Amazon account has led to massive increases in third-party sellers joining the platform, with over 1,000,000 sellers joining in the year 2017 alone. There are three major paths third-party sellers can take on Amazon. Wholesale, private label and retail arbitrage. The Amazon Seller Central help section provides sellers on the Amazon Marketplace with guidelines and answers to frequently asked questions. Despite the existence of this help section, a recent study has shown that 50 percent of surveyed sellers incorrectly believe that it was not possible to directly ask buyers for product reviews. If an Amazon Seller has an active registered trademark for their brand that appears on their products or packaging and can verify themselves as the rights owner or the authorized agent for the trademark, they can apply for Amazon Brand Registry. Amazon has an internal search algorithm (A9) that works almost in the same way as those of Google or Bing. The algorithm analyzes search queries that users enter in a search bar and selects the most relevant offers from brands with a good track record. Criticism Amazon's dispute resolution policies and practices for Marketplace have drawn criticism from many sellers. The Verge has reported that many fear a complaint lodged against them with Amazon more than they would an actual lawsuit. Among their specific complaints are that policies are vague and contradictory, that buyers are often taken at their word and thus businesses are forced to admit and correct wrongdoing for perceived or minimal shortcomings rather than contest the complaint since there is no other way to get reinstated. Rules meant to protect sellers have also been weaponized, with many merchants devoting their energies to getting competitors suspended or removed from the site entirely. On July 3, 2019, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Amazon.com Inc., stating that the online retailer can be held liable under state law for third-party sales on its portal. Suspension Amazon takes a zero-tolerance stance on what it calls seller performance. Amazon suspends seller accounts, sometimes indefinitely. Suspended sellers are prohibited from opening a new seller account. =Suspension reasons= * Seller Performance: This is where Amazon deems a seller to be performing under its required standards. * Product Performance: This covers products that may have been reported to Amazon for quality issues. * Delivery Performance: This covers both dispatch and delivery timescales. * Counterfeit Reporting: If a product is reported as a counterfeit, Amazon removes selling privileges until further inquiry is completed. =Non- suspension restrictions= Sometimes Amazon may restrict certain sellers items or ability to sell without suspending the whole account. * Staging Status: This is where a seller is newly launched and or Amazon wants to temporarily restrict the seller's ability to sell items without suspending the account. Sellers often report their account appearing to be in vacation mode and unable to re-activate their listings. * ASIN Creation Privileges: Sellers are able to create new items for sale on Amazon without any supervision. Any seller found to be abusing this functionality has what Amazon considers the privilege removed.

She is often mentioned in the same context as Florence Foster Jenkins: both are apt to be criticised as people who were publicly tolerated and even celebrated as singers due to their wealth and social position, despite a lack of talent. Background and education Luncheon party at left Tryphosa Duncan Bates was born the only child of Theodore Cornelius and Emma Frances (Duncan) Bates. Her father was a manufacturer, proprietor, and a Republican politician of English ancestry. She was named after her maternal grandmother, Tryphosa (Larkin) Duncan. She came from a family of some means and pedigree, and was privately educated in France and the United States, graduating from Radcliffe College in 1899. According to the Biographical Cyclopedia of U.S. Women, her family was prominent in the Boston area, and her ancestor Joshua Bates gave $50,000 in 1853 and later 30,000 volumes to the city of Boston toward the establishment of the Boston Public Library. Apparently the idea of the modern library, where books could be taken from shelves by readers and then returned, was his, and the Boston Library was the first in the world to do this; its main reading room is called Bates Hall. Musical career Tryphosa believed she had a good singing voice and was encouraged by friends and relatives, eventually studying classical singing with several famous teachers, including Giovanni Sgambati, Blanche and Mathilde Marchesi, Sir George Henschel, B. T. Lang, as well as Veda, Bimboni, and Giraudet. In 1904 she married the wealthy shoe manufacturer Francis B. Batcheller and thereafter retained her maiden name as the first half of her hyphenated married name. The couple left their native North Brookfield, Massachusetts home and set up home in an apartment in Paris, France. Her wealth and social position seems to have papered over any doubts teachers, managers and critics had about the dismal quality of her actual singing, and she appeared in many private concerts and benefits, sometimes with the composer Jules Massenet accompanying her. Her wealth enabled her to appear on the cover of America's Musical Courier magazine twice, in 1904 and 1906. A relentless social climber who chased after aristocrats and royalty, Bates-Batcheller was hampered in this by her own Catholicism, and was thus prevented from assaulting the important Protestant court of England. Her aggressive pursuits in this area are chronicled in the four books of memoirs and one novel she had published. In 1941 she returned to the United States and, shortly after, recorded two sides for the same vanity record label (Melotone) in New York as Jenkins. These recordings lay unnoticed in the collection of the musicologist and record collector Larry Holdridge until they were published in 2004 on a compact disc entitled \\"The Muse Surmounted\\" (Homophone 1001), the booklet for which contains a biography of Bates- Batcheller, as well as recordings and information about Jenkins and others of the same style, along with photos of each and other information. The recording presents a compilation of the history of this kind of singing on record, and the writer, musicologist Gregor Benko, states his opinion that Bates- Batcheller was an even \\"greater\\" bad singer than Florence Foster Jenkins. A review of this compilation stated that \\"Bates-Batcheller's contribution to music ranks with William McGonagall's to poetry\\". Tryphosa mentioned in one of her books that she also recorded a Schubert song, but this has not, alas, been located.

Ciro Pinsuti (9 May 1829 ‚Äì 10 March 1888) was an Anglo-Italian composer. Educated in music for a career as a pianist, he studied composition under Rossini. From 1848 he made his home in England, where he became a teacher of singing, and in 1856 he was made a professor at the Academy of Music in London. Pinsuti composed numerous songs and part-songs which achieved popularity in the Victorian era. He also composed three operas, which were produced in Italy, but which are rarely performed today. He is most remembered for his popular parlour songs such as \\"I Fear no Foe\\" and the \\"Bedouin love song\\". Life Pinsuti's birthplace in Sinalunga He was born in Sinalunga near Siena, Italy, the son of Maddalena Formichi and G. Battista Pinsuti, who was the music teacher of the local orchestra. After studying music with a friend of his father, he made his first public appearance on 7 March 1840 at the age of ten in the Civic Theatre of Perugia playing the violin in the orchestra.The New International Encyclop√¶dia, Volume 16, Dodd, Mead, 1911, p.42. After the season, his father took him to Rome, where he played for several important Roman families, and gaining access to the Accademia di Santa Cecilia. British MP Henry Drummond saw Ciro performing and proposed to his father that he would pay for Ciro's tuition at the conservatory of Naples, provided that Ciro came to London to perform. Pinsuti remained in London for five years, after which he chose to study with Gioachino Rossini at the Bologna Conservatory. Rossini, who befriended Pinsuti, advised him to return to London after finishing his studies, as Britain represented the best prospects for his future career.\\"Ciro Pinsuti, Obituary\\", The British Bandsman: The Official Organ of the National Brass Band Championships, Volume 1, Issue 24, 1888, p.119 Having returned to London, Pinsuti gave music lessons during the day, while performing his own compositions at evening soirees. The Royal Academy of Music in London appointed him as a singing teacher. He was also given posts in Italy, becoming an honorary member of the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome. In 1876, he was given an official position on the Sinalunga city council, a position he held until his death, even though his commitment was necessarily subject to his many other activities. In 1879 he conducted Verdi's Il Trovatore at the theatre in Sinalunga, and supported the local orchestra, which was led by his brother, Domenico Pinsuti. In 1885 his opera Margherita was staged in Venice and then in Sinalunga. Ciro Pinsuti died in Florence on March 10, 1888; his life was celebrated at his official funeral on April 10, 1888 in St. Martin's, Sinalunga.Marcello Cofini, Ariano Guastaldi, Lucia Mazzetti (2002) - Musica e musicisti al tempo di Ciro, Biblioteca Comunale di Sinalunga, Collana Teatro Comunale \\"Ciro Pinsuti\\", n¬∞ 3.

Wodehouse in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit.Summer Moonshine, by P G Wodehouse, Literary and Cultural References =Operas= Pinsuti composed three operas: Margherita, performed for the first time at Teatro La Fenice in Venice in 1882 and three years later in the Municipal Theatre of Sinalunga in 1885. This work is a lyrical drama in four acts, with libretto written by A. Zanardini. Il mercante di Venezia (The Merchant of Venice), performed for the first time at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna on 8 November 1873. This is an opera in four acts based on the play by Shakespeare, with libretto by G. T. Cimino. Mattia Corvino (Matthias Corvinus), performed for the first time at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan on March 24, 1877, a lyrical drama in a prologue and three acts. The libretto was by Carlo D'Ormeville. =Songs= In Britain and America Pinsuti was best known for his parlour songs. One of these ballads titled \\"Beatrice - Kind and so modest\\", was a setting of Dante's sonnet XXVI from La Vita Nuova. His song \\"I fear no foe\\", to words by E. Oxenford, was popular and widely-sung in Britain. Other widely recorded songs included the \\"Bedouin love song\\" and \\"Welcome, pretty primrose\\".\\"Ciro Pinsuti\\", Discography of American Historical Recordings Performers who recorded his songs included Peter Dawson, J.

Initially constructed in 1685 and enlarged and remodeled many times thereafter, it is located at 159 Brattle Street in Cambridge. It is the second-oldest house in the city (after the Cooper‚ÄìFrost‚ÄìAustin House, c. 1681‚Äì1682). The house is now headquarters for the Cambridge Historical Society, which provides tours several times a week. History The house was originally built in 1685 by Dr. Richard Hooper as a typical First Period farmhouse, although its ceilings were plastered, which was unusual for a modest house. When Hooper died in 1691, his wife took in boarders and the property then began to fall into disrepair. She in turn died in 1701, and the house continued its decline until 1716, when it was claimed by Hooper's son, Dr. Henry Hooper, who discharged the debts on his mother's estate. He purchased a second house, had it disassembled, moved to the site and reassembled, thereby doubling the size of the house. He also added a lean- to and rebuilt the chimney with cooking ovens. In 1733, he sold the house to Cornelius Waldo, who added a third story and began the process of converting the house to Georgian style. Judge Joseph Lee bought the house in 1758, adding the enclosed entry porch and applying stucco to the west wall. Lee was a Loyalist and hence vacated his house during the first days of the American Revolution; he returned, however, in 1777. In 1850, George and Susan Nichols rented the house and began to renovate it. They enlarged the rear and installed the roof balustrade, containing balusters once part of the chancel of Saint Paul's Cathedral in Boston. In 1916 Austin White, a relative of the Nicholses, removed the two-story rear of the house and rebuilt it to a full three stories. Finally in 1923 Frances Emerson was given the house by her father as a Christmas present. Her husband was for many years Dean of Architecture at MIT. She deeded the house to the Cambridge Historical Society, which came into possession of it in 1957. In the early 1980s, the Society made extensive restorations and stabilization of the structure. Additional major renovation work was performed in 2013. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

During Theodore's minority, his father Emperor Manuel II stayed in Morea and supervised its administration and defense, rebuilding the Hexamilion wall across the Isthmus of Corinth. Theodore's seal as Despot of the Morea A moment of drastic change in policy was his marriage to the Latin noblewoman Cleofa Malatesta, arranged with the help of her uncle Pope Martin V, who became Theodore's ally and supporter. In a letter from around the time of Manuel II's death (July 21, 1425), Pope Martin V called Theodore II emperor of Constantinople (ad Theodorum imperatorem constantinopolitanum) but the crown actually passed to his older brother John VIII. The war in Morea had started to go against the Byzantines and, under pressure from Carlo I Tocco, the Count of Kefalonia and ruler of Epirus, the Despot demanded help from his brother John VIII. That help came in the form of reinforcements led by their brother Constantine, who became joint governor of Morea with Theodore II in 1428. The united efforts of the brothers contributed to the naval victory at the Echinades in 1427 and the conquest of Patras in 1430. On the other hand, Emperor John VIII declared Theodore's younger brother Constantine regent of the empire during his voyage to Florence in 1438, which emphasized his selection of Constantine as his intended heir. The next several years were marred by disputes with Constantine over the succession to the childless John VIII. In a compromise, Theodore II Palaiologos surrendered his claim to the throne in exchange for Constantine's domain (appanage) of Selymbria (Silivri) in 1443, where he died of plague five years later, in 1448, predeceasing his brothers. Family By his marriage to Cleofa Malatesta, an Italian aristocrat, Theodore II Palaiologos had at least one daughter: # Helena Palaiologina. She married King John II of Cyprus.

There are remains of human settlements in the area dating back to the Neolithic period as well as ruins of fortified villages from the Bronze and Iron Ages.History of Lankaran With the death of Nader Shah (r. 1736-1747), the Talysh Khanate was founded by a certain Seyyed Abbas, whose ancestors were members of the Iranian Safavid dynasty, and had moved into the Talish region during the 1720s during a turbulent period in Iranian history. From the founding of the khanate, until 1828, it was under the suzerainty of the Iranian Zand and Qajar dynasties. In the first half of the 18th century, the Russians gained control over it for a few years through the Russo-Persian War of 1722-1723; in 1732 it was ceded back to Iran by the Treaty of Resht. During the Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813, General Kotlyarevsky heading the southernmost Russian contingent during the war, stormed and captured Lankaran's fortress. Following the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813, it was ceded to Russia.Timothy C. Dowling Russia at War: From the Mongol Conquest to Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Beyond pp 728-730 ABC-CLIO, 2 dec. 2014 Qajar Iran would later retake the city during the Russo-Persian War of 1826-1828, but was forced to return it following the Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828), which saw the definite end of Persian influence in the South Caucasus. Once absorbed into the Russian empire, it became a part of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic after the Russian revolution in 1917, and the short time as part of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. In 1991, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it became a part of independent Azerbaijan. Geography There are sandy beaches near Lankaran.

J. MacHale. It follows the adventures of Bobby Pendragon as he travels to Denduron. Plot introduction The story takes place in a \\"territory\\" (Universe separate from the \\"Second Earth\\" universe of the story, there are ten territories in all) called Denduron. Denduron has three suns, one to the east, the north, and the south, but besides that, it has most of the same characteristics as Earth. The story is based around two tribes: the Milago and the Bedoowan. The Milago are treated very poorly by the Bedoowan, who live in luxury; they live in little huts without running water or even outhouses, and have to mine for a valuable stone called glaze every hour of the day in order to meet the demands of Kagan, the queen of the Bedoowan. If the Milago do not meet the required supply of glaze which changes for each day, then one of them is killed by being pushed into an abandoned mine shaft. This process is used by a weight system that weighs the person in glaze. The Bedoowan have more advanced tools and technologies such as running water, stoves, and artificial light. Plot The story starts with Bobby Pendragon, a normal fourteen-year- old boy, preparing to leave his home to play in the state basketball semi- finals, but before he leaves, Courtney Chetwynde, a popular girl at his school, comes to his house and admits her feelings toward him. While they are kissing Bobby's Uncle Press arrives and tells Bobby some people need their help and to come with him. They drive on a motorcycle to a boarded-up subway station in the Bronx. Press leaves the motorcycle outside with the keys in ignition, this surprises Bobby but when he asks, Press says they do not need it anymore. They head into the abandoned subway, where they meet the main villain, Saint Dane, whose goal is to destroy the barriers between the ten territories of Halla; every territory, person, and living thing. Saint Dane controls a homeless man to jump in front of a subway train, and says this is to \\"Give the boy a taste of what he's in for,\\". He attacks Uncle Press and Bobby. Then Uncle Press tells Bobby to go to a door with a star on it and yell Denduron. When Bobby and Press arrive in Denduron, they change their clothing to fit the local customs, and find a bobsled, along with two spears and a dog whistle, left by an acolyte (a person native to a territory who aides the Travelers by leaving items such as clothing and means for transportation). Bobby and Press start their descent from the mountain, and they are attacked by twelve quigs (animals Saint Dane uses to patrol the gates of the flumes; the appearance of quigs vary among the territories). They manage to live through the situation by using the dog whistle and the spears, but the sled crashes, and Press is kidnapped by Bedoowan knights. Bobby is rescued by a Traveler warrior named Osa, a wise woman whose daughter, Loor, is disgusted by him for most of the book. They are acquainted with Alder, a Bedoowen knight who is the Traveler from Denduron in disguise. Bobby, Alder and Loor try to rescue Press from the Bedoowan castle, armed with a backpack full of tools brought from Bobby's home, Second Earth, to make the job of rescuing Uncle Press easier, despite the warning Press gave Bobby that territories are not to be mixed (through items or otherwise). During this time, Bobby realizes that the Bedoowan live a luxurious and lazy life, as they listen to music, relax on pillows, and eat, attended by the pallid, taciturn Novans. Also, technologically speaking, the Bedoowan are years ahead of the Milago with inventions and devices including dumbwaiters, running water, and artificial light. After rescuing Press, Bobby learns that bringing items from Second Earth turns out to be a mistake. While Bobby was sleeping in a mine ventilation shaft before the rescue attempt, a homely merchant of the Milago by the name of Figgis had stolen a flashlight from Bobby's bag. When Bobby, Loor, Alder, and the newly rescued Press return to the Milago village, they discover that Figgis, the native merchant, had been selling tak, an unstable explosive that is to be used as a weapon to free themselves from Bedoowan rule. The final component to build a weapon that will destroy the Bedoowan (and probably all of the Milago village, though the Milago are willing to take that risk) is the battery and the switch from the flashlight, which Bobby accidentally supplied. Their plan was to present the tak bomb to the Bedoowan during the transfer ceremony (where the Bedoowan receive the glaze), disguised as a rather large mine cart of glaze, and destroy the remaining Bedoowan with smaller amounts of tak. Bobby, Loor, Alder, and Press manage to stop the chief miner Rellin from setting the bomb off, and all the Bedoowan and the Novans evacuate to a field, where the battle between the Milago and the Bedoowan is to take place. Before this, though, Bobby and Loor are faced with the task of getting rid of the bomb. After waking up some of the quigs, which were in a pen off to the side of the stadium in which they were presenting the glaze ( and tak), and having Loor open the pen door, the quigs rush out and slaughter some of the men there. Right before Relin set the bomb Uncle Press nails a spear into his arm. Rellin lies there struggling. Uncle Press picks up the bomb to disarm it and then he realizes that the quigs were getting the upper hand. He took desperate measures and threw the switch with some tak into the quig's mouth. It left the quig in little bits. Afterwards, Bobby and Loor use water to liquidate it and spread it across the field. The bomb is gone except for one small ball, which Bobby slips into his pocket. At this point, Figgis the merchant lures Bobby and Loor into the mines, where they find an immense supply of tak. They soon realize that Figgis is really Saint Dane. The real Figgis died when one of his own traps backfired. Disguised as Figgis, Saint Dane sold the tak to the Milago, urging them to rebel against the Bedoowan. At the same time, Saint Dane has disguised himself as Mallos, Queen Kagan's chief adviser, and had turned Bedoowan minds further against their neighbors. The traps that the real Figgis set trap Bobby and Loor with Saint Dane in the mine. Seeing it is the only way out, Bobby throws his small ball of tak at the large supply, which ignites the tak and will cause all of it to explode underground. Saint Dane escapes the impending destruction by using the flume in the mine to go to the territory of Cloral. By sending a high speed wave of water and a giant shark back through the flume, Bobby can't follow. To make matters worse for Bobby, the water knocked Loor against the wall of the cavern knocking her unconscious. Bobby just manages to escape the explosion by pushing a mine cart that held the unconscious Loor into the ocean through a ventilation shaft. When Bobby swims back to the shore and surveys the damage, they find that although the explosion had effected much destruction, most of the people are still alive, including Uncle Press and Alder. The castle, symbolic of Bedoowan rule over the Milago, falls into the ocean because of the force of the explosion, most of the Milago huts are destroyed, and the glaze mines are forever closed. Thus, the two tribes can use their best strengths to rebuild and improve each other's lives (Milago-farming and building and Bedoowan-engineering and chemistry). Bobby travels back to Second Earth with Uncle Press, hoping to find his family and carry on with his former life. Unfortunately, he soon learns that his house and family have disappeared, leaving not even a trace to show that Bobby had once lived there, so he decides to travel to Cloral and continue his mission to avert Saint Dane's evil mission. We, as the reader are privy to Saint Dane and Bobby's struggle against each other. These two people are fighting for Halla, the universe and whether or not it should be kept stable or be destroyed. While all this is going on for Bobby, his friends Courtney Chetwynde and Mark Dimond are on the receiving end of his Traveler journals, through a Traveler ring that Osa gave Mark in the middle of one night. Following the advice of Osa, Bobby and Loor are using their spare time to write logs of their journeys, which are sent to their respective home territories via the Traveler rings. These rings are made of the same stone which lines the flume; when the desired territory is named, the ring becomes a minuscule version of the flume, through which the journals are dropped. Although initially reluctant to believe the astonishing story, Mark and Courtney accept it in time. They soon have no choice; Bobby's family, his home, and all record of his existence have vanished without a trace. Only memory remains. When Bobby returns, he too must face this difficult fact. As his Uncle Press sets off for the territory of Cloral, Bobby goes with him to fulfill his duties as a Traveler.

He also became famous for his outrageous customized automobiles. Early life Kotlyarenko was born in Kiev on December 15, 1902, to a Ukrainian Jewish family. To escape the pogroms of Czarist Russia, his parents sent him at age 11, with his brother, Julius, to America. For a time he criss-crossed the country, working as a shoeshine boy and later a boxer, and hanging out, he later claimed, with the gangster Pretty Boy Floyd. While living in a boardinghouse in Mankato, Minnesota, he met Helen \\"Bobbie\\" Kruger, and married her in 1934. In the midst of the Great Depression the newlyweds moved to New York City and opened their first store, \\"Nudie's for the Ladies\\", specializing in custom-made undergarments for showgirls. Clothing business Porter Wagoner performing at the Grand Ole Opry in a Nudie suit, 1999 Country Music Hall of Fame Cohn and Kruger relocated to California in the early 1940s, and began designing and manufacturing clothing in their garage. In 1947 Cohn persuaded a young, struggling country singer named Tex Williams to buy him a sewing machine with the proceeds of an auctioned horse. In exchange, Cohn made clothing for Williams. As their creations gained a following, the Cohns opened \\"Nudie's of Hollywood\\" on the corner of Victory and Vineland in North Hollywood, dealing exclusively in western wear, a style very much in fashion at the time. Cohn's designs brought the already-flamboyant western style to a new level of ostentation with the liberal use of rhinestones and themed images in chain stitch embroidery. One of his early designs, in 1962, for singer Porter Wagoner, was a peach-colored suit featuring rhinestones, a covered wagon on the back, and wagon wheels on the legs. He offered the suit to Wagoner for free, confident that the popular performer (like Tex Williams) would serve as a billboard for his clothing line. His confidence proved justified and the business grew rapidly. In 1963 the Cohns relocated their business to a larger facility on Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood and renamed it \\"Nudie's Rodeo Tailors\\". Many of Cohn's 'Nudie suit' designs became signature looks for their owners. Among his most famous creations was Elvis Presley's $10,000 gold lam√© suit worn by the singer on the cover of his 50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong album. Cohen created Hank Williams' white cowboy suit with musical notations on the sleeves, and Gram Parsons' infamous suit for the cover of the Flying Burrito Brothers' 1969 album The Gilded Palace of Sin, featuring pills, poppies, marijuana leaves, naked women, and a huge cross. He designed the iconic costume worn by Robert Redford in the 1979 film Electric Horseman, which was exhibited by the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. Many of the film costumes worn by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were Nudie designs. John Lennon was a customer, as were John Wayne, Gene Autry, George Jones, Cher, Ronald Reagan, Elton John, Nicky Panicci, Robert Mitchum, Pat Buttram, Tony Curtis, Michael Landon, Glen Campbell, Michael Nesmith, Hank Snow, Hank Thompson, and numerous musical groups, notably America and Chicago. ZZ Top band members Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill sported Nudie suits on the cover photo of their 1975 album Fandango!. In 2006, Porter Wagoner said he had accumulated 52 Nudie suits, costing between $11,000 and $18,000 each, since receiving his first free outfit in 1962.

His sartorial trademark was mismatched boots, which he wore, he said, to remember his humble beginnings in the 1930s when he could not afford a matching pair of shoes. He shamelessly promoted himself and his products throughout his career. According to his granddaughter, Jamie Lee Nudie (a self-promoter in her own right who changed her last name to her grandfather's first name), he would often pay for items with dollar bills sporting a sticker of his face covering George Washington's. \\"When you get sick of looking at me,\\" he would say, \\"just rip [the sticker] off and spend it.\\" Automobiles Cohn was equally famous for his garishly decorated automobiles. Between 1950 and 1975 he customized 18 vehicles, mostly white Pontiac Bonneville convertibles, with silver-dollar- studded dashboards, pistol door handles and gearshifts, extended rear bumpers, and enormous longhorn steer horn hood ornaments. They were nicknamed \\"Nudie Mobiles\\", and the nine surviving cars have become valued collector's items. A Bonneville convertible designed for country singer Webb Pierce is on display at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee. A Pontiac Grand Ville convertible customized by Nudie can be seen at the end of the 1988 Buck Owens/Dwight Yoakam music video, \\"The Streets of Bakersfield.\\" That same car‚Äîwhich Owens's manager claims was originally built for Elvis Presley‚Äînow hangs over the bar inside Buck Owens's Crystal Palace in Bakersfield, California. Two Nudie Mobiles owned by Schoepen remain on display at Bobbejaanland, a Western-themed amusement park near Brussels.Schoepen, T. Bobbejaan (The Ultimate Book of his Life and Work). Belgium, Uitgeverij Kannibaal, 2011. Death and legacy Nudie Cohn died in 1984 at the age of 81. Numerous celebrities and long-time customers attended his funeral. The eulogy was delivered by Dale Evans. Nudie's Rodeo Tailors remained open for an additional ten years under the ownership of Nudie's widow Bobbie and granddaughter Jamie, and closed in 1994. Cohn's creations, particularly those with celebrity provenance, remain popular with Country/Western and show business collectors, and continue to command high prices when they come on the market. In December 2009, for example, a white Nudie stage shirt owned by Roy Rogers, decorated with blue tassels and red musical notes, sold for $16,250 at a Christie's auction.Lot 14, Sale 2276 (December 3, 2009).

A Birkeland current is a set of currents that flow along geomagnetic field lines connecting the Earth's magnetosphere to the Earth's high latitude ionosphere. In the Earth's magnetosphere, the currents are driven by the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field and by bulk motions of plasma through the magnetosphere (convection indirectly driven by the interplanetary environment). The strength of the Birkeland currents changes with activity in the magnetosphere (e.g. during substorms). Small scale variations in the upward current sheets (downward flowing electrons) accelerate magnetospheric electrons which, when they reach the upper atmosphere, create the Auroras Borealis and Australis. In the high latitude ionosphere (or auroral zones), the Birkeland currents close through the region of the auroral electrojet, which flows perpendicular to the local magnetic field in the ionosphere. The Birkeland currents occur in two pairs of field-aligned current sheets. One pair extends from noon through the dusk sector to the midnight sector. The other pair extends from noon through the dawn sector to the midnight sector. The sheet on the high latitude side of the auroral zone is referred to as the Region 1 current sheet and the sheet on the low latitude side is referred to as the Region 2 current sheet. The currents were predicted in 1908 by Norwegian explorer and physicist Kristian Birkeland, who undertook expeditions north of the Arctic Circle to study the aurora. He rediscovered, using simple magnetic field measurement instruments, that when the aurora appeared the needles of magnetometers changed direction, confirming the findings of Anders Celsius and assistant Olof Hjorter more than a century before. This could only imply that currents were flowing in the atmosphere above. He theorized that somehow the Sun emitted a cathode ray, out-of-print, full text online and corpuscles from what is now known as a solar wind entered the Earth's magnetic field and created currents, thereby creating the aurora. This view was scorned by other researchers, but in 1967 a satellite, launched into the auroral region, showed that the currents posited by Birkeland existed. In honour of him and his theory these currents are named Birkeland currents. A good description of the discoveries by Birkeland is given in the book by Jago. Professor Emeritus of the Alfv√©n Laboratory in Sweden, Carl-Gunne F√§lthammar wrote: \\"A reason why Birkeland currents are particularly interesting is that, in the plasma forced to carry them, they cause a number of plasma physical processes to occur (waves, instabilities, fine structure formation). These in turn lead to consequences such as acceleration of charged particles, both positive and negative, and element separation (such as preferential ejection of oxygen ions). Both of these classes of phenomena should have a general astrophysical interest far beyond that of understanding the space environment of our own Earth.\\" Auroral-like Birkeland currents created by scientist Kristian Birkeland in his terrella, featuring a magnetised anode globe in an evacuated chamber. Characteristics Auroral Birkeland currents carry about 100,000 amperes during quiet times and more than 1 million amperes during geomagnetically disturbed times. Birkeland had estimated currents \\"at heights of several hundred kilometres, and strengths of up to a million amperes\\" in 1908. The ionospheric currents that connect the field-aligned currents give rise to Joule heating in the upper atmosphere. The heat is transferred from the ionospheric plasma to the gas of the upper atmosphere, which consequently rises and increases drag on low-altitude satellites. Birkeland currents can also be created in the laboratory with multi-terawatt pulsed power generators. The resulting cross-section pattern indicates a hollow beam of electrons in the form of a circle of vortices, a formation called the diocotron instabilityPlasma phenomena - instabilities (similar to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability), that subsequently leads to filamentation. Such vortices can be seen in aurora as \\"auroral curls\\".Pseudo-color, white-light images of curl formations in auroral arcs Birkeland currents are also one of a class of plasma phenomena called a z-pinch, so named because the azimuthal magnetic fields produced by the current pinches the current into a filamentary cable. This can also twist, producing a helical pinch that spirals like a twisted or braided rope, and this most closely corresponds to a Birkeland current. Pairs of parallel Birkeland currents will also interact due to Amp√®re's force law: parallel Birkeland currents moving in the same direction will attract each other with an electromagnetic force inversely proportional to their distance apart whilst parallel Birkeland currents moving in opposite directions will repel each other. There is also a short-range circular component to the force between two Birkeland currents that is opposite to the longer-range parallel forces.Electromagnetic Forces Electrons moving along a Birkeland current may be accelerated by a plasma double layer. If the resulting electrons approach the speed of light, they may subsequently produce a Bennett pinch, which in a magnetic field causes the electrons to spiral and emit synchrotron radiation that may include radio, visible light, x-rays, and gamma rays. History Kristian Birkeland predicted the auroral electrojets in 1908. He wrote p. 95 \\"the currents there are imagined as having come into existence mainly as a secondary effect of the electric corpuscles from the sun drawn in out of space, and thus far come under the second of the possibilities mentioned above\\". And p. 105, \\"Fig. 50a represents those in which the current-directions at the storm-centre are directed westwards, and 50b those in which the currents move eastwards\\". After Kristian Birkeland first suggested in 1908 that \\"currents there [in the aurora] are imagined as having come into existence mainly as a secondary effect of the electric corpuscles from the sun drawn in out of space,\\" the story appears to have become mired in politics. Birkeland's ideas were generally ignored in favor of an alternative theory from British mathematician Sydney Chapman.S. Chapman and J. Bartels, ‚Äò‚ÄôGeomagnetism,‚Äô‚Äô Vol. 1 and 2, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1940. In 1939, the Swedish Engineer and plasma physicist Hannes Alfv√©n promoted Birkeland's ideas in a paperAlfv√©n, Hannes (1939), \\"Theory of Magnetic Storms and of the Aurorae\\", K. Sven. Vetenskapsakad. Handl., ser. 3, vol. 18, no. 3, p. 1, 1939. Reprinted in part, with comments by A. J. Dessler and J. Wilcox, in Eos, Trans. Am. Geophys. Un., vol. 51, p. 180, 1970. published on the generation of the current from the Solar Wind. In 1964 one of Alfv√©n's colleagues, Rolf Bostr√∂m, also used field-aligned currents in a new model of auroral electrojets. Proof of Birkeland's theory of the aurora only came after a probe was sent into space. The crucial results were obtained from U.S. Navy satellite 1963-38C, launched in 1963 and carrying a magnetometer above the ionosphere. In 1966 Alfred Zmuda, J.H. Martin, and F.T.Heuring analysed the satellite magnetometer results and reported their findings of magnetic disturbance in the aurora. In 1967 Alex Dessler and graduate student David Cummings wrote an article arguing that Zmuda et al. had detected field-aligned currents. Alfv√©n subsequently acknowledged that Dessler had \\"discovered the currents that Birkeland had predicted\\" and they should be called Birkeland- Dessler currents. 1967 is therefore taken as the date when Birkeland's theory was finally acknowledged to have been vindicated. In 1969 Milo Schield, Alex Dessler and John Freeman used the name \\"Birkeland currents\\" for the first time. In 1970 Zmuda, Armstrong and Heuring wrote another paper agreeing that their observations were compatible with field-aligned currents as suggested by Cummings and Dessler and by Bostr√∂m.

Common abbreviations are WD and Op. for Opera. is a didactic poem written by the ancient Greek poet Hesiod around 700 BC. It is in dactylic hexameter and contains 828 lines. At its center, the Works and Days is a farmer's almanac in which Hesiod instructs his brother Perses in the agricultural arts. Scholars have seen this work against a background of agrarian crisis in mainland Greece, which inspired a wave of colonial expeditions in search of new land. In the poem Hesiod also offers his brother extensive moralizing advice on how he should live his life. The Works and Days is perhaps best known for its two mythological aetiologies for the toil and pain that define the human condition: the story of Prometheus and Pandora, and the so-called Myth of Five Ages. Synopsis In the Works and Days, Hesiod describes himself as the heir of a farm bequeathed to him and his brother Perses. However, Perses apparently squandered his wealth and came back for what is owned by Hesiod. Perses went to law and bribed the lords to judge in his favour. The poem contains a sharp attack against unjust judges like those who decided in favour of Perses; they are depicted as pocketing bribes as they render their unfair verdicts. Hesiod seems to have thought that instead of giving him money or property which he will again spend in no time, it is better to teach him the virtues of work and to impart his wisdom which can be used to generate an income. Like the Theogony, the Works and Days begins with a hymnic invocation to the Muses, albeit much shorter (10 lines to the Theogony's 115) and with a different focus. The poet invokes the \\"Pierian Muses\\" to sing of their father Zeus and his control of the fates of mankind. Through the power of Zeus men might be famous or nameless; he easily strengthens and oppresses the strong, reduces the conspicuous and raises up the inconspicuous; easily he straightens the crooked and withers the many.Works and Days 3‚Äì8. Hesiod then appeals to Zeus to guide his undertaking: \\"Hearken, seeing and hearing, and through justice put straight the laws; and may I speak the truth to Perses.\\" Engraving of the myth of Pandora based on a painting by F. S. Church Hesiod begins the poem proper by directly engaging with the content of the Theogony. There was after all not one Eris (, \\"Strife\\") as in that poem,Cf. Theog. 225‚Äì6. but two: one is quite blameworthy and provokes wars and disagreement among mankind; but the other is commended by all who know her, for she compels men to work honorably, rivaling each other:WD 11‚Äì26. Hesiod encourages Perses to avoid the bad Eris, and not let her persuade him to frequent the arguments in the agora, but to focus on working for his livelihood.WD 27‚Äì34. Family business follows, as Hesiod implores his brother to join him in sorting out their fraternal discord through the \\"justice of Zeus\\". It comes out that they had previously divided their patrimony, but that Perses claimed more than his fair share by influencing \\"bribe-devouring kings\\" (, d≈çrophagoi basileis).WD 35‚Äì9. The following few hundred verses‚Äîby far the most famous portion of the poem‚Äîcomprise a series of mythological examples and gnomic statements outlining Hesiod's conception of justice and the necessity of work with the ostensible goal of persuading Perses to follow a proper path in life. The first lesson is why the immortals keep an easy livelihood hidden from mankind: the story of Prometheus and Pandora is the answer. In the Theogony, Pandora and the \\"tribe of women\\" had been sent as a plague upon man in punishment for Prometheus's attempt to deceive Zeus of his deserved portion when men and gods were dividing a feast, and for his subsequent theft of fire.Theog. 535‚Äì70. In the Works and Days Hesiod proceeds directly to the theft of fire and punishment. Zeus instructed the gods to build an \\"evil\\" for mankind: that is, Pandora, whom Prometheus's brother Epimetheus accepted from Hermes despite his brother's warnings never to accept gifts from the gods.WD 59‚Äì89. Before Pandora's arrival, man had lived free from evils, toil and illness, but she had been given a jar which contained all these curses; this she opened, releasing all its contents but Elpis (, \\"Hope\\" or \\"Expectation\\").WD 90‚Äì105. There is some debate about the simple and obvious translation of \\"elpis\\" as \\"hope\\". Some scholars argue that is really should be translated as \\"expectation\\" since the root word is from \\"suppose\\". And in this context it is argued that what was left in the jar was not Hope as we know it, but the \\"expectation of ills\\" so that Man would be unpleasantly surprised by ills that befell him instead of expecting them. Confer W.J. Verdenius, Commentary on Hesiod, et al. Also written in Tandy and Neale's translation of Works and Days. p.64, note 37. Lucas Cranach the Elder, The Golden Age (c. 1530) The Myth of the Ages follows.WD 106‚Äì201. In the Hesiodic scheme there were five ages of mankind: the Golden Age, Silver Age, Bronze Age, Heroic Age, and the present age, that of Iron. Race of gold man lived in the time of Cronus, an age of plenty and peace, for the earth gave for all their needs of its own accord and rivalries of any kind were thus unknown. Golden Age man never aged, and when they died they went as though to sleep. When this age came to an end, its population became guardians of mankind, protecting them from evils and granting them wealth.WD 109‚Äì26. The Silver Age was much worse than the Golden, both in stature and temperament. They lived as children with their mothers for a hundred years. Once they came of age, they lived but a brief time, suffering because of their foolishness. They fought with one another and did not mind the gods. Angry at their impiety, Zeus destroyed the race; still, they are granted the honor of being called \\"chthonic blessed mortals\\".WD 127‚Äì42. The Bronze Race was fearsome and warlike. Their weapons were bronze, they lived in bronze houses, and they wore bronze armour; black iron did not exist yet. They fell at each other's hands and came to an inglorious end.WD 143‚Äì55. The race of heroes was more just and noble. Though demigods, they too fell in war, most notably those at Thebes and Troy. After death they were transported to the Isles of the Blessed where they lived a postmortem life of plenty similar to the Golden Age.WD 156‚Äì73. Hesiod then laments that he lived during the Iron Age, which is characterized by toil and hardship. He predicts that Zeus will destroy his race, too, when men are born gray-haired and all moral and religious standards are ignored. Aidos and Nemesis will depart the earth, leaving behind ills against which there will be no bulwark.WD 174‚Äì201. The kings are now addressed, as Hesiod relates the fable of the nightingale and the hawk to them. A hawk flying high in the air had a nightingale in its talons. The smaller bird was shrieking and crying, to which the hawk responded:  Select editions and translations  = Critical editions = * .

Life He was born in Birmingham on 22 April 1814, the son of Thomas Pole. Pole was apprenticed as an engineer to Charles H. Capper in Birmingham around 1828. He then went to India in 1844 as professor of engineering at Elphinstone College, Bombay, where he had organized a course of instruction for Indian students; his health obliged him to return to England in 1848. For the next ten years he worked in London under James Simpson and James Meadows Rendel, and was appointed in 1859 to the chair of civil engineering at University College, London. With official work from the government, he served on committees which considered the application of armour to ships and fortifications (1861‚Äì1864), and the comparative advantages of Whitworth and Armstrong guns (1863‚Äì1865). Pole was secretary to the Royal Commission on Railways (1865‚Äì1867), the Duke of Richmond's Commission on London Water (1867‚Äì1869), also taking part in the subsequent proceedings for establishing a constant supply, the Royal Commission on the Disposal of London Sewage (1882‚Äì1884), and the departmental committee on the science museums at South Kensington in 1885. In 1871 he was employed by the War Office to report on the Martini-Henry rifle, and in the same year was appointed consulting engineer in London to the Japanese government, a position through which he exercised considerable influence on the development of the Japanese railway system. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1861, in recognition of some investigations on color-blindness. Music was also one of his chief interests. At the age of twenty-two he was appointed organist of St Marks, North Audley Street in London, in open competition, the next selected candidate being Dr E. J. Hopkins (1818‚Äì1901), who subsequently was for fifty years organist of the Temple Church. He took the degree of Bachelor of Music at Oxford in 1860, proceeding to his doctors degree in 1867, and in 1879 published his Philosophy of Music. He was largely concerned in the institution of musical degrees by the University of London in 1877, and for many years acted as one of the examiners. His mathematical tastes found congenial occupation in the study of whist, and as a contemporary to Cavendish, he was an exponent of the scientific principles and history of the game. His literary work included treatises on the steam engine and on iron construction, biographical studies of famous engineers, including Robert Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Sir William Fairbairn and Sir William Siemens, several books on musical subjects and on whist, and many papers for reviews and scientific periodicals. In 1877 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were all civil engineers: David Stevenson, Sir John Hawkshaw, James Leslie and Henry Charles Fleeming Jenkin. He died at home, 9 Stanhope Place near Hyde Park in London on 30 December 1900. Family Pole married Matilda Gauntlett (died 1900), daughter of Henry Gauntlett. Their son, also William Pole but changing his name to William Poel (1852‚Äì1934), became known as an actor and writer, and for his studies in Shakespearian drama and in connection with the Elizabethan Stage Society.

The epithet 'black' derives from a widespread feeling amongst labour radicals that the decision amounted to a breach of solidarity and a betrayal of the miners. Triple Alliance In the 1890s and the first two decades of the 20th century, increasing efforts were made to bring about amalgamations of small, local trade unions and to forge links between different organisations, with a view to securing united action. The National Transport Workers' Federation was created in 1910 to co-ordinate the actions of trade unions representing dockers, seamen, tramwaymen and others and in 1912 the National Union of Railwaymen was created as an amalgamation of a large number of local and sectional organisations representing rail workers. In 1914, the rail and transport unions came together with the Miners' Federation of Great Britain to form the Triple Alliance. Although the agreements did not constitute a binding agreement, the formation of the alliance was recognised as a vehicle for united action by the largest and most powerful industrial groups. Mining crisis, March 1921 In the aftermath of the First World War, the Triple Alliance and united action in general were regarded by many trade unionists as a defence against the threat of wage reductions occasioned by the onset of economic depression. A complicating factor was that both the coal industry and railways had been controlled by the state during the war and were not immediately returned to private hands. The Coalition-Liberal Government of David Lloyd George was unwilling to impose wage reductions, as this would provoke strike action against the government, with political implications. Reductions for miners were postponed until the industry was de-controlled on 31 March 1921. Miners who refused to accept the reductions were locked out of employment. Decision Following the imposition of the reductions, it was widely expected that the transport and rail unions would strike in support of the miners. However, on 15 April, the executives of the NTWF and NUR announced that they would not recommend strike action. One reason cited by the union leaders was that the miners' representatives had made comments suggesting that they, themselves, were not prepared to strike against the reductions. More broadly, transport and rail union leaders accused the MFGB of expecting support from other unions but refusing to involve those unions in negotiations over the dispute. The principal seamen's union, the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union held a ballot which resulted in the proposal for strike action being defeated by 59 votes. Aftermath Despite the decision against fully- fledged strike action, transport and railworkers were ordered not to handle imported coal. Some workers were unhappy with this limited action. In Glasgow, for example, the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers broke with the policy of the Transport Workers' Federation and called its members out on strike on 7 May. On the same day, wage reductions were imposed on merchant seamen, leading to a well-supported general strike at the docks which lasted for over a month. Transport and rail leaders were widely criticised for their actions, with J. H. Thomas of the NUR and Robert Williams of the NTWF being singled out for particular criticism. For their part, union leaders pointed to the difficulties of resisting the wage reductions in a period which had a lot of unemployment, alleged that there was little support for sympathy action amongst rank-and-file dockers and railwaymen and argued that the involvement of other workers would only lead to needless sacrifices on their part. Williams was expelled from the Communist Party following this.\\"Williams, Robert\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In 1925, when the government agreed to grant a temporary subsidy to the mining industry so as to avoid wage reductions, the day on which the decision was announced became known as Red Friday, in imitation of Black Friday.National Archive, The Cabinet Papers, Strike build up References Category:1921 labor disputes and strikes Category:History of mining in the United Kingdom Category:National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain) Category:Labour disputes in the United Kingdom Category:1921 in the United Kingdom Category:British trade unions history Category:April 1921 events ","title":"Black Friday (1921)"},{"id":"2621352","text":"The Siege of Pensacola was a siege fought in 1781, the culmination of Spain's conquest of the British province of West Florida during the Gulf Coast campaign. Background When Spain entered the War in 1779, Bernardo de G√°lvez, the energetic governor of Spanish Louisiana, immediately began offensive operations to gain control of British West Florida beginning with his assault at Fort Bute. In September 1779 he gained complete control over the lower Mississippi River by capturing Fort Bute and then shortly thereafter obtaining the surrender of the remaining forces following the Battle of Baton Rouge. He followed up these successes with the capture of Mobile on March 14, 1780, after a brief siege. G√°lvez began planning an assault on Pensacola, West Florida's capital, using forces from Havana, with the recently captured Mobile as the launching point for the attack. British reinforcements arriving in Pensacola in April 1780 delayed the expedition, however, and when an invasion fleet finally sailed in October, it was dispersed by a hurricane a few days later. G√°lvez spent nearly a month regrouping the fleet at Havana.Bense (1999), p. 36 =British defenses= Following the outbreak of hostilities with Spain 1779, General John Campbell, concerned over the condition of the defenses, requested reinforcements, and began construction of additional defenses. By early 1781, the Pensacola garrison consisted of the 16th Regiment, a battalion from the 60th, and 7 (Johnstones) Company of the 4th Battalion Royal Artillery (Present day 20 Battery Royal Artillery, 16 Regiment Royal Artillery). These were augmented by the Third Regiment of Waldeck and The Maryland Loyalist Battalion, as well as the Pennsylvania Loyalists. These troops were provincial soldiers, rather than militia. In addition to the Loyalist soldiers, some bands of Indians supported the British. After the fall of Mobile in March 1780, between 1,500-2,000 Indians had come at various points to Pensacola to join in its defense. These allies included Choctaws and Creeks, with Creeks being the most numerous. Just before the Spanish attack only 800 Indian braves remained in Pensacola, as Campbell, not realizing the attack was imminent, had sent about 300 away. During the siege and battle there were ultimately only about 500 of these left at Pensacola, due to two- faced efforts of the Muscogee Creeks to take a more \\"balanced\\" role by offering supplies to both sides and diminishing their role on the British side. The majority of the warrior bands still present during the siege were Choctaw. G√°lvez had received detailed descriptions of the state of the defenses in 1779, when he sent an aide there ostensibly to discuss the return of escaped slaves, although Campbell had made numerous changes since then. Pensacola's defensive works in early 1781 consisted of Fort George, an earthen works topped by a palisade that was rebuilt under Campbell's directions in 1780. North of the fort he had built the Prince of Wales Redoubt, and to its northwest was the Queen's Redoubt, also built in 1780.Kaufmann (2004), p. 131 Campbell erected a battery called Fort Barrancas Colorada near the mouth of the bay. =Spanish Forces= A 1763 map depicting Pensacola Bay G√°lvez embarked his flag with the Spanish fleet, under the command of Captain Jos√© Calvo de Irazabal. With about 1,300 men, the regular troops included a Majorcan regiment and Arturo O'Neill (later Governor of Spanish West and East Florida) commanding 319 men of Spain's Irish Hibernia Regiment, and including militias of biracial and free Afro-Cubans.Kuethe pp. 41-42 G√°lvez had also ordered additional troops from New Orleans and Mobile to assist. The Spanish expeditionary force sailed from Havana on February 13. Arriving outside Pensacola Bay on March 9, G√°lvez landed some troops on Santa Rosa Island, the barrier island protecting the bay. O'Neill's Hibernians landed at the island battery, which he found undefended, and landed artillery, which he used to drive away the British ships taking shelter in the bay. However, bringing the Spanish ships into the bay turned out to be difficult, just as it had been the previous year at the capture of Mobile. Supplies were offloaded onto Santa Rosa Island to raise the draft of some of the ships, but Calvo, the fleet commander, refused to send any more ships through the channel after the lead ship, the 64-cannon San Ramon, grounded in its attempt. Furthermore, some British guns seemed to have the range to fire on the bay's entrance. G√°lvez used his authority as Governor of Louisiana to commandeer the ships that were from Louisiana. He boarded the G√°lveztown, and on March 18 he sailed her through the channel and into the bay. The three other Louisiana ships followed him, under what proved to be ineffective British artillery fire. After sending Calvo a detailed description of the channel, his captains all insisted on making the crossing, which they did the next day. Calvo, claiming that his assignment to deliver G√°lvez' invasion force was now complete, sailed back to Havana in the San Ramon.Dupuy (1977), p. 151 Siege On March 24, the Spanish army and its accompany militia moved to the center of operations. O'Neill served as aide-decamp and commander of the scout patrols. Once the bay had been entered, O'Neill's scouts landed on the mainland and blunted an attack by 400 mainly pro-British Choctaw Indians on the afternoon of March 28. The scouts soon joined forces with the Spanish troops arriving from Mobile. The Spanish forces led by Bernardo de G√°lvez at the battle. Oil on canvas, Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau, 2015. During the first weeks of April, O'Neill's Irish scouts reconnoitered the Pensacola fortifications. The redoubt farthest from the city was the Crescent. Next distant was the Sombrero, followed by Fort George. The Spanish troops established encampments and began extensive preparations for a siege. Hundreds of engineers and laborers brought supplies and armaments to the battlefield.G√°lvez p. 26 The engineers also dug trenches, and built bunkers and redoubts, besides constructing a covered road to shield the troops from the constant fire of grapeshot, grenades, and cannonballs.G√°lvez p. 20 On April 12, G√°lvez himself was wounded while viewing the British fortifications. Battlefield command was formally transferred to Colonel Jos√© de Ezpeleta, a personal friend of G√°lvez.Mart√≠n-Mer√°s p. 82 A second attack by the Choctaws began on April 19, interrupting the siege preparations, and that day a large fleet was sighted heading towards the bay. Although at first thought to be bringing British reinforcements, the ships turned out to be the combined Spanish and French fleet from Havana commanded by Jos√© Solano y Bote and Fran√ßois-Aymar de Monteil, having on board Spanish Field Marshal Juan Manuel de Cagigal. Reports of a British squadron sighted near Cape San Antonio had reached Havana, and reinforcements had been sent to G√°lvez. The Spanish ships carried a total of 1,700 sailors and 1,600 soldiers, bringing the total Spanish force at Pensacola to an unstoppable 8,000 men.Mart√≠n-Mer√°s, p. 85 Solano decided to remain to assist G√°lvez after the disembarkation of the troops, and the two men worked closely together. A 1783 engraving depicting the exploding magazine On April 24, a third Choctaw attack caught the Spanish napping. Five Spanish were wounded, including O‚ÄôNeill's cousin, Sublieutenant Felipe O'Reilly. Two days later, soldiers from the Queens Redoubt attacked Spanish positions, but were driven back by O'Neill's scouts. On April 30, the Spanish batteries opened fire, signalling the start of the full-scale attack on Pensacola. However, the Gulf was now experiencing tempestuous storms, and a hurricane struck the Spanish ships on May 5 and 6. The Spanish fleet had to be withdrawn, for fear the seas would wreck the ships on the shore. The army remained to continue the siege, even though the trenches were flooded. G√°lvez issued them a daily ration of brandy to keep up their spirits.Mitchell p. 104 In early May, G√°lvez was surprised to receive chiefs of the Tallapoosa Creeks, who came offering to supply the Spanish army with meat. G√°lvez arranged the purchase of beef cattle from them, and also requested that they appeal to the British-allied Creeks and Choctaws to cease their attacks. On May 8, a howitzer shell struck the magazine in Fort Crescent, exploding it and sending black smoke billowing. Fifty-seven British troops were killed by the devastating blast, and Ezpeleta quickly led the light infantry in a charge to take the stricken fort. The Spanish moved howitzers and cannons into what remained of it and opened fire on the next two British forts. Pensacola's defenders returned fired from Fort George, but were soon overwhelmed by the massive Spanish firepower. Two days later, realizing his final line of fortification could not survive the barrage, General John Campbell reluctantly surrendered Fort George and Prince of Wales Redoubt. The garrison raised a white flag over Fort George at 3 in the afternoon of May 10, 1781. More than 1,100 British and colonial troops were taken prisoner, and 200 casualties were sustained. The Spanish army lost 74 dead, with another 198 wounded.Caughey pp. 209-211 G√°lvez personally accepted the surrender, ending British sovereignty in West Florida. The Spanish fleet left Pensacola for Havana on June 1 to prepare assaults on the remaining British possessions in the Caribbean. G√°lvez appointed O'Neill the Spanish Governor of West Florida, and his Hibernia Regiment departed with the fleet. Aftermath Jos√© Solano y Bote in front of Santa Rosa Bay coming to the rescue of General G√°lvez The terms of capitulation included the entirety of British West Florida, the British garrison, large quantities of war material and supplies, and one British sloop of war.This was the 18-gun . The 18-gun sloop , the former Maryland privateer Who's Afraid, which the British had captured in 1779 off the Bahamas, had wrecked in March. Her crew had burnt her to prevent her capture. G√°lvez had the batteries and Fort Barrancas Coloradas moved nearer to the bay's entrance, and placed a battery on Santa Rosa Island against British attempts to recapture Pensacola. The Tallapoosa Muscogee Creek mission during the siege was probably connected with or even ordered by Alexander McGillivray, a mixed-race Creek trader. Although he was a Loyalist and held a British commission as a colonel, he was a longtime opponent of American colonial intrusions on Creek land. Raised as a Creek, though well educated in South Carolina, McGillivray was viewed by many Creeks a their leader. He supplied the British in Pensacola, and had organized the British Muskogee Creek contingents who fought alongside the Choctaws. He would become principal Chief of the Upper Creeks in 1783, who lived on the Tallapoosa River at Little Tallassee (near today's Montgomery, Alabama). His support for Spain later resulted in the 1784 Treaty of Pensacola, in which Spain guaranteed to respect Creek territory, in return for a Creek promise to stop raiding their neighbors, and disrupting trade. McGillivray personally negotiated the treaty and spent the rest of his life in Pensacola. The Spanish fleet took the British prisoners to Havana, from which they were sent to New York in a prisoner exchange, which angered the rebellious Americans. However, such exchanges were routine, and G√°lvez arranged the exchange to free Spanish soldiers and seamen from the brutal conditions on British prison ships. G√°lvez and his army were welcomed as heroes on their arrival in Havana on May 30. King Charles III promoted G√°lvez to lieutenant general, and he was made governor of both West Florida and Louisiana. The royal commendation stated that as G√°lvez alone forced the entrance to the Bay, he could place on his coat of arms the words Yo Solo.Caughey p. 214 Jos√© Solano y Bote was later recognized by King Charles III for coming to aid G√°lvez with the title Marques del Socorro. A painting of Solano now hanging in the Museo Naval de Madrid shows him with Santa Rosa Bay in the background. A British flag captured at Pensacola is displayed at the Spanish Army Museum in Toledo.

Return links are often, but not always, slower than the corresponding forward links. Examples where this is true include asymmetric digital subscriber line, cable modems, mobile broadband and satellite internet access. The return channel need not use the same medium as the main channel. For example, some hybrid Internet access services use a one-way cable television system for the forward channel and a dial-up modem for the return channel. Even when the return and forward channels use the same medium, their differences often dictate the use of very different data modulation and coding techniques. For example, in a star radio network, only the central hub transmits on the forward link, so channel access method is a consideration only on the return link. The \\"forward/return\\" terminology is also used for spacecraft command and telemetry links. Because the return link carries telemetry, often including imagery, it is often orders of magnitude faster than the forward link that transmits only a few predefined spacecraft commands. Return and forward channels are distinct from, and should not be confused with, uplinks and downlinks in satellite communication systems. For example, satellite internet access with conventional bent-pipe transponders require a total of two uplinks and two downlinks. One uplink and downlink pair are used for the forward link from the central ground hub through the satellite to the user terminal, and another uplink/downlink pair are used for the return link from the user terminal to the central hub.

Beginning after the death of Stalin in 1953, the government undertook the political and social restoration, or political rehabilitation, of persons who had been repressed and criminally prosecuted without due basis. It restored the person to the state of acquittal. In many cases, rehabilitation was posthumous, as thousands of victims had been executed or died in labor camps. The government also rehabilitated several minority populations which it had relocated under Stalin, and allowed them to return to their former territories and in some cases restored their autonomy in those regions. Post-Stalinism epoch The government started mass amnesty of the victims of Soviet repressions after the death of Joseph Stalin. In 1953, this did not entail any form of exoneration. The government released the amnestees into internal exile in remote areas, without any right to return to their original places of settlement. The amnesty was applied first for those who had been sentenced for a term of at most 5 years and had been prosecuted for non-political articles in the Soviet Criminal Code (for example, children of those repressed on political grounds were often prosecuted as \\"antisocial elements\\", i.e., on the same grounds as prostitutes). In 1954, the government began to release many political prisoners from Gulag labor camps. In 1956 Nikita Khrushchev, then in the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, denounced Stalinism in his notable speech On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences. Afterward, the government accompanied release of political prisoners with rehabilitation, allowing them to return home and reclaim their lives. Several entire nationality groups had been deported to Siberia, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia during population transfer; these were also rehabilitated in the late 1950s. The government allowed many of those groups to return to their former homelands and restored their former autonomous regions. It did not restore territory to the Volga Germans and Crimean Tatars.Robert Conquest, The Nation Killers: The Soviet Deportation of Nationalities (London: MacMillan, 1970) (); S. Enders Wimbush and Ronald Wixman, \\"The Meskhetian Turks: A New Voice in Central Asia,\\" Canadian Slavonic Papers 27, Nos. 2 and 3 (Summer and Fall, 1975): 320‚Äì340; and Alexander Nekrich, The Punished Peoples: The Deportation and Fate of Soviet Minorities at the End of the Second World War (New York: W. W. Norton, 1978) (). In most cases, the persons were released with the phrases \\"due to the lack of a criminal matter\\", \\"for lack of corpus delicti\\", \\"based on previously unavailable information\\", \\"due to the lack of a proof of guilt\\", etc. Many rehabilitations occurred posthumously, as thousands had been executed by Stalin's government or died in the harsh conditions of the labor camps. Many individuals were subject to amnesty only, but not to rehabilitation (in particular those who had been prosecuted for \\"belonging to Trotskyite Opposition\\"). Perestroika and post-Soviet states Another wave of rehabilitations started about 1986 with emerging Soviet policy of perestroika. Persons who were repressed extrajudicially were summarily rehabilitated. Also, Soviet civilian and military justice continued to rehabilitate victims of Stalin's purges (posthumously), as well as some people repressed after Stalin. After dissolution of the Soviet Union in late 1991, this trend continued in most post-Soviet states. Both the modern Russian Federation and Ukraine\\"Rehabilitation of victims of political repressions in Ukraine\\" , Law of Ukraine have enacted laws \\"On the Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repressions\\", which provide the basis for the continued post-Stalinist rehabilitation of victims.

It was owned by John Carter. Roger Craven and Dale Davis previously were co-owners of the team. Career The team made its debut in 2004 at the Coca-Cola 600, originally as an offshoot of the No. 89 Victory in Jesus racing team and working out of a shop previously occupied by Frank Cicci Racing with Jim Kelly. Todd Bodine was the driver, but the team failed to qualify for the race. After a DNQ the next week at Dover International Speedway, the team made the Pocono 500, but finished 42nd after suffering overheating problems. After finishing 36th at the DHL 400, Bodine left the team, and was replaced by Chad Blount. After failing to qualify for the Pepsi 400, Blount made the field at Chicagoland Speedway, where he finished last after suffering electrical failures. Andy Hillenburg and Stanton Barrett came on to attempt races with the team, but failed. Kevin Lepage took over at the Sharpie 500, and ran the rest of the season with the team, his best finish being 27th at Phoenix International Raceway. In 2005, the team signed sponsors BOSpoker.net and Patr√≥n Tequila and planned to run the full year. Lepage finished ninth in the Daytona 500 but was released midway through the season. After Anthony Lazzaro ran Watkins Glen, Tony Raines took over the ride, and led two laps at Michigan before running out of fuel in the final laps. Following his release after the UAW-Ford 500, Mike Skinner, Mike Garvey, and Jimmy Spencer shared the ride for the balance of the season. Blount returned to the No. 37 in 2006 for the Daytona 500, but missed the race. Skinner attempted most of the races with this season, along with Carl Long. In June 2006, a press release said Terance Mathis bought out the operation and renamed it Victory Motorsports, however only Dale Davis joined the ownership of the team. Skinner piloted the car at Indianapolis, and Bill Elliott started 39th and finished 16th at Kansas Speedway, the team's best showing to date. He ran an additional two races for the team, but did not finish higher 31st. The team ran the 2007 season after partnering with the Front Row Motorsports No. 61 team. Elliott attempted the 2007 Daytona 500 with the team, but failed to qualify and the Past Champion's Provisional went to Dale Jarrett, who was the more recent former series champion not in the Top 35. John Andretti successfully made the race the next week at California Speedway and finished 34th. The deal with Front Row Motorsports fell through, and the two teams are no longer associated, with Front Row Motorsports retaining the No. 37. The team was renamed to E&M; Motorsports and made its debut with Joe Nemechek, who had been released from Ginn Racing following its merger with Dale Earnhardt Inc.. When Nemechek found a ride with Furniture Row Racing, E&M; called upon Burney Lamar, but he DNQ'd all of his attempted races. It was announced on January 12, 2008 that Carl Long would pilot the teams No. 08 Dodge at the Daytona 500, but he failed to qualify. Tony Raines was the next driver to attempt to get the car in the field, however was unsuccessful in his attempts. Johnny Sauter joined the team and made the Pepsi 500 Race at Auto Club Speedway finishing 42nd. This was the team's first and only race to date that the team has qualified for. For the 2009 NASCAR season, E&M; Motorports signed James Hylton for the Daytona 500, and potentially more races later in the year. E&M; Motorsports and Simo Racing (formerly No Fear Racing) announced that the teams would form an alliance for the Daytona 500. The alliance, to be referred to as Carter/Simo Racing, saw Hylton and Boris Said temporarily change numbers. Simo's team fielded the No. 08 Ford for Said under E&M;'s ownership and E&M; fielded the No. 60 Dodge for Hylton under Simo's ownership. The No. 60 team had carburetor issues and was not able to run a lap at mandated practice speed, which under NASCAR rules prevented them from attempting to qualify. The No. 08 with Boris Said wrecked in his Gatorade Duel Race. In June 2009, Carter and Said announced they would again partner. The pair brought the No. 08 Ford to Infineon raceway attempting to qualify for the Toyota Save Mart 350. Said qualified the car, 9th and finished 24th. Although originally unsponsored the team secured a sponsorship through California Outdoor Heritage Alliance. On July 10, 2009, the team announced they had signed Terry Labonte and he would share driving duties with Boris Said. Despite still seeking a full-time sponsor, the team planned to run the remainder of the 2009 season starting July 26 at Indianapolis. On July 24, 2009, Carter Simo Racing announced it was purchasing the assets of the defunct Mayfield Motorsports team. With the purchase the team temporarily switched from Ford to Toyota, which Mayfield Motorsports was running. However, for the Heluva Good! Sour Cream Dips at The Glen in August the team returned Said to the car and switched manufacturers back to Ford. On February 3, 2010, it was announced that John Carter Racing, due to not finding sponsorship for the race team, would be auctioning off all the equipment, parts and haulers, and all three cars on February 16, 2010 by the auction company Iron Horse Auction.

Clay, a great friend of Arthur Sullivan's, wrote four comic operas with W. S. Gilbert and introduced the two men. While working as a civil servant in the Treasury department, Clay began composing seriously in the early 1860s. His first big success was Ages Ago (1869), a short comic opera with a libretto by W. S. Gilbert, for the small Gallery of Illustration. Other pieces with Gilbert and others followed, and Clay turned to composing full-time after his father died in 1873. That year, he composed a successful opera-bouffe version of The Black Crook for the Alhambra Theatre. Clay's last piece with Gilbert was Princess Toto (1875). He also composed two cantatas. His last two works were both successful operas composed in 1883, The Merry Duchess and The Golden Ring. He then suffered a stroke that paralysed him at age 44. Life and career Clay was born in Paris\\"Death of Sir Frederic Clay\\", The Birmingham Daily Post, 29 November 1889, p. 5 to English parents, James Clay (1804‚Äì1873), a member of parliament, and his wife, Eliza Camilla Woolrych. Clay was the fourth of six brothers and sisters. His father was celebrated as a player of whist and the author of a treatise on that subject, as well as an amateur composer. His mother also had a musical background, as her mother had been an opera singer.Knowles, Christopher. \\"Clay, Frederic Emes (1838‚Äì1889)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 10 October 2008 Clay was educated at home by private tutors in London, studying piano and violin, and then music composition under Bernhard Molique and, in 1863, with Moritz Hauptmann in Leipzig, Germany.Sullivan, Arthur. \\"Frederic Clay (1838‚Äì1889)\\", Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, reprinted at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive He then worked as a civil servant in the Treasury department while also pursuing composing.\\"Death of Mr Frederic Clay\\", The Era, 30 November 1889, p. 9 After the death of his father in 1873, his inheritance enabled him to become a full-time composer.Scowcroft, Philip L. A 101st Garland of British Light Music Composers, Classical Music Web, MusicWeb- International.com With the exception of some songs, hymns, instrumental pieces and two cantatas, his compositions were nearly all written for the stage. In the mid-1860s, Clay and his friend Arthur Sullivan became frequent guests at the home of John Scott Russell. By about 1865, Clay became engaged to Scott Russell's youngest daughter Alice, and Sullivan wooed the middle daughter Rachel. The Scott Russells welcomed the engagement of Alice to Clay, but he broke it off.Ainger, p. 87; Jacobs, p. 53. The Scott Russells forbade the relationship between Sullivan and Rachel, because Sullivan had uncertain financial prospects, although Rachel continued to see him covertly. At some point in 1868, Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with the eldest daughter, Louise, but both relationships had ceased by early 1869. =Early career= A scene from Ages Ago in The Illustrated London News Clay wrote his first short play for the amateur stage in 1859 called 'The Pirate's Isle, and completed the short comic play Out of Sight the following year. His first professionally produced piece was an opera entitled Court and Cottage, with a libretto by Tom Taylor, which was produced at Covent Garden Theatre in 1862. In 1865, for the same theatre, he composed another opera, the unsuccessful Constance (1865), with a libretto by Thomas William Robertson.G√§nzl, p. 16, says: \\"Constance was written to a rather 'heavy' libretto. ... It was a tale of love and patriotism set in Poland under the Russians ‚Äì something of a Polish Tosca, but with a happy ending when the hero and heroine are rescued first by a singing vivandiere and then by the Polish army. The music ... was noted as being promising if rather light and, after being performed eighteen times as a curtain-raiser to the Covent Garden pantomime of Cinderella, it sank into obscurity.\\" The score is available at the National Library of Scotland. With B. C. Stephenson, he wrote three pieces played by amateurs: The Pirate's Isle, Out of Sight and The Bold Recruit (1868), and with W. S. Gilbert he wrote Ages Ago (1869) for Thomas German Reed's Gallery of Illustration. This piece ran for 350 performances and was revived several times. Clay introduced Gilbert to Arthur Sullivan during a rehearsal for Ages Ago.Crowther, Andrew, Analysis of Ages Ago , The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive (2006) The Bold Recruit was revived at a benefit by German Reed at the Gallery of Illustration in 1870 as a companion piece to Ages Ago.The Era, 24 July 1870, p. 6 These were followed by The Gentleman in Black (1870, also with Gilbert), In Possession (1871, also for German Reed), Happy Arcadia (1872, with Gilbert), Oriana (1873, with a libretto by James Albery), Green Old Age and Cattarina (both 1874, with libretti by Robert Reece), Princess Toto (1875, the last collaboration between Clay and Gilbert), and Don Quixote (1876). Ages Ago (a one-act piece) and Princess Toto (a three- act comic opera) are considered to be among Clay's most tuneful and attractive works. The Times wrote that the music of Princess Toto \\"is probably surpassed by no modern English work of the kind for gaiety and melodious charm.\\"Obituary, The Times, 29 November 1889, p. 5, col. F Clay also composed part of the score for the spectacle Babil and Bijou (1872, also for German Reed) and the successful opera-bouffe version of The Black Crook (1873 based on the same source material as the earlier American musical of the same name and starring Kate Santley), both of which were produced with success at the Alhambra Theatre. He also furnished incidental music for a revival of Twelfth Night. Seymour Egerton and Sullivan, 1860s =Cantatas and later career= Clay's two cantatas were The Knights of the Cross (1866) and Lalla Rookh (containing perhaps Clay's best-known song, \\"I'll sing thee songs of Araby\\" and also \\"Still this golden lull\\"), which was produced successfully at the Brighton Festival in 1877. Clay had difficulty finding work in London and moved to America. There he met with only mixed success and returned to England in 1881. His last works were The Merry Duchess (1883) at the Royalty Theatre, starring Kate Santley and in which Louie Henri also appeared,Information about The Merry DuchessG√§nzl, p. 228 and The Golden Ring (starring Marion Hood) (1883), both with words by G. R. Sims. The latter was written for the reopening of the Alhambra, which had been burned to the ground the year before.G√§nzl, p. 230 These shows were both successful and showed an artistic advance upon Clay's previous work.G√§nzl, pp. 228 and 230 Clay's friend, Sir Arthur Sullivan, wrote: \\"In all his works Clay showed a natural gift of graceful melody and a feeling for rich harmonic colouring. [His songs included] 'She wandered down the mountain side,' 'Long ago' and 'The Sands of Dee'\\". Other songs that achieved popularity are \\"Gipsy John\\" and \\"Who Knows\\". After conducting the second performance of The Golden Ring in December 1883, Clay suffered a stroke that paralysed him and cut short his productive life. In 1889 at the age of 51, he was found drowned in his bath at the home of his sisters in Great Marlow, England, presumably a suicide. He was buried in Brompton cemetery.

Their design was based on that of the French-built modified to use Russian equipment. The first four ships were finished after the start of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905 and were among the ships ordered to sail from the Baltic Sea to the Far East to relieve the Pacific Squadron besieged by the Japanese in Port Arthur. Three of these ships were sunk and one was captured by the Imperial Japanese Navy at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. The fifth and final ship, , was not completed in time to participate in the war and served with the Baltic Fleet through World War I. Design and description Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1906 Tsar Nicholas II had desired a warm-water port on the Pacific since his accession to the throne in 1894. He achieved this ambition in March 1898 when Russia signed a 25-year lease for Port Arthur and the Liaotung Peninsula with China. Japan had previously forced China to sign over the port and its surrounding territory as part of the treaty that concluded the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894‚Äì1895, but the Triple Intervention of France, Russia, and Germany forced them to return the port in exchange for a sizeable increase in the indemnity paid by the Chinese. Japan invested much of the indemnity money in expanding its fleet, while Russia began a major building programme (\\"For the Needs of the Far East\\") to defend its newly acquired port that included the Borodino- class battleships.McLaughlin, pp. 100‚Äì103 The Borodinos were the most numerous class of battleships ever built by Russia. Although they were intended to be near duplicates of Tsesarevich, as soon as the contracts were signed, it became clear that they would be quite different from the French-built ship. The basic problem facing the navy was that the Borodinos would have heavier engines and larger turrets which would require a designer to build a ship which had the same speed, draft, guns and armor as Tsesarevich, but a greater displacement. The new design was drawn up by D. V. Skvortsov of the Naval Technical Committee (NTC). He completed his new design in July/August 1898, one month after the original contract had been signed. The new concept was roughly tons heavier and slightly larger and wider than the Tsesarevich.McLaughlin, p. 137 As might be expected, the Borodinos greatly resembled Tsesarevich, although Skvortsov added two more casemates, each containing four guns, one at the bow and the other aft. These guns were added to the already existing dozen 75 mm guns emplaced along the sides above the armor belt. This caused the tumblehome used on the rest of the hull to be deleted over the twelve guns and flat-sided armor was used in its place. Thus the five Borodino-class battleships only had tumblehome hulls fore and aft of their 75 mm guns emplaced along their sides.McLaughlin, p. 138 The centreline bulkhead between the engine and boiler rooms caused a danger of capsizing if one side flooded and their narrow belt armor became submerged when overloaded. As such, naval historian Antony Preston regarded these as some of the worst battleships ever built.Preston, pp. 50, 55 The ships were long at the waterline and long overall, with a beam of and a draft of , more than designed. Their normal displacement ranged from , more than their designed displacement of . They were designed for a crew of 28 officers and 754 enlisted men,McLaughlin, p. 136 although carried 928 crewmen during the Battle of Tsushima.Campbell, p. 187 The Borodino-class ships were powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam generated by 20 Belleville boilers. The engines were designed to reach a top speed of . The lead ship, Borodino, was fitted with a copy of the La Seyne machinery installed in Tsesarvich and built by the Franco-Russian Works. The remaining four Borodinos were supplied with machinery designed and built by the Baltic Works. Borodinos engines were rated at and its boilers had a working pressure of ; the machinery of her sisters was rated at and their boilers had a working pressure of . Other differences were that Borodino was equipped with economisers for her boilers as well as three-bladed screws, while her sisters lacked economisers and had four-bladed propellers.McLaughlin, pp. 137, 144 Because the ships were being prepared to go to the Far East shortly after completion, they conducted only abbreviated sea trials. Only reached her designed speed during these trails, despite her engines only producing . The engines of her sisters produced more power, but they were slower during their trials. At deep load they carried of coal that provided them a range of at a speed of . The ships were fitted with six steam- driven generators with a total capacity of . = Armament and fire control= The main armament of the Borodino class consisted of two pairs of 40-caliber 12-inch guns mounted in French-style, electrically powered, twin-gun turrets fore and aft. The turrets had a maximum elevation of +15¬∞ and 60 rounds per gun were carried. The guns fired one shell every 90‚Äì132 seconds.Forczyk, p. 29 They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of Friedman, pp. 251‚Äì252 to a range of at maximum elevation.Forczyk, p. 28\` The secondary armament of the ships consisted of a dozen 45-caliber Canet Model 1891 (QF) guns mounted in six electrically powered twin-gun turrets on the upper deck. The turrets had a maximum elevation of +15¬∞ arc of fire and the center turrets could cover 180¬∞. Each six-inch gun was provided with 180 rounds. Their rate of fire was about 2‚Äì4 rounds per minute.Forczyk, p. 30 They fired shells that weighed with a muzzle velocity of .Friedman, pp. 260‚Äì261 They had a maximum range of approximately . A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats. These included twenty 50-calibre Canet QF guns mounted in hull embrasures. The ships carried 300 shells for each gun. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum range of at an elevation of +13¬∞.Friedman, p. 264 The Borodino-class ships also mounted sixteen or eighteen Hotchkiss guns in the superstructure.McLaughlin, p. 142 They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of Smigielski, p. 160 at a rate of around 15 rounds per minute. The ships carried four torpedo tubes, two of which were mounted above water in the bow and stern while the two broadside underwater tubes were located near the forward 12-inch magazine. Four torpedoes were carried for the above-water tubes and six for the submerged tubes. They also carried 50 mines to be laid to protect their anchorage in remote areas. The Borodino class were originally fitted with Liuzhol stadiametric rangefinders that used the angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship, usually the waterline and the crow's nest, to estimate the range. The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target. He then transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical fire-control transmission system to each gun or turret. While fitting out, these rangefinders were replaced on the first four ships by two Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinders that used two images that had to be superimposed to derive the range. Perepelkin telescopic sights were also installed for their guns, but their crews were not trained in how to use them.Forczyk, pp. 27‚Äì28, 57 The waterline armor belt of the Borodinos consisted of Krupp armor and was thick.

Early on the evening of the following day, when the squadron was near the Dogger Bank, the auxiliary repair ship Kamchatka reported that she was under attack by torpedo boats in the rain. About four hours later, the squadron encountered British fishing trawlers working the Dogger Bank in the fog and opened fire on them at very short range.Pleshkov, pp. 91‚Äì97 One trawler was sunk and at least three others were damaged; several fishermen were killed and others wounded.Hough, pp. 42‚Äì44 The battleships also fired upon and damaged the cruisers and in the confusion. The incident enraged the British population and caused a diplomatic incident with the British that nearly led to war until Russia apologized and agreed to pay reparations on 29 October.Pleshakov, pp. 98‚Äì109 Rozhestvensky led his ships down the Atlantic coast of Africa, rounding the Cape of Good Hope, and reached the island of Nosy Be off the north-west coast of Madagascar on 9 January 1905 where they remained for two months while Rozhestvensky finalized his coaling arrangements. During this time, he learned of the capture of Port Arthur and changed his destination to Vladivostok, the only other port controlled by the Russians in the Far East. The squadron sailed for Camranh Bay, French Indochina, on 16 March and reached it almost a month later to await the obsolete ships of the 3rd Pacific Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov. The latter ships reached Camranh Bay on 9 May and the combined force sailed for Vladivostok on 14 May. While exact figures are not available, it is probable that the ships were approximately overweight as they were overloaded with coal and other supplies; all of which was stored high in the ships and reduced their stability. The extra weight also submerged their waterline armor belt and left only about of the upper armor belt above the waterline.McLaughlin, pp. 141, 167 =Battle of Tsushima= Before the battle Rozhestvensky grouped the four Borodinos into one division and retained personal command of the division. Oryol, the last ship in the division, fired the first shots of the Battle of Tsushima when the ship's captain, Nikolay Yung, ordered her to open fire at 11:42 at a Japanese cruiser that was shadowing the Russian formation at a range of . Rozhestvensky had not given any pre-battle instructions to the fleet covering this situation, but he ordered Yung to cease fire after 30 rounds had been fired without effect. Knyaz Suvorov was the lead ship in the Russian battle line and she opened fire at the , flagship of Admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç at 14:05.Forczyk, pp. 56, 58 Mikasa and the other Japanese ships began to return fire about five minutes later. Their high-explosive shells quickly set all four of the Borodinos on fire; at 14:35, Rozhestvensky and the Knyaz Suvorovs captain were wounded by splinters that entered the ship's conning tower. Around 14:52, another hit jammed Knyaz Suvorovs steering gear after a four point turn to starboard had been ordered and caused the ship to make nearly a full circle before she could be steered by her engines.Campbell, p. 129 By this time Knyaz Suvorovs aft 12-inch gun turret had been destroyed by an explosion that blew its roof off onto the quarterdeck, her forward funnel had fallen down and her mainmast had been shot away.McLaughlin, p. 169 Imperator Aleksandr III and the other ships of the division briefly followed Knyaz Suvorov until it became clear that the latter ship was out of control and then turned north in an effort to get behind T≈çg≈ç's ships. Knyaz Suvorov never regained her position in the battle line and became the primary target of the Japanese for a time. Around 16:00 the captain of Imperator Alexandr III, Nikolai Bukhvostov, decided to duplicate 's maneuver at the Battle of the Yellow Sea by charging straight for the Japanese battleline in an attempt to focus their attention on his ship rather than Knyaz Suvorov. He was successful, but Imperator Aleksandr III was badly damaged in the process. Borodino now assumed the lead position and turned the fleet to the south where they temporarily managed to disengage in the mist and fog.Forczyk, pp. 25, 63, 66‚Äì67 Knyaz Suvorov was badly damaged by repeated attacks after she separated from the main body although she was initially in no danger of sinking. The Russian destroyer Buinyi came alongside around 17:30 and evacuated Rozhestvensky and other wounded officers. Torpedoes fired by a number of torpedo boats ultimately caused a magazine to explode around 19:20 and Knyaz Suvorov capsized at about 19:30. Other than the 20 officers taken off by Buinyi,Forczyk, p. 67 there were no survivors of the 928 crew aboard. When the shooting between the battle lines resumed around 18:00, the Japanese concentrated their fire upon Imperator Aleksandr III and Borodino. Imperator Alexandr III sheered out of line to port around 18:30 and capsized, but did not sink until 19:07; there were no survivors. Borodino lasted a little while longer under concentrated Japanese fire. Two 12-inch hits by the battleship at 19:18 started a massive fire and both the ship's 12-inch gun turrets were knocked out. Ten minutes later, after T≈çg≈ç ordered his ships to cease fire and disengage, the battleship fired her already-loaded 12-inch guns before turning away. One of these hit Borodino beneath her starboard forward six-inch turret and ignited the ready-use ammunition in the turret. The fire spread and caused a catastrophic detonation in several magazines that blew open her hull. Borodino quickly capsized and sank with only one crewman from her crew of 855 being rescued.Campbell, p. 135Forczyk, pp. 67, 70 Oryol took the lead after Borodino was sunk; she was joined by Nebogatov's Second Division after T≈çg≈ç ordered the Japanese battleships to disengage in the gathering darkness. Nebogatov assumed command of the remains of the fleet and they continued towards Vladivostok. The ships were discovered by the Japanese early the following morning and attacked by T≈çg≈ç's battleships around 10:00. The faster Japanese ships stayed beyond the range at which Nebogatov's ships could effectively reply and he decided to surrender his ships at 10:30 as he could neither return fire nor close the range.Forczyk, pp. 70‚Äì71 =Post-Tsushima careers= Iwami at anchor The Japanese substantially rebuilt Oryol and recommissioned her in June 1907 with the name of Iwami.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 21 To reduce her top weight, they cut down her superstructure and repositioned her guns. In addition, her boilers were replaced by an unknown number of Japanese-built Miyabara boilers and she was rearmed with Japanese-made guns. These changes reduced her displacement to approximately and her crew now totaled 750 officers and crewmen.McLaughlin, pp. 452‚Äì453 During World War I, the ship participated in the Siege of Tsingtao in August‚ÄìNovember 1914McLaughlin, p. 146 and served as the flagship of the Japanese Intervention Squadron in Vladivostok in 1918 when Japan intervened in the Russian Civil War.Preston 1972, p. 193 She was used as a training ship in 1921 and disarmed in 1922 in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. Sources differ as to her ultimate fate; she was either sunk as a target by aircraft near Miura in July 1924 or scrapped at Kobe in 1924‚Äì1925. Serving in the Baltic Sea during World War I, Slava was the largest ship of the Russian Gulf of Riga Squadron that fought the German High Seas Fleet in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915. She was lightly damaged by three hits during the battle. She repeatedly bombarded German positions and troops for the rest of 1915 and during 1916.Nekrasov, pp. 52, 59‚Äì64 During the Battle of Moon Sound in 1917, Slava was badly damaged by the German dreadnought and the flooding significantly increased her draft. The shallow channel made it impossible to escape and she was scuttled in the Moon Sound Strait between the island of Muhu (Moon) and the mainland.Staff, pp. 113‚Äì117 The Estonians scrapped her in 1935.Gardiner and Gray, p. 294 Notes Footnotes References      * External links * * Russian navy site * photo.starnet.ru ‚Äì photo album site * steelnavy.com ‚Äì site aimed at model builders Category:Battleship classes Borodino-class battleship Borodino-class battleship Borodino-class battleship ","title":"Borodino-class battleship"},{"id":"2621434","text":"Lucky Three (or Lucky Three: An Elliott Smith Portrait) is a 1997 11-minute short film directed by Jem Cohen and featuring singer-songwriter Elliott Smith.

Green is a practicing Christian and member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Interview with Reza Aslan In 2011, Green asked whether Islam \\"makes believers more susceptible to radicalization.\\" After a 2013 interview with Iranian-American scholar Reza Aslan (who was then promoting his new book, Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth), she received considerable criticism for her questions. Green questioned why a Muslim would write about Jesus, saying, \\"You're a Muslim, so why did you write a book about the founder of Christianity?\\" Aslan defended his credentials several times throughout, and clearly stated that his interest was scholarly. Green continued to press him on the same matters, clearly not taking on board anything Aslan said. Erik Wemple of The Washington Post disparaged Green's questions as \\"dumb, loaded, and prejudicial,\\" calling for the Fox News Channel to apologize to Aslan. Daniel Politi of Slate speculated that the interview was possibly \\"the single most cringe-worthy, embarrassing interview on Fox News [...] in recent memory.\\" Matthew J. Franck criticized Aslan for his claim of a degree in the history of religions, as he teaches creative writing and holds a PhD in Sociology of Religion rather than a degree in history. In the interview, Aslan clearly stated that \\"anyone who thinks this book is an attack on Christianity has not read it yet.\\" Music In 2004, Green released an album called Classic Beauty consisting of classical piano music.

It is known for several prominent former residents, including: Thomas Oliver (1734‚Äì1815), royal Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts; Elbridge Gerry (1744‚Äì1814), signer of the US Declaration of Independence, Vice President of the United States and eponym of the term \\"gerrymandering\\"; and James Russell Lowell (1819‚Äì1891), noted American writer, poet, and foreign diplomat. The house, originally on a 100-acre estate, was built in the Georgian style about 1767 by John Nutting for Lt. Governor Thomas Oliver, scion of a wealthy merchant family in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Abandoned by the Loyalist Oliver at the outset of the American Revolutionary War, the property was confiscated by the state of Massachusetts. It was purchased by Elbridge Gerry, who used it as his family residence until his death in 1814. The house was sold by his heirs to the Lowell family, and was the birthplace and residence of James Russell Lowell for most of his life. During Lowell's ownership significant portions of the original estate were sold off, and his heirs sold the house to art historian and Harvard professor, Arthur Kingsley Porter. He bequeathed the property to the university, which now uses it as the official residence of its president. Architecturally the house has retained most of its Georgian character, and has had only modest exterior additions and modifications. Although it was decorated in a Victorian style by the Lowells, Harvard restored the interior to a more traditional Georgian style when it took over the property. The house is not open to the public. In addition to the property owned by Harvard, the National Historic Landmark District encompasses the adjacent Lowell Park, a state-owned park which was once part of the original Oliver estate. History =Oliver, Revolution, and Gerry= The house now known as Elmwood was built about 1767 by Thomas Oliver, appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Massachusetts in the spring of 1774. The estate, located on the western edge of Cambridge, Massachusetts, at that time consisted of about of rolling fields with a commanding view of the Charles River. Oliver's property extended from Fresh Pond in the north across the Charles River to what is now the Boston neighborhood of Brighton to the south, then part of Cambridge.An Historic Guide to Cambridge, p. 115 It was not far from the 1759 mansion built by his brother-in-law John Vassall,Calhoun, Charles C.

New York: Artisan, 2007: 84. now the Longfellow House‚ÄìWashington's Headquarters National Historic Site. On September 1, 1774, pursuant to orders given by Governor Thomas Gage, British Army troops removed provincial gunpowder from a magazine in what is today Somerville. This activity caused a spontaneous rising of militia throughout the province amid rumors of actual violence that is known as the Powder Alarm.Brooks, pp. 16‚Äì18 The next day Oliver was able to dissipate a crowd that formed in Cambridge (near present-day Harvard Square) by going to Boston, conferring with Gage, and reporting that no further military movements were planned. However, the crowd followed him home and compelled him to resign his office, which he did under protest.Stark, pp. 186‚Äì187 Oliver and his family shortly thereafter fled to Boston. Early in the Siege of Boston that began after the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775, the house was occupied by troops that eventually became part of the Continental Army; one of the building's notable occupants during this time was Benedict Arnold, then in the Connecticut militia. After the Battle of Bunker Hill it was used as a hospital. When the British military evacuated Boston in March 1776, the Olivers, like many other Loyalists, traveled with them to Nova Scotia.Stark, p. 188 Oliver eventually settled in Bristol, England, where he died in 1815. The Massachusetts government confiscated Oliver's property during the American Revolutionary War, and sold it in 1779 to Andrew Cabot. In 1787 Elbridge Gerry purchased the Cambridge estate, which became his home. In the aftermath of the XYZ Affair, for which Gerry was unjustly criticized, Elmwood was the scene of protests in which Gerry was burned in effigy.Purcell, pp. 51‚Äì52 Gerry served as Governor of Massachusetts in 1810 and 1811; redistricting of the state in 1812 prompted the coining of the term \\"gerrymandering\\" to describe the practice of shaping legislative districts in partisan ways.Buel, pp. 148‚Äì149 In March 1813 Gerry took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States in the house; he died in 1814 in Washington, D. C. Gerry rented out large parts of the estate to tenant farmers.An Historic Guide to Cambridge, p. 116 He sold and later repurchased land near the Charles River from a relative, who operated a landing and storehouse; the area (located near the present-day Eliot Bridge) became known as Gerry's Landing.Publications of the Cambridge Historical Society, p. 85Bethell et al, p. 62 =Lowell family= James Russell Lowell at Elmwood (from Edward Everett Hale's biography of Lowell, published 1891) Ten acres, including the house, were purchased from the Gerry family in 1818 by Charles Russell Lowell, Sr. of the Lowell family. It was in this homeHeymann, p. 55 that James Russell Lowell was born on February 22, 1819.Nelson, p. 39 In the 1850s, Lowell dealt with many personal tragedies, including the sudden death of his mother and his third daughter, Rose.Duberman, p. 116 His personal troubles as well as the Compromise of 1850 convinced him to spend a winter in Italy after coaxing from William Wetmore Story.Duberman, p. 117 The trip was financed by the sale of land around Elmwood, and Lowell intended to sell off even further. Ultimately, 25 of the original were sold to supplement Lowell's income.Wagenknecht, p. 36 His personal troubles continued: his son Walter died while overseas, his wife Maria White Lowell died in October 1853, his father became deaf, and his sister Rebecca was deteriorating mentally such that she often went without speaking for weeks. He had difficulty coping and became a recluse at Elmwood for a timeHeymann, pp. 101‚Äì102 until an invitation to speak at the Lowell Institute resulted in a job offer at Harvard College.Duberman, p. 133Sullivan, p. 215 He accepted the job, with the request he be allowed to study abroad for a year first.Heymann, p. 105 Lowell returned to the United States and began his duties at Harvard in the summer of 1856.Sullivan, p. 216 Still grieving the loss of his wife, however, he avoided Elmwood, lodging instead in an area known as Professors' Row on Kirkland Street in Cambridge along with his daughter Mabel and her governess Frances Dunlap.Heymann, p. 106 Lowell and Dunlap married in 1857. After the death of Lowell's father in January 1861 due to a heart attack, he moved back to Elmwood with his family. Despite avoiding the home for so long, he was pleased to be back. He wrote to his friend Charles Frederick Briggs: \\"I am back again to the place I love best. I am sitting in my old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... I begin to feel more like my old self than I have these ten years\\".Heymann, p. 119 However, Elmwood's expenses drained him, with taxes at $1,000 a year. As early as 1867, he considered renting out Elmwood and moving into a smaller home elsewhere but never did. Instead, to ease his financial plight, he began to sell off land in 1870 until only two and a half acres remained.Duberman, pp. 257‚Äì258 This marker near Mount Auburn Street summarizes the history of the home Lowell remained at Elmwood for the remainder of his life, except during the period between 1877 and 1885 when he served as Minister to Spain and Great Britain. At Elmwood, he wrote some of his best-known works, including The Vision of Sir Launfal, The Biglow Papers, and A Fable for Critics, all published in 1848.Ehrlich and Carruth, p. 40 It was Lowell who named the house \\"Elmwood\\". He mentions the home in some of his poetry:Wilson, p. 113 :My Elmwood chimneys seem crooning to me, :As of old in their moody, minor key, :And out of the past the hoarse wind blows. Lowell's friend and fellow poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow also wrote a poem about the house called \\"The Herons of Elmwood\\".Gale, p. 106 In the summer of 1872, when Lowell traveled to Europe, he rented the house to Thomas Bailey Aldrich. Years later, in 1877, when Lowell was appointed Ambassador to Spain, he rented the home to the violinist Ole Bull.Duberman, p. 283 Shortly after Bull's death in 1880, the Norwegian poet, playwright, and novelist Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson was the guest of Bull's widow at Elmwood for three months.Haugen and Haugen, pp. 28‚Äì30 Upon Lowell's return to the United States in 1885, he stayed at Elmwood until his death. He died in the home on August 12, 1891. =20th century to present= After the death of James Russell Lowell the house was inherited and used seasonally first by his daughter Mabel the wife of Edward Burnett then by their children. Arthur Kingsley Porter purchased Elmwood and the remaining lands from the Lowell heirs in 1920. Porter, a Harvard professor, used the house as a private residence, but also taught some of his classes there and allowed students to use his extensive library. Porter would later become Chair of Harvard's Art History Department. In 1929, Porter purchased Glenveagh Castle in Ireland. He disappeared from the nearby island of Inishbofin on July 8, 1933. Under the terms of his will, Elmwood was bequeathed to Harvard, although his wife was granted lifetime occupancy. She died in 1962, at which time Harvard took full control of the property. Lowell Park; Elmwood is visible in the distance After major renovations Elmwood was occupied by Franklin L. Ford, who served as Harvard's Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for most of the 1960s. Acting President Derek Bok moved his family to its bucolic grounds in 1971 amid security concerns originating in student protest activity near the then-president's residence on Quincy Street. The house has been the official residence of Harvard presidents since. It still houses portions of the Lowell library. The Harvard-owned property and the adjacent state-owned Lowell Park were declared a National Historic Landmark District in 1966. Lowell Park was established in 1899 as a memorial to James Russell Lowell. It was paid for in part by private subscription and also with some public funds, and donated to the state in 1898. It was at first administered by the Metropolitan District Commission as part of the Charles River Reservation; the MDC's successor, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, is now responsible for the park.Public Documents of Massachusetts, 1898, pp. 12‚Äì13 Architecture A photochrom image of Elmwood, published by the Detroit Publishing Co. in the 1890s Although parts of Elmwood's interior have been altered, its exterior has not changed greatly over the years. It is a large, square, clapboarded structure in Georgian style with brick-lined walls and two chimneys. The floor plans on each floor are the same: two rooms on either side of a central hall housing a staircase. The windows on the first and second floors have decorative cornices, and a 19th- century balustrade surrounds the roof. The exterior entranceway is flanked by Tuscan pilasters supporting a classic entablature decorated with a frieze. Above the entablature is a large window with Ionic pilasters on either side, topped by a triangular pediment. The building has had some modifications and additions, made principally during the Lowell ownership period. Additions housing more modern services and a library were added to the west side of the house, and first-floor windows in the front parlor and dining room were replaced with French doors. A one-story porch with balustraded roof deck was added on the north side of the house, and a terrace was installed on the south side. The Lowells decorated the house in a Victorian style; Harvard restored the building interior to an 18th-century style when it took over the property.

It has foliage and an aggregate accessory fruit similar to that of a true strawberry. It has yellow flowers, unlike the white or slightly pink flowers of true strawberries. It is native to eastern and southern Asia, but has been introduced to many other areas as a medicinal and an ornamental plant, subsequently naturalizing in many regions worldwide. Many sources consider this plant part of the genus Potentilla due to evidence from chloroplast genetic sequence data that the genus Duchesnea is included within Potentilla, though some still list it as Duchesnea indica. Description The leaves are trifoliate, roughly veined beneath, dark green, and often persisting through the winter, arising from short crowns. The plant spreads along creeping stolons, rooting and producing crowns at each node. The yellow flowers are produced in mid spring, then sporadically throughout the growing season. The aggregate accessory fruits are white or red, and entirely covered with red achenes, simple ovaries, each containing a single seed. Uses A poultice of the crushed leaves is used to treat skin ailments such as eczema.

Biography Kjerulf was born in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. He was the son of a high government official. His early education was at Christiania University, for a legal career, but his studies ended in 1839 as a result of illness, and the next year he spent some time in Paris. Soon after his return his father and two siblings died and he took a job as a journalist at one of Oslo's main newspapers, Den Constitutionelle where Andreas Munch (1811‚Äì1884) was editor and where Kjerulf worked until 1845. Kjerulf started his career as a music teacher and composer of songs before ever having seriously studied music at all, and not for ten years did he attract any particular notice. He was counted among those in the Modern Breakthrough movement in literature, painting and music which was replacing romanticism within Scandinavia. It was typified by the poet Johan Sebastian Welhaven, whose poems he set.Harald S. N√¶ss A History of Norwegian Literature 1993 - Page 88 \\"His poetry, in musical settings by Kjerulf, has been preserved in the repertoire of the Oslo Student Chorus (founded by Kjerulf) and received added significance as the verbal expression of Norway's romantic landscape painting.

For many years after his return to Norway, Kjerulf tried in vain to establish regular classical concerts, while he himself was working with Bj√∏rnson and other writers at the composition of lyrical songs. He did present some concerts, at which he introduced the Norwegian public to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony and other standards otherwise little known to them.Grove's Dictionary, 5th ed (1954), ed. Eric Blom, Vol IV, pp.772-773 He obtained some official recognition during the 1860s. He died in Grefsen, near Christiania, in 1868, aged only 52. Legacy His fame rests mainly on his beautiful and manly national partsongs and solos. His piano music is equally charming. Edvard Grieg was an enthusiastic admirer of it and he was undoubtedly influenced by it in writing his Lyric Pieces. It was recorded in its entirety in 2001 by Einar Steen-N√∏kleberg. His piano students included Agathe Backer- Gr√∏ndahl and Erika Nissen (then known as Erika Lie).

Nearby places are Cottingham in Northants, Great Easton and Drayton in Leicestershire, and Caldecott in Rutland. The population is included in the civil parish of Great Easton. History St Nicholas Church, Bringhurst The village antedates the Norman Conquest (1066 AD) and was one of the first Anglo-Saxon settlements of Britain. The land was given by √Üthelred of Mercia to the Medeshamstede Abbey around the year 700 AD. In addition, a confirmatory charter of Edward the Confessor speaks of \\"the church of Bringhurst\\". Bringhurst is, according to W. G. Hoskins, one of the oldest village sites of the Anglo-Saxon period in the county. Bringhurst is one of the ancient Leicestershire villages not recorded in the Domesday Book (1086); however information about it is included in the entry for Great Easton indicating that Great Easton had acquired more importance than the older village on the hill- top. By the 13th century most villages in the county were growing in population but Bringhurst, being badly sited, probably was not.Hoskins, W. G. (1957) Leicestershire. (The Making of the English Landscape.) London: Hodder & Stoughton; pp. 3, 11, 17 The parish church of St Nicholas is 13th century in date; it is Grade II* listed. The older houses are made of local stone and either roofed with thatch or Collyweston slate. Toponymy The name of the village predates its use as a family name, the earliest mention of which is dated 1260. Earlier variations of the name, such as \\"Bruninghurst\\" were first recorded in 1188. Other variations include \\"Bringherst\\", \\"Brinkhurst\\", \\"Bringhast\\", and \\"Bringhaste\\". The etymology of Bringhurst comes from the personal name \\"Bryni\\" derived from bryne (Old English), meaning \\"fire\\" or \\"flame\\", combined with the word \\"hurst\\" or hyrst meaning \\"wooded hill\\" in Old English, related to Old Saxon, and hurst or horst in Old High German.  Primary school  Bringhurst Primary School is located around half a mile from Bringhurst village, by the road to Great Easton. There are 147 pupils on roll. The most recent (2012) Ofsted report stated \\"Bringhurst is a good school which places pupils' achievement and well-being at the centre of all it does.\\" The school holds a Sport England Activemark and is a Football Association Charter Standard School. The school's strengths include creative writing, music and ICT, Science and RE. In 2010 long-standing road-safety fears were highlighted by a six-car crash outside the school gates.

The North American wrestling industry portrays authority figures as responsible for making matches, providing rules and generally keeping law and order both in and outside the ring. The role can vary according to disposition as a face authority figure tends to give what the fans want and does what is fair while a heel authority figures tend to run their shows out of their own self- interest.  WWE authority figures  From its founding in 1963 to 1997, the WWE looked to a president as an authority figure. The president had booking power and controlled all wrestlers. However, in 1997 the commissioner replaced the president, with Sgt. Slaughter serving as the first WWE commissioner. During the Attitude Era (1997‚Äì2002), not only the commissioner, but also Vince McMahon (through his position as WWE chairman under his evil character Mr. McMahon) had booking power. McMahon usually used his power in order to haze his kayfabe nemesis, Stone Cold Steve Austin. When Shawn Michaels served as commissioner, he could overrule McMahon, but he exercised his booking power only sporadically and was working with an ironclad contract where he could not be fired. When Mick Foley acquired the position, he took full reign until he was fired from the position. Upon splitting WWE into two separate brands in the WWE brand extension of 2002, on-screen co-owners Vince McMahon and Ric Flair proceeded to draft WWE wrestlers into two separate rosters. Flair took ownership of Raw while McMahon controlled SmackDown. After McMahon regained control of the entire company, he removed Flair from control of Raw, relinquished his own position and appointed separate general managers to control the different brands. On July 18, 2011, Triple H came to Raw and told Vince McMahon that the board of directors (kayfabe) revoked his \\"day-to-day operation power\\" and named him to manage it instead.\\"Game\\" changer for McMahon\\". After that, Triple H became the WWE's chief operating officer, who had the booking power in WWE on both the Raw and SmackDown brands until the Board of Directors stripped him of his power and named John Laurinaitis the interim general manager of Raw. = Presidents and commissioners = * Willie Gilzenberg, WWF president (1963 ‚Äì November 15, 1978) * Hisashi Shinma, WWF president (1978‚Äì1984) * Jack Tunney, WWF president (September 1984 ‚Äì July 12, 1995) * Gorilla Monsoon, WWF president (July 12, 1995 ‚Äì August 3, 1997; interim president from July 12, 1995 to March 31, 1996) * Roddy Piper, WWF interim president (1996; substitution for an injured Gorilla Monsoon) * Sgt.

His tenure saw the creation of Nitro, the start of the Monday Night Wars and the formation of the New World Order. Declining ratings saw Bischoff ousted in 1999 and former WWF writer Vince Russo was hired in an attempt to salvage the company.

Imperial forces had captured the Venetian city of Padua in June 1509. On 17 July, Venetian forces commanded by Andrea Gritti marched quickly from Treviso with a contingent of stradioti and retook the city, which had been garrisoned by some landsknechts hired by Emperor Maximilian I. In response, the emperor raised an army, composed mainly of mercenaries, and decided to invade the Veneto in an attempt to reclaim it. In early August 1509, Maximilian set out from Trento with some 35,000 men and headed south into Venetian territory; there he was joined by French and Papal contingents. Due to a lack of horses, and generally poor organization, the army did not reach Padua until mid-September, which allowed the Venetian commander Niccol√≤ di Pitigliano to concentrate what remained of Venice's army after Agnadello, as well as several companies of volunteers from Venice, in the city. The siege began on 15 September. For two weeks, Imperial and French artillery bombarded the city, successfully breaching the walls; but the attacking troops were driven back by determined Venetian resistance when they attempted to enter. An assault by 7,500 Landsknechts in the Codalunga sector of the walls (the one that was most bombarded during the siege) was repulsed by mercenary commander Citolo da Perugia, whose mines killed 300 attackers and injured 400 others. By 30 September, Maximilian, unable to pay his mercenaries, lifted the siege; leaving a small detachment in Italy under the Duke of Anhalt, he withdrew to Tyrol with the main part of his army. The defeat was a major loss of face for Maximilian, and the Holy Roman Empire would not attempt another invasion of Italy until 1516.  References  * Norwich, John Julius. A History of Venice.

He was the author of The Martyred (1964), The Innocent (1968), and Lost Names (1970), and many other works. He was a Guggenheim Fellow (1966) and was a recipient of a Fulbright grant. His most popular work is Lost Names, a fictional work based on his experience during the Japanese colonization of Korea. Biography Kim Eun Kook, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was born in 1932 in Hamhung, South Hamgyong, a city in what is now North Korea. He was raised first in Korea, then Manchukuo, and then Korea again. His childhood consisted of living during the tail end of the Japanese occupation. After serving in the Republic of Korea Marine Corps and Army, 1950‚Äì54, he was honorably discharged as first lieutenant of the Infantry in 1954 and came to the United States in 1955. He was educated at Middlebury College in Vermont, where he studied political science and history, 1955‚Äì59; at Johns Hopkins University (M.A. in writing, 1960); at the University of Iowa's Writers Workshop (M.F.A. 1962); and at Harvard University (M.A. in Far Eastern languages and literature, 1963). Career The Martyred, Kim's first novel, is about the Korean War, which would be made into a play, an opera, and a film. It was also nominated for a National Book Award. It was followed by The Innocent (1968), about politics in postwar South Korea, and Lost Names: Scenes from a Korean Boyhood (1970), a collection of stories. His academic experience included various professorships in English at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Syracuse University, San Diego State University, and at Seoul National University, where he was a Fulbright professor, 1981‚Äì83. He received a Ford Foundation Foreign Area Fellowship (1962‚Äì63), a Guggenheim Fellowship (1966), the First Award, Modern Korean Literature Translation Awards (1974), a National Endowment for the Arts Literary Fellowship (1978‚Äì79), and other awards and honors. His published original works include the novels The Martyred (1964), The Innocent (1968) and Lost Names (1970); a children's story, \\"A Blue Bird\\" (in Korean, 1983); \\"In Search of Lost Years\\" (in Korean, 1985), and \\"Lost Koreans in China and the Soviet Union: Photo-Essays\\" (1989). His television work, for KBS-TV of Seoul, includes \\"200 Years of Christianity in Korea\\" (1981), \\"The Korean War\\" (1983), \\"On Japan\\" (1984), \\"Reflections on the Wartime Massacres\\" (1985), \\"A Passage to Manchuria\\" (1987), \\"In Search of Lost Koreans in the Soviet Union\\" (1988), and \\"The Great Trans-Siberian Railway\\" (1989). He was a columnist for The Korea Herald and The Chosun Ilbo (Korea Daily) in Seoul, 1981‚Äì84. Family and life experiences have played a huge role as inspiration for his writing. His father is the more influential of these, and Kim has described his father as a saint.http://www.asian- studies.org/EAA/lostname.htm His father is also a major character in his book Lost Names (1970). Books * The Martyred. Originally published in 1964; reissued by Penguin Classics, 2011. * The Innocent. 1968. * Lost Names: Scenes from a Korean Boyhood. Originally published in 1970; reissued by University of California Press in 1998; special 40th anniversary edition issued in 2011 with new preface. The Martyred After twelve Christian ministers are found dead, allegedly at the hand of the Communists, Captain Lee, the narrator, is sent to interview the two survivors. Lee hopes one of them, Reverend Shin, will confess to betraying his colleagues, which Lee could use to discredit the Communists and arouse the support of the Korean Christians for the war. Although Shin is innocent‚Äîin fact, he was spared because unlike the others, he refused to denounce his faith‚Äîhe falsely confesses to the betrayal and, after being \\"forgiven\\", becomes a popular preacher who deliberately preserves the people's false image of the fallen ministers as \\"martyrs\\", recognizing that his parishioners are already burdened beyond their abilities by the war and that he loves them too much to destroy their faith. The novel also addresses larger questions about the war and about Korean Christianity, about the juxtaposition between the large-scale suffering of the public during wartime and the individual aspects of faith, hope, confession, etc. Although the story is built around the twelve murdered ministers, Kim returns to the suffering of the innocent Koreans as a whole, thus implicitly posing the question of whether the people of Korea are just as much \\"martyrs\\" as the twelve murdered men.\\"The Martyred\\", Encyclopedia of Asian-American Literature, ed. Seiwoong Oh, 2007, pp.181‚Äì182. The novel was immensely popular, staying on the New York Times Bestseller List for twenty weeks and being translated into ten languages. It was a nominee for the National Book Award and for the Nobel Prize in Literature. The Innocent Kim brings back characters from The Martyred in this novel set around a fictional coup d'√©tat in South Korea (such as the one that occurred in 1961) and about the ethical dilemma encountered by a group of army officers as they realize that morality may require them to do horrific deeds. Major Lee (the captain of the previous novel) wants to use peaceful means to change the corrupt civilian government, believing that violence cannot be used to end violence. But after removing General Ham, the other conspirators want to punish him with execution. Lee is contrasted by his friend Colonel Min, the group leader who prefers more forceful methods, and as the events spiral beyond the control of the conspirators, Min separates himself from Lee's calls for non-violence; still, after the coup's success, Min acknowledges to Lee that Lee's focus on remaining innocent, even if it is unrealistic, prevents Min from being seen as anything other than a murderer.\\"The Innocent\\", Encyclopedia of Asian-American Literature, ed. Seiwoong Oh, 2007, pp. 125‚Äì126. In this novel Kim reflects on the difficulty not only of rebuilding the nation after a horrific war, but also of maintaining one's innocence amidst so much corruption and in the face of the continued momentum of wartime violence. This novel was not as successful as The Martyred, perhaps because it was published during protests against the Vietnam War, and enthusiasm for Kim decreased as a result. Lost Names A fictional book about Kim's experiences during the Japanese occupation of Korea. However, when discussing the fictional and nonfictional aspects of his book, Kim stated \\"All the characters and events described in this book are real, but everything else is fiction...\\" Kim's experiences are not always the most uplifting, but Kim does not intend the book to be interpreted as anti- Japanese. The title Lost Names was translated very differently into the Korean language. The \\"Lost\\" on the title to the Koreans meant \\"forcibly taken away\\", but Kim does not desire for that to be the depiction of the title, he simply meant lost. His favorite scene in Lost Names is the chapter \\"Once Upon a Time, on a Sunday.\\" The scene is when the boy is looking up at the night sky realizing everything going on is insignificant compared to the vastness and possibilities the night sky represents.

The plot consists of a series of often abstract sequences, including plot material created by stars Kaylan, Volman, Robert Ridgely, and, according to the film's ending credits, various people Swenson encountered during the making of the film. Dirty Duck received mostly negative reviews, with many criticizing it for its crude humor and others seeing the film as an attempt to cash in on the success of Ralph Bakshi's Fritz the Cat. The film fared better on home video and is now considered a cult film. Plot Willard Isenbaum, a lonely insurance man with wild sexual fantasies, decides to propose to the new secretary, Susie, whom he has only known for a day and to whom he has never spoken. He spends the entire morning before work fantasizing about having sex with her, but his attempts to approach her fail. His female boss sends him to investigate a claim filed by Painless Martha, an aging tattoo artist, who works in a prison. Martha believes in a Ouija board message saying that she will be killed by a wizard on a Tuesday. When Willard tells her that the insurance company will not pay until her death, she dies of a heart attack. Her will stipulates that her killer must take care of her duck. After the duo spend a night in jail, the duck takes Willard to a brothel. After a wild night of partying, they wind up in the desert, where the duck dresses Willard in women's clothing in an attempt to get a ride. After several encounters with an old prospector dying of thirst, a racist police officer, two lesbians, and a short Mexican man, they are finally picked up by a trucker. Back at his apartment, Willard creates a makeshift sex object, which the duck eats. Shortly after, Willard discovers that the duck is female, and has sex with her. The following morning, Willard and the duck go to Willard's job, where Willard has sex with his female boss and quits his job shortly after. Willard and the duck leave, and the movie ends with Willard saying that Duck was a good duck after all.

Good - Transvestite Production After the release and success of Fritz the Cat, several animated films meant for adults rather than children enjoyed success. Fritz, a film based on a character created by artist and illustrator Robert Crumb, was the first animated movie to receive an X rating in the United States. Charles Swenson developed Down and Dirty Duck as a project for former Turtles and Mothers of Invention band members Kaylan and Volman under the title Cheap! Producer Jerry D. Good pitched the film to Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman while the production company, Murakami-Wolf, prepared the animated sequence for Frank Zappa's 200 Motels.Kaylan, Howard, \\"A Closely Guarded Secret\\". Shell Shocked. P. 146. Backbeat, 2013. 978-1-61780-846-3. Kaylan and Volman met with director Charles Swenson on June 7, 1973;Kaylan, Howard, \\"Officially Bipolar\\". Shell Shocked. Pp. 190-191. Backbeat, 2013. 978-1-61780-846-3. Swenson had written the screenplay for Kaylan and Volman under the title Cheap! The film's production budget was $110,000. According to Swenson, he created almost all of the animation himself, although publicity attributed the animation work to the Murakami-Wolf Production Company, with Academy Award Winning animator Fred Wolf, credited as his son's name, Bill Wolf, helped animate parts of the film personally. Kaylan and Volman recorded the music at Cherokee Studios with The Robbs serving as their backing band, credited as Flo & Eddie. During production, Roger Corman observed the title, Cheap! as a shot at his production techniques, and asked that the title be changed; film director Mick Garris suggested that Corman did not want to release a film titled Roger Corman's Cheap!, though Corman was not credited as producer on the film. Although the film was promoted as an X-rated animated film, New World Pictures had not actually submitted it to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The film was officially promoted as Dirty Duck, although the title on the film itself reads Down and Dirty Duck. Despite the use of the title Dirty Duck, the film has nothing to do with the Dirty Duck character created by Bobby London and published in National Lampoon and Playboy magazines. Release and reception Dirty Duck premiered in Los Angeles on July 8, 1974.Kaylan, Howard, \\"Getting Spit On By the Boss Himself!\\". Shell Shocked. P. 215. Backbeat, 2013. 978-1-61780-846-3. The distributor did not promote it heavily, and most reviewers disliked it. Because the film was X-rated, The New York Times refused to run the film's advertisement. This was a somewhat awkward situation, as the ad included a positive review from The New York Times. According to Swenson, \\"it didn't have a big following, ... but it is still in video stores.\\" The film played for about two weeks in New York City. Jerry Beck wrote a review in which he called the film \\"raunchier than Ralph Bakshi's films.\\" He went on to say that the humor of the film \\"is good, but the design and drawing is downright awful. It seems to be sort of a cross between Jules Feiffer and Gahan Wilson, if that can be imagined.\\" Beck also stated that the film was \\"very similar to R. Crumb's Mr. Natural and Flakey Foont. There is no reason that the duck should be a duck. Every character in the film is human, and he just seems to be a duck just to give the film a catchy title. There are some highly imaginative animated ideas here, but the film's entertainment value is at a minimum.\\" Beck later called the film \\"one of the most overlooked animated features of the 1970s, a glorious experimental mess of a film, which, from today‚Äôs vantage point, looks incredibly creative and daring, and something current Hollywood studios would never attempt.\\" Playboy noted that the advertisements for the film said, \\"this film has no socially redeeming value\\" and continued \\"well, that's dead right, yet this movie has some value as a promising X-rated cartoon in the tradition of Ralph Bakshi's Fritz the Cat. The New York Times called it a \\"zany, lively, uninhibited, sexual odyssey that manages to mix a bit of Walter Mitty and a touch of Woody Allen with some of the innocence of Walt Disney [and the] urban smarts of Ralph Bakshi\\".

A detailed, although biased, description of King 'Lubossi' (the spelling used) can be found in the Portuguese explorer Alexandre de Serpa Pinto's 1878‚Äì1879 travel narrative Como eu atravessei a √Åfrica (How I Crossed Africa, in English translation).  Biography  In December 1882 the missionary Frederick Stanley Arnot reached Lealui, the capital of Barotseland, after traveling across the Kalahari Desert from Botswana. King Lewanika kept him for the next eighteen months, then allowed him to move on, but in a westward direction rather than eastward as he had planned. While detained, Arnot taught the king's children to read and undertook some evangelism. Arnot was present when Lewanika received a proposal from the Ndebele for an alliance to resist the white men. Arnot may have helped Lewanika to see the advantages of a British protectorate in terms of the greater wealth and security it would provide. Arnot left Bulozi in 1884 to recover his health and to escape a brewing rebellion against Lewanika. When Lewanika crushed the rebellion, George Westbeech described the scene: \\"The flat from Lia-liue to Mongu, a distance of twelve miles without a bush, is even now covered with skeletons and grinning skulls....\\" Before this event, his name had simply been Lubosi; after it, he had taken on the name Lewanika (meaning \\"Conqueror\\"). Lewanika brought Barotseland, now part of Zambia, under British control in 1890, when he agreed with Cecil Rhodes for the region to become a protectorate under the British South Africa Company (BSAC). However, he felt deceived by the BSAC terms as they worked in practice, and he appealed, unsuccessfully, to the British Crown. Lewanika told Dr James Johnston how he had written to the British asking that his kingdom should be made a British Protectorate. He had waited years for a reply and then men had arrived with papers claiming that they had the power to make this happen. The King was reassured as the local missionary. Monsier Coillard, was his interpreter at the meeting and the King was reassured by Coillard's confidence in these men. Lewanika had been thankful that his wish had been granted and he had sent two enormous elephant ivory tusks as a present for Queen Victoria. Lewanika was incensed to find that the men were from a South African company and that the ivory tusks were not with Queen Victoria but as ornaments in the directors board room. Johnston assisted Lewanika in writing a letter of protest. Lewanika was to prove a great help to Johnston as he was able to command assistance for Johnston from nearby subordinate chiefs.Reality versus romance in South Central Africa, Dr J Johnston, Archive.org, Retrieved 25 September 2015 In 1902, Lewanika visited London for the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, where he was treated with respect and had an audience with King Edward and an informal meeting with the Prince of Wales. When asked what he would discuss with the British sovereign, he said \\"When we kings meet we always have plenty to talk about\\". Family Lewanika's eldest son was named Litia, and succeeded as Yeta III on his father¬¥s death. His third son Imwiko succeeded his brother in 1945, but died three years later and was succeeded by a third brother, Mwanawina III. On his death in 1968, a fourth brother Mbikusita reigned as Litunga from 1968 to 1977 as Lewanika II. A newspaper-article from 1902 mentioned two sons, Imaski and Lubasci, who were educated in the UK at the time, and a son-in-law called Ishi-Kambai. One of his daughters worked as a teacher in his capital, and another was reported to have died while he was in the United Kingdom in 1902. Lewanika's youngest daughter was Her Royal Highness Lundambuyu Dorcas Lewanika, who ruled as Mboajikana in Kalabo District, from 1959 to 1995. She has two children Maureen Mwangala Mutau and Martin Mwanangombe Mutau, however she fostered many children and orphans. The Lewanika name continues to be used as part of a family name, for instance by Lewanika II's children Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika, a Zambian statesman and Inonge Mbikusita-Lewanika, an ambassador of the Republic of Zambia in the United States.

He was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the third round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at Stanford. Early life The son of former Cincinnati Bengals running back Stanley Wilson Sr., Stanley Jr. grew up in Carson, California with his grandparents and attended Bishop Montgomery High School in Torrance. College career Recruited by Tyrone Willingham, Wilson enrolled at Stanford University in 2000. After redshirting his true freshman season, Wilson played four seasons on the Stanford Cardinal football team from 2001 to 2004, the last three under coach Walt Harris. Wilson became a regular starter as a sophomore in 2002, with 32 tackles (27 solo) and two interceptions. In 2003, Wilson had 27 tackles, six passes defended, and one interception. As a senior in 2004, Wilson recorded career highs with 54 tackles (41 solo and 2.5 for loss) and five passes defended, in addition to one interception returned for 51 yards, and earned honorable mention All-Pac-10 honors. Professional career In the 2005 NFL draft, the Detroit Lions picked Wilson in the third round (72nd overall). Wilson's NFL career lasted from 2005 to 2007, all with the Lions. In 32 games (nine starts) in the NFL, Wilson had 86 tackles (63 solo), eight passes deflected, and one forced fumble. On November 28, 2007, Wilson was placed on injured reserve due to a knee injury. The Lions re-signed Wilson to a one-year deal on April 11, 2008. However, Wilson tore his Achilles tendon during an exhibition game against the New York Giants on August 7, an injury later revealed to be season-ending. Legal issues On June 22, 2016, Wilson was shot by an elderly homeowner in Portland, Oregon, after Wilson attempted to break into the man's home while naked. He was hospitalized but recovered from his injuries and was charged with attempted burglary. In November 2016, Wilson tested positive for methamphetamines. He was arrested again in Portland on January 10, 2017, while again nude; the arresting officer noted he appeared to be on drugs when he was caught roaming naked around another neighborhood. On February 13, 2017, Wilson was sentenced to 10 days in jail with three years of probation for the June incident where he was shot; the judge also ordered him to undergo drug treatment, pay restitution for damages caused to homes, and write apology letters. On February 18, 2017, Wilson was arrested naked a third time allegedly attempting to burglarize a home.

It operated during the summer between 1986 and 1996. It was the first regular service from New York to the Cape since 1964. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad previously had operated a train under this name until 1958. From its demise in 1996 there was no passenger rail service to Cape Cod until the beginning of the summer of 2013 when the MBTA's CapeFLYER began connecting Boston's South Station to Hyannis.  History  The Cape Codder used the Northeast Corridor to Attleboro, Massachusetts, where it split to reach Cape Cod RS-1 leading, in July 1990 =NY,NH&H; service= Service beyond Harwich to Provincetown at the end of the Cape ended by the late 1930s. Regular service was suspended from 1941 to 1948, owing to World War II. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad ran combined through trains with the Pennsylvania Railroad from Washington to Hyannis until 1958. The Day Cape Codder and Neptune combined to provide service six days per week July-September, with the Day Cape Codder operating all days except Wednesday and Friday and the Neptune operating on Fridays only. The trains ran from New York to Hyannis, with a section splitting at Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts for Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Passengers coming from Boston connected in Providence, Rhode Island. The PRR and the NH offered a night train, The Night Cape Codder, from Washington and New York on Friday nights. The companies offered a return train from the Cape on Sunday nights. The companies' New York-Cape Cod service from 1958 to 1964 was summer only. The New Haven Railroad stopped serving Cape Cod altogether in 1964. The train operated as an express in Connecticut and on the Cape. In the latter case, it bypassed stations served by the Boston-Hyannis trains. Station stops on Day Cape Codder: Grand Central Terminal, 125th Street, Stamford, New Haven, New London, Providence, Taunton, Buzzards Bay, Yarmouth, Hyannis. The stations from 125th to Providence were only for receiving passengers, heading east, and the oppose, when heading west. At Buzzard Bay, a branch would split for Woods Hole where passengers could catch steamers for Nantucket Island.'Official Guide of the Railways,' June, 1949, Tables 39, 40 =Amtrak service= Amtrak launched the Cape Codder on July 3, 1986. The original schedule included four trains weekly: trains from New York to Hyannis on Friday evening (#272) and Saturday morning (#270), and trains from Hyannis to New York on Saturday (#271) and Sunday afternoon (#273). Amtrak advertised the service as \\"Washington-New York-Hyannis\\", although only #272 originated in Washington. All other connections required a connecting train. The train operated through September and featured \\"Club Service: Deluxe reserved seating. Beverages and complimentary meals served at your seat.\\". For the 1988 season Amtrak established connections with the Cape Cod and Hyannis Railroad, a tourist railroad which in partnership with Massachusetts offered daily service from Boston to the Cape, originating at the Braintree MBTA station. Amtrak passengers coming off the Northeast Corridor could be through-ticketed destinations on the Cape and would change to Cape Cod and Hyannis train at Attleboro. Separate sections served Hyannis and Falmouth. This service supplemented the weekend Cape Codder, once again providing daily service to the Cape. This interline service did not resume in 1989 after the Cape Cod and Hyannis Railroad folded. Amtrak service to Attleboro ended at the same time. Massachusetts provided financial support for the trains from 1986-1988. Beginning in 1989 Amtrak truncated the Saturday round-trip to Providence with a scheduled connection to another train; this round-trip was named Clamdigger for the 1990 season and given new numbers (#433 westbound and #438 eastbound). The Friday/Sunday train pair became #234/#235. By 1993 the Saturday service was gone and the Friday/Sunday pair operated to New York only, with connections south. For its final season in 1996 the Cape Codder originated in Boston, ran down the Northeast Corridor to Providence, then turned and ran east to Hyannis. Service from Washington and New York was available via a connecting train in Providence. Amtrak did not resume the Cape Codder for the 1997 season. The limited schedule, coupled with the fact that passengers found it difficult to navigate the Cape without an automobile, discouraged potential passengers. The service carried just 1,200 passengers in 1996, representing a 50% drop from 1995. Since its demise in 1996, were periodic discussions about reinstating passenger rail service from Boston to reduce car traffic to and from the Cape, with officials in Bourne seeking to extend MBTA Commuter Rail service from Middleboro to Buzzards Bay. Scheduled passenger service between Boston and Hyannis resumed in May 2013 with the inauguration of the CapeFLYER, a collaboration between the Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, and it was made permanent in the 2014 summer season after a successful trial run during the first year.

From the Heidelberger Totentanz, c. 1488. The Bladder pipe (German: Platerspiel or Blaterpfeife) is a medieval simplified bagpipe, consisting of an insufflation tube (blow pipe), a bladder (bag) and a chanter; sounded by a double reed, which is fitted into a reed seat at the top of the chanter. The reed, inside the inflated bladder, is sounded continuously, and cannot be tongued. Some bladder pipes were made with a single drone pipe, and reproductions are similar to a loud, continuous crumhorn. The chanter has an outside tenon, at the top, near the reed, which fits into a socket or stock, which is then tied into the bladder. History While the first creation of a double reed pipe with a bladder controlling breath is unknown, it is believed to have originated in Europe before the 13th century. As an intermediate phase between the almost pan-European bagpipe and the Renaissance crumhorn, the Bladder pipe flourished from the 14th to 16th centuries.One type of early crumhorn has a ...lower end is made of animal horn, which may be traceable back to the structure of certain types of bagpipes, principally the bladder pipe...

The bag of the Votic bagpipe rakkopilli was made of a pig's bladder. It had no drone (see Engl. bladder pipe, Germ. Platerspiel).

The early bladder pipe is in a family of the early medieval \\"chorus\\" instruments, a word which in medieval Latin was frequently used also for the bagpipe. In the earliest illustrated forms of bladder pipe, such as the well-known example of the 13th century reproduced by Martin Gerbert from a manuscript at Sankt Blasien Abbey in the Black Forest, the bladder is unusually large, and the chanter (or melody pipe) has, instead of a bell, the carved head of an animal. At first the chanter was a straight conical tube terminating in a bell, as in the bagpipe. The later instruments have a pipe of larger calibre more or less curved and bent back as in the letter \\"J\\" as the crumhorn, tournebout, and cromorne. This curvature, coming from the shape of an animal horn, suggests the early crumhorn's development from a bladder pipe. One famous illustration of these bladder pipes appears in the 13th-century Spanish manuscript, known as the Cantigas de Santa Maria in the library of El Escorial in Madrid, together with a bladder pipe having two pipes, a chanter and a drone side by side. Another Platerspiel David is illustrated by Sebastian Virdung (1511). Other forms There was practically no technical difference between the bent chanter of the bladder pipe and the cromorne, the only distinction being the form and size of the air-chamber, either the bladder or the wind-cap, in which the reed was set in vibration. The player blows air into the bladder through the insufflation tube, or through the raised, slit-shaped opening of the wind cap, placed against the player's lips. This earlier Italian form of bladder pipe is found illustrated at the end of the 15th century in the Book of Hours, known as the Sforza Book. cites British Museum. In literature An allusion to the bladder pipe occurs in an old English ballad: :Eight shepherds were playing on various instruments: \\"The fyrst hed ane drone bagpipe, the next hed ane pipe maid of ane bleddir and of ane reid, the third playit on ane trump.\\" This excerpt suggests the early English bladder pipe retained a distinct form, and did not become merged with the bagpipe.

This instrument is not unlike the cor anglais in rough outline, being a conical tube of approximately the same length, terminating in a small globular bell, but having neither holes nor keys; it is blown through a cupshaped mouthpiece made of horn. The Holztrompete is in the key of C; the scale is produced by overblowing, whereby the upper partials from the 2nd to the 6th are produced. A single piston placed at a third of the distance from the mouthpiece to the bell gives the notes D and F. Harmonic Series. Wagner inserted a note in the score concerning the cor anglais for which the part was originally scored, and advised the use of oboe or clarinet to reinforce the latter, the effect intended being that of a powerful natural instrument, unless a wooden instrument with a natural scale be specially made for the part, which would be preferable. The Holztrompete was used at Munich for the first performance of Tristan and Isolde, and was still in use there in 1897. At Bayreuth it was also used for the Tristan performances at the festivals of 1886 and 1889, but in 1891 Wilhelm Heckel's clarina, an instrument partaking of the nature of both oboe and clarinet, was substituted for the Holztrompete and was found more effective. notes: Communicated by Madame Wagner, December 28th, 1897.

The band had broken up in April 1971 due to differences between singer Paul Rodgers and bassist Andy Fraser but had now reformed.Free Official Home Page Recording All members of the band made a concerted effort to work smoothly and efficiently for guitarist Paul Kossoff's sake as he was suffering due to an addiction to Mandrax (Quaaludes). For example, in a symbolic gesture all tracks were credited to every member of the band regardless of who actually wrote them. The attitude to the songwriting was also vastly different;FreeTheBand.co.uk/Free-at-Last there are no outright rock songs at all, and the three songs that contain fast-paced moments all have slower, more introspective moments. Also, many fans have interpreted some of the melancholic lyrics (many of which concern people in some form of emotional distress) as referring to Kossoff.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhXzDTf0mp8 Reception The album was reasonably successful, peaking at #9 in the UK album charts making it their most successful UK studio album since Fire and Water (1970). The single release \\"Little Bit of Love\\" reached #13; despite failing to enter the top ten it was still their third best selling single release (it would be beaten by \\"Wishing Well\\" the following year). However, problems began again when the band was then expected to tour to promote the album, as Kossoff was faced with a task for which he was not physically capable. Gigs had been disastrous, with Fraser remembering that \\"you could see people in the audience crying for him, longing for him to be all right\\" (quoted in Phil Sutcliffe's liner notes). Unable to continue, Fraser left the band permanently, aged just 20. Kossoff also pulled out of the tour (although not technically leaving the band) in order to seek treatment for his drug addiction.Corbin Reiff: Forgotten Heroes - Paul Kossoff at PremierGuitar.com, 6 December, 2013 During the period in late 1971 where the band had split, Kossoff and Kirke had formed a new band with Japanese bassist Tetsu Yamauchi and keyboard player John \\"Rabbit\\" Bundrick; Kirke asked them to join the Free tour in place of Fraser. They accepted, and soon joined the band officially.

He joined the faculty of the University of Virginia in 1970 after having taught for many years (since 1950) at Johns Hopkins University. During his tenure at Johns Hopkins, Deese became Chairman of the Psychology Department and also served a term as Chairman of the American Psychological Association. Deese later became the Chairman of the Psychology Department at University of Virginia until his partial retirement, later remaining as professor emeritus. He received the Hugh Scott Hamilton award for his distinguished service. Personal life Deese, a 1/2 Lumbee Indian was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, on December 14, 1921. James Deese's father was Thomas D. Deese, a full-blooded Lumbee Indian whose parents, James M. Deese and Sarah Jane Chavis were from Burnt Swamp N.C. Deese's mother, Serene Jane Johnson was from Wisconsin. Deese was first cousin of American aerospace engineer and scientist James Henry Deese. Deese was raised in Southern California and during his early college years, he worked as a page at the early television studios. Deese retained a love for Southern California‚Äîits geography, its culture and history his entire life. Deese married Ellin Ruth Krauss in 1948. Ellin was raised in a Jewish family from New York. Her father, Lawrence Krauss was a prominent government attorney in Washington D.C. Ellin converted later in her life, eventually pursuing a Masters of Divinity and becoming an Episcopal Priest quite late in her life. Ellin was Priest in Charge at Buck Mountain Episcopal Church in Earlysville, Virginia, where James eventually became the Church organist. The couple met when James was teaching at the University of Wisconsin. James and Ellin had 2 children, Elizabeth and James L. Deese. Deese had a passionate love for classical music and enjoyed playing the piano from the time he was a child, well into his older age. Deese also collected rare books. He particularly loved 18th Century literature, and he also enjoyed late 19th Century and early 20th Century essayists. At the time of his death in 1999 most of his extensive collection was donated, upon the wishes of his family, to the University of Virginia. Deese died at his home in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1999, just three months before his wife also died. The couple had just celebrated their 50th anniversary on Christmas Eve of 1998. Interests Deese attended Chapman College in Orange, CA, where he earned his B.A. degree in psychology. Deese later earned his doctorate at Indiana University. Later in his career, Deese was honored with an honorary Doctorate from Chapman. While attending Indiana University, Deese became fascinated by animal behavior and how it related to human behavior, particularly in the area of communication. He studied under B.F. Skinner and W. N. Kellogg. Later, Deese moved more into the area of Psycho-Linguistics and worked with other early pioneers in that field such as Noam Chomsky. Deese became mentor to many doctoral students who went on further to develop the field of learning, cognition, and language, such as Leonard M. Horowitz, William P. Banks, Allyssa McCabe, and Herbert H. Clark. Publications Deese was revered by his students and highly respected by his peers. He has authored or partnered in 14 books addressing various aspects of the Psychology of Learning (several books authored by Deese or co-authored with Stewart Hulse) and later, Psycholinguistics. A popular book from 1965 was called The Structure of Associations in Language and Thought (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1965). Later, having branched out more into the area of Social Psychology, Deese wrote, American Freedom and the Social Sciences (Columbia University Press, 1985). Deese and his wife Ellin Krauss Deese co- authored the popular student manual, How to Study, which remains in print and regularly used by Freshman College Students into the 21st Century.

About 140 patients have been reported, almost half of them of Finnish origin. Individuals from Japan, Italy, Morocco and North Africa have also been reported. Signs and symptoms Infants with LPI are usually symptom-free when breastfed because of the low protein concentration in human milk, but develop vomiting and diarrhea after weaning. The patients show failure to thrive, poor appetite, growth retardation, enlarged liver and spleen, prominent osteoporosis and osteopenia, delayed bone age and spontaneous protein aversion. Forced feeding of protein may lead to convulsions and coma. Mental development is normal if prolonged episode of hyperammonemia can be avoided. Some patients develop severe pulmonary and kidney complications. High levels of plasma glutamine and glycine are observed. Causes It has been associated with SLC7A7. Mechanism autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. In LPI, urinary excretion of cationic amino acids (ornithine, arginine and lysine) is increased and these amino acids are poorly absorbed from the intestine. Therefore, their plasma concentrations are low and their body pools become depleted. Deficiency of arginine and ornithine restricts the function of the urea cycle and leads to hyperammonemia after protein-rich meals. Deficiency of lysine may play a major role in the skeletal and immunological abnormalities observed in LPI patients. Diagnosis The diagnosis is based on the biochemical findings (increased concentrations of lysine, arginine and ornithine in urine and low concentrations of these amino acids in plasma, elevation of urinary orotic acid excretion after protein-rich meals, and inappropriately high concentrations of serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes) and the screening of known mutations of the causative gene from a DNA sample. Treatment Treatment of LPI consists of protein-restricted diet and supplementation with oral *GeneReview/NIH/UW entry on Lysinuric Protein Intolerance citrulline. Citrulline is a neutral amino acid that improves the function of the urea cycle and allows sufficient protein intake without hyperammonemia. Prognosis Under proper dietary control and supplementation, the majority of the LPI patients are able to have a nearly normal life. However, severe complications including pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and chronic kidney disease may develop even with proper treatment. Fertility appears to be normal in women, but mothers with LPI have an increased risk for complications during pregnancy and delivery.

He was nominated to the Constitutional Council as a civil representative on 10 September 2015.Civil Representatives nominated to Constitutional Council, News.lk He received the Jamnalal Bajaj Award in 1991. Biography A.T. Ariyaratne was born on 5 November 1931 in Unawatuna village in Galle District of Sri Lanka. He had his school education at Buona Vista College, Unawatuna and Mahinda College, Galle. Then he attended a teachers college, after which he was a high school teacher until 1972 at Nalanda College Colombo. Ariyaratne started his work on Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement in 1958. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from Vidyodaya University of Sri Lanka and later received an honorary doctorate of D.Litt. from the same university. He also received an honorary doctorate of humanities from Emilio Aguinaldo College in the Philippines. Ariyaratne is a devout Buddhist and continues to be active in Sri Lankan politics and community development. He received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership in 1969, the Gandhi Peace Prize from the government of India in 1996, the Niwano Peace Prize in 1992, the King Beaudoin Award and other international honours for his work in peace making and village development. In 2006, he received the Acharya Sushil Kumar International Peace Award for the year 2005. Other recipients of this award include John Polanyi and then in 2004, the 14th Dalai Lama. In 2007 Ariyaratne received the Sri Lankabhimanya, the highest National Honour of Sri Lanka. Ariyaratne, a strong believer in Gandhian principles of non-violence, rural development and self- sacrifice, has shaped the Sarvodaya Movement in ways that forged a significant link between secular principles of development and Buddhist ideals of selflessness and compassion. As a devout Buddhist, he has led tens of thousands of \\"family gatherings\\" and meditations with millions of people throughout Sri Lanka and other parts of the world. When he received the Hubert H. Humphrey International Humanitarian Award from the University of Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs in 1994, Dr. Patrick Mendis described his former mentor as the \\"Gandhi of Sri Lanka.\\" He is married to Neetha, and has six children- Vinya, Charika, Jeevan, Sadee, Diyath,Nimna .He also has 12 grandchildren - Janatha Marasinghe,Damni Marasinghe,Hasala Ariyaratne, Aseni Ariyaratne,Jithvan Ariyaratne, Kanishtaa Ariyaratne,Tiara Ganegama,Sanara De Silva,Liana Ariyaratne,Niven Ganegama,Sanchit De Silva,Diyana Ariyaratne. Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement A. T. Ariyaratne addressing a gathering Ariyaratne started this movement when he took, \\"forty high school students and twelve teachers from Nalanda College Colombo on \\"an educational experiment\\" to an outcaste village and helped the villagers fix it up.Bond, George. \\"Buddhism at Work: Community Development, Social Empowerment and the Sarvodaya Movement\\". (Kumarian P, 2003) 7 After many of these \\"educational experiments\\" took place and were successful, Ariyaratne and others developed ideals that have served as the basis of the Sarvodaya Movement. As a socially-engaged Buddhist movement, it contains three strands: \\"Gandhian ideals, Buddhist philosophy, and ecumenical spirituality.\\"Bond, George. \\"Buddhism at Work: Community Development, Social Empowerment and the Sarvodaya Movement\\". (Kumarian P, 2003) 8 The original Sanskrit definition of Sarvodaya is \\"the welfare of all,\\" but Ariyaratne has redefined the term to reflect a Buddhist ideal, \\"the awakening of all.\\"Bond, George. \\"Buddhism at Work: Community Development, Social Empowerment and the Sarvodaya Movement\\". (Kumarian P, 2003) 2 The Sarvodaya movement places the people at the center of social change, \\"The village represents the heart of the nation and the source of its spiritual and moral vision.\\"Bond, George. \\"Buddhism at Work: Community Development, Social Empowerment and the Sarvodaya Movement\\". (Kumarian P, 2003) 45 His movement focuses on the political empowerment of the village, Buddhist awakening, and rural development. The call of this movement has been for a non-violent spiritual revolution to replace structural violence as the basis of the social order. This spiritual revolution features the Buddhist value of non-violence it also promotes a no poverty, no affluence society. Ariyaratne's Buddhist Ideas Ariyaratne focuses on the Buddhist concepts of nonviolence, impermanence, no-self, and the Four Noble Truths. Ariyaratne uses the Buddhist approach to nonviolence which \\"is grounded in a systematic 'attitude adjustment' in which negative, reactive states such as hatred, greed, and delusion are transformed into positive social orientations through meditative self-training.\\"Queen, Christopher S. \\"The Peace Wheel: Nonviolent Activism in the Buddhist Tradition.\\" In Subverting Hatred, edited by Daniel L. Smith-Christopher, 25‚Äì47 (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 1998) 31 Ariyaratne uses this idea of nonviolence to promote the village development that is a major part of Sarvodaya Shramadana. By helping those who are suffering from things such as poverty, one is helping to get rid of some of the violence in those lives. Ariyaratne also uses the idea of impermanence as a basis for the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement. This is because the \\"realization of the impermanence and interdependence of selves in society and nature entails the deepest respect for all.\\" Because of the impermanence of life, it is important to overcome suffering whenever possible and by helping others overcome their suffering demonstrates the interdependence of all beings. Buddhists believe that interdependence is an important part of life and when one understands that they are dependent on others they can begin to see why it is important to help those who are suffering even if you may not be. The help that one can do through the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement can help do this and is one of the aims of the movement as a whole. Another Buddhist concept that Ariyaratne focuses on with the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement is the idea of no-self. This is emphasised to Sarvodaya members because they \\"see this selfless service to others as a way of changing their own consciousness into a more awakened and compassionate state on the way to Nirvana.\\"Mitchell, Donald W. Buddhism: Introducing the Buddhist Experience (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 326. Ariyaratne argues that the idea of no-self is brought out through the service that is done through Sarvodaya Shramadana. The people that volunteer to become members of the movement are doing so out of their own compassion because it is not something that they are required to do. This means that they are giving up their own time to serve others which goes along with the Buddhist concept of no-self. Ariyaratne reinterprets the Four Noble Truths. The First Noble Truth is suffering which means that one needs to recognise that suffering occurs throughout the world. The Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement reinterprets this to mean that \\"villagers should recognize problems such as poverty, disease, oppression, and disunity in their environment.\\"Bond, George D. Buddhism at Work (Bloomfield, CT: Kumarian Press, 2004), 15. Ariyaratne argues that these things are types of sufferings that occur throughout Sri Lanka and the rest of the world. It is important for all people to recognise that these sufferings exist and they should be addressed by those who have the ability to help with the suffering on both an individual level as well as with the community as a whole. The Second Noble Truth is the origin of suffering which means one needs to understand where the suffering throughout the world is coming from. Ariyaratne reinterprets this to mean \\"the decadent condition of the village has one or more causes. Sarvodaya teaches that the causes lie in factors such as egoism, competition, greed, and hatred.\\"Bond, George D. \\"A. T. Ariyaratne and the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement in Sri Lanka.\\" In Engaged Buddhism, edited by Christopher S. Queen and Sallie B. King, 121‚Äì146 (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1996), 130 These causes point to the things that the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement is trying to overcome with its programs on both an individual level and for the community as a whole. Ariyaratne feels that egoism, competition, greed, and hatred cause much of the suffering in the world and should be combated and can be combated by social action programs such as the ones formed by the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement. They need to be removed from the individual person so that these qualities are no longer one's own qualities. The Third Noble Truth is cessation, or the end of suffering, which means that one needs to understand that suffering can be ended through achieving Nirvana. The Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement reinterprets this to mean \\"the villagers' suffering can cease.\\"Bond, George D. Buddhism at Work (Bloomfield, CT: Kumarian Press, 2004), 16. Ariyaratne feels that since one's personal sufferings can end with this Buddhist concept the sufferings of each individual villagers' suffering can also end through the help of other people. The Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement seeks to do this by helping villagers rebuild their lives and form a strong community bond that is based on helping one another. The Fourth Noble Truth means that the end of this suffering can be attained by Eightfold Path to Nirvana. The Eightfold Path includes right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. Ariyaratne reinterprets this to mean that each part of the Eightfold Path can be applied to the restoration of the people. For example, in the case of right mindfulness, Sarvodaya Shramadana interprets this to mean that one needs to \\"stay open and alert to the needs of the village.\\"Bond, George D. \\"A. T. Ariyaratne and the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement in Sri Lanka.\\" In Engaged Buddhism, edited by Christopher S. Queen and Sallie B. King, 121‚Äì146 (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1996), 130. This means that if one sees something that needs to be done throughout the community such as with bathrooms, water, or roads then one should attend to those needs. Doing so will help each person in the community and help relieve some form of their suffering. Buddhist Economics Ariyaratne has been characterised by some as a Buddhist modernist for his reinterpretation or reapplication of Buddhist principles to fit his social action work. His modernism can be seen in his call for Buddhist monks and laity alike to be active in village life. The village is central to Ariyaratne's solution to Sri Lanka's troubles. Ariyaratne sees his idealised version of ancient Sri Lankan villages as the center of the social order.Bond, George. \\"Buddhism at Work: Community Development, Social Empowerment and the Sarvodaya Movement\\". (Kumarian P, 2003) 29, 45 Ariyaratne focuses on economic solutions through application of Buddhist principles which he calls \\"Buddhist Economics.\\" In one of his lectures he states, \\"The economic life of a human being cannot be separated from his total life and living. Buddha Dhamma looks at life as a whole. In fact the entire world is treated as a whole in Buddha‚Äôs teachings. Without this holistic understanding of life it is difficult for humans to follow the path of happiness, He showed. Economics is only a fragment of life and living. Therefore moral and social implications of economic activity cannot be considered apart from economics.\\"Ariyaratne, A. T. \\"Buddhist Economics in Practice in the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement of Sri Lanka.\\" (New York: Sarvodaya Support Group, 1999.) 3‚Äì4 Ariyaratne often critiques consumerism, capitalism, and the rising divide between the rich and the poor. With a modernist global view, Ariyaratne often criticises the west and international organisations such as the World Bank. He states that the West has created \\"large-scale methods and systems, created by man and capable of dominating man, in place of simple social, economic, and political institutions which man could dominate.\\"Bond, George. \\"Buddhism at Work: Community Development, Social Empowerment and the Sarvodaya Movement\\". (Kumarian P, 2003) 49 Ariyaratne believes that through grassroots efforts directed by Buddhism these problems can be overcome. A central part of his social action agenda is non-violence. Ariyaratne calls for non-violent action. He has been actively working for peace in Sri Lanka for many decades, and has stated that the only way to peace is through \\"the dispelling of the view of 'I and mine' or the shedding of 'self' and the realization of the true doctrines of the interconnection between all animal species and the unity of all humanity,\\"Bond, George. \\"Buddhism at Work: Community Development, Social Empowerment and the Sarvodaya Movement\\". (Kumarian P, 2003) 42 thus advocating social action in Buddhist terms. He stated in one of his lectures, \\"When we work towards the welfare of all the means we use have to be based on Truth, Non-violence and Selflessness in conformity with Awakening of All.\\".Bond, George. \\"Buddhism at Work: Community Development, Social Empowerment and the Sarvodaya Movement\\". (Kumarian P, 2003) What Ariyaratne advocates is losing the self in the service of others and attempting to bring others to awakening. Ariyaratne has stated, \\"I cannot awaken myself unless I help awaken others.\\". Selected Quotes From Ariyaratne: *Now the time has come when science and technology on the one hand and spiritual wisdom on the other have to be synthesised on a global scale to build a nobler, more just and more peaceful global community.Bond, George. \\"Buddhism at Work: Community Development, Social Empowerment and the Sarvodaya Movement\\". Kumarian P, 2003. *When we work towards the welfare of all the means we use have to be based on Truth, Non-violence and Selflessness in conformity with Awakening of All. *Buddha's first admonition to the bhikkus or monks was to go forth into the world and work for the welfare of the people. *One has to understand the past role and, profiting by modern experience, design a new role in which development basically oriented to the needs of the people finds major expression. *Our Buddhist culture taught us from our young days how we should keep in mind our welfare not only in this life but also in the afterlife as well in whatever we think, say or do. Belief in Rebirth and the Karmic Law ‚Äì Law of Cause and Effect, were two fundamental teachings we were taught to keep in mind. Economics and Politics or any other department of life cannot function without adverse consequences if we resort to unrighteous or wrongful ways. Good ends can be realised only by good means.Ariyaratne, A. T. Buddhist Economics in Practice in the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement of Sri Lanka. New York: Sarvodaya Support Group, 1999. *Sarvodaya means the Awakening of All ‚Äì from an individual Human Personality to Humanity as a whole.

Bishopston gives its name to the Bishopston Mudstone, a name used by geologists to refer to a rock formation with a widespread occurrence in south Wales.  Etymology  The name Bishopston originates from the Norman conquest, however pre-Norman names for the town vary. One name was Llanmerwall (or Llanmerwallt), and is similar to the modern Welsh name. Two further names are recorded however, firstly Porthdulon (or Porthtulon) possibly referring to the area of Caswell, and the name Llancyngur Trosgardi.  Shops and services  Bishopston has several shops including a Co-Op. Other local services include a hotel and cafe, three public houses, a petrol station, retirement homes, post office, church halls, sports hall, medical centre and children's play area.  Education  The town has its own schools, Bishopston Primary School and Bishopston Comprehensive School. Bishopston Comprehensive School is currently undergoing a series of refurbishments, including the construction of a new block. The new building will accommodate drama, science & art facilities.  Tourist attractions  Many people visiting Bishopston are attracted to its coastline, mainly Caswell Bay because of its easy accessibility, car parking, seasonal bus service, shops and cafes, public toilets, open-air showers, and seasonal lifeguarding.
