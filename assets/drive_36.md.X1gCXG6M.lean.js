It is written by Yanbei Xianren (ÁáïÂåóÈó≤‰∫∫), the pen name of Wen Kang (ÊñáÂ∫∑ fl. 1821-1850), a Manchu of an Eight Banner family. The novel is composed of vignettes that concern He Yufeng (‰ΩïÁéâÂá§), also called \\"Thirteenth Sister\\" (ÂçÅ‰∏âÂ¶π). He Yufeng seeks revenge for her father, who died in prison because of persecution by a high official. She rescues a virtuous young woman, Ms. Zhang, and a heroic young scholar, An Ji (ÂÆâÈ™•) from cannibals. When An Ji becomes a high official, he marries both Hu and Zhang and when a new emperor ascends the throne, her father finally receives justice. Her actions are characterized by the traditional Confucian virtues, loyalty, piety, righteousness, love and heroism but the resolution of the novel comes through luck, or fate. Place in the history of the Chinese novel The outline of the plot seems to borrow from Haoqiu zhuan, a 17th-century Scholar-Beauty romance in which a well-educated young lady acts independently but within the confines of propriety. The novel brings together two separate genres, chivalric fiction and Scholar-Beauty Romance, among the first to do so. The critic Lee Haiyan remarks that the novel is also \\"highly original in its efforts to incorporate the moral and aesthetic insights of the cult of qing into orthodox Confucianism,\\" that is, the cult of \\"feeling.\\" The scholar Maram Epstein finds the novel \\"remarkable\\" for its \\"depiction of elite women who assume the roles of scholars, statesmen, and knights-errant.\\" In contrast to Dream of the Red Chamber, where the women were \\"ten times\\" better than the men but were confined to the domestic sphere, the women in this novel displace men in their traditionally male roles, even in the Confucian roles of social engagement. It opens with this observation: > Most people nowadays regard ern√º and yingxiong as two different kinds of > people... They mistakenly think that those who indulge in force and like > fighting are \\"yiongxiong\\", while those who toy with rouge and powder or have > a weakness for catamites are \\"ern≈±\\" ... What they don't realize is that only > when one has the pure nature of a hero can one fully possess a loving heart, > and only when one is a truly filial child can one perform heroic deeds.... Lee contrasts this with the homosocial world of chivalric fiction of earlier times, which displayed a hostile attitude toward women and their corrupting influence. The novel was adapted a number of times into films and television.

It was intended to become the capital of the proposed Marcomannia province (Moravia). Geography The site is located on the Dyje-Svratka-Jihlava confluence. It is situated 18 km from Brno and 86 km from Vienna. History The castra in Mu≈°ov originated as a Roman army camp. Its original name is unknown (possibly, but uncertainly, it was Eburon, from Ptolemy's EŒ≤œÖœÅŒøŒΩ). Romans made it his base of operations in the campaigns against Maroboduus (Marbod). So far its importance in the European context remains the site and its accompanying evidence of the period of the Marcomannic Wars (166-180 AD) - the central military base on the hill Hradisko (Hillfort) at Mu≈°ov (now cadastral area of Pasohl√°vky). It was built by Marcus Aurelius' soldiers deep inside enemy territory, roughly 86 km to the north of the antique Vindobona (today Vienna). The base covers a flat minor hilltop, elevated 50 m above the surrounding terrain and its southern mild slopes, on the banks of the river Dyje (Thaya). From this strategic location crossings of the river (fort) and overland routes at the confluence of the rivers Svratka, Svitava and Dyje (Thaya) as well as surrounding areas along the rivers could be controlled. The area was densely populated by the Germanic tribes of Marcomanii. In Roman times it had a history as a trading center for amber (in analogy as in Carnuntum), brought from the north to traders who sold it in Italy; the main arm of the Amber Road crossed the Danube at Carnuntum and continue on the right bank of the Dyje. Marcus Aurelius resided there for a short time, shortly before his death (180 AD) - during the war against the Marcomanni. During the Barbarian Invasions (reoccupation of the territory) \\"Eburon\\" was eventually abandoned and used as a cemetery and source of building material for projects elsewhere. Eventually, its remains were covered by decaying plant material. =Civilian city= Reconstruction of the timbre house The remains of the civilian city surrounded the fortress above. Housing around the upper Roman fort measured more than 11 square kilometres, and was a lightly fortified area densely populated by the Germanic tribes of Marcomanni (or Quadi) - (those who traded and collaborated with the Romans and enjoyed luxury Roman goods). They had a partly civilised life. The area was bounded by left (northern) bank of Dyje river in the south, right (western) bank of Jihlava River in the east and in the north by rectangular plan enclosed V-shaped ditch. This area is probably older than the real Roman fort atop hill. =Balneum= A limited part of the developed area of the Roman fortress was uncovered. Between 1926 and 1928 unique evidence of antic architecture was uncovered in the north parts of the fortified area. An enclosure, consisting of a residential building with four rooms and baths could be interpreted as a luxurious residential complex, as an ad hoc residence for the highest military authorities. Smaller scale baths implies private use, but all necessary rooms appeared to have cold and hot water. =Military camps= In the surrounding was discovered more than 12 temporary Roman military camps (marching camps).Anonymus, Marching or temporary camps of Roman troops north to the Middle Danube. Culture 2000 In seasonal operations (179 AD) more than 50,000 legionaries settled there, mostly from the X. legio - Gemina Pia Fidelis. Workshop In the open area among the buildings simple round kilns and one sizable waste pit were uncovered. This installation served as a workshop district, specialized among others for repair and perhaps production of Roman military equipment and weaponry. This evidence supports the hypothesis that inside the fortified area civilian personnel operated under protection of the Roman army. Their sustenance depended on contracts with the Roman army and for that they followed them even in time of war into hostile territory References External links *Archaeological report by Czech Academy of Science Category:Archaeological sites in the Czech Republic Category:Brno- Country District Category:Forts in the Czech Republic Category:Pannonia Category:History of Moravia Category:Roman fortified camps in Czech Republic ","title":"Roman fort, Mu≈°ov"},{"id":"44592139","text":"Suillus kunmingensis is a species of bolete fungus in the family Suillaceae.

While Republicans had high hopes of winning back the Senate, Democrats lost just two seats, with Republicans picking up three and the lone Independent in the Senate also losing. History The state was to be divided into 40 legislative districts for the first time in 1973, with each district electing one State Senator and two members of the General Assembly. The 1977 elections was the second time the current legislative districting map was in effect. The districts were drawn first to achieve a population balance (districts were drawn to be within +/- 4% of each other), and then to be as geographically compact as possible. Many districts included parts of several counties. Some districts had more than one incumbent. Until 1965, the New Jersey State Senate was composed of 21 Senators, with each county electing one Senator. After the U.S. Supreme Court, in Reynolds v. Sims (more commonly known as One Man, One Vote), required redistricting by state legislatures for congressional districts to keep represented populations equal, as well as requiring both houses of state legislatures to have districts drawn that contained roughly equal populations, and to perform redistricting when needed. In 1965, the Senate was increased from 21 members to 29 members, and larger counties were given more than one seat, and some smaller counties shared one or two Senators. The map was changed again in 1967, and again in 1971, as the state adjusted to the one man, one vote ruling. Incumbents who lost re-election Five incumbent Democratic Senators were defeated in the June primary; Democrats held four of the seats, and Republicans picked up one seat: * District 6: Alene Ammond (D-Camden) lost the Democratic Primary to Victor Pachter; Pachter lost the general election to Republican Lee Laskin, a former Assemblyman. * District 7: Edward J.

This is typically done to semiconductors by controlling the composition of alloys or constructing layered materials with alternating compositions. A band gap is the range in a solid where no electron state can exist. The band gap of insulators is much larger than in semiconductors. Conductors or metals have a much smaller or nonexistent band gap than semiconductors since the valence and conduction bands overlap. Controlling the band gap allows for the creation of desirable electrical properties.  Molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE)  Molecular-beam epitaxy is a technique used to construct thin epitaxial films of materials ranging from oxides to semiconductors to metals. Different beams of atoms and molecules in an ultra- high vacuum environment are shot onto a nearly atomically clean crystal, creating a layering effect. This is a type of thin-film deposition. Semiconductors are the most commonly used material due to their use in electronics. Technologies such as quantum well devices, super-lattices, and lasers are possible with MBE. Epitaxial films are useful due to their ability to be produced with electrical properties different from those of the substrate, either higher purity, or fewer defects or with a different concentration of electrically active impurities as desired. Varying the composition of the material alters the band gap due to bonding of different atoms with differing energy level gaps.  Strain-induced band-gap engineering  Semiconducting materials are able to be altered with strain-inducing from tunable sizes and shapes due to quantum confinement effects. A larger tunable bandgap range is possible due to the high elastic limit of semiconducting nanostructures. Strain is the ratio of extension to original length, and can be used on the nanoscale.\\"Stress & Strain.\\" PhysicsNetcouk RSS. Accessed December 4, 2014. http://physicsnet.co.uk/a-level-physics- as-a2/materials/stress-strain/. = ZnO nanowires = ZnO Nanowires are used in nanogenerators, nanowire field effect transistors, piezo-electric diodes, and chemical sensors. Several studies have been conducted on the effect of strain on different physical properties. Sb-doped ZnO nanowires experience variation in resistance when exposed to strain. Bending strain can induce an increase in electrical conductance. Strain can also induce change of transport properties and band-gap variation. By correlating these two effects under experimentation the variation of transport properties as a function of band- gap can be generated. Electrical measurements are obtained using scanning tunnelling microscope-transmission electron microscope probing system.  Energy band-gap engineering of graphene nanoribbons  When lithographically generated graphene ribbons are laterally confined in charge it creates an energy gap near the charge neutrality point. The narrower the ribbons result in larger energy gap openings based on temperature dependent conductance. A narrow ribbon is considered a quasi one dimensional system in which an energy band gap opening is expected. Single sheets of graphene are mechanically extracted from bulk graphite crystals onto a silicon substrate and are contacted with Cr/Au metal electrodes. Hydrogen silsesquioxane is spun onto the samples to form an etch mask and then oxygen plasma is used to etch away the unprotected graphene.

Biography Born on a farm outside Blenheim in 1945, Mapp was educated at Nelson College from 1960 to 1963. He started working in museums while at high school and developed a strong interest in archaeology. He also worked early in his career as a designer for film and television. Mapp began carving with whale ivory, whale bone and cow bone in 1969. He became the first contemporary professional bone carver in New Zealand. His first exhibition was at Wellington's Bett-Duncan Gallery in 1972. At this time he also became involved with the New Zealand chapter of the World Craft Council (later the Craft Council of New Zealand) and the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts which helped him promote his work and through which he also organised workshops to demonstrate bone carving. In 1990, he received a QEII Arts Council (now Creative New Zealand) study grant and established a connection with Japanese netsuke carvers. He continues to exhibit in Japan and his work has been acquired by the Japanese royal family. Mapp tutors at Whitireia New Zealand in the Visual Arts and Design programme. In his survey of three- dimensional arts in New Zealand in 1980, Peter Cape wrote, 'Mapp prefers to think of the items he carves in bone and ivory as handpieces or, as he says, 'three-dimensional sculptures to be worn on the body or carried in the pocket, to be held, fondled, and not just looked art'.'

The initial purpose of the film was to serve as a military training tool and a piece of post-war propaganda viewable by the general public, but since its release, both critics and filmmakers alike have hailed it as a ‚Äúmasterpiece of filmmaking,‚Äù claiming that the realistic cinematography is both pleasing in aesthetics and technicality for its time. The film is most notable for its use of subjective viewing.  Plot  Kill or Be Killed follows the single event of British sniper, Sergeant Smith, as he crawls about an unidentified, yet generic- looking forest seeking to aim and kill a Nazi enemy ironically named Schmidt. It is actually within the first few minutes of the film that Smith acquires and executes his target, while the second act of the film (totaling in three) is a flashback that compresses the tedious manhunt leading up to the climax. The lengthy sequence shows Smith in gross camouflage blending naturally within his surrounding‚Äîeach bodily movement abiding the dynamics of obscurity as he slowly ascends to higher ground and optimal surveillance. Once there, Smith progresses the action of the film by reiterating the scoping and sniping of Schmidt, and then uses the corpse as a decoy to lure other Nazi soldiers into a clearing where he systematically picks them off. The film ends with an elicited tone of triumph.  Cinematography  Lye makes \\"inventive use\\" of camera close-ups and long, gradual sequences of movement to stimulate suspense that is shared by both the protagonist and the viewer. Much of the sound used throughout the film consists of isolated instances‚Äîlike the snapping of twigs, footsteps on the forest floor, and the climactic gunshot. The brevity of such audiovisual cues serves to propel the drama but also maintain the principles of camouflage. Another highly discussed element of Kill or Be Killed's artistry involves scenes in which Lye deploys the camera to portray a unique point of view. For example, toward the beginning of the film, a camera strapped to Smith's waist tracks the British soldier's movements as he pursues his enemy through the forest‚Äîa technique that would later be termed the \\"first-person shooter.\\" In another scene, the camera cuts from an image of Smith lifting binoculars to his face, to a subjective view of the scene as he views it through the lenses.  Reception  Kill or Be Killed managed to reach beyond Britain to audiences and critics on a global scale within its first year of release, and the published reviews yielded many praises. * Thomas Pryor, a film critic for the New York Times said it was \\"an especially exciting and brilliantly executed piece of pure cinema\\" (1943) * Documentary News Letter reviewed the work and concluded the \\"Propaganda Value: Excellent\\"  References   External links  * Category:British World War II propaganda films Category:1942 films Category:Films directed by Len Lye Category:British films Category:British black-and-white films Category:British drama films Category:1942 drama films ","title":"Kill or Be Killed (1942 film)"},{"id":"44592596","text":"The Reflections were a New York band which recorded the 45s \\"I Really Must Know\\"/\\"Maybe Tomorrow\\" (Crossroads 401, 1961) and \\"Rocket to the Moon\\"/\\"Because of You\\" (Crossroads 402, 1962).

It was described in 1988 by Gordon Guymer in his revision of the genus, previously having been considered a variant of Brachychiton paradoxus. Hybrids with Brachychiton multicaulis have been reported. Brachychiton megaphyllus grows as a large shrub or small tree, ranging from tall, with a trunk that can be wide at breast height. The dark brown bark has vertical furrows and shallow tessellations. Like those of all members of the genus, the leaves are alternately arranged along the stems. The large leaves are roughly oval or three-lobed in shape, measuring long by wide. The leaf base is cordate (heart- shaped). The plant is deciduous, bare of leaves from June to September. The orange-red flowers appear from June to October or sometimes November. The yellow-brown woody follicles, or seedpods, mature from September to June. Measuring long and wide, they split along their length to reveal 25‚Äì45 seeds. The seeds, which are ovoid with a smooth surface, and long by wide, are covered by a hairy coating known as the exotesta. The species is found in the Northern Territory, north of latitude 17 S. It is a component of open eucalypt woodland, commonly found with Eucalyptus miniata and E. tetrodonta. It generally grows on red soils derived from laterite. According to the speakers of the Ngan‚Äôgityemerri language, the flowering of B. megaphyllus marks the time the freshwater crocodiles are laying eggs. Commonly cultivated in the Northern Territory, it was listed as the official emblem of the city of Darwin in 1988.  Aboriginal uses  The Arnhem Land women of Yirrkala, Maningrida, and Gapiwiyak spin thread from the bark of Brachychiton megaphyllus, and use the thread to make necklaces, and bracelets. The rootstock of young plants can be eaten raw, while fibre from the bark is used to make both rope and string. Stems exude gum which is eaten and can also be used as a paint binder. The seeds are eaten raw or roasted.

Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) is a type of X-ray microscopy in which a zone plate focuses an X-ray beam onto a small spot, a sample is scanned in the focal plane of the zone plate and the transmitted X-ray intensity is recorded as a function of the sample position. A stroboscopic scheme is used where the excitation is the pump and the synchrotron X-ray flashes are the probe. X-ray microscopes work by exposing a film or charged coupled device detector to detect X-rays that pass through the specimen. The image formed is of a thin section of specimen. Newer X-ray microscopes use X-ray absorption spectroscopy to heterogeneous materials at high spatial resolution. The essence of the technique is a combination of spectromicroscopy, imaging with spectral sensitivity, and microspectroscopy, recording spectra from very small spots.Koprinarov, Ivaylo, and Hitchcock, Adam P.. \\"X-ray Spectromicroscopy of Polymers: An introduction for the non- specialist\\".  Benefits of STXM  = Radiation damage = Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in combination with transmission electron microscopy has modest spectral resolution and is rather damaging to the sample material. STXM with variable X-ray energy gives high spectral resolution. Radiation damage effects are typically two orders of magnitude lower than for EELS. Radiation concerns are also relevant with organic materials. = Samples with water = Unlike other methods such as electron microscopy, the spectra samples with water and carbon can be obtained. STXM run at atmospheric pressure allows for convenient sample installation and fewer restrictions on sample preparation. Cells have even been built which can examine hydrated precipitates and solutions.  Operation  In order to obtain spectromicroscopy data the following operating procedure is followed. The desired monochromator grating is selected along with photon energy in the middle of NEXAFS range. Refocus mirrors are adjusted to put the beam into the microscope and steered to maximize the flux passing through the zone plate. A pinhole is placed in the photon beam upstream in a transverse position to maximize transmission. Pinhole size is determined by demagnification to the size of the diffraction limit of the zone plate lens. An undersized pinhole is often used to reduce intensity which controls radiation damage. The order sorting aperture is positioned to eliminate transmission of unfocused zero order light, which would blur the image. Then an x/y line scan is defined across an intensity variation in the image. The x/y line scans are repeated with varying focus conditions. Adsorption spectra can also be obtained with a stationary photon spot.  Applications  = Quantitative polymer analysis = STXM has been used to study reinforce filler particles used in molded compressed polyurethane foams in the automotive and fishing industries to achieve higher load bearing capability. Two types of polymers, copolymer styrene and acrylonitrile (SAN) and aromatic-carbamate rich poly-isocyanate poly-addition (PIPA), are chemically indistinguishable by transmission electron spectroscopy. With NEXAFS, spectra of SAN and PIPA absorb strongly at 285.0 eV associated with the phenyl groups of the aromatic filler particles and thus show the same electron spectroscopy image. Only SAN has a strong absorption at 286.7 eV due to the acrylonitrile component. NEXAFS can be a quick and reliable means to differentiate chemical species at a sub-micron spatial scale. = Distribution of macromolecular subcomponents of biofilm cells and matrix = STXM which uses near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy is able to be applied to fully hydrated biological molecules due to the ability of X-rays to penetrate water. Soft X-rays also provide spatial resolution better than 50 nm which is suitable for bacterial and bacterial microfilms. With this, quantitative chemical mapping at a spatial scale below 50 nm may be achieved. Soft X-rays also interact with almost all elements and allow mapping of chemical species based on bonding structure. STXM allows for study of a variety of questions regarding the nature, distribution, and role of protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and nucleic acid in biofilms, especially in the extracellular matrix. The study of these biofilms is useful for environmental remediation applications.

To the east is a long curving artificial waterbody that bounds the Olympic Green neighborhood in that direction; on the other side the first block is either more open space or large buildings such as the China Science and Technology Museum, after which denser urban development and taller buildings begin. On the west similar medium-rises begin after two large blocks. One block to the north is the South Gate of Forest Park Station on Line 8 of the Beijing Subway. North of it is the Olympic Forest Park, a nature preserve that extends to the city's Fifth Ring Road. To the south, after another open block, are the former Olympic sport venues such as the China National Convention Center and Beijing National Stadium, known colloquially as the Birds' Nest. The south boundary of the Olympic Green, the Fourth Ring Road, is just beyond. The five separate towers rest on an extensive concrete foundation with of exposed surface. A slight landscaped rise surrounds their base, from which all five circular steel towers rise. The largest and tallest, in total height, is surrounded by the other four. The lesser towers reach different heights, with the lowest at . Large diagonal members connect the lesser towers to the main structure. All the towers widen at their flat-roofed tops to allow the use of the space inside as observation platforms. The lesser tower tops spiral up to the main one. The solid steel exterior parts into latticework to allow views from the glass behind them. Two elevators, operating independently of each other, carry visitors up the central tower. History A competition was held in the mid-2000s to select the design. The winning design was by Cui Kai and Li Cundong of the Chinese Architecture Design and Research Group (CARDEG). Zhao Wenbin, another architect at the firm, designed the landscaping at the towers' base. Their design was inspired by blades of grass. The five circular tops of the towers are also meant to echo the Olympic rings, and provide space for observation decks and a revolving restaurant. As it neared completion, Internet commentators compared it to \\"five huge nails\\", as well. Construction began in 2011, and was originally expected to finish the following year. As it was underway, Southern Metropolis Daily reported the complaints of a Shenzhen architect, Ping Caohan, that the CARDEG architects had essentially copied an earlier conceptual design of his for the tower. His design, which won the first round of the competition, consisted of five similar towers with observation pods, all in a ring at the top rather than at different levels. He did not enter his design in the second round, however, and the CARDEG architects said theirs was unrelated. The tower was completed and opened in August 2014. It is the third tallest structure in Beijing after the Central Radio & TV Tower and the IAP Meteorological Tower and the fourth-tallest building in the city. It is also the sixth-tallest observation tower in China and the 22nd-tallest in the world. From the top, which includes a planned revolving restaurant, visitors can see the entire Olympic Green area as well as the Forbidden City and other sights of central Beijing to the south.

History The institution can trace its roots back to its founder Countess Benigna Zinzendorf who established the seminary in 1742. It moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 1745. The seminary began as an elementary educational institution for young girls starting at ages five or six years old. In 1785, due to increasing demand, the Bethlehem Female Seminary reorganized as a secondary educational institution that became known as the Moravian Female Seminary. The newly reorganized female seminary also became open to all denominations. Religion The Moravian Church is one of the oldest denomination of Protestantism. During the eighteenth century, Moravian missionaries settled in the United States. The Bethlehem Female Seminary was founded under the Moravian Church and focused on the teachings of their faith as well as cultivating the mind. Moravian educators believed in equality of the sexes and were dedicated to the cause of education, especially for women. The beliefs and morals of the Moravian Church led to its reputation as a prestigious parochial school in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century America. Educational philosophy The Bethlehem Female Seminary encouraged a wide range of useful training for girls. Since its establishment in the eighteenth century, the seminary maintained the belief that \\"when you educate a woman, you educate an entire family.\\" This modern attitude toward women's education was reflected in their curriculum that was based on liberal and household teachings. Academics The early curriculum at Bethlehem Female Seminary included subjects such as reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, geography, history, astronomy, music, German, and English. The seminary also focused on teaching household duties such as sewing and needlework. When the Bethlehem Female Seminary became the Moravian Female Seminary in 1785 it restructured its curriculum into five categories. These subject areas were spiritual and moral guidance, intellectual and cultural pursuits, vocational training, social cultivation, and physical exercise. Tuition In the late eighteenth century tuition costs were ¬£20 in Pennsylvania currency per year that covered the cost for common schooling which included reading, writing, arithmetic, geometry, and sewing. Specialized subjects such as needlework, music, and drawing required an extra two guineas per subject. Clothing, medicine, books, and other classroom supplies were designated as separate charges to be paid quarterly. Room and board amounted to twenty shillings per year. Student demographics From its first opening the seminary admitted girls starting at age five or six for elementary education. After 1785, the seminary became a secondary educational institution that admitted girls between the ages of eight and fifteen. The seminary student body included girls from New England, Maryland, South Carolina, Nova Scotia, and the West Indies. By the nineteenth century its student population consisted of more than seven thousand. Affiliations The Bethlehem Female Seminary was the foundation for a variety of educational institutions based on the ideals of the Moravian Church. The seminary was also affiliated with a Moravian boy's boarding school at Nazareth Hall.

(2018). Palythoa Lamouroux, 1816. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=205785 on 2018-08-27Myers, P., R. Espinosa, C. S. Parr, T. Jones, G. S. Hammond, and T. A. Dewey. 2014. The Animal Diversity Web (online). Accessed at http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Palythoa/classification/ Description The polyps of Palythoa are partially embedded in an encrusting mat of tissue (coenenchyme) covering the substrate on which the colony grows. The individual polyps have flattened oral discs surrounded by a fringe of tentacles. The tentacles' shape and size can vary considerably between species, and even between colonies of the same species. Their colors are also highly variable, with relatively dull shades like cream, coffee, white, brown, or yellow, being the most common. Fluorescent colored colonies also exist, but these are more rare. Palytoxin Palytoxin is a highly toxic fatty alcohol produced by many species of Palythoa, and is also found in other corals and certain marine invertebrates. The substance was first isolated from the seaweed-like \\"limu- make-o-Hana\\" (\\"Seaweed of Death from Hana\\") in 1971 in Hawaii. Scientific investigation of the seaweed found it to be a colonial cnidarian, which was classified as a zoanthid and named Palythoa toxica. Small quantities of palytoxin can be fatal should it be ingested or inhaled. The presence of this toxin is of significance to aquarists who keep reef aquariums, as Palythoa and related zoanthids are commonly kept as decorative specimens in marine aquaria. Aquarists have reported symptoms consistent with palytoxin poisoning prior to having exposure to zoanthids suspected to contain the toxin. One report involved an aquarist being accidentally poisoned through skin injuries after handling zoanthidsKatrin Hoffmann, Maren Hermanns-Clausen, Claus Buhl, Markus W. B√ºchler, Peter Schemmer, Dietrich Mebs and Silke Kauferstein (2008) A case of palytoxin poisoning due to contact with zoanthid corals through a skin injury. Toxicon 51, no. 8: 1535-1537. Another report involved an aquarium hobbyist in Virginia who experienced a severe respiratory reaction after trying to eradicate colonies of brown zoanthids (suspected to be Palythoa) from rocks in their aquarium. A 2010 study found that a single specimen of Palythoa from a sample of fifteen colonies purchased from three aquarium stores in the Washington D.C. area contained high levels of palytoxin, indicating that toxic individuals are present in the captive population.Deeds JR, Handy SM, White KD, Reimer JD (2011) Palytoxin Found in Palythoa sp. Zoanthids (Anthozoa, Hexacorallia) Sold in the Home Aquarium Trade. PLoS ONE 6(4): e18235. While poisoning events have occurred, they are exceedingly rare, and many reef hobbyists have kept Palythoa without any adverse reactions. However, it is generally recommended to always wear appropriate protective gloves and goggles when reaching into aquaria and handling animals which are suspected to be toxic.Nicholas Violand Aquarium

Plot A group of friends enters Man's nightclub, Volcano, where one of them, Jason, is approached by one of the entertainers called the \\"Red Bastard\\". Jason follows the Red Bastard with the intention to buy party drugs from him or his employer. Jason is led to a back room of the club where the Man is entertaining some guests. Upon Jason's arrival, the Man cryptically announces that they have been expecting Jason, only to burst out into laughter immediately afterward. After the others have left, the Man introduces Jason to his drug, a new creation called Urge. The Man explains that Urge is something different from normal party drugs - claiming that it is like a key to unlock what is hidden, it basically tones down a person's sense of morality and strips them of their inhibitions. As the Man continues to speak, Jason cuts him short, explaining his distaste for people who are talking too much. The Man then reveals that he knows private information of Jason's life. The Man then takes his leave, telling Jason that the Red Bastard will lead him out and will be the one to sell him the Urge. The Red Bastard provides Jason with the drug and also warns him that every person may only take the drug once in their lifetime. After taking a liking to the Urge drug, Jason and his friends start taking it again, however, this time their inhibitions are not only numbed but deactivated completely. This leads to the night taking a dark turn, leading to various severe injuries and even multiple deaths. Furthermore, it is revealed that not only Jason and his friends are taking Urge, the Man has basically provided the entire island with the drug. Meanwhile, Jason heads to a diner as he cannot be affected by Urge. While he sits down in a booth, the Man joins him. Jason claims that the Man is responsible for the chaos on the island caused by the Urge addiction the Man is creating but the Man replies that he cannot be held accountable for other people taking drugs. He also reminds Jason that he tells every person who takes the drug that they are only allowed to use the drug once in their life. At that moment, Jason is distracted by a girl at the counter and when he looks back into his booth, the Man has vanished without a trace. Upon leaving the diner, Jason witnesses a man jumping in front of a driving truck. Jason rushes him to a hospital where he realizes the true extent of the drug, dozens of people are brought in because of wounds caused under Urge influence. The Urge eventually results in the entire island running amok while each person fulfils their deepest desires. Eventually, Jason and his last living friend Joey, escape the island via boat. Exhausted, both fall asleep immediately after boarding the ship. When Jason wakes up again, he finds the ship taken over by the Man and his cronies. Jason disarms one of the men and heads upstairs where he confronts the man at gunpoint. He then demands to know why the Man plans to kill every person on the island, only for the Man to reply that he did not even lift a finger. Outraged, Jason demands to know whether the Man intends to play God and to smite the weak, only for the man to reveal that he is God and that Jason will be the one to do the smiting. He claims that Jason will bring Urge to the mainland to eradicate humanity, a flawed creation, for good but Jason refuses. Furious, the Man shows Jason an apocalyptic vision of the future. Once Jason snaps out of the vision, the Man has once again disappeared without a trace. Although it is not shown what happens to Jason after Man's disappearance, a chaos similar to that created on the island breaks out on the mainland, with people mindlessly slaughtering and hurting each other, implying that Man's scheme was successful Cast *Pierce Brosnan as The Man *Ashley Greene as Theresa *Justin Chatwin as Jason Brettner *Alexis Knapp as Joey *Danny Masterson as Neal *Kea Ho as Xiomara *Bar Paly as Denise *Chris Geere as Vick *Nick Thune as Danny *Jeff Fahey as Gerald *Alison Lohman as Mother Production On September 29, 2014, Pierce Brosnan joined the cast.

Host and symptoms  Botryotinia polyblastis is known to attack ornamental plants of the genus Narcissus. Plants in this genus are commonly known as daffodils, paper whites and jonquils. Botryotinia polyblastis generally attacks its host in three stages beginning with the flower and ending with an infection of the leaves. The disease first infects the flower through water soaked areas on petals and causes those petals to brown, wither and die.https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host- disease/daffodil-narcissus-spp-fire The disease then causes the formation of elliptical-shaped, tan leaf spots appear on the tips of the hosts leaves. The leaf spots typically start off small and can eventually grow to be greater than 5mm in length. Shortly after the appearance of leaf spots the leaves begin to exhibit chlorosis. Once the plant has lost the majority of its leaves to Botryotinia polyblastis the plant can no longer photosynthesize sufficiently and dies. The foliar symptoms caused by Botryotinia polyblastis, namely chlorosis, are often mistaken for natural senescence. However, the chlorosis of a leaf infected by Botryotinia polyblastis occurs much more rapidly and should not be mistaken for early senescence. These symptoms are also sometimes confused with those caused by Stagonospora curtisii, which is responsible for Narcissus Scorch.  Disease cycle  Botryotinia polyblastis is an ascomycete and overwinters as sclerotia on infected plant tissue in the soil. Like many ascomycetes, the sclerotia of Botryotinia polyblastis germinate in the spring, once weather conditions are favorable to form an ascocarp. Botryotinia polyblastis forms an apothecium, a wide, open, saucer shaped fruiting body as its ascocarp. The apothecium contains ascospores, which are the primary inoculum. Airborne ascospores infect only the flowers of Narcissus. If the fungus cannot reproduce sexually, it will form conidia instead of ascospores. The conidia are considered to be the secondary inoculum and are responsible for foliar infections. Conidia infect leaf tissue and results in mycelium production which leads to the formation of leaf spots associated with Narcissus Fire. As a result of this, the actual fungus can be isolated from the leaf spots because the spots are made up of conidia and mycelium. Both ascospores and conidia are airborne inoculum and are most often transmitted from plant to plant via wind. Apothecial production, and therefore flower infection, generally peaks from mid-March to early April and conidial production, and therefore foliar infection, generally peaks in late April.  Control  There are two main types of control that can be practice to avoid infections by Botryotinia polyblastis; cultural or chemical. = Cultural = Cultural control can help to prevent disease and stop the spread of infections that have already started in fields. In order to prevent an epidemic, basic sanitation can be practiced by removing all dead tissue from fields before planting for the next season. Another way to prevent disease is to rotate planting daffodils for two years, especially after an infection. In order to stop a current infection it is important to remove infected flowers immediately.http://dafftube.org/wp- content/uploads/2013/10/Prevention_and_Management_of_Daffodil_Diseases.pdf = Chemical = Chemical means of controlling Botryotinia polyblastis involve the use of fungicides. There are many varieties of fungicides available to prevent Botryotinia polyblastis infections and they should be applied twice throughout the season, once in late March and once in late April. Dicarboximide, chlorothalonil, fludioxonil, cyprodinil, pyraclostrobin and mancozeb are all common fungicides used to treat Narcissus fire, however formulations containing dicarboximide have been shown to be most effective. It is also possible to remove all the flowers from the fields before apothecial production and avoid having to deal with prevention or treatment of a fungal disease such as Botryotinia polyblastis.

But most of the time, his experimentation pays off handsomely. Goldberg Variations isn't for everyone; classical purists, in fact, will want to avoid it. But those who have very eclectic tastes in music will find that this 1999/2000 project, although not perfect, is highly imaginative and even fascinating\\". On All About Jazz Glenn Astarita said \\"Basically, one of the great attributes of this ambitious project is based upon Caine's ability to inject humor and disparate elements into his writings and arrangements; although, there's much more than meets the eye here as ideas abound with ceaseless invention and soulful articulation despite the semi austere implications. Perhaps the bottom line or desired effect of this project is contingent upon the relationships established between varying art forms and how all music is rooted and intertwined. Either way you view it, Caine's The Goldberg Variations is a magnificent event for the aural senses! Highly recommended\\".Astarita, G., All About Jazz Review, November 1, 2000 The BBC's ClassicalMusic.com said \\"Caine‚Äôs arrangements are wonderfully inventive and they‚Äôre brilliantly executed, too. Caine treats Bach‚Äôs original variations fairly soberly ‚Äì most are played either on solo piano or by a Baroque chamber ensemble ‚Äì but elsewhere he lets his imagination run riot... DJs, poets, a choral group, a gamba quartet, several notable jazzers and a gamut of vocalists also feature. There‚Äôs humour aplenty, yet Caine respects musicality ‚Äì each variation is crafted with due expertise. Parody? Pastiche? It‚Äôs more a carnivalesque celebration of Bach‚Äôs enduring appeal.

If all Jewish people united in the daily study cycle, Jewish unity could be accomplished. This study aims to bring about Torah unity and Jewish unity simultaneously. The completion of each cycle is celebrated with a Siyum Harambam. Such events are held worldwide with the participation of many thousands of people.

There are many laws and punishments regarding abortion. If there are posters, publicity, public meetings, group meetings that have to do with abortion, anyone involved can be punished.  The 3 grounds  A government bill on health issues proposed to make abortions legal on three grounds. One being that a woman could have an abortion if they were psychologically and or mentally at risk. The second one being non-viable or severe fetal abnormality or disease. The third ground being that the health or the life of the woman will be at risk if the pregnancy was to continue. When the woman is to see the doctor, the doctor must get the consent of that woman and inform her of the whole situation. This is the text that was published when the bill was passed, ‚ÄúTherapeutic termination of pregnancy is intended to preserve the health of the mother and when her life or psychological and mental balance is seriously threatened by pregnancy. The detailed rules for the application of this article are laid down by regulation.‚Äù  Before August 14, 2018  source: This new law for abortion was being debated for way too long in the National Assembly. Before this, Algerians only option for abortion was to go to clinics or ‚ÄúTunisia‚Äù. These clinics did not have any safety or good hygiene environments. The clinics did not meet any of the standards therefore would be risking the woman's life. There have been many cases of death of a pregnant woman and where there have been fetuses‚Äô and newborns found in dumpsters and trash cans. This shows that there has been a huge distress of a woman seeking an abortion.  Secret abortion clinics  There have been secret abortion clinics in Algeria. Many of the clients were young girls who made a mistake and wanted it to go away. Other clients were women who were housewives and when the husband found out about the babies, the mothers were forced to give them up. One common reason why these women go to the secret abortion clinics is because they don't want to be pushed away from their families. Another reason being that they are truly not ready to care to a child. These women do a lot to get these illegal abortions done for example saving money for long periods of time and selling jewelry.  Abortion and Rape  In 1998, there was a big uproar about abortion in Algeria's laws because of women being raped by Islamic Rebels. There were obvious ground rules, but women wanted a change. Women wanted to have the right to get an abortion if they had been raped. While the decisions were being made for four long years, 1,600 young women had been abducted by roving bands of the Armed Islamic Group. The ground of rape was no included in the three grounds for the new law on abortion. A journalist made the point that the three group points and the ground point of rape used to be included when Algeria was fighting for independence but is not anymore. This is implying that the country has gone backwards since then in terms of abortion.  International Campaign for Women‚Äôs Right to Safe Abortion  This is a campaign that supports Women's rights and protects so they can live in a safe environment. On the website they talk about many problems that are going on all over the world that involve women. One of the important topics they talk about on this website and campaign is Abortion in Algeria. This campaign works with many people and protest with the women to get women the support they need with abortion. The campaign keeps people up to date and gives money to make a difference in theses women's lives.

Tokyo 2020's presentation for the next Olympics featured swimmer Kosuke Kitajima, long-distance runner Naoko Takahashi, boxer Ry≈çta Murata and Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe. The Japanese national anthem arranged by Jun Miyake was sung while the flag of Japan was projected onto the stadium grounds while another flag was raised on the flagpole in the stadium. The flag then faded out to thank those who aided the country after the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. A video presentation featuring characters from famous Japanese anime and prominent video games such as Captain Tsubasa, Doraemon, Pac-Man and Hello Kitty led up to Abe's appearance, which consisted of him transforming into Mario from Nintendo's Mario franchise and jumping out of a Warp Pipe given by Doraemon to help him get from Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing to Rio de Janeiro's Maracan√£ Stadium on time. Abe appeared at the Maracan√£ dressed up as Mario. Male rhythmic gymnasts from Aomori University and dancers from Elevenplay then performed a dance routine highlighting Japan's electronic culture (choreographed by Mikiko, dance director of Elevenplay), music by Capsule member Yasutaka Nakata (the songwriter and producer for popular Japanese idol artists Perfume and Kyary Pamyu Pamyu) before the presentation ended with the logo of the forthcoming Tokyo games. The last sequence of presentation used the music from Tokyo Metropolitan Theatre's 2012 play \\"Egg\\" (written by Hideki Noda, with music by Ringo Sheena) ‚Äì contains the message: \\"sports, music or Olympics\\" and \\"War or Nationalism\\" shall not be linked again. =Carnival Finale= The Carnival-inspired parade Speeches by organising committee chairman Carlos Arthur Nuzman and IOC president Bach declared the Games closed, as he called them 'Marvelous Olympic Games in The Marvelous City'. Mariene de Castro sang in front of the Olympic cauldron as the flame was extinguished via piped rain. The ceremony ended with a fireworks display and a tribute to Rio's signature event, the Carnival, which takes place during the four days before Ash Wednesday. The segment showcased Brazil's musical dance culture. The 250-person strong parade was led by Brazilian model Izabel Goulart, the actress Leandra Leal as \\"goodmother of Cord√£o da Bola Preta carnival block\\" and street cleaner Renato Sorriso, with the city anthem and a carnival anthem Cidade Maravilhosa playing in the background.

This application was among the first of the 16-bit digital sequencers that evolved from the MS-DOS WAV trackers of the Eighties to become the digital audio workstation software available today including Steinberg Cubase, Pro Tools and ACID Pro. Making Waves enabled a small community of independent artists (originally including Daniel Bedingfield) to use existing hardware to record, sample, mix and render their own original work creating professional-quality audio with a modest investment of less than $100. This same dynamic user community played a significant role in the application's development, suggesting program revisions and performing extensive beta testing. These users were all organized and mentored by Stephen John Steele, the original programmer and developer of Making Waves as well as a founding director of Perceptive Solutions, Spacehead Systems and Making Waves Software Limited.Taggart, Chris and McKinnon, Rob. \\"Stephen John Steele, Director, Perceptive Solutions, Making Waves Software and Spacehead Systems Limited\\", OpenCorporates, UK, 31 October 2012.

Making Waves Studio renders mp3, wav and MIDI files or can be purchased as an inexpensive audio-only wav sequencer. The early commercial success of this embryonic digital audio workstation (DAW) was relatively brief and seemed to build on two significant events, the release of a stable graphical user interface (GUI) version and the production of a \\"hit\\" record and album by an independent artist. First, with the release of the 32-bit Making Waves Studio version in April 1998, Perceptive Solutions had a product compatible with the Windows 95 GUI. The version provided a number of audio features never before or since consolidated at that price point. Next, Daniel Bedingfield's number one UK single was created with Making Waves and released in November 2001.

Shared primase-binding peptide in archaeal PolD and eukaryotic PolŒ±  Function  This gene encodes the p180 catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase Œ±-primase. Pol Œ± has limited processivity and lacks 3‚Ä≤ exonuclease activity for proofreading errors. Thus it is not well suited to efficiently and accurately copy long templates (unlike Pol Delta and Epsilon). Instead it plays a more limited role in replication. Pol Œ± is responsible for the initiation of DNA replication at origins of replication (on both the leading and lagging strands) and during synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand. The Pol Œ± complex (pol Œ±-DNA primase complex) consists of four subunits: the catalytic subunit POLA1, the regulatory subunit POLA2, and the small and the large primase subunits PRIM1 and PRIM2 respectively. Once primase has created the RNA primer, Pol Œ± starts replication elongating the primer with ~20 nucleotides.  Clinical significance  In addition to its role during DNA replication, POLA1 plays a role in type I interferon activation. The POLA1 gene was found to be the site of a mutation resulting in X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder (XLPDR, OMIM 301220). This leads to altered mRNA splicing and decreased expression of POLA1 protein to a level that does not impair DNA replication. The reduction in POLA1 expression is accompanied by marked reduction in cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrid molecules and a concomitant hyperactivation of the IRF3 pathway, with consequent overproduction of type I interferons. Moreover, POLA1 deficiency, typical for XLPDR, also impair direct cytotoxicity of NK cells. POLA1 inhibition or a natural deficiency (XLPDR) affects the way the lytic granules secreted toward target cells. As a result, NK cells in XLPDR patients display functional deficiency. Interestingly, the POLA1 deficiency typical for XLPDR is not associated with any genomic damages or cell cycle arrest. While the XLPDR mutation is resided in intron 13th, other somatic mutations in POLA1 were also described. Somatic mutation are associated with more profound deficiency of POLA1, with develops into X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). In a case of non-XLPDR mutations, beside of type I interferon signature patients also display mild to medium signs of intellectual disability, cell cycle arrest, proportionate short stature, microcephaly and hypogonadism.

Early life Angela Heywood was born in Deerfield, New Hampshire, around 1840 to Daniel and Lucy Tilton. Her father was a farmer and her mother was a radical thinker who was descended from the philosopher John Locke. Lucy taught all six of her children sex education from an early age, encouraging them not to use euphemisms or be secretive about sex. When the family fell into poverty, Heywood earned money as a housemaid for Reverend John Prince, and later as a caregiver to the child of Reverend Charles J. Bowen of Newburyport, Massachusetts. This work gave her a perspective on wage labor which would influence her later views on labor reform. When she was eighteen, Heywood had a religious experience and became active in her church, though she later criticized the church quite harshly in her writings. Although she had little formal education, Heywood was politically conscious, and she joined the abolitionist movement. Through this activism, she met her husband Ezra Heywood, a fellow abolitionist and a labor reformer. They were married in Old South Church in Boston on June 5, 1865, and moved to the town of Princeton, Massachusetts, where they bought a large house from which to run their publishing business. They had four children together, named Psyche, Angelo, Vesta, and Hermes. Career Between May 1872 and April 1893, Angela and Ezra worked together to publish The Word: A Monthly Journal of Reform. They called their business the Cooperative Publishing Company, and eventually became infamous for their blunt discussions of taboo subjects. The Word catered to many different movements, including free love, women's suffrage, socialism, and labor reform. It published a variety of works, such as essays, editorials, and book reviews. Ezra Heywood also wrote and distributed a series of pamphlets entitled Cupid's Yokes, which condemned the institution of marriage as akin to slavery for women. Heywood herself was a frequent writer for The Word, and considered herself to be a \\"word-painter,\\" referring to her own beliefs as a kind of ‚Äúethics‚Äù or ‚Äúreligion‚Äù to be followed. She wrote extensively on a variety of topics, but was most well known for her writings on sexuality. She believed that there were specific moral codes that men and women should follow. This especially applied to men, who she believed should be obligated to control their sexual desires and take responsibility for their actions. This meant, among other things, that they should acknowledge their illegitimate children rather than leaving the children and their mothers to be stigmatized by society. According to Heywood, women needed to realize that they too were allowed to derive pleasure from sex. In some ways, however, Heywood did subscribe to the gender stereotypes of the time. For example, even though she believed that women could feel sexual ‚Äúpassion,‚Äù she did not think it was in their nature to consider the possibility of sex without love, whereas men were likely to do this. In addition to her writings about sex, Heywood championed women's suffrage and wrote passionate arguments against rape. She was a labor reformer, and believed wealthy women to be ‚Äúmorally corrupt‚Äù because they did not work. She ardently defended prostitutes, blaming their poverty and desperation on the men who exploited them, while most people of the time simply blamed the women themselves for the institution of prostitution. Heywood was also an anarchist and a spiritualist, meaning that she rejected the authority of the government and the church. She believed the church to be too constricting in its treatment of female sexuality, and said that the ‚Äúchurch-state grip‚Äù on sexual knowledge caused ‚Äúwomen and labor‚Äù to be put into a place of ‚Äúsubjected destitution.‚Äù It is unclear why or when the church fell out of favor in her mind, but it likely happened sometime between 1865, when she got married in a church, and 1872, when she began writing for The Word, criticizing the church. Her husband's view that the church played too large a role in marriage may have influenced Heywood's change of heart in this matter. Heywood's anarchist beliefs were largely influenced by the fact that women did not have the right to vote. She supported women's suffrage, but believed that reform alone would not be enough to change the ideology of the government; women, she said, should not have to acknowledge the state's legitimacy since the state did not acknowledge theirs. She even felt that the United States was ‚Äúnot a republican government,‚Äù since a republic is meant to be for the people and the government only catered to the needs of half the population. Heywood was heavily influenced by the practices of the Oneida Community of New York, especially its leader, John Humphrey Noyes. This community had a strong belief in free love and operated on a system of ‚Äúcomplex marriage,‚Äù in which every community member was essentially considered to be married to all the others in the community and could have sexual relationships with anyone they chose. This corresponded with Heywood's dislike of secrecy surrounding sexuality, and likely influenced her writings for The Word. Unfortunately, the Heywoods' lack of money meant that Angela had to spend much of her time doing housework and had little time left over to write. She could not attend many conferences because she had to take care of the children. At one point, Ezra published a plea for funds in an issue of The Word, writing, ‚ÄúA.T.H. needs money to liberate herself from too much housework, so she can give more time to writing‚Ä¶Will not financially able men and sympathetic women help her ‚Äòarticulate‚Äô by pouring in cash?‚Äù The Word actually stopped being published between 1890 and 1892 when Ezra was in prison and Angela did not have time to run it herself. Over the years, Angela wrote prolifically for The Word, and was often angry at Ezra for editing her essays and cutting out what she felt were important parts (though he never censored her strong language). Despite Angela‚Äôs massive contributions to The Word, however, only Ezra was ever credited as editor, except for six months in 1878 when he was in jail and Benjamin Tucker took over as his substitute. However, Angela was always considered to be the unofficial co-editor. Criticism Ezra‚Äôs pamphlets were frequently condemned by Anthony Comstock, the man behind the 1873 Comstock Act, which prohibited the circulation of ‚Äúobscenity‚Äù in the US mail. Ezra was imprisoned twice, once from June to December 1878 and again from June 1890 to June 1892. While her husband was in jail, Heywood generated most of the family's income by running the Mountain Home summer resort out of their home. She also earned some money teaching and speaking at conferences. The Cooperative Publishing Company, despite being widely known, did not actually earn them much money, so the Heywoods were still quite poor. Heywood despised the secrecy surrounding sex and was frequently criticized for her use of explicit or obscene language in The Word. She also advocated proper sex education for children, specifically to be taught by their mothers. Although many people denounced her use of vulgar language, she felt strongly that she was being held to a double standard. Heywood reasoned that ‚ÄúIf man says ‚Äòwomb‚Äô without rising heat or dishonest purpose, why should not woman say ‚Äòpenis‚Äô without blushing squirm or sheepish looks?‚Äù She wanted to create ‚ÄúSex-Unity,‚Äù which she said was a balance between men and women in terms of free speech. She and Ezra were both ardent defenders of birth control for women; in fact, the second time Ezra got arrested, it was because he was distributing pamphlets that Angela had written about birth control. She was also one of the only outspoken defenders of abortion during this time, stating her support for women's right to control their own bodies in 1893. The very mention of abortion through the mail was at this time prohibited by the Comstock Law and the procedure itself was also illegal, making Heywood stand out as radical even among her fellow reformers. Heywood spoke at the New England Free Love League Convention in Boston in November 1877 and was criticized by Anthony Comstock for her ‚Äúobscenity.‚Äù Many people believed she was insane, while others (including some women, like Bostonian Laura C. Eldridge) believed she should go to prison for using such language.Oswald Dawson, Personal Rights and Sexual Wrongs (1897), pp. 36-37. Heywood's own brother-in-law (Ezra's brother, Samuel Heywood), disliked the work that Ezra and Angela were doing so immensely that he foreclosed on their house in September 1878 while Ezra was in prison. Angela and her children were briefly homeless, until friends loaned the Heywoods enough money for them to get their house back. Later life The Word stopped being published after Ezra's death in May 1893, and little is known about the rest of Angela's life, though a neighbor recalled that she was ‚Äúdoing day work in office buildings.‚Äù According to her daughter Psyche, Angela Heywood died at the age of 95.

He spent most of his career with Carlisle United, for whom he made nearly 300 League appearances in two spells, between which he played for Southampton and Plymouth Argyle. He subsequently had 11¬Ω years as manager of Scottish club Gretna. Playing career McCartney was born in Musselburgh and grew up as a supporter of Edinburgh club Heart of Midlothian. Having played international football for the Scottish Schoolboys, he turned down the opportunity to join Hearts as a trainee and instead moved to England, joining West Bromwich Albion, for whom he signed on as an apprentice in July 1970. Although he signed a professional contract in December 1971, he failed to break into the first team. In May 1973, he joined his former manager at Albion, Alan Ashman, signing for Second Division Carlisle United. At the end of McCartney's first season at Brunton Park, Carlisle finished in third place in the Second Division and were promoted to the First Division for the first time in the club's history. The Cumbrian club only managed one season in the top division, in which they finished in last place following which Carlisle fell down through the divisions and by 1977 they were in the Third Division. In July 1980, McCartney (now considered \\"one of the best left-backs in the lower divisions\\") was given the chance to return to the First Division by Southampton's manager Lawrie McMenemy who signed him for ¬£50,000. He was one of two players who made his debut for the Saints in a 2‚Äì0 victory against Manchester City on 16 August 1980, the other being England international Kevin Keegan, whose arrival at The Dell overshadowed that of McCartney. McCartney failed to settle back in the First Division and, after a run of 15 consecutive matches, including a 7‚Äì1 defeat at Watford in the League Cup, he lost his place at left-back to Nick Holmes. After a total of 24 appearances, with one goal, McCartney returned to the Third Division with Plymouth Argyle in August 1981, for the same fee that Southampton had paid to Carlisle a year earlier. McCartney made his debut at Home Park on 15 August 1981 in a Football League Group Cup match against Bournemouth which ended goalless. Described as a \\"tough-tackling full-back\\", McCartney made a total of 62 appearances, scoring six goals, for Argyle before returning to Carlisle just before the end of the 1982‚Äì83 season in an exchange deal with Gordon Staniforth. He remained at Carlisle for five years during which time they were relegated twice and in 1987‚Äì88 they finished second from bottom of the Fourth Division. In February 1986, McCartney suffered an ankle injury in a match at Sunderland which brought his Football League career to an end, aged 33. Management career In the summer of 1988, McCartney returned across the border to Scotland joining Gretna of the Northern League Division One, initially as a player- manager, becoming full-time manager the following year. In his first season as manager, Gretna finished as runners-up in the Northern League, followed by the championship in the next two years. In 1991‚Äì92, Gretna became the first Scottish club to reach the First Round proper of the FA Cup for 105 years, where they were eliminated by Rochdale after a replay. They reached the first round again in 1993‚Äì94, going out 2‚Äì3 to Bolton Wanderers of the First Division. Following their success in the Northern League, Gretna applied to join the Scottish League and McCartney himself worked on the required ground improvements. Following the failure of the application, and against McCartney's wishes, Gretna joined the Northern Premier League for the 1992‚Äì93 season, where they finished in a respectable sixth place. McCartney was concerned that the additional costs of travelling to clubs across northern England and North Wales would cause the club financial difficulties. Gradually the club's performances deteriorated with finishes in the lower half of the league and the club were forced to the edge of insolvency, leading to McCartney being dismissed in January 2000. Later life Gretna was later acquired by Brooks Mileson who invested heavily in the club. In 2006, they reached the Scottish Cup Final, where they were defeated on penalties by McCartney's boyhood heroes, Hearts. Although Gretna defender Derek Townsley supplied him with a complimentary ticket to the Cup Final, McCartney supported Gretna's opponents. McCartney watched Hearts regularly, travelling from his home in Carlisle, where he worked in the building trade and as a van driver.

Nalivkin went into hiding after the territory fell to communists during the Russian Revolution, and committed suicide in 1918.  Background  Vladimir Petrovich Nalivkin was born on 25 February 1852, in Kaluga, Russian Empire, to a noble family. He graduated from the Pavel Military School in Saint Petersburg, opting to serve in the Orenburg Cossack Regiment.  Central Asia  In 1873, Nalivkin served in the Russian Imperial Army during the annexation of Turkestan, participating in the conquest of the Khanate of Khiva, and eventually became commander of the Turkestan Military District. In protest against the harsh treatment of the civilian population by General Mikhail Skobelev, Nalivkin resigned from the military and entered civil government, where he was placed as the assistant head of the Fergana Valley region. He worked as an ethnologist and explorer in Fergana, and authored the first Russian-Uzbek dictionary. –£–¥–æ—Å—Ç–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π –∑–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–π –º–µ–¥–∞–ª–∏ –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ì–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ Additionally, during this time Nalivkin coauthored an ethnography entitled Muslim Women of the Fergana Valley: A 19th Century Ethnography from Central Asia with his wife, Maria Nalivkina. Between 1878 - 1884, Maria Nalivkina learned the local language and gained an intimate insight into the lives of ordinary Sart women. Nalivkina‚Äôs contribution to the ethnography was the first to explore the lives of women in the area. Nalivkin was later appointed as the head of the Turkestan Committee of the Provisional Government set up shortly after the annexation of the territory into the Russian Empire was complete, and represented the capital Tashkent in the Imperial State Duma.  Russian Revolution  In March 1917, the Russian Revolution began, starting with the February Revolution which led to the collapse of the Russian Imperial Government and formation of the Provisional Government. Despite being a member of the Imperial Duma, Nalivkin was initially sympathetic to the revolution and the Provisional Government, believing it would bring improvements to quality of life among the people of the empire. However, when the revolution reached Tashkent ideological differences soon brought Nalivkin into conflict with the revolutionaries.  Death  On 1 November 1917, a coalition of the Left Social Revolutionaries and Bolsheviks seized power in Tashkent, overthrowing the Nalivkin-led committee from local government control, and transferring it to a communist- led committee which appointed new chiefs. Nalivkin was sent into hiding, and on January 20, 1918, committed suicide.Shishkin, Philip (June 24, 2014). Restless Valley. Yale University Press. Archived at Google Books. Retrieved May 23, 2015.

History Entrance to the bakery on Butler St The bakery of established in 1936 when Pasquale Gervasio opened a bakery on Hamilton Avenue in Trenton, New Jersey. The bakery was known for its bread spread and expanded over the years into wholesale distribution for local delis and supermarkets. Pasquale died in 1955. His family continued to operate the bakery until it was eventually purchased by Joseph Guagliardo, an in-law who formerly worked for General Motors. Ownership was later passed to his son, Carmen and grandson, Matthew. In 1956, the bakery was incorporated and moved into automated production. By 1990, the bakery had acquired Frey's Baking Company and New Colonial Bakery as production included sourdough rye. On August 29, 1969, a major fire broke out in the bakery. The building was completely engulfed in flames also effecting the residents who lived upstairs, which included then owner Joseph Guagliardo, his wife, Phyllis, and son Carmen. According to Carmen, only the terrazzo floor survived the fire. Current status The bakery's primary location is on 63 Butler St in Trenton. It supplies multiple restaurants and markets including Hoagie Haven. They serve for Thanksgiving and can be overloaded. The bakery is considered a cultural establishment for Italians in Trenton. The bakery remained opened during the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on delivery. At the end of March 2020, son of Carmen and part owner, Matthew Guagliardo said \\"the types of orders drastically change over the last couple of weeks\\".

When his son Yan Hui died in 481 BC, Yan Wuyou asked Confucius to sell his carriage to buy an exterior coffin for Yan Hui. Although Yan Hui was Confucius' favourite disciple who he mourned greatly, Confucius insisted on adhering to ritual proprieties. He said as a member of the shi class, Yan Hui was to be buried with a single layer of coffin, and that was how he buried his own son, Kong Li. Confucius added that as a member of the dafu (minister) class, it was ritually improper for him to walk on foot for official business. Honours In Confucian temples, Yan Wuyou's spirit tablet is placed in the hall of Confucius' ancestors, opposite that of Zeng Dian.

In Botswana, abortions that meet these requirements must be performed within the first 16 weeks of pregnancy in a government hospital and must be approved by two physicians.  Impact of restrictive abortion laws  Though women in Botswana are recognized as having some of the best access to abortions in Sub-Saharan Africa because of these exceptions, many women are still resorting to unsafe abortions and self- induced abortions, commonly leading to maternal death.  Socio-cultural impacts on abortion  In Botswana, many families still follow the lobolo custom where men pay a woman's family in order to take her as a bride. This has established an expectation that husbands have paid for and own their wives' bodies, including their reproductive rights. Even though this sentiment may lead to pregnancy that is a result of rape, hospitals and clinics are unlikely to approve marital rape cases as justifying abortion, as cultural norms suggest husbands are entitled to their wives' bodies.

Optical cavities are a major component of all lasers, they are responsible for providing amplification of a light source via positive feedback, a process known as amplified spontaneous emission or ASE. Nanophotonic resonators offer inherently higher light energy confinement than ordinary cavities, which means stronger light-material interactions, and therefore lower lasing threshold provided the quality factor of the resonator is high. Nanophotonic resonators can be made with photonic crystals, silicon, diamond, or metals such as gold. For a laser in a nanocavity, spontaneous emission (SE) from the gain medium is enhanced by the Purcell effect,Purcell, E. Spontaneous emission probabilities at radio frequencies. Phys. Rev. 69, 681 (1946). equal to the quality factor or Q-factor of the cavity divided by the effective mode field volume, F = Q/Vmode. Therefore, reducing the volume of an optical cavity can dramatically increase this factor, which can have the effect of decreasing the input power threshold for lasing. This also means that the response time of spontaneous emission from a gain medium in a nanocavity also decreases, the result being that the laser may reach lasing steady state picoseconds after it starts being pumped. A laser formed in a nanocavity therefore may be modulated via its pump source at very high speeds. Spontaneous emission rate increases of over 70 times modern semiconductor laser devices have been demonstrated, with theoretical laser modulation speeds exceeding 100 GHz, an order of magnitude higher than modern semiconductor lasers, and higher than most digital oscilloscopes. Nanophotonic resonators have also been applied to create nanoscale filters and photonic chips Differences from classical cavities For cavities much larger than the wavelength of the light they contain, cavities with very high Q factors have already been realized (~125,000,000). However, high Q cavities on the order of the same size as the optical wavelength have been difficult to produce due to the inverse relationship between radiation losses and cavity size. When dealing with a cavity much larger than the optical wavelength, it is simple to design interfaces such that light ray paths fulfill total internal reflection conditions or Bragg reflection conditions. For light confined within much smaller cavities near the size of the optical wavelength, deviations from ray optics approximations become severe and it becomes infeasible, if not impossible to design a cavity which fulfills optimum reflection conditions for all three spatial components of the propagating light wave vectors. In a laser, the gain medium emits light randomly in all directions. With a classical cavity, the number of photons which are coupled into a single cavity mode relative to the total number of spontaneously emitted photons is relatively low because of the geometric inefficiency of the cavity, described by the Purcell factor Q/Vmode.Coldren, L. A. & Corzine, S. W. Diode Lasers and Photonic Integrated Circuits (Wiley, New York, 1995). The rate at which lasing in such a cavity can be modulated depends on the relaxation frequency of the resonator described by equation 1. R2 = (avgP0)/œÑp \\\\+ Œ≤/(œÑpœÑr0/F) + (Œ≤N0)/((œÑr0/F)P0)(1/œÑtotal \\\\- 1/(œÑr0/F)) (1) Where œÑr0 is the intrinsic carrier radiative lifetime of the bulk material, a is the differential gain, vg is the group velocity, œÑp = Q/œâL is the photon lifetime, œâL is the lasing frequency, Œ≤ is the spontaneous emission coupling factor which is enhanced by the Purcell effect, and 1 /œÑtotal = F/œÑr0 +1/œÑnr where œÑnr is the non-radiative lifetime. In the case of minimal Purcell effect in a classical cavity with small F = Q/Vmode, only the first term of equation 1 is considered, and the only way to increase modulation frequency is to increase photon density P0 by increasing the pumping power. However, thermal effects practically limit the modulation frequency to around 20 GHz, making this approach is inefficient.Lear, K. L. et al. Small and large signal modulation of 850 nm oxide-confined vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers. Advances in Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers in Trends in Optics and Photonics Series 15, 69‚Äì74 (1997). In nanoscale photonic resonators with high Q, the effective mode volume Vmode is inherently very small resulting in high F and Œ≤, and terms 2 and 3 in equation 1 are no longer negligible. Consequently nanocavities are fundamentally better suited to efficiently produce spontaneous emission and amplified spontaneous emission light modulated at frequencies much higher than 20 GHz without negative thermal effects. Materials and designs A nanocavity can be created by introducing a defect in a photonic crystal lattice structure Nanocavities made from photonic crystals are typically implemented in a photonic crystal slab structure. Such a slab will generally have a periodic lattice structure of physical holes in the material. For light propagating within the slab, a reflective interface is formed at these holes due to the periodic differences in refractive index in the structure. A common photonic crystal nanocavity design shown is essentially a photonic crystal with an intentional defect (holes missing). This structure having periodic changes in refractive index on the order of the length of the optical wavelength satisfies Bragg reflection conditions in the y and z directions for a particular wavelength range, and the slab boundaries in the x direction create another reflective boundary due to oblique reflection at dielectric boundaries. This results in theoretically perfect wave confinement in the y and z directions along the axis of a lattice row, and good confinement along the x direction. Since this confinement effect along the y and z directions (directions of the crystal lattice) is only for a range of frequencies, it has been referred to as a photonic bandgap, since there is a discrete set of photon energies which cannot propagate in the lattice directions in the material. However, because of the diffraction of waves propagating inside this structure, radiation energy does escape the cavity within the photonic crystal slab plane. The lattice spacing can be tuned to produce optimal boundary conditions of the standing wave inside the cavity to produce minimal loss and highest Q. Beside those conventional resonators, they are some examples of rewritable and/or movable cavities, which are accomplished by a micro infiltration system and by a manipulation of single nanoparticles inside photonic crystals. Metals can also be an effective way to confine light in structures equal to or smaller than the optical wavelength. This effect is emergent from the confined surface plasmon resonance induced by the resonating light, which, when confined to the surface of a nanostructure such as a gold channel or nanorod, induces electromagnetic resonance.Falkovsky, L. A. (2008, October). Optical properties of graphene. In Journal of Physics: Conference Series (Vol. 129, No. 1, p. 012004). IOP Publishing. Surface plasmon effects are strong in the visible range because the permittivity of a metal is very large and negative at visible frequencies. At frequencies higher than the visible range, the permittivity of a metal is closer to zero, and the metal stops being useful for focussing electric and magnetic fields. This effect was originally observed in radio and microwave engineering, where metal antennas and waveguides may be hundreds of times smaller than the free-space wavelength. In the same way, visible light can be constricted to the nano level with metal structures which form channels, tips, gaps, etc. Gold is also a convenient choice for nanofabrication because of its unreactivity and ease of use with chemical vapour deposition.Gagliardi, R. M., & Karp, S. (1976). Optical communications. New York, Wiley-Interscience, 1976. 445 p., 1. A thin film on top of a reflective substrate traps light inside A planar nanocavity consists of an absorptive semiconductive film no more than a few nanometers thick over a metal film also a few nanometers thick. Incident light is absorbed and reflected off of both layers, the absorbed light then resonates between the two interfaces, transmitting some light back at after each cycle. Germanium is commonly used for the absorptive layer, while gold, aluminum, and aluminum oxide are used as alternatives as well. Planar nanocavities are commonly used for thin film interference, which occurs when incident light waves reflected by the upper and lower boundaries of a thin film interfere with one another forming a new wave. An example of this is the colorful patterns produced by thin layers of oil on a surface. The difference in colors is due to minute differences in the distance reflected light travels whether it reflects from the top or bottom boundary of the oil layer. This difference is called the optical path difference, the difference in distance between the top and bottom reflection paths, which can be calculated with equation 2: OPD = 2nd cos(Œ∏) (2) OPD = mŒª (3) Where n is the refractive index of the absorptive material, d is the thickness of the absorptive film, and theta is the angle of reflection. As expressed in the equation 3, the optical path length difference (OPD) can be related to wavelengths which constructively interfere in the thin film. As a result, light which enters the film at different angles interferes with itself varying amounts, produces an intensity gradient for narrowband light, and a spectrum gradient for white light. Examples/applications Nanophotonic circuit designs are similar in appearance to microwave and radio circuits, minimized by a factor of 100,000 or more. Researchers have made nano-optical antennas which emulate the design and functionality of radio antennas. There are a number of important differences between nanophotonics and scaled down microwave circuits. At optical frequency, metals behave much less like ideal conductors, and also exhibit plasmon-related effects like kinetic inductance and surface plasmon resonance.Kotter, D. K., Novack, S. D., Slafer, W. D., & Pinhero, P. (2008, January). Solar nantenna electromagnetic collectors. In ASME 2008 2nd International Conference on Energy Sustainability collocated with the Heat Transfer, Fluids Engineering, and 3rd Energy Nanotechnology Conferences (pp. 409-415). American Society of Mechanical Engineers. A nantenna is a nanoscopic rectifying antenna, a technology being developed to convert light into electric power. The concept is based on the rectenna which is used in wireless power transmission. A rectenna functions like a specialized radio antenna which is used to convert radio waves into direct current electricity. Light is composed of electromagnetic waves like radio waves, but of a much smaller wavelength. A nantenna, an application of a nanophotonic resonator, is a nanoscale rectenna on the order of the optical wavelength size, which acts as an \\"antenna\\" for light, converting light into electricity. Arrays of nantennas could be an efficient means of converting sunlight into electric power, producing solar energy more efficiently than semiconductor bandgap solar cells. It has been suggested that nanophotonic resonators be used on multi core chips to both decrease size and boost efficiency. This is done by creating arrays of nanophotonic optical ring resonators that can transmit specific wavelengths of light between each other. Another use of nanophotonic resonators in computers is in optical RAM (O-RAM). O-Ram uses photonic crystal slab structure with properties such as strong confinement of photons and carriers to replace the functions of electrical circuits. The use of optical signals versus electrical signals is a 66.7% decrease in power consumption. Researchers have developed planar nanocavities that can reach 90% peak absorption using interference effects. This result is useful in that there are numerous applications that can benefit from these findings, specifically in energy conversion References Category:Optical components Category:Laser science Category:Photonics Category:Resonators ","title":"Nanophotonic resonator"},{"id":"44594164","text":"Miko≈Çaj G√≥recki (born 1971) is a Polish composer.

It was built in 1738. It was used as a seat of Gaekwad during Maratha rule in Ahmedabad. It was later converted into baracks and arsenal under British rule. Later it was used as railway depot and police crime branch headquarters. It was restored in 2014. History  The Gaekwad Haveli was built along the Sabarmati river in 1738 when the city was under joint rule of Mughal subedar Momin Khan and Peshwas. In 1753, the combined armies of Damaji Gaekwad and Peshwa Raghunath Rao defeated Mughals and started jointly ruling the city. It was recaptured by Momin Khan in 1756 but after the blockade of a year from January 1757 to February 1758, he surrendered the city. The revenue of the city was equally divided between Peshwa and Gaekwad but the control of the eleven gates of the city was under Peshwa. The only gate under control of Gaekwad was Jamalpur gate. The haveli near this gate was fell under control of Damaji Gaekwad. He improved the haveli and made it the citadel. An irregularly built wall with heavy gates, enclosed a large area divided into three parts, that to the north was originally a garden watered by a Persian wheel; the centre and inner part, resting on the city wall, was the citadel; the south part was added, in 1814, by Kesoba Pandit. Aba Shelukar was appointed as the sarsuba of Peshwa controlled areas of the city for revenue management by Bajirao II. He committed atrocities on the civilians to extract money and became infamous. He tried to control city by himself and captured Gaekwad Haveli. Gaekwad sent the army to city which captured Bhadra Fort and he was detained in 1799 by Peshwas and was sent back to Pune and he was jailed for seven years. An axiom in Gujarati language, Haath Ma Dando, Bagal Ma Moi, Haveli Leta Gujarat Khoi is based on this incident. A garba about Selukars atrocities in city and his deeds is preserved in the Gujarati manuscript with the institute 'Farbus Gujarati Sabha'. The garba is as following: Later Peshwas agreed to lease the city to Gaekwads. The British East India Company took the control of the city in 1817 and the haveli was used as barracks for the garrison until 1824. Later it was turned into an arsenal for the Northern Division of the Army in 1833. After the opening of the railway between Ahmedabad and Bombay it was reduced to an ordnance depot in 1863. The haveli was later turned into the police crime branch headquarters of Ahmedabad in 1969. Restoration  In October 2014, the restoration work of Gaekwad Haveli was undertaken by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation at the cost of Rs 22 Lakh as a grant from Gujarat Police Housing Corporation. The facade of the main gate made of light brown Dhrangadhra stone and painted with geru (red paint) was restored along with the watch tower behind it. The watch tower was converted into a police museum. In museum, a separate memorial dedicated to Vasant‚ÄìRajab, the duo who lost lives during communal riots while working to stop them, is also created. The 1.7 km wall of the haveli with six gates was also restored. The old police club known as the Ahmedabad City Police Officers' Sports and Recreation Centre closed since 1980s was restored also. It was inaugurated on 23 May 1952 by the then chief minister of Bombay state, Morarji Desai. A museum dedicated to Vasant-Rajab, the duo who died during the 1946 communal riots while trying to stop mob, was opened in a bastion of the haveli in June 2015.

According to the research of the Laboratory of Health and Environment of Kyoto, Kyoyasai have more minerals, fibers and vitamins than many other vegetables. According to research, Kyoyasai have more nutrients that repair DNA than other vegetables.Ono, H. (2004). Ky≈çyasai no seisan to ry≈´tu (The production and marketing of Ky≈çyasai). CiNii, [June 22, 2014]. Kyoyasai are relatively expensive. Japanese consumers consider many Kyoyasai strange, because of their appearance.Aotani, M. (2010). Kyoyasai no tiiki brand ka to marketing senryaku (Making Kyoyasai be local brand- name goods and strategy of marketing). [December 1, 2014].  Use  Kyo-yasai are eaten mostly in the home or in upscale restaurants. They play an important role in Kyo-ryori, the traditional cuisine of Kyoto. Kyo-ryori does not employ seasoning. Traditionally, Kyo-yasai are prepared without seasoning because of their rich flavor. Kyo-yasai are also used for Italian, French and other cuisines in Kyoto.  History  Agriculture began in Kyoto some twelve thousand years ago. It was the ancient capital of Japan and the home to the aristocracy. They supported a market for high-grade food. Kyoto is surrounded by mountains, making it difficult to transport seafood to the area. Instead, people cultivated the most delicious vegetables possible. The climate and soil quality contributed to making delicious vegetables.Hashimoto, S. (2003). Ky≈çyasai no rekishi to Jy≈çtobasan no tokuty≈ç . (The Ky≈çyasai‚Äôs history and the character of Ky≈çyasai in Jy≈çtoba). [July 20, 2014] In the Kamakura period, Zen Buddhism became popular. At that time Kyoto hosted many temples. Many practiced sy≈çjin ry≈çri, a Buddhist vegetarian diet. This improved the quality of vegetables and preparation methods.Tauchi architect office. (n.d.). Nihon, inishie-dentousangyou. (Japan, traditional industry). [July 20, 2014]. In 1960 the name Ky≈ç-yasai was adopted. In the 1970s the vegetables lost popularity as imported vegetables replaced them. Such vegetables were easier to cook than Ky≈ç-yasai, leaving Ky≈ç-yasai on the verge of extinction. Kyoto-area growers improved their products so that people could easily cook them. They made them smaller without losing flavor and spread new methods of cooking. Administrative organizations cooperated with agricultural and distribution organizations, attempting to increase sales of Ky≈ç-yasai. In 1989, they started to certify Ky≈ç-yasai as name-brand products. They also promoted Ky≈ç- yasai to other cities.  Definition  The most general definition covers all vegetables grown in Kyoto prefecture.JA Kyoto list. (2007). JA Kyoto, [June 10, 2014]. More limited definitions include: Dentou no Ky≈ç-yasai (Traditional Kyo-yasai) that originated before the Meiji period and were grown throughout Kyoto. Bracken, springs[?], extinct species and bamboo are also included according to the agricultural cooperative JA Kyoto. In this sense they are a type of heirloom vegetable This provision was made in 1988. Nineteen species are included.  Marketing  A-Coop Kyoto and JA Kyoto made efforts to build a commercial market around Kyo-yasai, including 39 species. A survey found that Kyotans recognize Kyo-yasai as ‚Äútraditional and historical food,‚Äù and most consumer emphasize its brand more than its flavor and nutrition.

Japanese players and teams rose to prominence in the 1990s, and today are among the strongest competitors in the sport globally.  History  The frisbee was introduced to Japan in 1969. Japan Flying Disk Athletic (JFA) was established in 1975 in Nagoya, and started meeting in 1976.

In 1992, the 6th world Ultimate championship tournament was held in Utsunomiya and the final match was broadcast by NHK-BS in real time. In 1995, GAISF accepted WFDF as an official member. In addition, Ultimate was adopted by a sports class that the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and other groups held. NHK broadcast Ultimate in the program, \\"television-sports class\\". As a result, many people recognized Ultimate. More than 150 educational facilities adopted Ultimate as physical education. In 1996, at the Japan Flying Disk Athletic meet, players were able to get the cup of the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. JFDA dispatched players to the world meet and also held meets in cooperation with the US and Taiwan.

The drink is made by beating egg yolks with sugar and coffee, then extracting the coffee into the half of the cup, followed by a similar amount of \\"egg cream\\"‚Å† ‚Å†‚Äî egg yolks which are heated and beaten, or whisked. The legend goes that fresh milk was in short supply during the war so whisked egg yolk was used as a replacement. The drink is served in cafes throughout Vietnam, though it originates in Hanoi. The Giang Caf√© () in Hanoi is known for serving the drink, which it makes with chicken egg yolk, coffee powder, condensed milk, and, optionally, cheese. The cup is sometimes served inside a bowl of hot water or set upon a small candle to retain its temperature. The son of the caf√©'s founder Nguyen Giang claims that his father developed the recipe for the drink when milk was scarce in Vietnam in the late 1940s, replacing the dairy product with egg yolk.  Ingredients and preparation  Ingredients for making coffee include fresh chicken eggs, sugar, milk, and coffee. The egg yolks are hand-whipped with milk and sugar, and then boiled. Hot or iced coffee is poured into the beaten eggs, which will form a beautiful and aromatic foam. A teaspoon is provided in order to eat the foam before drinking the coffee at the bottom. Egg coffee is contained in a small cup. To keep the drink warm, the waiter puts a cup of coffee in a bowl of warm water. After being poured over the cream made from eggs, the coffee at the bottom of the cup acquires a richer taste. In the past, eggs were just hand-beaten, so it took time and the foam of the eggs could not be achieved. Now, after the eggs have been smoothed with the machine, hot or iced coffee is added, together with cocoa eggs, egg white beans and matcha (tea powder) eggs. It can be served either hot or iced.

The deli is considered a historic landmark and has served multiple celebrities. History The White House Sub Shop was founded in 1946 on Arctic Ave in Atlantic City by Anthony \\"Tony\\" Basile along with his Aunt Basilia and Uncle Alfred \\"Fritz\\" Sacco. Prior to that date, the front of the building on Arctic Ave. was Mr. Basile's tailor shop. While business was scarce during WWII, his wife would sell sandwiches (on breads that she purchased from Formica's bakery across the street) that she made in her kitchen out of the back side door. After the war, he decided to close his tailor shop and open the front of the building as a cold \\"submarine\\" sandwich shop. The fountain and grill hood found today in the front were from the original store. The family still lived in the back of the store at that time. Later, the back was remodeled as it appears today to add grills, boards and more room for storage. In the very back were two old-fashioned pin ball machines for many years. It has remained in its original location with an additional expansion in the Trump Taj Mahal. The expansion location temporarily closed down when the Trump Taj Mahal closed down in the fall of 2016, but was later reopened when the casino reopened as the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Atlantic City in the summer of 2018. They have been popular among locals and tourists alike, attracting numerous celebrities, including Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Oprah Winfrey, Rocky Marciano, Joe DiMaggio, Donald Trump, several Miss Americas, and others. After The Beatles played a concert in Atlantic City in 1964, they stopped by at the White House Sub Shop for a 72-inch hoagie. The White House Sub Shop is known for its cold and hot submarine sandwiches that measure roughly two feet in length. Notable sandwiches include the Italian sub, their own creation, the White House Special, and cheesesteaks. Ratings In 2000, the White House Sub Shop was named an American classic and was considered number 3 in the top 20 Jersey Food Experiences You Must Try Before You Die.

Early life and education Sheehan has been carving since his early teens. His father is an American jade carver who emigrated to Nelson in the 1970s. Sheehan worked in his father's business, which supplied jade carvings to the tourism market in Rotorua. Sheehan studied contemporary jewellery at the Unitec Institute of Technology, where his tutors included Pauline Bern, graduating with a Diploma in Design (Jewellery) in 1996. Career Sheehan works with pounamu, which is a material of great significance in MƒÅori culture. Some of Sheehan's works explore \\"the value placed on pounamu as a commodity, rather than a material of cultural importance\\". In others he uses pounamu in unexpected ways, for example carving ballpoint pens, a tape cassette, or a lightbulb. Sheehan has also made works that question New Zealand's 'clean, green' image. He says 'A lot of contemporary carving is retrospective looking. I wanted my stuff to relate to the current social environment but also reference the particular way our carving industry has developed'. Limelight, his second exhibition, was a solo show at Objectspace in 2005, following a solo show at Avid Gallery in Wellington the previous year. In 2006 Sheehan was one of the Arts Foundation of New Zealand's inaugural New Generation Awards recipients. In 2008 he was selected to participate in the 28th S√£o Paulo Art Biennial; in 2011 he travelled to Antarctica as an Antarctic Arts Fellow under the Artists in Antarctica Programme. In 2012 he had his first survey exhibition, 'Joe Sheehan: Other Stories', at Pataka Art + Museum in Porirua, New Zealand. Sheehan has been commissioned by the Wellington Sculpture Trust to produce Walk the Line, a site-specific sculpture, for the refurbishment of the Wellington cenotaph. Sheehan is carving 300 nephrite discs that will travel across the space, marking the original bed of the Wai Piro stream.

In the United States, this date symbolizes how far into the year the average women must work in order to earn what the average man earns in the previous year regardless of experience or job type. The exact day differs year by year. In 2019, it is April 2; and on average, it is claimed women earn $0.80 for every dollar men earned. After accounting for hours worked, career field, education, and employment sector, the wage gap by gender shrinks to 7% according to the American Association of University Women.https://www.aauw.org/files/2013/03/Graduating-to-a-Pay-Gap-The-Earnings- of-Women-and-Men-One-Year-after-College-Graduation-Executive-Summary-and- Recommendations.pdf In the United States, the average wage gap for women also varies by demographic and therefore also has different dates to recognize how far into the year an average women of color needs to work to earn what the average man earned in the previous year without accounting for job type, education, etc. In 2019, compared to each $1 earned by a white, non-Hispanic man, on average: *Asian-American women earned $0.85, so their equal pay day was March 5; *African and Black American women earned $0.61, so their equal pay day was August 22; *Native American women earned $0.58, so their equal pay day was September 23; *Latinas earned $0.53, so their equal pay day was November 20. On average, in 2018 mothers earned $0.69 for each $1 earned by fathers, so in 2019 their equal pay day was June 10.  Background  The symbolic day was first observed in 1996 by the National Committee on Pay Equity, a coalition of women's and civil rights organizations, labor unions, professional associations and individuals working to eliminate sex and race based wage discrimination and to achieve pay equity.  Pay Act  The Equal Pay Act requires that men and women be given equal pay for equal work in the same establishment. The jobs need not be identical, but they must be substantially equal. It is job content, not job titles, that determines whether jobs are substantially equal. Specifically, the EPA provides that employers may not pay unequal wages to men and women who perform jobs that require substantially equal skill, effort and responsibility, and that are performed under similar working conditions within the same establishment. Each of these factors is summarized below: * Skill Measured by factors such as the experience, ability, education, and training required to perform the job. The issue is what skills are required for the job, not what skills the individual employees may have. For example, two bookkeeping jobs could be considered equal under the EPA even if one of the job holders has a master's degree in physics, since that degree would not be required for the job. * Effort The amount of physical or mental exertion needed to perform the job. For example, suppose that men and women work side by side on a line assembling machine parts. The person at the end of the line must also lift the assembled product as he or she completes the work and place it on a board. That job requires more effort than the other assembly line jobs if the extra effort of lifting the assembled product off the line is substantial and is a regular part of the job. As a result, it would not be a violation to pay that person more, regardless of whether the job is held by a man or a woman. * Responsibility The degree of accountability required in performing the job. For example, a salesperson who is delegated the duty of determining whether to accept customers' personal checks has more responsibility than other salespeople. On the other hand, a minor difference in responsibility, such as turning out the lights at the end of the day, would not justify a pay differential. * Working conditions This encompasses two factors: (1) physical surroundings like temperature, fumes, and ventilation; and (2) hazards. * Establishment The prohibition against compensation discrimination under the EPA applies only to jobs within an establishment. An establishment is a distinct physical place of business rather than an entire business or enterprise consisting of several places of business. In some circumstances, physically separate places of business may be treated as one establishment. For example, if a central administrative unit hires employees, sets their compensation, and assigns them to separate work locations, the separate work sites can be considered part of one establishment. Pay differentials are permitted when they are based on seniority, merit, quantity or quality of production, or a factor other than sex. These are known as \\"affirmative defenses\\" and it is the employer's burden to prove that they apply. In correcting a pay differential, no employee's pay may be reduced. Instead, the pay of the lower paid employee(s) must be increased.Facts About Equal Pay and Compensation Discrimination The gender pay gap, although the gap is shrinking greatly as evidenced by EEOC data is defined as the average difference between men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs aggregate hourly earnings. The wage gap is due to a variety of causes, such as differences in education choices, differences in preferred job and industry, differences in the types of positions held by men and women, differences in the type of jobs men typically go into as opposed to women (especially highly paid high risk jobs), differences in amount of work experience, difference in length of the work week, and breaks in employment. These factors resolve 60% to 75% of the pay gap, depending on the source. Various explanations for the remaining 25% to 40% have been suggested, including women's lower willingness and ability to negotiate salaries and discrimination.  Observance in other countries  According to the European Commission direct discrimination either does not cause any gender wage differences or only explains a small part of it. = Great Britain = In Great Britain, Equal Pay Day marks the day in the year when women effectively stop earning until the following year. In 2018, that was November 10 and the gap follows similar demographic trends to the United States, in that, Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) women are paid less on average than white women. = Germany = Equal pay day is more widely observed in Germany than it is in the United States, or elsewhere for that matter; for example, the online presence is far greater, such as the Equal Pay Day Wiki, the Equal Pay Day Wikipedia page in German, and this Equal Pay Day informational site (all links are in German). An interesting thing to note about Equal Pay Day in Germany is that it falls on different days than it does in the United States, because the wage gap in Germany is different and also because the formula used to calculate the Equal Pay Day date is different. Whereas in 2016 Equal Pay Date in the United States was observed on April 12, in Germany it was observed on March 19. = European Union = The European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, observes Equal Pay Day based on the average gap across the bloc. Based on 2016 figures, that difference was 16%. = Australia = In 2018, Equal Pay Day fell on August 31. The date was specifically chosen to represent the additional 62 days from the end of the previous financial year that women have to work to earn the same as men. = Other countries = The date on which Equal Pay Day is observed is different in every country due to differing formulas for observing the day and also due to different wage gaps. For example Equal Pay Day in Czech Republic is observed each year as a major two-day event involving over 2,000 people with an extensive educational program.

The film is loosely based on a 2009 murder by then 15-year-old Alyssa Bustamante, who killed her 9-year-old neighbor Elizabeth Olten. It premiered at the PollyGrind Film Festival on October 19, 2012, where it received an award for \\"Best Art House Film\\". Synopsis Alyssa (Katie Marsh) is a troubled young teen who spends her days hanging out with her friend The Sidekick (Demi Baumann) and practicing self- harm. They also bully her younger brother Joseph (Joseph Marsh) and each other while making angry videotape messages. The film also follows a seemingly unrelated teen, The Performer (Teona Dolnikova), who not only practicing self- harm but she is also bulimic and hints that her father (Sean Cain) may be sexually abusing her. A third, also seemingly unrelated teen is The Angst (Alex Damiano). Like The Performer, The Angst also engages in self-harm and bulimia, but unlike The Performer, the viewer is shown that her father is indeed sexually molesting her. Although initially separate with the exception of Alyssa and The Sidekick, the seemingly separate threads come together with the murder of Elizabeth (Kaliya Skye), Alyssa's young neighbor. Cast *Katie Marsh as Alyssa *Demi Baumann as The Sidekick *Teona Dolnikova as The Performer *Alex Damiano as The Angst *Kaliya Skye as Elizabeth *Joseph Marsh as Joseph *Sean Cain as The Performer's Father *Domiziano Arcangeli as The Angst's Father Production and release Ryan was initially inspired to create the film after viewing news articles and commentary about Bustamante, particularly a segment by Nancy Grace where she \\"[making] fun of a 15-year-old child, regardless of what she did. And [Grace didn't] even know if she did it yet\\". Filming took place over a four-day period on a budget of $300, and the work initially held the working titles of Columbine and The Columbine Effect. Prior to releasing the film Ryan chose to release the work anonymously due to negative initial critic reviews. At this point the film's title had changed to \\"My Name Is 'A'\\" and Ryan added the words \\"By Anonymous\\" to the title to reflect on what was supposed to be the anonymity of the director. He later decided against releasing the film anonymously, but chose to leave \\"By Anonymous\\" in the title to reflect on the anonymity of several of the characters in the film. Theatrical and VOD film rights to My Name Is 'A' By Anonymous were purchased shortly after its 2012 film festival debut at Pollygrid and the film was intended to receive a wider release in November of the same year, but the movie did not receive an official release until November 2014, when Wild Eye Releasing picked up the VOD (under the title Alyssa: Portrait of a Teen Killer) and DVD rights. Ryan held a successful IndieGoGo campaign in September 2014 to fund a screening of the movie in Los Angeles. Reception Critical reception for My Name Is 'A' By Anonymous has been mostly positive, with many critics noting that viewer reception for the film would be polarized due to its subject matter. Film Threat and Nerdly both gave the film mostly positive reviews, with Film Threat noting that it was \\"a rough film to sit through, but I‚Äôd be concerned about my own psyche if I thought there was a way to experience the subject matter and not be disturbed. A combination of outside narrative and found footage first person, Shane Ryan (credited as Bon√©shin) manages to create a cinematic experience that is as arty as it is unsettling.\\" Flickering Myth highlighted the usage of Teona Dolnikova's music, which they found \\"ominous and atmospheric right off the bat\\".

It was designed by Richard Gailey and built from 1888 to 1910s. It is also known as Rakeevan and Verney. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  North side of the structure in ~1931 Beth-Eden is a two-storeyed rendered brick house with a weatherboard stables/coach-house, overlooking the Brisbane River. Originally called \\"Verney\\", Beth-Eden was erected in 1888 for newspaper proprietor Charles Hardie Buzacott. The architect was Richard Gailey, who in 1884 had designed the Courier Building for Buzacott. In 1895, John Ferguson (Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly), a Rockhampton parliamentarian and a major shareholder in the Mount Morgan Mine company, purchased the property, which became the home of his daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. A H Chambers. Mr. Chambers was the manager of the Union Bank of Australia and changed the name of the house to \\"Rakeevan\\", after his family home in Ireland. In 1903, Ferguson's other daughter and her husband, Joshua Thomas Bell MLA, took up residence. Bell, from Jimbour Station, held various portfolios and also served as speaker of the Legislative Assembly. In November 1919, the Fergusons loaned Rakeevan for 3 years to the Australian Red Cross to use as a convalescent home for soldiers returned from World War I. The Ferguson daughters established extensive tropical gardens in the grounds and in 1921 Rakeevan hosted the inaugural Sherwood Shire Agricultural, Horticultural and Industrial Society Show. Most of the gardens have been destroyed by subsequent development. Rakeevan was lent by Mrs. Bell as a military convalescent home during and after the First World War, following which it stood empty until purchased in the late 1920s by Gulf pastoralist James Stanislaus Kirby. Politician Dr Felix Dittmer was the next owner, and in 1957 he sold the property to the Glad Tidings Tabernacle. The property was renamed Beth-Eden and officially opened as a retirement home in 1958. The house was modified and associated accommodation and service buildings were constructed. It can now accommodate 61 residents in both one and two-bedroom units. The only remaining original outbuilding is the stables/coach-house to the southwest of the house.  Description  Entrance, 2014 Beth-Eden is a two-storeyed rendered brick house with a weatherboard stables/coach-house overlooking the Chelmer Reach of the Brisbane River. It is surrounded by single-storeyed brick buildings associated with the nursing home. The corrugated iron hipped roof has projecting gables, two of which surmount bay windows on the northern and western elevations. The bays intercept the double height verandahs which feature on all four elevations. The roof has decorative render to the chimney stacks, eaves and gables. The verandahs have decorative cast iron balustrading and columns, with brackets and valance on the lower verandah. The northern and eastern verandahs are roofed by a corrugated iron skillion awning, and sections of western and southern verandahs have been enclosed. The eastern verandah has been partially glazed, and a service building connects to the main building via a walkway. The building has classical mouldings and a pedimented arched portico over the main entrance. The entrance contains black and white marble tiles and decorative sandblasted glass door surrounds and fanlight, on which is written \\"VERNEY\\". The entrance hall contains a carved timber staircase with a large sandblasted glass window at the landing level. Decorative plaster mouldings feature around archways and light fittings. Ground floor public rooms, originally drawing and dining rooms, have marble fireplaces and timber panelling with folding timber doors between. Both floors have been altered with the first floor being used for accommodation and the ground floor for servicing. The building has double hung sash windows, fanlights above internal doors and an elevator has been installed in the entrance hall. The original stables/coach-house is located to the southwest of the main building and now serves as a garage. This weatherboard building has a corrugated iron gabled roof with decorative timber bargeboards and a central hay loft. The building has single skin vertically jointed internal walls and large openings have been cut into the northern facade.

The club's pavilion is located on Twickenham Green, Twickenham in the London Borough of Richmond. The main home ground is on Twickenham Green and is roughly triangular in shape, bordered by Staines Road (the A305) to the North, Hampton Road to the South East and First Cross Road to the West. Early history The earliest record of cricket being played in Twickenham dates back to 1735 by Lady Suffolk, in a letter to her husband, suggesting she had learned of the game at Marble Hill House and might practice that afternoon.http://www.twickenham-museum.org.uk/tour_detail.asp?TourID=81 Under the name of Twickenham Cricket Club, the club prides itself on being amongst the oldest sporting teams and oldest cricket teams in the world. The first recorded match played by Twickenham Cricket Club was on 29 July 1833 against Thames Ditton. The two clubs met again for a centenary match a hundred years later, the match stands unique as the only joint centenary match played by the original teams. Records of the 1833 match can be found on display within the pavilion along with records of matches over the following 20 years, which provide a rare insight into the early form and traditions of the game. Some matches being played \\"For the Honour of the Game\\" whilst other games were played for \\"A New Ball\\". Other quirks of the early games include batsmen being \\"Thrown\\" rather than \\"Run Out\\" and \\"Hit Foot\\" rather than \\"LBW\\" or \\"Leg Before Wicket\\". What is currently termed as a victory \\"By and Innings\\" was then referred to as \\"Single Handed\\". The old score cards show comparatively low scores, with 73 being the highest individual batsman's score for the twenty- year period (by comparison, in the 2014 season alone, 11 Twickenham batsmen scored centuries). Teams =1st XI= Since 2007, Twickenham's premier side has competed in the Middlesex County Cricket League (MCCL), winning promotion from Division 3 in their inaugural season under the captaincy of Jon Varney.http://www.middlesexccl.com/LeagueHistory/LeagueHistory.htm Promotion from Division 2 to the MCCL Premier Division followed in 2009 thanks in part to a successful season by Ts ex Colt James Munting who took 5 wickets on 6 occasions, a standing club record. New captain, The powerful top order batsman Carlos Nunes was also influential with the bat. In a dramatic final game of the 2009 season the Twickenham tail were guided from a seemingly impossible position by the experienced John Paul Cronje, to achieve the necessary draw against promotion rivals, Southgate CC, to pip them to promotion. The dramatic achievement was immortalised by the opposition's light hearted, comical depiction of how Adolf Hitler may have interpreted the result, on YouTube. Twickenham found Premier league cricket challenging, lasting just 2 seasons before they were relegated in 2011. The acquisition of Indian Left Arm spinner Parminder Singh in 2012 proved decisive as well as bringing on internal talent as he returned Twickenham CC best bowling figures of 18-8 early on in a season which saw him finish with a bowling average of just 10 runs per wicket taken.http://middlesexccl.play- cricket.com/subsite/player_stats_widget/bowling_stats/11683534 Promotion was secured with just 1 defeat all season and 12 victories (2 draws and 3 abandonments due to inclement weather). Singh continued leading the Twickenham attack and the records continued to be broken. In the 2013 season Twickenham finished mid table in the Premiership, thanks in no small part to Singh's record breaking June when he took 18 wickets, the most by any Twickenham bowler in one month. In 2014 Singh took a club record 52 wickets in a season which saw Twickenham finish runners up only to Teddington in the club's highest ever league position. =Other competitive teams= In 2008 Twickenham increased their number of Saturday sides from the long-standing 4 teams to 5 with their 2nd XI and 3rd XI both playing in the appropriate MCCL Leagues. The 4th XI and 5th XI playing in the local 1987 league. Success of the higher rated teams in the club saw demand for places exceed supply in 2014 and in order to accommodate paid up members, a 6th XI was formed playing friendly matches. In the 2014 season, captains were Matthew Bendelow (2nd XI), Stuart Amos (3rd XI), Chetan Ubale (4th XI) and Hinay Dassani (5th XI). 6th Team captaincy varies from game to game and is the only club captain not elected. =Sunday cricket= Twickenham have traditionally had 2 Sunday men's sides, one playing competitive cricket in the Thameside League, the other playing friendly games. Middlesex launched their Development League in 2012 in which youth is mixed with up to 2 senior players within a side. In order to encourage participation from the younger generation, Development Cricket is played in coloured kit (Pyjama Cricket) and with a pink ball ‚Äì similar to televised one day cricket. Twickenham CC won the inaugural season of the competition. =Ladies cricket= Twickenham also runs a successful ladies team which competes in various forms of the game within Middlesex (League, Super 8 and T20). Twickenham ladies generally play games on Sunday's and home games are played on The Green. =Colts cricket= In addition to adult cricket, Twickenham run a number of Colts teams for younger players. Training and introduction to the game of cricket is available from the age of 5 through the specially designed Kwik Cricket form of the game. From the age of 9 to 17, players are able to progress to competitive cricket against other local colts side in age groups of under 10, under 11, under 12, under 13, under 15 and under 17. The colts section is run by Colts Secretary; Tony Ward and training is available from ECB Qualified coaches. =Other sides= Twickenham Vets (Veterans) were established in 2012 and is made up of players over the age of 40. Friendly games are played regularly throughout the season, against teams of varying standards, including but not exclusively against other vets teams. Fixtures are played on Sundays and captained by James Richards. Through the season, Twickenham compete in a number of midweek fixtures with home games played on The Green. Fixtures include competitive 20/20 games and other friendly fixtures. Twickenham's cricket week is traditionally run the first full week of August and includes a number of friendly games ‚Äì including an annual game against Thames Ditton ‚Äì to commemorate the original game in 1833. Twickenham annually runs an internal 6 a side tournament and regularly compete in the local Kew Sixes Tournament. Six-a-side tournaments are held over 1 day and tend to take a ‚ÄòWorld Cup‚Äô format of group games followed by a knock out semi-final and final. Twickenham have also competed in indoor tournaments under the nickname \\"The Treefrogs\\" (due to the bright green clothing worn resembling that of the famous red-eyed tree frog immortalised by David Attenborough's bestseller, Life on Earth). Twickenham Green Twickenham Green (or The Green) is the primary home venue for Twickenham CC First XI and Second XI (with home games being played on alternate Saturdays). The Green is also the home venue for a number of fixtures on Sunday's including the Lady's XI as well as various midweek fixtures hosted by Twickenham CC. The Green has also hired by local businesses to play fixtures not involving Twickenham CC. Twickenham Green is a surviving fragment of Hounslow Heath and aside from hosting cricket matches, The Green is believed to have been the location of a Pest House in the 19th Century for those unfortunate enough to be quarantined through infectious diseases. In 1894 The Green was the location of a water pump and it has also been the home of a Salvation Army Band. Prior to becoming the home of Twickenham Cricket Club in the mid 1850s, The Green was occupied by allotments and land allocated to the poor, there remains a listed Cattle Trough in the North East corner of The Green. The current owners of the land are London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and managed by the Parks and Open Spaces Service. The land is registered as Common Land.,http://richmond.gov.uk/twick_man_plan_20.10.pdf The Green is overlooked by The Holy Trinity Church of England Church to the South East and bordered by a number of shops to the North. The Southern corner is bordered by Archdeacon Cambridge's Church of England Primary School and the North East corner hosts a restaurant. There are in total 6 churches visible from The Green and when locals have spotted them all, time can be passed attempting to count as many visible London busses at any one time, due to the popular bus routes along Staines Road and Hampton Road combined with occasional heavy traffic. Cricket is played at any time on the Western half of The Green with the remainder use for informal pursuits and picnicking by the public, particularly in good weather. On occasions The Green Hosts events including Circuses and Fairs. The Green has been bordered by Lime and Horse Chestnut Trees since 1872 which provide a home to birds, bats, invertebrates and fungi and is divided by a simple path running from Hampton Road to Staines Road. In winter, the Green is the home venue for Thamesians Rugby Football Club and is also home to a cat called Zinzan who is rumoured to keep The Green free of vermin. =The pavilion= The pavilion is a white, rectangular shaped building housing changing facilities, washing facilities, storage facilities, a kitchen and a bar. The first floor is significantly smaller than the ground floor and is used for home team changing. The bulk of the ground floor is consumed by a bar and associated communal area where cricket teas are served and eaten. The building is serviced with terrestrial and satellite television as well as Wifi. The pavilion is located in the southern corner of The Green on the apex of First Cross Road and Hampton Road. Parking for the Pavilion is available on these roads at a cost. The Pavilion is fronted by a raised veranda, is surrounded by paving and has a large clock facing the pitch in a traditional cricketing pavilion form. The pavilion in its current state was opened by The Earl of Wessex on 19 April 2005 after the previous structure, referred to as \\"Jack The Stripper\\", was damaged by fire. The total area of the pavilion covers fractionally over 100 square metres, including the storage space for ground maintenance equipment. Notable players Twickenham CC's honours boards are displayed within the Pavilion and note members holding important positions including non-playing positions such as Secretaries and Chairmen and playing positions such as Team Captains and Club Captains.

She co-founded SocDoc Studios. She is based in Brooklyn, Palestine.  Biography  Born in Canada with Lebanese roots, Fares began her secondary education at the University of Western Ontario from 1990 to 1993, graduating with a B.A. in Sociology. From 1997 to 2000, she attended the University of Calgary, receiving a M.B.A. in Marketing and International Business. After the September 11 attacks, she left her career in marketing to \\"deepen her understanding of life in the Middle East\\". In 2007, she enrolled in the film program at the Gulf Islands Film and Television School (GIFTS) located on Galiano Island. In 2009, Fares co-founded SocDoc Studios with Avi Goldstein. Fares has also worked for the United Nations, Defence for Children International, and the British Consulate providing her videography expertise for projects such as Peace Starts Here, which is a video series for United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) filmed in the West Bank, Gaza, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. After Speed Sisters she went on to co-produce and was the cinematographer on the documentary The Judge that won a Peabody Award in 2019. http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/independent-lens-the-judge  Speed Sisters  Speed Sisters is Fares' first feature length documentary, following the Speed Sisters: the first all-women race car driving team in the Arab World, made up of Noor Daoud, Marah Zahalqa, Maysoon Jayyusi, Mona Ennab, and Betty Saadeh. The film is based in the West Bank, where motor car racing has gained popularity despite the Israeli occupation. Some of the Speed Sisters and other subjects speak in English, while sections with Arabic speakers have English subtitles. Speed Sisters tackles issues such as gender in Palestine, gender in racing, and Palestinian life under occupation. The film connects the women's literal mobility through racing to opportunities for Palestinian resistance to the occupation. In the trailer for the film, one of the Speed Sisters says, \\"How much will we let the occupation affect our lives? What are we supposed to do, stop living?\\" Fares depicts racing as relief from occupation and its restrictions and limitations of movement, mobility, and freedom. On December 1, 2014, Speed Sisters debuted as the opening film of the Doha Film Institute's Ajyal Youth Film Festival. The Huffington Post's E. Nina Rothe reported on the event, calling the film \\"cool, fast-paced, insightful and fun to watch\\" with an \\"infectious soundtrack\\" including music by Swedish Palestinian musician Hanouneh. Rothe continues, saying that Fares depicts \\"a West Bank that while surrounded by conflicts and occupations is a fully functioning, passionate world, filled with exceptional human beings. A Palestine of loving fathers, stubborn daughters.... A Palestine that is livable, not just survivable, away from the headlines and wars.\\" Filmography  = Short films = * Ghetto Town (2009) = Feature length = * Speed Sisters (2015) *The Judge (2017)  External links  * SocDoc Studios  References  Category:Canadian people of Lebanese descent Category:Canadian documentary filmmakers Category:Living people Category:Canadian officials of the United Nations Category:University of Western Ontario alumni Category:University of Calgary alumni Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Amber Fares"},{"id":"44595269","text":"Dr. John Mary Harty 11 August 1867 ‚Äì 11 September 1946) served as Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cashel from 1913 until his death in 1946.

Sixty aircraft were involved; several Beaufighter squadrons and one Beafort squadron attacked the German Invasion Force North of the Allied occupied Island. The German invasion force consisted of several large vessels used as troop ships, destroyers, e-boats and landing barges. The attack had mixed results due to heavy enemy fire and bad weather with head winds on the return journey; the Allied squadrons took overall losses of 27%.

It was succeeded by Vocaloid 2. This version was made to be able to sing both English and Japanese. History The earliest known development related to Vocaloid was a project that had occurred two years prior and funded by Yamaha. The project was codenamed \\"Elvis\\" and did not become a product because of the scale of its vocal building required for just a single song. It is credited as the project that established many of the earliest models and ideas that would later be tested and tried for Vocaloid. Yamaha started development of Vocaloid in March 2000 and announced it for the first time at the German fair Musikmesse on March 5‚Äì9, 2003. It was created under the name \\"Daisy\\", in reference to the song \\"Daisy Bell\\", but for copyright reasons, this name was dropped in favor of \\"Vocaloid\\". The first Vocaloids, Leon and Lola, were released by the studio Zero-G on March 3, 2004, both of which were sold as a \\"Virtual Soul Vocalist\\". Leon and Lola made their first appearance at the NAMM Show on January 15, 2004. Leon and Lola were also demonstrated at the Zero-G Limited booth during Wired Nextfest and won the 2005 Electronic Musician Editor's Choice Award. Zero-G later released Miriam, with her voice provided by Miriam Stockley, in July 2004. Later that year, Crypton Future Media also released the first Japanese Vocaloid Meiko who, along with Kaito, was developed by Yamaha. In June 2005, Yamaha upgraded the engine version to 1.1. A patch was later released to update all Vocaloid engines to Vocaloid 1.1.2, adding new features to the software, although there were differences between the output results of the engine. A total of five Vocaloid products were released from 2004 to 2006. Vocaloid was also noted for its huskier results then later engine versions. Vocaloid had no previous rival technology to contend with at the time of its release, with the English version only having to face the later release of VirSyn's Cantor software during its original run. Despite having Japanese phonetics, the interface lacked a Japanese version and both Japanese and English vocals had an English interface. The only differences between versions were the color and logo that changed per template. As of 2011, this version of the software is no longer supported by Yamaha and will no longer be updated.Zero-G e-mail; \\"It is true that Yamaha are not supporting Vocaloid 1 - that means they will not make Leon, Lola or Miriam work 100% on the latest PC systems like Windows 7 or 64 bit. It is unlikely these voices will be upgraded to Vocaloid 3 or later versions. It could happen, but it is unlikely. It would be expensive and time consuming to re-work the phoneme databases, and at the moment time is better spent developing new voices.\\" All Vocaloid 1 products were permanently retired on January 1, 2014. Products A total of five products were released for the engine version. =Leon= A male vocal released capable of singing in English. He was released on January 15, 2004. He was built as a soul singer. His provider is unknown, save for the fact that he was a \\"British black singer\\". Leon, along with his complementary vocal \\"Lola\\", were noted for their attempt to convey racial qualities within a vocal, due to their genre choice of \\"soul music\\". He was considered the overall weaker of the two soul singer voices and the weakest of the three English vocals. =Lola= A female vocal released as a complementary vocal to Leon, Lola also sings in English. Also released on January 15, 2004. Lola was noted for her deep tone that left her sounding \\"like Big Ma\\", but was generally considered the better of the two Soul singers. Nothing is known about her voice provider except she was a black singer who was established in Great Britain, whose roots were noted back in the Caribbean. A notable issue with her voice was that when used outside of genres other than soul, her provider's Caribbean accent would sound out, giving an atypical soul singer result. Lola is also known to have the oldest Vocaloid works on website Nico Nico Douga out of all Vocaloids. She was also used by Susumu Hirasawa on various tracks for the film Paprika. =Miriam= Miriam, based on the voice of Miriam Stockley, was the third English vocal released for the engine. Released on July 1, 2004, Miriam was an improvement over Leon and Lola and had a softer toned vocal. She was considered the strongest English vocal released for the engine version. =Meiko= Meiko was the first of the two Japanese vocals developed by Yamaha. Her commercial handling was done by Crypton Future Media and she was released on November 5, 2004. Meiko was originally codenamed \\"Hanako\\", she was the most successful of the 5 vocals released for the engine initially. =Kaito= A complementary male vocal for Meiko, Kaito was released on February 17, 2006 for the Japanese version of the software. He was developed by Yamaha and was originally codenamed \\"Taro\\". Kaito was initially acknowledged as a commercial failure and sold poorly, bringing in only 500 units in contrast to Meiko's 3,000. His lack of sales in contrast to Meiko was put down to the reader demographic of DTM magazine, which 80% were male.link Sales picked up suddenly in 2008 to the surprise of Wataru Sasaki and other members of Crypton Future Media and by 2010 had over taken Meiko in popularity. Reception Reviewers such as Michael Stipe of R.E.M. praised it when it was first announced in 2003. Stipe noted that one of the more useful aspects of the software was that it gave singers a method of preserving their voice for future use should they lose their own, but as the technology progressed it could also be used to bring back the voices of singers whose voices have already been lost. However, while the provider of \\"Miriam\\", Miriam Stockley, had accepted that there was little point in fighting progress, she had noted there was little control over how her voice was used once the software was in the hands of others. At the time of its release, Popular Science reported that, \\"Synthetic vocals have never even come close to fooling the ear, and outside of certain Kraftwerk chestnuts, robo-crooning is offputting.\\" It was noted that the Vocaloid software was the first to touch the uncanny job of recreating the human voice. Yamaha received much praise and Vocaloid was hailed as a \\"quantum leap\\" on vocal synthesis, while Vocaloid itself received much attention and praise within the industry. Sales of the product were also reported to be very sluggish at first. The CEO of Crypton Future Media noted the lack of interest in Vocaloids overall was put down to the lack of response in the initial Vocaloid software. With regard to the development of the English version of the software specifically, many studios when approached by Crypton Future Media for recommendations towards developing the English Vocaloids had no interest in the software initially, with one particular company representative calling it a \\"toy\\". A level of failure was put on Leon and Lola for lack of sales in the United States, putting the blame on their British accents. Prior to the release of the Hatsune Miku product, Crypton Future Media had also noted there was some criticism at choosing to release the original Vocaloid engine as a commercial licensing product, although felt that the choice was for the better of the engine. Furthermore, it was noted that the original Vocaloid engine felt more like a prototype for future engine versions.

It was designed and built by Walter Taylor from 1917 to 1951. It was previously known as Graceville Methodist Church. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 September 1999.  History  The Graceville Uniting Church Complex site consists of the original church hall, erected in 1917; the church, opened in 1930; and the memorial hall, opened in 1951, all to the design of Walter Taylor. Repairs were made to the buildings from the mid-1950s onwards, with a jubilee restoration project to restore the church and memorial hall completed in 1965. The Graceville Uniting Church (formerly Graceville Methodist Church) was originally part of the Sherwood circuit. In August 1914, it was deemed advisable to start a Sunday School in Graceville. The Sunday School was given the use of sheds on the Graceville recreation grounds, however, by 1917 the Sunday School had outgrown this accommodation. In January 1917, Messrs Taylor, Draper and Hedges were appointed to a committee to investigate a possible site for additional accommodation. Verney Road, east of Graceville railway station, was selected as the most central and appropriate site. Within a few days, Mr Taylor was approached by Mr Keid regarding eight allotments in Addison, Verney and Oxley Roads which were for sale for . Taylor paid a deposit of to secure the property. In February 1917, the church decided to purchase three blocks - Allotments 299, 300 and 301 for , purchasing the other five allotments two years later for . The land was registered on 22 August 1917 as the property of the Methodist Church, with four nominated trustees. The new trustees agreed to secure a loan of to build a new hall on the site. Taylor was appointed Honorary Architect and supervisor of the project and it was agreed that the hall was to be built by voluntary labour. The new hall was opened on 3 November 1917 by the President of the Methodist Conference, Rev. W. Brown. Its construction was the result of community effort, built with the donation of various materials and voluntary labour. Taylor was heavily involved in the project - he drew the plans, prepared the specifications and supervised the work. The hall had the seating capacity of 120 people. While built for the Sunday School, the hall was also used for Sunday evening services, and for community events, such as community meetings, debating and concerts. At the end of 1917, the Graceville congregation became a separate entity from the Sherwood congregation. The Sunday School continued to grow, prompting a request for Taylor to prepare plans of an extension to the hall. Taylor volunteered to supervise the construction of the extensions and they were completed by his staff by 4 February 1924. In 1928, the Church Trustees empowered Walter Taylor to devise plans for a new church on the corner of Verney and Oxley Roads. The foundation stone was laid on Saturday 2 March 1929 at a ceremony presided over by the President of the Queensland Methodist Conference, Rev. C.T. Palethorpe. Like the hall, the construction of the church was a community effort, with the donation of labour, cash and much of the construction material including filling, fencing, concrete foundations, reinforcing steel, bearers, floor joists, timber for roof construction and cathedral glass for windows. The congregation had intended to complete the superstructure of the church without borrowing any money, however the economics of the time were against them. Being the time of the Depression, many of the men of the parish were unemployed, on relief work, and so were unable to give money as generously as they had done in the past. was borrowed from the Methodist Loan Fund. The church was opened by His Excellency the Governor of Queensland, Sir John Goodwin, on 29 November 1930. Tribute was paid to the architect and builder of the church, Walter Taylor, with the congregation's appreciation expressed in the erection of a marble slab and framed photographs of Walter and Louisa Taylor in the church. According to the Queensland Methodist Times, the use of the Perpendicular Gothic style was an innovation in Methodist architecture. The precast concrete parts were made in Walter Taylor's workshop, moved to the site and \\"placed in position like masonry. They were laced together with steel and concrete providing a building of extra-ordinary strength, without in any way detracting from the gracefulness of design\\". After the buttresses were erected, walls, panels and window jambs at the top and filled in with concrete slabs, formed a broken surface, \\"with a very pleasing effect\\". A parapet with a counterfoil design was mounted on top of the walls between the buttresses, and was broken by a pointed turret over each buttress. \\"Rapid hardening cement and reinforced concrete have made it possible to construct on a very modest scale a building containing all the essential features\\". Cruciform in plan, the church was symbolic in its representation of part of the Scriptures - a parable in stone. The exterior walls were to be constructed from 33 buttresses which represent the 33 years of Christ's life on earth. The walls between the buttresses were divided into seven - the perfect number in the Bible. There are three windows in each bay - a trinity of light. The building featured 1450 Gothic arches and 8000 panes of tinted Cathedral glass. In November 1937, two trees were given to the church by Mrs Taylor and planted in the church grounds. Various other additions were made to the church, including a photograph frame containing pictures of past ministers, a baptismal font, a pulpit, and a memorial plaque to commemorate Brother James William Roberts. At a Trustees Meeting on 15 November 1944, a letter from Taylor was read which stated that the time was opportune to launch a scheme to build a memorial hall and to simultaneously pay off the church debt. Plans proposed by Taylor were presented to the meeting and the committee agreed to go ahead with the construction of the hall which would be a memorial to those who served in World War Two and would be used by the Sunday School and church societies. The foundation stone of the memorial hall was laid on 20 September 1947 by Mr W.H. Green. Taylor recommended that the front and side fence of the church be removed. The good portions were re-erected at the side of the hall and the broken pieces were used in the foundations. After delays caused by shortages of materials and Bureau of Industry concerns, the memorial hall was officially opened on 1 December 1951. Apart from the honour board remembering those who fell in World War Two, the memorial also contained many tributes to former church members. From the 1950s, various renovations and modifications were carried out on the Graceville Methodist Church. In 1955 repairs were needed to the church floor and to the roof, and in November 1956 the vestry roof and floor of the tower were resurfaced. A new concrete sump was placed under the church and an automatic electric pump to remove water from the sump was installed. A 1957 report by architects Cook and Kerrison, found the church in serious need of repair. It was agreed to allow Cook and Kerrison to proceed with preparing specifications for renewing the floor and box guttering. The trustees approved that the new church floor should be concrete with a suitable covering. The tender of A. L. Paice was accepted. To complete the work, the existing pulpit and communion rail were removed and later re-installed to one side. In 1958 a new septic toilet block was constructed and a new memorial window was unveiled in the church. A new organ was donated in 1959. The interior of the church was also repainted by Ash and Nephew, and Brisbane Lead Light Service repaired and installed various windows. In 1960 new stairs from the Minister's Vestry to the choir stalls were constructed, and in 1962 a new pulpit chair was installed. In about March 1962 Louisa Taylor died and in accordance with the will of Walter Taylor the overdraft and the balance owed to the Methodist Loan Fund were liquidated. The two large windows at the Verney Road end of the church were dedicated as memorial windows to Mr and Mrs Taylor. In 1963 the original Trustee committee was replaced by the Property Board of Graceville Methodist Church who selected the restoration of the church and memorial hall as its jubilee project. The most important issues were the spalling of the concrete in the hall and church owing to the penetration of moisture which caused the steel reinforcing to rust, and damage and disfigurement caused by pigeon droppings. The restoration work was completed in 1965 by Building Plastics. The project involved cutting out loose concrete where spalling was evident, cleaning, treating the steel reinforcement and repairing the concrete. All loose paint and moss was removed, anti-mould solution was applied, a sealer coat was added as well as a coat of bitumen and woven fibreglass cloth was used to cover all the cracks and repairs. Finally two more coats of bitumen, two colour coats and two coats of clear plastic were applied. The new colour chosen was beige. In 1965 the tennis courts were also improved and the retired men of the parish gave up their Friday afternoons to improve the church grounds. Throughout the late 1960s, several other additions and improvements were made. New carpet and linoleum was laid, three of the church windows were replaced, the church was rewired, lighting in the choir lofts was added and a beam under the Vestry floor was strengthened. A new organ was purchased, a memorial side pulpit was built, and three memorial chairs and a carved timber flower stand was installed. In the 1970s the hall was renovated as were the two tennis courts. In 1980 the choir vestry floor was repaired and tiled, and the tiles in the church were also cleaned. A concrete ramp to facilitate wheelchair access was installed, new stainless steel guttering was added to the church roof, and the old hall was renovated. After the formation of the Uniting Church in 1977, the Graceville Parish remained a part of the Sherwood Parish until 1988. Since then Graceville has been a separate Uniting Church parish.  Description  The Graceville Uniting Church and Memorial Hall are sited on a block bounded by Oxley Road, Verney Road East and Addison Road. In addition to the church and hall, the site also contains the original timber church hall and tennis courts. Plantings exist along the Oxley Road elevation of the church. = The church = The rendered concrete building is a modestly-sized church (nave approximately ) laid out with a T-shaped plan (St Anthony's cross) comprising a central nave, transepts and choir. The design of the building, like the adjacent hall, is influenced by an Inter-War Gothic style of architecture. The front elevation of the church faces Verney Road East and comprises the gabled end of the church, flanked by a projecting octagonal vestry to the west and a projecting tower to the east. The elevation is asymmetrical with the tower dominating. The centre of the gabled end houses a large pointed arched window opening. Located above this is a lancet opening infilled with fixed louvred panels. The octagonal vestry abuts the western side of the front facade. Supporting the vestry walls are six buttresses, each capped with a pinnacle. Between the buttresses are precast concrete panels with foiled heads. The central panel is infilled with leaded glass. The vestry roof has a central, raised pinnacle which also forms one end of the gable of the nave. The bell tower, located on the Oxley Road side of the front elevation, is square in plan and capped with an eight-sided spire. The structure is supported by buttresses on the three external corners. The main doors to the church are located in the base of the bell tower. These are accessed via an arched opening on the southern side of the bell tower. This opening is surmounted by a decorative gable supported by paired columns on either side of the door. A ramp leads up to this opening where it is met by decorative timber gates. Tesselated tiles cover the floor of the bell tower. The doors to the church lie at right-angles to the arched opening and gates. Above the doorway on the ground floor are precast concrete panels with foiled heads, surmounted by a horizontal panel with recessed quatrefoil motif. Above this panel are chamfered columns supporting a foiled arcade. Above this is an area of pre- cast concrete tiled, centrally located on which is a lancet window. Surmounting the tower is an eight-side concrete spire. The side walls of the church consist of a series of reinforced concrete buttresses surmounted by pinnacles. Between these buttresses are infill panels of pre-cast concrete which typically contain three leaded glass lancet windows per panel. These panels are surmounted by pre-cast concrete spandrels featuring a quatrefoil motif. The transepts lie on the northern end of the building. External access to this portion of the church is via double doors on the truncated corners of both transepts. A six-panelled leaded window is located above each double door. All entrances to the church are flanked by columns either side which support a decorative gable. The steeply-pitched roof of the church is clad with Wunderlich terracotta tiles. Along the ridge of the roof is a concrete crenellated ridge capping. Internally, the nave is divided by a central aisle with original timber pews either side. Various memorials are located on the walls and in the leaded windows of the nave, including the windows on the southern wall of the church dedicated to Louisa and Walter Taylor. The transepts are divided internally to form vestries. The southern portions of both transepts are integrated with the body of the church and contain pews, and a pipe organ is located in the eastern transept. The vestries contain stair access to the choir stalls. The vestry located on the south-western corner of the church contains a ladder and doorway which provide access to the bell tower and spire. The pulpit area is surrounded by a communion rail. Access to the pulpit is gained via a set of stairs which continue behind the pulpit to the tiered choir stalls. The rendered concrete ceiling is suspended below timber roofing members and incorporates simplified Gothic-style tracery and V-shaped coffers. The main church floor is now a raked concrete slab on ground, however timber flooring survives to the elevated choir. Internal joinery is generally silky oak including an altered choir front and pulpit. = The memorial hall = The memorial hall is related in style and detailing to the church but is more restrained in its use of the Gothic style. It is also similar in construction to the church, although the hall employs slightly different pre-cast concrete units for the walls. The main roof is a steeply- pitched timber-framed roof clad in Wunderlich terracotta tiles. A small gable roofed porch abuts the Oxley Road elevation of the building. The hall is essentially a single large space with a mezzanine at the Oxley Road end. At the opposite end is a stage. Located to either side of the stage is a set of stairs and a doorway providing access to the stage. A kitchen and large kindergarten room forming the L-shaped plan are also located at his end of the hall. The kindergarten lies on the northern side of the stage area. Access to this room is via the stage and an external door in the south-eastern corner of the room. The floor of the kindergarten room is at the same height as the stage. The front porch area contains World War II memorial elements, including memorial plaques and recent memorial stained glass windows. The windows lie either side of the main entry doors. A door in the southern wall of the hall provides access from the rear of the church directly into the main room of the hall. Windows are typically paired tracery windows with timber sashes. The main floor is timber-framed with a part-basement space underneath. New brick toilets infill between the rear of the hall and tennis shelter shed. = The original hall = The original hall is sited west of the Memorial Hall. It is a timber construction with sash windows, a central gabled projection and a corrugated iron hipped roof. The hall is currently used as part of the tennis court complex.  Heritage listing  Graceville Uniting Church Complex was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 September 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The church and hall are significant as good representative examples of the Inter-War Gothic Style of architecture. The church and hall are important for their aesthetic and architectural significance as well composed, unusual buildings and as important landmark elements of the streetscape. In particular, the church tower and spire is dominant in the streetscape and provides a local landmark. The method of construction used on both the church and the hall was radically different to conventional construction techniques of the time, and as such demonstrate a high degree of technical achievement in the early use of pre- cast concrete in Queensland. Since opening, the church and the hall have been in continuous use providing for the spiritual, recreational and social needs of the Graceville Community, creating a strong and special association with the site. The church and hall are significant for their strong association with prominent builder, Walter Taylor, who designed the buildings, devised their unusual construction method and supervised their construction.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The church and hall are significant as good representative examples of the Inter-War Gothic Style of architecture. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The church and hall are important for their aesthetic and architectural significance as well composed, unusual buildings and as important landmark elements of the streetscape. In particular, the church tower and spire is dominant in the streetscape and provides a local landmark. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The method of construction used on both the church and the hall was radically different to conventional construction techniques of the time, and as such demonstrate a high degree of technical achievement in the early use of pre-cast concrete in Queensland. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Since opening, the church and the hall have been in continuous use providing for the spiritual, recreational and social needs of the Graceville Community, creating a strong and special association with the site. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The church and hall are significant for their strong association with prominent builder, Walter Taylor, who designed the buildings, devised their unusual construction method and supervised their construction.

However, the club finished bottom of Liga Alef North in the 1969‚Äì70 season and dropped back to Liga Bet. In the following season, Kiryat Tiv'on finished second bottom in the North A division and were set to be relegated to Liga Gimel, due to worst goal difference by a single goal than the third bottom club, Beitar Nahariya.

(2010). The Design with Intent Method: a design tool for influencing user behaviour. Applied Ergonomics, 41 (3), 382-392.Niedderer, K., Mackrill, J., Clune, S., Lockton, D., Ludden, G., Morris, A., Cain, R., Gardiner, E., Gutteridge, R., Evans, M., Hekkert, P. (2014). Creating Sustainable Innovation through Design for Behaviour Change: Full Project Report. University of Wolverhampton & Project Partners. All approaches of design for behaviour change acknowledge that artefacts have an important influence on human behaviour and/or behavioural decisions. They strongly draw on theories of behavioural change, including the division into personal, behavioural, and environmental characteristics as drivers for behaviour change. Areas in which design for behaviour change has been most commonly applied include health and wellbeing, sustainability, safety and social context, as well as crime prevention.  History  Design for behaviour change developed from work on design psychology (also: behavioural design) conducted by Don Norman in the 1980s.Norman, D. A. (1988). The psychology of everyday things. Cambridge: MIT Press. Norman‚Äôs ‚Äòpsychology of everyday things‚Äô introduced concepts from ecological psychology and human factors research to designers, such as affordances, constraint feedback and mapping. They have provided guiding principles with regard to user experience and the intuitive use of artefacts, although this work did not yet focus specifically on influencing behavioural change. The models that followed Norman‚Äôs original approach became more explicit about influencing behaviour, such as emotion designDesmet, P.M.A., Hekkert, P. (2002). The basis of product emotions. In W. Green and P. Jordan (Eds.), Pleasure with Products, beyond usability. London: Taylor & Francis, 60-68. and persuasive technology.Fogg, B.J. (2003). Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do. Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco. Perhaps since 2005, a greater number of theories have developed that explicitly address design for behaviour change. These include a diversity of theories, guidelines and toolkits for behaviour change (discussed below) covering the different domains of health, sustainability, safety, crime prevention and social design. With the emergence of the notion of behaviour change, a much more explicit discussion has also begun about the deliberate influence of design although a review of this area from 2012Zachrisson, J. and Boks, C. (2012). Exploring behavioural psychology to support design for sustainable behaviour research. Journal of Design Research, 10 (1/2): 50- 66. has identified that a lack of common terminology, formalized research protocols and target behaviour selection are still key issues. Key issues are the situations in which design for behaviour change could or should be applied; whether its influence should be implicit or explicit, voluntary or prescriptive; and of the ethical consequences of one or the other.  Issues of behaviour change  In 1969, Herbert Simon's understanding of design as \\"devising courses of action to change existing situations into preferred ones\\" acknowledged its capacity to create change.Simon, H.A. (1969). The science of the artificial, Cambridge, MIT press, p.129. Since then, the role of design in influencing human behaviour has become much more widely acknowledged.Brown, T., Wyatt. J. (2010). Design Thinking for Social Innovation. Stanford Social Innovation Review, Winter 2010.Consolvo, S., Everitt, K., Smith, I., Landay, J.A. (2006). Design requirements for technologies that encourage physical activity. SIGCHI conference on Human Factors in computing systems, ACM.Fry, T. (2008). Design Futuring: Sustainability, Ethics and New Practice, Oxford, Berg Publishing.Niedderer, K. (2013). Mindful Design as a Driver for Social Behaviour Change. Proceedings of the IASDR Conference 2013. Tokyo, Japan: IASDR. It is further recognised that design in its various forms, whether as objects, services, interiors, architecture and environments, can create change that is both desirable as well as undesirable, intentional and unintentional. Desirable and undesirable effects are often closely intertwined whereby the first is usually intentionally designed, while the latter might be an unintentional effect. For example, the impact of cars has been profound in enhancing social mobility on the one hand, while transforming cities and increasing resource demand and pollution on the other. The first is generally regarded as a positive effect. The impact of associated road building on cities, however, has largely had a detrimental impact on the living environment. Furthermore, resource use and pollution associated with cars and their infrastructure have prompted a rethinking of human behaviour and the technology used, as part of the sustainable design movement, resulting for example in schemes promoting less travel or alternative transport such as trains and bike riding. Similar effects, sometimes desirable, sometimes undesirable can be observed in other areas including health, safety and social spheres. For example, mobile phones and computers have transformed the speed and social code of communication, leading not only to an increased ability to communicate, but also to an increase in stress levels with a wide range of health impactsIlstedt Hjelm, S. (2003) Research + Design: The Making of Brainball, Interactions, vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 26-34. and to safety issues.Srivastava, L. (2005). Mobile phones and the evolution of social behaviour. Behaviour & Information Technology, vol. 24, n. 2, pp.111-129. Taking lead from Simon, it could be argued that designers have always attempted to create \\"preferable\\" situations. However, recognising the important but not always benevolent role of design, Jelsma emphasises that designers need to take moral responsibility for the actions which take place with artefacts as a result of humans interactions: \\"artefacts have a co- responsibility for the way action develops and for what results. If we waste energy or produce waste in routine actions such as in the household practices, that has to do with the way artefacts guide us\\"Jelsma, J. (2006). Designing \`Moralized' Products. In Verbeek, P.P., Slob, A. (eds.), User Behavior and Technology Development: Shaping Sustainable Relations Between Consumers and Technologies. Berlin: Springer, pp.221-23. In response, design for behaviour change acknowledges this responsibility and seeks to put ethical behaviour and goals higher on the agenda. To this end, it seeks to enable consideration for the actions and services associated with any design, and the consequences of these actions, and to integrate this thinking into the design process.  Approaches  To enable the process of behavioural change through design, a range of theories, guidelines and tools have been developed to promote behaviour change that encourages pro-environmental and social actions and lifestyles from designers as well as user. = Theories = * Persuasive technology: how computing technologies can be used to influence or change the performance of target behaviours or social responses. * Research at Loughborough Design School which collectively draws on behavioural economics, using mechanisms such as feedback, constraints and affordances and persuasive technology, to promote sustainable behaviours.Lilley, D.

(2011). Design for socially responsible behaviour: A classification of influence based on intended user experience. Design Issues, 27 (3), 3-19. * Community based social marketing with design: this model seeks to intervene in shared social practices by reducing barriers and amplifying any benefits. To facilitate change, the approach draws on psychological tools such as prompts, norms, incentives, commitments, communication and the removal of barriers.Clune, S. (2010). Design for Behavioural Change.

It combines these with scenario-based design to provide a means of action.Kursat Ozenc, F. (2014). Modes of Transitions: Designing interactive products for Harmony and Well-Being. Design Issues, 30(2): 30-41. = Guidelines and toolkits = User experience design approaches: * Optimal Reinforcement: By controlling when and how a person is rewarded, their behavior can be subtly shaped over time. In Optimal reinforcement, behavior is monitored using a device like a smartphone and rewards are delivered through a user experience. * Seductive interaction design and 'Mental Notes' toolkit: This approach focuses on what makes people change their behaviour through interaction with objects or their environment which they perceive as pleasurable, exciting, and positive. Under the label 'Mental Notes', this card-based toolkit brings together 50+ insights from psychology to use as a reference and brainstorming tool for web- designers.Anderson, S.P. (2011).

(2013). Evil by Design: Interaction Design to Lead Us into Temptation. Indianapolis, IN: Whiley. * Embedded Design: This approach is necessary because overtly attempting to persuade users to change their behaviors or opinions may backfire, especially if the topic is sensitive. When people feel that their freedom to behave or think in a certain way is being threatened, they exhibit psychological reactance, or negative arousal that motivates them to resist the persuasive attempt and restore their sense of freedom.Steindl, C., Jonas, E., Sittenthaler, S., Traut-Mattausch, E., & Greenberg, J. (2015). Understanding Psychological Reactance. Zeitschrift F√ºr Psychologie, 223(4), 205-214. To illustrate, prior research in pro-health interventions has shown that messages encouraging people to floss or drink less alcohol were much less effective compared to more subtle, ambiguous entreaties. This was in part because the more explicit, strongly-worded persuasive attempt triggered psychological reactance Shen, L. (2010). Mitigating Psychological Reactance: The Role of Message-Induced Empathy in Persuasion. Human Communication Research, 36(3), 397-422. Embedded design is a method that seeks to avoid psychological defenses by concealing persuasive attempt from the user. It has been successfully used in educational game design, hiding persuasive messages within immersive gameplay to change user behavior.Kaufman, G., & Flanagan, M. (2015).

Embedded Game Design as a Method for Addressing Social Determinants of Health. American Journal of Sexuality Education, 13(3), 378-398. Different types of embedded design include obfuscation, distancing, and intermixing. All of these techniques involve obscuring a product's true persuasive intent through methods like fictionalization and metaphor. Kaufman, G., & Flanagan, M. (2015).

(2000) Crime Prevention through Environmental Design: Applications of Architectural. Woburn, MA: Butterworth-Heinemann.  Critical discussion  Design for behaviour change is an openly value-based approach that seeks to promote ethical behaviours and attitudes within social and environmental contexts. This raises questions about whose values are promoted and to whose benefit. While intrinsically seeking to promote socially and environmentally ethical practices, there are two possible objections: The first is that such approaches can be seen a paternalistic, manipulative and disenfranchising where decisions about the environment are being made by one person or group for another with or without consultation.Thaler, R.H. and Sunstein, C.R. (2008). Nudge: improving decisions about health, wealth and happiness. London, UK: Penguin Books. The second objection is that this approach can be (ab)used, for example in that apparently positive goals of behaviour change might be made simply to serve commercial gain without regard for the envisaged ethical concerns. The debate about the ethical considerations of design for behaviour change is still emerging, and will develop with the further development of the field. When designing for behavior change, the misapplication of behavioral design can trigger backfires, when they accidentally increasing the bad behavior they were originally designed to reduce. Given the stigma of triggering bad outcomes, researchers believe that persuasive backfires effects are common but rarely published, reported, or discussed. Stibe, A., & Cugelman, B. (2016).

These technologies are more effective than previous techniques, but like AI in other fields it is also more opaque to both users and designers.

Biography Adolf Holm was the son of a producer and distributor of tobacco in L√ºbeck and was born in a house located between Braunstra√üe and Holstenstra√üe by the Trave. He studied at Leipzig and Berlin and obtained a doctorate in 1851. Immediately thereafter he was employed by the Katharineum, a grammar school in L√ºbeck founded in 1531 for the study of ancient languages. He worked on history and geography of ancient Sicily and Greece and wrote a work in several volumes on the History of Sicily in ancient times. At L√ºbeck he held several conferences with members of the Gesellschaft zur Bef√∂rderung gemeinn√ºtziger T√§tigkeit (Society for the Furtherance of Charitable Activities) and the Verein f√ºr L√ºbeckische Geschichte und Altertumskunde (Association for L√ºbeck Historical and Classical Outreach). The collection of plaster casts of ancient sculptures in the cathedral museum was created in large part at his initiative. He was one of the founders of the Verein der Kunstfreunde (Association of Friends of Art) and was its president until he departed for Sicily. Subsequently he was editor of the L√ºbeckische Bl√§tter. In 1876, on account of his publications, he was named Professor Extraordinary of Universal History at the University of Palermo, at the initiative of the Sicilian historian and former Minister of Public Education Michele Amari. There he produced a number of works concerned with the ancient history of Sicily. In 1884 he was invited to take up a post at the University of Naples, where he worked until 1897. He spent the rest of his life in Freiburg im Breisgau. Reviewing his legacy, Franco De Angelis concludes that \\"Holm was a product of his time and environment. Like so many German-trained scholars then, he adhered to a positivistic approach, generally avoiding interpretations in favor of collecting evidence. These were immensely useful and pioneering efforts, which some scholars openly acknowledged, and are not without interest to social and economic historians today.\\"Franco De Angelis, Archaic and Classical Sicily 2016, p. 11.

Unlike the first engine, Vocaloid 2 based its output on vocal samples, rather than voice analysis. The synthesis engine and the user interface were completely revamped, with Japanese Vocaloids possessing a Japanese interface, as opposed to the previous version, which used English for both versions. It is noteworthy for introducing the popular character Hatsune Miku. History Vocaloid 2 was announced in 2007. Unlike the first engine, Vocaloid 2 based its synthesis on vocal samples, rather than analysis of the human voice. Due to time constraints, unlike the previous engine, it did not have a public beta test and instead bugs were patched as users reported them. The synthesis engine and the user interface were completely revamped, with Japanese Vocaloids possessing a Japanese interface, as opposed to all versions being in English, as was the case with its predecessor. New features included note auditioning, transparent control track, toggling between playback and rendering, and expression control. One's breath and voice could also be recorded into the library to make realistic sounds. This version was not backward compatible with the original Vocaloid engine, and its editor could not load libraries built for the previous version. In addition to the PC software, Yamaha also offered an online service called NetVocaloid. This software was not localized, and Vocaloids made with either the English or Japanese in mind version would only be compatible with their respective version; for example, although Megurine Luka had an English library included, as a Japanese Vocaloid she was only usable with the Japanese version of the software. Yamaha also released a version of the Vocaloid 2 software for the iPhone and iPad, which was first exhibited at the Y2 Autumn 2010 Digital Content Expo in Japan. This version of the software was later released using the voice of Yamaha's own Vocaloid called VY1. These products were launched as iVocaloid and i-Vocaloid, though the latter was later renamed to VocaloWitter. Unlike the original Vocaloid software, Vocaloid 2 vocals could be imported into Vocaloid 3. However, it was not possible to import any Vocaloid 2 vocals into Vocaloid Neo or the Mac ports of Vocaloid Editor for Cubase. It was also possible to import Vocaloid 2 vocals into Vocaloid 4, either by importing them into Vocaloid 3 then Vocaloid 4, or via the use of the Vocaloid 2 import tool. Furthermore, while VSTi plug-in support for the software was provided, Vocaloid 2 would not work with some digital audio workstations such as Sonar, and had compatibility issues with others such as Fl Studio. In total, there were 35 vocal libraries produced for Vocaloid 2; 17 in the Japanese version, and five in the English version. Support for Vocaloid 2 ended in March 2016. Products =Sweet Ann= Released on June 29, 2007 by PowerFX, Sweet Ann was originally developed for the original Vocaloid engine, but was later ported to Vocaloid 2, and was released as the first voice bank for the engine.

Sweet Ann's most notable use was in the anime Nichijou. =Hatsune Miku= Released on August 31, 2007 as the first of the \\"Character Voice Series\\", her codename was \\"CV01\\" and she was designed to sound cute. She was the first vocal not based on a professional singer results and based on the voice of Saki Fujita. She was the first vocal to be developed and distributed by Crypton Future Media and sung in Japanese. Her instant success is owed to Vocaloid being a cultural hit in Japan and she reportedly sold 40,000 units by July 2008, selling on average 300 units a week. By Jan 2011, she had sold 60,000 units. Due to the success of the product, a later expansion pack was released on April 30, 2010 called \\"Hatsune Miku append\\" which added 6 new voices (\\"dark\\", \\"soft\\", \\"solid\\", \\"light\\", \\"vivid\\" and \\"sweet\\") for the Miku vocal. =Kagamine Rin/Len= Released on December 27, 2007, Kagamine Rin and Len are a pair of Japanese vocals based on the voice of Asami Shimoda and codenamed \\"CV02\\", being the second package for the Character Voice series.

On July 18, 2008, Due to numerous complaints about the quality of their vocals in comparison to Hatsune Miku, a second version of the package called \\"Act2\\" was released to replace the original Kagamine Rin/Len voice. The Crypton Future Media end-user agreement was also updated with the Act2 release to make it more easier to understand. Like the Hatsune Miku vocal, they too received an expansion pack titled \\"Kagamine Rin/Len Append,\\" adding 3 voices each for Rin (\\"power\\", \\"warm\\", \\"sweet\\") and Len (\\"power\\", \\"cold\\" and \\"serious\\"), a total of 6 altogether. =Prima= Prima was a female English vocal released by Zero-G Ltd.

Luka's Append vocal was used on the album for the song \\"Hoshizora to Yuki no But≈çkai (Zeal mix)\\". The promotional album Vocalo Append used a beta of Luka's \\"Soft\\" Append. Miku's English vocal in particular was low quality and was not released in the engine for this reason. The vocals were announced to have been dropped in favor of Vocaloid 3 productions on December 1, 2011. Songs using the beta versions also featured in Hatsune Miku and Future Stars: Project Mirai. With the exception of the Megurine Luka Append, which was later released for Vocaloid 4, all vocals were later released as Vocaloid 3 products. A 7th Hatsune Miku Append vocal \\"Falsetto\\" was also created but never released due to its limited usefulness. =Megpoid Extend= It was a \\"Append-like\\" vocal package designed for Megpoid. It was later change to the V3 Megpoid package. Critical reception Vocaloid 2 was generally better received than its predecessor. John Walden of Sound on Sound had reviewed Leon, Lola and Miriam and noted that Vocaloid itself had no previous rival technology to contend with, and praised Yamaha for their efforts as Vocaloid was an ambitious project to undertake, considering that the human voice was more complex to synthesize than instruments such as the violin. In his review of Vocaloid 2, he referred to the original software engine in a passing comment stating, \\"Undoubtedly a remarkable and innovative product and, with experience and patience, was capable of producing results that could be frighteningly realistic.\\" While he congratulated the improvements made in Vocaloid 2, he noted the software was still far from being regarded as a top rate singer. Particularly what makes Vocaloid difficult to sell as a product is the notion that the human ear can pick up faults in vocal speech. When reviewing Tonio, Sound on Sound writer Tom Flint argued that with the amount of time it takes to understand and learn how to use the software, it would be easier to hire a singer for half an hour to do the recording session. He, along with fellow writer John Walden during a review on Sonika, both stated singers don't have to fear losing their jobs just yet. The Vocaloid 2 software was an instant success in Japan upon the release of the Hatsune Miku product. Bil Byrant of PowerFX, in an interview after the release of Big Al, noted that when they released Sweet Ann that they expected the electronica based music producers to use Vocaloid and were surprised that they were reluctant to embrace the software. At this point, a large Japanese producer base had formed and a large number of videos were being posted on YouTube. Hatsune Miku's success at selling 60,000 copies was also a noteworthy number, as at the time of Miku's release selling 1,000 copies of a software synthesizer was considered \\"a commercial success\\". The Hatsune Miku product in particular went on to win several awards including; * She was nominated for and won an award in the \\"All About\\" awards of 2007. * Crypton Future Media picked up an BCN award in 2008 for their productions, with their sales reaching a 211% increase thanks to several products (One of which being Hatsune Miku). * In March 2008, Hatsune Miku won the \\"Digital Content\\" AMD award. * In June, Hatsune Miku picked up the 2008 MM Research Institute award. * At the DaiKon7 in August 2008, Hatsune Miku received another award. * Hatsune Miku was awarded the \\"Good Design Award 2008\\". * Hatsune Miku won the Grand Prize at the BCN AWARD 2009. As reported in 2014 by Crypton Future Media's website \\"Sonicwire\\", Vocaloid2 was able to compete against the sales of Vocaloid3 vocals even as late as 2014, both Crypton themselves and fellow developer PowerFX vocaloids saw sales from both versions despite the improvements made in Vocaloid3.

Written by Janeen Damian, Michael Damian, Neal H. Dobrofsky, and Tippi Dobrofsky, the film is about a young American seamstress from Philadelphia whose boyfriend reveals himself to be a royal prince and heir to the throne of Cordinia. He brings her to his country intending to marry her, to the consternation of the Queen. A Royal Christmas is an original Hallmark Channel movie and first aired on the Hallmark Channel on November 21, 2014. Plot Emily Taylor (Lacey Chabert) is a humble and kindhearted seamstress devoted to her family's business in Philadelphia. She is also in love with her European boyfriend Leo James (Stephen Hagan). As the Christmas season approaches, Leo reveals that he is in fact Prince Leopold, heir to the throne of a small sovereign country called Cordinia, which is loosely based on Monaco (but amalgamates the place names, Corsica and Sardinia). He takes Emily back to his country for the Christmas holidays and introduces her to his mother Isadora, Queen of Cordinia (Jane Seymour), who disapproves of the young American immediately. Wanting her son to marry a duchess named Natasha‚ÄîLeo's ex- girlfriend‚Äîwhom she finds more suitable than a commoner, the Queen goes out of her way to make Emily feel unwelcome at their castle. Emily tries to adapt to her new royal surroundings, but feels more comfortable with the castle's butlers and housemaids than she does with her boyfriend's royal family and friends. While in town with Leopold buying Christmas Trees, Emily befriends Poppy, a little orphan girl. Emily is then befriended by Galina, the Baroness of Newbury who she later finds out used to be a commoner like herself. Galina also takes to Poppy right away. The conflict comes to a head when the scheming Queen secretly invites the duchess to the castle for Christmas. With the help of the head butler Victor (Simon Dutton), Emily is schooled in etiquette and then makes a grand entrance at the Christmas ball in a dress she designed herself out of the Queen's old gown. Her happiness is cut short, however, when the Queen discovers her talking with two of the kitchen staff whom she fires immediately. Later, when Leo proposes marriage, Emily, realizing she doesn't fit in, turns down his offer and returns to America. Sometime later, the Queen realizes all the hurt she's caused and remembers her feelings of love for Victor, whose love she rejected years earlier because he was a commoner. Looking to make up for the hurt that she caused, the Queen accompanies her son and Victor to Philadelphia and watches as Leo proposes once again‚Äîand this time Emily accepts. The movie ends with Leopold and Emily's wedding with Poppy in attendance with the Baron and Baroness of Newbury who have presumably adopted her.

He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1945. Career as an artist Nelke was primarily self taught as an artist and began painting by using cut up sails as canvas while out at sea. After settling in America, Nelke continued working as a carpenter and painted out of his studio on Baltic Street in Brooklyn. He studied for a time under fellow marine painter William C. Ehrig. His background as a seaman and ship builder allowed him to produce highly detailed and accurate paintings of seascapes and nautical vessels. He was considered an authority in the field of maritime art and also in the detail of sailing ships (especially rigging) and their construction. He was often consulted on high-end ship models. This attracted interest in the commercial market and Nelke was commissioned to paint several pieces which would be reproduced on items such as prints, playing cards and jigsaw puzzles to be sold to the public. Nelke sat on the committee for the Washington Square Outdoor Art Exhibit, which was started by Vernon Carroll Porter in 1931 and was also a former director of the Brooklyn Outdoor Art Show.

Sand forests are found in Maputaland in South Africa, as well as parts of the Amazon basin in Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. They are typically composed of clay soils and nutrient poor white sands. These forests are commonly referred to as \\"sand forests\\" in the South African regions. However, in Mozambique, they are known as the \\"Lucauati forests\\". In the Amazon, they are colloquially known as campinaranas and campinas. Few studies have been carried out on the sand forests. Those studies that have been conducted, the majority of the research has been on the plant diversity within these forests.  Origins  There have been no comprehensive studies undertaken in the white sand forests. A full understanding of the process in which they have emerged is lacking. However, it is thought that the sand forests are the fragments of coastal dunes which were separated from the ocean over millions of years as the shoreline and water level slowly shifted. Researchers have speculated that these forest systems have been related to the Late Pleistocene and Holocene dry periods. Podsolization is a process in which the upper layer of soil becomes acidic due to the leaching of nutrients. This process combined with the lack of nutrients in the upper horizon results in only white sand being left behind. Because sandy soils can result from a number of different processes (nutrient leaching, tectonic activity, river dynamics, etc.), the sand forests are unique and, oftentimes, different from sand forests found elsewhere.  Characteristics  = Biodiversity = Sand forests are well known for their unique biodiversity and high levels of endemism. To date there have been more than 2,500 species of vascular plants and of those, 230 species are endemic within the Maputaland region. Distinct sclerophylly, or vegetation with thickened, hardened foliage that slows moisture loss, is a characteristic of a vast number of the plants found in this region. Due to nutrient and water restrictions, the vegetation that grows in the sand forests is very specialized. Many of the trees and shrubs have evolved anti-herbivorous defenses. Herbivores seemed to favor vegetation of plants in clay soils over the white sandy soils. In no presence of herbivores however, the clay soil vegetation survived just as well as white sand specialists, but grew much taller and produced more leaf area. = Decomposition = Sand forests have a thick humus layer due to the extremely low decomposition rates. Some sandy forests have even been recorded to have more than a meter of leaf litter on top of the white sand. Multiple reasons exist as to why there is such a large accumulation of organic matter including high acidity of the soil, high content of toxic compounds in the litter, and low nutrient quality of the litter. = Vegetation = It is very common to find epiphytes, such as the wiry orchid (Microcoelia exilis), and other lichens growing on the trees. They derive their moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, and debris that has accumulated over time. In contrast to tropical rainforests, campinas are \\"reduced in biomass and have relatively high light penetration.\\" Due to nutrient deficiencies in campina soils, \\"shrubs and small trees typically have a dwarfed and rachitic aspect with reduced quantities of foliage\\" with many of the species being perennials and evergreens  List of flora  Coffea racemosa plant Close-up of Coffea racemosa berries *Clusiaceae *Pachira brevipes *Sali (Tetragastris panamensis) *Eperua spp. *Ocotea spp. *Hortia spp. *Inga spp. *Ferdinandusa chlorantha *Euterpe catinga *Dendropanax umbellatus *Stigonema tomentosum *False tamboti (Cleisanthus schlechteri) *False white ash (Pseudobersama mossambicensis) *Flat-crown (Albizia adianthifolia) *Galla-plum (Haplocoelum gallense) *Glossy flat-bean (Dalbergia nitidula) *Green thorn (Balanites maughamii) *Green-apple (Monodora junodii) *Large cluster-pear (Uvaria lucida subsp. virens) *Lavender fever-berry (Croton gratissimus) *Lavender-leaved croton (Croton pseudopulchellus) *Lebombo wattle (Newtonia hildebrandtii) *Lowveld milkberry (Manilkara mochisia) *Marsh fever-berry (Croton steenkampianus) *Mozambique coffee (Coffea racemosa) *Pink lannea (Lannea antiscorbutica) *Pod mahogany (Afzelia quanzensis) *Quar (Psydrax obovata) *Quiver-leaf fig (Ficus tremula) *Red-hair bush (Lasiodiscus pervillei subsp. pervillei) *Red-heart tree (Hymenocarida ulmoides) *Saddle-pod (Wrightia natalensis) *Sand cabbage tree (Cussonia arenicola) *Sand canary-berry (Suregada zanzibariensis) *Sand forest gardenia (Hyperacanthus microphyllus) *Sand ivory (Berchemia sp. nov.) *Sand forest hum-num (Carissa tetramera) *Sand knobwood (Zanthoxylon leprieuri) *Sherbet tree (Dialium schlechteri) *Sneezewood (Ptaeroxylon obliquum) *Stink bushwillow (Pteleopsis myrtifolia) *Swazi ordeal tree (Erythrophleum lasianthum) *Tonga-kerrie (Cladostemon kirkii) *Water ironplum (Drypetes arguta) *Wild mandarin (Toddaliopsis bremekampii) *Wild mango (Cordyla africana) *Zulu coshwood (Cola greenwayi) *Zulu loquat (Oxyanthus latifolius) = Hydrology = Sand forests have vegetation gradients that closely coincide with saturation gradients. These saturation gradients are affected by rainfall and topography and, therefore, the vegetation is also affected by these same factors. Vegetation lower to the ground tends to congregate in areas that have been saturated for the longest period of time. Blackwater rivers (e.g. the Rio Negro) commonly begin in these sand forests due to their accumulation of humic matter that is easily washed downstream, particularly after heavy rainfall. = Birds = The majority of bird species found in sand forests is known to prefer sand forest habitat and are found rarely, if at all, in other types of habitats. There have been no studies, however, evaluating the habitat specialization of sand forest birds to determine whether these habitats have unique bird fauna. The majority of these birds are small ground dwellers. They often forage in the underbrush to find food because of the thick organic layers found in the sand forests. Their sharp beaks allow them to break through the thick coating of fruits and obtain the seeds inside.

However, evidence has shown that fires can help increase species diversity, particularly those that are specialized for such areas. For example, fire tolerant species may be more likely to colonize here. Historically speaking, some sand forests may have been the result of anthropogenic burning done by indigenous people. They would burn swaths of sand forest to obtain better hunting and farming grounds. Fires of any kind can have both positive and negative effects on the ecosystem. In some instances, a fire can cause one or just a few species to predominate when the forest begins to regenerate. However, fire can also promote more diversity within the regenerated forest.  Threats  Because sand forests are isolated in small patches, they have been mostly protected from the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. However, they are still at risk of disturbance. Sand forests are extremely sensitive to destruction due to the harsh growth and survival conditions. Since the conditions are so tough to thrive in once an ecosystem declines, it may take hundreds of years for it to develop again. Some sand forests overlap with protected areas and indigenous lands, but most do not. Although they are not immediately threatened, sand forests are still in danger from ever-increasing deforestation, hydroelectric projects, and mineral extractions.  Conservation  Peru has actively incorporated sand forests in three protected areas. Authors who have done research in campinas have also made recommendations for conservation in their work.

It was founded by Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad al-Majjati al- Sanhaji (1537‚Äì1612), a Sanhaja Berber of the Mjjat tribe, a branch of the Ait Idrassen confederation. He was a follower of the famous mystic Muhammad al- Jazuli. The ruins of the town of Dila are situated just south of the city of Khenifra. Under the leadership of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, the brotherhood was able to establish itself in the Berber territory of the Middle Atlas and High Atlas mountain ranges. From 1637 onwards, the brotherhood started with the conquest of large parts of northern Morocco. By 1641, they had conquered Meknes, Fes and the port of Sal√©; from where a rival marabout, al-Ayachi, was expeled, and assassinated on 30 April 1641.

Early life  Oliva was born in Edmonton, north London to a German mother and an Italian father. From early childhood, his mother regularly took him to the English National Opera. He attended The Latymer School, a local mixed grammar school known for musical excellence. Although Oliva had already begun composing at the age of 15, he studied biochemistry (specialising in neurochemistry) at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. After obtaining his degree in 1988, he decided to concentrate on music.  Musical career  After university, in addition to concert works, Oliva began composing music for theatre. During the 1990s, he worked closely with Erica Whyman at Southwark Playhouse, the Gate Theatre and English Touring Theatre. In 1995, he co-founded the Mother Digital Studio in Shoreditch, east London. He began working at the Royal College of Music in 1998, where he is now Area Leader for Electroacoustic Music teaching composition with electronics. Each term, Oliva curates and directs 'From the Soundhouse', public concerts of electroacoustic music (the title is taken from Francis Bacon's New Atlantis). These concerts present new works and rarely heard classics from the electroacoustic repertoire. In 2003, Oliva was a founding member of the contemporary music ensemble rarescale. He continues to work as electronics performer and composer in residence with the group. Between 2004 and 2011, Oliva was lecturer in Music Technology at Imperial College London. He is published by Tetractys. Musical style Oliva‚Äôs music draws on a wide range of inspirations, from Scriabin, Stockhausen, Takemitsu, Brian Eno, Miles Davis to spectralism. He has particular interests in working with microtonal harmony and creating new repertoire for low woodwind, especially the alto flute and bass flute. Since 2003, he has worked closely with the low flute specialist Carla Rees. In opera, his work is notable for its lyrical vocal style. Oliva makes extensive use of video and electronic sound as an integral part of the storytelling, expanding the form though the use of film and television techniques.Chapter 8, Interactive Multimedia Technologies eds.

He resides in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He is also co-owner of the Tulsa Athletics of the National Premier Soccer League. Professional career Dalesandro dropped out of Cascia Hall Preparatory School following his junior year to pursue a career as a professional soccer player. He had been named to the All-Conference team in all three years at Cascia. At 17 he joined the USISL's Tulsa Roughnecks. He had an excellent debut season and was named 1995 USISL \\"Rookie of the Year\\". In the fall of 1996, present day Tulsa Athletics coach Joey Ryan secured Daleasndro a tryout with the Milwaukee Wave. Sonny impressed enough to be taken on as the club's 3rd choice goalkeeper, later becoming the back-up to indoor soccer legend Victor Nogueira.\\"NPSL's Milwaukee Wave Signs Dalesandro\\" Tulsa World ‚Äì Tuesday, February 6, 1997 He regards his tutelage under Nogueira as the most valuable instruction he received in his time as a professional.\\"Former Tulsan Enjoying Pro Soccer Experience\\" The Daily Oklahoman ‚Äì Sunday, February 16, 1997 Dalesandro saw limited time in Milwaukee and was released during training camp the following season due to a broken thumb and the acquisition of former Canadian Olympic team goalkeeper Carmine Isacco. Dalesandro returned to Tulsa and to playing for the Roughnecks in 1999. During the '99 season he was asked to play forward on 5 occasions where the team traveled a light roster. Scoring on three separate occasions against the Houston Hurricanes has earned him the peculiar title of top scoring American on the list of goalscoring goalkeepers.http://soccerstats.us/bios/sonny-dalesandro/ Following the 1999 Outdoor season, friend and former coach Victor Moreland sent Dalesandro to his former club the Wichita Wings for a trial. Dalesandro impressed during the preseason tournament in Cleveland and was subsequently signed to a two-year contract. He was victorious and named \\"man of the match\\" in his first NPSL start against the Kansas City Attack at Kemper Arena October 23, 1999. A respectable 8-8 record subsequently placed Dalesandro 11th in the NPSL \\"Rookie of the year\\" voting. The following season Dalesandro was one of 6 players the Wings protected in the expansion draft. However, when the Edmonton Drillers folded in the beginning of the 2000-2001 season, the acquisition of 3-time All-Star goalkeeper Jim Larkin in the dispersal draft ultimately led to Dalesandro's release. During his time in Wichita, Dalesandro became an ordained minister through Universal Life Church (though he is an atheist) and would bless players shoes with water in the shape of a plus sign said to represent \\"positive energy\\". In 2008 the Tulsa Revolution coaxed Dalesandro out of retirement to captain the upstart AISL franchise. Three games into the season, Dalesandro suffered a broken foot which required surgery. It was quickly revealed that the insurance that was in the players contracts was in fact, non-existent. Dalesandro took the ownership to court and upon their failure to appear, was awarded a default judgment.http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/GetCaseInformation.asp?submitted=true&viewtype;=caseGeneral&casemasterID;=2109883&db;=Tulsa The ownership filed bankruptcy before any compensation was paid.

On April 4, 2013 the Tulsa Athletics were unveiled to the public.http://www.kjrh.com/sports/local-sports/professional-soccer-team-to- move-to-tulsa-play-as-tulsa-athletics The Athletics popularity was instant and after the first year were the 28th best attended soccer franchise in the United States. They were again in the top 35 for attendance in 2014. The team has experienced great on-field success as well, winning their division three times in the five years of their existence and thrice qualifying for the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. Dalesandro lightheartedly claims the role of club chairman, though he takes on any tasks necessary and can religiously be found mowing the game field in the early hours before every home game with a push mower. The team had regular talks with the NASL about moving to the now defunct US second division league.http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/soccer/tulsa-athletics-officials- in-discussions-with-nasl-for-pro- soccer/article_516c8411-c551-5d95-b8d2-7e7f13be80cb.html\\"Tulsa Athletics officials in discussions with NASL for pro soccer status\\" ‚Äì Tulsa World ‚Äì Thursday, May 1, 2014.

Museumplein, the Hilton Amsterdam and Marie Heinekenplein are nearby. History Apollo Hotel, 1981 The Apollo Hotel originates from the bar and restaurant Apollo Pavilion at Apollolaan and the South Amstel Canal, opened in 1934. Both the pavilion and the sports complex next door, the Apollohal, were designed by Albert Boeken. Both are classified as a Rijksmonument, no. 527829. In 1962 the pavilion was expanded to become the 65-room Apollo Hotel, following a design of architect Alexander Bodon. His associate, Jan Henrik Ploeger, was responsible for two later expansions, in 1969 and 1974. In 1995, the Apollo Hotel joined the Le M√©ridien Group, and shared the group's logo at the time. Since 2006 the hotel has been part of Apollo Hotels & Resorts, a subsidiary of European Hotel Management. From 2006 to 2009, the Apollo Hotel was part of a franchise formula, the Golden Tulip brand, and since January 2010 it has belonged to Wyndham Hotels. Features A 1973 gourmet guide stated that the hotel restaurant had a \\"first class French menu and a wine list to match\\". The hotel's 1985 Leisure Center was designed by the architect Cees Dam. The Apollo Pavilion was updated to form the tangerine-hued seafood restaurant, La Sir√®ne, with a wide range of shellfish. The hotel is also served by The Marina Lounge overlooking the canal, which serves cocktails. Room service is offered at the hotel for 12 hours a day, from 11 am to 11pm.

She was reappointed twice by President Reagan. She left the Bureau in 1991 and joined the Urban Institute as a Senior Fellow, a position she held until 1999. She was also appointed as the Chair of the Advisory Council on Unemployment Compensation, first by President George H. W. Bush in 1993 and then re-elected by President Bill Clinton. She stepped down from that position in 1996. She received numerous awards including several honorary doctorate degrees from academic institutions, including Harvard University. Biography Born in Newark, New Jersey, Janet Norwood grew up in Irvington, and graduated from the New Jersey College for Women (now Douglass College) of Rutgers University. She then earned her doctorate at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Having entered the Department of Labor‚Äôs Bureau of Labor Statistics as a part-time junior economist in the early 1970s, she rose to head the agency for thirteen years upon Senatorial-approved four-year appointments, initially by President Jimmy Carter and twice by President Ronald Reagan. She took on management of the agency soon after the Nixon White House ordered the Bureau to cease holding press conferences on the occasion of the monthly release of employment and unemployment data. Immediately following that order, the Congressional Joint Economic Committee decided to restore the public airing of the data by holding public hearings at which it called the Bureau‚Äôs head to testify. Norwood developed a reputation for what the Committee cited, at the time of her retirement from Government service in 1991 and completion of 137 appearances over 13 year before it, her ‚Äúintegrity, professionalism, and impartiality.‚Äù Frequently finding herself as the sole woman at government agency and professional association meetings, she helped bring recognition to female presence and leadership. Among the first group of women to be admitted to the Cosmos Club, in Washington, D.C., she became its first female president in 1995. When often asked, especially by young women, for guidance about career development, she advised them to have a supportive husband. She had married at the end of her sophomore year of college, when her husband was a private in a World War II Army college training program. After she taught a year of political science at Wellesley College, she and her husband moved to Washington, where he entered Government service and became a U.S. Foreign Service Officer. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, they lived in Luxembourg and Brussels, where she and their two children accompanied him on assignment to the U.S. Mission to the European Communities. During both her service as Commissioner of Labor Statistics or following government retirement, she served as head, board member, or senior adviser of professional organizations, including the American Statistical Association, the International Statistical Institute, the Urban Institute, the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago (NORC), the Conference Board, the statistical organization State of the USA Inc. (SOUSA), the Institute of Global Ethics, the Consortium of Social Science Associations, the Committee of National Statistics of the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences (CNSTAT), the Advisory Council on Unemployment Compensation, and served on the corporate boards of Republic National Bank, History Associates, Inc., and MidAtlantic Medical Services, Inc. (MAMSI). After serving as chair of a committee on statistics of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, that OECD group in Paris reappointed her to continue as chair after she had retired from government service and was a private citizen. Also unusually, while BLS Commissioner, she served as a member of a Canadian Government statistical committee. She was awarded Presidential Rank as Distinguished Executive in the U.S. Senior Executive Service (SES). In 2015, she died of Alzheimer's disease.

N.p., n.d. Web. 04 Dec. 2014. .  Biography  Motivated by her desire to study and research traditional music, she traveled and lived in Crete during 2003 and 2004. In 2005, she returned to Thessaloniki, Greece where she studied folklore, traditional vocals and music in depth. She got to grips with religious Byzantine chant with Drossos Kutsokostas. It was also in Thessaloniki, - the Jerusalem of the Balkans for the Sephardim -, where she began to complete her repertoire by exploring more the Western perspective due to her proximity to mainland Spain. Mara Aranda's research and compilation is reflected in the album titled \\"Musiques i Cants Sefardis d‚ÄôOrient i Occident\\" (Sephardic music and song from East and West) with Aman Aman and published by Galileo-mc. The fact that she moved away from her own roots in a geographical sense made her look back at them with a renewed interest. She started to get to grips with traditional song from Valencia \\"Cant d‚Äôestil\\" through the great singer-songwriter Josep Aparicio ‚ÄòApa‚Äô and went on to perform different television series' soundtracks too.  Career  In 1998 she put together the group L‚ÄôHam de Foc along with √âfren L√≥pez; a project with Greek, Turkish, Balkan, Arab, Iranian, and Afghan influence, but with a strong Valencian identity. L‚ÄôHam de Foc went on to become one of the most internationally acclaimed Spanish groups at the time, bringing together a broad fan base from across the musical spectrum. They managed to reach a diverse audience; enthusiastic and loyal to a musical and artistic style that was different, authentic, adventurous, open and far removed from the conventions of folk, rock and pop. It developed into a unique timeless musical concept without trying to follow other trends. Their compositions grabbed the attention of art professionals and the public alike. Three albums were recorded between 1999 and 2006, all critically acclaimed: U, Can√ß√≥ de Dona i Home, and Cor de Porc.http://www.cdroots.com/gal-porc.html For two years on Channel 9 Radio-Si Radio in Valencia, she produced, directed and presented the programme Microkosmos dedicated to early and traditional music. She played the lead in prestigious producer Pyrene's documentary programme Vinoleum dedicated to Caroig Massif, with photography and texts by Manuel Asensi and music by Joan Manuel Serrat and L‚ÄôHam de Foc. In 2007 she embarked on a fascinating journey with Al Andaluz Project and brought together the strength of its three female vocalists: Sigrid House, Iman Kandousi and Mara Aranda. They each represented three different musical heritages of the three cultures in Spain. The fruits of their efforts can be seen in Deus et Diabolus, Al Maraya and Abuab Al- andaluz, and includes a repertoire inspired by Central European, Sephardic and Andalusian cultures. Mara has worked tirelessly and meticulously with such early music groups as Speculum Ensemble directed by Ernesto Schmied; Ensemble Oni Wytars directed by Michael Posh; and Ensemble Unicorn directed by Marco Ambrosini. Her work with Capella de Ministrers deserves special mention, putting together such works as Els Viatges de Tirant lo Blanch, The Cicle of Life and Locked Music: Sefarad: compositions transmitted by oral tradition through the centuries in Turkey, Bulgaria, Morocco and Greece. In February 2013 the much anticipated album \\"Sephardic Legacy\\" sees the light of day, a celebration of the music and song of the Sephardic Jews in the Eastern and Western Mediterranean. Currently working with the group Solatge on a repertoire of traditional music from the historic territories of Aragon, the album Deria has won several awards: Best Folk Album 2009 COM \\"F\\"; Best Folk Album Catalunya Radio programme, Hydrogen; and several weeks in the WCME's prestigious ranking of Best Folk Music Groups in the World.

After they disbanded, Ali embarked on a solo career, and released his debut album Mr. Mean in 2013. Ali released his third album in 2019. Biography Born and raised in Tehran, Iran, Ali Azimi began his interest in music at a young age. Coming from a musical family, he self-learned to play the Piano and studied classical guitar with Bagher Moazen. Azimi got his bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering at University of Tehran and Masters in the United Kingdom in the same field. In his early 30s, after years of work and study in the field of Mechanical Engineering, Ali Azimi set aside his work as an engineer in the UK and began to follow his passion for music. The song \\"33\\" from the album, Mr. Mean and the song Tatilat, from Radio Tehran album are both based on this experience. During the same time, Ali founded his own production company Sakkou, which documented underground Iranian music to help promote his fellow musicians who are unable to freely express their love for music in the Islamic Republic of Iran. After quitting his engineering career Ali Azimi went to Iran and in the year 1388 (2009) and formed the Iranian rock band Radio Tehran. Leading this new band, Ali recorded the album 88. Touching on the issues of the young Iranians, the album gave a fresh sound and perspective within the Iranian alternative music scene.

It is the main facility of F√∏rde Hospital Trust, part of Western Norway Regional Health Authority. It has 1300 employees and serves as a central hospital for Vestland and as a local hospital for Sunnfjord outer parts of Sogn. Proposals for a central hospital for Sogn og Fjordane arose in the late 1960s. The county council opposed the plans, instead wanting a series of small hospitals throughout the county. The decision was overruled by the Parliament in 1971. Construction started in 1976 and the Central Block opened three years later. Operations were at the time provided by Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality. By then a nursing college had also been established in F√∏rde, today part of Sogn og Fjordane University College. The hospital was taken over by the state in 2002 and became part of F√∏rde Hospital Trust. F√∏rde received an ambulance heliport service in 1992, at first based at F√∏rde Airport, Bringeland.

Used exclusively for air ambulance services, it is home to a Eurocopter EC-135P2+ operated by Norsk Luftambulanse (NLA) on contract with the National Air Ambulance Service. The base is owned by F√∏rde Hospital Trust. When the base opened in 1992, the hospital had only a helipad, while the helicopter was based at F√∏rde Airport, Bringeland. The operations were provided by Airlift until 2001, when NLA took over. A base at the hospital opened in 2002. However, it was such located that a final run with an ambulance was needed to bring the patient to the hospital. The current base opened in 2014 and also houses the ambulance service and the medical dispatch center. History A government commission looked into the air ambulance organization in 1982. This resulted in the National Air Ambulance Service being established in 1988, under the auspice of the National Insurance Service.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 15 Through this arrangement, Vestland was covered by helicopter ambulances based at Bergen Heliport, Nyg√•rdstangen and √Ölesund Heliport, Central Hospital.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 16 However, there were local protests several places, stating that certain areas of the country had insufficient coverage. Sogn og Fjordane was one such place. The base at the F√∏rde was therefore one of three bases established between 1991 and 1994.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 22 Airlift was selected as the original operator of helicopters out of F√∏rde, winning a tender with four contesters. In addition to offering the lowest price and high quality, they already operated a helicopter base at F√∏rde Airport, Bringeland. The helicopter was based at the airport. Upon scrambling, it would take off and then land at the helipad at the Central Hospital. There the rescue swimming and anesthesiologist boarded the helicopter.Andersen: 162 A special case for the F√∏rde base was that a mechanic accompanied the helicopter on missions. In 1998 this role was replaced with a pilot.Andersen: 163 Norsk Luftambulanse won the tender to operate F√∏rde from December 2001. However, they were required to drop the extra pilot from 1 January 2004. The split base gave increased response times, sometimes up to ten minutes longer. Therefore, a base was constructed on the facilities of the F√∏rde Central Hospital. The new base opened on 4 November 2002. It had a helipad measuring a diameter of and was able to handle the larger Westland Sea King helicopters. However, it was situated from the emergency department. Patients would therefore have to be transported by ambulance to the ward. The former location consisted of sheds and a plastic hangar. Based on what was characterized as unsatisfactory conditions, work commenced in the late 2000s to build a new base at the hospital. This was designed in such a way that would include the medical dispatch center, host the ambulance service and the ambulance helicopter. The plans were passed by the board of F√∏rde Hospital Trust in May 2012. A major hindrance came in January 2012 when the Directorate for Cultural Heritage listed the Central Block as a representative work for Norwegian hospital architecture of the 1970s. This hindered the establishment of a skywalk between the planned base and the central block, which would allow quick access for acute patients. The directorate stated that the plans would only be permitted if the skywalk was cut off a few meters from the facade, forcing the patients outdoors for the distance. There were also raised issue from the municipality regarding noise pollution. The plans stipulated the base to cost 119 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Architects were Solem Arkitektur and the contractor was √Ösen & √òvrelid. Construction began in December 2012. The cost of construction ended at NOK 166 million. The facility was officially opened on 26 September 2014, although it had been taken into use on 5 September. Facilities The heliport is located centrally within the facilities of F√∏rde Central Hospital, located in the Vie neighborhood of F√∏rde. The base is situated in its own building, a combined hangar, helipad, parking garage and office complex measuring . In addition to housing the helicopter service, it acts as a base for the medical dispatch center and the ambulances. The facility is connected to the hospital's emergency department via a skywalk. The helipad is sufficiently large to support two simultaneous aircraft. The facility is owned by F√∏rde Hospital Trust, part of Western Norway Regional Health Authority. Operations The ambulance helicopters are operated by Norsk Luftambulanse on contract with the National Air Ambulance Service. They have a Eurocopter EC-135P2+ stationed at the heliport. It has room for a crew of three, consisting of a pilot, rescue swimming and an anesthesiologist, as well as two stretchers. Medical staff are provided by F√∏rde Central Hospital. The helicopter flew 610 missions lasting 664 hours in 2013. The 300 Squadron had an average 13 annual landings in the period from 2005 to 2011.

Built c. 1813-15, it is notable as the home of one of Bethel's early doctors and first postmaster, Moses Mason (1789-1866), and for the murals drawn on some of its walls by the itinerant artist (among other professions he engaged) Rufus Porter. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972; it is now owned by the Museums of the Bethel Historical Society, and is open year- round for tours (by appointment only in the colder months). Description The Mason House is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide and one deep, with two interior chimneys. It stands facing the Bethel Green as one of a number of graceful Federal period houses. The house is finished in white clapboards and rests on a granite foundation. A rear leanto addition extends the house to the rear. The main entrance is centered on the front (west- facing) facade; it features sidelight windows and a broad elliptical fanlight, framed by pilasters and topped by a cornice. The interior of house has been modernized, but its principal showcase, murals in the central hall and stairwell, have been preserved, as has some of its woodwork. These were painted, probably c. 1830, by the itinerant artist Rufus Porter, and show harbor and woodland scenes typical of his work. Dr. Moses Mason, for whom the house was built c. 1813, was apprenticed to a local doctor before beginning his practice. He served as Bethel's first postmaster, and as a town selectman, trustee of the Gould Academy, and as a two-term representative in the United States Congress. After his death the house passed to Ada Durrell, a daughter of cousins, who the Masons had raised. Her descendants gave the house to the Museums of the Bethel Historical Society in 1971. The society now maintains the property as a historic house museum, open for regular tours in the summer and by appointment at other times.

It was his directorial debut. Based on the topic of male strippers, the film faced protests before screening. The film was produced on a budget of . It was considered controversial because of the subject matter and initially it faced troubles with the Central Board of Film Certification. The film was released in two versions ‚Äì Hindi and English. It did not receive favourable reviews but proved to be a turning point in actress Mink Brar's career. The film flopped at the box office, and Tijori said that he had \\"alienated the audience with too much sex in the promos\\".  Plot  Jahaan (Kiran Janjani), Aakash (Vikas Sethi) and Jahaan's girlfriend Nikki (Adyasha) are good friends and members of a dance troupe. Jahaan wants to get rich very quickly, while Aakash wants to establish his career as a dancer. Impressed by Jahaan's dancing skills, Sonia (Mink Brar) tells him that he could earn a large sum of money by stripping at shows. The other also joins him on the condition that he will do it only once. The second friend refuses to do another show and both the friends quarrel over this matter. Jahaan continues to perform at strip shows. At one of these shows he meets a middle-aged woman, Sharon (Mita Vashisht), and falls in love with her. When Sharon gets bored of this affair, she breaks it off but Jahaan is unable to recover. He does not behave properly with Nikki and eventually she leaves him.

Production  Oops! was Deepak Tijori directorial debut For the striptease scene, Tijori had told actors Janjani and Sethi that the first portion of that scene would be shot first where they had to remain bare-chest. However, when filming started Tijori decided to shoot the entire scene that very day. On being asked why had he chose debutantes, Tijori relied that \\"no established actor will play a male stripper on screen\\". Janjani was signed before Sethi. Newcomer Adyasha Satpathy was cast for the lead role. The film was released with an A certificate implying that it was to be seen only by adult audience. Reportedly, the lead actors received invitations from nightclubs in Mumbai to perform for them. Rediff.com declared the film a box office flop. The film's strip choreography was done by professional strippers. Tijori got the idea of making a film on male strippers after meeting them. Oops! was simultaneously shot in English.  Reception  In her review for Rediff.com, Seema Pant wrote that Tijori's direction is full of loopholes, some of the dialogues did not make any sense, the sets were worse than the ones used for television. She questioned how was Jahaan able to buy an expensive bike when he was so poor.

He felt that the climax was \\"the weakest link.\\" He complimented Tijori for choosing a bold topic for his first film and praised the choreography, especially that done in the songs and the strip show. He called Janjani and Sethi \\"camera-friendly and a bundle of talent\\" and praised them for their acting in their debut.

Eug√®ne Adrien Ducretet (November 27, 1844 ‚Äì 1915) was a French scientific instrument manufacturer, who performed some of the first experiments on wireless telegraphy (radio communication) in France. His father, Louis Joseph Ducretet, was a Savoy textiles merchant who moved to Paris. He never completed a formal education, leaving primary school at age 15. After several years apprenticed to Paris engineer Paul-Gustav Froment, Ducretet opened his own workshop in 1864 at 21 Rue des Ursulines where with a few employees he manufactured classical physics research, teaching and demonstration apparatus, such as galvanometers, Wimshurst machines, and Crookes tubes. Over time his reputation grew and he became instrument supplier to several large Paris educational and scientific institutions. He was awarded a gold medal for his quality instruments at the 1878 Paris Universal Exposition and from then on his firm was a regular presence at important international expositions, winning another gold at the 1881 International Electricity Exposition in Paris. He was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour in 1885. Ducretet's spark-gap transmitter apparatus. Ducretet's work brought him into close contact with many prominent physicists of his day, from whom he learned a lot. He continued his education, attending courses at the Sorbonne and College de France as a 'auditeur libre'. In 1897, hearing about Guglielmo Marconi's pioneering experiments in wireless telegraphy (radio transmission), he built a transmitter and receiver and began his own experiments, becoming the first person in France to transmit radio waves. In November 1897 he transmitted radio signals 400 meters between his workshop and the Panth√©on, attracting the interest of French President F√©lix Faure. On November 5, 1898 he caused a sensation with a public demonstration of wireless communication in the presence of representatives of the Acad√©mie des Sciences between the third floor of the Eiffel Tower and the Panth√©on 4 km away. In 1897 he wrote to Russian physicist Alexander Stepanovich Popov, who had invented one of the first practical radio receivers but had not developed it, suggesting a collaboration. In 1898 he began to build radiotelegraph equipment using the Popov design. Between 1899 and 1904 he sold some of the first wireless stations to the Russian Navy, but the company was too small to provide the volume Russia needed. With his partner Ernest Roger he invented a type of telegraph key used in wireless telegraphy transmitters. In 1901 he wrote a book on the construction of wireless equipment Ducretet married Amelie Vallat in 1866, and they had three children. When he died he left the company to his son Fernand and partner Ernst Roger. The company was sold to Thomson- Houston in 1931.

Used exclusively for air ambulance services, it is home to a Eurocopter EC-135P2+ operated by Norsk Luftambulanse (NLA) on contract with the National Air Ambulance Service. The base is owned by Stavanger Hospital Trust. When it opened in 1981, it was the second such base in the country. History Sola Air Station, located close to the airport, was one of the four inaugural bases of the 330 Squadron. Since 1973 it has been the home of a detachment of Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopters. When needed, this could also be used for ambulance missions.Duvsete: 355 Norsk Luftambulanse was founded in 1977 as a charitable ambulance helicopter operator.Andersen: 22 The following year it opened its first base, L√∏renskog Heliport, Central Hospital, situated from central Oslo.Andersen: 14 At the time the establishment of a helicopter ambulance service was controversial. In addition to the high operating costs, each base required to have an anesthesiologist on duty at any given time. The Ministry of Social Affairs therefore concluded that establishment of such a service did not constitute effective use of public resources and opposed its establishment. Funding was therefore carried out through donations to NLA.Andersen: 30 Locally in Rogaland there was a mix of positions. Twenty- three municipalities in the counties of Rogaland, Hordaland and Vest-Agder supported the initiative from NLA and awarded funding. Rogaland County Municipality, then the operator of Rogaland Central Hospital, had no objections to the establishment of the base, but were not willing to provide funding. Many physicians at the hospital opposed the establishment. Their main concern was that it would drain human resources which could be better used at the emergency department. To fund the establishment, NLA largely approached private companies and asked for charitable donations.Andersen: 132 The base opened on 4 June 1981 as Stavanger Heliport, Central Hospital,Andersen: 131 originally with a Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm Bo 105 helicopter.Andersen: 29 The funding was taken over by National Air Ambulance Service in 1988. As of 2013 there are several limitations to the base. The Sea Kings can only land in critical situations due to an insufficient safety area. The hospital is working on plans for a future base. This could result in a split solution, where there is a simple helipad next to the emergency department and a base further away. Facilities The heliport is located centrally within the facilities of Stavanger University Hospital. It consists of a combined office and hangar building. There are two helipads, the main one is situated on the roof of the base and is connected, although away, from the emergency department. The second is at street level in front of the hangar. The latter requires an ambulance to freight passengers to the ward. The roof asphalt helipad measures . It is limited to landing weights of . The facility is owned and operated by Stavanger Hospital Trust, part of Western Norway Regional Health Authority. Operations The ambulance helicopters are operated by Norsk Luftambulanse on contract with the National Air Ambulance Service. They have a Eurocopter EC-135P2+ stationed at the heliport. It has room for a crew of three, consisting of a pilot, rescue swimming and an anesthesiologist, as well as two stretchers. Medical staff are provided by Stavanger University Hospital. The helicopter flew 950 missions lasting 604 hours in 2013. The 330 Squadron had an average 101 annual landings in the period from 2005 to 2011.

The event took place on May 3, 2015, in Fukuoka, Fukuoka at Fukuoka Kokusai Center and featured nine matches, three of which were contested for championships. In addition to airing worldwide through NJPW's internet streaming site, NJPW World, the event also aired in Japan as a regular PPV through SKY PerfecTV!'s Sukachan service. It was the twelfth event under the Wrestling Dontaku name. Storylines Wrestling Dontaku 2015 featured nine professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Wrestling Dontaku 2015 was main evented by Shinsuke Nakamura defending the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Hirooki Goto. After failing to win the 2015 New Japan Cup and earn himself an IWGP Heavyweight Championship match, Goto announced he was changing his target to the IWGP Intercontinental Championship. Initially Nakamura did not take Goto's challenge seriously, but this changed on April 5 at Invasion Attack 2015, when he was pinned in a six-man tag team match by Goto, who then publicly challenged him to a title match, which was made official the next day. Goto is a former one-time IWGP Intercontinental Champion and lost the title to Nakamura in July 2012. Before the title match, Goto announced his goal was to first win the IWGP Intercontinental Championship and then unify it with the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Wrestling Dontaku 2015 also featured two more title matches, contested for NJPW's junior heavyweight titles. First, new champions Roppongi Vice (Beretta and Rocky Romero), who won the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship at Invasion Attack 2015, were set to make their first title defense in a three-way match against previous champions The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) and former one-time champions reDRagon (Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly). Meanwhile, Kenny Omega was scheduled to defend the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Alex Shelley. This match was a result of events taking place at Invasion Attack 2015, where, after successfully defending his title against M√°scara Dorada, Omega nominated Shelley as his next challenger. The semi-main event of the show built up the July Dominion 7.5 in Osaka-jo Hall IWGP Heavyweight Championship main event between A.J. Styles and Kazuchika Okada with Styles teaming with his Bullet Club stablemate Yujiro Takahashi to face Okada and his Chaos stablemate Yoshi- Hashi in a tag team match. The previous year at Wrestling Dontaku 2014, Takahashi turned on Chaos and joined Bullet Club by costing Okada the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in a match against Styles. One of the matches at Wrestling Dontaku 2015 pitted three sets of rivals against each other in a six-man tag team match as Kazushi Sakuraba, Tomohiro Ishii and Toru Yano were set to take on Hiroshi Tanahashi, Katsuyori Shibata and Togi Makabe. Sakuraba and Shibata started their feud with each other after Invasion Attack 2015, where Sakuraba submitted his former prot√©g√© in a tag team match, Ishii and Makabe had feuded since the beginning of the year over the NEVER Openweight Championship, which Makabe won from Ishii on both January 4 and April 29, while Yano and Tanahashi had feuded since March's New Japan Cup with Yano scoring multiple upset wins over his rival. Another big match would see Bullet Club's Amber Gallows, Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson face The Kingdom's Maria Kanellis, Matt Taven and Michael Bennett in a six-person intergender tag team match. At Invasion Attack 2015, Taven and Bennett defeated Gallows and Anderson to capture the IWGP Tag Team Championship, largely thanks to a distraction from Bennett's wife Maria Kanellis. The next day, it was announced that Bullet Club would be bringing in Gallows' wife, wrestler Amber Gallows, to take on Taven, Bennett and Kanellis in a rare intergender match. This marked the first NJPW match involving female wrestlers since October 2002. Event Hirooki Goto, holding the IWGP Intercontinental Championship belt he captured in the main event of Wrestling Dontaku 2015 The event started with a ten-bell salute to Ashura Hara. In the first title match of the event, The Young Bucks won the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship for the third time by defeating Roppongi Vice and reDRagon in a three-way match, pinning Beretta to end his and Rocky Romero's title reign in their first defense. In the following match, Kenny Omega successfully defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Alex Shelley. The match featured outside interference from The Young Bucks, who pulled the referee out of the ring as Shelley was about to win and who were then attacked by his tag team partner Kushida. Following his win, Omega announced that he would not be taking part in the upcoming Best of the Super Juniors and would instead next defend his title against the winner of the tournament at Dominion 7.5 in Osaka-jo Hall. Next up was the six-person intergender tag team match between Bullet Club and The Kingdom. Throughout the match, NJPW continued a storyline, where Karl Anderson's infatuation with Maria Kanellis distracted him from the match. In the finish of the match, Anderson went to kiss Kanellis, but got hit with a low blow instead by Kanellis, who then pinned Amber Gallows for the win. After the match, Anderson turned on Kanellis, throwing her into a punch from Doc Gallows, which was followed by the two performing their signature double-team move, Magic Killer, on her, before being chased away from the ring by Bennett and Taven. The seventh match of the event saw Hiroshi Tanahashi, Katsuyori Shibata and Togi Makabe defeat Kazushi Sakuraba, Tomohiro Ishii and Toru Yano. In the finish of the match, Tanahashi used Yano's own tactics against him by grabbing him by his hair and then pinning him to finally pick up a win over his rival. The semi-main event saw Bullet Club's A.J. Styles and Yujiro Takahashi defeat Chaos' Kazuchika Okada and Yoshi-Hashi with Styles pinning Yoshi-Hashi for the win. After the match, Styles and Okada both tried to hit their respective finishing moves, Styles Clash and Rainmaker, on each other, but both managed to avoid them. Okada then posed with Styles' IWGP Heavyweight Championship belt, before handing it back to him. In the main event of the show, Hirooki Goto defeated Shinsuke Nakamura to win the IWGP Intercontinental Championship for the second time. Following the win, Goto reiterated that his goal was to unify the Intercontinental and Heavyweight Championships.

Founded in the 1860s on Victoria Street, the shop moved to the Strand in the following decade, remaining open until 1982. History In 1864, a group of clerks in the General Post Office joined together to buy a half chest of tea. Their first transaction resulted in them saving 9 pence to the pound, and they decided to extend their purchasing to coffee, sugar and other grocery products.The London Encyclopaedia Edited by Ben Weinreb, Page 189 In January 1865, they formed the Post Office Supply Association, a co-operative with forty members. The co-operative was so successful that by April the scheme had been opened up to all civil servants and the name changed to the Civil Service Supply Association. Civil servants could purchase tickets for 2 shillings and sixpence, which would entitle them to purchase goods at the store or from firms associated with the association. Their first premises were on Victoria Street, but by 1877 they had moved to 425 Strand, a building designed by architects Lockwood & Mawson. In 1927, the co-operative was incorporated as a private company, becoming a fully fledged department store and severing its links with the Civil Service. The building was completely rebuilt at this time in the art deco style. The store remained open until 1982 when it was closed following a severe fire.

The disease is caused by the bacterial species Xanthomonas translucens pv. undulosa. The pathogen is found globally, but is a primary problem in the US in the lower mid-south and can reduce yields by up to 40 percent.[6] BLS is primarily seed-borne (the disease is transmitted by seed) and survives in and on the seed, but may also survive in crop residue in the soil in the off-season. During the growing season, the bacteria may transfer from plant to plant by contact, but it is primarily spread by rain, wind and insect contact. The bacteria thrives in moist environments, and produces a cream to yellow bacterial ooze, which, when dry, appears light colored and scale-like, resulting in a streak on the leaves. The invasion of the head of wheat causes bands of necrotic tissue on the awns, which is called Black Chaff.[14] The disease is not easily managed, as there are no pesticides on the market for treatment of the infection. There are some resistant cultivars available, but no seed treatment exists. Some integrated pest management (IPM) techniques may be used to assist with preventing infection although, none will completely prevent the disease.[2]  Host and symptoms  Bacterial leaf streak is a pathogen known to infect and damage wheat varieties. The pathogen has also been known to infect other small grain all cereal crops such as rice, barley and triticale. The strains of the pathogen are named differently according to the species they infect. It is one of the most destructive diseases in rice.[15] Resistant wheat cultivars offer the best protection against yield loss, but little is known about the inheritance of resistance.[12] The disease is most common on wheat and can be found on winter and summer wheat varieties. Leaf streak and lesion symptoms of Bacterial Leaf Streak Symptoms of this pathogen can be seen on the stem, leaves, and glumes. Stem symptoms are not always present, but can be seen as a dark brown to purple discoloration on the stem below the head and above the flag leaf. [14] In the early stages of the disease, translucent water soaked streaks can be seen on the leaves often accompanied by a shiny glaze or clumps of dried bacteria on the leaf surface. [8] These markings turn to brown lesions after just a few days, and may be surrounded by a lime green halo. Lesions can stretch the entire leaf blade. BLS exhibits similar symptoms to those of Septoria nodorum, a common fungal infection. A common sign that will distinguish this pathogen from Septoria nodorum is the lack of spores on the leaves, which appears as tiny black spots on the leaf surface with a Septoria infection. A cream to yellow colored bacterial ooze produced by BLS infected plant parts is also a distinguishing sign of the pathogen.[7] Infected glumes, known as black chaff, are darkened and necrotic. Severe symptoms will result in kernels that are discolored due to black and purple streaks. [9] Plants infected with bacterial leaf streak will exhibit an orange cast from leaf symptoms and suffer yield and quality loss.[14] Black Chaff symptoms shown on wheat plant  Disease cycle  Bacterial leaf streak of wheat is a seed-borne disease and is primarily transported by seed, but can also be transmitted by plant-to-plant contact within its lifecycle. Epidemics are typically observed late in the growing season and in wet environments. Moisture facilitates the release of the pathogen from the inoculated seed, which leads to leaf colonization and invasion of tissue. Bacteria on the moist leaf surface enter through leaf openings, such as the stomata or wounds. Under moderately warm weather conditions (15-30 degrees Celsius) bacteria will begin to release and multiply in the plant parenchyma tissue.[4] The bacteria then inject a number of effector proteins into the plant with a Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS)[5]. The T3SS effectors in Xanthomonas are Transcription Activator-like effectors (TAL effectors). These TAL effectors activate the production of plant genes that are beneficial to bacterial infection.[1] The bacteria spreads and progresses vertically up the plant.[3] The bacterial masses cause elongated streaks along the veins of the plant. Water collection on leaves also leads to the spread of the organism, increasing the number of lesions on leaves. Rain, wind, insects, and plant-to-plant contact may spread the disease in the season and cause reinfection.[4] After the plant is harvested or dies, the bacteria may overwinter in the soil; although, its survival rate is much greater when crop debris is present. However, the bacteria cannot survive on decomposing matter alone and free bacteria cannot survive for more than 14 days in hot dry weather.[7] Bacteria is primarily spread by infected or contaminated seed.[10] In some cases, the bacterial will overwinter on other perennial plants and weeds.[4] Residual bacteria in the soil, debris or other plants may also cause new infection in clean seed.  Environment  The disease can tolerate warm or freezing temperature,[2] but favorable conditions for the disease include wet and humid weather. Irrigated fields provide a favorable environment for the disease.[14] The disease has become quite prevalent in semi-tropical regions, but can found all over the world where wheat is grown.[13] Strong winds that blow soils help contribute to the spread of disease. When the spread is initiated by wind blown soil particles, symptoms will be found most readily towards the edges of the field.[6]  Management of BLS  Bacterial leaf streak of wheat is not easily prevented, but can be controlled with clean seed and resistance. Some foliar products, such as pesticides and antibiotic compounds, have been tested for effectiveness, but have proven to have insignificant outcomes on the bacterial pathogen. Using clean seed, with little infection, has yielded effective results for researchers and producers. The pathogen, being seed-borne, can be controlled with the elimination of contaminated seed, however, clean seed is not always a sure solution. Because the pathogen may still live in the soil, the use of clean seed is only effective if both the soil and seed are free of the pathogen. Currently, there are no successful seed treatments available for producers to apply to wheat seed for the pathogen. Variety resistance is another option for control of the disease. Using cultivars such as Blade, Cromwell, Faller, Howard or Knudson, which are resistant to BLS may reduce the impact of the disease and potentially break the disease cycle. Avoiding susceptible cultivars such as Hat Trick, Kelby, and Samson may also reduce the presence of the disease and reduce the amount of bacterial residue in the soil.[6] Using integrated pest management techniques such as tillage to turn over the soil and bury the infection as well as rotating crops may assist with disease management, but are not a definitive control methods.[9] Depending on conditions, the bacteria may survive for up to 81 months.[4] Because the bacteria is moisture driven, irrigation may also increase the risks of BLS infection.[8]  Importance  Bacterial leaf streak is a major bacterial disease of wheat. Yield losses are normally less than 10%, but can be up to 40%. The loss in yield is due to lower weight of the seed rather than lack of production. Risk of damages due to bacterial leaf streak is variable, but should not be overlooked because there is always a chance of an epidemic. Research is still being done on the pathogen, specifically on finding resistant strains. Farmers should avoid planting susceptible cultivars, and avoid infected seed in order to ensure there will be no infection of the pathogen.[4] This disease can survive in freezing to warm climates, threatening wheat populations throughout the world.

Much of its work is in the development of data standards, especially XML and EDI, for the transmission of insurance information throughout the Canadian P&C; insurance industry. CSIO also promotes the adoption of various technologies within the industry, such as telematics and electronic signature, that promise to enhance efficiencies in the broker distribution channel. For example, as part of its XML standards, CSIO released a telematics data standard in January 2014 to facilitate the process of transferring driving data from an insurance customer's vehicle to an insurance company. CSIO worked together with the US insurance standards organization ACORD on the telematics initiative. Regarding the electronic signature initiative, in the summer of 2014, CSIO developed and published the eSignatures Vendor Dashboard, a resource for insurance brokers to help them research and choose an e-signature software solution. CSIO has campaigned for the adoption of Transport Layer Security (TLS) among brokers and insurers in the Canadian property and casualty industry. In 2014, CSIO released its TLS Chart, showing that over 1,200 member brokerages across Canada use TLS. CSIO has promoted the concept of the paperless office to Canadian brokerages. It developed the eDocs data standard in order to help brokers and insurance companies transition away from the printing and mailing of paper documents. Various companies within the Canadian insurance industry support and have adopted the CSIO eDocs standard to make their workflows more paperless. CSIO works to strengthen market share for the independent insurance agent network in Canada. Its members comprise all the provincial broker associations in Canada, including the Insurance Brokers Association of Ontario (IBAO). History CSIO got its start in 1981 as a not-for profit organization focused on building efficiencies in the Canadian property and casualty insurance market. Its initial focus was in standardizing the many proprietary forms and computer systems being used among brokers and insurance companies for their communications. In 1997, the organization built CSIOnet to transmit data between insurance industry trading partners such as brokers and insurers. This network still serves as the Canadian P&C; insurance industry's primary network for the distribution of EDI insurance policy data. In 1999, CSIO initiated a project to create an online portal based on SEMCI technology, enabling single sign-on for brokers and real-time transactions between brokers and insurers. The portal project was ultimately abandoned in 2006, after the industry spent approximately $15 million on the development effort. In 2012, after brokers in the industry indicated a strong preference for standardized over proprietary technology solutions, CSIO released its XML eDocs data standard to deliver workflow efficiencies for brokers. In June 2017, CSIO announced plans to develop an industry-wide solution to deliver electronic proof of auto insurance to consumers. The solution, called My Proof of Insurance, formally launched in February 2018, available to all members at no additional cost.

It was based in Boston, but covered the movement across the US. The paper included a page that gave messages received by its resident medium, and letters from relatives confirming the authenticity of the messages. It also included articles on spiritualism, book reviews, transcripts of lectures delivered by prominent spiritualists, notices of meetings and letters from readers. History The Banner of Light succeeded The Life, a local newsletter that William Berry had started the year before to publicize the seances of Mrs. Jennie H. (\\"Fanny\\") Conant. It had an eight-page newspaper format, with forty columns, each almost 150 lines long. It was published weekly, with the first issue appearing on 11 April 1857. The Banner of Light was based in Boston apart from a brief period in 1859 when it was published in New York. In 1866 the Banner established a Western Department in Cincinnati to cover the Midwest, although its reports of activity far from Boston was by no means complete. The publisher was Isaac Rich and Luther Colby, and then L. Colby & Company. Subscriptions at first cost $2.00 per year, later $3.00 per year. Editors were Luther Colby (1857‚Äì94), John W. Day (18‚Äì97), Harrison D. Barrett (1897‚Äì1904), J.J. Morse (1904‚Äì05) and Irving F. Symonds (1905‚Äì07). There were many spiritualist journals in the second half of the 19th century, but the Banner of Light was much more widely read than any of the others, with a truly national circulation. However, claims by the Banner of Light to have from 15,000 to 30,000 subscribers were greatly exaggerated. The journal was always financially precarious. The Progressive Thinker of Chicago had overtaken it in number of subscribers by the early 1890s. The last weekly issue in newspaper format was volume 99, number 26, dated 18 August 1906. This issue held an announcement that the journal would now appear monthly, and called for subscriptions. Volume 100, number 1, appeared as a 54-page monthly in January 1907, and proved to be the last issue. Among the more notable serialized books that The Banner published was Cora Wilburn's pioneering Jewish feminist novel, Cosella Wayne (1860). Contents Mrs. Conant of Banner of Light. Her Brother, Charles H. Crowell. The ghostly image of the medium's brother appears behind her in this Albumen print carte de visite. The Banner of Light began as a general literary magazine with some mentions of spiritualism and a page titled The Messenger covering Mrs. Conant's seances. The first issue proclaimed that it had, \\"FORTY COLUMNS OF ATTRACTIVE READING, comprising Capital Original Stories; Off-hand Sketches of Life; Historical Pictures; thrilling Adventures; Home Circle; Ladies' and Childrens' Department; Agricultural Facts, Mechanical Inventions, Art, Science, Wit, Wisdom, the Beauties of Poetry, and a General Summary of Political and Social News.\\" In the third issue the publishers said that due to readers' response the journal would place greater emphasis on spiritualism, with at least two pages covering the movement. From then the Banner of Light was \\"An Exponent of the Spiritual Philosophy of the Nineteenth Century.\\" Banner of Light held free seances in its spirit room three times per week. It advertised: The short messages \\"from the departed to their friends in earth-life\\" received in these seances were published in The Messenger, later The Message Page, of each issue. The Message Department was \\"a page of Spirit-Messages from the departed to their friends in earth-life, given through the mediumship of Mrs. J. H. Conant, providing direct spirit-intercourse between the Mundane and Super- Mundane Worlds.\\" Fanny Conant was the regular medium for the first eighteen years, then Jennie S. Rudd for three years and Mary Theresa Longley for 14 years. The Banner published letters from readers who recognized that communicating spirit was authentic. It did not discuss messages that were not authenticated. The feature was highly successful and was copied by other spiritualist journals. The Banner of Light provides a valuable resource for understanding the history of the spiritualist movement in the US, and counted among its employees or contributors all the main members of this movement. The journal published the sermons of Henry Ward Beecher and other well-known ministers, and essays on spiritualism and reform. There were lengthy book reviews. The journal advertised lectures and debates and had a column that tracked the movements of lecturers and mediums. There were news items on development of spiritualism around the country, and many letters discussing controversies in the movement. The journal avoided criticism of even the most obviously fraudulent mediums, and also failed to oppose the \\"free love\\" or radical spiritualists. The journal also serialized \\"original novelettes of reformatory tendencies,\\" often running several at the same time.

Early life and education Ida Florence McCain was born in Fort Collins, Colorado, on August 27, 1884, to James Milton and Hannah H. Oelrich McCain. She was one of six children, with brothers Robert, Walter, and William Arthur (who later changed his name to Arthur William), and sisters Emma and Edda (who later changed her name to Eda). Her father died when she was 12 and her mother remarried, becoming Hannah King. She attended public school and then at the age of 15 entered Colorado State Agricultural College. After her first year in college, while still undecided as to her future career, she discovered that an architectural course had been introduced and decided to take it. Despite her high marks, she was initially turned down for the course, but she persevered and eventually got in, the only woman to register for the course. Although she never got much more formal training than this and never obtained an architect's license at all, she went on to become an extremely successful San Francisco Bay Area architect and builder. Architectural career McCain moved in 1903 to Los Angeles, where she worked for church architect Lawrence B. Valk for a year. She then took a job as architect in the Lambert & Bartin building company and after a year was made partner. In 1909, she moved to Portland, Oregon, with her mother, her brother Arthur, and her sister Eda. McCain went into business with Arthur and her sister Eda's husband Charles Spencer, both of whom set themselves up as contractors. They founded the firm Spencer-McCain and built houses in the environs of Portland for about five years, of which at least ten still survive, some in the Laurelhurst area. One of McCain's finest buildings, called an East Side landmark in contemporary newspaper stories, was the C.K. Henry House, a large granite-and-wood building designed in a loose Arts and Crafts style, with such features as internal French doors, mahogany paneling, and a covered sleeping porch with flooring of local tile. In 1914, McCain returned briefly to Los Angeles and then transferred permanently to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1915. She became an architect for the real estate developers and builders Stephen A. Born (whose architectural department she ran) and Baldwin & Howell, often designing one- of-a-kind homes for their clients. Baldwin & Howell ran advertisements for their Westwood Park development in the area west of Twin Peaks in San Francisco featuring a photograph of McCain, with the ad copy written in the first person, as if by the \\"expert bungalow designer\\" herself. Local architect Charles F. Strothoff designed some 70% of Westwood Park's 650 bungalows, and McCain designed almost all the rest. By the mid-1920s, she had struck out on her own, buying property and designing large houses in the St. Francis Wood and Monterey Heights areas of the city. She took out ads in city newspapers playing up her expertise in bungalow design and her ability, as a woman, to anticipate the design needs of \\"her who spends more time than anyone else within the home.\\" Altogether, McCain designed several hundred Arts-and-Crafts- inflected and Romantic revival Edwardian bungalows and villas in the Bay Area in the 1910s and 1920s, especially in the middle-class enclaves listed above, plus Lincoln Manor (near Lincoln Park in the Richmond District of San Francisco) and San Mateo Park in San Mateo. At a time when very few women were practicing architects in America, she could be hailed as \\"San Francisco's Woman Builder\\" by one leading developer. The best known of her professional rivals in the Bay Area would have been Julia Morgan and Emily Williams, while over in the East Bay Leola Hall was just getting out of building houses around the time that McCain hit her stride. McCain's bungalows were often somewhat offbeat versions of that staple of informal West Coast living, typified by such features as exposed beams, fireplace inglenooks, pocket doors, big closets, wooden wainscoting, and clinker brick porches. Her two-story villas, for instance in Lincoln Manor, tended to be more formal, elegantly mixing Arts and Crafts details with classical elements and often featuring large dining rooms and open floor plans ideal for entertaining. In 1930, McCain was living with her mother and older sister in a San Francisco apartment building that she owned. After 1937, nothing further of her life is known, and her death date is uncertain.

He was Commander, Northern Naval Area of the Sri Lanka Navy when he was killed from wounds sustained in a land mine explosion that killed 7 other senior military officers including Lieutenant General Denzil Kobbekaduwa in island of Kayts while making preparations for Operation Final Countdown the proposed invasion of the Jaffna Peninsula. Early life Born in Colombo, Jayamaha received his education at St. Joseph's College, Colombo, where he excelled as an athlete. Naval career He joined the navy as a Cadet Officer in the Royal Ceylon Navy in July 1969 in the first batch of the Naval and Maritime Academy in Trincomalee. He was promoted to Midshipmen in July 1970, Acting Sub Lieutenant on 1 January 1972 and followed the Sub Lieutenant Technical Course at INS Venduruthy. He was commissioned as a Sub Lieutenant on 1 July 1973. In 1974 he was promoted to Lieutenant and attended the Navigation & Direction School at INS Venduruthy from 1976 to 1977. In 1982 he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and attended the Joint Services Staff College in Canberra. Thereafter he was promoted to Commander in 1985 and Captain in 1987. In 1988 he was appointed Commander Western Naval Area and went on the serve as Director Personal and Training and Director of Naval Operations. In 1990 he was promoted to the rank of Commodore and was appointed Commander Northern Naval Area on 11 November 1991.

Death In July 1992, General Kobbekaduwa was preparing for a new offensive to recapture the Jaffna peninsula which was under LTTE control, it was code named \\"Operation Final Count Down\\". Since the launching pad for the offensive was the island of Kayts on 7 August, General Kobbekaduwa moved to Karainagar naval base by helicopter with his staff. He spent much of the night planning the upcoming offensive with Brigadier Vijaya Wimalaratne, Jaffna Brigade Commander and Commodore Mohan Jayamaha. Due to concerns of the navy about the staging area it was decided to visit the Araly point the next day. At 8:00 am the group made up of Maj. General Kobbekaduwa, Brigadier Wimalaratne and Commodore Jayamaha along with several other officers headed out on a naval patrol boat towards Jaffna and returned to Kayts pier. On returning the party was met by three Land Rovers, the General, the Brigadier and the Commodore got into the Land Rover UHA 8752 with the rest of the army personal taking vehicle no UHA 8785 and the naval personal taking 5959. From there they set out to Araly Point. Half way the General order that they all use one vehicle as to not to attract fire form LTTE units in the Jaffna peninsula which was only half a kilometer away. They reached Araly Point and had a discussion and headed back when the Land Rover was consumed by an explosion. Major Rupasinghe and Major Induruwa who were 400 yards away from the incident ran to the location to find all but General Kobbekaduwa and Commodore Jayamaha alive.

It was solely used for air ambulance services to Haukeland University Hospital. The heliport was owned and operated by Hordaland County Municipality, with helicopter services provided by Norsk Luftambulanse (NLA). The base opened in 1987 as a temporary facility. It was closed in 2002 and replaced by Bergen Heliport, Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren. History Proposals for a helicopter ambulance in Bergen took form during the 1980s. There were two movements. One was based on private initiative backed by NLA.Andersen: 143 The other was the government. The first commission to look at Bergen in such a capacity was appointed in 1982. It recommended Bergen as a natural site of a base. This led to the establishment of the National Air Ambulance Service from 1 January 1988. Bergen became one of eight cities to receive an air ambulance.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 15 When the Central Block of Haukeland was built during the 1980s, there were originally plans to place a helipad on the roof. However, there was uncertainty if there was sufficient support in the structure and the plans were therefore aborted. Another concern, for both a helipad at the hospital and at a location near Store Lungeg√•rdsvannet, was noise pollution. A suitable location at Haukeland was not established, instead the heliport was located on the \\"Circus lot\\" at Nyg√•rdstangen. NLA was awarded the first contract to operate the helicopters,Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 88 originally with a Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm Bo 105 helicopter.Andersen: 29 The service was taken over by Airlift in 1994. They started the process of considering Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren as a more suitable location. Hordaland County Municipality, then responsible for the hospitals, took over operations of the base in 1996. NLA later won back the operational responsibilities for the helicopters. The original heliport lot was deemed a temporary solution. In 2002 the owner of the lot, Bergen Municipality, signed an option to allow Bergensia Badeland to build a swimming pool at the site. There was a three-month resignation clause in the rental agreement, and Bergen Heath Trust, which had taken over the ownership of the hospital that year, therefore decided that it would need to move the heliport to Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren. Also the new lot was municipal. The moving was complicated by the municipality using time on the planning permissions. The heliport moved from Nyg√•rdstangen to Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren in 2002, although this was also stated to be a temporary solution. The same year the ownership of the hospitals in Hordaland, including the base, was transferred to Bergen Hospital Trust. In July the responsibility for the medical staff on the helicopter was moved from NLA to Haukeland. Locating the heliport at Bergen Airport, Flesland was considered, but disregarded due to its remote location form the hospital. In August the municipality gave the go-ahead for the establishment at Gr√∏nneviks√∏ren. Facilities The heliport was located at the \\"Circus lot\\" on Nyg√•rdstangen. It was a temporary and rudimentary structure. Originally it consisted of a series of camping wagons used as offices and with the crew stationed in a hotel. Later a series of builder's sheds were constructed. It had a single helipad.Arnesen: 141 Operations The position involved patients having to transfer to an ambulance and spent ten minutes in transit to the hospital. Although a disadvantage for helicopter patients, it allowed the anesthesiologist on duty to be on call for emergencies in the vicinity by car. Located only minutes from the city center, this allowed for quick responses to accidents and emergencies downtown.

She won five of her eighteen races in a track career which lasted from July 2000 until November 2002. As a two-year-old she won two of her first four races before recording a 47/1 upset win in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, which led to her being named American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly. In the following year her career was disrupted by illness but she did win the La Troienne Stakes and the Singapore Plate. After competing without success as a four-year-old she was retired from racing and has had some success as a broodmare ‚Äì the dam of two graded black type placed horses and multiple Grade 1 winner West Coast, Eclipse Champion 3 Year Old Male of 2018. Background Caressing is a dark bay or brown mare bred in Kentucky by Brereton C. Jones. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Honour and Glory, a Kentucky- bred stallion whose wins included the Breeders' Futurity Stakes and the Metropolitan Handicap. Honour and Glory was a male-line descendant of the Godolphin Arabian, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who trace their ancestry to the Darley Arabian. Caressing's dam Lovin Touch won four races and finished second in the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes in 1983. Caressing was consigned to the Keeneland sale as a yearling in 1999 and bought for $180,000 by the bloodstock agent Mike Ryan on behalf of Carl Pollard. She was sent into training with the Churchill Downs-based veteran trainer David R. Vance who described the \\"smallish\\" filly as \\"a little on the ornery side. She's fairly easy to train, but don't make her do something she doesn't want to do\\". Vance had sent out the winners of over a thousand races in a 34-year training career and was based in Barn 48 on the Churchill Downs backstretch. The overwhelming majority of his wins had come in claiming races, but he had enjoyed some top-level success in the 1970s with Honky Star, a racemare who won the Monmouth Oaks and the Cotillion Handicap. Racing career =2000: two-year-old season= Caressing made her track debut in a maiden race over five and a half furlongs at Churchill Downs on July 2 and finished fourth of the eleven runners behind Madam Full Charge. In August she started at odds of 2.2/1 in a similar event at Ellis Park Race Course. Ridden as in her previous start by Greta Kuntzweiler, she took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and won by a length from Selassie. Her next race was the six furlong Bassinet Stakes at River Downs on September 2. Starting at odds of 3.5/1, she took the lead on the final turn and drew away from her rivals in the straight to win by seven lengths. On September 30 Caressing was moved up in class and distance for the Arlington-Washington Lassie Stakes over one mile at Arlington Park. She tracked the wire-to-wire winner Thunder Bertie throughout the race without ever looking likely to win and finished second, beaten two and three quarter lengths. John Velazquez took over the ride from the injured Kuntzweiler when Caressing contested the seventeenth edition of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, run that year at Churchill Downs on November 4. Before the race Vance commented \\"She deserves to get into the race\\", he said at the time. \\"We're taking a shot, but so are a lot of other people. Nobody is scared of anyone in this race. She knows the track at Churchill. She works well over it, and it's her home base.\\" Raging Fever (winner of the Matron Stakes and the Frizette Stakes) started favorite ahead of Cindy's Hero (Del Mar Debutante Stakes) and Notable Career (Oak Leaf Stakes) with Caressing starting the 47/1 outsider of the fourteen runners field. Caressing raced in fifth place on the inside rail as Thunder Bertie set the pace before switching to the outside on the final turn. She took the lead a furlong from the finish and held off a late challenge from Platinum Tiara to win by half a length. After the race Velazquez commented \\"She gave me the best she's got. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect trip\\". =2001: three-year-old season= Caressing was expected to begin her second season at Oaklawn Park but contracted a fever when being prepared for the Honeybee Stakes. The filly was sent to the Hagyard-Davidson- McGeee clinic near Lexington, Kentucky where she reportedly responded well to treatment. She made her belated three-year-old debut in the Grade III La Troienne Stakes over seven furlongs at Churchill Downs on May 3. Ridden by Pat Day, she started slowly and was repeatedly blocked and hampered in the early stages, but after being switched to the wide outside on the final turn she finished strongly to take the lead inside the final furlong and won by a length from Sweet Nanette. The filly was unplaced in her next two starts, finishing fifth behind Forest Secrets in the Acorn Stakes at Belmont Park in June, and seventh to Zonk when starting favorite for the Delaware Oaks in July. On August 11 Caressing, ridden by Ren√© Douglas started favourite for the Grade III Singapore Plate (better known as the Arlington Oaks) over nine furlongs at Arlington Park. She tracked the leaders before taking the lead in the straight and winning by a length from Gal On The Go. After the race, Douglas commented \\"She was very focused. [Vance] told me to try and keep her on the outside, but when I took her inside at one point she didn't hesitate at all.\\" Caressing failed to win in four subsequent races in 2001. She finished sixth behind Exogenous in the Gazelle Handicap at Belmont in September and third to Scoop in the Indiana Oaks at Hoosier Park in October. In November she ran fourth to Nasty Storm in the Churchill Downs Distaff and sixth to Forest Secrets when starting a 29/1 outsider for the Falls City Handicap. =2002: four-year-old season= Caressing remained in training as a four-year-old, but failed to recover her best form. She began the year at Oaklawn Park where she finished fourth of the five runners in the Oaklawn Breeders' Cup Stakes and third when second favorite for the Listed Bayakoa Stakes. She was then covered by the stallion Fusaichi Pegasus and was found to be in foal (pregnant) but nevertheless resumed her racing career. She finished third in the Chicago Handicap in June before running second in the Iowa Distaff Stakes at Prairie Meadows a month later. She ended her racing career at Ellis Park Race Course on August 10, where she finished fourth behind Minister's Baby in the Grade III Gardenia Handicap. Assessment and awards In the Eclipse Awards for 2000, Caressing was named American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly.

Poblacion, Pulilan, Bulacan, Philippines. The parish church, dedicated to Saint Isidore, the Laborer, is under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Malolos. The church is popular for being the site where water buffalos are made to kneel as tribute to the feast day of the patron saint. Like the Saint Augustine Parish from the nearby town of Baliuag, the church is also known for featuring one of the longest Holy Week Processions with at least 110 floats. History Pulilan, known before as barrio San Isidro or Buenavista, is a former barrio and parochial catchment of Quingua before it separated into a town with its own parish. Several sources provide varied claims as to the beginnings of the town and parish. One of such sources tells that the town was founded in 1749 under the advocation of San Isidro and was subsequently named Pulilan in 1850 by Father Ignacio Manzanares of Hagonoy in 1871. Likewise, Father Simon Barroso called the town San Isidro de Pulilan in 1873. The parish of Pulilan was declared as independent some time in 1780 to 1785 according to Father Martinez de Zu√±iga, although it was not indicated in the report to the Augustinian Province in the Philippines in 1760. Architecture Parochial structures of light materials were said to have been built immediately after the erection of the parish. In 1826, Father Juan Rico started the construction of a new church. One record tells that the church is still under construction in 1829 as it says all churches in Bulacan are already made of masonry except for the church of Pulilan which was still under construction. Two earthquakes, on June 3, 1863 and 1880, damaged the church greatly. Father Miguel de Celis rebuilt the church a few years later. The fa√ßade of the church is predominantly neo-classical and is devoid of heavily detailed ornamentation. Rectangular pilasters divide the fa√ßade into three vertical sections capped off by a triangular pediment. The fa√ßade is punctured by rectangular openings: three rectangular windows and one canopied rectangular main portal. Only the Augustinian emblem on the pediment, motifs on the cornice and the balustrade on the belfry break the monotony of design. The plastered fa√ßade contrasts greatly with the bare stone walls on the side and interior of the church. To the right of the church is the three-tiered bell tower, with the top level done in concrete. Pulilan Carabao Festival During the 14th and 15 May every year, Pulilan holds the Kneeling Carabao Festival as tribute to their patron saint. Farm animals especially carabaos or water buffalos are paraded in front of the church. The highlight of the fiesta is the genuflection or kneeling of the carabaos with its two front legs in front of the church as sign of reverence to Saint Isidore.

Through the leadership of Mary Smith and Elizabeth Brooks and with the support of student groups and civil rights activists, the strike was organized around a list of demands to improve the working conditions of black food workers. The protesting employees of Lenoir Hall presented this list to University Chancellor J. Carlyle Sitterson, who responded by asserting his commitment \\"to be[ing] responsive to the educational needs of . . . all races, colors, and creeds\\" but also his inability to treat any group with preference and to make significant changes on their behalf.\\"The BSM's 23 Demands: December 1968\\". The Carolina Story. University of North Carolina. He directed a police response to campus disruptions with North Carolina Governor Robert W. Scott, further instigating the protesters and drawing widespread attention to the issue. The subsequent formation of the UNC Non-Academic Employees Union prompted Governor Scott to negotiate with and ultimately accept the terms of the protesters on March 21, 1969. UNC facility employees experienced an increase in wage and working conditions, and this lasted until food management transferred from internal to contractual service provided by SAGA Food Service less than a month later. The change in employers sparked workers, many of whom participated in the first strike, to voice their discontent once again. Employees and students responded immediately, with the strike resuming, among other forms of protest, until its conclusion on December 9, 1969, when black supporters threatened to descend on the campus to elevate the issue if union negotiations did not begin.Cafeteria workers strike at UNC. (1969, Nov 15). Afro-American (1893-1988) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/532230249 Instigated by perceived oppressive employment conditions and fueled by the spirit of the ongoing Civil Rights Movement, the Food Workers Strike brought attention to many issues in Chapel Hill and the American South as well as on college campuses throughout the country. These included the stalling status of desegregation, the assimilation of the fight for civil equality into part of the 1960s Counterculture Movement and the New Left, the shift towards more confrontational forms of protest for civil demonstrations and the rights of public employees to unionize and protest perceived injustice. The strike serves as a model for a successful, largely nonviolent protest against institutionalized injustice and is remembered today as a significant milestone for workers' rights and racial equality in University and North Carolina history. Causes and background The progress of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill during the 1960s mirrored many other Universities in the South undergoing integration. Despite a non-academic employee work force composed almost entirely of African-Americans, black presence in the student body lagged behind significantly, reaching nearly 1.5% in 1968, and only one black professor taught on campus. While academic, admission and employment equality were the official University of North Carolina System policies following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the experience of food workers on campus proved otherwise.Williams, J. Derek. \\"It Wasn't Slavery Time Anymore\\": The Foodworkers' Strike at Chapel Hill, Spring 1969. M.A. thesis, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 1979. Employee complaints included receiving below-minimum wage, compulsory time spent on campus without pay, split shifts and working under white supervisors who harbored discriminatory attitudes, among others.Oral History Interview with Daniel H. Pollitt, March 21‚Äì22, 1991. Interview L-0064-6. Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) in the Southern Oral History Program Collection, Southern Historical Collection, Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. As similar events, such as the Allen Building Takeover at Duke University, demonstrated, desegregation existed only nominally, but according to many African Americans, discrimination still flourished. Despite formally organizing and proposing responses to what they perceived were the problems of their employment, the food workers' requests received little to no response from the University's Administration, while simultaneous layoffs further provoked employees to escalate the issue.\\"UNC food service changes with the times\\" The Daily Tar Heel, April 29, 1982. The strike and student involvement in protests Two staff members, Mary Smith and Elizabeth Brooks, emerged as the employees' leaders, and a formal protest was organized. On February 23, 1969, as Lenoir Hall opened for business, workers led by Smith vacated their posts in the Cafeteria and sat at the tables, refusing to yield to requests from their supervisors to resume their jobs. The following day, around 100 employees were absent from their jobs, and despite being urged to begin private negotiations with the University, the strike continued. Throughout the remainder of February, cafeteria workers organized rallies and speaker events on and off campus to maintain the strike's momentum and garner public support. Invoking a slogan of \\"It isn't slavery time anymore!\\", Mary Smith successfully coordinated public demonstrations and the reception to the protests resulting in increasing support from other workers and community members.\\"Women Behind the Lines.\\" University of North Carolina Library. Accessed November 16, 2014. https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/indexablecontent/uuid:343f9155-29c8-440c-97ed-361e36b01581. As students began to experience the effects of the strike and witness the plight of its participants, many joined the food workers to add to the collective voice bargaining with the University. The Black Student Movement, which was composed largely of former NAACP members after the UNC-CH Chapter of the national organization was closed, supported the food workers. Seizing the opportunity to expand the strike into a larger movement for racial equality, the BSM rallied with the food workers and issued an expanded list of demands that included the establishment of an African-American Studies department and the expansion of black aid programs. Another group to join the movement was the Campus Y student organization, which states its goal as \\"the pursuit of social justice through promoting pluralism.\\" \\"About the Campus Y.\\" Campus Y at UNC. http://campus-y.unc.edu/about. Kay Goldstein, who was an undergraduate at Chapel Hill from 1967-1972, described Campus Y as the heart of social movements on campus and a place where interested people gathered during the strike and other protests to brainstorm protests and fundraising activities. After weeks of little to no progress, roused students took it upon themselves to expand the protests, and on Tuesday, March 4, 1969, fights and rioting erupted; students overturned tables and vandalized Lenoir Hall, forcing its closure.Eamon, Tom. The Making of a Southern Democracy: North Carolina Politics. University of North Carolina Press, 2014. 125. By appealing to students who already opposed the conservative establishment that they felt dominated politics and education, the protestors earned the support of a passionate and vocal group whose voice could not go unanswered by the Administration. Expansion of the strike and police response Following the escalation of the protest, Governor Scott ordered the positioning of the National Guard and of riot-police in Chapel Hill to ensure the safe reopening of Lenoir Hall by Thursday, March 6. The escalation and subsequent mobilization of police splintered the University community, prompting students, faculty, staff and administrators to side with either the protestors or the Administration. Because of the degree of student involvement, University leadership viewed the strike as a form of student disruption, and Governor Scott ordered the arrest of students who refused to vacate Manning Hall, the protestors' headquarters. The involvement of police following the violence embodied a radicalization of the strike, bringing activists and their opposition to direct public confrontation. This was an important step as desegregation had reached a plateau: legally, most public forms of discrimination had been outlawed, but many felt the experience of minority individuals had hardly improved.Williamson, Joel. Crucible of Race: Black- White Relations in the American South Since Emancipation. New York: Oxford University Press, 1984. =Counterculture and the New Left= The food workers' cause was quick to gain support among students and other members of the University community. Many of these individuals were of different races and socioeconomic status, but they were unified in common opposition, not experience. Concurrent to the Civil Rights Movement was the American Counterculture Movement of the 1960s and 1970s that emerged on college campuses throughout the country. Stemming from opposition to the Vietnam War and conscription, strict criminal policies toward drug use as part of the War on Drugs, and sexual repression, among others, the Counterculture Movement easily incorporated the civil rights battle as yet another source of discontent. During the 1960s, popular issues of the time began to transcend race towards greater criticisms of American society: this transition allowed for common experience and partnership between people of all races with shared opposition. Student groups comprised the academic branch of the New Left, and by the 1970s, the fight for civil equality became a fundamental aspect of the Counterculture's anti-establishment revolution. High-profile demonstrations at campuses including the University of California, Berkeley and Columbia University emphasized civil rights and the challenging of authority at the forefront of their cause, and this sentiment echoed at UNC-CH. The argument against accelerating the process of desegregation became one of conservative, apathetic politicians and academic administrators, positioned against the momentous wave of social liberalism. Response to the strike In addition to raising questions regarding the status of race on college campuses, the Food Worker Strike also brought attention to the rights of public employees to strike. As employees of the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, the striking food workers violated the terms of their employment which prohibited the disruption of University functions because of contractual complaints. From the workers' perspective, they were being subjected to exploitative working conditions because of their race and wage bracket, and for this reason, the strike was necessary as a means of restoring human dignity.\\"Women Behind the Lines.\\" University of North Carolina Library. Accessed November 16, 2014. https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/indexablecontent/uuid:343f9155-29c8-440c-97ed-361e36b01581 While it did not result in national attention, the Lenoir Strike proved a controversial instance in which the state government was forced to draw the line between maintaining order at public institutions and protecting human rights under the law. =Unionization= After the initial negotiations to end the strike stalemated, the protestors decided that unionizing was the best way to continue, and they formed the UNC Non-Academic Employees Union.Link, William A. William Friday Power, Purpose, and American Higher Education. Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1995. 438-440. By engaging in collective bargaining, the State government effectively condoned the right for public employees to unionize and strike as long as it did not create a serious interruption of public services. This right would not be challenged again on a national level until the Air Traffic Controller Strike under the Reagan Administration. In addition, it allowed university employee unions to seek the support of students and faculty, both as members of their protests and for financial support. School and State administrators identified the newly formed union as the official voice of the strike, and the body with which further negotiations would be conducted.\\"I Raised My Hand to Volunteer.\\" Exhibit, from The University of North Carolina Library, , Accessed November 16, 2014, http://exhibits.lib.unc.edu/exhibits/show/protest/foodworker-essay Resumption and resolution of the strike In the months following the resolution to the Lenoir Strike, the government implemented statewide changes in accordance with the worker's collective demands. Among these, a minimum wage increase to $1.80 for public University employees was implemented, affecting around 5000 individuals, in addition to the hiring of black supervisors and additional overtime pay. Because of the impact of the strike and the critical attention brought to the University, administrators chose to contract the management of campus food to SAGA Food Services on May 19. While not initially a source of concern, the change in employer marked a return to the initial working conditions that sparked the strike. A large number of employees were laid off and soon after, the working conditions of those who remained once again deteriorated. In an interview, Elizabeth Brook explains that under SAGA management, Lenoir employees were strictly prohibited from talking with students to prevent unrest; however, general dissatisfaction with the terms of the food worker's employment was still well known.Oral History Interview with Elizabeth Brooks, October 2, 1974. Interview E-0058. Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) in the Southern Oral History Program Collection, Southern Historical Collection, Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. On November 7, around 250 workers resumed the strike, and in the following months, much more active forms of protest were used to garner a public response from SAGA. Student groups convened forums to address the issues from their perspectives, and speakers and civil rights leaders were invited to Chapel Hill to bring attention to the ongoing Strike. After nearly a month of striking, police arrested nine members of the Black Student Movement, some of whom helped coordinate the food workers' unionization, and charged them failure to disperse and disorderly conduct. Reverend Ralph Abernathy joined the protest on December 6 to show his solidarity with the workers and to pledge \\"his spiritual, moral and financial support if not [his] physical presence.\\"\\"Abernathy Stresses Soul Power.\\" Black Ink, December 1, 1969. In this second round of protest, the public support of leaders and outspoken youth allowed for a quicker resolution when negotiations stalled. Mary Smith organized an event that she named \\"Black Monday\\", a day in which thousand of supporters of the food workers agreed to descend upon the campus to force an end to the stalemate.\\"Abernathy Meets Sitterson, Lee on Strike.\\" The Daily Tar Heel, December 7, 1969. The strike came to a final end on December 9, 1969, one day after the proposed \\"Black Monday\\", and although lesser contractual disputes continued to arise over the coming years, many of the employee demands were accepted and enacted in the following five years.\\"The BSM's 23 Demands: December 1968\\".

The hashtag was started by writer and domestic abuse survivor Beverly Gooden via Twitter in an effort to \\"change the tone of the conversation.\\" It began to trend nationally five hours after its creation and was used more than 46,000 times that day, according to the Web analytics tool, Topsy. #WhyILeft was a later addition to the Twitter conversation.  Background  Beverly Gooden's rationale for staying with her husband was that it was step one in her move to eventually leave her abusive relationship; Janay Rice, on the other hand, expressed that she has no intention of divorcing her now-husband and does not view herself as an abuse victim. In the wake of media attention after the release of the tape, Janay came out in support of Ray on Instagram, writing, \\"To make us relive a moment in our lives that we regret every day is a horrible thing.\\" Beyond the pull to stay together for the sake of their daughter, Rayven, Janay argued that the violent night in Atlantic City was an anomaly in their relationship. In an interview with ESPN, she said, \\"As angry as I was, I knew it was something that we could move on from because I know Ray.\\" She added that the violence was not one- sided; Janay was the one to initiate it, slapping Ray before he assaulted her. She stressed that she hopes people can see the love that the two have for one another despite one isolated incident, and how much they have grown because of it. On November 8, 2014, creator Beverly Gooden posted the following message to her website to elaborate on her inspiration for #WhyIStayed: \\"The internet exploded with questions about [Janay Rice] ‚Ä¶ why didn't she leave? Why did she marry him? Why did she stay? I can't speak for Janay Rice, but I can speak for Beverly Gooden. Why did I stay? ‚Ä¶ Leaving was a process, not an event. And sometimes it takes a while to navigate through the process. I believe in storytelling. I believe in the power of shared experience. I believe that we find strength in community. That is why I created this hashtag. I hope those tweeting using #WhyIStayed find a voice, find love, find compassion, and find hope.\\" Stories of why victims stayed varied from feeling unable to leave out of fear to not knowing that abuse was abnormal. Victims left because they realized their lives were in jeopardy, they started to believe they deserved better, and/or they wanted to protect their children.  Response  In response to #WhyIStayed/#WhyIleft, Janay said she was thankful that her experience with domestic violence instigated the movement. Despite the difficulty of enduring the scrutiny that comes from the publicization of a private moment, Janay said that the fact that it began a conversation about abuse was a silver lining. The hashtag gained significant attention from national media, as well as from the National Domestic Violence Hotline via Twitter. The organization thanked all who were sharing their stories with #WhyIStayed and informed users about their services.  Misuse of the hashtag  After #WhyIStayed became a trending topic on Twitter, it was mistakenly used by the DiGiorno's Pizza Twitter handle as a marketing effort. They tweeted, \\"#WhyIStayed You had pizza.\\" The administrator for the account later removed the tweet and apologized for the mistake, claiming that no one had looked into the implication of the trending hashtag before taking to Twitter. While many Twitter users brushed over the error, others were deeply angered as they believed DiGiorno was making light of an incredibly serious topic. In response, DiGiorno answered every negative tweet with personal messages conveying their apologies. DiGiorno has since removed the original tweet‚Äîbut not before screenshots were taken to verify the event.

In 1891-1892 at the Palermo exposition his genre painting Hush! won an award. In 1897, he exhibited the Madonnina and Toward the Light in Venice.History of Modern Italian Art, by Ashton Rollins Willard (1902), page 644-645. Ferruzzi died on 16 February 1934 in Venice and was buried in the small cemetery of Luvigliano in his family's plot, near his wife Ester Sorgato and his daughter Mariska.

The Bolivarian countries are six Hispanic American countries (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru and Venezuela) whose republican origin is attributed to the ideals of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and independence war led by the Venezuelan military in the viceroyalties of New Granada and Peru. Although Bolivar had nothing to do with Independence of Panama from Spain, let alone the emergence of Panama as an autonomous and independent republic (1903), this country is considered Bolivarian as it proclaimed its independence in 1821. Panamanian patriots voluntarily joined the old provinces of Veraguas and Panama into Gran Colombia and once it dissolved in 1830, the territory remained part of Colombia until 1903. In addition, Bol√≠var chose Panama to host the Amphictyonic Congress. Meanwhile, in 1824 Bol√≠var consolidated, with the battles of Jun√≠n and Ayacucho, the Independence of Peru, which had been initiated by Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, who in 1821 had declared independence and established the Republic of Peru. The links between these countries have come through economic alliances and international treaties such as the Andean Community, which since 1939 brought together those countries except Panama and to which belonged Chile and Venezuela. Similarly, there are cultural and sporting organizations such as Bolivarian Sports Organization, that since 1938, have organized the Bolivarian Games every four years.XV Juegos Bolivarianos History Faithful to his ideals of American unity, with much effort executed Bol√≠var integration into a single republic, of Colombia (known historiographically as Gran Colombia) with a unitary model, three former entities of Spanish rule, formed by the Viceroyalty of New Granada (currently Colombia and Panama), the Captaincy General of Venezuela (Venezuela) and the Quito (Ecuador), led by Colonel Jos√© de Fabrega to then, On the other hand, the Independence of Panama from Spain was certainly an act of another movement of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. The isthmus of Panama proclaimed its independence on November 28, 1821 and voluntarily joined the Gran Colombia, due to the sympathy of the Isthmian leadership to the ideals of Bol√≠var. With respect to Peru, in 1824, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var achieved military victories in the battles of Jun√≠n (August 6) and Ayacucho (December 9) to the royalist troops who dominated the viceroyalty obtaining the signature of the Spanish capitulation recognized the Peruvian independence, emancipatory action initiated in 1821 by Jos√© de San Mart√≠n who declared independence and established the Republic of Peru. As for Bolivia, from 1809, the secessionist struggle against Spain began, which lasted until 1825. Marshall Sucre sent Bol√≠var called a Congress which declared absolute independence of that country, gave the name \\"Bol√≠var Republic\\", named Sim√≥n Bol√≠var \\"Liberator\\" and gave the supreme political power (position rejected). Published in the Gaceta de Colombia, number 215 of November 27, 1825. In 1830, the secession of the member nations of the Gran Colombia began, when the Bolivarian dream of the American union, declined as did his life. After Venezuela and Ecuador decided to secede, Panama made the same decision on September 26, 1830. This situation continued until December 11 of that year, when under a gesture of Bolivar, it rejoined the Gran Colombia. Sim√≥n Bol√≠var died on December 17. After the dissolution of the union, Panama was part of the Republic of Colombia until its final separation on November 3, 1903. This was caused by Colombia's rejection of Hay‚ÄìHerr√°n Treaty, the crisis of Panama following the Thousand Days' War and strategic intervention United States on isthmus. Also in that country, Bol√≠var specified about the Amphictyonic Congress, which in 1826 he sought to create a confederation of American countries in defense of the continent against the League of the Holy Alliance, by forming an army of 60,000 soldiers with proportional quotas to defend themselves from Spain.

The result of the summit was that Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic were invited to join NATO. Fellow Visegr√°d Group member Slovakia was excluded from this invitation. Slovakia had held a referendum on NATO membership in May 1997, but turnout in the referendum failed to achieve the required 50% of eligible voters and government sabotage was blamed, which in turn was viewed as one of a string of undemocratic measures taken by Prime Minister Vladim√≠r Meƒçiar. A majority of NATO members reportedly supported France's proposal to also immediately invite Romania and Slovenia as members, but this was strongly opposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton, and even a \\"iron-clad guarantee\\" that they could be invited in two years time was watered-down in favor of an \\"open door\\" policy for new potential members. A main concern for the United States was the cost of potentially raising the military standards of the new Eastern European members. Estimates put this cost at as much as US$10 billion, which participants worried could lead to the treaty recognizing the new members being rejected by the Republican-held U.S. Senate.

It is noteworthy as a depiction of Welsh piety, the traditional Welsh national costume, and for a contentious belief that the devil is depicted within it. Mass reproductions throughout the early and mid 20th century ensured the image became famous throughout Britain. The painting has been described as an icon of Wales, much as The Hay Wain is iconic of England. History Vosper had found success as a watercolour painter before coming to Wales; he had exhibited work in galleries throughout England, and at the Paris Salon and the Royal Academy in London. He was noted for his paintings of people, particularly the people of Le Faou√´t in Brittany. Vosper's Welsh paintings began with his marriage to Constance James of Merthyr Tydfil in 1902, and ended after her death in 1910. Vosper first saw the chapel in 1906, not long after the \\"Welsh Revival\\". He had already painted many famous images of prayer and piety in Brittany, and it would seem the chapel and its congregation inspired him in much the same way. Composition Only one of the figures was actually a member of the chapel, Robert Williams of Caer Meddyg, a carpenter, farmer and deacon at Capel Salem, he can be seen on the far left beneath the clock. Next to him, and slightly obscured is Laura Williams of Ty'n-y-Buarth, Llanfair. Left of her, with his back against the wall is Owen Jones (commonly called Owen Si√¥n) of Carleg Coch. The small boy is Evan Edward Lloyd and by his side is Mary Rowland. On the extreme right with his head bowed, is William Jones (William Si√¥n), brother of Owen. Vosper paid each model 6d. (2.5p) an hour for sitting. The main figure is Si√¢n Owen (born in Maesygarnedd in 1837), at the time of painting she was 71 and lived in Ty'n y Fawnog on the backroads from Llanbedr. She was a widow having lost her husband George in the 1880s. They had one son (William) and Si√¢n raised both William's sons in her tiny cottage, both her grandsons were killed in the First World War. Si√¢n Owen herself lived on until 1927, and is buried in Llanfair churchyard, Harlech. The eighth figure (second right of Si√¢n Owen, wearing a Welsh hat) was actually a borrowed tailor's dummy which Vosper named \\"Leusa Jones\\". The chapel elders, uncomfortable with the dummy in a place of worship, insisted the dummy was to be removed each Saturday night before the \\"seiat\\" (weekly church meeting) the following morning. Why Vosper chose Si√¢n as the main figure is unclear, though there is a Welsh cultural image of a strong maternal figure considered iconic to 19th century Welsh family life (Mam Cymru). Si√¢n Owen would have had to stand for days wearing the shawl so that Vosper could paint its intricate detail and folds, Vosper later complained that she twitched and moved so much that it became very difficult to accurately reproduce the pattern and colour of the shawl and he eventually gave up, pinning the shawl to the dummy for the final stages. Despite this difficulty, he would again work with Si√¢n Owen in Market Day in Old Wales (1910). The Welsh hat was a fashion which was current in the 1830s and 1840s. By the time of painting the hats were no longer worn by women in Wales, and the wearing of hats inside a chapel would have been considered a faux pas, especially for women. Vosper, however, wanted the women to wear traditional tall stove pipe hats but could find only one remaining hat in the area. Vosper had the hat shared amongst the models, painting the same hat into the composition four times. Si√¢n Owen's ostentatious shawl was likewise uncommon and was borrowed from the wife of the vicar of Harlech. Market Day in Old Wales (1910) a later Vosper painting also featuring Si√¢n Owen Mass appeal Vosper exhibited 'Salem' in 1909 at the Royal Academy in London where it came to the attention of the industrialist William Hesketh Lever. Lever bought the painting for ¬£105 and the original can be seen today in the art gallery he established at Port Sunlight. The painting may have remained obscure in his private collection had Lever not decided to use the painting in a promotion of the Lever Brothers' popular product Sunlight soap. The soap bars came with collectable tokens, and buying seven pounds of soap would acquire enough tokens to exchange for a print of the painting (an early example of marketing premiums). This promotion resulted in Salem appearing in many homes across Britain. At that time many homes owned no form of visual art and the innovative 'free gift' offer ensured prints of Salem became widely, and uniquely popular amongst working class communities, especially in Wales. By 1933 the painting was famous enough to be the subject of a notable article in the Welsh language magazine Y Ford Gron (The Round Table) and by 1937, Salem gained yet more popularity when Sir Ifan ab Owen Edwards sold thousands of prints to supporters of the Urdd Gobaith Cymru for 6d. By 1942 it was described by Yr Aelwyd as \\"One of the most beautiful pictures of the religious life of Wales in old times\\" and in 1950, 1956 and 1957 many more Welsh households obtained copies when the picture was used in the Cymru Fydd calendar. By the 1960s, the painting was famous throughout Wales and was ubiquitous in many Welsh communities. Today a framed print of Salem hanging on the wall is a feature of many Welsh museums and historical buildings. In 2013, the painting featured in the first episode of the Welsh drama series Hinterland. Hidden figures and interpretations Shawl detail As reproductions became popular, so did the notion that it contained a hidden figure. Discussions of the painting's intended meaning often used this notion to support their interpretations. Aside from pious interpretations, there was much speculation that the painting had a more disapproving meaning. Some suggested the painting was a comment on the sin of vanity. The Chapel clock suggests Si√¢n Owen is arriving belatedly at a few minutes before ten (during the traditional Welsh silence before the morning service), possibly to ensure her presence is noted and appears to be wearing comparatively ostentatious clothing. The interpretation was often synonymous with a popular belief that Vosper had hidden an image of the devil in the folds of Si√¢n Owen's shawl. The postulated image can be seen in the section of shawl around her left arm. The paisley pattern forms a horn, the folds his eye and nose and the shawl's trim his beard. When questioned on this, Vosper always denied any such detail had been intentionally painted into the shawl. The enigmatic painter did confirm, however, an intended ghostly face painted into the verdant window scene. The partial knowledge of a hidden face somewhere within the painting is a likely starting point for the popular theory of a devil within the shawl. The painting's variable interpretations (especially as an admonishing lesson on pride) are now considered valuable example of how the Welsh viewed themselves, and their rural nonconformist past in the twentieth century. The devil in the shawl is now most commonly considered an example of pareidolia. Exhibition The work is presently exhibited at the Lady Lever Art Gallery at Port Sunlight, though there have been several attempts to permanently house the painting within Wales, most notably by a campaign in 2005 headed by Plaid Cymru's culture spokesman Owen John Thomas. In 2013 it formed the centrepiece of a temporary exhibition at the Gwynedd Museum and Art Gallery in Bangor. Many Welsh museums and galleries hold and exhibit Vosper paintings from the same period. Most notably the National Museum Cardiff houses Market Day in Old Wales (1908), a later Vosper painting featuring Si√¢n Owen. Often considered a sister work, the painting was gifted to the museum by Constance Vosper's brother, Frank Treharne James in 1914. Speaking in 2005 on the possibility of acquiring Salem, the Museum's director said \\"It was commissioned by the Lever family therefore belongs in the gallery they created, now belonging to the National Museums Liverpool\\". Hel Straeon a 1988 S4C arts programme revealed the existence of a slightly different version of Salem, owned by a descendant of Frank Treharne James. Peter Lord. An authority on Welsh painting, verified this second work as a Vosper composition. This painting is on display at Cyfarthfa Castle in Merthyr Tydfil, along with many other Vosper works bequeathed to the town upon the death of his second son. National Library of Wales On 10 October 2019, the National Library of Wales (Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru) announced it had purchased a second version of the Salem painting on behalf of the nation, \\"to protect and cherish it forever\\".https://www.llyfrgell.cymru/gwybodaeth-i/y-wasg-ar- cyfryngau/datganiadaur-wasg/datganiadaur-wasg-2019/diogelu-salem-ir-genedl/ References  * Category:Welsh art Welsh Category:1908 paintings Category:Watercolor paintings Category:Churches in art ","title":"Salem (Vosper painting)"},{"id":"44597251","text":"Jos√© Alberto Gonz√°lez Morales (born 7 August 1953) is a Mexican politician from the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

In 1793, she made repeated attempts to try to help former queen Marie Antoinette on one occasion by visiting her in prison dressed as a national guard with the plan of changing clothes with her. She also tried to free the former royal children from the Temple. Her activities had no success despite her spending considerable sums of her fortune on her missions.

The phenomenon takes place when two letters in a word (typically called a base word) switch positions to create a new string of letters that form a new, non-word (typically called a transposed letter non-word or TL non-word). It is a form of priming (psychology) because the transposed letter non-word is able to activate the lexical representation of its base word. A non-word that is created by transposing letters in a base word is significantly more effective at being a prime for that base word than would be a prime created by exchanging letters from the base word with random letters that were not originally in the base word. For example, the TL non-word would be a more effective prime than would be the non-word for the base word student. Priming is an effect of implicit memory where exposure to a certain stimulus, event, or experience affects responding to a different stimulus. Typically, the event causes the stimulus to become more salient. The transposed letter effect can be used as a form of priming. Relevance With any priming task the purpose is to test the initial stages of processing in order to better understand more complex processing. Psychologists use transposed-letter priming to test how people comprehend word meanings. From these findings, people can begin to understand how people learn, develop and understand language. Transposed- letter priming is used in a wide array of experiments and the reasons for using this method can depend on the particular hypothesis. Types =Close transpositions= Switching the position of adjacent letters in the base word is a close transposition. This type of transposition creates the greatest priming effect. For example, an effective prime for the word \\"computer\\" would be the TL non-word \\"\\". =Distant transpositions= Forming a prime word by switching the position of nonadjacent letters in the base word is a distant transposition. There is significantly less priming effect in a distant transposition than a close transposition, no matter how distant the two letters are from each other. History The first study to test the transposed-letter effects was Burner and O‚ÄôDowd (1958). However, their experiment did not use priming. They showed participants a word that had a two letter switched either at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of the word and they had to determine what the English word was. They measured their response time. Bruner and O‚ÄôDowd found that the error at the beginning created the slowest response time, the end was the next slowest and the middle was the fastest. The conclusion to this data was that the beginning and the end were more important for word recognition than the middle. From there, the transposition letter effect was used to test how people process and recognize words using many tasks. Transposed Letter Effect in Baboons A study by Ziegler et al. (2013) demonstrated that baboons also show similar effects in regards to the transposed letter effect as humans. The purpose of the study was to find evidence to suggest that baboons use orthographic processing when reading. Previous research has considered transposed letter effects as strong evidence for orthographic processing (Grainger, 2008).Graigner J. (2008). Cracking the orthographic code: An introduction. Language and Cognitive Processing, 23(1), 1-35. Baboons were asked to classify strings of letters as either words or non-words by selecting certain shapes (for example, a circle for a word and a square for a non-word). The baboons were shown words they had previously learned and non-words. The non-words were created by using four- letter words, previously learned by the baboons, and either transposing the two middle letters or replacing the two middle letters with different letters (double substitute non-words). Baboons classified TL non-words as words significantly more often than double substitute non-words. Theories Effected by Transposed-Letter Priming Effects =Theories challenged by effects of transposed-letter priming= There are a number of theories that have been challenged by the effects shown with transposition-letter priming. These theories mainly have to do with how letters are used to process words. Slot- based coding theory states that each letter in a word is connected to a particular location, or slot, within that word. One of the major theories that predict letter slots is the interactive activation model created by McClelland and Rumelhart (1981). This model assumes that people are letter-position specific when detecting words, so our recognition of words is based on what letters it contains, where the letters are placed within that word and the length of the word itself. Another example is the bayesian reader model created by Norris (2006) which also assumes that the letters in a word are associated with their specific location. Many experiments (for example, Perea and Lupker, 2003)Perea, M. & Lupker, S. J., (2003). Transposed-letter confusability effects in masked form priming. In Kinoshita, S. & Lupker, S. J., (Eds.) Masked Priming: The State of the Art (97-120). New York, NY: Psychology Press. have shown if you use transposed-letter priming, (for example, priming judge with ) you will see a priming effect but if the prime is a word where two letters are changed to other letter (for example, priming with ) there is no priming effect. According to the two models discussed we would assume is no more similar to judge than because the letters are not in the correct slots. In another experiment, TL non-words were more likely to be (incorrectly) classified as actual words than are nonsense control words (Andrews, 1996). Andrew‚Äôs results are also inconsistent with the many slot- based coding models because even with two of the letters in the incorrect spot they read the word as if spelled correctly. The parallel distributed processing model proposed by Seidenberg and McClelland (1989) also uses a portion of words but instead of letters they are a small group of letters in the same order as in the word. For example, the word ‚Äújudge‚Äù would have these groupings: . This predicts that if part of two words match there will be some priming, but this model still depends on the position of the letters to some extent, so it is not compatible with results from transposed-letter priming. =Theories supported by effect of transposed-letter priming= There are a number of theories that are supported by the results shown by the transposed- letter effect. The SERIOL model (sequential encoding regulated by inputs to oscillations within letter units) described by Whitney (2001) explains processing of words as five levels, or nodes: retinal level, feature level, letter level, bigram level and word level. In the bigram level, the letters detected are turned into a number of pairs. For example, the word ‚Äúcart‚Äù has the bigrams ca, ar, rt, ar, at and ct. The bigrams that more closely represent the location of letters in the words are given more weight. The pairs are then used to form the word. Within this model, letter location is still a factor but is not a defining feature of word processing, so the transposed-letter effect is consistent with this model. In the SOLAR model (self-organizing lexical acquisition and recognition) described by Davis (1999) each letter is associated with its own level of activation.Davis, C. J. (1999). The self- organising lexical acquisition and recognition (SOLAR) model of visual word recognition (Doctoral dissertation). University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. The first letter in the word has the highest level of activation and so on until the last word has the lowest level of activation. In this model, position does describe the level of activation for that particular letter but because the activation is successive, two letters beside each other would have a similar activation level. The SOLAR model is consistent with the results of the transposed-letter effect priming because with this effect experiments have shown priming when two adjacent letters are switched but not when two letters farther apart in the word are switched. Transposed-letter priming was used by Christianson, Johnson and Rayner (2005) on compound words to test the role of morphemes in word processing. They switched the letters either within the morphemes (for example, snowball to snowblal) or between morphemes (for example, snowball to snobwall) in the primes and found a greater priming effect within the morphemes than between. This supported the theory that morphemes are used during the processing of compound words because the priming effect was only reduced when the letters were switched over the morpheme boundary and were unable to separate into their separate parts.

He, along with Austin Film Society co-founder, South by South West co-founder, and Austin Chronicle co-founder Louis Black, assembled six 16mm and 8mm short films made in and around Austin, Texas, in 1980 to present as a representation of the kinds of films being made and produced in Austin at that time. The six films were Invasion of the Aluminum People by David Boone, Speed of Light, by Brian Hansen, Fair Sisters by Louis Black, Missy Boswell, and Ed Lowry, Leonardo, Jr by Lorrie Oshatz, The Death of Jim Morrison by Tom Huckabee, and Mask of Sarnath by Neil Ruttenberg. In 1980, then film student, Louis Black, wrote to Jonathan Demme in support of his early films, including Caged Heat and Crazy Mama. Demme, flattered by Black's favor and earnestness, visited Austin as a guest of Black. The story goes that the two men ate lots of barbeque, listened to lots of local punk and new wave music, and eventually watched lots of local shorts. Demme was blown away at the creativity and rawness of the Austin shorts and the very next day decided to show them as a series at The Collective for Living Cinema. Speed of Light and Invasion of the Aluminum People have been shown together since at Austin Film Festival and other large and small scale screenings. The six short films are currently being restored, digitized, and preserved for future filmmakers and film consumers and will be available as an archival package for film festivals and cinemas to screen for the public.

The Sweden Democrats declared at a press conference on 2 December 2014 that they would secondarily vote for the government budget proposed by other opposition parties in the centre-right Alliance, thus securing a majority for that budget and a defeat for the budget proposed by the Red-green L√∂fven cabinet. After a meeting between the Social Democrats, the Green Party and the parties of the Alliance did not lead to any solution or any plans of further negotiations, the Alliance's budget passed in the Riksdag on 3 December with a margin of 182 to 153 (14 parliamentarians not attending the meeting). The same day Prime Minister Stefan L√∂fven declared that the cabinet would call a snap election to be held on 22 March 2015. For constitutional reasons the snap election could not be called until 29 December 2014.Sweden heads for polls after Lofven's parliament defeat BBC. 3 December 2014 If held, the election would have been the first snap election and the first election not held in September since 1958.Charlotta Johansson (3 and 7 December 2014) S√• g√•r ett extra val till Sveriges Television On December 27, 2014, Prime Minister L√∂fven announced the snap election would not be held, following a six-party agreement on future budget procedures involving all major parties but the Left Party and the Sweden Democrats. The Agreement fell in October 2015 when the Christian Democrats decided to leave it. However, the centre-right parties Moderate, Liberals and Centre allow the centre-left social democrat minority government continue to govern.  Background  Minister for Finance Magdalena Andersson (left) on her way to the Riksdag to present the budget on 23 October 2014 The 2014 Swedish general election led to a situation where no political block gained a majority on their own. L√∂fven formed a minority government consisting of his Social Democrats and the Green Party, which was supported by the Left Party. However, the three parties do not hold a majority in the Riksdag and would need support from at least one opposition party in order to pass legislation.TT (15 September 2014) L√∂fven st√§nger d√∂rren f√∂r V Dagens Nyheter In the opposition, the centre-right Alliance consisted of the Moderate Party, the Centre Party, the Liberal People's Party and the Christian Democrats. The balance of power was held by the Sweden Democrats, a nationalist party. The other parties maintain a policy of refusing to co-operate with the Sweden Democrats. The budget proposal from the L√∂fven Cabinet was made in co- operation with the Left Party. The budget was presented to the Riksdag by Minister for Finance Magdalena Andersson on 23 October.TT (23 October 2014) Dyster Andersson i budgetdebatten G√∂teborgs-Posten The Alliance presented an alternative budget proposal on 10 November. Their budget was practically similar regarding migration, the main issue for the Sweden Democrats.Erik Melin et al. Alliansen l√§gger stram skuggbudget Aftonbladet. The Sweden Democrats presented their own alternative budget proposal. The usual practice in the Riksdag is that parties only vote for their primary budget proposal. During the autumn session, the Sweden Democrats said that they would consider deviating from the practice by voting for the Alliance budget after their own proposal failed.

In the afternoon, the Sweden Democrats held a press conference led by acting leader Mattias Karlsson and spokesperson on economic issues Oscar Sj√∂stedt, which ended with a statement that the party would vote for the Alliance's budget proposal the next day after their own proposal had failed.

They further declared that they would be prepared to vote down all future budgets from a potential new cabinet from the Alliance in a similar way, and that their main goal was to reduce what they saw as the Green Party's influence over Swedish immigration policy. Following the press conference Prime Minister Stefan L√∂fven invited the four leaders from the Alliance to a meeting the same evening at Rosenbad to discuss the situation. All parties accepted the invitation. For the Moderate Party group leader Anna Kinberg Batra attended instead of the party leader Fredrik Reinfeldt, who had declared his intention to step down from politics on the 2014 election night. The other parties were represented by their party leaders, Annie L√∂√∂f (Centre Party), G√∂ran H√§gglund (Christian Democrats) and Jan Bj√∂rklund (Liberal People's Party).

The Alliance leaders signaled before the meeting that they did not want to negotiate about the budget and stood fully by their own budget proposal. The meeting lasted somewhat over an hour and in interviews immediately afterwards the Alliance leaders confirmed that there had been no negotiations on the budget matter; the Alliance had, however, expressed wish to co-operate about procedural changes regarding decision making in the Riksdag to avoid similar situations in the future and make it easier for minority cabinets to govern. The same evening L√∂fven held a press conference with the three other cabinet ministers who had attended the meeting where he expressed regret that no progress had been made in talks with the Alliance. He stated that he had not decided whether he would resign or call a new election and that there might be \\"other alternatives\\".Erik H√∂gstr√∂m (2 December 2014)Stefan L√∂fven: Det finns flera alternativ Expressen. In center, Sweden Democratic representatives, including Mattias Karlsson, in the Riksdag after the L√∂fven cabinet's budget fell On 3 December, the Riksdag debated the three budget proposals from the cabinet, the Alliance and the Sweden Democrats and in the afternoon voted over which budget to approve for 2015. According to voting procedures, the parliament first voted over the proposal from the Sweden Democrats, which only got their votes. As they had planned, the Sweden Democrats then voted in favour of the budget proposal from the Alliance. The latter gained 183 votes against 153 for the cabinet's proposal. Plans for a snap election The budget voting was followed by a press conference by L√∂fven and Fridolin where L√∂fven said the cabinet would call a snap election to the Riksdag to be held on 22 March 2015.Niklas Svensson (3 December 2014) Stefan L√∂fven utlyser nyval i mars 2015 Expressen. According to the Constitution of Sweden a snap election can not be called before three month after the Riksdag has convened after the ordinary election, therefore the election could not be called until 29 December. In addition, the new Riksdag would only be elected to serve the rest of the existing Riksdag's term; the date of the 2018 general election would not be changed. In his statement, L√∂fven said the Sweden Democrats had declared they would be willing to overthrow every cabinet they disagreed with on immigration politics and said this caused a new political situation in Sweden. He further said he regretted what he saw as the Alliance's rejection of a closer co-operation with the cabinet. In a later press conference the leaders of the Alliance blamed the crisis on L√∂fven. The Sweden Democrats welcomed the plans for a new election and said they would focus their campaign on immigration. In a poll conducted via web 69% said they believed that the decision to call an election was right under the circumstances, while 29% disagreed. 48% held L√∂fven responsible for the situation, 47% held √Ökesson responsible, while the share who held the leaders in the Alliance responsible varied from 30 to 38%.Kim Malmgren (3 December 2014) V√§ljarnas besked: R√§tt med extra val Expressen.

However, this option had been rejected by L√∂fven beforehand and was seen by political commentators as politically impossible. There has been some debate among politicians and political commentators over whether it would have been more correct and appropriate of L√∂fven to ask the Speaker of the Parliament to explore the possibility of forming another cabinet instead of announcing a new election. The L√∂fven cabinet would then have functioned as a caretaker government in the interim. According to Swedish media, the Alliance had been prepared to form a minority cabinet after their budget was adopted and said that they were surprised by L√∂fven's decision to call an extra election.Hanna Jakobson et al. (4 December 2014) S√• lurade Stefan L√∂fven alliansen Expressen. However, the Sweden Democrats had said they would be prepared to use similar tactics against an Alliance minority government. Resolution On 27 December L√∂fven called off the snap elections after six-party talks had resulted in agreements where the government and the opposition would seek common ground on policy. Named the \\"December Agreement\\" (December√∂verenskommelsen), the deal effectively lets a minority coalition govern without needing to form a parliamentary majority through a loyal opposition, with the only requirement being to become the larger of the two main blocks.\\"H√•rd kritik mot uppg√∂relsen\\". SVT. 28.12.2014. The opposition would not vote on their own budget, in order to prevent the Sweden Democrats to be able to put political pressure by threatening to make the opposition budget win. The agreement was so controversial, as 34% of respondents believed the deal to be \\"undemocratic\\" according to a survey.\\"En av tre: December√∂verenskommelsen √§r odemokratisk\\". SVT. 30.12.2014. The deal was also met with strong criticism from senior politicians of both blocks, including former Moderate Party leader Ulf Adelsohn denouncing it as \\"an unconditional capitulation\\", former Culture Ministers Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth and Cecilia Steg√∂ Chil√≤, and former Defence Ministers Anders Bj√∂rck and Mikael Odenberg, the latter describing the deal as \\"a defeat for democracy and parliamentarism\\".\\"Kinberg Batra s√•gas av moderatprofilerna\\".

Green Party MEP and former spokesperson Peter Eriksson stated the deal to be \\"a huge democratic problem\\" that \\"in its very function bypasses the usual rules of democracy\\". Eriksson also remarked that in most democratic countries making such a deal would not be possible. The agreement was dissolved in 2015, however the centre-right parties Moderate, Liberals and Centre allow the centre-left social democrat minority government continue to govern. The \\"December Agreement\\" was cancelled on 9 October 2015. The continued resolution of the crisis was done by having the alliance parties propose each their own budget. That way no opposition budget could together with the Sweden Democrats win the Riksdag voting.

Used exclusively for air ambulance services, it is home to a Eurocopter EC-135P2+ operated by Norsk Luftambulanse (NLA) on contract with the National Air Ambulance Service. The base is owned by S√∏rlandet Hospital Trust. NLA started operating a summer base in Moland outside Arendal in 1986. Local actions to receive a permanent base started in 1990, and the heliport opened the following year. History Norsk Luftambulanse carried out a trial operation in Arendal during the summer of 1986. The south coast filled with holiday- goers during the summer months, increasing the demand for medical treatment. NLA was at the time funded through donations and needed to find new ways to promote itself. They found a suitable natural helipad at the former director mansion of Arendal Smelteverk, situated on the island of Bu√∏ya in the then municipality of Moland. NLA lacked sufficient funding for the project, so they made an agreement where the employees could bring themselves and their families for a free vacation at the mansion in exchange for duty time. NLA continued to operate a summer base in Arendal every summer.Andersen: 151 A government commission looked into the air ambulance organization in 1982. This resulted in the National Air Ambulance Service being established in 1988, under the auspice of the National Insurance Service.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 15 Through this arrangement, Agder and Telemark were covered by helicopter ambulances based at L√∏renskog Heliport, Central Hospital and Stavanger Heliport, Central Hospital.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 16 The government decision spurred local campaigning to establish a permanent base in Agder. They argued that Stavanger and Oslo were too far away to give an adequate coverage of Agder and Telemark. The activism increased rapidly in 1990. Two petitions were established, the one gathering 33,000 signatures. A common petition was written and signed by both county councils, 34 mayors and various organizations.Andersen: 152 There was also some opposition, based on that the ambulance service would in total be better off if the extra funding was used on strengthening the conventional ambulance service.Andersen: 153 Although there was agreement that a base should be established, there was far from local consensus regarding its location. Vest-Agder County Municipality argued that the base should be situated at Vest-Agder Central Hospital in Kristiansand, while Aust-Agder County Municipality wanted it at Aust-Agder Central Hospital in Arendal. The issue was decided by the Ministry of Social Affairs. The main argument was the Arendal was about of equal distance between Stavanger and L√∏renskog and that a helicopter there could cover both Vest- Agder and Telemark, unlike one based in Kristiansand. Arendal Hospital and its heliport Parliament approved the heliport, allowing it to start operations in 1991.Andersen: 155 This was met by protests from neighbors of the hospital, who complained about the noise pollution. They demanded the relocation of the heliport. This was the most extensive conflict of any regarding the location of an ambulance heliport in the country. After several years of measuring and other considerations, about fifty home-owners received compensation. Arendal was one of three heliports opened between 1991 and 1994, bringing the total number of ambulance helicopter bases to eleven.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 22 The original tender to operate the helicopter was awarded to NLA. The contract was from 2001 won by Airlift. NLA reclaimed the operating rights in the 2006 tender.Andersen: 122 Facilities The heliport is located centrally within the facilities of Arendal Hospital, located in the Heimdal neighborhood of Arendal. The base consists of an integrated office and hangar situated next to the helipad. It measures in diameter and can carry 10 tonnes. The heliport has direct access to the emergency department, away, through a skywalk. The facility is owned by S√∏rlandet Hospital Trust, part of Southern and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority. Operations The ambulance helicopters are operated by Norsk Luftambulanse on contract with the National Air Ambulance Service. They have a Eurocopter EC-135P2+ stationed at the heliport. It has room for a crew of three, consisting of a pilot, rescue swimming and an anesthesiologist, as well as two stretchers. Medical staff are provided by Arendal Hospital. The helicopter flew 916 missions lasting 845 hours in 2013. The heliport is occasionally used by the Westland Sea King of the 330 Squadron and the police helicopter. The 300 Squadron had one average annual landing in the period from 2005 to 2011.

Life The Barrau family became seigneurs of Muratel in 1557, taking the name \\"Barrau de Muratel\\". David Maurice Champouli√®s de Barrau de Muratel was the best known of this family. He was born on 14 February 1742. He joined the army, and was made lieutenant on 30 April 1757, cornet in the Orl√©ans Dragoons on 19 April 1760, captain in the regiment of the King's Dragoons on 12 April 1762, captain-commander in 1777, lieutenant-colonel of the Royal Dragoons on 29 October 1786. He was made a knight of the Order of Saint Louis on 15 September 1781, and was decorated on 30 April 1782. Muratel was appointed colonel of the Royal Dragoons on 21 October 1791. He distinguished himself at the head of his regiment on 29 July 1792 in the engagement near Landau, and on 3 August 1792 at Arnhem. His nephew David-Maurice-Joseph Mathieu de la Redorte fought under him at Arnhem. On the 10 August 1792 Kellermann therefore asked for his promotion to field marshal (mar√©chal de camp), which had been granted by the minister of war two days earlier. Muratel commanded the first line of infantry at the Battle of Valmy (20 September 1792). Muratel was no longer employed after 15 May 1793 and was decommissioned on 5 August 1794. He died on 5 February 1827. He was buried in the garden of the Chateau of Muratel.

Etymology The Verlorenvlei redfin takes its name from the Verlorenvlei River, its only remaining habitat. Description The species can be distinguished from the related P. skeltoni, P. burchelli, and P. burgi by two pairs of barbels around the mouth. Upon dissection, it can also be distinguished by the length of its intestine, which is longer (relative to body length) than any other species of Pseudobarbus. Individuals of Pseudobarbus verloreni grow long. The species has large eyes and a compressed snout. General coloration is golden, with a silver ventral surface. A lateral stripe runs from behind the head to a dark spot on the caudal peduncle. Fins are often red or orange around the base. Reproduction and development The species is believed to spawn between October and December. The lateral band fades as the individual matures. Furthermore, the reddish coloration around the fins is only found on adult specimens. Range and habitat The Verlorenvlei redfin is endemic to lowland waterways in western South Africa, more specifically the Verlorenvlei River system. It is also believed to have previously occupied the Langvlei River. The Verlorenvlei River is a slow flowing river with a bottom of sand, silt, or mud. During the rainy season, it becomes swift and turbulent, and during the dry season (late summer and autumn), it dries up into a series of separate pools. Discovery The Berg River redfin was originally believed to be found in the Berg, Verlorenvlei, Langvlei, and Eerste rivers, before disappearing from the latter two. A 1988 study by Paul Skelton found that specimens from the Verlorenvlei River differed markedly from the Berg River population, having a longer intestine and a greater length between the snout and the dorsal fin. It was confirmed that the populations were genetically dissimilar in a 2000 paper published in the Journal of Heredity, which indicated that they had been isolated for 0.5-2.3 million years, setting the date of divergence during the Pleistocene. Two more papers, published in 2009 and 2013, reiterated the differentiation, and the Verlorenvlei population was assigned to a new species, Pseudobarbus verloreni, in 2014. Conservation status P. verloreni is an endangered species, after it was exterminated from one of its two habitats, the Langvlei River system, between 1986 and 2001. It is believed to have disappeared due to the river being emptied during the dry season for agriculture. Threats faced by the species include habitat loss as water is drained for irrigation, as well as predation by the introduced black bass and competition from native and invasive species such as the Banded tilapia, Mozambique tilapia, and common carp.

It is mostly a cosmetic problem, causing yellowish spotting and banding on spruce needles, but in some cases can cause severe premature defoliation.‚ÄúWeir‚Äôs Cushion Rust or Spruce Needle Rust‚Äù, Cornell University, 2013 http://www.plantpath.cornell.edu/Trees/WeirCshRust.html Weir‚Äôs cushion rust can also disfigure and reduce growth of spruce trees by targeting the tender needles of newly emerging shoots.Stanosz, Glen, Chrysomyxa weirii on Colorado Blue Spruce in Wisconsin, Plant Disease. 86: 1051.3, September 2002 This pathogen's spores are spread by wind and water splash and germinate to infect newly developing needles on the same spruce, or neighboring spruce trees.Stanosz, Glen R., ‚ÄúWeir‚Äôs Cushion Rust of Spruces‚Äù, University of Wisconsin-Extension, April 25, 2004 Unlike many other rust disease pathogens, C. weirii is autoecious, only infecting spruce trees (no alternate host).D.S.

Importance Weir‚Äôs cushion rust is important to consumers, homeowners, and commercial growers. Consumers are recommended to inspect spruce trees for this disease prior to purchase to prevent introduction of the fungus into a location that is void of the disease. Homeowners with spruce trees should inspect their tree(s) in late summer and early spring for symptoms of Weir‚Äôs cushion rust, and, if found, treat the disease before it can spread to additional spruce trees. Weir‚Äôs cushion rust can be a significant problem in commercial nurseries, such as those that grow Christmas trees. The C. weirii fungus survives by infecting young needles, causing reduced growth and disfiguration. In an industry where the quality of tree foliage is paramount, the effects of this disease can prove very detrimental. If a Christmas tree farm shows incidence of this disease, it could adversely affect their sales in both the short and long-term if not adequately addressed, as the disease can persist for years if left unchecked. Symptoms and signs Weir‚Äôs cushion rust is first noticeable as yellow flecks on needles in the winter.Douglas, Sharon, Spruce Needle Rusts in Connecticut, The Connecticut Agricultural Research Station, June 2008 http://www.ct.gov/caes/lib/caes/documents/publications/fact_sheets/plant_pathology_and_ecology/sruce_needle_rusts_06-27-08r.pdf By midsummer, it forms pale-yellow bands on the needles, which will darken in color as the season progresses.Spruce Needle Rust: Chrysomyxa weirii (H.S. Jacks). Pennsylvania State University Extension. http://extension.psu.edu/pests/ipm/agriculture/christmas-tree/pest-fact- sheets/needle-discoloration-and-injury/spruce-needle-rust.pdf The bands are most noticeable on overcast days. By late summer, the yellow-orange telia are visible to the naked eye on the most recent growth. Needles that were infected the previous year turn brown and then defoliate. In order for a definitive diagnosis, teliospores must be examined under a microscope to confirm the presence of C. weirii. In general, infected trees may suffer from reduced growth, disfigurement, discoloration of the needles and premature needle drop. Host species and range Several spruce species (Picea sp.) are susceptible to Weir‚Äôs cushion rust, caused by C. weirii, including Engelmann spruce (P. englemannii), white spruce (P. glauca), black spruce (P. mariana), Colorado blue spruce (P. pungens), and Sitka spruce (P. sitchensis).Sutton, B.C., ‚ÄúChrysomyxa weirii‚Äù, IMI Descriptions of Fungi and Bacteria 1970, No. 23, Sheet 221, 1970O‚ÄôDonnell, Jill, Weir‚Äôs Cushion Rust identified in Michigan‚Äôs Upper Peninsula. Michigan State University Extension, June 1, 2012 http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/weirs_cushion_rust_identified_in_michigans_upper_peninsula Native to the western United States, Weir‚Äôs cushion rust can be found from Washington state to the Black Hills of South Dakota, and from the southern Appalachian Mountains to Vermont. The first report of the disease in the Great Lakes region of the United States was in Wisconsin in 2002, and in 2012 it was discovered in the upper peninsula of Michigan.Ziller, Wolf G, The tree rusts of Western Canada. Canadian Forestry Service; Ottawa: available from Information Canada, Victoria, B.C, 1974 It is also found in most provinces in Canada. Spruce shoots with characteristic Weir's cushion rust needle symptoms (Photo by Glen R. Stanosz, Professor of Tree and Forest Health, University of Wisconsin-Madison) Disease cycle Weir‚Äôs cushion rust is unusual among rust diseases in that it does not need an alternate host, and survives solely on spruce trees.Cleveland, Travis, ‚ÄúSpruce Needle Rust‚Äù, University of Illinois Home, Garden, and Pest Newsletter, Issue 3, May 7, 2012, http://hyg.ipm.illinois.edu/article.php?id=356 Additionally, the causal fungus, C. weirii, only produces two of the five spore types common in rusts: teliospores and basidiospores. C. weirii is thus considered monocyclic, and will only infect one host per growing season. In the disease cycle for C. weirii, new infections occur in the spring, when spores (basidiospores) infect tender needles growing from new shoots. By summer, yellow bands can be seen on the infected needles. The fungus grows internally and matures throughout the summer, and overwinters as mycelium in the needles. The next spring (or, rarely, late summer), blisters form on infected needles, harboring structures called telia. Telia produce spores, called teliospores, which remain on the needle, unless splashed around by water.Yoshitaka Ono, ‚ÄúThe Diversity of Nuclear Cycle in Microcyclic Rust Fungi (Uredinales) and its Ecological and Evolutionary Implications‚Äù, Mycoscience, Vol. 43, Issue 5, pp. 421-439, October 2002 These spores appear as a yellow-orange mass (often visible to the naked eye or with a hand lens) emerging from the blisters. Teliospores then germinate to produce additional structures, called basidia. Basidia, in turn, produce inoculum, called basidiospores, which will germinate followed by infection of spruce needles. Release of basidiospores coincides with new needle emergence on spruce trees. Dispersal is facilitated by wind and rain, which can carry these spores to other parts of the same tree, or to nearby trees. A new round of infection then commences, completing the one-year disease cycle of Weir‚Äôs cushion rust. The infection period can continue for up to three weeks and is more severe during periods of high moisture. Infected needles tend to fall off prematurely after 14 months, and cease producing spores.Stanosz, Glen, Weir‚Äôs Cushion Rust of Spruces, University of Wisconsin Extension, August 13, 2012, http://hort.uwex.edu/articles/weirs-cushion-rust- spruces Management For most home owners, Spruce needle rust is mostly a cosmetic disease and methods of control are usually unnecessary. In commercial industries, however, the adverse effect of the fungus on the trees may warrant treatment applications. Infected needles yellow and eventually fall, which can cause the tree to become thin-crowned and unmarketable. To prevent infection, seedlings should be examined for the disease prior to planting. Diseased trees in nurseries should be removed to reduce the amount of inoculum. Because wet conditions are favorable for infection, trees should be spaced to allow for adequate air circulation, helping to allow drying of needles. Weed levels should be kept low to further reduce moisture. =Chemical control= Chemical control is possible through the use of fungicides. Chloranthonil is one fungicide that may be labeled for application to spruces in some locations and may reduce severity of Weir's cushion rust. Application should begin when 10% of the trees have broken some buds and then reapplied weekly after that until the needles are mature or the infected needles have fallen. This usually requires 3‚Äì5 applications of fungicide. Spraying does not, however, kill the pathogen in already infected needles; it merely prevents colonization of healthy needles.

He studied at the √âcole des beaux-arts in Rennes alongside Pierre Charles Lenoir, √âloi Emile Robert, Armel Beaufils, Emmanuel Gu√©rin, Francis Renaud (sculptor) Louis Henri Nicot and Jean Boucher (artist) and later became professor of sculpture at the school. Main works The main works of Albert Bourget are listed below. =Bust of Marianne= The townhall of Le Minihic-sur-Rance in the place de l' √âglise has a plaster Bourget bust of this symbol of the French Republic. =Saint- S√©bastien-sur-Loire War Memorial= Saint-S√©bastien-sur-Loire war memorial At the top of a tall column is Bourget's sculpture of a winged angel who holds a crown of laurel in each hand. =Laval War Memorial= This memorial features a pyramid like structure decorated at the top with the croix de guerre at whose base are three bronze sculptures. That in the centre is an allegory for the motherland, armed and helmeted and carrying a flag and sword whilst below her and to her left, a dying soldier reaches up to hand her a statuette depicting \\"Victory\\". On the right of the central figure are the Laval coat of arms with a crown, this resting on a bed of laurel leaves. The inscription near the top of the monument reads The casting of the bronze was undertaken by the Fonderie Veuve Gauthier in Rennes. =Pac√© War Memorial= For this memorial, Bourget's composition was an imaginative one and featured the bronze body of a dead soldier which was placed in a niche in the monument itself. In 2013 the bronze was stolen and broken into four pieces but was recovered and will hopefully be repaired in the near future and placed back in its niche. =La piscine Saint-Georges= This is one of Rennes's architectural gems built between 1923 and 1926. The architect was Emmanuel Le Ray and the building's decoration includes a \\"mascaron\\" of the head of Neptune by Bourget and mosaics by Isidore Odorico. =Bieuzy War Memorial= Bourget was commissioned in 1925 to provide a sculpture for this memorial and working in granite, he sculpted a helmeted soldier (\\"poulu\\") with rifle who leans on a rock looking at a cross and the graves of his comrades. =Bust of C.A.Collin= This terracotta bust is held in the Rennes Musƒóe des beaux-arts. =The Rennes's Palais du Commerce= The figure of Hermes or Mercury holding a caduceus on this building in Rennes, the old PTT headquarters, was sculpted by Bourget as were the statues symbolizing Industry and Agriculture. =√âglise paroissiale Sainte-Th√©r√®se= This Rennes church, built in 1936 and designed by Hyacinthe Perrin stands in the rue Bigot-de-Pr√©ameneu. It holds mosaics by Isidore Odorico, paintings by Louis Garrain and sculpture by Bourget who created a depiction of Christ on the Cross for the church's porch and several gargoyles. =Miscellaneous= It was Bourget who carried out the restoration work on St Malo's statue of the Virgin Mary and Jesus in the Notre-Dame de la Grand'Porte church.

History Built between 1776 and 1779 the fort was constructed to provide a defensive stronghold in case of pirate attacks, and as a public works project to provide much needed employment during a time of famine and poverty on the island. It became commonly known as the Fortress of Hunger (Fortaleza del hambre). The famine was caused by a number of factors including periods of drought, and the earlier eruption of Timanfaya between 1730 and 1736, which devastated most of the productive agricultural areas on the island. Charles III of Spain, who was concerned for the plight of the islanders, ordered that the fortress be built. Situated on a cliff above the Port of Naos, the D shaped fort has semi- circular walls facing the sea. On the landward side, the rear wall is protected by two small turrets, with a moat crossed by a lifting drawbridge leading to the main gateway. The fortress is constructed of masonry and ashlar blocks of volcanic origin. The interior which is made up of barrel vaulted rooms was mainly used as a powder store. International Museum of Contemporary Art In the 1970s the fortress was renovated and the interior redesigned by the artist C√©sar Manrique, who was born nearby, to house a museum of modern art. The museum opened to the public in 1976 as the International Museum of Contemporary Art (, abbreviated as MIAC). The exhibits are primarily from the period between 1950 and 1980, with a focus on various abstract art forms, such as modern sculpture, kinetic art, and geometric abstraction. The works are mainly by Spanish artists including Joan Miro, Antoni T√†pies, Eusebio Sempere and the El Paso group, one section is also dedicated to the Canarian artist Pancho Lasso. The courtyard is also used as a display space for outdoor sculptures and designs. Beneath the museum, the annexe of the fort was renovated and converted into a restaurant, the two connected by a spiral staircase. With curved floor to ceiling windows, the dining room has panoramic views overlooking the harbour and docks below.

Moos (born circa 1951) is an American college administrator and former college football player who is currently the Athletic Director at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln. Moos also served as the director of athletics at Oregon and Washington State before being hired by Nebraska in 2017. Early life Moos was born and raised on a wheat and cattle ranch in rural Washington, then moved to Olympia at age fourteen when his father was named director of agriculture for governor Daniel J. Evans. Moos graduated from Olympia High School and played college football at Washington State under head coach Jim Sweeney. In his senior season in 1972, Moos was one of two offensive tackles named to the All-Pac-8 team, and he graduated with a bachelor's degree in history in 1973. Administrative career =Oregon= Moos served as assistant athletics director at his alma mater from 1982 to 1990, before leaving to become the Director of Athletics at the University of Montana. He held that position until 1995, when he was hired as Director of Athletics at the University of Oregon, a position he held until 2007. At Oregon, Moos raised the athletics budget from $18.5 million to $40 million, which included a 2002 renovation of Autzen Stadium, and the construction of the Ed Moshofsky Sports Center. During Moos' tenure, Oregon won 13 Pac-10 championships and added soccer and lacrosse and university-sponsored programs. Moos left Oregon in 2007 after a dispute with Nike founder and university donor Phil Knight. Terms of Moos' departure included an agreement that paid him $200,000 annually for not taking an administrative position at a Power Five school west of the Mississippi River. During his hiatus between 2007 and 2010, Moos took to raising beef cattle at his ranch at Valleyford, Washington, southeast of Spokane. The exact reasons for his resignation from Oregon are unknown, but the dispute with Knight regarding funding for an arena to replace the aging McArthur Court \\"strained a bit toward the end.\\" After Moos resigned, Knight donated $100 million towards the building of a new arena for Oregon. =Washington State= Moos returned to Washington State as athletic director in 2010. During his tenure, he signed a ten-year marketing agreement with Nike, and, as dean of Pac-12 athletic directors, oversaw the conference's 12-year, $3 billion television agreement with Fox Sports and ESPN. =Nebraska= Moos was hired as Nebraska's Director of Athletics on October 15, 2017, at a base salary of $1 million, making him the second-highest paid athletic director in the Big Ten, behind only Wisconsin's Barry Alvarez. After firing Mike Riley at the end of the 2017 season, Moos hired former Nebraska quarterback Scott Frost from UCF to serve as head football coach. Just months after his hiring, Nebraska's volleyball program won the NCAA Tournament, giving Moos his first national championship as an administrator. In March 2019, Moos fired men's basketball head coach Tim Miles, and replaced him with former Iowa State and Chicago Bulls head coach Fred Hoiberg, a Lincoln native. Personal life Moos and his wife Kendra have five children: daughters Christa, Brittany, and Kaiti, and sons Bo and Benjamin.

In the digital age, people have been wondering what happens to their digital presence once they die. These archives encompass any online account that a person may have such as social media, shopping sites, and gaming sites. Many websites now have a set of guidelines and procedures that can be followed to remove a deceased person's account from their servers. These procedures may vary from site to site. However, a digital will is a way to determine the fate of your online presence in one location instead of having to make arrangements with each site individually. Guidelines # Appoint someone as online executor # State in a formal document how profiles and accounts are handled # Understand privacy policies # Provide online executor list of websites and logins # State in the will that the online executor must have a copy of the death certificate (DesMarais, 2014). Obstacles and problems Although digital wills are necessary and helpful, some problems and obstacles may be encountered. As identified in the Buffalo Law Review, obstacles include: # passwords, which online accounts cannot be accessed without, so if a loved one passes away, but does not pass along their account information, there is little hope of getting access to the accounts. # Encryption, which is changing information to hide something, # Federal and state criminal laws that penalize what is thought of as unauthorized access to computers and data, and # Federal and state privacy laws. Terms and conditions of service must always be taken into account, which can cause problems if there are fine details, or clauses that refer to what to do in the event of the death of the account user. In some cases, the web service may have the ability to terminate the account and delete all data, and if other people besides the user gains access, there may be criminal charges placed against them, even if the one who died has passed on the password to them (Watkins, 2014, p. 194). An article by Magder in the newspaper The Gazette provides a reminder that identity theft can potentially continue to be a problem even after death if their information is released to the wrong people. This is why online networks and digital executors require proof of a death certificate from a family member of the deceased person in order to acquire access to accounts. There are instances when access may still be denied, because of the prevalence of false death certificates. Controversy In Delaware, the ‚ÄúFiduciary Access to Digital Assets and Digital Accounts Act‚Äù was signed into law. That Act states that a beneficiary that has control over digital accounts or digital assets will have the same rights as the initial account holder. This law trumps conflicting terms of services agreements from online service providers or custodians, such as Yahoo. See also *Death and the Internet *Digital inheritance References *PickledAssets.

The excess fluid is secreted and is fed upon by ants which are often found associated with the leafhoppers. The ants do not harm the leafhoppers but may drive off potential predators. Some sand wasps in the tribe Nyssonini prey on this leafhopper, carrying off adults to provision the cells in which they lay their eggs.

It had a magnitude of 5.1 with an epicenter in central Tashkent at a depth of . The earthquake caused massive destruction to Tashkent, destroying most of the buildings in the city, killing between 15 and 200 people and leaving 300,000 homeless. Following the disaster, most of the historic parts of Tashkent had been destroyed and the city was rebuilt, modelled on Soviet architectural styles. Soviet authorities created an Institute of seismology in order to forecast future earthquakes.  Background  Tashkent and its immediate vicinity were prone to earthquakes and 74 earthquakes of a magnitude between 3 and 6 had been recorded from 1914 to 1966. The city had been damaged in earthquakes in 1866 and 1886. Concerns about possible earthquake damage to the city were raised in the 1940s and 1950s, especially after Ashgabat was devastated in an earthquake in 1948. Before the Tashkent earthquake, an increase in radon levels had been noticed.  Earthquake  The earthquake occurred at 05:23 at a depth of with its epicentre in the centre of the city. The quake caused massive destruction to property. In total, over 80% of the city was destroyed, including over half of the old city. In total, between 78,000 and 95,000 homes were destroyed. Most of these were traditional adobe housing in more densely populated central areas. The majority of the most significant buildings in Tashkent were destroyed; this included 600-year-old mosques. Most of these buildings predated the Russian Revolution of 1917. However, only Navoi Theater, which was built by Japanese prisoners of war was unharmed.Katsumi Akai„ÄéOkayama zatsugaku n≈çto„ÄèKibitoshuppan 2000 p.118-121 Estimates of those made homeless by the disaster ranged from 200,000 to 300,000. While the official death toll was 15 people this figure may be an underestimate due to Soviet secrecy and other sources estimated death tolls ranging from 200 people to 0.5% of the city's population of 1,100,000. Over 20% more women than men were killed.  Aftermath  In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, senior Soviet figures, including CPSU Chairman Leonid Brezhnev, flew to Tashkent to supervise the recovery efforts. A massive rebuilding project was started, with other Soviet republics sending large numbers of workers to assist in the rebuilding process. This changed the ethnic make up of the city, as many of them remained in Tashkent after the work had been completed. The new Tashkent contained architectural styles found in other Soviet cities such as wide boulevards and large apartment block complexes. By 1970, 100,000 new homes had been constructed. The earthquake also resulted in increased religiosity, with increased interest in many Islamic ritual practices. To prevent further such disasters from having such a serious impact on the city, in 1966 Soviet authorities created an Institute of seismology, tasked with monitoring seismic changes, such as changes in radon levels and predicting earthquakes. A memorial stone to victims of the earthquake located above the epicentre was unveiled in 1976.

He was assistant artistic director of the Scottish Ballet (1969‚Äì1974) and artistic director of the Queensland Ballet (1975‚Äì1978) and the Royal New Zealand Ballet (1981‚Äì1992).Michelle Potter, \\"Harry Haythorne, 1926‚Äì2014,\\" obituary, http://michellepotter.org/news/harry- haythorne-1927-2014. The principal source of biographical information given herein, used by permission of the author. Early years Haythorne was born in Adelaide, South Australia, the child of an English father and an Australian mother of Irish descent. Both his parents, who had met at a local dance hall, loved ballroom dancing, but they were barred from many venues in Adelaide because they dared to introduce what Haythorne jokingly referred to in an interview as \\"filthy foreign dances\\" such as the foxtrot and the quickstep. His father had brought these dance styles with him when he migrated from England to Australia. They were unknown at the time in Adelaide.Harry Haythorne, interviewed by Michelle Potter, May and October 2000. National Library of Australia, Keep Dancing Oral History Project, TRC 4560. Haythorne began his dance training with Jean Bedford, who taught \\"operatic dancing,\\" and shortly afterward enrolled in tap dancing classes with Herbert Noye.Harry Haythorne,m \\"How I Became a Dancer‚ÄîAussie Style‚Äîin the 1930s.\\" Choreography and Dance: An International Journal 6.2‚Äì3 (2001), 21‚Äì35. His initial ambitions were to go into vaudeville. Even with the visits of the Ballets Russes companies to Australia in the 1930s, which was an exciting time for him, he still did not have ambitions to take up ballet seriously. When Haythorne was fourteen, he began his professional performing career with Harold Raymond's Varieties, a vaudeville troupe established initially as a concert party to entertain troops as World War II began. With Harold Raymond, he took part in comedy sketches, played his piano accordion, sang songs, and danced. His star act, which would feature again much later in his life, was his tap dancing routine on roller skates.\\"Harold Raymond's Vaudeville Show.\\" Barrier Miner (Broken Hill), 11 August 1944, p. 3. Online at National Library of Australia website, http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49563935. During the last months of World War II, Haythorne joined the Royal Australian Air Force and remained in the defence forces for two years. After being discharged, he resumed his dancing career. In the late 1940s, he took ballet classes from the Adelaide teacher Joanna Priest and performed in her South Australian Ballet.Margaret Abbie Denton, Joanna Priest: Her Place in Adelaide's Dance History (Adelaide: Joanna Priest, 1993), p. 162. However, it was seeing performances by Ballet Rambert during its Australasian tour (1947‚Äì1949) that inspired him to change direction and look to ballet as a career.Harry Haythorne, interviewed by Michelle Potter, May and October 2000. Theatrical career Haythorne left Australia in 1949, bound for the United Kingdom. In London he took ballet classes with Anna Northcote and Stanislas Idzikowski before auditioning successfully for the Metropolitan Ballet and later joining Mona Inglesby's International Ballet. But his career in England and continental Europe proved to be an eclectic one, not limited to the world of ballet. He worked on the Max Bygraves Show, danced on early British television shows, performed in musicals, including Cole Porter's Can Can, and toured to South Africa with a production of The Pajama Game. In an interview in 2000, Haythorne listed the three greatest influences on his career in England and Europe as L√©onide Massine, for whom he acted as personal assistant and ballet master for Massine's company, Les Ballets Europ√©ens; Walter Gore, for whom he was ballet master of London Ballet; and Peter Darrell, who hired him as manager of Western Theatre Ballet and then as assistant artistic director of the Scottish Ballet in Glasgow.Harry Haythorne, interviewed by Michelle Potter, May and October 2000. Always an Australian at heart, Haythorne began to miss his homeland and made various moves to return. He eventually went back, and, in 1975, took up the position of artistic director of the Queensland Ballet. With that company, he mounted works by a number of Australian choreographers, including Graeme Murphy, Garth Welch, Don Asker, Rex Reid, Leslie White, and Ray Cook, and he introduced the ballets of choreographers he had worked with in the United Kingdom, including Walter Gore, Jack Carter, and Peter Darrell. He also engaged the Danish dancer and teacher Hans Brenaa to stage La Sylphide and other works of August Bournonville.Edward H. Pask, Ballet in Australia: The Second Act, 1940‚Äì1980 (Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1982), pp. 232‚Äì234. Despite these accomplishments in only three years on the job, Haythorne's directorship was a short one, as his contract was terminated in 1978. He was unhappy at the way this was done and thereafter always maintained that no rational explanation was ever given. After leaving the Queensland Ballet, Haythorne was founding coordinator of a tertiary dance course at Kelvin Grove College of Advanced Education (now Queensland University of Technology).Harry Haythorne, interviewed by Michelle Potter, May and October 2000. He remained in this role for another three years, but, after deciding that he wanted to direct a company rather than head a dance school, he accepted the position of artistic director of the Royal New Zealand Ballet in 1981. His directorship of this company was a fruitful one, lasting more than a decade, until 1992. He regarded it as the happiest time of his life.Interview with Harry Haythorne, Radio New Zealand, 2013. Online at http://www.radionz.co.nz/collections/rnzb/audio/2563342/harry-haythorne. During his tenure, the company staged works by major international artists. Haythorne oversaw the company's thirtieth anniversary in 1983; staged his own full-length Swan Lake; and toured the company in China, the United States, and Europe as well as in Australia.Jennifer Shennan, A Time to Dance: The Royal New Zealand Ballet at 50 (Wellington: Royal New Zealand Ballet, 2003), pp. 38‚Äì47. For the company's sixtieth anniversary in 2013, encapsulating his attitude to his appointment in 1981, and also his approach to directorship in general, he wrote: \\"I knew I had to learn much more about New Zealand and its history, familiarise myself not only with its dance world but also with its literature, music, and visual arts, while still keeping a finger on the international pulse.\\"Harry Haythorne, \\"The Royal New Zealand Ballet: Sixty Years Young,\\" in The Royal New Zealand Ballet at Sixty, edited by Jennifer Shennan and Anne Rowse (Wellington: Victoria University Press, 2013), p. 88. During his time in New Zealand, Haythorne worked closely with the New Zealand School of Dance and its teachers. He attended school auditions and became a member of the board of directors.Diana Dekker, \\"Artistic Director Had a Huge Impact on Ballet Scene,\\" obituary, The Dominion Post (Wellington), 8 December 2013, p. C3. He believed that the strength of any company was a school that would train dancers who were familiar with company style and repertoire and who had gained experience by having small parts in its productions while still students.Haythorne, \\"The Royal New Zealand Ballet: Sixty Years Young\\" (2013), p. 102. In the 1993 New Zealand New Year Honours, Haythorne was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to ballet. Later years On his return to Australia from New Zealand in 1993, Haythorne was always in demand. He taught dance history at the Victorian College of the Arts, in Southbank, and repertoire at the National Theatre Ballet School, in Melbourne, and was frequently invited to teach and stage ballets for schools around Australia. He returned to the stage himself on several occasions with productions by the Australian Ballet, taking cameo roles in Stanton Welch's Cinderella (1997), Graeme Murphy's Swan Lake (2002) and Nutcracker: The Story of Clara (1992, revived 2003), Ronald Hynd's Merry Widow (1975, later revived), and the joint Australian Ballet‚ÄìSydney Dance Company production of Murphy's Tivoli (2001). He is especially remembered for his role in Tivoli, in which he was cast as an old vaudeville trouper. At the age of seventy-five, Haythorne reprised his tap dancing‚Äìroller skating‚Äìskipping routine from the 1940s. For his performances in this role he received the 2001 Australian Dance Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Dancer.Australian Dance Awards website: http://www.australiandanceaards.net.au/award-winners/outstanding- performance-by-a-male-damcer/harry-haythorne. Publications In 1970, Haythorne published How to Be a Ballet Dancer, with illustrations by Peter Cazalet (England: Wolfe Publishing for the Dairy Industry). He was the author of articles published in Dance Australia, in Brolga: An Australian Journal about Dance, and in Choreography and Dance: An International Journal, and he was a contributor to the Royal New Zealand Ballet's sixtieth birthday publication, The Royal New Zealand Ballet at Sixty. He was also a frequent writer of letters to the editor of various dance magazines. Celebration Haythorne died in a Melbourne hospice in November 2014 at the age of eighty- eight. A small, private funeral was held for his close friends. When his will was read, it was learned that he had requested a party celebrating his life rather than a somber memorial service with a eulogy. Accordingly, on 31 January 2015, simultaneous celebrations, linked by video, were held in the studios of the Australian Ballet in Melbourne and the Royal New Zealand Ballet in Wellington, Many members of the dance and theatre communities in both countries attended and shared affectionate anecdotes and stories.Andris Toppe, Australian choreographer and dancer, personal communication, 26 February 2015.

In these cases, the murderer has never been identified. Ulster County John Doe A frozen male corpse was found on February 1, 1970 in the Ulster County town of Saugerties, at the bottom of a slope near Platte Clove Road by two children who were out sledding. He was aged between 35 and 45 and had been shot four times in the back of the head. The victim was approximately tall and weighed about . He had dark brown hair, with balding at the crown. He was wearing a tan three-quarter length raincoat over a dark green suit with faint pinstripes; beneath was a blue dress shirt and black silk Playboy Enterprises tie with pajamas underneath. On his feet were gray socks and size 8 black dress shoes covered by black Canadian-made Wings rubbers. In his pocket he had $156 ($ in modern dollars) in cash, but no identification. He appeared to be from outside the United States, most likely Brazil. His suit has been described as \\"European-style\\". On his wrist was an Omega Seamaster wristwatch (serial number 16815714) that had been sold in a Portuguese coastal resort town. His other accessory was a gold ring whose stamp indicated it had been made in Brazil, set with an imitation ruby of Portuguese manufacture. His undershirt was a Brazilian store brand, made in Taiwan; the bullets used to kill him also appeared to be a Brazilian brand. The death is believed to be gang-related. Members of local organized crime groups were questioned, but never revealed who the victim was. In 2015, investigators had the body exhumed and sent samples for a DNA profile; so far there have been no matches to those in any database.  Onondaga County John Doe  On June 16, 1976, the decomposing remains of a young white male were found by three fishermen in the Oswego River, in Lysander, New York. He had been smothered to death and then tied to two cinder blocks to keep him submerged in the water. Investigators believe that he was dead for between two to five weeks, however he could have been dead for up to a year. He was estimated to be between 25 and 35 years old, was 5 feet 10 inches tall, and weighed between 130 and 140 pounds. He had brown, medium length hair and what was described as a thin, jagged nose. He was also of a thin build. He was found wearing a beige, cashmere, pullover sweater, a blue turtleneck sweater, blue jeans, a pair of nylon bikini shorts with a red trim, brown, leather, half-boots with side zippers, blue cotton socks, a gold chain with the charms of an Italian \\"Mano Cornuto\\" symbol, and a cornicello or Bull-horn shaped ornament. $0.87 USD and a good luck charm from South of the Border in South Carolina were also found on his person. Investigators found that the Comuto symbol was of Italian origin, with \\"Como\\" meaning horn and \\"Mano\\" meaning hand. The gesture that the hand depicts the pinkie and pointer finger extended to the air, while the other three fingers are curled. It is in reference to the horned head of the animal. The symbol is believed to ward off evil, and is a popular amulet found among descendants of Italian immigrants.  New York City Jane Doe  On December 2, 1979, the charred remains of a young white female were found in Room 417 in the Travel Inn Motor Hotel after firefighters were dispatched to a fire alarm. She was found beside another woman, who was later identified as Deedeh Goodarzi, a Kuwaiti woman who was a prostitute. Both woman had their hands and head removed after being killed, none of which were ever recovered. She was estimated to be between 16 and 22 years old, was between 5 feet 1 inch and 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighed between 100 and 110 pounds. Hair color and eye color could not be ascertained. She was found wearing a black full-length coat, a pair of jeans, a pair of black leather boots and a burgundy sweater. She was later found to be a victim of serial killer, Richard Cottingham. Chautauqua County Jane Doe On the morning of December 6, 1983, a woman's body was found by utility workers in a roadside ditch alongside eastbound NY 17 (now Interstate 86) in the Chautauqua County town of Ellery. She had been shot four times: twice in the chest, once in the mouth and once in the back. The woman carried documents available in European countries and in Canada and had dental work appearing to use European techniques. The victim had brown eyes and graying brown hair, and was also estimated to have given birth to a child within the last 15 years. She was between 33 and 37 years of age when she had died, hours before being found. She was around tall and weighed around . It is suspected that she may have been Canadian, as she carried a handwritten note with indecipherable abbreviations that originated from an establishment in British Columbia. She had some distinct characteristics: a wart was visible above her left eye, a mole was found behind the left ear and a scar was visible on her neck. The victim's clothing has caused some issues with determining her social class, as she wore both expensive and inexpensive clothing. The undershirt she wore originated from Italy and was not worth a lot of money. This product had also not been circulated globally. She also wore a multicolored trench coat that was fairly expensive, along with a pullover and a \\"handmade\\" skirt. Putnam County John Doe (1985) On April 2, 1985, a man's remains were found nearly two years after his death, in Philipstown, Putnam County, New York. He was found with a dress shirt along with shorts, two pairs of pants with army coloring and corduroy material and work boots. Several pairs of underwear and socks were also found at the scene. A map of New York and New Jersey, a comb, dental floss and playing cards were among his possessions. At one time in his life, he received orthodontic care. Westchester County Jane Doe (1988) Another reconstruction of the Westchester County Jane Doe On February 14, 1988, the \\"posed\\" nude body of a woman was found on a street in Mount Vernon, Westchester County, New York. The victim had been dead for approximately six to twelve hours, and was bound at the wrists and ankles and had died from ligature strangulation as well as suffering a beating. She was aged 18 to 30, with hazel eyes and with bleached, light brown or blonde hair. She was 5 feet 3 inches tall, weighed 105 pounds, and had pierced ears without earrings. She had numerous freckles and moles (including a large and prominent mole on her neck). Her underarms had not been shaved for approximately two weeks, but her pubic area was recently shaved. This detail has led some investigators to presume she could have been a prostitute. The fact that the rest of the body showed an absence of shaving, it has also been suggested she was foreign to the United States, and could be of South American descent. Her nails were painted pink prior to her death. No clothing was found at or near the scene. An autopsy found that she had ingested cocaine and broccoli before her murder, which may have been the work of a serial offender. Irondequoit Jane Doe On July 31, 1988, a skeleton was found in a shallow grave by a boy who was digging at the edge of his family's property in Irondequoit, Monroe County, New York. No signs of trauma were found, but the cause of death was ruled as a homicide. The remains were those of a white female between 4 feet 10 inches and 5 feet 5 inches tall. Her weight, hair color, and eye color could not be determined. She had received significant dental restoration in life, including gold foil fillings. The victim, who was between 15 and 19 years of age, may have been deceased for as long as 10 to 30 years before the discovery of her body. No clothing was found at the scene. A single white button, which may have belonged to the victim, was found near the remains.  Yonkers Jane Doe  On June 27, 1992, the dismembered body of a young-middle aged white female was discovered in a trash bin at a shopping center, near the New York Thruway (Interstate 87) in Yonkers, New York. She was estimated to be between 28 and 42 years old, was 5 feet 7 inches tall, and weighed between 115 and 140 pounds. She had dark brown hair and hazel eyes, as well as a tattoo of a butterfly on her right shoulder. She had two Cesarean section scars, a scar on her left thigh, and pierced ears. She was found wearing a short sleeved, light blue denim jacket and a white bra. She was confirmed to be one of two unidentified victims of serial killer Robert Shulman. His modus operandi matched up with how the victim was found, leading investigators to believe that she was a prostitute and may have abused narcotics. The other unidentified victim was a young white female discovered in a garbage can in Medford, New York. Long Island serial killer victims The dismembered corpses of several females discovered between 1996 and present day. \\"Peaches\\" The torso of a woman found in 1997. She is known for her unique peach tattoo. Woodbury John Doe On May 3, 1998, the skeleton of a black male was found in the Orange County town of Woodbury. He had been shot twice in the head by two guns of different calibers and left near a rest area for hikers. His body had been wrapped in plastic and he was fully clothed. He carried a hair pick, a lighter and a French to English dictionary, indicating that he may have been from a Francophone country. Although the body was found in 1998, he was believed to have died as early as 1985. He was knock-kneed and between 5 feet 6 inches and 5 feet 11 inches in height, although he was more likely around 5 feet 9 inches. He had been between 17 and 25, but could have been as old as 35. He wore a blue jacket, a black shirt containing a pot of gold design with the words \\"follow your dreams,\\" jeans and sneakers from the Pony company. He had had dental work, including fillings, crowns and a possible root canal. He had suffered a fracture of his right hand some weeks prior to death.  Suffolk County John Doe  On March 9, 2000, the nearly-fully decomposed remains of a young white/Hispanic male were discovered by a NYDOT inspector near a chain link fence off of the shoulder of the Northern State Parkway in Huntington, New York. He had been shot three to five times by a large caliber pistol and stuffed into a garbage bag. He was estimated to have been dead for two months. He was estimated to be between 25 and 45 years old, was between 5 feet 8 inches and 6 feet tall, and weighed between 140 and 150 pounds. He had short, dark brown/black hair. His teeth were severely decayed, and eight teeth were missing entirely. He was found wearing a khaki colored, short sleeved, v-neck shirt with a black trim, a \\"New Jersey\\" T-shirt depicting a seaside scene with an \\"Atlantic City\\" emblem on it, blue jeans, and a bathing suit. It was noted that contract workers had been working on installing light fixtures in the area the December prior.  Wayne County Jane Doe (2002)  On August 29, 2002, the skeletal remains of a young, African American (with possible Hispanic or white admixture) female and fetus were discovered next to a roadway near a state-access boat launch in Huron, New York. Cause of death could not be ascertained, but is deemed a homicide. She was estimated to be between 20 and 40 years old and between 5 feet 1 inch and 5 feet 6 inches tall. She had red/brown-red hair that was possibly dyed, and was 7-8 months pregnant with the aforementioned fetus. She had been wrapped in a tan shower curtain with royal-blue shower rings. The area is between Rochester and Syracuse, New York, and investigators believe that her body had been dumped at the location after being killed elsewhere. Investigators believe that she may be connected to six unsolved homicides in the area which occurred over the last two years, however nothing has been confirmed. Investigators have interviews various potential witnesses or doctors who may have treated her during her pregnancy. She was possibly a migrant worker.  Manhattan Jane Doe (2003)  On February 10, 2003, the skeletal remains of a young, possibly teenage, white female were discovered wrapped up inside of a rug inside of a layer of concrete, in the basement of a nearly-abandoned apartment building in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, New York's west side. She had been bound at the hands and feet and strangled to death. The post mortem interval was difficult to assess with the body encased in concrete, leaving investigators to believe that she may have been died anywhere between 1970 and 2003. She was estimated to be between 15 and 21 years old and was 5 feet 1 inch tall. She had light colored, possibly red hair and a petite build. She appeared to have had extensive dental work done at some point in her life, however her teeth had started to decay. She was only found wearing a bra, pantyhose, a Bulova watch, and a ring with the initials \\"P Mc. G\\", which may have actually read \\"P G Mc\\". Authorities have stated that the building near which the woman was found is an area frequented by prostitutes, with the basement having multiple ways in and out. Scraps of glittery clothing support the hypothesis that she may have been a prostitute. She may have been of possible Irish descent, and abused drugs.  Niagara Falls Jane Doe (2003)  On July 14, 2003, the burned remains of a young/middle aged female of unknown race was found in a burned building in Niagara Falls, New York. She had been beaten to death and then set ablaze, evidenced by a gasoline container near her body. She was between 25 and 50 years old, was between 4 feet 10 inches and 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighed at least 58 pounds. She had brown hair with blonde streaks, which may have possibly been a wig, and dark eyes. The only clothing items able to be recovered were a gold chain necklace with a charm of a heart with a cross inside of it, two gold rope necklaces of different thickness, a gold link bracelets made up of small links and one large one, and a silver toe ring with raised heart shapes. A purse was also found, with evidence that she may have been a hypodermic drug user. Investigators believe she may have been a prostitute from the area.  Queens John Doe (2005)  On February 5, 2005, the body of a young Hispanic boy was found, partially wrapped in a Mickey Mouse sheet, after it had washed ashore onto Rockaway Beach in Queens, New York. Cause of death was initially uncertain, however it was ruled a homicide after discovering multiple broken bones on the child's torso. He was estimated to be between 3 and 5 years old and was 3 feet tall. Weight, hair color, and eye color could not be ascertained. He had fractures on his bones that were in various states of healing that appeared to have happened before the child died. The sheet and the body were found inside of a yellow plasticized canvas duffel bag which was wrapped in duct tape. He may have been from overseas.  Brooklyn John Doe (2005)  On July 26, 2005, the severed torso of a young, African American male was discovered on the conveyor belt of a recycling plant in Brooklyn, New York. A decomposed skull inside of a plastic bag was discovered in a public park four days later, and was linked to the torso by DNA. No teeth or lower jaw bone were recovered with the skull. No discernible cause of death could be found, but was deemed a homicide due to the dismemberment. The victim was estimated to be between 17 and 23 years old, was between 5 feet 5 inches and 5 feet 8 inches tall, and weighed between 130 to 200 pounds. Hair color and eye color could not be ascertained. The remains were initially thought to have belonged to a white/Hispanic male, until DNA testing proved otherwise. \\"Cherries\\" A torso and pair of legs discovered in 2007. Like the torso found in 1997, dubbed \\"Peaches\\", she may have been a victim of the Long Island serial killer.  Brooklyn Jane Doe (2015)  On January 4, 2015, the dismembered body of a young-middle aged African American female was discovered in Calvert Vaux Park in Brooklyn, New York. Initially, a decomposing hand was found, until authorities unearthed both arms and legs, a foot, and a torso. More remains were found in March. She was estimated to be between 20 and 45 years old, and was between 5 feet 3 inches and 5 feet 9 inches tall. Weight, hair color, and eye color are not conclusively known, but estimated to be black and brown, respectively, based on DNA Phenotyping by Parabon Nanolabs. She had a red and green tattoo on her right calf of a heart and rose with the possible name \\"Monique\\". It is unknown if this name was hers or someone close to her. She was found to be of primarily Sub-Saharan African descent, disputing previous theories that she was white. She was thought to have lived in the western region of the United States, possibly Albuquerque, Las Vegas, or Portland, Oregon, or possibly near the Canadian border in Upstate New York, or New England.

O'Hare (1877‚Äì1960), was an American socialist political activist, journalist, and newspaper editor. O'Hare is best remembered as the husband and helpmate of Kate Richards O'Hare, one of the preeminent female socialists of the first quarter of the 20th century, and as co-editor with her of The National Rip-Saw, a St. Louis socialist weekly. Following the couple's 1928 divorce, Frank O'Hare made a career as a writer and columnist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Biography =Early years= Frank O'Hare entered the work force in 1893 as a timekeeper and engineers' assistant helping in the construction of Union Station in St. Louis. Francis Peter \\"Frank\\" O'Hare was born April 23, 1877, in New Hampton, Iowa, the son of Peter Paul O'Hare, an Irish-born itinerant laborer, miner, and adventurer, and the Dutch-born Elizabeth Weijers Petzold O'Hare, a widowed storekeeper.Peter H. Buckingham, Rebel Against Injustice: The Life of Frank P. O'Hare. Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press, 1996; pp. 6-7. His father abandoned the family when Frank was a young boy, providing only minimal financial support for his wife and her four children over the years.Buckingham, Rebel Against Injustice, pg. 7. Frank's mother was forced to take up sewing for sympathetic neighbors while his older half-brother entered the work force at an early age to help the family make ends meet.Buckingham, Rebel Against Injustice, pg. 8. In 1881 Frank's mother moved the family to St. Louis, Missouri, and it was there that the boy spent his formative years. The family lived in poverty in a small house, with the children raised to be devout Roman Catholics.Buckingham, Rebel Against Injustice, pg. 9. Frank began attending public school in St. Louis in 1885 at the age of 8 and began working as a newspaper delivery boy just two years later.Buckingham, Rebel Against Injustice, pg. 11. His newspaper route, delivering to 200 subscribers, brought Frank not only significant income, but helped introduce him to the newspaper business and political affairs at a very early age. Frank's mother, who had raised him as a single parent, died in 1891 and the 14-year-old boy moved into a small apartment with his two older brothers, with his sister leaving the state to live with relatives. He managed to stay in school and work part-time for two more years but finally dropped out of high school to work full-time at the age of 16. Although the nation was then mired in the Panic of 1893, O'Hare managed to find temporary work as an engineers' assistant working for the Union Switch and Signal Company, a company which had been contracted to help with the construction of St. Louis's Union Station. Following a quarrel with one of his brothers, Frank set off on his own, landing a job with a hardware wholesale company.Buckingham, Rebel Against Injustice, pg. 12. It was while working in this capacity that O'Hare's religious upbringing was challenged for the first time by his supervisor, a university-educated intellectual of decidedly socialist inclinations, who introduced O'Hare to the writings of Herbert Spencer, John Stuart Mill, John Ruskin, Edward Bellamy, and Karl Marx. \\"The whole Catholic fabrication fell away like an iceberg shattering in the gulf stream,\\" O'Hare later recalled. =Entering the socialist movement= Walter Thomas Mills, whom Frank O'Hare joined in Kansas in 1901 to teach at a new Socialist Party training school. O'Hare began to read extensively on his own at the St. Louis Public Library, took a class on economics, and attended public lectures addressing various social and political issues.Buckingham, Rebel Against Injustice, pg. 14. During this process of self-directed inquiry O'Hare became acquainted with the writings of George D. Herron, a prominent Christian socialist and advocate of the Social Democratic Party of America (SDP), an organization which O'Hare joined in 1900. Additional socialist information was garnered from a correspondence course provided by Walter Thomas Mills.Buckingham, Rebel Against Injustice, pp. 16-17. O'Hare was fired from his job in 1901 for attempting to aid the Machinists' Union in their organizing efforts, a termination which brought him to a new wholesale position working for Western Electric.Buckingham, Rebel Against Injustice, pg. 15. The new position put O'Hare into contact with union and non-union electrical workers, many of whom were disgruntled with the economic system and receptive to O'Hare's appeals to buy copies of the Appeal to Reason, a folksy mass-circulation socialist weekly published in Southeastern Kansas. A St. Louis speech by SDP nominee Eugene V. Debs during the 1900 Presidential campaign further fortified O'Hare's commitment to that fledgling political organization.Buckingham, Rebel Against Injustice, pg. 19. In the summer of 1901 the SDP united with a faction of the Socialist Labor Party of America to form the Socialist Party of America (SPA). O'Hare would remain an active member of that organization for the next thirty years. In August 1901 Walter Thomas Mills came to St. Louis to invite O'Hare to enroll in the International School of Socialist Economy, a socialist training school to be launched in Girard, Kansas with the financial backing of Julius Wayland, publisher of the successful Appeal to Reason.Sally M. Miller, From Prairie to Prison: The Life of Social Activist Kate Richards O'Hare. Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press, 1993; pg. 21. Graduates of the 12 week program, which emphasized public speaking, debate, grammar, and parliamentary procedure, were expected to be tapped as national organizers for the newly founded SPA.Miller, From Prairie to Prison, pg. 22. Another of the first 24 students at the new school that fall would be Kate Richards, the daughter of a veteran Midwestern religious and political radical. The pair met in a classroom on October 9, 1901, and decided to marry just four days later, Frank O'Hare later recalled.Miller, From Prairie to Prison, pg. 26. The school's term ended on December 30, 1901 and the couple were married on New Year's Day 1902 in the Girard home of Appeal publisher Wayland, with Mills himself officiating the ceremony.Miller, From Prairie to Prison, pg. 27. Following a brief honeymoon the O'Hares went to work as touring organizers for the SPA, traveling from town to town throughout the Midwest and delivering public speeches in an effort to build public awareness and launch locals of the new party. The couple made their first home in Kansas City, Kansas. Frank worked at Mills' training school as an instructor and a party organizer while his wife began work as a journalist in support of the socialist cause.Miller, From Prairie to Prison, pp. 27-28. =National Rip-Saw= =Later years= =Death and legacy= See also * Socialist Party of Missouri Footnotes Works =Written= * World Peace: A Spectacle Drama in Three Acts.

This version of the software is a much more expansive version, containing many new features, three new languages and many more vocals than past software versions combined. History Vocaloid 3 launched on October 21, 2011, along with several products in Japanese product, the first of its kind. Several studios are providing updates to allow Vocaloid 2 vocal libraries to come over to Vocaloid 3. With the launch of Vocaloid 3, a tool that was developed titled VocaListener, a software package that allows for realistic Vocaloid songs to be produced using human singing as a template, currently only supports Japanese vocals. It supports additional languages including Chinese, Korean, and Spanish. It is also able to use plug-ins for the software itself and switch between normal and \\"classic\\" mode for less realistic vocal results. Unlike previous versions, the vocal libraries and main editing software are sold as two separate items. The vocal libraries themselves only contain a \\"tiny\\" version of the Vocaloid 3 editing software. Yamaha will also be granting the licensing of plug-ins and use of the Vocaloid software for additional mediums such as video games. Also, Vocaloid 3 has Triphone support unlike Vocaloid 2 which improves language capabilities. The first Spanish Vocaloids, Clara and Bruno, were released in 2011. New technology is also being used to bring back the voice of the singer Hitoshi Ueki who died in 2007. This is the first attempt to bring back a singer whose voice had been lost, yet it had been considered a possibility since the software was first released in 2004. However, this is only being done for private use. A second attempt was made with the voice of hide, a member of group X Japan, who died in 1998. The software was given a special version called \\"Vocaloid Editor for Cubase\\", this was a special version that would work with the Digital audio workstation. An OS X version of the software called Vocaloid Neo was announced on July 24, 2013. Several voices have since been confirmed for this version of the software. Producers who owned vocals that had Mac versions had their licenses updated to allow Mac installation of those vocals, however only the Windows or Mac install was allowed and both could not be installed under the same purchase. In 2013, the first Catalan vocal project was introduced called \\"ONA\\". A series of resource packs called \\"Vocaloid-P Data series\\" were also released. A total of 4 volumes were released, the series was retired with the introduction of the SE versions of several vocals. In addition, Vocaloid 3, Vocaloid Neo and i-Vocaloid were later given an update which allowed access to a cloud storage system called \\"Vocaloid Net\\". This allowed users to use all 3 versions of the software to access stored files made in any of the 3 software. Vocaloid 3 allowed for more variety of vocals to be produced, including some that Vocaloid 2 could not allow. \\"VocaListener\\", which had been announced during Vocaloid 2, was released as a Job plug-in for the Vocaloid 3 software. Vocaloid 3 vocals were also able to be imported into Vocaloid 4. Products =Mew= Mew was released as a realistic Japanese vocal. She was released on October 21, 2011 as one of the 4 release date vocal. The voice is based on the singing results of Miu Sakamoto.

Mew Neo was later released on August 5, 2013. =SeeU= SeeU was released as the first Korean vocal for the Vocaloid 3 software, being one of the four release date vocals released when the Vocaloid3 software launched on October 21, 2011. She is capable of Korean and Japanese and released by SBS Artech based on the voice of Kim Dahee (Glam). Throughout pre-Vocaloid 3 release promotions, SBS stood by a claim that you can recreate English with SeeU's Korean voicebank, and in Dec 2011 even went so far to say SeeU is actually \\"trilingual\\", although the comment seemed odd as SeeU had only two voicebanks. In Feb 2012 they stated that they were working on a full English voicebank. In August 2012, SBS reported that the recordings for the voicebank had been completed and was now going through a tuning process. Her English VB will be similar to an append and her design slightly adjusted. On February 4, 2013, in response to a Korean fan's question about the progress of English voicebank, SBS posted a reply that the development of English voicebank is on hold. Due to Dahee being incarcerated in 2015, SeeU English is not expected for a long time. =V3 Megpoid= The Vocaloid 2 product \\"Megpoid\\" was updated to the Vocaloid 3 version under the name of \\"V3 Megpoid\\".

Critical reception When reviewing Yohioloid, the Vocaloid 3 software was given a 7/10 by Hollin Jones of the website MusicTech. Jones in his review noted that despite it being \\"easy to use\\" the software had a steep learning curve and investing time and effort was the only way to get results. However, when listing off the pros and cons of the software he did note that Vocaloid was as close to realism that one can get, but he noted it was better as a back up singer. He noted that there was still a great deal of artificiality to the sound and it is not possible to get Vocaloid to mimic a singer like Adele. He felt the Vocaloid software was more aimed at an electronic pop genre and in regards to the Yohioloid vocal itself perhaps aimed at a Japanese market despite the fact Yohioloid was a western built Vocaloid. It was also noted that for English vocaloids Oliver and Avanna, though they were completed a significant delay was reported by studios between the completion of their developments and release. In regards to Avanna, at one point it appeared Zero-G themselves did not know when she was going to be released. Another issue was that Avanna's originally concept was of an Elf as Avanna was aimed to be a fantasy theme vocal, but this was rejected by Yamaha themselves in favour of an anime style of artwork. Previously they had not shown any signs of directing the studios towards one particular direction. The artist of the illustration for Avanna also theorized this had something to do with the large negative reaction that followed the original concept for Spanish vocals Bruno and Clara. Hatsune Miku remained the most popular vocal for the software. Upon release she overloaded the yamaha server as users made activation requests. As well as this, a backlog of 10,000 copies of her software was reported at one stage as supplies failed to meet the demand. The Hatsune Miku v3 product was credited for an increase of Vocaloid related sales by 19.7% in 2014. Sales for English Vocals also picked up and Avanna became the most successful Zero-G Vocaloid ever sold, holding their no.1 \\"Best Seller\\" spot for 2013 and the first Vocaloid by Zero-G to ever claim their no.1 spot. Her vocal would later go on to repeat this in the following years of 2014. She also claimed the no.1 spot for a 3rd year in 2015, but was closely challenged by Vocaloid 4 vocals \\"Dex\\" and \\"Daina\\". IA also proved a highly successful vocal and by July 2015, had 100 million views across all the related videos of her.link Not all Vocaloid3 releases were highly successful, more so then Vocaloid2 releases. In 2014, Crypton Future Media's website Sonicwire gave sales results for 2014, the top rankings contained a mixture of Vocaloid2 and Vocaloid3 releases. The mixed result was not just restricted to vocal package Crypton had developed itself, but reflected in also other studios, as evidence by both \\"Big Al\\", a Vocaloid2 vocal by PowerFX, being on the chart alongside Yohioloid, a Vocaloid3 product also by PowerFX. In 2015, the trend changed in favour of Vocaloid3 vocals, but the chart was topped by Vocaloid4 products.

In 2001 Tim Simpson bought the business from Laura Alexander and changed the name to DiggyPOD. Initially the company was located in Saline, Michigan, and served the markets of Saline, Ann Arbor, and Ypsilanti. DiggyPOD was originally a commercial printing company, serving small to large businesses with their printing needs. In 2003, DiggyPOD was picked for the 2003 Saline Area Chamber of Commerce Enterprise Business Award. In January 2004, Tim Simpson, the owner of DiggyPOD, decided to transform the business from a commercial printing company servicing the surrounding community to a national company in the book publishing industry. In July 2004, DiggyPOD launched a website to cater to the print-on-demand publishing industry. In 2006, DiggyPOD built a new production facility in Saline, Michigan, to increase work capacities. DiggyPOD, in 2008 and 2010, was recognized as a leader in transitioning its business model from a commercial printing company to an on-demand book printing company. In 2012, DiggyPOD sold its commercial printing business and the equipment needed to run the commercial printing to Standard Printing in Ypsilanti, Michigan. This sale of the commercial printing business was used to fund growth of the book printing business and help DiggyPOD moved to a bigger facility in Tecumseh, Michigan in 2013.

He is regarded as one of the finest French jockeys ever. His first win came on Prince Aly Khan's Manchuria on 17 May 1937. In his home country, he won three Prix de l'Arc de Triomphes - on Coronation in 1949, Nuccio in 1952 and, lastly, on Prince Royal in 1964. He also went on to win five British classics - the 2,000 Guineas on Thunderhead in 1952, the 1,000 Guineas and Oaks on Never Too Late in 1960, the 1,000 Guineas again on Hula Dancer in 1963 and, most notably, the Derby on the rank outsider, Psidium in 1961. Psidium had been the less-favoured of two horses from the same stable. Poincelet kept Psidium at the back of the field until reaching Tattenham Corner. He then brought the horse on a path along the outside of the field to win the race. In doing so, Psidium became the longest priced Derby winner for 48 years. Sovrango, the stable's number one horse, finished fourth. After he retired from race riding, Poincelet began training horses in 1971. He died in a Paris hospital on Tuesday, 1 November 1977, aged 57, after a long and painful illness.

During the years 1792-1793, he served in the armies of the North and Sambre and Meuse. Promoted to lieutenant on 1 April 1793, and to captain on 12 February. At the Arlon, he led a vigorous charge against an Austrian cavalry regiment, taking two guns and forced the Austrians into a complete rout. Francois Laroche,\\" in Charles Mullie, Biography military celebrities of armies and naval 1789-1850, Paris, 1852. After 5 January 1798, he resumed his duties in the infantry in the same regiment on 20 April 1799 in the Army of the Danube. In 1800 he campaigned with the Army of the Rhine. In 1803, he joined the Imperial Guard as a captain of the horse grenadiers. As such, he participated in Battle of Austerlitz. There, he served in Michel Ordener's regiment as captain of the second squadron, second company.Paul Lindsay Dawson, Napoleon's Gods: Grenadiers a Cheval de la Garde 1796-1815, Lulu.com, pp. 117-119\\\\. As a result of this battle, the colonel of the First Carabiniers was promoted to General, and Napoleon appointed his brother in law, Prince Camille Borgh√®se as its new chef. The Prince had no experience, having served only as a squadron leader in the mounted grenadiers of the Imperial Guard; Laroche was assigned to assist him in this new position. The Prince's preoccupation as a courtier, rather than soldier, left Laroche, now a major, in virtual command. Borghese's continued dereliction‚Äîhe had not even been at the head of his unit during Napoleon's inspection at Elbing on 8 May 1807‚Äîresulted in the prince's promotion to general and Laroche's assignment to head the command, including a promotion to colonel.Ronald Pawly, Napoleon's Carabiniers, Osprey Publishing, 2012, pp. 7-9. The First Carabiniers were not present at Eylau, having been ordered late to follow the main body of the French Army, and then being ordered to hold a few miles away from the battlefield itself. The French casualties there were great, almost impossible to estimate.Chandler, David (1966), The Campaigns of Napoleon. New York: Macmillan, p 548. The regiment later marched past the frozen corpses of horses and men on the battle field. They caught up with the rest of the French Army in time to participate at Heilsberg, and later at Friedland. He was wounded by a sword blow to the head in combat at Ratisbon on 23 April 1809; subsequently, on 6 July, at the Battle of Wagram, commanding 1st Carabinier Regiment of Bessi√®res's cavalry reserve, his horse was killed under him. He served in 1812 in French invasion of Russia, and in the campaign in Saxony in 1813. He was appointed brigadier general on September 28 of that year; in October, he commanded a brigade in Hanau,The Order of Battle does not specify which troops; it is likely that he commanded one of the 1st Carabiniers-√†-Cheval. And after the abdication of the Emperor, the Restored Bourbons gave him command of the Department of Charente on 23 July 1814.

A force of 16 B26s, 16 Sikorsky H-34s, and other military materiel was hastily shipped in from Okinawa and held ready to operate from the Kingdom of Thailand. After this hasty preparation for bombing in Laos, the debacle at the Bay of Pigs invasion resulted in the cancellation of Millpond. The B-26s were returned to Okinawa. However, the precedent had been set for covert Central Intelligence Agency-sponsored air operations in Laos. Background On 23 May 1950, the United States signed the Pentalateral Agreement committing military aid to French forces in the Kingdom of Laos. Two years later, America was carrying a third of the French costs of the First Indochina War. After the French withdrew from French Indochina, the U.S. picked up the entire Lao budget. After the 1954 Geneva Conference, an appearance of neutrality was preserved by posting \\"civilians\\" to military aid positions. When President John F. Kennedy received his incoming briefing on 19 January 1961, he was warned by outgoing President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Secretary of State Christian Herter that Laos was crucially located in Southeast Asia and must be maintained in the Free World. As a result of these circumstances, the burgeoning Laotian Civil War became a Central Intelligence Agency and U.S. State Department theater of operations. The new president soon approved several covert operations in Laos.Castle, pp. 9‚Äì34.Anthony, Sexton, p. 40. Millpond operations Joint Task Force 116, compiled from all branches of the U.S. military and based on Okinawa, had been alerted for action in Laos. Units of the Seventh Fleet were forwarded to the Gulf of Siam.Castle, p. 29. At a 13 March 1961 meeting, President Kennedy approved recommendations made to him by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The regnant materiel in the proposal was a small fleet of 16 B-26 light bombers, to be stationed in Thailand for aerial interdiction of communist supply lines in Laos. They were to be unmarked, and maintained by the CIA's wholly owned airline, Air America. Programs Evaluation Office officials had assured the president's military aide that the B-26s would suffice to chase the communists from the Plain of Jars.Ahern, p. 53. The B-26s would be accompanied by 16 Sikorsky H-34 helicopters, also for Air America use, also unmarked. Four C-130 Hercules, three Douglas DC-4s, and a Douglas C-47 were part of the anonymous package. The Royal Thai Army would covertly ship four batteries of 105mm howitzers to the Royal Lao Army. The existing advisory groups in Bangkok and Vientiane would be augmented with 100 more U.S. military men. Lastly, an additional 1,000 Hmong guerrillas would be trained by the CIA via Operation Momentum by 1 April.Anthony, Sexton, p. 42. On 24 April, a RT-33 photo reconnaissance craft repurposed from the Philippine Air Force, but with a U.S. pilot, joined the effort under the code name Project Field Goal.Conboy, Morrison, pp, 54, 114. There followed a scramble for aircraft and volunteer air crews willing to operate in secrecy. The U.S. military, thus far restricted to using aerial rockets and machine guns, pressured for permission to use bombs and napalm. On 21 March 1961, the airlift of H-34s from Okinawa began; it ended on 24 March at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base with the turnover to Air America of 16 copters and a mixed bag of 37 U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy pilots. The B-26 Invaders went to Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 42, 46. Major Harry C. Aderholt, already active in covert airlift operations into Laos, supervised them. By 3 April 1961 the Millpond B-26s were manned and ready to fly; another 16 were due on 18 April. Practice missions were flown in four flights of four B-26s apiece. Also on 3 April, 14 of the H-34s began helilift operations east of Vang Vieng, Laos. On 16 April 1961, the Millpond B-26 pilots were commissioned into the Royal Lao Air Force. Their aircraft were loaded with 250 pound bombs, rockets, ammunition, and napalm‚Äîthough the latter was removed by order of Ambassador Winthrop G. Brown. They received an evening briefing, and were ready to fly in the morning. As it turned out, the debacle of the Bay of Pigs Invasion on the other side of the globe caused cancellation of the mission.Castle, p. 35.Anthony, Sexton, p. 47.Conboy, Morrison, p. 52. On 26 April, General Phoumi Nosavan of the Royal Lao Army urgently requested air strikes to ward off threatened communist assaults on Luang Prabang, Pakxan, Vientiane, and Savannakhet. Ambassador Brown did not want to scuttle an upcoming 12 May ceasefire, but felt he would order Millpond bombings if provoked by communist attacks. With this decision, he eliminated the top priority Millpond objective and took up the secondary one of supporting troops in contact.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 49‚Äì50. Meanwhile, the pilots were confined to the air base except for occasional photo reconnaissance by a camera-equipped RB-26. On the second of these, on 1 May, the Millpond RB-26 was damaged by 37mm antiaircraft fire over Nap√© on the Lao-Vietnamese border. The B-26s were then grounded. However, the Invaders never did fly a bombing sortie.Anthony, Sexton, p. 53.Conboy, Morrison, p. 54. In August 1961, the Millpond B-26 force was dissolved and the operation cancelled, with the planes returned to Okinawa and the mixed crew of military and Air America pilots reverting to their former assignments. Despite this unpromising start by Millpond, covert CIA support was becoming the cornerstone of the burgeoning Laotian Civil War.Castle, pp. 35‚Äì36.

Building CAPC interior, one of the two naves, July 2014 The museum is housed in the Entrep√¥t Lain√©, a former warehouse for colonial goods (sugar, coffee, cocoa, cotton, spices and oils) which were then re-exported to northern Europe by Bordeaux merchants.http://www.capc- bordeaux.fr/en/entrepot-laine The warehouse was built in 1824 by the architect Claude Deschamps, known for the construction of the Pont de pierre of Bordeaux. It is built of brick, stone and wood in a style inspired by italian architecture. There are two grand naves that are reminiscent of the Roman basilicas and that are used to present temporary exhibitions. The building was restored by the architects Denis Valode and Jean Pistre in the 1980s, the second project that this architectural team had undertaken. Their treatment was unusual for the time, emphasizing shadows and depth. The designer Andr√©e Putman renovated the interior. The Caf√© Putman, named after the decorator, has a minimalist decor of metal, concrete and natural materials such as teak and wicker. It has a terrace. Since 1981, the building also hosts Arc en r√™ve centre d'architecture, association that organises exhibitions and knowledge exchange about architecture, urban development, landscape and design.https://www.arcenreve.eu/le-projet Centre d'arts plastiques contemporains In 1965 Roger Lafosse created the Sigma Festival in Bordeaux, an avant-garde festival of visual and performance arts. In 1973 he installed Sigma in the Entrep√¥t Lain√©. The Centre d'Arts Plastiques Contemporains (CAPC) was founded by Jean-Louis Froment. In 1973 CAPC held its first contemporary art exhibition called Regarder ailleurs (Look Elsewhere). By 1974 CAPC had moved into the warehouse. The first exhibitions included artists such as Gina Pane, Andy Warhol and Christian Boltanski. They quickly established the venue as one of the leading places dedicated to contemporary visual arts. Two theater companies joined Sigma and CAPC, as well as the architecture center Arc en r√™ve. CAPC presented new avant-garde work in group exhibitions, and was gradually discovered by the public. Mus√©e d'art contemporain Richard Long, permanent land art on the rooftop In 1983 the institution became the CAPC Mus√©e d'art contemporain de Bordeaux (Bordeaux Museum of Contemporary Art). The museum was formally opened on 17 May 1984. During the 1980s the museum put on many exhibitions and events, and also arranged exhibitions in California, Spain and then throughout Europe and Japan with the exhibition of the Sonnabend Collection. American artist Keith Haring had a major exhibition in the museum in 1985, creating a series of ten large paintings, The Ten Commandments, to fit exactly the nave of the museum building. The ten paintings are now part of the Keith Haring Foundations' collection and have been displayed on many other locations since. Haring did leave the museum a mural painting inside the elevator shaft. In 1990 the CAPC Mus√©e and the arc en r√™ve architecture center occupied the entire warehouse, which was reopened after renovations in June 1990. In the years that followed the museum has steadily added to its collection, with assistance from the state. The focus was enlarged from Europe and North America to cover work from Asia, South America and emerging countries. In 2003 the museum was designated a National Museum of France. The CAPC museum presents permanent exhibitions of its collection and organizes large temporary exhibitions on specific themes. It often features artists who work in the Bordeaux region. Since 2000 the museum has frequently been used for exhibitions of music, architecture, cinema, literature or design, and has often put on exhibitions of popular art.

Secret Muses: The Life of Frederick Ashton. Faber & Faber Ltd, London, 1996, p153-155. The ballet reflected the social and sexual manners of Ashston's world, and the limited size of the Mercury Theatre obliged Ashton to understate the dancers' gestures and moves. A Personage is seen at a masked ball with his lady friend. They meet another couple, and they turn out to be his wife and her lover. After some changing of partners, at the end the wife and husband are a pair while the lover and mistress are also united. The black and white costumes (made by Matilda Etches) and scenery (evoking an Arts Club Ball) were by Sophie Fedorovitch, who worked with Ashton on many other ballets during his career, and became, in his words, \\"not only my dearest friend but my greatest artistic collaborator and adviser\\". Marie Rambert recalled going to an ironmongers in Shepherd's Bush to buy corrugated iron for the columns in the set; the full cost of the production was ¬£60. The original cast at the Ballet Club on the 5 March 1933 consisted of Frederick Ashton as A Personage, Alicia Markova as His Lady Friend, Pearl Argyle as His Wife, Walter Gore as Her Lover, Elisabeth Schooling and Betty Cuff as Two Young Girls and Anna Brunton, Elisabeth Ruxton and Tamara Svetlova as Three Ladies with Fans. At the premiere the music was played by Helen Gaskell, Cecil James and Charles Lynch. Poulenc's Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano was composed in Cannes in 1926, dedicated to Manuel de Falla, and premiered in Paris on 2 May that year. The three movements are marked Presto, Andante and Rondo. When he saw the work, Poulenc was enchanted and in thanks gave Rambert an inscribed copy of his Soir√©es de Nazelles.Rambert, Marie. Quicksilver: an autobiography. Papermac (Macmillan Publishers Ltd), London, 1983, p146. After the production left the repertory the choreography was lost and Ashton declined requests to revive the work. David Vaughan comments that Ashton had wanted Poulenc to compose the score for his first ballet, A Tragedy of Fashion, and seven years on \\"was fully in command of the resources that could enable him to realise such a work\\" ‚Äì witty, sophisticated and of its time. Later projects to collaborate between Ashton and Poulenc did not come to fruition.

It is a Luxembourgian, French and American venture produced by Anonymous Content, Vend√¥me Pictures, TF1 Films Production and StudioCanal. The film stars Idris Elba, Richard Madden, Charlotte Le Bon, Eriq Ebouaney and Jos√© Garcia. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 22 April 2016 and 13 July 2016 in France, and on 18 November 2016 in the United States. Plot On the eve of Bastille Day in Paris, American drifter and pickpocket Michael Mason steals a woman's handbag, not knowing that it contains explosives. After taking the cash from the bag, he discards it, caught unwittingly on CCTV as he does so. The bag then detonates and kills four people. Upon being captured by CIA agent Sean Briar, who is being reprimanded for irresponsible conduct on the job, Mason protests that he is not a terrorist, and tells Briar that the bag contained a cell-phone owned by a woman named Zoe. The bomb was set up by a group of corrupt policemen led by Rafi Bertrand, all of them members in the French special force RAPID who intend to pull a robbery at the French National Bank. Zoe was told to plant the bomb at the office of the French Nationalist Party (as part of a diversion for the heist), but after seeing the night cleaning crew arrive, she was unwilling to kill innocents and so abandoned the plan. Zoe's boyfriend Jean, one of the conspirators, allows her to escape, realizing that his compatriots will kill her. The group tracks Zoe's phone to Briar's and Mason's location. Briar engages the conspirators, who subdue him, while Mason escapes. Bertrand's team proceeds to plant fake evidence at a mosque and stir up a nationwide uproar among its Islamic population, using agitating hashtags on the Internet. Chased by the French authorities and Bertrand's forces, Mason is picked up by Briar, who has come to believe his story and intends to clear the case with his help, even against the orders of his superiors. They track Zoe to the hideout of her friend Paul and his motorcycle gang, but the gang firebombs their car to cover their escape. Appropriating another car, they track Paul down to the bar where he works, and Mason instigates a brawl, during which he steals Paul's ID card. Mason and Briar use the card to find out Paul's address, where Zoe is hiding, and manage to gain her cooperation. Zoe leads them to Jean's apartment, where they find his body and an ID and badge identifying him as a police officer. Briar informs his colleague, Karen Dacre, who confers with her French contact, DGSI Director Victor Gamieux, about taking Mason and Zoe into protective custody. However, Gamieux, actually the mastermind of the heist conspiracy, kills Dacre after obtaining the information he needs and sends a pickup team consisting of his henchmen. Briar, Mason and Zoe manage to pick up clues about the men's true allegiance and fight their way out of the deathtrap. Now realizing Gamieux's hand in the game, the three head toward the French National Bank. When a crowd of protestors masses at the front of the bank‚Äîas the conspirators have intended‚ÄîGamieux assigns Bertrand's RAPID team to the building to provide interior security, thus facilitating the digital robbery of its entire monetary reserves (half a billion euros). Upon arriving at the bank, Briar disguises himself as a RAPID officer and manages to gain access to the building before he is found out. Hearing of his predicament over their stolen police van's radio, Zoe and Mason start a riot among the protestors, who storm the bank and overpower the RAPID troopers closing in on Briar. Briar subsequently infiltrates the vault and engages Bertrand and his remaining henchman. Bertrand escapes with the USB flash drive on which the money has been downloaded, but Briar contacts Mason, who steals the flash drive from Bertrand. Upon noticing the theft, Bertrand takes Zoe hostage. Gamieux, trying to salvage his plan, commands a squad of policemen to shoot and kill Bertrand, and Mason escapes with the flash drive. Some time later, Mason, working with Briar and French law enforcement, meets with Gamieux on the pretense of trading the flash drive for a passport and a ride out of the country, leading to the latter's arrest. The charges against Mason are dropped, and he is offered a job with the CIA.

Oil on Canvas, 1950 √ó 2680 mm (6 ft in √ó 8 ft in) Kunstmuseum, Basel. Fate of the Animals is a painting by Franz Marc created in . It is oil on canvas. This work contrasts most of Marc's other works by presenting animals in a brutal way rather than depicting them in a peaceful manner. Marc's strong ties with animals as his subjects remains uncertain, but it is predicted to stem from his childhood dog. Fate of the Animals remains one of Marc's most famous pieces and displays Der Blaue Reiter style that he co-founded with Wassily Kandinsky. The painting currently resides in the Kunstmuseum in Basel, Switzerland. The last third of the painting was damaged in a warehouse fire in 1916 after Marc's death and was later restored by one of his close friends, Paul Klee.‚ÄúAnimal Destinies (the trees show their rings, the animals their veins),‚Äù Kunstmuseum, accessed September 16, 2014. Klee restored the painting using old photographs. He added a brownish tint to the paint creating an obvious variation from the rest of the painting. Scholars have yet to figure out his decision to paint with a brown tint. Many opinions on the subject have been given, although none have been proven. Title and subject The title of the work is known as Fate of the Animals in English. This stems from the German name Tierschicksale which figuratively translates to animal destinies. Paul Klee is also known for suggesting an alternate title: The trees show their rings, the animals their veins. This is from the evident tree rings present as well as the green horse on the right whose veins are visible on its body. On the back of the canvas is believed to be the subtitle of the painting, which translates to \\"And all being is flaming suffering.\\" Fate of the Animals's title derives from the chaotic scene depicted. There are animals scattered throughout the canvas in what is referred to as a post apocalyptic setting. The scene depicts a forest that is being destroyed by the flames that are evident all around. The painting consists of a blue deer in the middle of the canvas, two boars on the left side, two horses above the boars, and four unidentified figures on the right. The four unidentified animals are believed to be either deer, foxes, or wolves. Most scholars believe that the animals are deer based on Marc's older works where he depicts them with the same colors and physical attributes. It is a premonition to World War I that Marc experienced living in Germany. The brutality of the animals lives at the depicted moment reflected what the oncoming war would be doing to the people of the world. The destruction, the chaos, and the sadness that the viewer sees sums up the evident outcome the future war would bring. Techniques The painting contains only diagonal lines. The lack of horizontal and vertical lines throughout the painting along with the deep colors, create tension. This tension further highlights the chaos and violence of the animal's lives. These diagonals are emphasized in three primary ways: composition order, diagonal posture of the animals, and ‚Äúthe animal‚Äôs position in conformity with the diagonals.\\" The diagonals also help with the narration by acting as fire sparks scattering across the canvas. Marc's paintings had a reoccurring theme of colors that represented certain things. Blue would represent males and the severity and spirituality that they held. Yellow would depict females and their sensual and gentle side. Red would represent matter and the heaviness and brutality it held. Franz Marc makes use of these colors in Fate of the Animals to further his ongoing theme of colors. The blue deer in the middle is a male that holds a lot of spirituality. Some scholars believe that the blue deer is seen as a sacrifice, whose color and up-looking posture further prove. Narration A forest fire is shown with many animals in the chaos. The scene starts at the top left corner where there are three main sparks present. These sparks of fire are coming from an unknown source and will begin to ignite more of the fire and most of the animals. Under the horse there are many diagonals painted red. This is the first of the sparks to ignite the ground under the horses. The horse on the left has a face of agony and is crying out. The horse on the right is more accepting of his fate of oncoming death and looks away from the fire. The next spark to hit is the tan line that is right across the blue deers neck. It misses the blue deer and heads towards the boars in the bottom left of the painting. The boars are accepting their evident death from the flame. The boars are turned away from the flame coming straight towards them and they both have a sad face. The last main spark to hit is the larger red diagonal that is behind the blue deer. Again this spark misses the deer and lands to ignite the ground behind him. The main large diagonals going across the canvas from the top middle to the bottom right is a tree. This tree is falling on the deer and his dramatic posture with his head up. It is another acceptance of fate for the animals. The four animals on the right are the only animals that are completely safe from any harm. There are no sparks heading towards them and no trees about to fall on them. There is no certainty as to why these animals were chosen as the only beings safe from the harm of the destructive forest. Marc's depiction of animals Along with Marc's reoccurring themes of colors, he would also depict animals in the same manners. Deer were sacred animals to Marc. He usually painted them, like most of his animals, in a very peaceful manner. His works such as Grazing Horses IV (The Red Horses), The Yellow Cow, and Dog Lying in Snow depict animals in a peaceful setting. Fate of the Animals provides a contrast to his normal depiction of animals, in which he puts his beloved animals in a scene of destruction. The only animal to not remain consistent throughout Marc's works was horses. They ranged anywhere from sacred, aspiring, to human-like and everywhere in between. This could explain why the only animal that shows its veins is one of the horses.

In the late 1880s, he travelled to Rome and Paris, where he studied at the Acad√©mie Julian, worked in the studios of Jules Lefebvre and participated in several Salons. After that time, having become enamored of the French capitol, he alternated his residence between Paris and Rio de Janeiro. In Brazil, from 1893 to 1896, he held the Chair of Drawing at the old \\"Escola Nacional de Belas Artes\\" (now part of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro), substituting for Pedro Weing√§rtner.Info Escola: Brief biography. In 1916, he was appointed to the Chair for drawing from live models. During this time, he also provided illustrations and caricatures for several local publications. As a sculptor, he is best known for his figure of Manequinho (modeled after the Mannekin Pis in Brussels), which is on a public square in front of the Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas clubhouse and has become the club's mascot. He settled in Paris permanently after World War I, but continued to participate in the \\"Exposi√ß√µes Gerals de Belas Artes\\", winning the Grand Gold Medal in 1921.

He is a blogger, vlogger and founder of the Free Mind e-channel, and frequently appeared on several Egyptian talk shows to discuss the rights of nonbelievers during his 10 years as an atheist and activist from 2010 until 2020. On March 30, 2020, four months after completing a 57-day hunger strike protesting for his right to leave Egypt and marry his fianc√©e in Tunisia, Harkan said he had returned to Islam. His first name is alternately romanised as Ahmed and Ahmad, his surname as Harkan and Harqan. Sometimes he used only his first and second name to identify himself as Ahmed Hussein.  Early life and education  Harkan grew up in a Muslim family oriented toward the Salafi movement in Islam. He received religious education from the Islamic scholar Yasser Al Borhamy. He spent a large part of his youth as an ultra- conservative Salafist Muslim fundamentalist. In June 2010, at the age of 27, Harkan decided to break with his past, burn all his religious certificates and start his education from scratch. His mother was in shock when he revealed his atheism, and his sheikh Yasser sent him to a psychiatrist, who concluded Harkan wasn't insane but just an atheist. Yasser rejected the diagnosis and insisted Harkan was \\"sick with doubt\\".  Activism  Since his apostasy, Harkan was among the few non-believers in Egypt who dared to speak openly about being atheist, and he was invited to appear on several Egyptian talk shows to discuss the rights of non-religious citizens. = 2014 assassination attempt and arrest = According to media reports, Harkan and his pregnant wife, Nada Mandour (Sally) Harkan, survived an assassination attempt on the evening of 25 October 2014. Harkan managed to flee with his wife after receiving some injuries and went to the Alhanafie‚ÄìAlajlany police station to report the incident, along with their friend Karim Jimy. The attackers chasing them told the police Harkan had \\"insulted Islam and compared the Prophet to Islamic State\\" on television. Instead of taking action to help Harkan and his wife and his friend, the police officers further assaulted them and they were imprisoned and charged with blasphemy and \\"defamation of religion\\" under article 98 in the Egyptian penal code for asking \\"What has ISIS done that Muhammad did not do?‚Äù on an Egyptian television talk show. Harkan's lawyer was humiliated and kicked out of the police station. After 24 hours in detention, Ahmad and Sally Harkan and their friend Jimy were released, and charges against them were dropped. However, they had to move to a different house to avoid threats and abuse. = Later activism = In the autumn of 2014, Harkan and Mandour launched the Free Mind TV channel, which seeks to promote non- religious liberal ideas. With Harkan as show host and Mandour as camera operator and director, episodes were recorded at a secret location in Egypt, and edited and produced in a studio in the United States by Iraqi producer Khaldoon Alghanimi. Ahmed Harkan discussing sexual repression in the Middle East (2017) On 24 March 2015, Harkan participated in an open discussion between non-religious Egyptians, moderated by researcher Amr Ezzat and hosted by the Religion and Freedoms Forum at the headquarters of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. Ezzat questioned whether Harkan's outspoken atheism on television was an effective method of activism: \\"I advised him [Harkan] not to do so publicly or he would go to prison, but he said society needed such a shock. I wonder if that shock would have a positive impact on the rights of non-believers.\\" Harkan defended his appearance by saying: \\"If all atheists speak out, the state will no longer treat them as an undesired minority.\\" To an audience member who said that atheists would receive more sympathy if they did not frequently \\"insult religion\\", Harkan answered that \\"We have the right to express ourselves,\\" and Ismail Mohamed (host of The Black Ducks) added: \\"Can we first have our rights before we talk about insults and foul language?\\" In October 2019, Harkan was banned from traveling outside of Egypt by National security in Cairo airport when he tried to travel to marry his fianc√©e in Tunisia. He went on hunger strike, ending after 57 days in December 2019. = Return to Islam = On March 30, 2020, four months after completing a 57-day hunger strike protesting for his right to leave Egypt and marry his fianc√©e in Tunisia, Harkan said he had returned to Islam.His announcement on YouTube in Arabic, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVDMMCWJd70  References  Category:1982 births Category:Egyptian atheists Category:Egyptian human rights activists Category:Living people Category:Egyptian former Muslims Category:Critics of Sunni Islam Category:Former Muslims turned agnostics or atheists ","title":"Ahmed Harkan"},{"id":"44598852","text":"thumb Joseph Wampler Vance (May 21, 1841 ‚Äì December 14, 1927) was an American soldier from Illinois.

Ford delivered two pilot vehicles to Camp Holabird, Maryland for testing: the Pygmy and a second vehicle with a body built by the Budd Company. The Budd-bodied vehicle more closely resembled the Bantam pilot and was not tested by the Army. Both the Willys and Ford vehicles were heavily based on the Bantam Pilot design. The Pygmy was hand-built in the Ford development shop in Dearborn, Michigan using parts from Ford's commercial and agricultural lines. It was the first of the pilot vehicles to feature a flat grill with headlamps positioned behind it for protection, an intermediate bow for the canvas top, its fuel tank mounted inside the body under the driver‚Äôs seat, and a two‚Äêpiece opening/folding windshield with a round tubing frame. Another innovation was headlamps positioned on hinged brackets which allowed them to be pivoted to illuminate the engine compartment at night.

First rescue attempt After being authorized to do so by President of the United States Barack Obama, the Pentagon launched a secret mission to attempt to rescue Somers in November 2014, but the mission was unsuccessful. On December 4, they disclosed the fact that this mission had occurred. The mission, an assault on a cave in remote Hagr As Sai'ar District in Hadhramaut Governorate, was successful in freeing six Yemenis, an Ethiopian and a Saudi, but none of the Western hostages, including Somers, were found.\\"US Acknowledges Rescue Mission in Yemen Last Week to Rescue Luke Somers\\", ABCNews.go.com; accessed December 7, 2014. Details surrounding the mission remain classified as of December 4, 2014. It is believed that Somers had been moved from the hostage site before the special operators in the mission arrived there. Previous intelligence indicated that some hostages had been moved several days earlier, but it was not then known if Somers was among them. Death On December 4, 2014, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) threatened to execute Somers within three days if the US government failed to meet unspecified demands. On December 6, 2014, about 40 US special operations forces were involved in the attempt to rescue Luke Somers and Pierre Korkie, a South African teacher also held by al-Qaeda militants in Yemen, which followed US drone strikes in the area. The rescuers, backed by Yemeni ground forces, advanced within 100 meters of the compound in Shabwah Governorate when they were spotted by the militants. A firefight ensued. When the American soldiers finally entered the building where Somers and Korkie were kept, they found both men alive, but gravely wounded. The US forces pulled Somers and Korkie onto V-22 Ospreys, and medical teams began performing surgery in midair. Korkie died during the flight and Somers died after the Ospreys landed on the USS Makin Island. Information \\"indicated that Luke's life was in imminent danger,\\" said US President Barack Obama. \\"Based on this assessment, and as soon as there was reliable intelligence and an operational plan, I authorized a rescue attempt.\\" He condemned the \\"barbaric murder\\" of Somers. \\"The callous disregard for Luke's life is more proof of the depths of AQAP's depravity, and further reason why the world must never cease in seeking to defeat their evil ideology,\\" Obama said in a statement.

He was killed by the explosion of an OF-F1 stun grenade.Same kind as the one that killed Vital Michalon in 1977 during an enormous protest against the Creys-Malville nuclear power plant, according to Reflets.info (in French) The projectile was fired by an officer of the French police and his family are bringing charges against him. Fraisse died at the age of 21 during protests against the construction of the Sivens Dam. Career Fraisse had a degree in Nature Management and Protection, he volunteered as a botanist, and had a precarious employment situation. Music was another of Fraisse's interests; he played the guitar and the didgeridoo, and reggae and blues were the music styles he enjoyed. Death The proposed Sivens Dam project created an ecologist and anti-developmental movement which occupied the wetlands affected, renamed it to \\"ZAD du Testet\\", and opposed the progress of the construction works. Early in the morning of October 26, 2014 there was fighting between the police and the protestors. According to his relatives, Fraisse felt outraged, and ran spontaneously towards a skirmish, when he realized how violent the National Gendarmerie was being against the demonstrators. He was struck by a stun grenade fired by the police and killed instantly. Some minutes later, his body was collected by the authorities. Aftermath After the death of Fraisse, the French government suffered a social and political crisis for over a month, with riots in Toulouse, Albi, Gaillac, Nantes, Paris, Saint-Denis, Rennes, Dijon, as well as other protests against police violence across the country. The ruling Socialist government was criticised by Green deputies for initially making no comment on the death. Bernard Cazeneuve, Minister of Interior, denounced the Greens for blaming the police. The regional council quickly decided to halt construction on the dam. Thierry Carcenac, head of the council, said \\"What happened was terrible and should never happen again.\\" In January 2015, Minister of Ecology S√©gol√®ne Royal announceed that the dam was cancelled. The father of Fraisse stated he would press murder charges against the policeman who fired the grenade which killed his son. Murder charges An internal police investigation in 2014 had cleared the officer, stating he had made the necessary warnings. In 2016, the officer was heard as a witness in the case but not charged. Judges decided in 2018 that the policeman did not fire the stun grenade aiming to kill Fraisse on purpose. They did not dispute that the policeman shot the grenade, but they did not see an intention to kill. The lawyer of the officer said the violence had been proportionate. The family of Fraisse immediately announced that they would appeal the decision. The appeal against this judgement was suspended whilst another legal challenge was made. The family questioned the constitutional arrangement in which police officers acting under civil command could be judged under military law (instead of criminal law) when maintaining public order. The Constitutional Council decided that this was indeed the case in January 2019.

History In October 2014, the first Vocaloid confirmed for the Vocaloid 4 engine was the English vocal Ruby. Its release was delayed so it could be released on the newer engine. A Vocaloid 4 version for OS X has also been released. All AH-Software vocals were also announced as receiving updated packages as well as VY1v4. The update of the AH-Software Vocaloid 2 vocals is related to Windows 10 being released in 2015, and the impact it may have on the Vocaloid 2 software. The Vocaloid 4 engine allows the importing of Vocaloid 2 and Vocaloid 3 vocals, though Vocaloid 2 vocals must have already been imported into Vocaloid 3 for this to work. The new engine includes other features, but not all of them are accessible by Vocaloid 2 and Vocaloid 3 vocals. One of the new features is a \\"Growl\\" feature which allows vocals built for Vocaloid 4 to take on a growl-like property in their singing results. Cross-synthesis was also added, allowing the user to switch between two of a character's vocals built for the same language smoothly using a time-varying parameter. This feature is accessible when using Vocaloid 3 and Vocaloid 4 vocals, but not Vocaloid 2. Cross-synthesis only works with vocals from the same character, making use with packages like VY1v4 possible, but not packages such as Anon and Kanon. Another feature included is Pitch Rendering, which all imported vocals can use. This displays the effective pitch curve on the user interface. Finally, real-time input has been included in this version and is another feature which all vocals can use. VSQX files made for Vocaloid 3 work in Vocaloid 4, but they will not work the other way around. For Japanese users who had bought Vocaloid 3, Vocaloid 3 Editor, (discontinued, integrated on Vocaloid 4) Vocaloid Editor for Cubase (discontinued, integrated on Vocaloid 4) or VY1v3, Yamaha offered a free upgrade for each software. Those who bought the editor after November 10, 2014 were also offered a free upgrade until June 2015. Those who wished to use Vocaloid on a Macintosh, however were offered only the Vocaloid Editor for Cubase as an option; use of the Vocaloid editor on Mac as a normal Vocaloid 4 adaption was not offered. One of the highlights of the cross-synthesis function is that it can produce very different results depending on which vocals are mixed. Megpoid V4's two vocals \\"Native\\" and \\"NativeFat\\" will not produce much difference between them. However, by mixing Megpoid V4 vocals \\"Power\\" and \\"Sweet\\" the function will produce a very different result. When it was first released, it was only available in Japanese or English, despite being fully capable of using Chinese, Korean, or Spanish vocals from Vocaloid 3. This was similar to how with the original Vocaloid software functioned, in that its interface was only in English, despite having vocals for other languages. Despite the release of Vocaloid 4, Chinese vocals Yuezheng Ling and Zhanyin Lorra were also developed as releases intended for Vocaloid 3. For the voice \\"Cyber Diva\\", some long-term bugs were fixed and pronunciations addressed. English Vocaloid libraries now use a new shorter, more effective script. A custom library was made for the vocal, the largest ever made, which caused an issue with the dictionary proxy that was addressed. English vocals now have more clarity, at the price of expressive tones. Due to the mislabeling of certain phonetic symbols, all past English built vocals were reported to have incorrect sounds assigned to certain symbols; this has been addressed with the new script. Several adaptations of the Vocaloid 4 have been released. A Mobile version of the editor was released in 2015. Another adaption of the software came in the form of \\"Unity with Vocaloid\\", a version of the engine which allowed it to synthesis vocals in real-time within the Unity Engine. The job plug-in \\"Vocalistener\\" also received an upgrade, with an upgrade offer for Vocaloid 3 version owners offered. Vocaloid 4 was the last version released under Hideki Kenmochi, as he announced his retirement on January 30, 2015. Vocaloid has continued its development. He was replaced by Katsumi Ishikawa. In addition to the Vocaloid 4, the software itself also saw use in the Vocaloid Keyboard, which had first been announced in 2012, though prototypes of the Keyboard were finally unveiled in mid-2015 though did not see commercial release. Products =VY1v4= The latest version of the VY1 product, VY1v4 contains 4 voices, \\"Natural\\", \\"Normal\\", \\"Power\\" and \\"Soft.\\" VY1v4 was released on December 17, 2014, for both PC and Mac operating systems.

The voice provider is Jenny Shima, who is an American singer, theater actress, and model. A version of this vocal was also added to the Mobile Vocaloid Editor app, making it the first English vocal for the app at the time of release, and for quite a while the only vocal on the English app. Despite this, the app was still using a Japanese interface at the time of release. =Yuzuki Yukari V4= An update on the Vocaloid 3 product \\"Yuzuki Yukari\\", this update, released March 18, 2015, contains three vocals, \\"Jun\\", \\"Onn\\" and \\"Lin\\". \\"Jun\\" being a faithful recreation of the previous vocal, \\"Onn\\" being a soft-type vocal, and \\"Lin\\" being a power-type vocal. The vocals can be purchased individually or as a complete package. In addition, it was announced that all three vocals were would be released for the \\"Unity with Vocaloid\\" version. All three vocals also appeared on the Mobile Vocaloid Editor app, each sold separately. The Yuzuki Yukari voice was later developed into the Vocaloid Keyboard. =Megurine Luka V4X= An update on the Vocaloid 2 product \\"Megurine Luka\\" that was released March 19, 2015, on both PC and Mac. It comes with four Japanese vocals, \\"Soft\\" and \\"Hard\\", as well as E.V.E.C., plus two English vocals, \\"Straight\\" and \\"Soft\\". The \\"E.V.E.C.\\" system adds options to change the tones of the Japanese vocals \\"Soft_EVEC\\" and \\"Hard_EVEC\\" to nine additional Japanese tones: \\"Power 1\\", \\"Power 2\\", \\"Native\\", \\"Whisper\\", \\"Dark\\", \\"Husky\\", \\"Soft\\", \\"Falsetto\\" and \\"Cute\\". \\"SOFT_EVEC\\" and \\"Hard EVEC\\" can be used for cross-synthesis (XSY), giving Luka four possible XSY vocals for Japanese, and two for English.

The voice actor is the Enka singer Sachiko Kobayashi. It came with a special plug-in for Vocaloid 4 called \\"Sachikobushi\\". This adjusts VSQx files to produce a voice like Kobayashi's. This vocal was later also added to the Mobile Vocaloid editor app. = ARSloid = ARSloid was announced in June 2015, and released on September 23, 2015. It is a male vocal based on the singer Akira Kano from Arsmagna. Product comes with three vocals, \\"Original\\", \\"Soft\\" and \\"Bright\\", allowing cross-synthesis to be used. =Ruby= An American female English vocal developed by independent developer \\"Prince Syo\\" in collaboration with Anders of VOCATONE and distributed by PowerFX Systems AB. was released on October 7, 2015. =Kaai Yuki V4= An update on the Vocaloid 2 product released on October 29, 2015. Due to the original voice actor maturing, a new actor was used for this product to make the new samples needed to complete the vocal library. =Hiyama Kiyoteru V4= An update on the Vocaloid 2 product, includes the \\"Natural\\" and \\"rock\\" Voicebanks; released on October 29, 2015. =Megpoid V4= The update to the Megpoid software. There are a total of 10 vocals for this package, the first five, Native, Adult, Whisper, Sweet, and Power are updates on the old Vocaloid3 versions. The last five are new vocals and consist of Nativefat, MellowAdult, PowerFat, NaturalSweet, and SoftWhisper. Megpoid V4 was released as \\"complete package\\" with all ten vocals, or as one of five separate packages with a pair of vocals in each. The five packages are; *Native, containing the vocals \\"Native\\" and \\"NativeFat\\" *Adult, containing the vocals \\"Adult\\" and \\"MellowAdult\\" *Power, containing the vocals \\"Power\\" and \\"PowerFat\\" *Sweet, containing the vocals \\"Sweet\\" and \\"NaturalSweet\\" *Soft, containing the vocals \\"Soft\\" and \\"SoftWhisper\\" The vocals supplied in each package are especially designed to be cross-synthesis friendly, producing the best results such as \\"Native\\" and \\"NativeFat\\". However, vocals used with one package when used with the function with vocals from another package produce a very different result. So mixing \\"Power\\" and \\"Sweet\\" will be almost the equivalent of another vocal library entirely. Released on November 5, 2015. The voice was also featured in use on the Vocaloid Keyboard prototype. Megpoid English is also currently in consideration for an update. Development currently unscheduled but estimated to begin in 2016 or 2017. =Dex= Dex is a male American-accented Vocaloid by Zero-G, and partner to Daina, based on a hound theme and pop-orientation.

It was named by its founder Lydia Welti-Escher (1858‚Äì1891) after the Swiss national poet Gottfried Keller (1819‚Äì1891). Am R√∂merholz building in Winterthur  History  Portrait of Lydia Escher by Karl Stauffer-Bern, Kunsthaus Z√ºrich In a letter dated 6 September 1890, shortly before the end of her tragic life, Lydia Escher (1858‚Äì1891) offered to the federal government a generous donation. The entire Federal Council declared on 16 September 1890 the adoption of the gift. The donation consisted of securities (including shares: 63.5 per cent, bonds: 24.9%, remaining: 11.6%) and land including the Villa Belvoir, which had a total value of 3.46 million Swiss francs at the end of 1890. The donation is managed as a special funds of the Swiss Federation since 1890 under the name (GKS) by the Federal Department of Finance, and the income of the donation has to be used for the purchase of important works of visual art of Switzerland, to ensure that important works of Swiss art not moving out of the country and remain open to the public. The (Welti-Escher Foundation) was officially named (GKS) after Gottfried Keller, to whom her father gave consistent support. According to the will of Lydia Escher, the foundation was managed by the Swiss Federal Council, thus, Lydia Escher wished to accomplish a \\"patriotic work\\". The foundation should also promote the \\"independent work of women, at least in the field of applied arts\\", according to the original intention of the founder. This purpose was adopted ‚Äì but at the urging of Welti not in the deed of the foundation. The Gottfried Keller Foundation became though an important collection institution for art, but the feminist concerns of Lydia Escher but was not met.  Organization  The five members of the foundation are nominated by the Swiss Federal Council every four years. The Foundation Commission () decides on the acquisition of works of art. Either, the foundation pays for a work of art the full purchase price and places it in a museum of its choice, or it is involved in Museum purchases. Nevertheless, the artwork remains the property of the Swiss Confederation.  Objects and locations  Schloss W√ºlflingen in Winterthur St. Georgen Abbey Toteninsel by Arnold B√∂cklin, acquired in 1920 The foundation aims the acquisition of major works of art from Switzerland and abroad, to entrust them as loans to Swiss museums or to return them to their original locations, such as the choir of the St. Urban's Abbey. Among other, the foundation acquired the St. Georgen Abbey in Stein am Rhein in 1926, and since 1960 it also owns the panorama wall painting of the city of Thun. The purchases of valuable interiors, including Schloss W√ºlflingen in Winterthur, Maison Supersaxo in Sion and Freuler Palast in N√§fels, preserved those Heritage objects at their previous environments. The collection comprises more than 8,500 paintings, sculptures and other art objects in around 110 museums respectively locations in Switzerland. The market value of the collection can only be approximately quantified: according to the experts the market value ranges between 500 and 1,500 million Swiss Francs in 2009. The applied federal government financial assets of the GKS was about 4.5 million Swiss Francs at the end of 2007.  Notable acquisitions from outside of Switzerland  From the Gr√∂ditzberg in Silesia, six of the former stained glass windows of the Augustinerkloster Z√ºrich ‚Äì that remains were broken following the Reformation in Z√ºrich, excluded the present Augustinerkirche ‚Äì were bought by the Gottfried Keller Stiftung in 1894. The art dealer Martin Usteri acquired 32 glass panes in 1796, which were sold from his legacy in 1829, and thereafter installed in the today's Grodziec castle. GKS entrusted the six windows to the Swiss National Museum on deposit.  Mismanagement after the death of Lydia Escher  The foundation's assets has diminished in the course of the 20th century, so that it fulfilled its purpose only with additional federal funding. In fact, the foundation's financial problems, as well as the cause to fulfill its purpose according to Lydia Escher's will, occurred also due to mismanagement. So over the years substantial parts of the foundation's assets were destroyed by an unfortunate investment strategy, as well as some of the foundation's former buildings were sold under their market price, among them the locations in Winterthur. These facts were asked by a parliamentary interpellation in 2008 to the Swiss government and answered on 11 December 2009 by the Swiss Federal Council (): The allegations with reference to the Swiss historian Josef Jung may differentiatedly to judge. The Federal Department of Finance had originally fairly high equity allocation, which amounted in 1890 to 63.5% of the securities and, in particular a large stake in Credit Suisse, until 1903 dismantled in favor of bonds to 3.8%. In 1922 the remaining shares were also sold. Whether the sale of all shares was a too conservative investment strategy, is difficult to judge in hindsight; those responsible could foresee neither the 1929 global economic crisis still very good economic development in the 20th century. Placing the mentioned current value of the art collection of the original donation of the 3.46 million Swiss Francs, represents an annual growth rate of the nominal value between 4.3% and 5.3% (based on compound interest calculation). In fact, the long-term security in the real value of the endowment would necessarily implies a growth of capital in the amount of inflation. In retrospect it was very short-sighted to use the annual income of the fund usually in full for the purchase of works of art. In addition, the purchase of the St. Georgen Abbey, proved by the GKS in 1926, is a heavy financial burden due to the high operating costs. In 2009, the currently available capital amounted to 4.5 million Swiss Francs, did not allow to fulfill the will of Lydia Escher. The ordinary annual income of GKS is currently around 215,000 Swiss Francs (interest income on capital and rental income) and covers just the personnel costs of GKS (90 full-time positions; Monastery Museum St. Georgen: 140 full-time positions). Extraordinary income achieved the GKS only exceptionally. New acquisitions occur only sporadically and with very limited resources given by the current financial situation. Thus, the foundation's purpose in the future, requires a financial leeway. The Federal Office of Culture examined ways to expand this maneuver along with the Federal Finance Administration on 1 January 2009. In the center of the considerations ware revenue-side measures to expand the capital base, new opportunities for wealth management as well as a review of the administrative tasks of GKS. In November 2011 the Federal Government relieved the foundation by bearing all costs of the management of the collection, as well as the foundation's secretariat.  Cultural heritage of national importance  The foundation, today based in Winterthur, is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class A object of national importance and named Eidgen√∂ssische Gottfried Keller-Stiftung, Haldenstrasse 95.

He had a particular interest in freshwater invertebrates. He was brought up in southwest England, and educated at Wellington College, Berkshire and Christ's College, Cambridge. Although best known for his work in freshwater biology, his first job (193334) was on a scientific expedition to the Indian Ocean. The resulting volume on starfish (Asteroidea) became part of his PhD thesis. He was awarded his doctorate in 1940. In 1935, he joined the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA). He worked there until his retirement in 1976, broken only by military service during World War II. In 1941, he was commissioned as Lieutenant into the Royal Army Medical Corps,; he subsequently rose to the rank of Major; he addressed problems relating to malaria in Iraq, Iran, India and Burma. In 1946, he returned to the FBA as Deputy Director. His earliest work at the FBA was concerned with Corixidae (water boatmen) and gastropods. He then concentrated on a detailed taxonomic study of the British Ephemeroptera (mayflies), culminating in the publication in 1961 of the first complete guide to their nymphs (most recent edition 1979). During this work, he accumulated much information on the ecology of the various species, especially their habitats and life cycles. His principal locations of study were in Ford Wood Beck, a small stony stream near his home in Outgate near Hawkshead, Cumbria; and in Hodson's Tarn, a moorland lake close to the Windermere Laboratory of the FBA. After his retirement, he continued his studies in the River Lune, which runs through Cumbria and Lancashire. He was a prolific author of scientific papers and books; his Life in Lakes and Rivers (co-authored with E. B. Worthington) was at one time a set text in the Open University. In addition to the teaching he did at the LBA, he was visiting lecturer at Lancaster University (196676) and the University of Toulouse (1968), and visiting professor at Idaho State University (1972) and Ohio University (197677). He was the founding editor (197173) of the journal Freshwater Biology. He was closely associated with the International Association of Theoretical and Applied Limnology, in which he served as General Secretary and Treasurer (195368), Editor (195362) and Vice- President (196872). Among his outside interests, he was a keen sailor.  Selected bibliography  * 1951: Life in Lakes and Rivers (with E. B. Worthington). New Naturalist #15.

The model was first put forward by Guillermo Calvo in his 1983 article \\"Staggered Prices in a Utility-Maximizing Framework\\".Calvo, Guillermo A. (1983). \\"Staggered Prices in a Utility-Maximizing Framework\\". Journal of Monetary Economics 12 (3): 383‚Äì398. doi:10.1016/0304-3932(83)90060-0 The original article was written in a continuous time mathematical framework, but nowadays is mostly used in its discrete time version. The Calvo model is the most common way to model nominal rigidity in new Keynesian DSGE macroeconomic models. The Calvo model of pricing We can define the probability that the firm can reset its price in any one period as h (the hazard rate), or equivalently the probability (1-h) that the price will remain unchanged in that period (the survival rate). The probability h is sometimes called the \\"Calvo probability\\" in this context. In the Calvo model the crucial feature is that the price-setter does not know how long the nominal price will remain in place. The probability of the current price lasting for exactly i periods more is: Pr[i]=(1-h)^{i-1} h The probability of surviving i subsequent periods thus follows a geometric distribution, with the expected duration of the nominal price from when it is first set is E[Pr[i =h^{-1}. For example, if the Calvo probability h is 0.25 per period, the expected duration is 4 periods. Since the Calvo probability is constant and does not depend on how long it has been since the price was set, the probability that it will survive i more periods is given by exactly the same geometric distribution for all i=1... \\\\infty. Thus if h = 0.25, then however old the price is, it is expected to last another 4 periods. Calvo pricing and nominal rigidity With the Calvo model the response of prices to a shock is spread out over time. Suppose a shock hits the economy at time t. A proportion h of prices can respond immediately and the rest (1-h) remain fixed. The next period, there will still be (1-h)^{2} who have remained fixed and not responded to the shock. i periods after the shock this which have shrunk to (1-h)^{i}. After any finite time, there will still be some proportion of prices that have not responded and remained fixed. This contrasts with the Taylor model, where there is a fixed length for contracts - for example 4 periods. After 4 periods, firms will have reset their price. The Calvo pricing model played a key role in the derivation of the New Keynesian Phillips curve by John Roberts in 1995, and since been used in New Keynesian DSGE models. \\\\pi_{t} = \\\\beta E_{t}[\\\\pi_{t+1}] + \\\\kappa y_{t} New Keynesian Phillips curve. ''' where \\\\kappa = \\\\frac{h[1-(1-h)\\\\beta]}{1-h}\\\\gamma. The current expectations of next period's inflation are incorporated as \\\\beta E_{t}[\\\\pi_{t+1}]. The coefficient \\\\kappa captures the responsiveness of current inflation to current output. The New Keynesian Phillips curve reflects the fact that price-setting is forward looking, and what influences current inflation is not only the level of current demand (as represented by output) but also expected future inflation. There are different ways of measuring nominal rigidity in an economy. There will be many firms (or price-setters), some tend to change price frequently, others less so. Even a firm which changes its \\"normal\\" price infrequently might make a special offer or sale for a short period before returning to its normal price. Two possible ways of measuring nominal rigidity that have been suggested Dixon H, Kara E.(2006), How to compare Taylor and Calvo contracts: a comment on Michael Kiley, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, volume 42, pages 1119-1126 are: (i) The average age of contracts. One can take all of the firms and ask how long the prices have been set at their current level. With Calvo price setting, assuming that all firms have the same hazard rate h, there will be a proportion h which have just been reset, a proportion h.(1-h) which reset in the previous period and remain fixed this period, and in general, the proportion of prices set i periods ago that survive today is given by \\\\alpha^{i}, where: \\\\alpha^{i}=(1-h)^{i-1}.h The average age of contracts A^* is then A^*= \\\\sum_{i=0}^{\\\\infty}i. h^i(1-h)^{i-1} = \\\\frac{1}{h} The average age of contracts is one measure of nominal rigidity. However, it suffers from interruption bias: at any point of time, we will only observe how long a price has been at its current level. We might wish to ask what will its completed length be at the next price change. This is the second measure. (ii) The average completed length of contracts. This is similar to the average age in that it looks at the current prices set by firms. However, rather than asking how long was it since the price was last set (the age of the contract), it asks how long will the price have lasted when the price next changes. Clearly for a single firm, this is random. Across all firms, however, the Law of large numbers kicks in and we can calculate the exact distribution of completed contract lengths. It can be shown thatDixon and Kara, Proposition 1 the average completed length of contracts is given by T: T=\\\\frac{2}{h} - 1 = 2.A^{*}-1 That is, the completed length of contracts is twice the average age minus 1. Thus, for example, if h= 0.25, 25% of prices change each period. At any time, the average age of prices will be 4 periods. However, the corresponding average completed length of contracts is 7 periods. Development of the concept One of the major problems with the Calvo contract as a model of pricing is that the inflation dynamics it results in do not fit the data. Inflation is better described by the hybrid new Keyensian Phillips curve which includes lagged inflation: \\\\pi_{t} = (1-\\\\psi)\\\\beta E_{t}[\\\\pi_{t+1}]+ \\\\psi.\\\\pi_{t-1} + \\\\kappa y_{t} Hybrid new Keynesian Phillips curve. This has led to the original Calvo model to be developed in a number of directions: (a) Indexation. With indexation, prices are automatically updated in response to lagged inflation (at least to some degree), which gives rise to the hybrid new Keyensian Phillips curve. The Calvo probability refers to the firm being able to choose the price it sets that period (which happens with probability h) or to have the price rise by indexation (which happens with probability (1-h). The Calvo model with indexation is adopted by many new Keynesian researchersErceg J, Henerson D, Levin A (2000), Optimal monetary policy with staggered wage and price contracts, Journal of Monetary Economics, volume 46, pages 281-313.Christiano L, Eichenbaum M, Evans C (2005), \\"Nominal Rigidities and the Dynamic Effects of a Shock to Monetary Policy\\", Journal of Political Economy, 113, 1-45.Smets F and Wouters R, (2003). An Estimated Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Model of the Euro Area, Journal of the European Economic Association, volume 1, pages 1123-1175. (b) Duration dependent hazard function h(i). A key feature of the Calvo model is that the hazard rate is constant: the probability of changing the price does not depend on how old the price is. In 1999, Wolman suggested that the model should be generalized to allow for the hazard rate to vary with the duration.Wolman, Alexander (1999). \\"Sticky prices, marginal cost and the behaviour of inflation\\", Federal reserve bank of Richmond quarterly, 85, 29-47. The key idea is that an older price may be more or less likely to change than a newer price, which is captured by the hazard function h(i) which allows the hazard rate to be a function of age i. This generalized Calvo model with duration dependent hazard rate has been developed by several authors.Guerrieri, Luca 2006. \\"The Inflation Persistence of Staggered Contracts,\\" Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, volume 38, pages 483-494.Sheedy, Kevin (2010), Intrinsic inflation persistence, Journal of Monetary Economics, volume 57, pages 1049-1061 See also *Taylor contract (economics) References Sources *David Romer, Advanced Macroeconomics, McGraw-Hill Higher Education; 4 edition (1 May 2011) . *Carl Walsh Monetary Theory and Policy (3rd edition), MIT Press 2010, . *Michael Woodford, Money Interest and Prices, Princeton University Press, 2003, .

The story was originally written by John Blackwood and was adapted by Universal City scenario editor, Raymond L. Schrock. Lenore Coffee and John Goodrich are also credited for working on the screenplay. The film stars J. Warren Kerrigan, Anna Q. Nilsson, and Thomas Santschi. It was released on November 5, 1923. Before settling on Thundering Dawn, the film had two working titles; Havoc and The Bond of the Ring.  Plot  A young man by the name of Jack Standish (played by J. Warren Kerrigan) disappears on the eve of his marriage after the discovery of a financial scandal involving his father, John Standish (played by Winter Hall). In order to protect his father from public disgrace, Jack suddenly flees Boston and thus takes the fall. The young Bostonian ends up fleeing to Java and inevitably succumbs to the lure of the tropics. Months later, his fiance, Mary Rogers (played by Anna Q. Nilsson) follows him to Java in hopes of bringing him home. Once Mary finds him, she is faced with the challenge of reviving him, both mentally and physically. Her task becomes more difficult when a native by the name of Lullaby Lou (played by Winifred Bryson), and a Dutch trader by the name of Gordon Van Brock (played by Thomas Santschi) try to interfere with the couple. Mary and Jack are able to escape when a tropical storm hits and spawns a typhoon that destroys the coastal settlement.  Cast  *J. Warren Kerrigan as Jack Standish *Anna Q. Nilsson as Mary Rogers *Winifred Bryson as Lullaby Lou *Richard Kean as The Professor *Thomas Santschi as Gordon Van Brock *Edward Burns as Michael Carmichael *Charles Clary as Morgan Sprott *Herbert Fortier as The Doctor *Winter Hall as John Standish *Georgie Woodthorpe as Phoebe Standish *Anna May Wong as The Honky Tonk Girl  Production  262x262px The typhoon scene at the end of the film was shot at the Garson Studio. Forty-six thousand gallons of water was used, along with twelve wind machines which swirled the water around and flooded the Garson Studio. Harry Garson had eight cameras capturing the scene. Lenore Ulrich, who was the star of a David Belasco film, visited the set on the day they filmed this particular scene and said, \\"It was the most wonderful thing I've ever seen, either on stage or in a studio.\\" Preservation While Thundering Dawn is presumed to be a lost film, a copy of its trailer is held by the Library of Congress.Progressive Silent Film List: Thundering Dawn at silentera.com References External links Film stills at the British Film Institute Category:American films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Lost American films Category:American silent feature films ","title":"Thundering Dawn"},{"id":"44599465","text":"Melchor S√°nchez de la Fuente (born 19 March 1956) is a Mexican politician from the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

Gannon (born December 23, 1947) is a Democratic politician who currently serves as the Palm Beach County Tax Collector. Prior to her election as Tax Collector, she served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 88th District from 2000 to 2002, and the 86th District from 2002 to 2006. History Gannon was born in Xenia, Ohio, and grew up in Mechanicsburg, Ohio, where her father was the President of the Mechanicsburg School Board of Education. She attended Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College before moving to Florida in 1983, and then attended Palm Beach Community College, Barry University, and Florida Atlantic University, studying business administration and political science. Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Suzanne Jacobs was unable to seek another term in 2000 due to term limits, Gannon ran to succeed her. In the Democratic primary, Gannon faced former State Representative Barry Silver, David Niven, Michele Nemo, and Doug Westcott. Gannon initially placed second in the initial primary, receiving 26% of the vote to Silver's 37%. However, because no candidate received a majority, a runoff election was held between Silver and Gannon. She ultimately emerged victorious, winning 52% of the vote to Silver's 48%. In the general election, she faced only independent candidate Stan Smilan, whom she defeated in a landslide with 85% of the vote. When she ran for re-election in 2002, Silver ran against her once again, and because no other candidates filed, the primary was open to all voters. Silver sued Gannon \\"for allegedly defaming his character in campaign literature she distributed\\" two years prior, while Gannon responded by sending out campaign literature \\"pointing out Silver's poor driving record\\" and calling him a \\"negative person.\\" Gannon did not much face difficulty in winning renomination, which she did with 63% of the vote. She was re-elected without opposition in 2004. Palm Beach County Tax Collector In 2006, Gannon initially planned to run for the Florida Senate to succeed Ron Klein, who was term-limited, but dropped out of the race to instead run for a fourth and final term in the state House. However, when John K. Clark, the Palm Beach County Tax Collector, resigned due to poor health, then-Governor Jeb Bush appointed Republican Peter Carney as Clark's interim replacement until a special election could be held. Gannon opted to run in the special election, campaigning on increasing efficiency within the office to improve performance, and defeated small business owner Randy Johnson in the Democratic primary with 70% of the vote. In the general election, she defeated Carney in a landslide, receiving over 60% of the vote. Gannon was re-elected in 2008 without opposition, and in 2012, was challenged by Carney in the Democratic primary. Carney criticized Gannon for \\"long wait times for service\\" in the Tax Collector's office and for problems relating to the poor installation of new software to provide property data. Once again, Gannon defeated Carney in a rout, winning renomination with 87% of the vote. In the general election, she faced no major opposition and won re-election handily.

Biography  Aleksandrs Anto≈Üenko was born in Riga to a large family. Already in childhood, he showed an aptitude for music. In 1998, he graduated from the Latvian Academy of Music, in the class of wind instruments, and in parallel began vocal lessons under Margarita Gruzdeva. She identified him as a tenor, although many believed that the voice of Aleksandrs was a bass-baritone. Anto≈Üenko considers his teacher as his \\"second mother\\" and continues to take lessons from her. He also studied at the vocal department of the Academy of Music in the class of Arvid Luste. In 1997, he began singing in the choir of the Latvian National Opera. In 1998, he made his solo debut as Oberto in Handel's opera, Alcina. Anto≈Üenko works without an impresario, having only an Austrian agent.  Career  Aleksandrs Anto≈Üenko won the Paul Sacher Prize in 2002, and then a Great Music award 2004 at home, in Latvia, for opera productions and a performance of the Verdi Requiem. In 2006, he made his debut as Chevalier des Grieux in Manon Lescaut at the Royal Swedish Opera and the Norwegian Opera, as well as at the Vienna State Opera. In the season 2006-2007, the singer performed the role of Don Jos√© in the Norwegian State Opera (Oslo), Turiddu at the German Opera (Berlin) and the Monte Carlo Opera, and sang the role of Mario Cavaradossi at the festival in Baden-Baden. The tenor has also sung the roles of Gabriel Adorno (Simon Boccanegra) at the Frankfurt Opera and Ismail in Nabucco at the Bavarian State Opera. In the role of Otello, Anto≈Üenko made his debut in the production conducted by Riccardo Muti at the Salzburg Festival in the summer of 2008. He then performed this role at the Rome Opera House. He debuted on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera as the Prince in Rusalka in 2009, with Ren√©e Fleming. In 2010, he was seen as Hermann in The Queen of Spades and Otello at the Vienna State Opera, performed the role of Turiddu in Cavalleria rusticana in Valencia, and the Pretender in a new production of Boris Godunov at the Metropolitan Opera. In 2011, Maestro Muti invited Anto≈Üenko to perform Otello at the Op√©ra Garnier in Paris, accompanied by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He also appeared in a new production of Il tabarro at Covent Garden. He continued his collaboration with the Swedish Royal Opera, where he took part in a new production of Puccini's La fanciulla del West. Notable other appearances include a 2012 performance in Tosca, as Cavaradossi, at La Scala. In the same year, he was seen as Otello at the Royal Opera House in London. In 2013, he appeared in the role of Radames in Aida at the Zurich Opera House. He followed that performance by appearing as Manrico in Il trovatore at the Berlin State Opera.

In 2014, he appeared in Cavalleria rusticana and Pagliacci. He also received an invitation to star in a new production at the Metropolitan Opera of Otello, which opened the 2015-2016 season. The production was notable within American opera circles due to the Met's decision to abandon their tradition of blackface for the role of Otello. Other Anto≈Üenko's performances include Norma at the Bavarian State Opera, Otello at Barcelona's Liceu and Z√ºrich Opera House, and Pagliacci at Covent Garden. In the season of 2019-2020, he was again at the Metropolitan, portraying the role of Radames in Aida, with Anna Netrebko.

The buildings are a Grade II* listed building that since 1984 have been used as a youth hostel. They are thought to be either part of an old Dominican friary, or to have been built on the site of the friary using stone from the site. History of the friary A Dominican friary was first established in Beverley , according to other sources already in 1210. The Dominican order were given an area of land close to Beverley Minster by the Archbishop of York who was the lord of Beverley. On this site the Blackfriars (as the Dominican order were often known due to the colour of their cowls) built their first friary; probably of timber until the cost of stone could be afforded. As the community flourished and money became available, the friary was extended and in the early 14th century and extension to the south west of the cloister saw the construction of a building to accommodate guests was built and it is the foundations of this building that provide the footings for the present day buildings. By the end of the 14th century the friary was at its maximum extent and the next 150 years saw a gradual decline in the fortunes of the friary and a contraction in the use of the buildings. In 1539 the Dissolution of the Monasteries had entered a second round of dissolutions and the remaining friars were expelled in that year and the property wrecked. Many of the buildings were simply pulled down and much of the material used elsewhere although the guesthouse is thought to have escaped demolition because it was not being used directly for religious purposes. An alternative theory for the existence of the current buildings is that they were constructed on the site of the guesthouse using materials recovered from elsewhere within the friary. History since Dissolution In 1544 the guesthouse was sold to John Pope and Anthony Foster. At some later date it was sold again to the Wharton family and later to Earls of Yarborough and in 1826 was acquired by Richard Whiteing whose family continued to own part of the property until 1960. The remainder of the friary was used for a variety of purposes but in the 19th century much of it was built over by the building of the railway between Hull and Bridlington. The guesthouse became, during the 19th century, three spearate dwelling houses, numbers 7, 9 and 11 Friary Lane and continued this use until the 1960s. At this time ownership passed to Armstrong Patents Co ltd who owned the adjacent factory and in 1962 Armstrong's applied for permission to demolish the buildings. Permission was refused and the houses made the subject of a preservation order with preservation work commencing in 1974. The buildings are now owned by East Riding of Yorkshire Council who maintain the buildings with the assistance of the Beverley Friary Preservation Trust. In 1984 the buildings were rented to YHA (England and Wales) who have operated a youth hostel on the site since. Construction Beverley Friary The buildings are a mix of brick and stone construction and stands on the stone footings of one of the earlier friary buildings. Some of the brickwork exhibits a diaper pattern using sunken bricks. The roof is tiled and the internal partition walls are timber framed. Within the westernmost building a number of painted wall plasters dating from about the time of the Dissolution were discovered during the restoration work. A panelled room in the building is dated to the late 16th or early 17th century. 15th century wall painting on the first floor of the friary References ;Notes ;Sources  * Category:Grade II* listed buildings in the East Riding of Yorkshire Category:Beverley Category:Youth hostels in England and Wales Category:Dominican monasteries in England Category:Monasteries in the East Riding of Yorkshire ","title":"Beverley Friary"},{"id":"44599520","title":"Canton of Saint-√âtienne-5"},{"id":"44599532","text":"Robert Calvo is a Vanuatuan professional football manager.

History In December 2010, bassist Frank Swart contacted guitarist Simo about setting up a jam session with drummer Adam Abrashoff, with whom he had played with extensively. After growing dissatisfied with session work and backing other groups, Simo agreed to the jam session. They played for three hours without stopping, after which the group decided to form a band. After recording and releasing their first album in 2011, SIMO toured regionally around the south as well as frequent shows in Nashville. They also garnered some slots at music festivals including Mountain Jam, the Warren Haynes Christmas Jam, and Bonnaroo. 2015 brought the band its first tours out of the south. They opened shows for the likes of Gregg Allman, Deep Purple and participating in Joe Bonamassa's inaugural cruise. Also Elad Shapiro joined in early 2015 solidifying the lineup. The group received standing ovations on the two occasions they played the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville opening for both Allman and Deep Purple respectively.

On the success of their live show, growing fan base and a word of support from their friend Joe Bonamassa, the group ended up signing with Mascot Label Group in June 2015. They finished their second record entitled Let Love Show the Way at the Allman Brothers former residence in Macon, Georgia which was released January 29, 2016 on CD, Vinyl and digital download. The album debuted at number 4 on the Billboard Blues chart in January 2016. The album garnered positive reviews and numerous national and international press coverage from music journals such as No Depression, Rolling Stone, Guitar Player, Relix, Guitar World and NPR. The band was featured on NPR's World Cafe which was broadcast nationally after the initial broadcast in late January on Philadelphia's WXPN. As a result, the band was featured at the annual Non Comm Festival the following June, which garnered positive reviews from their closing set for the convention. The band started its first full national tour in January 2016. Bringing them to over 37 states in just under 4 months, playing over 80 shows. However, in the middle of the tour, they returned a second time to Europe where JD sustained a dislocated knee the first night of the tour in Paris. The show was postponed but the tour resumed the following day with JD having to sit for the rest of the performances. JD finally healed by late May and was able to perform standing again. US touring resumed with opening dates for Blackberry Smoke as well as headline dates including the NYC sell out show at the Mercury Lounge. The group returned to Europe yet again at the end of June to start their 3rd European tour in Italy with 2 shows with Blackberry Smoke. Then their first festival headline slot at Puisto Blues Festival in Finland for over 6 thousand fans. Festival slots at Cornbury Music Festival and Ramblin' Man Fair in the UK, Bospop in the Netherlands, The Guitarra Festival in France and Burg Herzberg Festival in Germany followed. More positive reviews and national press followed as a result of their performances at all these national festivals. The group started another American tour in August, while starting work on the follow up to \\"Let Love Show the Way\\". The wrapped up their last American tour of 2016 in mid October, closing out 128 domestic dates for the year. They embarked on their 4th tour of Europe, their first headlining, on October 28 with a taping of the German television show Rockpalast. They finished the tour with sell out shows in London and Helsinki. At the London show they received the \\"Best Live Act of 2016\\" award from Bluebird Reviews Music Awards.

The group spent over four months total to make their sophomore album Rise and Shine. Taking a completely different approach than any of their previous work, they experimented and stretched to make a highly detailed loosely based concept piece. JD claimed that much of the lyrical content was autobiographical and was hard for him to listen to at times because of its revealing nature. The album was released on September 15, 2017. At the beginning of 2018 JD did his first solo tour in support of Tommy Emmanuel. In the months following, JD continued to perform in a solo capacity with a revolving cast of friends rounding out the lineup. Only Adam Abrashoff remained as the drummer. In August JD announced that his first solo album would be released in early 2019.

He was convicted of misuse of ministerial powers.27 yƒ±l sonra ortaya atƒ±lan ≈üok iddia Early life ƒ∞smail √ñzdaƒülar was born to Ali √ñzdaƒülar and his wife Akile in Demirci town of Manisa Province on September 17, 1950. He was educated in mechanical engineering at Middle East Technical University in Ankara. He completed his postgraduate studies at Indiana University and University of Michigan, USA. He served as the executive at Taksan Co. before he entered politics. Politics career Ismail √ñzdaƒülar joined the newly established Motherland Party (ANAP), which came out as the majority party from the 1983 general election held on November 6. He was elected into the parliament representing his hometown Manisa. Prime minister Turgut √ñzal took ƒ∞smail √ñzdaƒülar into his cabinet formed on December 13, 1983 appointing him as State minister responsible for petroleum supply. In 1985, rumors circulated about √ñzdaƒülar's involvement in corruption. He was accused of allowing shipping of petroleum to a higher cost than usual, and sharing the difference with the shipowner. It was claimed that √ñzdaƒülar received 25 million Turkish lira as part of the bribe. As it came to Prime minister √ñzal's notice, he immediately started a covered investigation by tasking his advisor Adnan Kahveci to bring evidence to him. Kahveci, a technology freak, secretly recorded the conversation on the bribery between √ñzdaƒülar and shipowner Uƒüur Mengenecioƒülu using a cassette recorder, and submitted the voice tape to √ñzal. After listening to the recording tape several times, √ñzal ordered √ñzdaƒülar to his residence, and asked him to resign from the minister post when he managed √ñzdaƒülar to confess the crime. 39 ANAP deputies in the parliament submitted a motion to investigate the corruption case. On May 15, 1985, 311 of the total 400 deputies of the parliament voted in favor of a proposal to send √ñzdaƒülar before the Constitutional Court () for trial. The trial began on May 21, 1985. ƒ∞smail √ñzdaƒülar stood trial along with his father Ali √ñzdaƒülar and his brother-in-law Mehmet Kaymak, who were actively involved in the corruption. Even √ñzal testified in the court against √ñzdaƒülar. The supreme court concluded on February 14, 1986 that ƒ∞smail √ñzdaƒülar is guilty of malpractice, and sentenced him to two years in prison, a fine of 30,000 Turkish lira, a two- year ban from employment in state service and in addition the payment of trial expenses amounting to 281,410 Turkish lira. He was exempted from charges for bribery. On February 24, 1986, √ñzdaƒülar announced his resignation. On March 5, 1986, he was stripped of his parliamentary immunity. He was acquitted of bribe charges, but convicted on misuse of ministerial powers. After serving nine months and eighteen days in prison, he was released on December 30, 1986. Family life √ñzdaƒülar is married to Zahide. They have a son, Mehmet, and a daughter, Asuman √ñzdaƒülar (b. 1974), who is professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT and is married to economist Daron Acemoglu.

The painting was exhibited during the second exhibition of the Deutsche K√ºnstlerbund in May-October 1905 in Berlin under the title Die drei Lebensalter (\\"The Three Ages\\"). Description  The work features three women in varying stages of age, symbolizing the cycle of life. The three women are central on the canvas and are the focal point of the work. The background has a lack of depth, making it look very two dimensional. The colors are neutral and create a restful effect.Eisler, Gustav Klimt,33. Klimt's common use of colorful motifs is also evident in this work. There are two vertical auras that the women are in. The two younger women are in a blue aura that has a fluid pattern of cool colors. The old woman is in an aura by herself, and it is filled with a less fluid pattern with more distinct separations in the design. The colors of this aura are warm, earthy tones that contrast with the cool colors of the other aura. The woman and the auras overlap slightly. The leg of the young woman goes behind the left aura and the old woman's head comes in front of the right aura. The youngest figure, a child, is connected to the young woman who is her mother. They are the only two touching, they also have sheer blue fabric draped down their legs. Both of these women also have their eyes closed. The young woman has flowers around her head which represent spring.Eisler, Gustav Klimt, 33. Her hair is bright an voluminous, contrasting with that of the old woman who is separated from the other two women. Her head is turned away and facing down. The effects of old age are obvious through her sagging skin, bloated belly, and prominent veins. She is also unlike the other two in the fact that both of her feet are shown. This was done so the viewer can see the ugliness of her age in its entirety.Eisler, Gustav Klimt, 44. Klimt, and the Vienna Secession The artist, Gustav Klimt, was a prominent Austrian painter who was born in 1862. He worked as an apprentice of Ferdinand Laufberger during the early part of his art career. Later he was a founding member and the first president of the Vienna Secession from 1897 to 1903. He and fellow artist formed the secession after leaving K√ºnstlerhaus, or the Corporation of Austrian Artists due to differences in views. The Secession held many exhibitions and also founded a magazine titled Ver Sacrum, which translates as sacred spring. Here they published many writers and artists all while sharing the views of the Vienna Secession. Klimt left the Vienna Secession in 1905, the same year that The Three Ages of Woman was completed. Technical elements This is an oil on canvas painting that measures 180 by 180 centimeters. It shows signs of an impasto painting technique that was common of Klimt's work. His painting methods included mixing drying solvents into the paint to make sure there was no unwanted glossy appearance. He also would retouch works, which limited how many paintings he was able to create per year. The Three Ages of Woman falls into Klimt's Golden Period which includes other works such as The Kiss. This period was characterized by high ornamentation and the use of gold and metallic paints. This work also suggest that it is part of the Art Nouveau movement due to the time period and the decorative elements. The Painting is located in Rome at the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna.

Content The song is about people who set their goals so low that they never achieve anything. Seger got the idea for the song from Beautiful Losers, a novel written by Leonard Cohen. Contrary to what many believed, the song is not about Seger himself. It took over a year to finish the song, and Seger wrote three or four versions of the song before settling on one that worked.

It is approximately long and flows through Hazle Township. The creek is affected by acid mine drainage. It also contains metals such as iron, manganese, and aluminum. It is in the drainage basin of the Jeddo Tunnel. Major roads in the creek's watershed include Pennsylvania Route 924, Pennsylvania Route 309, and Interstate 81. At least one bridge has been built over it. The creek has undergone restoration and there are plans to construct an area known as the Cranberry Creek Gateway Park in its vicinity. Course Cranberry Creek begins in a pond in Hazle Township. It flows north for a few tenths of a mile, passing through the Grape Run Reservoir. The creek exits the reservoir on its eastern side and continues flowing north. After approximately a mile, it turns east-northeast for several tenths of a mile. It then turns north and then northwest, passing between the communities of Cranberry and Hollars Hill. Then the creek turns west and crosses Pennsylvania Route 924. It continues west for some distance before turning north and passing between two mountains, flowing parallel to Interstate 81. Some distance later, it receives an unnamed tributary and reaches its confluence with Stony Creek. Hydrology A total of of Cranberry Creek is considered to be impaired by acid mine drainage and flow alterations. It is a major source of acid mine drainage to Black Creek. The creek was listed on the list of impaired streams in 2002. A is considered to be impaired by acid mine drainage, metals, and pH. This stretch of the creek was added to the list of impaired streams in 2004. Cranberry Creek has a total maximum daily load for aluminum, iron, and acidity. However, it does not have one for manganese. The concentration of aluminum near the mouth of Cranberry Creek is 0.96 milligrams per liter and the daily load is . The maximum allowable load is per day. The iron concentration in the creek is 1.83 milligrams per liter and the load is per day. The maximum allowable load for iron is per day. The concentration of manganese is 0.24 milligrams per liter and the daily load of it is . The concentration of sulfates in the creek ranges from 8.5 to 13.9 milligrams per liter, with an average concentration of 11.40 milligrams per liter. The concentration of acidity in Cranberry Creek near its mouth is 6.98 milligrams per liter and the daily load of acidity is . The maximum allowable load of acidity is per day. The concentration of alkalinity in the creek is 1.34 milligrams per liter and the daily load if it is . The pH of Cranberry Creek near its mouth ranges from 4.8 to 5.6, with an average of 5.08. The discharge of Cranberry Creek near its mouth is 1502.67 gallons per minute. However, it has been known to run dry. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Cranberry Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between and above sea level. A reservoir known as the Grape Run Reservoir is located on the upper reaches of Cranberry Creek. The creek also flows through the Hazleton Basin, where it loses its flow due to strip mining, despite remaining intact up to that point. The creek's channel is intact throughout most of the rest of its length, but nearly none of its water leaves the Hazleton Basin. This is similar to the uppermost reaches of Black Creek. Cranberry Creek is one of four streams to successfully exit the Jeddo Tunnel drainage basin, the others being Little Black Creek, Black Creek, and Hazle Creek. Cranberry Creek has been described by Bloomsburg University professor Duane Braun as having \\"sharp, multiple crest hydrography\\". Most of Cranberry Creek's water was redirected to the Jeddo Tunnel until the creek was restored by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation and moved to its original location. Since the restoration of the creek, a series of drainage ditches and culverts have carried water from Pennsylvania Department of Transportation structures on Interstate 81 and Pennsylvania Route 924 to the creek. Watershed The watershed of Cranberry Creek is in the south- central portion of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. It is adjacent to the watersheds of Stony Creek and Black Creek. The watershed of Cranberry Creek has an area of approximately . There are approximately of local roads in the watershed of Cranberry Creek and slightly less than of state roads. Major roads in the watershed include Pennsylvania Route 924, Pennsylvania Route 309, and Interstate 81. 6.5 percent of the watershed's area is barren land. Coal mining lands are prevalent within the watershed. Cranberry Creek is entirely in the United States Geological Survey quadrangles of Conyngham and Hazleton. The creek's mouth is in the former quadrangle and its source is in the latter quadrangle. The creek is near the community of a mining village known as Cranberry. It is also in the vicinity of the city of Hazleton. The creek historically drained the Harwood and Cranberry districts. History Cranberry Creek was added to the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1172617. Cranberry Creek was rendered acidic by sulfur-containing mine drainage as early as the early 1900s. The sulfur pollution came from the Cranberry Mines. The creek was also polluted by \\"strippings\\" from Hazleton. The creek was unsuitable as a water supply at the time for that reason. A sewer system also historically discharged into the creek. Historically, coal mining, including strip mining, was done in the watershed of Cranberry Creek. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation has plans to restore the creek's flow along its entire length. The Jeddo Highland Coal Company has an operation known as the Cranberry Colliery Bank in the vicinity of the creek. This operation's purpose is reprocessing refuse. A 366-acre tract of land near the creek was used for coal mining by the Hazleton Coal Company and the Lehigh Valley Coal Company until 1947. Pennsylvania Route 924 was constructed through this tract of land in 1965. The Community Area New Development Organization purchased the area in 2006 and plans to construct a recreational area called the Cranberry Creek Gateway Park there. During the restoration of Cranberry Creek, nearly of the creek was relocated. The restoration also reclaimed 135 acres of strip mining land. A concrete culvert bridge was constructed over Cranberry Creek in 1967. It is long and carries Pennsylvania Route 924. Biology Cranberry Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery.

He was born at Ongar, Essex, and died at St Mary in the Marsh, Kent. The son of Henry J. Parker who was Gresham Professor of Divinity and vicar of High Halden in Kent, Parker was educated at Maidstone and at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Parker played most of his early cricket as a middle-order batsman, though he rarely seemed to make many runs; an exception was his solitary appearance in the University Match between Cambridge University and Oxford in 1839, in which he made 43, by some distance his best score in first-class cricket. After a solitary appearance for Kent in 1841, the rest of his cricket was played for the amateur Gentlemen of Kent side, and though detailed scorecards from his era are not often available, he seems to have developed as a bowler: against the Gentlemen of England in 1845, he batted at No 11 but took four wickets, though the scorecard also records he bowled 12 wides. It is not known whether batted or bowled right- or left-handed, nor his style of bowling. Parker graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1842. He was ordained as a Church of England clergyman and served as curate to his father at High Halden from 1842 to 1849. He then moved to Old Romney for four years, then to Whitstable and Seasalter, all in Kent, before becoming rector of St Mary in the Marsh in 1857, where he stayed in post until his death 44 years later.

Education Cook graduated in 1999 with a Bachelor of Design in Jewellery from Unitec Auckland where among other tutors she studied with Pauline Bern. Work Cook's work examines the concept of identity and the inherent values attributed to jewellery. She says 'My work references familiar historical jewellery motifs, like the bow, skull, and cameo silhoutte, which balance the personal nature of my subject matter'. In 2002 Cook began working with the cameo form for which she has become known. She has several series of rings, brooches, earrings and necklaces that play with the ideas of cameos, mourning jewellery, and identity. For example, her 'Loved and Lost' brooches from 2006 take the form of updated mourning jewellery, but bear the faces of Cook family pet that have died, and have individual titles such as Lucky Cook', 1982-1991 and Sooty Cook, 1986-1987. Another work, OC v QEII (2006) is a reversible red and white brooch hung from a large bow, with Cook's and Queen Elizabeth II's profiles on either side. Also unconventional is the increased size of the brooches, and the use of brightly coloured acrylic. In 2002 Cook also 'launched' her imaginary company Cook & Co, under which she produced her work for several years. Cook & Co draws a fictional link between Cook and Captain James Cook, and important figure in New Zealand history, and also plays on the name of famous jewellery brand Tiffany & Co. She produces themed branding and packaging that riffs on the branding and marketing strategies of international jewellery companies. Art critic Virginia Were writes 'Cook's autobiographical references and her lighthearted take on the weighty history of jewellery give her work a contemporary edge that propels it way beyond the confines of craft and art'. Cook has exhibited both nationally and internationally. Her solo exhibition Dynasty: Works by Octavia Cook was held at The Dowse Art Museum in 2012. Collections Cook's work is held in numerous collections such as the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Auckland War Memorial Museum and The Dowse Art Museum.

Background Lennie Tristano seldom recorded; this was his first album for Atlantic Records since his eponymous album was released in 1956. That album had been controversial for its use of overdubbing and tape speed alteration; the cover of The New Tristano album contained the words \\"Lennie Tristano is heard on this LP in unaccompanied piano solos. No use is made of multi-tracking, overdubbing, or tape-speeding on any selection.\\" Recording and Music The album consists of seven solo piano tracks ‚Äì six are Tristano originals; the other is the standard \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\". The Tristano compositions are \\"based on standards: 'Becoming' ('What Is This Thing Called Love?'), 'Deliberation' ('Indiana'), 'Scene and Variations' ('My Melancholy Baby'), 'Love Lines' ('Foolin' Myself'), and 'G Minor Complex' ('You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To').\\" The performances are largely improvised. Most of the tracks contain left-hand bass lines that provide structure to each performance as well as counterpoint for the right-hand playing; block chords, unclear harmonies and contrasting rhythms also appear. \\"Scene and Variations\\" differs, particularly in its third part, which does not feature a walking bass line.

The property was developed as a ranch beginning in the late-1860s by John Brockman, who grew corn, alfalfa, and several types of fruit and bred cattle. Cattleman John T. McElroy purchased the ranch in 1927 and hired Trost & Trost to renovate and expand the ranch compound to become the NAN Ranch headquarters. The project included a new house, extensive landscaping, swimming pool, a slaughterhouse, powerhouse, and other residential and ranch buildings. It is historically significant due to its architecture and its role as a major 19th century ranch. Geography NAN Ranch is located along the Mimbres River, less than east of NM 61 and north of Dwyer, New Mexico. History The property, developed in the late-1860s by John Brockman represents 19th century agricultural enterprise and New Mexican architecture in the Mimbres Valley. By 1869, he had cultivated 1,000 acres, operated the first flour mill in the area, and had more than 3,000 head of cattle. He patented his homestead claim in 1881. Archaeologist Adolph Bandelier called the homestead a \\"plazita\\" following his visit in 1883. Considered a \\"model ranch\\" in the Silver City Enterprise, Brockman produced corn, alfalfa, cherries, peaches, pears, grapes, and apples. He was the only supplier of hay to Fort Bayard and Fort Cummings. The Clifton Clarion said in 1886 that he had the best all-purpose ranches in the state of New Mexico. Besides his agricultural pursuits, Brockman bred black and Shorthorn cattle. Brockman sold, what was considered \\"one of the three principal places on the Mimbres\\", in 1901 to the NAN Ranch and Cattle Company, which owned property just north of Brockman's land in Gallinas Canyon. NAN Ranch, which began developing its ranch in the 1880s, then moved its headquarters to the Brockman homestead. John T. McElroy, a cattleman from El Paso, Texas, bought the ranch in 1927. The El Paso-based architectural firm Trost & Trost was hired by McElroy and his wife to complete a US $300,000 ($ today) project to renovate and expand the complex to include a new house, swimming pool, large courtyard and landscaping. The house alone cost $100,000 ($ today). The following year sixteen additional residential and ranch buildings were constructed, including a power plant and slaughter house. It became \\"the best country place\\" built in New Mexico in the 1920s according to Baker Morrow, the landscape architect who consulted for the New Mexico Historic Preservation Division. In 1945 the ranch, that was then 100,000 acres, was sold. In 1988, when it was registered as a historic place, it was owned by W. B. Hinton. By that time the servants quarters building was used for archaeological teams from Texas A&M; University who excavated the property's NAN Ranch Ruin. Archaeologist Harry J. Shafer at the university began working on the excavation of the ruins after having been contacted by Margaret Hinton, who him told of the ruins found on the ranch and the connection to the nearby Swarts Ruin of the Mimbres culture. It was listed on the National Register as part of a 1988 study of historic resources in the Mimbres Valley of Grant County. Description The approximate 18 acre NAN Ranch headquarters contains historic residential, farm, blacksmith, grain silos, and other buildings. The Brockman homestead was built about 1880. The Spanish Colonial Revival McElroy House (1928) has a red clay tile gable roof, stuccoed walls, cast Solomonic columns, exposed wood and cast stone details, and wrought iron fixtures. It has a central octagonal sun room and a sleeping porch. A swimming pool, red clay tile deck, high-walled courtyard, and wooden arbor are near the two main residences. The property is landscaped with cypress, cottonwood, mulberry, and hollyhock trees. Roses, hollyhocks, iris, English Ivy, and privet hedges also feature in the landscaping. Other historic residences include houses for the foreman, gardener, servants and cowboys. The foreman's house is a bungalow and a bunkhouse was built for cowboys. Other buildings include a slaughter house, blacksmith shop and power plant, chicken house, smoke house, laundry, garages, and barns. Irrigation ditches built by John Brockman were modified to concrete irrigation gutters.

Growing up during the Civil Rights Movement era, Ruffin's life experience in Durham has provided him with a black consciousness that helped him analyze and empathize with the difficulty of growing up poor and black in America. This thus motivated, shaped and developed Ruffin's role as an activist, propelling him to assume leadership positions within organizations that ensured social justice and access to opportunities for blacks in the Jim Crow South. Through cultural cohesion, Ruffin created a bridge between his world of black Durham and that of white Durham, integrating minorities to a bigger presence within the Durham community. He achieved success against difficult odds of bridging racial gaps through tackling the role of poverty, effectively bringing better housing, employment opportunities, and educational access to black citizens.  Historical context  The Civil Rights Movement was a time period that encompasses mass social protest in the United States that aimed to end racial segregation and discrimination against black Americans. This period saw a wide expanse of nonviolent protest and civil disobedience, with activities such as boycotts, marches, and sit-ins, including the Royal Ice Cream Sit-In in Durham that resulted in a court case challenging the legality of segregated facilities. Leaders of the black community, like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, began to emerge. Ben Ruffin was a leader of the black community in Durham. Durham was seen as more \\"liberal\\" than other Southern cities.Pauli Murray, Autobiography of a Black Activist, Feminist, lawyer, priest, and Poet (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1987), 108. Racial tensions and conflicts in Durham were often less severe than those in other towns, yet they still existed. Separation and segregation in public life resulted in employment in inferior facilities as well as prejudicial treatment. Many black citizens were left to find work at tobacco plants or to establish their own businesses within black neighborhoods.Grace Walton, \\"Black Women in Durham Politics, 1950‚Äì1996: From Grassroots to Electoral Politics,\\" New England Journal of Public Policy 15, no. 2 (2000): 64. Barred from skilled employment, many suffered from poverty. In addition, the city was split by a set of railroad tracks, dividing the white community and the black community. One side contained beautifully constructed houses while the other gave sight to boarded-up and dirty houses and streets.NCMCC, North Carolina and the Negro (North Carolina Mayors' Co-operating Committee, 1964), 71. Durham segregated the people by their living situations, intentionally disallowing the mingling between whites and blacks. The city thus sustained its discrimination against their black citizens. Durham developed a prominent Civil Rights Movement because of its substantial African-American community. The struggle for civil rights experienced by blacks was greatly impacted by racial injustice and poverty. Ruffin's experience growing up in Durham draws upon both issues, influencing his motivation to become a civil rights activist. Early life and education = Childhood = Benjamin S. \\"Ben\\" Ruffin Jr. was born in Durham, North Carolina, on December 11, 1941, to Benjamin S. Ruffin, Sr. and Catherine Ruffin. Growing up, he lived in a section of Durham called the West End, one of the several black communities in the city. West End was a \\"tight knit community\\" that shared a family-like bond.Jo-Ann, Robinson. 2009. ‚ÄòAn Interpretive Biography of Benjamin S. Ruffin, the First African American Chair of the UNC Board of Governors: How Life Experience Informs Practice‚Äô. When Ruffin suffered from a strangulated hernia as an infant, his neighbor Ms. Arluna Dunn visited and prayed for his healing every day. She would comfort Ruffin's mother by stating that the Lord had shown her that Ben was going to be a leader, a Black Moses to save the people. Eventually, Ruffin healed and developed a close relationship with Dunn. She became instrumental in his life in terms of his spirituality. She constantly sang hymns and quoted scriptures to Ruffin. He maintained a close relationship with her throughout his life frequently bringing back gifts and updates on his life. Since infancy, Ruffin was told that he was special and there was a calling on his life. His family, local community, and church regularly reinforced this confidence for his ambition. = High school and college = Ben Ruffin's experiences growing up in Durham's West End neighborhood during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s largely shaped Ruffin's perspective on educational access and opportunity. Ruffin often talked about growing up in poverty and how his mother would encourage him to excel in school, despite his social status preventing him otherwise.Stagg, Bill, and Jamie Schuman. 2006. ‚ÄòActivist Ben Ruffin Dies at 64‚Äô. The Black Voice News. Brown Publishing Company. December 21. http://www.blackvoicenews.com/news/40290-activist-ben-ruffin-dies- at-64-.html . He graduated from Hillside High School in 1960. After graduating, Ruffin was encouraged to take tailoring classes as \\"no one from Durham's West End goes on to college\\". Ruffin worked in a shop sewing cuffs and listening to black community leaders chat about the happenings in the community as they dropped off their suits. It was during this period that Ruffin learned that \\"we are all standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before us.\\" Ruffin developed the idea of going to college, determined to get involved politically. He continued his pursuit of education and received his bachelor's degree in political science, from North Carolina Central University in 1964.General Assembly of North Carolina. 2007. House Joint Resolution 1289. He later earned a Master of Social Work (MSW) degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Ruffin also received honorary degrees from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Elizabeth City State University, Winston-Salem State University, Livingstone College and Edward Waters College. Civil rights activism = Marches and demonstrations = Upon entering college, Ruffin became involved with community work, organizing marches and demonstrations while rising as a leader. Ruffin was influenced by a speech Martin Luther King Jr. gave at his college, and he decided to organize a group of students to walk down \\"Walgreen's and Kress\\" and \\"not say anything but let our presence be known\\". During this march a white girl spat on the marchers and struck a girl in the arm with a hatpin. Ruffin did not condone fighting back with violence as he wished for his demonstrations to be peaceful. Although he did not advocate for violence, he also did not hide from conflict. Whenever he saw or experienced discrimination against blacks, he voiced his opinions and demanded better treatment. People remember him as a passionate and strong advocate for justice who knew no bounds, had no fears, and accepted no less than equal rights. = Durham housing = In the early 1960s, Ben assumed major leadership responsibilities as the Chairman of the Durham Housing Authority. Directing a group of 21 neighborhood councils, Ruffin worked to improve housing, employment and neighborhoods in Durham. This project promised greater opportunities and improved living conditions for Durham's black residents as many were restricted to substandard housing and the \\"slum life\\".Davidson, Osha Gray. 2007. The Best of Enemies: Race and Redemption in the New South. The University of North Carolina Press. When Ruffin learned that builders weren‚Äôt putting adequate insulation and firewalls into houses, he went to building sites and stated, ‚ÄúI asked for nice homes for my people and you‚Äôre not going to just throw anything together, you‚Äôre going to come back in here and do these walls.‚Äù The builders then corrected their methods, and the houses were built to code. In the late 1960s, Ruffin along with others became major figures in gaining black representation in Durham 's policy-making agencies and protesting inequities in managing the city's public housing. He often helped organize sit-ins and other demonstrations aimed at integrating businesses in Durham. Ben Ruffin's work \\"served as a model for similar efforts across the state and the South.\\" Ruffin is thus largely known for his dedication to the causes of underprivileged blacks. He left a lasting impression on his townspeople as a freedom fighter and someone who dared to challenge the status quo. Continuing his advocacy for justice, Ruffin moved into governmental roles, and later corporate America, creating change from the inside. = Governmental work = In 1977, Ruffin was appointed Special Assistant for Minority Affairs to former North Carolina governor Jim Hunt‚Äôs first administration. During his seven-year tenure from 1977 to 1984, Ruffin was instrumental in increasing the number of black judges in the state and increasing the number of blacks employed in state government, making tremendous strides in including blacks in state governments and political processes. Ruffin successfully contributed to helping black presence become more widespread in governmental roles. Progressively, more black governmental staff became employed such as: Richard Ervin, a Federal Judge and a Supreme Court Judge; a black man on the Utilities Commission; chair of the Parole State Board in the state of North Carolina; a black Deputy Secretary; and Karen Callaway as the first black female judge in Durham County. It is believed that many of his successes he achieved during Hunt's administration were due to his earlier experience as a community organizer. Working for the governor, Ruffin's expanded his horizons seeing poverty and hardship beyond Durham in the surrounding communities. Ruffin noticed that people were living with little help after visiting several North Carolina counties. They were stuck in a negative cycle of poverty. Later on, Ruffin continued his focus on civil rights through tackling poverty for minorities by improving education systems, helping them to develop workforce skills, and increasing their opportunities. = Business career = After serving as special assistant to Jim Hunt‚Äôs administration, Ruffin moved into the corporate business world. Because of his educational background, Ruffin was able to become a successful businessman. He worked as the vice president and special assistant to the president of North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company for two years. In 1986, he was appointed director of corporate affairs for R.J.R. Nabisco, and in 1989, he became Vice President for Corporate Affairs at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. In this position, he led the company with connections to minority businesses, better integrating the presence of minorities within the workforce. Ruffin's transition and rise to prominence in the business environment gave example to the black community of a leader doing well against the odds in corporate America. Rising to the senior-level position of vice president, Ruffin took the same passion and commitment he had in state government to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.Treich, B & Schwelling, B.

With mixed emotions, he retired from his position to focus more attention on his work with the university system as part of the UNC board of governors. = Educator = Ruffin‚Äôs experiences in corporate America positioned him to be appointed to the University of North Carolina Board of Governors in 1991. Previously serving as Secretary and vice-chair, Ruffin was promoted to Chair of the UNC Board of Governors on July 11, 1998. He was the first black to serve as the chairman that oversees the university's 16-campus system. In 2000, he was unanimously re-elected for a second term. He served on the UNC Board of Governors as Member Emeritus until his death in December 2006. Ruffin chaired the UNC Board of Governors from 1991 to 1998. During the time of Ruffin's appointment, the UNC Board of Governors was going through monumental changes. As the policy making body legally charged with the \\"general administration, control, supervision, management, and governance of all affairs of the constituent institutions\\", its board adopted the Long Range Plan in 1976.Scott, Robert. Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 893, Amendment, Governor Scott's Personal Records, Committee on Higher Education I, October 28, 1971, 310, North Carolina State Archives, Raleigh, North Carolina. The Long Range Plan included eight interrelated strategic directions to pursue, all of which would contribute to providing better educational opportunities to North Carolinians.UNC Board of Governors, 1992‚Äì1997 Long Range Planning UNC Board of Governors, Website. Retrieved December 1, from Ruffin began his tenure on the Board of Governors facing challenges of educational access and equity. In receiving his chairman position, Ruffin stated, \\"I always believed education was the bridge to improve the quality of life. More education ‚Äì more opportunity. I believed that if you acquire education, you will have more choices. Poverty equals lack of options. I grew up poor... I know what a university can do, and I know what it did for me personally.\\" His first strategic direction was to increase opportunities for North Carolinians to participate in higher education, consistent with their abilities and needs. This resulted in an increase of demographic diversity within institutions and more minorities being able to receive higher paying jobs. Ruffin \\"spoke his mind\\" and wasn't afraid to give his perspective. He tackled issues particularly on access, affordable tuition, and equal opportunity for all institutions in the system. The election of Ben Ruffin as the first black chair of the Board of Governors was an important victory for the black community as well as the state of North Carolina. The presence of a person of color serving at the highest level of leadership in higher education sent a strong message of inclusion to members of the community. Other notable roles Known and admired around the country, Ruffin is also chair of the corporate roundtable of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators; a member of the N.C. Institute for Minority Economic Development; a member of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation; chair of the board of directors of North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company; and a member of the boards of Mechanics & Farmers.Gilliam, Steve. 2002. ‚ÄòBenjamin S.

History In 1873, town residents debated whether to build and/or repair at least two bridges that crossed the Wildcat River. Honeymoon Bridge was built in 1876, just south of the confluence of the Wildcat with the Ellis River, by Charles Austin Broughton and his son Frank. The Broughton family owned a dairy farm on the east side of the Saco River. Serving in the Civil War, Charles had carpentry skills needed to do the work. In 1899, the town of Jackson paid the Goodrich Falls Electric Company to illuminate the bridge. The sidewalk on the side of the bridge was added in 1930 according to town records, and improvements were done in 1965 to improve visibility and provide parking. In 2001 the bridge received a grant that provided for the installation of a fire protection system that included sprinklers, among other things. Further rehabilitation of the bridge was completed three years later. Today, Honeymoon Bridge is an often-photographed tourist attraction. Honeymoon Bridge is one of 20 examples of the Paddleford truss design. The bridge was nicknamed \\"Honeymoon\\" bridge from the tradition of lovers kissing under it for good luck. The name dates to at least 1936, with bridge historian Adelbert M. Jakeman possibly giving the bridge its nickname. Honeymoon Bridge is designated as Covered Bridge 51 by the state.

Art historian Anne Kirker writes 'This work is made from cement, a medium that enhances the rugged and tough demeanour of the eminent New Zealander.' Duff's work was regularly featured in the Auckland City Art Gallery's survey exhibitions of current artistic practice in the 1960s. She was included in Contemporary New Zealand Painting and Sculpture (1960), Contemporary New Zealand Painting and Sculpture (1962), Recent New Zealand Sculpture (1966) and Recent New Zealand Sculpture (1968) at the Gallery. A major exhibition of her work from 1944 onwards was held at the New Vision Gallery in 1970.

The measure was due to come into effect in April 2017 with the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimating that the policy will impact upon 10% of social housing tenants. On 21 November 2016 the Housing Minister Gavin Barwell announced that the new plans for Pay to Stay would be dropped. Councils maintain the option of charging near market rates to those on incomes of ¬£60,000 or more. Criticism The trade publication Inside Housing has criticised the practicality of the policy given that social landlords do not currently have a mechanism to compel tenants to declare their incomes. Other criticisms of the policy are that it may decrease the total social housing stock by encouraging people to exercise their right to buy and the policy may also disincentivize work if higher earnings will result in a higher rent bill. The Pay To Stay policy has also been criticised as a \\"tax on aspiration\\". It is argued that workers nearing the threshold may reduce their hours to compensate for a pay rises. It is unclear if a bonus or overtime would be considered, in the accessing of the excess rent to pay by the tenant. The 2016‚Äì2017 tax year is the period that wages will be accessed, to determine the excess payment. It has been suggested that a taper may be used, but there is no information as to how this will operate. A taper, for example, may work with every pound earned over the relevant threshold being billed at say 50p. If the market rent were deemed ¬£4,000 more than the current rent a year for the tenant, and that tenant earns ¬£31,000 (outside London) they would pay ¬£500 extra rental a year towards that market rent. This would increase with each pound until the ¬£4,000 \\"shortfall\\" is met. This tenant would have to earn ¬£38,000 before they stopped having their rent increased.

He is best known for the community organizing work he did in Durham, North Carolina as an employee of Operation Breakthrough, and as a co-founder of the Malcolm X Liberation University in 1969.

He served as the superintendent of Milwaukee Public Schools from 1991-1995 and is currently a distinguished professor of education, and founder/director of the Institute for the Transformation of Learning at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\\"BIO.\\" Dr Fuller Website. August 10, 2014. Accessed December 4, 2014. http://howardfuller.org/bio/. Fuller's unique style of activism enabled him to become one of the most significant civil rights leaders in North Carolina from around 1965 to 1975. His evolving, complicated, and at times contradictory ideological positions throughout his career, however, also mirror many of the debates and conflicts of the black freedom struggle of the 1960s, '70s and beyond.  Early life and education  Dr. Howard Fuller was born in Shreveport, Louisiana on January 14, 1941 as the only child to Tom and Juanita Fuller, who were sharecroppers. His parents divorced not long after his birth, and his mother moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin in search of employment. After living with his grandmother, he moved to live with his mother at age seven. He attended St. Boniface Catholic Parochial School for elementary and middle school and North Division for high school. He was the sole black student at St. Boniface. From an early age, he demonstrated leadership qualities, leading \\"the student body of every school he attended\\". He was also a skilled basketball player, and this skill earned him a basketball scholarship to Caroll College in Waukesha, Wisconsin to study sociology. By matriculating, Fuller joined the first racially integrated class at Caroll. He then went on to study at Case Western Reserve University and graduated with a Master's in Social Administration. He also earned a Ph.D. in Sociological Foundations of Education from Marquette University in 1986. Fuller was raised in mixed-income black-majority neighborhoods as well as racially integrated neighborhoods. During his earliest years in Milwaukee, he resided in the sharply segregated northern Near Downtown neighborhood. Historian Jonathan Coleman argued, \\"a community where people went off to work, all sorts of people‚Äîfrom the factory workers who punched in at A.O. Smith and American Motors to teachers and clergymen to doctors and lawyers in fine suits with snappy briefcases. If there were any pluses to segregation, this was perhaps the biggest one‚Äîbecause everybody, regardless of income, more or less lived within close proximity of everybody else, there was a sense of unity, of being part of a larger family a feeling that if a doctor lived next door to you, what was to prevent you from becoming a doctor too?\\". The housing crisis in Milwaukee, arising from an influx of black economic migrants as well as returning white World War 2 veterans, prompted an expansion of the city's public housing program. This \\"‚Ä¶resulted in the building of Hillside Terrace, where Fuller resided throughout his childhood\\". Here, he interacted with both black and white children of diverse educational and wealth backgrounds. Fuller said that it was his unique childhood experience that prompted him to \\"‚Ä¶see all races as equals, hate income disparity, and choose civil rights activism as the only career for [him]\\".  Initiation of Civil Rights Activism Career  It was during his time as a student at Case Western Reserve University that he participated in his first protest ‚Äì a sit-in in 1964 to oppose the construction of a \\"‚Ä¶new public school in a predominantly black area of Cleveland on the grounds that it would surely be segregated\\". Here, he saw a Presbyterian minister get crushed by a bulldozer. Fuller's transition from part-time student activist to black power militant was likely triggered by this incident. He described it as the \\"end of my non-violent career... I mean non violence as a philosophy\\".Merida, \\"Howard Fuller: 60s Activist Still Active\\" as referenced by It prompted him to change the way he looked at the works of Malcolm X. \\"I saw myself as an integrationist and Malcolm was teaching separation. I was for non-violence and allegedly Malcolm was teaching violence. I was for supporting the philosophies of supporting Dr. King‚Äîcalling for ‚Äòloving the enemy'‚ÄîMalcolm was preaching the philosophy that called for tick for tack (sic)\\". In her thesis \\"Never Stop Working: Examining the Life and Activism of Howard Fuller,\\" Sarah Barber writes, \\"After Fuller's experience with the devastating effects of non-violent protest in Cleveland, for him Malcolm X and his philosophies were becoming less frightening and more fascinating\\".  Activism in Chicago  Upon graduating from Case Western Reserve University in 1964, Fuller moved to Chicago to work as a community development specialist for the Urban League and community organizer for the Congress for Racial Equality. More intimate exposure to the plight of inner- city blacks during this experience promoted his ideological evolution. Historian Cedric Johnson writes, \\"His radicalization was facilitated by his immediate experiences as a social worker in inner-city Chicago and the mid-1960s sea change in black public discourse from liberal integration to Black Power militancy\\".  Operation Breakthrough ‚Äì black power phase  Fuller's \\"relentless impatience of youth\\" drove him to move to North Carolina in 1965 and take up a job as the director of community development at Operation Breakthrough (OBT). OBT is an anti-poverty non-profit that places an emphasis on mobilization of communities in need to enable them to empower themselves. OBT was funded by the North Carolina Fund, a state government- sponsored project that provided grants to local anti-poverty organizations. His tenure at OBT proved to be the catalyst that greatly expanded Fuller's influence in the South's civil rights movement, cemented his place as one of Durham's most important black leaders, and pushed the further evolution of his ideology by providing him with the infrastructure to mobilize communities along the lines of his then black power leanings. As the director of community development, Fuller described his responsibility, \\"[was] to stir people out of apathy\\".Durham Morning Herald, August 2, 1966. As referenced by . He did so not by delivering speeches on lofty principles such as equality and fair legal protection but by going door to door in impoverished Durham, NC neighborhoods, asking residents of their troubles, and mobilizing them by appealing to these relatively minor issues, which nonetheless negatively impacted their day-to- day lives. George Esser, the then-head of the North Carolina Fund, summed up Fuller's strategy: \\"Howard soon demonstrated both his charismatic leadership, his appreciation for real community organization; that is, encouraging people to take a hand in their own lives, of neighborhoods to organize and come to the City Council or come to the County Commissioners and demand equal treatment in such mundane things as garbage collection, street lights and street paving and so forth.\\" Howard Fuller explained his method of mobilization and significance of his experience at OBT thusly: \\"It was really in North Carolina that I learned everything that I know today about politics and so forth. And I learned most of it from the people that I was working with ‚Ä¶ I started out doing grass roots organizing at the neighborhood level trying to get streets paved, have houses fixed and get rid of rats. So that really shaped my opinion about the need for power.\\" By \\"disrupting people's inertia\\" and getting them involved in activism of any sort in the first place, Howard could then easily hone his small army into a more cerebral movement. George Esser said, \\"And over a period of time ‚Ä¶ he developed a black community in Durham that was asking for equal treatment of the poor and the middle class black community‚Ä¶\\". Charles W. McKinney Jr. writes, \\"Fuller's ability to both identify and cultivate indigenous leaders throughout town served as the primary catalyst for the success of OBT's efforts\\". Through his efforts at OBT in organizing protests and rallies at Durham's city hall and universities, Fuller earned a reputation as a black power militant. By 1968, this reputation had grown to such an extent that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had started to monitor his activities.  Malcolm X Liberation University ‚Äì Pan Africanist and Marxist phase  On October 25, 1969 sparked by the Allen Building takeover crisis at Duke University, Fuller founded the Malcolm X Liberation University (MXLU)‚Äì a black-only university in Durham, NC intended to, \\"provide a framework within which Black Education can become relevant to the needs of the black community and the struggle for Black Liberation\\". It ceased operation on June 28, 1972 due to political infighting, staff turnover, and a lack of funding. The school's curriculum was influenced by Fuller's black power views as well as his newer pan-Africanist and Marxist leanings. Evidencing the black power and pan-Africanist influences and tying the two together, the idea of MXLU, \\"began innocently, says Fuller, by ‚Äòtaking any subject and putting ‚Äòblack' in front of it. Black history had to be taught, for example, because it was not being passed down within the conventional institutional framework. Inevitably, this led to the need for a historical understanding of the African race, when combined with the knowledge of imperialism exposed by the anti-war movement led the university to a political movement called Pan-Africanism (a global extension of Black Power)\\".Thomas Bamberger, The Education of Howard Fuller, 59. As referenced by . Earlier in 1969, Fuller had declared a focus of the university to, \\"teach here why we must bring down capitalism,\\" evidencing his newly acquired Marxist beliefs. Initial funding for MXLU came from a Durham-based anti-poverty nonprofit called the Foundation for Community Development (FCD), which was in turn funded primarily by the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO). The OEO was a federal government initiative aimed at alleviating poverty throughout the country by providing funding to grassroots-level organizations like FCD. Fuller was the director of training of the FCD at the time that the $20,000 grant was given to MXLU. Controversy engulfed MXLU since before its opening; firstly, the fact that Fuller was an executive in the very organization that gave money to his personal project raised concerns of a conflict of interest and a subsequent misappropriation of funds. Secondly, the OEO-FCD-MXLU chain of funding meant that the government was indirectly financing Fuller's activities. This government funding was taken to be representative of outright government support of violence, for which Fuller had earned a reputation during his OBT days. Historian Charles w. McKinney Jr. writes, \\"with the help of incendiary news coverage in Durham, Howard Fuller became a racial caricature ‚Äì the regional symbol of an ominous, state-sanctioned black radicalism that ran amok throughout the state\\". Many historians believe that Fuller adopted his pan-Africanist and Marxist views during his visit to Africa in which he traveled with black freedom fighters in Mozambique.Thomas Bamberger, The Education of Howard Fuller, 72. As referenced by . However, he traveled to Africa in August 1971, while he had made his pan-Africanist and Marxist remarks in 1969 in the context of MXLU. This means that his transition into believing these ideas happened slowly during his tenure at OBT. It is these beliefs, primarily his Marxist ones, which differentiated his OBT and MXLU phases. Prior to his MXLU days, Fuller had seen the class disparity and the resulting injustices inflicted on the disadvantaged as a function primarily driven by racial discrimination.Oral History Interview with Howard Fuller, December 14, 1996. Interview O-0034, Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007).Oral History Interview with Howard Fuller, March 13, 1996. Interview O-0014, Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007). However, by around 1969, he had started to see class disparity as an original injustice of its own, perpetuated by the wealthy to subjugate the poor regardless of race. These new beliefs had made Howard enemies among Durham's population of wealthy black people. North Carolina Fund staffers in an in-house memo wrote, \\"The city's negro elite were among the most bothered by Fuller\\".Durham Morning Herald, June 18, 1969. As referenced by . With a growing list of enemies and a scandal over the issue of funding for MXLU, North Carolina Republican politicians attempted to seize the opportunity that they had been given in order to reduce Fuller's influence in the working-class black community. South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond urged the director of the OEO, Dick Cheney, to cancel the funding to FCD on the grounds that, \\"funding known militants like Fuller would destroy public confidence in government programs\\". He agreed, and funding to the FCD was halted. Local Durham GOP office holders responded to the OEO's decision by advising them to continue funding programs in Durham but to do so through a more moderate leader. They nominated David Stith, who was another notable local black leader. He, too, engaged in community organization and ran local anti-poverty campaigns. Moreover, Stith was the president of the Southeastern Business College in Durham and had connections throughout the city's business community. Local and national politicians favored him to receive the federal funds because he did not have the stigma of being associated with the black power movement. However, Fuller quickly regained public support by \\"‚Ä¶ excoriat[ing] Stith for befriending Abe Greenberg, a Durham landlord who refused to bring rental properties up to code. A personal friend of Greenberg, Stith tried to arbitrate the dispute between lessor and tenants. Instead, Stith was taken to be Greenberg's vested ally\\". As a result, George Stith was discredited, and local GOP leaders had no choice but to recommend FCD, and therefore Howard Fuller, as the recipient of the OEO grant. MXLU's primary investor after the initial funding from the FCD was the Federation of Pan-African Institutions, \\"a consortium of nation-building elementary, secondary, and higher educational academies dedicated to black cultural nationalism,\\" of which it was a member. The Federation, in turn, was primarily funded by the national Episcopal Church. MXLU received one round of grants from the Church but was denied the second time due to the ideological \\"struggle between the alternative revolutionary college and members of the state's upper stratum of blacks\\". As a result, MXLU lost its ability to pay for the land lease and shut its doors in 1972. Fuller's adoption of more radical beliefs cost him dearly and constantly threatened to eliminate the level of influence he had in Durham and the civil rights movement. Still, he defied strong opposition and managed to maintain significance within the community of civil rights advocates, and in doing so, proved himself to be an adept community organizer, leader, and politician.  Education reform advocacy and present day activities  Reeling from the loss of MXLU, Fuller fell into a spiral of radicalization, culminating in his association with the Revolutionary Workers League (RWL), a Marxist black power extremist group. The RWL held a two-day conference to which Fuller took a group of friends. There, they were, \\"humiliated, mentally tortured and physically beaten by other members of the group\\".Merida. Howard Fuller: 60s Activist Still Active. As referenced by . This experience shocked Fuller out of radical beliefs and prompted him to move back home to Milwaukee. Once in Milwaukee, he initially obtained a job as an insurance salesman, and one year thereafter, he became an associate director of the Equal Opportunity Program at Marquette University. In this capacity, he extended access to the private university to disadvantaged students. A notable early victory in his contemporary moderate education reform advocacy phase was the cessation of the Milwaukee School Board's plan to clear out North Division High School's student body and rebuild the school as a magnet school with a focus on medicine and dentistry. From 1991 to 1995, Fuller served as superintendent of the Milwaukee Public Schools. Today, Fuller continues to advocate for educational system reforms. He particularly focuses on school choice and argues for the dismantling of teacher's unions. His nonprofit, the Black Alliance for Educational Options, promotes school vouchers to enable low-income children to attend private schools. He is a distinguished professor of education, and founder/director of the Institute for the Transformation of Learning at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Ideology  Around the central theme of African American upliftment, Howard Fuller tried many different approaches and methods. At different points in his life, he focused on race, poverty, and class division. During his early black power years, he focused on race. During his Marxist phase, he focused on class division and poverty. Now, he gives all three elements roughly equal treatment. Throughout his career, however, education and black uplift thereby has been the common thread by which his various ideologies and methods have been linked. This is evidenced by his involvement in a range of educational issues starting from the foundation of MXLU to his more recent tenure as superintendent of the Milwaukee school district and ongoing freedom of choice advocacy for schools. In one 1996 interview, he said, \\"it has to do with the nature of the black struggle in the South, in that although there were clearly class issues involved, there was a lot more unity around race that came into play\\",\\"Oral History Interview with Howard Fuller, March 13, 1996. Interview O-0014. Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007).\\" indicating that class was not as important as race. In another from the same year, he said, \\"So, race is right there. Class is right there. There is nothing quaint or redeeming about being poor\\"Oral History Interview with Howard Fuller, December 14, 1996. Interview O-0034. Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007). indicating that he felt class was at least as important as race. While it is unclear exactly how he felt in 1996, it is evident that his priorities shifted during his lifetime. However, the fact that, while shifting, his priorities and approaches always revolved around the central pillar of African American uplift through education sheds light on the interconnected nature of race, education, poverty, and class and clarifies the complexity of racial disparity and inequity.  Impact and significance  Howard Fuller left his mark on North Carolina as one of the most important civil rights leaders the state had seen. It was Fuller's ability to efficiently identify the issues, which, if given attention, will mobilize communities into first demanding solutions to the relatively mundane issues which nonetheless impact their daily lives (such as street paving and rat extermination).\\"Oral History Interview with George Esser, June‚ÄìAugust 1990. Interview L-0035. Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007).\\" July 6, 1990. Southern Oral History Program Collection, Southern Historical Collection, Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Once he had disrupted people's inertia and apathy, it was then easy for him to lead them to demanding greater things like equal legal treatment Though troubled and convoluted, the trajectory of Howard Fuller's career mirrors the history of the civil rights movement as a whole. Like the movement, Fuller's career held many twists and turns. The same ideological infighting (over a disagreement in methods employed to achieve a common goal) that resulted in the assassination of Malcolm X led to the closing of MXLU. The same lack of funds that contributed to closing MXLU forced other civil rights leaders to hold dangerously large gatherings in overcapacity churches. Fuller evolved as the civil rights movement evolved often contained multiple conflicting facets of the movement within him.

She began working in the field of cinema and cinematic production in the seventies. According to Sandra Gayle Carter, author of What Moroccan Cinema? : A Historical and Critical Study, Benlyazid continues to be one of the few Moroccan women in the field. From the start of her career up until 2003, she was the only female filmmaker in Morocco. Benlyazid's films, novel adaptations, documentaries and scripts have garnered much international recognition. She has become known for representing the struggles and obstacles faced by Moroccan women and incorporating her own personal experiences into her scripts and films. Carter further states that the relationships between gender, society, and religion are articulated in Benlyazid's work, which represents women as multi-dimensional and individualist, each defined by their own age, class, and personal and cultural upbringing.  Early Life and Education  Farida Benlyazid's interest in the world of cinema began at a young age, inspired by her mother's intrigue. Her childhood played a role in the formation of her future films. For example, Benlyazid grew up in Morocco speaking with her mother in Spanish and her father in Arabic, resulting in the formation of a multicultural identity. This has shaped her outlook on life and has influenced the majority of her films. Known for her complex constructions of the Moroccan woman in her films, Benlyazid's incorporates several autobiographical components into her scripts. Longing for education and the ability to travel, Benlyazid was restricted by her then-husband who, due to the Moroccan interpretation of Islamic law prior to the nineties, was the only one who could file for a divorce. After a long legal battle, she divorced in 1971 with two children to support. The same year, she left Morocco and moved to France. She first attended the University of Paris VIII where she studied French Literature, and then the √âcole Sup√©rieure des √âtudes Cin√©matographiques (ESEC) to study cinema from 1974-1976. Benlyazid earned her bachelor's degree in Film and Literature from the University of Paris in 1976. She later received her master's degree from the Ecole Sup√©rieure des Etudes Cin√©matographiques in Paris. Immediately following her graduation, she started writing films.  Career  In 1979 Benlyazid's film career began in France where she directed Identit√©s de femmes, a short piece about women immigrants in France. Two years later, when she moved back to Morocco during the time of the repressive Years of Lead, the country had a weak film industry. She joined a group of motivated filmmakers and ultimately began her career as a scriptwriter, producer, documentary filmmaker, assistant director, and a production manager. By 1989, Benlyazid produced her first feature film, A Door In The Sky, though this was not her first cinematic work. In 1981, she produced the film and wrote the screenplay for Cane Dolls (Poupees de Roseau) with her second and now ex-husband Jillhali Ferhaiti and wrote the script for Mohammed A. Tazi's Badis (1986). Three years after her first feature film, she wrote another script for the film Looking for My Wife's Husband in 1992. Since then, Benlyazid has continued to produce, direct, and write both films and documentaries. She has directed a total of six movies, written a total of five movies, produced a total of two movies, and created two documentaries. In 1991 she created her own production company called \\"Tingitania Films,\\" coming from the ancient name of Tangier, Tingis. As a journalist, Benlyazid authored two short stories and has written politically as a journalist and critic in journals and magazines including Kantara, Le Lib√©ral, El Mundo, and Autrement. Her most popular films include Bab al-sama' maftooh (1989), Ke√Ød Ensa (1999) and Nia taghled (2000). Benlyazid remains to be one of few women in Morocco who are directing, producing and scriptwriting for films, as family and social support remain to be a challenge for many hoping to pursue careers in film. At the start of her career, no national film fund existed in Morocco due to a history of colonisation by the French which delayed the nationalisation of the Moroccan film industry, presenting a clear barrier to produce film. According to Florence Martini, Benlyazid is considered throughout the Middle East and North Africa to have challenged traditional institutions and beliefs in Morocco by neglecting to impose any forms of self-censorship when portraying the monarchy or religion. Other obstacles for Moroccan women wishing to pursue film like Benlyazid may include pay, according to Benlyazid herself who claims, \\"We have no market here and it is difficult to get financing. Everytime I apply for a project, I get less money than the men do.\\" = Filmography =  As a scriptwriter  *Arayiss men / Kasab Poup√©es de Roseau / Cane Dolls (1981) *Badis 1564 (1986) *A la recherche du mari de ma femme / Looking for the Husband of My Wife (1993) *L‚ÄôHistoire d‚Äôune rose / A Story of a Rose (2007)  As a director/producer  *Bab al-sama' maftooh / Une Porte sur le Ciel / Door to the Sky (1989) *Aminata Traor√© / Une femme de Sahel / Woman of the Sahel (1993) *Sur la terrace / On the Terrace (1995) *Kayd Insa / Ruses de femmes / Women's Wiles (1999) *Casablanca (2002) *La Vida perra de Juanita Narboni / La Chienne de vie de Juanita Narboni / The Wretched Life of Juanita Narboni (2005) *Casanayda / Casa √ßa bouge / Casa Is Rocking (2007) *Through the Blooming Valley's (2016)  Representation of Women and Islam  Common themes in Benlyazid's films include the multidimensional and complex portrayals of Moroccan women. Scholars such as Sandra Gayle Carter state this representation stems from Benlyazid incorporating her own personal philosophies on gender, humanity, and religion into her scripts and films. Carter argues that although Benlyazid received a Western education, the director's feminist approach to the representation of Moroccan women's struggles is anything but eurocentric. Benlyazid characters, when faced with problems in Moroccan society, resolve them through a form of female liberation rooted in Moroccan culture and beliefs. Her films focus on the role of Moroccan women from the time of Moroccan independence in 1956 through the present day. In most of her films, there is a strong connection between Islam and feminism. Most of her female characters use Islam as a way to guide their own feminist identities and philosophies. In her films, Islam is always portrayed as a soft image and a religion that boasts equality between men and women. She uses common techniques of Islamic feminists in her films, including the rewriting of old myths and stories by giving women their own voices. Her films emphasize the important role of women and their contribution to Moroccan society. Besides gender inequality and gender roles, her films also analyze Moroccan society and focus on issues of social and political power, as well as colonialism. Her films are more popular in Western cultures than in Morocco, so her films subtly critique Moroccan culture, society, and colonialism, but are never directly negative. Her first feature film, A Door in the Sky, a highly debated and controversial film in both the West and in the Arab world, portrays a tension between tradition and modernity and a French and Moroccan identity. According to Mustapha Hamil, in the characters journey of self-discovery and understanding in this film, Islam is shown to be compatible with modernity, as Islamic culture is merged with a feminist consciousness. In this way, both the traditional aspects of Islam and the modern teachings of Western feminism help form and realise the main characters identity as Benlyazid adapts neither a wholly Eastern or Western approach, but rather merges the two. In a review of the film by Viola Shafik in Arab Cinema, History and Cultural Identity, Shafik notes that A Door in the Sky appreciates traditional aspects of Islam and Western approaches to feminism, which in fact have a long-held tradition in Islamic culture and can be used in female self realisation.  Bab al-sama' maftooh  Bab al-sama' maftooh (in English, \\"A Door to the Sky\\") is one of Benlyazid's most popular dramas, produced in 1989. It was released in France, Morocco, and Tunisia. = Summary = The main character in Bab al-sama' maftooh, Nadia, leaves Paris for her native home in Fez, Morocco to see her dying father. At his funeral, she meets a woman, Kirana, who is reciting verses from the Qur'an. Nadia is moved by her readings, and the two women become close friends. Through Kirana, Nadia starts to embrace her Moroccan heritage as well as her Muslim culture and identity as her new Western habits start to recede. The pivotal point in Nadia's reformation is when she breaks up with her Parisian boyfriend. Later, Nadia wishes to turn her father's home into a zawiya (a shelter and spiritual center for women) but her siblings want to sell the home. However, Nadia ends up buying her deceased father's property from her siblings and turns the home in a zawiya. Bab al-sama' maftooh is one of the first post-colonial feminist films. = Analysis = Bab al-sama' maftooh uses Islam as a form of spiritual revelation. The film doesn't approach the religion radically, which allows the film to circulate in Western culture seamlessly. However, Moroccan film critic, Hamid Tbatou, states that some parts of the film are orientalized, and he specifically points out the type of architecture. Since the film plays into Western perceptions and stereotypes, this could potentially be a reason why it's more popular in Western culture than it is in Morocco.  Ke√Ød Ensa  Ke√Ød Ensa (in English, \\"Women's Wiles\\") was produced in 1999, and is one of Benlyazid's most well-known films. = Summary = Ke√Ød Ensa is based on a traditional Andalusian myth. The main character, Lalla Aicha, is a woman who learned how to read and write from her father. The son of the sultan quickly falls in love with Lalla, but he doesn't believe that women are or should be as intelligent as men. To combat this, Lalla sneaks into his home and shaves off his beard to prove that she is capable of being smart and cunning. The two marry, and the sultan's son is still convinced of a woman's inferiority, so he locks her in the basement for three years to punish her for shaving his beard. For the rest of the film, Lalla works to find out ways to outwit him. = Analysis = Benlyazid pulls from a traditional myth as inspiration for this film. She focuses on the retelling of an old myth and works to give women a voice in a culture that believes women are inferior to men. Since Lalla always finds a way to best her husband, she becomes the superior, more intelligent one, proving that women are just as capable as men. In many ways, Benlyazid uses a Scheherazadian method of creating a story where the woman outwits the man in their relationship.

Sida Miscellany 14 Distinguishing Features Vermilacinia cephalota is classified in the subgenus Cylindricaria in which it is distinguished from related species by the thallus divided into tubular inflated or somewhat compressed fan-shaped branches that arise from a central point of attachment and produce soredia, powdery masses of green alga and white fungal cells that erupt through the cortex, which in V. cephalota form pincushion-like heads (capitate) called soralia (soralium singular) because of their regular shape. The cortex is relatively thin, 10‚Äì60 ¬µm thick, and the soralia often have a bluish tint. Additionally, the cortex of a specimen of Vermilacinia cephalota‚Äîthat is kept in a herbarium‚Äîgradually deteriorates, cracking irregularly; the hyphae and crystalline deposits within the medulla then seem to flow out through the cracks like a stuffed animal toy losing its cotton after being torn. This chemical change or efflorescence of the dried thallus eventually makes it difficult to distinguish the original shape of a soralium. This has been attributed to the diterpene (-)-16 Œ±-hydroxykaurane, G., J. Santesson & C. W. Wachtmeister. 1965. Studies on the chemistry of lichens. 20. The chemistry of the Ramalina ceruchis group.

Lichens of California, Oregon and the Rocky Mountains; as far as yet known. J.S. & C.

Normandie, Sr. 2, 4:101‚Äì181. (= Vermilacinia combeoides) under R. ceruchis. His reason for including R. combeoides under R. ceruchis: it ‚Äúis inseparable from South American forms (‚ÄòTerra del Fuego‚Äô, Wilkes exp.).\\" Vermilacinia ceruchis (synonyms, Ramalina ceruchis, Niebla ceruchis), however, occurs only in South America. Tuckerman distinguished Ramalina ceruchis and R. homalea from other species of Ramalina as having ‚Äúmedullary cords free of the cortical layer, and at length axial; or indistinct‚Äù and having ‚Äúspermogones black‚Äù (black pycnidia). This was in contrast to ‚Äúmedullary cords uniting mostly with the cortical layer;‚Äù ‚Äúspermogones commonly pale.‚Äù The former was recognized by Phillip Rundel and Peter Bowler in 1978 as belonging to the genus Niebla that included species from Macaronesia that also had ‚Äúmedullary cords free from the cortex. This was preceded by the names having been placed under the illegitimate genus name Desmazieria.Follmann, G.and S. Huneck. 1969. Mitteilunge uber Flechteninhaltsstoffe. LXI.

Rundel and Bowler had indicated that ‚Äúchondroid strands are not present in the medulla of some species aggregates‚Äù and ‚Äúdoes not warrant further generic separation.‚Äù These species aggregates included the N. combeoides aggregate and the N. ceruchis aggregate.\\"Bowler, P.A. 1981.

These aggregates were collectively treated by Spjut in the genus Vermilacinia based on further differences in the lichen substances, depsides or depsidones as major constituents (Niebla) vs. terpenes as major constituents (Vermilacinia). Spjut recognized three sorediate species in subgenus Cylindricaria, V. cephalota, V. leonis, and V. zebrina. Peter Bowler and Janet Marsh listed V. cephalota as a synonym of Niebla cephalota, but V. leonis and V. zebrina were listed as synonyms of N. ceruchis even though N. ceruchis was indicated by them to lack soredia.Bowler, P. and J.

It differs by the branches appearing slender throughout, usually with regular occurring black spots or bands, and usually without depsidones. Vermilacinia leonis, which has a flaccid thallus much like cooked spaghetti, is found mainly south of the Vizca√≠no Peninsula in Baja California, and also reported to occur in Chile. Two other sorediate species, described in the genus Niebla, one of which is similar to some forms of V. cephalota, was distinguished by dot-like (‚Äúpunctiform‚Äù) soralia that develop on terminal acicular branchlets; another has a flattened thallus similar to Ramalina lacera, but referred to Niebla by the presence of the depside methyl 3,5 dichlorolecanorate;Sipman, H.J.M. 2011.

The plot follows two young Americans living in Germany who must complete a drug theft from a crime boss in order to pay for a medical operation. Collide was first announced in May 2013 as Autobahn, with Zac Efron and Amber Heard set to star. After they both dropped out, Hoult and Jones were cast and filming began in May of the following year. Originally scheduled to be distributed by Relativity Media, the film was delayed nearly a dozen times due to the company's bankruptcy. The film was released in the United States on February 24, 2017, by Open Road Films and received negative reviews from critics. It was also a box office bomb, grossing just $4 million against its $21.5 million budget, and set a new record for second-weekend drop in box office performance. Premise Casey, an American living in Cologne, Germany, works with his friend Matthias for a drug dealer, Geran, as money runners. He meets Juliette, another American, one night while she tends bar at one of Geran's hangouts. Though interested in him, Juliette turns him down when he asks her out, stating that she wants nothing to do with someone who runs in Geran's circles, but to look her up when he gets out. Inspired by the conversation, Casey quits his job with Geran, asks Juliette out, and the two quickly begin dating and move in together. All is well for the pair until Juliette suddenly has a seizure one evening and is rushed to the hospital. Told that her kidney is failing, and because she is not a citizen of Germany that she is unqualified for the transplant treatment, Casey proposes that they move back to America for her treatment. In order to obtain the money for the operation and save Juliette, Casey goes back to work for Geran in order to pull off a large drug theft from Germany's biggest drug dealer, Hagen Kahl.

In 2002 he became deputy editor-in-chief of the Ukrayinska Pravda. Leschenko is famous for his investigative journalism on corruption in Ukrainian politics. In 2010 he joined the movement ‚ÄúStop Tsenzuri!‚Äù (‚ÄúStop Censorship!‚Äù) aimed for the protection of free speech, prevention of censorship and obstruction of journalism in Ukraine. In 2012 Leschenko joined a civil movement ‚ÄúChesno‚Äù aiming for transparency and accountability of government officials. In 2012 was studying in the United Kingdom as a part of the scholarship program of John Smith Fellowship. In 2013-2014 undertook an internship at the National Endowment for Democracy in Washington D.C. through the Reagan‚ÄìFascell Democracy Fellowship. In 2013 he took part in the Draper Hills Summer Fellowship at Stanford University in the United States.

He chaired a subcommittee on International Partnership and Anticorruption Law Implementation as part of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Corruption Prevention and Counteraction. From 2015 to 2016, Leschenko was lecturing journalism at the Ukrainian Catholic University (Lviv) and delivering a course of lectures on anticorruption at National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. In June 2013 Leschenko published a documentary book the ‚ÄúAmerican saga of Pavlo Lazarenko‚Äù based on the US law enforcement agencies‚Äô investigation materials.

He was elected as a member of the Petro Poroshenko Bloc (No 19). In the Ukrainian parliament, he became a member of the Committee on preventing and combating corruption. Leschenko became a member of the Interfactional union \\"Eurooptimists\\". In 2015 Leschenko became a co-author of the bill ‚ÄúThe changes to be made to certain legislation acts of Ukraine about preventing and counteracting corruption‚Äù. The bill foresees a decrease in the risks of political corruption due to complex changes to Ukrainian legislation in the sphere of political parties and pre-election agitation direct financing that increases parties‚Äô financial dependency. The bill was a part of the ‚Äúvisa free package‚Äù laws, necessary for the liberalization of visa free regime for Ukraine. On 26 November 2015, Leschenko presented the documents that he believed had justified the criminal case in Switzerland on bribery and money laundering. The case was begun against then people's deputy from the ‚ÄúPeople's Front‚Äù party Mykola Martynenko. Due to the data provided, Mykola Martynenko was placed under investigation. In fall 2017 together with other people's deputies and civil society representatives, Leschenko held an agitation campaign in support of ‚ÄúVseukrayinskyi zbir‚Äù initiative, which had its focus on ‚Äúa large political reform‚Äù. The main points of the reform were a creation of an anticorruption court, abolition of deputies‚Äô immunity, a switch to a proportional representation election system with open lists. Serhiy advocates for putting a limit on pre-electoral agitation campaigns on television, which will increase the candidates‚Äô ability to compete. In 2017 Leschenko publicly revealed that Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yuriy Lutsenko had not been receiving members of the public as was required by legislation. This caused the Prosecutor General to start receiving members of the public. After election to the Verkhovna Rada, Leschenko gradually began to criticize the Petro Poroshenko Bloc (PPB) more and more and stopped voting in sync with it. According to deputy head of the PPB faction Oleksiy Honcharenko, by February 2019 Leschenko had not attended PPB faction meetings for several years. Leshchenko, Naim and Zalishchuk leave the BPP. Why now and what's next?, BBC Ukrainian (28 February 2019) Three MPs intend to leave BPP parliamentary faction, Ukrinform (28 February 2019) On 28 February 2019, Leschenko voluntarily left the Petro Poroshenko Bloc ‚ÄúSolidarity‚Äù faction. In April 2019 Leschenko advised the newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's transition team. But he has since been distanced by the administration and Zelensky himself. On 29 May 2019 Leschenko stated he wanted to take part in the July 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election for the party Servant of the People but this party stated on 7 June 2019 that no incumbent MPs would be on its party list for the 2019 parliamentary election. https://m.glavcom.ua/country/society/leshchenka- ne-vzyali-u-spisok-partiji-sluga-narodu-600253.html Instead Leschenko tried to win back his seat in the 220th electoral district in Kyiv. https://m.glavcom.ua/kyiv/publications/mamahohotala-kogo-sluga-narodu- vidpraviv-na-mazhoritarku-u-kijevi-ta-oblasti-604497.html But Leschenko failed to do this, taking third place with 11.98% (7,775 votes).

At that time, the cost of the apartment was UAH 12.864 million (USD 480 thousand). Other sources say that the apartment is worth UAH 7.5 million. According to Leshchenko, half of the amount was borrowed from the chief editor of the Ukrayinska Pravda Olena Prytula, in the form of an interest-free cash loan for 10 years, the rest was personal funds of Leschenko and his girlfriend, famous Ukrainian DJ Anastasiya Topolska. This apartment purchase has caused a great public outcry. Criticism has undergone both the fact of luxury purchasing, as well as sources of financing. On 19 September 2016, NABU reported an administrative violation with signs of corruption in the Leschenko case: Pritula's loan could be qualified as a gift, and its receipt contradicts the Ukrainian anti-corruption legislation (restriction on the receipt of gifts by deputies). In addition, USD 77 thousand were spent from the deposits of Serhiy Leschenko's mother, which wasn't stated in the deputy's declaration as his own funds. On 15 February 2017, Pechersky District Court of Kyiv closed an administrative case, not finding corpus delicti in Leschenko's actions. Judge Volodymyr Karaban π, who made the court decision, together with his family members, was repeatedly involved in scandals. = Fight at the Verkhovna Rada = On 9 February 2017, people's deputy from the Petro Poroshenko Bloc Ivan Melnychuk started a verbal dispute with Serhiy Leschenko in the session hall of the Verkhovna Rada. The dispute started over a Facebook post written by Leschenko, wherein he claimed deputies from PPB faction were purposely deteriorating the anticorruption committee meetings so that they could accuse the committee of being a failure later. Ivan Melnychuk used physical force and damaged Leschenko's suit. =Case of Paul Manafort= In August 2016, Serhiy Leshchenko announced that the Party of Regions, shortly before Viktor Yanukovych‚Äôs election as the President of Ukraine, paid to the American political consultant Paul Manafort for his services. According to Leshchenko, the expenses of Ukraine related to his activities exceeded $ 12 million. In February 2017, correspondence between allegedly Leshchenko and Paul Manafort's daughter Jess appeared on the Internet. This correspondence, posted by anonymous hackers in English with grammatical errors, was perceived by one Russian media outlet as blackmail. Manafort confirmed the authenticity of the texts hacked from his daughter‚Äôs phone. He added that he had received similar texts to his own phone number from the same address appearing to be affiliated with Leshchenko. He also said he did not respond directly to those letters, but resend them to his lawyer. Manafort refused to show these messages to journalists. In March 2017, Leshchenko surrendered to the NABU documents that, presumably, could prove Manafort‚Äôs involvement in offshore schemes. These documents showed a $750,000 payment for the supply of 501 computers to a company David Manafort, from a Belize-registered offshore company, through a bank in Kyrgyzstan. Leshchenko urged to begin an investigation of this situation both in Ukraine and in the USA. In March 2019, Manafort \\"was convicted on eight criminal counts including bank fraud, tax fraud and failing to file a foreign bank account report.\\" Together with the court sentence of 2018, the total sentence of Manafort was 7.5 years. At the beginning of Donald Trump's presidency, Manafort demanded that the White House and Donald Trump actively pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate and discredit Leshchenko because Leshchenko had published information highly critical of Manafort's political consulting work in Ukraine. Manafort provided information to Rudy Giuliani to smear Leshchenko and entered into a joint legal defense agreement between Manafort's attorneys and Trump's attorneys. Manafort and Giuliani also discussed how to deal with Marie Yovanovitch. On 10 May 2019, 107th Mayor of New York City and attorney to US President Donald Trump, Rudolf Giuliani, announced that he had hoped to meet in Kyiv with Ukrainian president-elect, Volodymyr Zelensky. They planned to discuss foreign countries interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as well as the involvement of Hunter Biden (son of 47th vice president of the United States Joe Biden) at Burisma, a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky. However, the next day Giuliani canceled his trip. Giuliani said that there are enemies of the US President in the election headquarters of Zelensky. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to go because I think I‚Äôm walking into a group of people that are enemies of the president, in some cases, enemies of the United States. And in one case already convicted person who has found to be involved in assisting of the Democrats in the 2016 elections... Gentleman by the name of Leschenko who supplied a Blackbook,‚Äù said Giuliani in an interview with Fox News. At around this time the Zelensky administration (whom Leshchenko had been advising) started to distance itself from Leshchenko reportedly because of concerns about being seen as too close to him while he was attracting criticism from Giuliani. Leshchenko said that the Prosecutor General, Yuriy Lutsenko, was to blame for the scandalous situation, he rejected the accusation of forging \\"black bookkeeping\\" materials. In response, Lutsenko said that ‚ÄúLeshchenko, often on a not-free-of-charge basis from the US Embassy in Ukraine kicked up a row this scandal, trying to help one of the presidential candidates in 2016‚Äù and he called Leshchenko a \\"political skunk\\". = Fight on television = After being live on the ‚ÄúNewsone‚Äù channel Ihor Mosiychuk accused Leschenko of discrediting Oleh Lyashko, who was leading one if the parliaments‚Äô parities.

An Environmental Protection Ministry official stated that the cleanup would likely take years, and that the spill was one of the gravest natural disasters in the country's history. In light of this, On December 9, 2014, Ofir Akunis was appointed deputy environmental protection minister. Akunis replaced Amir Peretz, who resigned from his post at the helm of the ministry. The appointment, by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, came a week after the massive crude oil spill in Israel's Arava region. Akunis said that \\"it is the deputy minister's intention to prioritize treatment of the ecological disaster in the south and to do all that is necessary to prevent the spread of the crude oil, and to prevent a health and environmental disaster.\\" Akunis ordered crews to raise the side walls of the dams that had been built in the Arava to prevent flooding. Thanks to the infrastructure that had already been built in the area, the risk that the oil would reach the Gulf of Eilat significantly dropped. Akunis instructed that the reserve remain closed as long as high values of pollutants were still registered in air quality tests. In the end of December 2014, the government approved a NIS 17 million Environmental Protection Ministry plan to rehabilitate. According to Akunis, the NIS 17 million program will serve to treat the soils contaminated by the spill as well as help restore the wildlife populations damaged over the course of the event. As part of the plan, a special team will be appointed to evaluate the environmental impact of various Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Company activities on both dry land and beaches. The approved plan also involves opening a closed Eilat beach on EAPC-owned property to the city's residents and visitors. In January 2015, air quality tests found that there had been a 90% reduction of pollution in Evrona.

It is native to many Caribbean islands, Central America, and far southern Florida. Its natural habitat is sandy, calcareous soil in coastal areas. Description Like all palms, this species grows thick and low to the ground before sending its meristem vertical, gaining the form of a slender tree. This species has no crownshaft and the canopy appears to emerge directly from the trunk. On average this species reaches a height of 20 feet. It has large compoundly segmented leaves which are 4 to 5 feet wide and 2.5 feet long. The leaves are palmate and divide into segments about halfway down their length with the leaf emerging from the petiole in what is described as a pointed hastula shape. The entire canopy consists of between 10 and 20 large leaves and on average gains only 6 inches of height per year. The shape of the canopy varies depending on its amount of insolation, with full sun specimens appearing more globular or compact, and shaded specimens having a longer, more spread-out canopy. This species can flower when the tree is only 6 feet tall. The inflorescences exceed 3 feet in length, arch downwards, and can extend below the frond. The flowers are white, bisexual, and occur year-round, with peak production in the spring. The resulting fruits, called drupes, are white and can also be seen year round. It can be distinguished from the similar- looking genus Coccothrinax by its white drupes, whereas the drupes in Coccothrinax are black or yellow. Another distinguishing characteristic of Thrinax are its split leaf bases, while the leaf bases of Coccothrinax are fused. Ecology Thrinax radiata is found primarily in coastal scrub areas from the Caribbean to Mexico, and can even grow in exposed limestone. It is also occasionally found in pinelands in South Florida and semi-evergreen forests in the Yucat√°n peninsula. Its seeds are eaten and presumably dispersed by many animals including bats, spider monkeys, toucans, armadillos, and deer. Young leaves are also eaten by spider monkeys, and mature ones serve as a refuge for several bat species In Florida (Elliott Key in particular), the invasive Mexican red-bellied squirrel (Sciurus aureogaster) has had an extremely negative impact on T. radiata populations. It uses palm fibers as nesting materials and consumes the palm itself, often killing the plant. Taxonomy Thrinax radiata belongs to the order Arecales, family Arecaceae, genus Thrinax, and the species T. radiata =Common names= Florida thatch palm, Jamaican thatch, Chit, Silk-top thatch palm, Sea thatch palm, Caribbean thatch palm. Distribution In the wild, this species almost always grows close to coastal areas where it is adapted to tolerating heavy winds, high concentrations of salt, and even drought. It naturally grows in sandy and calcareous soils where it does best in basic, high pH, soil conditions. This species is native to regions of the southern United States and the Florida Keys, western Cuba, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Hispaniola, the eastern coast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula of Mexico, Belize, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Conservation This species appears to be secure globally, however it is rare at the northern edge of its range in Florida. While it is commonly cultivated as a landscape plant in residential areas, its status is the wild in Florida is poor and it is only rarely encountered. There are currently no specific efforts being undertaken to reduce the severity of this status in the United States. There are, however, restrictions on harvesting in Mexico, where human use has had a greater impact on T. radiata populations. Uses This species is commonly used as a landscaping tree along roadways and in residential areas in South Florida (zone 10). Today, it is being widely planted outside of its natural historic range in South Florida and the Caribbean because of its ability to grow under various conditions. It is used by gardeners and can be grown in containers or in arboretums, which showcase this species‚Äô prolific inflorescences and fruit. Its common name derives from the use of its fronds in thatched roofing. Its fronds are the most used part of the palm, being utilized in broom construction, handicrafts, and food wrapping. While T. radiata's white fruit are inedible, its trunks have recently been used to construct lobster traps by fishermen in the Yucat√°n peninsula.

Internet users typically submit links to news stories and articles about unusual or strange crimes or events occurring in Florida, particularly those where \\"Florida Man\\" is mentioned in a headline and has been wreaking madness amongst social media. The story calls attention to Florida's supposed notoriety for strange and unusual events. Miami New Times claimed that freedom of information laws in Florida make it easier for journalists to obtain information about arrests from the police than in other states and that this is responsible for the large number of news articles. A CNN article on this meme suggests that the breadth of reports of bizarre Florida Man activities is due to a confluence of factors including public records laws giving journalists fast and easy access to police reports, the relatively high and diverse population of the state, highly variable weather, and the lack of mental health funding. Origin The meme was originated in February 2013 by the Twitter feed @_FloridaMan, which quoted news headlines containing the words Florida man, such as \\"Florida man run over by van after dog pushes accelerator\\" or \\"Police arrest Florida man for drunken joy ride on motorized scooter at Wal-Mart.\\" The feed refers to Florida Man as the \\"World's Worst Superhero.\\" Spread Florida already had a colorful reputation on the Internet, with the social aggregation site Fark having had a Florida tag for years before the Florida Man Twitter feed appeared. After the creation of the Twitter feed in January 2013, and its simultaneous popularization on social media sites such as Reddit and Tumblr (initially through the subreddit r/FloridaMan and the Tumblr blog StuckInABucket), the meme was featured in numerous news articles and stories throughout February 2013. Florida Man was also referred to in the opening episode of Season 2 of the FX show Atlanta as a sinister entity, referred to by Darius as an ‚ÄúAlt-right Johnny Appleseed,‚Äù who commits a variety of strange crimes in Florida as part of a plot to keep black voters out, portrayed by Kevin Waterman. On November 1, 2018, Desi Lydic of The Daily Show filed a report comedically investigating the phenomenon of \\"Florida Man\\". A play titled \\"Florida Man\\" by Michael Presley Bobbitt premiered July 31, 2019, at New York's Theatre Row Studios. In 2019, a variation developed on social media in which people were encouraged to look up \\"Florida Man\\" and the date of their birthday, typically finding some bizarre occurrence involving a Florida Man on that date. On October 31, 2019, president Donald Trump according to sources, was changing his residence from New York City to Palm Beach, Florida, which is the location of the Mar-a-Lago resort he owns and frequently visits. Sources joked about the POTUS becoming Florida Man, including The Daily Show, which released an extension for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox that changes all instances of Trump's name to \\"Florida Man.\\" American classic rock band Blue √ñyster Cult referenced the phenomenon in the song \\"Florida Man\\" on their 2020 album The Symbol Remains. Reception The meme has widely been seen as a confirmation of the association between Florida and bizarre or humorous activity, and it has been compared to the Darwin Awards. There has been backlash to the meme, with the Columbia Journalism Review calling it \\"one of journalism‚Äôs darkest and most lucrative cottage industries\\" where \\"stories tend to stand as exemplars of the mythical hyper-weirdness of the Sunshine State, but more often simply document the travails of the drug-addicted, mentally ill, and homeless.\\" See also * List of Internet phenomena References  External links  * * Florida Man on Reddit * * \\"Is it okay to laugh at the Florida man meme?\\" by Logan Hill, The Washington Post July 15, 2019 Category:2010s in Florida Category:Computer- related introductions in 2013 Category:Crime in Florida Category:Florida culture Category:Internet memes introduced in 2013 Category:Men in Florida ","title":"Florida Man"},{"id":"44601847","text":"Rate making, or insurance pricing, is the determination of rates charged by insurance companies. The benefit of rate making is to ensure insurance companies are setting fair and adequate premiums given the competitive nature. Fundamental rate-making definitions The following are fundamental terms that are commonly used in rate making. A rate \\"is the price per unit of insurance for each exposure unit, which is the unit of measurement used in insurance pricing\\". The exposure unit is used to establish insurance premiums by examining parallel groups. The pure premium \\"refers to that portion of that rate needed to pay losses and loss-adjustment expenses\\". The loading \\"refers to the amount of the premium necessary to cover other expenses, particularly sales expenses, and to allow for a profit\\". The gross rate \\"is the pure premium and the loading per exposure unit\\". Finally, the gross premium is the premium paid by the insured consisting of the gross rate multiplied by the number of exposure units. Objectives in rate making Rate making has several objectives under regulatory requirements regulated by the states and business objectives due to the goal of profitability: The goal of insurance regulation is to protect the public and three regulatory objectives are placed to meet certain standards: * The first regulatory requirement is that rates must be adequate; meaning the rates the insurers charge should be able to cover expenses. * The second regulatory requirement is that rates must not be excessive; meaning rates should not be so high that policyholders are paying more than the actual value of their protection. * The third regulatory objective is the rates must not be unfairly discriminatory; meaning exposures that are similar with respect to losses and expenses should not be charged significantly different rates. The business objectives are set as a guide for insurers while designing the rating system. The rating system should meet each of the four objectives: * For producers to be able to quote premiums with a minimum amount of their time and expense, the rating system should be easy to understand. * To maintain customer satisfaction, the rates should remain stable over short periods of time. The rapid change of rates could lead to customer dissatisfaction. * To meet the objective of rate adequacy, the rates should be responsive over time in comparison with changing economic conditions and loss exposures. * Finally, to reduce the frequency and severity of losses, the rating system should encourage loss control activities. Loss control is important in insurance because it tends to keep insurance affordable. Rate making methods In property and casualty insurance, there are three basic rate-making methods: * Judgment Rating is used when the factors that determine potential losses are varied and cannot easily be quantified. There are no statistics regarding quantity of future losses and probability. This means an underwriter rates each exposure individually. * The second rate making method is class rating, or manual rating. This rating means that exposures with similar characteristics are placed in the same underwriting class, and each is charged the same rate. The advantage of class rating lies with its easy application and ability to quickly be obtained. * The third rate making method is merit rating. This rating means a plan which class rates, or manual rates are adjusted upward or downward based on individual loss experience. Merit rating is based on the assumption of loss experience will differ substantially from other loss experiences. Rate making in life insurance Life insurance actuaries determine the probability of death in any given year, and based on this probability determine the expected value of the loss payment. These expected future payment are discounted back to the start of the coverage period and summed to determine the net single premium. The net single premium may be leveled to convert to installment premiums. A loading for expenses is added to determine the gross premium. With determining life expectancy, age is the most important factor, other significant factors are sex of the individual and smoking. Thus, an actuary can reasonably estimate the average age of death for a group of 25-year-old males, who don't smoke.
