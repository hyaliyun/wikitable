Centering on the Shenxian lake ecological leisure park, the town is around 25 square kilometers in size and has jurisdiction over 12 village committees, 31 natural villages and 8680 households with a population of 49,318. Cittaslow, an Italian organization, has recently certified Fuli town as the first \\"international slow city\\" in Guangxi and the fourth in China. Before that, Fuchuan had been vigorously promoting tourism by developing rural home inns and eco-villages and making the best of unique local resources. *Fuli Township /Á¶èÂà©‰π°Á≠â, *Fuchuan County /ÂØåÂ∑ùÂéø, *Guangxi /ÂπøË•ø *Postcode: 542 706 *latitude: 24.86618 *longitude: 111.24793 History Fuli town is inhabited by Yao and Han nationalities and has been part of Fuchuan since the 4th year of the Kaibao period in the Song Dynasty. Its main industry revolves around agriculture, predominantly rice, organic vegetables, and citrus, and is the core agricultural demonstration zone in Guangxi. Cittaslow (slow city movement) In July 2015, Cittaslow sent a delegation to Fuchuan to do field inspection and evaluation. The Agriculture Core Demonstration Plot in Fuli town was considered to meet the standard of an \\"international slow city\\". On November 2, Fuchuan County, successfully passed the \\"international slow city\\" criteria, specifically with regard to: * The creation of a Sea of Flowers, the first-stage completed and open to public on October 1 in 2015, with an area of 550 mu. * The Maocaowu leisure and vacation farm of Shenxian lake has been completed. * All villages are greened, beautified and brightened according to the mode of \\"micro countryside\\". * Old buildings and dwellings have undergone renovations based on the idea of \\"restoring the old as the old\\". * Signboards and guide maps in every scenic spot, crossroad and key areas are further perfected. * The building of 10 km of asphalt road in the main stems, 10 km of bikeway, another 10 km of footpath around the lake, sightseeing stacks, viewing decks, information corridors and public toilets. Cittaslow has also reached cooperation agreements with many domestic enterprises in Fuli, for the promotion of ecological leisure, health preserving, and vacation tourism. Chen Hua, secretary of Fuchuan County Party committee, said that Fuchuan now has invested more than 6 million yuan ($0.91 million) in an inn and a mountainous resort with a total planned investment of over 12 million yuan. It has also used the 100 mu (6.67 hectares) land planned for tourism and has built a large-scale green parking lot. In addition to Shenxian Lake Agricultural Sightseeing Park, there is a 2,100 mu Rose Lake Water Park, a 200 mu health maintenance park, and a 300 mu rare fruits picking garden. At present, the area has received nearly 300,000 tourists, earning income of 123 million yuan. The other three Cittaslow cities in China are: Nanjing, Gaochun's Sam town, Guangdong's Meizhou town, Shandong's Qufu town, Shimen's Yan Yang town.

Normally a gentle, small stream, the river's hydrology is such that flash floods may sweep down its stony course after heavy rains. Rivers along this coastline are subject to such flooding, mostly having short, steep courses, but relatively large catchment areas, funneling water into narrow, steep, rocky gorges, accompanied by rapid rises in water levels. Adventuring kloofers are at risk of being swept away at such times, the last such incident having taken place in 2015. In the year 2000 the Albany Museum based in Grahamstown initiated surveys to determine which aquatic macroinvertebrates lived in the Salt River. This study followed on a proposal to introduce trout into the river, which has no freshwater fish of its own. Some 13 undescribed species of macroinvertebrate fauna collected by researchers proved to be of great interest, ending plans for introducing trout. This number later grew to 33 new species, several of which have been described by entomologists Ferdy de Moor and Helen James from the Albany Museum. Eleven of the Tsitsikamma rivers were selected for closer study and were found to harbour a rich diversity of aquatic insects, many of which are regionally endemic species. \\"These fynbos covered sandstone mountains with their numerous gorges determine the nature of the rivers which are cold, fast-flowing, well oxygenated waters with little sediment. These rivers are acidic and of a red-brown colour, due to the presence of humic acid.\\" Further studies have shown the most serious threat to the rivers' fauna to be excessive water abstraction, reduced flow leading to pH changes, eutrophication and unstable water temperatures. It was proposed that the Salt River be given special conservation status and that alien fish in dams within the catchment be removed.

The television series was created by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, and it is based on the 1973 film of the same name, written and directed by Michael Crichton. The first season stars an ensemble cast led by Evan Rachel Wood, Thandie Newton, Jeffrey Wright, James Marsden, Ed Harris, and Anthony Hopkins. The first season received critical acclaim, with particular praise for the visuals, story, and performances. The series received seven nominations at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, including for Outstanding Drama Series; however, the series did not win in any category. Plot summary Westworld's co-founder Robert Ford implements a change in the hosts' programming ostensibly as part of a new narrative for the park, but meant to encourage the park's oldest operating host, Dolores Abernathy, to find the proverbial \\"center of the maze\\", which represents the ability to achieve sentience. Host sentience was the goal of deceased co-founder Arnold Weber and later, Ford himself. Other hosts are affected by this change, creating confusion among the park staff and guests, and leading the Delos board to doubt Ford's ability to run the park. Dolores does ultimately gain sentience, and at a celebration within the park attended by Delos's board members, Ford announces his new narrative: a revolt by the hosts against the human staff and park guests, which starts with Dolores killing Ford and slaughtering many of the panicked party guests.

He took the project to Jonathan Nolan and co-writer Lisa Joy, who saw the potential in the concept to make something far more ambitious, and on August 31, 2013, it was announced that premium cable channel HBO had ordered a pilot for a potential television series version of the story, with Nolan, Joy, J. J. Abrams, Jerry Weintraub and Bryan Burk as executive producers. HBO later announced that Westworld had been taken to series and that it would premiere in 2015. On August 9, 2015, HBO released the first teaser, which revealed it would premiere in 2016. The ten episode first season was reportedly produced on a budget of approximately $100 million, with per-episode budgets somewhere between $8 million to $10 million, and the pilot episode alone costing $25 million to produce. HBO and Warner Bros. Television shared the cost of producing the series; HBO reportedly also paid an undisclosed licensing fee to Warner Bros. Television for broadcast rights. =Casting= Casting for the series was initiated on July 22, 2014, with Anthony Hopkins and Evan Rachel Wood the first to board the series in the roles of Ford and Dolores respectively. August 6 saw the additions of Jeffrey Wright, Rodrigo Santoro, Shannon Woodward, Ingrid Bols√∏ Berdal, Angela Sarafyan, Simon Quarterman, James Marsden, Ed Harris and Thandie Newton to the main cast. Eddie Rouse, who appears in a guest appearance as Kissy, died on December 8, 2014, and Miranda Otto, who was cast in the role of Virgina Pittman, was announced to have exited the series in July 2015 after the character was repurposed and was replaced with Sidse Babett Knudsen. Additionally, Clifton Collins, Jr., Eion Bailey and Jimmi Simpson were announced as having joined the cast. Bailey exited his role a week later, and Ben Barnes was signed to replace him. Tessa Thompson joined on September 18. =Filming= Filming for the show's pilot episode took place during a 22-day period on August 29, 2014 in and around Los Angeles as well as Moab, Utah. Filming locations in California included various soundstages, backlots at both Universal Studios and Warner Bros., the Paramount Ranch in Agoura, the Melody Ranch in Santa Clarita, the Skirball Cultural Center and the Los Angeles Convention Center in Los Angeles, and the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood. The Melody Ranch set used for the town of Sweetwater had been used previously for many western films, such as Django Unchained and The Magnificent Seven, but was significantly upgraded for Westworld by production designer Zack Grobler to portray an idealized version of the American frontier. Green screens were placed around the California sets to block modern objects like parking lots, so that the California shots could be later merged digitally with exterior shots from Utah. For scenes showing the arrival of guests, the filmmakers were able to arrange with the Fillmore and Western Railway for the use of a small train originally built for the 2013 film The Lone Ranger. F&W; also provided a few hundred feet of track on which to place the train; then a pusher vehicle was used to propel the train into the Sweetwater set. The scenes in the underground laboratory levels of Westworld's operations center were filmed on a soundstage at Melody Ranch. The lab set used glass walls extensively, which meant the crew had to be vigilant to avoid walking through glass on the rather dark set, and they had to keep identifying and suppressing unwanted reflections. Hawthorne Plaza was used for filming the \\"cold storage\\" level where decommissioned hosts are stored. Production was temporarily halted for a couple of months in early 2016 so that showrunners Nolan and Joy could complete the scripts for the last four episodes of the first season. The climax of the first season's finale was filmed at Paramount Ranch in April 2016, with approximately 300 people on set. The crew spent 10 days in May striking the set, which included having to modify structures installed by the filmmakers, such as the chapel, so that HBO's \\"intellectual property\\" would not be \\"violated.\\"  Reception  = Critical response = Reception of the first season has been largely positive, with particular praise for the visuals, story, and performances. On the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has an approval rating of 87% based on 85 reviews, with an average rating of 8.16/10, and an average episode score of 94%. The site's consensus reads \\"With an impressive level of quality that honors its source material, the brilliantly addictive Westworld balances intelligent, enthralling drama against outright insanity.\\" On Metacritic, the first season has a score of 74 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". =Ratings= The series premiere had viewership numbers slightly less than those for True Detective, but much better than Vinyl, that meant it was seen as \\"...off to a relatively promising start...\\" Mandy Adams, of iTechPost noted that, \\"Emotional reactions on Twitter were estimated to be 545-percent greater compared to the debut of Vinyl and 326-percent higher than the latest The Leftovers season.\\" The premiere episode received 3.3 million viewers for its three Sunday night airings as well as on HBO's streaming platforms. The first season had an average cumulative viewership of 12 million viewers, making it the most- watched first season of an HBO series, and TorrentFreak gauged Westworld as the third most-torrented television show of 2016. =Accolades= At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, Westworld received seven nominations, for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (Hopkins), Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series (Wood), Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series (Wright), Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (Newton), Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. The series did not win in any category. The series also received three nominations at the 74th Golden Globe Awards for Best Television Series ‚Äì Drama, Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Drama (Wood) and Best Supporting Actress ‚Äì Series, Miniseries or Television Film (Newton). Westworld would once again not win in any category. Newton would receive an additional nomination for her performance at the 23rd Screen Actors Guild Awards, with the core cast receiving a nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. The series won the Critics' Choice Television Award for Most Exciting New Series, Best Actress in a Drama Series (Wood) and Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (Newton) at the 7th Critics' Choice Television Awards. It was additionally nominated for Best Drama Series, losing to Game of Thrones. Wood won the Satellite Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Drama at the 21st Satellite Awards, where it was also nominated for the Satellite Award for Best Television Series ‚Äì Genre, losing to Outlander.

The first 12 of these expeditions were led by the ethnologist Leo Frobenius and they are sometimes referred to as the Frobenius Expeditions.  Overview  Leo Frobenius was a self-taught German ethnologist and archaeologist who specialised in African cultures. He published his first articles on Africa at the age of 21 (circa 1894). Frobenius led twelve German Inner Africa Research Expeditions (Deutsche Innerafrikanische Forschungs-Expeditions, DIAFE) to Africa between 1904 and 1935. He intended these to comprise a systematic analysis of African culture. Frobenius published details of the expeditions in numerous books and journal articles and the majority of his original field notes, drawings and photographs have survived with many being preserved at the Frobenius Institute in Frankfurt. Two further expeditions were organised after Frobenius' 1938 death by his student Adolf Ellegard Jensen. The scale of the expeditions has been described as epic and Frobenius' work is of considerable value for its documentary nature. Frobenius has been described as the \\"pioneering German comparative ethnographer of Africa\\" and a \\"master of the general survey\\" and was in the development of anthropology in Germany. He developed the theory of \\"culture morphology\\" - the idea of culture as a living organism and its development by diffusion from a limited number of \\"culture areas\\" (for example the ancient Greeks). Frobenius theorised that many of the artefacts he found in his expeditions were of non-African origin. His subsequent conclusions about the development of African civilisations from pre-existing non-African cultures have proved controversial and are not supported by modern writers. Frobenius has also been accused of using the expeditions to loot items of cultural value from Africa.  First expedition  An ornate neck support brought back by Frobenius from the first expedition Frobenius provided the initial funding for this expedition himself. It ran from 1904 to 1906 and explored the Kasai region of the Congo. Frobenius himself later described it as an \\"almost foolhardy\\" enterprise in which he undertook with a Hamburg Museum to supply as many artefacts as possible for a low price. Frobenius' wife Editha was in charge of organising the movements of the expedition and managing supplies of food, water and medicine. The expedition also had a dedicated artist by the name of Lemme. The expedition returned to Germany in 1906 having secured 8,000 pieces for the museum. Frobenius published Im Schatten des Kongostaates (In the Shadow of the Congo State) in 1907 based on this expedition.  Second expedition  Depiction of the second expedition on the Benue River Photograph taken by Frobenius of a house in Timbukto during the second expedition The second expedition was funded by the German Colonial Office and supported by the City of Leipzig. It ran from 1907 to 1909 and primarily ran from Senegal through Niger and Liberia to Togo. Frobenius also visited Mali (including the ancient city of Timbuktu), Burkina Faso and the Ivory Coast. During the expedition Frobenius collected stories from the inhabitants and published some of them, of an erotic nature, in a 1910 collection entitled Der Schwarze Dekameron (The Black Decameron).  Third expedition  The third expedition at Oued-Bassira The third expedition was carried out in 1910 to Northwest Africa. It visited Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. Frobenius collected stories from the Berbers and carried out a study of the Kabyle people.  Fourth expedition  A terracotta head brought to Berlin by the fourth expedition The fourth expedition visited Nigeria and Cameroon between 1910 and 1912. Frobenius carried out archaeological excavations at the ancient Yoruba city of Ife in Nigeria and published his findings in twelve volumes between 1921 and 1928. Frobenius theorised that the intricate bronze and terracotta sculptures he discovered at Ife were relics from the mythological city of Atlantis. However, later research has shown them to be the work of 12th-15th century AD Yoruba craftsmen.  Fifth expedition  Frobenius led the 1912 fifth expedition to Kordofan in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan with the objective of locating the mines of Hophrat-en-Nahas in the Kingdom of Kush. The expedition travelled through Egypt via Suez and Port Sudan. Frobenius also visited Khartoum and El Obeid in Sudan. Upon returning to Germany he found his fame had earned him an audience with Wilhelm II (the German emperor) who agreed to sponsor his future expeditions.  Sixth expedition  The sixth Frobenius expedition explored Algeria between 1912 and 1914. The expedition documented rock art from the Saharan region and in 1913 excavated ancient tombs on the Moroccan border.  Seventh expedition  The seventh expedition was to Eritrea in 1915. It served as a front for a German military espionage mission to Ethiopia, and was intended to persuade Emperor Lij Iyasu to support the Central Powers in the First World War and provide assistance to a Mahdist uprising in the Sudan. This could have threatened British and Italian colonies in Eastern Africa and possibly the vital supply route of the Suez Canal. The party crossed the Red Sea in a sambuk but were discovered by the Italian authorities soon after their arrival in Eritrea and had no opportunity to enter Ethiopia. Frobenius and the expedition were eventually granted safe passage to Italy.  Eighth expedition  The eighth expedition travelled to the Nubian Desert in Sudan in 1926. Part of its work was to document rock art.  Ninth expedition  The ninth expedition ran between August 1928 and March 1930 in Southern Africa. It visited parts of modern-day South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia. It recorded a large quantity of indigenous rock art, which helped Frobenius to build one of the most important collections of such work, some of which was sold to South African museums. It also investigated ancient ore mines and provided samples for some of the first metallographic and chemical analysis of southern African indigenous metals.  Tenth expedition  The tenth Frobenius expedition was carried out in 1932 to Fezzan in Italian Libya. It started from Tripoli and part of the route was carried out by motor car procured through the German consul. The expedition returned to Rome by mid September.  Eleventh expedition  Frobenius' sketch of a rock engraving found in the Sahara desert during the eleventh expedition The eleventh expedition was carried out in 1933 to the Libyan Desert.  Twelfth expedition  The Twelfth German Inner Africa Research Expedition was carried out between 1934 and 1935 in the Emirate of Transjordan and Ethiopia. The expedition was led by Frobenius, though he did not accompany it - the leader of the field group was Jensen. This would be the last of the Frobenius Expeditions to Africa; though he would lead the \\"Frobenius Expedition I\\" to New Guinea in 1937-8 and the \\"Frobenius Expedition II\\" to Australia in 1938. He died in August 1938. Jensen published the findings from the twelfth expedition as a book in 1936. He later took over the directorship of the Frobenius Institute.  Thirteenth expedition  Jensen resumed the German Inner Africa Research Expeditions after the Second World War. Jensen struggled to raise money in war-devastated Frankfurt but managed to secure funding for an expedition to Ethiopia. Jensen led the expedition which took place between 1950 and 1952. Jensen's party included doctors Eike Haberland and Willy Schulz-Weidner; Haberland later also became a director of the Frobenius Institute.  Fourteenth expedition  The final German Inner Africa Research Expedition was led by Jensen to Ethiopia between 1954 and 1955. The institute undertook further expeditions to Ethiopia, though these were under a separate programme. The expeditions were halted in 1974 among political turmoil following the socialist takeover of Ethiopia. The institute's Ethiopian Studies department ceased to exist until re-established in 2010.

The organization later expanded its actions and now operates in Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines. Passerelles num√©riques works to provide disadvantaged youth with a way out of poverty for them and their families by giving them the training to become professionals in the IT sector.  Objectives  The mission of Passerelles num√©riques is to enable underserved young people to get out of poverty by giving them access to education, technical and vocational training in the digital sector. Passerelles num√©riques aims to ensure that at least 90% of the young people benefiting from its programs, are employed in a secure job. The aim is to develop sustainable employability, i.e. the ability to progress, adapt, evolve and change throughout their career. The philosophy of the NGO is to make its beneficiaries actors of their own career path in order to enable them to stay out of the poverty circle. This principle turns up in its values: responsibility, respect, trust, solidarity and demanding approach. Passerelles num√©riques supports the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). The NGO notably commits for gender equality (SDG 5), quality education (SGD 4) and no poverty (SDG 1). To ensure gender equity, the organization has made a commitment to take in a minimum of 50% women in its programs. This equalitarian model is in stark contrast to the reality of most IT training courses; for example, in Cambodia, only 6% of IT students at university are women.  History  *2005: Creation of Passerelles num√©riques and opening of the first training center in Cambodia. * 2007: First graduation ceremony in Phnom Penh for 20 students of the Systems and Network Administration program. * 2009: The program is expanded to Cebu City, in the Philippines. * 2010: The program is expanded to Vietnam. *2012: 1st graduation of 24 students in PN Philippines and 27 students in PN Vietnam. *2013: Creation of Passerelles num√©riques Hong Kong Limited, a charity, run by a team of volunteers, which aims to raise awareness and collect funds to support PN‚Äôs actions. *2015: Passerelles num√©riques celebrates its 10 years! Since the beginning, more than 1,500 underprivileged students came through PN‚Äôs training program and can now live the life they have chosen. *2016: Creation of the legal entity ¬´ PN SEA ¬ª (South East Asia) in Singapore with an objective of fundraising & awareness to Passerelles num√©riques‚Äô actions. *2017: In December 2017, Michel Cantet becomes Head of the NGO.  Organisation  At the end of 2018, Passerelles num√©riques employed nearly 69 people, including 8 VSI (Volunteers for International Solidarity). Passerelles num√©riques activity is also carried out thanks to the contribution of volunteers (interns, solidarity leave, ambassadors, skill-based sponsorship, etc.). More than 186 participated in the project in 2018.  Activities  Passerelles num√©riques offers short-term technical and professional training (two or three years) in the sector of information technology to young disadvantaged students. = Selection process = Each year the Selection teams go through a rigorous 4-step process : * Information sessions; * Written exams; * Motivation interviews; * Social investigations. Passerelles num√©riques selection covers 15 provinces in Cambodia, 7 provinces in central Vietnam and all 18 provinces in the Philippines. In 2018, 10 452 young people participated in Passerelles num√©riques information sessions; 669 social surveys were conducted and 118 young people were eventually selected. = Program = The focus is placed on employability, with a curriculum frequently updated to reflect market demands and the employers' needs. Students will benefit from training in IT skills, English language proficiency and soft skills.The program includes practical, hands-on training, and helps them develop problem-solving skills. The curriculum also includes career guidance and on-the-job training in the form of mandatory internships, lasting between 5 months to 1 year, depending on countries. = Types of training = In Cambodia, PN provides 2 years training either in System and Network Administration or Web programming. At the end of the training, graduates will receive both a PN certificate and an Associate's Degree, recognised by the Ministry of Youth, Education and Sport of Cambodia. In the Philippines, in partnership with the University of San Carlos, students receive 2,5 years of traning in IT. During this training, PN provides a professional life training and other activities enabling them to exalte their soft skill potentials. Graduates received a certificate in Computer Technology delivered by USC and a PN certificate. In Vietnam, currently, Passerelles num√©riques Vietnam is working with Danang Vocation Training College to collaborate in the curriculum design and share the training delivery : 3 years training is provided in Software Development and testing. In addition, PN provides a general training in professional skills. At the end of the training, graduating students receive a College degree, recognized by the Vietnamese Ministry of Labor Invalids and Social Affairs and a Passerelles num√©riques certificate.  Impacts and results  * Since 2005, more than 2,000 young people have graduated from Passerelles num√©riques programs. * At the end of the training, more than 96% of the young graduates find a job within 2 to 3 months after graduation. * In Cambodia, 100% of the students in the 2-year training found employment immediately after the end of their internship in October and before the official graduation ceremony. * In the Philippines, 46% of third-year students (or 21 students) were hired as full-time employees after the end of their internship. * In Vietnam, more than 95% of them have found a skilled job and earn, after training, an average of $403 per month, twice as much as the regional minimum wage. * Once they have found employment, graduates in turn support their families and communities. On average, alumni pay 1/3 of their salary to their families.  Partnerships  Passerelles num√©riques receives support from its partner companies such as Cisco Systems, Econocom, Avanade France, Econocom, Palo IT, Accenture and the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Corporate Foundation for Solidarity. Local partners in each of the operating countries include Synacy (in the Philippines) and Web Essentials (in Cambodia).

It was built in 1914 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. John Bacon Hutchings (1859-1916) was the architect for the Arts and Crafts-style building. The school was named after Rogers Clark Ballard, a boy who died in 1909. He was from a prominent family in Louisville, and his parents, Mr. and Mrs. S. Thruston Ballard, donated the site for the school from their land and gave $6,000 toward the building. The school began as a result of a joint effort by parents and the county board of education. When it opened in 1914, the school replaced four one-room schools in eastern Jefferson County. The school was known as Ballard School. It originally accepted students from different areas, but that changed in 1949, when the county board adopted a resolution that students had to attend school in the district where they lived. This school eventually closed in 1959. It was superseded by Wilder Elementary School in the Jefferson County Public School system. Ballard High School, which opened nearby in 1968, was named for this previous school. The building is now the home of a private school, Virginia Chance School, for students age 2 through fifth grade. The school is situated on 26 acres on a bluff overlooking the Ohio River, surrounded by woods and fields. The two- story main building has had extensive renovation that was designed to remain sensitive to the history of the building as the former Rogers Clark Ballard Memorial School.

Like over 2/3 of the people living in the province, Hans Karl is a native speaker of German, which has historically been the majority language spoken by the local population. His older brother is politician Oskar Peterlini. Life Born in Bozen/Bolzano, Hans Karl grew up with his family in the South Tyrolean Unterland, just few miles south of Bozen. He attended the Liceo classico in Bozen where he obtained the \\"Maturit√†\\", the Italian high-school diploma. Peterlini became a journalist in 1982. By that time he had already produced some youthful contributions to Dolomiten, the regional daily newspaper. In 1982 he took a job with ff ‚Äì S√ºdtiroler Wochenmagazin, a weekly news magazine with broadly liberal views on politics and economics. He remained with the Wochenmagazin till 1990, by which time he had become its editor in chief. After that he joined with Hubertus Czernin and the Lentsch family to set up a rival news magazine, S√ºdtirol Profil. When the rival magazine folded he returned to ff ‚Äì S√ºdtiroler Wochenmagazin, resuming his role as editor in chief between 1998 and 2004. His career as a journalist placed him at the heart of a resurgence in the German language print media in South Tyrol (Alto Adige) which accompanied an acceptance of some political and cultural decentralisation by the authorities in Rome. Enduring themes in his writing included the balance of risks between violent confrontation and peaceful co-existence in recent South Tyrol history, coupled with related questions involving how people might grow beyond traditional cultural patterns and ethnic hostilities that had been a feature of the region since its involuntary incorporation into Italy during the second decade of the twentieth century. During the early years of the twenty-first century he published his first books on themes of South Tyrol terrorism, and his book \\"Wir Kinder der S√ºdtirol-Autonomie\\" (2003 - \\"We, the Children of South Tyrol Devolution\\"). In 2004 Peterlini backed away from his journalistic career in order to become a student at the University of Innsbruck where he studied Pedagogy with a focus on psychoanalytical aspects. His objective was to be able to revisit the themes of his previous writing from a more academic perspective. His dissertation, submitted in 2006, was entitled \\"The Explosion of Power and Powerlessness\\" (\\"Die Sprengung von Macht und Ohnmacht\\"), and attempted to provide a psychoanalytic perspective on the terrorist attacks in South Tyrol between 1956 and 1967. He undertook further related training (Psychoanalystic Prop√§deutikum, Interpersonal Communication and Coaching). His doctorate, received from the Faculty of Education Sciences at the Free University of Bolzano (Bozen), followed in 2010. The theme of his dissertation was \\"Homeland\\" as a catch-all for political identity in South Tyrol. Further elucidation comes from the Italian title used when it was published as a book, \\"Understanding the other\\" (\\"Capire l‚Äôaltro\\"). He received his habilitation (higher academic qualification) from Innsbruck for a dissertation entitled \\"Learning and Power: Paradigms of Education and Training in Schools, Culture and Politics\\" (\\"Lernen und Macht. Paradigmata der Bildung in Schule, Kultur, Politik\\") and he received his corresponding teaching certificate. For the 2014/2015 academic year he obtained the teaching chair in \\"General Education Sciences and Intercultural Education\\" at Klagenfurt's Alpen-Adria University.

A teaching unit was established in 1956, the first to be part of a British university. The unit's initial focus was on education for nursing teachers and leaders. In 1960 it offered the first degree courses in nursing in the UK. It became a department of the university in 1965 and six years later gained a Chair of Nursing Studies, which was the first to be established in Europe. The unit also had a Nursing Research Unit, which opened in 1971 and ran for more than twenty years. The unit continues to offer nurse education at undergraduate, postgraduate and research levels.  History  By the early 20th century nursing education in North America had seen links develop between universities and hospitals but these sort of arrangements didn't emerge in Europe until decades later. From 1946 the Scottish Board of the Royal College of Nursing had organised post-registration teaching for nurses that led to a sister-tutor certificate. The teachers for this course were from the University of Edinburgh, who also ran the examinations and were the body that awarded the certificates. Goddard's Work of Nurses in Hospital Wards report, published in 1953 by the Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust, had led to some activity in Scotland to improve the training of nurses. In July 1955 it was reported at a meeting at the University of Edinburgh that the Rockefeller Foundation was to provide a grant of ¬£30,000 over a five-year period with the aim of setting up a new unit to support the education of nurses. In November 1955, a World Health Organization (WHO) study group on the education of nurses met in Brussels and made several recommendations, including that \\"At least one experimental school of nursing be set up in each country.\\" The Nurse Teaching Unit (NTU) was established in 1956 within the Faculty of Arts at the University of Edinburgh. This was the first nurse teaching unit within a British university. Support also came from the WHO and the Royal College of Nursing. Elsie Stephenson took up her appointment of Nurse Director on 1 June 1956. The following year it was renamed the Nursing Studies Unit. The first courses were for qualified nurses, aimed at producing teachers and leaders. The first diplomas were awarded to thirteen nurses in 1958. In 1960 the department announced they had been preparing an integrated degree course that would take students five years to complete. This integrated degree differed from other qualifications available at the time, by combining a nursing qualification and a social science degree. Although other British universities were also beginning to couple qualifications with registration, Edinburgh were the first in the UK to offer a nursing degree course. To enhance motivation, a short 4-week period of patient contact took place before university started, to enable students to participate in basic nursing tasks. In 1962 an international school of advanced nursing studies was established at the unit, with support from the WHO. In 1963 Nursing studies was brought into the new Faculty of Social Sciences, together with ten other departments. In 1965 it became a department. By 1968 several hospital-based nursing schools in England and Wales were collaborating with universities, but Edinburgh was still the only department of nursing at a UK university, with 63 students enrolled in the various programmes. By 1972, Margaret Scott-Wright had become the first professor of nursing and eight of the department's nine staff were registered nurses. In the mid-nineties various organisations looked at the standards around masters- level education in nursing and the department made changes to the courses that were offered. In 2002 the University of Edinburgh began some significant restructuring, with many departments being dissolved. Nursing Studies became part of the School of Health in Social Science, and provides nurse education in both undergraduate and postgraduate studies. The current undergraduate degree, Bachelor of Nursing with honours, is a 4-year programme which leads to eligibility for registration as an Adult Nurse with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). In 2012 author Nicola White became a Writer in Residence with the Nursing Studies department. the course has an intake of 35 people a year. 2016 was also the 60th year of the departments history. In April 2016, to coincide with Nursing Studies‚Äô Diamond Jubilee year, Nursing Studies supported the International RCN Research Society Conference to be hosted in Edinburgh. Pam Smith, Professorial Fellow in Nursing Studies held the keynote speech on Day 1; 'Nursing @ the Extremes: Navigating the Emotions of Care'. This important anniversary was also celebrated within the university. The Princess Royal and University of Edinburgh Chancellor, visited Nursing Studies to unveil a plaque to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee and view a poster exhibition demonstrating how the Department has contributed to nursing excellence over the last 60 years.  Pam Smith  Professorial Fellow, University of Edinburgh .  Nursing research unit  In October 1971 the Nursing Research Unit opened, in two converted flats in Buccleuch Place in Edinburgh. The Scottish Home and Health department had agreed to the unit for an initial period of seven years. It was the first nursing research unit at a British University and Lisbeth Hockey was appointed as director. Penny Prophit was the director from 1983 to 1989. After her resignation a research award was reviewed. With the Scottish Office moving funding to the Nursing Research Initiative for Scotland, the Nursing Research Unit closed in 1994 although the Nursing Studies department continue to have active research programmes.  Chair of Nursing Studies  The Chair of Nursing Studies was created in 1971, the first of its kind in Europe. Scott-Wright, who had been the director at the department since 1968 was appointed to this chair and held the position until 1976. Annie Altschul had been a lecturer, then senior lecturer before holding the position of Chair of Nursing Studies from 1976 until she retired in 1983.

Reception and sales The game received mixed reviews from critics, who generally praised the core Fire Emblem-based game play, but criticized the social gaming aspects and extensive load times. TouchArcade praised the game's production values and core gameplay, but criticized the need for excessive grinding or blind luck needed to advance through the game, ultimately concluding that \\"...neither the story nor the gameplay are strong enough to elevate the game beyond the status of an average social RPG with excellent production values. Genre fans will likely get a kick out of it initially, but I have to believe that only the hardest of the hardcore will stick around once the grind sets in. Gamezebo similarly cited enjoyment in the gameplay, but strongly criticized the length and frequency of the game's loading screens, stating \\"Every time players go to attack an enemy, the game pauses, loads the phase, shows the character attacking the targeted enemy, the attack hits or misses, and then the game pauses and re-loads back to the overall battlefield view.

Hampton moved to New York City in 1958 to pursue a solo career as a cabaret singer. She became a singer/songwriter and dancer, which included off-Broadway theatre performances and swing dancing in Hollywood films. Along with other members of the musical Hamptons, she was a recipient of the State of Indiana's Governor Arts Award (1991) and honored at the Indy Jazz Fest (2000) in Indianapolis, Indiana. Early life and education Dawn Hampton was born on June 8, 1928, in Middletown, Ohio, to Laura and Clarke \\"Deacon\\" Hampton. Clarke Hampton was born in Batavia, Ohio, in 1877, to William and Elizabeth Hampton, and studied music and art while attending a military academy in Xenia, Ohio. He married Laura Burford in 1908. The Hamptons were a musical family. Both parents played musical instruments: Clarke played saxophone and drums; Laura played piano. The family included twelve children, three of whom died young. The nine surviving children included four daughters (Carmalita, Aletra, Virtue, and Dawn) and five sons (Clarke Jr. \\"Duke\\", Marcus, Russell \\"Lucky\\", Maceo, and Locksley \\"Slide\\"). The siblings were trained by their parents to play musical instruments. Dawn learned to play the alto saxophone and later became a vocalist who specialized in ballads.Williams, p. 11.Schiedt, p. 189. Under their father's leadership the Hampton children began performing in the family band at a young age. Dawn joined the family band and its vaudeville act at the age of three, beginning her long career as a musical performer. The Hampton family settled in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1938, when Dawn was tens years old. She attended Indianapolis Public Schools, including Crispus Attucks High School, but left to perform with the Hampton family band.Scheidt, p. 188. Although she did not have professional music training, four of her brothers (Marcus, \\"Lucky\\", Maceo, and \\"Slide\\") took lessons as the MacArthur Conservatory of Music.Williams, pp. 61, 63‚Äì64. Dawn Hampton never married and had no children. Her youngest brother, \\"Slide\\" Hampton, is a two- time Grammy Award-winner and a noted jazz trombonist, composer, and arranger. She is also a distant cousin of Lionel Hampton. Career Hampton began her career as a musical entertainer in the 1930s with the Hampton family's band. During 1940s and early 1950s she performed in a quartet with her three sisters and with all nine of her surviving siblings in Duke Hampton's Orchestra, her older brother's jazz band. She moved to New York City in 1958 to pursue a solo career as a cabaret singer. Hampton also became a singer/songwriter and dancer, which included off-Broadway theatre performances and swing dancing in Hollywood films. =Early years= The Hampton family initially formed as the Deacon Hampton's Pickaninny Band, but due to the negative racial connotations, the band changed its name and became known as Deacon Hampton's Family Band (also referred to as the Deacon Hampton and His Band or Deacon Hampton and the Cotton Pickers). The family traveled the Midwest, especially in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Indiana, performing at fairs, carnivals, tent shows, and private parties. In addition to dancing and presenting comedy skits, the band performed a variety of musical genres, including ragtime, blues, dixieland, polka, and jazz music. In 1938, after an unsuccessful trip to California to find work in the Hollywood film industry, the family relocated to Indianapolis, Indiana, where the Hamptons continued to tour and perform in local clubs.Williams, pp. 9 and 61. During World War II the family band when on hiatus while Hampton and her sisters found work at defense plants in Indianapolis and some of the Hampton men served in the military. Hampton founded a short-lived quartet with her sisters called The Hamptonians, and later performed as The Hampton Sisters, while their older brother, \\"Duke\\", formed a jazz band.Williams, pp. 11 and 62. After the war Hampton played alto and tenor saxophones with the Duke Hampton Orchestra. She also sang and danced while touring with the group in the Midwest and the South. Duke Hampton's band also played at the Cotton Club and the Sunset Terrace on Indiana Avenue, the center of Indianapolis's jazz scene and the entertainment hub of the city's black community, as well as other venues in town. The fourteen-piece group included the nine surviving Hampton siblings, as well as several well-known Indiana Avenue musicians such as Alonzo \\"Pookie\\" Johnson and Bill Penick on saxophone, trombonist/bass player Eugene Fowlkes, and drummers Sonny Johnson, Dick Dickerson, and Thomas Whitted.

He was one of the original members of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and was elected a fellow in 1834. Early career Kay was a pupil of Samuel Pepys Cockerell, and studied European architecture during a trip (1802-1805) alongside Robert Smirke. In 1807, he married Sarah Henrietta Porden (1785-1859), the eldest daughter of architect William Porden; he was assistant to Porden during the building of the second Eaton Hall near Chester, Cheshire (1804‚Äì1812). One of his earliest work in his own right was interior design of the Assembly Rooms in Clifton, Bristol, c.1811. Professional practice In London, as surveyor to the Foundling Hospital, he designed houses on the east side of Mecklenburgh Square (1810‚Äì21), and, as clerk of works to Greenwich Hospital, he remodelled the town centre (creating Nelson Street, College Approach and the Market) in Greenwich (1829); the nearby Trafalgar Tavern (1837) is also his work. In Edinburgh he designed the Post Office in Waterloo Place. His masterpiece was Pelham Crescent with the Church of St Mary-in-the-Castle in the centre, in Hastings, Sussex (1824‚Äì1828), built for Thomas Pelham, 2nd Earl of Chichester; Colvin described it: :\\"The church is top-lit and has an Ionic prostyle portico, while beneath the terrace in front of the whole composition is an ingenious structure intended for shops and services.\\" Other buildings by Kay in Hastings also survive, including the Cupola and Belmont House. Family Kay and his wife had at least eight children (two boys and six girls). Their eldest son, William Porden Kay (1809‚Äì1897) also became an architect, emigrating to Australia in 1842 to become a Director of Public Works, and designing Hobart's Government House. The second son, Joseph Henry Kay (1815-1875), became a naval officer and one of Australia's first geophysicists, a foundation member of the Royal Society of Tasmania and a fellow of the Royal Society (elected on 26 February 1846 for his work on geomagnetism).

Biography  Born in Paris to a family originally from Marseille which, in the eighteenth century, gave several consuls and leaders of trade centers in North Africa,In particular Beaussier Bonaventure, who was chancellor at Tripoli in 1774, Alexandria in 1776, vice-consul at Aleppo in 1776, Nafplio in 1779, Koroni in 1780, Sidon in 1786, chancellor at Constantinople and then consul in Smyrna in 1796, consul general in Tunisia in 1796 and finally in Tripoli from 1797 until his death in 1814 (Eug√®ne Plantet (ed), Correspondance des beys de Tunis et des consuls de France avec la cour, 1577-1830, published under the auspices of the Ministre des affaires √©trang√®res, Paris, F. Alcan, 1899, p. 279). Marcelin Beaussier studied Arabic in Tunisia. = In the army = In 1844 he embraced the career of military interpreter in Algeria where he was distinguished for his swift preparation to reach the highest degree: * auxiliary interpreter: 31 March 1844; * titular interpreter of 3rd class: 13 March 1845; * titular interpreter of 2nd class: 30 Decembre 1846; * titular interpreter of 1st class: 6 February 1850; * principal interpreter: 10 December 1854. He seriously joined his passion for studies to military commitment. He participated in expeditions in Kabylia and the Sahara, receiving three mentions for his courage by General de Saint-Arnaud. Then he distinguished himself particularly in 1859 during a campaign on the borders of Morocco where the troops were suffering from cholera. His devotion in such experiences earned him a further mention. = Studies = Early physically worn down because of the great deal of effort he made in the military - in the last years of life, while remaining active as an interpreter - Beaussier focused on his scientific activities, in particular by participating actively in the life of the Soci√©t√© historique alg√©rienne of which he was a member. But the work which is associated to his name is the first great dictionary of spoken Arabic, which was published two years before his death and that had several reprints, the last being in 2007. It is still a reference work essential for the understanding of the modern Arab lexicon, especially in the regions of North Africa.

The creators intended to reflect more on the Hungarian society involving new themes and characters. Reception =Critical reception= Arany√©let has received widespread critical acclaim and has been praised by many critics as the greatest Hungarian television show of all time. On IMDb, it holds a rating of 9/10, making it the highest rated television series produced by HBO Europe. As of July, 2019 it is the 65th highest rated television series. After the first season, IGN Hungary wrote \\"Arany√©let is not just the best Hungarian television series ever made, but it is also one of HBO's best thrillers. It is characterized by steadily high- quality acting and creative work, a great plot and perfect way of storytelling, not to mention the unforgattable characters, who are defined by our problems, our narrow-mindedness, and our country. Be very proud of them.\\" Player.hu wrote \\"Without doubt, HBO's original crime family drama seems to be the best Hungarian series, every actor is a perfect choice, it looks good, and tells the story in an excellent way. What's more, it is quite addictive.\\" The second season met with positive critical reception as well, IGN Hungary described the season as \\"more exciting, crazier, darker, has more plot twists, but it is more human than the first season. In conclusion despite the exaggerations and being too action-packed sometimes, it is still a masterpiece, which makes our expectations even higher for the next round.\\" Season 3 met mixed reviews - critics praised the season's political themes, acting, and being even more reflective on Hungarian politics and corruption in general, while many criticizing the plot, character development and the ending. Judit Lola Bodn√°r from 24.hu wrote \\"[‚Ä¶] the final season of Arany√©let knows no mercy: it reflects [the Hungarian reality] so much, that only those won't see the country in it who live in total ignorance.\\" Tam√°s Hauschel from Player.hu wrote \\"The third season of Arany√©let was the best thing that could happen to Hungarian television.\\", while Zsolt Sarkadi from 444.hu wrote \\"HBO's once promising series turned into the most shameless garbage\\". International broadcast Arany√©let is produced by HBO Europe, broadcasting in several Central European countries. It premiered in 2016 on HBO Europe channels and on-demand services in Croatia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Macedonia, Romania and Poland and as an HBO Go exclusive in Spain, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. The first two seasons were released in the United States on August 1, 2018 via HBO Go and HBO Now. In other media Arany√©let had a great impact on Hungarian pop culture with Anger's character, Endre Holl√≥s became the breakout character of the show. Anger reprised his role as Holl√≥s in Hungarian pop-rap duo Wellhello's music video Hentes√©k and in a television promo on RTL Klub advertising the Christmas broadcast of Home Alone with Thur√≥czy as Attila Mikl√≥si. The characters wore the costumes of Harry and Marv, as a reference to Home Alone. Eszter √ìnodi also reprised her role as Janka Mikl√≥si in a fake campaign video for mayoral election in the fictional town of Szentv√°zsony.

Initially an ex-cop turned Chief of Security for Sarif Industries, Jensen is mortally wounded at the beginning of Human Revolution by an assault on the facilities. As part of his contract Jensen is forcibly \\"augmented\\" with mechanical parts that replace much of his body. Over the course of the game, Jensen tries to uncover the identity of those behind the attack. Mankind Divided follows a few years after the events of the game, where Jensen is tasked with hunting down and capturing augmented terrorists. Jensen is a character that allows the player to impose their own opinion of augmentation, and in Mankind Divided is presented as an outsider to both the augmented and the unaugmented. His visual appearance went through various designs, ultimately taking two and a half years to fully materialize in two separate appearances for social and combat clothes. Mankind Divided revisited the design, working with an external clothing company. In both games, Elias Toufexis voices the character. Outside of the games, Adam has also appeared in various tie-in media, and debuted in a comic series leading up to Human Revolutions release. He is a central character of said comic series as well as Black Light and Children's Crusade, and appears in some form in The Dawning Darkness and Hard Line. Appearances =2011: Human Revolution game and tie-in comic= In the lead-up to the Human Revolutions release, a six-issue limited comic series ran from February to July. Jensen comes into conflict with the former-SWAT commander he served under, Durant, who now works as an augmented mercenary. Jensen ultimately kills Durant. Adam next appeared as the player character in Human Revolution the game, in August. At the game's beginning, Jensen is the unaugmented head of security of Sarif Industries, a company focused on developing and researching augmentations. An attack on the facility seemingly kills Megan Reed (Adam's ex-girlfriend and head of neuro- scientific research at Sarif Industries) and leaves Adam near death. As part of his employment contract his boss, David Sarif, is allowed to heavily augment him as part of the attempts to save his life. Throughout the game, at Sarif's behest Jensen attempts to investigate the attack and its purpose, ultimately uncovering that the attack was orchestrated by the Illuminati and that Megan and the other scientists were kidnapped, not killed. In the end, Adam succeeds in rescuing Megan along with several of the other scientists, and he destroys the \\"Hyron Project\\"‚Äîan Illuminati supercomputer powered by human brains. However, Hugh Darrows, the founder of augmentation and a rogue Illuminati member, releases a signal from an arctic facility that turns the vast majority of augmented people berserk; Adam manages to shut it down, but not before much loss of life. Depending on the player's choice, Jensen may either broadcast a message explaining (falsely or not) the events that happened in order to shape public opinion, or destroy the facility and leave mankind to find the answers for themselves. Elsewhere in the game, Adam's backstory is explored through a series of sidequests. As an infant Jensen was part of a group of babies that genetic therapy experiments were performed on. Adam was the sole survivor of the treatments, and two scientists decided to burn the labs down to stop the experiments. A nurse at the labs rescued Adam and gave him to a couple, who secretly and unofficially adopted him. In October, a piece of downloadable content called The Missing Link was released, detailing Jensen's experience after leaving Hengsha in cryosleep in part of the main game. =2016‚Äì2017: Mankind Divided and associated media= From February to June 2016, a comic named Deus Ex Universe: Children's Crusade followed Jensen's actions in the events leading up to Mankind Divided, and he was the player character in Deus Ex Go, released in August. Later that month, Mankind Divided came out, along with Black Light, a novel that focused on Jensen and Francis Pritchard during the aftermath of the first game's ending. Mankind Divided takes place two years after Human Revolution, with Jensen now working as part of Interpol's anti-terrorist team Task Force 29. Jensen is also working with Alex Vegas, a member of the secretive hacktivist Juggernaut Collective, to investigate the Illuminati's role in or control over TF29 and Interpol. Shortly near the game's start, a bomb is set off at a train station, and Jensen and TF29 are tasked to investigate it and other recent attacks. Ultimately, Jensen either arrests or kills Viktor Marchenko, an augmented Illuminati pawn who is acting as a terrorist to help drum up support for a United Nations resolution called the Human Restoration Act, intended to allow the Illuminati further control over the mechanically augmented. The game would receive two pieces of downloadable content (DLC) that added new campaigns, both of which have Adam return as the player character. System Rift, released September 2016, involves Jensen attempting to break into and access files from Palisade Blade-01, a data-archiving site world-renowned for its security, at the behest of Pritchard. The second DLC, A Criminal Past, was released February 2017 and involves Jensen recounting his first undercover mission for TF29 to his psychiatrist as a frame story. Entering a high-security prison for augmented individuals as an inmate, Jensen attempts to find and retrieve another undercover agent in order to help stop several potential terrorist attacks, though the player may ultimately have Adam kill him when he begins to threaten another inmate's life. Character =Personality and development= Jensen has a deliberately defined personality and backstory, though his \\"present and future\\" are left up to the player. Prior to his augmentation, Jensen had been someone who had yet to decide whether he wanted to get augmented or not. The removal of his choice in the matter, and the permanent consequences of it, were considered a \\"defining part of his character\\". Narrative designer Mary DeMarle commented on a \\"fine line\\" when balancing Jensen's defined personality with player choice. As Jensen is unsure how he feels himself, the player chooses how he feels within the game. His Human Revolution character bio, on the official Deus Ex website, characterizes him as \\"a loner\\" and someone who \\"instinctively looks for answers for himself first, consulting others only after his own ideas are exhausted\\". He has \\"centered most of his life and career choices around taking care of others\\". Initially, Mary DeMarle wanted to kill off Jensen for Mankind Divided, though he was ultimately brought back as player character oncemore. In the sequel, Adam is an \\"outcast\\" to both the augmented and \\"naturals\\" (unaugmented people), allowing players to see \\"both sides of the debate\\". In contrast to his more ambivalent view in Human Revolution, the Jensen of Mankind Divided has accepted his nature as \\"a tool and a weapon\\" and must decide what to do with it. His newfound metaphorical \\"ownership\\" of his augmentations is intended to be reflected by Mankind Divideds \\"increased fluidity\\" when it comes to his powers. Kotaku's Riley MacLeod noted Jensen's more relaxed nature about his augmentations, contrasting his shower and shirtless video call with Sarif with the broken mirror found in Human Revolution. MacLeod writes: \\"He seems comfortable in his skin, or at least resigned to it\\". =Visual design= The character took two and half years to design for Human Revolution, going through many designs considered \\"extremely bad\\" by art director Jonathan Jacques-Belletete. Much of Human Revolution was designed to blend both cyberpunk and Renaissance-inspired styles, something which extended to Jensen; developers began using the term \\"cyberrenaissance\\". For instance, the character's ultimate design has a \\"Don Quixote\\" goatee and his coat displays a subtle Renaissance pattern. Developers wanted Adam's design to reflect the transhumanist themes of the game, showing both \\"the physical and aesthetic results\\" of his heavy body augmentation. Jensen's design is intended to deliberately avoid being a \\"big brutish dude\\" in the vein of characters like Marcus Fenix. A resemblance between Adam and Jacques-Belletete has been noted by sources. Jacques-Belletete was not intentionally chosen as a model for the character; however, he did pose for one of the game's posters. In the released Human Revolution, Jensen makes use of two costumes: his standard coat, used for \\"urban exploration\\" and \\"social missions\\", and a commando suit used for infiltration missions. Splitting these into two designs was a late decision in crafting Adam's look, with developers spending much time struggling to create a single design that could both fit in with either while adhering to the game's artistic style. Further complicating this was their wish to ensure Adam's cybernetic arms were always on display. Until then, his design went through numerous stages, including what was dubbed a \\"douchebag Adam\\", where developers focused too much on making him \\"too tough, too 'badass, and a \\"Pinocchio Adam\\", with flesh-colored arms making him look like \\"a living mannequin\\". Shifting to two designs had \\"major consequences\\" on the game's production, game systems and budget. His final trenchcoat would go through a few variations, including a shorter version in order to move away from cyberpunk clich√© ‚Äî though this version was dropped after a studio-wide vote between the longer and shorter options. Jensen's coat in Mankind Divided used his original as a \\"starting point\\". After trying to design a new coat internally developers decided to, in contrast to the original Human Revolution, collaborate with an external design company, Acronym. His new coat was desired to be \\"complex, yet functional\\", whilst remaining \\"unique, desirable, and sleek\\". Acronym co-founder Errolson Hugh worked with developers in creating the design. Acronym were given much material related to Human Revolution to guide them and the coat was designed to be functional in the real-world, to the point that a model of the coat was created. Other elements were continued from Human Revolution. Mankind Divided art director Martin Dubeau comments: \\"Inside of his coat there's a Renaissance pattern. It's like the Renaissance is still close to his heart, but he doesn't show it to anyone\\". His outfit is intended look more \\"military\\" in the second game, reflecting his work as part of an anti-terrorist organization. =Portrayal= Elias Toufexis was chosen to voice the character, who also did motion capture for lines during conversations and other cinematics. Toufexis had to balance and \\"justify\\" the various alternate approaches and dialogue the player could say, something he found \\"a challenge, but [...] a lot of fun\\". The actor gave Jensen a \\"little deeper, more purposeful and monotone\\" voice than his own, both in homage to the original Deus Exs JC Denton and to allow the player to \\"imprint\\" their own personality on Jensen. Descriptions provided to Toufexis called Jensen \\"kind of a Clint Eastwood character\\". It took time for Toufexis to fully settle on Adam's voice, leading to certain scenes shot earlier, such as the confrontation with police officer Wayne Haas, sounding different in tone. Toufexis returned to voice the character in the sequel, this time insisting on doing heavier performance capture for the character. Reception Listing him as 2011's best new game character, Destructoid's Ryan Perez gave praise to the design of his apartment and how it showed off the character's inner conflict. Jack Devries of IGN, meanwhile, criticized the character's look for having drab color tones and insulted his \\"fauxhawk\\".

(also known as London Ordnance Works). In 1883 the company merged with W.G. Armstrong and Company, and Vavasseur became a director of the firm. Late in life he adopted Cecil Fisher, only son of Admiral John Fisher, and the Fisher family inherited his fortune, including Kilverstone Hall. The rotating copper ring for projectiles laid the foundation of Vavasseur's fortune  Early career  Vavasseur was born in Braintree, Essex in 1834, and following school he spent six years as an apprentice to the engineering firm of James Horn and Company in Whitechapel. In 1857 he partnered with David Guthrie in establishing the Patent Dyewood and Drug Mills, at 17 New Park Street, Southwark. By 1860, he was in business as Josiah Vavasseur and Company, engineers of 8 Sumner Street, Southwark. He obtained a patent for improvements in cannon rifling and the firm bought a small iron works at 28 Gravel Lane, Southwark. In the same year Vavasseur became a member of the Honourable Artillery Company. In 1861 he developed a portable machine for the rifling of smooth-bore guns, which he later sold to Russia.Institution of Mechanial Engineers, Obituaries 1908, page 1239-1240, at gracesguide.co.ukInstitution of Civil Engineers, Obituaries 1909, at gracesguide.co.uk In 1862 Vavasseur's firm became subcontractor to captain Alexander Blakely, RA, who held a number of patents in gun construction and sold guns to countries in Europe, South America and particularly North America, where demand was high due to the Civil War. Vavasseur initially produced a series of 2.9 inch guns for the Confederate States, but the ship carrying them foundered, and they never reached their destination. Vavasseur's rifling machine was employed by Blakely for the rifling of some of his largest guns. In 1863 Vavasseur and Blakely collaborated on the production of spherical steel shot, intended to penetrate the armour of ironclads coming into service at the time. Later in 1863 Josiah Vavasseur and Company merged with The Blakely Cannon Company, resulting in the Blakely Ordnance Company, with Josiah Vavasseur as engineer and manager. In 1865 the new company became The Blakely Ordnance Company, Limited with Vavasseur as Resident Engineer. One year later, the panic of 1866 caused a squeeze on liquidity that forced The Blakely Ordnance Company, Limited into liquidation, and Vavasseur out of his job.A Biography of Captain Alexander Blakely, RA, page 19-46. The Vavasseur gun mounting was so important to Josiah Vavasseur that he included it in his coat of arms.  London Ordnance Works  The collapse of Blakely's enterprise made it possible for Vavasseur to buy back the iron works in Southwark, and in 1867 the firm Josiah Vavasseur and Company was back in business, commonly referred to as the London Ordnance Works. The company took over at least one of the orders in the books of the Blakely Company, for 11-inch steel guns, delivered to Chile in 1867. The continuation of Blakely's projects was made easier (and cheaper) by the fact that the strain on Blakely's personal finances had prevented the renewal of his gun patents. Vavasseur also made smaller guns, including 27 12-pounders for France during the Franco-Prussian War 1870-1871. The production at the Ordnance Works included towed torpedoes of the Harvey design and spar torpedoes and mines designed by Captain Charles Ambrose McEvoy, formerly of the Confederate Navy.A Biography of Captain Alexander Blakely, RA, page 57-67. In 1866 he invented the copper rotating ring, or band, for the projectiles of breech-loading guns, and this system was widely adopted. The patent laws of Prussia prevented Vavasseur from protecting his invention in that country, and made it possible for the Krupp company to produce projectiles that Vavasseur saw as an infringement to his patent. The inventor tried to protect his claims in 1877, when British shipyards were building the Fus≈ç and the two Kong≈ç class ironclads for Japan. They were all armed with Krupp guns, and when the offending shells arrived in Britain, Vavasseur had an injunction placed on them. In the ensuing court case (and appeal) in 1878, it was decided that the Japanese Mikado (emperor) could not be sued and that his property (the shells) could not be held. The nature of the lawsuit was rather controversial and the verdict was frequently cited in works on international law.The Engineer. 20 November 1908, page 536. In 1877 Vavasseur patented and developed a mounting for breech-loaded guns, which came to be used by most of the world's navies. The demand for the Vavasseur mounting was so high that London Ordnance Works was unable to cope, so in 1883 Josiah Vavasseur and Company merged with Sir W.G. Armstrong & Company. The Vavasseur company name disappeared, Josiah Vavasseur became a director, and all production was transferred to the Elswick Works. Here \\"he continued his work of improving ordnance in every detail\\", until the last three or four years of his life, when ill-health prevented his attendance.The Engineer. 20 November 1908, page 536.  Final years  Josiah Vavasseur became a very wealthy man, and he was able to buy the manor of Kilverstone Hall and to donate substantial funds to religious and philanthropic undertakings. The major part of his fortune went to Cecil Fisher, the only son of Admiral of the Fleet Sir John Fisher. The story of the inheritance was retold by The New York Times on 21 November 1910, when Cecil Fisher came to the United States to marry miss Jane Morgan. The paper wrote that Cecil Fisher as a young lieutenant had helped Vavasseur with his work on quick-firing guns at Whale Island. A friendship evolved, and Vavasseur had adopted Cecil on the condition that he would take the name and arms of Vavasseur. When Josiah Vavasseur died on 13 November 1908, Cecil Vavasseur Fisher inherited the equivalent of 2 million USD (corresponding to $ million in ), and when Admiral of the Fleet Fisher was made a baron on 7 December 1909, he took the title Baron Fisher, of Kilverstone in the County of Norfolk.Lord Fisher arrives for son's wedding, New York Times, 21 November 1910.The London Gazette, page 9514, 14 December 1909  References  Category:1834 births Category:1908 deaths Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:English inventors Category:English industrialists ","title":"Josiah Vavasseur"},{"id":"51757243","title":"Bodybuilding at the 2016 Asian Beach Games"},{"id":"51757246","text":"Captive is an American documentary web series that was released on Netflix on December 9, 2016.

He was winemaker for Hanzell Vineyards for 28 years. Early life Robert Sessions was born in Glendale, California in 1931. He attended the University of California, Berkeley. He earned a degree in English literature in 1957. After graduation, he traveled to France and Brussels. His trip to Europe started his interest in wine. Sessions would marry Mary J. Cross, known as Molly, on December 19, 1959.Ancestry.com. California, Marriage Index, 1949-1959 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2013. Life in wine Sessions was a self-taught winemaker. From 1964 until 1971, he worked at Mayacamas Vineyards. Next, he worked at Souverain as production manager. He also worked at Stags Leap Wine Cellars, which he helped open. While at Stags Leap, he helped Warren Winiarski create and bottle the 1973 Cabernet Sauvignon that was blind tasted in the Judgement of Paris. =Hanzell Vineyards= Sessions became winemaker and general manager at Hanzell Vineyards, in Sonoma, California, starting in 1973. He was recruited by then Hanzell winemaker Brad Webb. Hanzell Vineyards became a family affair for the Sessions, with wife Molly helping to manage the property and son Ben working in hospitality. Molly worked at the winery until her death from ovarian cancer in 2000. At Hanzell, he created wines that Wine Spectator described as what \\"most winemakers could only dream of.\\" He made primarily Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, with a foray into Cabernet Sauvignon in the 1980s. In 1999, the winery named a vineyard block was named after Sessions. Sessions also served as president at Hanzell, retiring in 2001 and becoming winemaker emeritus. Production methods His style was Burgundian in nature and Sessions was considered a \\"pioneer\\" for his early adoption of stainless steel tanks and French oak barrels. Despite being called a \\"pioneer,\\" he respected the tradition of winemaking at Hanzell and sought to continue those traditions as winemaker. Sessions utilized the same wine production method, year after year, during his career at Hanzell. Grapes were picked at their ripest, early in the harvest season. The Chardonnay was fermented in stainless tanks prior to being aged in barrel. He did little treatment to the wines as they aged, enabling the wine varietals to represent their terroir. He also filtered his wines. Personal life and legacy Sessions and his wife Mary (Molly) J. Cross raised two children, Sarah and Benjamin. Molly died of Ovarian cancer in 2000. Sessions would introduce his son, Ben, to cheesemaker and chef Sheana Davis. Davis became Sessions' daughter-in-law in 2016. Sessions married Jean Arnold in 2002. He met Arnold while she served as a consultant at Hanzell Winery. She became President of Hanzell when Sessions retired. After a few months of marriage, Sessions was diagnosed as suffering from dementia in 2003. In December 2012, Arnold announced that Sessions had Alzheimer's disease. He had been suffering from the disease for almost ten years. He died on May 13, 2014 in Sonoma, California. In 2014, a lot of wine called the \\"Hanzell Heritage Tribute\\" was auctioned at the Sonoma Harvest Wine Auction in memory of Sessions. The lot sold for $80,000.

A specialist sprinter who excelled over six and seven furlongs and recorded his biggest win in the 2005 William Hill Sprint Cup. He showed some promise as a two-year-old, winning two minor races, but missed the second half of the year after running poorly in the Coventry Stakes. In the following year he competed in handicaps and minor stakes before emerging as a top class performer with a second place in the Prix Maurice de Gheest followed by his win in the Spring Cup. He remained in training as a four-year-old but ran only twice and failed to recover his best form. He was retired to stud but has had very little success as a breeding stallion. Background Goodricke was a bay horse with a small white star bred by the Newmarket based Red House Stud. He was sired by Bahamian Bounty, who had his greatest success as a two-year-old in 1996 when he won the Prix Morny and Middle Park Stakes and was voted Cartier Champion Two-year-old Colt. After retiring to the National Stud, he became reasonably successful as a sire of sprinters. Goodricke's dam Star won one minor race as a two-year-old in 1997 before becoming a successful broodmare. She produced Goodricke's full-brother Pastoral Pursuits who won the July Cup in 2005. In October 2003 the yearling colt was offered for sale at Tattersalls and was bought for 110,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Richard O'Gorman on behalf of Sheikh Mohammed. The colt was sent into training with David Loder at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =2004: two-year-old season= After finishing second in a maiden race over five furlongs at Windsor Racecourse on 5 April the colt started at odds of 1/5 for a similar event at Leicester Racecourse later that month and recorded his first success, winning by five lengths from Langston Bay. On 14 May the colt contested a novice race (for horses with no more than one previous win) over six furlongs at Nottingham Racecourse. Ridden by Tom Queally, and starting the 4/5 favourite, he took the lead approaching the final furlong and went clear of his rivals to win by three lengths. In June the colt was moved up in class to contest the Group Two Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot. He started a 14/1 outsider and finished ninth of the thirteen runners behind the John Gosden- trained Iceman. =2005: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut Goodricke, racing in the colours of Jumeirah Racing, carried 126 pounds in a handicap race over six furlongs at Salisbury Racecourse on 1 May. Returning to the track after an absence of more than ten months he was equipped with a visor for the first time. After starting slowly he stayed on strongly in the closing stages and dead-heated with the Terry Mills-trained Resplendent Glory. He then started favourite for a Listed handicap at York Racecourse ten days later but finished seventh after he was badly hampered at the start, causing his saddle to slip. On 3 June he contested the Listed Surrey Stakes over seven furlongs at Epsom Racecourse and finished second to the Mill Reef Stakes Galeota. He then returned to the ownership of Sheikh Mohammed. At the end of the month the colt started favourite for a race over six furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in which he was ridden by Jamie Spencer. Goodricke took the lead entering the final furlong and drew away from his opponents to win \\"easily\\" by four lengths. On 23 July Goodricke was matched against older horses in a valuable seven furlong handicap at Newbury in which he was assigned a weight of 119 pounds. He finished second of the twenty-four runners, beaten half a length by the five year old New Seeker after staying on strongly in the closing stages. The colt was then stepped up sharply in class when he was sent to France for the Group One Prix Maurice de Gheest over 1300 metres at Deauville Racecourse. Ridden by Olivier Peslier and starting a 20/1 outsider he appeared to be struggling in the early stages but made steady progress in the straight to finish second, half a length behind the favourite Whipper. On 3 September Goodricke started a 14/1 outsider for the Group One William Hill Sprint Cup over six furlongs at Haydock Park. The favourite for the race was Proclamation, owned by Sheikh Mohammed's wife Princess Haya of Jordan and racing in the Godolphin colours. His fifteen other opponents included, Gift Horse (Stewards' Cup), La Cucaracha, Galeota, Somnus, Lucky Spin (Summer Stakes), Etlaala (Champagne Stakes), Patavellian (Stewards' Cup) and Fayr Jag (Golden Jubilee Stakes). Goodricke was hampered at the start and was switched to the right to obtain a clear run. He overtook the long-time leader Patavellian inside the final furlong and stayed on strongly to win by a length from La Cucaracha, with the 50/1 outsider Ashdown Express a length away in third. After the race Jamie Spencer admitted to being surprised by the colt's performance, commenting \\"I didn't really believe I could win the race and I thought he would run really well to be placed\\". =2006: four-year-old season= After Loder retired from training at the end of 2005 Goodricke was transferred to the ownership of Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin team and was trained thereafter by Saeed bin Suroor. After an absence of over a year he returned in a minor race at Yarmouth Racecourse on 12 September. He started the 1/4 favourite but finished fourth of the six runners behind Riotous Applause. Sixteen days later he contested the Listed Guisborough Stakes over seven furlongs at Redcar Racecourse. He again started favourite but failed to recover after swerving at the start and finished ninth of the eleven runners behind New Seeker. Stud record Goodricke was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. He stood for a season the Overbury Stud in Gloucestershire in 2007 before moving to the Allevamento Fattoria Renaccino in Italy for the next two years. He was moved to the Gest√ºt Ohlerweiherhof in Germany in 2010 and was later relocated to the Czech Republic. He has attracted little interest and sired only a few minor winners.

Meriluoto was born in Pieks√§m√§ki, and published her first collection of poems, Lasimaalaus in age of 22. It was a success among critics and readers. She became the most celebrated and widely read female poet of post-war Finland. The central themes of her early poems are art and femininity. Her first collections reflect the influence of Austrian author Rainer Maria Rilke. In collection Pahat unet (1956) some of the poems have a free form. The next collection, Portaat, came five years later, and there Meriluoto had found her own modern style of expression. Meriluoto lived in Sweden for 13 years. In 1974 she moved back to Finland, and the language of her poetry changed again to more close to a talking voice. In addition to poems, Meriluoto wrote novels, and books for young people. She has translated works by Harry Martinson, Rainer Maria Rilke, Shakespeare and Goethe. Meriluoto was married 1948‚Äì1956 to another poet, Lauri Viita.

Pipina Bonasera (1838‚Äì1927), was a Greek stage actor. She belonged to the pioneer generation of modern Greek theater and was one of the first professional Greek actresses as well as one of the first female theater stars of her country. She was also the first theater director of her sex in Greece. Life Pipina Bonasera is noted to have been active as an actress in 1862, when she performed the main role in Lucrezia Borgia by Victor Hugo. She was reportedly a member of the first professional Greek theater company. The company was dissolved later the same year, after which the Greek actors formed a new company and acted in Istanbul and the Greek cities in the Eastern Mediterranean until they returned to Greece in 1865. For the next twenty years after 1862, she was a star of the Greek theater, known especially for her roles in the works of Demetrius Vernardaki. She composed her own theater company in collaboration with Dimosthenis Alexiadis, thereby becoming the first female theater director in Greece, and toured the Eastern Mediterranean. It was not until after the liberation of Ottoman rule that the theater in Greece could establish itself; the first (temporary) theater was not erected in Athens before 1836, and the first actresses did not appear until 1840. As the Greek upper classes preferred visiting Italian and French theater companies, however, the Greek theater had difficulty to establish outside of travelling companies in the 19th century. Pipina Bonasera was also active as a translator of Italian plays to Greek. References * ŒëŒªŒµŒæŒØŒ± ŒëŒªœÑŒøœÖŒ≤Œ¨: Œ†ŒπœÄŒØŒΩŒ± ŒíŒøŒΩŒ±œÉŒ≠œÅŒ± - Œ£ŒøœÜŒØŒ± Œ§Œ±Œ≤ŒøœÖŒªŒ¨œÅŒ∑.

He currently performs five nights a week in the show \\"Vinnie Favorito Unfiltered\\" at the Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino. Career Favorito started his comedy career in Boston, Massachusetts in 1986 alongside comedians Joe Rogan, Nick Di Paolo, Jackie Flynn, Louis C.K., and David Cross. Favorito stayed in Boston for ten years, playing shows at every major comedy club in the city such as Nick's Comedy Stop, Comedy Connection, Stitches, and Play it Again Sam's, frequently with touring comics such as Drew Carey and Ray Romano. By 1990, Favorito was voted one of the Top Ten comics in Boston by the Boston Herald. > \\"The best comics came out of Boston. Most of us have gone through shit but > we are survivors and our talent keeps us going. We truly did have great > times. Pranks, long fun drives going from gig to gig. So much fun.\\" -Vinnie > Favorito on the Boston comedy scene, 2016. After a decade in Boston, Favorito moved to Los Angeles, California for five years where he was a frequent performer at clubs like The Comedy Store and The Improv. In 1998, he won the San Francisco International Comedy Competition and performed at the Montreal Comedy Festival which earned Favorito notoriety in the industry. Afterwards, Favorito went on tour, performing in major comedy clubs all over the country. He was soon offered two television deals by CBS which he turned down. He subsequently shot a pilot for Fox Family called \\"Favor and Family.\\" When the pilot was not picked up, he was offered his own show in Las Vegas. As a comedian, Favorito has specialized in celebrity roasts, drawing comparisons to the great roastmasters of The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts. Favorito has roasted celebrities such as Tom Arnold, Magic Johnson, Pat O'Brien, Stan Winston, Jerry Springer, Larry Flynt, and Larry King. Favorito brings the comedy atmosphere of a celebrity roast to his stage shows where each member of the audience becomes the subject of their own celebrity roast. From 2003 to 2004, Favorito headlined at Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel, becoming their first ever headliner. From 2004 to 2008, Favorito performed at O'Shea's Casino.

He regularly appears on The Best Damn Sports Show Period and hosted his own show on Fox Sports Radio called The Wise Guys. Additional television and film appearances include Clueless, One World, The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn, among others. Controversy Vinnie Favorito has been profiled in the Las Vegas Review Journal as someone who borrowed money from venue staff where he performed, and from unsuspecting fans, partners, etc., and then not repaying the debt/loan,This behavior continues to this day as he continues to borrow from friends and acquaintances in the Boston area. That behavior led Caesars Entertainment to end its involvement with Favorito by revoking the agreement for the performance space Favorito leased, forcing the closure of his show; Favorito's show rented space from the Flamingo Casino in Las Vegas; the show was not a contracted/hired show. Vinnie Favorito's abuse of debt led to a bankruptcy filing on September 7, 2016, wherein \\"claiming he has less than $50,000 in assets and owes $1 million to $10 million (a wide range indeed, but it‚Äôs one of the brackets to check on the U.S. Bankruptcy Court‚Äôs filing form).\\" References External links * Category:American people of Italian descent Category:American stand-up comedians Category:Living people Category:Male actors from Boston Category:1960 births Category:21st-century American comedians ","title":"Vinnie Favorito"},{"id":"51757432","text":"The Turhan Cemal Beriker Boulevard is a major thoroughfare through the Seyhan district of Adana, Turkey.

Kays was the driving force behind the conversion of a regional agricultural training school in Jonesboro, Arkansas into a four-year university. The transformation was successful even through the country's battle with The Great Depression and two world wars. Early life Kays was born on July 24, 1882, in Magnolia, Illinois. The son of farmers, John A. Kays and Mary Alice Kays, Victor had five siblings. Upon graduating high school from Henry, Illinois, Kays studied for three years at Northern Illinois State Teachers College and was student coach for the school's first football team before completing a bachelor's degree in 1902. Kays advanced his education at the University of Illinois, where he was a member of the very first Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team. While at Illinois he earned a second bachelor's degree, in science, in 1906. After finishing school, his first job was teaching and coaching at the Savanna High School in Savanna, Illinois, but he also worked on the family farm. Due to his poor health, which prevented his continued work on the farm, he resumed his higher education degrees by attending New Mexico A&M; College, where he completed bachelor's and master's degrees in agriculture in 1909 and then worked as an experiment station laboratory chemist in Mesilla Park, New Mexico. Academic career Upon the completion of his master's degree in New Mexico, Kays became the director of an agricultural school in Wetumpka, Alabama. During his time in Alabama, he met Arkansas state senator Charles E. Bush of Antioch and, with his motivation, he helped Kays become the principal for the First District agricultural school. This school was one of four throughout the state established by the Arkansas General Assembly through Act 100 in 1909. On June 1, 1910, Kays took the reins of the school, and on October 3, 1910 he and his newly hired faculty, welcomed 189 students for the first day of classes.\\"Dr. Carl Reng Pays Tribute to V. C. Kays.\\" Jonesboro Sun, January 21, 1966, p. 1. Initially, the classes of the First District State Agricultural School of Arkansas met in rented quarters upstairs in a downtown Jonesboro building while the new agricultural school and two residence halls were being built on a 442-acre plot of farmland east of town. As Kays nurtured the young institution and its growing student body, he emphasized instruction in advanced farming methods, such as crop rotation. He was instrumental in acquiring the first herd of Holstein dairy cattle in the state with the intent of utilizing them, and not only for training the students in livestock farming, but for providing dairy products to the campus residents.Ball, Larry D., and William M. Clements. Voices from State: An Oral History of Arkansas State University. Jonesboro: Arkansas State University, 1984. In 1915, the Arkansas General Assembly appointed an investigating committee to examine the performance of the agricultural schools. The committee's report praised the school facilities and its leader, saying, \\"We find Professor Kays a most excellent gentleman, of indispensable value as the head of such a school....The only deplorable fact in regard to his service to the state is that he is paid a mere pittance for his services.\\" Besides his leadership in academic and financial matters, Kays was known as a \\"hands-on\\" president who was just as likely to be helping with the construction of a campus building or reviewing student behavior in the residence halls as performing his traditional duties. Initially, in 1918 the school started offering a two-year college-level program and was known as the First District State Agricultural School of Arkansas. It was renamed First District Agricultural and Mechanical College in 1925 and attained accreditation by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1928. By 1930, the college began offering a four-year degree program, but a major setback occurred the following year when fire destroyed the main building that housed all classrooms and offices. In order to maintain, all classes met in the campus dairy barn as well as other alternate quarters the next day. Kays immediately began formulating plans for a replacement facility that was completed within the following year. Known as Robert E. Lee Wilson Hall, named for the patron Wilson family of Mississippi County, it was dedicated in November 1932. In 1933, the Arkansas General Assembly renamed the institution Arkansas State College.Dew, Lee A. The ASU Story: A History of Arkansas State University, 1909‚Äì1967. Jonesboro: Arkansas State University Press, 1968. During her time as a U.S. Senator, Hattie Caraway of Jonesboro was often called upon by Kays with the intent of strengthening his academic programs and help with securing federal government funding for construction and special projects. During their collaboration, they were credited not only for adding at least nine buildings across the campus, but for establishing military training schools on campus in support of the war effort.Hendricks, Nancy. Dear Mrs. Caraway, Dear Mr. Kays. Jonesboro, AR: 2010. Personal life Kays married Bertie Hale of Paragould (Greene County) on June 12, 1917, and they had a son, Victor Hale Kays. In 1936, Kays and his wife built a Tudor-style residence on Aggie Road, across from the campus, where they lived during the last seven years of his presidency and the remainder of his life. This house is now known as the Victor Cicero Kays House. Beyond the classroom, Kays formed a charitable foundation, the Arkansas State College Foundation, to assist with institutional finances. What is today known as Kays Foundation is still actively supporting Arkansas State University. Later life After retiring as president in January 1943, Kays was named president emeritus and retained as business manager. After his successor's resignation in 1945, he served as acting president for nearly a year. The board of trustees of Arkansas State College awarded Kays an honorary doctor of laws degree on May 25, 1956. The citation summarized his contributions to the college's early success and cited his leadership that promoted \\"educational opportunities and advantages to the rural, as well as the city youth, of Arkansas.\\" Following a brief illness, Kays died in Jonesboro on January 20, 1966, and was buried at Jonesboro Memorial Park Cemetery.\\"Victor C.

Early life Bertha Porter was born in 1852 to Frederick William Porter, an architect of Irish birth and from 1860 surveyor to the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers, and his wife Sarah Moyle; little is known of Bertha's life, other than that she moved in literary circles. Writing Porter was engaged by Sidney Lee to write for the Dictionary of National Biography, completing 156 biographies by the time she left. Francis Llewellyn Griffith, whilst working at the British Museum (he left in 1896), established funding and direction for the compilation of a Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Reliefs, and Paintings, with the purpose of establishing the location and content of texts found on ancient monuments in Egypt and later Sudan. Porter was engaged to lead the compilation of the bibliography, a task which occupied her until her retirement from the project in 1929, a greater than 30-year span. Porter studied hieroglyphs in London under Griffith and also under Kurt Sethe at the University of G√∂ttingen. Her work was entirely London- based; she never travelled to Egypt. Instead, from 1924, she relied on Rosalind Moss to do field-work; Moss took over Porter's responsibilities upon her retirement. The bibliography is commonly referred to as Porter & Moss.

It has received considerable critical acclaim over the years. It was originally in Kings Road Chelsea, but relocated to St James's, London in 2015. Chutney Mary pioneered in redefining the public face of Indian cuisines by showcasing the gourmet foods from 6-7 different regions of India at any one time. It had the rigorous philosophy that the foods of the different regions could best be cooked by the chefs from that region. It was an extremely ambitious undertaking and akin to having a pan European gourmet. Chutney Mary was probably the first Indian restaurant in the world to trace the regional provenance of each dish. Chutney Mary was also pioneered as an Indian restaurant in taking wines seriously, and led the way in the pairing of Indian food and wine. The regional provenance and the dishes on the Chutney Mary proved the trailblazer for the supermarket packaged foods ‚Äì e.g. Waitrose which from the mid 1990s started prepared dishes with the regional provenance and with names from the Chutney Mary menu. Awards & Reviews The awards it has received in its old location included twice winning the award of Best Indian restaurant in the UK awarded by the Good Curry Guide, twice featured as Fay Maschler's top 20 London restaurants, and the ITV Carlton Award as London's Best Indian Restaurant. In its new location the late AA Gill gave it the maximum of 5 Stars in his Sunday Times review with the concluding words \\"‚Ä¶if there is a better pan-Indian restaurant in London than Chutney Mary, I haven't eaten in it\\" Chutney Mary received the Square Meal Lifestyle BMW Best New Restaurant Award. The citation said ‚Äú‚Ä¶For a restaurant to reach the 25-year mark is unusual; for it to mark that anniversary by moving to a totally different part of the city is unheard of.‚Äù Time Out Magazine rated it as No 5 of Top 50 restaurants in London with the phrase ‚ÄúIndian cooking as good as it gets.‚Äù In the restaurant review, Roopa Gulati gave it the maximum 5 Star rating with the phrase ‚Äú‚Ä¶Astonishing Quality & wonderful service‚Äù. The Evening Standard - London Design Hotspot stated ‚Äú‚Ä¶The new home of Chutney Mary incorporates dazzling d√©cor that is fitting for this sumptuous environment‚Äù The Tatler liked its duck jardaloo and Goan chicken curry. Grace Dent in the Evening Standard called the dining room \\"irrefutably stunning\\", the restaurant \\"capacious, candle-bedazzled, art-strewn and Bentley-visited\\", and inevitably expensive. She found the venison samosas \\"unforgettable\\", and the carrot and cardamon souffl√© with pistachio ice cream \\"the stuff of dreams\\". Ben McCormack in The Daily Telegraph calls the new restaurant \\"swanky\\". He explains that it was the first restaurant in Britain to cover all seven of the major cuisines of India: Lucknow, Punjab, Gujarat, Parsi, Goa, Kerala, and Hyderabad. He calls the food enjoyable and eye-opening.

Career  In 1988, Cubitt got his start as a playwright where his play, Winter Darkness, won a Thames Television bursary award that funded a year long writer-in-residence program at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. During that year, Cubitt wrote and directed The Pool of Bethesda in a production that starred the then Guildhall students Fay Ripley, Naveen Andrews and Peter Wingfield. That production of The Pool of Bethesda won the Thames Television Best New Play and Best Production Awards. It was subsequently restaged at the Orange Tree Theatre with a different cast. This led to scriptwriting work at the BBC. Cubitt's first TV script was 1990's The Land of Dreams, and was the story of an asylum-seeking Black South African struggling with his new life in the UK. The TV show featured the actor Antony Sher and was part of the long- running anthology Screenplay TV series on BBC Two. In 1992, Cubitt wrote the script for The Countess Alice, a made-for-TV film starring Wendy Hiller and Zo√´ Wanamaker about the Berlin Wall coming down. The story was co-produced with WGBH-TV and was also part of Screenplay. 1995's The Hanging Gale was a mini-series about the Great Famine in Ireland, and was Cubitt's first longer- form piece. Cubitt's first high-profile work as a writer was for the Helen Mirren mini-series, Prime Suspect II, which premiered in 1992. Cubitt wrote the four-hour serial for her. In 1997, Cubitt again worked with Helen Mirren on the mini-series, Painted Lady. He wrote the part for Mirren. Also in 1997, Cubitt wrote the film St. Ives, known as All for Love in the United Kingdom, a romance featuring Miranda Richardson that was based on an unfinished work by Robert Louis Stevenson. In 2000, Cubitt wrote the script adaption for the Anna Karenina mini-series which starred Helen McCrory and was made for Channel 4. It later aired on Masterpiece Theatre in the United States. In 2002 and 2004, Cubitt worked on two separate Sherlock Holmes projects, an adaptation of The Hound of the Baskervilles, a film project that starred Richard Roxburgh, and an original story called The Case of the Silk Stockings, which starred Rupert Everett. In 2009, Cubitt adapted the Simon Carr memoir, The Boys Are Back in Town, into the Australian film, The Boys Are Back, that starred Clive Owen and was directed by Scott Hicks. In 2011, Cubitt adapted the Martina Cole novel, The Runaway, which was broadcast as a TV series. Cubitt created the 2013 BBC Two television series, The Fall, from an initial pitch in 2009. The initial pitch was for twelve episodes, which ended up being split over the first two series. The show, which Cubitt characterises as a psychological drama, stars Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan. Cubitt wrote and produced the first series, then wrote, produced and directed series two and three. Northern Ireland and Belfast are both a setting, a character, and an integral part of the show, and Cubitt wrote the majority of the show while based there, and cast the majority of the actors from there. Cubitt is also a composer. He wrote a number of songs for 1997's Painted Lady, starring Helen Mirren. More recently, Cubitt contributed music throughout the three series of The Fall. He wrote Katie's songs and played guitar as she sings. Cubitt contributed two pieces of jazz music to the second series of The Fall, specifically episode 3, which was arranged and played by jazz pianist John Donaldson. He also wrote the music and played guitar and harmonica and sang \\"Spector's Blues,\\" the song that played at the beginning of the second series of The Fall, episode 5 and again during Spector's dream in the car in episode 1 of season three. As of October 2016, Cubitt is working on a new British TV series as well as a play at National Theatre in London.

Biography Born on 15 April 1890, he descended from the Porto Novo kingdom's nobility, with his grandfather being a prime minister. He studied at the Ecole William Ponty in Senegal. In 1910, he was appointed the director of the school system at Ouidah. He edited the newspaper Le Messager du Dahomey with Louis Hunkanrin during World War I while also working at the Musee de l'Homme in Paris. Along with Hunkanrin and the Zinsou Bod√© brothers, Hazoum√© began publishing the newspaper Le Recadere de Behanzin in 1917. Like most Beninese writers of the time, he did not criticize the French for their colonial dominance.Houngnikpo & Decalo 2013, p. 241 Indeed, the French missionary Francis Aupiais helped advance his career.Houngnikpo & Decalo 2013, p. 67 In 1931, on the occasion of the International Colonial Exposition, he represented Dahomey and the International Congress of intercolonial and indigenous societies. Upon his return, he was responsible for general education at the vocational school in Cotonou. Hazoum√© wrote Le Pacte de sang au Dahomey in 1937 and the historical novel Doguicimi the following year, winning recognition and awards as both an ethnologist and novelist. The two books are still widely read and cited.Houngnikpo & Decalo 2013, p. 199 In the years following World War II, Hazoum√© got involved in local politics, becoming secretary of the Cotonou electoral committee. He was the cofounder of the Dahomeyan Progressive Union (UPD), the first political party in present-day Benin, and played an important early role. He served as councilor to the French Union from 1947 until it dissolved in 1958, serving as Vice President of the Commission of Cultural Affairs and Overseas Civilizations. Hazoum√© was a deputy to the territorial assembly from 1952 to 1957. He became chairman of the Association des Anciens du Dahomey in 1964. Hazoum√© ran for president in the disputed elections of May 1968, but received a mere 11,091 votes, or 3.9 percent, which is attributable to strong regionalism. He died on 18 April 1980 at the age of 90.

Ali Pasha had carved out his own semi- autonomous state within the Ottoman Empire centered in Ioannina. In his court he brought in intellectuals from all over Europe. Evfrosini was the central figure and leader of local of a caffee society that celebrated the arts and literature. It's within this framework that Ali Pasha's son attended the society's gatherings and had gotten to know and admire Evfrosini. Her spouse was often absent due to business, and Kyra Frosini is known to have had a love affair with Muhtar Pasha, the son of the local Ottoman governor, Ali Pasha of Ioannina. Over time the local Turkish women began to complain to Ali Pasha about this society led by Evfrosini. On 10 January 1800, Ali Pasha had Kyra Frosini arrested alongside 17 other women pointed out for the crime of adultery and had them all imprisoned. The arrest attracted attention and protests from the Greek community in the sensitive political climate in Ottoman Greece. Only one of the 18 women arrested was released from custody. On the night of 11 January 1800, all 17 women, including Kyra Frosini, were executed by drowning in Lake Pamvotida by the order of Ali Pasha. The women were reportedly sewn in sacks and pushed in the lake from a boat in the night, which was at the time a form of execution for women in Islamic law practiced in Ottoman Empire. The reason for the swift execution was reportedly the immediate rage that had occurred in the community because of the arrests, and the willingness of the next of kin of the accused to forgive their purported crimes. According to one version, Dimitrios Vasiliou had been given the question if he wished to continue to live with a prostitute (his wife), and he had answered yes. Kyra Frosini and the other women were buried with all honors at the convent of St Anargyroi by the grace of her uncle bishop Gabriel. Reportedly, the women were regarded as martyrs of the Ottomans by their contemporary Greeks. Ali Pasha had taken many measures and building projects to cultivate favor among the Greek Epirote community. However the execution of Evfrosini and the other Greek women turned the local population against him. This became significant during the Greek War of Independence. The Turkish Sultan In Constantinople was more concerned with Ali Pasha's rising power than the Greek rebellion in the Peloponese. When Ottoman forces moved on Ali Pasha he was all but abandoned. There was a song sung by people of Epiros about Evfrosini. Accourding to local legend, it is because of Evfrosini that the water of the Lake is sweet. The case in history Several theories have been presented as the cause of this event. One theory claims that Ali Pasha was asked by his daughter-in-law to arrest Kyra Frosini for being the lover of her spouse, and that he followed her wish because his daughter-in-law was well connected and he did not wish to lose the support of her powerful family. Another theory claims that Ali Pasha himself disapproved of the love affair of his son and the influence Kyra Frosini had on his son and that he wanted to have her out of the way, and that he was forced to execute several other women as well, as the actual reason would be exposed if he only arrested and executed Frosini. One theory was that Ioannina was at that point a society strongly influenced by the West and that Kyra Frosini was a representative of the liberal sexual values within the European aristocracy, where women could take lovers, and that Ali Pasha wished to exterminate what he viewed as decadence and restore conservative sexual double standards. Adultery committed by a woman was considered a very serious crime in Islamic law, and Ali Pasha was at that point in a difficult position against the Ottoman authorities. He did not wish to seem to be a weak ruler in his province, particularly since there had been some problems with robberies and kidnappings in the province at that time. In Greece, however, the most popular theory was that the women, at least Frosini, had been executed for political reasons after having been discovered for their taking part in the resistance against the Ottoman Empire, and she was therefore hailed as a national heroine. Legacy The case of Kyra Frosini became subject of a poem by Aristotelis Valaoritis in 1859, an opera by Pavlos Karrer, and a film in 1959 Grigoris Grigoriou with Irene Papas in the part of Kyra Frosini.

AnswerDash was founded in Seattle, Washington in 2012 as a spin-off from the Information school of the University of Washington. Its software-as-a-service utilizes machine learning to create databases of context-sensitive support answers for end-users of webpages and mobile applications, thus reducing the need for human customer service. AnswerDash claims to be the first, and as of 2015, the world's leading provider of contextual point-and-click answer technology. In June 2020, AnswerDash was acquired by CloudEngage.  History  The former logo of AnswerDash The company was founded under name ‚Ä≥Qazzow‚Ä≥ in 2012 by three University of Washington employees: Jacob O. Wobbrock, a professor and the director of ACE Lab, Amy J. Ko, an associate professor the director of Code & Cognition Lab, and Parmit Chilana, a research assistant and a graduate student at the time, now a professor at Simon Fraser University. Jake Wobbrock assumed the responsibilities of CEO, and Amy J. Ko became the company's CTO. The idea of the key company's service stemmed from Parmit Chilana's dissertation on human‚Äìcomputer interaction. Her research has highlighted a very high proportion (up to 95%) of users' questions that are triggered by something seen on a website and should benefit from contextual help. In November 2013, the company received $500,000 seed investment from W Fund to further develop its contextual Q&A; service and in December 2013 additional $2.4 million from WRF Capital and Voyager Capital investment funds. In May 2014, the company re- branded itself to ‚Ä≥AnswerDash‚Ä≥ reacting to customers' confusion over the unusual sequence of letters in the original name. In January 2015, Kevin Knoepp replaced Amy J. Ko as AnswerDash's CTO. AnswerDash service came on-line in May 2015. At the same time, after serving as a CEO for three years, Jake Wobbrock stepped down as the CEO. His performance was generally favored by the board, but Wobbrok has admitted his tendency to focusing on interesting scientific details that might not be relevant to business success. Wobbrock was replaced by William Colleran, a former CEO Impinj. By the end of 2015, the company has \\"matured dramatically\\". After announcing the successful deployment of its software to Zendesk, in September, AnswerDash raised additional $2.9 million. In 2016, AnswerDash has recorded the biggest jump in GeekWire 200 rating, a ranked index of Pacific Northwest startups. In June 2020, AnswerDash was acquired by Spokane, WA-based startup CloudEngage.  Services  Offered under SaaS model by subscription, the service aims to eliminate the need for separate FAQs or ‚Ä≥help islands\\" offering contextual answers to end-users' questions. The service can be used on websites, web applications, and mobile applications. It employs a natural-language engine and machine learning technology that allows website and application owners to build the database of answers in a matter of several days. In addition, AnswerDash utilizes data mining technology to provide business owners with valuable analytics on their consumers' behavior that leads to further improvement of their e-commerce services. AnswerDash claims to reduce the need of traditional customer support by 30 to 50 percent.

Philosophy  Understand the original meaning of Okinawan Karate Kata and its names. Spread Okinawan Karate and Okinawa Kobudo (Weapons). Understand the correct thought and body movement of martial arts. _The Inner Physical Dynamic System (Gamaku)_ Enabling Newton's Law of Motion (Force = Mass x Acceleration) to be applied to the Martial Arts using isolated core muscle movements and gravity to deliver the technique. _Imaginary Center of Gravity (Balance in Unbalance)_ The Inner Physical Dynamic System applied. Using the principles of the Inner Physical Dynamic System you can concentrate the full force of your body weight into your technique. By using isolated muscles to shift your weight you can exert overwhelming force with minimal effort to be applied to a strike, kick, throw or to offset the opponent's center of balance regardless of size ratio. _Walking in the Martial Arts (Gravity Applied)_ Walking is free falling to your imaginary center of gravity. Applying this principle allows you to move in any direction without your initial movement being detected. By using gravity and \\"falling\\" into your attack you can deliver much faster and more powerful techniques with minimal effort. Activities  Karate Seminars Arakaki hosts seminars twice a year (May and October) in the Japanese cities of Tokyo, Osaka, and Okinawa where he works to spread his philosophy based on Okinawan Karate. Since its founding in 1982 Arakaki has worked to establish Muso-Kai Karate into the international community. With its headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah, Muso-Kai Karate also has clubs in Los Angeles, Vietnam, and all over Japan.

Background Pallache was born in Fez, Morocco. His father, Isaac Pallache, was a rabbi there, first mentioned in takkanot (Jewish community statutes) in 1588. His brother was Samuel Pallache. His uncle was Fez's grand rabbi, Judah Uziel, whose son Isaac Uziel was a rabbi of the Neve Shalom community in Amsterdam. His family originated from Islamic Spain, where his father had served as rabbi in C√≥rdoba. According to Professor Mercedes Garc√≠a-Arenal, \\"The Pallaches were a Sephardi family perhaps descended from the Bene PalyƒÅj mentioned by the twelfth-century chronicler Abraham Ibn Da‚Äôud as 'the greatest of the families of Cordoba'.\\" Sometime in the first half of the 16th Century, following the Christian conquest of Islamic Spain (the Reconquista), the family fled to Morocco, where Jews, like Christians, were tolerated as long as they accepted Islam as the official religion. How they arrived is unclear. One Italian historian states, \\"Verso i Paesi Bassi emigra anche la famiglia Pallache, forse dal Portogallo o dalla Spagna, oppure, secundo un'altra ipotesti, dalla nativa Spagna emigra a Fez, dove un Isaac Pallache √® rabbino new 1588\\" (translation: \\"The Pallache family also emigrated to the Netherlands, perhaps from Portugal or Spain, or, second, another hypothesizes, they emigrated [directly] from their native Spain to Fez, where Isaac Pallache rabbi was in 1588.\\") (The surname is spelled \\"Palache\\" on his death certificate. Career After a delegation from the Dutch Republic visited Morocco to discuss a common alliance against Spain and the Barbary pirates, sultan Zidan Abu Maali in 1608 appointed the merchant brothers Samuel and Joseph Pallache to be his envoys to the Dutch government in The Hague. Officially, they served as his \\"agents\\", not ambassador. The Pallaches received the support of stadholder Maurice of Nassau and the States-General in The Hague and negotiated an alliance of mutual assistance against Spain. On December 24, 1610, the two nations signed the Treaty of Friendship and Free Commerce, an agreement recognizing free commerce between the Netherlands and Morocco and allowing the sultan to purchase ships, arms and munitions from the Dutch.Poetry, politics and polemics by Ed de Moor, Otto Zwartjes, G. J. H. van Gelder p.127 This was one of the first official treaties between a European country and a non-Christian nation, after the 16th-Century treaties of the Franco-Ottoman alliance. After his brother Samuel's death in 1616, Joseph inherited his brother Samuel's position as lead agent for Morocco in the Netherlands. When he traveled to Morocco, his son David Palache served as his deputy. During one of his trips to Morocco, he and his sone Moses tried to build a new port near Cape Cantin; the effort failed. Death Pallache's date of death varies widely in reports. His burial record shows a 10-year discrepancy of \\"1639 or 1649.\\" He is buried next to his brother Samuel in Ouderkerk aan de Amstel near Amsterdam. The record for his grave spells his name as \\"Palache.\\" Legacy =Co-founder of Amsterdam Sephardic community= In the first pages of his 1769 Memorias do Estabelecimento e Progresso dos Judeos Portuguezes e Espanhoes nesta Famosa Cidade de Amsterdam, David Franco Mendes records the first minyan in Amsterdam with its sixteen worshippers: Jacob Israel Belmonte (father of Moses Belmonte), David Querido, Jacob Tirado, Samuel Pallache, Ury a Levy, Joseph Pallache, Jacob Uriel Cardoso, Isaac Gaon, Samuel Abrabanel Souza, Jeosuah Sarfati, Joseph Habilho, David Abendana Pereyra, Baruch Osorio, Abraham Gabay, Isaac Franco Medeyro, Moseh de Casserez. Several sources claim this first minyan occurred in Palache's home, as he was the most prominent among them, being envoy from Morocco and occurred around 1590 or Yom Kippur 1596. =Family (Mediterranean rabbis)= Both Les noms des juifs du Maroc and A Man of Three Worlds describe several generations of Pallache family members, which forms the basis of the family descent shown below. He had five sons: Isaac, Joshua, David, Moses, and Abraham, among whom Moses (and David) were more influential person after Samuel's death and than their own father Joseph. =Portuguese-Spanish Sephardic intermarriage= Although the authors of A Man of Three Worlds clearly state that neither Samuel and Joseph's generation nor their children's married into the Portuguese (versus Spanish) Sephardic community of Amsterdam, documents in Amsterdam show otherwise. There exist two 1643 marriage certificates for David Pallache and Judith Lindo of Antwerp, daughter of Ester Lindo plus the death details for David. Three years later, in 1646, Samuel Pallache, nephew of David, then marries Abigail (born 1622), sister of Judith Lindo.

Originally the Q-system was developed for use in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, and was rapidly adapted for use in cultured mammalian cells, zebrafish, worms and mosquitoes. The Q-system utilizes genes from the qa cluster of the bread fungus Neurospora crassa, and consists of four components: the transcriptional activator (QF/QF2/QF2w), the enhancer QUAS, the repressor QS, and the chemical de-repressor quinic acid. Similarly to GAL4/UAS and LexA/LexAop, the Q-system is a binary expression system that allows to express reporters or effectors (e.g. fluorescent proteins, ion channels, toxins and other genes) in a defined subpopulation of cells with the purpose of visualising these cells or altering their function. In addition, GAL4/UAS, LexA/LexAop and the Q-system function independently of each other and can be used simultaneously to achieve a desired pattern of reporter expression, or to express several reporters in different subsets of cells. Origin Repressible Q binary expression system. The Q-system is based on two out of the seven genes of the qa gene cluster of the bread fungus Neurospora crassa. The genes of the qa cluster are responsible for the catabolism of quinic acid, which is used by the fungus as a carbon source in conditions of low glucose. The cluster contains a transcriptional activator qa-1F, a transcriptional repressor qa-1S, and five structural genes. The qa-1F binds to a specific DNA sequence, found upstream of the qa genes. The presence of quinic acid disrupts interaction between qa-1F and qa-1S, thus disinhibiting the transcriptional activity of qa-1F. Genes qa-1F, qa-1S and the DNA binding sequence of qa-1F form the basis of the Q-system. The genes were renamed to simplify their use as follows: transcriptional activator qa-1F as QF, repressor qa-1S as QS, and the DNA binding sequence as QUAS. The quinic acid represents the fourth component of the Q-system. The original transactivator QF appeared to be toxic when expressed broadly in Drosophila. To overcome this problem, two new transactivators were developed: QF2 and QF2w Use in Drosophila =Basic use= The Q-system functions similarly to, and independently of, the GAL4/UAS and the LexA/LexAop systems. QF, QF2 and QF2w are analogous to GAL4 and LexA, and their expression is usually under the control of cell-type specific promoter, such as nsyb (to target neurons) or tubulin (to target all cells). QUAS is analogous to UAS and LexAop, and is placed upstream of an effector gene, such as GFP. QS is analogous to GAL80, and may be driven by any promoter (e.g. tubulin-QS). Quinic acid is a unique feature of the Q-system, and it must be fed to the flies or maggots in order to alleviate the QS-induced repression. In some ways, quinic acid is analogous to temperature in the case of GAL80ts. In its basic form, two transgenic fly lines, one containing a QF transgene and the other one containing a QUAS transgene, are crossed together. Their progeny that had both a QF transgene and a QUAS transgene will be expressing a reporter gene in a subset of cells (e.g. nsyb-QF2, QUAS-GFP flies express GFP in all neurons). If a fly also expresses QS in some of the cells, the activity of QF will be repressed in these cells, but it may be restored of a fly is fed quinic acid (e.g. a nsyb- QF2, QUAS-GFP, tub-QS fly expresses no GFP when its diet doesn't contain quinic acid, and expresses GFP in its neurons when fed quinic acid). The use of QS repressor and quinic acid allows to fine-tune the temporal control of transgene expression. =Chimeric transactivators= Chimeric transactivators GAL4QF and LexAQF allow to combine the use of all three binary expression systems. GAL4QF binds to UAS, and may be repressed by QS while being unaffected by GAL80. Similarly, LexAQF binds to LexAop, and may be repressed by QS. LexAQF represents a useful extension of the LexA/LexAop system that doesn't have its own repressor. =Intersectional expression= Intersectional expression patterns possible using GAL4 and QF binary expression systems. A variety of expression patterns may be achieved by combination of the three binary expression systems and the FLP/FRT or other recombinases. Expression patterns may be constructed as AND, OR, NOR etc. logic gates to e.g. narrow down expression patterns of available GAL4 lines. The resulting expression pattern somewhat depends on the developmental timing of activation of the transcription factors (discussed in ). Use in other organisms Q-system appeared to be working successfully in a variety of organisms. It has been used to drive expression of luciferase, as a proof of principle, in cultured mammalian cells. In zebrafish the Q-system has been successfully used with several tissue-specific promoters, and was shown to work independently of the GAL4/UAS system when expressed in the same cell. In C. elegans the Q-system has been shown to work in muscles and in neuronal tissue. In 2016, the Q-system was used to target, for the first time, the olfactory neurons of malaria mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae. In 2019, the Q-system in Anopheles mosquitoes was used to examine the functional responses of olfactory neurons to odors. In 2019, the Q-system was introduced into the Aedes aegypti mosquito to capture tissue specific expression patterns. These successes make the Q-system the system of choice when developing genetic tools for other organisms. Currently the main shortcoming of the Q-system is the low number of available transgenic lines, but it will be overcome as the scientific community creates and shares these resources, such as by the use of the GAL4>QF2 HACK system to convert existing GAL4 transgenic insertions to QF2. DNA binding domain of QF2 fused with VP16 transcriptional activator domain was successfully applied in Penicillium to gain control over the penicillin producing secondary metabolite gene cluster in a scalable manner.

Cell division orientation is important for morphogenesis, cell fate and tissue homeostasis. Abnormalities in the cell division orientation leads to the malformations during development and cancerous tissues. Factors that influence cell division orientation are cell shape, anisotropic localization of specific proteins and mechanical tensions. Implication for morphogenesis Cell division orientation is one of the mechanisms that shapes tissue during development and morphogenesis. Along with cell shape changes, cell rearrangements, apoptosis and growth, oriented cell division modifies the geometry and topology of live tissue in order to create new organs and shape the organisms. Reproducible patterns of oriented cell divisions were described during morphogenesis of Drosophila embryos, Arabidopsis thaliana embryos, Drosophila pupa, zebrafish embryos and mouse early embryos. Oriented cell divisions contribute to the tissue elongation and the release of mechanical stress. While in the first case oriented cell division acts as active contributor to the morphogenesis, the latter case is a passive response to the external mechanical tensions. Implication for tissue homeostasis In several tissues, such as columnar epithelium, the cells divide along the plane of the epithelium. Such divisions insert new formed cells in the epithelium layer. The disregulation of the orientation of cell divisions result in the creation of the cell out of epithelium and is observed at the initial stages of cancer. Regulation Cartoon of the dividing epithelium cell surrounded by epithelium tissue. Spindle apparatus rotates inside the cell. The rotation is a result of astral microtubules pulling towards tri-cellular-junctions (TCJ), signaling centers localized at the regions where three cells meet. More than a century ago Oskar Hertwig proposed that the cell division orientation is determined by the shape of the cell (1884), known as Hertwig rule. In the epithelium the cells 'reads' its shape through the specific cell junction called tricellular junctions (TCJ). TCJ provide mechanical and geometrical clues for the spindle apparatus to ensure that cell divide along its long axis. Several factors could regulate cell shape and therefore orientation of cell division. Among these factors is the anisotropic mechanical stress. This stress could be the result of the external mechanical deformation of generated intracellularly by non-isotropic localization of specific proteins.

Prelude  After the Bolsheviks assumed control of the Russian government in the October Revolution of 1917, they implemented various policies which were unpopular among the country's rural population. As result, various anti- Communist peasant uprising erupted during the Russian Civil War. One of the largest and widespread rebellions took place in Siberia from mid-1920, after the Russian SFSR's tax policy had effectively destroyed the economic basis of many peasants. This revolt also affected the Altai Mountains, where the rebels were led by veteran anarchist partisans under I. P. Novoselov, P. K. Lubkov, and others. The Red Army managed to suppress this insurgency by fall 1920, and the revolting peasants were severely punsished. Many anarchist insurgents including Novoselov and Lubkov managed to escape the government forces, however, and went into hiding.  Rebellion  A new wave of uprisings hit the Altai region in January 1921. Similarly to the 1920 rebellion, it was motivated by opposition to the Communist tax policies. The peasants took up arms in order to force the communist government from their lands, and received support by rural rebels who had already taken part in the 1920 rebellion. The uprising spread across a \\"huge\\" area to the east of Barnaul and north of Biysk, where around 5,000‚Äì10,000 armed peasants rallied around the mottos \\"For a clean Soviet power\\" and \\"Soviets without communists\\". The center of the rebellion was the locality of Sorokino. Supported by White Army veterans as well as anarchist partisans, the peasant rebels formed units, elected commanders and began to fight both the Red Army as well as local pro- government paramilitaries. The main rebel detachements were once again led by Lubkov and Novoselov; the latter was based at Zhulanikha and Julianikh. The fact that conservative Whites and anarchists allied during this rebellion showcased how desperate both groups had become in resisting the Red Army. Nevertheless, Novoselov planned to immediately turn on the Whites in the case of victory. In February 1921, a battalion of the 308th Regiment (5th Red Army's 35th Division) as well as several regiments of local paramilitaries defeated Novoselov's detachement near Sorokino. About 400 rebels as well as five Red Army soldiers were killed in this action. The rest of Novoselov's forces retreated towards Barnaul. The further course of the rebellion is not well documented, but the government eventually crushed the uprising, and went on to denounce the rebels as rich Kulaks and bandits.  Aftermath  The history of the Sorokino rebellion eventually regained some importance when NKVD Order No. 00447 was implemented in 1937, as many former rebels were again put on trial and convicted, with those identified as insurgent commanders and former White Army officers mostly being executed. In 1972, a monument was erected in Guryevsk for the five Red Army soldiers who had been killed at Sorokino during the rebellion. The monument includes a plaque with the inscription \\"To those who died for the cause of the proletariat eternal memory!\\"  Notes   References  = Works cited = * * Category:20th- century rebellions Category:Anti-Bolshevik uprisings Category:Political repression in Russia Category:Peasant revolts Category:Rebellions in Russia Category:1921 in Russia Category:Conflicts in 1921 Category:Altai Krai Category:Barnaul ","title":"Peasant rebellion of Sorokino"},{"id":"51758692","text":"Liberation () is a 1974 painting by the Norwegian artist Odd Nerdrum.

Schedule Season recap Thanks to the initiative of Bert Smyers and John Scott, the Western University of Pennsylvania Athletic Association met during the 1899-90 school year and elected committees for the sports of baseball and football. During the second meeting a tennis committee was added to the association. An initiation fee for the student population was set at fifty cents for the school year or twenty-five cents for the semester. The student publication, The University Courant, reported strong interest in football with prospective players training in the university's gymnasium. By the fall of 1890, the school had a football team ready to compete. The first varsity football team of the Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP) compiled a 2‚Äì2 record and was outscored by a total of 74 to 22. The starting lineup for the season was John Scott (center/captain), John McGrew (left guard), Anson McGrew (right guard), Harry Calvert (tackle), James Price (right tackle), John Murray (left end), William Dorrington (right end), Bert Smyers (quarterback), Joseph Griggs (left halfback), Alfred Hamilton (right halfback), and Frank Rhea (fullback). Charles Zug, John Stephenson, John Hansen and Lorens Robbins were the substitutes. Game summaries =Allegheny Athletic Association= Initially, the 1890 Western University of Pennsylvania had a three-game schedule. On Saturday October 11, the team assembled at Exposition Park to play the Allegheny Athletic Association team due to a cancellation by the Shadyside Academy eleven. The Pittsburgh Press recapped the game rather succinctly: > ‚ÄúThe Western University Boys Completely Overwhelmed - About 500 people > witnessed the football game and athletic sports at Exposition Park yesterday > afternoon. The Western University eleven was substituted for the Shady Side > Academy gang but the collegians were not in it with the Allegheny Athletic > association gang, who won by a score of 38 to 0‚Äù. The Pittsburgh Dispatch had a more detailed account. The weather was unpleasant and so there was not much of a crowd. O.D. Thompson scored the first touchdown for the Allegheny eleven. Robinson kicked the goal after and WUP was down 6-0. AA teammates Thompson, Robinson and Wilkinson each scored another first half touchdown and Fry converted a goal kick after to account for the 20-0 halftime lead. The Allegheny eleven tacked on eighteen more second half points to reach the 38-0 final score. The following Thursday, the team received their uniforms from Pratt's Sporting Goods. =at Washington & Jefferson College= For their next game, the WUPs traveled to Washington, Pennsylvania to take on Washington & Jefferson University Presidents. The WUPs were again defeated handily 32-0. The Pittsburgh Press again recapped the game with a short paragraph: > ‚ÄúIn a game between the Western University eleven and the Washington and > Jefferson eleven this afternoon the Washington boys were victorious by the > score of 32 to 0. Quite a kick was occasioned by the Washington and > Jefferson eleven putting their trainer, Lynch, in the field.

Eventually Lynch was withdrawn just as the Pittsburg boys were > leaving the grounds‚Äù. =at Kiskiminetas School= The second road game of the season was to Saltsburg, Pa. to play the team representing the Kiskiminetas School. The WUP eleven prevailed in a hard fought scrimmage and won their first game 12-10. =at Geneva College= For the final game of their first season of football, the WUPs traveled to Beaver Falls to take on the Covies of Geneva College. The WUPs, who were outweighed by twenty pounds per man, defeated Geneva for their second victory. The Pittsburgh Press summarized the action: > ‚ÄúThe football game between the Western University eleven and the Geneva > college team at Beaver Falls yesterday resulted in a score of 10 to 4 in > favor of the University boys.

In 2015, the library of the Clark Art Institute acquired The Allan Sekula Library through the generous gift of the artist's widow, art historian and professor Sally Stein. The library comprises a collection of 15,000 volumes, which were assembled by the artist over the course of his career. A thoughtful and thought-provoking artist, photographer, filmmaker, and writer, Allan Sekula (1951-2013) was equally recognized as a public intellectual, art critic and theoretist, and for the social commentary, criticism, and activism that informed his life and work. Allan was a member of the Photography and Media Program faculty at California Institute of the Arts from 1985 until his death in 2013, and is well remembered as a generous and supportive teacher. As installed in the Manton Center Reading Room, The Allan Sekula Library reflects his organization of the books throughout the household spaces and studio. Allan organized and displayed his books according to research interest; collecting both rare, classic and current titles as pertinent to his project topic. As an example, his many volumes on Laos and the Vietnam War were found in close proximity on shelves in the Allan Studio Book Room. Allan researched these topics by including novels, travel guides, language primers, and recipe books, as well as volumes related to political and social analysis. Subjects in his library were never assigned to one shelf; his thought and research processes resulted in shelf order which comingled subjects and demonstrated his cross-references. The titles and shelf order in his studio, study, bedroom and garden shed all exemplify the depth of his investigations into projects concepts. Collection Strengths Amassed over decades, The Allan Sekula Library reflects the artist's personal and professional interests. In addition to volumes on contemporary art and photography, the collection has particular strengths in titles treating social justice, economic disparities, consumerism, the history of the workers movement, maritime history, and the destruction of natural and built environments. The Sekula Library reflects the artist's prolific body of work ‚Äì revolving around issues of labor and the aesthetic and economic traffic in images bound up with the processes of globalization. These volumes supported Sekula's various projects, including his germinal studies The Traffic in Photographs (1981), Photography Against the Grain (1984), and The Body and the Archive (1986); films such as Tsukiji (2001) and A Short Film for Laos (2007), and the award-winning film project about the consequences of global shipping, The Forgotten Space (2010), and multi-format projects including Fish Story (1995), TITANIC‚Äôs Wake (2001), and Polonia and Other Fables (2009).

Now going by her married name, Antoine joined the staff of new head coach Tom Collen at Louisville as recruiting coordinator on June 24, 2003. As the lead recruiter, Antoine put together two nationally ranked recruiting classes in her last two seasons, no. 26 in 2006 and no. 25 in 2007. Antoine then followed Collen to Arkansas in 2007 and served four years under Collen as assistant coach. =Texas State (2011‚Äìpresent)= On April 18, 2011, Texas State hired Antoine as women's basketball head coach. Inheriting a team that went 9‚Äì20 in 2010‚Äì11, Antoine led Texas State to a 17‚Äì14 record in its final year in the Southland Conference. Texas State moved to the Western Athletic Conference for the 2012‚Äì13 season, during which the team went 10‚Äì20 yet won its first game against a Big 12 Conference opponent since 2005, 91-80 against TCU at home.http://www.espn.com/womens-college- basketball/team/schedule/_/id/326/year/2013 Beginning in the 2013‚Äì14 season, Texas State became a member of the Sun Belt Conference and made its first postseason appearance since 2008 in the WBI. Texas State made the WBI again in 2015 and 2017.. In the 2017-2018 season, the bobcats had the best record in the Division 1 era (23-10). This past season was record-breaking including receiving two players on the Sun Belt all-conference team. Taeler Deer was awarded first-team all-conference, Player of the Year, as well as Most Outstanding Player in the Sun Belt Conference Tournament. Toshua Leavitt was also named to an all-conference team earning a spot on second-team with an additional nod on the all-tournament team. Texas State earned the Sun Belt Conference's automatic bid into the Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT) for the second time in program history. The Bobcats attacked the record book in the 2017-2018 season, breaking five program records, and placing athletes on numerous top 10 lists held at Texas State. In the 2017-2018 season, Coach Antoine also earned her win No.100 in a home victory over Louisiana-Monroe on January 18th, 2018. Antoine became just the fourth coach in Bobcat women's basketball history to amass 100 career wins with the program. One of Antoine's top guards, Toshua Leavitt, owns every school record Texas State has to offer. Leavitt broke the Sun Belt record for most 3-pointers made in a season and was one of five athletes to match or top the previous NCAA record for 3-pointers made in a season. Additionally, Taeler Deer finished her senior season landing on eight season and career top-10 leaderboards at Texas State and a two-time school record holder. Both Deer and Leavitt ended the season eclipsing 1,000 points. Head coaching record Personal life Since 2000, Zenarae Antoine has been married to football coach Ronald Antoine, who is currently the co-offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach at Lamar University.

Structure and function  VISTA is approximately 50kDa and belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and has one IgV domain. VISTA is part of the B7 family, is primarily expressed in white blood cells and its transcription is partially controlled by p53. There is evidence that VISTA can act as both a ligand and a receptor on T cells to inhibit T cell effector function and maintain peripheral tolerance.  Clinical significance  VISTA is produced at high levels in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and its blockade with an antibody results in delayed tumor growth in mouse models of melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Monocytes from HIV-infected patients produce higher levels of VISTA compared to uninfected individuals. The increased VISTA levels correlated with an increase in immune activation and a decrease in CD4-positive T cells. =As a drug target= There is an ongoing cancer immunotherapy clinical trial for a monoclonal antibody targeting VISTA in advanced cancer. Preliminary results of the phase I clinical trial show good safety tolerance and anti-cancer activity in patients with advanced tumours.

It might be possible that Mahmud chose to avoid a confrontation with a Hindu confederacy, of which Govinda was a part. According to the 16th- century Muslim historian Firishta, Mahmud reached Multan in December 1024 CE. From there, he marched to Ajmer, which was a part of the Chahamana territory. The residents of the city had abandoned it by the time he reached there. Mahmud initially wanted to sack the city, but gave up the plan realizing that besieging the fort would waste his time. He then marched away to Gujarat. After sacking Gujarat, he marched back to Multan via Sindh, because a confederacy of Hindu rulers had organized an army to counter him.

He ruled the Sapadalaksha country, which included parts of present-day Rajasthan in north-western India. Durlabha-raja was a son of the Chahamana king Simharaja. He succeeded his brother Vigraharaja II on the Chahamana throne. The Harsha inscription of Vigraharaja compares the two brothers to Rama-Lakshmana and Krishna-Balarama. He had two other brothers, named Chandraraja and Govindaraja (not to be confused with the Chahamana kings bearing same names). Two 999 CE inscriptions from Durlabha's reigns have been discovered at Kinsariya and Sakrai in Rajasthan. According to the Sakrai inscription, he assumed the title Maharajadhiraja (\\"king of kings\\"). The Kinsariya inscription states that he was known as Durllanghya- Meru, which implies that his enemies obeyed his orders. The inscription also states that he conquered the Asosittana or Rasoshittana mandala. Historian R. B. Singh speculates that this might be present-day Rohtak district, which Durlabha probably captured from a Tomara king. Durlabha also finds a mention in a 996 CE inscription of Dhavala, a chief of the Hastikundi Rashtrakuta branch. According to this inscription, Dhavala came to aid of a king named Mahendra, who had been overpowered by Durlabha. This Mahendra can be identified with the contemporary Naddula Chahamana king, who was a feudatory of Durlabha's rivals, the Chaulukyas. The inscription states that Dhavala used both diplomacy and force to relieve Mahendra. According to D. R. Bhandarkar, the Durlabharaja mentioned in Dhavala's inscription was a different king: the Durlabharaja Chaulukya. The early medieval Muslim historians state that the ruler of Ajmer joined a confederacy of Hindu kings to support Anandapala against Mahmud of Ghazni in 1008 CE. R. B. Singh identifies this ruler as Durlabharaja. The confederacy failed to stop Mahmud from repeatedly plundering the Hindu territories. Among Durlabha's subordinates, a minister named Madhava and a feudatory named Dadhichika Chachcha are known. He was succeeded by his brother Govindaraja II.

He ruled the Sapadalaksha country, which included parts of present-day Rajasthan in north-western India.  Early life  Harsha inscription of the Chahamana Vigraharaja in Vikrama 1030 (973 CE). Vigrahraja was born to the Chahamana ruler Simharaja. He had three brothers Durlabharaja II (his successor), Chandraraja and Govindaraja. The Chahamanas were originally feudatories to the Gurjara-Pratiharas, but Simharaja had assumed the title Maharajadhiraja taking advantage of their decline. Vigraharaja II was the probably first truly independent king of the Chahamana dynasty. The 973 CE Harsha inscription issued by Vigraharaja states that he revived the fortunes of his distressed family. It indicates that he achieved several military successes and acquired vassals.  Military career  Prithviraja Vijaya states that Vigraharaja had a large cavalry. = Chaulukyas of Gujarat = According to the eulogists of Vigraharaja's successors, he defeated Mularaja, the Chaulukya king of Gujarat. As this achievement is not mentioned in the Harsha inscription, Vigraharaja must have defeated Mularaja after 973 CE. The Chahamana chronicle Prithviraja Vijaya, which describes the Chaulukyas of Gujarat as \\"Gurjaras\\", states that Mularaja fled to Kantha-durga (modern Kanthkot) during Vigraharaja's invasion. The 15th century Hammira Mahakavya claims that Mularaja was killed in this battle, and Vigraharaja sacked his territory. Another Chahamana chronicle Surjana-Charita also mentions the victory of the Chahamanas over the Gurjaras. However, the Gujarat-based 14th century poet Merutunga gives a different account of events. According to his Prabandha-Chintamani, Mularaja's kingdom was attacked simultaneously by the neighbouring kingdoms of Sapadalaksha and Tilinga. Sapadalaksha was the Chahamana territory, while Tilanga here refers to the kingdom of the Kalyani Chalukya ruler Tailapa II. This invasion happened at the time of Navratra religious festival. Mularaja moved to the Kantha-durga, and hoped that the Sapadalaksha ruler would return to his capital Shakambhari to worship his family goddess Ashapuri during the festival. When this did not happen, Mularaja visited the Sapadalaksha king's camp unannounced, and asked him not to attack Gujarat while Mularaja was engaged in a war with the Tilanga ruler. The Sapadalaksha ruler agreed to the demand. Mularaja then defeated the Tilanga army led by General Barapa. When the Sapadalaksha ruler learned about this, he fled away from Gujarat. It is hard to determine the historical truth in these contradictory accounts. According to historian R. B. Singh, Mularaja ceded a part of his territory to the Chahamanas. Dasharatha Sharma also theorized that Vigraharaja had the upper hand in the conflict, as even Merutunga agrees that Mularaja had to take shelter in the Kantha-durga. That said, the Hammira-Mahakavya's claim of Vigraharaja killing Mularaja appears to be inaccurate. = Chaulukyas of Lata = According to Prithviraja Vijaya, Vigraharaja marched to the region around the Narmada river, and subjugated a king of the lunar dynasty. After his victory, he built a temple dedicated to the goddess Ashapuri at Bhrigukachchha (modern Bharuch), on the banks of Narmada. At that time, Bhrigukachchha was ruled by the Lata Chalukyas, who were originally feudatories of the Kalyani Chalukyas. So, it appears that Vigraharaja defeated the Lata Chalukya ruler Barapa (or Varappa), who once served as the Kalyani Chalukya general. According to Dasharatha Sharma, one possibility is that Vigraharaja allied with Barapa to defeat the Gujarat Chaulukya king Mularaja, but this is only a conjecture. Historian R. B. Singh, on the other hand, theorized that after Vigraharaja subjugated Mularaja, the allied army of Vigraharaja and Mularaja attacked Barapa. This theory is based on a narrative in Hemachandra's Dvyashraya Kavya, which was composed under the Gujarat Chaulukya patronage. According to this narrative, Mularaja and his son Chamundaraja marched to Bhrigukachchha, and killed Varappa. = Other conflicts = According to the 16th century Muslim historian Firishta, in 997 CE, the ruler of Ajmer joined an alliance formed by the ruler of Lahore against the Ghaznavid ruler Sabuktigin. Since Vigraharaja ruled over the present-day Ajmer area at that time, it would appear that he fought against the Ghaznavids. However, the accuracy of Firishta's account is doubtful. Earlier accounts by Muslim historians do not mention any such alliance.  Legacy  The temple of Harsha-deva A stone inscription dated to Vigraharaja's reign has been found at Harsha temple. This inscription records the grant of two villages by the king for maintaining the temple dedicated to the deity Harsha-deva. The villages were named Chhatrachara and Shankaranka. Vigraharaja was succeeded by his brother Durlabharaja II. The Harsha inscription compares them to Rama-Lakshmana and Krishna-Balarama.

He ruled the Sapadalaksha country, which included parts of present-day Rajasthan in north-western India. He was the first Chahamana ruler to assume the title Maharajadhiraja.  Early life  Most sources mention Simharaja as the successor of his father Vakpatiraja I. However, the Bijolia inscription places one Vindhyan·πõpati (or Vindhyaraja) between Vakpati and Simharaja. Historian H. C. Ray theorized that Vindhyan·πõpati was a part of Vakpati's name. But according to Dasharatha Sharma, Vindhyan·πõpati was probably an elder brother of Simharaja and had a very short reign.  Military career  Simharaja was the first ruler of the family to assume the title Maharajadhiraja (\\"great king of kings\\"). This suggests that he became independent of the Gurjara-Pratiharas, the overlords of his ancestors. According to the Harsha inscription, Simharaja killed the Tomara chief Salavana (or Lavana), whose soldiers either fled the battlefield or were imprisoned. The prisoners were released only when the common overloard of these two rulers came to Simharaja and secured their release. The overlord, who is called Raghukule Bhuchakravarti (\\"Emperor from Raghu's family\\") in the inscription, was probably a weak Gurjara-Pratihara emperor. Although the identity of this emperor is not clear; he might have been Devapala or one of his successors, such as Vijayapala or Rajyapala. Salavana probably belonged to the Tomara dynasty of Delhi; historian R. B. Singh identifies him with Tejapala, who has been mentioned as the contemporary Tomara king in a Kumaon- Garhwal manuscript. He probably belonged to same family as Rudra, who had been killed by Simharaja's grandfather Chandana. Simharaja is also said to have defeated a Muslim general. The Prabandha Kosha names the defeated general as Heji-ud-Din, and states that the battle took place at Jethan (possibly modern Jethana). The Hammira Mahakavya calls him Hetim, and states that Simharaja captured four of his elephants after killing him. The identity of the defeated general is uncertain, but he might have been a subordinate of the Amir of Multan. The Hammira Mahakavya further claims that Simharata defeated the kings of Gujrata, Lata, Karnataka, Chola and Anga. This is obviously a hyperbole, although Simharaja may have achieved some military successes against his neighbours.  Personal life  The Prithviraja Vijaya suggests that like his father, Simharaja was a devout Shaivite, and commissioned a large temple dedicated to Shiva at Pushkara. He also extended the Harshadeva temple, and granted four villages for its maintenance: Simhagoshtha, Trailkalakaka, Ishanakupa, and Kansapallika. The Kinsariya inscription describes him as naya- sutra-yuktah, which probably indicates that he was knowledgeable about logic (see NyƒÅya S≈´tras).  Last days  Simharaja was succeeded by his sons Vigraharaja II and Durlabharaja II in that order. He had two other sons, Chandraraja and Govindaraja (not to be confused with the earlier Chahamana kings bearing same names). The Harsha inscription states that Vigraharaja revived the fortunes of his distressed family. This indicates that Simharaja suffered a tragic defeat at the end of his life. His enemies might have included the Pratiharas.

This may be an exaggeration, but it is possible that Vakpati participated in a large number of battles in the chaotic conditions resulting from Pratihara-Rashtrakuta conflict. The Rashtrakuta invasion probably weakened the Pratiharas' hold on vassals like Vakpati. According to the Harsha stone inscription, he assumed the title Maharaja. He was the first Chahamana king to do so, and this probably indicates that he tried to gain independence from the Pratiharas. After the Rashtrakutas left, the Pratiharas probably tried to re-assert their authority. The Harsha inscription states that a tantrapala (provincial governor) attacked the Ananta region in the Chahamana territory. The tantrapala was very haughty because of the authority he held from his overlord, but his elephant force was defeated by Vakpati's cavalry. He might have been a general sent by the Pratihara emperor Mahipala I to subdue Vakpati. According to Dasharatha Sharma, his name was Kshamapala. R. B. Singh identifies him with Madhava, a Tomara feudatory of Mahipala.  Legacy  Vakpati had at least three sons including Simharaja, Lakshmana and Vatsaraja. He was succeeded by Simharaja on the Shakambhari throne, while Lakshmana established another branch of the dynasty at Naddula (Nadol). Vatsaraja is known as the donor of Kardamakakhata village to the Harshanatha temple. The Bijolia inscription places one Vindhyan·πõpati (or Vindhyaraja) between Vakpati and Simharaja. According to historian Dasharatha Sharma, Vindhyan·πõpati was probably an elder brother of Simharaja and had a very short reign. However, R. B. Singh theorized that it was a title of Vakpati, who probably acquired it by conquering the Vindhyavati region (around modern Bijolia). Vakpati appears to have been a Shaivite. The Prithviraja Vijaya states that he built a temple dedicated to Vomkesha (Shiva) at Pushkar.

Paolino #8, in central Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. The church is near the Church of the Ognissanti. History A church at the site was putatively located here by the 4th century, and dedicated to the Conversion of St Paul. It was originally located outside the Carolingian walls, and facing the former Decumanus maximus, now mainly Via Tornabuoni. A church replaced the chapel between the 10th and 11th centuries, and this was refurbished in an early Gothic-style by the 13th century. By 1208, the church at the site was called San Paolino to distinguish it from the church of San Paolo in the nearby Ospedale dei Convalescenti. By 1250, it was a collegiate church, and officiated during 1217-1221 by Dominican friars from Santa Maria Novella. The church exteriors remained unfinished with a single portal and oculus in the fa√ßade. Under Pope Leo X, the collegiate church was suppressed, and it became a parish church. The fa√ßade has coats of arms of the Pope, and the Cardinal Giulio di Giuliano de' Medici, Archbishop of Florence and future pope Clement VII. In 1529, it was staffed by the Franciscan Observant Minorites. In 1618, it was transferred to the Discalced Carmelite order, with the rights to found a convent. In 1621-1622, the interior of the church was refurbished. A major reconstruction took place in 1667, when it was decided the church was to be rotated 90 degrees from the prior orientation, under the guidance of the architect Giovan Battista Balatri. The rebuilt church had a single nave with four chapels at each side and a dome. Work was completed in 1693 with contributions by Maestro Francesco Masini for the nave and Messer Bastiano Messeri for the dome. The interior decoration was baroque in character. After the suppression of the Carmelite order in 1810, the church was property of the government.Soprintendenza Belle Arti e Paesaggio per le Province di Firenze,Pistoia e Prato, entry on church.

Background Pallache was born to father Joseph Pallache; his uncle was Samuel Pallache. He studied languages at the University of Leiden without registering there. Career Thanks to his many languages known, as a young man he was able to help his father and uncle prepare important negotiations, for which they rewarded him. The States General of the Netherlands considered him a jeune homme de bonne expectation et fort qualifi√© et entendu en affaires et plusieurs langages (\\"young man of good prospects, very qualified, and knowledgeable in business affairs and several languages\\"). He partook in a mission to Istanbul (1614-1616). After the death of his uncle Samuel, he went to live in Morocco and served at the court of Fez, where 1622‚Äì1642 he served as European secretary and interpreter. He became a chief interpreter and translator from Spanish, Dutch, and French into Arabic for the rules of Morocco. During those years, he served under four sultans of Morocco (1618 to 1650): Muley Zaydan (1603‚Äì1627), Muley Abd al-Malik (1623‚Äì1627), Muley al- Walid (1631‚Äì1636), and Muley Muhammad al-Shakh al-Saghir (1636‚Äì1655). \\"He became a very important and influential figure at the Moroccan court, responsible for international and diplomatic dealings.\\" In 1656, Menasseh ben Israel wrote, 'In the Kingdom of Barbary, their [sic] lives also a great number of Iews ... at Marrocco, the Court and Kings house, where they have their Naguid or Prince that governs them, and is their Iudge, and is called at this day, Seignor Moseh Palache'. His name appears in English records from 1636 to his death. It also appears in the Spanish translation of a 1638 treaty between the English and Moroccans. His prominence in Morocco led many relatives to return there from the Netherlands, including his brothers Joshua and Abraham. Joshua became a tax official. Abraham set up in the port of Safi, where he provisioned ships and served as unofficial consult for the Dutch. Death Pallache probably died in Morocco around 1650.

Created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, Sanchez is a misanthropic alcoholic scientist inspired by Emmett \\"Doc\\" Brown from Back to the Future and Mister Fantastic from Marvel Comics. Known for his reckless, nihilistic behavior and pessimistic personality, the character has been well received. He is a sociopathic mad scientist who seems to know everything in the universe and thus finds life a traumatizing and pointless experience. However, despite assuming himself to be the smartest person in the universe, there have been times where he has been wrong. He is formally referred to as Rick Sanchez C-137 by the Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks, in reference to his original universe, \\"C-137\\". Both Rick and Morty are voiced by Roiland. Volume 1 of the Rick and Morty comic series follows the Rick and Morty of Dimension C-132 while most episodes of subsequent installments follow the Rick and Morty of \\"C-137\\"; the video game Pocket Mortys follows the Rick and Morty of C-123. Fictional character biography  Rick Sanchez from Earth dimension C-137 is the father of Beth Smith, and the grandfather of Morty Smith and Summer Smith. He is said to have been away from the family for several years prior to the events of the show. He frequently travels on adventures through space and other planets and dimensions with his grandson Morty. In the third season of the show, it is revealed that he is 70 years old. Rick is portrayed as a mad scientist; utilizing his mathematical and scientific prowess in conjunction with apathy and egotistical cynicism, he emerges safely from any situation, regardless of the consequences of his self- preservation. Rick also, in some episodes, desperately tries to regain his family after losing their trust. The creators wanted him to look like he was in control strategically, but not at all when it came to personal matters. In \\"The Ricks Must Be Crazy\\", Rick reveals that he powers his flying car with a battery that contains a miniature universe, or microverse, whose inhabitants unknowingly provide the required electricity. The inhabitants cease doing this after one of their scientists does the same thing for his own universe, and discovers that this is what Rick has done to his universe. Rick remorselessly destroys the miniature universe inside his own miniature universe, killing everyone inside. Nearing the end of the episode, Rick knows that his own microverse would power his battery, or he dispose of it and create a new one. Rick's intelligence is portrayed to transcend that of metaphysical beings, as demonstrated in the episode \\"Something Ricked This Way Comes\\", where he outsmarts Satan. Rick reveals his disdain for love in the episode \\"Rick Potion #9\\", in which he claims that it is \\"a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed\\". When Rick and Morty irreversibly mutate all humans on Earth except for their family members, they abandon their original dimension, Dimension C-137 (and their family in that dimension), for a new one. Rick locates a universe in which the alternate version of himself has undone the damage inflicted by the love potion, but where the new dimension's Rick and Morty have been killed, allowing the C-137 Rick and Morty to take their place. Despite Morty's trauma concerning this knowledge, Rick is nonchalant about moving to the new dimension. In the episode \\"Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind\\", after numerous Ricks in alternate dimensions are murdered, the Trans- Dimensional Council of Ricks accuses Rick C-137 and orders for him to be arrested. Rick C-137 finds himself captured by an \\"evil\\" Rick, but is saved by a legion of alternate-dimension Mortys led by Morty C-137. In the second season premiere, \\"A Rickle in Time\\", Rick nearly sacrifices himself to save Morty, but saves his own life when he realizes that doing so is possible. In the episode \\"Get Schwifty\\", it is revealed that Rick was once in a rock band called the Flesh Curtains, alongside Birdperson and Squanchy. In the episode \\"Big Trouble in Little Sanchez\\", Rick transfers his consciousness into a younger clone of himself, whom he calls \\"Tiny Rick\\". He soon becomes anguished in his new body, and manages to return to his older true form, and murders a line of other clones he produced. In the second season's finale, \\"The Wedding Squanchers\\", Rick and his family attend Birdperson's wedding, where Birdperson is betrayed and killed by his bride Tammy, a double agent for the Galactic Federation. The family is forced to inhabit an unusually small yet Earth-like planet, as they cannot return to Earth due to Rick's status as a wanted criminal. Rick turns himself into the Federation to allow his family to return home, and is incarcerated on a prison planet under the charges of having committed \\"everything\\". But in the season three premiere \\"The Rickshank Redemption\\", by taking out the Council of Ricks while saving Morty and Summer, it is revealed that Rick actually turned himself in to access the Federation's supercomputer and wipe it out financially. Rick also indirectly convinces Beth to divorce Jerry for trying to convince the family to sell him out. The premiere episode of the series' third season, \\"The Rickshank Rickdemption\\" shows a possible origin for Rick, in which he was a well-meaning scientist who loved his wife Diane and daughter Beth, but had an encounter with a member of the Council of Ricks during his initial testing of a prototype inter- dimensional portal gun, who offered him the secret to creating the device, and joining the Council. Shortly after his refusal, and his pledge to quit science forever, a bomb was sent through a portal, killing Diane and Beth. Rick claims that this was a fake memory he created in order to trick his interrogator into implanting a virus into the mind-reading device he was attached to, allowing him to hijack his body and escape from the Federation prison. At the end of the episode, Rick again insists, in a rant to Morty, that the death of his wife and daughter was a fake memory. Rick's catchphrase is \\"Wubba Lubba Dub- Dub\\", first introduced in the episode \\"Meeseeks and Destroy\\". In Birdperson's native language, the catchphrase translates to \\"I am in great pain. Please help me\\". Personality In the pilot, Rick is revealed to be an atheist, as he tells Summer that \\"there is no God.\\" Harmon has said that \\"anarchist\\" is a close ideological descriptor of Rick. In \\"The Rickshank Redemption\\" Rick professes his longing for the Szechuan sauce once available at McDonald's as a promotional item for the 1998 film Mulan. Rick is a polymath who is agnostic about scientific specialties; he seems to exhibit expertise in areas raning from electrical engineering to nanomedicine to quantum mechanics to nuclear biology. Rick has been stated to be pansexual by Justin Roiland, one of the show's creators and executive producers. This was shown in \\"Auto Erotic Assimilation\\", when Rick connects with Unity, an ex-lover who is a collective hive mind of assimilated individuals from the planet they occupy.  Development  The character was created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, who first met at Channel 101 in the early 2000s. In 2006, Roiland created The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti, an animated short parodying the Back to the Future characters Doc Brown and Marty McFly, and the precursor to Rick and Morty. The idea for Rick and Morty, in the form of Doc and Mharti was brought up to Adult Swim, and the ideas for a family element and Rick being a grandfather to Morty were developed. Roiland considers his voice for Rick to be a \\"horrible Doc Brown manic impression\\".  Reception  The character has received positive reception. Speaking of Rick's relatability and likability, Dan Harmon stated that \\"we‚Äôve all been Rick. But Rick really does have bigger fish to fry than anybody. He understands everything better than us. So you give him the right to be jaded and dismissive and narcissistic and sociopathic\\". Emily Gaudette of Inverse wrote that fans have \\"come to love [Rick] over two seasons of misadventures\\". David Sims of The Atlantic noted Rick's \\"bitter amorality\\" and called the character \\"a genius who comfortably thinks of himself as the universe's cleverest man and is grounded only by his empathy toward other people, which he tries to suppress as much as possible\\", therefore writing that Rick's selflessness at the end of the episode \\"The Wedding Squanchers\\" is \\"the most surprising twist possible\\". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club wrote that \\"[Rick] slowly realizing that he loved his grandkids and his daughter (and tolerated his son-in-law) no matter how many times he swore at them helped to give the character some necessary depth\\", and that \\"behind all the catchphrases and the crazed energy ... There's something dead and sad and fucked up in the guy\\". = In popular culture = In the first episode of the third season, \\"The Rickshank Redemption\\", Rick shows a significant interest in Szechuan sauce and insists that his motivation in life is \\"finding that McNugget sauce\\" caused a public interest in having the sauce be reinstated on the McDonald's menu, with some fans attempting to recreate the sauce themselves. According to USA Today, McDonald's spokesperson Terri Hickey stated that \\"We never say never, because when our customers speak, we listen. And to paraphrase some of our most enthusiastic fans, our sauce is so good that it would be worth waiting 9 seasons or 97 years for.\\" In March 2019, Godzilla: King of the Monsters director Michael Dougherty confirmed the character of Monarch crypto-sonographer Dr. Rick Stanton, played by Bradley Whitford, to have been based on Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty, with Dougherty having the character \\"drink a lot\\" to keep the character in line with the spirit of Sanchez.

Location Mannan Castle is located on Mannan Castle Golf Club, on a south-facing slope of a limestone drumlin ridge about northeast of Carrickmacross. History This site is believed to have been the ancient capital of Airg√≠alla (Oriel), a kingdom originating some time in the pre-Christian era (according to semi-mythical accounts, it was founded by The Three Collas in AD 331). A motte-and-bailey was constructed in 1193 by the powerful Anglo-Norman Pipard family (Sir Roger Pipard, c.1136 ‚Äì before 1225), to consolidate their hold over the region. They first built a wooden castle. This site was not necessarily chosen for its military or defensive usefulness, but for reasons of prestige. By building atop an ancient Gaelic Irish capital, the Norman conquest of Ireland was made clear. In 1227 the Pipard lands were entrusted to Ralph fitz Nicholas. He began to strengthen Mannan Castle; it was burned by the Irish in 1230 and replaced by a stone castle in 1244. Various local legends attach to the castle; one claims that the mortar was made with animal blood and this is why a stone cannot be dislodged from the wall. Another connects the name with a druid named Manann, although the early names are clearly derived from Irish maighean (\\"of the plain\\"). The first archaeological survey of the site was carried out in 1910 by Henry Morris. Later excavations found large amounts of iron slag, pottery, iron nails and ironworking tools in the southern part of the bailey. Building Mannan Castle is a motte (12.5 m high) and inner bailey connected by a causeway with a ditch and an outer bailey without a ditch. The stone ruins of a keep are atop the motte.

The company had created a two-tier system among its workers, paying white workers more than Mexican and Mexican-American workers and housing them better. The strike On October 17, 1950, the Local 890 chapter of the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers went on strike, demanding that the company end its discriminatory pay and segregated housing systems. They later added indoor plumbing and hot water for Mexican-American homes to their list of demands. The company fought back, sending police to harass picketers, posting eviction notices on company houses, and cutting off credit to strikers at the company grocery store. Labor activist Clinton Jencks, who was the union's business agent when the strike was organized and was elected president of Local 890 in early 1951, was arrested on strike and kept in solitary confinement for 16 months. Violence erupted on several occasions, especially when the company brought in strikebreakers. As reports spread of these confrontations, miners at other companies in the region joined the walkout. Eight months into the strike, the company got a court injunction forbidding picketers to return to the picket line the following day. With the threat of jail time and fines looming over them, the men left the picket line, only to be replaced by their wives and, in some cases, children. Since the women were not themselves striking workers, the same legal tactics could not immediately be used against them. However, the women still suffered police harassment and some mass arrests. Eventually the court issued an anti- picketing injunction against the women, but prior mass arrests of women and some children had drawn unfavorable attention in the national news and the local sheriff delayed in carrying out the injunction. After 15 months, the company came to an agreement with the striking workers on January 21, 1952. Empire Zinc gave the strikers nearly everything they asked for, agreeing to improve wages and benefits and provide hot water to homes in the town. Aftermath The following year, the movie Salt of the Earth was filmed in Silver City, with American actor Will Geer and Mexican actress Rosaura Revueltas in leading roles. Local miners and their families played most of the other parts. The movie offered a fictionalized version of the strike, with a company named \\"Delaware Zinc\\" operating out of \\"Zinctown,\\" New Mexico. Police harassment continued during filming, and the day after the filmmakers left town, Local 890‚Äôs union hall burned in a fire of mysterious origin. Directed by Herbert Biberman of the Hollywood Ten blacklist, written by Michael Wilson, and produced by Paul Jarrico (both of whom had also been blacklisted), Salt of the Earth was controversial and in 1954 became the only film ever blacklisted in the United States. Due in part to the efforts of activists in the 1960s and 1970s, the film was added to the Library of Congress's National Film Registry in 1992 because of the cultural and historical significance of its depiction of the Empire Zinc strike.

They returned to Iceland to share the gospel. Missionary work has continued since then, although there were no permanent missionaries in Iceland from 1914 to 1974. , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had 274 members in Iceland, divided into 2 congregations. There is also one Family History Center. History =1850‚Äì55: Early missionary efforts= The first Mormons in Iceland were Thorarinn Thorason (or Hafli√∞ason) and Gu√∞mundur Gu√∞mundsson, who were both baptized in 1851 under the direction of Erastus Snow. They were introduced to the gospel and baptized in Denmark while learning trades. They returned to Iceland expecting to share the gospel with their friends and family, only to find that they were mocked often. However, they were able to convert Benedikt Hansson and his wife. After their baptisms, however, Gu√∞mundsson and Thorason were forbidden from preaching in Iceland. Thorason's wife was strongly opposed to his missionary efforts and threatened to drown herself if he continued. In response, Thorason stopped his missionary efforts, but remained a faithful church member until his accidental death (by drowning) in December 1851. Gu√∞mundsson persisted in missionary efforts, but lacked the authority to perform baptisms. After he wrote to the church leaders in Copenhagen reporting of 24 people who wanted to be baptized, Elder John Lorentzen was sent to Iceland to serve as Gu√∞mundsson's missionaries companion in 1853. Gu√∞mundsson was ordained to the office of an elder in the priesthood and helped organize the first church branch, or small congregation, in Iceland on June 19, 1853 in the Westman Islands. Gu√∞mundsson went back to Denmark in 1854. Early church members were encouraged to emigrate to the United States, which contributed to the mass emigration of Icelanders the 1850s and later decades. A group of 16 saints left Iceland in 1855 and immigrated to the Salt Lake Valley. Brigham Young sent them to settle in Spanish Fork, Utah, in the late 1850s. =1855‚Äì1914: Slow growth and opposition to the church= While many members of the church immigrated to Utah, between 1873 and 1914, 22 native Icelandic saints living in Utah were called on missions to Iceland. Missionaries sent in 1873 began preaching again in the Westman Islands, but faced strong opposition. These missionaries left the following year, but had organized a small branch there. Other pairs of missionaries continued to be sent to the islands, and in 1879 they began preaching on the mainland. A selection of The Book of Mormon was translated into Icelandic in 1881 by convert Jon Jonsson, who was living in the Spanish Fork settlement at the time. While it appears that he intended to copy the entire book, Jonsson only translated the First Book of Nephi. He also compiled a book of psalms in Icelandic and even wrote some Icelandic hymns for saints to sing in their native tongue. An Icelandic Mission was established in 1894, but it was dissolved in 1900 largely due to persecution. Missionary work during this time was largely unsuccessful, with few baptisms. Missionaries often reported hardships they faced from opposition and unfavorable weather. By 1906, there were only 36 reported church members in Iceland. Missionary work ceased in Iceland in 1914, and did not resume until 1975, =1914‚Äì74: A time without missionaries= Because the Icelandic Mission was closed and there was much opposition to the church, there were no permanent missionaries assigned to Iceland between 1914 and 1974. Some missionaries were sent to Iceland in 1930, however, to check up on the status of the saints. Although they were assigned to the Danish Mission, they spent a few months in Iceland during the summer. In 1955 Spencer W. Kimball, serving as an apostle of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, wrote to the president of the church at the time, David O. McKay, and suggested that Iceland receive missionaries once again. While missionaries were not sent at that time, another opportunity for missionary work arose when David B. Timmins, a member of the church, was assigned to work as the American Consul at the U.S. Embassy in Iceland. He arrived in 1958 and was asked many questions by locals about the church and Utah. Timmins was invited to give a lecture on Mormonism at the University of Iceland. Timmins was, however, reassigned and left Iceland in 1960. Danish missionaries were sent once again to the area two years later to see if Icelanders were receptive to their teachings. These missionaries suggested to their mission president that experienced missionaries be assigned to Reykjavik. However, missionary efforts were not formally organized until the Geslison family was called to serve in Iceland in 1974. =1975‚Äìpresent= Missionaries returned to Iceland in 1975 with the arrival of Byron and Melva Geslison and their two sons in April. Missionary work continued as part of the Danish mission. One of the major obstacles to spreading the gospel in the country was that the church lacked materials printed in the Icelandic language. Byron Geslison worked to get filmstrips translated into Icelandic to be used in church meetings, open house programs, and to be shown in public schools in 1976. Sveinbj√∂rg Gudmundsd√≥ttir, a convert to the church in 1976, began translating the entire Book of Mormon and other church publications into Icelandic after her baptism. Another branch of the church was organized in Reykjavik on 8 August 1976. It started with only 10 members and grew to 40 by the following year. Melba Geslison helped organize the Relief Society in the country, and other auxiliaries like Young Men and Young Women were organized as well. Iceland was dedicated for preaching the gospel in 1977 by Joseph B. Wirthlin. The Book of Mormon was translated into Icelandic and published by the church in 1981. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints became formally recognized by the government in November 1983. The Geslisons returned to Iceland on two more missions and saw the completion of a visitors center and the organization of a branch in Akureyri. Church members across the country were asked to participate in missionary work by serving three-month missions in 1988. In 1994 the church translated the temple ceremony and recorded the voices of native Icelanders. In July 2000 the church dedicated the first meetinghouse in the country. That year, Gordon B. Hinckley, serving as president of the church, visited the saints in Iceland. Latter-day saints were recognized in a permanent museum exhibit at the Vestmannaeyjar Folk Museum. Mission Missionary efforts are conducted under the Denmark Copenhagen Mission, and there are ten young missionaries who are assigned to preach in Iceland, 8 Elders and 2 Sister missionaries, although there is a \\"general religious apathy\\" in the area.

From Mullyash one could see as far as Slieve Gullion, Loughcrew, the Mourne Mountains and Cooley Mountains.

The event took place on October 2, 2016 at Arena Monterrey in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico. It was the tenth annual AAA show held in honor of deceased founder Antonio Pe√±a and featured the Copa Antonio Pe√±a tournament named in his honor won by Pimpinela Escarlata. The main event was scheduled to be a tag team match with the team of Psycho Clown and El Patr√≥n Alberto facing off against Dr. Wagner Jr. and Pagano, but El Patr√≥n Alberto did not show for the match after he was legitimately stabbed outside a restaurant in San Antonio, Texas. That match was moved down to the fifth match of the night and made a three-way match between the remaining competitors. During the match Psycho Clown's long time tag team partners, Murder Clown and Monster Clown, turned rudo on him to allow Dr. Wagner Jr. to win the match. Dr. Wagner Jr. then proceeded to unmask Psycho Clown in the middle of the ring. After the reshuffled card Johnny Mundo defend the AAA Latin American Championship against Garza Jr. in the main event. In the sixth match of the night Daga defeated Australian Suicide in a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, forcing Australian Suicide to unmask. Production =Background= In 1992 then-Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) booker and match maker Antonio Pe√±a left the company alongside a number of wrestlers to form the Mexican professional wrestling, company Asistencia Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n, later known simply as \\"AAA\\". Over the next decade- and-a-half Pe√±a and the team behind AAA built the promotion into one of the biggest wrestling companies in the world. On October 5, 2006 Pe√±a died from a heart attack. After Pe√±a's death his brother-in-law Jorge Roldan took control of the company with both his wife Marisela Pe√±a, Antonio's sister, and Dorian Roldan (their son) also taking an active part in AAA. On October 7, 2007,AAA held a show in honor of Pe√±a's memory, the first ever \\"Antonio Pe√±a Memorial Show\\" (Homenaje a Antonio Pe√±a in Spanish). The following year AAA held the second ever \\"Antonio Pe√±a Memorial Show\\", making it an annual tradition for the company to commemorate the passing of their founder. In 2008 the show was rebranded as H√©roes Inmortales (Spanish for \\"Immortal Heroes\\"), retroactively rebranding the 2007 and 2008 event as H√©roes Inmortales I and H√©roes Inmortales II. AAA has held a H√©roes Inmortales every year since then, with the 2016 version of the show being H√©roes Inmortales X (10). The H√©roes Inmortales hosts the Copa Antonio Pe√±a (\\"Antonio Pe√±a Cup\\") tournament each year, a multi-man tournament with various wrestlers from AAA or other promotions competing for a trophy. The tournament format has usually been either a gauntlet match or a multi-man torneo cibernetico elimination match. Outside of the actual Copa Antonio Pe√±a trophy the winner is not guaranteed any other \\"prizes\\" as a result of winning the tournament. =Storylines= The H√©roes Inmortales X show featured seven professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. In the early part of 2016 Pagano started a storyline feud with Psycho Clown, an AAA wrestler who, like Pagano, used a clown ring character. In Pagano's first match with AAA he, Dami√°n 666 and Nicho defeated Los Psycho Circus (Psycho Clown, Murder Clown and Monster Clown) by count-out. Subsequently, Pagano and Psycho Clown faced off in a Hardcore wrestling match. During the match Pagano lit a wooden table on fire and then threw Psycho Clown through it to win the match. Two weeks later the two clashed again, this time in a match that also included Pentag√≥n Jr., a match that was once again won by Pagano. After defeating Psycho Clown once more on July 8 and stealing Psycho Clown's wrestling mask, Pagano challenged Psycho Clown to put his mask on the line while Pagano would put up his hair in a Luchas de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\". At the time Psycho Clown did not respond to the challenge. At Tripleman√≠a XXIV Psycho Clown defeated Pagano, forcing Pagano to have all his hair shaved off. During the closing moments of the match Dr. Wagner Jr. came to the ring and after the match was over he challenged Psycho Clown to put his mask on the line at Tripleman√≠a XXV the following year. El Patr√≥n Alberto defeated El Texano Jr. to win the AAA Mega Championship at the 2014 Guerra de Titanes show. Over the next year El Patr√≥n defended the championship on several occasions, until he signed a contract with WWE in late 2015, which led to AAA announcing that since the WWE would not allow El Patr√≥n to defend the championship it was vacated and they would hold a tournament to determine a new champion. In September 2016 El Patr√≥n Alberto left WWE, followed by AAA announcing that El Patr√≥n would work the main event of H√©roes Inmortales X, teaming with Psycho Clown to take on Pagano and Dr. Wagner Jr. Long time rivals Daga and Australian Suicide first started to cross paths in early 2014, with their first high-profile match taking place at that year's Rey de Reyes (\\"King of Kings\\") show. At Rey de Reyes Daga successfully defended the AAA World Cruiserweight Championship against Australian Suicide, Argenis and Super Fly. In subsequent months the two found themselves on opposite sides of various trios matches as their rivalry intensified. At Tripleman√≠a XXII Daga put his championship on the line in a multi-man match that also included Australian Suicide and several other wrestlers. During the match Daga eliminated Australian Suicide, but in the end El Hijo del Fantasma pinned Ang√©lico to win the championship. Over the following months Daga and Australian Suicide would interfere in each other's matches as a measure of revenge. During one run in Australian Suicide threw a steel chair at Daga's face with so much force that it gave Daga a black eye and lacerations to the face. The team of Averno and Chessman, also known as Los Hell Brothers won the vacant AAA World Tag Team Championship by defeating the teams of Aero Star/F√©nix and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr./Villano IV at the Guerra de Titanes show. Los Hell Brothers subsequently made several successful title defenses and began bragging about how there were no challengers left for them to deal with, that \\"no man\\" could defeat them. In the spring of 2016 sisters- turned-rivals Mari Apache and Faby Apache reunited as Mari returned to the tecnico side and started to team up with her sister on a regular basis. The two teamed up with their former step-mother Lady Apache and won the women's version of the 2016 Lucha Libre World Cup. Around the time of the World Cup Mari and Faby Apache challenged Los Hell Brothers, demanding that they put the tag team championship on the line, a challenge that Averno and Chessman turned down, acting very dismissing and sexist in the process. During the July 8 AAA Television taping Averno and Chessman dressed up as a pair of frumpy women as they mocked Los Apaches. At the subsequent taping Los Apaches distracted Averno and Chessman during a title defense against Jack Evans and Ang√©lico, which led to Averno and Chessman losing the tag team title. Afterwards it was announced that Averno and Chessman had finally agree to face Los Apaches at Tripleman√≠a XXIV.

With over 850 species distributed over the Northern hemisphere Allium is the sole genus in the Allieae, one of four tribes of subfamily Allioideae (Amaryllidaceae). New species continue to be described and Allium is both highly variable and one of the largest monocotyledonous genera, but the precise taxonomy of Allium is poorly understood, with incorrect descriptions being widespread. The difficulties arise from the fact that the genus displays considerable polymorphism and has adapted to a wide variety of habitats. Furthermore, traditional classications had been based on homoplasious characteristics (what turn out to be independently evolved similar features in species from different lineages). However, the genus has been shown to be monophyletic, containing three major clades, although some proposed subgenera are not. Some progress is being made using molecular phylogenetic methods, and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, including the 5.8S rDNA and the two spacers ITS1 and ITS2, is one of the more commonly used markers in the study of the differentiation of the Allium species. Allium includes a number of taxonomic groupings previously considered separate genera (Caloscordum Herb., Milula Prain and Nectaroscordum Lindl.) Allium spicatum had been treated by many authors as Milula spicata, the only species in the monospecific genus Milula. In 2000, it was shown to be embedded in Allium.  Description  The genus Allium are herbaceous geophytes is characterised by bulbs enclosed in membranous tunics, that may become fibrous and may be carried on rhizomes, with tepals that are free or almost free, and a subgynobasic style. The majority of species produce cysteine sulphoxides that are the source of their distinctive garlic and onion odor and taste. About twenty species are grown as edible crops, such as onions, garlic and leeks, while others are foraged from the wild, such as ramps. Many species are xerophytic and the over 850 species are found almost exclusively in the Northern hemisphere, being particularly diverse in the warm dry summers and cool wet winters of the Mediterranean. The main centre of diversity is the Old World with species rich areas in Central Asia as well as the Mediterranean Basin. A second centre, in the New World, is western North America.  History  Linnaeus' description of Allium, Species Plantarum 1753 Descriptions of Allium taxonomy date back at least as far as Carolus Clusius' Rariarum plantarum historia (1601). When Linnaeus formerly described the genus Allium in his Species Plantarum (1753), there were thirty species with this name. He placed Allium in a grouping he referred to as Hexandria monogynia (i.e. six stamens and one pistil) containing 51 genera in all. In 1763, Michel Adanson, who proposed the concept of families of plants, included Allium and related genera as a grouping within 'Liliaceae' as Section IV, Les Oignons (Onions), or Cepae in Latin. De Jussieu is officially recognised as the first formal establishment of the suprageneric grouping into families (Ordo) in 1789. In this system Allium was one of fourteen genera in Ordo VI, Asphodeles (Asphodeli), of the third class (Stamina epigyna) of Monocots. Jean Henri Jaume Saint-Hilaire (1805), who developed the concept of Amaryllidaceae, continued Jussieu's treatment of Allium under Asphodeli (which he considered synonymous with Adanson's Liliaceae and Jussieu's Asphodeli). He placed Allium in an unnamed monotypic section of Asphodeli defined as Fleurs en ombelle, racine bulbeuse. Calice √† six parties egales (umbellate flowers, bulbous, calyx of six equal parts). Subsequently, de Candolle reverted the family name back to Liliaceae from Asphodeli. He divided the Liliaceae into a series of Ordres, and the second ordre was named Asphod√®les, based on Jussieus' family of that name, in which he placed Allium. The term 'Alliaceae' then reappeared in its subfamilial form, Allieae, in Dumortier's Florula Belgica (1827), with six genera. The 'Alliaceae' have been treated as Allieae within the family Liliaceae (or Aspholecaceae, a partial synonym) by most authorities since. Regel produced a major monograph of the genus in 1875, and this remained the major reference work for over 100 years till the molecularly based study of Friesen and colleagues in 2006. Despite recent advances the precise taxonomy of Allium remains still poorly understood with incorrect descriptions being widespread.  Phylogeny   Subdivision  Linnaeus originally grouped his 30 species into three alliances, e.g. Foliis caulinis planis and as the number of recognised species increased, so did the number of subgroups. Since then, many attempts have been made to divide the growing number of recognised species into infrageneric subgroupings, initially as sections, and then as subgenera further divided into sections. For a brief history, see Friesen et al. (2006) and Li et al. (2010) Regel's 1875 treatise on Allium divided his 262 species between the six sections proposed by Don, in his 1832 monograph on the genus. Stearn (1944) described 14 subgenera. Traub (1968) described 3 subgenera, 36 sections and subsections and about 600 species. By 1992 there were 6 sub-genera, 50 sections and subsections and 600‚Äì700 species. The situation was further confused by the presence of over 1,000 taxonomic names, many of which turned out to be synonyms. The modern era of phylogenetic analysis dates to 1996. In 2006 Friesen, Fritsch, and Blattner described a new classification with 15 subgenera, 56 sections, and about 780 species based on the nuclear ribosomal gene internal transcribed spacers. Some of the subgenera correspond to the once separate genera (Caloscordum, Milula, Nectaroscordum) included in the Gilliesieae. The terminology has varied with some authors subdividing subgenera into Sections and others Alliances. The term alliance has been used for both subgroupings within species, e.g. Allium nigrum, as well as infrageneric subsections. These alliances are informal groupings based on morphological similarity and reflecting hypotheses of evolutionary relationship. and can be used between any two formal ranks. For instance the some 70 North American species were divided into nine well-defined species alliances, of which the largest was the Allium falcifolium alliance with 31 taxa. These alliances are usually referred to as the Ownbey alliances, after Marion Ownbey and were also used by Traub. A number of classification schemes have chosen to retain these, the Traub system not being universally accepted. Subsequent molecular phylogenetic studies have shown the 2006 classification is a considerable improvement over previous classifications, but some of its subgenera and sections are probably not monophyletic. Meanwhile, the number of new species continued to increase, reaching 800 by 2009, 900 by 2016 and the pace of discovery has not decreased. Detailed studies have focused on a number of subgenera, including Amerallium. Amerallium is strongly supported as monophyletic. Subgenus Melanocrommyum has also been the subject of considerable study (see below), while work on subgenus Allium has focused on section Allium, including Allium ampeloprasum, although sampling was not sufficient to test the monophyly of the section. The major evolutionary lineages or lines correspond to the three major clades. Line one (the oldest) with three subgenera is predominantly bulbous, the second, with five subgenera and the third with seven subgenera contain both bulbous and rhizomatous taxa. Banfi and colleagues (2011) have suggested that the phylogenetic trichotomy of this genus Allium sensu lato is sufficiently distinct as to warrant splitting it into three separate genera. Banfi's scheme thus proposes the restoring the three originally separate genera Nectaroscordum Lindl. (type: N. siculum), Caloscordum Herb. (type: C. neriniflorum) and Allium L. sensu stricto (type: A. sativum) to correspond to lines 1-3. = Evolutionary lines and subgenera = The three evolutionary lineages and 15 subgenera here represent the classification schemes of Friesen et al. (2006) and Li (2010), and subsequent additional species and revisions. ;Evolutionary lines and subgenera (number of sections/number of species) * First evolutionary line (3 subgenera) *# Nectaroscordum (Lindl.)

The lineage is considered to represent the most ancient line within Allium, and to be the only lineage that is predominantly bulbous, the other two having both bulbous and rhizomatous taxa. Nectaroscordum and Microscordum are bulbous, but Amerallium contains some rhizomatous elements. Within this lineage Amerallium is a sister group to the other two subgenera (Microscordum+Nectaroscordum). = Subgenus Nectaroscordum= Type species: Allium siculum Disjunct distribution, involving the western Mediterranean (type species) and southwest Asia * Section Nectaroscordum (Lindl.)

Under the alliance system of classification proposed by Ownbey (1966), species north of Mexico and two Mexican endemics were treated as eight informal alliances: the A. acuminatum, A. campanulatum, A. canadense, A. cernuum, A. falcifolium, A. kunthii, A. sanbornii, and A. validum alliances. Traub (1968) then arranged the New World alliances into four sections: Amerallium Traub, Caulorhizideum Traub, Lophioprason Traub, and Rhopetoprason Traub. In addition he arranged the Old World species into 6 sections. Since Traub's revision of the subgenus, two biogeographical sister clades (or alliances) have been recognised. The Old World clade is represented by two relatively small groups from the Mediterranean and East Asia. The larger New World clade by all North American species of Allium. The New World sections are Lophioprason, Amerallium, and Rhophetoprason, while the Old World is represented by sections Arctoprasum, Briseis, Narkissoprason, Molium, Bromatorrhiza and Rhynchocarpum. The subgenus is thought to originate in the Old World, with a later split, and to have its origin in the higher latitudes of East Asia, at the time of transition from Cretaceous to Tertiary, dispersing to western North America. Twelve sections were subsequently recognized, with sections Amerallium and Molium further split into two subsections. ;Distribution Amerallium is widely distributed within North America, Europe, north Africa, Ethiopia, the Caucasus, northern Iran, southeast Tibet, and southwest China. The greatest species diversity occurs in North America with 81 species recognized in the 2002 Flora of North America (north of Mexico) and a further 13 are unique to Mexico, and a total of 26 species recognised there. Within N America, the genus covers most of the area south of the 53rd parallel, including the oak hillsides of California and Oregon, deserts of Nevada and Texas, alpine meadows of Utah and Idaho, prairies of Nebraska and Manitoba, and forest glades of Missouri and Arkansas. ;Uses Both bulbous and rhizomatous species occur in both Old World and New World alliances. The subgenus includes both ornamentals, such as A. moly, A. roseum, A. unifolium and A. neapolitanum, and culinary species such as A. ursinum. 15 Sections Section Amerallium * Section Amerallium (Traub) Kamelin  Allium canadense L.

These three genera are late-branching whereas the remaining two subgenera, Caloscordum and Anguinum are early branching. Of the five subgenera, the large Melanocrommymum and the oligo- or monotypic Caloscordum, Vvedenskya and Porphyroprason are bulbous and the remaining small subgenus Anguinum is rhizomatous. = Subgenus Caloscordum= East Asia ;Sections  Section Caloscordum (Herb.)

It is distributed from the Mediterranean to the Near and Middle East, to north-western China and Pakistan in the east, and southern Siberia in the north. The centre of diversity is Central Asia where it evolved, but its ancestry is located in East Asia. The 2006 classification of Fritsch and colleagues included 150 species but this has continued to grow. An extensive molecular based study in 2010 confirmed its monophyly but showed that the traditional sections were either para- or polyphyletic. On the other hand, a number of monophyletic subgroups were recognised, with about 40 clades, although their exact relationships remained not fully resolved. Consequently, traditional sections required considerable re-alignment. Eventually 160 species and subspecies were recognised in 20 sections and 22 subsections. Description: The subgenus is characterised by true tunicated bulbs, annual roots, leaves that are mostly broad and flat with subterranean sheath parts that are barely visible above the ground, scapes that are strong and most often strictly upright and of varying length, and large, fasciculate to globular inflorescences. The latter are composed of many moderately small to large, often star-like, flowers, and some of which have a sweet or noticeable odor. History: Early (prior to 1950) classifications of Allium included many of the members of this subgenus within the bulbous section, Mollium based on morphological characteristics. Mollium was later raised to subgenus level (and then again reduced to a section of Amerallium after transferring many species to Melanocrommyum. The subgenus was then divided into sections in 1969. Molecular methods in the 1990s confirmed the identity of Melanocrommyum as a distinct monophyletic group, together with the presence of several subgroups, but the deeper relationships remained inconsistent. Subdivision: Subdivision of the subgenus was first proposed by Wendelbo in 1966, proposing section Regeloprason Wendelbo, followed in 1969 by Melanocrommyum Webb & Berthel., Kaloprason K. Koch, Acanthoprason Wendelbo, Megaloprason Wendelbo, and Thaumasioprason Wendelbo. Kamelin (1973) provided an alternative arrangement of sections, which was supplanted by the Gatersleben Allium Group classification (1992) which used a broad range of variables. The use of molecular markers to develop phylogeny began in the 1990s and showed that the subgenus was a well separated taxon with a number of subgeneric groupings. Friesen and colleagues (2006) carried out an extensive molecular phylogenetic study resulting in a taxonomy based on 15 sections. These were then further subdivided into five of the sections to create 17 subsections. While Melanocrommyum itself appeared monophyletic, most of the sections were either para- or polyphyletic, favouring the formation of a larger number of smaller subgroups. In their study there were a number of larger sections with 15‚Äì35 species, Acmopetala, Megaloprason, Regeloprason, Kaloprason, and Acanthoprason. The remaining sections are either oligogotypic with 2‚Äì8 species (Compactoprason, Pseudoprason, Miniprason, Brevicaule, Thaumasioprason, Verticillata) or monotypic (Acaule, Aroidea, Popovia). In a more focused study in 2010 this was expanded to 20 sections and 22 subsections, or in some cases, e.g. section Melanocrommyum (type: A. nigrum) into nine alliances and Acanthoprason into seven. This section is the most diverse one within the subgenus in which subgroups differ according to the relationships of the lengths of leaves and scapes (leaves shorter, equal or longer than scapes) and inflorescences (fasciculate, umbellate or subglobose). The increased number of sections resulted from the splitting of some of the earlier sections, such as Acmopetala. The two species in the resulting section Longibidentata are sister to all the remaining sections (core clade). This section, together with another new section, Decipientia form the basal clade. Although Li et al. (2010) included three sections, their study was confined to species endemic to China. Uses: The subgenus also contains many species grown as ornamentals, such as A. giganteum, A. cristophii, A. schubertii, A. aflatunense, A. atropurpureum, A. nigrum and A. karataviense. These species are predominantly from Southwestern and Central Asia, where they are used for both culinary and medicinal purposes. The latter usage is associated with the presence of cysteine sulphoxides and also radical scavenger activity, although many members of the subgenus possess less of these compounds and lack the distinctive taste and smell of garlic and onion, their properties appear to be associated with dithiodipyrroles and sulfur-pyridins. These substances also occur in the ornamental species, that were introduced into European and North American gardens in the early 19th century, and now are represented by an increasing number of named cultivars and hybrids. Cysteine sulphoxides are also largely responsible for the flavour and spicy taste of these species, predominantly the isomeric cysteine derivatives alliin and isoalliin. 15 sections * Section Acanthoprason Type A. akaka * Section Acaule Type A. hexaceras * Section Acmopetala Type A. backhousianum  7 subsections * Section Aroidea Type A. aroides * Section Asteroprason Type A. elburzense  2 subsections * Section Brevicaule Type A. sergii * Section Compactoprason Type A. giganteum  3 subsections * Section Decipientia Type A. decipiens * Section Kaloprason Type A. caspium  3 subsections * Section Longibidentata Type A. fetisowii * Section Megaloprason Type A. rosenbachianum  4 subsections * Section Melanocrommyum Type A. nigrum * Section Miniprason Type A. karataviense * Section Popovia Type A. gypsaceum * Section Procerallium Type Allium stipitatum  2 subsections * Section Pseudoprason Type A. koelzii * Section Regeloprason Type A. regelii  3 subsections * Section Stellata Type A. taeniopetalum * Section Thaumasioprason Type A. mirum * Section Verticillata Type A. verticillatum ;Sections * Section Acanthoprason Wendelbo Acanthoprason: A. akaka  Allium akaka alliance * Allium akaka S.G.Gmel. ex Schult. & Schult. f.

This subgenus also contains the majority of the species in the line. Within the lineage the phylogeny is complex. Two small subgenera Butomissa and Cyathophora form a sister clade to the remaining five subgenera, with Butomissa as the first branching group. Amongst the remaining five subgenera, Rhizirideum forms a medium-sized subgenus that is the sister to the other four larger subgenera. However, they may not be monophyletic.

This very large subgenus is divided into 15 - 16 sections and demonstrates two main groups. One has been referred to as classical Allium with tripartite inner filaments and only one thick storage cataphyll. The other is more diverse morphologically reflected in less closely related sections. A number of sections appear to be non-monophyletic, including Avulsea, Pallasia, Brevispatha and Kopetdagia. It includes both ornamentals, such as A. sphaerocephalon, A. caeruleum, A. carinatum and A. flavum as well as food crops such as A. sativum and A. ampeloprasum. 16 Sections * Section Allium Type A. sativum * Section Avulsea Type A. rubellum * Section Brevidentia Type A. brevidens * Section Brevispatha Type A. parciflorum * Section Caerulea Type A. caeruleum * Section Codonoprasum Type A. oleraceum * Section Costulatae Type A. filidens * Section Crystallina Type A. crystallinum * Section Eremoprasum Type A. sabulosum * Section Kopetdagia Type A. kopedeganse * Section Longivaginata Type A. longivaginatum * Section Minuta Type A. minutum * Section Mediasia Type A. turkestanicum * Section Multicaulea Type A. lehmannianum * Section Pallasia Type A. pallasii * Section Spathulata Type A. spathulatum ;Sections  Section Allium  This is the largest section with about 114 species, a number of which are economically important, such as A. sativum (garlic) and A. ampeloprasum (leek). This section also expresses frequent polyploidy and contains a number of species whose boundaries have been difficult to establish, notably A. ampeloprasum which includes a number of subspecies and varieties, as well as synonymous species, which have been labelled the \\"A. ampeloprasum complex\\". Horticulturally, it is represented by at least four groups, including leeks, whose exact ancestry has been considered uncertain. In the molecular phylogenetic study by Hirschegger and colleagues (2010) showed section Allium to be a well supported clade with two main subclades, one of which included two smaller clades. All of the tetraploid forms of A. ampeloprasum were resolved in a single clade, and leeks appeared to be more closely allied to A. iranicum and A. atroviolaceum than A. ampeloprasum. Restoration of A. porrum L. was therefore proposed for the tertraploid forms, reserving A. ampeloprasum for the forms known horticulturally as great headed garlic and A. ampeloprasum var. babingtonii. * Section Allium L.

Section Codonoprasum  Section Codonoprason is strongly monophyletic and has its centre of diversity in the Mediterranean region, particularly Greece and Turkey, but extends to other areas of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. It was originally conceived of as a separate genus, Codonoprasum by Reichenbach in 1828. The taxonomy of the section is complicated with inconsistent speciation. In 2005 the section was considered to consist of 58 species and 7 subspecies. The section is characterised as large plants with multiflowered inflorescences, long pedicels, very long spathe valves and a cylindrical-campanulate perigon, with unequal and long-caudate spathe leaves. Historically the section has been considered to have a number of subsections. Friesen recognised 2, while others have described 3, e.g.; : Codonoprasum (Rchb.) Kamelin : Longistamineum Cheshm. ex Omelczuk : Haemoprason (F. Herm.) Cheshm. Many species were previously included in a grouping referred to as the Paniculatum complex. Molecular studies demonstrate the presence of two clades within the section. Clade A contains the two autumn flowering species, Allium tardans and Allium parciflorum as a subclade. Clade B contains the smaller taxa within the section. * Section Codonoprasum Reichenb.  Allium agrigentinum Brullo & Pavone  Allium apergii Trigas, Iatrou & Tzanoudakis  Allium apolloniensis B.

As of 2017, the helmet continues to be worn by US military rifle range cadres, as an icon for marksmanship excellence. The helmet is technically not a pith helmet, insofar as it is not constructed from pith material. However, in the more generic sense of design style, this type of sun helmet is modeled similarly to one and thus often referred to in common use as a pith helmet. Additionally, the helmet is not a combat helmet, insofar as it was not originally designed to protect the head during combat. However, the helmet was nonetheless assigned, at various times in the 1930s and 1940s, as combat gear for use in active theaters. The fiber helmet has been used as a commercial hat for civilians, as well as by the military. At various times, the helmet has been used by all branches of the services, including the military police, marine aviators, officer and enlisted ranks, military parades, graduation ceremonies, and combat training. The helmet has most actively been used by the United States Marine Corps, particularly during marksmanship course training. During World War II, it was issued to all ranks of the Marine service. As of 2017, it is the longest used helmet in US military history, having been worn by soldiers in the Second Sino-Japanese War, World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam War, invasion of Grenada, and the Persian Gulf War. Despite its longevity of service, the fiber helmet was never given a model name. It is officially known as \\"helmet, sun, rigid, fiber.\\" The helmet was originally designed by Jesse Hawley. It was first manufactured by Hawley Products Company in St. Charles, Illinois, and the International Hat Company in St. Louis, for several decades in the 20th century. In the 1960s, a modified version of the helmet was constructed of plastic molding material, as opposed to the original fibrous construction. However, the design remained consistent otherwise. History President Harry Truman's pressed fiber sun helmet. The four folds in the faux puggaree identify this as a Hawley Products model. The fiber helmet was originally designed by Jesse Hawley in the early 1930s. Hawley subsequently designed the first fiber helmet liner for the original M1 steel helmet, alongside the General Fibre Company, a subsidiary of the International Hat Company. The first patent for the Hawley pressed fiber sun helmet was petitioned to the US government in 1935 and subsequently granted in 1938. The International Hat Company was the first manufacturer of the World War II model of fiber helmets for the US Army, beginning in June 1940 to 1946. The US Army began ordering the World War II model of fiber helmets from Hawley Products in January 1941 to June 1942. During their respective production times, Hawley Products created 27,751 fiber helmets for the Army, whereas International Hat generated 27,434. The helmet eventually replaced the traditional but more expensive felt campaign hat. In 1941, the US Marines ordered 44,000 waterproof, khaki fiber helmets to be made of 124 warp and 54 filling of threads per inch, with a maximum weight per square yard of 6 ounces. The helmet was first issued to the First Marine Division during their 1941 deployment to Guantanamo Bay, Cubap. 18 Rill, James C. A Narrative History of the 1st Battalion, 11th Marines During the Early History and Deployment of the 1st Marine Division, 1940-43 Merriam Press, 2003 International Hat produced 20,000 Marine fiber helmets for $1.35 each, while Hawley Products produced 24,000 Marine fiber helmets at a cost of $1.36 each. In December 1942, the Marine quartermaster ordered an additional 100,000 fiber helmets. This included 50,000 to the Depot Quartermaster of San Francisco, 25,000 to the Clothing Officer of San Diego, and 25,000 to the Depot Quartermaster of Philadelphia. Design International Hat Company pressed fiber sun helmet interior design. This post‚ÄìWorld War II model features a detachable liner and chinstrap, unlike the original model. The American pressed fiber sun helmet is known for the simplicity of its design, allowing for easy mass production. An important feature in the original conception of the helmet was to be shaped and contoured from one singular piece. This greatly assisted in making the helmet waterproof. The fiber material kept the helmet light and the soldier unencumbered by headgear. The major drawback in the design was heat. Despite being designed with a series of ventilation holes, the interior of the helmet would eventually become hot in the sun. The chin straps for the World War II model were made by General Fibre Company and Hawley Products Company, the same fiber liner used in the original M1 helmets. The design of the International Hat and Hawley Product versions of the helmet are almost identical. However, the defining difference in identification is that the Hawley Product model has four folds with a wider space between them in the faux puggaree. A puggaree is a type of Indian turban, namely a thin muslin scarf tied around a sun helmet. The International Hat has five thin folds in its faux puggaree. Military helmet historian Peter Suciu describes the fiber helmet design as taking: The original fiber helmets in the 1940s were khaki colored. However, a dark green version of the helmet was produced during the Vietnam War. A white helmet was used by the Military Police Corps in tropical regions. This model of fiber helmets was originally used by the US Navy. These later versions of the helmet had an elasticized chinstrap that was detachable from the helmet. In the case of the original model, the strap was permanently attached to the liner. Gallery File:Admiral William F Halsey.jpgAdmiral Halsey (1944) wearing an American fiber helmet.

The game was held on March 19, 1966 at Cole Field House in College Park, Maryland. The Kentucky Wildcats, the number one ranked team in men's college basketball, faced the Texas Western Miners, who were ranked third in the nation. Texas Western's starting lineup of five African Americans was the first all-black lineup in an NCAA title game; their opponents, by contrast, fielded an all-white squad. The Miners won 72‚Äì65, claiming the school's first national championship in men's college basketball. Their victory challenged assumptions widely held about black players at the time, and major college programs intensified their recruiting efforts towards African-American players in the years following the game. Background =Kentucky= The Wildcats, coached by Adolph Rupp, began the 1965‚Äì66 season with an 83‚Äì55 win over Hardin‚ÄìSimmons University on December 1, 1965. In road games at Virginia and Illinois, Kentucky prevailed by 26 and 18 points respectively. Wins in three games at home gave the Wildcats a 6‚Äì0 win‚Äìloss record, and the team was selected at number ten in the AP Poll, having previously been unranked. After three more victories by margins of 10 points or more, the Wildcats began play in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) on January 8, 1966, at Florida. Kentucky won 78‚Äì64, before a contest in Georgia that required two overtime periods. The Wildcats, by this time up to second in the national rankings, managed a four- point victory. The team reached number one in the AP Poll in the February 8 rankings, and Kentucky's undefeated streak continued into early March. In the Wildcats' next-to-last regular season game, Tennessee handed them their first loss, by a score of 69‚Äì62. With a 103‚Äì74 win over Tulane, Kentucky completed the regular season with a record of 24‚Äì1 (15‚Äì1 in conference play), and had the top ranking in the AP Poll. Forward Pat Riley was the team's leading scorer; including postseason play, he averaged 21.9 points per game, and his 8.9 rebounds per game also led the club. Guard Louie Dampier had a 21.1 point- per-game average and played the most minutes of anyone on the Wildcats' roster. Larry Conley led Kentucky in assists. Kentucky received an invitation to the NCAA Tournament and was placed in the Mideast region. The team did not play in the first round; its first appearance in the tournament came in the regional semifinals against Dayton. With an 86‚Äì79 victory, the Wildcats moved on to the regional final. Playing against Michigan, Kentucky reached the Final Four with a second straight seven-point win. The Wildcats' opponent in the Final Four was Duke, the champion of the East region. The Blue Devils held a one-point lead at halftime, but the Wildcats earned an 83‚Äì79 victory. Dampier led Kentucky with 23 points, while Riley added 19. =Texas Western= Coached by Don Haskins, the Miners' first game was on December 4, 1965, against Eastern New Mexico. Texas Western won by an 89‚Äì38 score, and added eight victories over the next 25 days. On December 30, the Miners faced Iowa, the fourth-ranked team in the country at the time. An 86‚Äì68 win, along with a nine-point victory over Tulsa, saw the Miners enter the January 4 rankings at number nine. Texas Western won three more games in January by double-digit margins. After defeating New Mexico State on February 1, the Miners played at Colorado State, prevailing by two points. An 81‚Äì72 win over Arizona moved the Miners to 17‚Äì0 for the season, and five further victories left them undefeated entering March. Their winning streak reached 23 games, with a second win against New Mexico State. In their last regular season game, the Miners suffered their first loss, against Seattle, 74‚Äì72, leaving them at 23‚Äì1. The team ended the regular season third in the AP Poll, having reached a peak position of second. Bobby Joe Hill had a team-high 15.0 points per game, while Dave Lattin had an average of 14.0 points per game and 8.6 rebounds per game. Orsten Artis and Nevil Shed also averaged more than 10.0 points per game, and Harry Flournoy led the Miners with 10.7 rebounds per game. In contrast to Kentucky, who sportswriter Michael Wilbon later called \\"as white as milk\\", the Miners' entire starting lineup consisted of African-Americans. Texas Western was placed in the Midwest region in the NCAA Tournament. Unlike the Wildcats, the Miners played in the first round of the tournament, defeating Oklahoma City by 15 points. The Miners then faced Cincinnati in a contest that went into overtime; they emerged with a 78‚Äì76 win and a berth in the regional final against Kansas. Texas Western was stretched into double overtime, but they earned an 81‚Äì80 victory and a Final Four appearance. The Miners won by seven points against Utah to reach the national championship game, overcoming a 38-point effort by the Utes' Jerry Chambers. Artis led the Miners in scoring with 22 points; Hill had 18 points, and Willie Worsley added 12. Game summary Cole Field House, site of the game The game took place on March 19 at Cole Field House, on the campus of the University of Maryland, College Park, in front of an announced crowd of 14,253 fans. It was preceded by a third-place contest between the losing teams in the Final Four, Duke and Utah; the Blue Devils won 79‚Äì77. The championship game, which started at 10 p.m., was not broadcast on a major American station, instead airing on tape delay in certain cities. Sports Network Incorporated handled the original broadcast, and the full-length telecast appeared on ESPN in 2016. The Miners fielded an all-black starting lineup for the championship game, becoming the first team ever to do so in an NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament final. Haskins motivated his team by telling them about a promise made by Rupp that his white Kentucky team would not be defeated by an all-African-American lineup. The rotation employed by Haskins in the final consisted exclusively of black players, with two African-American bench players used along with the five starters. Haskins said of his roster choices that he had \\"played [his] best players, who happened to be black.\\" Riley won the opening tip for Kentucky, but the referee ruled that he had illegally jumped too early and awarded possession to Texas Western. On the Wildcats' first possession, Lattin committed a foul on Riley while trying to block his shot. Twice in the early stages of the game, Lattin scored on slam dunks; this came after Haskins had told him to dunk as early as possible, in an attempt to \\"send a message\\" to Kentucky. Defensively, the Wildcats utilized a 1‚Äì3‚Äì1 zone; in response to their move, Haskins opted to start three guards in the Miners' lineup, as Worsley joined Hill and Artis. The teams were tied at 9‚Äì9 before a Miners free throw which put them in front. Hill had steals on two straight Wildcats possessions around midway through the first half, and scored following each turnover. The sequence gave the Miners a larger lead, and was described by writer Frank Deford as a turning point in the game. The second dunk by Lattin followed, which gave the Miners a 16‚Äì11 advantage. Writer Curry Kirkpatrick described the game as \\"slow, tedious, [and] almost flat.\\" Future college basketball coach Gary Williams, who was in attendance, later complimented the Miners' ball movement, recalling that \\"There were possessions where Texas Western passed it 10 times before taking a shot. At halftime, Texas Western led by three points, 34‚Äì31. Kentucky rallied to within a point of Texas Western in the opening three minutes of the second half, but could not catch them even when they had three shots in a row to achieve a tie. Behind scores by Artis and Hill, the Miners recorded six consecutive points to extend their lead. Texas Western maintained their lead with effective free throw shooting; over a 37-minute period, the Miners attempted 27 free throws, making all but one. Texas Western ultimately took a nine-point advantage and was able to control the pace; Gordon S. White Jr. of The New York Times wrote that their margin was \\"safe enough for the fancy ball-handlers to slow the game during the last three minutes. Dribbles by Cager took the final few seconds off of the clock, as the Miners won 72‚Äì65 to earn the NCAA University Division title. It was the school's first men's college basketball championship, and remains their only one as of the 2019-20 season. Statistical summary Hill was the game's leading scorer with 20 points, on 7-of-17 shooting. Lattin added 16 points for the Miners, while Artis had 15 points; both players were perfect on free throws, as Lattin made all of his six attempts and Artis converted five. Lattin recorded nine rebounds on the night, while Artis had eight and Willie Cager contributed six. For the Wildcats, Riley and Dampier each tallied 19 points. Conley, with 10 points, was the only other Kentucky player to record double-digit points on the night. Dampier matched Lattin's total of nine rebounds, and Conley and Tommy Kron had eight and seven respectively. Texas Western converted 22 of their 49 field goal attempts, for a 44.9% total. The team made more than 80% of their free throws, missing only six of 34 attempts. Kentucky's shooters were held to 38.6% shooting in the game, making 27 of 70 field goals. The Wildcats were successful on all but two of their free throws, but they had 21 fewer attempts than the Miners. Kentucky committed nearly twice as many fouls (23) as Texas Western, who had 12 fouls called against them. Two Kentucky players ‚Äì Conley and Thad Jaracz ‚Äì fouled out of the game, while two others ended the contest with four fouls. Texas Western had a 35‚Äì33 rebounding advantage for the game. Aftermath The 1966 NCAA University Division Championship Game is primarily remembered for Texas Western's victory with its entirely African-American starting lineup, which challenged stereotypes of the era. At the time, it was commonly believed that teams with all-black lineups would not play with self-control; Perry Wallace, the first black basketball player to compete in the SEC, said, \\"There was a certain style of play whites expected from blacks.\\" Before the game, the Miners were portrayed in the media as a team with weak defending and an up-tempo offense, when their actual playing style was vastly different. Worsely said that \\"We were more white-oriented than any of the other teams in the Final Four,\\" in terms of playing with discipline. After leading Texas Western to the championship, Haskins received many racist letters, along with some claiming that he was exploiting black players. According to Haskins, death threats were made against the Miners before a game against SMU the following season. The 1966‚Äì67 Wildcats finished with a 13‚Äì13 record, following a back injury suffered by Riley in the offseason that limited his effectiveness. A victory over Alabama in the last game of the season was required to prevent Rupp from having more losses than wins for the first time. Rupp coached Kentucky for five more seasons, through 1971‚Äì72. His teams made the NCAA Tournament in each of the five seasons, but were unable to reach the Final Four. Texas Western entered 1966‚Äì67 ranked second in the country, and remained in the top 10 throughout the season. The Miners were defeated by Pacific in their second NCAA Tournament game and finished at 22‚Äì6. That year, the school was renamed to the University of Texas at El Paso, its current name. It took three seasons for UTEP to return to the NCAA Tournament; Haskins coached the Miners through the 1998‚Äì99 season. In the first season after the 1966 title game, all conferences in the Southern U.S. featured at least one black men's basketball player. This marked a change from the 1965‚Äì66 season, when numerous Southern conferences, such as the SEC and Atlantic Coast Conference, had not yet integrated. Large college programs began to more actively recruit African Americans for their basketball rosters, removing unofficial quotas that had been in place. By 1985, the number of black players in Division I more than doubled. Kirkpatrick wrote that the game \\"changed the sport forever. And maybe changed a nation as well.\\" Footnotes References NCAA University Division Basketball Championship Game NCAA University Division Basketball Championship Game Category:Basketball in Maryland Category:College Park, Maryland Category:College sports in Maryland Category:Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball Category:March 1966 sports events Category:NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Games Category:Sports competitions in Maryland Category:UTEP Miners men's basketball ","title":"1966 NCAA University Division Basketball Championship Game"},{"id":"51760393","text":"Yoon Da-gyeong () is a South Korean actress.

It has rough bark on the trunk and branches, egg-shaped or lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and urn-shaped to spherical fruit. Description The tree typically grows to a height of with tessellated, red-brown, dull, grey or pink bark that is persistent on the trunk and lower branches. The bark sheds in small polygonal flakes giving the tree a mottled appearance. Young plants and coppice regrowth have elliptical to egg-shaped, later lance-shaped leaves that are long and wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, more or less the same shade of dull grey-green on both sides, lance-shaped to broadly lance-shaped or curved, long and wide, tapering at the base to a narrowly flattened petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven buds on thin pedicels long. Mature buds are oval or pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded, sometimes pointed operculum. The tree will bloom between January to April and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody urn- shaped to more or less spherical capsule long and wide. The seeds are boat- shaped or oval and reddish brown with a wing on the end. Taxonomy and naming The first formal description of this species was by William Blakely in 1934 who published the description in his book A Key to the Eucalypts and gave it the name Eucalyptus erythrophloia. The type specimens were collected by Thomas Lane Bancroft (1860‚Äì1933) near Eidsvold in 1919. In 1995, botanists Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson defined the genus Corymbia, identifying the bloodwoods, ghost gums and spotted gums as a group distinct from Eucalyptus and they changed the name Eucalyptus erythrophloia to Corymbia erythrophloia. Distribution and habitat Corymbia erythrophloia is found down the east coast of Queensland as far north as Queenstown on the Cape York Peninsula where it is found as far west as the Gulf of Carpentaria. The range then extends as far south as the Hervey Bay with an isolated population found further south to the west of Brisbane. It is found on grassy woodlands or low rolling hills containing clayey or stony soils mostly of volcanic origin. It is often found in association with mountain coolibah or the silver-leaved ironbark. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as of \\"least concern\\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. Use in horticulture The tree can be grown as a shade tree that is a bird attractor in gardens where it can tolerate a hot overhead sun and dry soils. Soils can be ordinary or enriched, containing clay and mildly acidic to mildly alkaline. Trees are pruned to retain one main trunk sometimes are allowed multiple trunks which are well-spaced to develop.

Biography He was born to poor family in Ripabottoni in the province of Campobasso, region of Molise. His father was a decorative painter. An encounter with bishop of Larino in 1731 led to a recommendation for the young Paolo to study under Francesco Solimena in Naples. He was highly prolific in painting sacred subjects in the region, including for Ripabottoni, Larino, Fossalto, Agnone and Castelpetroso. His first documented works were a series of frescoes (1740) in the sacristy and church of the convent of the Cappuccini in Sant'Elia a Pianisi. For the church of Santa Maria Assunta in Ripabottoni, he painted many works, including canvases depicting a Madonna of the Purgatory, Madonna of the Rosary St Roch, a 'Presentation of the Virgin at the Temple and a number of frescoes: Virtue and Prophets in medallions. For the church of Maria della Concezione in the same town, he painted an Immaculate Conception, an Assumption of the Virgin, an Annunciation, and medallions with stories of the new testament. During 1738-1745, he painted for the parish church of Montorio nei Frentani. He painted a Madonna del Purgatorio for the church of San Giovanni Battista a Colletorto. He painted a Offering of Melchisedech for the church of Santa Maria Assunta of Fossalto. In 1771, he again painted for the church of San Francesco in Agnone. In 1774, he painted again in the church of Santa Maria Assunta of Fossalto, this time frescoes in the presbytery depicting: Sacrifice of Isaac, Transport of the Holy Ark, and Cain an Abel. In 1774, he painted an Immaculate Conception surrounded by the Evangelists in the apse of San Martino a Campodipietra.

Frelserens Church is the main church for the town. History The village of Farsund grew up around a protected harbour on the Lyngdalsfjorden. It was a sheltered place for merchant ships to dock as opposed to the nearby ports at Lista or Lindesnes which were exposed to the open ocean. The merchant, Jochum Brinch Lund is often referred to as the founder of the town since he was instrumental in the village receiving town status as a kj√∏psted (lading place) in 1795. Since then, Farsund became a very busy commercial and shipping port. On 1 January 1838, the town of Farsund was established as a municipality of its own (see formannskapsdistrikt). The small town existed on its own for many years. On 1 January 1903, a small area (population: 99), just outside the town of Farsund, was transferred into the town of Farsund from the neighboring municipality of Vanse. Again, in 1948 another small area (population: 64) was transferred into the town of Farsund from the neighboring municipality of Lista. During the 1960s, there were many major municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee.

Walker is currently Deputy Director of the Beyond Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science at Arizona State University, Associate Director of the ASU-SFI Center for Biosocial Complex Systems and an associate professor at Arizona State University (ASU). She is a co-founder of the astrobiology social network SAGANet.org, and on the board of directors for Blue Marble Space a nonprofit education and science organization. She has appeared on multiple media sources, such as \\"Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman\\", to communicate science to the public. Education and background Walker was born and raised in Connecticut. She studied at the Florida Institute of Technology where she graduated cum laude earning a B.S. in Physics in 2005. She received a Ph.D. in Physics and Astronomy in 2010 from Dartmouth College. Her thesis was Theoretical Models for the Emergence of Biomolecular Homochirality and her doctoral advisor was Marcelo Gleiser. Career After graduating Dartmouth, Walker began a postdoctoral fellowship at the Georgia Institute of Technology working at the NSF/NASA Center for Chemical Evolution. In 2011 she accepted a NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellowship with the NASA Astrobiology Institute and began working at Arizona State University (ASU). In 2013, Walker became an assistant professor at the School of Earth and Space Exploration as well as the Beyond Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science at ASU. She became a faculty member for the Center for Social Dynamics and Complexity, as well as a graduate faculty member for the Department of Physics and Complex Systems Initiative at ASU in 2014. In 2015, Walker began a fellowship at the ASU-SFI Center for Biosocial Complex Systems as part of a joint educational and research program between Santa Fe Institute and Arizona State University. Research Walker is a theoretical physicist and astrobiologist with research interests in the origin of life. She seeks to develop new theories of physics to explain what life is, how it emerged, and what signs of life might look like on other planets. She uses mathematical models to investigate chemical evolution and the development of networks on Prebiotic Earth. She looks at information flow in biotic and abiotic systems to further define life and its emergence. Some of the highlights of her work in this field so far are: =The origin of homochirality= Walker has studied the possible mechanisms of the origin of homochirality, which is a key problem in the origin of life. In her research she has used several models such as the Sandars polymerization model, the Langevin equation, and the activation- polymerization-epimerization-depolymerization (APED) model to imitate potential prebiotic conditions for autocatalytic polymerization networks. Walker et al. discovered that only networks with long polymers show potential to produce significant spontaneous asymmetrical chirality in speculative early Earth conditions. Walker and her colleagues, have also shown that the violent environment of prebiotic Earth would have continuously changed the chirality of reaction networks by a mechanism they termed punctuated chirality. This suggests that the origin of homochirality was not a singular event, and that chiral selection occurred at the same time as the origin of life. Walker and Gleiser also revealed that homochiral proto-domains can form in the middle of racemic networks, and that the slowdown of these networks through processes such as tidal motion or evaporating pools could have led to the stabilization of these structures on early Earth. The results of these simulations have helped to reveal what possibly occurred during the origin of homochiralty, and its effect on the origin of life. =Information flow in biological systems= One of the major challenges in studying the origin of life has been the inability to clearly define what life is. In her investigations, Walker has used the flow of information in systems as a means to distinguish life from non-life. She used the Boolean network model, information theory, and other models to discern feasible universal traits for life. It was shown that in biological systems the components are subordinate to the whole, in what is called top-down causation. Furthermore, a logistical model of Walker et al. suggested that major evolutionary transitions, such as the origin of life, could be characterized by a reverse of information flow in a system from bottom-up to top-down. They also determined that living systems have a separation of data from machinery, and non-trivial replication. Walker has shown theoretically how the occurrence of these biotic traits in an abiotic system present a possible framework for the origin of life. Public engagement Walker is an advocate for the communication of science to the public, and has participated in many interviews, panels, and lectures to discuss her research and topics related to her fields of study.

The building is today part of Lyngby Library and is connected to the main library building by a glazed corridor in its north gable. History The property traces its history back to 1748 when the French envoy in Copenhagen, Abb√© Lemaire, constructed a country site next to Lyngby Church. It was located on rented land and belonged to the land owner Jean Henri Desmerci√®res after Lemaire was called back to France in 1753. He sold it to the merchant Reinhard Iselin in 1757. The property was 1767 purchased by the printmaker and later professor at the Royal Academy Johan Martin Preisler. He belonged to \\"Bernstorffsk'e Circle\\", a group of German civil servants, writers and artists associated with the influential Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff. The group met at Preisler's house in Lyngby in the summer time from 1761. The most notable member of the group was the poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock who lived in Denmark from 1751 to 1770. A great lover of nature, he went for walks in the surrounding countryside in the summer time and ice skated on Lyngby Lake in winter. Klopstock's Oak at Prinsessestien is named after him. From 1754 to 1758, Klopstock lived with his wife Meta in Lyngby during the summer months, probably together with his brother August who managed a silk factory founded by Klopstock 's friend Hermann Rahn at a site just north of the church in 1752. After his wife's death in childbirth in 1758, Klopstock no longer spend his summers in Lyngy but he was still a frequent visitor in Preisler's house until 1770. Another member of the circle was the German court pastor Johan Andreas Cramer who owned a country house at nearby Stades Krog from 1756 to 1768. Friedrich Gabriel Resewitz, who was pastor at the German church in Copenhagen, owned J√¶gerg√•rden at Prinsessestien from 1769 to 1773. When J. H. E. Bernstorff was fired by Struense in 1770 and left Denmark, the circle slowly disintegrated but Preisler owned the house in Lyngby for another 20 years. His guests included the German priest Balthasar M√ºnter, who visited him together with his daughter Friederike, the later wife of Constantin Brun and a well-known salonist at Sophienholm. The house was acquired by Hother M√ºffelmann in 1875. He introduced the current name which refers to a farm in Gram that he leased. The building was acquired by Lyngby-Taarb√¶k Municipality in 1955 and housed Lyngby Library's department of music from 1963. Today Lyngby Library's music department moved out in 2004 and the building has since then been used as office space and for meetings and teaching purposes.

History and classification G. incertus is known from a single ant found in Russia. The specimen was described from a compression fossil preserved in diatomite deposits of the Bol‚Äôshaya Svetlovodnaya site. The site is exposed on the bank of Barachek Creek upstream from the creeks confluence with the Bol‚Äôshaya Svetlovodnaya River in the Pozharsky District, on the Pacific Coast of Russia. The fossil-bearing rocks preserve possibly Priabonian plants and animals which lived in and around a small lake near a volcano. The site has been attributed to either the Maksimovka or Salibez Formations and compared to the Bembridge Marls and Florissant Formation, both of which are Priabonian in age. At the time of description, the part and counterpart holotype specimen, PIN 3429/1183 & PIN 3429/1164 was preserved in the A. A. Borissiak Paleontological Institute collections, part of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The fossil, an isolated head of a queen, was first described by the trio of paleomyrmecologists Gennady Dlussky, Alexandr Rasnitsyn, and Ksenia Perfilieva. In the type description, Dlussky, Rasnitsyn, and Perfilieva named the species G. incertus, with the specific epithet derived from the Latin incertus meaning \\"doubtful\\". G. incertus is distinguished from the other two species of Gesomyrmex described from Bol‚Äôshaya Svetlovodnaya in several ways. With a long head, the queen of Gesomyrmex magnus is much larger than the single G. intertus queen. Gesomyrmex macrops is distinguished from G. intertus in that the queen has a much larger eye diameter to head length than either other species. The shape of the rear edge of the G. intertus head capsule along with the elongated head is unique among the Gesomyrmex species. Description The head of the holotype queen is approximately long by wide. The rectangular head capsule has sides that are almost parallel to each other and ending at rounded back corners. Unlike the other species of Gesomyrmex, the back edge is concave in profile and the sides of the head are faintly concave. The mandibles have four total teeth on the chewing margins.

This formation had an extremely short career, coming under devastating attack in the north of the Crimea on the day of its redesignation and being officially disbanded just over a month later. A second division began forming in the Transbaikal in February 1942, and served in the defensive and offensive fighting around Stalingrad, eventually distinguishing itself sufficiently to be redesignated as the 82nd Guards Rifle Division. The world had not seen the last of the 321st, however, as a new division was formed from two existing rifle brigades in the spring of 1944, which gave very creditable service for the duration, completing its combat path in northeastern Germany, and serving into the postwar period. 1st Formation The 2nd Crimea Militia Division began forming on August 20, 1941 at Yevpatoria. By September 11 it was considered \\"ready for the front\\", like its \\"sister\\", the 1st Crimea Militia Division.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", Soviet Militia Units, Rifle and Ski Brigades 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. XI, Nafziger, 1996, p. 123 On September 24 the division was redesignated as the 321st Rifle Division.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 78 It came under the command of Col. Ivan Mikhailovich Aliev on the same day. Its basic order of battle was as follows: * 484th Rifle Regiment * 488th Rifle Regiment * 493rd Rifle Regiment * 986th Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 75 Colonel Aliev would remain in command of the 1st Formation for its short existence. The division was assigned to 51st Army of Crimean Front but was still forming up in October, now in the Separate Coastal Army, when the German 11th Army broke into the Crimea from the north, through the Perekop Isthmus. The 321st was directly in the path of this offensive. After being thrown out of its positions the army commander, Gen. Ivan Petrov, ordered a retreat back to Yevpatoria. On October 31 the German motorized advance detachment of 11th Army captured that city, and the 321st had already been cut off and reduced to fragments.Robert Forczyk, Where the Iron Crosses Grow, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, UK, 2014, pp. 62, 66 As there were no resources in the Crimea to rebuild the division, on that same date the 321st was officially disbanded.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 75, states that the disbanding date was October 13, which is also implied by Commanders of Corps and Divisions in the Great Patriotic War, 1941 - 1945. 2nd Formation A new division began forming on February 26, 1942 in Chita Oblast in the Transbaikal Military District. Its order of battle remained the same as that of the first formation. Lt. Col. Aleksei Ivanovich Valugin was appointed to command on the same date, and he would hold that post, in the same rank, for nearly six months. Although the divisional headquarters formed at Chita, the division's components were formed all over the Transbaikal and the Mongolian People's Republic.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p. 122 In March, the division was noted as having 85% of its personnel of Yakut or Buryat nationality.David M. Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 594 In May and June the division was assigned to 36th Army in Transbaikal Front for training, and in July was railed west, where it arrived in the 21st Army of Stalingrad Front on July 20.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 122 The 321st saw its first action nine days later, following these orders from the STAVKA to Stalingrad Front: As with many others, the planned assault faltered with very little to show for it, largely because not enough time was available to coordinate and control it properly.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, p. 245 By early August the division had been transferred to the 4th Tank Army which was trying to hold a 50km-wide bridgehead on the west bank of the Don while also protecting the approaches to Stalingrad from the northwest. The 321st did its best to reinforce the army's right flank. On August 13, German Sixth Army launched a diversionary attack against this flank with its XI Army Corps. As reported to the STAVKA: The attack forced the division to withdraw, as the Sixth Army commander, Gen. Paulus, expected, and 4th Tank Army reinforced the sector with antitank assets. In spite of this setback, the division was in better state than most of the rest of its army, which was rapidly being encircled; on August 14, 4th Tank Army reported the 321st had a total of 7,544 men. In conjunction with arriving forces of 1st Guards Army, the 321st was ordered into a counterstroke on August 17 to try to retrieve the situation, but this effort failed, and on August 20 its strength had fallen to 4,356 men. Only the timely arrival of 38th and 40th Guards Rifle Divisions prevented the German corps from liquidating the narrow bridgehead south of the Don from Kremenskaya to Sirotinskaya. This bridgehead would later cause the German Army much grief. However, the 321st was by now decimated, and was transferred to 1st Guards Army.Glantz, To the Gates, pp. 304, 310, 312-16, 560-61 On August 24 Maj. Gen. Ivan Alekseevich Makarenko took command of the division, which he would hold for the duration of the 2nd Formation. As of September 3 the division was back in 21st Army, still in the Kremenskaya bridgehead. On the following day it was ordered to attack XI Corps again, in an attempt to prevent 22nd Panzer Division from moving eastward towards Stalingrad. This made little impression, and for the next months the 321st continued to hold its positions and rebuild.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, p. 34, 46 =Operation Uranus= In November the division was transferred to 65th Army (the former 4th Tank Army) on the right flank of Don Front. In the planning for Operation Uranus, 21st Army was to have a leading role in breaking out of the Kletskaya bridgehead, but the 65th was to provide support on its left. On November 19 the 321st concentrated its forces on a 4km sector from Melo-Kletskii to Melo-Logovskii. Its immediate objective was to strike southwards on both sides of the Mokryi Log Balka, which was the boundary between Romanian Third Army and German Sixth Army, and force them apart. In the event, the 321st and the neighboring 304th Rifle Division ran up against skillfully fortified German strongpoints which pinned them down, leading to negligible gains. On the third day, these divisions were still grinding forward, forcing the 376th Infantry Division to fall back to its next positions, but the 321st had to be partially pulled out for rest and refitting. On the 23rd the division was ordered to reinforce 4th Guards Rifle Division to seize Khmelevskii. On this same day, Sixth Army was encircled, and the battle became a siege.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book One, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, pp. 75-76, 197, 205-08, 355 Due to orders from the STAVKA, on November 27 the 321st, plus two other divisions of 65th Army, redeployed south to reinforce 5th Tank Army, which was struggling to capture German strongpoints on the Don and Chir Rivers. By the next day the division, along with 40th Guards Rifle Division, was getting into position to attack the German positions at Oblivskaia. On November 30, an attack by the 321st, a regiment of guardsmen, and two cavalry divisions, failed to take this strongpoint, although some gains were made. In the following days, the division was ordered to go to the defensive.Glantz, Endgame, Book One, pp. 420, 476, 482 On December 6 the 321st and the neighboring 119th Rifle Divisions were ordered to prepare an attack to begin at dawn on December 9 to \\"force the [Chir] river, seize a bridgehead, and protect the commitment of the [newly-arrived 5th Mechanized] corps during the first half of the day.\\" On the appointed day and time two regiments of each division attacked on a 6km-wide sector from the outskirts of Surovikino westwards to the village of Sekretov, easily crossing the frozen surface of the river, with two mechanized brigades concentrated in the rear, ready to exploit southward. However, the advance battalions of the rifle regiments came up against heavy fire from Group Stahel's Battlegroup Weicke, defending the south bank with the 301st Panzer Detachment and an Estonian police battalion. As well, German artillery delivered heavy flanking fire on the riflemen, forcing them to go to ground. General Romanenko, commander of 5th Tank Army, was present, and ordered that the offensive be postponed until the next day, when it would be spearheaded by the mechanized troops. On December 10 the 321st successfully eliminated the German bridgehead on the north bank at Sekretov, but remained unable to force its own way across.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, pp. 47-48, 60-62, 64 =Operation Little Saturn= The next phase of Soviet operations against the Axis forces in the Stalingrad region began on December 16. At this time the 321st was one of six rifle divisions in 5th Tank Army. The Army had been reduced by transfers to 5th Shock Army and its 1st Tank Corps was \\"burned out\\" from previous fighting so its role in the offensive, beginning on December 18, was primarily to pin down the 11th Panzer Division on the lower Chir to prevent it intervening to assist the Italian Eighth Army, which was the main target of the offensive. 5th Mechanized Corps attacked out of the narrow bridgehead it had won a week earlier, while the 321st began its assault across the river before dawn, seizing the village of Dalne-Podgorskii with small forward detachments, before the defenders could react. These were followed by the main forces of the division's regiments, which drove southward, overwhelming the defenses of 7th German Air Force Division's Battlegroup Wagner and throwing them back 6 - 8km to the rear. The combined attack threatened to turn the flanks of not just the 7th GAF but the 336th Infantry Division as well. This forced 11th Panzer to intervene on the 19th, engaging 5th Mechanized west of Sovkhoz No. 79. The accounts of this fighting from each side vary greatly, but it appears that the German armor recaptured about half the ground lost by 7th GAF the day before. 5th Mechanized stabilized the situation by the end of the day in heavy fighting, and the resistance of both this unit and the 321st on December 20 forced 11th Panzer to give up its hopes of restoring the defenses along the Chir and go over to the defense. After continued fighting over the next two days, 5th Mechanized handed its sector over to the 321st and moved back to replenish after heavy losses. As of December 29 the division was maintaining its pressure, along with 40th and 54th Guards Rifle Divisions on Group Stahel of Corps Mieth in its Tormosin salient between the Don and Chir rivers.Glantz, Endgame, Book Two, pp. 232, 247-55, 273 Following the German surrender in Stalingrad, the 321st continued to serve under 5th Tank Army in the following offensives into the lower Don and Donbass regions. In recognition of these successes, on March 19, 1943, the division was re-designated as the 82nd Guards Rifle Division.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 122. Sharp gives the new designation of the division as the 182nd Guards, but this is obviously a typo. 3rd Formation After an absence of over a year from the Red Army order of battle, a new 321st Rifle Division began forming from April to May 9, 1944, in the 1st Shock Army of 2nd Baltic Front, based on cadres from the 14th Rifle Brigade and the 137th Rifle Brigade.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm,\\" p. 123 =14th Rifle Brigade= This brigade was formed as a student brigade from training (reserve) units in the North Caucasus Military District in October 1941. It was assigned to the Moscow Military District in December.Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys, p. 87 During that month it helped to defend the capital, before being reassigned to the 1st Guards Rifle Corps in the reserves of Northwestern Front. The brigade served in the difficult fighting around Demyansk through the late winter until the rasputitsa intervened. At this point it was pulled back to the reserves for rebuilding, then was committed again in June 1942, now directly under 1st Shock Army in the same Front. In October it was back in 1st Guards Rifle Corps, and took part in several other fruitless attacks around Demyansk which left it so depleted that it was withdrawn all the way to the Volga Military District for another rebuilding at the end of the year.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", p. 13 In early February 1943, the brigade was railed north to join Volkhov Front, and it joined 54th Army prior to Operation Polar Star. In the event this offensive made few gains on this part of the front.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd. Solihull, UK, 2011, p. 413 In July, German Army intelligence, based on prisoners and captured documents, identified the order of battle of the brigade as follows: *3 rifle battalions, each: 3 rifle companies (50 - 60 men, 6 - 8 light machine guns, 2 50mm mortars each) 1 machine gun company with 5 - 6 heavy machine guns 1 mortar company with 5 - 6 82mm mortars 1 sub-machine gun platoon 1 AT rifle platoon 1 reconnaissance (scout) platoon *1 sapper company *1 reconnaissance company *1 artillery battalion with horse drawn 45mm and 76mm cannon By September each rifle battalion had been reinforced as follows: *1 antitank company (4 76mm cannon) *1 sniper platoon *1 sub-machine gun company (expanded from the platoon of July) After the end of 1943 the brigade was assigned to the 115th Rifle Corps, still in 54th Army. During the Leningrad-Novgorod Offensive the 14th was one of the units credited for the liberation of Chudovo on January 29, 1944, and was given its name as an honorific.http://www.soldat.ru/spravka/freedom/1-ssr-6.html When Volkhov Front was disbanded in February 1944, the 14th was moved back to 1st Shock Army, now in 2nd Baltic Front. In April it was pulled back from the front lines and disbanded.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", pp. 13-14 =137th Rifle Brigade= Forming in December 1941, in the Siberian Military District,Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys, p. 103 this brigade was moving in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command by the end of February 1942, and joined 54th Army in Leningrad Front in March, just south of Lake Ladoga. the 54th was moved to Volkhov Front by June, and the 137th was assigned to 4th Guards Rifle Corps.Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad 1941 - 1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, p. 221 In August and September the brigade fought under these commands in the Second Sinyavino Operation. Badly damaged, like most other Soviet units in this offensive, it was removed to Moscow Military District for rebuilding.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", p. 62 Once rested and restored, in February 1943, the 137th was briefly assigned to the new 68th Army forming behind Northwestern Front. By the beginning of April it was moved to 1st Shock Army, but by the end of June the unit was back in the reserves of the Front. In September it joined 34th Army, also in Northwestern Front, where it fought both as a separate unit and as part of 96th Rifle Corps.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", pp. 62-63 It was in 14th Guards Rifle Corps of 1st Shock during the Leningrad-Novgorod Offensive on February 24, 1944, when it shared credit with several other units for the liberation of the key transport hub of DnoGlantz, Leningrad, p. 399 and according was given the town's name as an honorific.http://www.soldat.ru/spravka/freedom/1-ssr-2.html The brigade remained in 1st Shock until April when it was disbanded.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", p. 63 Baltic Campaign The new division inherited the battle honors from these brigades; it also inherited the Order of the Red Banner from the 14th. Col. Vasilii Konstantinovich Chesnokov was given command of the division, which he would hold until the end of the war. The division's order of battle remained the same as that of the first two formations.According to Sharp; Russian Wikipedia lists the rifle regiments as the 72nd, 74th and 79th. It was assigned to the 90th Rifle Corps. By mid-June the division was probably still absorbing and training new men, and the corps itself was only recently formed, so at the outset of Operation Bagration it was given a relatively easy assignment: holding attacks against units of German 16th Army.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 83-87 On July 8, as its Front entered the general offensive, the 321st was facing the German Panther Line defenses about 20 km east of Ostrov.The Gamers, Inc., Baltic Gap, Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2009, p. 18 After a severe battle of attrition, the city was finally liberated on the 21st. A few days later, the division was transferred to the 111th Rifle Corps of 54th Army in 3rd Baltic Front, and by August 1 was advancing into Latvia. Before the month's end it was back in 1st Shock Army, which was now also in 3rd Baltic Front, and by September 12 the 321st had reached positions north of Gulbene, nearly on the Estonian border.Baltic Gap, p 22, 29 The attrition had taken its toll, and a few days later the division was withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rebuilding; while there it was assigned to the 116th Rifle Corps of 2nd Shock Army. It would remain under these commands for the duration. By the end of October the 2nd Shock Army was assigned to 2nd Belorussian Front, where it would also serve for the duration.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm,\\" p. 123 Into Germany With the rest of its Front, the 321st participated in the Vistula-Oder Offensive. When the Front's attack began on January 14, 1945, 2nd Shock Army was tasked to break out of the Rozan bridgehead across the Narew River, with the immediate goal of taking the town of Ciechanow and then, in conjunction with 65th Army, to eliminate the enemy in the Pultusk area. The 321st, along with its corps, was in reserve, and did not see action on that first day, nor the following. On the 17th, 2nd Shock liberated Ciechanow, but 116th Corps remained in second echelon.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. and trans. Richard W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, pp. 130, 186, 199, 201, 206 By February 20, when the offensive was about to enter its second stage, the 321st was fighting, along with its corps and army, on the line of the Nogat and Vistula Rivers. As it entered its third stage on March 6, units of the 116th Corps, with the support of 8th Guards Tank Corps, broke through the German defenses and began fighting street-by-street for the town of Preussisch Stargard.Prelude to Berlin, pp. 312, 323 Following this fighting in East Prussia the division was redeployed to take part in the East Pomeranian Offensive, and then the Berlin Strategic Offensive Operation, ending the war near Stralsund on the Baltic coast.Glantz & Jonathan House, When Titans Clashed, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1995, pp. 267, 270 Postwar By the conclusion of hostilities, the division had been awarded the full title of 321st Rifle, Chudovo-Dno, Order of the Red Banner Division (Russian: 321-—è —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∫–æ–≤–∞—è –ß—É–¥–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ-–î–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–∑–Ω–∞–º—ë–Ω–Ω–∞—è –¥–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—è). It became part of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, still in the 116th Rifle Corps of 2nd Shock Army, where it remained until being withdrawn to Dnipropetrovsk in the Kharkov Military District in February 1946. The division became part of the 14th Guards Rifle Corps and in May 1946 became the 38th Rifle Brigade. The brigade and its corps became part of the Kiev Military District months later. In March 1947, the brigade was disbanded.

It is the seventeenth named storm and the seventh typhoon of the annual typhoon season. Meteorological history A tropical disturbance formed northeast of Pohnpei on September 19. Two days later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the low-pressure area to a tropical depression early on September 21, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert shortly after that; however, the low-level circulation center (LLCC) of that disorganized system was exposed with fragmented convection. The JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Megi early on September 23, when the JTWC also indicated that the monsoonal circulation had consolidated, resulting in upgrading it to a tropical depression but lacking of a definitive center. Six hours later, the JTWC upgraded Megi to a tropical storm. When formative banding and cloud tops were improving and cooling late on the same day, the JMA further upgraded the broad system to a severe tropical storm. Tracking along the southwestern periphery of the deep-layered subtropical ridge on September 24, Megi was trying to form an eye that prompted both of the JMA and then the JTWC upgrading it to a typhoon. It also received the name Helen from PAGASA as the system entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility on the same day. However, despite being under excellent environmental conditions, Megi stopped intensifying further since September 25. Located in an area of low vertical wind shear and above warm sea surface temperatures near 30¬∫C, diurnal weakening of convection still continued to occur, especially over the northern half of the system. With excellent radial outflow tapping into westerlies and a large tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) cell to the east, a defined eye remained absent from the typhoon. After completing an eyewall replacement cycle on September 26, Megi eventually started to strengthen more in the afternoon, resulting in a ragged but larger eye embedded in this large typhoon. The JMA indicated that Megi had reached its peak intensity at 18:00 UTC, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 155 km/h (100 mph) and the central pressure at 940 hPa (27.76 inHg). Megi's large eye was temporarily more defined early on September 27; however it soon became cloud-filled as the typhoon had approached the eastern coast of Taiwan. Shortly before Megi made landfall over Hualien City at 14:00 NST (06:00 UTC), it had already intensified into a stronger typhoon at around 03:00 UTC, with one-minute maximum sustained winds at 220 km/h (140 mph) indicated by the JTWC, equivalent to Category 4 of the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Subsequently, interaction with the high mountains of Taiwan caused Megi to weaken significantly and the typhoon emerged into the Taiwan Strait from Mailiao at 21:10 NST (13:10 UTC). At 04:40 CST on September 28 (20:40 UTC on September 27), Megi made landfall over Hui'an County, Fujian as a minimal typhoon. Impact =Taiwan= Damage from the storm in Taipei Megi left 3.89 million households without power as it made landfall in Taiwan, the second worst blackout in history after Typhoon Soudelor's record-breaking 4.85 million households in August 2015. The storm forced more than 14,000 people to evacuate from mountainous areas near the coast to government shelters. At least four were killed across Taiwan, while more 625 others were injured, including 8 Japanese tourists whose bus overturned. More than 400 flights were cancelled, while train services were also halted during the passage of Megi. By October 1 the death toll in Taiwan had risen to 8 - five due to indirect causes, such as falls and traffic accidents, and three people who died when a landslide destroyed their house in southern Kaohsiung County. Early estimates suggested Taiwan's agricultural sector suffered losses of NT$1.03 billion (US$31.9 million), with around 19,000 hectares of crops damaged in total. By September 29 the total amount of damages in the agricultural sector had risen to NT$1.31 billion (US$42 million), with Yunlin County in western Taiwan accounting for more than a quarter of all of them. Government officials also announced that 814 school campuses across Taiwan were damaged, at an estimated cost of NT$161 million (US$4.17 million). In all, 8 people were killed in Taiwan, and total economic losses were counted to be NT$3.36 billion (US$106.9 million). =Mainland China= The typhoon left at least one person dead as it made landfall in Fujian, while 27 others were missing after a massive landslide engulfed part of a village in the eastern Zhejiang Province, swallowing up dozens of houses. By September 30 the death toll had risen to at least 4, as rescuers in Sucun village, Suichang County, pulled three bodies from the rubble of collapsed houses. A total of 20 houses were buried, while 17 others were flooded in Sucun, as an estimated 400,000 cubic meters slid down the mountainside. At least 15 people were rescued there, while 26 others remained missing, in addition to 6 people in nearby Baofang. The death toll in mainland China had risen to at least 16 by October 5, as authorities were still trying to locate 17 missing persons in Sucun. Xinhua News Agency reported that more than 120,000 people were evacuated by Fujian authorities, while the province's 31,700 fishing boats were recalled to port. China Southern Airlines cancelled several dozen flights due to the approaching storm. More than 1,200 houses were destroyed and over 10,000 were damaged during the passage of Megi, which affected an estimated 209 million people. In all, 44 people were killed in mainland China, and total damages were amounted to CNY9.7 billion (US$1.45 billion).

Birgitte Cathrine Boye wrote 124 of the 133 new Danish hymns in the volume. The two Norwegian hymns were written by Johan Vibe.Liest√∏l, Knut, & Edvard Stang. 1938. Norges litteraturhistorie. Oslo: Gyldendal Norsk Forlag, p. 129.Bull, Francis. 1958. Norsk litteratur historie: Norges litteratur, fra reformasjonen til 1814. Oslo: Aschehoug. Boye also translated some hymns, so overall 146 hymns, or one-third of those in the volume, can be credited to her. Editions and authorization The book is arranged following the liturgical year, with hymns designated for each Sunday and hymns for other church events. The book also contains some morning and evening hymns, and at the end 38 hymns with the Passion of Jesus as their theme. Guldberg's hymnal introduced some Pietist hymns from Pontoppidan's hymnal into use in Norwegian churches. When Niels Schi√∏rring's book of melodies was added to Guldberg's hymnal, some new hymn melodies came into use. The hymnal was issued for the first time in 1778 and was printed in new editions in the following years. It was authorized for use and adopted in Copenhagen in 1781 and in other towns in 1783; however, the powerful prime minister Guldberg was then forced to resign, and the introduction of the hymnal in rural areas was postponed. The book later came into more widespread use in Norway than in Denmark and, when Norway received its own assembly in 1814, the book was one of the three authorized hymnals in Norway, alongside Kingo's hymnal and the Lutheran-Christian Hymnal.

On January 11, 2016, she succeeded the term-limited Democrat Ben Nevers, who instead joined the new administration of Governor John Bel Edwards. Background Mizell was married for forty-one years until his death of cancer to James Robert \\"Bob\\" Mizell (1948‚Äì2012). He is interred at the Plainview Baptist Church Cemetery in her native Bogalusa in Washington Parish, along with his father, Arvelee Mizell (1922‚Äì1991). Bob Mizell's surviving mother is Kathleen N. Mizell (born 1925). Mizell has two children, Julie Mizell Stewart, a teacher, and Joshua Mizell, a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps Both reside with their spouses in Laurel in Jones County in southeastern Mississippi. She is a Southern Baptist. A former preschool operator, Mizell is the director of The Children's Cottage in Mandeville in St. Tammany Parish. Political life Mizell won the state Senate position in the general election held on November 21, 2015, when she defeated the Democrat Mickey Murphy, 19,404 votes (58 percent) to 14,033 (42 percent), a former teacher and college dean. In 2011, Mizell had made a strong but losing showing for the Senate against Ben Nevers. She finished with 14,764 votes (49.4 percent) to his 15,116 (50.6 percent). I In the 2015 campaign, Murphy supported the establishment of a reservoir in Senate District 12, but Mizell voiced her opposition to the project on the grounds that it would require eminent domain of private land in violation of the wishes of many of the impacted property owners. Mizell was earlier an organizer of the Franklinton Tea Party movement and has been the president of Republican Women of Franklinton. Mizell sits on the House committees on (1) Education, (2) Retirement, (3) Commerce, Consumer Protection, and International Affairs. She is also the vice chair of the select committees of: (1) Vocational and Technical Education and (2) Women and Children. The National Rifle Association rated Mizell 86 percent in 2015, based on her campaign promises. In March 2016, Mizell joined eight other Republican state senators and Democrat John Milkovich of Caddo Parish to oppose the bipartisan majority backing a one-cent increase in the state sales tax for a five-year period. Senators voted 29-10 for the tax hike, a part of the revenue-raising measures pushed by Governor John Bel Edwards. A House and Senate conference committee subsequently trimmed the five years to twenty- seven months, effective from April 1, 2016 to June 30, 2018. Under this tax hike, the sale of religious publications and cookies became taxable. Mizell submitted legislation to create a state historical protection commission. Her action is a response to the pending dismantling of Confederate monuments in New Orleans. However, her measure was doomed before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, where five African-American Democratic senators, led by committee chairman Karen Carter Peterson, hold the majority vote. In April, 2018, Mizell was one of 10 senators who voted against criminalizing sexual abuse of animals. Despite Mizell's opposition, the bill passed with 25 votes in favor of the ban. After the bill was amended in the House, Mizell and the other dissenting Senators voted for final passage of the amended bill.

The atmospheric effects that may be inspired by the paintings of J. M. W. Turner which Church had seen in London (although Church had already used a double rainbow in his 1866 painting Rainy Season in the Tropics). The work may also take inspiration from Turner's 1826 view of the Roman Forum. Church designed a gilded frame for the painting, decorated with an eclectic mixture of Middle Eastern motifs, including stars and rosettes, and egg-and-dart and other moldings.Frederic Church, John K.

Early life Born in Paris, Desmerci√®res was the illegitimate son of Jean Henri Huguetan by a woman in the fashion industry. He was named for the fashion street Rue des Merciers. He was apprenticed to his father's trading house in Paris and later led its office in London. He then moved to Berlin where he became a chamberlain for Frederick William I of Prussia. Career in Denmark In 1736, Desmerci√®res moved to Copenhagen where his father had arranged for him to become a member of the Kammerkollegiet. He was responsible for issues related to fishing from 1753 but was apart from that mainly engaged in banking and trade. He remained a member of Kammerkollegiet until 1768 and from January through March 1767 served as its president. He was involved in the establishment of Kurantbanken, was a major stakeholder in the Danish Asiatic Company and the first director of the Danish Africa Company which was founded in 1755. He belonged to the circle around Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff but was apparently not held in very high regard by him. It is believed that Desmerci√®res was critical to Bernstorff's policy of subsidizing industrial enterprises. Holdings in Holstein Memorial in honor of Jean Henri Desmercieres for his reclamation of Sophien-Magdalenen-Koog, Desmerciereskoog, and Elisabeth-Sopien-Koog Desmerci√®res was a major landowner in Holstein. He owned Quarnbek as well as Emkendorf from 1743 to 1764. He was a pioneer in land reclamation in the Holstein area where he reclaimed the bay at Bredstedt. The new area was named Desmerciereskoog after him (koog meaning 'polder'). Another reclaimed area was named Elisabeth-Sophien-Koog after his wife. The work was continued by Heinrich XLIII, Count Reuss of Ebersdorf, a nephew of Desmerci√®res' half sister Marguerite Huguetan, Countess Gyldensteen. A memorial to Desmerci√®res was unveiled in the area in 2004. Personal life Being an illegitimate son, Desmerci√®res neither inherited his father's titles nor the Countship of Gyldensteen at the event of his death in 1749. He did, however, receive his town mansion in Bredgade (now Hotel Phoenix Copenhagen) as well as the country house Tusenborg at Kongens Lyngby. Desmerci√®res was an active member of the French Reformed congregation in Copenhagen and supported it in several ways. Church of St. George and Mauritius with Desmerci√®res\` tomb to the right He married Elisabeth Sophie Frijs at Frijsenborg on 25 June 1751. She was the daughter of General-Lieutenant Count Christian Friis (1691-1763) and Countess √òllegaard Gersdorff (1687-1734). She became the holder of the countship of Frijsenborg upon the death of her sister Christine Sophie Friis in 1787. He was appointed Konferensr√•d in 1727 and Gehejmer√•d in 1745. He was created Knight of the Order of the Elephant in 1768 and Gehejmekonferensr√•d in 1775. On 22 February 1886, he was naturalized and ennobled by letters patent. Having no sons, the Desmerci√®res noble family died with him just two years later. He is buried at Church of St. George and Mauritius in Flemhude part of Quarnbek.

Lying in the shadows of Dhauladhar range, and developed about three centuries ago, the village of Pragpur along with the nearby village of Garli, is notified as a \\"Heritage Village\\" by a State Government notification dated 9 December 1997. As per the constitution of India and Panchyati Raaj Act, Pragpur village is administrated by the sarpanch, who is the elected representative of the village. History Pragpur was founded in the late 16th century by the Patials in memory of Princess Prag Dei of the Jaswan Royal family. The area of Pragpur was part of the principality of Jaswan whose chief, in the late 16th or early 17th century, charged a band of learned men, led by a Kuthiala Sood, to find a suitable place to commemorate Princess 'Prag' of his royal lineage. Pragpur is an ornamental village with unchanged shops, cobblestone streets, old water tanks, mud-plastered walls and slate-roofed houses. The narrow streets, lined with fort-like houses, havelis and villas, are indicative of the area's aged charisma. Due to its unique architecture and pristine beauty, the state government of Himachal Pradesh declared Pragpur as the country's first Heritage Village in December 1997. Prag means \\"pollen\\" in Sanskrit and pur means \\"full of\\", so Prag-pur means \\"full of pollen\\", which rightly describes the area when it is ablaze with blossoms in spring. Along with Pragpur, the nearby village of Garli is a part of the Heritage Zone. The Judges Court is a resort built in a typical Anglo-Indian style of architecture. It stands in 12 acres of greens, and is just a short walk from the village core and the Taal. Apart from the Judges Court, which was built in 1918, Mr Lal has restored his 300-year-old ancestral house. Places of interest The places of interest within the Heritage Village Pragpur are the Lala Rerumal Haveli built in 1931 by a Rais of Pragpur, which has a Mughal style garden, pleasure terrace and a large water reservoir. Butail Mandir, Chaujjar Mansion, courtyards of the Sood Clans, an ancient Shakti Mandir and atiyalas or public platforms are the pride of this heritage village. There are many silversmiths in the market selling traditional trinkets and curios. The village is known for its cottage industry. The inhabitants in the area are mostly craftspeople, weavers, basket makers, silversmiths, painters, musicians and tailors. One can purchase hand-woven blankets, shawls and hand-block printed clothes. * Dehra: a small town near Pragpur * Sidh Chanu Temple: a famous pilgrimage place in Pragpur * Chhinmastika Dham: also known as Chintapurani Mata Mandir; a famous religious place; 27 km from Pragpur * Jwalaji Mata: this temple is a famous religious place, 23 km from Pragpur * Nearby markets: Garli, Dhalihara, Neharan Pukhar Climate * Spring: about mid-February to mid-April; the winter starts losing its bite around mid- February * Summer: mid-April to end of June; it is hot in summer and light cottons are recommended * Rainy season: July to September; still quite warm and humid; much rain * Autumn: October to November; days are pleasantly warm; nights are cool; one may need light woollens at night or early mornings * Winter: December-January; it is quite pleasant during the day and one may get by with one layer of woollens; the winter nights are cold and an extra layer of woolens is required.

She is known for her paintings of interiors, figures, still-life and landscape. Early life, education and travels Siner was born Margaret Siner in Providence, Rhode Island to a Jewish family that originally emigrated from Russia to the United States in the early 1900s. Her family moved to Maplewood, New Jersey where she completed her high school education while taking painting classes at The Art Students League of New York (1968‚Äì69). She attended Boston University (1969‚Äì1973, BFA, 1973) and The American University (1974‚Äì1976, MFA, 1976) majoring in painting. While on scholarship to Boston University‚Äôs summer fine art program at the Tanglewood Institute, Lenox, MA (1971), Siner met Robert D‚ÄôArista who was a major influence on her work. She later studied with him at American University. In 1971 she was on a full scholarship at the Tanglewood Institute, which had Fine Art Program for a few years. In 1974 Siner attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture to study fresco painting. Siner lived in France from 1976 to 1980, settling in a 17th-century windmill near Fuveau, at the foot of Mont Sainte Victoire, the mountain made iconic by Cezanne‚Äôs paintings. She taught at the Institut des Universit√©s am√©ricaines, in Aix-en-Provence and had her first solo show in Aix-en-Provence at Galerie ‚ÄòLes Amis des Arts‚Äô. Her involvement in a women's self-help group led to auditing medical courses at the Facult√© de Medicine in the University of Marseille. She continued medical studies after moving back to the USA in 1981 and studied human anatomy at Georgetown University Medical School in 1986. Over subsequent decades she often returned to France for extended periods of time, for teaching and exhibitions. Siner first went to China in 1991 and was invited to teach painting in the art department of Xiamen University in Xiamen, PRC in 1992 and again in 1999 and 2004.Enlightenment of Teaching & Works by Maggie Siner, Beijing Fine Arts Journal, Sept. 1993 Siner first painted in Venice in 2008, and now lives there for most of the year.http://annemarchand.blogspot.com/2015/07/maggie-siner.html Painting Siner was classically trained and works with traditional archival oil painting materials in a freshly contemporary handling. She is among a small number of contemporary painters working exclusively from life, exploring beauty and meaning in the fleeting visual world. This, along with her fine craftsmanship and modestly sized work, makes her something of an anomaly in the current art dialogue. Her perceptual painting focuses on ‚Äúhow we actually see, how we respond to color and shape in a physical and emotional way, how our eyes move and travel, stop on an edge or leap to a point of contrast, how we react to verticals and horizontals how one color alters another color, how shapes create weight, movement and lead our eyes along a path.‚Äù In a recent interview for the NashvilleArts magazine, Siner says \\"I work from direct visual perception, ‚Ä¶ painting the colors and shapes created by light falling on various things, but not painting the things themselves.\\" Her subject matter follows many different threads, ranging from the intimate to the monumental to the whimsical and strange. The landscape is crucial for its immediacy but she frequently paints figures, portraits and still life, with her current works dedicated to laden tables and unmade beds, chosen precisely for their narrative ambiguities and the possibilities offered by the color white. She searches tirelessly ‚Äì on the road or in the studio ‚Äì for the subject, the light, or the position that delivers the right emotional experience, and then produces it with dazzling skill, through vigorous and brilliant brushwork, composition and architecture supported by strong solid drawing. Her gestural brushwork owes much to her years spent in China, absorbing the language of Chinese ink painting, as well as the Abstract Expressionist influence of her mentor Robert D‚ÄôArista. \\"Among her many gifts is her ability as a painter to transform the ordinary ‚Äì an unmade bed, a dress or coat on a hanger, a visitor to a museum ‚Äì into the extraordinary. Siner‚Äôs painting is \\"‚Ä¶ a distillation that seems to have been born through the process of reduction. This characteristic economy of technique is evident in every painting.\\"Greg Huddleston, The Piedmont Virginian Magazine, Spring 2012, p. 53 With her direct, gestural brushwork and expressive ability to get to the heart of what she sees, Siner's work is a continual reminder that there is beauty and interest hiding behind in even the most simple structures and commonplace moments.http://www.nccsc.net/studio-visits-allison/studio-maggie-siner A list of solo and group exhibitions of Maggie Siner is available on her website. Sculpture Trained in anatomy and figurative sculpture at Boston University Siner has continued working in clay throughout her career. While teaching in Lacoste, France, she began stone carving in the nearby limestone quarries and produced several life sized stone sculptures. All of her sculpture is figurative and has been exhibited in the USA, France and Italy. Teaching Siner is a devoted and inspirational teacher who has influenced a generation of painters, and is noted for her energetic and structured teaching style. She has taught for over three decades in art academies, universities and private art schools such as; the Institut d‚ÄôUniversit√©s Am√©ricaines and the Lacoste School of the Arts in France, Xiamen University in China,https://maggiesiner.com/bio.php Savannah College of Art and Design, American University, and the Washington Studio School in The United States.

It is a -story brick house. The property was later used as a children's home with its own school. The children's home began in 1912 as the Parental Home and School. It later merged with the Louisville Industrial School of Reform (formerly the Louisville House of Refuge) and was known as the Louisville and Jefferson County Children's Home. When it moved to the old Ormsby family farm, the home became Ormsby Village, serving dependent and delinquent children. The site originally had a separate home and school, Ridgewood, for African-American children. Segregation was ended in the early 1960s, and the homes were merged into Ormsby Village. The home was changed to the Ormsby Village Treatment Center in 1968, serving only delinquent children. It closed in 1979. The buildings were used by Jefferson County government for offices during the 1980s until the property was developed as an office park. Although the institutional buildings were razed, the Ormsby family home, Bellevoir, was preserved. The office park development plan called for preservation of 14 acres surrounding the Bellevoir mansion, with the historic building serving as a center for meetings and receptions.

She wrote a regular column for Daily Life for seven years. Life and career Ford spent much of her childhood growing up in the Middle East, specifically in Oman on the eastern border of the United Arab Emirates. At the age of twelve, her family relocated to England. After this time, Ford spent the remainder of her teenage years growing up in Adelaide, South Australia. As a teenager, Ford struggled with body image, body dysmorphia and an eating disorder. She studied at the University of Adelaide, where she took a gender studies course; she describes this as a personal catalyst for her decision to become a women's rights activist. During her time at the university she also worked as an editor and contributor for the student newspaper On Dit. In 2007 Ford began writing a column for Adelaide's Sunday Mail, and she also began writing for the Drum. Many of her columns were about personal topics and some readers found these controversial. A 2009 article's byline stated that Ford's two abortions had been a \\"really, really easy decision without guilt or shame\\". In 2014, she wrote of her outrage towards comments made by Cory Bernardi that labelled pro-choice advocates \\"pro-death\\" soldiers of the \\"death industry\\". Later that year, she wrote an opinion piece against a Victorian bill that would change the state's abortion laws, arguing that if politicians really cared about the lives of women and girls, they would advocate for improved access to birth control, including terminations. On White Ribbon Day in 2015, Ford made public some of the sexist and abusive messages that she had received online. Meriton Group, the employer of a man who had labeled Ford with a derogatory term, investigated Ford's complaint and the man was dismissed from his job. Three Adelaide High School boys were suspended from their school for the lewd comments they wrote about Ford. In September 2016, Allen & Unwin published Ford's first book, Fight Like a Girl. Two years later, her second book, Boys Will Be Boys was published, which focused on toxic masculinity and the patriarchy. =Controversy= In March 2016, Ford was banned from Facebook for 30 days for using profanity toward another user who had verbally abused her on her Facebook page. Ford accused Facebook of having a double standard, as the social networking site meanwhile declined to take action against a user who had posted a graphic internet meme making light of domestic violence. In 2018 a Lifeline event featuring Ford was cancelled following a petition calling for her removal, after she had made Twitter comments such as \\"All men must die\\". Ford resigned from her role as a columnist with The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age in January 2019, alleging that she had been \\"disciplined over a tweet\\" she made in regard to the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, and that she had been told that it was the paper's policy to refrain from \\"disrespect[ing] the office of the PM\\".\\"Clementine Ford quits Nine newspaper column, saying she was almost fired over tweet about Prime Minister\\", (31 January 2019), ABC.

Gray, Agua Dulce / Acton Country Journal, Volume XXVII, 14 installments published between 25 March 2017 and 24 June 2017 Disambiguation There are a number of legends from former Spanish colonies around the world that refer to a Lost Padre Mine or by names similar to this. The mine referred to in this short treatise is located in Kern County in southern California in the United States of America. Other names The Lost Padre Mine is the most common name found in documentation however the mine is also known by other names including the Los Padres Mine, Lost Los Padres Mine, Lost Padres Mine, and the San Emigdio silver mine. The legend Stories of lost or hidden mines have been intriguing successive generations for one and a half centuries since being popularized in 19th century newspapers such as stories featured in The Ventura Signal starting the same year the newspaper was founded in 1871.The Ventura Signal newspaper, 16 September 1871 There are multiple stories describing lost mines in southern Kern County and northern Los Angeles County. Different stories may refer to different mines as there is more than one mine that falls under the umbrella of the Lost Padre Mine. Historical context Priests from the Franciscan Order of the Catholic Church are thought to have established a number of secret mines along the San Andreas fault zone during the period of Spanish and later Mexican rule of California. By the time California was admitted as the thirty-first State of the Union in 1850, these early mines had effectively disappeared casting doubt that they had ever existed. Some believe priests from the Jesuit Order of the Catholic Church were exploiting mineral wealth in pre-colonial California before 1768. However, there is little to support this claim in the historical record so this remote possibility is largely discounted or debunked by scholars. Very few stories about southern California's Lost Padre Mines can be substantiated and therefore appear to be apocryphal accounts arising from folklore. However, some references have a solid basis in fact. Early prospecting Spanish knowledge of the interior of California was sketchy during the first decades of coastal settlement. Much of this knowledge was learned from expeditions in search of military deserters and runaway mission neophytes.Historical Overview Los Padres National Forest, E. R. Blakley and Karen Barnette, July 1985, pp.7-8 On 24 August 1790, Commandante Felipe de Goycochea dispatched nine soldiers headed by Sergeant Jose Ignacio Olivera to search for a neophyte named Domingo who had run away from Mission San Buenaventura. The military dispatch was also ordered to search for mineral outcroppings (silver) reported to be in San Emigdio Canyon. While prospecting the troupe was attacked by Indians and two soldiers were killed. In 1792, a Spanish naturalist, Jos√© Longinos Mart√≠nez, visited the canyon. He believed the ore there contained silver but felt mining would be too dangerous.Journal of Jos√© Longinos Mart√≠nez: Notes and Observations of the Naturalist of the Botanical Expedition in Old and New California and the South Coast, 1791-1792. Edited by Lesley Byrd Simpson, J. Howell Books, San Francisco, 1961, p.50 Physical evidence A pioneering, fur trapper and trader from Tennessee named Ewing Young (1799 ‚Äî 1841) found physical evidence of early mining activity in southern California in the form of abandoned smelter ovens. His party made this discovery in October 1832 which was during the latter part of the Californian mission era (1769 ‚Äî 1836). The location of the smelter works was near the Chumash village of Taxlipu/Tashlipun located in the mouth of San Emigdio Canyon (now part of the Wind Wolves Preserve west of Grapevine, CA).Los Angeles Star newspaper, 24 September 1871Mines, Murders and Grizzlies (Tales of California's Ventura Back Country) by Charles F. Outland. Originally published by the Ventura County Historical Society of California and the Arthur H. Clark Company in 1969 and revised in 1986 Hidden in the mountains above the smelting ovens were \\"Spanish\\" mines that were in operation during the mission era. Records indicate these smelters were managed by Mission San BuenaventuraNational Museum of Natural History, National Anthropological Archives, microfilm reel 95 (frames 504-513) copied from the papers of John Peabody Harrington in the Smithsonian Institution, 1907-1957, Volume 3.

Brickfield (1986) which was founded in 1782 and secularized in 1836. These smelters were built sometime after 1806 and before 1824. Another \\"forge or furnace\\" used for processing antimony ore (stibnite) was documented by the renowned geologist and mineralogist William Phipps Blake. He made a thorough investigation of the site on 21 September 1853 at a place his Indian guide called \\"Campo de los Americanos\\". This discovery provided further evidence of early mining activity in the area although not mission related.Reports of Explorations and Surveys to ascertain the most practicable and economical route for a railroad from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, made under the direction of the Secretary of War, in 1853-54. United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers. Washington, Government Printing Office (12 volumes) 1855-1861. Report by William Phipps Blake, Volume 5, Chapter 5, pp. 41-46 Rediscovery An elderly Native American named Jos√© el Venadero knew the location of the mines that supplied the old smelters. There are newspaper reports from 1860 describing how he led an interested party to the mines.Marysville Daily Appeal, Volume I, Number 130, 21 June 1860Daily Alta California, Volume 12, Number 185, 4 July 1860 p.1 A mission Indian from the San Buenaventura Mission named Carlos Juan Capena also knew of the smelters and the location of the mines supplying them with ore. He described one as being an antimony mine and the other a silver mine. Like most Native Americans, Capena believed in the padres' curse that would cost him his life if he revealed the secret location of the mines. Late in his life, Capena was persuaded to lead an expedition to the silver mine on behalf of the Hon. Angel G. Escandon (a Senator of Ventura County elected in 1874). Capena, now over eighty years of age, felt he was near the end of his life and had little to lose by revealing the location of the Franciscan mine. In August 1871, Capena led a party to the mine site where everything was found to be exactly as he had described it.The Ventura Signal newspaper, 16 September 1871 In December 1871, an interview was recorded with Carlos Juan Capena describing the mine. It took the form of a transcript of an oral interview given in the spoken Indian language of Mizkanaltan that was subsequently translated into Spanish. The interviewer, Juan Esteban Pico (1841 ‚Äî 1901) was expert in translating indigenous languages into Spanish. In April/May 1884, Pico himself led an expedition to this silver mine on behalf of an Italian, Prospero Calli from Bakersfield. Pico wrote a detailed report describing the expedition and the mine. This was a highly-secret, mining operation and the details available mostly come from Native Americans who had worked at the mine or had visited the site. The year the mine was established and when it was subsequently concealed and abandoned remains unknown. However, there is clear evidence that the mine was operating in early 1824 during the widespread Chumash revolt of that year. All the evidence points to this being the quintessential \\"Lost Padre Mine\\" that arose from stories circulating in the mid-to-late 1800s. Cyclic rediscovery In cyclic fashion, this historic mine keeps being rediscovered and then lost again through time. Documented visits to the mine site occurred in 1824, 1837, 1860, 1871, 1884, and possibly in 1915 when a map surfaced in Bakersfield.Sausalito News (Volume 31, Number 6) 6 February 1915Lompoc Journal (Number 38) 6 February 1915 p.6The Bakersfield Californian, 9 March 1915 p.24 The most recent rediscovery was made by Peter C. Gray and a companion on 23 September 2017 after a twelve year search. A request has been made for The United States Forest Service to conduct an archaeological study of the site which is currently under consideration.

A reach extender, grabber arm, or helping hand is a handheld mechanical tool used to increase the range of a person's reach when grabbing objects. It has applications in waste management, assistive technology, gardening and outdoor work, and in some cases as a children's toy. It is chiefly used to pick items up off the ground, and it is commonly sold in hardware stores. A reach extender takes the form of a long metal or plastic pole, usually not exceeding in length, with a handle at one end and a pair of jaws at the other end. The handle is equipped with a trigger that, when pulled, closes the jaws via a lever-and-spring system within the pole. The jaws are open by default and become open when the trigger is released. Some reach extenders may possess a secondary trigger which locks the jaws in position around whatever object they are holding, so the user does not need to maintain a tight grip on the handle. Others have jaws equipped with suction cups for holding round objects more easily, and still others have small magnets for collecting lightweight metallic items. Variations on the basic form of a reach extender depend on what task needs to be accomplished, and significant variation is found in the length of the pole and the maximum weight the reach extender can bear. Reach extenders are used by litter collection services to aid in picking up litter off the ground without having to bend over. People may construct specially adapted forms for this purpose.

It is a popular Polish song in the piosenka apaszowska or apache songs genre which arose in the Polish underworld of the 1930s. The song was written around 1934 for one of Warsaw's literary cabaret theatres. The theatres were frequented by the Polish intelligentsia. Background The song belongs to a genre called piosenki apaszowskie which has its origin in the street songs of the French Apaches underworld. The Polish word apasz describes a member of the Warsaw underworld. The lyrics are in stylized Warsaw slang similar to Parisian argot. The French singer, Aristide Bruant was a proponent of the Los Apaches genre. The song describes a violent party at a caf√© on Gnojna Street in Warsaw (now 7 Rynkowa (Market street)). The street was in the heart of the vibrant Warsaw Jewish district. The caf√© was run by Gruby Josek until 1932. It was popular among traders and porters from the nearby Hala Mirowska (food market). Writers and politicians would also visit late at night after Warsaw's exclusive restaurants were closed. The text was written for one of Warsaw theatres or cabaret revues. Both the composer Fanny Gordon and the lyricists Julian Krzewi≈Ñski and Leopold Brodzi≈Ñski were creators of the first Polish operetta, Yacht of Love (English title, New York Baby), which played at the \\"8.30 pm Theatre\\". In January 1933, the Morskie Oko theatre presented Dodatek Nadzwyczajny (Special Edition) which was set in the alleys and taverns of Warsaw. One scene took place at the U Joska na Gnojnej cafe. The song remains a popular Polish underground ballad, often sung in the specific dialect of the Praga district.  Lyrics  Sleepless nights in Warsaw's quarter I still trace them on my lips At the Fatty Josek's tavern on the Dung Street Gathered flower of the night. Without food and without sleep, as long as there is a drink When the music plays its song You have to dance and have to live! Its notes, accordion, at three-quarter plays, The gang is dancing, move away! With reverence 'cause it won't be all that good, When the Dung Street dances hard Who knows Tony feels respect There was one who did not know And he ended for this reason Finished in the darkly, darkly grave. Lanterns in the dark are lit Watchman sadly whistles song Hangman close to gallows waits For Tony's fate is coming soon Its notes accordion on three-quarter sobs The gang is dancing I am not Why are they dancing on the Dung Street When more than one pair is gone?  Recordings The first recording of the song was performed by Tadeusz Faliszewski. It was published in about 1934 by the leading Polish record company of that time, Syrena Rekord.

It is about 70 km North-West of Phong Nha - Ke Bang National Park.  T√∫ L√†n discovery  There are many caves in this limestone mountain area with stalagmites and stalactites, as well as underground rivers and waterfalls. Tu Lan Cave System comprises over 10 caves, some of which were originally discovered and explored in 1992, and some of which were just found in the past couple years. Hang Ton (Ton cave), was first found in 1992 and explored more in depth in 2012, appears first on the horizon on a trek to this intricate cave system.  Caves  There are more than 10 caves in Tu Lan Cave System: Ton Cave, Ken Cave, Kim Cave, Tu Lan Cave, Chuot Cave, Tien Cave, Uoi Cave, Ruc Cave, Secret Cave, Doi Cave, To Mo Cave.  Geology  As the tectonic plates in this region are always moving and bumping into each other, the mountains are still rising and moving up. The rivers continue to cut into the bottom of the mountain, carving new caves over time. Hence, the river caves that are at a lower elevation are much younger than the higher, dry caves as they were more recently created. The river caves in this system such as Ken Cave and Tu Lan Cave are very young, only about 3 million years old. The higher, dry caves (dry Tu Lan and Ton Cave) are much older, and date around 5 million years old. The French scientist Pierre G commented: \\"Tu Lan Cave System have the largest, deepest, longest, highest with many of connecting caves including inactive dry caves & active wet caves; including a number of natural phenomena such as the deepest Karst Doline of Southeast Asia (with a depth of more than 255m) and the habitat, stunning natural wonders, the majestic, unique of tropical jungle on the 400 million years of limestone.\\" Ken Cave's entrance The stalactites and stalagmites are enormous. One of the caves in the Tu Lan cave system, Ken Cave, even had its formations featured recently in National Geographic (The Top 10 Photographs of 2011) by world renowned photographer Carsten Peter.

The contract for the mission was signed in July 2014. The satellite is based on the SSTL-100 bus. The satellite weighs and carries an earth imaging payload with panchromatic imager and multispectral cameras. Construction The satellite had high participation from ASAL, with eighteen engineers that worked on assembly, integration, and test. Additionally, at the University of Surrey, 18 students used the satellite as a part of their graduate degree research. Launch The satellite was launched on 26 September 2016 into a altitude polar orbit by ISRO using the PSLV-C35 rocket. It was launched with several other satellites. The primary payload was SCATSAT 1, which was launched into a Polar Sun Synchronous Orbit. This was the first time PSLV launched satellites into different orbits. Algeria had three satellites that it will operate launch in that group, which were AlSat-1B, AlSat 2B, and AlSat-Nano. AlSat-2B also had imaging capabilities, but they are higher resolution than AlSat-1B. Of the eight satellites launched by PSLV, five of them were foreign. The remaining satellites were BlackSky Pathfinder 1, Pratham, PISat, and CanX 7. Alsat-1B uses three body mounted solar panels for power generation, and a 15 Amp-hour Li-Ion battery for power storage. It uses warm gas, butane powered resistojets for propulsion.

They spent one season (2015‚Äì2016) in the Western Conference of the Japanese bj league and then folded after being denied entry into the B.League, the bj league's replacement. History =Formation= Kenta Nakashima, a Hiroshima-born professional basketball player who had spent time with the Tokyo Apache and Vancouver Volcanoes, returned to his home town in 2012 with the intention of establishing a professional basketball team within Hiroshima Prefecture. Despite facing opposition from the Hiroshima Prefectural Basketball Association, who did not want a professional team within the prefecture, he established a company named Hiroshima Pro Basketball Co., Ltd. in April 2013. In July 2013 the bj league announced that it would commence a new minor league in August 2014, and that the club team operated by Hiroshima Pro Basketball would be granted entry into the league. =bj Challenge League 2015= In October 2014 Nakashima held a press conference in Hiroshima with bj league commissioner and other league officials to announce that the bj Challenge League would commence in January 2015. At the same press conference, Nakashima announced his team would be named the Hiroshima Sun Stars and introduced Joe Navarro (Nakashima's former head coach in Vancouver) as the team's head coach and five players who had been contracted to play. The press conference was held a week before the Hiroshima Dragonflies, another professional basketball team formed by a rival group, played their first match in the National Basketball League, the bj league's competitor. In December 2014 Nakashima announced that the team's name was to be changed to the Lightning due to receipt of a complaint from a manufacturing company. Along with the Lightning, the was the only other team ready to complete in the first round of the bj Challenge League. The round consisted of six games between the two teams played between January and April 2015. Hiroshima won all six matches by an average of 35 points, with the team's three home matches being played at the Naka-ku Sports Center, Asakita-ku Sports Center and Asaminami-ku Sports Center. On 6 April 2015, the day after the Lightning's fifth win against the Impulse, Nakashima held a press conference to announce that the Lightning had been granted entry into the bj league's 2015‚Äì2016 season, which was to commence in October 2015. The team's entry into the league was made possible due to the withdrawal of a Nagasaki-based team the previous month. A second round of the Challenge League was held between June and August 2015, with the joining as a third team in July. =Failed B.League bid= In early 2015 it was announced that the bj league and NBL would merge to form a new league to commence in the new 2016‚Äì17 season. In April 2015 both the Lightning and Dragonflies submitted applications to enter the new league (later named the B.League). However, only the NBL's Dragonflies received support from the Hiroshima Prefectural Basketball Association. Supporting documentation from the local association was a requirement for acceptance into the new league. The Lightning lodged an appeal with the Japan Sports Arbitration Agency in June, which was withdrawn soon after following the new league's administration agreeing to reconsider the Lightning's application. Ultimately, it was announced on 16 July that the Lightning was refused entry into the league, the only team out of the 46 active teams across the two leagues to be denied entry. The Dragonflies were assigned to the league's second division. =bj league 2015‚Äì16 season= Before their first season in the bj league, the Lightning signed Americans Andre Murray and Adam Herman and Bahaman Gjio Bain as their three import players. The team played their first match on 2 October 2015, which ended as a 127‚Äì75 loss at home to the Ryukyu Golden Kings. The team suffered a further four losses before recording their first win on 18 October by defeating the Takamatsu Five Arrows 95‚Äì79. This would be the team's only win in the 52-game season, as they lost their next 44 games in a row to finish with a 1‚Äì49 record, the worst in the league's 11-year history. On 15 April 2016 the club announced that two home matches against the Tokyo Cinq R√™ves that were postponed in December 2015 were to be forfeited due to \\"unavoidable circumstances attributable to the home team\\", effectively shortening each team's season to 50 games. The team had an average attendance of 322 at its 24 home games.

It is owned and operated by private spaceflight company Rocket Lab and supports launches of the company's Electron rocket for CubeSat nanosatellites. The facility officially opened on 26 September 2016 (UTC). With the launch of Electron on 25 May 2017, it became the first private spaceport to host an orbital launch attempt, and the first site in New Zealand to host an orbital launch attempt. With the Electron launch of 21 January 2018, it became the first private spaceport to host a successful orbital launch.  Location  The spaceport is located close to Ahuriri Point at the southern tip of New Zealand's Mahia Peninsula, in the Hawke's Bay Region of the North Island's east coast. The site is a raised plateau surrounded on three sides by cliffs, and at an altitude of . The only road access is a single road leading north from the site. This crosses the isthmus connecting the peninsula with the rest of the North Island before connecting with SH 2 at the settlement of Nuhaka. The nearest town, Wairoa, lies to the northwest of the launch site, around the curve of Hawke Bay.  Description  Launch Complex 1 features a launch platform and tower, a hangar for the Electron rockets, and storage tanks for liquid oxygen and kerosene. During the test phase of launch operations, which began in May 2017, the exclusion zone would likely be an radius from the pad, and would reduce in size once the site became commercially operational.  History  = Site options = Rocket Lab announced on 1 July 2015 that it had selected Kaitorete Spit in New Zealand's South Island near Canterbury as the site of the launch facility for its Electron rocket, and that it hoped to have construction finished by the end of the year. While the site would not permit equatorial launches due to the presence of Banks Peninsula to the east, it was favourable for Sun-synchronous orbital flights, which the company believed would be of primary interest to its customers. The site was also logistically favourable as the company wanted to build a rocket production facility in nearby Christchurch. The Mahia Peninsula site at Onenui Station was mentioned in August 2015 as a possible second launch facility. It had first been visited by company officials in April 2015 as part of their initial scouting for launch sites, and were preparing to submit a resource consent application. By mid-October, the application had been approved by the Wairoa District Council and Hawke's Bay Regional Council only seven days after its submission, with the Gisborne Chamber of Commerce and the Eastland Community Trust working with Rocket Lab to support its bid for the Mahia site. = Decision for Mahia = On 23 November 2015, Rocket Lab stated that the Mahia Peninsula site would be the priority launch facility because of delays in obtaining resource consents for developing at Kaitorete Spit. While certain authorisations had been obtained for Kaitorete, such as stormwater and air discharge permits from Environment Canterbury, a coastal permit for occupation of the area, and a Department of Conservation permit, the Christchurch City Council had not consented to the development due to an incomplete Cultural Impact Assessment, resulting in no action under Sections 95 and 104 of the Resource Management Act 1991. The company said that efforts would continue to gain consent for a launch pad on Kaitorete Spit due to its logistical superiority and the foreseen need for additional facilities, but that the Mahia site offered superior launch corridor and flight rate opportunities because of its geographical location and relatively sparse air traffic. The Mahia site is licensed for a maximum launch rate of once every 72 hours over a period of 30 years‚ÄîRocket Lab believes the actual rate would average once per week‚Äîwhile the Kaitorete site would only have been licensed to launch once per month. The company broke ground at Mahia in December 2015, and by June 2016 most of the infrastructure work had been completed, including upgrades to roads and internet services, and work was progressing on the electrical, mechanical and communications infrastructure. Rocket Lab signed an agreement with air traffic service provider Airways New Zealand in early September 2016 to develop \\"special use airspace\\" and ensure regular flight activity, which the company estimates could be up to 100 launches per year. The Mahia Peninsula site, named Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1, was officially opened on 26 September 2016 (UTC) in a ceremony presided over by Minister for Economic Development Steven Joyce. It was attended by approximately 240 people, including company employees, local landowners, and then Labour Party leader Andrew Little. = Launch history =  Pad A  On Pad A or LC-1A Rocket Lab carried out the first test flight of its Electron rocket, named \\"It's a Test\\", on 25 May 2017 at 04:20 UTC, coming after three delays caused by bad weather during a launch window that extended from 21 May to 1 June. While lift-off from Launch Complex 1 was successful, the rocket failed to reach its intended Sun-synchronous orbit, only making it to about . The second launch from the launch pad was made 21 January 2018 at 01:43 UTC, successfully making it to orbit. The Electron rocket, named \\"Still Testing\\", carried a Dove Pioneer satellite for Planet Labs, two Lemur-2 satellites for Spire Global and the Humanity Star.  Pad B  On 19 December 2019, Rocket Lab announced that they had begun construction on a second pad at LC-1, known as LC-1B to meet increased launch rates. The construction is expected to be complete by the end of 2020.  See also  * Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2, a launch complex currently being built by Rocket Lab.

Tyddyngwyn was an intermediate station on the narrow gauge Festiniog and Blaenau Railway (F&BR;); it opened with the line on 30 May 1868. The F&BR; ran the three and a half route miles northwards from its southern terminus at Llan Ffestiniog to a junction with the Ffestiniog Railway (FR) at Dolgarregddu Junction near what is nowadays Blaenau Ffestiniog station. The station was a passenger station, whose main but not sole traffic was quarrymen travelling to and from work In common with all other F&BR; stations there were no platforms, carriages were very low to the ground, so passengers boarded from and alighted to the trackside. The station had a single-storey building on the eastern side of the track. No details of the station's facilities have been published, though the standard work conjectures there may have been a siding. In common with Festiniog and Tan-y-Manod stations, the only published photographs were taken from a distance, they lend the buildings the appearance of corrugated iron. The sole close-up photo is of the line's northern terminus - . This shows the building to bear a striking resemblance to weatherboarding. If the line's other stations were made of the same material that would explain their corrugated mien. Services The February 1878 narrow gauge timetable shows that all trains called at all stations on the line, with * Northbound (\\"Up\\")  four public trains running Monday to Saturday  an unadvertised morning workmen's train running Monday to Saturday  two public evening trains on Saturdays only * The journey time from Tyddyngwyn to Diphwys(F&BR;) was 10 minutes. * Southbound (\\"Down\\")  four public trains running Monday to Saturday  a morning workmen's train running Monday to Saturday  two public evening trains on Saturdays only  a teatime workmen's train on Saturdays only * The journey time from Diphwys (F&BR;) to Tyddyngwyn was 6 minutes. * There was no Sunday service. Diphwys was the F&BR;'s Blaenau station and would become the site of the town's later GWR station, but it was not the Festiniog Railway's station. Through passengers from Tyddyngwyn to would alight at the F&BR;'s Diphwys station and walk across Church Street in Blaenau to the Festiniog Railway's completely separate Duffws station. Most trains were timetabled to make this process workable, if tight. Whether connecting trains were held in the case of late running is not recorded. In the line's early days trains many trains ran \\"mixed\\", but this was stopped in 1877. Unlike most railways in the area passengers were the line's mainstay. In 1879 - a typical year - passenger receipts were ¬£1406 compared with ¬£416 for goods. No figures have been published specifically for Tyddyngwyn. The standard gauge approaches On 1 September 1882 the standard gauge Bala and Festiniog Railway reached Llan Ffestiniog from the south, enabling a passenger from (say) Bala to Tyddyngwyn to transfer from a standard gauge train to a narrow gauge train at Llan by walking a few yards, much as modern-day passengers transfer between Conwy Valley Line and Ffestiniog Railway trains at Blaenau Ffestiniog. From May 1882 the narrow gauge line was converted to standard gauge. Narrow gauge trains continued to operate during the conversion, using a third rail. Narrow gauge trains ceased running on 5 September 1883 with standard gauge services beginning on 10 September 1883. Tyddyngwyn was closed permanently when the narrow gauge ended, being replaced by a few yards to the south when standard gauge services began. Tyddyngwyn's station building appears to have resembled that at , but no details of its facilities have been published. It was demolished after closure, leaving no trace. The line reopened The line through the site of Tyddyngwyn station closed in 1961 but it was mothballed pending building the long-discussed cross-town link to enable trains to run along the Conwy Valley Line, through Blaenau and on to Trawsfynydd nuclear power station which was then being built. The line through the site reopened on 24 April 1964, but none of Tyddyngwyn's or Manod's facilities were brought back to life. The line closed again in 1998 as the nuclear plant was being decommissioned. Once more the route was mothballed in case a future use is found. The station site in the 21st century By 2011 the whole site had been completely demolished. In Spring 2016 the mothballed single track line still ran past the site to the former nuclear flask loading point. Tyddyngwyn Terrace, Manod lies northeast of the station site. The bridge visible beyond the station in the photograph reproduced by Boyd was still in place in 2015 at the western end of Arwain l; it would have afforded a grandstand view of the station. The future Between 2000 and 2011 there were at least two attempts to put the mothballed line through the site to use. In 2011 there were proposals to use the rails as a recreational velorail track. Neither this nor the earlier idea came to anything. The possibility remains that the surviving line could see future preservation or reuse by the nuclear industry. To considerable local surprise fresh moves to reopen the line from Blaenau as far south as Trawsfynydd began in September 2016, with the formation of The Trawsfynydd & Blaenau Ffestiniog Community Railway Company. On 21 September at least one regional newspaper reported that \\"Volunteers are set to start work this weekend on clearing vegetation from the trackbed between Blaenau Ffestiniog and Trawsfynydd.\\" The company was quoted as saying \\"We have been given a licence by Network Rail to clear and survey the line.\\" References =Sources=   * Further material    * * External links  The station site on a navigable OS Map National Library of Scotland * The site on a navigable 1953 OS map npe Maps * The station and line Rail Map Online * The line LJT2 with mileages Railway Codes * Reminiscences by a local railwayman Forgotten Relics * Festiniog and Blaenau Railway Festipedia * Driver's view through the station to Blaenau YouTube * Several photos of the line Penmorfa * Several photos of the line Penmorfa * The line in 2009 The Railway Muddler * A special along the line 2D53 * Details of Summer 1989 excursions through the station Six Bells Junction * Details and photos of 22 Jan 1961 railtour Six Bells Junction * Photos of 22 Jan 1961 railtour Robert Darlaston * The 22 Jan 1961 last train special YouTube * An inspection saloon ride on the line, Part 1 YouTube * An inspection saloon ride on the line, Part 2 YouTube * Signal box diagram Signalling Record Society Category:Disused railway stations in Gwynedd Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1868 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1883 Category:Blaenau Ffestiniog ","title":"Tyddyngwyn railway station"},{"id":"51766094","text":"Wood (also known as Woods) is an unincorporated community in DeKalb County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.

The early work in Granick's career focused on confined liquids. Granick was a pioneer in the field of nanorheology and molecular tribology. Other early work concerned molecular mobility at polymer surfaces. This progressed to later studies showing how biological membranes interact with their environments. More recently, Granick and his research team work across disciplines to explore imaging, assembly, behavior and interactions of molecules, colloidal particles, and their assemblies. He made the first measurements of polymer surface diffusion in the key limit of dilute concentration and he identified the important class of physical problems where diffusion is anomalous yet Brownian. His laboratory became interested in many instances of molecular mobility measured at the single-molecule level, including active matter and transport in living cells. The other principal current area of Granick's research concerns Janus colloidal particles, their self-assembly at rest and driven outside equilibrium. The scientific importance is to understand natural selection in the colloid world.

Assam Tourism Development Corporation or ATDC () is a state owned corporation of Assam, India. It deals with tourism services and development as a part of the Assam Tourism Department along with the Directorate of Tourism. The State Govt. of Assam set up the corporation on 9 June 1988.As per notified in Tourism Policy 1987 The ATDC is headquartered at Guwahati () and has district offices across Assam. Its official slogan is \\"Awesome Assam.\\" History of tourism in Assam Once, this northeastern state of India was known as Pragjyotishpura, then Kamrupa. During Ahom rule the land was called Axom, which foreigners pronounced \\"Assam\\". Assam was ruled by many kingdoms from ancient times. In 1826, British took over Assam and made it a separate state. From ancient times, tourists have come to this land. The Chinese traveler Xuanzang visited Kamrupa during Bhaskarvarman in the 7th century. In 1958, the Department of Tourism was established. In 1962, an information office opened in Kaziranga, and in 1965, an information office opened in Sivasagar. In 1987 (during the seventh Five Year Plan), the first ever tourism policy of Assam was notified and subsequently ATDC was formed with a paid up capital of 24 lakh. In the same year the state government declared tourism as an industry. In the mid-70s, Assam tourism started properties near Kaziranga and other places such as Aranya, Banani, Banashree, MV and Jolporee. After the creation of ATDC, some of them were handed over to ATDC to operate. From the beginning, ATDC created many tourist lodges, yatriniwas, parks, and wayside amenities with the brand name of \\"Prashaanti\\". In 2009, a \\"tourist arrival cum reception center\\" was opened in Guwahati, which is presently known as \\"Asom Paryatan Bhawan\\". In 2012, ATDC started a luxury cruise, MV Mahabaahu, in a joint venture. In 1995 the Restricted Area Permit (RAP) from Assam was withdrawn which had been imposed in 1962 after Chinese attack. Properties Assam tourism has more than 50 properties including lodges, wayside amenities, restaurants, parks, rope ways, amusement parks, and cruises in locations across Assam. Out of these, the Directorate of Tourism runs eight lodges. ATDC operates directly seven lodges, and other properties are on lease to private parties.

On 14 February 1920 Lieutenant Colonel H. E. Pilkington, was appointed Staff Officer for the Ordnance Services effectively replacing McCristell as the Director of Equipment and Ordnance Stores, with the new title Director of Ordnance Stores. As the NZEF demobilised, the NZAOD absorbed many officers who had served with the NZEF NZAOC providing much operation experience which became invaluable as both the NZAOD and NZAOC consolidated their position and started to centralise themselves as an organisation in Trentham, Burnham and Auckland. Amalgamation On 3 July 1923, the New Zealand Army Ordnance Department was amalgamated with the New Zealand Army Ordnance Corps, resulting in one Ordnance organisation for the New Zealand Army.

Prior to the DMU/EMU sidings being opened, the site functioned as a Carriage & Wagon works for the area.

Mahmoud Abu Zeid, also known as Shawkan (born ca. 1987), an Egyptian photojournalist, was arrested for taking photos at the Rabaa massacre 14 August 2013 in Cairo, Egypt and imprisoned during the post-coup unrest by the Egyptian government since 2013, where he faced the death penalty. By September 2018 he had been sentenced to a 5-year prison term and was expected to be released shortly thereafter; he was released on 4 March 2019. Personal life In 2016 Zeid has Hepatitis C, which he was diagnosed for while in prison. He has also been diagnosed with malnourishment, anemia, and depression, as well as lacking proper medical care. Career Zeid is an award-winning freelance photojournalist. He started working for Demotix in April 2010. In the wake of the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat, Zeid took photographs of protests against General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. His work has been published in Time, The Sun, Die Zeit, Bild and on the BBC website. His work has also been reproduced by Amnesty International, Global Voices, IFEX, Index on Censorship and Open Democracy. Arrest Zeid was arrested along with two other journalists while he was taking pictures of the 14 August 2013 Rabaa massacre. The two other non-Egyptian journalists were released but Shawkan remained in prison for more than two years without charges. His case, along with 700 other defendants, is known as the \\"Rabaa sit-in dispersal\\". Shawkan's camera has not been used as evidence he is a photojournalist, which makes his status as a prisoner ambiguous. By November 2015, he had been in \\"pre-trial detention for over two years\\". On 26 March 2016, he was charged with six offences, and, as a result, faced the death penalty. On 8 September, an Egyptian court handed him a 5-year jail sentence which could see him leave prison \\"within a few days,\\" said his lawyer Karim Abdelrady. Abdelrady added that the sentence was nevertheless \\"unfair because he (Shawkan) was only doing his job\\". Shawkan was released early on 4 March 2019, 6 years after he was arrested. =Context= Egypt was in 2015 among the top ten countries of world in the imprisonment of journalists with 12. Shawkan is being held in Egypt's Tora Prison. As of end of 2015, China had the largest number of imprisoned journalists for the past two years with the number of 49 journalists. =Reactions= There is an international campaign for Shawkan's release using the hashtag #FreeShawkan and several press freedom organizations including the Rory Peck Trust and the Committee to Protect Journalists have called for his release, while Amnesty International has started an online petition for it. In February 2015, the Committee to Protect Journalists met with officials in Egypt to call for his release. Shawkan is a featured case in the Press Uncuffed campaign, led by Dana Priest and her students at the Phillip Merrill College of Journalism in collaboration with the Committee to Protect Journalists to help free imprisoned journalists throughout the world by selling bracelets bearing their names and raising awareness about their cases. In 2016 the Committee to Protect Journalists organized an exhibit of Shawkan's work at the Bronx Documentary Center. In 2018, UNESCO awarded Press Freedom Prize for his contributions and marked its detention as Human Rights abuse. According to Jason Stern, a senior Middle East and North Africa research associate for the CPJ, Shawkan should have never been arrested for performing his job duties. In a letter published by news outlets such as National Public Radio and Deutsche Welle, as well as human rights groups, Shawkan wrote about how journalism in Egypt has become a crime. There are 13 journalists who are facing a life sentence or death. Shawkan's brother, Mohammed, spoke on his brother's imprisonment, \\"For a year, my brother is being held without charges in prison, he was detained during the dispersal of Rabaa and his detention has been renewed since then. My brother never held a gun, he was simply doing his job, but unfortunately he was a freelancer, so he had no institution to back him or offer any support.\\" Exhibits * \\"The Price of Photography: Shawkan, 1,000+ Days Behind Bars,\\" at the Bronx Documentary Center.

March of Intellect by William Heath. March of Intellect N¬∞2 by William Heath. Robert Seymour. The March of Intellect, or the 'March of mind', was the subject of heated debate in early nineteenth-century England, one side welcoming the progress of society towards greater, and more widespread, knowledge and understanding, the other deprecating the modern mania for progress and for new-fangled ideas. The 'March' debate was seen by Mary Dorothy George as a public reflection of the changes in British society associated with industrialisation, democracy and shifting social statuses ‚Äì changes welcomed by some and not by others.M. Dorothy George, Hogarth to Cruikshank (London 1967) p. 177 Origins and context The roots of the controversy over the March of intellect can be traced back to the spread of education to two new groups in England after 1800 - children and the working- class.G. M. Trevelyan, British History in the Nineteenth Century (London 1922) p. 163-5 1814 saw the first use of the term the 'march of Mind' as a poem written by Mary Russell Mitford for the Lancastrian Society,M. Dorothy George, Hogarth to Cruikshank (London 1967) p. 181n and the latter's work in bringing education to children was soon rivalled by the efforts of the Established Church.G. M. Trevelyan, British History in the Nineteenth Century (London 1922) p. 163-4 The March of Intellect forms part of nineteenth-century debates over science communication, marking a peak in the development of the idea and possession of knowledge. The concept of knowledge as a result of the industrial revolution had changed from the end of the eighteenth century. ‚ÄòPolite learning‚Äô practiced by the upper and middle classes through the study of ancient cultures was criticised for being ornamental in its uses by commentators such as Jeremy Bentham. The industrial revolution created a new focus on applied knowledge, particularly regarding natural philosophy (later science) and its various fields. ‚ÄòUseful knowledge‚Äô was believed to be the way forward by liberal Whigs, but the definition of this term remained fluid. The increase in periodicals, encyclopaedias and printed literature from the late eighteenth century began to raise questions about the newfound availability of knowledge. Advances in the production of books further extended knowledge to the middle classes and owning printed literature became a desirable commodity. Where a volume would cost around 10 shillings at the beginning of the nineteenth century, by the 1820s a reprint of a volume could be half this value. At the same time, the spread of print culture, artisan coffee houses, and, from 1823 onwards, Mechanics' Institutes,G. M. Trevelyan, British History in the Nineteenth Century (London 1922) p. 164 as well as the growth of Literary and Philosophical Societies,B. Hilton, A Mad, Bad, & Dangerous People? (Oxford 2008) p. 171-2 meant something of a revolution in adult reading habits. The working classes had limited access to knowledge owing to poor literacy rates and the expensive cost of printed materials relative to wages. The Spa Fields Riots and Peterloo Massacre raised concerns about revolution and the violent unrest created resistance among the elite towards educating the lower classes. Other conservative commentators supported educating the working class as a means of control. The Edinburgh Review commented in 1813 on the hopes of 'a universal system of education' that would 'encourage foresight and self-respect among the lower orders.' Through education, the working class would know their economic position in life and this would prevent further outbreaks of political unrest. Liberal Whig supporters of educating the working classes, such as Henry Brougham, believed in 'the greatest happiness of the greatest number' outlined by Bentham's utilitarian philosophy. The sciences were seen by these supporters as valuable knowledge for the working classes and debates on the best means of diffusing knowledge was debated. Peak Interest in the so-called March of Intellect came to a peak in the 1820s. On the one hand, the Philosophic Whigs, spearheaded by Brougham, offered a new vision of a society progressing into the future: Thackeray would write of \\"the three cant terms of the Radical spouters...'the March of Intellect', 'the intelligence of the working classes', and 'the schoolmaster abroad'\\".Quoted in M. Dorothy George, Hogarth to Cruikshank (London 1967) p. 177 Brougham's foundation of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, and of University College, London, seemed to epitomise the new progress of the age. But the same phenomenon of the March of Intellect was equally hailed by conservatives as epitomising everything they rejected about the new age:Alice Jenkins, Space and the March of Mind (2007) p. 16 liberalism, machinery, education, social unrest - all became the focus of a critique under the guise of the 'March'.M. Dorothy George, Hogarth to Cruikshank (London 1967) p. 177 The March of Intellect was repeatedly satirised in written print and visual media, such as cartoons. Cartoons were frequently used in the nineteenth century to explore current affairs and were becoming increasingly accessible during the peak of the March of Intellect. William Heath‚Äôs collection of prints published between 1825 and 1829 have become central representations of the debate. Heath used machines, steam- powered vehicles and other forms of technology in his work to mock liberal Whiggish ambitions that problems in society could be solved through widespread education. The scenes present futuristic visions of society whereby issues such as travel, emigration and postal delivery had been conquered by technological innovation through knowledge. They represent some of the advances in everyday life such as faster travel due to the extension of the railway and the rise in exchanging letters. These and other satirical works from the period recognised that a transformation within society was already in motion, but were ambiguous as to whether reform would be progressive or damaging. For example, Robert Seymour's cartoon entitled 'The March of Intellect' (c.1828) in which a giant automaton sweeps away quacks, delayed parliamentary bills and court cases, can be seen as apocalyptic in its attempt to improve society. The March of Intellect remained ambivalent throughout satire, but recurrently criticised the ambition of educating the working class. In Peacock's 1831 novel Crotchet Castle, one character, Dr. Folliott, satirised the \\"Steam Intellect Society\\" and linked the march explicitly to folly, rural protest and the rise in crime: \\"the march of mind...marched in through my back-parlour shutters, and out again with my silver spoons\\".Thomas Love Peacock, Nightmare Abbey and Crotchet Castle (London 1947) p. 212-3, and p. 105-6, p. 219 Peacock had earlier parodied the Utilitarian take on the role of the modern poet:M. H Abrams, The Mirror and the Lamp (Oxford 1953) p. 126 \\"The march of his intellect is like that of a crab, backward\\"Quoted in Ben Wilson, Decency and Disorder (London 2007) p. 317 Victorian accommodation The March of Mind was used by the Whigs as one argument for the Great Reform Act; and after a decade of reform and railway, the idea of progress became something of a Victorian truism.B. Hilton, A Mad, Bad, & Dangerous People? (Oxford 2008) p. 611 Continuing concerns related more to ameliorating its effects than turning back the clock - philosophers fearing over-education would reduce moral and physical fibre,E.

Description  The cap of Amanita flavorubens is 35 ‚Äì 105 mm wide, yellow to brassy yellow to lemon yellow, sometimes dark orange brown, sometimes with pigment entirely washed out by rain becoming pallid, sometimes very deep wine red in its entirety due to bruising during development (Coker 1917), subovoid to hemispheric to plano-convex to convex, depressed in the center, slightly tacky to dull to subviscid to subvelvety, with an incurved or downcurved, rimose, and nonstriate margin (may become slightly striate with age). It is adorned with conspicuous, woolly to felty, yellow warts; bald underneath the warts; the margin not lined, or only faintly lined at maturity. The volva is present as yellow to orange to bright orange- yellow flocculent to confluent warts, friable, sparsely and irregularly distributed, easily removable, pulverulent, splotchy brown around the center, yellow at the edge. The flesh is 3 ‚Äì 7 mm thick over the stem, thinning evenly to the margin, white or yellowish, bright yellow just under the cap skin. The gills are free to very narrowly adnate, subcrowded to crowded, creamy ivory to cream to off-white, 3 ‚Äì 8 mm broad, with a white pulverulent edge and also a small decurrent tooth. The short gills are truncate to subtruncate to subattenuate to attenuate to attenuate in steps, unevenly distributed, of diverse lengths, and plentiful. The stem is 52-150 (5.2‚Äì15 cm) √ó 7‚Äì14 mm (0.7-1.4 cm), usually narrowing upward, infrequently narrowing downward, flaring at the top, yellow to white or very pale yellowish white and pruinose to finely powdery above the ring, white to yellow or occasionally with scattered yellowish surface fibrils and fibrillose below the ring, sometimes silky longitudinally striate. The bulb is 15 - 25 √ó 15 ‚Äì 21 mm, more or less turnip-shaped, with light red-pinkish stains; interior of the bulb is often the place where wine-red staining first appears intensely. The ring is membranous, superior, skirt-like, flaring then collapsing, pale yellowish white to cream to white, slightly more yellow underneath, with a thickened edge. The volva is absent or present as rings of yellow-brown warts on the bulb or brilliant yellow loose patches appressed to the stem and are large, friable, detersile, sometimes lost during collecting. The flesh is white or slightly pink, hollow or partially hollowed in the middle to stuffed. The spores measure 7.8-11.0 (0.78-1.1 mm) √ó 5.4-7.0 (0.54-0.70 mm) ¬µm and are ellipsoid to elongate (infrequently broadly ellipsoid) and amyloid. Clamps are not present at bases of basidia. Rain will quickly wash pigment away from the yellow-orange pileus. Bruising is sometimes reported only from the stem base for this species, but it commonly bruises throughout the fruiting body. Occasionally, especially in areas with dense root mats, specimens will be found in which the entire pileus is wine-colored from bruising during expansion through the root mat. A researcher has found one specimen with the cap intensely bruised before expansion. The cap had a dark red brown color in the center and elsewhere ranged from brown to pale yellow brown at the cap margin. The cap warts were in concentric rings and somewhat concolorous with the surrounding cap skin, but always with a distinct yellow tint. The odor is of clean laundry. = Habitat = A. flavorubens was originally described from the state of Ohio, USA and is also known from forests associated with beech (Fagus grandifolia), oak (Quercus), pine (Pinus), birch (Betula), and also the Canadian hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) from the southeastern part of Canada to the state of Alabama in eastern North America, central Mexico, and southeastern Arizona. Amanita flavorubens is one of the few taxa in North America that are known to have a western population disjunct from an eastern primary area of distribution.

It has rough, tessellated bark on the trunk and branches, a crown of sessile juvenile leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, pale creamy yellow flowers and urn-shaped fruit. Description Corymbia ferruginea is a straggly tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. Young plants and coppice regrowth have more or less sessile, rusty green, hairy, broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped or elliptical leaves that are long and wide. The leaves in the crown of the tree are juvenile leaves that are the same shade of dull green on both sides, with brown hairs along the veins, broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped or elliptical, long and wide and sessile or on a petiole up to long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets of a branched, densely hairy, rusty brown peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with three or seven buds. The buds are sessile or on pedicels up to long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from January to April and the flowers are pale creamy yellow. The fruit is a woody urn-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Rusty bloodwood was first formally described in 1843 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Walpers' book Repertorium Botanices Systematicae and given the name Eucalyptus ferruginea. In 1995, Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia ferruginea. In the same journal, Hill and Johnson described two subspecies and the names are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Corymbia ferruginea (Schauer) K.D.Hill & L.A.S.Johnson subsp. ferruginea; * Corymbia ferruginea subsp. stypophylla K.D.Hill & L.A.S.Johnson that differs from the autonym in having small leaves with petioles more than long. Distribution and habitat Corymbia ferruginea grows in open forest and woodland on shallow, sandstone soils or deep sands from west of Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia then east through the northern part of the Northern Territory to south of Burketown in north-west Queensland.

Home to a number of personalities from the film industry as well as cricket, it is one of the most affluent suburbs of Mumbai. The old villages of Bandra are hidden behind the tall buildings and shopping malls of the area. The old villages pakhadis of Bandra, originally twenty-four of them, were one of the earliest of settlements in Bandra. List of villages (hamlets) and their occupation =Portuguese period= The following were the hamlets pakhadis during Portuguese period, which ended approximately around year 1739, mentioned along with each is the occupation of these villages, and their designated area of influence: * Chuem (Chuim)- cultivators, * Candely - cultivators - this settlement was near Chuim but got extinct after 1732. * Xelalim (Sherly)- cultivators - Port. Sellaly, * Rajana (Rajan)- cultivators - Port. Rajana, * Mallan (Malla)- cultivators - Port. Mallem, * Dandem Khar Danda, * Parvar - cultivators - this settlement was located between (Dr.Ambedkar Road and Khar Gymkhana - current road names) but got extinct after 1853, * Pall (Pali)- cultivators - Port. Pallem, * Kantavari (Old Kantwadi) - cultivators - Port. Horta de Santo Andre - N.B. New Kantwadi was a similar hamlet of cultivators that came into existence in 1817, * Ranuar (Ranwar) - cultivators - Port. Ranoar, * Tank - cultivators - Port. Tanque, * Dancavar (Boran) - cultivators - Port. Dandacarvar, * Patarvar - cultivators - location of this hamlet (north of St. Joseph Convent - current name of a school) - extinct after 1817, * Varoda (Waroda), * Khar - Bois and \\"cavoqueiros\\" - Port. Salgado, * Santa Cruz - toddy-tappers and cultivators, * Catirvara - Bois - near Khar, * Povoacao - Extending to the D'Monte Street, the Portuguese and their household staff lived in this area. The following are some localities that existed near Povoacao * Rua Baixa (Lower Street), * Bazar- location (Bandra Bazar - current name)- this area had mixed population, * Rua do Bazar - (Bazar Street) - miscellaneous population, * Horta do Bazar (Bazar Oart) - Faras - scavengers - located near (Chinchpokli Road - current road name), * Rua dos Tintoreiros (Dyers Street)- miscellaneous population - this hamlet was located most probably near the Bazar. Parish of Santa Anna had all the above-mentioned hamlets, Povoacao, and the other localities under it. The rough area under Santa Anna parish was ( Swami Vivekanand Road (current name)- extending to railway lines till the Old Slaughterhouse). The potters, weavers, mainatos (washermen), toddu-tappers, and other non Koli groups or casts which did not belong to any hamlets were also under Santa Anna parish. =Pertained by St. Andrew's parish= There were certain Hamlets that were under St. Andrew's parish. Most of them were Kolis fishermen settlements and they were called koliwadas. A few of them were as follows: * Colario de Igrezia (Chimbai), * Colaria Naopara - Located near Old Ghodbunder Road (Current name of the Road), * Colaria de Meio - located near Bazar area, * Colaria Mora - located near Bandra Bunder, * Colaria Grande - located near Chapel Road (Current name of the Road), * Colaria Zaitucali - north of Mount Carmel church (Current name of the Church), * Colai - located near Seaside Cemetery, * Supali - located near Supali Talao ground. These Koliwadas were under Santa Anna parish and there is mention of them in the baptismal register of Santa Anna since people in these hamlets were baptised over several years by the parish. History Only a few of them have survived the time, a few of them are on verge of extinction, and some of them are listed under heritage. Records suggest these villages date back 1534, were ruled by Bahadur Shah of Gujrat. Bandra area originally had 25 \\"pakhadis\\" villages. These villages were either fishing or farming villages. The original inhabitants of these \\"pakhadis\\" were mainly the East Indians and Hindu Kolis. The old Bandra was scenic, with stretches of green, bungalows, clusters of villages, villas surrounded by little gardens, and coastline. Home doors were kept open as a welcoming gesture and all the inhabitants were acquainted with everyone. From 1896 to 1906 Mumbai was struck by plague (Bombay plague epidemic) and the residents in Bandra villages suffered. Some were vacated.Library, T. B. (2002, 27 June). The British library. Retrieved 28 September 2016, from https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/indiaofficeselect/PhotoShowDescs.asp?CollID=527 =Agriculture and other trades= Bandra was a part of the island called Salsette which was referred to as a granary. In Bandra, there were extensive paddy fields, coconut 'oarts', and vegetable gardens. Mango groves existed on the hilly areas. Other areas had barb trees. The main crop grown in Bandra was Rice (Gazetteer, Vol XIII, Pt. 2, pg. 478) Portuguese forbade the export of rice when there was a conflict between them and British. Dr. John Fryer (British traveller and /writer), who visited the Selsette island in 1673-75, described Bandra to be an excellently fertile land naturally or either because of the care of inhabitants. He also documented that there were good yields of Cabbages, Radishes, Coleworts, Water-Melons and Onions. He also mentions that the Selsette island, with all this crop, was not only supplying these yields to the nearby islands but also to Goa. Ranwar Village Ranwar is approximately 400 year old East Indian Catholic village one of the original twenty four hamlets pakhadis. It is a heritage listed precinct in Mumbai. It was a rice producing village and was surrounded by paddy fields. The exact extent (boundaries) of this hamlet have blurred over the period of time due to new developments in the area. Ranwar roughly Stretches from Waroda Road (a narrow lane off Hill road) towards Bandra Reclamation. Current condition: The architecture of the Portuguese times has now taken a more urban form where all the welcoming porches are walled off, the big windows that once were open are caged by grills. The demographics in Ranwar has changed due to increase in population, which has shattered the fabric of community life. The village infrastructure is not able to cope up with the increasing residents. The narrow lanes get blocked by traffic, sewage lines laid in the 1920s are overburdened due to increase in sewage. The original residents of the houses are leaving and the demographic of this urban village is rapidly changing. These old houses are experiencing structural issues, with walls buckling extra materials and reinforcements are being added for support. The open areas of the houses that were sunlit once, are now overshadowed by high-rises around. Conservationists are doing their best to maintain the character of the Ranwar. Due to these numerous problems, maintaining the old houses is becoming a difficult task. Hence out of 42 bungalows in Ranwar 6 of the bungalows are demolished. Ranwar is one of the prime locations in Mumbai and the prices of the real estate are growing year after year hence a lot of developers are pursuing these old house owners to sell their property for making prime real estate. Chimbai Village The Chimbai Village is home to the fishing community called the Kolis. Unlike Ranwar, which is famous for its artsy image, Chimbai still remains as a simple fishing village without much of development. Chimbai is located near bandstand which is really popular among youngsters. The village is not currently well-maintained. The community that lives here call themselves Chimbaikars. Unlike Ranwar, the younger generations of the same families still reside in Chimbai. After the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, where it was said that the terrorists used waterways to get into the city, the rules for these fishermen have been made strict and possessing photo identity cards is made mandatory. Chimbaikars have continued the tradition of community bonding in the form of badminton at nights regularly. The main fishing activity that is done by Chimbaikars happens at night time and usually is a nighttime activity that does not cause significant disturbance to the nearby residents. The community has built up shacks for the children to play, as a community gathering space for the elderly. This encourages all the families to communicate and bond since the men fishing can be out for days, this acts as a support system for the females and the children in the families. Chuim Village The Chuim Village was a small cluster of 70 houses- recorded in the 1940s. Chuim stretches, a few houses, to the east and the west around with Dr. Br. Ambedkar Road approximately running through the centre. This village as compared to the other settlements was a bit small and over the years now only around 20 odd houses remain and others have been developed into small buildings. As the other hamlets Chuim also traded agricultural produce and flowers. Primary schooling in the old days was done within the settlement in the midst of mango trees. Chuim used to be alive from the fishing activity that used to happen along with Danda village, the on the spot sale and bargain used to add to this liveliness. Architecture: Chuim has two-storey cottage structures. It has a unique character as compared to other developments around with wooden framed structures, circular staircases, attics, and iron grilled windows. Almost every house has a Varandah where the elderly sit every day. Narrow lanes, as same, in the other villages are used as social gathering spaces. Current condition: As the other villages Chuim is also facing an array of infrastructure problems ranging from water supply pressure being very low to sewage overload which has resulted in the sale of property for fresh development or redevelopment. Since the village is centrally located, with railway station, schools, colleges, religious places, and leisure promenades the area is said to be a prime location for development. There are a few Buddhists that live in Chuim that have reported being stressed to repair their houses after every few years. Architecture and Planning Most of the pakhadis in Mumbai had a heavy Portuguese architectural influence in housing and general building style. Chuim, Ranwar, Shirley Rajan, Pali, etc. shared the same architectural style. The narrow zigzag alleyways were developed for shading in the common areas and they also served as protection from bandits that raided the lands sometimes. Village squares served as community gathering spaces. The original architectural style dates back approximately 140 years where the basic design of a house was a single storey structure with attic space to store grain, since the original residents were paddy owners. Most of the houses had either front or back open spaces for interactions or as kids playing area. The roofs were tiled with Mangalore tiles. The roofs featured Balcao style sit outs. The trellises were ornamented and the structural system was wooden. Open spaces at the back of the houses was sometimes used as rosaries or to make masalas. All the spaces were designed at a pedestrian scale. The hamlets developed as close knit community because of well-designed social interaction spaces.

New York: Doubleday and Company, 1984. He served as United States Ambassador to Jamaica from 1982‚Äì1985.  Early life  William Alexander Hewitt was born in San Francisco, California, on August 9, 1914, to a prosperous family that had arrived from England in 1883. William had two siblings: a brother, Edward T. Hewitt, Jr.; and a sister, Adrienne Delphine Hewitt. William's father, Edward T. Hewitt of San Francisco, operated the Hewitt-Ludlow Auto Company, which manufactured trucks, tractor-trailers, and fire engines until 1930. William's mother Jeannette Brun Hewitt was born to the Brun family of Napa Valley, California. His maternal grandmother and grandfather Brun were descendants of French winemakers who arrived in 1882.William Alexander Hewitt, editor, Brun Family, Napa Valley, from 1874 Hewitt Family, San Francisco, from 1882. (Rutherford, CA: 1989, 605 pages: illustrated (some color) ) Hewitt attended Lowell High, graduating in 1931 at the age of 16. After graduating, he worked for two years as a messenger for the American Trust Company to save money for college tuition. Hewitt's father died the same year William started at University of California, Berkeley. In 1937 Hewitt graduated from the UC Berkeley as a member of Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, with a Bachelor of Arts in economics and a minor in political science. After graduating he attend Harvard Business School for a year, but he lacked the funds to complete a graduate degree and returned to California. He took a job with the accounting department of Standard Oil of California in San Francisco (1938‚Äì1939), and then with Texaco in 1939. In 1940 he worked as a copywriter for Roos Brothers, a men's clothing chain in San Francisco.  Military service  Immediately after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hewitt joined the Navy, commissioned as an ensign. At first, he served primarily as a gunnery officer on the USS St. Louis in the Solomon Islands in the Pacific. Then, promoted to lieutenant commander, he served from 1942 to 1946 aboard the battleship USS California as a combat information center radar officer. He participated in the invasions of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, and the battle of Surigao Strait.Appalachian magazine, October/November, 1996  Family life  After the war, Hewitt took a job as territory manager for Ford-Ferguson Equipment Distributor. While representing Ford, he was invited by a former Alpha Delta Phi fraternity member to a wedding in Santa Barbara with other members of their fraternity. During his stay, he met Patricia Deere Wiman. Tish, as she was known, was the daughter of Pattie Harris Southall Wiman and Colonel Charles Deere Wiman, President of Deere & Company. She was the great-great- granddaughter of the founder Deere & Company. Hewitt and Patricia married in 1948. In 1955, the couple moved to Moline, Illinois, where Hewitt became chief executive officer of Deere & Company after working for them in San Francisco. They had three children. Twin girls, Adrienne Deere and Anna Deere Hewitt, were born on July 17, 1955, and christened at Christ Episcopal Church in Moline, IL. Alexander Southall Hewitt was born on July 15, 1957, christened at Christ Episcopal Church in Moline, February 1958. While the children attended St. Katherine's School, Patricia worked at her Rock Ridge home and at Friendship Farms, their 375-acre equestrian horse farm for breeding and training Arabian horses and growing grains and feed. Patricia was an award- winning equestrian, long distant horse rider, horse jump trainer, published photographer, and philanthropist> Her charity work focused on the Red Cross during and after World War II and later on environmental, social causes, and civil rights. \\"Active in charitable organizations, she sought to fight AIDS, to help disabled children and to ease the plight of American Indians.\\" She held meetings for civil rights leaders in her home and organized volunteers and provided disaster relief for families and farmers across the country.  Modern-day father of Deere & Company, 1948‚Äì1982  Hewitt was the fifth chief executive officer and last representative of the Deere family to run the company. During his tenure at Deere & Company, Hewitt turned the small domestic company into the world's leading farm equipment manufacturer with sales of over $5 billion. In 1948 Hewitt took a job the San Francisco branch of Deere & Company and was elected to the board of directors in 1950.Broehl, Wayne G., Jr. John Deere's Company. New York: Doubleday and Company, 1984, page 606 He was named as executive vice president in 1954 and upon the death of Wilman in May 1955 succeeded him as chief executive officer and president. At the time Deere & Company was a domestic manufacturer with $339 million in yearly sales. Hewitt worked to build a robust brand and worked closely with the firm's public relations department to increase consumer awareness of their products. Deere & Company soon offered a new line of four tractors, rated with the smallest at under 36 Power Take-off horsepower, with the largest at 84 horsepower. All four models had power steering and the two largest had hydraulic power brakes. New transmissions were designed for all four, and all sizes had a choice of gasoline, diesel, or LP engines. The agricultural press and farmers were enthusiastic about the products. These models were introduced in Dallas, Texas on what came to be known as \\"Deere Day in Dallas\\".Forbes magazine, March 1, 1961 The following day in the jewelry department of Neiman Marcus, the Hewitts joined Stanley Marcus and industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss to unveil a 20-foot package to promote the new line of tractors. During Hewitt's early administration the company made an aggressive move into international markets, which ushered in a time of growth. While on vacation in France in the late 1940s he had been shocked to see some farmers still using a horse or oxen and a plow. Competitors were expanding abroad, but Deere & Company had a less than dozen manufacturing entities in the United States and one in Canada. He convinced the board and got approval for international expansion in 1955. The first international venture, in 1956, was the German tractor company Heinrich Lanz AG. He went to Mannheim, Germany, to negotiate the purchase. The workers went on strike as the result of a new rule that limited the amount of beer they were allowed to consume during their breaks.https://www.deere.com/en_US/docs/Corporate/fans_visitors/publications/plowshare_issue28.pdf Acquisitions or plant constructions followed in France, Spain, Argentina, Mexico, and South Africa. Hewitt struggled with unforeseen problems with foreign exchange, Communism, and apartheid-related problems.David Magee, The John Deere Way: Performance That Endures, Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2005. , page 61 In South Africa, while many companies were divesting from Africa and pulling out, he believed that a foreign presence could apply pressure to implement change and that he could work to eliminate inequities. He started cautiously in the 1960s, but by the 1970s he had pushed hard to make the Deere plant in Nigel, Gauteng a model for moving black workers into management. Apartheid leaders pressured black workers not to show up to work. Hewitt helped the black township of Duduza, where the workers lived, to upgrade the schools by working with the government and providing grants to build a new school. When Nelson Mandela became president, the Deere South African plant became significantly profitable. Hewitt continued to expand in Canada, Western Europe, and Latin America. Hewitt described Russia as a reluctant customer. In the 1920s and early 1930s, Deere sold huge quantities of agricultural machinery to Russia, but sales then dried up. When Khrushchev visited the U.S. in 1959, he made a surprise visit to Deere & Company, which prompted a small sale to the U.S.S.R. and encouraged Hewitt to make efforts to increase sales to that country. In 1972 a Deere delegation visited the Soviet Union. After many trips, Hewitt learned that the Soviets were more interested in cotton harvesting equipment than plowing and planting. With this knowledge, Hewitt developed a lighter and faster tractor for cotton harvesting. The Soviet government was ready to agree to the purchase, the Carter administration declared an embargo on shipments of American products to the Soviet Union and the deal fell through.  New headquarters  Hewitt hired architects Eero Saarinen and Kevin Roche to design a new Deere & Company headquarters in Moline, Illinois in 1964. The building utilized Cor-Ten, a corrosion-resistant unpainted steel, for the exterior structure. This was a departure in architectural design, allowing for natural weathering and for the building itself to emerge as part of the natural landscape. Offices featured natural lighting, a plant-filled atrium, and an indoor barn with outdoor views to incorporate the natural landscape and community. The building has won over 50 design awards, including: Twenty-Five Year Award, 1993‚ÄîAmerican Institute of Architects; First Honor Award, 1965‚ÄîAmerican Institute of Architects; Architectural Award of Excellence, 1965‚ÄîAmerican Institute of Steel Construction; Silver Medal of Honor, 1965‚ÄîThe Architectural League of New York; Collaborative Medal of Honor, 1965‚ÄîThe Architectural League of New York; \\"Office of the Year,\\" 1964‚ÄîSilver Plaque Award Administrative Management Magazine; and National \\"Plant America\\" Award, 1964‚ÄîAmerican Association of Nurseryman.  Corporate culture  Hewitt established the Deere corporate art collection, starting with commissioning a mural painted on the factory display showroom walls. Reflections of an Era by Alexander Girard is a three- dimensional mural depicting rural Americana from 1837 to 1918. The art collection, which includes 2,300 pieces by artists from all over the world, is on display throughout the company's global facilities. Much of the collection was acquired by Hewitt. For its exemplary support of the arts, John Deere was recognized as a 2005 Business Committee for the Arts (BCA) 10: Best Businesses Partnering with the Arts in America honoree and was inducted into the BCA 10 Hall of Fame. During Hewitt's tenure as chairman, he initiated and published the Deere Green Bulletins, to improve the then-decentralized offices and improve communications. Topics included corporate goals and the principles behind its basic policies and procedures.John Dietz, John Deere New Generation and Generation II Tractors: History, Models, Variations & Specifications 1960s‚Äì1970s (Tractor Legacy Series). Minneapolis, MN: Voyager Press, 2010 In 1973, Hewitt began testing and working to reduce engine emissions. He formed an energy management program that tracked energy use and required operations to implement energy-conservation initiatives.http://www.deere.ca/en_CA/docs/Corporate/citizenship/2007_gcreport_en.pdf Under Hewitt's leadership Deere received the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter Industrial Development Research Council Award for Distinguished Service in Environmental Planning. Deere shared the Roll Over Protection System (ROPS) patent with other equipment manufacturers to improve safety for all farmers. The Moline headquarters drew visits from notable heads of state and celebrities worldwide. Hewitt entertained Presidents Eisenhower and Carter, King Gustav of Sweden, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1959 Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union, paid an impromptu visit to Deere & Company, bringing out the press in droves.  Philanthropy  During the Great Depression, Deere & Company used its financial leverage to aid many of its customers and employees even as its own sales plummeted. In 1931, the company prevented failure of the People's Savings of Moline, re-establishing it as Moline National Bank in 1933.Wright, Robert E. and Richard Sylla, Genealogy of American Finance. New York: Columbia University Press, 2015, page 165Wright, Robert E. and Richard Sylla, Genealogy of American Finance. New York: Columbia University Press, 2015, page 165 In 1958 Hewitt donated the capital stock it held in Moline National Bank to the John Deere Foundation for charity.http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Deere__Company.aspx He worked closely with Elwood Curtis (chief financial officer at Deere & Company) to establish programs that would fund education and the arts, the Red Cross, and continue to benefit employees, the City of Moline, and to fund agricultural and farming communities in times of need. The John Deere Foundation, the philanthropic organization funded by the company, has provided hundreds of millions in grants worldwide since it was founded in 1948. After the death of William and Patricia Hewitt, their children Alexander, Anna, Adrienne, and board members continue the philanthropic work through the Rock River Trust Company.https://www.johndeereclassic.com/documents/JDC_Media_Guide_2016.pdf Media guide page 12: John Deere Foundation  Government appointments  Hewitt received presidential appointments to serve as a member of the Special Committee on United States Trade Relations with European Countries and the Soviet Union (1965), the National Advisory Commission on Food and Fiber (1965‚Äì1967), incorporator of the National Corporation for Housing Partnerships (1968), Presidential Task Force on International Development (1969), National Council on the Humanities (1975‚Äì1980), and President's Commission for a National Agenda for the Eighties (1980‚Äì1981). He was an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects (A.I.A.), recognized for his extraordinary vision and leadership in promoting excellence in architecture.  Diplomatic life: U.S. ambassador to Jamaica  On February 26, 1982, Hewitt accepted the position of Ambassador to Jamaica. On September 29, 1982, was confirmed by the Senate by unanimous consent. He hosted President Ronald Reagan for first ever overnight visit by a sitting US President.

A magnetic drilling machine is a portable drilling machine with a magnetic base (either electromagnetic or permanent magnet). It can use twist drill bits, annular cutters, milling cutters, and other rotary cutters. With suitable bits it can also tap threads, ream, and countersink. Its combination of a stable magnetic base and low RPM help resist or reduce torque forces created by large diameter bits. Magnetic drilling machines with reversible motor and variable speed controls can also performa operations like tapping, countersink and reaming. Magnetic drilling machine with cross table base and can also perform light milling.  Description  A portable magnetic drilling machine is faster and more portable alternative to hole making machines such as the drill press, and is more accurate than a hand drill. A portable magnetic drilling machine is used on steel or other magnetic materials. It gives an accuracy of 0.01 mm to 0.05mm in steel or other magnetic material. The drill bits used for this machines are generally made from high-speed steel(HSS) or are tungsten carbide tipped(TCT). = Base = The base of a magnetic drill is equipped with a powerful electromagnet to easily clamp the machine on the work piece to be drilled. When energized this magnet is held on the metal work piece locking the machine base to the surface. The electromagnet plays a very important role in a portable magnetic drill, as it helps the machine to be steady, does not let the machine dismount during drilling, can work with the machine overhead, horizontal or vertical. Generally, a magnetic core drilling machine is used on a ferrous material directly, but it can also be used on non-ferrous material like aluminum with the help of clamping devices. The new generation magnetic driling machines' bases are also equipped with Swivel Base, to position the machine under magnetic condition. = Stand = A drill stand is the main body of the magnetic drill where the electric switches for motor and magnet are mounted, magnet indicator is mounted and also the clock-anticlockwise direction switches are mounted. The body of the magnetic drill holds together the motor and the magnet base. The feed handle is also attached to the body. The body of the magnetic drill helps the motor slide on it to get an upward and downward feed. The body of the magnetic drill also plays the role of a handle to lift and move the machine from one place to other. The material used for the body is generally cast iron. = Arbor = An arbor or chuck on a magnetic drill is attached to the motor. it is a type of clamp used to attach the core drills. There are mainly two types of chuck available for the magnetic drill, industrial arbor (manual tightening) and quick change drill chucks. The quick change drill chucks are easy and fast option to attach the core drills. They do not need to tighten the screws/jaws manually. The arbor or chucks have different types of spindle holder (machine taper) like Morse taper MT 2, MT 3, and MT 4. The chuck allows different types of core drill shafts (shanks) to fit in it.  Types  Popular forms of magnetic drilling machine include: = Light weight = Very light weight types magnetic drills are very popular to perform several operations where the weight of a machine to carry is a great concern like working on an electric pole, mobile tower, TV tower, bridge, etc. = Automatic and semi-automatic feed = Magnetic core drilling machines with fully and semi-automatic drill feed are very popular these days. These machines help in saving time and energy and resulting in more production. = Pneumatic = Pneumatic core drilling machines are used where there is a danger of explosion or fire due to electrical sparking. The motor is driven by compressed air and the magnet is a permanent magnet instead of an electromagnet. = Cordless = Battery operated magnetic core drilling machines are used for a work place where there is no electricity. The motor is driven by a rechargeable battery. The magnet for these machines is either an electromagnet or a permanent magnet. = Horizontal = Horizontal magnetic core drilling machines with angular gears are made for confined drilling situations.

With a cutter wall thickness of approximately 5 mm only a small amount of material around the edge of a hole is removed by an annular cutter. Numerous teeth remain sharper longer than the single pointed tip of a spiral drill. Holes produced are smooth and burr-free - no reaming is required. Operation Drilling holes with a magnetic drilling machine is a three-step process: 1\\\\. The pilot pin accurately centers the cutter over the area to be drilled. 2\\\\. During drilling, the pilot pin retracts and allows the internal lubrication to reach the cutting teeth. 3\\\\. When the hole is complete, the slug/core is automatically ejected from the cutter, leaving an accurate, finished hole. High-quality precision-engineered cutters may have tapered inner walls. These hellp offset the effect of frictional heat build-up that causes expansion of both the cutter and waste slug being produced by the cutting action, allowing ready ejection of the slug upon completion.

He set a record for prize money earnings which stood for 20 years. (He earned $1,915,334.25 adjusted by inflation)  Appearance  Turf writer John Hervey described him as \\"a rich chestnut, 15.2¬Ω (hands) tall, he was remarkable for his symmetry of mould and the excellence of his limbs\\" As well as that this majestic look was also implied by his nickname, The Great Red Fox.  Racing career  In his career, Planet showed his durability and versatility by winning in multiple eastern states including Virginia, Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, and New York. He won 27 times in 31 starts defeating the best horses the late 1850s had to offer.  Stud career  Most of his time as a stud was adversely affected because of the American Civil War. Sires had to be hidden in the woods in order for them to be safe. In 1868 he was sold to Robert A. Alexander of Woodburn Farm in Woodford County, Kentucky. He spent the rest of his life there before his death at age 20. Planet was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2012.
