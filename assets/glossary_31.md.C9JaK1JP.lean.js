The 2014 Pacific hurricane season was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation. It officially began on May 15 in the eastern Pacific‚Äîdefined as the region east of 140¬∞W‚Äîand began on June 1 in the central Pacific, defined as the region west of 140¬∞W to the International Date Line; both ended on November 30\\\\. The season produced twenty-three tropical depressions. All but one further intensified into tropical storms and sixteen further intensified to become hurricanes, which broke the record holding the most number of hurricanes within the basin tied with the 1990 and 1992 seasons. The first named storm of the season, Amanda, developed on May 22 before intensifying into a hurricane on May 24\\\\. At 0300 UTC on May 25, it intensified into Category 3 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale, becoming the second-earliest major hurricane on record, behind 2012's Hurricane Bud. At 1500 UTC, Amanda reached its peak intensity with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), becoming the strongest May hurricane on record in the eastern Pacific. In mid-June, Hurricane Cristina intensified to become the earliest second major hurricane on the record in the East Pacific, beating the previous record set by Hurricane Darby in 2010. On August 24, Hurricane Marie became the first Category 5 Pacific hurricane since Hurricane Celia in 2010, and it was the sixth most intense Pacific hurricane on record in terms of minimum atmospheric pressure. This timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not operationally warned upon, has been included. The timeline also documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.

It should contain events within the ideologies and philosophies of feminism. It should not contain material about changes in women's legal rights. See also: Timeline of women's legal rights (other than voting), Timeline of women's suffrage and Women's suffrage. Timeline of feminism ;1848-1920 * First-wave feminism was a period of feminist activity and thought that occurred within the 19th and early 20th century throughout the world. It focused on legal issues, primarily on gaining women's suffrage (the right to vote). ; 1960s * 1963: The Feminine Mystique was published; it is a book written by Betty Friedan which is widely credited with starting the beginning of second-wave feminism in the United States. Second-wave feminism was a period of feminist activity and thought that began in the early 1960s in the United States, and spread throughout the Western world and beyond. In the United States the movement lasted through the early 1980s.Sarah Gamble, ed. The Routledge companion to feminism and postfeminism (2001) p. 25 * Black feminism became popular in response to the sexism of the civil rights movement and racism of the feminist movement. * Fat feminism originated in the late 1960s. Fat feminism, often associated with \\"body-positivity\\", is a social movement that incorporates feminist themes of equality, social justice, and cultural analysis based on the weight of a woman or a non-binary feminine person. * Radical feminism emerged in the United States. It is a perspective within feminism that calls for a radical reordering of society in which male supremacy is eliminated in all social and economic contexts. That said, radical feminists also recognize that women's experiences differ according to other divisions in society such as race and sexual orientation. * 1967: \\"The Discontent of Women\\", by Joke Kool-Smits, was publishedhttp://www.emancipatie.nl/_documenten/js/werk/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw.pdf; the publication of this essay is often regarded as the start of second-wave feminism in the Netherlands. In this essay, Smit describes the frustration of married women, saying they are fed up being solely mothers and housewives. * 1969: Chicana feminism, also called Xicanisma, is a sociopolitical movement in the United States that analyzes the historical, cultural, spiritual, educational, and economic intersections of Mexican-American women that identify as Chicana. The 1969 Chicano Youth Liberation Conference began the Chicano movement and eventually, MEChA. At the conference, women began to get involved in the male-dominated dialogue to address feminist concerns. After the conference, women returned to their communities as activists and thus began the Chicana feminist movement. ; 1970s * In the 1970s, French feminist theorists approached feminism with the concept of √©criture f√©minine (which translates as female, or feminine writing).Wright, Elizabeth (2000). Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters). Totem Books or Icon Books. . * The term materialist feminism emerged in the late 1970s; materialist feminism highlights capitalism and patriarchy as central in understanding women's oppression. Under materialist feminism, gender is seen as a social construct, and society forces gender roles, such as bearing children, onto women. Materialist feminism's ideal vision is a society in which women are treated socially and economically the same as men. The theory centers on social change rather than seeking transformation within the capitalist system. ; 1980s * The radical lesbian movement is a francophone lesbian movement roughly analogous to English-language lesbian separatism. Inspired by the writings of philosopher Monique Wittig,Turcotte, Louise. (foreword) The Straight Mind and Other Essays, Monique Wittig, Beacon Press, 1992, , p. ix the movement originated in France in the early 1980s, spreading soon after to the Canadian province of Quebec. * In TurkeyBadran, Margot, Feminism in Islam: Secular and Religious Convergences (Oxford, Eng.: Oneworld, 2009) p. 227 and Israel,Freedman, Marcia, \\"Theorizing Israeli Feminism, 1970‚Äì2000\\", in Misra, Kalpana, & Melanie S. Rich, Jewish Feminism in Israel: Some Contemporary Perspectives (Hanover, N.H.: Univ. Press of New England (Brandeis Univ. Press) 2003) pp. 9‚Äì10 second-wave feminism began in the 1980s. * Difference feminism was developed by feminists in the 1980s, in part as a reaction to popular liberal feminism (also known as \\"equality feminism\\"), which emphasizes the similarities between women and men in order to argue for equal treatment for women. Difference feminism, although it is still aimed at equality between men and women, emphasizes the differences between men and women and argues that identicality or sameness are not necessary in order for men and women, and masculine and feminine values, to be treated equally. Liberal feminism aims to make society and law gender-neutral, since it sees recognition of gender difference as a barrier to rights and participation within liberal democracy, while difference feminism holds that gender-neutrality harms women \\"whether by impelling them to imitate men, by depriving society of their distinctive contributions, or by letting them participate in society only on terms that favor men\\". * Equity feminism (also stylized equity-feminism) is a form of liberal feminism discussed since the 1980s, specifically a kind of classical liberal feminism and libertarian feminism. (revised 30 September 2013) ; 1990s * Third-wave feminism is associated with the emergence of riot grrrl, the feminist punk subculture, in the early 1990s in Olympia, Washington. In 1991 Anita Hill testified in Washington, D.C. to an all-male, all-white Senate Judiciary Committee that Clarence Thomas, nominated for the Supreme Court of the United States, had sexually harassed her. Rebecca Walker responded to Thomas's appointment with an article in Ms. Magazine, \\"Becoming the Third Wave\\" (1992), which coined the term third wave: \\"Do not vote for them unless they work for us. Do not have sex with them, do not break bread with them, do not nurture them if they don't prioritize our freedom to control our bodies and our lives. I am not a post-feminism feminist. I am the Third Wave.\\" The third wave focused on abolishing gender-role stereotypes and expanding feminism to include women of all races, classes and cultures. ; 2010s * Fourth-wave feminism began around 2012 and is characterized by a focus on the empowerment of women and the use of internet tools, and is centered on intersectionality.

Catt and his family committed several robberies, all occurring while the family lived a seemingly typical middle-class American life.  Family background  Ronald Scott Catt (born 1963, and known as \\"Scott\\") was an engineer married to \\"Beth\\" [nee Worrell] Catt. The couple had two children and lived in Dundee, Oregon, 45 miles outside Portland. After the 1997 death of his wife due to breast cancer, Scott Catt became addicted to drugs and alcohol. At the time of their mother's death, son Hayden was five and daughter Abby two years old. Friends afterward still saw Catt as a devoted single father to his children.Catt Family Bank Robbers: Father Ronald Scott Catt and 2 Children Suspected of Multiple Heists; 11/19/2012 11:34 am est, Updated: 11/21/2012; webpage; by Michael McLaughlin; Huffington Post; accessed May 2014 Hayden and Abby eventually attended McMinnville High School, where they were both honor students and members of the swimming team. Scott Catt was president of the McMinnville Swim Club board of directors and considered a well respected leader in the community. In 2011, Catt again lost his job and his house was foreclosed on. He connected with a corporate headhunter specializing in engineering, and relocated to Texas in January 2012. His children dropped out of school; Abby went to live with her grandmother, while Hayden moved to Hawaii to work at a resort. Hayden and Abby, however, soon joined Scott in Texas. The family lived in the Nottingham Place apartment complex in a middle-class community of Katy, Texas, a western suburb of Houston. Around the complex, the Catts were considered \\"just everyday, harmless people.\\" Catt held down a well-paying job as an engineer designing ore-moving systems for coke plants; Abby worked at the Victoria's Secret outlet at the Katy Mall; and Hayden attempted to get established as a concierge in an hotel.  Robberies  Sometime between 2000 and 2002, Catt began a series of as many as five Portland-area bank robberies‚Äîmost without the knowledge of his children‚Äîwhich spanned a time-frame of several years. Catt has commented that it was an attempt to keep his family solvent while feeding his old addictions‚Äîto which a compulsion to rob banks with some regularity was now being added.Catt Family: Police say Father, Son, Daughter May be Linked to 7 Bank Heists in Texas and Oregon; webpage; Crimesider Staff; November 19, 2012; CBS News online; accessed May 2014 = Portland, Oregon area = Because Catt's father had been a loan officer in a local bank, he had gained an insider's knowledge of day-to-day banking procedures. Catt remembered his father telling him as a boy of the day the local bank‚Äîat which he worked‚Äîwas robbed. When Catt inquired why no one had tried to stop it, his father told him that the preferred employee response to a bank robbery is to comply with the robbers and give them any money requested (as the money was insured, and the bank would get back any monetary losses it suffered). The first bank Catt robbed was the very one at which his father had worked, just a couple of blocks from where he was living in McMinnville. The robbery went off with no trouble and netted him around $2,500. It was a year before Catt robbed another bank, and he continued, committing another bank robbery every year or so, as the need arose. These usually netted him $5,000‚Äì$10,000 per job. In 2010, again behind on his bills, Catt planned to do another robbery. It was then he realized that with some additional help and the possibility of allowing him to get into the vault, he would be able to get more money during a bank robbery. Feeling unable to trust anyone except family, Catt asked his son to help him with what he referred to as his \\"part-time job\\". Hayden reluctantly agreed to join him, and at one point actually accompanied his father in casing a bank targeted by his father as the next to rob. On the day of the planned operation, however, he became too nervous to leave the apartment, so Scott simply robbed the bank himself, showing Hayden how easy it was. = Houston, Texas area = Starting fresh in Texas in 2012, Catt, now with the help of both his children, decided to embark on a crime spree, while the family kept up a facade of normality.Scott Catt Convinced Son and Daughter to Join Him as a Bank Robber; May 27, 2014; webpage; News.Com.AU; accessed May 2014 The first robbery that Scott Catt perpetrated with the help of his family occurred at a Comerica Bank in Harris County on August 9, 2012. Scott and Hayden entered the bank wearing hats, sunglasses, respirators (surgical masks), gloves, and painters' coveralls, and armed with lethal-looking Airsoft pistols (pellet guns). Abigail waited outside in the family car, a green 1999 Volkswagen Jetta equipped with stolen license plates taped over their own. The second robbery, which occurred November 9, 2012, took place at the First Community Credit Union in Katy. Because preliminary observations of the intended target showed a construction project was taking place nearby, Scott and Hayden wore bright orange safety vests and sunglasses to blend in with the numerous construction workers in the area. This time, Hayden wore a fake mustache, and Scott wore his familiar painter's mask. Abigail Catt once again drove the getaway vehicle.Catt Siblings Accept Plea Deals, Sentenced; November 14, 2013; article; Claudia Feldman; Houston Chronicle; accessed May 2014. Together, the two robberies netted the family $170,000 from the Texas banks.  Capture Police investigating the robberies as captured on the bank's CCTV footage of the second robbery in Houston, noted the newness of the orange safety vests the duo wore. By viewing recent video footage of area hardware store transactions, they were able to trace the purchase of the vests to a nearby Home Depot, where the Catt siblings were clearly identified buying the vests with their father's credit card. On the morning of November 9, 2012, as the Catt family was making the final preparations for their third and fourth robberies in the area (which were both scheduled for the next day), Scott and his son were arrested at their apartment without incident. After interviewing both of them and contacting Abby, she turned herself in the same day.  Sentencing  Although the statute of limitations for the Oregon robberies had expired by the time of the family's capture, they were still able to be considered in the sentencing phase of the trial. On November 14, 2013, in plea arrangements, Hayden Catt accepted a ten-year sentence in prison while his sister Abigail was given five years‚Äîboth being found guilty of one count of aggravated robbery.Father of Alleged Family of Robbers Pleads Guilty ; December 6, 2013; Staff; News 92 Houston online; accessed May 2014. The following month, Ronald \\"Scott\\" Catt pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery and received a 24-year prison sentence. The FBI suspected the father had committed other bank robberies in Oregon, but those were before his children were taking any part in robbing banks. =Release= On September 11, 2015, it was reported that Abigail Catt was granted parole after spending two years and 11 months of her five year sentence at Fort Bend County Jail. The sheriff of Fort Bend had held her at the jail instead of sending her to the prison due to the circumstances and him seeing her as a victim and wanting to help her prepare for a promising future. Following her release, however, she was re-jailed for over a year due to parole violations.Abby Catt Wants Fresh Start After Joining Family Bank Robbery Business; by Jill Sederstrom; webpage; June 27, 2019; Oxygen.com online; 20/20 interview; accessed May 2020 References Category:American bank robbers Category:21st-century American criminals Category:Crime families Category:Living people Category:People from Katy, Texas Category:People from McMinnville, Oregon Category:People from Dundee, Oregon Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Catt family"},{"id":"42873835","text":"Championa westcotti is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Players in the team are selected by the New South Wales Country Rugby Union from regions of New South Wales excluding Sydney and Southern NSW. New South Wales Country plays regular fixtures with other representative sides including City-Country matches with New South Wales Suburban for the Maher- Ross Cup, and the \\"Battle of the Borders\\" Cup against the Queensland Country Heelers. The NSW Country team adopted a logo featuring a Cockatoo in 1996. These native birds are common throughout regional areas of New South Wales. The team colours are orange (amber) and black. NSW Country Under 20 The New South Wales Country Under 20 team competes in the Southern States Championship and also plays occasional matches against other representative sides. Prior to 2008, country colts teams at under 21 and under 19 age levels were fielded in national and state competitions. History =Early Years: 1895 to 1949= The New South Wales Country team first played the Metropolitan Sydney side when the New South Wales Rugby Union inaugurated the Country Week carnivals in 1895. Sydney won in the first two years by 14‚Äì11 and 23‚Äì8, but in 1897 the Country team won by 16‚Äì3. The Country Week matches continued until 1914 with just two drought-affected years missed. The onset of the First World War in 1914, and the growth of rugby league brought rugby union to a halt in New South Wales. Rugby league took many of the ground tenures and, as the only football code played during the war, the majority of young men that left school. Although rugby union survived, the game languished in country parts of the state for many decades. Country Week matches were re-established in 1929, after a 15-year gap. New Zealand's All Blacks also toured in 1929, playing the NSW Country team in Armidale and winning 27‚Äì8. However, the 1930s Depression years had a debilitating effect on amateur sports including rugby, particularly in country areas with reduced prices for rural products. At the outset of the Second World War, the NSWRU decided that some club rugby would be maintained. A few matches were arranged and country teams managed their own games of mostly reserve team fixtures. Schoolboy matches were played, but representative rugby was discontinued. =Expansion and tours: 1950 to 1999= Rugby union in country regions of NSW expanded in the 1950s and 1960s. The NSW Country Rugby Union was founded in 1954. The NSW Country team defeated Sydney 17‚Äì8 in 1956, and lost to the touring South Africa by six points. The team drew 14‚Äìall with the Queensland Country team before playing a 16‚Äìall draw with Queensland in 1964. The 1970s was a golden period. NSW Country won the Wallaby Trophy in 1970. Under innovative coach Daryl Haberecht they won again in 1974 (beating Sydney, Queensland and Victoria), and again in 1975 (being undefeated). NSW Country also won matches against the England and Japan touring sides in 1975. The team undertook tours to New Zealand, Canada and the United States in 1974 and again in 1977, winning 13 from 15 matches and 7 from 13 matches respectively, including wins over Waikato and Counties in New Zealand. Periods of drought affected Country rugby in the early 1980s, but the NSW Country team toured New Zealand in 1980 and 1981, and United Kingdom and Europe in 1987. The Cockatoos name was adopted in 1996. The team toured to Ceylon in 1997, winning the Singer Cup when in Colombo. =Recent events: 2000 to present= The Australian Rugby Union started the Australian Rugby Shield competition in 2000, which NSW Country won four times; in 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2008. After the suspension of the competition at the end of 2008, the focus of the NSW Country Cockatoos returned to annual City-Country fixtures against NSW Suburban, and the \\"Battle of the Borders\\" Cup against the Queensland Country Heelers. The Cockatoos won the cup in five of the seven years to 2013. From 2019 the team participates in National Rugby Championship Division 2.

Geraldine was played as a sassy and liberated Southern woman who was coarsely flirty yet faithful to her (unseen) boyfriend \\"Killer\\". She was direct and confident and did not change her persona to suit anyone. Several of Geraldine's sayings entered U.S. popular culture as catchphrases, especially \\"When you're hot, you're hot; when you're not, you're not,\\" \\"The Devil made me do it,\\" and \\"What you see is what you get!\\" Wilson portrayed Geraldine many times in the early 1970s on his variety series The Flip Wilson Show, though not on every episode. He made comedy albums featuring Geraldine, notably The Devil Made Me Buy This Dress, and he appeared as Geraldine on other programs such as Saturday Night Live. He sang and danced as Geraldine at the Kennedy Center in 1983 for Bob Hope's 80th birthday celebration. Wilson tired of the Geraldine character late in his career; he responded to most requests by saying: \\"She's retired.\\" Origin Since the mid-1960s, Wilson had been using high-pitched voices to characterize women in his comedy routines. He said he was inspired by Butterfly McQueen's innocent depiction of \\"Prissy\\", Scarlett O'Hara's maid in the 1939 film Gone with the Wind. He used a high, brassy voice to portray from a black perspective both Queen Isabella (introduced as Queen Isabel Johnson) and a West Indian woman in a comedy routine titled \\"Christopher Columbus\\", appearing on his 1967 album Cowboys and Colored People. Wilson worked at developing his own version of the voice, imagining a black Southern woman living in a rural area. He performed embryonic Geraldine-type routines at stand-up comedy clubs, but not wearing women's clothing, and not with the name Geraldine. Wilson said he got the name Geraldine from a friend he had when he was eight or nine, a pretty girl that did not return his adoration. He said he always held a warm regard for her. The character of Geraldine was intended by Wilson to \\"relate to women\\" without putting them down. Wilson said he wanted Geraldine to be strong, proud, and honest in her dedication to her man; a woman who felt free to act spontaneously.Tafoya 2011, p. 101 In contrast to other comedians who belittled women, Wilson wanted Geraldine to be \\"the heroine of the story.\\" Introduction Wilson first introduced Geraldine by name and appearance in a comedy sketch on Labor Day, September 1, 1969, within a television special put together by Wilson, his manager Monte Kay, and NBC executives. The show was called The Flip Wilson Special. In the skit, comedian Jonathan Winters, dressed in drag as his popular character Maude Frickert‚Äîa gray-haired lady with a sharp tongue, was a passenger in an airliner. Wilson's Geraldine character entered, walking down the jet's aisle in a stewardess's miniskirt, and a bouffant flip hairdo topped by a pillbox hat. Geraldine sat down next to Maude and the comedic interaction was immediately infectious. Wilson said that Winters was chosen because his Maude character was well-known, and because there would be several points of comic tension: both men playing women, the generational difference in apparent age, and the difference in race. Wilson also performed as Geraldine on The Ed Sullivan Show on January 11, 1970. In the routine, Wilson takes on the persona of a preacher's wife. The wife (Geraldine) explains to her angry husband why she has an expensive new dress, telling him that \\"the devil made me buy this dress.\\" This skit was also performed by Wilson on his fourth comedy album, The Devil Made Me Buy This Dress‚Äîits title taken from Geraldine's retort. The album, featuring Geraldine on the cover, was certified Gold, and it won the 1970 Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording. Production The Flip Wilson Special was seen by 42% of all U.S. television viewers; this success led to NBC signing Wilson to The Flip Wilson Show. Wilson portrayed Geraldine many times during the four-year run of the show. Geraldine was cast in skits with a number of guests on the show, including David Frost, Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Lily Tomlin (playing Ernestine), Joe Namath, Jim Brown, Arte Johnson, Moms Mabley, Sammy Davis Jr., Tim Conway, Ray Charles, Lola Falana, Perry Como and Muhammad Ali.Cook 2013, pp. 93, 131. On television, Geraldine wore $500 dresses designed by Emilio Pucci, and $50 shoes. It took Wilson 20 minutes to prepare for the role, including having makeup applied by a cosmetician, and the setting of a wig. After the first TV special, Wilson was asked by NBC executives to reduce the size of Geraldine's bust, which he did. Geraldine often made reference to her boyfriend \\"Killer\\" who was not shown; following his television success, Wilson drove a series of Rolls-Royce cars, each one named KILLER as established by his vanity plateCook 2013, Chapter 10: Top of the World. Wilson developed other characters such as Sonny, the White House janitor who seemed better informed than the president; Freddy the Playboy who was never successful in his constant quest for a date; and Wilson's second- most popular character‚Äîthe larcenous and lecherous Reverend Leroy of the Church of What's Happenin' Now. Geraldine, however, received more attention from the media, gaining a cover photo on Ebony magazine in December 1970, Jet magazine in January 1971, and another Jet cover in January 1983. Legacy The character of Geraldine has been compared to previous depictions of fictional African American women, from Hattie McDaniel's silver screen portrayal of \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), to television's Sapphire Stevens, the wife of Kingfish on the Amos 'n' Andy show, played by Ernestine Wade in the 1950s. Professor Marjorie Garber writes that Geraldine was, in the early 1970s, television's favorite transvestite alter-ego. Wilson contributed to U.S. culture in several ways, for instance by helping to popularize Pigmeat Markham's earlier catchphrase, \\"Here come da judge,\\" and by introducing to a wider audience the practice of prearranged complex handshakes combined with the bumping of hips and elbows, but his Geraldine character's influence was greater. She planted three long-lived catchphrases: \\"When you're hot, you're hot; when you're not, you're not,\\" \\"The devil made me do it,\\" and \\"What you see is what you get!\\" The last was made into the acronym WYSIWYG by computer engineers to designate a text editing system that appears on screen much as it will appear in print. Geraldine has influenced subsequent fictional characters, notably Martins Sheneneh Jenkins, played by Martin Lawrence in the 1990s; In Living Colors Wanda the massage therapist, played by Jamie Foxx in the early '90s; Ella Mitchell's Hattie Mae Pierce, the title role of the 2000 film Big Momma's House; and Tyler Perry's recurring character Madea (1999‚Äìpresent). Today, Wilson's portrayal of Geraldine can be seen in rebroadcasts of the 1970s The Flip Wilson Show, shown on Magic Johnson's Aspire TV network.

He played on the wing. He played the majority of his career for the Johannesburg based teams, the Golden Lions in the Currie Cup and Vodacom Cup and the Cats in Super Rugby. Later in his career he moved to Durban and played for the in the Currie Cup, the Natal Wildebeest in the Vodacom Cup and the Sharks in Super Rugby. He was also capped thirteen times for the Springboks and scored four test tries. His career was hampered with injury and he never reached his full potential. He was quite large for a wing, but in the wake of Jonah Lomu's sensation at the 1995 Rugby World Cup, it was hoped that Dean Hall would become the Springbok's massive wing. Early life and youth career Dean Hall was born in Springs, in the Gauteng Province of South Africa on 2 September 1977. He went to Selection Park Primary School and then to Springs Boys High School. He played for Pirates Rugby Club in Gauteng. In 1996 Hall was selected for the South Africa U/23 team. He got selected for the under 23's again in 2000 when they competed in the African Rugby Championships. In 1997 and 1998 he played for the Golden Lions U/21 team, even though he got selected for the Golden Lions' senior team to play in the Currie Cup as early as 1997. Senior career =1997 to 1998= In 1997 while still eligible for age-group rugby, Hall was selected in the Golden Lions senior squad for the Currie Cup. He was not selected in the senior team in 1998, but continued to play for the Golden Lions U/21 team. =1999 to 2000= Hall started playing Currie Cup rugby in 1999 and became a regular starter for the Golden Lions in the Currie Cup as well as the Vodacom Cup. In 2000 he was selected for the Cat's Super Rugby squad. He went on to play 26 Super Rugby games for the Cats. He scored 20 tries for the Golden Lions in the Currie Cup season, which is fifth on the list of most tries scored in a season by a Lions player. In 1999, while Hall was part of the Golden Lions' team, they won the Currie Cup. Hall came on as a replacement during the final, which the Lions won 33-9 against the Sharks in Durban. =2001= In 2001 Hall continued to play Super Rugby for the Cats and gained instant fame when he flattened Highlanders back Iliesa Tanivula on his way to the tryline. This good form resulted in him being selected for the Springboks, ahead of veteran winger Pieter Rossouw. Jake White who was the Springboks' assistant coach at the time mentioned that Hall selection was to increase the skill level of the team in general and was viewed as a powerful statement of intent of Bok coach Harry Viljoen's plan to utilise the full width of the pitch in his game plan. On 16 June 2001, Hall made his test debut against at his home ground, Ellis Park in Johannesburg. The Springboks lost the game 23-32. Hall was again in the team the following week at Kings Park in Durban when the Springboks changed it around and ran out winners, 20-15. Hall played in all South Africa's Tri Nations games of 2001 Tri Nations Series, but failed to score a try. He was also selected for the Springboks' end of year tour to France, Italy, England and the USA. Hall scored his first test try in a 54-26 victory over at the Luigi Ferraris Stadium in Genoa on 17 November 2001. His other try of the tour came against the at the Robertson Stadium in Houston, Texas. =2002 to 2004= From 2002 to 2003 Hall continued to play Currie Cup rugby for the Golden Lions and Super Rugby for the Cats. Hall fell out of favour with the Springbok coaches in early 2002 and Breyton Paulse was preferred at left wing with Stefan Terblanche at right wing in the mid-year tests against and . He was selected to play in the South Africa A team which faced Argentina on 26 June 2002 in Witbank. A game South Africa A won 42-36, thanks to two tries scored by Hall. One of these tries came three minutes after the final hooter, to deny the Argentinians victory. Argentina led 36-35 before Hall's try. Paulse, coming back from injury, struggled with his form in the tests against Wales and Argentina and was replaced by Hall for the test against at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria on 6 July 2002. Hall scored 2 tries in a 60-18 victory for the Springboks. He also played in the first Tri Nations game of the season, against the All Blacks at Westpac Stadium in Wellington. South Africa lost this game 41-20 with Hall picking up an injury. He was replaced by Paulse the following game against in Brisbane. Hall played both games during the home leg of the tournament against Australia and New Zealand. The game against Australia on 17 August 2002 at Ellis Park turned out to be his last game in a Springbok jersey. Although he was part of the Golden Lions' Currie Cup squad during 2002, he was injured before the Currie Cup semi final and subsequently did not go on tour with the Springboks for their 2002 end of year tour. In 2003 he was recovering from a serious knee injury. He formed part of the Cats' Super Rugby squad, but injuries kept him on the sidelines for the majority of his remaining career. He never fully recovered from this serious knee injury and was never again selected for the Springboks. According to one doctor who examined him in 2002, his knee cartilage had turned into that of a pensioners. =2005 to 2007= In a bid to revive his career, Hall moved to the . He was included in the Sharks' Super Rugby squad for 2005, but failed to make the team for any Super Rugby match. In 2006 he played Vodacom Cup rugby for the Natal Wildebeest and was part of the Currie Cup squad. In total he played seven games for the Durban-based team, including a Sharks Invitational XV who faced the Western Force in Pietermaritzburg in June 2006 in preparation for the Currie Cup. At the start of the 2006/2007 Japanese season, Hall joined the Ricoh Black Rams in Japan. Hall went on to earn 12 caps for Ricoh during the season. After retirement Hall has remained involved with rugby, being involved in rugby development in previously disadvantaged communities. In 2011 he was also involved in an Advanced Players and Coaches course at St Stithians College in Bryanston, hosted by The Investec International Rugby Academy, where young rugby players aged 16 to 18 spent time with top coaches and players.

He also edited the Arabic and Persian Supplement of Epigraphia Indica from 1913 to 1940. He was instrumental in the restoration and conservation of most sites in the Hyderabad state, including the caves at Ajanta, Bidar fort, and Daulatabad.  Early life and career  Yazdani was born on 22 March 1885 in Delhi. He was educated under Rev. J. Godfrey F. Day and C.F. Andrews. The young Yazdani was also trained under Maulavi Mohammad Ishaq and Shamsul Ulama Maulavi Nazeer Ahmad. In 1903, he stood first in Aligarh Muslim University in his intermediate exams, and in 1905, he stood first in Arabic, Oriental Classics, and English in the B.A. exam, winning three gold medals: the Macleod medal, the Aitchison medal, and the F.S. Jamaluddin medal. He succeeded Josef Horovitz as the Epigraphist to the Government of India for Persian and Arabic inscriptions in 1915, and held that office till 1941. In 1907, he was appointed the Professor of Persian at St. Stephen's College in Delhi, and in 1909, H.

In 1913, the Government of Punjab appointed him as the Professor of Arabic at the Government College in Lahore.  Director of the Archaeological Department of H.E.H. The Nizam's Dominions  Upon the recommendation of John Marshall, he was deputed to Hyderabad to organize the Archaeological Department of H.E.H the Nizam's Dominions (Hyderabad state) in 1914. He became the first Director of the department and served for 30 years till his retirement in 1943. In this capacity, he also edited the Annual Report of the Archaeological Department of His Exalted Highness The Nizam‚Äôs Dominions.Sohoni, Pushkar, and Amol Kulkarni, ‚ÄòIndex to the Annual Reports of the Archaeological Department of His Exalted Highness The Nizam‚Äôs Dominions‚Äô in Journal of Deccan Studies, vol. 6 no. 1 (Jan‚ÄìJun 2009). Dr. Yazdani visited Bidar for the first time in 1915, drew up a comprehensive program for the thorough repair and conservation of the monuments at Bidar, and the work was carried out by the Government of Hyderabad State under Mir Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII, the Nizam of Hyderabad. He introduced an illustrated booklet, to serve as a guide-book titled The Antiquities of Bidar in 1917. Later, he completed his book Bidar: Its History and Monuments published by the Nizam‚Äôs Government and printed at Oxford University Press in 1947. The work done by him on the preservation of monuments and exploration and excavation of relics of ancient civilization, particularly Ellora, Ajanta and Bidar, was well received not only in India but also in Europe and the United States of America, Dr. Yazdani wrote several books. He wrote about eight volumes on the work of Ajanta and Ellora before and after excavation and preservation. Dr. Yazdani received several honours such as being elected a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society, a Member of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, and an Honorary Fellow of Islamic Research Association, Bombay. He was involved with Osmania University right since its inception.ibid., Sherwani, Dr. Ghulam Yazdani, p. 8. In 1936, he was conferred the title of \\"Officer of the Distinguished Order of the British Empire\\" (O.B.E.). He also received several honorary doctorates from several universities. Finally, in recognition of his glorious service to history and archaeology, the Government of India conferred the award of Padma Bhushan in 1959. () Dr. Yazdani was also a mentor to the next generation of scholars who worked on the Deccan, such as Haroon Khan Sherwani. Dr. Sherwani is best known for his two volume work co-edited with Purushottam Mahadev Joshi (Director, Bombay Archives) called History of Medieval Deccan. Sherwani and Joshi in turn mentored a new generation of Deccan scholars, including A.R. Kulkarni, Teutonico R. D'Souza, and M.A. Nayeem, all of whom can be thought of as being in the intellectual lineage of Ghulam Yazdani.  Later life  The Government of India awarded him the Padma Bhushan, then the second highest civilian award, in 1959. He died on 13 November 1962. Unfortunately, his contributions have never been celebrated by the Archaeological Survey of India, or by the state archaeology departments of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Karnataka.

It was opened to the public on 8 June 2014. Ghatkopar is the busiest station on Line 1, with a daily passenger traffic of 94,053 in February 2017. History The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) acquired a 1,400 square metre plot near the Ghatkopar railway station for construction of the Ghatkopar metro station. The MMRDA initially believed that the land belonged to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). While the metro was being constructed, the CR wrote letters to the MMRDA informing them that the land actually belonged to CR. After CR submitted documents proving the same, the MMRDA agreed to compensate them for the plot. At a meeting between MMRDA and CR officials in April 2014, it was agreed that the former would pay for acquiring the land as part of an inter-governmental agency deal. However, some CR officials were reportedly upset as the amount was far lower than the market value of the land. As per market trends at the time, the land was estimated to be worth . Infrastructure In March 2017, MMOPL completed the installation of LED lights at the station. The replacement of the station's 1,718 lamps with LED lights halved its energy consumption. Only lamps were replaced; fixtures were not. The total reduction in the station's electricity consumption amounts to 120,000 units per year providing the MMOPL with an annual saving of . There are 7 sets of automated fare collection (AFC) gates at Ghatkopar station. Three more will be installed by the end of June 2014. The station has textured tiles intended to provide grip to wheelchair-bound commuters. The station also has an elevator wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair, and a ramp from road level up to the elevator, enabling access for the disabled.http://www.livemint.com/Specials/3ee825zwXnt14uE3qJIRVI/Mapping- disabledfriendly-buildings-and-facilities.html Foot-over-bridge The Ghatkopar station is connected with the western side of the Ghatkopar railway station through a 12-meter wide foot-over-bridge (FOB). Commuters who want to exit the metro station from the main gate must purchase a platform ticket to cross the FOB and reach the road.http://www.mid-day.com/articles/taking-the- mumbai-metro-pay-up-for-using-rail-fob/15396190 Although the Central Railway (CR) had initially permitted metro commuters to use the FOB as a goodwill gesture around two weeks after the metro's opening, they announced that commuters found using the FOB without a platform ticket or a railway pass would be fined. A CR official told Mid Day, \\"We have seen the flow of passengers and we think that our local train passengers are facing a problem because of the sudden rush of Metro passengers. Therefore we are now insisting that Metro passengers buy tickets to use the railway-owned overbridge.\\" Railway Pravasi Sangh President Subhash Gupta told the paper, \\"I am aware of this issue and also took it up in the meeting with railway officials.

A three-bristled frenulum (i.e., with three bristles on each side) is the most common condition in the Arotropora Meyrick group (100% of females examined), Epitymbiini (96%), Orthocomotis Dognin group (92%), Mictopsichia H√ºbner group (88%), Atteriini (83%), Tortricini (82%), Sparganothini (78%), Phricanthini (73%), Euliini (71%), Archipini (62%), Cnephasiini (61%), and Schoenotenini (51%). In Cochylini a two-bristled frenulum is the most common condition (i.e., 59% of all females examined). In Ceracini a four-bristled frenulum is the most common condition (i.e., 37%), with the vast majority of individuals possessing four or more bristles on at least one side; only 4% had three bristles (both sides). Although variation is rampant at the species, generic, and tribal levels, the data suggest a strong tendency for the reduction of bristles in Cochylini, where two (both sides) is the dominant condition; the addition of bristles in Ceracini, where four bristles is the most common condition; and more bristles in the largest species (e.g., Choristoneura conflictana (Walker), Zacorisca electrina (Meyrick), and Varifula sp.).

An incident where Soma is asked to cough up a 10 lakh bribe so as to be included in the state cricket team turns his life upside down. Not only does the selector leave out Soma's name from the final list, but also refuses to return the money. What ticks off Soma even more is a swear word uttered by the selector. In an impulsive act of rage, Soma kills the selector and thus begins his tryst with the Bangalore crime scene. Soma having emerged as one of the most wanted criminals, is on the hit list of police officers Ashok, Mani and Ugrappa. Does he fall to their bullets? And is there any connection between him and the Soma in Deadly Soma?  Music  The background music was composed by L. N. Shastry. There is only one situational song composed by him for the film.

International clinics are generally much more expensive than public hospitals and will be able to accept non-Chinese insurance. In Beijing, there are a number of such companies, the most prominent being Puhua International Hospital - Shuangjing, Beijing United Family Hospital and International SOS. Background Private medical institutions outside of Traditional Chinese Medicine clinics is a relatively new concept in China with healthcare being synonymous with large public hospitals. Beijing boasts some of the most famous and well reputed medical facilities such as the Xie He, Chaoyang and Tiantan Hospitals. For expats, the accessibility of these services are limited due to language barriers and a gap between what is given and what is expected of a hospital by western standards. Public hospitals require patients to first take a number (Gua hao), following which they will normally wait several hours to see a doctor. Consultations are generally very short and many expat patients can be surprised at the level of customer service available. International clinics will offer a similar level of service as one might expect from a private clinic in Europe or the United States and as such is the primary choice of expats in Beijing, particularly those with international health insurance. General characteristics There are a number of common traits that an organization must possess to be considered an International Clinic. An organization does not need to necessarily have all of them to qualify. The most apparent traits are: * Non-Chinese Doctors: International Clinics will tend to have several foreign doctors who will either serve as management or as specialists in specialties which may be under represented or developed in Chinese medical education. These doctors will generally come from many countries around the world and speak a variety of languages, though it is rare that they speak Chinese. To practice in China, they need a medical license in their own country as well as China. * English Speaking Chinese Doctors: Due to the difficulty in recruiting foreign doctors in China, a large number of the medical staff in an international clinic will still be Chinese. General practitioners will speak English fluently as well as some specialists. However, due to the number of specialties that many international clinics offer, many of their Chinese doctors are part-time and may be on loan from Chinese hospitals. In these situations, they normally have little to no English ability. * English Speaking Nurses: Most if not all nurses in International Clinics will speak English, with many having worked abroad. Nurses will generally act as the primary translators for Non-English speaking doctors. * Multi-Lingual Customer service: Most International Clinics will have a team of customer service professionals who speak a host of different languages to aid in communication. Some clinics will choose to specialize in certain nationalities, particularly those with close knit communities. * Foreign Ownership: Most International Clinics will either be owned by a non- Chinese parent company or be a joint venture with a Chinese company. Management can vary from Chinese to Foreign depending on the clinic. * Direct Billing with International insurance providers: Most International Clinics will have these systems in place so as to allow patients to claim directly without the need to pay up front and later claim back.

It first aired on ABC on February 6, 1978 and starred Kay Lenz as a shy, withdrawn young woman who discovers that she has psychic powers after joining a sorority. The film achieved some controversy upon its initial airing on television as part of the film's plot involved Morgan Fairchild wearing a wet T-shirt after being thrown into a fountain, something that had not been previously shown in a made-for-TV movie. The film was later re-made in 2006 for ABC Family and Fairchild returned to portray the mother of the titular Sarah and her sister, who was renamed Lindsay. Fairchild initially regretted portraying Jennifer in the 1978 film but later changed her mind after producer Chuck Fries stated that while it was easy to find an ingenue, it was difficult to find someone who could play a convincing \\"bitch\\". Synopsis The film opens with Sarah (Kay Lenz), a painfully shy young woman, and her beautiful sister Patty (Morgan Brittany) playing on the beach at sunset. Patty wanders off to play in the surf with a young man, only for him to try to force himself on her. After a moment the man recoils and it is implied that Sarah has used telekinesis to save Patty. The film then cuts to the two sisters driving to college. On the way there Patty and Sarah discuss plans for the two of them to join Alpha Nu Sigma (ŒëŒùŒ£) as their mother was a member of the sorority. Sarah points out that she (Sarah) is adopted and that Patty is their mother's only biological child, as she was adopted shortly after she was born. Once at the campus the two girls attend a rush week party at ŒëŒùŒ£. Patty is instantly welcomed into the sorority's clique while Sarah is directed to the nearby Phi Epsilon Delta (Œ¶ŒïŒî) house, as they do not view her as a potential candidate. The sisters both go to the Œ¶ŒïŒî house, where they are met with a general lack of enthusiasm from almost all of the girls other than Mouse (Tisa Farrow), an awkward and shy young woman who is instantly drawn to Sarah. After rush week is over Patty is overjoyed to get into ŒëŒùŒ£, but is somewhat hurt when she discovers that not only did Sarah not get in, but that ŒëŒùŒ£ president Jennifer (Morgan Fairchild) insists that Patty not speak to Sarah, as she was accepted into Œ¶ŒïŒî. This causes friction between the two sisters, as Sarah is frustrated at Patty's reluctant willingness to follow Jennifer's orders. As the semester progresses Sarah begins to strike up a relationship of sorts with Paul (Tony Bill), a teaching assistant for her psychology classes, and becomes somewhat closer to Mouse. She's unnerved by the Œ¶ŒïŒî's den mother Mrs. Hunter (Shelley Winters), who recognizes that Sarah has special powers and insists that she use them to lead Œ¶ŒïŒî to glory against the ŒëŒùŒ£. Patty continually tries to find ways to talk to Sarah but is repeatedly unsuccessful and Jennifer's taunting ultimately leads Sarah to use her powers to push Jennifer into a fountain. Feeling vindicated by the encounter, Sarah begins to open up to the idea of her powers but does not fully embrace them until Jennifer orchestrates a cruel prank against Sarah where she is pelted with rotten food, eggs, and mud. While the prank is successful in humiliating Sarah, it finally pushes Patty to leave Jennifer's sorority. Angry, Sarah rebuffs Paul's attempts to persuade her that Mrs. Hunter is evil and that she should leave the sorority, ultimately deciding to hold an initiation ceremony with Mrs. Hunter. On the night of the ceremony Sarah and the other Œ¶ŒïŒîs eagerly follow Mrs. Hunter's lead. Sarah notes that Mouse is not at the ceremony but is pacified by Mrs. Hunter's assurances that Mouse will show up at the final portion of the night's events. As the group is led through the ceremony, the ŒëŒùŒ£ are also going through their own initiation rites. At Mrs. Hunter's prompting Sarah uses her powers to disrupt the ceremony for an interruption, causing the wind to blow the ŒëŒùŒ£' dresses and cause Jennifer's face to permanently warp into a horrific visage. However, when Sarah discovers that the Œ¶ŒïŒî ceremony will end with Mouse getting sacrificed, she uses her powers to stop the ceremony but ends up burning herself and Mrs. Hunter alive. The film ends with Patty deciding to join Œ¶ŒïŒî at Mouse's insistence and the two sorrowfully gaze at a picture of Patty and Sarah in happier times.

Most of the reviews shared the opinion that while the film was cheesy, they enjoyed the acting. Multiple reviewers also noted its similarity to the 1976 film Carrie, which also dealt with the subject of a female outcast that discovers telekinetic powers, with comparing it unfavorably to the earlier film while still maintaining that The Initiation of Sarah was overall enjoyable.

P√∂rksen is on the editorial board of multiple systemic-constructivist journals (Constructivist Foundations, Cybernetics and Human Knowing and Familiendynamik). Amongst the central topics of his research, counseling and lecturing activities are the dynamics of public outrage, media scandals and questions of media ethics, models and theories of communication, styles of stage management in politics and the media, journalism and celebrity. He is in constant demand on the different media as a welcome partner for interviews and debates and regularly comments on topical media-political developments. His book on modern systems theory and the philosophy of constructivism (together with the Austrian-American cybernetics Heinz von Foerster and the Chilean neurobiologist Humberto Maturana) are available in German, English, Italian, Danish, Korean and Spanish. His 1998 publication together with Heinz von Foerster, \\"Truth is the invention of a liar\\", is meanwhile considered a classic of systemic thought.http://www.systemagazin.de/buecher/klassiker/foerster_poerksen_wahrheit.php P√∂rksen has written several books, together with his students, dealing with current media topics (\\"Trendbuch Journalismus\\", \\"Skandal! - Die Macht √∂ffentlicher Emp√∂rung\\" [Scandal!

In the book written with the colleague Hanne Detel, \\"The unleashed scandal. The end of control in the digital age\\" he shows that the evolution and escalation of the scandal has entered a new phase in the digital age. The claim is that each and everyone can nowadays trigger a scandal, and that each and everyone can become its target and victim. Traditional dramaturgical principles of the classical mass media, e.g. the height of a plunge to the depths, are no longer key criteria. The fundamental implication of the authors' analyses is that the uncontrollability of public effects has become an integral part of everybody's daily experience.http://www.tagesspiegel.de/medien/interview-jeder-und-alles-ist- skandalisierbar/6661640.html  Books in English  * with Heinz von Foerster: Understanding Systems.

The Making of the English Landscape is a 1955 book by the English local historian William George Hoskins. It is illustrated with 82 monochrome plates, mostly photographs by Hoskins himself, and 17 maps or plans. It has appeared in at least 35 editions and reprints in English and other languages. The book is a landscape history of England and a seminal text in that discipline and in local history. The brief history of some one thousand years is widely used in local and environmental history courses. Hoskins defines the theme of the book in the first chapter, arguing that a landscape historian needs to use botany, physical geography and natural history as well as historical knowledge to interpret any given scene fully. The remaining chapters describe how the English landscape was formed from the Anglo-Saxon period onwards, starting c. 450 AD, and looking in detail at the mediaeval landscape, the depopulation following the Black Death, the Tudor period through to the splendour of the Georgian period, the parliamentary enclosures that affected much of the English midlands, the industrial revolution, the development of road, canal, and railway transport networks, and finally the growth of towns from Norman times onwards. There is little mention of cities. The concluding chapter however laments the damage done to the English countryside by \\"the villainous requirements of the new age\\" such as military airfields and arterial roads, describes the new England as barbaric, and invites the reader to contemplate the past. The work has been widely admired, but also described as grandly emotive, populist, and openly anti-modernist. Writers have praised the book for helping them understand and interpret the landscape in which they lived. Book =Overview= The introduction sets out Hoskins' stall with \\"No book exists to describe the manner in which the various landscapes of this country came to assume the shape and appearance they now have\\",The Making of the English Landscape, 1955. Introduction. mentioning geology (\\"only one aspect of the subject\\"), the clearing of woodlands, the reclaiming of moor and marsh, the creation of fields, roads, towns, country houses, mines, canals and railways: \\"in short, with everything that has altered the natural landscape.\\" =Editions and translations= Exeter Abbey estate (right) was marked by a \\"double ditch\\", creating high earth hedgebanks on both sides. The first edition was published by Hodder and Stoughton in 1955. They reprinted the book in 1956, 1957, 1960, 1963, 1965, 1967, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1974, 1977. They issued a new edition in 1988, a revised edition in 1992, and a new edition in 2005, reissued in 2006. They published Korean and Japanese editions in 2008. In 1970, Penguin Books published a paperback Pelican edition in England and a Penguin edition in the United States. Penguin reprinted in 1973, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1991, and 2005. In 1977, Book Club Associates published an edition in England. In 1988, Coronet Books and Guild Publishers published editions in England. In 1992, Teach Yourself Books published a paperback edition in England. In 2005, the Folio Society published an edition in England. In 2013, Little Toller books published a paperback edition in England. =Illustrations= The book is illustrated with 82 monochrome plates and 17 maps or plans, all uncredited except for some use of Ordnance Survey maps, and so apparently the work of Hoskins himself. These are closely integrated into the text; for example, the text in chapter 1 is accompanied by a pair of diagrams showing how a holloway ('hollow way') could be formed by the digging of a 'double ditch', i.e. a pair of raised earth banks either side of a ditch to mark the boundary of two estates, and supported by a photograph (Plate 13) of a sunken lane in Devon, explained by Hoskins as a boundary, from probably the seventh century, between the Saxon estates of (royal) Silverton and Exeter Abbey. The photograph shows high hedgebanks in bright sunshine, dwarfing the figure of a woman in the middle distance. Contents The book covers its subject in 10 chapters: =1. The Landscape before the English Settlement= The Malvern Hills above the Severn plain of the English West Midlands Hoskins uses the first few pages of this chapter as an introduction, beginning with praise for William Wordsworth's A Guide through the District of the Lakes (1810), and from which he quotes a passage in which the reader is asked to envisage \\"an image of the tides visiting and revisiting the friths, the main sea dashing against the bolder shore\\".Hoskins, 1970. p17 Hoskins writes that on a desolate moor one can feel oneself imaginatively back in time to the Bronze Age, but that there are now few such unaltered places left. He argues that the landscape historian \\"needs to be a botanist, a physical geographer, and a naturalist, as well as an historian\\"Hoskins, 1970. p19 to understand a scene in full: The rest of the chapter covers Pre-Roman, Western (i.e. Celtic) and Roman Britain. He estimates very roughly that 750,000 acres at most were in use as arable or grassland in Roman times, compared to 27 million acres in 1914. =2. The English Settlement= The method of ploughing the fields created a distinctive ridge and furrow pattern in open field system farming. The outlines of the mediaeval strips of cultivation, called selions, are still clearly visible in these now enclosed fields at Wood Stanway, Gloucestershire. Hoskins describes how England was settled with Anglo-Saxon people between c. 450 and 1066 AD, making the country a land of villages. Estate boundaries from this period survive in features such as sunken lanes and banks. The Scandinavian conquest of much of England from the late 9th century added more villages, though many with Scandinavian placename elements such as -by ('village') may simply have been renamed Saxon settlements. Many English villages were given their shape in this period, and almost all are described in some detail in the eleventh century Domesday Book. Hoskins identifies three major types of village: those around a green or central square, as at Finchingfield in Essex; those along a single street, like Henley in Arden in Warwickshire; and those consisting of apparently haphazardly scattered dwellings, like Middle Barton near Hoskins's home in Oxfordshire. =3. The Colonization of Mediaeval England= This chapter looks at the mediaeval landscape from the Domesday Book onwards, with the section 'The Landscape in 1086'. The country had almost every village that exists today; a typical one, Hoskins writes, had a small watermill and a church without a spire. In 'The Clearing of the Woodlands', Hoskins argues that before the 15th century England must have looked like one great forest, but most of the woods were cleared for arable or pasture in the 12th and 13th centuries. Under Henry II perhaps a third of the country was royal forest. Hoskins begins the section on 'Marsh, Fen, and Moor' with the words \\"There are certain sheets of the one-inch Ordnance Survey maps which one can sit down and read like a book for an hour on end, with growing pleasure and imaginative excitement\\".Hoskins, 1970. p95 One such section is of The Wash, rich in mediaeval detail. Marshes such as those in Lincolnshire, Norfolk and the Pevensey Levels were reclaimed at this time, whole communities working together, often under the Danelaw. South Middleton, a deserted village in Northumberland 'Buildings in the landscape' briefly describes abbeys, churches, mills, bridges and castles built to serve the growing population, which just before the Black Death had tripled since Domesday. =4. The Black Death and after= Hoskins describes the abandonment of villages from the bubonic plague of 1348, the Black Death, which killed a third to a half of the population (he states), and the subsequent new colonisation and building as the population eventually recovered. Marginal land such as the Breckland of Norfolk and Suffolk, never thickly populated, was abandoned. Many villages in counties such as Leicestershire were deserted. Villages such as Lower Ditchford in Gloucestershire can be seen today only as a ground-plan from the air. Between 1350 and 1500, many new buildings appeared, especially churches with towers like Fotheringhay in Northamptonshire. Some fine bridges as at Wadebridge in Cornwall are from this period. =5. Tudor to Georgian England= The fa√ßade of Burghley House, built between 1558 and 1587 Hoskins starts this chapter by observing that in 1500 in Tudor times there were roughly three sheep for every human being in England, perhaps 8 million sheep to two and a half million people. There were four million acres of hardwood forest, remembered now as Epping Forest, the Forest of Arden, Sherwood Forest, the Forest of Dean, Wychwood and many others. A village might be surrounded by a single enormous thousand acre field, shared amongst all the village's farmers. There were extensive heaths and wild places, largely uninhabited, with \\"no industrial smoke, nothing faster on the roads than a horse, no incessant noises from the sky\\".Hoskins, 1970. p139 The first enclosures and the flowering of rural England, country houses and parks such as the magnificent Burghley House and Knole date from this period up to Georgian times. =6. Parliamentary Enclosure and the Landscape= Orchards around Canterbury, Kent in the 'Garden of England' on 1945 one-inch Ordnance Survey map. Some fields and orchards appear to have been enclosed directly from the woods to the west of the town in mediaeval times. The network of Roman roads to the town had been joined by a network of five railway lines. In this chapter Hoskins describes the effects of enclosure on the landscape and on fields, hedgerows and trees, roads and farmhouses. He begins by quoting the rural poet John Clare: \\"Inclosure, thou'rt a curse upon the land, and tasteless was the wretch who thy existence plann'd\\".Hoskins, 1970. p177 Parliamentary enclosures accounted for about 4.5 million acres of what had been open fields, not counting the enclosure of common land and wild 'waste'. In 1700 roughly half England's arable land was already enclosed; by the end of the enclosure process, almost all of it was. The revolution in the landscape began in about 1750, affecting about 3,000 parishes, especially in the English midlands. Between 1760 and 1800 there were 1,479 enclosure acts, covering 2.5 million acres; another 1.5 million acres were enclosed by 1844, by more than a thousand further acts. Some counties such as Kent, Essex and Devon were little affected, having largely been enclosed much earlier, often directly from forest or moorland. Many miles of new straight hedgerows were laid to mark out the newly enclosed fields of the midlands; in some areas such as Derbyshire, straight limestone walls were used instead. Many straight new roads were created at the same time. Farmhouses remained in the old villages at first, but new red-brick Victorian ones were often built in the middle of their now enclosed land in due course. =7. The Industrial Revolution and the Landscape= Hoskins begins his chapter on industrialisation with the remark \\"England was still a peaceful agricultural country at the beginning of the seventeenth century.\\"Hoskins, 1970. p211 He describes the early industrial landscape, water power and early mills, steam power and slums. He names transformative inventions such as Kay's flying shuttle of 1733 and Hargreaves's spinning jenny of 1767, and comments that Matthew Boulton opened his steam engine factory \\"in the still unravished country\\"Hoskins, 1970. p215 outside Birmingham in 1765. He quotes a poem by Anna Seward lamenting the ravishing of Coalbrookdale, c. 1785, and one by Wordsworth from The Excursion. He is critical of the industrial slums and the smoke and dirt of the Staffordshire Potteries. He emphasises the rapid growth of industrial towns like Preston, and of new towns like Middlesbrough, which went from a single farm in 1830 to over 50,000 inhabitants in 1880. However he appreciates the mining landscapes of Cornwall, including the gleaming white china clay pits of St Austell and the abandoned tin mines of St Cleer, commenting that \\"there is a point, as Arthur Young saw, when industrial ugliness becomes sublime\\".Hoskins, 1970. p232 =8. Roads, Canals, and Railways= The canal basin at Stourport, the only town in England to be created by canals, according to Hoskins Hoskins describes roads and trackways from the Iron Age (like the Jurassic Way across the midlands, near his Oxfordshire home) and Roman times (like Akeman Street in the same area). He notes that the Fosse Way runs for miles in Gloucestershire away from any village, as the Anglo-Saxons built villages away from large roads for safety. Still in his home area, he records that \\"the wide green track now called Dornford Lane\\"Hoskins, 1970. p240 was built in the 10th century for supplies to be carted from the Anglo- Saxon kings' own estate at Barton. He goes on to describe the building of the canal network between roughly 1760 and 1825, noting that just one town was created by the canals, Stourport. Soon afterwards, a much more widespread transport network transformed the English landscape: the railways. Hoskins devotes over a page to each of two quotations from Charles Dickens's Dombey and Son, describing the construction in 1836 of a railway in Camden Town. He mentions, too, that Wordsworth campaigned against the railway from Kendal to Windermere, bringing trains into the heart of the Lake District, and that conservatives like Wordsworth \\"lost all along the line\\".Hoskins, 1970. p263 =9. The Landscape of Towns= The main street in the former market town of Marlborough, Wiltshire is exceptionally wide, probably made, argues Hoskins, to hold the once regular sheep market.Hoskins, 1970. p291 Many of the houses were rebuilt in brick or refronted with tiles in the 18th and 19th centuries. The last chapter of the body of the book ‚Äì if Chapter 10 is considered more or less an epilogue ‚Äì covers towns seen as part of the English landscape. Hoskins justifies this on the grounds that understanding towns brings pleasure. He describes in turn planned towns, the open-field town, and the market town. Towns were planned as early as Norman times, Abbot Baldwin planning Bury St Edmunds between 1066 and 1086; Stratford-on-Avon was laid out in 1196. Another burst of town planning came with the spa towns in the late 18th century, and of new industrial towns like Middlesbrough and Barrow-in-Furness in the mid 19th century. Open-field towns like Nottingham, Leicester, and Stamford grew naturally in their own open fields, but were trapped by pasture rights from growing in the 19th century, giving Nottingham slums, and Leicester a problem that it just managed to solve, growing across its fields: while Stamford stopped growing entirely, becoming fossilised as what Hoskins calls a museum piece of a beautiful 17th and 18th century town.Hoskins, 1970. p280 Finally, the market towns like Marlborough grew up around their often large and handsome market places, which are however of any number of shapes. =10. The Landscape Today= Hoskins concludes with a brief chapter, with one image, Plate 82, \\"The completed English landscape\\" showing a tall tree in a wide open field, a strip of hedges and villages just visible in the distance. The chapter laments the damage caused to parts of the English landscape, mentioning bulldozers and tractors, nuclear bombers and by-passes, and ends by celebrating again the wealth of detail within a few hundred yards of Hoskins' study window at Steeple Barton in Oxfordshire. Reception =Contemporary= The geographer E. G. R. Taylor, reviewing the book for the Royal Geographical Society in 1955, wrote that Hoskins made the case for getting a strong pair of boots to learn landscape history clearly enough. Taylor compared the book to Dudley Stamp's Man and the Land, published a few months earlier in 1955, saying that Hoskins seemed to have missed it, but that given the differences in their approaches, they could be read side by side. She noted also that Hoskins did not talk about London though he covered town landscapes, and appeared unaware of urban geography. Her review ended by remarking that Hoskins \\"views the industrial revolution with mounting horror, and the industrialists themselves are bitterly chastised as 'completely and grotesquely insensitive. No scruples weakened their lust for money; they made their money and left their muck.'\\" She noted however that Hoskins had happily moved to \\"a quiet spot in Oxfordshire where he can forget the 'barbaric England of the scientists, the military men and the politicians' and look out of his study window on to the past\\", where, she wrote, he \\"draws for us a last tender and evocative picture of the 'gentle unravished English landscape.'\\" Dr. Hoskins, she wrote, forgetting all the horrors, \\"reaches back through the centuries one by one and rediscovers Eden\\". =Modern= The A34 in Oxfordshire: \\"the arterial by-pass, treeless and stinking of diesel oil, murderous with lorries\\" Penelope Lively, writing in The Guardian, describes the book as William Boyd, also in The Guardian, described the book as \\"an absolute trailblazer, a revolution.\\" He notes that W. H. Auden \\"revered\\" the book, and that reading Hoskins had enabled him to 'read' a landscape as a \\"historical palimpsest\\": Local historian Graeme White, in The Medieval English Landscape, 1400‚Äì1540, calls Hoskins' book \\"brilliantly-crafted\\" and observes that \\"Although this famously railed against the 'England of the arterial by- pass, treeless and stinking of diesel oil' ‚Äì along with much else belonging to the mid-twentieth century ‚Äì the fact that national car ownership more than doubled during the 1950s made this a subject whose time had come.\\" Paul Johnson, writing in The Spectator, said that the book \\"was for me an eye- opener, as it was for many people. It told us of the extent to which our landscape had been made by man, not God, and taught us to look much more observantly at it.\\" =An assessment= A row of huts with water tower and radio mast in the United States Air Force base at Upper Heyford, from where \\"the obscene shape of the atom-bomber\\" deplored by Hoskins flew daily over Oxfordshire Matthew H. Johnson, writing a chapter on English culture and landscape in the edited book The Public Value of the Humanities, identifies \\"six key points\\" established by Hoskins: :1. The landscape is of great antiquity (\\"everything is much older than we think\\"Hoskins, 1955. p 12) :2. Landscapes often changed suddenly, as in the 18th century enclosures. :3. Hoskins, following O. G. S. Crawford's 1953 Archaeology in the Field, stressed we had to read the landscape using research to reveal its cultural value. :4. Hoskins thus told a \\"grand and emotive story about that landscape.\\" Johnson compares this to J.R.R. Tolkien's account in The Lord of the Rings when the hobbits return to a \\"despoiled and industrialized landscape of the Shire\\". :5. The narrative is populist, to be disseminated \\"to anyone who would listen.\\" The result was that it became part of English post-war culture. :6. It was \\"openly anti-modernist\\". In evidence, Johnson cites Hoskins's \\"most famous passage\\" from the concluding chapter: : Television In 1972 the BBC broadcast an episode of the television programme Horizon on The Making of the English Landscape produced by Peter Jones, and featuring Hoskins as presenter. Although the programme was inspired by the original book, Hoskins wrote an 84-page illustrated BBC book, English Landscapes, to accompany the programme. Later in the 1970s, Jones went on to produce a series of 12 TV programmes for BBC2, Landscapes of England, in which additional areas of the country were studied,Hoskins, W.G., 1978; 'One Man's England', BBC, London. leading to a further title, One Man's England to accompany the series.

His work produced evidence that countered and overturned many assumptions, such as that crime rates are higher in urban areas, and increased during post-war periods and economic downturns. His works on the history of crime in several cities were extensive, cataloging close to every recorded homicide in New York City since 1798, and every homicide in Los Angeles since 1827, and conducting extensive studies on several more cities, primarily in the Western world. At one time he believed that murder was largely \\"a problem of men\\", and that \\"If men take charge of anything ... it must be of the notion that real men don't kill, that self-respect means shrugging off an insult, and that the better manliness accrues to him who does not fight. Other countries have done this, and so can the United States.\\"  Life  Monkkonen was born in 1942 in Kansas City, and grew up in Duluth, Minnesota. He gained an interest in studying murder as a graduate student in the late 1960s, in part because it was clearly studied over a long period of time. He earned his bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees from the University of Minnesota between 1964 and 1973, after which he taught at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte for a few years. After publishing The Dangerous Class: Crime and Poverty in Columbus, Ohio, 1860-1885 in 1975, Monkkonen moved to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and continued working there for the rest of his career. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1995, and died on May 30, 2005 at the age of 62 in Culver City, California. His family and colleagues at UCLA established the Eric Monkkonen Fund to support students working in social history.  Research  Monkkonen's comparison of cities in the United States with other cities in the Western world led him to conclude that violence was endemic in the U.S., which has had a homicide rate much higher than the rest of the Western world except Russia, and over 200 years the murder rate in New York City was five times that of London, even after removing murders with guns. He also found that the U.S. had a disinclination to prosecute murders, such as with the first three decades in 19th century New York City, when most murders went unpunished, and London executed four times the number of offenders. By gleaning records going back deep into the history of major cities and conducting far-reaching studies of crime in the U.S., Monkkonen was able to precisely measure how much crime there was, overturning many assumptions. Using his meticulously constructed database of 1,781 cases in New York City, he found that factors such as poverty, crowding, a corrupt justice system, and riots are not necessarily preconditions to an increase in homicides. He found that some of the most miserable times in New York City's history, such as during the Great Depression were the times with the lowest murder rates. He furthermore found that New York City had a lower murder rate in the first half of the 1900s than the nation as a whole; his database of murders that he compiled between 1830 and 1960 showed that Los Angeles in 1900 was four times more violent than New York City. He also found that the murder rate in Los Angeles declined after World War II; it was commonly believed that violence on the battlefield made brought the tendency of violence back at home, but Monkkonen speculated that soldiers returning home were sickened by gunplay and were actually less likely to use weapons to kill, and that they were also more focused on their domestic needs in starting families. He even claimed that cities are not necessarily more murderous than the country, a point that was the most debated after his book Murder in New York City came out, but which nonetheless won high praise.

History  In 1989, Child Helpline International founder Jeroo Billimoria explored the idea of creating a global network of child helplines, which could provide technical assistance to each other, and in countries who wanted to start or expand their own helplines. This led to a meeting, held in Amsterdam in 2003, and attended by representatives from 49 child helplines from around the globe. At this meeting, Child Helpline International was launched.  Principle and Mission  The work of Child Helpline International is firmly grounded in the principle of United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which highlights the children's rights to privacy and protection from harm. The stated mission of the Child Helpline International network is to provide a forum for information sharing and mutual support, assistance with advocacy and lobbying, promoting the rights of children and child helplines as a medium of assistance to children, and to support the initiation and development of child helplines in countries which do not have such services.  Operations  Child Helpline International is based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The Executive Director of Child Helpline International is Patrick Krens. Child Helpline International is a membership-based organization with 173 members in 142 countries and territories around the world (as at December 2018). In 2015, the child helplines who are members of Child Helpline International had received over 20 million contacts from children and young people in need for care and protection.Buljanovic, K. & Prasad, R. R.(November 2013)\\"The Voices of Children and Young People.\\" Child Helpline International 10th year anniversary publications. p.1  Knowledge Exchange Platform  A key role of the network is to provide platform for knowledge transfers between the members. Types of knowledge exchange activities are: # Peer Exchanges: Members of the network learn from one another through visits, sharing solutions, comparing expertise and experiences. # Peer Evaluations: Member organizations compare and evaluate good practices, governance and operations of their own child helplines with other members. # Trainings and Workshops: Member organizations learn from trainings and workshops to make sure that each child helpline stay abreast of changing times and needs and possess the up-to-date skills # International and Regional Consultations: International and Regional Consultations are biennial events held in alternating years in which the members, partners, and stakeholders come together to find common ground, report and reflect on collective experiences from the existing child helplines.

She was one of the seven ANC MPs who were nominated for the ad hoc committee to consider President Jacob Zuma‚Äòs submissions on the public protector‚Äôs report on his Nkandla home. Muthambi holds a B Proc from the University of Venda (1993-1996), and various other certifications and qualifications from UPTA, Wits Business School and UNIVEN. An ad hoc Parliamentary committee found Muthambi \\"incompetent\\" and guilty of misleading parliament, which is a criminal offence. She also failed to attend a meeting where she was supposed to explain the R300,000 she spent on transport costs for friends and family to watch her deliver a speech. . She has also failed to attend a meeting in order to account for her personal staff of 27 (many of whom are the children of friends of hers), when the ministerial handbook limits this figure to 10. As a result of the Public Protector‚Äôs findings of abuses of power, fraud and maladministration against Hlaudi Motsoeneng, the Western Cape High Court concluded that Muthambi had acted irrationally and unlawfully by appointing Motsoeneng as Chief Operating Officer of the SABC. Treason and corruption charges 2017 In 2017 Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) laid charges of treason and corruption against Muthambi over claims that the then Minister of Communications deliberately shared three confidential Cabinet memoranda about executive policy and the scope of her ministerial powers through emails with Tony Gupta, Duduzane Zuma and Sahara‚Äôs CEO Ashu Chawla in July 2014. This was shortly after former president Jacob Zuma appointed her communications minister. Criminal charges 2019 Following the release of the report of the commission of inquiry into editorial interference at the SABC in 2016, the Democratic Alliance opened a criminal case against Muthambi for misleading parliament, which is in direct contravention of the Powers, Privileges and Immunities of Parliament and Provincial Legislatures Act, which establishes the SABC as an independent institution. The commission of inquiry found that Muthambi (along with two others named in the final report) abused her power to get coverage of specific stories concerning her private interests, and interfered on several occasions in editorial decisions at the state broadcaster during her time as Communications Minister. As a result Muthambi could be dismissed as a member of parliament.

Life and career  The daughter of actor and general theatre administrator Vassil Spassov and his wife Teresa Azaryan (sister of director Krikor Azaryan), Spassova grew up in Sofia. She attended the Galabov Gymnasium, a German-language secondary school in Sofia, and then studied drama at the Krastyo Sarafov National Academy for Theatre and Film Arts. While still a student she met author and director Ivan Stanev. She was one of the founder members of Stanev's first theatre company, and together they developed their own special language for theatre. This provoked a fierce reaction from the board of censors in Bulgaria, an Eastern Bloc state at the time, and led to Stanev being temporarily barred from exercising his profession In 1987 Spassova was engaged by the State theatre ‚Äú Sofia‚Äù in Sofia, where she made her debut in the role of Marie in Stanev's production Die Wunde Woyzeck.\\"Theater heute, 9/88\\" In 1988 Heiner M√ºller invited the company to stage the production in West Berlin. After this guest performance, which formed part of the Heiner-M√ºller Werkschau, Stanev did not return to Bulgaria. In 1989 he invited Spassova to Munich, where she played the leading role in Stanev's collage Betrogen/Gestern nach einem sonnigen NachmittagTotentanz der Gef√ºhle, M√ºnchner Abendzeitung, 11. Mai 1989Osteurop√§ische Sphynx, M√ºnchner Merkur, 1989 at the Studiotheater M√ºnchen. In 1990 Spassova moved to Berlin, founded an international theatre company with Stanev and performed at the Hebbel-Theater and the Podewil. In 1996 she signed on with the Volksb√ºhne am Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz and until 2000 performed there in numerous productions by Frank Castorf, Christoph Marthaler and Penelope Wehrli, among others. She went on to work as a free-lance actress in Basel (Theater Basel), Munich (M√ºnchner Kammerspiele) and Salzburg (Salzburger Festspiele) and continued to work with Ivan Stanev and his ensemble in Berlin and France. In 2004 she returned to the Volksb√ºhne in Berlin and until 2017 remained there as a permanent member of the company. In addition to her work in theatre, Spassova has also played parts in many radio plays and audio books. Her first roles as a film actress were in Tom Toelle's Bismarck, Stanev's Villa dei Misteri and Luxor Las Vegas and in Castorf's D√§monen and Der Idiot. In 2012 Spassova played the leading role in the Bulgarian feature film \\"Az sum Ti\\" (English: \\"I am You\\") and received several awards for her performance. In 2013 \\"Az sum Ti\\" was screened at the 16th Shanghai International Film Festival.16th Shanghai International Film Festival: Nominees  Work in theatre (selection)  *1989: Betrogen/Gestern an einem sonnigen Nachmittag von Pinter / M√ºller - Regie: Ivan Stanev *1990: Schuld und B√ºhne von Ivan Stanev - Regie: Ivan Stanev *1991: Hermaphroditus von Ivan Stanev - Regie: Ivan Stanev *1992: Br√ºderchen und Schwesterchen von Ivan Stanev - Regie: Ivan Stanev *1993: Die Mutter von Witkiewitch - Regie: Peter Staatsmann *1995: Die M√∂we von Tschechow - Regie: Ivan Stanev *1996: Hochzeitsreise von Sorokin - Regie: Frank Castorf *1996: Anne Sexton - Regie: Penelope.

The full title of the English version of the book is An embassy from the East-India Company of the United Provinces, to the Grand Tartar Cham, emperor of China: delivered by their excellencies Peter de Goyer and Jacob de Keyzer, at his imperial city of Peking wherein the cities, towns, villages, ports, rivers, &c.; in their passages from Canton to Peking are ingeniously described by John Nieuhoff; Englished and set forth with their several sculptures by John Ogilby. The book served as a major influence in the rise of chinoiserie in the early eighteenth century.  Publication history  The book was first published in Dutch in 1665 by Johan's brother Hendrik and the Amsterdam-based publisher and printer Jacob van Meurs. Its original title was Het Gezandtschap der Ne√™rlandtsche Oost-Indische Compagnie, aan den grooten Tartarischen Cham, den tegenwoordigen Keizer van China: Waarin de gedenkwaerdigste Geschiedenissen, die onder het reizen door de Sineesche landtschappen, Quantung, Kiangsi, Nanking, Xantung en Peking, en aan het Keizerlijke Hof te Peking, sedert den jaren 1655 tot 1657 zijn voorgevallen, op het bondigste verhandelt worden. Beneffens een Naukeurige Beschrijvinge der Sineesche Steden, Dorpen, Regeering, Weetenschappen, Hantwerken, Zeden, Godsdiensten, Gebouwen, Drachten, Schepen, Bergen, Gewassen, Dieren, et cetera en oorlogen tegen de Tartar : ver√ßiert men over de 150 afbeeltsels, na't leven in Sina getekent. Because of the immense success it enjoyed, several other editions, albeit heavily edited and geared towards commercial interests, soon appeared. It was also translated into French, German, Latin and eventually into English in respectively, 1665, 1666, 1168 and 1669. The English version was not published by Van Meurs, but by John Ogilby instead.  Content  Johan Nieuhof - Frontispiece. The book consists of the notes and illustrations that Nieuhof made in his position as a steward on Peter de Goyer and Jacob de Keizer's embassy to the emperor of China. These notes and illustrations were left in the care of his brother Hendrik, \\"so as they not fall prey to rugged seas and hollow waves\\". This manuscript was eventually bundled and published to form this book, containing a written account of the embassy as well as 149 illustrations. The work itself is split into two parts. The first part contains the written account of the embassy led by Peter de Goyer and Jacob de Keizer to the emperor of China. It details the entire journey from Canton to Peking and back again. This part also contains descriptions and depictions of all that the embassy came to pass on its trip. The second part consists of a general overview of China, wherein a variety of subjects comes to pass, containing descriptions and images of bridges, mountains, temples, customs, et cetera. The work provides a total of 149 pictures, an unusual high number. Importance of the work Within the 'new' stream of information about China that began in the late seventeenth century, with reports of travel trade missions, An Embassy was a unique source. Especially the pictures marked a milestone in the history of the genre, because they were more realistic than before, providing both the real appearance of the Chinese people and their costumes. Prior to this period, the image of the Chinese in Europe was dominated by fantasy illustrations, already circulating for a number of centuries. Thus, this was the first work in a series of sources based not on fantasies, but on a direct representation of the Chinese life. Johan Nieuhof and his successors not only enhanced European knowledge about China, the pictures also gave an impetus to the growth of Chinoiserie in the arts. Many subsequent artists and architects based their work on Nieuhof's pictures. Bibliography * Bluss√©, L. & R. Falkenburg (1987) Johan Nieuwhofs beelden van een Chinareis, 1655-1657.

The exact date for the foundation is uncertain, but it is first recorded in 1325 during the time that Bernard of Kilwinning (1324‚Äìc.1328) was Abbot of Arbroath.The 1325 date appears in a document Inquisicio facta de domo elimosinaria, from Reg. Nig. Fol. 59/ Regal.fol. 99. (see ). A further reference is found in a later document, Assedatio terrarum de Spedalfeilde facta Reginaldo de Dunbradan et Hugoni Macpessi, from Regist. Nig. F. 14/ Regist. Regali f 16. (see ). The Abbey itself was founded in 1178 by King William the Lion for a group of Tironensian Benedictine monks from Kelso Abbey. It was consecrated in 1197. It is possible that the hospital was used by travellers, as a chantry or possibly almshouse. The only visible remains of the medieval hospital are a left hand door arch which has been incorporated into the 19th-century Hospitalfield House.Some doubt on the authenticity of the door arch has been expressed. It is possible that it may be a 16th-century doorway as it has similar characteristics as mouldings on apertures at Melgund Castle, Brechin. In the nineteenth century a chance location of about 120 skeletons in shallow graves near Hospitalfield House suggests the site of a medieval burial ground. Hospitalfield House is now an arts centre, and inspired the fictional location \\"Monkbarns\\", the home of Jonathan Oldbuck, title character of Sir Walter Scott‚Äôs novel, The Antiquary. History The history of the Hospital of St John the Baptist, \\"iuxta Aberbrothoc\\" [near Arbroath], is not certain. Miller (1860) in his History of the Abbey at Arbroath provides a workable framework. He writes: > This chapel [of St John the Baptist] stood near the mansion-house of > Hospitalfield, a mile to the westward of Arbroath, and was erected in > connection with the hospital or infirmary of the Abbey, established at this > healthy spot at such a distance from the parent monastery as to relieve it > from the risk of danger from contagious diseases. He dates the hospital as being: > ...in existence previous to the year 1325, when Abbot Bernard leased the > lands of \\"Spedalfeilde, belonging to the hospital of Saint John Baptist, > near Aberbrothoc,\\" to Reginald de Dunbradan and Hugo Macpeesis, for five > years, at a rent of forty shillings, payable to the Almory of the monastery; > and took them bound to build two sufficient husbandry houses‚Äînamely, a barn > forty feet long, and a byre of the same length, within one year from their > entry, and to leave the same in good order on the lands at the end of their > lease‚Äîa noticeable instance of progress in the management of lands, and the > wisdom of the Abbot's administration. Miller states that the hospital was connected with the \\"Eleemosynary of Arbroath\\": that is, a charitable foundation. He continues with the history: > In an inquest, made on 22nd November 1464, regarding the nature of the > foundations of the Almory and Infirmary, the jury stated that \\"Spitalfelde\\" > and this chapel were not distinct from the property of the monastery, and > that the Monks of the Almory received annually two merks from these lands. > The chapel was consecrated, and the altar of it dedicated, on 23rd August > 1485, by the Bishop of Dromore. The Bishop of the time was Georgios Vranas, a Greek by birth, who was Bishop of Dromore from 1483 to 1499. Miller gives one further notice, which he states is the last mention of the chapel in the Abbey register: > On 4th December 1490, the Abbot let the teinds of the church of Abernethy to > John Ramsay of Kilgour, for a yearly rent, and a sum advanced for the repair > of the chapel of the infirmary, which is described as in danger of falling > into ruin. An obligation for the payment of annates due from this hospital was made 30 June 1519. Also, a charter of 1543 that details the lands and holdings of this hospital is in the possession of the Trustees of Hospitalfield House.Derek Hall, c2002. In the 1570s, Alexander Beaton, a son of Cardinal David Beaton and Marion Ogilvy lived at Hospitalfield.Margaret Sanderson, Mary Stewart's People (Edinburgh, 1987), p. 19. =Nineteenth-century archaeology= Location of the Hospital of St John the Baptist c1352 and Arbroath Abbey. Nineteenth century stone carving from Hospitalfield House signifying the monastic connection of the house to the medieval hospital. David Miller, in his History of the Abbey at Arbroath written in 1860, describes Hospitalfield House as follows: > The older or central part of the present mansion-house of Hospitalfield is > evidently a part of the ancient Abbey hospital. This is proved by the > remains of several old doors and other indications about the walls of the > house; and especially by one side of an ancient door which was lately > discovered during some alterations in the front wall, a few yards west from > the modern door, and which the proprietor, with good taste, has caused to be > repaired and left open for inspection. This door appears, from the depth and > character of its mouldings to have been one of the principal entrances to > the hospital, and to have been erected after the early English style of > architecture had ceased to be followed. The spring of the upper stones shews > that its head was either a pointed or semicircular arch, having the side > mouldings carried round without alteration, and without capitals at the > spring of the arch. If our view be correct, these marks denote the erection > of the hospital to have been from fifty to a hundred years subsequent to the > foundation of the Abbey. Late in 1860 a chance discovery by Patrick Allan-Fraser, owner of Hospitalfield, led to an archaeological dig that located some 120 skeletons which were probably from a burial place adjacent to the original hospital. Antiquarian Andrew Jervise undertook an excavation in the spring of 1861. The account of the excavation and the significance of the find is recalled in detail in an article Jervise wrote for the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. He recalls the date when Allan-Fraser first discovered the skeletons and their significance as follows: Andrew Jervise as painted by Patrick Allan-Fraser > During the autumn of 1860, while a field was being broken up by the plough > upon the estate of Hospitalfield, bits of human bones were brought to the > surface. Fortunately, the proprietor, Patrick Allan-Fraser, Esq., F.S.A. > Scot., was walking along with the ploughman at the time; and on making > further search, Mr Fraser discovered portions of more than one skeleton, > upon which, with the laudable view of having the place more fully searched, > agricultural operations were suspended. The weather proving very > unfavourable, it was not until the 26th of February following that the > investigations were proceeded with. These were conducted under the joint > superintendence of Mr. Fraser and myself, when excavations were made at the > place where the bones were first discovered, and over an area of about 60 > feet in length by about 40 feet in width, which was considerably more than > the apparent extent of the cemetery. Within the space of about 10 or 12 feet > square, which was laid open around the spot where the remains were first > observed, no fewer than five or six skeletons were found; and on making > trenches about 5 feet apart, skeletons were got lying in pretty regular > rows. They were all remarkably entire, the teeth being in most cases quite > fresh, and exhibiting but few signs of disease ever having existed. The > bodies appeared to have been laid at full length. The heads were towards the > south-west, with the exception of those of some children and that of a mere > infant, which lay from north to south. Jervise concluded that the site had been the cemetery for the Hospital of St John the Baptist, which he was certain had stood nearby. During the same excavations, some foundations were discovered. Jervise offered caution about their significance, stating that their identification with the hospital chapel was uncertain, but that the chapel had been recorded in this area.See Also G. Hay, and G. Hay, History of Arbroath to the Present Time: With Notices of the Civil and Ecclesiastical Affairs of the Neighbouring District, Thomas Buncle, Arbroath, 1899). esp. pp 38/39. When the courtyard of the house was re-laid in the 1980s, building foundations were discovered which maybe further fragments of hospital buildings. Human remains have been discovered at two locations at the Red Lion caravan park to the south of the house, in 1952 and also in 1996. Visible Remains of the Hospital The only remains of the original buildings is a portion of a doorway which is built into a room in the house.Some doubt has been cast on this claim. This fragment of doorway is still visible inside the house beside the junction of one of the bay windows (see infobox picture above). Hospitalfield House Hospitalfield House, Arbroath, Scotland. The site of St John the Baptist Hospital. The remains of the hospital are in and around Hospitalfield House. After the Scottish Reformation the land was purchased by a James Fraser around 1665. The present house was built in the 19th century, and was the home of Patrick Allan Fraser (1812‚Äì1890), a noted Scottish painter and antiquarian. After his death the house passed to a trust dedicated to providing training in the arts, and it continues to be run as a charitable arts centre. The house is a category A listed building. =Walter Scott and The Antiquary= Edie Ochiltree from the 1914 Edition of The Antiquary - Edited by F. A. Cavenagh Sir Walter Scott published his third novel in 1816, entitled The Antiquary. The story is partly set around Arbroath, or \\"Fairport\\" as it is called in the novel. Scott had visited Hospitalfield House in 1803 and 1809, and used it as the basis of the fictional house of Monkbarns.

These are wild visions, but they sure seem real, and even attainable, when Conquest sings of them\\".Dahlen, C., Pitchfork Review, August 20, 2002 The Penguin Guide to Jazz observed \\"There is something refreshingly sanguine and upbeat about all the music on this record\\". The All About Jazz review noted \\"What marks Raining on the Moon as unique in Parker's long list of recordings is its raw accessibility.

The Christmas Get Down at the Grand Pavilion, December 2019 The Matlock Bath Pavilion has been home to many music events. Most notably in 1980 when Elvis Costello performed there. The building has also been used as a nightclub however closed down in the early 2000s. In 2019, it was once again used as a nightclub with the main hall being used to hold a Rave put on by a local radio station and a 15k Soundsystem.

Hart was the first woman president of the American Phytopathological Society, and was instrumental in making the University of Minnesota's Department of Plant Pathology a world-leader in stem rust. Early life and education Hart was born in Janesville, Wisconsin to Alice Hart (nee Echlin) of Janesville and Richard Johnson Hart, a dentist from York, England. She attended Janesville‚Äôs public schools and graduated from high school in June 1918.Brainard, V. (1950). Ladies, labs, and love. Page 1W in: Minneapolis Sunday Tribune, September, 24.

She earned a Bachelor of Arts in botany in the spring of 1922. Career In the summer of 1922, after facing initial discouragement from Elvin C. Stakman, chair of the Department of Plant Pathology, Hart began to work towards her master's degree as a laboratory assistant at the university farm. Hart focused her master's research on flax rust, specifically the environmental influences on the life cycle of the fungus that causes it. She earned her master's degree from the University of Minnesota in 1924, after which she began work as a part-time instructor in the Department of Plant Pathology. For the next four years, Hart performed research focused on how the structure of wheat plant tissues relates to the morphology of the stem rust pathogen. Hunt successfully presented her doctoral dissertation, titled \\"Morphological and Physiological Studies on Stem Rust Resistance in Wheat\\" in 1929 and was awarded her Ph.D. In 1931, her dissertation was published in the U.S.D.A.

He unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Nevada, losing to Democrat Steve Sisolak in the 2018 gubernatorial election. Early life Laxalt was born in Reno, Nevada, the son of Pete Domenici, a Republican U.S. Senator from New Mexico, and Michelle Laxalt. He is the grandson of former Republican Nevada Governor and U.S. Senator Paul Laxalt. Laxalt's mother raised him as a single parent. Laxalt's paternity was not publicly acknowledged by his parents until 2013. At that time, Domenici acknowledged that Laxalt was his son and was born as a result of an extramarital affair. Education After graduating from St. Stephen's & St. Agnes School, a college preparatory school in Alexandria, Virginia, he enrolled at Tulane University. After attending Tulane for two years, where he admitted to having drinking problems, he transferred to Georgetown University, where he graduated magna cum laude in 2001 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He then graduated from Georgetown University Law Center with a Juris Doctor degree in 2005. =Driving and traffic record= Driving under the influence In 1997, Laxalt was arrested for driving under the influence after he was pulled over and taken to a Virginia police station, where he was found to have a high blood-alcohol content. Laxalt was treated for alcoholism at the Hazelden Foundation near Minneapolis. Traffic tickets and failure to appear in court Also revealed for the first time in September 2018, Laxalt was issued eight traffic tickets ‚Äî including five for speeding‚Äî between 1996 and 2006 in Virginia and Maryland, where he spent most of his life before moving to Nevada in 2011. One citation was for driving 82 mph in a 55 mph zone in August 2003. Laxalt was fined $140 and ordered to appear in court, but did not show up and did not pay the fine until August 2018, 15 years later. Early career Laxalt first worked for then-Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs John R. Bolton, before joining the office of Virginia U.S. Senator John Warner. After leaving Washington, Laxalt worked for the law firm Lewis Roca Rothgerber Christie at its Reno office until 2014, when he left the firm to concentrate on his bid for Attorney General. He opposed the full repeal of \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" in 2010. Military service Laxalt served in the United States Navy's Judge Advocate General's Corps from July 2005 to August 2010. His assignments included instructing law courses at the United States Naval Academy, and he volunteered for a posting to Camp Victory, Iraq during the Iraq War. He attained the rank of lieutenant, and his awards included the Iraq Campaign Medal and Joint Service Commendation Medal. Campaign for Nevada Attorney General After practicing with Lewis Roca Rothgerber, Laxalt considered a campaign for Nevada Attorney General. In January 2014, he announced his candidacy. Laxalt was the Republican nominee in the general election, and overcame issues including negative performance evaluations from his law firm which were leaked to the press and claims that he was a carpetbagger too new to Nevada to be considered for statewide office. In the general election, he defeated Democratic nominee Ross Miller and minor-party candidate Jonathan Hansen. Career as Attorney General Laxalt was sworn in as the 33rd Attorney General of Nevada on January 5, 2015. His inauguration made him the youngest Attorney General in the United States at the time of his election.\\"Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval Inaugural\\". www.Nevada.Video.SSC.com. Retrieved October 14th, 2015. =Office organization= Laxalt created the Office of Military Legal Assistance, a program that provides Nevada's military members with pro-bono legal representation, and the Federalism Unit that challenges federal regulations including the Environmental Protection Agency's Waters of the United States Rule and the Bureau of Land Management's Sage Grouse Plan. =Restrictions on reproductive choice= As attorney general, Laxalt signed Nevada onto at least four known lawsuits supporting abortion restrictions or pro-life entities in other states. Laxalt signed onto two lawsuits supporting bans on the most commonly used second-trimester abortion procedure. Republican pro-choice Governor Brian Sandoval's office said it was not consulted before Laxalt signed Nevada onto the Texas abortion ban brief. In the Supreme Court case Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, Laxalt signed an amicus brief in support of a Texas TRAP law that imposed medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion clinics in order to curb the availability of abortion providers. The Supreme Court found the restrictions were an unconstitutional violation of the prohibition on placing an ‚Äúundue burden‚Äù on the right to obtain an abortion. =Koch network support= Laxalt signed onto a California lawsuit to support keeping secret the identities of the donors to one of his biggest political backers, the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, backed by the GOP megadonors Charles and David Koch. Laxalt opposed a multi- state investigation into ExxonMobil's alleged role in downplaying climate change, condemning it as an attempt to stifle an ‚Äúongoing public policy debate‚Äù over human-caused global warming. Laxalt took legal action to keep fraud investigators from scrutinizing groups connected to the Koch network, which went on to spend $2.5 million to support Laxalt's governor campaign. =Successor= Laxalt did not run for re-election, choosing instead to run for Nevada state governor; he was succeeded by Democrat Aaron Ford on January 7, 2019. 2018 gubernatorial campaign Laxalt was the Republican nominee for Governor of Nevada in the 2018 election, defeating four other candidates to win the nomination. Laxalt lost to Democratic nominee and chair of the Clark County Commission Steve Sisolak in the general election; Sisolak become the first Democrat to win the governorship in 20 years. While Laxalt won 15 of Nevada's county-level jurisdictions (14 counties and the independent city of Carson City), he lost the two largest, Clark (home to Las Vegas) and Washoe (home to Reno). He lost Clark by over 86,000 votes, double his statewide margin of 39,700 votes. Asked if there were any gun violence prevention measures Nevada needs to implement to prevent another October 1st tragedy, Laxalt responded ‚ÄúYou know, I think it's important to slow down on this October 1.‚Äù Laxalt was asked what he would do if elected to put in place the initiative voters passed to enact universal background checks and responded ‚ÄúI wouldn't change anything as governor.‚Äù Asked if he would propose a referendum to put Nevada's abortion law up for a vote, Laxalt responded ‚ÄúWe are going to look into it.‚Äù =Endorsements= President Donald Trump An endorsement of Laxalt for Nevada Governor was announced on June 12. Governor Brian Sandoval's decision not to endorse Incumbent Republican Governor Brian Sandoval did not endorse a candidate in the election to succeed him, saying he would not \\"support a candidate that is going to undo anything that I put forward.\\" During Sandoval's tenure as Governor, he and Laxalt had disputed over tax policy, environmental regulations and gambling regulations. Other Nevada Republicans U.S. Senator Dean Heller, Lieutenant Governor Mark Hutchison, State Treasurer and 2018 Republican gubernatorial primary candidate Dan Schwartz, former Reno mayor Bob Cashell and Sparks mayor Geno Martini endorsed Laxalt. Storey County Sheriff Gerald Antinoro Laxalt was endorsed by Storey County Sheriff Gerald Antinoro in November 2017 after he announced his candidacy. Laxalt faced scrutiny for declining to disavow Antinoro's campaign support. Antinoro was accused of rape in 2014. A 2016 independent investigation found that Antinoro sexually harassed his top deputy. Storey County Administrator Austin Osborne said in a deposition that ‚Äúnumerous‚Ä¶more than 10‚Äù complaints including sexual harassment allegations were filed against Antinoro. After the sexual harassment investigation, Antinoro faced a recall election. In April 2018, Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center called on Laxalt to rescind the endorsement and to investigate multiple allegations of sexual harassment against Antinoro. In May 2018, Laxalt dismissed criticism of his refusal to reject the endorsement or denounce Antinoro as ‚Äúpolitical theatrics.‚Äù Laxalt was scheduled to campaign with Antinoro at the end of May 2018 but Antinoro announced he would not attend after the event was picked up in media. In July 2018, Laxalt released the long-awaited investigative report into Antinoro and announced that he would not pursue criminal charges. The investigation was criticized for not interviewing Antinoro, alleged co-perpetrators or multiple rape victims. After the investigation concluded, Laxalt announced he would no longer campaign with Antinoro or use his endorsement. An October 2018 letter showed that the Attorney's General office met with former deputy sheriff Melanie Keener in early 2016, at which time the deputy shared details of Antinoro's history of sexually harassing employees.

Early life and sumo background Ichinnorov is the first of all Mongolian wrestlers who have gone on to join Japanese sumo to come from a nomadic clan, as most of the Mongolians who preceded him have been city dwellers. From a young age he participated actively in B√∂kh, traditional Mongolian wrestling, and at the age of 14 he took the championship in the B√∂kh competition held in his province of Arkhangai. On moving to Japan, he was on the judo team at his high school in Tottori prefecture but when the sumo coach at the school saw his ability he asked him to transfer to the sumo team. In his second and third years he collected a total of five amateur sumo titles. After graduating he was originally slated to join Minato stable which had no foreign wrestlers at the time (as only one foreign-born wrestler is allowed per stable) but he instead stayed on at his high school as a coach, and won a national amateur sumo championship taking the title of amateur yokozuna or grand champion in 2013. Career Ichinojo started professionally with Minato stable by taking the physical examination for new wrestlers prior to the November 2013 tournament, but as he had yet to procure his working visa, his entry to competition was postponed to the January 2014 tournament. With his previous amateur yokozuna title, he was allowed to debut at the high rank of makushita 15 in a system called makushita tsukedashi, the second foreign-born rikishi to ever achieve this status after Japanese-Brazilian Ry≈´d≈ç. As no one else in his stable was ranked in the makushita division or higher, he automatically became the highest ranked wrestler in his stable on entering, a rare occurrence. His shikona used his real name for the sound of the first kanji, which means \\"outstanding talent\\", and the second kanji, meaning \\"castle\\", was taken from his high school (J≈çhoku). In his debut he turned in an impressive 6‚Äì1 record, which also included a win in his last bout against Am≈´ru, a wrestler with professional experience at the j≈´ry≈ç level. He was promoted to makushita 3 for the following tournament. The upper ranks of makushita are extremely competitive with up-and-coming wrestlers trying to break into professional sumo and recently demoted j≈´ry≈ç wrestlers trying to gain re-promotion. In this environment, Ichinoj≈ç still managed a 6‚Äì1 record, with the majority of his wins being against wrestlers with j≈´ry≈ç experience. His record allowed him to make his debut in the professional ranks of j≈´ry≈ç in only his third tournament. He debuted at j≈´ry≈ç 10 and managed an 11‚Äì4 record, which tied him with four other wrestlers. On the final day he won a four-man playoff to take the championship, with both his playoff wins being against wrestlers he had lost against during the regular tournament, Kotoy≈´ki and Kagami≈ç. He lost the July 2014 j≈´ry≈ç championship in a playoff with the former komusubi Tochinoshin who was returning from injury, but his 13‚Äì2 record from near the top of the second division was easily enough for promotion into the top makuuchi division. He had risen through the ranks so fast that he did not have time to grow his hair long enough to form the traditional chonmage that sekitori usually wear. In the subsequent September tournament he defeated top division stalwarts and former san'yaku Tochi≈çzan, Sh≈çh≈çzan, and Chiyo≈çtori before being handed his first loss on Day 7 by Ikioi. He continued winning the second week and was paired against increasingly higher-ranked opponents, beating two ≈çzeki and the yokozuna Kakury≈´ before falling to yokozuna Hakuh≈ç in a match-up that required the governing body to forgo a normally planned match-up between san'yaku due to the threat of Ichinoj≈ç taking the championship from such a low rank. His final 13‚Äì2 record was good enough for runner-up, special prizes for Outstanding Performance and Fighting Spirit, and promotion to sekiwake for his second makuuchi and sixth overall professional tournament. He suffered somewhat from the stress of the attention that was heaped on him due to this impressive performance, entering the hospital with shingles a couple weeks before the next tournament and missing out on important training time. While not managing nearly as impressive a performance in the November tournament, he still returned a winning record to maintain his sekiwake rank for the start of 2015. A 6‚Äì9 record in January 2015 saw him relegated to the maegashira ranks but after nine wins in March, including a second career kinboshi or gold star for victory over the yokozuna Harumafuji, he was promoted to komusubi. He regained his best rank of sekiwake after a winning record in the May tournament, which included a first win over Hakuh≈ç on the opening day (he did not receive a gold star for this victory as only maegashira are eligible). He was unable to preserve his sekiwake rank in the next tournament however, scoring only 4‚Äì11 in July. Ichinoj≈ç had a less successful year in 2016 when fighting the top ranked wrestlers, scoring only two wins at maegashira 3 in January and five wins at maegashira 2 in May (although he did earn his third kinboshi in the latter tournament with another defeat of Harumafuji.) He had to withdraw from a tournament from the first time in his career in September 2016, because of lower back pain. He scored eleven wins in January 2017, but from the low rank of maegashira 13. He scored 8‚Äì7 in September at maegashira 6, but did not defeat any san'yaku ranked wrestlers. He was promoted back to the sanyaku ranks in March 2018 at komusubi, and after a 9‚Äì6 performance he returned to the sekiwake rank in May for the first time since July 2015. He held the rank for four consecutive tournaments but his results were not particularly impressive and he dropped back to the maegashira ranks after a 6-9 in November. Ichinojo began the January 2019 tournament in excellent form, defeating two yokozuna (Kakuryu and Kisenosato) and two ozeki (Goeido and Takayasu) in the first five days but performances deteriorated and he managed to post only two further wins. In the March tournament Ichinojo employed a revised set of techniques, retreating and then using his height and strength to thrust or slap down his opponents. He won his first seven matches before losing to Tochinoshin on day 8, but in contrast to his January performance he maintained his form. He won his last seven bouts including victories over Goeido and Takayasu to end the tournament with 14 wins, making him the runner- up behind Hakuho and earning him the prize for Outstanding Performance. He returned to sekiwake for the May 2019 tournament but missed Days 8 through 11 with right knee pain, finishing with a 5‚Äì7‚Äì3 record. Falling to the maegashira ranks for the July tournament, he defeated Hakuh≈ç for the third time on Day 9 to earn his eighth kinboshi. He withdrew on Day 5 of the September 2019 tournament after suffering a right shoulder injury the previous day. He missed all of the November 2019 tournament due to a related back injury, which saw him fall to j≈´ry≈ç, where he stayed until September 2020. Fighting style Ichinoj≈ç uses yotsu-sumo, or grappling techniques, rather than slapping or pushing. His preferred grip on his opponent‚Ä≤s mawashi or belt is migi-yotsu, a right hand inside, left hand outside position. His most common winning kimarite in his career to date is yori-kiri, a straightforward force out. After reaching around he became less mobile and more prone to injury. He has been troubled by back pain since 2016. After an enforced lay off with a herniated disk in September 2016 he made an effort to lose weight and fell to , the same weight at which he entered professional sumo. However his weight had increased to by September 2018. Following more back problems in November 2019, he reduced his weight again.

The film emphasised the Empire of Japan's role in Indonesia's independence, leading several writers to describe it as propaganda. It was also controversial in Indonesia owing to concerns of historical revisionism, because Japan's occupation of the area is depicted as the Empire protecting it from Western aggression. The film was a financial success in Japan. Plot In early 1942, the army of the Empire of Japan occupies the Dutch East Indies and overthrows its Dutch colonial leaders. During a visit to a Javanese village, Captain Takeo Shimazaki (Jundai Yamada) and his translator Yamana (Naomasa Musaka) are told that their arrival was predicted by King Jayabaya centuries before. Touched by this pronouncement, Shimazaki promises to free the archipelago from colonialism. Later, he is assigned to sneak into the last Dutch stronghold in Bandung and negotiate the unconditional surrender of the Dutch Army, a mission he completes successfully. With control of the archipelago assured, General Hitoshi Imamura allows the military training of the indigenous population, with promises that it will lead to Indonesian independence. Shimazaki becomes a teacher at the Seinen Dojo (\\"Youth School\\"), and his students ‚Äì including Nurhadi (Muhammad Iqbal), Asep (Aulia Achsan), and Parto (Fajar Umbara) ‚Äì are willing to fight to the death for the independence of their homeland. Although this school is dissolved after Parto beats a Japanese soldier for flirting with his sister, the three remain fiercely dedicated to fighting for independence, and they join the Defenders of the Homeland (PETA) after it is established; Shimazaki holds a leadership role. After Japan's defeat in the Pacific and subsequent surrender, Shimazaki is conflicted in his loyalties, wondering if he should go back to Japan, or stay in the newly proclaimed Republic of Indonesia and fight to defend its sovereignty. At first, he does not abandon his duties to Japan, and refuses to give PETA weapons to the Indonesian guerillas, said weapons having been earmarked for surrender to the Allies. Armed only with bambu runcing (sharpened bamboo spears), these guerillas are easily killed by the returning Dutch forces and their allies. Finally, a group of former PETA soldiers ‚Äì led by Nurhadi, Parto and Asep ‚Äì go to the Japanese headquarters to force Shimizaki to give them the weapons. After a lengthy stand-off, he agrees to surrender the weapons and to accompany the guerrillas in fighting, saying goodbye to his friend Lieutenant Miyata (Naoki Hosaka). Shimazaki is captured by Dutch forces, but saved by his fellow guerillas; many die in the effort, including Parto. In reciprocation, the Dutch capture Miyata, accuse him masterminding Shimazaki's escape, and execute him. Learning of this, Shimazaki hardens his resolve to fight for Indonesian independence. After marrying a Javanese nurse, Aryati, Shimazaki goes with several other Japanese soldiers to retake the republican capital at Yogyakarta, which had been occupied during Operation Crow. The troops, under the leadership of Shimazaki and Nurhadi, face off against better-equipped pro-Dutch troops. Shimazaki's fellow Japanese soldiers are killed during the battle, as are many Indonesian guerrillas, but the battle invigorates the nationalistic spirit of the fighters. When Shimazaki and Nurhadi return to camp, they discuss the meaning of freedom. Later, as Shimazaki goes through the tags of the fallen and mourns their loss, he is killed by a sniper. After killing the sniper, Nurhadi, Aryati, and the guerrillas bury Shimazaki while singing the Indonesian national anthem, \\"Indonesia Raya\\". Decades later, at Kalibata Heroes Cemetery in Jakarta, Miyata's daughter Fumiko lays flowers on the graves of Miyata and Shimazaki. She is accompanied by Aryati (Mila Karmila) and Nurhadi (Eman Sulaeman), and has accepted the sacrifice of her father and his comrades, remarking that they had become \\"stars for freedom\\". Production The title Merdeka 17805 is composed of the Indonesian word merdeka, which means \\"independence\\" or \\"freedom\\", and the date 17805 ‚Äì 17 August 2605, the date of the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence according to the Japanese k≈çki (ÁöáÁ¥Ä) calendar. According to promotional material for the film, that this dating convention was used on the proclamation of Indonesian Independence is evidence that the proclamators, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta, felt gratitude towards the Japanese. The material further states that Japan's role in Indonesian independence continues to be remembered. Production material further notes that approximately 2,000 Japanese soldiers remained the Indonesian archipelago to help the country fight for its independence. Similar themes had been dealt with in the 1995 video Dokuritsu Ajia no Hikari (The Light of Independent Asia), completed by the National Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the End of the War. Merdeka 17805 was directed by Fuji Yukio. Advisors to the film included former Minister of Justice Yukio Hayashida and Professor Takao Fusayama of the Tokyo Medical and Dental University, the latter of whom had military experience in Sumatra during the occupation. This Japanese-Indonesia co-production was produced by Hiroaki Fujii, Satoshi Fukushima, Subajio, and Santono, with editing completed by Akimasa Kawashima. Cinematography was handled by Kenji Takama and music was provided by Ryoichi Kuniyoshi. Merdeka 17805 starred Jundai Yamada, Lola Amaria, Naoki Hosaka, Muhammad Iqbal, Aulia Achsan, Fajar Umbara, and Koji Tsukamoto. This 122-minute film contains Japanese- and Indonesian-language dialog. Shooting for Merdeka 17805 was completed mostly in Indonesia, over an extended period of time. The film's music, Goto Ken'ichi opines, was \\"subtle and moving\\", and together with the film's \\"powerful visual images\\" creates a form of propaganda. He suggests that Merdeka 17805 was intended to restore Japanese pride by depicting the country's role in Indonesia's ‚Äì and, by association, South East Asia's ‚Äì independence from Western rule. Jonathan Crow of AllMovie echoed the sentiment, describing Merdeka 17805 as a \\"two-fisted, hinomaru-waving, blood- and-guts ode to the soldiers who died for the glory of the emperor and for Dai Nippon\\". Release and reception Merdeka 17805 was released on 12 May 2001 in Japan and distributed by Toho. It was financially successful in Japan. Some Indonesians took issue with depictions of an old woman kissing Shimazaki's feet, as well as scenes in which Indonesian trainees were slapped across the face by Japanese trainers. An article in Tempo argued that the film overplayed the Japanese role in Indonesia's national revolution. Goto writes that, lacking proper background knowledge of the Japanese occupation, audiences were likely to \\"carry away an unduly favorable impression of Japan's contribution to Indonesian independence\\". A Special Edition DVD version of the film was released by Happinet Pictures on 25 January 2002.

An important goal of evaluation is to provide recommendations and lessons to the project managers and implementation teams that have worked on the projects and for the ones that will implement and work on similar projects. Evaluations are also indirectly a means to report to the donor about the activities implemented. It is a means to verify that the donated funds are being well managed and transparently spent. The evaluators are supposed to check and analyse the budget lines and to report the findings in their work.Center for Global Development. US Spending in Haiti: The Need for Greater Transparency and Accountability. http://www.cgdev.org/doc/full_text/CGDBriefs/1426965/US-Spending-in-Haiti-The- Need-for-Greater-Transparency-and-Accountability.html Monitoring and Evaluation is also useful in the Facilities [Hospitals], it enables the donors such as WHO,UNICEF to know whether the funds provided are well utilised in purchasing drugs and also equipments in the Hospitals. Monitor Monitoring is a continuous assessment that aims at providing all stakeholders with early detailed information on the progress or delay of the ongoing assessed activities. It is an oversight of the activity's implementation stage. Its purpose is to determine if the outputs, deliveries and schedules planned have been reached so that action can be taken to correct the deficiencies as quickly as possible. Good planning, combined with effective monitoring and evaluation, can play a major role in enhancing the effectiveness of development programs and projects. Good planning helps focus on the results that matter, while monitoring and evaluation help us learn from past successes and challenges and inform decision making so that current and future initiatives are better able to improve people's lives and expand their choices.http://web.undp.org/evaluation/handbook/documents/english/pme- handbook.pdf Differences between monitoring and evaluation In monitoring, the feedback and recommendation is inevitable to the project manager but in evaluation, this is not the case. The common ground for monitoring and evaluation is that they are both management tools. For monitoring, data and information collection for tracking progress according to the terms of reference is gathered periodically which is not the case in evaluations for which the data and information collection is happening during or in view of the evaluation. The monitoring is a short term assessment and does not take into consideration the outcomes and impact unlike the evaluation process which also assesses the outcomes and sometime longer term impact. This impact assessment occurs sometimes after the end of a project, even though it is rare because of its cost and of the difficulty to determine whether the project is responsible for the observed results. Evaluation is a systematic and objective examination which is conducted on monthly and/or yearly basis, unlike Monitoring, which is a continuous assessment, providing stakeholders with early information. Monitoring checks on all the activities on the last [implementation stage] unlike Evaluation which entails information on whether the donated funds are well managed and that they are transparently spent. Importance Although evaluations are often retrospective, their purpose is essentially forward looking. Evaluation applies the lessons and recommendations to decisions about current and future programmes. Evaluations can also be used to promote new projects, get support from governments, raise funds from public or private institutions and inform the general public on the different activities. It is also very important as monitoring team give the recommendation to the school visited (e.g. K.H.S and G.S.G). The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in February 2005 and the follow-up meeting in Accra underlined the importance of the evaluation process and of the ownership of its conduct by the projects' hosting countries. Many developing countries now have M&E; systems and the tendency is growing. Performance measurement The credibility of findings and assessments depends to a large extent on the manner in which monitoring and evaluation is conducted. To assess performance, it is necessary to select, before the implementation of the project, indicators which will permit to rate the targeted outputs and outcomes. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), an outcome indicator has two components: the baseline which is the situation before the programme or project begins, and the target which is the expected situation at the end of the project. An output indicator that does not have any baseline as the purpose of the output is to introduce something that does not exist yet.United Nations Development Programme evaluation office - Handbook on Monitoring and Evaluating for Results. Prince Conway II; a M&E; specialist from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare was one of the those who achieved greatly in the health sector moving the Malaria data from 60% below base line to 85% above target. http://web.undp.org/evaluation/documents/handbook/me-handbook.pdf In the United Nations The most important agencies of the United Nations have a monitoring and evaluation unit. All these agencies are supposed to follow the common standards of the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG). These norms concern the Institutional framework and management of the evaluation function, the competencies and ethics, and the way to conduct evaluations and present reports (design, process, team selection, implementation, reporting and follow up). This group also provides guidelines and relevant documentation to all evaluation organs being part of the United Nations or not.United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG). Most agencies implementing projects and programmes, even if following the common UNEG standards, have their own handbook and guidelines on how to conduct M&E.; Indeed, the UN agencies have different specialisations and have different needs and ways of approaching M&E.; The M&E; branches of every UN agency are monitored and rated by the Joint Inspection Unit of the United Nations.United Nations Joint Inspection Unit. https://www.unjiu.org/ See also *Evaluation *MEASURE Evaluation References Category:Evaluation ","title":"Monitoring and evaluation"},{"id":"42876935","text":"Kane Jenkins is a fictional character on the New Zealand soap opera Shortland Street. He was portrayed by KJ Apa from late-2013 to mid-2015. The character was introduced as part of the extended Cooper family unit and as a means to depict youth-suicide. Creation and casting Often known to depict topical and ethical issues of the day, in 2013 Shortland Street producers decided to undergo a storyline that would reflect the high rates of youth suicide in New Zealand. They wrote the role of Kane, the teenage brother of Dayna Jenkins. Reuben Milner auditioned for the role but was instead cast as Kane's best friend Jack. With no prior acting experience, KJ Apa won the role. He had organised an audition through his modelling agency and within weeks had begun filming. Kane debuted on screen on 11 December 2013. Whilst filming the show, Apa also studied at Kings College. Apa had to quit high school rugby to act in the show but was allowed travel between school and the set as part of his contract. In May 2015 speculation arose that Kane would be departing the show when Apa was spotted in Los Angeles. Apa had previously stated he would \\"wait and see\\" how long he stayed on the show. The rumours proved to be true with Apa quitting the role after 18 months. Kane made his last appearance on screen on 6 July 2015. Apa was rumoured to return for the show's 25th anniversary in 2017. Storylines Kane arrived to visit his brain dead mother, Jennifer before her life support was turned off. During his visit Kane stayed with the Cooper family, Wendy (Jacqueline Nairn) and Murray (Matthew Chamberlain) and in the new year, agreed to be fostered by them. He began to date Honour Aleni (Sophie McIntosh) and accepted a rugby scholarship to a prestigious private school, only to lose this and get suspended when Murray Cooper (Matthew Chamberlain) became over invested in his schoolwork and started doing it himself. Kane and Honour broke up and after having his life saved by his best friend Toby (Robert Evison), helped him cover up the murder of Brett Franklin (Matt Dwyer). The revelation of the murder saw Kane facing serious charges of covering the crime up which was followed by an injury to his leg, leaving him out of rugby season. Depressed and alone he began to rely on his best friend Jack (Reuben Milner). However Jack mistook this for romance and made a move on Kane, leading to the two falling out and Kane subsequently being bullied when his school friends believed he was gay. Declining help from his family, Kane decided to commit suicide and attempted to gas himself in the Cooper family car. He was rescued however by his family and finally accepted help for his depression, ultimately reconciling with Jack and returning to rugby. The charges against Kane for his part in Brett's murder were ultimately dropped. Kane was pleased when his father Jimmy (Joel Tobeck) arrived in town and began spending time with him. However it soon appeared as though he was using Kane to store dodgy money for him. However it shockingly turned out he was dating Kane's foster sister Bella (Amelia Reid-Meredith) and impregnanted her. Kane began to excel in rugby and was offered a rugby scholarship to a national rugby academy. However he began to sleep with his PE teacher Ms. Herve (Jazmyne Van Gosliga), putting this at risk. Jimmy and Murray managed to scare Ms. Herve off much to Kane's annoyance but he ultimately decided to pursue the rugby scholarship. Kane departed to Palmerston North to finish his final 2 years of school and play rugby. Before Wendy's life support machine was turned off, she was seen listening to Kane saying his farewell on the phone. Character development =Ed Sheeran= In 2014 Shortland Street producers were contacted by internationally acclaimed singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran to ask whether he could have a part in the show as he had seen it, and enjoyed it. The scene was written surrounding the character of Kane who was to be helped by Ed whilst in the middle of a personal crisis. Apa did not consider himself an Ed Sheeran fan but was still \\"nervous\\" acting alongside him. He believed he was the most \\"high-up\\" there celebrity Shortland Street had managed to secure on the show. Kane came out of the scene better off Apa believed, \\"In a previous storyline Kane, Honour and Toby had written a song for a fundraiser. Kane just started playing that and he sort of, well he didn't teach Ed Sheeran how to play, but Ed just started playing it and was giving him tips on how to sing ... Kane is starstruck as well, just as anyone would be. It cheers him up. It does what Ed is trying to do. The song was written especially for the scene by the show's composer Graham Bollard. =Teenage suicide= Shortland Street primarily focuses on drama and romance based storylines but occasionally covers topical storylines and specifically \\"medical storylines that resonate with the community.\\" Storyliners became aware of shocking statistics of youth suicide within New Zealand and it was a topic that producer Simon Bennett \\"cared deeply about\\". The decision was made to create the character of Kane, a teenager that throughout the course of an 18-month period would decide to take his own life. With such a sensitive subject matter, storyliners consulted the Mental Health foundation routinely throughout the plot line to ensure they were correctly portraying the decline into depression and the steps of suicide. The storyline saw Kane under immense pressure after a leg injury removed him from his sporting ambitions and his best friend Jack (Reuben Milner) came out of the closet to him leading to estrangement. Kane also became the victim of online bullying. The storyline progressed over several months with the decline into depression slowly coming across through character development and the manner in which Apa portrayed Kane. With consideration from mental health experts, it was decided to publicly announce the storyline was to occur so as to warn viewers of the intensity of the episode. A message was also screened prior to the airing and online, alerting viewers how to address the issue if suffering themselves. So as to avoid copycat style incidents, the actual suicide attempt was not screened but rather alluded to. This involved Kane's foster family finding him unconscious after gassing himself in the family car. Apa was pleased to work on the storyline believing it was the \\"hardest\\" thing he had to do but he was proud he, \\"got to be involved with something that could be beneficial to New Zealand. I‚Äôve had some big storylines this year, but I‚Äôm loving it.\\" Cast and crew members were trained with the aftermath of the episode and how to deal with affected viewers, family, and friends. In addition to this, higher levels of staff moderating the soap opera's social media accounts were hired to watch for distressed viewers. The Mental Health foundation were pleased with the manner to which the storyliners decided to take the storyline with Kane surviving and his route to recovery being witnessed. Kane ultimately ended up accepting the help of his family and slowly recovered from his attempt and his depression. Dialogue was included within scripts concerning recovery, with suggestions of healthy nutrition, exercise, and communication being written in. Reception Kane was frequently referred to by media as a \\"heart throb\\". Apa was reportedly used to fans \\"swooning, whispering, and pointing\\" at him on the streets. The portrayal of the suicide storyline was applauded due to its sensitivity and \\"confrontational\\" nature. Some viewers online expressed shock and annoyance at the level of detail to which the suicide was outlined, despite the purposeful attempts to reduce exposure to the actual attempt by producers. The New Zealand Herald columnist Robyn Yousef highly praised the storyline and the portrayal by Apa. She believed it was sensitively carried out and accurately acted. Ultimately she concluded that the storyline would have helped educate New Zealand families and may even have saved young peoples lives. Shortland Street was lauded following the COVID-19 lockdown as an accurate reflection of New Zealand life, with storylines such as Kane's suicide attempt enabling difficult conversations within society. In 2017 stuff.co.nz journalist Fleur Mealing named Kane as the 6th character she most wanted to return for the show's 25th anniversary, citing the need for \\"young blood\\" on the show.

This argues that sport has a number of benefits, including bringing people together, improving national pride and unity, and improving health. The policy identifies challenges to the development of sport in the country, including limited infrastructure and financial capacity. It sets the \\"inspirational target\\" that, by 2020, Rwanda should have \\"a higher percentage of population playing sport than in any other African nation\\" and be ranked amongst the top three African countries in basketball, volleyball, cycling, athletics and Paralympic sports, and the top ten in football. It also aims to \\"foster increased participation of people in traditional sports\\". According to research published by the University of the Western Cape's Interdisciplinary Centre of Excellence for Sport Science and Development, the most popular sports in Rwanda are association football, volleyball, basketball, athletics and Paralympic sports.  Overview  Rwanda's first appearance at the Olympic Games was in 1984, and its first appearance at the Paralympic Games in 2004. The country sent seven competitors to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, representing it in athletics, swimming, mountain biking and judo, and 15 competitors to the London Summer Paralympics to compete in athletics, powerlifting and sitting volleyball. Rwanda competed in the Commonwealth Games for the first time at the 2010 Games in Delhi, India, after joining the Commonwealth the year before. Rwandan competitors took part in athletics, boxing, road cycling and swimming. Rwanda sent athletes to the 2014 Games to compete in athletics, boxing, cycling, swimming and weightlifting. Rwanda's team at the 2014 African Youth Games had the highest proportion of female athletes (29 out of a total of 49 athletes) of any participating country. Rwanda's basketball federation has been a member of the International Basketball Federation since 1977. Prior to 2000, the Rwanda national basketball team was little known outside the country, but since the mid-2000s has grown in prominence on the African stage. The men's team have qualified for the final stages of the African Basketball Championship four times in a row since 2007. The country bid to host the 2013 African Basketball Championship, but the right to host the tournament was awarded to Ivory Coast instead. Association football in Rwanda is governed by the Rwandese Association Football Federation (FERWAFA), which was established in 1972 and admitted to FIFA in 1978. FERWAFA is also affiliated to the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (CECAFA). Its national team made its African Cup of Nations debut in the 2004 edition of the tournament. A Rwanda B team won the CECAFA Cup in 1999, when the country hosted the tournament. The CECAFA Club Cup has been known as the Kagame Interclub Cup since 2002, when Rwandan President Kagame started to sponsor the competition. The national team is yet to qualify for the World Cup. Rwanda's highest domestic football competition is the Rwanda National Football League. Cricket has been described as one of the fastest growing sports in Rwanda. The sport started to gain popularity in the country as refugees returned from Kenya, where they had learned to play the game. The Rwanda Cricket Association (RCA) was established in 1999 and recognised by the International Cricket Council in 2003. Development of the sport in the country has been supported by the UK-based charity Cricket Without Boundaries, which aims to improve HIV/AIDS awareness through the game, and by the Marylebone Cricket Club Foundation. The latter is backing a project to construct a national cricket field on the outskirts of Kigali. Rwanda's membership of the Commonwealth has been credited with helping popularise cricket in the country, with both men and women playing it in orphanages, schools, universities and cricket clubs. Adrien Niyonshuti, \\"one of the most famous people in Rwanda\\", competing in the cross-country mountain biking event at the 2012 Summer Olympics Cycling has traditionally been seen largely as a mode of transport in Rwanda, but in recent times there has been a growth in cycle sport in the country. Mountain biker and road cyclist Adrien Niyonshuti became the first Rwandan to sign a professional contract with an international cycling team, joining MTN Qhubeka in 2009. A national cycling team, Team Rwanda, was established in 2007 by Americans Jock Boyer, a former professional cyclist, and Tom Ritchey, a bicycle entrepreneur. Team Rwanda have been the subject of a book, Land of Second Chances: The Impossible Rise of Rwanda's Cycling Team and a film, Rising from Ashes. The Tour of Rwanda was first held in 1988. Prior to 2009, it was contested mainly by local riders and cyclists from neighbouring countries, but in late 2008 it was sanctioned by the Union Cycliste Internationale and since 2009 has been included in the UCI Africa Tour. Sport is seen by some as a means of achieving post-conflict reconciliation in Rwanda, and a number of organisations are involved in using sport to promote reconciliation. The country's Sports Development Policy includes amongst its aims promotion of \\"the use of sports as strong avenue for development and peace building\\", and the government has made commitments to advancing the use of sport for a variety of other development objectives, including education.

Built in 1881, it is the best-preserved 19th-century Quaker meeting house in the county. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986, at which time it was the only active Quaker meeting house in Carroll County. Description and history The North Sandwich Meeting House is located in a rural area of northeastern Sandwich, at the northwest corner of Quaker-Whiteface and Brown Hill Roads. It is a single- story wood frame building, with a gable roof and simple pilastered cornerboards. The interior consists of a vestibule area, which leads into the main hall and has stairs leading up to a balcony. The only significant exterior changes are the addition of a bulletin board, and the granite front steps and platform, which appear to date to the 1920s. Interior changes are also modest: two pews have been removed, one to provide space for an organ, and another for a more modern heating system. The auditorium was also carpeted at some point. The Sandwich Society of Friends (i.e. Quakers) was organized in 1783. In 1802, this society was made a monthly meeting, with separate meetings for southern and northern Sandwich. The first meetinghouse for the north meeting was built on this site in 1814. Both congregations declined in the mid-19th century, with the southern one disbanding in 1884. The north meeting was revitalized in 1876, and the present building was built to replace the deteriorating first building. Unlike the two other surviving Quaker meeting houses in the county, it is very little changed.

Since 1658 it is continuously operated and owned by the R√∂hrl family. In November 2010 the Guinness Book of Records introduced the restaurant as the oldest continuously operated restaurant in the world, conducting business for more than three and half centuries.\\"R√∂hrl\\" ist das √§lteste Wirtshaus der Welt (German), accessed on 27 May 2014  Location and property  Festival hall (\\"Festsaal\\"), western side The restaurant is located on the western edge of Eilsbrunn, opposite the parish church of St. Wolfgang. The oldest part of the restaurant, the main building is a two-storey building with garett hip roof and the taproom behind segmental arch windows on the ground floor. This component was built before 1800, maybe early as 1665 as the inscription MDCLXV suggests. Approximately 50 guests can be accommodated; the decor is simple and largely obtained in the first half of the 20th century according to their time of origin. Above the entrance stands a large dormer with a pulley from the roof. A two-storey gabled roof construction from 1839 connects to the main building. In the early 20th century another saddleback roof building for a festival hall with space for 250 guests was erected; the Art Nouveau door at the entrance to the old building was originally part of this component. The beer garden hosts further 400 guests. The property is under conservation.  History  The restaurant is operated in the eleventh generation by members of the family R√∂hrl. In 1658 the family got the restaurant by marriage of Andreas R√∂hrl (app. 1636‚Äì1706) with Susanna Hofmeister, the innkeeper Georg Hofmeister's daughter. R√∂hrl was henceforth brewer and landlord of Eilsbrunn. Married twice he left the business to his son Joachim (1676‚Äì1737). The year MDCLXV on the entrance facade suggests that a conversion or new construction of the property was done in 1665. After the death of the fifth R√∂hrl male in a row, his widow took over the business. In 1839 she reconstructed the building and set up an extension. She later bequeathed the property to her youngest son. A picture in the guest room shows her grandson and successor to her son Johann Nepomuk R√∂hrl. The opening of the nearby railroad made the area a popular tourist destination for visitors even from other parts of Germany, so that a large festival hall and guest rooms (now discontinued) were erected. After the death of another Johann Nepomuk R√∂hrl, taking over the inn after World War II, the daughter Antonie Kolbe took over the Gastst√§tte R√∂hrl. In 1971 the brewery was shut down. Since 2006 the inn is directed by her nephew Muk R√∂hrl, a skilled cook and businessman. Today the beer sold in the restaurant is mainly produced by the R√∂hrl brewery in Straubing. This brewery was founded by Josef R√∂hrl, the first Johann Nepomuk's brother, in 1881.  Literature  * Karl Gattinger: Der R√∂hrlwirt in Eilsbrunn.

In 1996, the house‚Äîalong with a complex of five surrounding outbuildings and approximately of field, pasture and woodland‚Äîwas listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its significance in art, architecture, and local agriculture. It now operates under the auspices of the Remick Country Doctor Museum & Farm.  History of ownership  The early history of the home is approximate, as records are sparse. In 1779, a shipwright and resident of Newmarket, New Hampshire, named Enoch Remick (1730-1800) purchased of land in Tamworth from David Chapman, also of Newmarket. Enoch's fourth son, John Remick (1763-1849), a shipwright and joiner, purchased of this plot from his father in 1794 and another 50 acres from his sisters in 1805. Neither transaction mentions any existing buildings on the property at the time it was purchased. It is plausible‚Äîand generally theorized‚Äîthat John, a skilled carpenter, was responsible for building the original portion of the home circa 1808. John Remick sold his homestead to Samuel Edgel in 1812, who in turn sold it to William Edgel in 1816. Sometime in the 1820s, the property was transferred to Captain Enoch Remick (1798-1897) (John Remick's son and the house's namesake) and his wife Lucinda Edgel Remick (1795-1879) (William Edgel's daughter or sister). Captain Enoch Remick was a prominent local citizen who served as state representative (1830-31) and selectman (1832). From roughly the 1830s to 1850s, the third floor of the home served as the site of town meetings, before Tamworth had a designated town hall. Captain Enoch also ran an inn out of the house for about three decades, and the house served as a stopover point for horses traveling on the Center Harbor-Conway stagecoach route. In 1867 Enoch Remick sold his homestead to Nathaniel Hubbard, Jr. (1820-1892). Hubbard would go on to marry Captain Enoch's daughter, Sarah Edgell Remick (1820-1904), the following year. Nathaniel and Sarah lived in the home for more than two decades, and by 1880 their farm was the third largest and most valuable in town. After Nathaniel's death in 1892, Sarah remained in the family home until her death twelve years later. Having no children, Sarah left her property to be divided among her three nephews. One of these, Dr. Edwin Remick (1866-1935), bought out his brothers' shares, taking full title to the house and its accompanying land in 1904. Dr. Remick moved into the home with his wife, Emily Alice Crafts (1861-1911), and infant son, Edwin Crafts Remick (1903-1993). The family lived on the second floor of the home while Dr. Remick, the country doctor for the community in and around Tamworth, ran a medical practice out of the home's first floor. In 1929, his son Edwin Crafts Remick‚Äîby now a doctor himself‚Äîjoined the practice. Edwin Remick Sr. lived in the home until his death in 1935. His son, Edwin Crafts Remick, lived in a nearby farmhouse and continued to operate the medical practice and farm‚Äîincluding Hillsdale Dairy, the first pasteurization facility north of Rochester‚Äîuntil he died in 1993. Edwin Crafts and his wife Marion Ella Miles (1906-1980) had no children. Before his death, Dr. E.C. Remick established the Edwin C. Remick Foundation to continue operating his farm and preserve the historic homestead as a museum.  Architectural and artistic significance  The Captain Enoch Remick House reflects three major building campaigns. It was built circa 1808 in the Federal style and enlarged/renovated circa 1830 and again circa 1850. Architectural details reflect the three periods of major construction and include Federal and Greek Revival doors (many of which are grain-painted); Federal and Greek Revival window and door casings; Federal, Greek Revival, and Italianate (marble) fireplace surrounds; a Federal staircase at the front of the house; and a turned staircase likely dating from the 1870s or 1880s at the west entrance. Tin ceilings, which were probably installed in the late nineteenth century, are found in several of the rooms. Above the home's south entrance is a Palladian window (probably dating to 1808) of somewhat unusual appearance in that each of the sections is topped by a louvered arch. As it now stands, the house is a south-facing, 2¬Ω-story, woodframe, \\"L\\"-plan building with an offset 1¬Ω-story rear addition. One of the home's most significant interior features is the presence of several wall murals believed to have been painted by the New Hampshire itinerant artist John Avery (1790-1871). While these murals are unsigned, several of their visual elements (\\"lumpy\\" hills; trees grouped and placed over doorways; bunches of grapes; \\"wave-like\\" rows of shrubs; delicate curlicues) are characteristic of Avery's work. A stagecoach motif appears on a wall in the Remick doctors' pharmacy room and may have been painted as a reference to the home's historic use as a stagecoach stopover. Remick Country Doctor Museum & Farm 20th-century period country doctor's office The Captain Enoch Remick House is now operated by the Remick Country Doctor Museum & Farm, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit institution operated by the Edwin C. Remick Foundation that interprets medical history, New England agricultural history, and the rural lifestyle of the country doctor via exhibits, demonstrations, and public programs. The museum complex includes a museum center (located inside a historic connected farmhouse that includes a historic English barn and was previously occupied by Edwin Crafts and Marion Remick and their farmhands); cattle barn; milk house; maple sugar house; ice house; and stable. In addition to a museum, the site operates as a working farm, with chickens, pigs, sheep, goats, beef and dairy cows on-site and assorted hay fields in and around Tamworth. The interior of the Captain Enoch Remick House has been preserved largely in a late 19th century style and is available to museum visitors for tours. Highlights include the Remick doctors' pharmacy and medical office, a screened-in sleeping porch, and the elder Dr. Remick's second-floor living quarters.

After his playing career ended, he took up coaching. As well as coaching amateur clubs in England, he was manager of Greek club AEK for three years. Personal life Beby was born in Gillingham, Kent, in 1907. As a youngster, he played football for local team Cuxton, and was on the books of Charlton Athletic, before enlisting in the Grenadier Guards. Apart from his military duties, Beby represented his regiment in the shot put, and played cricket, primarily as a bowler, for his regiment and for the Household Brigade. By early 1931, Beby was married with a child. He died in Chatham, Kent, in 1976 at the age of 68. Playing career Beby returned to football with Third Division South club Gillingham in 1929. He made his debut in the Third Division South on 26 December 1929, against Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic, and the following April, after he had played just 20 league games, First Division club Leicester City paid a \\"substantial\\" transfer fee for his services. Beby began his Leicester career in their reserve team, but impressed when he came into the first team at the start of the new season. Against Birmingham, \\"it was only the fine work of Beby, the Leicester reserve goalkeeper, that kept them from making a draw, if not, indeed, even forcing a win\\", and at Manchester City, \\"it may be conceded that perhaps never again during the season will so many remarkable saves be made in one afternoon as were brought off by this reserve keeper\\", and when \\"a merciless assault was sustained on the Leicester goal. With the crowd behind him roaring and swaying like human breakers, one saw Beby leaping up, fisting out, diving down, most amazingly keeping the ball out of the net, most cleverly getting it away when surrounded by blue shirts.\\" Despite such a successful start to his Leicester career, he asked for a transfer after less than a year with the club; according to the Daily Express, \\"Beby [said] the Leicester air [did] not suit himself, his wife or his child\\". He remained a Leicester player until the 1932 close season, perhaps because the asking price was too high; in August, in response to an application by the player, the Football League reduced the fee, and Beby left the club. After a few weeks playing for Kent-based club Ashford Town, Beeby returned to the Football League in October with Bristol Rovers. After one season and 24 league matches, he moved on to Crystal Palace, also of the Third Division South. His only senior game for that club came in the Southern Section Cup. Palace were drawn to play away to Exeter City on 24 January 1934, but were due to face Arsenal in the fourth round of the FA Cup three days later. While the first team had a week's training at Brighton in preparation for their FA Cup tie, Palace fielded their reserve team at Exeter, as was permitted by the competition rules, and lost by the unusual score of eleven goals to six. In March, after less than a year with Palace, Beby joined Third Division North club Darlington. He spent just short of two years at Darlington, playing regular first-team football, before finishing the 1935‚Äì36 season, and his Football League career, with Exeter City. His playing career wound down in non-league football with Ashington, Vickers Aviation and Shorts Sports. Coaching career From 1948 to 1951, Beby was manager of Greek club AEK. During his tenure he attempted to impose an element of professionalism on the team's approach to its work. He introduced shirt numbering, which had not previously been used in Greece, and set the team up to play in the WM formation, the system then generally used in Britain. He led the team to consecutive victories in the Greek Cup, in 1949 and 1950, before leaving the club suddenly in 1951.Makridis, Œó ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒëEŒö, p. 60. He later told the Daily Express that AEK provided him with a furnished house and paid him ¬£31 a week tax free. In August 1951, he was appointed coach of amateur club Ilford, then playing in the Isthmian League; he was the first professional to hold the position. By the start of the 1954‚Äì55 season, he was working as trainer and coach of Faversham Town; it was reported that \\"although his time at Salters Lane was relatively short, it was noted there were already signs of better football.\\" References External links * Leicester City statistics at foxestalk.co.uk Category:1907 births Category:1976 deaths Category:People from Gillingham, Kent Category:English footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Charlton Athletic F.C. players Category:Gillingham F.C. players Category:Leicester City F.C. players Category:Ashford United F.C. players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players Category:Crystal Palace F.C. players Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:Exeter City F.C. players Category:Ashington A.F.C. players Category:Shorts Sports F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:English football managers Category:AEK Athens F.C. managers Category:British expatriates in Greece Category:Grenadier Guards soldiers ","title":"Jack Beby"},{"id":"42877192","text":"The Queen's Birthday Honours 2014 were announced on 9 June 2014 by the Governor-General of Australia, Sir Peter Cosgrove.

It is located in the White Mountain National Forest, and is operated as a museum by the United States Forest Service. Built about 1831, it is the only surviving early homestead in the Swift River valley. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history The Russell-Colbath House stands on the north side of the Kancamagus Highway, between the Jigger Johnson Campground and Oliverian Brook Road. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It has a symmetrical five-bay facade, with a center entrance flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters, and topped by a simple peaked entablature. The interior follows a center-chimney plan, with a small entrance vestibule, parlor spaces flanking the chimney, and a bedroom behind the chimney. A narrow space in the northeast corner includes both a kitchen space and stairs to bedrooms in the upper level. The house was built in 1831-32 by Thomas and Amzi Russell, and is the only surviving 19th-century homestead in the Swift River valley. The Russells were among the early permanent settlers, arriving in the 1820s (failed settlements took place in 1805 and 1815). The Russell operated a sawmill on Oliverian Brook, and were part of a small farming and logging community in the immediate area, which constituted the best farmland in the valley. The house was owned by Russell descendants until 1930, after which it was used for a time as a summer residence. It was acquired by the Forest Service in 1961, which uses it as a museum and information center.

The entrance to Grove Walk on Merton Street next to the tower of Merton College Chapel. Grove Walk (aka Merton Grove and Grove Passage) is a short historic leafy walkway running north‚Äìsouth in central Oxford, England, situated on land between Merton College to the east and Corpus Christi College to the west. It provides one of the entrances to Christ Church Meadow from the north. To the north, Grove Walk connects with Merton Street through a gateway surrounded by railings. On the other side of Merton Street, the route continues as the narrow medieval Magpie Lane. To the south it passes through what used to be the city wall and leads to Dead Man's Walk on Merton Field. Beyond that via Merton Walk to the wide Broad Walk is the main part of Christ Church Meadow. In 1701, Corpus Christi College attempted to acquire some of this strip of land, but this was resisted. To the south, the first hot air balloon ascent in Britain was made by James Sadler (1753‚Äì1828), when he ascended from Merton Field on 4 October 1783, landing northeast of Oxford in Woodeaton. An 1864 block separates Grove Walk from the Back Quad at Merton College. By the late 19th century, Magpie Lane to the north was known as \\"Grove Street\\", but in 1927 the name was changed back to Magpie Lane. The building in the south-western corner of Merton College is also called Grove. The name perhaps derives because this area used to be an orchard.

Biography  Mundiya's full name is Ukuma Mundiya Kepanga. He was born in the mid-sixties in the heart of the Highlands in Papua New Guinea, in a small hut built specially for his birth at Anda Mini in the Telabo region. He belongs to the Telabo Angi Puria clan, part of the Huli tribe, whose members live mainly in the Tari region in the centre of the Hela province. He leads a simple and traditional life, earning his living from sweet potato crops and pig farming. As all young Huli men, when he was a teenager, he let his hair grow to make a manda, a ritual wig worn for the ritual initiation ceremony. Since then, he became adept at making and collecting adornments and feathers and joined his community's traditional dance group sing-Sing. In September 2001, Mundiya met the French photographer and filmmaker Marc Dozier,Marc Dozier web site specialist of Papua New Guinea and travelled with him as his guide for several weeks. This meeting is recounted in an article published in the French travel magazine Grands Reportages Dans la maison des hommes.Grands Reportages Magazine, N¬∞240, January 2002 In 2003, Mundiya and his cousin Polobi Palia left their country for the first time, invited by Marc Dozier to discover France. The trip quickly took on an unexpected dimension, and the enthusiasm raised by their presence, coupled with their colourful comments led to the publication of a book, Le long-long voyage by Dakota publishing.Le long-long voyage, Dakota publishing, 195 pages, 2007, . Late 2006 ‚Äì early 2007, Mundiya and his cousin Polobi were invited a second time to France, and this trip led to the making of a 100-minute documentary The reversed exploration (film by Jean-Marie Barr√®re and Marc Dozier ‚Äì Bonne Pioche Production).Bonne Pioche Production web site The film shows Mundiya and Polobi travelling through France and making comments on the French way of life, in the style of the Persian Letters by Montesquieu. Broadcast for the first time on the French TV channel Canal+ on 8 January 2008, the film was relatively successful and was later broadcast by numerous other French and international TV channels like National Geographic. Between 2008 and 2015, Mundiya returned to Europe several times and gave numerous conferences in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg and United States... Through these lectures, he fosters a new outlook towards all people of the world, in a spirit of tolerance and respect. In 2012, with the help of his French friend Marc Dozier acting as his translator, Mundiya published his autobiography Au pays des hommes blancs, les m√©moires d'un Papou en Occident (Niugini)Au Pays des hommes blancs, Niugini publishing, 188 pages, 2012, . providing a fresh outlook on our Western world, packed with his characteristic sense of humour and wisdom: ¬´It is you, the white men, who invented books‚Ä¶ However, even though I cannot read or write, I still have a lot to say about your eccentric tribe!¬ª. In 2012, when he heard that a Maori skull was being restituted to New-Zealand indigenous communities by Sebastian Minchin, director of the Natural History Museum in Rouen, France,Maories' skull restitution Maories' skull restitution Mundiya Kepanga decided to offer a full set of traditional Huli adornments to the same museum. During the official handing-over ceremony on 20 April 2012, he declared: \\"I am very proud to give you my own adornments. I know you will take good care of them. After my death, your children and grandchildren will be able to admire them and understand what they mean to my tribe. This gift is a bridge between our two worlds.\\" The adornments, called Djeri in Huli, are currently on the third floor of the Natural History Museum in Rouen, in a display cabinet in the Australasia section. In 2015, he was invited to participate as a traditional leader in several conferences organized during the COP21 summit on climate change.

Mathematics was developed by the Ancient Civilizations for intellectual challenge and pleasure. Surprisingly, many of their discoveries later played prominent roles in physical theories, as in the case of the conic sections in celestial mechanics. The relationship between mathematics and physics has been a subject of study of philosophers, mathematicians and physicists since Antiquity, and more recently also by historians and educators. Generally considered a relationship of great intimacy, mathematics has been described as \\"an essential tool for physics\\" and physics has been described as \\"a rich source of inspiration and insight in mathematics\\". In his work Physics, one of the topics treated by Aristotle is about how the study carried out by mathematicians differs from that carried out by physicists. Considerations about mathematics being the language of nature can be found in the ideas of the Pythagoreans: the convictions that \\"Numbers rule the world\\" and \\"All is number\\", and two millennia later were also expressed by Galileo Galilei: \\"The book of nature is written in the language of mathematics\\".Kyle Forinash, William Rumsey, Chris Lang, Galileo's Mathematical Language of Nature. Before giving a mathematical proof for the formula for the volume of a sphere, Archimedes used physical reasoning to discover the solution (imagining the balancing of bodies on a scale). From the seventeenth century, many of the most important advances in mathematics appeared motivated by the study of physics, and this continued in the following centuries (although in the nineteenth century mathematics started to become increasingly independent from physics).E. J. Post, A History of Physics as an Exercise in Philosophy, p. 76.Arkady Plotnitsky, Niels Bohr and Complementarity: An Introduction, p. 177. The creation and development of calculus were strongly linked to the needs of physics: There was a need for a new mathematical language to deal with the new dynamics that had arisen from the work of scholars such as Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton.Eoin P. O'Neill (editor), What Did You Do Today, Professor?: Fifteen Illuminating Responses from Trinity College Dublin, p. 62. During this period there was little distinction between physics and mathematics; as an example, Newton regarded geometry as a branch of mechanics. As time progressed, increasingly sophisticated mathematics started to be used in physics. The current situation is that the mathematical knowledge used in physics is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as in the case of superstring theory.  Philosophical problems  Some of the problems considered in the philosophy of mathematics are the following: *Explain the effectiveness of mathematics in the study of the physical world: \\"At this point an enigma presents itself which in all ages has agitated inquiring minds. How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?\\" ‚ÄîAlbert Einstein, in Geometry and Experience (1921).Albert Einstein, Geometry and Experience. *Clearly delineate mathematics and physics: For some results or discoveries, it is difficult to say to which area they belong: to the mathematics or to physics.Pierre Berg√©, Des rythmes au chaos. *What is the geometry of physical space? *What is the origin of the axioms of mathematics? *How does the already existing mathematics influence in the creation and development of physical theories? *Is arithmetic analytic or synthetic? (from Kant, see Analytic‚Äìsynthetic distinction) *What is essentially different between doing a physical experiment to see the result and making a mathematical calculation to see the result? (from the Turing‚ÄìWittgenstein debate) *Do G√∂del's incompleteness theorems imply that physical theories will always be incomplete? (from Stephen Hawking)Stephen Hawking. \\"Godel and the End of the Universe\\" *Is mathematics invented or discovered? (millennia-old question, raised among others by Mario Livio)  Education  In recent times the two disciplines have most often been taught separately, despite all the interrelations between physics and mathematics.Karam; Pospiech; & Pietrocola (2010). \\"Mathematics in physics lessons: developing structural skills\\" This led some professional mathematicians who were also interested in mathematics education, such as Felix Klein, Richard Courant, Vladimir Arnold and Morris Kline, to strongly advocate teaching mathematics in a way more closely related to the physical sciences.Stakhov \\"Dirac‚Äôs Principle of Mathematical Beauty, Mathematics of Harmony\\"  See also  *Pure mathematics *Applied mathematics *Theoretical physics *Mathematical physics *Non-Euclidean geometry *Fourier series *Conic section *Kepler's laws of planetary motion *Saving the phenomena *Positron#History *The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences *Mathematical universe hypothesis *Zeno's paradoxes *Axiomatic system *Mathematical model *Hilbert's sixth problem *Empiricism *Logicism *Formalism *Mathematics of general relativity *Bourbaki *Experimental mathematics *History of Maxwell's equations *Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism *History of astronomy *Why Johnny Can't Add  References   Further reading     * * (part 1) (part 2).  * *  External links  * Gregory W.

It is also unofficially known as Bemowo. The airport is administered by the Centre for Logistics \\"Warsaw-Babice\\" (Centrum Us≈Çug Logistycznych \\"Lotnisko Warszawa-Babice\\") and organisations based there include: the Warsaw Aero Club (Aeroklub Warszawski) and Polish Air Rescue (Lotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe). It has been used for various events and celebrity arrivals including Michael Jackson (1996), Madonna (2009), AC/DC (2010), and the Sonisphere Festival (2010, 2011, 2012).  Infrastructure  The airport has a concrete runway 10R/28L, measuring 1,300 m x 90 m, and, parallel to it, a grass runway 10L/28R, measuring 1,000 m x 150 m. The airport was established at the former military airport in Bemowo. It had two concrete runways 5/23 measuring 2,000 m x 80 m and 10R/28L measuring 2,500 m x 90 m. One of the former runways was used as an extension to the residential Powsta≈Ñc√≥w ≈ölƒÖskich Street. Only part of the second, longer runway was used for the new airport.  Radio frequencies  * 119.175 MHz - Babice Informacja (Babice Information for English speakers) * 122.300 MHz - Babice Radio  History  The site of the current airport was used as a landing strip for Russian and German airplanes. In 1918, it was one of the bases for the Research Institute of Aviation Technology (Instytutu Bada≈Ñ Techniki Lotniczej - IBTL) which then changed into the Technical Institute of Aviation (Instytut Techniczny Lotnictwa - ITL). The airport was reestablished after World War II, at \\"Szwedzkie G√≥rki\\" (Swedish Hills) between Fort P (part of the Warsaw Fortress) and Boernerowo outside Warsaw (during this period, it was in the municipality of Gmina Blizne based in Old Babice, hence the name of the airport). In 1959, a Boeing 707 transporting U.S. Vice-President Richard Nixon, used the airport. Singer Michael Jackson performed at Bemowo on 20 September 1996 during his HIStory World Tour in front of 120,000 people. Due to the heavy urbanization around the airport, to ensure safety and to ease the burden of airport operations for locals, a custom procedure (the only one of its kind in Poland) to circulate traffic was introduced, which caused controversy among pilots and instructors. There still is a conflict of interest between the airport and local residents.

Admission Historically, it was common for boys to become members of the university between the ages of 14 and 19.John Hooper Harvey, Mediaeval craftsmen (Batsford, 1975), p. 45 Today, as at other UK universities, the majority of students commence undergraduate courses aged 18, though 17 or 19 is common. However, there are no limits on the age of those admitted (except for at Harris Manchester College which caters only for students aged 21 or over). Much younger people are still occasionally given places if they are of the required standard, for example Ruth Lawrence matriculated age 12 in 1983, In common with most British universities, prospective students apply through the UCAS application system; but, prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October. To allow a more personalised judgement of students, who might otherwise apply for both, undergraduate applicants are not permitted to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same year. The only exceptions are applicants for Organ Scholarships and those applying to read for a second undergraduate degree. Students from all backgrounds are encouraged to apply, with \\"contextual data\\" (factors that may have influenced prior exam performance) taken into account during the admission procedure. The university believes that there are many potential students from less well-off backgrounds whom the university cannot admit simply because they do not apply. Most applicants choose to apply to one of the individual colleges, which work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the University regardless of their college preferences. Shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results; school references; and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. Students from outside Europe can be interviewed remotely, for example, over the Internet. In 2007, the colleges, faculties and departments published a \\"common framework\\" outlining the principles and procedures they observe. Offers are sent out in early-mid January, with an offer usually being from a specific college. One in four successful candidates receive offers from a college that they did not apply to. Some courses may make \\"open offers\\" to some candidates, who are not assigned to a particular college until A Level results day in August. Access The matriculation ceremony, at which new students officially become members of the university, takes place in Michaelmas Term. The University states that its admissions policies avoid bias against candidates of certain socioeconomic or educational backgrounds.Working with Schools and Colleges, University of Oxford Gazette, 2006. Retrieved 25 March 2007. However, the fairness of Oxford admissions has attracted public controversy through episodes such as the Laura Spence Affair in 2000. Gaining places at Oxford and Cambridge remains a central focus for many private and selective state schools ‚Äî much more so than most state schools ‚Äî and the fact that the social make-up of undergraduates at the university differs substantially from the social make-up of society at large remains controversial. In 2007, the university refined its admissions procedure to take into account the academic performance of its applicants' schools. Hertford College's Bridge of Sighs. Hertford was one of the first colleges to encourage applicants from state schools through the Hertford Scheme. Students who apply from state schools and colleges have an acceptance rate broadly comparable to those from independent schools (19% and 24% of applicants accepted respectively, 2010).Undergraduate Admissions Statistics: 2010 entry. Retrieved 12 April 2011. More than half of applications come from the state sector, and the University of Oxford funds many initiatives to attract applicants from this sector, including the UNIQ Summer Schools, Oxford Young Ambassadors, Target Schools, and the FE Access Initiative. Regarding the UNIQ Summer School, of all the UNIQ students who went on to make applications in autumn 2010 to enter the university in 2011/12, 39 per cent ended up with places. The overall success rate for Oxford applicants is around 20 per cent. Most colleges also run their own access schemes and initiatives. The Oxford Admissions Study was a research project set up to investigate access issues, in which data were collected on 2,000 students who applied to the university in 2002, including exam results from the universities they went on to attend. A number of reports were published based on these data. It was found that, if anything, admissions tutors treat applicants from state schools more favourably than applicants from private schools with the same attainment. The research also suggested that this discounting was justified as private school students need higher grades at entry to do as well as their state school educated peers in final university examinations. It was found that cultural knowledge beyond the school curriculum, linked highly to reading habits, was a good indicator for whether arts subjects would gain a place. Contrastingly, participation in cultural activities such as visiting museums, art galleries, classical concerts, and ballet made no difference. Veiled accusations of racism regarding the 2009 intake were dismissed on the grounds that ethnic minority applicants apply disproportionately more to the most competitive courses, and that black candidates had lower A-level scores nationally. However, further analysis of entrance figures for 2010 and 2011 by The Guardian reported what was termed an \\"institutional bias\\" in favour of white candidates; ethnic minority candidates had significantly lower success rates in individual subjects even when they had the same grades as white candidates. In medicine, for instance, ethnic minority applicants who went on to score three A* grades at A level were almost half as likely to gain admission as white applicants with similar grades. Teaching and learning Undergraduate teaching is centred on the tutorial, where 1‚Äì4 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week‚Äôs work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). Students usually have one or two tutorials a week, and can be taught by academics at any other college‚Äînot just their own‚Äîas expertise and personnel require. These tutorials are complemented by lectures, classes and seminars, which are organised on a departmental basis. Graduate students undertaking taught degrees are usually instructed through classes and seminars, though there is more focus upon individual research. The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. The passing of two sets of examinations is a prerequisite for a first degree. The first set of examinations, called either Honour Moderations (\\"Mods\\" and \\"Honour Mods\\") or Preliminary Examinations (\\"Prelims\\"), are usually held at the end of the first year (after two terms for those studying Law; Theology; Philosophy and Theology; Experimental Psychology; or Psychology, Philosophy and Physiology or after five terms in the case of Classics). The second set of examinations, the Final Honour School (\\"Finals\\"), is held at the end of the undergraduate course (for humanities and most social sciences) or at the end of each successive year of the course after the first (most mathematical, physical and life sciences, and some social sciences). Successful candidates receive first-, upper or lower second-, or third-class honours, or simply a \\"pass\\" without honours, based on their performance in Finals. An upper second is the most usual result, and a first is often prerequisite for graduate study. A \\"double first\\" reflects first-class results in both Honour Moderations and Finals. As a matter of tradition, bachelor's degree graduates are eligible, after seven years from matriculation (formal induction of students into the university) and without additional study, to purchase for a nominal fee an upgrade of their bachelor's degree to an \\"MA\\" or Master of Arts. All MAs were members of Convocation; and, until 1913, all resident members of Convocation were members of Congregation. MAs, as members of Convocation, elected the Chancellor and Professor of Poetry, but recently Convocation has been widened to consist of all graduates. Undergraduate teaching takes place during three eight week terms: Michaelmas Term, Hilary Term and Trinity Term. (These are officially known as 'Full Term', 'Term' is a lengthier period with little practical significance.) Internally, the weeks in a term begin on Sundays, and are referred to numerically, with the initial week known as \\"first week\\", the last as \\"eighth week\\" and with the numbering extended to refer to weeks before and after term (for example \\"-1st week\\" and \\"0th week\\" precede term). Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week. These teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities, and their total duration amounts to less than half the year. However, undergraduates are also expected to do some academic work during the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacations).

Conversely, in northern areas the calves are considered to be of superior quality. Etymology Lexicographer Edward Dwelly translates tarbh-uisge from the Scottish Gaelic as \\"water bull, sea bull or cow\\" with the addition of \\"fabulous\\" within parentheses. The Celtic term for a bull is fairly consistently rendered as tarbh in Scottish Gaelic; tarroo is the Manx variation and tarw is the Welsh equivalent. Uisge is the Scottish Gaelic word for water, river or stream. Folk beliefs =Description and common attributes= Belief in the existence of water bulls persisted in Scotland until at least the last quarter of the 19th century. As with many mythological creatures, descriptions are imprecise. The water bull is able to shapeshift into human form, and live on land or in water. It can be a monstrous, malevolent black beast, especially when described as a tarbh uisge, but not as nasty as the each uisge or water horse. It can also be amiable and sometimes helpful. It differs from the Manx tarroo ushtey, which is more likely to be a resident of marshland. As in the case of kelpies and water horses, most myths about water bulls are about males of the species. Occasionally a water cow is mentioned, as in the Highland tale set at Borrodale on Skye, where a water cow was reputed to reside in a small loch. Canine carcases left out to trap the beast were ignored. Sir Walter Scott also refers to a water cow in a story about an attempt to drain Loch na Beiste to kill one believed to be living there. The Manx water bull mating with an ordinary cow usually results in the death of the cow after she produces a dead and \\"rude lump of flesh and skin without bones\\", whereas its Scottish counterpart produces live calves whose only deformity is apparent in their ears. The bulls have no ears themselves and therefore produce calves with only half ears, described by folklorist and Tiree Minister John Gregorson Campbell as \\"knife-eared\\". Water cows living at Leverburgh produce offspring with disfigured crimson or purple-coloured ears. Folklorist John F. Campbell noted a story told on Islay, one of the Inner Hebridean islands, which demonstrates the usefulness of having a water bull. Just after a calf was born to an ordinary cow, an elderly lady, later identified as a witch, advised the herdsman to keep it separate from the other cattle, presumably after she noticed its deformed ears and suspected it was a water bull. She instructed the herdsman to rear the calf on milk from three different cows and to keep it confined in a stable for a minimum of seven years. Years later, a young woman was grazing cattle at a nearby loch when she was approached by an attractive man. He struck up a conversation with her and shortly afterwards the pair sat on the grass with his head resting in her lap, but as he fell asleep she discovered seaweed entwined in his hair, a sign that he was a water horse. She started to run back to the farm. Her suitor awoke, shapeshifted into his true equine form and chased after her. As the woman ran towards the farm, the witch shouted to the herdsman to release the water bull from the stable. The two creatures fought until they fell into the sea. The water horse never returned, but the remains of the bull were found the following day. =Capture and killing= Accounts of snaring and destroying the beast are rare, as it is not generally considered to be a threat. In 1819 John MacCulloch, a noted geologist, described how inhabitants around the areas of Loch Awe and Loch Rannoch tried to capture a water bull by shackling a sheep to an oak tree as an enticement, but the tackle was not strong enough. Another story describes a farmer and his two sons hunting a water bull. The farmer's musket was filled with silver sixpence coins as the beast can only be killed with silver. According to Celtic mythology scholar James MacKillop, because the calves of water bulls and ordinary cows might bring disaster to the herd, they are supposed to be killed at birth; it is impossible to kill them by drowning, so other methods have to be used. Conversely, stories published in 1937 by the clergyman George Sutherland suggest these hybrids are considered to be of superior quality to normal pedigree cattle in the far north of Scotland. Origins The bull appears to have had a sacred role in a number of Celtic cults. The animal was viewed positively by the Celts as an image of fertility and abundance; one tribe, the Taurini, even adopted the bull's name. It is unknown how it came to be associated with bodies of water in the form of the water bull, but historian and symbologist Charles Milton Smith has suggested that such mythological creatures might originate with the water spouts that can form over the surface of Scottish lochs, which can give the impression of a living form as they move across the water.

For instance, e-cigarettes were illegal in Japan, which forced the market to use heat-not- burn tobacco products for cigarette alternatives. Others have introduced strict restrictions and some have licensed devices as medicines such as in the UK. However, , there is no e-cigarette device that has been given a medical license that is commercially sold or available by prescription in the UK. , around two thirds of major nations have regulated e-cigarettes in some way. Because of the potential relationship with tobacco laws and medical drug policies, e-cigarette legislation is being debated in many countries. The companies that make e-cigarettes have been pushing for laws that support their interests. In 2016 the US Department of Transportation banned the use of e-cigarettes on commercial flights. This regulation applies to all flights to and from the US. In 2018, the Royal College of Physicians asked that a balance is found in regulations over e-cigarettes that ensure product safety while encouraging smokers to use them instead of tobacco, as well as keep an eye on any effects contrary to the control agencies for tobacco. A recent study shows electronic device company \\"JUUL\\" contains carcinogens and other harmful ingredients inside their e-juice cartridges. The legal status of e-cigarettes is currently pending in many countries. Many countries such as Brazil, Singapore, Uruguay, and India have banned e-cigarettes. Canada-wide in 2014, they were technically illegal to sell, as no nicotine-containing e-cigarettes are not regulated by Health Canada, but this is generally unenforced and they are commonly available for sale Canada-wide. In 2016, Health Canada announced plans to regulate vaping products. In the US and the UK, the use and sale to adults of e-cigarettes are legal. The revised EU Tobacco Products Directive came into effect May 2016, providing stricter regulations for e-cigarettes. It limits e-cigarette advertising in print, on television and radio, along with reducing the level of nicotine in liquids and reducing the flavors used. It does not ban vaping in public places. It requires the purchaser for e-cigarettes to be at least 18 and does not permit buying them for anyone less than 18 years of age. The updated Tobacco Products Directive has been disputed by tobacco lobbyists whose businesses could be impacted by these revisions. As of August 8, 2016, the FDA extended its regulatory power to include e-cigarettes, e-liquid and all related products. Under this ruling the FDA will evaluate certain issues, including ingredients, product features and health risks, as well their appeal to minors and non-users. The FDA rule also bans access to minors. A photo ID is now required to buy e-cigarettes, and their sale in all-ages vending machines is not permitted in the US. As of August 2017, regulatory compliance deadlines relating to premarket review requirements for most e-cigarette and e-liquid products have been extended from November 2017 to August 8, 2022, which attracted a lawsuit filed by the American Heart Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, and other plaintiffs. In May 2016 the FDA used its authority under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act to deem e-cigarette devices and e-liquids to be tobacco products, which meant it intended to regulate the marketing, labelling, and manufacture of devices and liquids; vape shops that mix e-liquids or make or modify devices were considered manufacturing sites that needed to register with FDA and comply with good manufacturing practice regulation. E-cigarette and tobacco companies have recruited lobbyists in an effort to prevent the FDA from evaluating e-cigarette products or banning existing products already on the market. In February 2014 the European Parliament passed regulations requiring standardization and quality control for liquids and vaporizers, disclosure of ingredients in liquids, and child-proofing and tamper-proofing for liquid packaging. In April 2014 the FDA published proposed regulations for e-cigarettes. In the US some states tax e-cigarettes as tobacco products, and some state and regional governments have broadened their indoor smoking bans to include e-cigarettes. , 12 US states and 615 localities had prohibited the use of e-cigarettes in venues in which traditional cigarette smoking was prohibited. In 2015, at least 48 states and 2 territories had banned e-cigarette sales to minors. E-cigarettes containing nicotine have been listed as drug delivery devices in a number of countries, and the marketing of such products has been restricted or put on hold until safety and efficacy clinical trials are conclusive. Since they do not contain tobacco, television advertising in the US is not restricted. Some countries have regulated e-cigarettes as a medical product even though they have not approved them as a smoking cessation aid. A 2014 review stated the emerging phenomenon of e-cigarettes has raised concerns in the health community, governments, and the general public and recommended that e-cigarettes should be regulated to protect consumers. It added, \\"heavy regulation by restricting access to e-cigarettes would just encourage continuing use of much unhealthier tobacco smoking.\\" A 2014 review said regulation of the e-cigarette should be considered on the basis of reported adverse health effects.

Passengers are not allowed to carry e-cigarettes and e-liquids into Taiwan. *India: E-cigarettes are mostly unregulated and are technically illegal to sell, as they have not received approval from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO). According to government data, as of July 2019, there were over 460 e-cigarette brands available in the Indian market utilizing varying methods of nicotine delivery and over 7,700 flavours of e-liquids. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued an advisory to restrict the advertisement of e-cigarettes in August 2018. The CDSCO notified all state drug controllers on 22 February 2019 that ENDS products were not approved for sale, and asked them to ensure that the sale of such products was prohibited. There was confusion over what law could be applied to regulate e-cigarettes. On 1 June 2019, experts at a drug consultative committee meeting concluded that ENDS devices fell under the definition of \\"drug\\" under Section 3(b) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. The State Drugs Controller of the state of Punjab declared e-cigarettes with nicotine as an unapproved drug in 2013. On 7 April 2016, a District Court in the Punjab sentenced a man to 3 years imprisonment and a fine of for selling e-cigarettes. This was the first ever conviction in India concerning e-cigarettes. The states of Bihar, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Mizoram, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and the union territory of Chandigarh have declared e-cigarettes as an unapproved drug under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Rules, 1945, and can prosecute sellers under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Rules, 1945. On September 18 2019, the Government of India imposed a ban on sale and production of e-cigarettes. Importing e-cigarettes is also banned in India.Showcase Delhi -No More E-Cigarettes To Be Sold In India.

Indonesian Government estimates the contribution from the tax would contribute around 100-200 billion rupiah. The tax is based on Finance Ministerial Regulation No. 146/010/2017 on tobacco. *Iran, Islamic Republic of: Sale or distribution of e-cigarettes is illegal. *Japan: E-cigarettes containing nicotine were banned starting in 2010. Non-nicotine e-cigarettes are sold to adults and minors since no regulation exists for non-nicotine e-cigarettes in Japan. Now it is legal if the e-cigarette is registered as a medicinal product. *Kuwait: The sale and importation of e-cigarettes are banned, in accordance with a Gulf Cooperation Council agreement. *Malaysia: In 2015, the Malaysian National Fatwa Council issued a fatwa declaring e-cigarettes haram (forbidden) because of their harmful health effects and bad smell. Though the fatwa is not legally binding, it carries weight for religious Muslims and has caused the governments of four majority-Muslim states‚ÄîPenang, Kedah, Johor, and Kelantan‚Äîto ban vaping. As a response to the fatwa, the Malaysian federal government began regulating e-liquid ingredients and vape sales to minors in 2018, marking the first federal regulations of the 2.5 billion ringgit (US$610 million) industry. A petition called \\"Selamatkan anak-anak Malaysia\\" was launched by Parent & Teacher Action Group Malaysia to urge government to ban (totally) e-cigarette and vape in Malaysia, which they managed to collect more than 100,000 signatures so far. *Nepal: Under current cigarette laws, the sale of e-cigarettes is permitted. *Pakistan:The import and sale of e-cigarettes is legal, but Pakistan Medical and Dental council find that the current health safety assessments of e-cigarettes to not yet be satisfactory. *Palestine: Regulations of e-cigarette use is unknown, but the sales of e-cigarettes is banned by the Palestinian National Authority.https://www.who.int/tobacco/surveillance/policy/country_profile/pse.pdf?ua=1 *Philippines: The sale of e-cigarettes is now regulated under Executive Order 106 since 2020. The government banned the use and sale of cigarettes or other tobacco products by a minor, or e-cigarettes, heated tobacco products or their components by a person below 21 years old. The Philippine Medical Association has recommended to different city governments to broaden their public places and transportation smoking bans to include e-cigarettes. *Qatar: E-cigarettes have been illegal since 2014. *Saudi Arabia: Importation of e-cigarettes is banned as of 2012, except in small quantities for personal use, as is sale in public shops. However, personal consumption of e-cigarettes is permitted for those over age 18 in Saudi Arabia. Use of e-cigarettes is banned in many public, educational, religious, and cultural spaces, as well as in certain private spaces such as elevators, restrooms, and food production facilities. The Ministry of Health considers e-cigarettes tobacco products. *Singapore: E-cigarettes are currently prohibited under Section 16 (1) of the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act, which is enforced by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). This legislation prohibits the importation, distribution, sale or offer for sale of any confectionery or other food product or any toy or other article that is designed to resemble a tobacco product or the packaging of which is designed to resemble the packaging commonly associated with tobacco products. HSA takes a serious view on any person who contravenes the law. Those guilty of the offence are liable to a fine of up to $5,000 upon conviction. According to Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan, e-cigarettes are the industry's attempt to attract new users and were marketed to appeal to younger customers, including women. *South Korea: The sale and use of e-cigarettes is legal, but is heavily taxed. Electric cigarette possession among teenagers remains an issue. *Thailand: Thailand has banned e-cigarettes since 2014. *United Arab Emirates: The sale and use of e-cigarettes has become legal from 15 April 2019.  Europe  Current legal status of e-cigarettes and nicotine-containing or nicotine-free cartridges in Europe: = European Union = On 19 December 2012 the European Commission adopted its proposal to revise the European Union Tobacco Products Directive 2001/37/EC which included proposals to introduce restrictions on the use and sales of e-cigarettes. On 8 October 2013 the European Parliament in Strasbourg voted down the Commission's proposal to introduce medical regulation for e-cigarettes, but proposed that cross-border marketing of e-cigarettes be regulated similarly to tobacco products, meaning that sales of e-cigarettes to under-18s would be prohibited in the European Union, along with most cross- border advertising. Warning labels also would be required. The Parliament and Member States are involved in trilogue discussions to reach a common conclusion. In February 2014, the European Parliament approved new regulations for tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. The new regulations forbid advertising of e-cigarettes, set limits on maximum concentrations of nicotine in liquids, limit maximum volumes of liquid that can be sold, require child- proof and tamper-proof packaging of liquid, set requirements on purity of ingredients, require that the devices deliver consistent doses of vapor, require disclosure of ingredients and nicotine content, and empower regulators to act if the regulations are violated. In October 2014 e-cigarette manufacturer Totally Wicked won the right to challenge the directive at the Court of Justice of the EU. The hearing took place on 1 October 2015 and the results will not be announced until early 2016. In autumn 2013, the e-cigarette industry ran \\"a determined lobbying campaign\\" to defeat proposed European legislation to regulate e-cigarettes like medical devices. Pharmaceutical manufacturers GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson & Johnson have lobbied the US government, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the EU parliament for stricter regulation of e-cigarettes which compete with their products Nicorette gum and nicotine patches. = By country = A no vaping sign on public transport from Scotland *Albania: No information is available. *Armenia: The sale of e-cigarettes and liquids with and without nicotine is not regulated. *Austria: Nicotine-containing cartridges are classified as medicinal products and e-cigarettes for nicotine inhalation as medical devices. Nicotine cartridges may not be sold without a license. *Azerbaijan: No information is available. *Belarus: No information is available. *Belgium: A royal decree legalized the sale of nicotine containing cartridges outside of pharmacies as long as the cartridge contains not more than 2 ml and a maximum of 20 mg/ml of nicotine. The sale to a minor under the age of 18 years is prohibited. *Bosnia and Herzegovina: Nicotine-containing cartridges are not classified as tobacco products, and therefore the sale is not regulated. *Bulgaria: The sale and use of e-cigarettes are legal, as well as the sale of cartridges and liquids with nicotine *Croatia: Advertising is restricted. Vaping is banned in all public enclosed facilities. By a law passed by the parliament e-cigarettes are classified as tobacco products. Therefore, vaping is banned in all public buildings, and the sale to a minor is prohibited. *Cyprus: No information is available. *Czech Republic: Sales are prohibited to people under 18 years of age. The use and advertising of e-cigarettes are legal. Sale of e-cigarettes is regulated in the same way as sale of conventional cigarettes ‚Äì as such, e-cigarettes cannot be sold to minors and can be sold only at places permitted to sell conventional cigarettes. Online sale with mail delivery is de facto illegal due to the impossibility for age verification, however this rule is not enforced and there are plenty of e-shops. *Denmark: Advertising is restricted. The Danish Medicines Agency classifies e-cigarettes containing nicotine as medicinal products. Thus, authorization is required before the product may be marketed and sold, and no such authorization has currently been given. The agency has clarified, however, that e-cigarettes that do not administer nicotine to the user, and are not otherwise used for the prevention or treatment of disease, are not considered medicinal devices. *Estonia: The Estonian State Agency of Medicines had previously banned e-cigarettes, but the ban was overturned in court on 7 March 2013. Currently e-liquids containing more than 0.7 mg/ml of nicotine are still considered medicine and as such cannot be legally purchased within the country due to no manufacturer being licensed properly. Following the outcome of EU tobacco directive in October 2013, the legislation is moving towards a more relaxed stance on the issue. As stated by the Estonian minister of social affairs Taavi R√µivas (in charge of tobacco regulation), e-cigarettes will receive an advertisement ban and will clearly be banned for minors but will be available for adults before the end of 2013. *Finland: The National Supervisory Authority of Welfare and Health (Valvira) declared that the new tobacco marketing ban (effective 1 January 2012) would also cover e-cigarettes, resulting in that Finnish stores or web stores can't advertise e-cigarettes because they might look like regular cigarettes. In theory, e-cigarettes with nicotine-free cartridges may still be sold, as long as their images and prices are not visible. Ordering from abroad remains allowed. Sale of nicotine cartridges is currently prohibited, as nicotine is considered a prescription drug requiring an authorization that such cartridges do not yet have. However, the Finnish authorities have decided that nicotine cartridges containing less than 10 mg nicotine, and e-liquid containing less than 0.42 g nicotine per bottle, may be legally brought in from other countries for private use. If the nicotine content is higher, a prescription from a Finnish physician is required. From a country within the European Economic Area a maximum of one year's supply may be brought in for private use when returning to Finland, while three months' supply may be brought in from outside the EEA. Mail-order deliveries from EEA countries, for a maximum of three months' supply, are also allowed.Helsingin Sanomat: \\"S√§hk√∂tupakan myynti kiellettiin Suomessa\\".

Retrieved 6 March 2011. *France: The sales of e-cigarettes or machines that imitate smoking, as well as the sale of cartridges containing or not containing nicotine, are prohibited to people under 18 years of age. The e-cigarettes are considered neither as a medical device nor as a medicine, according to a 2011 opinion of the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM), if it is not claimed by its sellers as a smoking cessation product, if the level and amount of nicotine do not exceed the thresholds of (20 mg / ml) and 10 mL respectively. In January 2017, the French Health Law transposing the European Directive on Tobacco Products came into force and establishes a list of places where smoking is prohibited. Offenders are liable to a fine of 150 euros or more. The persons responsible for the places where the prohibition applies and who have not put in place the signage will be fined 450 euros. *Georgia: Until the introduction of new tobacco laws that was passed in 2018, there were virtually no regulation in e-cigarettes. However, since the passing of the Tobacco-Control Law 2017, persons caught smoking including using e-cigarettes have been prohibited in all enclosed areas, bar private houses and casinos and public transport, but not taxis, watercraft and designed areas in airports. *Germany Sales of e-cigarettes are prohibited for people under 18 years of age since transposition deadline for member states of the European Union regarding the Tobacco Products Directive (2014/40/EU) (including non-nicotine-containing cartridges). The use of such is not allowed in restaurants, where they are sold, and other public places. *Greece: The marketing of e-cigarettes is banned unless a Ministerial decision authorises them under certain conditions. Sales of e-cigarettes are prohibited for people under 18 years of age (only for nicotine-containing cartridges). *Hungary: The sale of nicotine-containing cartridges is legal as long as they are packaged in volumes of 10ml maximum in bottles and only sold at the official 'Nemzeti Doh√°nybolt' (National Tobacco Shops). At least 30% of the packaging must indicate the following text, \\"This product contains nicotine, which causes a strong addiction\\" The same restrictions apply to the sale of any e-cigarette and refillable tanker liquids as to any other tobacco product, therefore the legal purchasing age is 18 years. *Iceland: *Ireland: In Ireland,the legal age to buy a vape and use it is 15. Vape juice bottles must not under European Union Law come in a bottle more than 50ml. *Israel: In 2013, the Ministry of Health planned to extend existing laws on smoking in public places to e-cigarettes, a year after warning against the product's usage. *Italy: Sales of e-cigarettes are prohibited for people under 18 years of age (only for nicotine-containing cartridges). In 2013 the minimum age of 16 years for the sale of cartridges containing nicotine was raised to 18 years. Whoever now sells cartridges containing nicotine to a person under 18 years of age can be fined 250-‚Ç¨2,000. *Latvia: The sale and use of e-cigarettes are legal. *Liechtenstein: Sales of e-cigarettes to people under 16 years of age is prohibited. All other laws regarding sales and imports are carried over from the laws of Switzerland. *Lithuania: The sale and use of e-cigarettes are legal. *Luxembourg: The sale and use of e-cigarettes are legal, and sales of e-cigarettes are prohibited to under 18s. Since a new tobacco law was introduced in 2017, persons cannot personally import e-cigarettes or e-liquid from abroad by post and vaping is prohibited in enclosed spaces like bars and restaurants. *Malta: Sales and use of e-cigarettes under 18 years of age is prohibited.Tobacco (Smoking Control) Act Sec. 13 Since 2010 products and smoking devices which are simulating cigarette or tobacco smoking are included to \\"tobacco products\\" as considered in the Tobacco (Smoking Control) Act.Products and Smoking Devices (Simulating Cigarettes or Tobacco) (Control) Regulations *Moldova: No information is available. *Montenegro: No information is available. *Netherlands: Since 2017, sales of e-cigarettes to people under 18 years is prohibited. Sales of e-liquid refills are regulated; with a maximum size of 10 ml per package, a maximum nicotine concentration of 20 mg/ml and strict labeling requirements including warning labels about harmfulness of nicotine.

The laws on plain packaging for tobacco which came about in 2020, extends to e-cigarettes in 2022. *North Macedonia: No information is available. *Norway: The sale and use of e-cigarettes are legal, but nicotine cartridges can only be imported from other EEA member states (e.g. the UK) for private use. Norway does not allow e-cigarette advertising. A no smoking and no vaping sign in a Gdansk bus. *Poland Since a revision of the tobacco prohibition law in 2016. There has been a large change in the e-cigarette regulation, previously where it was very loose. Currently there is ban on sales to under 18s, prohibition of marketing and sales online and in cigarette machines and a ban in hospitals & all public transport including PKP train stations but not airports. Vapers who break the laws are liable to a fine of up to 500 zloty (approximately ‚Ç¨117.80). *Portugal: The sale of nicotine-containing cartridges is restricted. *Romania The sale and use of e-cigarettes are legal, from 2016 the liquid used in e-cigarettes will have an excise duty *Russia: E-cigarettes are not considered to be a tobacco product in Russia according to the Ministry of Health therefore sales and possessions of such devices are unregulated. *Serbia: No information is available. Kosovo: No information is available. *Slovakia: No information is available. *Slovenia: No information is available. *Spain: Sales of e-cigarettes to people under 18 years is prohibited. The sale of products that imitate smoking (which also includes e-cigarettes) to minors is illegal. The Ministry of Health also said that the use and sale of e-cigarettes will soon be regulated. *Sweden: Sale of e-cigarettes is legal to sell for anyone, but sales of nicotine e-liquid is illegal to sell to anyone under the age of 18. *Switzerland: In 2018, local Swiss businesses successfully challenged the illegality of nicotine-containing liquids within the federal courts, immediately lifting the ban and enabling the sales of nicotine liquids countrywide, and in neighbouring Liechtenstein, which follows the same laws. As of December 2011, the tobacco tax does not apply to e-cigarettes and respective liquids containing nicotine. *Turkey: Regulation of e-cigarettes is inconsistent. Sales are not completely banned and there are plenty of online shops. In May 2013 the Minister of Health stated that e-cigarettes which contain nicotine are medical devices and thus cannot be imported unless approved by the \\"Turkish Medicines and Medical Devices Agency\\". But according to a WHO report as of 2014 e-cigarettes are not regulated as a therapeutic product. However law 4207, which regulates smoking, was amended in June 2013 by article 26 of law 6487 to also apply to items which do not contain tobacco: \\"Herbal water pipes and all kind of cigarettes which do not contain tobacco but are used in a way to imitate tobacco products shall also be deemed as tobacco product.\\" Vaping is thus forbidden indoors and on public transport, and also therefore forbidden for people under 18 years old. And thus, like tobacco products, personal import by mail or courier is forbidden. Specifically vaping is forbidden on high-speed trains. *Ukraine: No information is available. *United Kingdom: In the United Kingdom, the use, sale and advertising of e-cigarettes are legal, and e-cigarettes are not covered by laws restricting smoking in public places. However, businesses may choose to ban e-cigarettes as well. A notable example is Transport for London, banning smoking and vaping as their Conditions of Carriage. Most trains (and train platforms), airports, and coaches for public transportation have banned the use of e-cigarettes. Effective 1 October 2015, it is illegal to sell e-cigarettes or e-liquids to minors. In 2014 the government announced legislation would be brought forward to outlaw the purchase of e-cigarettes by people under the age of 18. In October 2014 the UK's Advertising Standards Authority changed the regulations on e-cigarette advertising, allowing the devices to appear in TV ads from 10 November. The first advert to take advantage of the change, promoting KiK e-cigarettes, aired on the day it came into force. In June 2015 the Welsh Government announced that under legislation it planned to pass, in Wales e-cigarettes would be included in existing bans on smoking in workplaces and other public spaces. In 2018, the Royal College of Physicians has recommended that regulation be proportionate in aiming to assure the safety of the devices, encouraging smokers to vape rather than use tobacco, and identify and stop effects that oppose the long-term objectives of the tobacco control strategy. As part of the EU's Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) directives set out in 2014, which came into effect in 2017, the maximum nicotine content of a liquid allowed within the UK is 20 mg/ml, and bottles may not contain more than 10ml of liquid and must be child-proof and tamper evident. Likewise, atomisers sold within the country cannot have a capacity of more than 2ml. In addition, certain additives within flavourings/liquids are banned (such as caffeine, taurine and certain colourings). Finally, all e-cigarettes and liquids sold within the UK must be registered with MHRA by their respective manufacturers before they can be legally sold. Gibraltar: Sales of e-cigarettes is legal. United States =Federal regulation= Prior to 8 August 2016, regulations concerning the use of e-cigarettes varied considerably across the United States, although there is more variation regarding laws limiting their use by youth than regarding multi-level regulations, such as banning their use in public places. The FDA classified e-cigarettes as drug delivery devices and subject to regulation under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) before importation and sale in the US. The classification was challenged in court, and overruled in January 2010 by Federal District Court Judge Richard J. Leon, explaining that \\"the devices should be regulated as tobacco products rather than drug or medical products.\\" In March 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed the injunction pending an appeal, during which the FDA argued the right to regulate e-cigarettes based on their previous ability to regulate nicotine replacement therapies such as nicotine gum or patches. Further, the agency argued that tobacco legislation enacted the previous year \\"expressly excludes from the definition of 'tobacco product' any article that is a drug, device or combination product under the FDCA, and provides that such articles shall be subject to regulation under the pre-existing FDCA provisions.\\" On 7 December 2010, the appeals court ruled against the FDA in a 3‚Äì0 unanimous decision, ruling the FDA can only regulate e-cigarettes as tobacco products, and thus cannot block their import. The judges ruled that such devices would only be subject to drug legislation if they are marketed for therapeutic use ‚Äì E-cigarette manufacturers had successfully proven that their products were targeted at smokers and not at those seeking to quit. The District Columbia Circuit appeals court, on 24 January 2011, declined to review the decision en banc, blocking the products from FDA regulation as medical devices. In April 2014, the FDA proposed new regulations for tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. The regulations require disclosure of ingredients used in e-cigarette liquids, proof of safety of those ingredients, and regulation of the devices used to vaporize and deliver the liquid.Brady Dennis for the Washington Post. 24 April 2014 FDA outlines plan to regulate e-cigarettesSabrina Tavernise for the New York Times. 24 April 2014 F.D.A.

In August 2014, attorneys general from over two dozen states advised the FDA to enact restrictions on e-cigarettes, including banning flavors. On 10 May 2016, the FDA published their deeming regulations in the Federal Register, which were to take effect on 8 August 2016. Vendors and companies had until two years afterward to prepare paperwork with the FDA to have their product remain on the market. Currently, there are lawsuits and amendments made in the works in Congress to change that provision. The lack of research on the risks and possible benefits has resulted in precautionary policymaking in the US \\"which often lacks grounding in empirical evidence and results in spatially uneven diffusion of policy\\". The time by which applications to market regulated non-combustible tobacco product devices must be submitted for review has been extended to August 8, 2022. As of 8 August 2016, the FDA extended its regulatory power to include e-cigarettes. Under this ruling the FDA will evaluate certain issues, including ingredients, product features and health risks, as well their appeal to minors and non- users. The FDA rule also bans access to minors. A photo ID is required to buy e-cigarettes, and their sale in all-ages vending machines is not permitted. The FDA in September 2016 has sent warning letters for unlawful underage sales to online retailers and retailers of e-cigarettes. FDA regulations have also applied to the advertising of e-cigarettes since 2016. Per FDA regulations, e-cigarettes, e-liquid, and associated products cannot be advertised as safer than other tobacco products unless they have received modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) status. , this status has not been granted to any e-cigarette or e-liquid product. Though no companies have applied for an MRTP permit for their vaping products, similar heat-not-burn tobacco products have been denied MRTP status on the grounds that they are not safer than traditional cigarettes. On December 5, 2016 HUD passed a rule banning the use of tobacco products in common areas and within each home unit. HUD did not include e-cigarettes in their list of prohibited tobacco products, and they will allow each public housing agency to make that decision. The ban includes cigarettes, cigars, pipes and waterpipes (hookahs). E-cigarettes were not included because they believe there would be no maintenance cost savings or a lowered risk of destructive fires. HUD commented that there is a lack of evidence that the vapor causes any damage to the units. Beginning in May 2018, the FDA began to crack down on e-liquid brands whose packaging resembles food or beverage products. FDA is particularly concerned about e-liquids whose packaging resembles that of candy, juice boxes, and other products intended to appeal to children, because of concern that children will mistakenly drink the e-liquid and die of nicotine poisoning. Nicotine is especially toxic to young children, and a 60 ml bottle of e-liquid with 11 mg/ml nicotine concentration, the average e-liquid bottle in the U.S., is likely to kill a child of age 4 or younger. As such, the FDA has charged e-liquid products with branding that resembles food, candy, or beverage items as being misbranded and using false advertising, which is illegal under the Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (specifically sections 903(a)(1) and 903(a)(7)(A) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, ). In September 2018, the FDA has further strengthened its Youth Tobacco Prevention Plan by targeting the e-cigarette industry with fines for retailers and manufactures that are illegally selling to youth. FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., has indicated that this is a first step in a new and significant enforcement strategy against the e-cigarette industry. In November 2018, the FDA announced new steps to curb youth vaping while still ensuring the adults who would benefit from e-cigarettes still had access to a healthier nicotine delivery system. Sales of flavored tobacco products will be limited to adult only stores and online vendors with the exception of tobacco, mint or menthol e-cigarettes that will remain for sales wherever combustible cigarettes are sold (convenience stores). If the FDA does not see a change in the illegal youth access of menthol or minty vapes currently 20% of their use, they will move to adjust their regulations. The decision to allow menthol vapes was to ensure that an alternative was present should an adult go to purchase menthol cigarettes. The age verification of online vendors for vape products will see an increased level of security. In the midst of an outbreak of lung illness in the US linked to vaping products, Donald Trump said in September 2019 that his administration is planning to propose a ban on e-cigarette liquid flavors. = State regulation = alt=A no smoking or vaping sign from the US. In the United States, different measures have been taken to regulate e-cigarettes. In March 2010, New Jersey became the first state to implement e-cigarette Minimum Legal Sale Age Law (MLSA) and comprehensive indoor use ban in workplaces, restaurants, and bars. That same year, Minnesota imposed the first e-cigarette tax in the country. Six years later, the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Tobacco Products (FDA- CTP) deemed e-cigarettes to be tobacco products. In May 2016, the FDA-CTP made the following requirements: e-cigarettes are required to carry a warning label, a national e-cigarette MLSA of 18 was put in place, and the FDA-CTP must eventually approve all e-cigarette products through a pre-market application process. Effective 8 August 2016, all US states will follow the same, uniform federal guidelines. With an absence of federal regulations, many states and cities had adopted their own e-cigarette regulations, most commonly to prohibit sales to minors, including Maryland, Kentucky, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Utah, Wisconsin, and Colorado. Other states are considering similar legislation. Several US cities and states have enacted laws that increased the legal age to purchase e-cigarettes to age 21. , some states in the US permit e-cigarettes to be taxed as tobacco products, and some state and regional governments in the US had extended their indoor smoking bans to include e-cigarettes. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a bill that would regulate the sale of e-cigarettes within the state on grounds that \\"if adults want to purchase and consume these products with an understanding of the associated health risks, they should be able to do so.\\" A review of regulations in 40 U.S. states found that how a law defines e-cigarettes is critical, with some definitions allowing e-cigarettes to avoid smoke-free laws, taxation, and restrictions on sales and marketing. Fewer policies have been created to restrict vaping indoors than with cigarette smoking. Many local and state jurisdictions have recently begun enacting laws that prohibit e-cigarette usage everywhere that smoking is banned, although some state laws with comprehensive smoke-free laws will still allow for vaping to be permitted in bars and restaurants while prohibiting e-cigarettes in other indoor places. As of August 2016, the United States Navy is considering banning e-cigarettes. A 2017 report stated \\"As of 2 October 2015, five US states and over 400 counties have implemented some form of restriction of ECIG use indoors. International policies are more varied with certain restrictions for ECIG use in UK airports and trains and reports of complete ECIG bans in indoor public places for Malta, Belgium and Spain\\". San Francisco banned the sale of flavored e-liquids in 2018. They are the first city in the US to enact such a ban. In November 2018, the FDA required e-cigarette manufacturers not to sell e-cigarette products online without strict age verification. It was also requested e-cigarette suppliers to end bulk purchasing of e-cigarettes and to remove flavored e-cigarettes from stores. In January 2020, the city of San Francisco banned e-cigarette (but not traditional cigarettes). By January 2020, twenty states had implemented e-cigarettes taxes, sixteen had comprehensively banned indoor use of the product, and eight had imposed temporary restrictions on the sale of all e-cigarettes or flavored e-cigarettes. = Policy evaluation studies = Studies that examine the impact of e-cigarette taxes on use of e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes have found that e-cigarette taxes increase cigarette use across different populations (adults, children, pregnant), thus providing evidence that the two products are economic substitutes. Along the same line, another study found that e-cigarette minimum legal purchase age laws increase cigarette use among 12 to 17 years old, suggesting that e-cigarettes are displacing youth smoking rather than acting as a gateway to youth smoking. Regarding indoor vaping regulations, one study found that it increased prenatal smoking by about 0.8 percentage points had no significant impact on birth outcomes. Other countries and regions *Australia The Federal Department of Health and Ageing classifies every form of nicotine, except for replacement therapies and cigarettes, as a form of poison. In Australia, there are no laws pertaining to the regulation of e-cigarettes. Although there are a number of laws that are relevant to the regulation of poisons, therapeutic goods, and tobacco control which are applicable to e-cigarettes in certain cases. Australia is developing regulations on e-cigarettes. The sale of e-cigarettes must be registered with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) before being sold. Importation of e-cigarettes and their related products, if they claim to help people quit smoking, is illegal unless approved by the TGA. The TPA has said that there were no laws preventing the importation of e-cigarettes bought over the internet for personal use, unless prohibited by state and territory legislation. State laws in Australia's various states are a little bit conflicting. According to the Poisons Standard of 2010, inhaled nicotine is Pharmacy Only, or a Schedule 2 medication when used to help quit smoking.comlaw.gov.au \\"Australian Government ComLaw\\" Alt URL In April 2014 a court decision made it illegal to sell or supply e-cigarettes regardless of their appearance or nicotine content (even if zero) in Western Australia. Previously they were banned if they looked like cigarettes. The court ruled that the action they provided in and of itself looks like cigarettes. Precise rules in the other states vary. *Argentina: The sale, importation and manufacturing of e-cigarettes have been banned by the local regulatory authority. Its use has also been discouraged by the National Clinical Practice Guideline for Tobacco Cessation from lack of enough evidence. *Brazil: The sale, importation and advertising of any kind of e-cigarette is forbidden. The Brazilian health and sanitation federal agency, Anvisa, found the current health safety assessments about e-cigarettes to not be yet satisfactory for commercial approval eligibility. A no vaping sign in Canada. *Canada: E-cigarettes are mostly unregulated. They are technically illegal to sell, as no nicotine-containing e-fluid is approved by Health Canada, but this is generally unenforced and they are commonly available for sale Canada-wide. Vancouver bans use of e-cigarettes in public places where smoking is prohibited. Toronto bans use of e-cigarettes in city work spaces. The governing Liberals recently introduced a provincial legislation in Ontario to regulate e-cigarette devices. Local vape shops in Ontario currently trying to Fight Bill 45. The city of Red Deer bans electronic cigarette use where smoking is prohibited. *East Timor: E-cigarettes are banned. *Hong Kong: The sale and possession of nicotine-based e-cigarettes classified as a Type I Poison, is governed under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance. Sale or possession is not authorized and both are considered punishable by a fine of up to HK$100,000 and/or a prison term of 2 years. However, the law does not cover any non-nicotine inhalers. *Mexico: The Federal Commission for the Protection Against Sanitary Risks had previously forbidden the selling and promotion of non-tobacco objects that included elements generally associated with tobacco products. The ban was overturned in court on 23 September 2015. *New Zealand: E-cigarettes and nicotine vaping products are legal. *Panama: The importation, distribution and sale of e-cigarettes have been prohibited since June 2009. The Ministry of Health cites the FDA findings as their reasoning for the ban.

Clayton County, Georgia on June 15, 2020. A number of cities and counties in the United States have implemented non- discrimination laws for sexual orientation and/or gender identity. As of October 25, 2017, at least 400 cities and counties prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity for both public and private employees. Most but not all of these cities and counties are located in states that have a statewide non-discrimination law for sexual orientation and/or gender identity. The following three jurisdictions of North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas have state laws strictly prohibiting local or county LGBT discrimination ordinances within in the absence of a comparable state discrimination law. The following jurisdictions have laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in the absence of a comparable state law. Localities in bold are jurisdictions that prohibit discrimination in the public and private sector. Localities in italics are jurisdictions that prohibit discrimination in public employment only. Additionally, several circuit courts of appeals have ruled that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender identity is covered under the category of \\"sex\\" of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. These are the Second, the Sixth, the Seventh, and the Eleventh circuit courts. Sexual orientation has been established as a protected class in Indiana and, similarly, gender identity in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee, requiring heightened scrutiny in discrimination disputes. None of these states has enacted specific legislation addressing discrimination on account of sexual orientation and gender identity. Circuit Court of Appeals rulings =Sexual orientation= Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College In 2013, Kim Hively filed a lawsuit against the Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana in South Bend, arguing that she was denied promotions and let go from her job because of her sexual orientation. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit heard oral arguments in the case in November 2016 with discussion focusing on the meaning of the word \\"sex\\" in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which bans workplace discrimination based on race, religion, national origin or sex. On April 4, 2017, the Court of Appeals ruled in an 8‚Äì3 vote that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Ivy Tech subsequently stated they would not appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. This ruling creates a precedent for lower courts in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin to follow, meaning employment discrimination based on sexual orientation is now banned in these states (Illinois and Wisconsin already had laws prohibiting such discrimination). Human Rights Campaign hailed the ruling, saying: \\"Today's ruling is a monumental victory for fairness in the workplace, and for the dignity of lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans who may live in fear of losing their job based on whom they love.\\"Ruling Affirms Civil Rights Laws Protect Employees from Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation Human Rights Campaign Zarda v. Altitude Express, Inc. On February 26, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (covering Connecticut, New York and Vermont) ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits sexual orientation employment discrimination under the category of sex. Donald Zarda, who worked for Altitude Express as a skydiving instructor in New York, is gay. To avoid any discomfort his female students might feel being strapped to an unfamiliar man, Zarda would often disclose he was gay. Before one particular jump with a female student, Zarda told her that he was gay. After the skydive, the student told her boyfriend that Zarda had inappropriately touched her and disclosed his sexual orientation to excuse his behavior. The woman's boyfriend told Zarda's boss, who fired Zarda shortly thereafter. Zarda denied touching the student inappropriately and believed that he was fired solely because of his reference to his sexual orientation. The Court ruled, 10‚Äì3, that: \\"Logically, because sexual orientation is a function of sex and sex is a protected characteristic under Title VII, it follows that sexual orientation is also protected.\\" Donald Zarda died in 2014 in a base jumping accident and the case was continued by his family. The ruling did not focus on whether the merits of his case specifically, but whether sexual orientation was protected as a function of sex, and in effect protected gay workers under the Civil Rights Act. Prior to the ruling, in July 2017, the Justice Department under President Trump had unexpectedly interceded in the case, arguing in filed a friend of the court brief that Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act did not explicitly cover sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. This stance put the DOJ at odds with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. =Gender identity= Glenn v. Brumby In December 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (covering Alabama, Florida and Georgia) ruled that Vandy Beth Glenn, a transgender woman living in Georgia, had been unfairly terminated from her job at the Georgia Legislative Assembly due to her transgender status. Relying on Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins and other Title VII precedent, the Court concluded that the plaintiff was discriminated against based on her sex because she was transitioning from male to female. The Court stated that a person is considered transgender \\"precisely because of the perception that his or her behavior transgresses gender stereotypes.\\" As a result, there is \\"congruence\\" between discriminating against transgender individuals and discrimination on the basis of \\"gender-based behavioral norms.\\" \\"Because everyone is protected against discrimination based on sex stereotypes, such protections cannot be denied to transgender individuals\\", the Court ruled.Examples of Court Decisions Supporting Coverage of LGBT- Related Discrimination Under Title VII EEOC v. R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes On March 7, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (covering Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee) ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination against transgender people. It also ruled that employers may not use the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to justify discrimination against LGBT people. Aimee Stephens, a transgender woman, began working for a funeral home and presented as male. In 2013, she told her boss that she had a gender identity disorder and planned to transition. She was promptly fired by her boss who said that \\"gender transition violat[es] God's commands because a person's sex is an immutable God-given fit.\\" =Case law= Case law has been established in the following cases. Schwenk v. Hartford On February 29, 2000, citing Title VII case law, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which covers Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Guam, Hawaii, Montana, Nevada, the Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon and Washington, ruled that a transgender woman serving a prison sentence appropriately stated a claim of sex discrimination under the Gender Motivated Violence Act when filing a complaint about an assault from a prison guard.SCHWENK v. HARTFORDEEOC's Inclusion of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Under Title VII's Prohibition of Sex Discrimination and Possible Implications for Private Employers Rosa v. Parks W. Bank & Trust Co On June 9, 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (covering Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Puerto Rico and Rhode Island) ruled that Lucas Rosa, a transgender woman, could claim sex discrimination under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act when a bank denied her a loan application because of the way she was dressed. The ruling cited Title VII case law.United States Court of Appeals, First Circuit. Tovar v. Essentia Health On May 24, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (covering Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) ruled in Tovar v. Essentia Health, the case of a nurse practitioner in Minnesota claiming discrimination based on gender identity because her insurance company would not cover her transgender child under her health insurance. The court ruled that Tovar lacked standing to pursue the claims of discrimination because she could not file suit on behalf of her child. However, in its ruling the 8th Circuit wrote that \\"because the district court concluded that Tovar is not within the class of plaintiffs for whom Title VII and the MHRA create causes of action, we assume for purposes of this appeal that the prohibition of sex-based discrimination under Title VII and the MHRA encompasses protection for transgender individuals\\". Wittmer v. Phillips 66 Company In April 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled that although a woman hadn't proven she had been discriminated against for being transgender by the company Phillips 66, if that had been proven, then the woman would have \\"had a case\\" under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The judge, who had been appointed by President George H. W. Bush in 1992, cited other recent cases as shaping the final decision.

The film's sets were designed by the art director Pierre Schild. It was shot at the Saint-Maurice Studios in Paris. Plot A newlywed couple suffer tragedy when the husband is seriously injured in a car accident. Censorship In November 1939, the film was released in the U.S. by Arthur Mayer and Joseph Burstyn after a long court battle over American film censorship. Burstyn was later involved in the Miracle Decision (1952) overturning film censorship in the U.S. From IMDB: Albany, New York - Monday, January 23, 1939: \\"The French film Remous was shown Friday [January 20] to five judges of the New York State Appellate Division in proceedings in the attempt by Arthur Mayer and Joseph Burstyn to get a license to screen it in New York State. The picture has twice been denied a license, first in August 1936, when it was rejected as being \\"indecent\\", \\"immoral\\", and tending to \\"corrupt morals\\". It was again rejected in November 1937. In March 1938, it was screened for the New York Board of Regents who, on April 14, disapproved application for a license. Arthur Garfield Hays, counsel for Mayer and Burstyn at yesterday's proceedings, ridiculed the objections of Irwin Esmond and the Regents to certain scenes, pointing out that the film was French and would appeal only to an educated audience. Counsel for the Regents based his plea on the film's theme of sex-frustration, arguing that it would be unwise public policy to show it to all classes of people.\\" In November 1939, Mayer and Burstyn released the film in the U.S. as Whirlpool of Desire. Film censorship in the United States was not overturned until the U.S. Supreme Court case, Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson (the \\"Miracle Decision\\") in 1952.

Arthur Bispo do Ros√°rio (Japaratuba, Sergipe, May 14, 1909 or, according to other sources, March 16, 1911 - Rio de Janeiro, July 5, 1989) was a Brazilian outsider artist. Diagnosed with schizophrenia, he lived in a psychiatric institution in Rio de Janeiro for 50 years, where he created works of art with found objects, as part of a \\"divine mission\\". His works gained recognition among art critics when they were first displayed at the Venice Biennale in 1995. Biography Born in Japaratuba, in the state of Sergipe, Bispo do Ros√°rio joined the Navy in 1925 and later worked as a boxer and handyman. Between 1933 and 1937, he worked at the Light Department of Trams in the city of Rio de Janeiro and as a domestic worker for the Leoni family in the neighborhood of Botafogo. On the night of December 22, 1938, Bispo do Ros√°rio experienced hallucinations that led him to visit his employer, the lawyer Humberto Magalh√£es Leoni, to whom he said that he would present himself to the Candel√°ria Church. After wandering the streets of Rio, he eventually headed to the Mosteiro de S√£o Bento, where he announced to a group of monks that he was Jesus Christ, sent by God to be in charge of judging the living and the dead. Two days later he was arrested by police, recorded as an indigent and committed to the Hosp√≠cio Pedro II, the first official mental institution in Brazil. A month after his hospitalization, he was transferred to another mental institution, Col√¥nia Juliano Moreira, located in the suburb of Jacarepagu√°, under the diagnosis of \\"schizophrenic-paranoid.\\" Here he received the patient number 01662, and was to remain for over 50 years. During his stay at Col√¥nia Juliano Moreira, Bispo do Ros√°rio began to fashion works of art from different types of materials found around the institution. These works were intended to mark the passing of God on Earth, rather than as art for its own sake: his best known work is the Manto da Presenta√ß√£o (Presentation Cloak), which he intended to wear on the Day of Judgement. Bispo do Ros√°rio said of his art \\"The voices tell me to do this way\\". Common themes in his work included ships (a recurring theme due to his relationship with the Navy in his youth), banners, and household objects. Bispo do Ros√°rio died on July 5, 1989 at the Col√¥nia Juliano Moreira, after suffering a heart attack. His work was later discovered and praised by art critics, who classified it as avant-garde and compared it to the ready-mades by Marcel Duchamp.

At the time, the British music industry was largely dominated by four major record companies (EMI, Decca, Pye and Philips) who, thanks to the lack of a national popular music radio station, found it easy to dominate the airwaves by buying slots on Radio Luxembourg. Therefore, the only way independent record labels could achieve success was by concentrating on specialist genres. Kruger realised that considerable success could be gained if, rather than focusing on one specific musical genre, he instead focused on a plethora of them. Releases under the jazz, pop, R&B;, beat, soul, rockabilly, and other genres followed and Kruger started to establish Ember as a major independent force in the UK. As Kruger explained: The first major achievement and breakthrough for the label came when Kruger realised the British music fan's thirst for American music, and though the five major labels dominated the best licensing deals the US had to offer, some hot American independents did not yet have a presence. Kruger flew out to the US and did deals with, amongst others, 20th Century Fox (a major coup for an independent at the time), Sam Phillips, Harry Simeone Chorale‚Äôs ‚ÄòOnward Christian Soldiers‚Äô label and Syd Nathan, boss of King and Federal Records in Ohio. As Kruger recalled: Becoming the first British label to set up its own distribution and pressing facilities helped Ember cement their place in the industry. By 1963, Ember had built up a roster of UK artists such as Matt Monro, the Dale Sisters, Grant Tracy and the Sunsets, and the duo John Shakespeare and Ken Hawker (recording as Carter, Lewis & the Southerners). The next big break came when composer, producer and arranger John Barry left EMI to join Kruger. During his time with Ember, he scored hits with pioneering folk duo Chad & Jeremy, and \\"Christine\\" by \\"Miss X\\" (Joyce Blair), a song which referred to the Profumo scandal. As the decade wore on, the label continued to release records from across the musical spectrum, from film and TV themes such as the Liars (which established a young Nyree Dawn Porter) through to the soul 45s for which the label became renowned. These featured acts such as The Casinos, the Checkmates and Lou Lawton, Stax hitmakers the Bar-Kays, King Curtis and the Pac-keys. On the recommendation of John Abbey, who set up the subsidiary soul label Speciality where some of those previous releases first appeared, Kruger gave a debut to the man who would go on to become Ember‚Äôs biggest hit: Glen Campbell. Despite a considerable investment from Kruger, however, they struggled to achieve success, at least initially. It was around this time that the label became the first British independent label to have three of its singles at the top of the American charts. 1970s to present In the early 1970s, the label released recordings by Julie Rogers and Susan Maughan, and, through the release by Avengers actress Linda Thorson, the label proved, as they had with Twiggy a few years earlier, that she could have as much success in front of the microphone as she subsequently had away from it. In 1979, after Kruger had continued to put an impressive number of soul releases by artists such as Ed Robinson, Tony and the Tyrones and golden oldies such as Gladys Knight, as well as new albums by PJ Proby and Johnny Otis, the label, essentially becoming a victim of its own success, was wound down. By this stage, Kruger was involved with a number of other businesses in the music industry, not least becoming one of Europe‚Äôs leading concert promoters, and felt he could no longer dedicate the time to the label that he felt it deserved. In 2009, Fantastic Voyage, a subsidiary of the Future Noise record label, started releasing a series of albums focused on the various genres Ember had promoted. This was to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the first Ember release and the thirtieth anniversary of the last. In 2016, the Ember catalogue moved to Cherry Red Records in the UK. Jeffrey Kruger died in Florida in May 2014, aged 83.

Nowadays it is almost invariably made of transparent biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate, which should last several centuries under normal storage conditions, with one or two translucent matte surfaces provided by a coating. However, some older drafting films are cellulose acetate, which degrades in only a few decades due to the vinegar syndrome. Uncoated films are preferred for archival, because there is then no possibility that the coating material could deteriorate over time or react with other materials.Transparent drafting films: profiles for preservation, Susan Page, Presented at the Book and Paper specialty group poster session, AIC 24th Annual Meeting, June 10-16, 1996, Norfolk Virginia. Uncoated films require the use of an etching ink that penetrates the surface of the film.Archaeological Illustration, 1989, Lesley Adkins, Roy A. Adkins, p.18 Because non-etching ink doesn't penetrate the surface of the film the way it penetrates paper, it is often possible to remove inked lines from drafting film when drawing on it by hand; an abrasive- free vinyl drafting eraser is the preferred tool for this,Architectural Drafting and Design, Fifth Edition, Alan Jefferis, David A.

The sanctions would be directed at any government official who was involved in the mistreatment of protestors. Sanctioned officials would have their assets frozen and would not be able to travel to the United States. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The Venezuelan Human Rights and Democracy Protection Act was written and passed in reaction to the 2014 Venezuelan protests in which at least 43 people were killed and at least 835 were injured. In early 2014, a series of protests, political demonstrations, and civil unrest occurred throughout Venezuela. The protests erupted largely as a result of the high levels of criminal violence, inflation, and chronic scarcity of basic goods. The protesters claim that these are caused by the economic policies of Venezuela's government, including strict price controls, which allegedly have led to one of the highest inflation rates in the world. However, government supporters claim that government economic policy, especially that of under previous president Hugo Ch√°vez (1999-2013), significantly improved the quality of life of Venezuelans, and blame external factors for ongoing problems. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Venezuelan Human Rights and Democracy Protection Act would direct the Secretary of State to require the U.S. Permanent Representative to the Organization of American States (OAS) to use U.S. influence at the OAS to protect the Inter-American Democratic Charter, and strengthen the independent Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to protect human rights throughout the Western Hemisphere, especially in Venezuela. The bill would direct the President of the United States to impose asset blocking and U.S. exclusion sanctions against any person, including a current or former official of the government of Venezuela or a person acting on behalf of such government, who has: (1) perpetrated or is responsible for directing acts of violence or human rights abuses against individuals participating in protests in Venezuela that began on February 12, 2014; (2) directed or ordered the arrest or prosecution of a person primarily because of the person's exercise of freedom of expression or freedom of assembly in relation to such protests; (3) knowingly assisted, sponsored, or provided significant financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support of, the commission of such acts; or (4) engaged in censorship against individuals or media outlets disseminating information in relation to such protests. The bill would set forth related penalty requirements. The bill would state that U.S. exclusion sanctions shall not apply if necessary to permit the United States to comply with the Agreement regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations or other applicable international obligations. The bill would authorize the President to waive sanctions if: (1) in the U.S. national security interests, or (2) conditions in Venezuela have improved with regard to respect for peaceful protest and basic human rights. The bill would direct the President to transmit to Congress a list of persons who: (1) transfer or facilitate the transfer of goods or technologies that are likely to be used to commit serious rights abuses to Venezuela, to any entity organized under the laws of Venezuela, or to any national of Venezuela, for use in Venezuela; or (2) provide services with respect to such goods or technologies after their transfer to Venezuela. The bill would direct the Secretary to submit comprehensive strategies to Congress: (1) promoting internet and information access freedom in Venezuela, and (2) outlining U.S. support for the citizens of Venezuela in seeking free elections and the development of an independent civil society. The bill would state that it shall be U.S. policy to: (1) support efforts to identify prisoners of conscience and cases of human rights abuses in Venezuela, and (2) offer refugee status or political asylum in the United States to political dissidents in Venezuela or assist in their relocation to other countries. The bill would authorize appropriations for assistance to civil society in Venezuela. The bill would sunset this Act two years after its enactment. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on April 30, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4587 would impose sanctions against Venezuela and authorize appropriations to support civil society in that country. The bill's provisions would expire two years after enactment. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4587 would cost $7 million over the 2015-2019 period, assuming appropriation of the specified and estimated amounts. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply to this legislation because it would affect direct spending and revenues; however, CBO estimates that those effects would not be significant. The bill would authorize the appropriation of $5 million in 2015 to promote civil society in Venezuela. In recent years, the administration has spent roughly that amount each year for similar activities in Venezuela. Other provisions of H.R. 4587 would increase administrative costs of the United States Department of State and the United States Department of the Treasury. Based on information from the Administration, CBO estimates the departments would require additional appropriations of $1 million a year in 2015 and 2016. Sanctions required under H.R. 4587 would probably increase the number of people who would be denied a visa by the United States Secretary of State. Most visa fees are retained by the department and spent without further appropriation, but some fees are deposited in the Treasury as revenues. CBO estimates that implementing those sanction provisions would affect very few people and, thus, have an insignificant budgetary effect. Because the bill would prohibit certain activities involving Venezuela and subject individuals who undertake those activities to civil and criminal penalties, it could increase revenues and direct spending from the collection of penalties; however, CBO estimates that the net budgetary effect of any additional penalties would be negligible. H.R. 4587 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. H.R. 4587 would impose private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA by prohibiting certain transactions with entities associated with human rights violations in Venezuela. In addition, individuals found to be associated with the human rights violations could have their visas revoked. The cost of the mandates would be any forgone income directly related to the prohibited transactions and to the loss of visas. Based on data from the U.S. International Trade Commission, the total value of transactions that could be affected by the legislation is low. Further, CBO expects that the number of individuals in the United States that could have their visa revoked under the bill is small. Therefore, CBO estimates that the aggregate cost of the mandates would fall below the annual threshold for private-sector mandates established in UMRA ($152 million in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation). Procedural history The Venezuelan Human Rights and Democracy Protection Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on May 7, 2014 by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R, FL-27). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. The bill was passed by the House in a voice vote on May 28, 2014. Debate and discussion The bill's sponsor, Rep. Ros- Lehtinen (R-FL), said that the bill was to \\"condemn the ongoing human rights abuses being committed in Venezuela, and to answer the cries of the people of Venezuela.\\" Ros-Lehtinen also said that she was \\"pleased that the House of Representatives has acted to punish the thugs of the Maduro regime for brutally repressing and violating the human rights of those seeking to exercise their basic freedoms of speech and assembly in Venezuela.\\" Another supporter, Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX), said that Venezuela should find its own solution, but that the legislation \\"makes it clear the United States will not turn a blind eye to human rights violations.\\" Opponents of the bill, such as Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY), were concerned that the measure took a step too far. Meeks said that \\"I remain committed to doing everything in my power to support a positive outcome in that nation. But I believe vehemently that unilateral action by the United States is not the answer.\\" Meeks also argued that the bill \\"does not advance U.S. interests, it will not help the people of Venezuela and it sends the message to our regional allies that we don't care much about what they think.\\" Regional groups like UNASUR, the Caribbean Community, and the Organization of American States have all supported the government instead of the protestors. Fourteen House members wrote a letter to President Barack Obama about the bill in which they said \\"as unilateral U.S. intervention and sanctions have caused deep resentment throughout Latin America, these are not the right tools for our regional policy in instances where they lack any significant regional backing.\\" The Obama Administration testified about similar legislation in the United States Senate, indicating then that the sanctions could end up being counterproductive by giving the Venezuelan government propaganda material. One of the members of the opposition coalition against the Venezuelan government, a group called MUD, agreed, saying that \\"the government's not going to be hurt. On the contrary, they will use this to play the victim, to travel the world and talk about U.S. imperialism.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4587 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4587 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4587 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4587 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4587 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:United States‚ÄìVenezuela relations Category:Sanctions legislation ","title":"Venezuelan Human Rights and Democracy Protection Act"},{"id":"42878266","text":"Clanculus spadiceus is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Trochidae, the top snails.

At the time of its release, the GH4 was notable for being the world's first Mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera with 4K Video recording capability.  Features  The GH4 is largely physically similar to its predecessor, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH3, adding only a locking mode dial and more detailed rear LCD screen and Electronic Viewfinder. The emphasis of the camera is the video with Venus Engine IX processor allow for 4K video and 12 fps continuous shooting. As a 4K video camera, it can be categorized as a pro-level video camera that can record in Cinema 4K mode (4096 x 2160) or standard 4K-UHD (3840 x 2160) using IPB compression in 100Mbit/s. In Full 1080p HD there are two options, 200Mbit/s in ALL-Intra compression, or 100Mbit/s with no recording time limit. The camera also provides .mov, mp4, AVCHD Progressive, and AVCHD video formats at a variety of frame rates according to the usage; and options for VFR (Variable Frame Rate) or Time Lapse/Stop Motion Animation without the need for post- production processing. Autofocus needs only 0.07 seconds with the 'Depth from Defocus' autofocus system. The camera also has Wi-Fi with NFC, PC sync port, highlight and shadow control, and a 'silent mode' which uses the electronic shutter only. Video features added to the DMC-GH4 include Focus peaking, zebra overlay, luminance level adjustment, and cinema gamma presets. DMW-YAGH Interface Along with the GH4, Panasonic also released the YAGH interface unit, a camera-attached device to increase input and output options for the GH4. The YAGH connects to the GH4 via attachment screw on the bottom of the camera, as well as a sliding mechanism which plugs into the camera's HDMI port on the side. The interface contains two 3-pin XLR Connector inputs, which are controlled by a pair of preamplifiers inside the unit, offering phantom power, more control over input gain levels and microphone choice, and input metering via LED meters on the interface. The YAGH also provides a timecode input for multi-device synchronization. For outputs, the YAGH offers four BNC connector terminals for Serial Digital Interface use with outboard recorders and monitors. In addition, a full-size HDMI port is also present. These video outputs differ from the camera's native recording in that they offer a 10-bit 4:2:2 signal rather than the camera's internal 8-bit 4:2:0. The YAGH interface is not powered by the camera, instead relying on 12-volt DC power provided by a separate battery or power supply using a four-pin XLR type connector.

It is now in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain in Madrid, Spain.  Background and Context  This cylindrical carved box was commissioned by the Umayyad caliph Al-Hakam II in 964 CE for Subh, his concubine, and the mother of the princes Abd al-Rahman and Hish√¢m and is linked to the palatine ivory workshops of Madinat al-Zahra. It was intended to hold cosmetics, jewelry, or perfume containers. This portable piece represents the sophistication of the ruling class during the Caliphate of Cordoba. During this period, the Umayyads in Spain, or the al- Andalus, were both competing with the Abbasid society in Baghdad, and attempting to reclaim the power that they held from Damascus during the Umayyad period. In Cordoba, the Umayyads commissioned notable architectural developments and luxury goods, including textiles and ivory carvings, such as this pyxis, the Pyxis of Zamora. The iconography found within the carvings on the surfaces of many of the pyxides created during this period reinforced the ideas of the Umayyad political superiority over the Abbasids. This object, created in the flourishing intellectual city center of Cordoba during the peak of Hispano-Umayyad art demonstrates the refinement of the Cordoba Caliphate.  Methods and Techniques  Ivory carving was a widespread practice in the Mediterranean world, beginning before the time of the Roman empire. Ivory was expensive due to the distance between sub-sahara Africa and India, where elephant tusk was procured, and the Mediterranean, where it was carved. The Umayyad Caliphate brought the pyxis carving tradition to Spain as they took control of the peninsula in the 8th century AD. There is no evidence of Ivory box or pyxides carvings in Spain before Umayyad rule. Elephant Ivory The quality of the craft of pyxides was vital due to the expense of ivory. Among Islamic, Christian, and Roman carvings, a sign of good workmanship was a lack of tool marks. The carving of small objects such as pyxides took precision and time which also added to the overall price. The Pyxis of Zamora displays this quality of work through the deep-relief interlacing pattern and the lack of any visible tool marks. These carving techniques are seen in other pyxides created in the same period, such as the Pyxis of al-Mughira. The price and rarity of pyxides made them accessible only to the royal class. Cylindrical pyxides, such as the Pyxis of Zamora, were created using the natural curvature and hollowness of the thickest part of the elephant tusk. Cylindrical pyxides were less prone to warping than rectangular boxes because of the preserved strength of the tusk in a circular shape. The unbroken surface of the Pyxis of Zamora allowed for unified compositional decoration without edges in the ivory. The interlacing effect of the decoration, in conjunction with the Arabic inscription on the lid (detailing the patronage and gifting of the pyxis), indicated that the receiver of the pyxis was meant to turn the object around in their hands to fully appreciate the craftsmanship. The decoration of the Pyxis of Zamora also encouraged the viewer to open the container since the expensive exterior mirrored the precious material held inside (often perfume or jewels).  Symbolism and Interpretations  = The Winged Motif = The Pyxis of Zamora features many depictions of spread wings within its arabesque decoration. The winged motif gained popularity during its use in Sasanian culture. Extended wings symbolized power and religion, as the motif was often seen on the crowns of Sasanian kings as well as on Sasanian seals. This Sasanian trend later influenced the royal decorative arts of the Umayyad period, resulting in the repeated use of the winged motif on luxury goods. = The Peacock = Peacock The image of the peacock is repeated four times in the central section of the Pyxis of Zamora. In the context of medieval Islam, peacocks were viewed as having apotropaic powers. This view was the result of varying Islamic beliefs of the bird. Some Islamic interpreters believed the peacock mated asexually, thus associating the bird with purity. There were other interpretations from Arabic naturalists, who believed peacocks could detect poison. This led to the common medicinal use of peacock feathers. Popular legends told of the bird's ability to kill snakes, religiously alluding to the peacock's ability to avert the evil influences of the devil. This gave the bird a connection to the Islamic conception of Paradise. The peacock continued to be an important image in the Islamic world, as feathers or images of peacocks were often used in a royal context in imitation of Persian traditions. = The Gazelle = Several images of the gazelle surround the peacocks depicted on the Pyxis of Zamora. This history of the meaning of the gazelle began in pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, in which the gazelle was often depicted as having magical qualities.

With the shoreline teeming with marine life, fishing was one of the main occupations of the locals. Other sources of livelihood included farming and salt-making. Las Pi√±as City was once dubbed as the ‚ÄúSaltbed of the Philippines\\". The Irasan or the Las Pi√±as Salt Bed in Barangay Pulanglupa, which is part of the Las Pi√±as Historical Project, was formally opened on December 13, 2005. The technical assistance came from the Pangasinan State University. History solar evaporation of water from the brine of the sea, circa 1940 =Revitalization of Irasan= By the 18th century, salt-making technology was introduced in the locality using solar bed dryers. Over time, hundreds of hectares surrounding the old town were converted into salt beds. Later, clay tiles or gibak were brought down from Vigan to line the salt beds. This prevented the salt from coming into contact with the earthen ground. This allowed the salt produced to become white as snow and established the reputation of Las Pi√±as as a salt-making center as well into the 20th century. Representative Cynthia Aguilar Villar sought the assistance of the Department of Agriculture in rebuilding the salt farms. However, the proposal was turned down due to incapability of the agency to provide technology needed for the job. She also had acquaintances from salt-making experts in a forum held at Pangasinan State University. This paved the way for building linkages between former Senator Manuel Villar and Representative Cynthia Villar of Las Pi√±as City and the administration of Pangasinan State University - eventually launching the Solar Salt Demo-Project. On the other hand, the construction of Las Pi√±as Fish Port was immediately assisted by the former Department of Agriculture Secretary Leony Montemayor - who happens to be a colleague of her husband, Manuel Villar. The fish port was constructed at Bernabe Compound in Barangay Pulanglupa 1. At present, some Las Pi√±eros, who are fishermen and clam and mussels harvesters, from Barangays E. Aldana, Pulang-lupa 1 and Daniel Fajardo still uses the facility. Description Tableau marker located at Bulwagang Ezekiel Moreno The salt bed, located on a 3,000 square-meter property in Barangay Pulang Lupa I, can produce an average of 45 to 50 kilos of rock salt daily. During harvest time, the scenery of Las Pi√±as was filled with small pyramids of white crystals. The salt was graded and classified as either tertia, segunda and primera. Tertia salt had the most impurities and was darkest in color. This salt was used with dry ice to preserve ice cream. Segunda salt was used to preserve fresh fish. The wholesale seafood trading communities in Navotas and Malabon were the main buyers of segunda salt. But Las Pi√±as was most known for its primera or first class salt which is fabled to be as white as snow. Primera salt was distributed to all public markets of Manila and used to flavor fine dishes. =Iras Intsik= The technique known as iras Intsik or solar evaporation method was practiced to achieve superior quality of salt. Chinese traders who came regularly to Paranaque taught this technique to the early Filipinos. Even until the 1970s it was a familiar sight, most especially in the summer months, to see mounds of salt being harvested at the salt beds. During the rainy season these salt beds became converted into fishponds. However, today one neither sees much of these salt beds nor the fishponds for they occupy only three percent of the total land area of Las Pi√±as. Instead, they are now localized at the lower areas along Manila Bay as well as along the Las Pi√±as River. Present situation The site is currently built mostly with residential structures with a number of commercial establishments. The northwest side of the salt beds is the current Las Pi√±as Dump Site, and the south and southeastern sides are composed of residential/commercial area. The increasing population needed affordable housing, putting pressure to convert many of the salt beds into residential subdivisions. Pollution from industrial and domestic sewerage draining into Manila Bay destroyed the pristine waters which had been the salt industry's primary ingredient. The reclamation of the bay area and the subsequent construction of the Coastal Road disrupted salt production. The dredging and construction work prevented fishermen from going out to sea. Bulk of the salt produced began falling into the lower priced segunda and tertia categories. Salt imported from other countries like China and India were offered at lower prices. These developments brought an end to the salt production industry, which is now just a memory of Las Pi√±as‚Äô past.

His skills as both a farmer, municipal worker and as an army officer were well regarded. Despite having to travel miles on foot he visited the Sami people three times.Erik Viktor Almquist 5., Nordisk familjebok, 681-682, 1904, retrieved 27 May 2014. Google translate. In 1864 he was appointed the Governor of V√§sterbotten succeeding Gustaf Munthe. The following year he donated land in Ume√• to create the park that became known as D√∂belns park. Maria Magdalena Mathsdutter as she appeared in an 1864 newspaper In 1866 he met Maria Magdalena Mathsdotter who contacted him via his half brother Carl Jonas Love Almqvist. Mathsdotter had successfully petitioned the king two years earlier to improve Sami education in Lapland. She had captured the public's imagination by skiing the length of Sweden to ask a favour of the King. As a result, she had received international support for founding schools and improving education in Lapland. In 1866 she travelled south again and met Almquist.Hon skidade till Stockholm f√∂r barnen, Lilian O. Montmar, Sapmi, 2012, retrieved 27 May 2014 Almquist took up Mathsdotter's case and starting in 1871 the law was changed to establish better rights for the Sami people. Almquist became a member of parliament in 1867. This was a time when there was a famine and a severe shortage of food in V√§sterbotten. He served from 1867 to 1869 in the first chamber before joining the second chamber in 1870. He introduced two bills that won approval whilst he represented Harnosand, Ume√•, Lule√• and Pite√•. The first made the grazing rights of the Sami people clear and the other related to forest management. Whilst he was governor there were significant problems with the ownership of timber as the saw mills seized power. The methods reported at Baggb√∂le sawmill in 1866-7 created a scandal.

Reyes frequently mixes Western esotericism with Olmec beliefs of his ancestors. This admixture is also seen in his artwork, notably including the sculpture Southland. Biography Reyes joined the Sherman 27th Street Grant Hill Park gang when he was a teenager in order to save his father's life after a skirmish at a local market. Upon graduating high school, Reyes opened San Diego's first vegan/vegetarian Mexican restaurant, Pok√©z, with his father. After running the restaurant for eighteen years, and after his father's death, he sold Pok√©z to his younger brother. In 2011, he wrote and published Living Dangerously, a roman √† clef about his life as a gang member, and toured California to promote the book. =Music= Looking for a more direct way to interact with an audience, in 2011, Reyes formed his first band, Baptism of Thieves, followed by Vampire. With the break-up of those bands, he created Prayers (credited under the pseudonym Leafar Seyer) with Tijuana-born Dave Parley. He also performs solo as Nite Ritual. Prayers released their debut album SD KILLWAVE in 2013, with two videos, \\"From Dog to God\\" directed by Chukk Nastee aka Charles Christ and \\"Ready to Bleed\\". Prayers then released an EP entitled, GOTHIC SUMMER, in mid-2014. Prayers opened for the Cult during that band's 2014 tour. Reyes conceived Prayers' video for the song \\"Gothic Summer,\\" the title track of their first EP, released in May 2014, which won the 2015 San Diego Film Festival Award for Best Music Video. Gavin Filipiak, the video's director also won for Best Editing in the music video category. On May 26, 2015, Prayers released the title track of the Travis Barker-produced second album, \\"Young Gods\\" as a video single, through Noisey/Vice Magazine. In the song, he references Aleister Crowley: The lyrics \\"do what thy will shall be the law\\" is an homage to the English occultist's \\"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,\\" while Crowley's Magical formula for Tetragrammaton is explicated in the song's final lines. =Art= He also began to focus on his artwork, showing in San Diego. He has since shown in Los Angeles at Coagula Curatorial with John Fleck and John Roecker as part of the successful \\"Two Johns and a Whore\\" group show. Reyes developed and then left Diamond Dogs, a group of retired gang members with an interest in art and music, as an outlet for young men looking for an alternative to gang life. Diamond Dogs provides outreach, emotional and artistic support in a positive environment while stressing the importance of community and family. In January 2015, Reyes was included in a special exhibition at the LA Art Show, \\"Dark Progressivism: Metropolis Rising\\" which included important Southern Californian Chicano, Cholo and street artists. \\"Dark Progressivism: Metropolis Rising\\" was the first international showing of this uniquely Southern California genre. Reyes's sculpture Southland debuted at Lancaster Museum of Art and History (MOAH) as part of \\"Dark Progressivism: The Built Environment\\" which ran November 22, 2017 through January, 2018. The exhibition included many important, influential, and internationally known artists from Southern California, many of whom, like Reyes, created new work for the museum show. Prayers videos were incorporated as part of the overall installation. On February 24, 2018, his first solo art show in several years opened at These Days, in downtown Los Angeles, dovetailing with the release of Prayers' video, \\"One 9 One 3\\". Personal life Reyes met Kat Von D in 2016, when Von D appeared in a video per Reyes' request. Reyes also wrote the song \\"Black Leather\\" for Von D, who provided vocals for the duets and additional tracks. The song is on the album 'Baptism of Thieves'. Von D is featured in the video for the song. Reyes married Kat Von D legally on February 21, 2018 at Beverly Hills Courthouse. A wedding ceremony for family and friends was held on June 2, 2018. Their son, Leafar Von Drachenberg Reyes, was born on November 29, 2018, in their Los Angeles home. Reyes has a daughter (b.1994) from a previous relationship.

His mother was Blanche of Naples, the second of his father's four wives. As the king's eldest son, James was not only an infante but also heir apparent to the Crown of Aragon, a realm stretching from north-eastern Spain to Sardinia and Corsica. He is best known for his unexpected decision to renounce his marriage and right to the throne and become a monk.  Youth  When Queen Blanche's pregnancy became apparent in the spring of 1296, King James II sent for a respected physician from Paris, who helped the queen deliver Infante James on 29 September. King James personally oversaw the health of the heir apparent to the Crown of Aragon, even after the infante reached adulthood; he appointed his son's physicians and expected them to regularly report to him. Even the infante's chamberlain was a former royal surgeon. James was appointed procurator general already in his youth, with the task of handling judicial affairs in the name of his father. In 1313, he survived severe fever.  Marriage controversy  James's engagement to Eleanor of Castile was agreed upon in December 1308 at Monreal de Ariza. The union was of great importance, as the one-year-old infanta was the only child of King Ferdinand IV. Eleanor moved to Aragon in 1312, to be raised as its future queen. James, however, was notoriously unpredictable. In the spring of 1318, aged 22, he announced to his father that he wished to break off the engagement and renounce his right to the crown so that he could take holy orders, despite never before having shown interest in monastic life. The infuriated king tried unsuccessfully to dissuade him. In August, the infante came down with an abscess, from which he suffered throughout the autumn and into the winter. He used it as an excuse not to visit his father, which further worsened their relationship. The marriage went ahead despite the bridegroom's vehement opposition. It was celebrated on 5 October 1319 in Gandesa, but James refused to consummate it. At the time of the wedding, the bride was only 12 years old, while James was 23.  Cloistered life  The king eventually gave in to his son's demands. The renunciation was ratified in the presence of an assembly of noblemen at the Monastery of Saint Francis in Tarragona on 22 December. The marriage, unconsummated, was easily annulled. James entered the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, only to leave it later to join the local Order of Montesa. Father and son's relationship became increasingly strained following the renunciation, with the younger James's instability and licentiousness continuously troubling the king. On the death of their father in 1327, the crown passed to James's brother, the freshly widowed Alfons IV. Alfons proceeded to marry Eleanor, James's former wife, in 1329. James died in July 1334.

An avid collector of traditional stories, he became Secretary to the Ossianic Society of Glasgow University in the mid-1850s. Ill health had prevented him taking up employment as a Minister when he was initially approved to preach by the Presbytery of Glasgow in 1858 and later after he was appointed to Tiree by the Duke of Argyll in 1861, parishioners objected to his manner of preaching. Several of the anecdotes he amassed were published in magazines and, just before his death, work began on collating the first of four compendiums of the tales; three were published a few years after his death. He was fluent in several languages, including Scottish Gaelic, and transcribed the legends precisely as dictated by the narrators. Early life and education John Gregorson Campbell was born near Loch Linnhe at Kingairloch, Argyll in 1836, the fourth child and second son of Helen MacGregor and Captain Campbell, an officer for the ship Cygnet. A short memoir, published in 1895 and based on information from Gregorson Campbell's sister, states a Bean Sh√¨th, or fairy washerwoman as Gregorson Campbell defined it, had cast a spell on his father's ancestors proclaiming \\"they shall grow like the rush and wither like the fern\\". The family moved to Appin in about 1839, where the local parochial school provided Gregorson Campbell's education until he was ten years old. He then attended a higher school in Glasgow before moving on to the University of Glasgow. Career Law was the subject Gregorson Campbell chose to study after completing his education but his primary interest was folklore, a topic that fascinated him from his college days. In the mid-1850s he was appointed Secretary to the Glasgow University Ossianic Society. He secured a licence to preach from the Presbytery of Glasgow in 1858 but was unable to commence work as a clergyman at that time owing to ill health. His recuperation was spent beginning his collection of folklore stories. When appointed as clergyman at the Free Church united parishes of Tiree and Coll by the Duke of Argyll in early 1861, objections were initially raised by some members of the Tiree congregation who found Gregorson Campbell's sermons boring, uninspiring and \\"devoid of fervour\\". The Presbytery upheld two of the three main complaints, but an appeal was made to the Synod. Concerns had also been expressed that his health was insufficiently robust to serve the needs and challenges of the Tiree parish. The appeal was heard by the General Assembly on 31 May 1861 with Gregorson Campbell's defence arguing that the main thrust of the complaints was actually founded on the congregation's desire to have their own preferred minister appointed. The motion was not upheld and Gregorson Campbell became the minister of both parishes, a position he held for thirty years. Folklore collections Interest in mythology and folklore gained momentum in the last quarter of the 19th century, probably fuelled by the contentious debates surrounding the authenticity of the Ossian poems published by James Macpherson during the 1760s. Gregorson Campbell continued to build on the collection he started during his period of recuperation around 1858, preserving the traditional tales as quoted at the time. The folklorist John Francis Campbell (1822‚Äì85), also known as Campbell of Islay, had his first mythology books published in 1860 and he corresponded with Gregorson Campbell. Both men were fluent in several languages, including Scottish Gaelic, and their letters discuss the variations in the folk tales, with Campbell of Islay stating: \\"I have about 16 versions of one story in Gaelic, and no two have the same name.\\" Gregorson Campbell had his own style of collating legends, meticulously transcribing the stories as dictated by the individual storytellers, and only rarely interspersing tales with his own comments. Christian ministers in Scotland differed in their attitudes towards the traditional beliefs and myths perpetuated by their parishioners, and were often dismissive of what they considered to be superstition and paganism, but Gregorson Campbell persisted in enthusiastically adding to his collection throughout the late 1800s. He was concerned that the intolerance shown by some of his fellow collectors towards the illiterate Gaelic-speaking storytellers and those who believed in the myths would result in the loss of a valuable resource, as he regarded the narrators as having \\"powers of mind of a highest order\\". =Published work= An illustration from Gregorson Campbell's first published compendium of traditional tales and verses, 1891 Traditional tales collected by Gregorson Campbell were first published in the inaugural edition of the quarterly periodical the Scottish Celtic Review in March 1881. Reproduced in Gaelic and translated on the following pages in English, it was entitled \\"How the great Tuairisgeul was put to death\\" and told how the son of the King of Ireland went to a hunting hill and sought the answer to the death of the Great Tuairisgeul. Further legends from his collection were included in the next three volumes of the review. The Gaelic Society of Inverness published some of the tales, also given in Gaelic with an English translation, from 1888 until 1892. The first of these in 1888, \\"Sir Olave O'Corn\\", also involved a King of Ireland and included some explanatory notes from Gregorson Campbell. Celtic Magazine and Highland Monthly were two other journals that published some of his folklore. Some of these were reprinted in the first compendium of Gregorson Campbell's collection, The Fians, a set of traditional tales and verses about combat printed as part of the Argyllshire series of books in 1891. Death and legacy Gregorson Campbell's health deteriorated in the last years of his life, especially after the death of his mother Helen at the Tiree manse in 1890; he died on 22 November 1891 before seeing the final printed edition of The Fians. Alfred Nutt, fellow folklorist and publisher, chronicled details of Gregorson Campbell's life as an introduction to the second compilation of Gregorson Campbell's collection of myths, Clan Traditions and Popular Tales of the Western Highlands and Islands, published in 1895. Two other books were published posthumously: Superstitions of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland in 1900, and Witchcraft and Second Sight in the West Highlands the following year. Richard Dorson, American author and director of the Folklore Institute at Indiana University, describes Gregorson Campbell as worthy of a \\"front rank among Celtic folklorists\\" and Sophia Kingshill, author and folklorist, felt his writing was \\"vivid and engaging\\". Contemporary praise was not entirely universal; an anonymous review of Superstitions of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland included in The Scottish Antiquary, Or, Northern Notes & Queries (now The Scottish Historical Review) in 1901 described the work as \\"a book of considerable pretension\\" and stated it was in need of proofreading, citing several printing errors.

Its then self-declared goals were to re-establish the honor of Malawi, its legitimate place in the Organisation of African Unity and in the United Nations and especially to secure that Malawi would play an active role in the advancement of the African revolution and international solidarity. Cover picture of Kuchanso, the political manifest of the Socialist League of Malawi Foundation and Political Leadership Documented information about this party is rare; it was not only founded in exile but also ceased to exist there. However, beside the self-declaration quoted above a self-portrayal of LESOMA from the estate of one of the members of its steering committee, Mahoma Mwaungulu, further states that its emergence was the result of a dispute in Tanzania between Yatuta Chisiza, who had studied in China, and Masauko Chipembere yet in the second half of the 1960th.SAPMO-BArchiv, DZ 8/186, \\"Die sozialistische Liga Malawis\\" Both were former ministers in the first Malawian cabinet who had to escape from their newly independent home country because of the violent repressions ordered by Hastings Banda following the Cabinet Crisis of 1964. After the dispute with Chipembere, Chisiza decided to start a guerilla campaign in Malawi with less than 20 men.Baker 2001: 279 ff Of the five survivors, two later belonged to the steering committee of LESOMA. Chisiza, who also died in the guerilla campaign, was followed by Attati Mpakati as the new head of LESOMA. Files of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) mention his academic formation in the Soviet Union.;SAPMO-BArchiv, DZ 8/186, ‚ÄûDie sozialistische Liga Malawis‚Äú however, a British newspaper article speaks of studies in Moscow, Sweden and even the Federal Republic of Germany.The Guardian, 12-24-1979 Like his precursor, Mkapati was first severely injured by a letter bomb sent from Banda in 1979 to Mozambique and later, after having left Zambia in 1982 due to the pressure Hastings Banda put on the Zambian government, felt victim of another strike in Zimbabwe in 1983. It is suspected that yet before Hastings Banda had put similar pressure on the Tanzania of Julius Nyerere to force LESOMA moving its headquarter from Dar es Salaam to another country. Internal Structure The party seemed to have been formed in its majority by exiles from the Northern part of Malawi. This led to internal critic documented in a letter sent to Mwaungulu by another Malawian who, during the time the letter was written, studied in Sweden and met with a high ranked LESOMA member in Norway in 1985 with whom he talked about that matter. Another critic raised by him was the complete absence of women in the steering committee. A German specialist on Malawian political history roughly estimates that the total number of LESOMA members was several thousands.Meinhardt 1997: 98 He also regards LESOMA as the most important Malawian party opposed to the dictatorship of Hastings Banda.Meinhardt 1993: 61 International Solidarity and Political Legacy From 1975 until 1978 LESOMA received some support from the GDR. This support included a one-year journalistic training in the GDR of two members of LESOMA and the printing of 1500 copies of Kuchanso, a political journal used for propaganda in the Frontline States and Malawi.Pampuch 2013: 157 Two other socialist countries said to have supported LESOMA are the Soviet Union and Cuba. The party existed until 1991 when LESOMA, together with two other Malawian opposition parties, formed the United Front for Multiple Democracy. Arguably the greatest achievement of LESOMA is that its mere existence rewrites Malawian history; as the most radical party of the deterritorialized Malawian opposition under the Western sponsored dictatorship of Hastings Banda it links Malawi to the African struggle against Apartheid and Neocolonialism during the Cold War.

Thus the ‚ÄúBlue Diamonds‚Äù became 6TFS aerobatic team and the ‚ÄúRed Aces‚Äù became the 7TFS aerobatic team. After its successful performance in the Aviation week at the Manila International Airport it drew raves from thousands of Boy Scouts and the people of Pangasinan during the Boy Scout Jamboree held there. The squadron used to have then F-86 Sabre jets as their main asset. With the use of the F-8H Crusader as primary aircraft, the Red Aces temporarily disbanded in 1974. When the S-211 jets came around, the team was reorganized in 1996. Today, the team is very much in demand in performing to the public. On several occasions it became the regular main attraction of the International Hot Air Balloon Festival at Clark Air Base, Pampanga. Merging with the Golden Sabres With the use of the Vought F-8 Crusader as primary aircraft and the retirement of the North American F-86 Sabre, the Red Aces temporarily ceased to exist in the 1974. The team was merged with the ‚ÄúGolden Sabres‚Äù team into the ‚ÄúSabres‚Äù aerobatic team. The ‚ÄúRed Aces‚Äù were later re-established in 1996, this time flying with five Aermacchi S-211.

This reflected a change from a primarily US led and staffed mission to one that encompassed many other countries within the larger NATO training mission in Afghanistan. NATC-A was replaced by the Train, Advise, Assist Command ‚Äì Air, or TAAC-Air in January 2015 as the NATO campaign in Afghanistan transitioned to the Resolute Support Mission. Mission The NATC-A mission was to \\"set the conditions for a professional, fully independent and operationally capable Afghan 'air force' that meets the security requirements of Afghanistan today ... and tomorrow.\\" Since it has been established, NATC-A has worked to rebuild and modernize the Afghan Air Force and served as the air component of the US-led, international NATO Training Mission Afghanistan. NATC-A worked to develop the Afghan Air Force (AAF) and the Afghan National Police (ANP) Air Interdiction Unit / Special Mission Wing to provide aviation support to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIROA). In turn, the AAF primarily supported the Afghan National Army while the ANP's Air Interdiction Unit supported counter-narcotics and logistics support missions. Initially NATC-A worked on four lines of operation to build airmen, aircraft, facilities and the institution of the AAF. As the AAF matured, these effort evolved to strengthen the AAF institution, build AAF resource stewardship, forge a culture of safe standards, and advance AAF-led mission success. Contributing Countries NATO and non-NATO countries contributing personnel to NATC-A include Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Mongolia, Portugal, Ukraine, United Arab Emirate, United Kingdom and the United States. Locations Most of the NATC-A headquarters staff was co-located and daily worked with the AAF headquarters staff to train and advise them at Kabul International Airport. The remaining staff was located at Camp Eggers (in downtown Kabul) to facilitate coordination and AAF development with NTM-A and the Afghan Ministry of Defense. Since the United States originally contributed the most of the personnel and the NATC-A Commanding General was also dual-hatted as the 438th Air Expeditionary Wing Commander, NATC-A (and CAPTF) was organized along the US Air Force wing structure. There are three subordinate groups, the 438th Air Expeditionary Advisory Group at Kabul International Airport; the 738th Air Expeditionary Advisory Group at Kandahar International Airfield; and 838th Air Expeditionary Advisory Group at Shindand Air Base. Additionally, there were smaller detachments throughout Afghanistan. These locations mirror the locations of three AAF wings (Kabul Air Wing, Kandahar Air Wing and Shindand Air Wing) and geographically separated AAF units NATC-A trained, advised and equipped. Green On Blue Attacks On April 27, 2011 nine NATC-A members were killed when one of the AAF members turned his weapon on the NATO advisors. They were Lt Col Frank Bryant, Maj Jeff Ausborn, Maj Dave Brodeur, Maj Phil Ambard, Maj Ray Estelle, Maj Charles Ransom, Capt Nate Nylander, MSgt Tara Jacobs Brown and LTC Jim McLaughlin (Ret). While it will never be fully understood why this attack occurred, this changed the dynamic of the advising mission. Since then, some NATO personnel fulfill the role of a \\"guardian angels\\" to watch over others as train and work with their Afghan counterparts and NATO rules of engagement have evolved to increase personnel security. Additionally, the Afghan Ministry of Defense instituted a more rigorous process of vetting AAF personnel including biometric testing and establishing \\"counter-infiltration\\" units to root out possible Taliban agents or sympathizers. Significant Achievements On November 28, 2012, the commanders of the Afghan Air Force and NATC-A signed a strategic flightplan. . The strategy prioritizes efforts along key transitional and operational goals: ¬∑ A strong, professional Afghan Air Force that successfully leads its missions and personnel ¬∑ Effective AAF resource management and stewardship ¬∑ A culture of safe and effective aviation, maintenance and support ¬∑ Afghan planned, led, and coordinated operations Future The continuation and end of the NATC-A mission is dependent upon two conditions: the successful development of AAF capabilities and the approval of a defense and security agreement between GIROA and countries participating in the NATC-A mission.

She played in vaudeville at an early age, and later starred in musical comedies on Broadway such as Little Jessie James (1923). Early years Nan Halperin was born in Odessa, Russia, in 1898, and moved with her family to the USA in 1900. They settled in Minneapolis. Her parents were Samuel Halperin, a confectioner, and Rebeka Rose Halperin. She had two brothers and two sisters. Her sister Sophie sometimes came with Nan on her tours. Although her family was Jewish, they sent her to a Catholic school for her education, the Holy Angels Academy. There she learned to sing and play the piano. As a child she appeared in local stage productions from the age of six, including starring in Alice in Wonderland. Vaudeville Halperin appeared in vaudeville at the age of fifteen, impersonating a child. She performed in stock companies throughout the western United States and Mexico. Nan Halperin married the songwriter and vaudeville producer William Barr Friedlander, who composed all the songs she used in her act. At one time she was the soubrette in Freidlander's musical comedy company playing Forty- five Minutes from Broadway while Jean Weil (mother of the future film director Henry Hathaway) was the prime donna. They were based in San Francisco and touring the Pacific coast. Companies often went broke while on tour, and most of the players had a diamond ring they could pawn if needed so they could get back to San Francisco. They would redeem it when they got another job. Halperin became a singing comedian who satirized the manners of the typical American woman. She was one of the first women to cut her hair into a bob. Only high, she wore high heels to look taller on stage. Halperin led a group of women who presented the skit Nan Halperin and Her Suffragettes. This was a very successful tab show produced by her husband. Nan Halperin's first Broadway appearance was with Emma Carus in A Broadway Honeymoon. In February 1915 she played as a headliner at the Palace Theatre on Broadway. Sheet music cover. The songs by William B. Friedlander are from Halperin's five stages of girlhood cycle. In 1916 Halperin received a three-year contract from the United Booking Office, the first vaudeville performer to gain such a contract, in which she would be directly managed by Edward Franklin Albee II. In 1916 Halperin began to perform a burlesque \\"song cycle\\" in which she depicted the five stages of girlhood, including a child, a bridesmaid and a \\"blas√© divorc√©e.\\" The New York Dramatic Mirror of 21 December 1918 called her performance \\"dramatic satire effectively done.\\" In 1919 she began to perform a song cycle where she acted as a reluctant debutante whose parents make her wear \\"too many swell clothes ‚Ä¶ all to catch just one lone man.\\" By 1919 she was one of the highest paid female performers in vaudeville. Broadway Halperin starred in the musical comedy The Frivolities of 1919 and in the drama The Girl in the Stage Box. Between 13 April and 1 July 1922 Halperin headlined with Eddie Cantor, J. Harold Murray and Lew Hearn in the revue Make It Snappy, which ran for about 90 performances at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway. On 6 July 1922 she opened with Lew Hearn, Georgie Price and Valeska Suratt in the revue Spice of 1922, also at the Winter Garden. Halperin starred in the musical farce Little Jessie James, which opened on 15 August 1923 at the Longacre Theatre in New York. The show ran from mid-August through the whole of the 1923-24 season. Little Jessie James was the biggest hit of the season. Despite its name it was not a western but was set in an apartment looking over Central Park. Nan Halperin and Jay Velie starred, supported by Miriam Hopkins and Allen Kearns . The show was low-cost, with a single set and only eight chorus girls. In this show Halperin and Jay Velie introduced the song I Love You by Harlan Thompson and Harry Archer. I Love You was the biggest hit of all the songs from that season's musicals. Later career Halperin returned to vaudeville in the later 1920s. She also regularly spoke and sang on radio, where she enacted famous historical women from Lucrezia Borgia to Martha Washington. In June 1932 Haplerin was headliner at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. By then, as she told the Los Angeles Examiner, vaudeville performers had to \\"compete with the greatest stars in the world, through talking motion pictures.\\" She continued to play her routines in movie theaters between features in the 1930s. She ended her professional stage career in 1934. Halperin divorced her first husband William Barr Friedlander, and married Ben Thomson on 21 December 1927. After Thomson died she married Edgar D. Gould on 4 January 1934. Nan Halperin died on 30 May 1963 on Long Island, New York.

L. fructivorans is mainly produces lactic acid. Once the microbe metabolizes sugars into lactic acids, the foods and beverages develop the sour taste that is characteristic of fermented foods and beverages.Nam, S.-H., S.-H. Choi, A. Kang, K. S. Lee, D.-W. Kim, R. N. Kim, D.-S. Kim, and H.-S. Park. While there are several types of Lactobacillus that are able to convert sugars into lactic acid and CO2, most are unable to survive alcoholic fermentation and will die off in this type of environment. L. fructivorans is one of the few species that successfully survives alcoholic fermentation and continues to grow and engage in cell multiplication afterwards.Dicks, L. M. T., and A. Endo. p. 81.‚Äù It therefore plays an important role in the production of fermented beverages such as wine, beer, sake and cider, yogurt, cheese, kimchi, pickled vegetables, sourdough bread and sauerkraut.

The Royal Family granted Horace the Blue Mountain property in the Crown Colony of Jamaica, in 1780. The Earl discovered that the property's elevation was ideal for growing strawberries and named the property \\"Strawberry Hill\\".

The minaret was built at the same time.  History  In 1831 and 1832 the mosque was partially restored by order of imam al-Mahdi Abdallah, the son of al-Mutawakkil Ahmad, as evidenced by the inscription in the prayer hall. The Talha Mosque was built 23 years after the construction of the Al-Bakiriyya Mosque and uses some of the same stylistic features. Due to the small size of the prayer hall and the short minaret, the Talha Mosque seems quite appropriate to the general style of Sana'a mosques among the narrow streets of Old City District. But, like the Al-Bakiriyya Mosque, it is also an example of Ottoman architecture, successfully combining the different architectural styles of the Ottoman Empire and Yemen. The mosque is a complex that includes a prayer hall, minaret, courtyard, rooms for bathing, swimming pool and hospice. View of the entrance and the dome of the Tahla mosque. The entrance to the mosque is preceded by a four-dome portico with two arched walkways. Unlike Al-Bakiriyya Mosque, Talha Mosque does not feature additional enlargements (outbuildings). The prayer hall of the mosque therefore forms rectangle. The semi-circular dome of the prayer hall is decorated with stucco and rests on an octagonal drum, surrounded by four octagonal corner towers, also decorated with stucco. Each face in the center drum has an arched window that serves as an additional source of light of the prayer hall. The prayer hall of the Talha Mosque does not have the traditional Yemeni mosques wooden coffered ceiling and columns as the square, as per plan, in Al-Bakiriyya Mosque. Support drum and dome at the expense of small-vaulted arched sails. The minaret is located next to the prayer hall, on the southeast corner. Relatively low, it stands on a rectangular base. Interesting in its own decor minaret. There used rather peculiar favorite decorative motif of Yemen - four-sided diamond (rhombus), which is considered the same protective amulet. Here it is used not as usual - vertically and horizontally around balcony. Under the balcony just as interesting stylized floral motif, reminiscent of sorghum. Talha Mosque located in the western part of Sana'a, in the Old City District, and often falls into the camera frame. Her short minaret at a certain angle looks like a pinnacle on the dome of the mosque. See also * Islam in Yemen * List of mosques in Yemen References  Further reading  * Ronald Lewcock.

It is considered a pioneering essay for both feminist art history and feminist art theory. Content In this essay, Nochlin explores the institutional ‚Äì as opposed to the individual ‚Äì obstacles that have prevented women in the West from succeeding in the arts. She divides her argument into several sections, the first of which takes on the assumptions implicit in the essay's title, followed by \\"The Question of the Nude,\\" \\"The Lady's Accomplishment,\\" \\"Successes,\\" and \\"Rosa Bonheur.\\" In her introduction, she acknowledges \\"the recent upsurge of feminist activity\\" in America as a condition for her interrogation of the ideological foundations of art history, while also invoking John Stuart Mill's suggestion that \\"we tend to accept whatever is as natural\\". In her conclusion, she states: \\"I have tried to deal with one of the perennial questions used to challenge women's demand for true, rather than token, equality by examining the whole erroneous intellectual substructure upon which the question 'Why have there been no great women artists?' is based; by questioning the validity of the formulation of so- called problems in general and the 'problem' of women specifically; and then, by probing some of the limitations of the discipline of art history itself.\\" Publication history and legacy First published in 1971 as \\"Why Are There No Great Women Artists?\\" in Woman in Sexist Society: Studies in Power and Powerlessness, Nochlin's essay was revised, retitled \\"Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\\" and published in ArtNews. It was also released with other essays and photographs in Art and Sexual Politics: Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists? The essay has been reprinted regularly since then, including in Nochlin's Women, Art, and Power and Other Essays and Women Artists: The Linda Nochlin Reader. \\"Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\\" is generally considered required reading for the fields of feminist art history and feminist art theory inasmuch as it calls out the institutional barriers to the visual arts that women in the Western tradition historically faced. Nochlin considers the history of women's lack of art education as well as the nature of art and of artistic genius as they are currently defined. The essay has also served as an important impetus for the rediscovery of women artists, followed as it was by the exhibition Women Artists: 1550-1950. Eleanor Munro called it \\"epochal\\", and according to Miriam van Rijsingen \\"it is considered the genesis of feminist art history\\". The essay's title and content have inspired a number of essays and publications about the absence of women in certain professional fields, such as \\"Why Are There No Great Women Chefs?\\" by Charlotte Druckman. In 1989 an exhibition was held to increase visibility for women artists entitled Women's Work: the Montana Women's Centennial Art Survey Exhibition 1889-1989, inspired by Nochlin's groundbreaking contribution.

History Schubert was a Catholic professor who chaired the Judaic studies department at the University of Vienna during the post-World War II era. Due to the climate in Austria following the war, many projects regarding Judaism were private enterprises, as was the museum. It was situated in Eisenstadt, rather than Vienna, due to budgetary constraints. It catered to an academic clientele, rather than the general public, and initially were focused around annual symposiums held by the museum. Its creation paved the way for later museums in Austria dealing with Jewish topics, such as the Jewish Museum Vienna. The museum is housed today in the Wertheimerhaus, also called the Wertheimer'schen Freihaus, which was commissioned and financed by Esterhazy family and built by Samson Wertheimer in 1719, who earned the commission through service to the aristocratic family. Wertheimer was an important businessman and served both the court in Vienna and the high rabbi in Hungary. This house was built in Eisenstadt during his own service as a high rabbi and housed a private synagoge with a separate room for women only. The synagoge is part of the museum exhibition.

Origin Crab in oyster sauce can trace its origin to Southern China's Cantonese cuisine, more precisely after the development of oyster sauce in late 19th-century. Then the dish was spread across Asia. In Indonesia it is known as kepiting saus tiram, one of the two most popular ways that crab is served there and a popular seafood in Chinese Indonesian cuisine. Ingredients The most popular crab species used in this recipe is mud crab, though blue crab may also be used. The crabs are cut into pieces and stir-fried shortly in wok on strong fire in cooking oil and water, garlic, ginger, onion and scallion, mixed with oyster sauce, soy sauce, ang ciu (Chinese cooking wine) and sugar. Then the sauce is being thickening with corn starch and water mixture. The mild umami (savoury) seafood flavour of oyster sauce tends to enhance the natural flavour of the crab.

The bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. It was signed into law on August 8, 2014 by President Barack Obama. Background The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (, as amended by Public Law 106‚Äì55, Public Law 106‚Äì113, Public Law 107‚Äì228, Public Law 108‚Äì332, and Public Law 108‚Äì458) was passed to promote religious freedom as a foreign policy of the United States, and to advocate on the behalf of the individuals viewed as persecuted in foreign countries on the account of religion. The Act was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on October 27, 1998. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. H.R. 4028 would amend the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 to include the desecration of cemeteries among the forms of violations of the right to religious freedom in many countries around the world. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, a public domain source. H.R. 4028 would amend the findings of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 by including the desecration of cemeteries among the various violations of the right to religious freedom. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4028 would have no effect on the federal budget. Pay-as-you- go procedures do not apply to this legislation because it would not affect direct spending or revenues. Procedural history H.R. 4028 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on February 10, 2014 by Rep. Grace Meng (D, NY-6). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations. On May 28, 2014, the bill passed the House in a voice vote. The United States Senate voted on July 29, 2014 to pass the bill by unanimous consent and President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on August 8, 2014. Debate and discussion Rep. Meng, who sponsored the bill, said that \\"this legislation would be a new and important tool in our fight against the desecration of cemeteries\\" because it would \\"combat religiously-motivated vandalism of cemeteries and also prevent developers from building over cemeteries, a new and emerging threat in places where there are no Jewish communities left to protect burial grounds.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4028 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4028 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4028 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4028 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4028 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 4028 Category:United States federal civil rights legislation Category:United States foreign relations legislation Category:United States legislation about religion Category:Acts of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"To amend the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 to include the desecration of cemeteries among the many forms of violations of the right to religious freedom"},{"id":"42879694","text":"R.

It was located in the Lower Town area of the city, along the Saint-Charles River. Founded in 1858, the shipyard stayed in operation until 1949, when it constructed its last ship. It built ships for the Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy during both world wars. In 1947, the company was renamed St. Lawrence Metal and Marine Works. History Founded by Alex Mackay & Company in 1858, the shipyard was leased to Quebec Shipbuilding & Repairing Company during the First World War. The Royal Navy ordered two wooden freighters to be built at the shipyard during the war, both completed in 1918. Between the wars, the shipyard changed hands. In 1919, it was purchased by W.J. Morton who changed the name of the shipyard to Quebec Docking & Ship Repairing Company in 1927 after incorporating it. In 1928 he changed it again, giving it its more well known name, Morton Engineering and Dry Dock Company. As part of his intention to make the yard bigger, he had a 2,500 ton marine railway installed.Pritchard, p. 55 Following the installation, the shipyard offered ship repair, boiler making and general engineering services. In 1937, the shipyard received its first Royal Canadian Navy contract when a minesweeper, was ordered for construction. During the Second World War Morton Engineering constructed corvettes and frigates for the Royal and Royal Canadian Navies as part of the convoy escort construction programmes. This included some corvettes that were later transferred to the United States. In 1941, the St. Lawrence During the war the yard employed 2700 workers at its peak. This was beyond the capability of the yard's management and in 1943 the Canadian Government took over running the yard and operated it until the end of the war. The Morton yard was partnered with the George T. Davie & Sons Ltd. shipyard at Lauzon and the two operated a joint fitting out yard located in the Louise Basin. This was due to hull construction outpacing the fitting out of ships. This would lead to labour strife and in June 1943 a strike by the workers at the shipyards would slow production. Following this, the two yards were expropriated by the Canadian government and placed under the umbrella company, Quebec Shipyards Limited and remained under its control until the end of the war.Pritchard, p. 80 The yard was sold to Herv√© Baribeau in 1946, renamed St. Lawrence Metal and Marine Works Ltd. Following the war it built cargo ships. The yard closed its doors in 1949. Yard limitations The site of the yard limited its ability to launch larger ships. It was only the installation of the marine railway that allowed the shipyard to launch modern ships. The ships were pulled sideways from launching ways on the west side of the river onto a railway cradle and from there were lowered into the water. Canadian winters prevented the launching of ships from December to March. To improve the yard's capability in building and launching large cargo ships during the Second World War, the river upstream from Morton Engineering was dredged in order to give room for newly launched larger cargo ships space to turn around.Pritchard, p. 88 It was also dredged downstream in order to connect it to a channel that was navigable.

Opening under the name Orlando Eye, it opened on April 29, 2015. The wheel was reported to be in the early stages of planning in March 2011, at which point it was proposed for completion in mid-2014, but the opening date was subsequently delayed to late 2014 and then to early 2015. The attraction was renamed the Coca-Cola Orlando Eye in 2015; the ICON Orlando in 2018; and The Wheel at ICON Park Orlando in 2019. The most recent rename included a re-branding of the property to become ICON Park. Design and construction The Wheel at Icon Park Orlando described as an observation wheel, because \\"this is a stabilized-driven (capsule) that gives you a really smooth experience on the way around, so it doesn't feel like when you're at 400-feet, that you're swinging around in mid-air.\\" According to its official website, The Wheel at ICON Park Orlando is the first wheel ever to use such a system in combination with a suspended 'ski lift capsule design'. The wheel was reported to be in the early stages of planning in March 2011, with completion due in mid-2014, and was approved by county commissioners in September 2012. In January 2013, it was reported that the expected opening date had been pushed back to \\"by Thanksgiving November 2014\\". Erection of the main support structure began in December 2013. In April 2014 it was reported that completion had been further delayed until early 2015. Installation of the 30 air-conditioned passenger capsules, each of which can carry up to 15 people, began in mid-January 2015, and the last capsule was installed on February 5. In mid-February 2015, it was announced that the soft opening was scheduled for May 1, followed by a grand opening ceremony on May 4. The Orlando Eye carried its first passenger on April 29, 2015. Malfunctions On July 3, 2015, at around 4:00 pm, a few months after operations began, the Eye experienced a technical fault with the system that monitors the wheel position, causing the system to automatically shut down, stranding about 66 riders for approximately three hours. Rebranding On July 28, 2016, the Orlando Eye followed its London counterpart in becoming sponsored by Coca-Cola and was renamed the Coca-Cola Orlando Eye. The deal included the renaming of the Eye and four new \\"Surprise and Delight\\" capsules, which are branded capsules with a cooler of soda and selfie sticks. On March 11, 2018, it was rebranded again as ICON Orlando. On April 4, 2019, it was rebranded once again to The Wheel at ICON Park Orlando.

Pieter Erberveld (ca. 1660 - April 14, 1722) was a Eurasian resident of Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta), the headquarters of the VOC in Asia, during the 17th and early 18th centuries who was accused of plotting a rebellion with Javanese for January 1, 1722, but was captured and executed, and a monument erected where his house had stood. Although he is often described as half-Javanese, or half- Dutch, Pieter Erberveld was the son a German (Westphalian) father, a tanner of hides, and Siamese Christian mother. He was born around 1660 in the Siamese kingdom of Ayuthya. When his father moved the family to Batavia, he had them all baptized in November 1671.Jean Gelman Taylor, Indonesia: Peoples and Histories, Yale University Press, 2003 Erberveld was among the more wealthy residents of Batavia, although he was not a VOC employee. In the early 18th century, he had a dispute with the VOC authorities about his inheritance, which may have played a role in later events. In 1721, he was accused of plotting a rebellion with thousands of Javanese, with the goal of establishing an Islamic state, but was arrested at his residence with a small number of people, tortured, and executed. The monument which was erected on the site of his residence featured a concrete or plaster skull on a spike (which was rumored to be real), and carried a plaque stating that no one should ever build or plant on this site again. This monument remained in its original location on the Jacatraweg until the Japanese demolished it in early 1942, as one of their efforts to rid Indonesia of the Dutch and the colonial atmosphere, but even Japanese visitors had been regularly taken to visit the monument in prewar years. After the war, the monument was rebuilt, before being moved again to the Taman Prasasti Museum in Tanah Abang. Pieter Erberveld was locally relatively well known, and is sometimes referred to as Pangeran Pecah Kulit (broken skin prince) either because of the means of his death (drawing and quartering) or more likely from the local area's nickname, derived from the presence of a tannery in the area. Numerous stories about Erberveld have circulated in Indonesian society since at least 1888, including a novel published in 1924 by Tio Ie Soei and one version of the story about his was made into a TV drama in the 1980s. The spelling of Pieter Erberveld varies in different sources, including Pieter Erbervelt and Pieter Elberveld.  References   Further reading  *Heuken, Adolf (1982).

It is the national church of Japan in Rome.  History  Interior The church is set in the middle of the area that has been called the Prata Mutia (\\"Fields of Mutius\\") since about 508 BC; it was here that the Etruscan king Porsena had made his encampment, and that later the Roman Senate donated to Mucius Scaevola as a sign of gratitude of Rome for his heroic actions.Ridolfino Venuti, Accurata e succinta descrizione topografica delle antichit√† di Roma, vol. 2, page 198; Rome 1824 The origins of the church are associated with a miracle that is supposed to have happened circa 1488. A sick farmer, afflicted with a serious palsy according to oral history, was healed after praying to an image of the Virgin Mary painted close to the entrance to his own market garden. The event led to popular worship for the painting, and subsequently a small votive chapel was erected, soon followed by a greater church, funded by 12 professional associations (Universit√†).For a detailed description of the history of the church and his Universit√†, see Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica da S. Pietro sino ai giorni nostri by Gaetano Moroni (1857), pages 190 and following. In 1492, Pope Alexander VI allowed the establishment of a confraternity and in 1588 (with a brief dated 20 March) Pope Sixtus V declared it an \\"archconfraternity\\" and bestowed on it the rare privilege of asking for the pardon of a person condemned to death, during its titular feast. During the 1825 Jubilee, it was honored with the title of Venerable.Gaetano Moroni, Dictionary of historic-ecclesiastical erudition As an archconfraternity, it could attach other confraternities, anywhere in the world; therefore, during the 1600 Jubilee ‚Äì through a notary deed dated 30 April ‚Äì it was aggregated to the Confraternity of the Oratory of Nostra Signora di Castello, established in Savona in 1260. Construction was begun in 1489 by an unknown architect and completed in 1567. Its fa√ßade is largely ascribed to Vignola (though sometimes attributed to Martino Longhi the ElderLuciano Zeppegno and Roberto Mattonelli, Le chiese di Roma, p. 135), while the interior is by Guidetto Guidetti, a pupil of Michelangelo who transformed the former Greek-cross design (with four apses) into a Latin-cross structure with three naves. The church houses works of art by the brothers Federico and Taddeo Zuccari, Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Baglione. The church is still guarded by the Archconfraternity of S. Maria dell'OrtoIts Camerlengo, since 2005, is Domenico Rotella. that, due to the seniority of its papal establishment, is the most ancient of the Confraternities consecrated to the Holy Virgin still active in Rome, and one of the first overall.Antonio Martini, Matizia Maroni Lumbroso - Le Confraternite romane nelle loro chiese - Marco Besso Foundation, Rome 1963 = The port, the Universit√† and the Confraternity = Title stone of the Universit√† of the Pizzicaroli (\\"Grocers\\"), 1756 The area around the church was used for farming and trading - mainly wholesale - until the end of the 19th century. Due to its position on the margin of the walls, not far from Porta Portese and close to the Port of Ripa Grande, it had great commercial importance, and the church became a reference point for the professional associations involved in the food supply of the town and of the ships from and to Ostia through the Tiber: foodstuffs producers and merchants, as well as brokers and service suppliers. The Archconfraternity, which was also open to women, gathered 13 Universit√† (the Roman equivalent of the guilds), showing the economic significance of the area: * the Grocers and Greengrocers (the founders); * the Fruit sellers; * the Agents of Ripa (brokers of local trades); * the Millers (the mills on the Tiber had a great importance for flour supply); * the Vermicellari (producers of pasta); * the Chicken-sellers; * the Cobblers; * the Winemakers; * the Young men (shop boys and navvies belonging to various Universities). (The term Universit√† comes from the Latin universitas - that means \\"union\\", \\"association\\" - with the more specific meaning of \\"aggregation of all men practicing the same activity\\"). = Relationship with the Japanese community = The 1585 Japanese mission; the first in the upper left is Juli√£o Nakaura The church is also the reference church for the Catholic Japanese community of Rome. The relationship between the Japanese community and the church has an ancient origin: a Japanese mission (\\"Tensh≈ç embassy\\"), consisting of four dignitaries, came to Rome in 1585 to meet the Pope. One of the feasts, thrown in honour of the guests who had come from such a distance, consisted of a sailing on Tiber from the Port of Ripa Grande to Ostia, which should have been followed by a feast on the sea with musicians and singers. But a storm rose and everybody dreaded for his life. So they implored the Virgin of the church that they had visited before leaving, and the storm calmed down. The event gave rise to the tradition of a sung Mass that is celebrated on 8 June (the anniversary day), with the attendance of delegates from the Japan Embassy in the Holy See and from the Japanese community in Rome (source: Enrico Pucci). Since 2007, in order to guarantee a better exposure, the event is commemorated during the Titular Holiday. On October 2009, a portrait of Giuliano (Juli√£o) Nakaura ‚Äì one of the four ambassadors, who suffered martyrdom in 1633 and was beatified in 2008 ‚Äì was placed in the church. The pro tempore Ambassador of Japan in the Holy See is traditionally honored with the office of Warden of Honour of the association.  Worship and celebrations  The \\"Macchina delle Quarant'Ore\\" (2008) Worship is celebrated on Sundays and on the other feasts of precept at 11 a.m. In the evening of Holy Thursday, the monumental Macchina delle Quarant'Ore (\\"Machine of the Forty Hours\\") is set up: it is a 19th- century structure based upon a 17th-century design, with floral decorations, made of carved and gilt wood on which more than two hundred candles are placed, so as to illuminate the mystical dark. It is perhaps the last structure of this kind still used in Italy. The Titular Holiday of Saint Mary dell'Orto falls on the third Sunday of October. During the suggestive ceremony, blessed apples are distributed to the faithful, both in remembrance of the former Fruttaroli (\\"fruit sellers\\") guild, that gave a significant contribution to the artistic treasures of the church, and for a devotional reason: the head of the household, during the dinner, will divide the fruit into as many slices as the relatives, to symbolize \\"the unity into the diversity\\" of the Mystical Body of the Church, according to St. Paul's teaching (I Cor. ‚Äì XII, 12).  Description  The church is not just a sacred edifice consecrated to the Holy Virgin, but a real Marian sanctuary, full of precise symbolisms. For example, the earthly glory of Mary is depicted on the ground level, along the walls, starting from the Annunciation through all the other episodes of her life (Nativity, Presentation at the Temple, Marriage, Visitation, Flight into Egypt and so on). Her heavenly glory (Conception, Assumption, Crowning), on the other hand, is celebrated in the vaults forming the ‚Äúsky‚Äù of the church. Further interesting symbolic elements can be observed in the ornaments that surround the six windows of the middle nave. Such openings let the light to burst into the church with all its brightness and to enlighten it with the rays of sunshine, an image mirroring the light of Faith descending to dispel the darkness of sin. Similarly, Christ, the Light of the World, has revealed himself through Mary, and therefore the six windows bear decorations that refer to her. Each window is surmounted by a golden plaster shell, containing a symbol, and stands above a festoon. The first window on the right side brings a door in the middle of the shell and the writing Felix coeli porta into the festoon; the second one, a sun on the top and a steelyard into the festoon; the third one, a star on the top and the writing Maris stella into the festoon. The first window on the left side brings a tower on the top and the writing Iter para tutum above; the second one, a moon on the top and a steelyard above; the third one, an ark on the top and the writing Foederis arca above. The reading key of such ornamental complex is as simple as admirable. The Tower, the Ark, the Door and the Star are attributes that can be found into the Litany of Loreto, while the mottoes above ‚Äì except Foederis arca ‚Äì are taken from the verses of the ancient Marian hymn Ave Maris Stella. The windows in the middle bear no writings, but just a steelyard, the attentive emblem of the Universit√† of the Pizzicaroli (Grocers), that financed the stuccoes. The shells show a sun and a moon facing on the opposite sides or, if you will, alternating each other in the infinite cycle of days and nights. With regards to light, the reference to the two grand lamps of heaven (Genesis I, 14 et seq.) could not be omitted; the same lamps that St. Ambrose called the eyes of sky and lighthouses of the world (Hexameron). Indeed, according to the theological symbology of the Church, Mary is the Moon, reflecting the light of the Sun, that is Christ. The divine light thus can spread over the world, as men could not directly receive such a brilliant light without being dazzled: the mildness and sweetness of the Virgin are an indispensable mediation. For this reason, into the religious iconography Mary is often portrayed wrapped up into a blue, star-adorned mantle and with the feet lying on a crescent moon. A Marian value can also be found into the little and big shells scattered all around the Assumption painted by Giacinto Calandrucci on the central vault. Just to make a single example among the others, a protochristian text quoted by John Damascene ‚Äì the Physiologus ‚Äì gives a further confirmation to the vast iconography, according to which Mary is the mirable instrument by which mankind could receive the Savior: The divine lightning has penetrated into the purest shell, into Mary, the mother of God, and a valuable pearl has born.  The church and the cinema  The church, due to its majestic aspect, has been chosen as a set for many movies: above all, in 1945 various scenes of the famous Rome, Open City by Roberto Rossellini were filmed here, and more precisely the ones showing the interior of the church, whose vicar is don Pietro (performed by Aldo Fabrizi), while the external location was the church of S. Elena. The parvis of the church also appears in an episode of I mostri (1963) by Dino Risi. One of the latest movies is Giovanna's Father (2007), directed by Pupi Avati.

HistoryNVSL History USDA APHIS website (public domain - government employee work), Retrieved May 27, 2014 Originally, the USDA's national veterinary diagnostic laboratory functions were part of its Bureau of Animal Industry. In 1961, the National Animal Disease Laboratory (NADL) opened in Ames, Iowa. The NADL (later renamed the National Animal Disease Center, or NADC) contained research and regulatory laboratories. The regulatory laboratories provided diagnostic services for the Animal Disease Eradication Division and biologics evaluations for the Animal Inspection and Quarantine Division. A few years later, reorganization resulted in three independent units: research, biologics, and diagnostics. The biologics group was physically located outside of the NADL facilities. In 1971, diagnostic services were aligned with the Animal Health Division (AHD) laboratory facilities in Beltsville, Maryland. In 1973, the Biologics and Diagnostic Services Laboratories were brought back together under one Director and named the Veterinary Services Laboratories, part of the new Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). In December 1977, the unit's name changed to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL). Plans were made for construction of new facilities as growth continued. Phase 1 of the plan was completed in 1978, and the biologics, administrative, and support functions moved into the new building. That year, APHIS closed its diagnostic facilities in Beltsville, Maryland, and the veterinary diagnostic functions moved to Ames. In 1984, diagnostic activities at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center located on Plum Island, New York, were transferred to APHIS supervision. Named the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, it became part of the NVSL. Biologics testing activities split from the NVSL in 1996, joining biologics licensing and inspection activities to form the Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB). The NVSL now focus exclusively on diagnostic services. A modernized and consolidated facility for animal health research, diagnosis, and product evaluation, co-locating the NADC, NVSL-Ames, and CVB, was completed in 2009. The facility includes high- and low-containment large animal facilities (BSL-3Ag and BSL-2Ag, respectively) and a consolidated laboratory and administrative facility.

As a result, in 1803 he received a recommendation to study with Jean-Henri Gilson (1741-1809), a former Benedictine monk who taught art in Florenville. After four years there, he received a further recommendation to study with Jacques-Louis David in Paris, where Ramboux remained until 1812.

Late public activity Carlist standard Upon termination of Urraca's term in the II. Consejo Nacional of Falange in 1942 she has almost entirely disappeared from politics, be it either this related to official Falangist structures, unofficial Carlist movement or semi-political Catholic organizations.

As at that time the movement was torn between the Traditionalists and the socialists from Partido Carlista, she sided with the former; in 1972 she co-signed a document issued by Junta Nacional del Requet√©, which lambasted Carlos Hugo as the one abandoned the Carlist standard.Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 138 Urraca remained engaged in anti-hugocarlista backlash also later on, her last voice on the issue was heard in 1974.Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 271 Also during transici√≥n she took part in cultural events related to orthodox Carlism.she provided a foreword opening a promotional meeting of a book El carlismo en el ser de Espa√±a by Felio Villarublas, see La Vanguardia 15.03.77, available here In return, she was berated by the Partido Carlista propagandists as traitor and \\"enfermera de Franco\\".see the abusive title and contents of a sub-chapter Mar√≠a Rosa Urraca Pastor, la enfermera de Franco, contained in section named Gallery of traitors, replicated in a number of books by Josep Carles Clemente and published until today, e.g. Jos√© Carlos Clemente, Breve historia de las guerras carlistas, Madrid 2011, , p. 235 In the late 1970s she is known to have neared the post-Francoist b√∫nker; in 1976 she lent her support to Blas Pi√±ar and his Fuerza Nueva;Fuerza Nueva 22.05.76, available here in 1977, shortly before official dissolution of Movimiento Nacional, she still used to frequent its Barcelona premises, recorded as affable, restrained, but energetic and committed to her ideals.Juan Fern√°ndez Krohn, Sindrome (joseantoniano) de Alicante, [in:] Juan Fern√°ndez Krohn desde B√©lgica blog, 16.09.2013, available here Until her death she considered herself a Carlist.

In the tightly censored media of the late 1940s an ex-Republican soldier turned graphics artist, Miguel Bernet Toledano, was permitted to create and publicize her malicious alter-ego known as Do√±a Urraca, a comics figure to become iconic character in the Spanish print. A direct reference has never been made;there were also some visual differences between a character and its model: Do√±a Urraca was skinny-thin - Urraca Pastor was well-built, Do√±a Urraca wore glasses ‚Äì Urraca Pastor did not, Do√±a Urraca wore black ‚Äì Urraca Pastor preferred lighter colours some claim the cartoon figure had nothing to do with Urraca Pastor,Krohn 2013; detailed discussion at La bruja y los paisanos: Do√±a Urraca de Jorge y varios se√±ores normales, [in:] De Todo Un Poco blog 14.05.2011, available here some maintain that there is little doubt the ugly black-dressed witch, keen to abuse the weak with a sole purpose to do evilKrohn 2013 was aimed to mock her.Andr√©s Prieto 2012, p. 94 During transici√≥n she took the brunt of long- suppressed Republican anger; a wartime Francoist agent in France, an unrelated Pedro Urraca Rendueles,I√±aki Mirena Anasagasti Olabeaga, Urraca, el polic√≠a franquista que lider√≥ agentes y esp√≠as en el exterior, [in:] ianasagasti blog, available here was presented as ‚ÄûUrraca Pastor\\"Ress√≥ June 1979, p. 14, available here, this either confusion or intended manipulation persisted well into the 1990s, see El Pais 23.07.96, available here and there was even a 1979 theatric play featuring him as a villain involved in execution of Companys.Pla√ßa Gran 01.12.79, available here Shortly before death she was mocked as a mustached nurse by the Noble-prize winner Jos√© Cela in his Mazurca para dos muertos (1983); in literature she also appears - as bulky and ugly conspirator - in Inquietud en el Para√≠so (2005) by √ìscar Esquivias. In historiography she is approached as a representative of various social phenomena rather than as a personality herself. One author considers Urraca a typical sample of middle-class women politicized by rocky times of the Second Republic.Lannon 2002, p. 83 Another scholar advances a competitive thesis, namely that she engaged in public life mostly as a result of modernizing primoderiverista attempts combined with rising social activity of the Catholics.Andr√©s Prieto 2012, p. 68, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 223 Some point to social issues as a key thread of her activity,compare Moral Roncal 2011 some point to her traditional Catholicismcompare Gonzalez-Allende 2009 and some focus on feminism.compare Andr√©s Prieto 2012 This approach is particularly popular, as Urraca is often mentioned when discussing growing role of women in the recent history of Spain.see e.g. Isabel Morant Deusa, Mar√≠a √Ångeles Querol, Historia De Las Mujeres En Espana Y America Latina: Del Siglo XX a Los Umbrales Del Xxi, Madrid 2005, , p. 158; Las mujeres y la Guerra Civil espa√±ola, Madrid 1991, , pp. 18, 189, 296; Mari Luz Esteban, Mila Amurrio, Feminist Challenges in the Social Sciences: Gender Studies in the Basque Country, Reno 2010, , pp. 92-93, Llona Gonz√°lez 1998 Though in the Basque realm she is held responsible for executions of priests,Un libro recoge 136 testimonios in√©ditos de la Guerra del 36 recogidos por Barandiaran, [in:] Gara 25.05.06, available here, Diario Vasco 22.10.06, available here by many other scholars Urraca is viewed with cautious sympathy, as a person who was allegedly passionate about equality of the sexes,Lannon 2002, p. 83, though she also ‚Äûestaba convencida de que la mujer pod√≠a servir al pa√≠s fuera de casa\\", La Vanguardia 26.01.72 social justice,‚Äûtuve siempre un car√°cter independiente un instinto de rebeld√≠a contra todo lo injusto.

Tophane Fountain () is an 18th-century public water fountain built by Ottoman sultan Mahmud I in the Ottoman rococo architecture and situated in the square of Tophane neighborhood in Beyoƒülu district of Istanbul, Turkey. History The sebil, a public fountain to provide drinking water for travellers and running water for praying people's ritual washing needs, was commissioned by Sultan Mahmud I (reigned 1730‚Äì1754). It was built in 1732, in an era with great importance attached to the construction of many fountains. It is situated in the square, which is formed by the intersection of Tophane ƒ∞skelesi Street and Necatibey Street. The fountain neighbors to Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pa≈üa Complex in the southwest, Nusretiye Mosque in the northeast, the Tophane Workshops in the northwest and the Quay in the southeast. The fountain underwent two major restorations. The first one was realized in 1837, at which its roof was completely changed, and a flat roof in the form of a terrace was adapted. In the 1956‚Äì1957, it was restored in the framework of urban transformation, and the roof and wide eaves were rearranged sticking by the original form seen at engravings. In 2006, one of Turkey's largest conglomerates contributed to the renovation and refining works at the fountain. At this occasion, the fountain was supplied with water again. Architecture The fountain was built as a stand-alone structure in the type of a \\"square fountain\\" (). It looks like a monument, but contributes an architectural integration to the Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha Complex (1580), which is situated nearby. It has the form of a square prism in general. However, the lower half of the structure has an octagonal plan, which transforms into a square at the upper half with the help of muqarnas. It was designed by the court architect Kayserili Mehmed Aƒüa in the rococo architectural style of Ottoman Tulip Period (1703‚Äì1757). It is adorned with ornamentation showing a transition from classical to rococo style. Its design shows similarities with the Fountain of Ahmed III at Topkapƒ± Palace (1729) and the Fountain of Ahmed III in √úsk√ºdar (1729). All four facades have the same design, a faucet inside a lancet arch in the middle over a watering trough to enable for bucket filling, livestock drinking or taking ritual body washing for prayer. The lancets are flanked by semicircular niches resembling a mosque's mihrab. The higher-attached faucets over a sink in the four corners were designed to spend drinking water for people. A number of relief fruit tree motifs in pots adorn the structure. The lead-sheet covered wooden roof has wide eaves, and is topped by a dome in the center. The fountain features an inscription surrounding the entire structure and including a poem of Nahifi written in Islamic calligraphy.

He previously served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Midlands‚ÄìNorth-West constituency from 2014 to 2020. Early and personal life Carthy was born in Birmingham, England, in 1977. His mother is from County Monaghan and his father from County Roscommon. The family moved to County Roscommon when Carthy was aged two, where he lived until he was 10. His family then spent a year living in Holywell in north-east Wales before returning to Ireland to live in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan. He has described the experience of living on the Irish border during the conflict as playing a formative role in shaping his republican political views, and cites hunger strikers Bobby Sands and Kieran Doherty as major influences. Carthy studied marketing for a year at the Dublin Institute of Technology, where he formed a Sinn F√©in college cumann (branch) in 1996. Carthy was a founding member of √ìgra Shinn F√©in (a Sinn F√©in youth organisation) the following year. He worked as a full-time youth organiser for √ìgra in Dublin in Sinn F√©in's party headquarters, and as a press officer for Sinn F√©in.

Approximately a dozen manuscripts in the script were recovered from Gunjala, a Gond village in Adilabad district of Telangana by a team of researchers from the University of Hyderabad, led by Professor Jayadheer Tirumala Rao. The script and preliminary font were unveiled in early 2014.  History of Manuscripts  The manuscripts have been dated to approximately Year 1750, based on knowledge from Gondi pundits and researchers at the Center of Dalit and Adivasi Studies and Translation (CDAST). The information contained in the manuscripts includes that of the names of the months and days, a horoscope chart, grammar, and numbers. Additionally, manuscripts were found on \\"knowledge of the seasons, history, and the Gondi code of ethics and literature.\\" Of the historical information that has been discovered, the following cases have been reported: the 6th-7th century trade relationship between the Pardhan community and civilizations in Myanmar; the origins of the Indravelli mandal; the early eighteenth century rebellions of the Chandrapur Gond kings against the British, with the support of the Rohilla community, all of this among other pieces of information.  Characters  The characters themselves, while bearing resemblance to similar phonemes found in other Indian scripts, are in a different, \\"native\\" order, as the script starts with the letter \\"ya\\" instead of the traditional \\"ka\\" for other Indian scripts. The script includes 12 vowels and 25 consonants.  Response to discovery, education, and spread  The script has seen a very welcoming response by the various government agencies in Andhra Pradesh, at the national level, and local agencies in the region. The existence of the manuscripts has allegedly been known for 5‚Äì9 years, but were not prioritized until 2013, when Prof. Jayadheer Tirumala Rao discovered that only four elders in the village were still able to read the script. Currently, approximately eighty students are able to read the script, with students devising stories and elder Kotnak Jangu writing an autobiography. Plans are in place for the expansion of the script to fifteen other government schools in villages with a high Gond population. A reader for the script in Telugu was released for Standard I students. Efforts are being undertaken to get the script into the Unicode standard. In 2015, a Unicode proposal was written by Anshuman Pandey from the Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley. The proposal was approved by the Unicode Technical Committee in November 2015. Unicode The Gunjala Gondi script was added to the Unicode Standard in June, 2018 with the release of version 11.0.

Life  Manuel Tagaris was of lowly origins‚Äîthe Tagaris family is first attested in the early years of the 14th century and comprised a handful of members. He served as governor of Philadelphia, from , in which capacity he repelled a Turkish attack on the city in 1310/11. His valour and ability in the wars against the Turks in Asia Minor won him the esteem of Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (), who appointed him to the ranks of the aristocracy (he is archaically called a \\"synkletikos\\") and even gave him the hand of his niece, Theodora Palaiologina Asanina, a daughter of Tsar Ivan Asen III of Bulgaria, as his second wife. During his long governorship of Philadelphia, he clashed with the local bishops of Philadelphia and Ephesus, Theoleptus and Manuel Gabalas, respectively. By April 1321, he had risen to the high post of megas stratopedarches at the court in Constantinople, when Andronikos III Palaiologos, the grandson of Andronikos II, fled the capital, marking the beginning of the Byzantine civil war of 1321‚Äì28. When Andronikos II ordered him to pursue the prince and arrest him, Tagaris refused, claiming the order to be unenforceable, a view in which he was supported by the Emperor's other advisers. Andronikos II then sent Tagaris back to Philadelphia, which he again defended against a Turkish siege until 1324, when the siege was lifted by Alexios Philanthropenos. In 1329, he was sent to take the field against Orhan, the ruler of the rising Ottoman beylik. He probably died sometime before 1342.  Family  Manuel married twice, first to a lady of unknown first name, but descended from the Monomachos and Doukas families, and then to Theodora Asenina Palaiologina, daughter of Ivan Asen III of Bulgaria. He had a daughter from the first marriage, and a son, George Tagaris, who also rose to become megas stratopedarches. The future Latin Patriarch of Constantinople Paul Palaiologos Tagaris was also possibly his son, or otherwise a relative.

Background Upon declaring war on Mexico on May 13, 1846, President James Polk immediately called for the capture California from the Mexicans. California had been a territory that Polk had desired ever since the annexation of Texas in 1845, and when war with Mexico broke out, he saw the perfect opportunity to take hold of the land he wanted. The U.S. Pacific Squadron was given the order to occupy every important port and city in California, with force if necessary. On July 7, 1846, the ships , and captured the Alta Californian capital city of Monterey without firing a shot. This procedure of occupation would set the stage for the Battle of Yerba Buena, which would follow a few days later. Battle Map of Yerba Buena, drawn by Jean Jacques Vioget in 1839; the town square (later renamed Portsmouth Square) is just south of the compass rose. On July 9, 1846, the USS Portsmouth, captained by Commander John B. Montgomery, sailed into San Francisco Bay, with the intent of capturing the town of Yerba Buena. Aboard the Portsmouth were 220 sailors and enlisted men, along with a contingent of 27 marines. The small Mexican force garrisoning the Presidio did not fire upon the USS Portsmouth, for fear that they would become obliterated. The Portsmouth landed a distance off the shore, and a group of sailors, soldiers and marines, as well as Montgomery and his staff, disembarked in rowboats for Yerba Buena. Upon landing on the shore, Mexican soldiers held their fire, and the Californios grouped together to watch the American force. Montgomery and his force walked up to the flagpole in the town square, where the Mexican flag was flown. He quickly tore it down, and hoisted the Stars and Stripes in its place, proclaiming that the town of Yerba Buena, and all of the land surrounding it, belonged to the United States. After Montgomery's speech, the marine band began to play Yankee Doodle, and the USS Portsmouth fired a 21 gun salute, to celebrate the capture of Yerba Buena. Following the capture of the town itself, Montgomery ordered a detachment of troops to seize the Presidio of San Francisco, and confiscate any weaponry they found, which the detachment did without conflict. Thus, the pueblo of Yerba Buena, and the land that would become eventually known as San Francisco, was captured by the United States of America.

During this period, Ustadh-Hurmuz was appointed by Sharaf al-Dawla as the governor of Oman. However, wishing to change his allegiance to Sharaf al-Dawla's brother, he was forced to retire in 984. = Service under the Buyids of Fars = During this period, Ibn Ustadh- Hurmuz was about 23 years old and was already in the service of Samsam al- Dawla; but in 987, Samsam al-Dawla was defeated and captured by Sharaf al- Dawla, who shortly annexed Iraq. He, however, died himself one year later, and was succeeded by his younger brother Baha' al-Dawla in Iraq, while Samsam al- Dawla managed to escape from captivity and fled to Fars, where he managed to conquer the entire region, and was joined by Ibn Ustadh-Hurmuz including other of his former officers such as Fuladh ibn Manadhar. In 995, Ibn Ustadh-Hurmuz became the leader of his Daylamite kinsmen in the Buyid army, thus giving him a powerful position in the Buyid Empire. Two years later, he captured Ahvaz, but in the following year, Samsam al-Dawla was killed during a revolt by the sons of the deceased former Buyid ruler Izz al-Dawla. Map of Iraq in the 9th‚Äì10th centuries = Service under the Buyids of Iraq = Ibn Ustadh-Hurmuz quickly used the opportunity to transfer his allegiance to Baha' al-Dawla, who became the new ruler of Fars. In 1001, Ibn Ustadh-Hurmuz was appointed as the governor of Ahvaz, and one year later, became the governor of Iraq, where he made order by solving disputes between different religious sects, and by defeating bandits who had caused chaos in the region. He also managed to defeat the former governor of Iraq, Abu Ja'far al-Hajjaj, who was supported by Kurds and Shayban Arabs. He also defended Iraq against incursions from Batihah and the Hasanwayhid ruler Badr ibn Hasanwayh. Furthermore, Ibn Ustadh-Hurmuz managed to suppress the rebellion of the Uqaylid ruler Qirwash, who had briefly taken control of a few Buyid cities and had changed his allegiance to the Fatimid Caliphate. Ibn Ustadh-Hurmuz later died in 1010/1, and was succeeded by the Buyid vizier Fakhr al-Mulk as the governor of Iraq. Ibn Ustadh-Hurmuz's father, however, outlived the latter, and lived until 1015.

HCAS launched its inaugural five-day film festival in 2009 in Houston, Texas. The Festival's unique focus on films ‚Äúby and about artists‚Äù accomplished two goals: It filled a niche in the broader film festival world that was sorely underrepresented, and it identified Houston, internationally, as a thriving arts town that celebrates innovative films, media installations and performances. The original name of the Festival was Cinema Arts Festival Houston through 2011 and was renamed Houston Cinema Arts Festival starting in November 2012. Events The Houston Cinema Arts Festival is the most ambitious of the Houston Cinema Arts Society programs. This five-day, multi-venue festival includes over 50 narrative and documentary films, film premieres, an interactive video installation gallery, 16mm screening room, live multimedia performances, panel discussions, Meet the Makers workshops, and free outdoor and student field trip screenings. In its relatively short history, HCAS has brought notable guest artists, such as Tilda Swinton, Alex Gibney, Guillermo Arriaga, Isabella Rossellini, John Turturro, Shirley MacLaine, Richard Linklater, Zlatko Topƒçiƒá, Ethan Hawke, Fisher Stevens, Robert Redford, Tracy Letts, Will Forte, Barbara Hammer, Jonas Mekas, and Thomas Haden Church among many others, to the Festival.

The last notable horse owned by the French breeder Marcel Boussac he showed promise as a two-year-old in 1977 when he finished a close third in the Grand Crit√©rium. He reached his peak in the following year when he won the Prix Lupin and the Prix du Jockey Club, coming from an apparently impossible position in the latter race. He then finished second in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in England, but was later disqualified after failing a dope test. At the end of his three-year-old season he was retired to stud but proved largely infertile. Background Acamas was a strong, deep-bodied bay horse with a white coronet on his left hind foot bred in the United Kingdom by Marcel Boussac. He was one of many successful racehorses sired by Mill Reef, an American-bred horse who won the Epsom Derby, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1971. His dam Licata, was a very good racemare who won the Prix Cl√©op√¢tre and Prix de Malleret in 1972. She was even better as a broodmare, going on to produce the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud winner Akarad and the 1982 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Akiyda. Boussac sent his colt into training with Guy Bonnaventure. Racing career =1977: two-year-old season= Acamas won over 1100 metres on his debut and was then moved up sharply in class for the Group One Prix Robert Papin over the same distance at √âvry Racecourse on 1 August. He started 5/4 favourite but finished tenth of the fourteen runners behind Vific. After a two-month break, Acamas was moved up in distance for the Grand Crit√©rium over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 9 October. Starting a 28/1 outsider he produced his best performance of the year as he finished third, beaten three quarters of a length and a neck by Super Concorde and Pyjama Hunt. =1978: three-year-old season= Acamas made his three-year- old debut in the Prix Greffulhe over 2100 metres at Longchamp on 9 April. He started the 3.75/1 second favourite and finished second, half a length behind the winner Naasiri in a rough and unsatisfactory race. Yves Saint-Martin took over the ride on Acamas when the colt contested the Group One Prix Lupin over the same course and distance on 14 May. He started at odds of 4.6/1 against a field which included Nishapour, Rusticaro and Pyjama Hunt, who had filled the first three places in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches as well as the previously undefeated Gay Mecene. Restrained at the back of the field until the turn into the straight, Acamas made rapid progress on the inside rail before taking the lead in the closing stages and winning by a length from Pyjama Hunt. On 4 June, Acamas started the 6/4 favourite for the Prix du Jockey Club over 2400 metres at Chantilly Racecourse. Racing towards the rear of the twenty-runner field, Acamas appeared to have lost any chance of winning when he was badly hampered and carried wide on the final turn, losing at least fifteen lengths in the process. Saint-Martin considered pulling the colt up but persevered, and began to make rapid progress on the wide outside. In the closing stages, Acamas overtook the entire field, taking the lead in the last stride and winning by a nose from Frere Basile. Timeform called the race \\"one of the most dramatic of recent classic races\\". By winning the race he became the last major winner for Boussac, who had been experiencing financial difficulties for several years. In the following month, Acamas was matched against older horses for the first time when he was sent to England to contest the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot Racecourse. Starting favourite, he produced a strong run on the outside in the straight, but after veering to the left and then to the right, he was beaten one and a half lengths by the locally trained Ile de Bourbon. Acamas was later disqualified after a post-race urine test revealed traces of salicylic acid, a prohibited substance. Following his run at Ascot, Acamas was bought by the Aga Khan and transferred to the stable of the veteran Fran√ßois Mathet. On his only subsequent appearance as a three-year-old, Acamas started second favourite for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October but finished twelfth of the eighteen runners behind Alleged. Assessment In 1977, the independent Timeform organisation gave Acamas a rating of 126, four pounds behind their top-rated two-year-old Try My Best. In the French Free Handicap, a ranking of the best two-year-olds to compete in France, Acamas was rated second, level with Pyjama Hunt and two pounds behind Super Concorde. In the following year, Acamas described as \\"unquestionably the best French three- year-old\\", rating him on 130, three pounds below Ile de Bourbon. In the official International Classification he was also rated three pounds behind Ile de Bourbon, making him the second best three-year-old in Europe, and the third-best horse of any age. Stud record In August 1978 a half-share in the colt was sold to the Irish breeder Tim Rogers and he began his stud career at the Ballymany Stud, County Kildare in 1979. He had serious fertility problems and sired very few foals. He was returned to racing as an eight-year- old in 1983, but failed to recover his old form finishing last in the Prix Foy and twenty-fourth of the twenty-six runners in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

This would enable the Hermiston Agricultural Research and Extension Center to relocate without the land it is currently on being returned to the federal government. The bill passed the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background According to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), it \\"regularly leases and conveys lands to local governments and nonprofit entities for a variety of public purposes.\\" Those organizations agree to use the land for a public purpose and are able to purchase it at below market value, provided that they return the land or pay the cost difference if they decide to use the land to do something else. In 1950, ordered the BLM to turn over some land in Oregon over to the state of Oregon for agricultural experiments, with the United States keeping all mineral rights. Those lands are now the subject of this bill. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Hermiston Reversionary Interest Release Act would release without consideration any reservation or reversionary interest retained by the United States in connection with the conveyance of certain land by the United States to Oregon depicted as \\"Reversionary Interest Area\\" on the map entitled \\"Hermiston Agricultural Research and Extension Center\\" dated July 23, 2013. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on March 18, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3366 would require the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to convey a reversionary interest in about 290 acres of land to the State of Oregon. The affected lands were conveyed to the state under the condition that interest in the lands would revert to BLM if the state stopped using the land for certain agricultural purposes. Under the bill, that condition would no longer apply. Based on information provided by BLM, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the legislation would have no significant effect on the federal budget. Because we expect that the affected lands would not generate any receipts for the federal government over the next 10 years, CBO estimates that enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 3366 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Hermiston Reversionary Interest Release Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on October 29, 2013 by Rep. Greg Walden (R, OR-2). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation. It was reported (amended) by the committee on April 4, 2014 alongside House Report 113-402. The bill passed the House in a voice vote on May 28, 2014. Debate and discussion At a hearing of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation on February 26, 2014, Assistant Director Michael D. Need of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) testified that BLM could not support the bill unless a variety of amendments were made to its text. The BLM wants the State of Oregon, who would receive the land, to pay for an appraisal of the land (to be conducted by the Department of the Interior's Office of Valuation Services) and then pay the market value of the land. BLM also wants a map of the land in question included in the bill so that there is no confusion. Supporters say that the bill would allow the Center to be moved and the land to be sold to the city to help it grow. According to Rep. Walden, who introduced the bill, the \\"center has fueled these innovations and helped growers in the region maximize use of precious water, fight off new pests and diseases, and achieve record-breaking yields. This common-sense legislation simply places the home of the research center back fully under (local) control.\\" The research center is currently inside the city limits of Hermiston, which it wasn't at the tie it was built. Hermiston Mayor David Drotzmann supported the bill, saying the \\"reversionary interest that the federal government maintains over the Hermiston experiment station deprives our community and OSU of the flexibility it needs to maximize the value of the property and the research done there. As our city continues to rapidly expand around the station, the reversionary interest stands in the way of future development.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3366 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3366 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3366 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3366 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3366 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 3366 *House Report 113-402 on H.R. 3366 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Hermiston, Oregon ","title":"Hermiston Reversionary Interest Release Act"},{"id":"42880740","text":"Trebinje I Hydroelectric Power Station or Trebinje-1 Hydroelectric Power Station is hydroelectric power plant (HPP) on the Trebi≈°njica River near Gornje Granƒçarevo in the municipality of Trebinje in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

He is best known for the annual \\"Bracey Report\\" in which he analyzed current trends in education, often in opposition to prevailing educational policies of the day. The reports were published over a seventeen-year period. The last report was unfinished, and his colleagues at the National Education Policy Center conducted the final revisions and published it in November 2009. Early life and education Gerald Watkins Bracey was born on August 12, 1940. He grew up in Williamsburg, Virginia with his parents, Bettye and Gerald Bracey. Gerald Bracey was amazed at his own children‚Äôs high school experience when compared with his own education in the late 1940s and 1950s. He was amazed that his daughter, during her junior year at a high school in Colorado, was already studying calculus and the writer Ibsen, two topics to which he himself had not been exposed to until college. He also remarked that the complicated science fair experiments that he observed were ‚Äú[l]ight years removed from the simple machines, simple equations, and phyla to be memorized in [his] high school days.‚Äù Bracey attended the College of William and Mary and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology in 1962. He went on to pursue his Ph.D. in psychology at Stanford University, which he eventually received in 1967. Bracey lived in Hong Kong for a year between 1965 and 1966 and traveled around Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe before returning to the United States to finish his doctorate degree. Career While Gerald Bracey is most well known for his work as a critic of educational policies, that distinction came later in his life. After receiving his PhD in Psychology from Stanford in 1967, he first worked as a research psychologist at the Early Childhood Research group for the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey. He was there for three years before moving on to Indiana University in 1970, working as both an assistant professor at the School of Education and Associate Director at the Institute for Child Study until 1973. He worked at Indiana University for another three years, and then decided to travel the world from 1973 to 1977, earning his living from 1974 to 1975 by working as an adjunct of the European Division of University of Maryland‚Äôs Psychology department. He supplemented his income by working as a freelance writer, reviewing various restaurants during the four years he was abroad. In 1977, he returned to the United States and became the Director of Research, Evaluation and Testing at the Virginia Department of Education in Richmond, VA. During his tenure at the Virginia Department of Education he began writing a column titled ‚ÄúResearch‚Äù for the Phi Delta Kappan in 1984; he continued writing for the Phi Delta Kappan until his death in 2009. In 1986 he began working for the Cherry Creek Schools in Engelwood, Colorado as their Director of Research and Evaluation. He left this position in 1991, the same year in which he wrote what later became known as the First Bracey Report. The first Bracey Report began as an article in the Phi Delta Kappan called ‚ÄúWhy Can't They Be Like We Were?‚Äù The article was noticed by The New York Times, Washington Post, Education Week, USA Today, and the Bush administration. The following year, Bracey wrote a sequel to the article. Originally titled ‚ÄúThe True Crisis in Public Education‚Äù, the editors changed the titled to ‚ÄúThe Second Bracey Report on the Condition of Public Education‚Äù, and requested that The Bracey Report become an annual event. Bracey wrote the report every year thereafter. He was working on the 2009 version of the report, which comes out every October, when he died. In 1991, Bracey also founded the Education Disinformation Detection and Reporting Agency (EDDRA) website, whose purpose was to use ‚Äúthe real-time power of the Net to debunk dis- and mis-information about public schools.‚Äù He became a regular blogger for the Huffington Post in 2006. Later life Research and Publications: A lot of Bracey‚Äôs work during his later years was published by the National Education Policy Center (NEPC) at University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado. Policy briefs published by the NEPC include the following: Charter Schools (2000); Ultimate Education Reform? Make Schools Smaller (Gregory A. Smith, Gerald W. Bracey, William Ayers, 2000); A Comparison of the Performance of the Milwaukee Public Schools and School Systems in Selected Other Cities (2000); High-Stakes Testing (2000); School Vouchers (Gerald W. Bracey, Michael W. Apple, 2001); School Reform Proposals: The Research Evidence (Alex Molnar, W. Steven Barnett, Jeremy D. Finn, Craig Howley, Gene V Glass, Douglas Downey, Catherine A.

Bracey, 2002); The Market in Theory Meets the Market in Practice: The Case of Edison Schools (2002); School Reform Proposals: The Research Evidence Executive Summaries (Alex Molnar, W. Steven Barnett, Jeremy D. Finn, Craig Howley, Gene V Glass, Douglas Downey, Catherine A. Lugg, Barak Rosenshine, Robert M. Carini, Haggai Kupermintz, Ulrich C. Reitzug, Gerald W. Bracey, 2002); Recruiting, Preparing and Retaining High Quality Teachers: An Empirical Synthesis (Alex Molnar and Gerald W.

(2004); No Child Left Behind: Where Does the Money Go? (2005); Charter Schools' Performance and Accountability: A Disconnect (2005); and Separate But Superior? A Review of Issues and Data Bearing on Single-Sex Education (2006). The NEPC Legacy Publications include: The AFT Charter School Study: Not News (2004); Bill Gates, If You're So Rich, How Come You're Not Smart (2005). Non-NEPC Publications include: A Lesson Plan for the Schools With Little Learning Behind It (2001); What They Did on Vacation: It's Not Schools That Are Failing Poor Kids (2002); Education's 'Groundhog Day' (2005); and Data Point to Failure (2005). Bracey also had a number of books published in his later years. Among them were: Final Exam: A Study of the Perpetual Scrutiny of American Education (1995); Setting the Record Straight: Responses to Misconceptions About Public Education in America (1997); Bail Me Out! Handling Difficult Data and Tough Questions About Public Schools (2000); and Reading Educational Research: How to Avoid Getting Statistically Snookered (2006). ‚ÄúA booklet, ‚ÄúUnderstanding Education Statistics: It's Easier (And More Important) Than You Think‚Äù was published in early 1997 by Educational Research Service and a revised edition appeared in 2003.‚Äù Gerald Bracey finished his last column on October 20 before he died. He had intended to publish it on his Huffington Post blog. In the column, Bracey was critical of U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, focussing on Duncan‚Äôs years running Chicago Public Schools. Bracey focused on \\"Duncan's decision to outsource the work of trained physical education and health education teachers to the \\"Save-A-Life Foundation.\\" Subsequent investigations showed that Save-A-Life was fraudulent, but ‚ÄúDuncan made no effort, following the revelations regarding the foundation, to retrieve the public money he had authorized be paid to Save-A- Life.\\" In 1994‚Äì95 Bracey was the first Distinguished Fellow for the Agency for Instructional Technology. Bracey won the American Educational Research Association's \\"Relating Research to Practice\\" award in 2003 for his interpretive scholarship of education research. This award recognizes an individual‚Äôs achievements in published works that appear in sources other than peer-reviewed journals or books. In 2006, Bracey began blogging for The Huffington Post; he blogged for them until 2009. He would use the site to post some of his most critical essays. His last post for The Huffington Post criticized the pro-charter school editorials written by The Washington Post and Wall Street Journal. In April 2009, Bracey began using Twitter as another outlet for his analyses of the education system. One of his last tweets read: \\"Thinking that the light at the end of the education tunnel is a standards freight train coming our way. Gonna hurt bad.\\" Personal life and family Gerald Bracey grew up in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he also attended college at the College of William and Mary. Bracey traveled internationally during the 1960s and 70s, visiting countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Bracey also lived abroad in Hong Kong between 1965 and 1966, as well as in Greece. He is noted to have developed a strong penchant for traveling during the 1960s, desiring to ‚Äútravel without itinerary until the money ran out.‚Äù Gerald Bracey also developed expertise in international cuisine, an interest he put to use by writing restaurant reviews. In 1964, he married his first wife, Dorothy Irene Heid, an anthropologist who studied at Harvard. They eventually divorced. Later in his adult life, Bracey lived in Northern Virginia and Port Townsend, Washington. His second marriage was to Iris Bracey, with whom he raised two stepchildren, Noel Petrie and Kira Mekeburg. Iris Bracey was with him at the time of his unexpected death in Port Townsend. It is possible that his death was related to prostate cancer. He died in his sleep at the age of 69. Ideas associated with Gerald Bracey No Child Left Behind and Standardized Testing :One critique of education that Bracey was associated with was the No Child Left Behind Act(NCLB), which he claimed to be failing.Huffington Post, Things Fall Apart: No Child Left Behind Self- Destructs Bracey‚Äôs criticized NCLB, claiming, ‚ÄúNCLB did not have a significant impact on improving reading and math achievement across the nation and states...NCLB has not helped the nation and states significantly narrow the achievement gap.‚Äù One particular concern of Bracey‚Äôs was the emphasis NCLB put on standardized tests. According to Bracey, standardized tests measure only a small amount of what makes education meaningful; tests fail to measure creativity, motivation, critical thinking skills, curiosity, and numerous other characteristics that describe an engaged learner.Huffington Post, No Child Left Behind: A Threat to National Security Bracey‚Äôs concern was that leaders in the field of education increased use of standardized tests was not matched with an increase in understanding how tests can be used. Bracey called for education researchers to provide a clear and objective description of what a standardized test can and cannot do, how these tests are constructed, and how the tests are used in education.Huffington Post, Keeping an Eye on the Unregulated Testing Industry Simpson‚Äôs Paradox :One major statistical paradox that is prevalent in several books and articles written by Bracey is Simpson‚Äôs Paradox. In essence, this paradox describes a situation in which differing sample sizes between two samples can cause one to conclude that one condition is preferable to another in aggregate even when it is worse under both samples. Bracey took it upon himself to educate readers of educational research about the risks of this paradox. He held that much statistics-based research in the field of education made use of this paradox resulting in misinformation.

The book recounts the observations of Isaac Titsingh during his stay in Dejima from 1779 to 1784 in his position as Dutch East India Company (VOC) senior official (opperhoofd). During his stay in Japan, Titsingh had the project of an overall collection on Japanese history, culture and civilization in mind. This project should be his life work and accomplishment. Therefore, he collected and translated data and wrote essays for his collection. In his perception this collection was important in order to show and present the high degree of sophistication of the Japanese people and the importance of the Japanese states, which the Europeans should be informed about. In addition, he also possessed enough and vital material, which would add to the otherwise lack of material on Japan in the 18th century. Titsingh wished to have his collection published in three European languages, important to him: Dutch (his native language), French (language of philosophy) and English, the language which was important for the scientific, natural and modern sciences in the 18th century. He planned to have his book divided into two parts, the first one being a history of Japan, including biographies of the dairis and complemented with biographies on the sh≈çguns of the then-reigning Tokugawa clan, and about the Japanese culture, conditions and customs. This part would consist of a discussion on an individuals life cycle and occasions, including marriage and death, as birth is not a special occasion in Buddhism in Japan. Within this scope he wanted to only include original sources in translations by himself into the collection, as he believed this would distinguish his work from other Japanese travel accounts and stories. Nevertheless, after he left Japan he did not have any access to more complimentary texts and lacked the help of Chinese and Japanese translators. As a consequence it took Titsingh an enormous amount of time to translate the sources and he could only edit some manuscripts or polish over, due to the lack of his fluentness in Japanese. In 1812 his collection was still not published and after his death, his two friends Jean-Pierre Abel- R√©musat and Heinrich Julius von Klaproth, who were both fluent in Chinese and von Klaproth in Japanese, sorted out the remains of his manuscripts and published his work posthumously. This Remusat-Klaproth edition was published in 1820 under the title of Memoires et anecdotes sur la dynastie regnante des djogouns (Memoirs and anecdotes on the reigning dynasty of sh≈çguns). This posthumous work collection was a clear success and therefore an English edition was published in 1822 by Frederic Shoberl, a well-known journalist and translator as Illustrations of Japan. As the original Dutch manuscript by Titsingh was lost, a new Dutch translation was created based on the English edition in 1824-25. Bijzonderheden over Japan (1824). Illustration of an earthquake. Therefore, other editions of the book include: *The First Edition from 1820, published in French by Abel-R√©musat Paris: M√©moires et anecdotes sur la dynastie r√©gnante des djogouns, souverains du Japon avec la description des f√™tes et c√©r√©monies observ√©es aux diff√©rentes √©poques de l'ann√©e √† la cour de ces princes, et un appendice contenant des d√©tails sur la po√©sie des Japonais, leur mani√®re de divisor l'ann√©e, etc.. * The Second Edition from 1822, published in English by R.

About the author  Isaac Titsingh portrayed as Opperhoofd Isaac Titsingh stayed in the Dutch trading post of Dejima from 1779 to 1784 in the position as a VOC senior official. In this time period the only Europeans that were allowed to embark in Japan, were VOC vessels in Nagasaki. He ran the VOC trading station as a chief negotiator of trade between the Japanese and the VOC merchants and officer. Titsingh's goal was to become an ‚Äúauthority on the country‚Äù during his time in Japan. Isaac Titsingh was born in Amsterdam to a family of well-known surgeons. He joined the VOC in 1765 and embarked to Batavia in this year. After becoming a Freemason and was positioned as an 'opperhoofd' in the Japanese factory of the VOC in Dejima he went to Japan in 1779. Titsingh had a Doctorate degree in law and medicine, was a graduate from Leiden University and was one of the most educated Dutchmen that went to Japan in the position as a chief officer of the VOC.

It was founded in July 2012 by the merger of Kanto Auto Works Ltd, Central Motor Co. Ltd and Toyota Motor Tohoku Corporation. History Headquarters in Miyagi, Japan Following the T≈çhoku earthquake, the President of Toyota, Akio Toyoda, announced a reorganisation of the operations for the area, naming it the third production centre after Chubu and Kyushu. On 1 July 2012 Toyota Motors Tohoku, Kanto Auto Works and Central Motors were merged to form Toyota Motor East Japan. The new company focussed on developing and manufacturing compact cars, engines and other components. In August 2012, Toyota Motor East Japan's Higashi-Fuji plant started the production of the second-generation Porte and the Spade, replacing Daihatsu which had assembled the first-generation Porte at its Kyoto plant. In November 2015, Toyota started the process of moving the production of the Vitz from Toyota Industries to Toyota Motor East Japan's Iwate plant with the aim of consolidating compact/subcompact car assembly in the Northeast and reducing costs. The move was completed in October 2018. Toyota also announced it plans to eventually transfer all the Corolla production from Toyota Motor East Japan to its Takaoka plant. Toyota Motor East Japan began manufacturing the second generation Sienta during 2015, replacing Daihatsu as the assembler of that model for Japan. In December 2016, the company started production of the C-HR at its Iwate plant. In November 2017, it started the production of a new version of the JPN Taxi (taxicab for Japan). The previous JPN Taxi models, manufactured at the Higashi-Fuji plant from 1995 onwards, were two versions of the Toyota Comfort. The new JPN Taxi is based on the Sienta and is being assembled at the same location as its predecessor. A full deployment of the new model is expected before the 2020 Olympics. Production of the second- generation Century, a model also assembled at Higashi-Fuji, stopped in January 2017. In 2018, Higashi-Fuji started to manufacture the third-generation Century. In June 2018, Toyota Motor East Japan announced plans to relocate production and employees through its plants within the year. Later, the company also said it would close the Higashi-Fuji plant by 2020 and relocate production of the JPN Taxi and Porte to its Iwate and Miyagi plants. Other models would be transferred to different subsidiaries of the Toyota group. The Higashi-Fuji Technical Centre would continue in operation. In February 2020, the company started deliveries of the Yaris assembled at its Iwate plant, replacing the Vitz nameplate. Facilities The company has plants for assembly at Miyagi (Ohira), Iwate (Kanegasaki, Iwate) and Higashi-Fuji (Susono, Shizuoka). There are two overseas bases, one in Brazil and other in Thailand. The head offices are in Miyagi. Products , Toyota cars produced by Toyota Motor East Japan include: the Century, the Porte, the JPN Taxi, the Spade (Higashi-Fuji); the Sienta, the Corolla (Miyagi); the Aqua, the C-HR, the Yaris (Iwate).

Dating to the 12th century with later additions, there was almost certainly an earlier church on the site. The existing structure is a Grade II listed building and is located beside Manor Park. History of St Michael's Legend says Nell Gwynn's stillborn child with Charles II is buried in the churchyard The land on which St Michael's now stands was personally owned by Alfred the Great and when he died he left the land to the monks of Winchester Cathedral. The church was probably built sometime between 1120 and 1150. The earliest mention of St Michael's church dates to 1121 and concerns wax for candles. The church is mentioned again in 1171 regarding an annual payment made by the parish of Aldershot to the Priory of St Swithun for the maintenance of three lights to burn continually before the High Altar there.History of St Michael's Church, Aldershot - Rushmoor Borough Council Website In 1399 the parish priest, John Bertone, was severely attacked while officiating in the church. By 1400 the church was in a state of collapse and Bishop William of Wykeham sequestrated the Rectory of Crondall to pay for the necessary repairs. However, this seems to have achieved little because the church was reportedly still in a poor condition some 80 years later. In 1481 John Awbrey pledged 'My Manor at Aldershot' for a loan from the London Charterhouse of ¬£126 in order to restore the church. He and his wife are buried in the chancel. A funerary helm in the Lady Chapel The registers of baptisms, marriages and burials were first begun by William Shakford in 1571,'About Aldershot' - Kellys Directory of Hampshire (1898) - Aldershot Civic Society website and are still in use. During the Civil War a curate of the parish, Thomas Hollinshead, was ejected in 1641. In 1645 during the same conflict, Royalist troops invaded the village of Aldershot and set fire to it but St Michael's was spared the fire and survived. There is a local legend that, after the Restoration, Nell Gwyne, making a journey from Portsmouth to London in 1678, stopped over in the area where she gave birth to a stillborn child of Charles II, with medical help coming from 'Old Mother Squall' who lived near the church; the child was said to have been buried under a tree in the churchyard. It was claimed that for this assistance the King made an annual grant of ¬£200 to the church, but no record of this has ever been found. The jurist Charles Viner (1678‚Äì1756) and his wife are buried in the churchyard and have a wall memorial in the church. The clock was installed in 1799 (as well as a turret bell) and in 1801 fear of body snatching resulted in the distinctive brick-arched graves in the churchyard. The Rev John West was a former vicar of the parish (1818-1820) and went on to become the missionary founder of the Church in Canada.Biography of Rev J.H. West in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography In 1855, during the Crimean War, the Army came to Aldershot, which saw a major expansion not just in the town but also in St Michael's church. During this period the nearby Holy Trinity church was built to be nearer the Camp. From 1859 to 1912 St Michael's underwent a period of development and expansion, including the addition of an aisle, the rebuilding of the nave, and a new organ. Here in 1864 was baptised Edgar Sheldrake who went on to become a first-class cricketer.Edgar Francis Tolman Sheldrake in the England, Select Births and Christenings, 1538-1975 Also here Alfred Toye VC married Flora Robertson in 1918. The marriage of local actor and comedian Arthur English to dancer Teresa Mann was held at the church in 1977, and in 1995 his funeral service was held there, following which he was cremated at the Park Crematorium in Aldershot. Structure of the church The nave looking east During the reign of Elizabeth I the tower was rebuilt and formed part of a chain of beacons to warn against the threatened invasion of the Spanish.St Michael's on the Church of England website It is built from local 'galleted' iron stone with mortar and flints and dressings of narrow red bricks. There is a chancel, a nave of five bays, north aisle, and south porch. The nave was restored and the north aisle added in 1868, so that the tower, the chancel and the Lady Chapel extension of 1380 are the only ancient parts of the original church to survive. The chancel contains monuments dedicated to the local Whyte and Tichborne families. There are also stained glass windows in memory of members of the Newcome family. The Bells The light eight were recast and rehung by John Taylor of Loughborough in early 1960. The first bell in the tower was hung in the late 14th century, with additional bells being added in 1611 and 1624. When the church was enlarged in 1911 the oldest bell was recast and three other bells added, making a ring of six. After World War I two trebles were donated by soldiers in Aldershot Camp in memory of their colleagues who had been killed in that conflict, and these are known as the 'Soldier's Bells'.

Comparative metagenomic studies involve the large-scale comparison of genomic or taxonomic census data from bacterial samples across different environments. Historically this has required a sound knowledge of statistics, computer programming, genetics and microbiology. As a result, only a small number of researchers are routinely able to perform comparative metagenomic studies. To circumvent these limitations, METAGENassist was developed to allow metagenomic analyses to be performed by non-specialists, easily and intuitively over the web. METAGENassist is particularly notable for its rich graphical output and its extensive database of bacterial phenotypic information. Features METAGENassist is designed to support a wide range of statistical comparisons across metagenomic samples. METAGENassist accepts a wide range of bacterial census data or taxonomic profile data derived from 16S rRNA data, classical DNA sequencing, NextGen shotgun sequencing or even classical microbial culturing techniques. These taxonomic profile data can be in different formats including standard comma-separated value (CSV) formats or in program-specific formats generated by tools such as mothur and QIIME. Once the data are uploaded to the website, METAGENassist offers users a large selection of data pre-processing and data quality checking tools such as: 1) taxonomic name normalization; 2) taxonomic-to-phenotypic mapping; 3) data integrity/quality checks and 4) data normalization. METAGENassist also supports an extensive collection of classical univariate and multivariate analyses, such as fold-change analysis, t-tests, one-way ANOVA, partial least- squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and principal component analysis (PCA). Each of these analyses generates colorful, informative graphs and tables in PNG or PDF formats. All of the processed data and images are also available for download. These data analysis and visualization tools can be used to visualize key features that distinguish or characterize microbial populations in different environments or in different conditions. METAGENassist distinguishes itself from most other metagenomics data analysis tools through its extensive use of automated taxonomic-to-phenotypic mapping and its ability to support sophisticated data analyses with the resulting phenotypic data. METAGENassist‚Äôs phenotype database covers more than 11,000 microbial species annotated with 20 different phenotypic categories, including oxygen requirements, energy source(s), metabolism, and GC content. This gives users substantially more features with which to compare and analyze different samples. The phenotype database is regularly updated with information retrieved from several resources including BacMap, GOLD, and other NCBI taxonomy resources.

The directive sets out common rules on the digitisation and online display of orphan works. After a diligent search has been completed, a work can be registered at the orphan works register of the European Union Intellectual Property Office. Registering a work at that database allows for certain permitted uses of that work by cultural heritage institutions. Only such institutions are allowed to submit an orphaned work to the register. In case a copyright holder comes forward later, they are entitled to stop the institution's usage of the work and to ask for a retroactive license fee. The directive's diligent search requirements have been criticized as burdensome and unworkable. Basis Orphan works are works like books, newspaper articles, or films, which may be protected under copyright but for which the copyright holder cannot be found. A substantial portion of the collections of Europe's cultural institutions are orphan works (e.g. the British Library estimates that 40 per cent of its copyrighted collections, 150 million works in total, are orphan works). Orphan works are not available for legal use by filmmakers, archivists, writers, musicians, and broadcasters. Public libraries, educational institutions and museums, that digitise old manuscripts, books, sound recordings and film, may choose to not digitise orphan works, or make orphan works available to the public, for fear that a re-appearing rights-holder may sue them for damages. The EU had set out large- scale digitisation programs (such as Europeana) and in order for these programs to be successful, common rules on how to deal with orphan works needed to be established. By early 2016, more than three years after the directive's enactment, the orphan works register only contained 1,435 works, which critics cited as evidence \\"that the EU approach to orphan works is unreasonably complex and won‚Äôt adequately address the problem it‚Äôs trying to fix,\\" namely enabling mass digitization efforts. After six years, in 2018, the number had reached 6,000. Works Covered by the Directive This directive applies to the following orphan works that were created in the EU: * printed works (books, journals, magazines and newspapers) * cinematographic and audio- visual works * phonograms * works embedded or incorporated in other works or phonograms (e.g. pictures in a book) Under certain conditions, the directive can also apply to unpublished works (such as letters or manuscripts). Whether orphaned software and video games (\\"Abandonware\\") fall under the audiovisual works definition is debated. Function The directive provides regulations on how to identify orphan works. An organisation that wishes to digitise a work in question has to conduct a scrupulous search to find its copyright holder. In this search, it should rely on sources such as databases and registries like ARROW for text and image-based works. A registry for orphan film is currently developed by ACE ‚Äì Association of European Film Archives and Cinematheques in the FORWARD project.http://www.project-forward.eu A diligent search guideline and tool has also been developed by the EnDOW project.http://www.heritageportal.eu/News-Events/Latest-News/EnDOW-Heritage- Plus-Project-Profile.html. By 2017, its tool for diligent searches was available for 20 European Union Member states. Around that time, a study by EnDOW researchers warned that \\"the absence of hierarchical validity of the appropriate sources for Diligent Search leave the clearing of rights uncertain\\" and that \\"only the free accessibility of hierarchized sources will make Diligent Search workable\\". At the time of the launch of the directive in 2012, it had been hoped that other sectors would develop similar information databases. The directive also establishes that if a search does not find the identity or location of the copyright holder, the work shall be officially recognised as an orphan work. This status shall be valid for the whole of the European Union, which means the organisation will be able to make it available online in all Member States. The directive also foresaw the establishment of a single European registry of all recognised orphan works to be set up and run by EUIPO, the European Union Intellectual Property Office based in Alicante. This database went live in October 2014 as a publicly accessible online platform. Works identified as orphan works can be used by beneficiary organisations to achieve aims related to their public interest mission. They will be allowed to conclude public-private partnerships with commercial operators and to generate revenues from the use of orphan works to cover digitisation costs. Under this directive, a reappearing copyright-holder can assert his/her copyright and thereby end the orphan work status, and is entitled to license fees from the cultural institution for its usage of the work while it had orphan status. The Directive was influenced by a survey of the state of intellectual property law in the United Kingdom called the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth. James Boyle, one of the experts consulted for the Review, acknowledged the directive as \\"a start\\", but offered this criticism of the resulting policy:\\"(When) Is Copyright Reform Possible?

Plot The novel is set in Reykjav√≠k,cf. Tine Maria Winther, 'Isl√¶nding portr√¶tterer dansk kannibal Hvad g√∏r man, n√•r far √¶der ens kammerater? M√∏d islandske Th√≥rarinn Leifsson', Politiken kultur, 12 December 2009, http://politiken.dk/kultur/boger/interview_boger/article858449.ece. in a dystopian future in which the world is largely controlled by a bank called Gullbanki ('Gold Bank'). Gullbanki was once a small bank but, by speculating on uncaught fish and on land, grew, and bought up first other banks and ultimately everything in the world. Schooling is merely instrumental, the Internet has been prohibited, people are discouraged from reading, and books are largely unavailable. The protagonist's elder brother S√≥li is brought into debt slavery during his teens through mobile phone bills, while parents find themselves effectively offering themselves as collateral for property purchases, and are taken away to work for Gullbanki when they default on their debts (as they inevitably do). The novel's protagonist is Albert√≠na Haraldsd√≥ttir, an eleven-year-old girl whose family has, at the start of the story, recently moved into a new block of flats, Gullb√∫ri√∞ ('Gilded Cage'), built as part of a housing boom and characterised by impersonality, and screens in every room which cannot be switched off and which continually broadcast adverts. Gullbanki's representative at Gullb√∫ri√∞ is the self- important but ultimately hapless H√°var M. Gr√≠msson, who is shown to be able to use his wealth to control the mayor of Reykjav√≠k. It emerges that Albert√≠na's family, having defaulted on the loans for their pleasant house, has been sent to live in the flat by Gullbanki to advertise the new block; Albert√≠na has to spend several hours a day standing in the window dressed in a frock as a living advertisement. Albert√≠na's brother has already been taken away by Gullbanki and both Albert√≠na's parents and those of her friends are also seized in the earlier part of the book. Gullbanki's power is subverted by a number of forces. One of Albert√≠na's schoolfriends, Valgar√∞ur (Valli) veira, has perceived and explains Gullbanki's business practices. Meanwhile, Albert√≠na teaches herself to read by inspecting instructions on bathroom products. Crucially, the witch Arnhei√∞ur Huld, Albert√≠na's cigar-smoking great-great-grandmother on her father's side and the Granny Huld of the book's title, escapes from her old people's home at the age of 158 to join Albert√≠na and her family in Gullb√∫ri√∞. With the help of a number of dwarvish minions whom she has used her magical powers to enslave, Huld moves in her million- book library, giving Albert√≠na and her friends access to knowledge which they work voraciously to acquire. One of the more dramatic effects of this reading is that Albert√≠na acquires the power to breathe fire like a dragon. Valli veira plans to become a suicide bomber in a futile attempt to resist Gullbanki's power but is eventually discouraged by Huld and Albert√≠na, who instead lead a more effective assault on Gullbanki. Huld uses her magic to fly Gullb√∫ri√∞ to the space-station where Gullbanki is based, taking the opportunity to curse H√°var into becoming another of her dwarfish minions, exposing his own powerlessness in the face of Gullbanki, along with his loneliness and need for friendship. It transpires that the parents and relatives of Albert√≠na and her friends are working in the space-station, but so engrossed are they by their pointless labours for Gullbanki, and the spurious internal competitions that characterise the business, that they are unable to spare their children any time; indeed it is later only by adopting the hollow marketing methods of Gullbanki itself that the children are able to convince them to flee the doomed space station. Eventually, Albert√≠na is at least able to free her brother S√≥li from Gullbanki's ideological grip and with him she, Huld and her friends find and face Gullbanki's director B√∂√∞var gamli. B√∂√∞var turns out to be an ex-boyfriend of Huld's and to have played bass in a band in which Huld herself played drums, and to have been driven to his megalomaniacal spree of financial acquisitions by bitterness at Huld's rejection of him. Eventually, B√∂√∞var and Huld kill each other, and the children are able to engineer the evacuation of Gullbanki's space station, reuniting with their parents in Reykjav√≠k and ushering in a new age of enlightened living.

Militants during the civil war in Tajikistan forced the crew to take more passengers than the aircraft was able to carry, which led to an excess takeoff weight. Unable to take off, the aircraft overran the runway at high speed, struck several obstacles and fell into the Panj River. The crash remains the deadliest accident involving a Yakovlev Yak-40 and the deadliest aviation accident in Tajikistan. Crash During boarding at the Tajik city of Khorugh the militants, controlling the adjacent area during the civil war, threatened the crew with weapons and forced it to take 81 passengers, while the aircraft was designed to carry only 28. This led the maximum takeoff weight to be exceeded by 3,000 kg. The crew was forced to take off under the threat of shooting. The left main landing gear struck a low earth embankment, 148 or 150 m beyond the runway end. Then the aircraft struck a boulder 60 cm high. Subsequently, the right gear struck a concrete pillbox 60 m further. The aircraft ultimately fell into the Panj River and disintegrated. Four passengers survived.

Known as the Islington Murderess, she became an international cause c√©l√®bre, examined in the world's press, both houses of the British Parliament, and even Queen Victoria's inner circle . Her case, recently rediscovered , reignited the fierce debates on crime and insanity, capital punishment and crime and gender. Early life Born 1 July 1827, she was the fourth of eight children from a respectable family of silversmiths in the north London borough of Islington . An accomplished pianist and teacher of music, she performed regularly at the famed St Martin's Hall, Covent Garden as a member of the greatly respected and hugely popular John Hullah school of music . In 1845, aged 18, she gave birth to an illegitimate daughter, also named Celestina . Because of the hardships and social stigmas for unmarried mothers in the Victorian period, the child immediately was handed over to a baby-farmer , with whom she lived until the girl's premature and violent death at the age of just 10. She does, however, appear to have maintained some degree of contact . In 1854, Celestina sr married Charles (Karl) Sommer, a Prussian migrant working in the metalwork and jewellery business , possibly with or even for Celestina's father The pair were married by licence at St Mary's, Islington Parish Church, Middlesex . From the beginning, they lived in Charles' house, in a nearby area redeveloped as the Packington Estate . Crime On 16 February 1856, after collecting her estranged daughter from her foster parent living at an address in Hackney , Celestina led her back to the marital home where, in the front cellar, she cut her throat . The event was witnessed aurally by Rachel Munt, maid-of-all-work, sleeping in the kitchen adjacent to where the crime was committed . The next day, Munt managed to raise the alarm without alerting her mistress , and at 4.30 pm on 17 February, both Celestina and Charles were arrested on suspicion of murder . Inspector Edward Hutton and Sergeant Edwin Townsend removed the pair to Hoxton police station. =Remand hearing= Two hearings in front of the magistrate, William Corrie JP,The Law Magazine and Law Review, vol. 10 no. 19, p198 held at Clerkenwell Police Court, Bagnigge Wells Road (now King's Cross Road) identified the dead girl as Celestina's daughter and deduced (incorrectly) a motive for the killing. Charles was freed after rejecting any idea of his involvement. He was out of the house on the evening of the murder and never met his wife's illegitimate child. =Coroner's inquest= The inquest, was held at the North Pole Inn, New-north road, Islington. The jury cited Celestina Sommer as complicit in her daughter's demise. As the key witness, Rachel Munt went home towards Hoxton, she and her sister were chased by an angry mob toward Arlington Street. Townsend and fellow police sergeant George Beckley, managed to whisk them away through a rear door of the Rydon Arms pub (now a private house), only for the crowd to renew their chase beyond Shepherdess Walk. Near the canal bridge, close by the Block Inn (now a private residence), the two policemen were forced to make a stand. Two passers-by escorted the sisters home via separate routes.\\"Morning Chronicle\\" 23 February 1856 =Trial= Celestina appeared at the Central Criminal Court (Old Bailey), on two occasions, with the first hearing on 7 March adjourned to allow defence counsel to investigate her mental health. On 10 April, at her second trial, after 15 minutes deliberation by the jury, she was found guilty of the willful murder of her daughter. In the dock, Celestina was described as being pallid and weak, allowed to sit through the hearing and requested the smelling salts from the warder. As the guilty verdict was read, she was said to slump almost to the floor. Justice Crompton donned the Black Cap, then pronounced the sentence of death. =Criminal insanity= At the time of her crime, the country could not agree on what constituted insanity nor whether or not it offered exculpation for a criminal act. No formal plea was entered by her defence counsel. =Her supporters= Despite the notoriety of both herself and her crime, Sommer did attract support, based largely on her claimed but legally rejected insanity. Many [who?] insisted she was of unsound mind, at least at the time of her act. Alfred Dymond, Secretary of the Society for the Abolition of Capital Punishment, was one of the more energetic, writing later about her case in his 1865 treatise on controversial cases The law on its trial.Dymond 1865 As part of the response, her solicitor, Charles Octavius Humphreys, forwarded a memorial to the Home Secretary Sir George Grey. Whatever the tipping point, the politician came to Sommer's rescue. A Prison Matron (A Prison Matron 1862), recounting Celestina Sommer the individual, wrote after her death how she had died \\"a confirmed lunatic\\". =Reprieve= Sir George Grey attracted severe criticism when he belatedly commuted the death sentence, first to transportation and then penal servitude for life. News of Somner's respite arrived at Newgate Gaol the day of her execution, though the paperwork only arrived the day after. It was, though, his flat refusal to reveal his reasoning which created the greater outcry as politicians, lawyers, press, and the public alike, clamored for an explanation. In one response to more questions in the House of Commons, Earl Granville, Lord President of the Council, confirmed the minister had recorded his reasons for her commutation in a letter prepared for his successor as was apparently normal practice.HL Deb 06 June 1856 vol 142 cc1056-9 The letter, though, has never come to light. =Outcry= \\"... a she-devil who deliberates, inveigles her child into her den, and cuts her throat, adding to the horror and barbarity of the act by vociferations of her resolution to perpetrate it in answer to the prayers of her struggling victim, is thought a proper object for the clemency of the Crown by the Home Office\\" cited in the Glasgow Herald.Glasgow Herald, 21 May 1856 The outcry at her apparent escape from justice reverberated around the world. Sommer became the cause c√©l√®bre in debates about crime and the death penalty, insanity, and women felons. Parliamentary discourse, select committees, articles and books were joined by popular accusations of nepotism, racial favouritism, royal collusion and gender bias, the latter predicated on her being 'a pretty woman'.Weekly Dispatch 18 May 1856 The world's press were fervent: elevating her from 'just' another murderess to one who became renowned and despised across the globe. Aftermath Sommer spent several years moving through the British penal system, during which time her insanity grew more obvious. Firstly in Newgate Gaol, on death row, during which she shared a cell with two other, contemporary murderers, Elizabeth Ann Harris and Mary Alice Seago. Then at Millbank, the great Panopticon, and finally Brixton Women's Prison,Mayhew & Binny 1862 where her physical health deteriorated rapidly, as did her mind. She eventually was transferred to Fisherton House Lunatic AsylumCrittal 1962: Fisherton Anger near Salisbury, Wiltshire which, at the time, was the largest criminal lunatic asylum outside the now overcrowded Bethlem. (Broadmoor had been conceived but not yet built.) Death and burial Celestina Sommer died, aged 31, on 11 April 1859. Her post-mortem revealed \\"hemiplegia (stroke) from congestion of and serous effusion on the brain\\", plausibly consistent with brain damage and a possible physical cause of insanity. Nevertheless, many maintained that she had wrongly escaped justice, and others suggested there were other, non-physical reasons for her very real madness. On 16 April, she was buried, as so many inmates from Fisherton House then were, in the new municipal cemetery at Fisherton Anger. A stone plaque was erected but today nothing remains to indicate where she was laid to rest.J7/170/4, J7/190 - Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre Debate Crime and insanity: Celestina Sommer committed her crime in the midst of ferocious debates between the legal and medical professions, the latter centred around the controversial alienists (\\"psychiatrists who assesses the competence of a defendant in a law court\\" - OED). At the same time, there remained no absolute definition of insanity, nor of its mitigation for a criminal act, save for the equally controversial M'Naghten Rules formulated in 1843. Many, including her jury, felt the crime had been too planned, too premeditated, for it to be considered a true act of insanity. The death penalty: Although Celestina Sommer's escape from the gallows was contentious, there was a growing dissatisfaction with the death penalty. The last woman to be hanged had been Rebecca Smith in 1849.Brooks 2013 Organisations such as the Society for the Abolition of Capital Punishment, politicians like William Ewart and various peers, called for the complete revocation of the ultimate sanction. (This was not achieved in Britain until 1965, following the deaths of Peter Anthony Allen and Gwynne Owen Evans for the murder of a former colleague. The last woman to be hanged in Britain, in 1955, was Ruth Ellis.) Even as late as 1864/1865, The Royal Commission on Capital Punishment cited Sommer's as a case-in-point. Crime and gender: Beyond the seditious claims of Sommer's escape being due to her gender and acclaimed good looks, this was the time of increased exoneration for criminal women, especially mothers. Infanticide was seen as different from cold-blooded murder, with puerperal insanity frequently cited as a mitigating force. Ongoing efforts at female emancipation lent a voice to the perceived wider injustices of a patriarchal society and the preordained role of women at home. Infamy Literary works: Contemporary accounts and comments were rife, including The Lancet, The Economist, Charles Dickens' Household Words, and virtually every newspaper around the globe, including The Times in England and The Sydney Herald in Australia. Modern references: The sources largely have been academic, citing her case as a model study. Smith's Trial by Medicine Smith 1981 and Showalter's The Female MaladyShowalter 1987(1985) are examples.

She was an international leader in photonuclear physics using beams of electrons, positrons and neutrons from high-energy accelerators to probe nuclear structure. Over a period of over 5 decades her research interests included precision measurements of photo- neutron production cross sections; studies of the scattering and absorption of photons by deformed nuclei; the study of the nuclear photo-effect in oriented nuclei; and measurements of electron spectra and (e,p) and (e,Œ±) reactions. Early life and Education Evans was born February 17, 1922 in Camp Dix, New Jersey. She graduated in 1942 from Smith College with a B.A. in physics, magna cum laude, and from University of California, Berkeley with a PhD. Her graduate studies were at the University of California, where she received an M.S. in 1945 and Ph.D. in 1947. From 1950 to 1990, she worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. She won a Guggenheim Fellowship. Measurements of photoatomic cross-sections and magnetic resonances were among her contribution to physics. Career Evans' thesis research was on the ionization produced by high-energy cosmic-ray electrons with a cloud chamber in order to determine whether the probable ionization produced by a high velocity particle continues to rise logarithmically with energy. She did postgraduate work at the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley from 1947- 1950, that included cloud-chamber studies of synchrotron produced electrons and cyclotron produced mesons. She also made measurements of the angular distribution of protons scattered by neutrons in the neutron beam from the Berkeley cyclotron, again using a cloud chamber. The results showed that the scattering is not isotropic in the center of mass system and that it is not symmetric about 90 degrees. The peak of protons in the forward direction indicated that a certain amount of charge exchange is taking place between the neutron and proton. Continuing her work with neutrons, she measured the energy spectrum of delayed neutrons from 17O leading to information on the excited states of 17O. At Berkeley she met her future husband Raymond Hayward and in 1950 they were both recruited to the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). Her initial experimental work at NBS was with gamma rays from a 60Co source and a 50 MeV betatron. When NBS moved from Washington DC to Gaithersburg, MD and the 150 MeV linac became available, she could do more difficult experiments since the electron beam current was much more intense. One of her first collaborations at NBS was with John Hubbell. They made measurements to determine the albedo of 1-MeV photons reflected from semi-infinite slabs of water, aluminum, copper, tin, and lead at various angles of incidence. They then did Monte Carlo calculations using a desk calculator that confirmed the experimental results. Evans then worked with William Dodge on linac experiments to test theories for bremsstrahlung, of real and virtual photon interactions with nuclei, and of elastic scattering of photons. Particularly elegant was the theory of Arenhoevel and Hayward on scattering of plane-polarized photons by the giant resonances of nuclei. The equally elegant experimental application of this theory was described in an article by Hayward, Barber, and Sazama in which ‚Äúa beam of plane-polarized monochromatic photons‚Äù from a carbon target in a linac bremsstrahlung beam was ‚Äúproduced by the resonance fluorescence of the well-known 1+ state at 15.1 MeV in 12C. These photons were scattered a second time from natural targets of Cd, Sn, Ta, W, Pt, Au, and Bi‚Äù. This was indeed a brute force method of avoiding the problem caused by x ray sources with broad energy spectra in order to study nuclear phenomena at a single gamma-ray energy, in this case 15.1 MeV. Evans and her friend the theorist Mike Danos shared an office at NBS for decades. As they became senior staff they were more than once offered separate offices but they refused. This was explained as being really useful for a theorist to have daily contact with an experimentalist and hear what was going on in that field, and vice versa. One group of photonuclear experiments she did showed that the \\"giant resonance\\" in ellipsoidal nuclei peaked at two different energies, corresponding to the major and minor axes of the ellipsoid, and the relative strengths of the two peaks depended on whether the ellipsoid was oblate or prolate, all as predicted by Mike Danos. Her colleague Everett Fuller was the world authority on the bibliography of photonuclear reactions. When Fuller retired, Evans continued that work and made it possible for the library to be available at a number of laboratories. Now it is available at the Moscow State University Institute of Nuclear Physics Centre for Photonuclear Experiments Data, the National Nuclear Data Center at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the IAEA Nuclear Data Section in Vienna, Austria. Those data formed the basis of a digital database \\"Photonuclear Data Index.\\" In addition to the work on the photonuclear reactions bibliography, she made a number of measurements of photonuclear cross sections to contribute to the database. Her collaboration with Wolynec, Martins and Dodge for photo- and electronuclear reactions led to publications that are well-known throughout the world. Evans retired from NBS/NIST in 1990 but maintained collaborations with many scientists at NBS/NIST and throughout the world. She remarked that she always wore attire so as to have a professional appearance and not cause distraction during the experiments. Evans was a woman physicist at a time when very few physicists were women. She knew she had to excel in her field in order to be recognized for her work and she did. She suffered some level of gender discrimination at various times even at NBS. But her peers and direct supervisors recognized her extraordinary accomplishments and the value she brought to NBS. She was a natural leader and was selected as Group Leader for the Nuclear Research Group in 1975. She also served as Deputy Chief of the Nuclear Radiation Division 1978 -1980. She travelled widely to participate in experiments at high-energy accelerators and to lecture at academic institutions. She was a Guggenheim Fellow at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen 1961 -1962; a Guest Professor at the Institute for Nuclear Physics Goethe University 1966; Sir Thomas Lyle Fellow University of Melbourne 1969; a Visiting Professor of physics University of Toronto 1975; a Guest professor of experimental physics Max Planck Institute, Mainz 1982 -1986; a Senior Visiting Scientist Nuclear Physics Laboratory Oxford 1985 -1986;a Visiting professor of physics at Duke University 1987; a Visiting Scientist at the Physics Institute University of Lund 1987; an Adjunct Professor of physics Duke University 1990. In addition to these professional activities, she found herself becoming a ‚Äúcommittee person‚Äù in the 1970s. She was selected by President Richard Nixon to serve on the General Advisory Committee to the Atomic Energy Commission. She was a member of the Advisory Screening Committee in Physics for the Committee on International Exchange of persons (Senior Fulbright-Hays Program). In that capacity she reviewed applications for Fulbright Scholarships in the field of physics. She was also a member of Maryland Governor Mandel‚Äôs Science Advisory Council, which assists the governor with scientific problems and forecasts of future scientific information and their relation to the state of Maryland. Evans received the Department of Commerce Silver Medal in 1958 and Gold Medal in 1971. She was a recipient of the Federal Women‚Äôs Award in 1975 and the NBS Samuel Wesley Stratton Award in 1980. Evans was selected as an NBS Fellow 1987 and in 1995 was selected to the NIST Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Scientists, Engineers and Administrators. She was a Fellow of the American Physical Society. After she was fully retired, she started taking evening classes at American University in areas such as politics and international relations, Spanish and Italian. When asked why she was taking them she said she still wants to learn. Evans was predeceased by her husband Ray and two sons. Her colleagues from around the world have expressed their condolences and their appreciation for the support and encouragement Evans offered for their research. Death Evans Hayward died March 2, 2020, in Chevy Chase, Maryland from heart disease.

Created a baronet at the English Restoration, he inherited the Godstone estate in 1664. He quarreled extensively with his family to obtain more money and impaired the estate with debts from a profligate lifestyle. The baronetcy became extinct upon his death and his entailed estates passed to his brother George. He was the second but first surviving son of Sir John Evelyn and his wife Thomasine Heynes. Evelyn married Mary Farmer, daughter of George Farmer, prothonotary of the Common Pleas, about 1653. As part of his marriage settlement, his father bestowed on him two manors in Godstone, Marden (now in Woldingham) and Flower, and the manor of Tillingdon in Tandridge. Evelyn was created a baronet on 29 May 1660 and was proposed as a Knight of the Royal Oak, with an income of ¬£1,800 per year. His wife Mary died in 1663, without issue. Late in 1664, he married Anne Glynne (d. 1691), daughter of John Glynne, by whom he had one daughter, Frances (d. 1681). Sir John succeeded his father in 1664, inheriting an extensive estate in Godstone, including the manors of Walkhampstead or Godstone, Godstone Place, Lee Place, Marden, and Flower in Godstone. He was appointed High Sheriff of Surrey for the year 1666. Sir John was on bad terms with the rest of his family, filing a bill in the Court of Exchequer Chamber alleging that, being out of the country when his father died, his mother and brother George had taken the opportunity to withhold papers showing Sir John's right to certain of his father's lands. Lady Evelyn and George denied these charges, and added that Sir John had extorted certain lands from his father while the latter was alive, to avoid a lawsuit, taken a part of Lady Evelyn's jointure, and that Lady Evelyn had felt compelled to flee the family seat less than a month after her husband's death because of Sir John's temper. He was reported by John Aubrey to have demolished the manor house at Godstone because his brother would not grant him money \\"to satisfy his vicious Inclinations\\". Shortly before his death on 10 August 1671, Sir John conveyed Marden Park (including Tillingdon) and Flower to his mistress Mary Gittings. She in turn sold them to Robert Clayton and John Morris in 1672 (Marden) and 1677 (Flower). He was buried at Godstone. The baronetcy became extinct, and the entailed estates passed to his brother George; Sir John left ¬£500 to his legitimate daughter Frances, whom he repudiated, and ¬£500 per year to his natural daughter by Gittings, who shared her mother's name. George brought an action against her to prove her undue influence on Sir John's will, but was not successful in recovering Marden and Flower.

After her father had bought the Duchy of Bernstadt from Henry III, Duke of M√ºnsterberg-Oels in 1574 the von Schindel family gained a big influence in the Silesian aristocracy in the last decades of the 16th century and made a significant social rise. The von Schindels had the right to use the title of a Duke exclusively in connection with their property and as long as they were owners of the Duchy of Bernstadt, which covers the period of 30 years (1574-1604).  Family  Her parents were Heinrich von Schindel zu Sasterhausen, since 1574 the Duke of Bernstadt, and his wife Elizabeth von Nimptsch. Catherine had one more sister named Barbara von Schindel zu Sasterhausen, who married into the von Kanitz and von Muhlheim families and died in 1622. Her ancestors were members of the families Zedlitz- Nimmersatt, Schweinichen, Nimptsch, and Stosch. Her distant relative was Charlotte Helene von Schindel, the royal-mistress of the King Frederick IV of Denmark.  Marriage and children  Catherine von Schindel was at her time considered to be a very wealthy heiress. As the oldest daughter of her parents she inherited the Duchy of Bernstadt, including the seat of the Duchy which was the Bernstadt Palace, where Catherine and her family resided since 1574 till 1604. Besides Bernstadt she owned the properties Sasterhausen and Steffansdorf. She was considered to be a good catch from early on and had therefore had many Silesian aristocrats courting her. She married three of them.Der deutsche Herold: Zeitschrift f√ºr Wappen-, Siegel- u. Familienkunde, Verein Herold, 1874. In 1575 she married for the 1st time, at the age of 16, Ernst von Gellhorn from the Peterswaldau estate, the son of George von Gellhorn and Catherine von Reichenbach. Catherine's grand nephew from this marriage was the Count Ernst von Gellhorn (1617-1679), who was known as the richest and very powerful man in Silesia at the time and who even succeeded to marry a Princess from the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg, a 1st cousin of Eleonora Princess of Liechtenstein (1655-1702). Catherine's husband died at an early age after one year of marriage in which no children were born. Catherine's residence in Bernstadt In 1578 Catherine married for the 2nd time George II von Dyhrn und Sch√∂nau, owner of the city of Festenberg and of the properties Ulbersdorf, Gimmel, Reesewitz etc., the son of Nicholas III von Dyhrn und Sch√∂nau and his 1st wife Lucia von Blanckenstein. George von Dyhrn was the head of the government of the Duchy of Oels and the right hand of Henry III, Duke of M√ºnsterberg-Oels and of his brother Charles II, Duke of M√ºnsterberg-Oels. With him she had three children: * Anna Elisabeth von Dyhrn und Sch√∂nau, married to George III von Wiedebach * Hans Georg I von Dyhrn und Sch√∂nau, a Silesian chamberlain, diplomat and a secondary Oberhofmeister at the Habsburg-court in Vienna, married to Baroness Elizabeth von Nimptsch- R√∂versdorf * Catharina von Dyhrn und Sch√∂nau, married to Caspar von Posadowsky-Postelwitz The family resided at the Bernstadt Palace until 1596. In the meantime (in 1587) Catherine's 2nd husband died. She was the main heir of the property of Festenberg and brought it as a dowry into her third marriage. In 1596 she married for the 3rd time her brother-in-law's cousin Caspar von K√∂ckritz und Friedland, the son of Sigismund von K√∂ckritz und Friedland and Anne von Kanitz. He was the owner of the properties Linsen and Neudorf. They had one son: * Sigismund von K√∂ckritz und Friedland (1601-1664), married to Baroness Maria Saurma von und zu der Jeltsch. He inherited Festenberg from his mother Catherine and passed it on to his son Sigismund Jr., who sold it in 1676 to the Duchess Eleonore Charlotte of W√ºrttemberg- Montb√©liard, the granddaughter of the protestant French general Gaspard III de Coligny.Genealogisches Taschenbuch des Adels, Houses: Dyhrn and K√∂ckritz, J. Perthes, various years.  The loss of the Duchy of Bernstadt  In 1572 Catherine's mother died and four years later her father Heinrich von Schindel unexpectedly died as well. According to his last will, published after his death, his successor should be his oldest male descendant, but as he had no sons from his marriage his whole wealth was inherited by his oldest daughter Catherine, who was at the time a minor (17 years old). Catherine's cousin, Jonas von Schindel, who was interested in inheriting the Duchy, filed a lawsuit against Catherine for not respecting her father's last will. His attempts to become the owner of Bernstadt caused the von Schindel family to split in two parts. After 20 years of lawsuits he was granted the right to take over the Duchy as he was then the oldest male member of the von Schindel family, who could also provide with a successor -he had a son named Leonhard von Schindel and a daughter Ursula, who married the Baron Nicholas II. von Burghau√ü. It was in 1596 when Catherine von Schindel lost her residence, the Bernstadt Palace, and the Duchy, over which she had an almost absolute power for two decades. The two parts of the family never reconciled. Catherine von Schindel moved with her 3rd husband to her estate in Festenberg, where she lived till her death in 1601. She is buried inside of the church in Festenberg as well as are all of her three husbands. In April 1603, two years after her death, her 3rd husband Caspar von K√∂ckritz und Friedland went to hunt deers in Gosch√ºtz. One of his friends, Hans von Borschnitz, accidentally shot him with a gun and K√∂ckritz died. In the same year Jonas von Schindel died as well, leaving the Duchy of Bernstadt to his son Leonhard, who sold it already in 1604 back to the Podiebrad family.J.

History The barracks were built in the Fortress Gothic Revival style and named after Sir John Gaspard Le Marchant in 1878. Their creation took place as part of the Cardwell Reforms which encouraged the localisation of British military forces. The barracks became the depot for the 62nd (Wiltshire) Regiment of Foot and the 99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot. Following the Childers Reforms, the 62nd and 99th Regiments amalgamated to form the Wiltshire Regiment (Duke of Edinburgh's) with its depot in the barracks in 1881. During the First World War 5,000 soldiers were processed there and over 3,000 reservists were called up there. Between the Wars the barracks were the local infantry training centre and during the Second World War the barracks became a Prisoner of war camp. The barracks remained the home of the Wiltshire Regiment until 1959 after which time they were used as a secondary location by the Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment until about 1967. Part of the site was still used as a Territorial Army Centre for the 1st Battalion the Wessex Regiment (Rifle Volunteers) after the main barracks closed. The keep was sold by the Ministry of Defence in the 1980s and was subsequently used as a warehouse. It was sold again in 2012 and converted for residential use in 2013. The keep and gatehouse are Grade II listed.

First launched in China in 2013 as a \\"milk candy\\", it was introduced into the United States as a caramel candy the next year. The candy was Hershey's first entirely new product in 30 years.  History  The cr√®mes were inspired by similar caramels produced by the first candy company founded by Milton S. Hershey--the Lancaster Caramel Company. Built upon the reputation of Lancaster Caramel, Hershey eventually was able to found The Hershey Company. The new company initially supplied the chocolate needed to coat the caramels produced at Lancaster before the more famous Hershey bar was developed. Lancaster Soft Cr√®mes were the first brand to be introduced in 30 years by Hershey that was neither an expansion of an existing brand, nor an acquisition from another company. It was also the first to be launched outside of the United States, with the roll out first in Wuhan, Hangzhou and Chengdu in May 2013; the U.S. launch occurred in February 2014. Rather than using a test market, the two versions of the caramels were developed separately to cater to the different tastes of consumers in China and the U.S. The Lancaster product in China is a more traditional milk-based candy popular in Asia, while the U.S. product is caramel-based with a more \\"sweet and salty\\" taste. Lancaster Soft Cr√®mes are produced in Canada for the U.S., and a local confectionery in Hunan is used for the Chinese market.

The album showcases the musical and compositional abilities of Sonny Rollins, who was Davis' favoured saxophonist at this point in his career. Three of the four tunes were Sonny Rollins originals, and would go on to become regular parts of both Davis' and Rollins' live sets. In his autobiography, Davis says that Rollins was writing the music on scraps of paper in the studio during the recording session. Davis also states the cover of Gershwin's \\"But Not for Me\\" was an early example of himself being influenced by the spacing and lyricism of the pianist Ahmad Jamal.\\"Miles: the Autobiography\\", Miles Davis with Quincy Troupe, 1989, p. 178.

The plans comprise 1,200 apartments, retail and commercial space, 120,000 square metre in total, as well as several new urban spaces. A 330 m long and five to 10 storeys tall block will shield the waterfront area from busy Vasbygade. The block will surround five individual courtyards and contain 613 rental apartments.

It was the league's first season with six teams based only in Europe. Returning from a 2-year hiatus after the 1992 WLAF season, the league had dropped its seven North American teams, with the three existing teams (the Frankfurt Galaxy, London Monarchs and Barcelona Dragons) joined by three new franchises (the Rhein Fire, Scottish Claymores and Amsterdam Admirals). The World Bowl '95 title game was won by Frankfurt, 26‚Äì22 over Amsterdam. Season The top draft choice was Shaumbe Wright-Fair, who was picked by the Rhein Fire. The Scottish Claymores, after a 5‚Äì0 record in the preseason, surprisingly fired their head coach, Larry Kuharich, five days before their WLAF kickoff because \\"his coaching philosophy did not mesh with the make-up of the team\\". Frankfurt's road to the World Bowl included a 27‚Äì7 win at London on May 15. The Claymores' hopes of making the World Bowl were dashed with a week 6 defeat by Rhein 33‚Äì27 in overtime. The Claymores ended their inaugural season with a 2‚Äì8 record. World Bowl '95 Frankfurt beat Amsterdam 26‚Äì22 at Amsterdam Olympic Stadium. The game was played on Saturday, June 17, 1995. The match-up was between the 6‚Äì4 Frankfurt Galaxy and the 9‚Äì1 Amsterdam Admirals. 23,847 fans witnessed the Galaxy pull off an upset en route to a 26‚Äì22 victory and their first ever World Bowl title. Quarterback Paul Justin earned MVP honors by completing 18 of 36 attempts for 308 yards with three touchdowns and one interception.

He participated in several campaigns during the Napoleonic Wars as a cavalry lieutenant and lost his right arm at the Battle of Leipzig. While recuperating with relatives, he took up drawing as a hobby. In the Summer of 1814, he made the acquaintance of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who urged him to become a painter. They maintained a steady correspondence until Goethe's death in 1832. After serving in several adjutant positions, he resigned from the Army in 1819 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. As part of his convalescence, he moved to Willingshausen and was married there in 1820. Four years later, he met Ludwig Emil Grimm and the idea for an Artists' Colony was born. They focused on genre scenes and landscapes from the Schwalm. =Studies= Having been self-taught up to this point, he began taking private lessons from his friend Grimm. When the climate in Willingshausen aggravated his wound, he moved to Geneva and studied with the Swiss painter Matthias Gabriel Lory (1784-1846), then attended the Kassel Art Academy where he studied under and Johann Martin von Rohden. In 1835, he moved to D√ºsseldorf and studied with Theodor Hildebrandt at the Art Academy there. Two years later, he was appointed to a position as Court Painter for the Imperial Russian family, with the right to live abroad, a concession obtained by his friend Vasily Zhukovsky, who would later become his son-in-law. In 1841, he invited his friend Jakob F√ºrchtegott Dielmann to oversee the Artists' Colony and spent his time moving between Russia, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. After three years of travelling, he settled in Frankfurt where he established a studio at the Villa Metzler. In the early 1860s, he was forced to give up painting due to failing eyesight, rheumatism and unspecified \\"nervous complaints\\", probably brought about by the successive deaths of several friends and family members; including his wife, daughter Elisabeth and youngest son, Christoph.

Lower New England and the NY-NJ- PA area hold the majority of the region's Puerto Rican population. Combined, the New England states are home to over 600,000 Puerto Ricans, with the vast majority in the Lower portion of New England, having a very high concentration of Puerto Ricans.  New York  New York City has the largest population of Puerto Ricans in the country outside Puerto Rico itself, followed by Philadelphia. New York City has more Puerto Ricans than 48 states, only Florida has more (excluding New York the state NYC is in). In New York, Puerto Rican populations are significant in New York City, Long Island, and the Hudson Valley, especially Yonkers and other areas throughout Westchester County, Binghamton, Newburgh, Middletown, Haverstraw, and the Albany- Schenectady-Troy area as well. There are also large Puerto Rican populations in the cities of Utica, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, and Dunkirk in Western New York.  Pennsylvania  In Pennsylvania, one-third of Puerto Ricans reside in Philadelphia. However, Puerto Ricans are more concentrated in South Central Pennsylvania and the Lehigh Valley. This area, extending from Harrisburg to the New Jersey border is home to almost half of Puerto Ricans statewide. Cities along this stretch include York, Harrisburg, Lancaster, Lebanon, Reading, Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton. There is also a smaller Puerto Rican presence in towns such as Chester, Coatesville, Pottstown, and Norristown, as well as other areas in the Philadelphia Metro Area, especially Montgomery County and Delaware County. Though, the bulk of Pennsylvania's Puerto Rican population is in the southeastern section of the state, Hazleton, the Scranton-Wilkes Barre area, and the Poconos in northeastern Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh area, New Castle, and Erie in western Pennsylvania also have sizeable Puerto Rican populations present.  New Jersey  In New Jersey, a slight majority of Puerto Ricans are located in North Jersey. Cities with significant populations include Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, Passaic, Perth Amboy, and Elizabeth. The remaining portion is in South Jersey, including cities like Trenton, Camden, Pennsauken, Vineland, Millville, Pleasantville, and Atlantic City.  Delaware  In Delaware, the majority of the Puerto Rican population lives in New Castle County, especially Wilmington and Elsmere among other cities, where there is a large Puerto Rican population, the area is often considered a part of the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Kent County also has a significant Puerto Rican population, especially in Dover.  Maryland  In Maryland, the Puerto Rican population is much smaller compared to Lower New England and the NY-NJ-PA area. There is a small Puerto Rican population in Baltimore, as well as in many smaller cities throughout Central Maryland. About 85 percent of Maryland's Puerto Rican population lives in Central Maryland, split evenly between the Baltimore area and the Maryland portion of the DC area. Though, growing, Baltimore and Washington, DC have the smallest Puerto Rican populations of all the major cities in the Northeast megalopolis (an area including the metro areas of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington), and is often overshadowed by a larger Central American presence. Though, Baltimore's Puerto Rican population is larger and more concentrated than that of Washington's. More Puerto Ricans in the Washington metro area live scattered among the surrounding suburbs, than the actual city itself.  Connecticut  Connecticut has the highest concentration of Puerto Ricans of any state by percentage and has large Puerto Rican populations throughout the state, with the largest in Hartford, East Hartford, Bridgeport, New Haven, Meriden, Waterbury, New Britain, New London, Windham, Norwich, and Willimantic. Though, half of the Puerto Rican population in the New England area is situated along the Interstate-91 corridor, extending from New Haven in Connecticut to Holyoke in Massachusetts.  Massachusetts  In Massachusetts, the largest Puerto Rican populations are in Holyoke, Springfield, Fitchburg, Lowell, Worcester, Lawrence, Lynn, Boston, Southbridge, Haverhill, Chicopee, Chelsea, Taunton, and New Bedford. The highest percentage of Puerto Ricans in the US proper can be found in Holyoke. Puerto Ricans continue to dominate demographically in the central and western parts of the state.

Rhode Island  In Rhode Island, there is a large Puerto Rican population, vast majority of which live in Providence County, especially the cities of Providence, Cranston, Pawtucket, Central Falls, and Woonsocket. =The South= The South is home to 1.3 million Puerto Ricans, comprising 29% of the Puerto Rican population nationwide.  Florida  Florida is home to two-thirds of the Puerto Rican population in the South. Florida is currently home to the fastest-growing Puerto Rican population of any state. Cubans and Puerto Ricans are Florida's largest Hispanic groups, though unlike the Cuban community which is nearly entirely located in the South Florida and Tampa Bay areas, the Puerto Rican population is far more spread-out and is present in large numbers in Central Florida, South Florida, and North Florida, having large populations in the metro areas of Orlando, Tampa, Miami, and Jacksonville, among other cities. South Florida has a large Puerto Rican population centered around the Miami metro area, yet are largely overlooked by Cuban dominance and the overall diversity of the Miami area, with large numbers in Miami, Hollywood, West Palm Beach, Homestead, North Miami, Boynton Beach, Coconut Creek, and Port St. Lucie. The west coast of Florida has significant Puerto Rican populations present in scattered areas, in cities such as, Tampa, St. Petersburg, Pinellas Park, Lakeland, Cape Coral, Lehigh Acres, and Fort Myers. Central Florida has the largest Puerto Rican population of any region in the state and the fastest-growing Puerto Rican population in the country. The Orlando metropolitan area is the center of the Puerto Rican population in Central Florida and there is large populations of Puerto Ricans throughout the region, with the largest populations in Orlando, Kissimmee, Poinciana, Buenaventura Lakes, Azalea Park, Meadow Woods, Pine Hills, Deltona, St. Cloud, Sanford, Apopka, Alafaya, Oak Ridge, Oviedo, Daytona Beach, and Palm Bay.

The I-4 corridor, extending from Daytona Beach to Tampa, is home to 500,000 Puerto Ricans. The I-4 corridor is politically considered the swing section of the state, yet Puerto Rican growth has created a Democratic registration advantage. Puerto Rican growth in Central Florida has also had a direct impact on the uninterrupted influence Cubans once had. In North Florida, there are significant Puerto Rican populations in Jacksonville, Orange Park, Ocala, Tallahassee, and Gainesville. Though, the most notable growth in North Florida has been in Clay County and the Jacksonville area. Though, the Puerto Rican population may not be as large as other parts of Florida, especially Central Florida, Puerto Ricans often make up the majority of Hispanics in many North Florida cities, due to lower percentages of Hispanics in North Florida.  Virginia  In Virginia, over half of the Puerto Rican population is in the many independent cities of the Hampton Roads area, including Newport News, Hampton, Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Williamsburg. In fact, outside Florida, the region stretching from the Hampton Roads metropolitan area of Southeastern Virginia up to the Tri-cities portion of the Richmond metro area has the highest percentage of Puerto Ricans of any metropolitan area or urban region in the Southern United States. A large chunk of the remainder is mainly in the Richmond-Tri Cities area (especially south of the James River) and the DC suburbs of Northern Virginia.  North Carolina  In North Carolina, there are significant and growing Puerto Rican populations in Fayetteville, and the metro areas of Raleigh/Durham and Charlotte.

There are many other Ohio cities with significant Puerto Rican populations, particularly in Northeast Ohio, where the vast majority of the state's Puerto Rican population lives, including places like Lorain, Elyria, Youngstown, Campbell, Akron, Ashtabula, and Newburgh Heights. Columbus in Central Ohio also has a significant and growing Puerto Rican population. Northeast Ohio has the highest concentration of Puerto Ricans in the Midwest and any state outside the eastcoast, with Lorian having the highest Puerto Rican percentage outside the eastcoast. This is because Northeast Ohio is a part of a long stretch of cities, stretching from Syracuse in Western New York to Lorain, and also includes the Erie PA area, mainly centered on Rochester, Buffalo, and Cleveland, all of which have large Puerto Rican populations, which make up the majority of the Hispanic/Latino community in the area similar to the Northeastern United States. In recent years, Ohio has replaced Illinois as the most popular Midwest destination for Puerto Ricans, with many more choosing the Cleveland and Columbus areas of Ohio over the Chicago area.  Wisconsin  In Wisconsin, 53% of the Puerto Rican population resides in the city of Milwaukee, the remaining portion is mostly in southeastern Wisconsin, in areas near Milwaukee and Chicago.
