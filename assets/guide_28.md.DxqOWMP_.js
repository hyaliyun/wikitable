On July 26, 2011, Gable signed as an undrafted free agent with the New Orleans Saints. He was waived on August 5, 2011. =Denver Broncos= Gable during his brief tenure with the Denver Broncos On August 6, 2011, Gable signed with the Denver Broncos, but was waived on August 29. =Nebraska Danger= Gable was signed by the Nebraska Danger of the Indoor Football League on October 24, 2012, but was released on February 28, 2013. =CFL career= Hamilton Tiger-Cats Gable was signed by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League on April 2, 2013. CJ Gable had a strong first season in the CFL. He was a threat both rushing the ball and receiving the ball out of the backfield. Gable totaled 782 rushing yards on 130 carries, with 7 touchdowns as well as 598 receiving yards on 54 catches with 5 touchdowns. He was the 2013 winner of the Frank M. Gibson Trophy as runner up for the CFL's Most Outstanding Rookie Award. Gable's second season in the CFL was marred by injury. He only played in the first 6 games of the season before injuring his foot and shoulder. He wound up with just 138 rushing yards on 30 carries (4.6 average) for 2 touchdowns, with 18 catches for 224 yards and 2 more touchdowns. In late February 2015, Gable and the Tiger-Cats agreed to a contract extension which will keep Gable in Hamilton through the 2017 CFL season. His third season with the Ti-Cats was similar to his second season in that he missed significant playing time due to injury. The 2016 season was a return to form for Gable, as he played in 15 games for the Ti-Cats, rushing the ball 126 times for 693 yards (5.5 average) and 3 touchdowns. He also caught 39 passes for 404 yards and one receiving touchdown. Gable earned divisional All-Star honours for the second time in his career as a result of his strong play in 2016. Gable returned in 2017 as the team's primary running back, playing in nine of the club's first 13 games. Gable carried the ball 74 times for 466 yards with 5 touchdowns for the Ti-Cats in 2017.  Edmonton Eskimos  On October 2, 2017 the Edmonton Eskimos acquired C.J. Gable via trade, in exchange for two unnamed players from their negotiation list. In four regular season games with the Eskimos Gable carried the ball 72 times for 367 yards (5.1 avg) with two touchdowns (he also caught nine passes for 99 yards and one touchdown). In two playoff games Gable had 28 rushing attempts for 161 yards with three touchdowns. Following the season he was re-signed by the Eskimos to a two-year deal. Although Edmonton missed the playoffs with a 9-9 record, Gable's 2018 proved to be a career year, rushing for his first 1,000 season. In 16 games, Gable had 196 rushes for 1,063 yards with 7 touchdowns, in addition to 34 catches for 212 yards and another score. Gable had another strong season in 2019, carrying the ball a career high 205 times eclipsing 1000 rushing yards for the second consecutive season. Following the season Gable was not re-signed by the Eskimos and became a free agent on February 11, 2020.

City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 146 (1964), is a United States Supreme Court decision that reversed the breach of peace and criminal trespass convictions of five African Americans who were refused service at a lunch counter of a department store.. The Court held that there was insufficient evidence to support the breach of peace convictions, and reversed the criminal trespass convictions for the reasons stated in another case that was decided that same day, Bouie v. City of Columbia, which held that the retroactive application of an expanded construction of a criminal statute was barred by due process of ex post facto laws..  Background  Five African American college students went to a department store in Columbia, South Carolina, and sat down at its lunch counter and waited for service. The department store allowed persons of all races to use all facilities except for the lunch counter, which served whites only. The store manager had arranged for police to be present for any sit-in demonstrators, and then, consistent with the restaurant's policy of refusing service to blacks, the restaurant manager requested the persons to leave. When they refused, they were arrested for breach of the peace and criminal trespass. At trial the defendants their arrest, prosecution, and conviction by the state for requesting service at a restaurant that refused service to African Americans would violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court convicted the students, and the Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed in an unreported decision.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court first considered the breach of peace convictions and noted that the students had simply remained sitting at the lunch counter when asked by the manager to leave. The State had argued that the students simply remaining could cause others to breach the peace when they saw the students. The Court rejected that argument, and did not find that the evidence supported a breach of peace conviction, and reversed. Regarding the trespass convictions, the majority opinion by Justice Black did not reach the broad question posed by the defendants as to \\"whether the Fourteenth Amendment of its own force forbids a State to arrest and prosecute those who, having been asked to leave a restaurant because of their color, refuse to do so.\\"378 U.S. at 155. Instead, the Court considered its ruling in Bouie v. City of Columbia, which had been announced the same day, which found that the South Carolina Supreme Court had expanded the scope of acts that were covered under its criminal trespass statute. The Supreme Court in that case held that retroactive application of this expanded scope violated due process as an ex post facto law, and the Barr decision references that decision for its holding. The concurring opinion of Justice Douglas simply stated that he would reverse based upon his opinions in Bell v. Maryland,. another case involving a sit-in demonstration by African American students that was announced the same day as the Barr decision. Justice Goldberg, joined by Chief Justice Warren, stated that they would reverse for the reasons stated in the majority opinion in Bell. Justices Black, Harlan, and White stated that they dissented for the same reasons stated in their Bouie dissent, that the actions in the restaurant did not constitute state action.  Subsequent developments  Barr v. City of Columbia was one of five cases involving segregation protests decided on June 22, 1964. The other four cases were Griffin v. Maryland,. Robinson v. Florida,. Bouie v. City of Columbia, and Bell v. Maryland. In none of these cases did the Supreme Court reach the merits of any argument addressing whether private actions of segregation which are enforced by state courts constituted a state action which violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. These decisions were announced two days after the Senate ended a filibuster and passed the bill which would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed segregation in public accommodations. It has been suggested that the Supreme Court refrained from reaching the merits in these cases in consideration of the Act, had it done so it would have eliminated the basis for passage of the Act.

It became firmly established in the Middle Ages when first Romanesque, then Gothic churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country. It was during this period that, in a country with little access to stone, brick became the construction material of choice, not just for churches but also for fortifications and castles. Under the influence of Frederick II and Christian IV, both of whom had been inspired by the castles of France, Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark, initially to improve the country's fortifications, but increasingly to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the Renaissance style. In parallel, the half-timbered style became popular for ordinary dwellings in towns and villages across the country. Late in his reign, Christian IV also became an early proponent of Baroque which was to continue for a considerable time with many impressive buildings both in the capital and the provinces. Neoclassicism came initially from France but was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style. A productive period of Historicism ultimately merged into the 19th century National Romantic style. It was not, however, until the 1960s that Danish architects entered the world scene with their highly successful Functionalism. This, in turn, has evolved into more recent world-class masterpieces such as the Sydney Opera House and the Great Belt Bridge paving the way for a number of Danish designers to be rewarded for excellence both at home and abroad. Middle Ages Viking Age = Reconstructed Viking house, Fyrkat Archaeological excavations in various parts of Denmark have revealed much about the way the Vikings lived. One of the most notable sites is Hedeby. Located some south of the Danish border near the German town of Schleswig, it probably dates back to the end of the 8th century. The houses are deemed to be among the most sophisticated dwellings of their time. Oak frames were used for the walls, and the roofs were probably thatched.. Viking ring houses, such as those at Trelleborg, near Slagelse on the Danish island of Zealand, have a rather different, ship-like shape, the long walls bulging outwards. Each house consisted of a large central hall, and two smaller rooms, one at each end. Those at Fyrkat (c. 980) in the north of Jutland were long, wide at the ends and in the middle, the long walls curving slightly outwards. The walls consisted of double rows of posts with planks wedged horizontally between them. A series of outer posts slanted towards the wall were possibly used to support the building like buttresses.. =Romanesque style= St. Bendt's Church in Ringsted, 1170 Denmark's first churches from the 9th century were built of timber and have not survived. Hundreds of stone churches in the Romanesque style were built in the 12th and 13th centuries. They had a flat- ceilinged nave and chancel with small rounded windows and round arches. Granite boulders and limestone were initially the preferred building materials, but after brick production reached Denmark in the middle of the 12th century, brick quickly became the material of choice.. Among the finest examples of brick Romanesque buildings are St. Bendt's Church in Ringsted (c. 1170). and the unique Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg (c. 1200) with its five tall towers.. The church at √òsterlars on the island of Bornholm was built around 1150. Like three other churches on the island, it is a round church. The three-storeyed building is supported by a circular outer wall and an exceptionally wide, hollow central column.. Construction of Lund Cathedral in Scania started in about 1103 when the region was part of the Kingdom of Denmark. It was the first of great Danish Romanesque cathedrals in the shape of a three-aisled basilica with transepts. It seems to have been related to earlier German buildings, though there are also traces of Anglo-Norman and Lombard influences.. Ribe, which followed with its great cathedral (1150‚Äì1250), had close trade contacts with the Rhine region of Germany. Both the materials, sandstone and tufa, and the models were taken from there. =Gothic style= St. Peter's Church, N√¶stved (1375) Towards the end of the 13th century and until about 1500, the Gothic style became the norm with the result that most of the older Romanesque churches were rebuilt or adapted to the Gothic style. The flat ceilings were replaced by high cross vaults, windows were enlarged with pointed arches, chapels and towers were added and the interiors were decorated with murals.. Red brick was the material of choice as can be seen in St. Canute's Cathedral, Odense (1300‚Äì1499), and St. Peter's Church, N√¶stved. St. Canute's presents all the features of Gothic architecture: pointed arch, buttresses, ribbed vaulting, increased light and the spatial combination of nave and chancel. Although most Gothic architecture in Denmark is to be found in churches and monasteries, there are examples in the secular field too. Glimmingehus (1499‚Äì1506), a rectangular castle in Scania, clearly presents Gothic features. It was commissioned by the Danish nobleman Jens Holgersen Ulfstand who called on the services of Adam van D√ºren, a North German master who also worked on Lund Cathedral. The building contains many defensive features of the times, including parapets, false doors, dead- end corridors, murder-holes for pouring boiling pitch over the attackers, moats, drawbridges and various other death traps to protect the nobles against peasant uprisings.. Anne Hvides G√•rd, Svendborg (1560) =Half-timbered buildings= During the late Middle Ages, a slow transition began from the traditional wooden houses in towns and villages towards half-timbered properties. One of the oldest in Denmark is Anne Hvides G√•rd, a two-storeyed townhouse in Svendborg on the island of Funen, which was constructed in 1560.. The building now forms part of the Svendborg Museum. Ystad in the southern Swedish region of Scania which was formerly part of Denmark still has some 300 half-timbered houses, several of them of historic importance.. The oldest surviving half-timbered house in Denmark, built in 1527, is located in K√∏ge on the east coast of Sealand. The Old Town in Aarhus, Jutland, is an open-air village museum consisting of 75 historical buildings collected from all parts of the country. They include a variety of half-timbered houses, some dating back to the middle of the 16th century.

Renaissance architecture thrived during the reigns of Frederick II and especially Christian IV. Inspired by the French castles of the times, Flemish architects designed masterpieces such as Kronborg Castle in Helsing√∏r and Frederiksborg Palace in Hiller√∏d. In Copenhagen, Rosenborg Castle (1606‚Äì24) and B√∏rsen or the former stock exchange (1640) are perhaps the city's most remarkable Renaissance buildings. During the reign of Frederick II, Kronborg Castle was designed by two Flemish architects, Hans Hendrik van Paesschen who started the work in 1574 and Anthonis van Obbergen who finished it in 1585. Modelled on a three-winged French castle, it was finally completed as a full four-winged building. The castle burnt down in 1629 but, under orders from Christian IV, was quickly rebuilt under the leadership of Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger, son of the famous Flemish artist. It is widely recognized as one of Europe's most outstanding Renaissance castles and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.. Frederiksborg Palace (1602‚Äì20) in Hiller√∏d is the largest Renaissance palace in Scandinavia. Christian IV had most of Frederick II's original building pulled down in order to have van Steenwinckel complete a three-winged French-styled castle with a low terrace wing around a courtyard. The architectural expression and the decorative finish clearly reflect Dutch Renaissance preferences as evidenced by the ornamental portals and windows and especially in sweeping Italianate gables. Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen, also built by Christian IV, is another example of the Dutch Renaissance style. In 1606, the king first had a two-storey summerhouse built on a site he used as a park for relaxation. He then decided to start work on a much more ambitious building, the castle, which developed in stages until a Dutch Renaissance masterpiece was completed in 1624. Predating the castle, the Renaissance-style park, is Denmark's oldest royal garden.. Sponsored by Christian IV, B√∏rsen, one of the first commodity exchanges in Europe, was built from 1618 to 1624. It was designed to emphasize Copenhagen's position as a commercial metropolis. Although inspired by the Dutch Renaissance style, the distinctive towers and garrets on the roof reflect the taste of Christian IV. The characteristic spire of the building with four intertwined dragon tails topped by three crowns, symbolises the then Kingdom of Denmark, which included Norway and Sweden.. In 1614, Christian IV began work on the construction of the then Danish Kristianstad in Scania, now in the south of Sweden, completing many of its buildings in the Renaissance style. Particularly impressive is the Church of the Trinity (1618‚Äì28) designed by Flemish-Danish architect Lorenz van Steenwinckel. It is said to be Scandinavia's finest example of a Renaissance church.

Christian IV also initiated a number of projects in Norway that were largely based on Renaissance architecture. He established mining operations in Kongsberg and R√∏ros, now a World Heritage Site. After a devastating fire in 1624, the town of Oslo was moved to a new location and rebuilt as a fortified city with an orthogonal layout surrounded by ramparts, and renamed Christiania. King Christian also founded the trading city of Kristiansand, once again naming it after himself. While stone buildings became more and more common as town houses, farms continued to be half-timbered, sometimes in conjunction with a single stone house. Ordinary people continued to live in half-timbered houses. Holb√¶k in northwestern Sealand began to develop towards the end of the Middle Ages. Prosperity peaked in the 17th century as corn grown locally was traded with Germany and the Netherlands. The half-timbered houses which now form the museum date back to that period, providing an insight into how the town functioned at the time.. Danish country vicarages from this period tended to be built in the same style as farmhouses, though usually rather larger. A fine example is K√∏lstrup Vicarage near Kerteminde in north-eastern Funen. The house itself is a thatched half-timbered building with a large rectangular courtyard flanked by outhouses.. File:Helsingoer Kronborg Castle.jpg File:Heliga Trefaldighetskyrkan exteri√∂r cropped.jpg File:B√∏rsen K√∏benhavn.jpg File:Frederiksborg Slot 13-09-07 03.jpg Baroque As during the Renaissance period, it was again principally Dutch influence which predominated in Baroque architecture, although many of the features originated in Italy and France. Symmetry and regularity were primary concerns, often enhanced by a projecting central section on the main fa√ßade. Copenhagen's Round Tower was also one of Christian IV's projects after he provided funding for an observatory as proposed by the astronomer Tycho Brahe. Under the initial leadership of Hans van Steenwinckel who surprisingly adapted the design to Dutch Baroque, the Tower was completed in 1642 with a height of almost 40 m. The bricks, specially ordered from the Netherlands, were of a hard-burned, slender type, known as muffer or mopper. A 210-meter-long spiral ramp leads to the top, providing panoramic views over Copenhagen. The Round Tower is the oldest functioning observatory in Europe. Until 1861 it was used by the University of Copenhagen, but today, anyone can observe the night sky through the tower's astronomical telescope during the winter.. Nys√∏ Manor (1673) near Pr√¶st√∏, Sealand, was built for the local functionary Jens Lauridsen. It was the first Baroque country house in Denmark, replacing the earlier Renaissance style. The inspiration came from Holland and the architect was probably Ewert Janssen.. One of the foremost designers of the times was the Danish architect Lambert van Haven whose masterpiece was the Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen (1682‚Äì96) which relies on the Greek cross for its basic layout. The fa√ßade is segmented by Tuscan pilasters extending up to the full height of the building. Other features such as the distinctive corkscrew spire were however not undertaken until the reign of Frederick V. It was Lauritz de Thurah who finally completed the building in 1752.. Charlottenborg (1672‚Äì83), on Kongens Nytorv in the centre of Copenhagen, is said to be the most important pure Baroque building remaining in Denmark. Van Haven may have been involved in its design although Ewert Janssen is usually credited with the work. Several other mansion houses in Denmark have been based on its design., 257 pp. It was Henrik Ruse, a Dutch building engineer, who was charged by Frederick III to develop the area around Kongens Nytorv, especially in connection with the Nyhavn Canal which was designed to become Copenhagen's new harbour. It was not, however, until Christian V became king in 1670 that Niels Rosenkrantz completed the work. Over the next few years, numerous town houses were built along the northern or sunny side of the canal. The oldest, Number 9, was completed in 1681, probably by Christen Christensen, the harbour master.. Clausholm Castle (1693‚Äì94) near Randers was designed by the Danish architect Ernst Brandenburger with assistance of the Swede Nicodemus Tessin who was invited to decorate the facade.. The more sophisticated first-floor apartments with their higher ceilings were designed for use by royalty. The first Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, designed by Elias David H√§usser and completed in the 1740s, was certainly one of the most impressive Baroque buildings of its day. Although the palace itself was destroyed by fire in 1794, the extensive showgrounds and riding arena completed by Niels Eigtved have survived undamaged and can be visited today.. Fredensborg Palace (1731), the royal residence on the shore of Sealand's Lake Esrum, with its exquisite Chancellery House, is the work of Johan Cornelius Krieger who was the court gardener at Rosenborg Castle.. The park at Fredensborg is one of Denmark's largest and best preserved Baroque gardens. After the turn of the 18th century, architecture developed into the late Baroque style. Among the major proponents were Johan Conrad Ernst who built the Chancery Building. or Kancellibygningen (1721) on Slotsholmen and Lauritz de Thurah who designed the Eremitage Palace (1734) in Dyrehaven, just north of Copenhagen. Even more ambitious was de Thurah's work at Ledreborg near Roskilde, where he succeeded in working the components into a well-balanced and cohesive Baroque palace.. =Rococo= Following on closely from the Baroque period, Rococo came into fashion in the 1740s under the leadership of Nicolai Eigtved. Originally a gardener, Eigtved spent many years abroad where he became increasingly interested in architecture, especially the French Rococo style. On his return to Denmark, he built Prinsens Pal√¶ (1743‚Äì44) in Copenhagen as a residence for Crown Prince Frederick (later Frederick V). It is now the National Museum. Soon afterwards, he was given prestige assignments including the overall architectural design for the Frederiksstaden district of Copenhagen 1749, planned around the strictly octagonal square containing the four Amalienborg Palaces and considered to be one of Europe's most important Rococo complexes. Adam Gottlob Moltke who, as Frederick V's overhofmarskal or lord chamberlain, was in charge of the project gave Eigtved a free hand, not only to design the principal buildings but also to provide the area with straight broad streets and the mansions which lined them.. Frederick V had wanted to emulate the grand building achievements of the French monarchs. Not surprisingly, therefore, the palace square is inspired by the Place de la Concorde in Paris from the same period. Although Eigtved died before the work was completed, other architects including Lauritz de Thurah faithfully continued to execute his plans. Perhaps the finest outcomes are the Amalienborg Palace complex, Frederik's Church in its immediate vicinity and Frederiks Hospital. Philip de Lange, although influenced by Eigtved, developed his own rather strict style during this period. His ornamental facade can be seen on the Kunstforeningen building (1750) on Gammel Strand in Copenhagen. The top storey with a gable was added later.. De Lange also designed the small but well proportioned Damsholte Church on M√∏n, the only Rococo village church in Denmark.. File:Vor Frelsers Kirke Copenhagen 2.jpg File:Clausholm.jpg File:Nyhavn 9-15 K√∏benhavn.jpg File:Copenhagen amalienborg seen from opera house.jpg Neoclassical Neoclassicism which relied on inspiration from ancient Greece and Rome, was brought to Denmark by the French architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin. His countryman, the sculptor Jacques Saly, who was already well established in Denmark, persuaded Frederick V that Jardin could complete Frederik's Church after Eigtved's death. Although Jardin did not succeed in this, he was successful in designing several prestige Neoclassical buildings such as Bernstorff Palace (1759‚Äì65) in Gentofte and Marienlyst Palace near Helsing√∏r. One of Jardin's pupils, Caspar Frederik Harsdorff, turned out to be Denmark's most prominent 18th-century architect and is known as the Father of Danish Classicism. He undertook a considerable amount of redesign work, both for interiors and exteriors, including work on the Royal Theatre (1774) where he introduced a classical temple style with a wide entrance and large hall. He also carried out work on the Amalienborg complex including the colonnade, with its eight Ionic wooden columns, linking the crown prince's residence (Schacks Pal√¶) with the king's (Moltkes Pal√¶)... Another remarkable example of neoclassicism is Liselund on the island of M√∏n in south-eastern Denmark. This rather small country home built in the French Neoclassical style in the 1790s is exceptional in that it has a thatched roof. Like the surrounding Romantic park, the house was the work of Andreas Kirkerup, one of the foremost landscape architects of the times. It was designed as a summer retreat for Antoine de la Calmette, the island's governor, and his wife, Lise.. The building is T-shaped with the main rooms on the ground floor, the first floor consisting of nine bedrooms. The interior was probably decorated by the leading decorator of the day, Joseph Christian Lillie. 19th centuryClassicism= Copenhagen Court House (1815), designed by Christian Frederik Hansen After Hardorff's death, the main proponent of Classicism was Christian Frederik Hansen who developed a more severe style with clean, simple forms and large, unbroken surfaces. From 1800, he was in charge of all major building projects in Copenhagen where he designed the Copenhagen City Hall & Courthouse (1805‚Äì15) on Nytorv. He was also responsible for rebuilding Church of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke) and designing the surrounding square (1811‚Äì29). In 1800, Hansen was also charged with rebuilding Christiansborg Palace which had burnt down in 1794. Unfortunately, it burnt down once again in 1884. All that remains is the magnificent chapel which, with its Ionic columns, conveys a sense of antiquity.. Michael Gottlieb Bindesb√∏ll is remembered above all for designing Thorvaldsens Museum. In 1822, as a young man, he had experienced Karl Friedrich Schinkel's classicism in Germany and France and had met the German-born architect and archaeologist Franz Gau who introduced him to the colourful architecture of antiquity. His uncle, Jonas Collin, who was an active art and culture official under Frederick VI, awakened the King's interest in a museum for Bertel Thorvaldsen, the Danish-Icelandic sculptor, and asked Bindesb√∏ll to make some sketches for the building. As Bindensb√∏ll's designs stood out from those of other architects, he was given a commission to transform the Royal Carriage Depot and Theatre Scenery Painting Building into a museum. Emulating the construction of the Erechtheion and the Parthenon as freestanding buildings released from the traditional urban plan of closed streets, he completed the work in 1848.. He also incorporated aspects of ancient Egyptian architecture into his design, though \\"the plan as a whole... is neither Egyptian nor Greek, but Bindesb√∏ll's own.\\". =Historicism= With the arrival of Historicism in the second half of the century, special importance was attached to high standards of craftsmanship and proper use of materials. This can be seen in Copenhagen's University Library (1861) designed by Johan Daniel Herholdt and inspired by St Fermo's Church in Verona. Vilhelm Dahlerup was one of the most productive 19th-century architects. Perhaps more than anyone else, he contributed to the way Copenhagen appears today. His most important buildings include Copenhagen's Hotel D‚ÄôAngleterre (1875) and the Danish National Gallery (1891). With the support of the Carlsberg company, he designed the Ny Carlsberg Glyptoteque (1897) and a number of lavishly decorated buildings at the Carlsberg Brewery site, now under redevelopment as a new district in Copenhagen. Frederik's Church in Copenhagen (completed in 1894). Ferdinand Meldahl, also a proponent of Historicism, completed the reconstruction of Frederiksborg Palace after the fire in 1859 and designed the Parliament Building in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, at that time a Danish colony. His greatest achievement was, however, the completion of Frederik's Church in Copenhagen. The site had become a ruin after work was stopped on Jardin's original design in 1770. Meldahl's plans differed significantly from Jardin's in that the lateral towers were eliminated, the dome was lower and the columns were reduced from six to four before the main entrance. Nevertheless, the overall height almost matched Jardin's, thanks to the lantern and the taller spire. The building, commonly known as the Marble Church, was completed in 1894, more than 150 years after Eigtved had drawn up his original plans.. =National Romanticism= Martin Nyrop was one of the main proponents of the National Romantic style. The main aim was to use distinctive Nordic motifs from the distant past, as is clearly demonstrated in Copenhagen City Hall which was completed in 1905. The City Hall is certainly Copenhagen's most monumental and most original building from the last quarter of the 19th century with its impressive facade, the golden statue of Absalon just above the balcony and its tall, slim clock tower. It was inspired by the Siena City Hall.. Another participant in the National Romanticism movement was Hack Kampmann who designed the Aarhus Theatre in the Art Nouveau style at the very end of the century. =Urban development= The harbour town of Svendborg in the south east of Funen dates back to the 13th century. Real prosperity emerged in the 19th century when shipbuilding and trade became important drivers. The town subsequently underwent a period of renovation with new brick and stone buildings lining its narrow streets. The old town has now become an important tourist attraction.. The fine architectural style of Skagen on the northern tip of Jutland is quite distinctive. From the 19th century on, the houses were whitewashed and had red-tiled roofs. Yellow and red tones dominated, backed by white chimneys and roof decorations. These traditions are not only to be found in the town's old districts but are maintained in the newer residential areas. Several of the town's more imposing buildings from the beginning of the 20th century were designed by the Ulrik Plesner, others were designed by well-known architects such as Thorvald Bindesb√∏ll.. File:Thoraldsens Museum.jpg File:Herholdt lores.jpg File:Aarhus Teater (front).jpg File:Copenhagen City Hall.jpg 20th centuryNordic Classicism= Neoclassicism or increasingly Nordic Classicism continued to thrive at the beginning of the century until about 1930 as can be seen in Kay Fisker's Hornb√¶khus apartment buildings (1923) and Hack Kampmann's police headquarters (1924). Its development was no isolated phenomenon, drawing on existing classical traditions in the Nordic countries, and from new ideas being pursued in German-speaking cultures. It can thus be characterised as a combination of direct and indirect influences from vernacular architecture (Nordic, Italian and German) and Neoclassicism.. While the movement had its greatest level of success in Sweden, there were a number of other important Danish proponents including Ivar Bentsen, Kaare Klint, Arne Jacobsen, Carl Petersen and Steen Eiler Rasmussen. Bentsen, with the assistance of Thorkild Henningsen, designed Denmark's first terraced houses in the Bellah√∏j district of Copenhagen. Very appropriately Klint, working with Bentsen, adapted the design of Frederiks Hospital to serve as the Danish Museum of Art & Design. Carl Petersen's main achievement was the Faaborg Museum built for collections of art from Funen. Steen Rasmussen is remembered above all for his town planning activities and for his contributions to the Dansk Byplanlaboratorium (Danish town planning laboratory).. =Expressionism= Grundtvig's Church in Bispebjerg, Copenhagen, is named after the Danish philosopher and pastor Nikolai Grundtvig, remembered by most Danes for his resounding hymns, now an integral part of the national culture. As a result of its unusual appearance, it is Denmark's most famous expressionist church. Designed by Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint, it relied heavily on Scandinavian brick gothic traditions, especially Danish village churches with stepped gables. Jensen-Klint combined the modern geometric forms of Brick Expressionism with the classical vertical of Gothic architecture. Construction began in 1921 but was only completed by his son Kaare Klint in 1940 after Jensen-Klint's death. The most striking feature of the building is its west facade, reminiscent of a westwork or of the exterior of a church organ.. =Functionalism= Danish functionalism. Detail from √Örhus Kommunehospital (1935) by C.F. M√∏ller. Affordable materials, full focus on functionality and a harmonious and simplistic appearance with no decorative structures whatsoever. Functionalism, which began in the 1930s, relied on rational architecture making use of bricks, concrete, iron and glass, preferably to meet social needs. Its main proponents in Denmark were Frits Schlegel, Mogens Lassen, Vilhelm Lauritzen and, especially Arne Jacobsen with his Bellavista developments north of Copenhagen. Another of Jacobsen's masterpieces was the Aarhus City Hall which he designed together with Erik M√∏ller in 1937 and completed in 1948. The tower is 60 meters tall and the tower clock face has a diameter of 7 meters. The building is made of concrete plated with marble from Porsgrunn in Norway... A more traditional approach was taken by Kay Fisker who, together with C. F. M√∏ller, designed buildings for Aarhus University from 1931 onwards.. =Modernism= After World War II, Functionalism drew on trends in American Modernism with its irregular ground plans, flat roofs, open plan interiors and glass facades. Good examples are J√∏rn Utzon's own family house (1952) on the outskirts of Helleb√¶k near Helsing√∏r where good use is made of reasonably cheap materials for post-war housing;. and the Kingo Houses (1956‚Äì58) in Helsing√∏r which consist of 63 L-shaped houses based upon the design of traditional Danish farmhouses. Another project, noted for the synthesis it creates between architecture and landscape, was the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art (1958) in Humleb√¶k, designed by J√∏rgen Bo and Vilhelm Wohlert. J√∏rn Utzon: Sydney Opera House (1973) During this period, Arne Jacobsen became the country's leading Modernist with the design of the SAS Hotel in Copenhagen (1960). R√∏dovre Town Hall, completed in 1956, shows how well Jacobsen combined the use of different materials: sandstone, two types of glass, painted metalwork and stainless steel.. Following in Jacobsen's footsteps, Denmark had some outstanding successes in 20th-century architecture. Most notably, J√∏rn Utzon's iconic Sydney Opera House earned him the distinction of becoming only the second person to have his work recognized as a World Heritage Site while still alive. His Bagsv√¶rd Church (1968‚Äì76) in Copenhagen has been considered an outstanding example of critical regionalism, for the synthesis created between universal civilisation and regional culture.. Winning the international competition for the Grande Arche at La D√©fense in Puteaux, near Paris, with a design based on simple geometrical forms brought Johann Otto von Spreckelsen international fame. Prolific Henning Larsen designed the Foreign Ministry building in Riyadh, as well as a variety of prestige buildings throughout Scandinavia, including the Copenhagen Opera House.. From the success of the Str√∏get's transformation into a pedestrian zone in Copenhagen in the 1960s and his influential book Life Between Buildings, Jan Gehl earned an international reputation in urban design. He has advised on numerous city planning developments including those for Melbourne, London and New York. His work has often drawn on Copenhagen and its bicycle culture, to improve the quality of public space in city centres.

Notable examples include the relatively small apartment complex Det Bl√• Hj√∏rne (The Blue Corner) in Christianshavn, by Tegnestuen Vandkunsten or the larger and much more recent Bispebjerg Bakke, in Bispebjerg from 2006, designed in collaboration with artist Bj√∏rn N√∏rgaard.Bispebjerg Bakke Vandkunsten det bl√• hj√∏rne 2007.jpgDet Bl√• Hj√∏rne (1983), Christianshavn ‰∏πÈ∫¶Âì•Êú¨ÂìàÊ†π Vesterbrogade, Copenhagen, DK - panoramio.jpgThe Scala Building (1989) Tycho Brahe Planetarium (15294230914).jpgTycho Brahe Planetarium (1989, Knud Munk) Kongrescenteret Scandinavian Center in Aarhus.jpgScandinavian Center (1995), Aarhus Glass and steel (SCA) 01.jpgGlass and steel arcade (Scandinavian Center) File:Bispebjerg Bakke 20110819 0041F (8367433480).jpgBispebjerg Bakke (2006) Contemporary period Since the turn of the millennium, Danish architecture has flourished both at home and abroad. Two important areas of Greater Copenhagen have provided substantial opportunities for architectural developments on the domestic front while a number of firms have gained international recognition, winning important commissions abroad. For some, overseas assignments have become as important as those in Denmark itself. Recent years have also seen the emergence of several new architectural firms operating both in Denmark and internationally. =Recent urban developments= √òrestad near Copenhagen Airport √òrestad is a contemporary urban development to the south-east of the Copenhagen's city centre. Its origin is connected with the building of the √òresund Bridge linking Copenhagen to Malm√∂ in Sweden, completed in 2000. After initial planning stages in the 1990s, the first office building was realised in 2001. Today the constantly expanding area has more than 3,000 apartments and 192,100 m¬≤ of office space... Copenhagen itself has also been undergoing significant transformations in recent years with the encouragement of various projects along the waterfront. Based on initial planning work in the 1980s, the area has already seen the appearance of several prestige buildings including the Black Diamond national library extension (1999), the Opera House (2000) and the Royal Danish Playhouse (2004).. The Royal Danish Playhouse by Lundgaard & Tranberg =International presence= Henning Larsen Architects, well established in the Nordic countries, are now active outside Denmark, particularly in the Middle East. They have a number of projects in Saudi Arabia and Syria, including the Massar Discovery Centre in Damascus. Another interesting project is a new building for Der Spiegel on the waterfront in Hamburg. 3XN have designed the award- winning Muziekgebouw Concert Hall in Amsterdam and the new Museum of Liverpool. In 2007, they won a competition for the design of a new headquarters for Deutsche Bahn in Berlin ahead of firms such as Foster + Partners of the UK and Dominique Perrault of France. Schmidt Hammer Lassen have opened offices in London and Oslo. In addition to numerous projects in the Nordic countries, their international work includes Westminster College in London and a new library for the University of Aberdeen. Great Belt Bridge Among the most notable international projects of C. F. M√∏ller Architects are extensions to the Natural History and the National Maritime museums in London (2009‚Äì11). They were also successful in being commissioned to build the Akershus University Hospital in Oslo. Dissing+Weitling are widely recognized as bridge architects after completing some 220 such projects worldwide. These include the Great Belt Bridge between Sealand and Funen, the Queensferry Crossing in Scotland, the Nelson Mandela Bridge in South Africa and the Stonecutters Bridge in Hong Kong. The Great Belt suspension bridge, completed in 1998, is the world's third largest. With a length of and a free span of , the vertical clearance for ships is . Lundgaard & Tranberg are the designers of the Royal Danish Playhouse and the Tietgenkollegiet student housing complex, both considered to be among Copenhagen's most successful new buildings in recent years. =Emerging practices= Another trend in contemporary Danish architecture is the emergence of a new generation of successful young practices, inspired more by international trends than by the modernist tradition in Scandinavia. The generation is spearheaded by Bjarke Ingels whose firm BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group) founded in 2006 has made an unusually rapid transition into a well-established firm. From the beginning, BIG received international recognition for a number of projects, including Mountain Dwellings in √òrestad. Ideologically and conceptually, the practice is more closely related to Dutch firms such as OMA ‚Äì where Ingels worked from 1998 to 2001 ‚Äì and MVRDV than to the work of Danish architects. BIG's major international breakthrough came in 2009 when the firm won six international competitions and gained several large commissions. These include an art museum on a cliffside overlooking Mexico City, a canalside neighbourhood in Hamburg, a new city hall for Tallinn, Estonia, a new national library for Kazakhstan, a low-energy highrise project in Shenzhen, China, and a World Village for Women's Sports in Malm√∂. Four young practices, CEBRA, Cobe, Transform and Effekt, contributed to the project CO-EVOLUTION: Danish/Chinese Collaboration on Sustainable Urban Development in China, which was awarded the Golden Lion at the 2006 Venice Biennale of Architecture. The project was commissioned by the Danish Architecture Centre and curated by the Danish architect-urbanist Henrik Valeur and UiD. All four practices later went on to win high-profile competitions in Denmark and abroad. Effekt has won the competition for a new building for the Estonian Art Academy in Tallinn, Transform has a project on the City Hall Square in Copenhagen and Cobe has won first prize in a competition for Scandinavia's largest sustainable district in Nordhavnen, Copenhagen. Other notable emerging Danish architectural practices include Aart,. Dorthe Mandrup Architects and NORD Architects..

Biography Although a Dutchman, Willems worked with English privateers during the first years of his buccaneering career raiding Rio de la Hacha with Thomas Paine in 1680. In September 1681, he and English privateer William Wright sailed together from Bocas del Toro. Although Willems did not have a commission himself, he captured a Spanish merchantman with a cargo of sugar and tobacco while sailing with Wright south along the caribbean coast of New Granada actual Colombia. Taking the Spanish prize as his own, he gave his old barque to Wright who burned his own ship. They attempted to sell the Spanish cargo at Cura√ßao, however they were forced to leave by the governor. He and Wright then sailed to the Islas Las Aves and Los Roques where they remained until February 1682 and presumably parted ways soon after. During next year, he was among those present at a conference on Roatan in one of the largest held gatherings of the \\"Brethren of the Coast\\". Willems, along with Laurens de Graaf, Nicholas van Hoorn and Michel de Grammont, successfully raided Vera Cruz on May 17, 1683. Using two captured Spanish galleons in the vanguard, he and Laurens de Graaf were able to sneak into the Spanish harbor during the early morning hours and landed a small force on shore. The buccaneers caught the garrison off guard, many of the soldiers still sleeping, and took out the city's defenses allowing the rest of the fleet to enter the harbor. After three or four days, Willems and the others looted the town before retreating at the sight of the New Spain fleet.Konstam, Angus. Pirates: An Illustrated History. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, 2007. (pg. 118-119) In late-November, he joined Michiel Andrieszoon, Francois Le Sage and Laurens de Graaf in attacking Spanish shipping off Cartagena resulting in an altercation with Governor Juan de Pando Estrada who commandeered two Spanish slavers to go after them.Marley, David F. Historic Cities of the Americas: An Illustrated Encyclopedia. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2005. (pg. 751-752) Governor of Jamaica Thomas Lynch tried to hire Willems to capture French pirate Jean Hamlin in 1683 after two Navy ships and pirate-turned-pirate-hunter John Coxon failed; Willems refused Lynch's offer. He participated in de Graaf's later raids against Cartagena in 1684 and Campeche in 1685. After the raid on Cartagena, de Graff gave Willems his old flagship, the Princesa. After having sailed alongside fellow Dutch buccaneer Jacob Evertson for several years, Willems reportedly died in the Gulf of Honduras in 1688, possibly alongside Evertson; their remaining crew members signed on with Captain Peterson.

Founded and built in 1958 by Bill Pistol and Bob McMillan, it became known as a \\"Victoria institution\\" for its soft-serve ice cream, friendly service, and local clientele. Located at 126 Douglas Street, the Beacon Drive In is directly across from the 75-hectare Beacon Hill Park, which does not allow food to be sold within the park grounds -- making the fast-food restaurant a destination for picnickers and park-goers. It is also just up the road from the old Beacon Lodge. The most popular item on the menu is the ice cream, which comes in a variety of dips and flavours, as it is known locally as Victoria's soft ice cream headquarters. Part of the Beacon Drive In's appeal stems from the fact that it has been in business for more than 50 years with very few changes. Aside from adding a few awnings, outdoor heaters, and a new colour scheme the building is still the same as it was when it was built. Even the menu is largely unchanged, with current co-owner Peter Loubardeas boasting that \\"our top 10 items have been the same for, I'm going to say, the past 40 years,\\" Loubardeas, along with his father Gus, bought the restaurant in 2005 from Jim Douglas who ran it for more than 42 years, following in the footsteps of his father, H.W. Douglas. According to Gus, and other long-time employees, much of the credit for the unchanging character of the Beacon Drive In belongs to Jim, who was driven by two mottoes -- \\"the customer always comes first\\" and \\"we don't change.\\" The Beacon Drive In's mascot and logo is Beacon Bill, a stylized seagull dressed in rain gear and carrying a life preserver.

It is the oldest cemetery in Toronto still in operation, having opened in 1844. It was originally the burial ground for the Cathedral Church of St. James, but became non-denominational. The main entrance to the cemetery is located on the east side of Parliament Street, north of the intersection at Wellesley Street East. Just to the west is the St. James Town neighbourhood, which is named after the cemetery. History Canadian militiamen who fought at the Battle of Ridgeway at St. James Cemetery, 1866. The cemetery opened in July 1844 for the burial of people professing the Anglican faith. At that time most of the city‚Äôs population of 18,000 lived south of Queen Street West and the cemetery's present location during that era must have been regarded as being outside city limits. The cemetery was necessary as the burial ground around the cathedral itself, in use since 1797, was out of room. Recognizing the growing trend towards cremation throughout the world, a crematorium was added in 1948. To date over 89,000 interments and 75,000 cremations have taken place at the cemetery. The cemetery itself is home to the Chapel of St. James-the-Less which sites atop a knoll at the highest point in the cemetery. In its vigorous, harmonious composition, this small funeral chapel is a splendid example of Victorian Gothic design. Its sense of strength and spirituality is derived from the subtle contrast of its stone walls, enveloping roofs, and soaring spire. Erected in 1860 and opened in 1861, the chapel was designed by Frederick William Cumberland and Storm, one of Toronto's leading 19th-century architectural firms.

Polybius speaks of him as a vain, arid lightheaded man, who disparaged his own people, and was indifferently devoted to the study of Greek literature.Polybius, xl. 6 He relates a tale of him and Cato the Elder, who reproved Albinus sharply because in the preface to his history he begged the pardon of his readers, if he should make any mistakes in writing in a foreign language; Cato reminded him that he was not compelled to write at all, but that if he chose to write, he had no business to ask for the indulgence of his readers. This tale is also related by Aulus Gellius,Aulus Gellius, xi. 8 Macrobius,Macrobius, Preface to Saturnalia Plutarch,Plutarch, Cato 12 and the Suda.Suda, s. v.

His highest rank was ≈çzeki. Career Born in Chuo, he joined Dewanoumi stable and was coached by former yokozuna Hitachiyama. He made his debut in May 1917, and was promoted to the j≈´ry≈ç division in May 1922. After winning the j≈´ry≈ç division championship in January 1923 he reached the top makuuchi division in May 1923. In January 1926, at the rank of maegashira 2, he finished as runner-up to yokozuna Tsunenohana with a fine 10‚Äì1 record. His earned him promotion to sekiwake, and after two more runner- up performances he was promoted to ≈çzeki in May 1927. In January 1928, he won his only top division y≈´sh≈ç, or championship, but it caused great controversy. On Day 10, he scored a win by default (fusensho) against Nishinoumi Kajir≈ç III, who was a no-show for the bout. His rival for the championship, veteran maegashira and former sekiwake Misugiiso, had won all his bouts in actual fights but was then defeated by strong komusubi Tamanishiki (later yokozuna) on the 11th day. At the end of the tournament they both had 10‚Äì1 records, as Hitachiiwa had defeated yokozuna Miyagiyama on the final day. Hitachiiwa and Misugiiso were too far apart in rank to have been paired against each other during the tournament, and as there was no playoff system in place at that time, Hitachiiwa, in the higher ≈çzeki rank was awarded the y≈´sh≈ç. Many people sympathized with Misugiiso as it had cost him his only chance to win a championship. Misugiiso was only able to win two more bouts in his career and retired a year later. The controversy gathered around the system of keeping score for matches won by default as one wrestler does not appear for their scheduled fight (fusensho). At the time, only in the last two days of a tournament could a win by default be accepted, and there was no formal announcement (kachi-nanori) of the winner by default, so both wrestlers would be scored as not appearing for the match. In the following tournament in March 1928, the modern system was established where the winner by default was officially scored as a win and not a no-show, as it was in the past. Hitachiiwa fell ill after the dispute and was unable to capitalise on his win, sitting out the March 1928 tournament. He was unable to record consistently good results in his following career and was never in contention for another championship. He retired in March 1931. He remained in the sumo world as an elder, under the name Sakaigawa, and worked as a coach in Dewanoumi stable until his death.

They took their name from Raithlinn or Raithleann described around the area of Bandon, in the same area. Archaeologists believe that Garranes Ringfort in Templemartin parish, near Bandon, County Cork may have been Rath Raithleann, the royal seat of the √âoganacht Raithleann. They are descended from Mac Cass, the son of Conall Corc, the first King of Cashel, through Mac Cass' son Echu. History In the 6th century the U√≠ Echach Muman split into two major groups; the U√≠ L√°egaire and the Cenel n√Åeda. The Cenel n√Åeda were descended from Echu's grandson √Åed Ualgarb mac Crimthainn. They gave their name to the barony of Kinalea in southern County Cork. An important sub-sept of the Cenel n√Åeda were the C√©nel mB√©icce, descended from B√©cc mac Fergusa (died 661) who gave their name to the barony of Kinelmeaky. They later became the O Mathghamhna or O'Mahonys. M√°el Muad mac Brain belonged to this branch. The Cen√©l L√°egaire were descended from Echu's grandson L√≥egaire mac Crimthainn and expanded westward toward Bantry as early as the 8th century. They were later represented by Ua Donnchadha, or O'Donoghues, a sept whose chiefs later settled in County Kerry. This branch are still represented among the Gaelic nobility of Ireland by the O'Donoghue of the Glens, Prince of Glenflesk. Members of the Raithlind branch only rarely held the throne of all Munster. According to tradition Mac Cass died before his father and so Conall Corc took his son's inheritance and instead imposed his grandson Echu in the south thereby excluding them from the inner circle of Eoganachta. The Raithlind branch was semi-independent in the south in the territory of Desmond or South Munster, though they may have been subject to the E√≥ganacht Locha L√©in at times during the height of their power in the late 6th and 7th centuries. In any event, following that era the O'Donoghues eventually gained the advantage in the region with Cashel also having a hand in the interim dynamics.

The system is being managed by the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA). The railway equipment including electric power, signalling, rolling stock, and fare collection equipment will be provided by the private sector under a Concession Contract. LAMATA is responsible for policy direction, regulation, and infrastructure for the network. The first section of the network, Phase I of the Blue Line, was originally planned to be completed in 2011. After many delays caused by funding shortfalls. When a project review was completed in 2018 by Alstom, the commencement date was pushed back to 2022,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-west/279888-lagos-light- rail-to-commence-operation-2022-official.html and subsequently pushed forward to 2021.  Timeline  * 2008: A metro is proposed for Lagos, allegedly with a completion date of 2011. * 2009: Construction commences on the Blue Line. * 2010: Lagos Rail Mass Transit to proceed. * 2016: Phase I (the Blue Line from Marina to Mile 2) planned to open in December 2016. * 2018: After an Alstom review of the project, Phase I (the Blue Line from Marina to Mile 2) is now set to open in 2021. History The idea of developing rapid transit in Lagos dates from 1983 with the Lagos Metroline network conceived by the Alhaji Lateef Jakande during the Second Nigerian Republic. The initial Metroline project was scrapped in 1985 by Muhammadu Buhari at a loss of over $78 million to the Lagos tax payers. The idea of developing a light rail network for Lagos was revived by Governor Bola Tinubu in the early 2000s with a formal announcement of its construction in December 2003. This initial $135 million proposal was part of the greater Lagos Urban Transportation Project to be implemented by the newly formed Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA). LAMATA initially concentrated on developing a Bus Rapid Transit system, running from Mile 12 to Lagos Island. In 2008, LAMATA began also to make progress with the rail project, focusing initially on the Blue Line and the Red Line. Rolling stock In September 2011, LAMATA announced that it would acquire some H5-series subway trains formerly used by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The cars were to be refurbished in the United States and converted to standard gauge before being imported and put into service on the Blue and Red lines. The same contract also included an option for some H6-series subway cars from the TTC, however this has since been cancelled. The trains were built as two-unit married pairs with a driver's cab in the front right corner of each car. In January 2015, LAMATA has opted for Chinese-built trains instead, ordering 15 electro-diesel multiple units from CNR Dalian with an option for 14 more. About 76 H5 cars that had been taken for refurbishment to Buffalo, New York, have been scrapped by August 2015. In August 2018, LAMATA signed an agreement with Alstom. As a part of the agreement, Alstom conducted a review of the rail lines. After the review of the rail project, which should have initiated passenger activity, the state government said the Blue Line, would now be ready for passenger operation by 2022. This deal also plans for the electrification of a portion of the track. RoutesOkokomaiko-Marina Blue Line= In April 2008, the Lagos State Government approved ‚Ç¶ 70 billion for construction of the Okokomaiko-Iddo-Marina Line, with an estimated completion date of 2011. However, the project suffered many delays due to funding shortfalls. The opening date was revised to June 2013, then December 2016, then 2017. As of November 2016, only 16 km of the 27 km Blue Line had been completed. The contract was awarded to the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), with advisory services being provided by CPCS Transcom Limited. Lagos State is financing construction of the Blue Line from its own resources. The Blue Line will run 27.5 km from Marina to Okokomaiko, with 13 stations and an end-to-end journey time of 35 minutes. The entire Blue Line will operate over a secure and exclusive right- of-way, with no level crossings and no uncontrolled access by pedestrians or vehicles. The route will run on the surface in the central reservation of the Lagos-Badagry Expressway between Igbo-Elerin Road (Okokomaiko) and Iganmu. The line will then be elevated from Iganmu along the south side of the expressway passing the junction with Eric Moore Road, crossing just south of the National Theatre to Iddo, then south to Lagos Island with a terminal at Marina. A Maintenance and Storage Facility (MSF) will be constructed at Okokomaiko, with a track connection from the Blue Line to the depot. =Agbado-Marina Red Line= The second line, the Red Line, will run from Marina to Agbado. The line will share the right-of-way of the Lagos‚ÄìKano Standard Gauge Railway.

It is a low growing, heath-like shrub with crowded leaves and which produces solitary pale to dark purple flowers in the leaf axils predominantly between July and October in its native range. Description Eremophila scaberula is a heath-like shrub which grows to a height of between . Its branches have prominent ridges leading down from the leaf bases and are slightly sticky due to the presence of resin. The leaves are arranged in whorls of 3 or 4 along the branches and are linear in shape, mostly long, about wide, rough to the touch and slightly sticky. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on short, glabrous, sticky stalks long. There are 5 tapering egg-shaped, glabrous, sticky sepals which are about long with some narrower than others. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube and lobes are dark lilac-coloured to purple and white with brown to purple spots inside the tube. The inside and outside surfaces are glabrous except that the middle part of the lower lobe and the inside of the tube are hairy. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs between July and October and is followed by fruits which are small, dry, woody, cone-shaped, long and have a glabrous, papery covering.Young cultivated plant at Kings Park, Western Australia Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by William Vincent Fitzgerald in 1905 and the description was published in Journal of the West Australia Natural History Society. The specific epithet (scaberula) is a Latin word meaning \\"minutely scabrous\\". Distribution and habitat Rough emu bush occurs in a few areas of remnant bushland near Moora, growing in clay or loam in woodland in the Avon Wheatbelt and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions. Conservation Eremophila scaberula is classified as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia). It is listed as \\"Critically Endangered\\" (CR) under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and an interim recovery plan has been prepared. In 1999, the total wild population was estimated to be 455 plants occurring in three locations to the south of Moora. Threats to the population include weed competition, fire, degraded habitat, disturbance from maintenance activities and, conversely, lack of site disturbance. Use in horticulture This small eremophila has small, dark green leaves which contrast attractively with the usually blue flowers, and it can be used to fill the space under taller plants. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock and grows best in well-drained soil in either full sun or partial shade. It is drought tolerant, only needing an occasional watering during a long drought and it is tolerant of even the most severe frosts.

It suffered more casualties in an ill-fated charge during the Siege of Petersburg than any Union regiment lost in a single day of combat throughout the war. It was also the Union regiment with the highest number of officers killed (23).Cartmell, Donald, Civil War Book of Lists (2001), p. 81. The regiment was mustered in Bangor, Maine, in 1862 as the 18th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment and consisted mostly of men and officers from the Penobscot River Valley (the area around Bangor and points east). It was commanded by Col. Daniel Chaplin, a Bangor merchant. Charles Hamlin, son of Vice President Hannibal Hamlin, was originally an officer in this regiment, but was promoted to a position on the staff of Maj. Gen. Hiram G. Berry before it saw significant action. The regiment's name was changed in 1863 to the 1st Maine Heavy Artillery Regiment, and it served in the defenses of Washington, D.C. before being reassigned to the Army of the Potomac during the Overland Campaign in the spring of 1864. At the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, the regiment took its first heavy casualties--6 officers and 76 men killed, and another 6 officers and 388 men wounded. At Petersburg, however, an ill-advised charge across an open field toward Confederate breastworks on June 18, 1864, ordered by Chaplin, resulted in the greatest single loss of life in a Union regiment to occur in the war, with 7 officers and 108 men killed, and another 25 officers and 464 men wounded. These casualties constituted 67% of the strength of the 900-man force. Chaplin survived the action but was later killed by a sharpshooter.Whitman, William E.S. and Turner, Charles H., Maine in the War for the Union (Lewiston, Me.: 1865), pp. 458-471. The regiment was commanded by Russell Benjamin Shepherd for the remainder of the war. All in all, the 1st Maine sustained one of the highest casualty rates in the war, with 423 killed, and another 260 died of disease.Dyer (1959), Volume 3. p. 1,216.

The theatre is Canada's only community-owned non-profit repertory cinema. History The Streamline Moderne style movie theatre was designed by George Forrester with the architectural firm of Webster and Gilbert and opened on December 5, 1946. The theatre was Broadway's entertainment destination during the post-World War II years. It screened popular movies of the period and hosted some live musical performances on the stage in front of the movie screen. Following the neighbourhood's decline starting in the 1950s, the theatre fell into disrepute by the 1970s when it became an \\"adult\\" movie theatre. It was restored as an art film cinema and live performance venue during the 1980s. It was designated a municipal heritage property on April 14, 1997. On August 2, 1993, the Broadway Theatre abruptly closed its doors. After a public fundraising drive, it was purchased by the Friends of the Broadway Theatre, Inc., a non-profit organization with charitable status dedicated to the preservation and renovation of the theatre. It reopened in October 1993, resuming its previous role. In addition to art, Canadian and regional cinema, the theatre also hosts some live music performances. Facility The theatre seats 240 in a centre bank of seats with another 95 in each of the side banks for a total of 430 seats, plus 6 wheelchair stations. The stage is of a proscenium style, made of black masonite and measures wide and deep. The movie screen is wide by high, with a projection throw of .

After graduating from the naval academy he joined (1830) the corps of navy cadets () and in 1832 was promoted midshipman in the Baltic Fleet, serving on the frigates Belton, Kulm and Oranienbaum. In 1836-1837 he was sent to the Caspian Sea, and participated in naval operations during the Caucasian War. His bravery during the war earned him the rank of lieutenant. In 1838 Krabbe was appointed the General Staff of the Imperial Navy as aide-de-camp to Prince L.S. Menshikov. In 1839 he was sent to the Azov Sea to organize a naval expedition along the northern coast of the Black Sea, being in command of a squadron under admiral Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev, at that time the Commander of the Black Sea Fleet. He took part in General Vasily Perovsky's Khivan Expedition of 1839-1840. Promoted captain lieutenant in 1842, he was part of the Russian mission led by Captain Yevfimy Vasilievich Putyatin to Iran.

He served as the 148th District Court Judge of Corpus Christi, Texas.Caller.comEditorials: District Court Judges, Corpus Christi for 3 terms in the 1980s to the 1990s and served two terms as Judge of the Nueces County Court at Law from 1972-1976 .He also served as Assistant District Attorney in Corpus Christi in the late 1960s. Garza was the first Mexican American to be elected to a judgeship in Nueces County. He was also notable for creating the first Mexican-American comic book hero, Relampago, in 1977 and was a pioneer in the nascent industry of comic retailers. Garza died in 1995 after a lifetime of public service to his community. Relampago Garza created Relampago shortly after attending a local comic book convention. Tired of seeing the same crimes being tried in his court-room, he had created the superhero as a way to exercise his own fantasies of fighting crime. As he further developed the character and storyline, Judge Garza sent letters to Marvel and DC Comics telling them of his creation, but both companies showed little interest.Conexi√≥n Magazine - RELAMPAGO! He would later try to get a listing in a comic pricing guide, but the publishers said the character was \\"too obscure\\". The Judge decided to maintain the comic in a self-published print, becoming more of a personal project than a money-making venture. Relampago made his first published appearance in Relampago! #1 in 1977. Only 1,000 copies of the original book were printed at the time and many of them destroyed soon after due to concerns of possible copyright infringement, making it a rarity among collectors. Only two subsequent issues followed soon after. Several years later, the comic attracted the attention of Richard Dominguez, a Dallas illustrator, who found an issue of the comic in a half- price book store. Forming a close friendship, Garza and Dominguez planned a Relampago revival series. Their progress was hindered, however, due to Garza's long hours in court and hectic schedule. To prove himself to the Judge, Dominguez published his own comic book titled El Gato Negro in 1993. Garza realized how serious Dominguez was and agreed to collaborate on a new Relampago series with a planned cross-over issue featuring their respective heroes. This collaboration never came to be however, as Judge Garza died in 1995 before a script could be written.PCBRRelampago - The first Mexican American superheroAzteca Production's Relampago ReferencesExternal links *Relampago, The Invincible Man on Myspace Category:1995 deaths Category:1931 births Category:Science fiction fans Category:Comic book editors Category:American judges of Mexican descent Category:Texas state court judges Category:20th-century American judges ","title":"Margarito C.

The rest of the Achaemenid, Parthian, Sassanid, Tahirid, Ghaznavid, Seljuqid and Samanid dynasties according to Pourpirar were fabricated by historians of mostly Jewish background as part of a Jewish conspiracy.12CentSil According to Pourpirar a few historic sites that are said to be Parthian are either clearly related to Greeks or are modern forgery. He claimed that all inscriptions said to be Sassanid are modern forgeries. He claimed that historical personalities such as Mazdak, Mani, Zoroaster, Babak, Abu Moslem, and Salman the Persian were invented by modern Jewish historians.ÿ¢ŸÇÿß€å €åÿ¥ÿß€åÿß€å€å ÿØÿ± ÿ¢ŸÜ ŸÖÿ∞ÿß⁄©ÿ±ŸáŸî ÿØÿ±ÿßÿ≤ŸÖÿØÿ™ ÿ™ŸÑŸÅŸÜ€å ŸÜ€åÿ≤ €åÿßÿØÿ¢Ÿàÿ± ÿ¥ÿØŸÖ ⁄©Ÿá ŸÇÿ™ŸÑ‚ÄåÿπÿßŸÖ ŸÖÿ±ÿØŸÖ Ÿà ŸÖÿ≠Ÿà ÿ™ŸÖÿØŸÜ Ÿà Ÿáÿ≥ÿ™€å ÿ¥ÿ±ŸÇ ŸÖ€åÿßŸÜŸáÿå ÿØÿ± €≤€µ€∞€∞ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ Ÿæ€åÿ¥ ÿØÿ± ŸÖÿßÿ¨ÿ±ÿß€å ÿ™ÿßÿ±€åÿÆ€å ŸæŸàÿ±€åŸÖÿå ÿßÿ≤ ŸÜÿ∏ÿ± ŸÖŸàÿ±ÿÆ ŸÇÿßÿ®ŸÑ‚ÄåÿØŸÅÿßÿπ‚Äåÿ™ÿ± ÿßÿ≤ ÿß€åŸÜ ÿØÿ±Ÿàÿ∫‚ÄåŸÜŸà€åÿ≥€å Ÿà ÿ¨ÿπŸÑ€åÿßÿ™€å ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ ⁄©Ÿá ŸÖŸàÿ±ÿÆ€åŸÜ Ÿà ÿ®ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ‚Äåÿ¥ŸÜÿßÿ≥ÿßŸÜ €åŸáŸàÿØ ÿØÿ± ÿ™ŸàŸÑ€åÿØÿßÿ™ ÿ™ÿßÿ±€åÿÆ€å ŸÇÿ±ŸÜ ÿßÿÆ€åÿ± ÿ¢Ÿàÿ±ÿØŸá‚ÄåÿßŸÜÿØÿå Ÿà ÿ®ÿ±ÿß€å ŸæŸèÿ±⁄©ÿ±ÿØŸÜ ÿÆŸÑÿ£ ÿØÿ±ÿßÿ≤ŸÖÿØÿ™ Ÿáÿ≥ÿ™€å ÿØÿ± ŸÖŸÜÿ∑ŸÇŸá‚Äå€å ŸÖÿß ÿå ⁄©Ÿá ÿ≠ÿßÿµŸÑ ⁄Øÿ≥ÿ™ÿ±ÿØ⁄Ø€å ŸÇÿ™ŸÑ‚ÄåÿπÿßŸÖ ŸæŸàÿ±€åŸÖ ÿ®ŸàÿØÿå ÿßŸÅÿ≥ÿßŸÜŸá‚ÄåŸáÿß€å ÿßÿ¥⁄©ÿßŸÜ€åÿßŸÜ Ÿà ÿ≥ÿßÿ≥ÿßŸÜ€åÿßŸÜ Ÿà ÿ≤ÿ±ÿØÿ¥ÿ™ Ÿà ÿßŸàÿ≥ÿ™ÿß Ÿà ŸÖÿ≤ÿØ⁄© Ÿà ŸÖÿßŸÜ€å ÿ±ÿß ÿ®ÿ±ŸáŸÖ ÿßŸÜÿ®ÿßÿ¥ÿ™Ÿá‚ÄåÿßŸÜÿØÿå ÿ¨ÿßÿπŸÑÿßŸÜŸá ⁄©ÿ™€åÿ®Ÿá‚ÄåŸáÿß€å ÿ≥ÿßÿ≥ÿßŸÜ€å ÿ≠⁄© ⁄©ÿ±ÿØŸá‚ÄåÿßŸÜÿØÿå ÿ®ÿ±ÿß€å ⁄©Ÿàÿ±ÿ¥ ÿØÿ± €å⁄© ⁄©ÿ¥ÿ™ÿ≤ÿßÿ± ⁄Üÿ∫ŸÜÿØÿ±ÿå ÿ®ÿß ÿØÿ≤ÿØ€å ÿßÿ≤ ŸÖÿµÿßŸÑÿ≠ ŸÖÿ≥ÿ¨ÿØ ŸÖÿ≥ŸÑŸÖ€åŸÜÿå ÿ¥Ÿáÿ±⁄© Ÿæÿßÿ≥ÿßÿ±⁄ØÿßÿØ ÿ≥ÿßÿÆÿ™Ÿá‚ÄåÿßŸÜÿØÿå ÿµÿØŸáÿß ÿÆ€åÿßŸÜÿ™ ÿØ€å⁄Øÿ± ÿØÿ± Ÿæÿ±ÿß⁄©ŸÜÿØŸÜ ÿßÿ≥ÿ±ÿßÿ¶€åŸÑ€åÿßÿ™ ÿØÿ± ŸÖ€åÿßŸÜ ÿßÿ≥ŸÜÿßÿØ ŸÅÿ±ŸáŸÜ⁄Ø€å ŸÖÿ≥ŸÑŸÖ€åŸÜ ŸÖÿ±ÿ™⁄©ÿ® ÿ¥ÿØŸá‚ÄåÿßŸÜÿØ ⁄©Ÿá ÿ≠ÿßÿµŸÑ ÿ¢ŸÜ ÿ™ŸàŸÑ€åÿØ ÿ¥⁄©ÿßŸÅ Ÿà ÿß€åÿ¨ÿßÿØ ÿ™ŸÅÿ±ŸÇŸá Ÿà ÿØÿ¥ŸÖŸÜ€å ÿØÿ± ŸÖ€åÿßŸÜ ŸÖÿ≥ŸÑŸÖ€åŸÜ ÿ®ŸàÿØŸá‚Äåÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿå Ÿà ⁄ØŸÅÿ™ŸÖ ⁄©Ÿá ÿ¢ŸÜ ÿ≥ÿ®Ÿà€å ÿ®Ÿá‚Äåÿ¥ÿØÿ™ ŸÖÿ≠ÿßŸÅÿ∏ÿ™‚Äåÿ¥ÿØŸáŸî ŸæŸàÿ±€åŸÖ ÿ®Ÿá ŸáŸÖÿ™ ÿ™ÿ≠ŸÇ€åŸÇÿßÿ™ ŸÖÿ¨ŸÖŸàÿπŸá‚Äå€å ¬´ÿ™ÿ£ŸÖŸÑ€å ÿØÿ± ÿ®ŸÜ€åÿßŸÜ ÿ™ÿßÿ±€åÿÆ ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ¬ªÿå ÿßÿ≤ ÿØÿ≥ÿ™ €åŸáŸàÿØ€åÿßŸÜ ÿ±Ÿáÿß ÿ¥ÿØŸá Ÿà ÿ¥⁄©ÿ≥ÿ™Ÿá ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ Ÿà ÿß€åŸÜ⁄© ÿÆÿ±ÿØŸÖŸÜÿØÿßŸÜ ŸÖŸÜÿ∑ŸÇŸá‚Äå€å ŸÖÿß ÿßÿ≤ ŸÖÿ≠ÿ™Ÿà€åÿßÿ™ ŸÖÿ™ÿπŸÅŸÜ ÿ¢ŸÜ ÿ®ÿßÿÆÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿØ.Davazdah Qarn Sokoot, Volume I Regarding the reliability of Iranian dynasties he wrote: \\"So everyone should know that the builders of the false historical and social lies of the last two thousand years between Purim till the Safavids were the Jews.

Main areas of research AgResearch exists to serve the agriculture and biotechnology sectors of New Zealand industry. History AgResearch was created along with New Zealand's other Crown Research Institutes in 1992. In AgResearch's case, this was largely by merging the pastoral agriculture- related portions of MAFTech (the research arm of the then Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries) which had predominantly carried out animal research, with the agriculture-related portions of DSIR, which had predominantly carried out research on forage plants. AgResearch has grown over time by acquiring research organisations \\"down\\" the value stream from its initial on-farm emphasis, such as the former Meat Industry Research Institute of New Zealand (MIRINZ) in 1999 and the former Wool Research Organisation of New Zealand (WRONZ, which had been rebranded as Canesis) in 2007. In March 2009 AgResearch announced that it planned to merge with Lincoln University, but that was subsequently changed to an intention to form a joint venture. A plan called \\"Future Footprint\\" was announced in 2013 to concentrate resources at the Grasslands site in Palmerston North and Lincoln campus near Christchurch. This involved the transfer of about 200 staff mostly from Ruakura (Hamilton) and Invermay (Dunedin) sites. There were reports that a substantial number of staff left the CRI after Future Footprint was announced and staff morale was poor with redundancies being considered in September 2015. About 50 scientific staff were made redundant in 2016. The government approved the restructure in June 2016. Organisation AgResearch's science capability is divided into six groups: Animal Productivity, Forage Improvement, Food & Bio-based Products, Animal Nutrition & Health, Innovative Farm Systems and Land & Environment. Science staff operate in five portfolio groups representing major sectors: Dairy On-farm, Dairy Pasture-to-plate, Meat & Fibre On-farm, Meat & Fibre Paddock-to-Consumer and Agricultural Policy & Maori Agribusiness.

He was born in the city of Isfahan in Iran, and it was here where he learned art, painting, and sculpting. His paintings have been hosted by several museums and exhibitions worldwide.http://www.yjc.ir/en/news/2167/farshchians-latest-work-unveiled-as- iranian-art-work-in-photos He is the most prominent moderniser of the field of miniatures, an art form which was first established in Ancient Persia and later spread to China and Turkey and other Middle eastern countries.  Life  Master Mahmoud Farshchian was born in the city of Isfahan on January 24, 1930. His father, a rug merchant, was an art aficionado who instilled a love for the arts in his son. Young Mahmoud showed an interest in arts quite early in life and studied under the tutelage of Haji Mirza-Agha Emami and Isa Bahadori for several years. After receiving his diploma from Isfahan's high school for the fine arts, Farshchian left for Europe, where he studied the works of the great Western masters of Painting. Consequently, he developed an innovative artistic style with universal appeal. Upon his return to Iran, he began to work at the National Institute of Fine Arts (which later became the Ministry of Art and Culture) and, in time, was appointed director of the Department of National Arts and professor at the university of Tehran's School of Fine Arts. All the while, word of his exemplary works spread far and wide beyond national borders. He has been exhibited in 57 individual shows and 86 group shows in Iran, Europe, America and Asian countries. His works are represented in several museums and major collections worldwide. He has been awarded more than ten prizes by various art institutes and cultural centers. He has a doctorate (grade 1 in arts) in Iranian painting and Islamic arts from the High Council of Culture and Art. \\"The Museum of Master Mahmoud Farshchian\\", is a museum devoted to the works of the master, which has been set up by the Cultural Heritage Foundation in the Sa'dabad Cultural Complex in Tehran, inaugurated in 2001. The design of the Zarih (the box-like latticed enclosure which is placed on top of the tomb), roof, door and cellar in the shrine of the 8th shiite Imam, Ali ibn Mus'ar-Reza in Mashhad and his membership in the committee supervising the construction of the shrine, is another artistic work of the master. Farshchian resides in New Jersey. His son Alimorad Farshchian is a doctor.  Style  Farshchian is the founder of his own school in Iranian Painting, which adheres to classical form while making use of new techniques to broaden the scope of Iranian painting. He has brought new life to this art form and has freed it from the symbiotic relationship it has historically had with poetry and literature, to give it an independence it had not previously enjoyed. His powerful and innovative paintings are dynamic, expansive and vibrant canvases with an appealing fusion of the traditional and the modern, which are constituents of his unique style of painting. Master Farshchian has played a decisive role in introducing Iranian art to the international art scene. He has been invited to speak and exhibit at numerous universities and art institutes. There have been six books and countless articles published about Farshchian's works. In 2007 British-Omani designer Amr Ali used Farschian's painting The Fifth Day of Creation as the main influence for his collection presented at London Fashion Week.  Farshchian and Rumi  Farshchian‚Äôs work ‚ÄúShams and Rumi,‚Äù has been inspired by one of Rumi‚Äôs poems. Special colors have been used in the painting to feature the mystical and spiritual relationship that existed between Shams and Rumi. The painting took two months to complete in the U.S. and was unveiled at the Farshchian Art and Cultural Complex in Isfahan on August 2, 2007.

It was built in 1889 and ran from Kentville to Kingsport serving the Cornwallis Township area of Kings County. For most of its history, it operated as a branch line of the Dominion Atlantic Railway and was sometimes known as the \\"Kingsport Line\\". Route The CVR crossed its namesake, the Cornwallis River, at Kentville and ran north to stations at the Camp Aldershot military base, Mill Village (Steam Mill), and Centreville and then ran east to Ford's Crossing (Gibson Woods), Sheffield Mills, Hillaton, Canning, Pereau, and ended on the large government wharf at Kingsport. An additional branch, the North Mountain Line was added in 1914 running from Centreville to Weston.Dominion Atlantic Railway Timetable June 29, 1914, Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management, VF Vol.1 #5 and Dominion Atlantic Railway Employee Timetable September 25, 1949, Library and Archives Canada, pmp -HE.2804 DC Creation A typical CVR scene, circa 1931: the small country station and giant apple warehouses of Sheffield Mills The Cornwallis Valley Railway was formed in 1887 by merchants in Canning, Nova Scotia, and Kentville including the Member of Parliament Frederick William Borden. Canning merchant Stephen Sheffield was the president.Carmen Miller, A Knight in Politics: A Biography of Frederick William Borden, p. 59 Built with local labour under professional supervision, the line opened on December 22, 1890, leasing rolling stock and terminal facilities from the Windsor and Annapolis Railway (W&A;) in Kentville.\\"Kingsport Subdivision, \\"The Cornwallis Valley Railway\\" 1890 to 1961\\", Dominion Atlantic Railway Digital Preservation Inititative Tapping the richest apple growing areas of Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley, the railway immediately led to the construction of large warehouses beside its tracks to pack and ship apples. It quickly proved profitable and was purchased by the Windsor and Annapolis Railway in 1892.Marguerite Woodworth, History of the Dominion Atlantic Railway, 1937, p. 104-107. When the W&A; became the Dominion Atlantic Railway in 1894, the CVR became a subdivision of the Dominion Atlantic but the name \\"CVR\\" continued in local use until the line was finally abandoned in the 1990s.Ivan Smith, \\"Cornwallis Valley Railway Notes on Company History\\", Nova Scotia's Electronic Attic Growth The CVR's traffic thrived on apple exports as well as freight and passengers from the connection to steamers and schooners at the Kingsport wharf. Apple warehouses grew to 30 on the short line: one for every mile and a half of track. It enjoyed heavy traffic in its first decades, running up to scheduled six trains a day. It also served as a suburban railway for the central part of Kings County, bringing school children, shoppers and workers to town in the morning and back home at night. In 1914, a western branch was completed to Weston, adding more apple shipping traffic. Closure The collapse of the apple industry after 1945 and the increasing availability of paved roads both eroded traffic in the 1950s. After several years of application, the Dominion Atlantic abandoned most of the CVR lines in 1961. Tracks were cut back to Mill Village, (Steam Mill), 2 miles north of Kentville. The line became a spur serving feed mills and a fertilizer plant at Mill Village. On September 22, 1993, the owner of the Dominion Atlantic, CP Rail, abandoned all its tracks west and north of Kentville. Most of the CVR was sold to adjacent landowners, although portions of the roadbed remain as informal hiking and snowmobile trails.

It is designed to hold the unspun fibers, keeping them untangled and thus easing the spinning process. It is most commonly used to hold flax, and sometimes wool, but can be used for any type of fiber. Fiber is wrapped around the distaff, and tied in place with a piece of ribbon or string. The word comes from dis in Low German, meaning a bunch of flax, connected with staff. As an adjective the term distaff is used to describe the female side of a family. The corresponding term for the male side of a family is the \\"spear\\" side. Form Alsatian spinner with wheel and distaff The Spinner by William- Adolphe Bouguereau (1873), shown with spindle and distaff Russian distaffs displayed at the museum of folk handicrafts at Ferapontov Monastery In Western Europe there were two common forms of distaves, depending on the spinning method. The traditional form is a staff, held under one's arm while using a spindle. It is about long, held under the left arm, with the left hand drawing the fibers from it.\\"Distaff.\\" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. This version is the older of the two, as spindle spinning predates spinning on a wheel. A distaff can also be mounted as an attachment to a spinning wheel. On a wheel it is placed next to the bobbin, where it is in easy reach of the spinner. This version is shorter, but otherwise does not differ from the spindle version. By contrast, the traditional Russian distaff, used both with spinning wheels and spindles, is L-shaped, and consists of a horizontal board, known as the dontse (), and a flat vertical piece, frequently oar-shaped, to the inner side of which the bundle of fibers was tied or pinned. The spinner sat on the dontse with the vertical piece of the distaff to her left, and drew the fibers out with her left hand. The distaff was often richly carved and painted, and was an important element of Russian folk art. Recently handspinners have begun using wrist-distaves to hold their fiber; these are made of flexible material such as braided yarn, and can swing freely from the wrist. They generally consist of a loop with a tail, at the end of which is a tassel, often with beads on each strand. The spinner wraps the roving or tow around the tail and through the loop to keep it out of the way, and to keep it from getting snagged. Dressing Dressing a distaff is the act of wrapping the fiber around the distaff. With flax, the wrapping is done by laying the flax fibers down, approximately parallel to each other and the distaff, then carefully rolling the fibers onto the distaff. A ribbon or string is then tied at the top, and loosely wrapped around the fibers to keep them in place. Other meanings The Spinner by Wilhelm Leibl (1892), features spinning flax from a distaff The term distaff is also used as an adjective to describe the matrilineal branch of a familyDistaff Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary, Retrieved on 2008-07-22, i.e., to the person's mother and her blood relatives. This term developed in the English-speaking communities where a distaff spinning tool was used often to symbolize domestic life. One still recognized use of the term is in horse racing, in which races limited to female horses are referred to as distaff races. From 1984 until 2007, at the American Breeders' Cup, the major race for fillies and mares was the Breeders' Cup Distaff. From 2008 to 2012, the event was referred to as the Breeders' Cup Ladies' Classic. Starting in 2013, the name of the race changed back to being called the Breeders' Cup Distaff. It is commonly regarded as the female analog to the better-known Breeders' Cup Classic, though female horses are not barred from entering that race.

As of the 2010 United States Census, the city population was 6,077. It is about northwest of downtown Austin and north of San Antonio. Lake Marble Falls is part of the Highland Lakes on the Colorado River, the largest chain of lakes in Texas. It hosts one of the largest drag boat races in the United States each August. History Marble Falls was founded by Adam Rankin Johnson in 1887, a former Indian fighter and Confederate general, known as \\"Stovepipe\\" Johnson for his Civil War escapades, which included duping the Union army in Newburgh, Indiana, with fake \\"cannons,\\" constructed from stovepipes and wagon wheels. Johnson had viewed the natural Marble Falls during his pre-war days as a Burnet County surveyor, and had dreamed of building an industrial city, powered by the tumbling Colorado River, not to be confused with the river of the same name in Colorado and Arizona. Despite a \\"friendly fire\\" incident which blinded him near the end of the Civil War, General Johnson followed through with his dream, facilitating the construction of a railroad to nearby Granite Mountain in 1884, then (with ten partners, including one son, one nephew and two sons-in-law) platting the townsite and selling lots, beginning July 12, 1887. Johnson built a fine home, a college (soon to be home of the \\"Falls on the Colorado Museum\\") and a large factory near the falls. The town grew to a population of 1,800 within ten years. Marble Falls made history in 1917 by electing Ophelia Crosby \\"Birdie\\" Harwood as the first woman mayor in Texas, three years before women were allowed to vote. When the Max Starcke Dam was completed in 1951, the marble falls which had given the town its name were submerged under the new Lake Marble Falls. While the town's economy struggled through the drought of the 1950s, a new economy based on tourism and retirement began to grow in the 1970s. During the last thirty years, Marble Falls has grown into the retail and entertainment center for the Highland Lakes area, and continues to attract tourists, retirees and new businesses. Geography Marble Falls is located in southern Burnet County at (30.5741, -98.2782), on the banks of Lake Marble Falls. According to the Handbook of Texas website, the former falls were flooded by the lake, which was created by a shelf of limestone running diagonally across the Colorado River from northeast to southwest. The upper layer of limestone, brownish on the exterior but a deep blue inside, was so hard and cherty it was mistaken for marble. The falls were actually three distinct formations at the head of a canyon long, with a drop of some through the limestone strata. The natural lake and waterfall were covered when the Colorado River was dammed with the completion of Max Starcke Dam in 1951. A photo of the falls as they once existed can be seen at the website for the Wallace Guest House, a local bed and breakfast. Lake Marble Falls sits between Lake Lyndon B. Johnson to the north and Lake Travis to the south. The falls for which the city is named are now underwater but are revealed every few years when the lake is lowered. Equally noteworthy is the huge igneous batholith called Granite Mountain looming on the town's western edge that secured Marble Falls' place in Texas history. The famed pink granite was used for the construction of the Texas State Capitol and other state government office buildings, and can also be found in the Galveston Seawall and Austin‚ÄìBergstrom International Airport. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 5.21%, is water. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 6,077 people, 2,486 households, and 1,542 families residing in the city. There were 28,235 housing units. The racial makeup of the city was 83.1% White, 3.9% African American, 0.7% Native American, 0.8% Asian, 9.1% from other races, and 2.4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 24.2% of the population. There were 2,486 households, out of which 29.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 42% were married couples living together, 14.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 38% were non- families. The average household size was 2.41 and the average family size was 3.08. Marble Falls, as of December 1, 2009, is the anchor of the Marble Falls, TX Micropolitan Statistical Area. The census bureau has defined this area as including all of Burnet County and has a total population of 42,896. The micropolitan area, due to close ties to nearby Austin, is a component of the Austin-Round Rock-Marble Falls, TX Consolidated Statistical Area.

Known as the \\"Garden of the Gulf\\", the island is located in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence north of Nova Scotia and east of New Brunswick, with which it forms the Northumberland Strait. PEI consists of the capital city Charlottetown, as well as urban towns Cornwall and Stratford and a developing urban fringe. A smaller urban area surrounds Summerside Harbour, situated on the southern shore west of Charlottetown Harbour, and consists primarily of the city of Summerside. As with all natural harbours on the island, Charlottetown and Summerside harbours are created by rias. (See also a list of communities in Prince Edward Island.) The island's landscape is pastoral: rolling hills, pristine forests, white sand beaches, ocean coves and the famous red soil have given Prince Edward Island a reputation as a province of outstanding natural beauty. A number of laws have been passed by the provincial government to attempt to preserve the landscape through regulation, although the lack of consistent enforcement and absence of province-wide zoning and land-use planning has resulted in some aesthetically displeasing development in recent years. The island's lush landscape has had a strong bearing not only on its economy but also its culture. Author Lucy Maud Montgomery drew inspiration from the land during the late Victorian Era for the setting of her classic novel Anne of Green Gables. Today, many of the same qualities that Montgomery and others found in the Island are enjoyed by tourists who visit during all seasons. They enjoy a variety of leisure activities, including beaches, various golf courses, eco-tourism adventures, and simply touring the countryside and enjoying cultural events in local communities around the island. The highest point of land is located at Springton in Queens County, rising above sea level. Communities The smaller rural communities as well as the towns and villages throughout the province proudly retain a slower-paced, old world flavour, something that factors heavily into Prince Edward Island's popularity as a destination for relaxation. Most rural communities on Prince Edward Island are based on small- scale agriculture, given that the size of farm properties is quite small when compared with other areas in Canada. There is an increasing amount of industrial farming as older farm properties are consolidated and modernized. Coastline The coastline of the island consists of a combination of long beaches, dunes, red sandstone cliffs, saltwater marshes and numerous bays and harbours. The beaches, dunes and sandstone cliffs consist of sedimentary rock and other material with a high iron concentration which oxidizes upon exposure to the air. The geological properties of white silica sand found at Basin Head are unique in the province; the sand grains cause a scrubbing noise as they rub against each other when walked on. Large dune fields on the north shore can be found on barrier islands at the entrances to various bays and harbours. The magnificent sand dunes at Greenwich are of particular significance. The shifting, parabolic dune system is home to a variety of birds and rare plants and is also a site of significant archaeological interest.

A flashback scene in the film reveals that the young Coffin Joe (portrayed in the scene by Raymond Castile) survived after submerging in a swamp at the end of the previous film. After serving 40 years in a prison mental ward, Coffin Joe (Jos√© Mojica Marins) is released to the streets of modern-day S√£o Paulo. Immediately after his release, Coffin Joe renews his lifelong obsession to sire a male child with a woman whom he perceives to be of exceptional qualities capable of continuing his bloodline, which he feels to be \\"superior\\" above all others.  Plot  After being released from the prison mental ward, Coffin Joe is greeted at the gate by his old and loyal servant Bruno (Rui Rezende), who takes him to a secluded basement below a favela in S√£o Paulo. As well as Bruno, the hideout is populated by four fanatics who are obsessed with Coffin Joe's history and ideas, and have been waiting and preparing for his arrival in order that they may faithfully serve him. After questioning their motives and testing their loyalty, Coffin Joe immediately orders the followers to begin kidnapping women so he can renew his murderous quest for \\"the continuation of the blood\\", his lifelong obsession to find who he determines to be a perfect woman who will bear him a son. His first victim is Dr. Hilda (Cl√©o De P√°ris), a controversial eugenicist who Bruno kidnaps. Coffin Joe tests her will by injecting her with drugs and she has hallucinations of Coffin Joe cutting off her buttock and presenting it to her after which she willingly eats it. Meanwhile, Coronel Claudiomiro Pontes (Jece Valad√£o), a fervently Roman Catholic police captain who holds an old grudge against Coffin Joe for blinding his eye, and Father Eug√™nio (Milhem Cortaz), a mentally unstable priest (the son of one of Coffin Joe's past victims, Dr. Rudolfo in At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul) learn about Coffin Joe's release, and decide to join forces to seek Coffin Joe and kill him once and for all. On his first night, Coffin Joe starts to be haunted by ghostly visions of his previous victims, including Terezinha and Lenita from At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul, and Laura from This Night I'll Possess Your Corpse. However, he convinces himself that they are just his imagination although they continue to haunt him throughout the film. He later singles out a young gypsy woman named Elena (Nara Sakar√™), who has also been intrigued with him since his appearance at the favela. Elena's aunts, Cab√≠ria (Helena Ignez) and Lucr√©cia (D√©bora Muniz), knowing of his evil history, perform a ritual to protect Elena from Coffin Joe and place a curse on him. After Joe kills the two aunts, Elena offers herself to him, although while having sex with her he has a vision where he finds himself in another dimension which is a bloody, intestine-like maze. There he is met by a figure called the Mystifier (Jos√© Celso Martinez Corr√™a), who takes him to an arid, surreal landscape called Purgatory. The Mystifier shows Coffin Joe horrific visions of human depravity, suffering, and perversion, as well as a female figure of Coffin Joe's death. Greatly disturbed, Joe sends his followers to quickly kidnap several more women and proceeds to torture them through sadistic ordeals to test their endurance and willingness to succumb to his perceived superiority. When the police find Coffin Joe's hideout that night they find it deserted, except for the gruesome remains of his victims. Joe escapes through the dark woods with Colonel Pontes and Father Eug√™nio after him. Joe arrives at the closed amusement park, Playcenter, where Joe kills the policemen, but is wounded by Father Eug√™nio, who impales Coffin Joe through the heart with a large crucifix. Although relieved thinking he has killed Coffin Joe, Father Eug√™nio is immediately pursued by shadows and the voice of Coffin Joe as he leaves the amusement park. As Father Eug√™nio leaves, Elena appears. She pulls the crucifix out of Coffin Joe, removes her clothes and has sexual intercourse with him. The final scene takes place at Coffin Joe's funeral, where it is revealed that Coffin Joe achieved his goal in the end, as the women who survived his ordeals, including Hilda and Elena, gathered at his funeral, are all pregnant.

Viseu Cathedral is the Catholic bishopric seat of the city of Viseu, in Portugal. The church started being built in the 12th century and is the most important historical monument of the town. It is currently a mix of architectural styles, specially from the Manueline, Renaissance and Mannerist periods. The cathedral is located on a large and harmonious square, beside the old Bishop's Palace (now the Gr√£o Vasco Museum) and in front of the Miseric√≥rdia Church of Viseu. History Archaeological surveys have indicated that the site of Viseu Cathedral was occupied by an Early Christian basilica built during the times of Sueve domination (5th-6th centuries). Christian life in the city was disturbed in the 8th century with the arrival of Moorish invaders, who dominated Viseu until Ferdinand I of Le√≥n reconquered it in 1058. The bishopric seat was reestablished in the mid-12th century, when the current cathedral building started being erected, but little remains from this early Romanesque building except for some architectural details. The church was greatly enlarged in the following centuries of the Middle Ages, assuming its present configuration as a three-aisled building with three Eastern chapels. Some Gothic chapels in the cloisters also date from this period. Inner stone vaulting with ribs in the shape of twisted ropes and knots. From an artistic point of view, the most important building campaigns took place in the 16th century. Bishop Diogo Ortiz de Vilhena encharged architect Jo√£o de Castilho with the construction of the stone roof of the church and a new fa√ßade, which were finished around 1513. Date from this time the rib vaulting of the aisles with decorative ribs in the shape of twisted ropes and knots, a masterpiece of the Manueline style. Around 1539, bishop Miguel da Silva entrusted the building of a new cloister to Italian architect Francisco da Cremona, who designed a fine Renaissance structure. Also in the first half of the 16th century the cathedral was enriched with several series of painted altarpieces commissioned to leading artists of the time, the most celebrated of which was Vasco Fernandes. These altarpieces were later disassembled but can be seen nowadays in the Gr√£o Vasco Museum, located beside the cathedral. The old Gothic main chapel was replaced by a new one in the early 17th century. In 1635, a tower and the Manueline style portal were destroyed during a storm, and a new one was entrusted to Salamanca architect Jo√£o Moreno. The current fa√ßade, in the shape of a Mannerist altarpiece, dates from this time. In the Baroque period the cathedral was enriched with an organ, pulpits, altarpieces and tiles (azulejos). Art & architecture Viseu Cathedral is a Latin cross church with a three-aisled nave, transept and three Eastern chapels. The main fa√ßade is flanked by two towers. The outer, lateral walls of the church have a heavy, menacing appearance, typical of Portuguese mediaeval cathedrals, being partially decorated with merlons. Interior viewed towards the main chapel. The South (clock) tower is still of mediaeval origin, while the North tower had to be rebuilt in the 17th century after a storm. The storm also destroyed the Manueline fa√ßade, which was rebuilt around 1635. The three-storey fa√ßade resembles a Mannerist altarpiece and is decorated with niches harbouring statues of the Four Evangelists, as well as the Holy Mary and Saint Theotonius. In the interior, all aisles are of approximately equal height, resembling a hall church. The stone rib vaulting is supported by massive pillars and was built between 1505 and 1513, being an outstanding example of Manueline architecture. Some ribs of the roof (liernes) are shaped like twisted ropes and knots, typical Manueline decorative motifs. The main chapel was rebuilt in Mannerist style and features a gilt-woodwork Baroque-Rococo altarpiece designed by famed sculptor Santos Pacheco, who was also responsible for the main altarpiece of Porto Cathedral. The altarpiece incorporates a Holy Mary statue from the 14th century and was carved between 1729 and 1733 by Francisco Machado. The choir stalls were built by Gaspar Ferreira after 1733. To the South side of the cathedral there is a two-storey cloister originally built in the Middle Ages but greatly modified in the 16th-17th centuries. The ground floor is a typical Italian Renaissance work, built around 1539 by Francisco Cremona. The upper storey is a Mannerist gallery of the 17th century. The cloisters incorporate some Gothic chapels.

Rotuman mythology The island's potency is connected to the supposed founder of Rotuma, Raho. Legend maintains that Raho, a Samoan chief, after fleeing his home island, \\"planted\\" the island of Rotuma with two baskets of sand, and was subsequently tricked out of his newfound paradise by a Tongan chief named Tokaniua. In a fit of pique, Raho climbed up Rotuma's old volcano, Mamfiri, and dug a stick into its peak, the dirt flying off becoming the surrounding islets of Hafliua, Hatana, Hafhaveiaglolo, Solkope and the Haua islands. Thus, Raho left the main island of Rotuma and made his home on the island of Hatana, with a bevy of maidens. He is presumed to have died there, given that there is a site on the island referred to as his burial place. There remain two small boulders, said to resemble two crouching figures, marking the burial places of the sau he rua, Tuimanuka and Famafu. Around these stand 27 smaller rocks in a circle, supposedly symbolising the 27 sasina (maidens) whose deaths were mandated upon the death of the King, presumably to attend to him in the after world. There is a small umefe (eating table) upon which people have left gifts of garlands, coins, alcohol and any other offering deemed precious enough to appease the God-King and warrant safe passage on the return voyage. Geography Accessing the island of Hatana is a complicated process. Its landowners are the people of the village of Losa, district Itutiu, on the west coast of the main islad, and hence no one is allowed to land on the island without the permission of the Losa people, and must travel with a Losa villager in their party. Groups generally go to collect seabirds or their eggs, delicacies made all the more remarkable by the difficulty in process to procure them. However, groups do also go on day trips to visit the burial place of Raho, and picnic on the island. The island is surrounded by a perimeter of high reef that boats cannot breach, meaning that to reach the island, travellers must disembark from their vessels at the edge of the reef and either swim or run along the coral to the land at a distance of around 50 metres. This requires careful timing: should one embark on the run or swim at the wrong moment, they can find themselves struck against the reef or a rock by the large waves that pound against the sides of the island. Once on the island, given its sacred, taboo or haa status, there are various prohibitions which people cannot contravene. For example, visitors must not defile the island by relieving themselves on the land, and must do so into the sea. Also, any physical or even verbal act of insult, directed to the burial site, the ancestors associated with it or the people of Losa can cause the seas to become quite rough, and groups have been recorded as being stranded on the island for up to several days, until actions were taken to pacify the angry spirits.

The organisation is funded by community donations and is not affiliated with any political party. The organisation was originally known as the National Coalition for Gun Control which was established by Rebecca Peters. The current GCA was incorporated in NSW on 26 August 2013. Its Chair is Samantha Lee and Vice President Roland Browne. Both Samantha Lee and Roland Browne are lawyers who have volunteered in the area of gun control for over ten years.  History  There was a Gun Control Australia (GCA) based in Victoria that was formed by an activist named John Crook, who from the late 1970s wrote articles and made presentations challenging the basis of private ownership of firearms. In 1981, Mr Crook used the public concern from the killing of two girls in separate crimes in 1981, and with the support of the victims' parents formed \\"The Council to Control Gun Misuse\\". The group was strengthened after the spree killings in Hoddle Street and Queen Street in Melbourne, Australia, 1987. In 1988 after the Hoddle and Queen Street shootings a local group was formed under the aegis of Jack Renzenbrink to see what could be done. This group was augmented by John Crook who had been active in gun control ever since the Bacsa shooting, Jim Williams, a former shooter and Carolyn Worth, a woman's rights activist. Later on Roland Brown and Lee Rhiannon became involved. One result of these meetings was the publication of Gun Control Review (ISSN 1032-674x) in Ballarat by Jim Williams and Peter Baird. It ran to three issues and its recommendations foreshadowed the legislation implemented under John Howard. A trifold pamphlet entitled 'Gun Control: some questions and answers' was also produced. Currently Gun Control Australia receives donations from the public and is being funded by George Soros.  Activities  Samantha Lee has written various opinion pieces for the Sydney Morning Herald and the Guardian. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/04/with-our-own-gun-laws- eroding-australia-is-facing-a-concerning-future https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/australias-stringent-gun-laws-are-under- attack-20160427-gog5gr.html John Crook, has written or edited many articles and booklets, self-published under the banner of Gun Control Australia, the last in 2003. GCA maintains a website and occasionally features in media reports on gun law issues. At its height in the mid-1990s, its spokespersons were very prominent in media discussions and conferences on gun violence. A short-lived website claimed major public health and other associations as its members, but was removed about 1998. In 1996, Rebecca Peters, the then Chair of NCGC received the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's Community Human Rights award.  Membership  Prominent former members, who are no longer involved with NCGC or GCA, include Simon Chapman, who has published research on the effects of gun control laws, Rebecca Peters, who went on to work for IANSA, an international gun control NGO, and former co-chair and spokesperson Tim Costello.

It is endemic to North America. Etymology The subspecific name, edwardsii, is in honor of English ornithologist George Edwards, who described it, without giving it a binomial name, from a specimen he had received from William Bartram.Beltz, Ellin (2006). Scientific and Common Names of the Reptiles and Amphibians of North America ‚Äì Explained. http://ebeltz.net/herps/biogappx.html#EBeolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Gleanings of Natural History, exhibiting figures of Quadrupeds, Birds, Insects, Plants, &c; ... Part III. London: Royal College of Physicians. page 290. Description The Northern ringneck snake has a body color from bluish grey to black, with a complete narrow yellow or orange ring around its neck and an underside matching the ring and generally lacking any dark spotting or patterning. The complete ring and lack of large dark spots on the belly differentiate it from other subspecies of D. punctatus.Smith HM, Brodie ED Jr (1982). Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. New York: Golden Press. 240 pp. . (Diadophis punctatus edwardsi, pp. 160-161). In some regions, there are areas of intergradation with other subspecies. Generally from long as an adult, they can reach more than two feet (61 cm) in length.Conant R (1975). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. xviii + 429 pp. (hardcover), (paperback). (Diadophis punctatus edwardsi, p. 172 + Plate 25 + Map 133). Geographic range In Canada it is found in the southern parts of Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick, and also in Nova Scotia. In the United States it is found throughout New England, the Mid-Atlantic states, and the Great Lakes region, and also at higher elevations in the South. More specifically, it is found in the following: NE Alabama, Connecticut, NW Georgia, SE Illinois, S Indiana, Kentucky, W Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, NE Minnesota, N New Jersey, New York, W North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, extreme NW South Carolina, E Tennessee, W (western) Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Florida. Behavior The species is nocturnal and prone to hiding and traveling under rocks, fallen logs and leaf litter, so it is not commonly observed by people despite the potential abundant population density. (Another subspecies in Kansas was found to have densities of 700 to 1,800 per .) They are also social, and multiple ringnecks may be found in the same hiding spot during any season.Schmidt KP, Davis DD (1941). Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. 365 pp. (Diadophis punctatus edwardsii, pp. 111-112 + Plate 10, bottom). Habitat Their favored habitat over most of their range is a moist wooded area,Conant R, Bridges W (1939).

(Diadophis punctatus edwardsii, p. 36 + Plate 3, Figure 8). but they will also use the edges of wetlands or open areas in mountainous or hilly terrain. They are also often found in moist humid basements. Reproduction A female will lay her clutch of 2 to 10 eggs under a rock or in moist and rotting wood. Other female snakes may also use the same laying site, leading to single site egg finds of up to the mid fifties. The eggs hatch after about two months, and the young look essentially the same as the adults, possibly with a brighter color shade on the ring and belly. The eggs are long by wide, and the hatchlings are in total length.Wright AH, Wright AA (1957). Handbook of Snakes of the United States and Canada. Ithaca and London: Comstock. 1,105 pp. (in two volumes). (Diadophis punctatus edwardsi, pp. 185-190, Figure 59 + Map 20 on p. 179). Egg laying is normally in early summer and hatching in late summer. In the winter, these snakes hibernate, in locations from stone walls or cellars to small mammal burrows to brush piles or rotting logs. Diet These snakes prey upon insects, salamanders, earthworms, slugs, small lizards, small snakes, and frogs. The red backed salamander is a favorite food. Predation They are themselves known to be preyed upon by bullfrogs, toads, five species of predatory birds and six mammal species including shrews. Very young Northern ringneck snakes may also be eaten by large centipedes or large spiders. ReferencesFurther reading *Behler JL, King FW (1979).

It was dedicated in 1843 and destroyed by fire in 1892. Academic Hall's six Ionic columns, today known as The Columns, stand on Francis Quadrangle as the most recognizable symbol of the University of Missouri.  History  Academic Hall was built between 1840 and 1843 from plans drawn by Stephen Hills, designer of the first Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City (which only lasted from 1837 until burning in 1840). Academic Hall was dedicated in 1843. It consisted of a domed central section of three stories, with two wings that were added in 1885, and housed both educational and administrative facilities. Brick for the building was fired on campus and limestone for the Columns was obtained from the nearby Hinkson Creek Valley and was hauled to the building by ox-drawn carts.  Civil War  The cornerstone in Jesse Hall Rotunda The role of the University of Missouri in the American military began in 1862, during the American Civil War. Missouri was a border state, and Columbia was a town that had many citizens of southern ancestry, so the university area fell under the eye of the federal government. During the war, a number of different Federal regiments were stationed in Columbia and billeted in University buildings. Academic Hall was used to house soldiers, and Union troops interned Confederate prisoners in the main library on the third floor of Academic Hall. Classes were suspended for 10 months because of the troop occupation and because of loss of staff due to the conflict. During the Union occupation of the library, 467 volumes were taken to construct fires. The Union troops caused other destruction on campus as well, and the Board of Curators, with Congressman James S. Rollins as their representative, sued for damages. The U.S. government settled the case in 1915, the award was used to build the Memorial Gateway.  Fire of 1892  The destruction of Academic Hall by fire on Saturday evening, January 9, 1892 On Saturday evening January 9, 1892, Academic Hall fell victim to a disastrous fire, rumored to have been caused by the first electric light bulb west of the Mississippi River.Facilities Focus: MU power plant celebrates 75 years of history, progress The Athenaeum Society was to give an exhibition in the chapel of Academic Hall, and as the audience began to assemble, a small blaze appeared around the base of the central chandelier. A hole was immediately cut in the floor of the main library above, and water was turned on from the pressure system installed when the elevator was put in. The water supply was quickly exhausted without a significant effect on extinguishing the fire. The fire completely gutted the building by midnight, leaving little more than six stone Ionic columns standing. The fire even spread to the nearby president's residence, but it was extinguished without any significant damage to that structure. The collection in the main library was a total loss except those books that were checked out. The contents of the law library were partially salvaged. The wall of the museum was smashed in, and the exhibits were dragged out into the snow, including the controversial Emperor the elephant. A mural portrait of James S. Rollins, painted by George Caleb Bingham burned. Only the Columns remained in the rubble of the fire of 1892 After the fire, there was a campaign to move the University to Sedalia; however, Columbia was able to rally against the move. The columns, which still stand today, became a symbol of the campus and form the center of Francis Quadrangle, the oldest part of campus. In the next few months after the fire, many thought of the Columns as an eyesore that blocked the view of the new buildings being constructed on the Quadrangle. Some even feared that they were structurally unsound and a safety hazard. In August 1893, the Board of Curators issued a resolution that called for the Columns to be demolished \\"as soon as convenient.\\" A local paper reported that Gideon F. Rothwell had ordered two mule teams to tear down and haul off the Columns. A leading Columbia citizen by the name of Jerry S. Dorsey led a protest their removal, and stated \\"the Columns could not be pulled down by a herd of elephants.\\" Rothwell announced that they were coming down even if he had to dynamite them. Dorsey obtained a judicial writ that delayed the destruction of the Columns, and an architect soon declared that they would be structurally sound. The protest from Columbia citizens and the reassurance that the Columns did not pose a safety hazard led Rothwell and the other curators to have a change of heart in December 1893, and the Columns would remain.Y1.9K: Mizzou in 1900-2  References  Category:University of Missouri campus Category:Burned buildings and structures in the United States Category:Destroyed landmarks in the United States Category:Former buildings and structures in Missouri Category:Former buildings and structures in Columbia, Missouri Category:Landmarks in Missouri Category:History of Columbia, Missouri Category:University and college academic buildings in the United States Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1843 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1892 Category:Former National Register of Historic Places in Missouri Category:National Register of Historic Places in Boone County, Missouri Category:University and college buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Missouri Category:1843 establishments in Missouri Category:1892 disestablishments in Missouri Category:1840s architecture in the United States Category:Greek Revival architecture in Missouri Category:Neoclassical architecture in Missouri Category:Theatres in Columbia, Missouri ","title":"Academic Hall"},{"id":"17947951","text":"Vocolot is a contemporary Jewish women's a cappella ensemble based in California, USA. History Vocolot began in 1988, when singer-songwriter Linda Hirschhorn informally assembled a group of musicians to record some of the songs she had written for four- and five-part vocal harmonies. When they had finished recording those, for the Gather Round album, she asked the singers to join her in an ongoing group. The founding members were Rosalind Glazer, Max Ventura, Tay Holden and Linda Hirschhorn. Vocolot has gone through many incarnations as new members joined and prior members left to start families and pursue other careers. Besides the current members and the founders, there were Kirsten Zerger, Alisa Peres, Helen Cohen, Ellen Robinson, Gale Kissin, Judy Larson, Sharon Preves, Abbe Lyons, Naomi Hannah, Judith-Kate Friedman, Fran Avni, Jennifer Karno, Alison Lewis, Felicia Sloin, and Julia Bordenaro. Although Vocolot performs mostly a cappella, in the early 1990s they began incorporating percussion into some of their songs, with Helen Cohen, Gale Kissin, Ellen Robinson and Liz Stuart on doumbek and frame drums, and their song, \\"These Hands\\", integrates body percussion. They were the only American group to make it to the finals at the 2008 International Jewish Music Competition in Amsterdam. Musical style The group performs original compositions and arrangements of traditional Jewish, folk, and world-music songs in English, Hebrew, Yiddish, Ladino, and Arabic. Mixing folk, classical, cantorial and Jazz idioms in a polyphonic style of intricately interwoven voices, the women perform a cappella blended with hand drums and Body percussion. The ensemble has been compared to the group Sweet Honey in the Rock, Many of Vocolot's songs share themes of peace and justice, and Vocolot has sung at numerous rallies and fundraisers on behalf of women's empowerment organizations, MLK Day and Civil Rights events, El Salvador, Nicaragua, the homeless, women's shelters, Darfur, and at many anti-war demonstrations. In addition, they commonly perform at festivals, conferences and conventions, folk music clubs, Jewish community centers and federations, colleges and universities, churches and synagogues throughout the U.S.A. Name The name 'Vocolot' () is a bilingual pun on the English word 'vocal', and the Hebrew word ◊ß◊ï◊ú◊ï◊™ qolot , meaning \\"voices\\".

The island was given its present name at an event on July 4, 1881, at which several names were proposed; among the other names were Taghkannuc and Kellowanda. The Rutland County Historical Society published an account of the event including a number of speeches and poems, and shortly thereafter a series of \\"colored books of Neshobe\\" were published, containing a variety of poems in honor of the island. It became well known in the 1920s and 1930s for its association with the Algonquin Round Table. In 1924, Alexander Woollcott bought part of the island with six friends, and by the early 1930s he had purchased most of the island. He built himself a large stone house, where he hosted a number of other members of the circle during the 1930s; Woollcott himself lived permanently on the island from 1938.

Moggill pocket arterial road corridor The Kenmore Bypass is stage 1 of the planned Moggill Pocket Arterial Road corridor, also known as the Moggill‚ÄîWarrego Highway Connection, that connects the Centenary Highway, Fig Tree Pocket with the Warrego Highway, North Tivoli, via the suburbs of Kenmore, Pullenvale, Anstead and Karalee.Moggill Pocket Arterial Road/Moggill- Warrego Highway Connection, Preserved Transport Corridors, Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads, 21 December 2012 (accessed 1 January 2013) Benefits The proposed Bypass is designed to alleviate congestion along Moggil Road during peak commuting hours.Moggill Pocket Arterial Road/Moggill-Warrego Highway Connection, Queensland Department of Main Roads (accessed 1 January 2013) The Kenmore Bypass Pre-feasibility Study concluded that a Kenmore Bypass would: * Provide a alternative road for the congested Moggill Road; * Cater for an estimated of approximately 25,000 vehicles per day in 2026; * Reduce rat running; * Avoidance of two schools and two retail zones in Kenmore and 13 sets of traffic lights; * Improve public transport on Moggill Road and * Enhance bicycle commuting connectivity between the Kenmore and the Centenary Motorway cycleway.Kenmore Bypass Planning Study, Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads, 12 September 2012 (accessed 1 January 2013) Planning process The planning process, based on community feedback, looked at a range of options and more in-depth technical investigations. =Consultation= The Bypass has divided local residents and has been subject of extensive community planning to ensure the needs and opinions all residents are considered. The Kenmore Bypass Consultation report, that involved three stages and two additional interim consultation periods, received a total of 7,859 submissions between April 2008 and November 2009. The report highlighted the public issues regarding the Bypass, namely:Kenmore Bypass Planning Study * Supportive of project (Stage 1) ‚Äì 12.65%* * Opposed to project (Stage 1) ‚Äì 12.17%* * Existing traffic issues: congestion ‚Äì 7.22% * Alternatives: Bellbowrie Bridge ‚Äì 3.02% * Public transport ‚Äì 3% * Moggill Road ‚Äì 2.8% * Future traffic issues: congestion ‚Äì 2.49% * Moggill Road intersection: travel in direction of Brisbane City ‚Äì 2.07% * Existing traffic issues: Public transport ‚Äì 1.92% * Environment: Loss of greenspace ‚Äì 1.87% * ‚ÄòOther‚Äô issues accounted for 50.8% of the feedback received, including issues such as noise, land value and fauna. =Design= Design options have been published relating to: * Moggill Road Intersection (options A & B), * Gem Road to Kenmore Road and * Centenary Motorway Interchange (options A & B and Fig Tree Pocket A & B).Kenmore Bypass Planning Study, Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads, 12 September 2012 (accessed 1 January 2013) Current status The decision to proceed with the Kenmore Bypass rests with the Government of Queensland whose responsibility it is to assess the affordability and priority of the project. Currently there is no decision or funding to build a Kenmore Bypass.Kenmore Bypass Planning Study, Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads, 12 September 2012 (accessed 1 January 2013) The Moggill Pocket Arterial Road corridor, as determined by the Western Brisbane Transport Network Investigation, will not be required under the land use projections in the South East Queensland Regional Plan, but remains as an important future corridor.Moggill Pocket Arterial Road/Moggill-Warrego Highway Connection, Preserved Transport Corridors, Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads, 21 December 2012 (accessed 1 January 2013) See also *Road transport in Brisbane ReferencesExternal links * YouTube Video of the Kenmore Bypass Community Meeting - 12 June 2008 * Kenmore Bypass Planning Study * Debating Regional Transport Proposals - considers the Kenmore bypass option in a regional context * Outline on Google Maps of the Brisbane section Category:Proposed roads in Australia Category:Roads in Brisbane Category:Kenmore, Queensland Category:Bypasses ","title":"Kenmore Bypass"},{"id":"17948122","text":"Hot Air Balloon is a rock opera written in 1998 by Jon Gutwillig, guitarist and founding member of The Disco Biscuits, a Philadelphia based trance fusion jam band.

He was convinced by Morris Mulberry that the idea could be profitable and that the two of them should start a service shuttling people across the sea in hot air balloons. The business, called Hot Air Balloon Traveling, became successful and attracted the attention of Manilla Trane, the entrepreneur whose capital ran much of the town. Corrinado refused to sell Hot Air Balloon Traveling, and even worse, kindles a romance with Manilla's beautiful wife, Leora of the Sequoias. Manilla forcibly overtook the business and had Corrinado arrested and sentenced for building \\"the devil's flying machine.\\" = Leora of the Sequioas = The young trophy wife of Manilla Trane, known throughout town as a terrific chef. She earned her nickname because of her height as well as the size of her hair, which, according to the townspeople, looked as if were held up by branches. Lack of attention from her husband turned her into an insomniac, and she was often seen late at night staring out the window of the high tower of Manilla's fortress. = Manilla Trane = Extraordinarily wealthy entrepreneur whose riches allows him to control the entire town. As a young man, he began to amass his fortune by peddling weapons. He possesses a small army of extremely loyal men who will do his every whim. An avid arts collector, he married Leora of the Sequoias on the steps of his brand new museum. He is known as an extremely demanding and unforgiving tyrant. = Morris Mulberry = A somewhat conniving, albeit benevolent, street hustler. He convinced Corrinado that the two of them could start a highly successful business by using Corrinado‚Äôs hot air balloon invention to shuttle people across the sea. He mysteriously vanished one month after Hot Air Balloon Travelling was destroyed and Corrinado was arrested. = Diamond Riggs = A well known loan-shark and old street friend of Morris Mulberry. He put up the initial capital to start Hot Air Balloon Traveling. A very aloof individual who, according to town rumor, possessed the prototype hot air balloon, which he was given as collateral for his initial investment.  Act I Scene I - The Overture= High noon - townsfolk fill the center square for lunch. There is much commotion. Horse-drawn carriages line the outer streets. Merchants are yelling their pitches into the crowd. Street performers are miming and dancing in front of onlookers. The echoing sound of the street charmer's horn can be heard ricocheting off of the buildings. =Scene II - Once the Fiddler Paid= Corrinado sits alone in his prison cell, staring out the tiny barred window, over the jagged cliffs, and out to the sea beyond. The noon sun is high, the sky is clear and a comfortable summer wind blows through his cell. He thinks about Leora, his lost loved one, and he is plagued by the haunting vision of his fate. =Scene III - The Very Moon= The scene moves to Manilla's estate, before the arrest of Corrinado. We catch a glimpse of the relationship between Manilla and Leora. Manilla has reaped the rewards of many successful business enterprises. He works too hard to pay attention to his wife Leora, needing her only as a chef. Manilla invites Corrinado and Mulberry over for dinner in order to discuss the proposition of buying Hot Air Balloon Traveling. Corrinado and Mulberry are not willing to part with the business. As the scene ends, it becomes clear that Corrinado and Leora are enamored with one another, leaving Leora wondering whether Corrinado is the man to fly her far, far away. =Scene IV - Voices Insane= The scene shifts back to Corrinado's jail cell, the night before he is to be burned at the stake. Starved and beaten, he has given in to the demons which are living in his mind. He knows that there is little chance to escape his fate, yet he dares the audience to condemn him for what he has done. Half-crazy, he sits alone in his cell dreaming of Leora, laughing aloud at the world which had condemned him. =Scene V - Eulogy= The prison guards come to take Corrinado away to be executed. He walks defiantly through the crowd as they taunt and jeer at him. He remains calm and seems completely unmoved. His gaze is fixed on the sky. Act IIScene I - Bazaar Escape= Corrinado is strapped to a pole in the center of town. Manilla's troops are preparing the fire. Leora has arranged for his feet to be left untied. At the last moment, he pulls on his ropes with all his might, tearing himself free. He charges into the town bazaar as Manilla's troops pursue. His only chance of escaping is to make for the cliffs and jump into the sea. With a hoard of troops on his heels, he swan dives off the cliff into the sea far below. =Scene II - Mulberry's Dream= Corrinado swims through the sea, his only chance of survival is to make it to the island; hoping that Morris Mulberry will be waiting with the prototype hot air balloon, the only one left undestroyed by Manilla. As he swims, he gets delirious from pure physical exhaustion. He thinks back to his friend Mulberry and the beginning of Hot Air Balloon Traveling when Mulberry persuaded him to use his invention to start a successful business. =Scene III - Above the Waves= Mulberry stands alone on the island with the hot air balloon engine burning. He waits all night in hopes that Corrinado will make it. Eventually, he starts to despair, realizing that even if Corinado managed to escape his execution, there is no way that he could make the long swim across the ocean. He gives up all hope of Corrinado's survival, puts out the balloon engine, and sits there in the darkness. Out of the darkness, he hears someone shouting his name in a faint voice. He looks out but still he sees nothing. He thinks that his mind is playing tricks on him, and decides that it is time to move on and start his life anew. He is about to leave when Corrinado's soaking wet figure emerges from the darkness. =Scene IV - Hot Air Balloon= Corrinado embraces Mulberry. He stares in awe at the hot air balloon. The fantastic pipe dream that had become his greatest joy had also led to his persecution. He starts up the engine and takes off, flying over the sea to rescue his beloved Leora. Leora waits lying by the sea on the beach. She frets about whether or not Corrinado has survived. As dawn approaches, she sees a speck on the horizon: Corrinado has arrived. He sets his balloon down on the shore, and Leora climbs in with him. They take off together, never to be seen by anyone again, flying off into the sunrise.

The twelfth child of Bernard and Marie Mahler, Otto was born in Jihlava and resembled his elder brother Gustav Mahler in displaying a special talent for music at an early age. Gustav Mahler was already Director of the Royal Opera in Budapest when Otto Mahler entered the Vienna Conservatory in 1888 at the age of 15. Natalie Bauer-Lechner's memoirs describe Otto as having been \\"liberated from his father's business\\" by Gustav‚Äîwho became head of the family, and financially responsible for Otto, upon the deaths of Bernard and Marie in 1889. Commentary on Otto's life tends to assert that he was a talented student. He appears to have been less diligent than his brother had been, however. After a few successful terms studying harmony and counterpoint with Anton Bruckner and piano with Ernst Ludwig, his marks declined, and the annual report for his first year shows that for some reason he took no final examination in composition. From that point on his academic performance was increasingly poor, and in April 1892, Otto Mahler left the Conservatory without a diploma. With the help of his brother, Otto was able to find minor musical posts in provincial towns. He seldom stayed long in any place, however. In the autumn of 1893, he took on a position as choirmaster and second conductor of the Leipzig Opera. After moving to a position in Bremen, he returned to Vienna. It was in Vienna on 6 February 1895, that Otto shot himself with a revolver while in the house of his and Mahler's friend Nina Hoffmann-Matscheko. His motivation remains unknown, though the 'Illustrierte Wiener Extrablatt' speculated about a 'matter of the heart'. According to Gustav's widow Alma, Otto's suicide-note stated that life no longer pleased him, so he 'handed back his ticket'. Otto Mahler's music remains unpublished and is apparently uncatalogued. No recent performances are known; indeed, the very survival of the scores is currently uncertain. At the time of his death, Otto was in possession of an autograph of the first three movements of Anton Bruckner's Third Symphony; this, along with certain of his other effects, passed into the hands of his brother Gustav (apparently in a locked trunk that Gustav never opened), and thence to the collection of his widow Alma. The bulky Bruckner manuscript was one of the very few possessions carried in her backpack during her daring 1940 escape over the Pyrenees with her third husband, writer Franz Werfel, avoiding Vichy France border patrols. Works According to Bruno Walter, Otto Mahler left two symphonies, parts of which had been played and \\"ridiculed\\" by the public, and an almost-complete Third Symphony, in addition to some lieder with orchestra and piano.

The station is owned by Twilight Broadcasting, which completed acquisition of it in 2019 from Connoisseur Media. It is simulcasting WEEU in Reading, Pennsylvania, which was also acquired by Twilight in 2018. The stations carry a mix of locally-produced and syndicated programming, with specialty music shows on weekends, plus live sports including the Philadelphia Phillies and 76ers. Under former owners Connoisseur it broadcast a sports format and featured programming from ESPN Radio. Before that, until 2016, it carried religious and inspirational programming. WBYN while under Connoisseur was for a time inactive, after having reported to the FCC through its licenseholder's attorney the theft of copper radials and ground system of the station's transmitter as of March 4, 2018. In June 2019 the station returned to the air. History The station was signed-on in 1962 by Martin Phillip under the call letters WYNS (pronounced wins). Phillip sold the station to Ragan Henry in 2000. Following financial losses, Henry took WYNS off-the-air on December 31, 2002; in 2003, he sold WYNS to Nassau Broadcasting Partners. Following the sale, the station, which had been an oldies station, began carrying sports radio programming from ESPN Radio, simulcast from sister station WEEX in Easton, PA. (WYNS had abandoned the oldies format in 1998 in favor of country music, but subsequently reversed that change.) In 2005, WBYN, a co-located Christian FM station was leased in an LMA to Nassau, with plans to eventually purchase that FM station. The call letters were changed to the current WBYN on September 25, 2005, when the station started simulcasting WBYN-FM. The simulcast continued until the winter of 2006 when the FM station changed formats to an Adult Rock Hits format called Frank FM and call signs to WFKB. WBYN's religious format remained on AM 1160 and on WFKB-FM HD-2. Nassau continued to manage WFKB with plans to acquire it. After being unable to negotiate a purchase of WFKB or extend the LMA, WDAC Radio took back operations of WFKB on March 15, 2009. On March 31, 2009, WFKB dropped the Adult Rock Hits format, reverted to a religious format, and reverted to WBYN-FM calls. The religious format on WBYN-FM, while similar to WBYN, was different programming. WBYN-FM focused more on national features, plays more music, while WBYN-AM focused more on talk and teaching, with some shows coming from Salem Media. WBYN-FM is still owned by Nassau and is programmed from Princeton, New Jersey much of the same content as co-owned WCHR. The station, along with nine other Nassau stations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, was purchased at bankruptcy auction by NB Broadcasting in May 2012. NB Broadcasting is controlled by Nassau's creditors ‚Äî Goldman Sachs, Pluss Enterprises, and P.E. Capital. In November, NB Broadcasting filed a motion to assign its rights to the stations to Connoisseur Media. The sale to Connoisseur Media, at a price of $38.7 million, was consummated on May 29, 2013. On January 4, 2016 WBYN changed their format back to a simulcast of WEEX. In August 2019, WBYN began a simulcast of WEEU-AM in Reading, pending its acquisition by Twilight which was finalized in November 2019.

It is the oldest part of Darwin and includes many of the city's important institutions and landmarks, such as Parliament, Government House, the Northern Territory Supreme Court, Bicentennial Park and the George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens. The city centre is located in the local government areas of the City of Darwin and the Darwin Waterfront Precinct. Although the city centre is one of the most developed areas of Darwin, demographically it is one of the less densely populated, due to its core being commercial. History The first British person to see Darwin harbour appears to have been Lieutenant John Lort Stokes of HMS Beagle on 9 September 1839. The ship's captain, Commander John Clements Wickham, named the port after Charles Darwin, the British naturalist who had sailed with them both on the earlier second expedition of the Beagle. In the early 1870s, Darwin felt the effects of a gold rush at Pine Creek after employees of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line found gold while digging holes for telegraph poles. On 5 February 1869, George Goyder, the Surveyor General of South Australia, established a small settlement of 135 people at Port Darwin. Goyder named the settlement Palmerston, after the British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston. In 1870, the first poles for the Overland Telegraph were erected in Darwin, connecting Australia to the rest of the world. The discovery of gold at Pine Creek in the 1880s further boosted the young territory's development. Upon Commonwealth administration in 1911, Darwin became the city's official name. Darwin waterfront and CBD Geography The city centre is bordered by Daly Street to the north and extends east to the Stuart Highway McMinn Street to the east which borders Stuart Park.

In riot control The snatch squad in riot control involves several police officers, usually wearing protective riot gear, rushing forwards‚Äîoccasionally in a flying wedge formation‚Äîto break through the front of a crowd, with the objective of snatching one or more individuals from a riot that are attempting to control the demonstration at which they are present. The target may be a leader or a speaker, or someone who seems to be leading the crowd. In one British form of the tactic, three or four officers rush at a group of violent or disorderly people, with two of the officers carrying batons and the others a shield. The officer with the shield rushes the most violent in the group and forces the subject between the shield and a fixed object, while the other officers either arrest the others or escort them out of the crowds. Plainclothes snatch squads A snatch squad may also refer to plainclothes police officers apprehending individuals, often in a looting situation. Often the plainclothes police officers will mingle with crowds intent on causing trouble and appear to be a bystander. The undercover officers can arrest any individual attempting to break or loot a store, often in an isolated scenario with few crowds as not to provoke an attack on the officers. Snatch squads are also employed against violent fugitives when they are otherwise likely to barricade themselves or use force in a search warrant setting.

He is a Distinguished Professor at Brooklyn College at the City University of New York (CUNY). Research Parikh's catholic attitude towards logic has led to work on topics like vagueness, ultrafinitism, belief revision, logic of knowledge, game theory and social software (social procedure). This last area seeks to combine techniques from logic, computer science (especially logic of programs) and game theory to understand the structure of social algorithms. Examples of such are elections, transport systems, lectures, conferences, and monetary systems, all of which have properties of interest to those who are logically inclined. Parikh's theorem, stating that regular languages and context-free languages have the same sets of letter frequency vectors, is named after him. Among his other contributions is the introduction of bounded arithmetic and the logic of games. Personal life and politics Rohit Parikh was married from 1968 to 1994 to Carol Parikh (n√©e Geris), who is best known for her prize-winning stories and for her influential biography of Oscar Zariski, The Unreal Life of Oscar Zariski. They have two children, Vikram (born 1969) and Uma (born 1974). In 2018, a Facebook post by Parikh, calling for deportation of all illegal immigrants, writing, ‚ÄúI do believe that everyone who is illegally here should be deported but that the US should support them in their home country.‚Äù Parikh further claims in the Facebook post that Hispanic immigrants are insufficiently educated compared to Indian immigrants like him, leading Brooklyn College students to public protests and calls for the university to discipline him. The president of Brooklyn College Michelle Anderson called his remarks \\"antithetical to the fundamental values of Brooklyn College.\\" Defending his position in an interview to a CW-affiliate WPIX, Parikh claimed he had not meant that Hispanics in general were dumber than Indians in general, but rather that his comparison of intellectual abilities of Hispanics and Indians had applied only to those who had immigrated to the United States. \\"There are a lot of stupid people in India but they don't come here,\\" he explained.

Biography  He studied astronomy and physics at the University of Dorpat, and furthered his education of physics in Paris in the laboratories of Antoine C√©sar Becquerel (1788‚Äì1878) and Henri Victor R√©gnault (1810‚Äì1878), and afterwards at Berlin in the laboratories of Heinrich Gustav Magnus (1802‚Äì1870), Johann Christian Poggendorff (1796‚Äì1877) and Heinrich Wilhelm Dove (1803‚Äì1879). In 1868 he became a professor at Dorpat, where he founded a meteorological observatory. In 1893 he moved to the University of Leipzig, where he remained until 1919 as a teacher and honorary professor. In 1898 and 1904 he published the third and fourth volumes of Poggendorff's Biographisch- Literarisches Handw√∂rterbuch der exakten Naturwissenschaften.

He was a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and represented the Division of Hotham in federal parliament from 1980 to 1990. He was born in Yugoslavia and came to Australia via Israel after the Second World War. Early life Kent was born on 8 September 1927 in Subotica, Yugoslavia, in present-day Serbia. His birth name was Lajco Kapolnai, which he later anglicised. Of Jewish origin, he grew up in the town of Sombor, where all but five of his high school classmates were killed when the Axis powers invaded in 1941. He recalled seeing \\"Hungarian troops blow a retired teacher's brains out with a grenade as the teacher answered a call at his front door\\". He later narrowly escaped being captured by the SS, and due to curfews and bombings was unable to continue assisting an elderly relative, who starved to death. Kent and his cousin escaped to Hungary towards the end of the war, where they received false identity papers that listed them as Hungarian nationals. They were treated as such by the Soviet Army, which made them participate in an 11-day forced march to a prison camp. His cousin died of typhoid in the camp, but he was able to escape after a few months and made his way to Belgrade. He had difficulties in post-war Yugoslavia and eventually left for Israel, where he joined the Israeli Communist Party and stood unsuccessfully for public office. Move to Australia After moving to Australia, Kent worked on the railways for 26 years and attained the rank of stationmaster. He joined the Australian Labor Party (Victorian Branch) and in the late 1960s served as president of the party's New Australian Committee. He expressed concerns that the party's platform was still sympathetic to the White Australia policy and called for non-discriminatory immigration to be made an explicit policy plank. Kent also served as chairman of the Yugoslav Welfare Society. In December 1977, he attributed the bombing of the Jat Airways offices in Melbourne to Croatian separatists in the Usta≈°e. He warned of possible inter-ethnic violence if the police did not intervene, stating \\"ninety percent of Croats are good citizens but a small percentage are terrorist types\\". Parliament Kent was elected to parliament at the 1980 federal election, defeating the incumbent Liberal member Roger Johnston in the Division of Hotham.Lyle Allan (1985), 'Ethnic Politics in the ALP,' in P.R.Hay, J. Halligan, J.Warhurst and B.Costar (eds.), Essays on Victorian Politics, Warrnambool Institute Press, Warrnambool, Victoria, page 141. He was re-elected at the 1983, 1984 and 1987 elections. He served on several parliamentary committees and joined a number of parliamentary delegations to other countries. Kent was a member of the Labor Left faction and came into conflict with the Hawke Government on a number of occasions. In 1986, he walked out of Paul Keating's budget speech, along with Peter Milton and John Scott, when it was announced that the government would resume uranium sales to France. During the debate over the introduction of the Australia Card, Kent said that it was un-Australian and that it would be more appropriate to call it a Hitlercard or Stalincard. In November 1989, Liberal MPs Ken Aldred and Jim Short alleged that Kent was \\"an agent of a foreign power\\" and had ties to the UDBA, the Yugoslav secret police. Their allegations were based on a statutory declaration from a member of Melbourne's Yugoslav community. Kent vigorously denied their claims, describing them as a smear campaign. He was suspended from parliament for 24 hours for using unparliamentary language. The House of Representatives later voted on party lines to suspend Aldred for two days, following a report from the privileges committee. Kent's political career ended at the 1990 federal election, when he attempted to transfer to the newly created Division of Corinella. He was defeated by the Liberal candidate Russell Broadbent.

Known as the host of the annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, Caras was the author of more than 70 books, a veteran of network television programs including Nightline, ABC World News Tonight and 20/20 before devoting himself to work as president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. \\"Animals are not our whole life, but they make our lives whole\\" -Roger Caras  Biography  Early life and education = Born May 24, 1928, in the rural town of Methuen, Massachusetts, Caras was raised in a family that encouraged love of animals. His parents allowed him to foster a menagerie of pets, and during the Depression he went to work at the age of 10 to help pay for his pets' upkeep. His first job, working in the stables of an SPCA shelter, was his first experience with animal rescue in the shelter's haven for abused horses. He completed his education at Boston's Huntington Preparatory School and immediately enlisted in the U.S. Army near the end of World War II. Caras returned to Boston after his tour of duty and then enrolled as a zoology major at Northwestern University. In 1950, he transferred to Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, but interrupted his education for military service again, this time in the Korean War from 1950 to 1952. = Career = Caras returned to civilian life as a West Coast resident, attending the University of Southern California, where he earned a degree, not in zoology but in cinema, and stepped from academic life to executive-level work in the motion picture industry. During 15 years in the film world, Caras held a number of assignments, including serving as press secretary for actress Joan Crawford, and from 1965 to 1969 as vice president of Stanley Kubrick's production company, Hawk Films, working with Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke on the science fiction epic 2001: A Space Odyssey. During his Hollywood years, Caras also launched his writing career, contributing articles on animal and environmental issues to such periodicals as \\"Audubon\\" and publishing his first book, \\"Antarctica: Land of Frozen Time,‚Äù in 1962. In 1964, Caras made his broadcasting debut on the NBC News program The Today Show, spending nearly a decade as the program's \\"house naturalist.\\" His skills in broadcasting, research, biology, and zoology led to his acceptance as one of the media's best-regarded animal authorities. He was sought out by the Walt Disney conglomerate as a consultant on their Florida Animal Kingdom park. Acting as a special correspondent, Caras reported from around the globe on a variety of animal and environmental issues that ranged from exposes on laboratory animals to the plight of the endangered Giant Panda in China and to investigation of the black market commerce in exotic animals and poaching. Caras spent from 1975 to 1992 as a regularly featured reporter on ABC Evening News (later World News Tonight with Peter Jennings,) as well as contributing to Nightline, 20/20, and Good Morning America. He also hosted radio programs, including Pets and Wildlife on CBS, Report from the World of Animals on NBC, and the ABC series The Living World. Caras won an Emmy Award for his reporting. His books include The Bond and his last book, Going for the Blue: Inside the World of Show Dogs and Dog Shows, which was published in time for the 2001 Westminster competition. Caras‚Äôs work with and on behalf of animals led to his 1991 election as the 14th president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the oldest humane-treatment-of-animals organization in the United States. During his tenure, the ASPCA expanded its care, protection and education programs, and adopted a number of internal practices to improve its work. Caras retired in 1999 and became president emeritus, acting as a consultant and public speaker for the organization. = Death and afterward = Caras made his home in Freeland, Baltimore County, Maryland, where he and his wife, Jill Langdon Barclay, maintained a farm that became home for a variety of animals. In 2001, in the last year of his life, Caras shared his farm with 12 dogs (7 Greyhounds, 3 retrievers and 2 hounds), nine cats, all of mixed origin, five horses, two cows, a pair of alpacas and a llama. After his death, his wife, his son, Dr. Barclay Caras, and daughter, Pamela Caras, requested that people wishing to honor his memory donate memorial contributions to the ASPCA in his name.

History In March 1983 while in New York City, Peninsula Players‚Äô Tony award-winning producer, James B. McKenzie hired actor/writer Richard O'Donnell to create, develop and act in the Comedy Cabaret (a proposed after-show review) scheduled to premiere in the forthcoming summer‚Äôs upcoming season at Door County‚Äôs Peninsula Players Theater in Fish Creek, Wisconsin. The Comedy Cabaret, produced by Amy McKenzie, was so successful in its first season that it returned to Door County the following summer as New Age Vaudeville, in its own 100-seat theatre at the nearby Glidden Lodge in Baileys Harbor. Following the initial season at The Peninsula Players Richard O‚ÄôDonnell and Amy McKenzie took their troupe to Chicago for the winter, establishing themselves at CrossCurrents, in their new 100 seat Art Deco theatre located at 3206 N. Wilson. Throughout its 4-year run, O'Donnell co-produced and wrote while McKenzie co-produced and directed numerous productions starring themselves and actors Megan Cavanagh, Todd Erickson, Bobby McGuire, Peter Neville, Michael Dempsey, Caroline Schless, Lisa Keefe, Tom Purcell (head writer, Colbert Report and Executive Producer Late Night with Stephen Colbert), and Del Close.

Sensitivity to oats can manifest as a result of allergy to oat seed storage proteins either inhaled or ingested. A more complex condition affects individuals who have gluten-sensitive enteropathy in which there is an autoimmune response to avenin, the glutinous protein in oats similar to the gluten within wheat. Sensitivity to oat foods can also result from their frequent contamination by wheat, barley, or rye particles. Oat allergy Studies on farmers with grain dust allergy and children with atopy dermatitis reveal that oat proteins can act as both respiratory and skin allergens. Oat dust sensitivity in farms found 53% showed reactivity to dust, second only to barley (70%), and almost double that of wheat dust. The 66 kDa protein in oats was visualized by 28 out of 33 sera (84%). However, there was evident non- specific binding to this region and thus it may also represent lectin-like binding. IgA and IgG responses, meanwhile, like those seen to anti-gliadin antibodies in celiac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis, are not seen in response to avenins in atopic dermatitis patients. Food allergies to oats can accompany atopy dermatitis. Oat avenins share similarities with Œ≥ and œâ-gliadins of wheat ‚Äî based on these similarities they could potentiate both enteropathic response and anaphylactic responses. Oat allergy in gluten- sensitive enteropathy can explain an avenin-sensitive individual with no histological abnormality, no T-cell reaction to avenin, bearing the rarer DQ2.5trans phenotype, and with anaphylactic reaction to avenin. Avenin- sensitive enteropathy Oat toxicity in people with gluten-related disorders depends on the oat cultivar consumed because the immunoreactivities of toxic prolamins are different among oat varieties. Furthermore, oats are frequently cross-contaminated with the other gluten-containing cereals. Pure oat (labelled as \\"pure oat\\" or \\"gluten-free oat\\") refers to oats uncontaminated with any of the other gluten-containing cereals. Some cultivars of pure oat could be a safe part of a gluten-free diet, requiring knowledge of the oat variety used in food products for a gluten-free diet. Nevertheless, the long- term effects of pure oats consumption are still unclear and further studies identifying the cultivars used are needed before making final recommendations on their inclusion in the gluten-free diet. =Immunological evidence= Anti-avenin antibodies In 1992, six proteins were extracted from oats that reacted with a single coeliac sera. Three of the proteins were prolamins, and have been called CIP 1 (gamma avenin), CIP 2, and CIP3. They had the following amino acid sequences: Antibody recognition sites on three avenins CIP1 (Œ≥-avenin) P S E Q Y Q P Y P E Q Q Q P F CIP2 (Œ≥-avenin) T T T V Q Y D P S E Q Y Q P Y P E Q Q Q P F V Q Q Q P P F CIP3 (Œ±-avenin) T T T V Q Y N P S E Q Y Q P Y Within the same study, three other proteins were identified, one of them an Œ±-amylase inhibitor as identified by protein homology. A follow-up study showed that most celiacs have anti-avenin antibodies (AVAs), with a specificity and sensitivity comparable to anti-gliadin antibodies. A subsequent study found that these AVAs did not result from cross-reaction with wheat. However, recently it has been found that AVAs drop as soon as Triticeae glutens are removed from the diet. Anti-avenin antibodies declined in treated celiacs on an oat diet in 136 individuals, suggesting oats can be involved in celiac disease when wheat is present, but are not involved when wheat is removed from the diet. The study, however, did find an increased number of patients with higher intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs, a type of white bloodcell) in the oat-eating cohort. Regardless of whether or not this observation is a direct allergic immune response, by itself this is essentially benign. Cellular immunity In gluten-sensitive enteropathy, prolamins mediate between T-cells and antigen-presenting cells, whereas anti- transglutaminase antibodies confer autoimmunity via covalent attachment to gliadin. In 16 examined coeliacs, none produced a significant Th1 response. Th1 responses are needed to stimulate T-helper cells that mediate disease. This could indicate that coeliac disease does not directly involve avenin or that the sample size was too small to detect the occasional responder. Evidence that there are exceptional cases came in a 2004 study on oats. The patients drafted for this study were those who had symptoms of celiac disease when on a \\"pure-oat\\" challenge, therefore not representative of a celiac sample. This study found that four patients had symptoms after oat ingestion, and three had elevated Marsh scores for histology and avenin responsive T-cells, indicating avenin-sensitive enteropathy (ASE). All three patients were the DQ2.5/DQ2 (HLA DR3-DQ2/DR7-DQ2) phenotype. Patients with DQ2.5/DQ2.2 tend to be the most prone toward gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE), have the highest risk for GS-EATL, and shows signs of more severe disease at diagnosis. While the DQ2.5/DQ2 phenotype represents only 25% of celiac patients, it accounts for all of the ASE celiacs, and 60-70% of patients with GS-EATL. Synthetic avenin peptides were synthesized either in native or deamidated form, and the deamidated peptides showed higher response. DQ2.5/T-cell receptor recognition from 2 Oat-sensitive coeliacs TCR-Site1 Y Q P Y P E Q E~E~P F V TCR-Site2 Q Y Q P Y P E Q Q Q P F V Q Q Q Q Antibody recognition site(see above) CIP2 (Œ≥-avenin) T T T V Q Y D P S E Q Y Q P Y P E Q Q Q P F V Q Q Q P P F The overlap of the antibody and T-cell sites, given trypsin digestion of avenin, suggest this region is dominant in immunity. The TCR- site1 was synthetically made as deamidated (\\"~E~\\"), and native peptide requires transglutaminase to reach full activation. Two studies to date have looked at the ability of different oat strains to promote various immunochemical aspects of celiac disease. While preliminary, these studies indicate different strains may have different risks for avenin sensitivity.

Meier and Frank was for many years the largest department store west of the Mississippi, so owning and operating a radio station located at the department store building was viewed as an appropriate public service and promotional venture for the store. In 1929, Meier and Frank decided to sell KFEC to Carl E. Haymond, who moved the station to Yakima,\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, April 30, 1929, page 12. which did not have a radio station at this time. The call letters were changed to KIT on March 22, 1929,\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, March 30, 1929, page 13. and the station left the air in Portland and signed on in Yakima, the next month.Kramer, Ronald, Pioneer Mikes: A History of Radio and Television in Oregon, Western States Museum of Broadcasting, Ashland, Oregon, 2009\\"New Yakima Station Makes Bow Tomorrow\\", Spokane Daily Chronicle, April 4, 1929, page 12. In December, KIT began broadcasting on 1310 kHz with 500 watts.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 31, 1930, page 9. In 1937 it switched to 1250 kHz so it could increase power. On March 28, 1941 it moved to its present frequency of 1280 kHz as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement. An early children's program on KIT was \\"Uncle Jimmy's Clubhouse,\\" hosted by James \\"Jimmy\\" Nolan, and the news was edited for many years by Pete Wick. During the 1940s and 1950s, KIT's Chief Engineer was Ben Murphy. During the 1950s, a late night disk jockey host was Joe Young, whose program was appropriately entitled \\"La Casa Jose'\\" (The House Of Joe). In November 1926, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) was incorporated. One of the first NBC programs to reach the west coast was the broadcast of the 1927 Rose Bowl Game from Pasadena, California, with announcer, Graham McNamee. By joining the NBC Radio Network in 1931, KIT had the advantage of associating itself with the network's vast entertainment and news resources. As the years progressed into the 1930s and 1940s, NBC's and KIT's programming improved. The network was owned by its parent company, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), which also owned the Keith - Albee - Orpheum vaudeville circuit, later renamed Radio - Keith - Orpheum (RKO). RKO handled many vaudeville comedians that were ideally suited for radio. Some of them were Jack Benny, Burns and Allen, Fred Allen, Eddie Cantor, and Fanny Brice, among others. During the depression of the 1930s, many people could not even afford the admission price of a movie ticket, but they could afford to purchase a radio where they could listen to free entertainment, interspersed with commercial announcements. Being a dirt farmer during the depression, which required sweating, plowing, and staring at the rear end of a horse all day, and after cleaning up and after eating dinner, what a pleasure it was to sit down and relax, and to listen to KIT and the great radio comedians, and for free. And since, at the time, there were no FM or television broadcasts, no Internet, no CD players, no IPods, and the like, AM radio was king, and KIT was there, right in the middle of it. During the dark days of World War II, KIT was there to provide air raid and black out warnings. It was believed that an attack on the west coast of the United States was imminent, so people were warned to turn off their lights, and drape black cloths over their windows, so the expected bombers would see nothing but blackness. Periodically, KIT, and the other Central Washington radio stations, would go off of the air so the bombers could not use the signals to pinpoint their bomb dropping locations, as they did at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in his \\"Fireside Chats,\\" broadcast from the White House in Washington D.C., used NBC and KIT to reassure the public that everything was safe and under control. People were literally glued to their radio receivers and KIT during this time to get news, any news, no matter how small, concerning the outcome of the war, the safety of themselves, their families, and their country. Following World War Two, the homecoming G.I.s infused a spark of life and prosperity into the U.S. economy. In 1942, under the provisions of the Sherman Antitrust Act, NBC was required to divest itself of its Blue Network, which later became The Blue Network Incorporated, and later The American Broadcasting Company. As a result of this divestiture and a booming economy, more money was available to NBC to develop better, higher quality programming. In the 1940s, NBC was known as the network of the radio comedians, which gave it the distinction of being the network with the largest listener base. KIT, being an NBC Radio Network affiliate, also shared in this wide listening audience. If one wanted to hear the great radio comedians in Central Washington State, they listened to KIT. As the years continued into the 1950s, television began to cut inroads into radio advertising revenues and sponsors began the gradual migration from radio to television. As a result, less money was available to support quality network entertainment programming. Gradually, NBC, and the other radio networks, began dropping large budget entertainment programs in favor of news and information programming. \\"NBC News On The Hour,\\" and \\"Emphasis,\\" became the network staples as entertainment programs were slowly phased out. NBC radio affiliates, including KIT, had the tough decision to eventually lessen, or completely eliminate, their network connections in order to maintain their profit structures. At that time, KIT became a disk jockey station, that is, live hosts playing phonograph records on the air. Later, when music licensing fees became too difficult to maintain, KIT became a news and information outlet. At one time, KIT possessed a permit from the Federal Communications Commission to construct a television station in Yakima, but, since another station was already being built at the time, the decision was made not to move forward. On May 18, 1980, Mt. St. Helen's erupted. The City of Yakima was in direct line with the prevailing winds that morning at 8:32 when the first eruption occurred. In the hours that followed, the massive cloud of smoke and ash blanketed the entire area headed in a north-easterly direction. About 2-3 inches of heavy ash fell on the area causing a widespread problem of dust, making vehicle travel on the roads come to virtually a stand still. Street lights came on it was so dark, the ability to see was down to inches rather than feet. A wide variety of problems surfaced, and the radio station became a news and information clearing house. At the time the mountain erupted, the lone staff member at the station, Ken Rink, discontinued normal programming and switched to a news/talk format which is what the station does today. He provided news and information while soliciting officials and the community to call the station with eye witness reports. Participants were put on the air live, and within a matter of minutes, that format was used over the next 5 days without commercials. By 10:00 that morning, the cloud of smoke and ash had covered the area. News and information was coming in at rapid rate. Many people had concerns, questions, and announcements. Some of the station's other staff began to arrive a short time later. In the hours that followed, the experienced staff had established 2 other broadcast rooms to provide support to the main control room with regard to incoming news, interviews, recordings, editing, and production. Some of the staff answered phones and screened incoming calls. Officials were able to get through and were put on the air immediately. The station later earned an award for its leadership role in the emergency. At that time, the station was owned by Jack Goetz. The news director was Al Bell. Other on-air staff who participated included Brian Teegarden, Dave Hansen and Derek Allen, but it was the late Al Bell who was remembered by the community years after the eruption.

Name changes The avenue was originally known as Pereselencheskaya Street; a fragment of this street still exists at the far eastern end of the avenue. Starting in 1975, the street began appearing on maps of Perm as Voroshilov Avenue. In 1988 the local press began to suggest that the street be renamed. The majority of Perm's citizens agreed that the avenue needed a new name, but opinion varied greatly on what the new name should be. Some suggested the street be named after Tukhachevsky or Zhukov in keeping with Russian history, but overall the name \\"Park Avenue\\" was the most popular. On July 20, 1989 the Perm city council passed the final decision to rename the street Park Avenue. Houses along the street received new registered addresses.

Melbourne FC, Since 1858 - An Illustrated History. Geoff Slattery Publishing 2008) was an Irish Australian who had a clear role in the origins of Australian football by being one of the first people to introduce school football games to Australian public schools in 1858 and as one of the founders of the Melbourne Football Club. Smith was a founding member and signatory to the foundation document of the Melbourne Football Club. According to some sources (including himself in an 1876 letter to The Australasian ) he was one of few people to be present at the meeting of the incorporation of the club on 17 May 1859. At this meeting, the first Laws of Australian Football were decided upon and written. Smith was also a distinguished player for the club. Life Educated at Trinity College (Dublin University) (1846‚Äì50), Smith was a headmaster at several Melbourne secondary schools including the Model School and inspector for schools for Bendigo. Smith was involved in early experimental matches of Australian Football against Melbourne Grammar School between July‚ÄìAugust 1858 and is said to have facilitated the matches as one of three teachers who took part. He was captain of the Melbourne Football club in 1862 during the Caledonian Society games. He was also the first captain to take a test away from home when Melbourne played the Geelong Football Club and won. In 1864 he was suspended from teaching due to his sharp temper and strict discipline before resigning from his position in 1875.Gillian Hibbins He moved to South Australia and in 1876, wrote to The Australasian from there to speak out against what he perceived as poor journalism from which had overlooked his role in the foundation of the Melbourne Football Club. Details of his life are scant and according to the Melbourne Football Club, it is not known when and where he died.

History The Grove at Shrewsbury, New Jersey's first lifestyle center, opened in 1988. In the late 1980s, the lifestyle center was a new idea in retail. It requires less land than a regional shopping center, produces higher per square foot sales than many shopping centers and is thought of as being more convenient and accessible to shoppers due to its smaller size. The Grove fits all these qualities and further attracted retailers to its property due to its lush, well-kept gardens, brick walkways, comfortable seating areas, community events, and individual storefronts. The primary anchor in the early years of The Grove was Epstein's, a regional New Jersey Department store. Epstein's would later close and Sealfon's, another upscale, regional New Jersey department store opened in its place. That store also went out of business. The space was eventually subdivided and in its place opened a flagship Brooks Brothers and Anthropologie, Monmouth County's first.

His Dutch name Bernard Claesen SpierdijkArne Zuidhoek, Piraten Encyclopedie, Uitgeverij Aspekt, 2006, suggests he may have come from the village of Spierdijk, North Holland. Commander of the 18-gun Mary and Jane, he was a longtime privateer active in Cuba throughout the 1660s and, on his first voyage, successfully attacked and looted the town of San Tomas while sailing along the coast of Venezuela. In early 1670, he set out from Port Royal with letters from Governor Thomas Modyford to the Governor of Cuba \\"signifying peace between the two nations\\". As a further show of goodwill, several Spanish prisoners being held in Jamaica were also returned. However, the Governor of Bayamo was suspicious of his intentions and had an officer search his ship three times looking for evidence of privateering. Having brought a full cargo of European luxury goods, which were in short supply among the local townspeople, Speirdyke soon sold his entire stock. Despite this breach of Spanish law, the governor chose to turn a blind eye. Setting sail for his return to Jamaica, it was shortly after leaving the harbor that they were hailed by an English ship and asked where they hailed from. When Speirdyke answered Jamaica, the captain revealed himself as Manuel Ribeiro Pardal, a former Portuguese privateer turned pirate hunter, and called upon the elderly Dutchman to defend himself. Pardal opened fire and the two ships began a battle lasting until the evening when it became to dark to see. Speirdyke was outnumbered 18 to 70, however he continued to fight on. At dawn, he sailed towards Pardal's ship which he and his men boarded. The Dutchmen were said to have fought bravely and during the savage hand-to-hand fighting that followed resulted in one-third of Pardal's crew being killed or wounded. The numbers of the Portuguese eventually overwhelmed Speirdyke and his men. By the time the Dutch surrendered, the Mary and Jane was on fire in two places and five men had been killed, including Speirdyke. Sending nine of the survivors back with a message to Modyford of his commission and his intentions of retaliation for the raid of Portobello two years before, he took the remaining four with him as prisoners to Cartagena.Earle, Peter.

Born in Gaffneys Creek, Victoria, he was educated at South Melbourne College before becoming a goldminer and teacher. He also studied at the University of Melbourne for a Master of Arts degree. In 1928, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives in unusual circumstances. Jones stood for the Labor Party in Indi, and was initially a heavy underdog in this strongly conservative seat. However Country Party incumbent Robert Cook mistakenly failed to lodge his renomination papers, leaving Jones to take the seat unopposed. This is one of the few known instances in the history of the Australian Parliament that a candidate has lost his or her seat in this way. Jones narrowly held onto the seat in 1929, seeing off a spirited challenge from Cook. He was defeated in the United Australia Party landslide of 1931, suffering a 14-point swing. The Labor Party has not come close to winning the seat since then, only tallying 45 percent of the two-party vote once. Jones was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council in 1938 for Doutta Galla Province.

He was highly praised by Humbert de Romans, Bernard Gui, Antonio Pierozzi, Leander Alberti, and Thomas Malvenda in his Annals. Reginald was an early follower of Dominic of Osma and entered the Dominican Order at San Nicol√≤ delle Vigne in Bologna, where he was thereafter lived in a Dominican confraternity. The name by which he is commonly known may indicate either that he was born in Bologna or merely reflects his conversion and occupation there. His teaching at the University of Bologna influenced Ramon de Penyafort to convert to mendicancy in 1222. In 1221 he was one of twelve or thirteen friars sent to England by Dominic in one of his last acts. Their work was to be not only missional but also foundational: they were commissioned to found Dominican houses in the British Isles, under the superiority of Gilbert of Fresnay. Reginald held no official post in the Isles, rather he travelled them widely, covering most of England and setting foot in Ireland. Reginald spent a few years in Britain before returning to Italy, where he entered the service of Pope Gregory IX as a penitentiary in Rome. It was he who received the news in Europe of the death of the Dominican master-general, Jordan of Saxony, off the coast of Palestine and brought it, with another Dominican papal penitentiary, Godfrey, to Paris and probably elsewhere in 1237. In 1247 Pope Innocent IV appointed Reginald Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of Ireland, perhaps on account of his knowledge of the English language, but also as a check on the power of Henry III of England over the Irish church. Two other Dominicans, David McKelly, Archbishop of Cashel, and Alan O'Sullivan, Bishop of Cloyne, already held posts in Ireland and may have influenced Innocent's choice of Reginald to replace the abdicating Albert Suerbeer. Reginald could speak no Irish. In 1252 Reginald paid his ad limina to Innocent IV, but was detained in Rome for a long period of time litigating on behalf of his diocese, which cases he eventually won. He never returned to Ireland. He died in Italy late in 1256, probably at either Rome or Anagni. He may have been ill for some time. References *O'Daniel, Victor F.

After teaching at Yale (1961-1967), he has been on the faculty at Dartmouth College (1967 to present) as well as Cultural Attach√© at the American Embassy in Paris (1969-1971). He is currently the Nelson A. Rockefeller Professor of Government Emeritus and Research Professor in the Department of Government at Dartmouth. Academic career Roger Masters has made deep and wide-ranging contributions in social science. The central concern of his career has been how biological circumstances influence individual behavior and social outcomes. Masters began his career in political philosophy as a student of Leo Strauss at the University of Chicago. His dissertation and subsequent book (Masters 1968) helped demonstrate the importance of Jean-Jacques Rousseau in modern thought. He translated and edited influential new editions of Rousseau's works (Masters 1964a, 1978), and later co-edited the only complete English edition of his Collected Writings (Masters and Kelly 1990). The role of natural science in early political thought is also addressed in books on Machiavelli and Leonardo da Vinci (Masters 1996, 1998). Masters' investigation of how nature influences human societies led to significant contributions in the field of international relations (Masters 1964b, 1967) as well as human ethology and sociobiology (Masters 1983, 1989, Masters and McGuire 1994). This work included pioneering laboratory experiments in political communication (Masters 1981, Masters et al. 1987). Later, Masters' research on biology and human behavior led to new epidemiological evidence regarding the behavioral impacts of neurotoxins, first on the consequences of lead poisoning (Masters, Hone and Doshi 1998), and then on the links between a common method of water fluoridation to elevated blood lead and a higher prevalence of violent crime, substance abuse and learning disabilities (Masters and Coplan 1999, Masters et al. 2000). Masters' work has pioneered the application of natural science discoveries to the social sciences and government policy. He was a founding member and serves on the Executive Council of the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences, and leads an ongoing consultancy on biology and politics for the U.S. Department of Defense in collaboration with anthropologist Lionel Tiger and neuroscientist Michael T. McGuire. He served on the 2006-07 \\"Get the Lead out of Vermont\\" task force, and is frequently consulted by other government agencies or activists concerned with the behavioral consequences of environmental toxins.

Power was increased to 10 kW day with nighttime operation at 10 kW (DA-2) from a new transmitter site in 1976. The call letters were amended to KNTR-AM on 1984-08-13. On 1998-10-22, the station changed its call sign to KCCF, on 2002-08-09 to the current KRPI. The station previously broadcast a Christian music format. Apna Sangeet was formed by Sukhdev Singh Dhillon in 1994. In 2001, Apna Sangeet became Radio Punjab International. In 2004, Radio Punjab accused rival Sher-E-Punjab of broadcasting on its AM 1550 frequency. After legal struggles, Radio Punjab moved to a different AM frequency. Sher-E- Punjab took over Radio Punjab. Sunday Mornings KRPI carries Baptist programming and on Sunday nights Commonwealth Club of California. On May 24, 2012, KRPI received a construction permit from the FCC to change its city of license from Ferndale, Washington to Point Roberts, Washington and to increase its nighttime power to 50 kW. This move is expected to improve reception in Metro Vancouver. The move to Point Roberts has attracted concerns from residents of Point Roberts and the adjacent community of Tsawwassen, British Columbia citing potential interference with electronic devices and health concerns. On August 6, 2014, the CRTC denied Sher-E-Punjab radio of a new AM frequency (600 AM, formerly CKBD) licensed to Canada. On November 28, 2016, the CRTC approved Sher-E-Punjab radio for a broadcasting licence to operate an AM radio station on 600 kHz, with a daytime and nighttime power of 10,000 watts.

It is native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a perennial herb with leaves made up of oval-shaped or oblong leaflets a few centimeters long. It has branched, coiled tendrils. The plant bears an inflorescence of two to eight pinkish purple pea flowers each up to two centimeters wide. The fruit is a dehiscent legume pod. Description Lathyrus linifolius is a perennial plant with a sprawling or climbing stem that grows to and is shallowly-winged and nearly hairless. The leaves are alternate with short winged stalks and long narrow stipules. The leaf blades are pinnate with two to four pairs of narrow lanceolate leaflets, entire margins and a terminal branching tendril. The inflorescence has a long stem and two to eight purple flowers, each long. These have five sepals and five petals and are irregular. The uppermost petal is known as the \\"standard\\", the lateral two as the \\"wings\\" and the lowest two are joined to form the \\"keel\\". There are ten stamens and a single carpel. The fruit is a flat brown pod containing up to twelve seeds. This plant flowers in July and August. Distribution and habitat Lathyrus linifolius is native to Europe, parts of Asia and North America. Its typical habitat is in rich ground and this plant is found in damp meadows, on river banks, on the margins of ponds, by lakes and near the sea, and occasionally in coastal hedgerows. It often seems to grow among reeds (Phragmites australis). The species epithet palustris is Latin for \\"of the marsh\\" and indicates its common habitat. Archibald William Smith Marsh Pea grows from long rhizomes that allows the plant to spread vegetatively. As the common name implies, Marsh Pea, it is found in wet to moist areas where it can receive adequate sun and also allows other plants to climb on.

The sanctuary is a prime location for the viewing of kettling and migrating raptors with an average of 20,000 hawks, eagles and falcons passing the lookouts during the late summer and fall every year. The birds are identified and counted by staff and volunteers to produce annual counts of migrating raptors that represent the world's longest record of raptor populations. These counts have provided conservationists with valuable information on changes in raptor numbers in North America. Setting The Sanctuary is located on a ridge of Hawk Mountain, one of the Blue Mountain chain. The Visitor Center houses a shop and facilities with parking nearby. A habitat garden next to it is home to native plants that are protected by a deer fence. The Lookout Trail runs from the Visitor Center to a number of raptor viewing sites along the ridge, the most popular being the close by South Lookout (elevation ) and the North Lookout (elevation ) with a 200 degree panoramic view that extends to . Nine trails of varying difficulty are available to hikers and linked to the Appalachian Trail. Located in the sanctuary is Schaumboch's Tavern, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.  History  The area was a popular site for shooting hawks, either for sport or to prevent depredations on domestic fowl or game birds. In 1934, Rosalie Edge leased of property on Hawk Mountain and hired wardens to keep the hunters away. The wardens were Maurice Broun and his wife Irma Broun, bird enthusiasts and conservationists from New England. Almost immediately, there was a noticeable recovery in the raptor population. In 1938, the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary Association was incorporated as a non-profit organization in Pennsylvania, and Edge purchased the property and deeded it to the association in perpetuity. As the world's oldest wildlife sanctuary exclusively committed to the protection and observation of birds of prey, Hawk Mountain holds a unique place in geographic and scientific history. It is not owned or financially supported by the state; it remains entirely self- sufficient. In 1965, the sanctuary was designated a National Natural Landmark. Famous visitors to the sanctuary include Rachel CarsonBroun, Maurice. Hawks Aloft: The Story of Hawk Mountain. and John Denver, whose name is inscribed on a memorial bench at South Lookout. In 2007, the sanctuary lost one of its dearest friends and the most generous benefactor in its history, Sarkis Acopian, an industrialist and humanitarian. Through his philanthropy, the sanctuary was able to open the Acopian Center for Conservation Learning in 2001, where students come from all over the world to participate in work-study internships, learning about ornithology, environmental science, biology, and related fields. In 2009, the sanctuary celebrated the 75th anniversary of Rosalie Edge's original efforts. Migration timetable The peak migration time at Hawk Mountain Sanctuary is as follows. Time periods given here are those when the raptor has historically been counted on half or more days. Species of raptor are listed in chronological order of the start of their period of likely observation. * Broad-winged hawk: late August to late September * American kestrel: late August to early October * Osprey: late August to early October * Bald eagle: early September * Northern harrier: early September to early November * Sharp-shinned hawk: early September to early November * Red-tailed hawk: early September to early December * Cooper's hawk: late September to late October * Merlin: early October * Peregrine falcon: early October * Red-shouldered hawk: early October to early November * Golden eagle: early November * Rough-legged hawk: early November to early December * Goshawk: late November Gallery File:Hawk Mountain Sanctuary, PA - Raptor wing span information.jpgRaptor wing spans Image:Hawk.mountain.JPGSouth Lookout File:Overlook - Hawk Mountain Sanctuary, PA.jpgOverlook view of Hawk Mountain Image:John Denver bench.jpgThe John Denver bench  References External links * The official website of Hawk Mountain *Video Interviews About Hawk Mountain Category:Bird sanctuaries of the United States Category:Raptor organizations Category:National Natural Landmarks in Pennsylvania Category:Bird observatories in the United States Category:Protected areas of Berks County, Pennsylvania Category:Nature reserves in Pennsylvania Category:Protected areas of Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania Category:Schuylkill River National and State Heritage Area Category:Nature centers in Pennsylvania Category:Raptor migration sites Category:Pennsylvania state historical marker significations ","title":"Hawk Mountain Sanctuary"},{"id":"17948920","text":"Toanga is a town in the Kombissiri Department of Baz√®ga Province in central Burkina Faso.

The building has 30 floors and rises 448 feet (137 meters). One Dallas Center is currently tied with the Sheraton Dallas Hotel North Tower as the 25th-tallest building in the city. The building was originally planned as part of a three- building complex designed by I.M. Pei & Partners, but only one tower was constructed. One Dallas Center is now owned by Todd Interests and houses HKS Inc., Greyhound HQ, and Apex Clearing Corporation. The first 15 floors of the high rise are renovated office space, while the top 15 floors are luxury apartment homes constructed and delivered in October 2014. One Dallas Center is professionally managed by Lincoln Property Company.  History  One Dallas Center was announced by developer Vince Carrozza in 1977 as the first phase of a US$200 million mixed-use development. Phase One included One Dallas Center and the 500-space parking garage across Bryan Street. Two Dallas Center, adjacent to the south of One Dallas Center, was to include a 21-story, 500 room hotel above 30 floors of office space. The third phase would have consisted of a 400-unit luxury apartment complex across Harwood Street, on land now occupied by the Sheraton Dallas Hotel convention facility. All parts were to be connected by the expanded Dallas Pedestrian Network (Vincent Ponte, land planner for Dallas Center, was also a city planning consultant for the pedestrian network). During construction in 1977 a crane fell 27 stories from the roof and crashed to the ground, killing a worker, injuring others, and punching several holes in the side of the tower. One Dallas Center opened in 1979, but additional phases of the development were never completed due to various leasehold issues attached to the land (although the building was connected to the Dallas Pedestrian Network). In 1985 the building was purchased by Trammell Crow, who owned a large share of adjacent office space at the time. It changed ownership again during the 1990s as nearby development made the building more attractive; adjacent Bryan Street was closed to auto traffic for DART's St. Paul Station, which opened in 1996. In 2007 Younan Properties Inc. purchased the building and changed the name to Patriot Tower. The company planned a $10 million renovation and addition of a war memorial museum in the building's lobby. In 2012 the building sold to new owners, who converted the upper 17 floors into apartments and renovated the lower levels. Street sign announcing the construction and leasing information of the tower was shown in opening scene of season 1 episode 3 of Dallas in 1978.  Design  One Dallas Center was designed by architect Henry N. Cobb of I.M. Pei & Partners to play with the site rather than fill the entire block. The building's diamond shape relates to the geometry of the city's diagonally intersecting street grids, specifically where nearby Live Oak Street intersects downtown's grid at a 30-degree angle. Placement of the building was carefully considered to relate to nearby structures and provide green space around building entrances. The two triangular notches on the sides of One Dallas Center create added interest and provide four additional corner offices on each floor. The exterior of the building was designed with two-thirds of the facade covered in aluminum instead of highly-reflective glass. This helped conserve energy while also complementing the style of the adjacent Republic Center. 2-inch projections of stainless steel separate the glass from the aluminum. One Design Center has an extensive permanent collection of art which includes works by Dallas-based artist, JD Miller. The original 1977 plan had all phases designed by Henry Cobb and the shapes were eccentric but cohesive. Two Dallas Centre was to be a chevron-shaped tower with 30 floors of office space topped with 21 floors of hotel space, also integrating unique angles. Three Dallas Centre was envisioned to contain 400 luxury apartments across the street. In 1981 the master site plan was revised and Two Dallas Centre was redesigned by architect Araldo Cossutta. It included one 1.7 million-square- foot office building (twin hexagonal towers joined at the 16th and 23rd floors) and a separate 500-room hotel with semi-circular windows on four sides.

He made vigorous preparations for war, but when he reached the province he did not adopt any active measures, but allowed himself to be deceived by the artifices of Jugurtha, who constantly promised to surrender. Many persons supposed that his inactivity was intentional, and that Jugurtha had bought him over. When Albinus departed from Africa, he left his brother Aulus Postumius Albinus in command. After the defeat of the latter he returned to Numidia, but in consequence of the disorganized state of his army, he did not prosecute the war, and handed over the army in this condition, in the following year, to the consul Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus.Sallust, Jugurthine War Jug. 35, 36, 39, 44Orosius, iv. 15Eutropius, iv. 26 He was condemned by the Lex Mamilia, which was passed to punish all those who had been guilty of treasonable practices with Jugurtha.Cicero, Brut. 34comp.

The most famous of these events is the Stawell Gift which has been run since 1878 and hosts the richest footrace in Australia. Many other gifts are held around Victoria in country and metro locations including Ballarat, Bendigo, Wangaratta, Maryborough, Keilor, Yarrawonga, Ringwood, Rye and Olympic Park. Races are run under a handicap system which makes races competitive. Each race has a different handicap limit. Generally, the greater the sum of the prize money for a race, the less handicap is available, limiting the class of runners that can win. Runners are awarded prize money when making finals and bookmaking occurs at major meets.  History of Professional Running  The oldest professional carnival in Victoria is the Maryborough Gift which celebrated its 155th anniversary on New years Day 2016.  Present Day Professional Footrunning  Australia's best known footrace is the Stawell Gift, held at Easter since 1878.https://web.archive.org/web/20020208042218/http://www.geocities.com/~ewen/r2002_01.htmlhttp://www.stawellgift.com/hall- of-fame/about-the-stawell-gift/ The other major carnival that has been run continuously for more than 100 years is the Burnie Gift in Tasmania. It was first run in 1885. The status as the richest carnival was challenged for a time in NSW with the running of the Botany Bay Gift Carnival which, in the 1990s. boasts total prize money of $120,000 and $70,000 for its main race with a $50,000 first prize. The excellent event, however, faded from the scene when sponsorship became difficult to maintain. The Stawell Carnival has a total prize money pool of $90,000. The main race, the Stawell Gift, is over 120m and the winner receives $40, 000. There are many other carnivals and events conducted under handicap foot-running conditions throughout the nation each year. Apart from Stawell and Burnie, some of the more famous long-running carnivals are the Bay Sheffield Carnival in South Australia, Bendigo and Ballarat in Victoria, the Christmas Carnivals in North Western Tasmania, and an annual Gift on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Temora and Macksville Carnivals in New South Wales. Since the late 1980s athletics and the Olympic Games have been 'open', meaning that the so-called amateurs and professionals can all compete together for prize money without being penalised or discriminated against.  History of the Victorian Athletic League  The Victorian Athletic League was established in 1895. Professional running in Australia began in the gold-mining days and boomed in areas where miners were prospecting and digging for gold. The miners raced against each other for the gift of a gold nugget offered by the local publican or mine owner. The miners raced over various distances but the main race was run over the Sheffield distance of 130 yards. In the 1860s big money began to creep into the sport which attracted a wealth of athletic talent. Competitions took on a carnival atmosphere and crowds flocked to see local champions. In April 1878, nearly two thousand people witnessed the running of the first Stawell Easter Gift which was won by 24-year-old farmer W.J.Millard. The sport of professional running continued to grow. Big prize money and heavy betting attracted talented athletes as well as a range of shady characters. By the early 1890s, the sport of professional running was in crisis. Athletes running under false names, hiding past performance, corrupt officials and other controversies led the need to establish a controlling body for professional running in Victoria. The Victorian Athletic League was formed on 15 April 1895 when RV Lewis of Benalla was elected president and Hastings Bell of Stawell was appointed secretary. Originally the League was administered from Stawell and formulated rules and regulations for country towns that conducted sports carnivals. It also acted as arbitrator in any disputes arising at those carnivals. In 1902 a regular office was established in Melbourne and the Victorian Athletic League began to promote the sport of professional running. Carnivals were held in Melbourne and major Victorian towns and became extremely popular with the sporting public. 1917, a dispute over prize money led to a breakaway group, the Victorian Athletic Association, being formed and conducting event in opposition to the Victorian Athletic League. In 1921, through the mediation of the Stawell Athletic Club, the Victorian Athletic League and the Victorian Athletic Association were merged. ES Herring of Maryborough was elected president and Joe Bull appointed as secretary. The Victorian Athletic League established an office in Brunswick and held mid week sports meetings were held at White City in Tottenham, at the Exhibition Grounds and at the Monodrome. During the 1920s and 1930s, popularity of professional running grew tremendously and the VAL staged World Sprint Championships. At the outbreak of World War II, many Victorian Athletic League clubs abandoned their meetings. However, the federal cabinet granted permission for the Victorian Athletic League to conduct footrunning at Maribyrnong for the benefit of athletes on leave from the armed forces and men employed in essential services. After World War II the Victorian Athletic League gained strength and had nearly fifteen hundred registered runners, three hundred trainers and was conducted sports carnivals at seventy centres across Victoria from mid November to early June. By the early 1960s, interest in professional running had waned. The number of registered runners had declined and only twenty-eight carnivals were held across Victoria. In an effort to revive the sport, the Victorian Athletic League invited champion international athletes such as Bob Hayes, Alan Simpson and Robbie Hutchison to compete in Australia. In 1969, the St Kilda club staged the richest footrace in the world with a first prize of $2,000. In 1977, the Victorian Athletic League undertook substantial administrative changes becoming an incorporated company, establishing a computerised record of handicaps and results, and commissioning the use of an electronic race finish recording machine. After years of segregation between amateur and professional athletics, in 1986 saw the dawning of open athletics when Stawell Gift winners Chris Perry and John Dinan competed for Australia at the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. In recent years, the Victorian Athletic League has extended its athletic format beyond club carnivals. The League moved into conducting special events such as the famous Dandy Dollar Dash at VFL/AFL football matches, the Moomba Mile run down Bourke Street in the Melbourne CBD, 400 metres series' during international cricket matches at the MCG and sprint events during horse races at Moonee Valley. In 2001, the Victorian Athletic League moved offices to be co-located with Athletics Victoria at Olympic Park in Melbourne. The League began to form a strong alliance with Athletics Victoria through formal affiliation, sharing resources and establishing a dual-registration process.

It has been held at City Oval, Sebastopol Oval and Northern Oval where VFL team the North Ballarat Roosters play. It was first conducted in 1949 and won by Ted Marantelli. During much of the 1970s and 1980s the only Gift conducted in Ballarat was the Sebastopol Gift. After the demise of the Sebatopol Gift in 1988, the Ballarat Gift returned to the VAL calendar in 1989 at the City Oval. After traditionally being held in February since inception, in 2010 the Ballarat Gift was moved to the weekend after the Stawell Easter Gift (April). With the assistance of the Goldfields Council, the Gift was worth a record $40,000. With all six Stawell Gift finalists entered, the 2010 Ballarat Gift final featured four of them including Stawell Gift winner Tom Burbidge. The Gift was won by 44-year-old Ballarat based, self trained athlete, Peter O'Dwyer. It was O'Dwyer's second Ballarat Gift after winning the race in 1996.

Rice is known as mechanician, who has made fundamental contributions to various aspects of solid mechanics. Two of his early contributions are the concept of the J-integral in fracture mechanics and an explanation of how plastic deformations localize in a narrow band. In recent years, Rice has focused on the mechanical processes involved in earthquakes. In 2015, the Society of Engineering Science established the James R.

Biography Clee was born in 1888 in Thompsonville, Connecticut to Frederick and Margaret (Kelley) Clee.Schwarz, J.S. Religious Leaders of America (1941). At a young age he was forced by his father's illness to go to Worcester, Massachusetts, to work in a steel mill. He started a boys' club among his fellow mill workers and in 1908 began working for the Young Men's Christian Association in Quincy, Massachusetts. Clee married Katherine Steele on August 9, 1911. Clee educated himself for the ministry while serving as assistant to the pastor of West End Presbyterian Church in New York City from 1918 to 1921. His first pastorate was at the Rutherford Baptist Church in Bergen County, New Jersey, from 1921 to 1926, after which time he became pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church in Newark, New Jersey. He served as pastor at the Newark church for nearly 25 years before retiring in 1950. Clee was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly in 1934 on the Essex County Clean Government ticket. The following year he briefly served as Speaker of the Assembly before being elected to the New Jersey Senate. In 1937 he became the Republican nominee for Governor of New Jersey against the Democratic candidate A. Harry Moore. Clee carried 15 of the state's 21 counties, but Moore won the election thanks to an overwhelming plurality of more than 45,000 votes in his home county of Hudson. The Hudson returns were widely suspected to be fraudulent, the result of political boss Frank Hague's tight control on the county's electoral process.Boss, Time, May 20, 1940. Accessed June 14, 2008. Clee later served as chairman of the State Mediation Board under Governor Alfred E. Driscoll, and was also president of the State Civil Service Commission and a member of the State Parole Board. He moved to Chester Borough in 1950 and served as Borough Councilman and later as Mayor of Chester Borough, New Jersey. He moved to Princeton in 1954. His wife died in January 1954, and the following year he married Madeleine Dreier. Clee successfully petitioned for continuance of Bloomfield College and Seminary (now Bloomfield College) before the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, with which it is affiliated.

Buettner currently lives in Georgia. BibliographyNovels= Jason Wander series War Is an Orphanage: Jason Wander, left orphaned at age 17 by an attack from an unseen alien enemy, must fight his own demons before he can fight Earth's. Jason starts off on a self-destructive streak that leads to being expelled from school, through foster homes and finally to an appointment with a no-nonsense judge. As the world begins falling apart, Jason is given the choice of so many others, from an earlier time in American history: join the Army or go to jail. This decision leads to an odyssey of adventures that takes Jason Wander from the pits of despair to the heights of victory. In the spirit of Johnnie Rico and Starship Troopers, Robert Buettner crafts a story that is as much about a young man coming of age as it is about fighting alien creatures. # Orphanage (April 1, 2008 ‚Äì Reissued), the first volume in the \\"Jason Wander\\" series. Mankind's first alien contact tears into Earth: projectiles launched from Jupiter's moon, Ganymede, vaporize whole cities. Under siege, humanity gambles on one desperate counterstrike. In a spacecraft scavenged from scraps and armed with Vietnam-era weapons, foot soldiers like eighteen-year-old Jason Wander-orphans that no one will miss- must dare man's first interplanetary voyage and invade Ganymede. # Orphan's Destiny (April 1, 2008 ‚Äì Reissued), the second volume in the \\"Jason Wander\\" series. At twenty-five, General Jason Wander has fought and won man's only alien conflict. Now, after long years in space, he's coming home...but to what? Earth's desperate nations, impoverished by war damage and military spending, are slashing defense budgets. There's just one problem with this new worldwide policy-the first alien invasion was merely Plan A. Suddenly, the real assault begins: Earth is attacked by a vast armada of city-sized warships. To block their invasion, mankind has only one surviving craft and a single guerrilla strike force...a suicide squad led by Jason Wander.\\" # Orphan's Journey (April 1, 2008 ‚Äì Reissued), the third volume in the \\"Jason Wander\\" series. In the years since the last Slug War, Jason's command style has not made him any friends in the Army. Now, in an effort to keep him out of trouble, the Army has sent Jason to the vast, Earth-orbiting resort called New Moon. At the core of this enormous space station is a starship, a relic from the last war. When a test run of the ship goes wrong, Jason, along with a handful of others, will be torn from orbit and thrust into space. Now, stranded on an alien planet, Jason realizes that not only are his friends looking to him for rescue, but an entire planet sees him as their only hope. # Orphan‚Äôs Alliance (October 28, 2008), the fourth volume in the \\"Jason Wander\\" series. Humans have been discovered on the Outworlds. And the Army decides to send emissaries. Emissaries like Jason Wander. As intraplanetary conflicts rage around him, and the personal stakes get ever higher, Jason finds that playing planet-hopping politician can be harder than commanding armies. When united mankind squares off to battle the Slugs for a precious interstellar crossroad, Jason will discover that the most dangerous enemy may be the one he least expects. # Orphan's Triumph (May 26, 2009), the fifth volume in the \\"Jason Wander\\" series. Jason Wander is ready to lead the final charge into battle. After forty years of fighting the Slugs, mankind's reunited planets control the vital crossroad that secures their uneasy union. The doomsday weapon that can end the war, and the mighty fleet that will carry it to the Slug homeworld, lie within humanity's grasp. Since the Slug Blitz orphaned Jason Wander, he has risen from infantry recruit to commander of Earth's garrisons on the emerging allied planets. But four decades of service have cost Jason not just his friends and family, but his innocence. When an enemy counter strike threatens to reverse the war and destroy mankind, Jason must finally confront not only his lifelong alien enemy, but the reality of what a lifetime as a soldier has made him. Orphan's Legacy Series In March 2011, Baen Books, distributed by Simon & Schuster, released Overkill, Buettner's sixth novel and first in a new series, which will include at least three books. This series is set a generation after the Jason Wander books and includes characters from the earlier series, both directly and by reference. A continuing theme is the search by the protagonist, Jazen Parker, for his parents. # Overkill (March 2011), . Jazen Parker, a Legion soldier recently separated from service, accepts a bodyguard assignment to a rich tourist on the planet known as \\"Dead End.\\" Jazen forms both personal and professional connections as a result. # Undercurrents (July 2011), . Jazen Parker is asked to infiltrate a planet to investigate some disappearances. Personal reasons drive him to accept the assignment. This novel begins to explore the \\"cold war\\" conflict between Earth, which has a monopoly on interstellar spaceflight, and Yavet, a heavily populated planet with draconian population control and an ambition to overtake and surpass Earth. Jazen's personal moral code also conflicts, to a degree, with the goals of the organization, and people, with whom he works. # Balance Point (April 2014), . While Jazen Parker attempts to determine his future, his past makes him pivotal in a plot that could upset the balance of power between Earth and Yavet. The volume also includes the short work Mole Hunt. N.B.: In the Afterword, Buettner indicates that Balance Point is his final \\"homage to science fiction classics\\". The first two novels in this series incorporated antique (by the standards of the time depicted) tanks. Buettner is the son of a tanker.An Author'S Special Thank You to Some Special People Who Made Overkill Possible, and Who Have Done So Much More Than That ¬´ Robert Buettner.

Icingtons are distinguishable from other wedding figurines by their organic soft look. They are placed on top of the wedding cake as a visual and symbolic mechanism.  Ingredients  Icingtons consist of royal icing, also known as 'hard icing' or 'ready-to-roll icing', or sugar paste.  Origins  The design of icingtons was inspired by classic French cinema of the 1940s and 1950s. They possessed a simple yet elegant aesthetic that encapsulated the on-screen sophistication of classic French actresses and actors. While the cake topper became popularized in America during the 1950s as a symbol of union, icingtons distinguished themselves by maintaining their elegance.  Differences between cake toppers  Today, the words 'cake figurines' and 'cake toppers' are interchangeable. Cake toppers increasingly refer to figurines that are made of plastic, porcelain and now polymer clay. Figurines made of icing are traditionally referred to as icingtons. Some adopt the generic term 'sugar paste topper' to describe them, as these days many sugar paste toppers are devoid of any French influences.  Artistry  Icingtons have evolved from the kitchens of patisserie chefs and cake decorators displaying their skills in fondant, marzipan, and royal icing. Icing sugar creations are considered an art form in itself, and require a great deal of skill and craftsmanship, and may involve embossing, crimping, broderie anglaise, and Garret frills.Anne Smith, The art of sugarcraft: Sugarpaste, Merehurst Press, 1987 Modern-day icingtons have not strayed too far from the traditional - they still retain the suave, elegant look that mirror the French Classics.

Adler was a graduate of Queens College with a B.A. in Hebrew, of Brandeis University with a M.A. in Mediterranean Studies and of Cornell University, where she got her doctorate in Classics. She was widely regarded as one of the most gifted teachers in Middlebury's history. Life and career Adler primarily specialized in ancient epic poetry, particularly Homer and Vergil, as well as classical understanding of liberal education. Prior to her death, she published her monumental and authoritative work called \\"Vergil's Empire: Political Thought in the Aeneid\\" (Rowman & Littlefield, 2003). In this book, Adler rejects centuries of scholarship on Vergil, which believes that he was merely a clever imitator of Homer, and argues that he had a unique view of the human condition and ambitions as great, if not greater, than his Greek predecessor. As the Weekly Standard wrote in its review of the book, Adler believes \\"something of a secret teaching may be glimpsed behind the imperial screen ... [Secret teaching of] views on universal empire [that have] urgency not only for literary studies but for our reflections on empire in the current global situation.\\" In addition to her book on Vergil, Adler had written an earlier work on Catullan self-Revelation and numerous scholarly articles on other classical authors. Adler was also an important scholar of political philosophy in general, and extensively studied the political thought and approach to Scholarly method advocated by Leo Strauss, and was widely regarded as one of the leading Straussians even though she had never studied with him. She was the translator from German of Strauss's \\"Philosophy and Law: Contributions to the Understanding of Maimonides and His Predecessors\\" (Albany: SUNY Press, 1995). Her introduction to that work is one of the most authoritative interpretation of Strauss's work on Maimonides. In the 1990s, Adler developed an interest in Russian thought and literature. She not only taught herself Russian language, but also co-authored, with Vladimir Shlyakhov, \\"A Dictionary of Russian Slang and Colloquial Expressions\\" (Barrons, 1995). She also translated Mikhail Epstein's \\"Cries in the New Wilderness\\" from Russian. She spent the last years of her life preparing a Russian translation of Strauss' Natural Right and History. This translation was published after her death in Russia (Moscow: Vodoley Publishers, 2007, see lstrauss.ru). Adler taught Greek, Latin, and Hebrew at Middlebury College, and also knew German, Russian, Arabic, and Italian.

Home of Economy sells a variety of goods: clothing, work wear, home furniture, housewares, automotive goods, tools, farm supplies, hardware, lawn and garden supplies, paint, pet supplies, hunting and fishing equipment, and sporting goods. History Founded in 1939 in Thief River Falls, Minnesota by Bob Kiesau and his wife, Jean, Home of Economy was originally an auto parts wholesale business. In February 1940, Bob started a store in Grand Forks, North Dakota, recapping used tires at night and selling them during the day. In the years since, Home of Economy has grown to include stores in other North Dakota cities, including Grafton, Devils Lake, Minot, Williston, Watford City and Jamestown. Home of Economy is considered by many to be the first discount store. Prior to Home of Economy's discount program, free-trade laws required retailers to sell at high, fixed prices, and only fleet operators with five or more machines could receive discounts. In 1950, Bob Kiesau sent his employees to every county seat in the trade area to copy names and addresses of each taxpayer who had listed three or more tractors or combines. He assumed each farmer would have at least one car and one truck that would not be listed on the tax report. From this list, a fleet identification card was mailed to every farmer, enabling them to buy at fleet discounts. Home of Economy store in Jamestown, North Dakota On December 3, 1987, fire destroyed the store in Grand Forks. The store was back in operation in three separate temporary locations less than a week after the fire began.

Its studios are in Crowley and its transmitter is located northwest of Kaplan in Acadia Parish. History 102.1 signed on in 1989 as Acadia Parish-focused KBAZ with a country format. In 1994, 102.1 changed calls to KSIG-FM and became a simulcast of Adult Standards sister station 1450/KSIG, which lasted until April 10, 1997 when the signal was upgraded to 50 kW and entered the Lafayette market. Upon the upgrade, the station took on the KQIS call letters and switched to adult contemporary as \\"Kiss 102.\\" Since the initial upgrade into the Lafayette market, KQIS has shifted its format several times. In 1998, KQIS had to drop the \\"KISS\\" branding (due to copyright infringement and a threatened lawsuit by Clear Channel). The station was not sued and had to be renamed as Soft Rock 102.1, whilst sticking to the same Adult contemporary format. Later that year, 102.1 was upgraded once more to 100 kW, extending coverage west to Lake Charles market and became a hybrid Adult Contemporary- Smooth Jazz \\"102.1 Kiss FM.\\", which further popularized the station. In October 2000, KQIS became one of the first stations in the United States to launch an 80s Oldies format, which lasted until late 2001, when newer music was mixed in to shift the station's format to Hot AC. In 2002, the Kiss brand was dropped once and for all when what is now KOBW became Kiss FM. KOBW provides fringe coverage into the Lafayette area, and KQIS' owners feared a cease and desist from Clear Channel, who owns KOBW. The Hot AC format was tweaked to Top 40 for a short time in 2004 before settling on the current format. On March 11, 2010 KQIS changed their call letters to KYBG. It now calls itself \\"BIG 102.1\\" and plays what it calls \\"the biggest hits\\" from the '70s and '80s with some from the 60s and early 90s also mixed in.

Prior to the festivals, it was difficult for professional Canadian dancers to earn a living by practicing their art in their own country. When the festivals ended in 1954 after six years, Canadian dancers were able to find paid work in Canadian television practicing their art. Formation In 1947, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet formed the Canadian Ballet Festival under the direction of the manager David Yeddeau. The Canadian Ballet Festival Association (CBFA) became the official organizing body. In a statement to the Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences, the Canadian Ballet Festival Association identified the purpose of the festival as being to generate interest in dance in order \\"to prepare a professional field for Canadian dancers, thus enabling them to earn their livelihood by the practice of their own art in their own country.\\" Events The inaugural festival in 1948 in Winnipeg brought together three ballet companies. In addition to the fledgling Winnipeg Ballet, the festival included the Toronto-based Volkoff Canadian Ballet, and a Montreal-based modernist troupe under Ruth Sorel. Kay Armstrong, with the British Columbia School of Dancing planned on performing which would have established her as the only Canadian choreographer with an original ballet. However, when the promised travel subsidy was withdrawn, Armstrong's troupe couldn't afford to participate. Canadian composers wrote most of the music for the Second Annual festival, held in Toronto in March 1949 at the Royal Alexandra Theatre. It featured eleven companies, including Neo Dance Theatre, and 21 ballets were performed, including Cynthia Barrett's, Song of David and Boris Volkoff's Red Ear of Corn. John Jacob Weinzweig wrote the first Canadian score commissioned by the Festival. Samuel Hersenhoren directed the orchestra.

They have had a long association with Maddy Prior. History The band was founded in 1983 by Andy Watts and Giles Lewin, together with Bill Badley, after Watts had been the musical director of an open-air Medieval Players production of Rabelais' Gargantua. The show featured actors, giant carnival characters, puppets, acrobatics, juggling and 16th-century music. The three founding members were musicians with the Medieval Players. Together with percussionist Charles Fullbrook the quartet made their debut on the towpath of the Leeds-Liverpool canal at the Burnley Canalside Festival in 1984.

Law license suspension for misconduct  The Ohio Board of Professional Conduct recommended to the Ohio Supreme Court to suspend Owens law license for 6 months after an investigation in to the events of a spousal support payment made by Owens on behalf of a client. The recommended sanctions resulted from Owens misconduct in paying a clients overdue spousal support payment of $58,242.93 from his IOLTA client trust account, which holds other client funds, to the Delaware County Child Support Enforcement Agency. Subsequently, Owens placed a \\"stop payment\\" on the check which caused the check to the Child Support Enforcement Agency to bounce. The non-sufficient fund payment obtained the premature release of his client from incarceration at the Delaware County Jail, The Board of Profession Conduct found that Owens's conduct violated three professional conduct rules. # The board found that Owens violated Professional Conduct Rule 8.4(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) by falsely representing that his client had paid his past due spousal support, when he had not. # The board found that Owens violated Professional Conduct Rule 8.4(d) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice) by commencing and participating in a series of events that further delayed the clients ex- wife long-overdue spousal support and necessitated further court proceedings to collect the past due amount. # The board found that Owens violated Professional Conduct Rule 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer's fitness to practice law) by recklessly placing the funds of 19 clients in jeopardy. On December 19, 2018 after Owens mounted a failed appeal before the Ohio Supreme Court, the court was not \\"...convinced that the six-month suspension recommended by the board is the appropriate sanction for Owens‚Äôs misconduct\\" and recommended a year suspension from practicing law.

He was educated at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, before leaving to work at an iron plant in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

In the Senate he was chairman of the Joint Legislative Committee on Appropriations.Scannell's New Jersey First Citizens, 1919-1920. J.J. Scannell, 1919. Whitney won the Republican nomination for Governor of New Jersey in 1925 over former Attorney General Thomas F.

Moore ran on a \\"wet\\" anti-Prohibition platform against Whitney, who had the support of the Anti-Saloon League. The Republican campaign focused on the undue influence of Democratic party boss Frank Hague in state government. Though Moore carried only three of the state's 21 counties, Hague secured a sizable plurality of nearly 104,000 votes in his home county of Hudson, thus ensuring Whitney's defeat.Biography of A. Harry Moore (PDF), New Jersey State Library. After his defeat in the gubernatorial race, Whitney retired to private life in Mendham Borough. In 1938 he and his wife, the former Florence Wyckoff, deeded the historic Phoenix House to the Borough of Mendham for use as a borough hall and community house. He died at his Mendham home in 1942 at the age of 71.

After the tour, The Echoes disbanded with Tony Oakman, George Staff, Peter Oakman, Bert Crome returning to Joe Brown as his group, The Bruvvers. Later Peter Oakman would go on to play bass for Lonnie Donegan, which he did until Donegan's death. Chris Wayne continued to work solo; Dave Burns went to work with Wee Willie Harris in Italy. left centreright 1961 Chris Wayne had another tour, this time with Gene Vincent, so he decided to reform The Echoes. Wayne had a drummer, Laurie Jay, but needed guitar, piano and bass. The Dynamos agreed to do this tour as The Echoes, as they had recently parted from Sonny Stewart. The Dynamos became The Echoes to accompany Gene Vincent when he visited Britain at the beginning of 1961. The line up of this group was Laurie Jay (drums), Tony Collins (guitar), Les Smith (piano) and Douggie Reece (bass). During this tour Tony Collins had a car accident and was unable to continue. For the remainder of the tour he was replaced by Big Jim Sullivan (originally from Marty Wilde's Wildcats, and later musical director for Tom Jones). After such a successful tour, it was decided to continue The Echoes, as with their ability to stand alone as a band and to also play for other artists, plenty of work, including touring, was assured. Les Smith (piano) left the group after the tour to continue his career as an architect. His replacement was Ian Hines (piano), brother of Frazer Hines who played Jamie in the Doctor Who television series. Tony Collins (guitar) was unable to continue due to the car accident, so interim guitarists Billy Kuy (ex-Mike Berry & The Outlaws) and Vic Briggs (later with Eric Burdon & The Animals) were used until a permanent guitarist could be found. This was Dave Burns who had just returned from Italy and was also a founder member of the original group. Ian Hines (piano) went to work in Hamburg and was replaced in 1961 by Perry Ford, a talented musician/singer/songwriter. Perry left in early 1962 to pursue his own career. He would have his own hits a few years later with The Ivy League. Ian Hines returned from Hamburg and came back to the group 1962 for a short while. On New Year's Eve in 1961, The Echoes accompanied Bert Weedon on the television show Sunday Night at the London Palladium. After this appearance The Echoes were approached by Vox who eventually sponsored them from 1962 until 1971 with all the group equipment. left at The Crescent Pavilion Theatre Isle of Man in 1962 1962 The Echoes had one last show to do on The Jerry Lee Lewis tour at The Tower Ballroom, New Brighton, playing for Jerry Lee Lewis, when Laurie Jay left the group. A drummer was needed that night, so a local drummer was brought in; this was Ringo Starr who had just returned from Hamburg playing for Rory Storm and The Hurricanes. Laurie Jay went into management, later becoming the manager for Billy Ocean and Shirley Bassey. On returning to London, Tommy Frost then became The Echoes' new drummer. After this tour Ian Hines also left for Hamburg again, and was replaced by Ray Murray on keyboards. In May 1962, The Echoes line up at this time was: Dave Burns (guitar), Tommy Frost (drums), Ray Murray (keyboards), and Douggie Reece (bass). September 1963 After 18 months of work, recording and a summer season (1962) on the Isle of Man, and another in Jersey (1963), some of the band members decided to pursue their own dreams. Dave Burns went on to form a duo with his wife. Tommy Frost decided to stay in Jersey for a while. Pete Clifford from the Jesters took Dave Burns' place on guitar. Shortly after the group returned to London, Ray Murray left to go back to Scotland. The audition to play for Dusty Springfield was with Douggie Reece (bass), Micky Garrett (organ), Martin Gibbs (stand-in drummer for Tommy Frost) and Pete Clifford (lead guitar). After the audition, Bob Wackett replaced Tommy Frost on drums. Dusty's first Echoes were: Douggie Reece (bass), Micky Garrett (keyboards), Bob Wackett(drums), Pete Clifford (guitar). 1964 Throughout 1964, many shows were done with Springfield (including the tour of Australia with Gerry & the Pacemakers, Gene Pitney, Brian Poole and The Tremeloes), as well as a tour of America, this time with The Searchers and Eden Kane. Bob Wackett stayed with The Echoes until just before the South African tour in December 1964 with Springfield. His replacement was Johnny Dryden. Pete Clifford remained with the Echoes until the end of the Dusty Springfield tour. He then left to join 004 and returned to South Africa. 1965 Both Pete Clifford (guitar) and Micky Garrett (keyboards) then left to form their own group in early 1965. Clifford subsequently played with The 004, Floribunda Rose and The Bats. Their replacements were Vic Briggs (guitar) and Jimmy O'Brien (keyboards). Springfield wanted to add a front line and more rhythm section to the group, so the line-up became Ian Harper (trumpet 1), Derek Andrews (trumpet 2), Derek Wadsworth (trombone), Tony Scott (percussion), Vic Briggs (guitar), Jimmy O'Brien (keyboards), Johnny Dryden (drums), and Douggie Reece (bass). All the backing vocals were done by the group at this time. Later Springfield got a female vocal group for most of the big shows. These singers included Madeline Bell, Kiki Dee, Lesley Duncan, Kay Garner, plus many others. In 1965, Peter Wolf replaced Johnny Dryden on drums, and in 1966 Gary Boyle replaced Vic Briggs, who left to join The Steampacket. In June‚ÄìJuly 1965, The Echoes, along with Doris Troy and Madeline Bell, backed Springfield on her second album, Ev'rything's Coming Up Dusty, released in October 1965. 1966 The line-up became Gary Boyle (guitar), Jimmy O'Brien (keyboards), Peter Wolf (drums) and Douggie Reece (bass), whilst still retaining the brass section, percussion and vocal group. During the year The Echoes played at The Piper Club in Rome. After this booking Jimmy O'Brien resigned being replaced by Mike O'Neil on keyboards. Mike O'Neil was formerly Nero from the group Nero and the Gladiators. Mike O'Neil only stayed a short time, as did John Marsh. Gary Boyle left The Echoes and replaced Vic Briggs position in The Steampacket when Briggs joined The Animals. Gary Boyle went on to form the jazz fusion band, Isotope. Stuart Taylor became The Echoes guitarist. John Marsh left to join another group. Don Shinn then became The Echoes keyboard player. 1967 The line-up then consisted Stuart Taylor (guitarist), Don Shinn (keyboards), Peter Wolf (drums) and Douggie Reece (bass), still with the brass section, percussion and vocal group. During late 1966 through to 1967 The Echoes were doing work with Lulu. It was in July, together with Lulu, that they were the support act for The Monkees at Wembley Empire Pool Stadium. The Echoes also playing for The Monkees solo spots during the concert. Don Shinn left later that year and formed his own band The Shinn. He was replaced by Ivan Chandler on keyboards. Stuart Taylor left the group, replaced by Paul Hodgeson on guitar. 1968 Ivan Chandler (keyboards) was only with the band for a short time, subsequently joined Oedipus Complex and Daddy Longlegs groups, later becoming a record producer in England. Chandler's replacement was Chris Sparrow on (keyboards) he also recorded the lead vocal on \\"Searching for You Baby\\" while he was with the band. He left The Echoes at the end of Herman Hermits Amen Corner tour replaced by Brian Bennett on (Keyboards). In June 1968, The Echoes complete with the brass section, were on the Herman Hermits tour with The Amen Corner, Paper Dolls and John Rowles. The Echoes opened the second half and played back up for John Rowles. During the tour Rowles asked if he could use the Echoes when they were available when not playing with Springfield. He had just had a number two hit and needed a group for many of the bookings he had coming up. This was convenient as Springfield was cutting back on her live performances. This offer was accepted and they went on to tour with Rowles later that year, playing with him until 1970. The Echoes started backing Rowles with Douggie Reece as his musical director. Being the bass player and leader of The Echoes meant the group had to use another bass player when Douggie Reece had other commitments to John Rowles. Some of The Echoes were offered the job of playing in the band for Hair at The Shaftesbury Theatre in London's West End, when it opened on 27 September 1968, and Peter Woolf, Paul Hodgeson, and Brian Bennett left The Echoes to play in the band for Hair. Later Bennett became musical director for the Hair touring company. The fact that Woolf, Hodgeson, Bennett and the brass section chose to play in the Hair band left Reece with a dilemma, as The Echoes were still committed to many bookings. To fulfil these, other members were found. They were Rod Stone (guitar), Tweed Harris (keyboards) both from an Australian group The Groove, plus Don Burrell (drums) and Douggie Reece (bass). Picking up the brass players from the local musicians. From 1962 to 1968, The Echoes recorded seven singles in their own right. Some of the artists with whom The Echoes played for were: Bobby Allen, The Allisons, The Bachelors, Madeline Bell, Tommy Bruce, Freddy Cannon, The Caravelles, The Chantelles, Michael Cox, Rolly Daniels, Kiki Dee, Terry Dean, Vince Eager, Dick Emery, The Four Seasons, Johnny Gentle, Julie Grant, Rolf Harris, Frankie Howerd, Eden Kane, Jerry Lee Lewis, Lulu, Susan Maughan, The Monkees, Matt Monro, The Mudlarks, Des O'Connor, Roy Orbison, Paper Dolls, Gene Pitney, Duffy Power, Johnny Preston, Mike Preston, Joan Regan, Danny Rivers, John Rowles, Paul and Barry Ryan, Terry Scott, Screaming Lord Sutch, Helen Shapiro, Dee Dee Sharp, Anne Shelton, Dusty Springfield, Cat Stevens, Vince Taylor, Norma Tanega, Conway Twitty, Ricky Valance, Bobby Vee, Gene Vincent, Bert Weedon, David Whitfield and Mark Wynter. 1969‚Äì1971 With the new musicians in The Echoes they were able to complete all the work they had. The upside to this arrangement was that Rod Stone and Tweed Harris were still able to play with The Groove, and Don Burrell other gigs he had as well as with John Rowles. There were still a few commitments that The Echoes had which they managed to fulfil. These included a cruise that they did with The Chantells, but only a trio was included which comprised Ian Heinz (keyboard), Peter Curtin (drums) and Douggie Reece (bass). Early in 1971, The Echoes were disbanded. In April that year, Reece married Wendy Cook from the Australian female vocal group Marcie and The Cookies. Later that year they went to live in Melbourne, Australia, and Reece went on to become an arranger, music and record producer and for many years played in The Burlington Lodge Group.

Red seal trade A 1634 Japanese Red seal ship. Tokyo Naval Science Museum. portolan sailing map, depicting the Indian Ocean and the East Asian coast, early 17th century. Around 56 Red seal ships to Siam are recorded between 1604 and 1635.According to Boxer (p.264) 37 read seal passports are known for Siam, plus a few other ones for the states of Patani and Pahang. By around 1620, the trade between Siam and Japan was larger than the total trade of Siam with all other nations.Tarling, p. 7. A Japanese colony was established in Siam. The colony was active in trade, particularly in the export of deer-hide and sappan wood to Japan in exchange for Japanese silver and Japanese handicrafts (swords, lacquered boxes, high-quality papers). From Siam, Japan was interested in purchasing Chinese silks, as well as deerskins and ray or shark skins (used to make a sort of shagreen for Japanese sword handles and scabbards).Boxer, p.293 The Japanese were noted by the Dutch for challenging the trade monopoly of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), as their strong position with the King of Siam typically allowed them to buy at least 50% of the total production, leaving small quantities of a lesser quality to other traders. The king of Siam sent numerous embassies to Japan: in 1621, an embassy led by Khun Pichitsombat and Khun Prasert, in 1623 by Luang Thongsamut and Khun Sawat, and in 1626 by Khun Raksasittiphon. Letters from King Songtham praise the relationship between the two countries: The sh≈çgun responded in similar terms: Japanese community in Siam The Japanese quarter in Ayutthaya is indicated at the bottom center (\\"Japonois\\") of the map. The Japanese quarters of Ayutthaya were home to about 1,500 Japanese inhabitants (some estimates run as high as 7,000). The community was called Ban Yipun in Thai, and was headed by a Japanese chief nominated by Thai authorities.Ishii Yoneo. \\"Siam and Japan in pre-modern times: a note on mutual images\\". In Denoon, p. 154. It seems to have been a combination of traders, Christian converts (\\"Kirishitan\\") who had fled their home country to various Southeast Asian countries following the persecutions of Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu, and unemployed former samurai who had been on the losing side at the battle of Sekigahara. Padre Ant√≥nio Francisco Cardim recounted having administered sacrament to around 400 Japanese Christians in 1627 in the Thai capital of Ayuthaya (\\"a 400 japoes christaos\\") There were also Japanese communities in Ligor and Patani.Boxer, p.297 The Japanese colony was highly valued for its military expertise, and was organized under a \\"Department of Japanese Volunteers\\" (Krom Asa Yipun) by the Thai king. Contacts with other communities were not always smooth: in 1614, men of the English East India Company killed eight Japanese in a fight in the city of Ayutthaya.  Yamada Nagamasa (1612‚Äì1630)  Portrait of Yamada Nagamasa c.1630. A Japanese adventurer, Yamada Nagamasa, became very influential and ruled part of the kingdom of Siam (Thailand) during that period. He settled in the kingdom of Ayutthaya (modern-day Thailand) from around 1612 and became the ruler of the Nakhon Si Thammarat province in southern Thailand.  William Adams (1614 and 1615)  William Adams traded between Japan and Southeast Asia, including Siam. The English adventurer William Adams (1564‚Äì1620) who was based in Japan, led several trading ventures between Japan and Siam. Tenjiku Tokubei (1627‚Äì1630) Tenjiku Tokubei, 17th- century painting.

(\\"Tokubei sailed away on unknown seas to India and returned with wealth greater than that of a daimyo, many strange tales to relate...\\") Limitation of relations between Siam and Japan Following Yamada's death in 1630, the new ruler and usurper king of Siam Prasat Thong (1630‚Äì1655) sent an army of 4000 soldiers to destroy the Japanese settlement in Ayutthaya, but many Japanese managed to flee to Cambodia. A few years later in 1633, returnees from Indochina were able to re-establish the Japanese settlement in Ayutthaya (300‚Äì400 Japanese). From 1634, the sh≈çgun, informed of these troubles and what he perceived as attacks on his authority, refused to issue further Red Seal ship permits for Siam. Desirous to renew trade however, the king of Siam sent a trading ship and an embassy to Japan in 1636, but the embassies were rejected by the sh≈çgun. Japan was concomitantly closing itself to the world at that time, essentially to protect itself from Christianity, initiating the \\"Closed Country\\", or Sakoku, period. The Dutch took over a large part of the lucrative Siam-Japan trade from that time on. =Continuing trade= More embassies would be sent by Thailand to Japan, in 1656 during the reign of King Chaiyaracha and in 1687 during the reign of King Narai. Although Japan was closing itself to trade (especially with Western countries, except for the Dutch Republic), many Siamese junks continued to visit Japan: between 1647 to 1700 the arrival of around 130 Siamese ships was recorded in Nagasaki. During the reign of Petracha as many as 30 junks are recorded to have left Ayutthaya for Nagasaki, Japan.Pombejra, Dhivarat na. \\"Ayutthaya at the end of the seventeenth century: was there a shift to isolation?\\" In Reid, p. 266. From 1715, only one Siamese junk per year was allowed, but this was not insignificant compared to what other countries could trade with Japan. =Remaining Japanese communities in Siam= Japanese communities however remained in Siam, and numerous refugees from the persecutions of Christians in Japan also arrived in the country after the promulgation of Ieyasu's interdiction of Christianity in Japan in 1614. The famous Maria Guyomar de Pinha, wife of the Greek adventurer Constantine Phaulkon, who became one of the most influential men in Siam in the end of the 17th century, was half- Japanese. In the second half of the 17th century, the French catholic missionaries in Siam cared for Annamite Christians and Japanese Christian communities in Siam.\\"Siam\\". Catholic Encyclopedia. The Encyclopedia Press (1907-1914). (\\"In 1664 he was joined by Mgr Pallu, Vicar Apostolic of Tong King. Siam, in those days the rendezvous of all commercial enterprise in the East, gave shelter to several hundred Annamite and Japanese Christians who had been expelled or lived there as voluntary exiles on account of persecutions at home.\\") Since the Tokugawa shogunate prohibited Japanese people established abroad to return to Japan, essentially as a protective measure against Christianity, the Japanese communities in Siam were gradually absorbed locally.Tarling, p. 8. Resumption of contacts (19th century) Relations resumed in the 19th century, with the establishment of the Declaration of Amity and Commerce between Japan and Siam in 26 September 1887, during the reigns of two icons of modernization, king Chulalongkorn in Siam and Emperor Meiji in Japan. Numerous Japanese experts were dispatched to Thailand to help modernize the country, in areas such as law, education and sericulture.\\"Japan- Thailand Relations\\". Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (December 2008). Accessed December 3, 2008. World War II: occupation and alliance Siam was allied with Japan during World War II, following numerous pre-war diplomatic exchanges and the beginning of a Japanese invasion of Thailand. The Japanese had won from Phibun a secret verbal promise to support them in an attack on Malaya and Burma. However, the Thai Prime Minister was fickle and he was quite ready to forget this promise if circumstances changed. His government also asked both the British and Americans for guarantees of effective support if Thailand were invaded by Japan. On 8 December 1941, the Japanese invasion of Thailand started at the same time as they invaded Malaya. The Japanese landed about 2,000 troops near Bangkok, and also made landings at Songkla and Prachuab (leading to the Battle of Prachuab Khirikhan).Christian, John L. and Nobutake Ike. \\"Thailand in Japan's Foreign Relations\\". Pacific Affairs, Vol. 15, No. 2 (June 1942), p. 195. Thai troops initially opposed the Japanese invasion, but five hours after it received the Japanese ultimatum, the Thai cabinet ordered Thai troops to stop firing. Phot Phahonyothin (far left) with Hideki T≈çj≈ç (center) in Tokyo 1942 A Treaty of alliance was signed between Thailand and Japan on December 21, 1941, and on January 25, 1942 Thailand declared war on the United States and Great BritainKratoska, p. 197.Kratoska, p. 203. But Pridi Phanomyong acting as Regent for the absent King Ananda Mahidol refused to sign the declaration and the Thai ambassador to Washington, Seni Pramoj, refused to deliver it. Seni organized the Seri Thai resistance movement, under direction of Pridi in the regency office. Meanwhile, Japan stationed 150,000 troops on Thai soil. As the war dragged on, the Japanese increasingly dealt with Thailand as a conquered territory rather than as an ally. Though the United States had not officially declared war, on 26 December 1942, US Tenth Air Force bombers based in India launched the first major bombing raid that damaged Bangkok and other targets and caused several thousand casualties. Public opinion and, even more important, the sympathies of the civilian political elite, moved perceptibly against Phibun's alliance with Japan. By March 1944, Phibun was making arrangements with the Chinese Chungking Army in Yunnan to fight against the losing Japanese.Kratoska, p. 209. Modern times Abhisit Vejjajiva, Prime Minister of Thailand, with Yukio Hatoyama, Prime Minister of Japan, in 2009. Japan has become again a key trading partner and foreign investor for Thailand. Japan is Thailand's largest supplier, followed by the United States. Since 2005, the rapid ramp-up in export of automobiles of Japanese makes (esp. Toyota, Nissan, Isuzu) has helped to dramatically improve the trade balance, with over 1 million cars produced last year. As such, Thailand has joined the ranks of the world's top ten automobile exporting nations. In 2007, a Japan-Thailand Economic Partnership Agreement was signed, aiming at free trade between the two countries after a transition period of 10 years.

In 1971, Michael Brown and Ian Lloyd formed Stories. They released two albums (Stories and About Us) with a handful of Billboard Top 100 charting singles. Brown left before the band recorded their third (and final) album, Traveling Underground, which was released under the name, Ian Lloyd and Stories, and included the Billboard #50 hit \\"Mammy Blue\\". After Stories, he pursued a solo career, with six albums to his credit. Lloyd has performed with numerous recording artists, assuming the role of a session musician. His long discography of work includes background vocal work with artists such as Foreigner, Billy Joel, Peter Frampton, and Yes. Lloyd continues to record, perform, and write, his most recent release being \\"Everybody's Happy 'Cause It's Christmas Time\\". Stories Although Lloyd was classically trained on both piano and violin, he first reached international acclaim as lead singer for the band Stories, formed with Michael Brown of the Left Banke in the early 1970s. Lloyd sang lead on Stories' songs like \\"I'm Coming Home\\" (played as an anthem during the return of the Iranian hostages), \\"Mammy Blue\\" and \\"Brother Louie\\". A re-recorded version of the latter with Lloyd on vocals is used as the theme song for the comedy series Louie starring Louis CK. Rolling Stone praised Lloyd's songwriting, saying he displayed \\"a lyricist's most essential gift ‚Äî the ability to produce a verbal approximation of the music's ambiance.\\". As a solo artist After a successful run, Stories disbanded and Lloyd pursued a solo career. His albums were well received, in particular his 1976 eponymous debut. 1979's Goose Bumps produced the hit \\"Slip Away\\", written by Ric Ocasek of The Cars. 1980's Third Wave Civilization included Lloyd's version of Bryan Adams' 1983 hit \\"Straight from the Heart\\". As a backing vocalist As a backup singer, Lloyd worked with numerous major recording artists, most notably Foreigner, who used Lloyd's vocals on hits like \\"Feels Like the First Time\\", \\"Cold as Ice\\", \\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\\", \\"Juke Box Hero\\", and \\"Double Vision\\". Lloyd can also be heard on Billy Joel‚Äôs \\"I Go to Extremes\\", as well as tracks by Yes, Peter Frampton, Survivor, and Ian McDonald. The Ian Lloyd Band and Social Hero In addition to projects of his own, Ian Lloyd has been a member of New York rock act Social Hero since 1998, performing alongside his son, frontman David Lloyd. He contributed vocals to Social Hero's first album, The Famous, released in 2009. . Lloyd continues to reside in New York City. His group, the Ian Lloyd Band, is composed of Ian Lloyd, David Lloyd (Keyboards+backing vocals), Matt Grossman/Dan Natelli (guitars), Antti Janhunen (bass), and Jon Ihle (drums). In addition to their own material, their repertoire consists of Stories' music and songs from LLoyd's solo catalogue. 2015 Tour with The Left Banke On March 18, 2015, it was announced that Ian Lloyd would be joining his Stories bandmate Michael Brown's former group, The Left Banke, which included George Cameron, on a 2015 co-headline tour in North America. The Left Banke's original lead singer Steve Martin Caro never rejoined the touring version of the band as was advertised. Lloyd performs a mixture of solo material and classic material from his time with Stories. Other work He wrote songs for Elkie Brooks's 1975 album, Rich Man's Woman. He also sang on a re-recording of \\"Brother Louie\\" for Louis C.K.'s TV series \\"Louie\\". DiscographyAlbums= Solo Albums * 1976 Ian Lloyd (Polydor) * 1979 Goose Bumps (Scotti Bros.

He was widely influential in late 17th-century Russia with his treatise on composition, A Musical Grammar, of which the earliest surviving version dates from 1677. Diletsky's followers included Vasily Titov. Life A sample page from Idea grammatiki musikiyskoy (Moscow, 1679). Click image for details. Little is known about Diletsky's life. A remark by Ioannikii Trofimovich Korenev, a fellow theorist who describes him as a resident of Kiev, is considered evidence of Diletsky's Ukrainian origins. Korenev's statement is probably reliable, as he and Diletsky apparently were well acquainted.Jensen 1992, 310. However, the date and even the year of birth are not known, and no details on Diletsky's early life have surfaced. He must have moved to Vilnius before 1675, because that year his Toga zlota (\\"The golden toga\\") was published there. The text is now lost, but it is known that it was written in Polish, and the surviving title pageJensen 1992, 311. indicates that it was probably a panegyrical pamphlet.Jensen, Grove. Some sources indicate that he wrote at least one other musical treatise while in Vilnius, which is now lost:Jensen 1992, 309. this treatise is first mentioned in Grammatika musikiyskago peniya (1677), and the Idea grammatikii musikiiskoi (1679) is described as a translation of the Vilnius work in its title page. After Vilnius, Diletsky lived in Smolensk, where in 1677 the first surviving version of his magnum opus, Grammatika musikiyskago peniya (\\"A grammar of musical song\\"), was written. He then moved to Moscow, where the subsequent two versions of the work appeared in 1679 and 1681. Nothing further is known about Diletsky's life, and it is generally assumed that he died shortly afterwards. His date of birth is projected from this hypothesis.Jensen 1992, 310: \\"Oleksandra Tsalai-Iakimenko and Oleksandr Zelin'skii, \\"'More neprebrannoe' (Novoznaidenii avtograf tvoru Mikoli Dilets'koho),\\" Zhovten' no. 7 (1966): 109‚Äì116, suggested that Diletskii died in the third decade of the 18th century, based on their belief that Muzei ukrainskoho mistetstva 87/510804, dated 1723, is an autograph. They propose a correspondingly later birth date, in the 1650s. This hypothesis, taken up in their later works, was refuted in Vladimir Goshovskii and I.A. Durnev, \\"K sporu o Diletskom,\\" Sovetskaia muzyka no. 9 (1967): 138.\\" Work Circle of fifths in Idea grammatikii musikiyskoy (Moscow, 1679) Although several of his compositions survive, Diletsky's fame rests chiefly on his composition treatise, Grammatika musikiyskago peniya (A Grammar of Music[al Singing]), which was the first of its kind in Russia. The three surviving versions bear different names, but the content is roughly the same with some important differences.Jensen 1992, 307. The treatise is in two parts. The first teaches the rudiments of music theory, \\"relying heavily on Western terminology and theoretical precepts, especially the hexachord\\", and the second teaches composition of a cappella concertos, a genre that came to Russia through Ukraine and of which Diletsky was one of the first exponents. Diletsky provides a wide variety of examples, both from his own work, including an 8-voice setting of the Divine Liturgy that he composed in Smolensk specifically to illustrate the Grammatika,Jensen 1992, 312. and from that of contemporary Western composers, particularly the Poles Marcin Mielczewski and Jacek R√≥zycki. Apart from the tremendous influence it had on subsequent generations of Russian church composers, the Grammatika is of particular interest for having the first known description of the circle of fifths, one that antedates Western examples by several decades.Jensen, Grove. Johann David Heinichen described the circle of fifths in a 1728 treatise.

The institution is celebrating its 60th anniversary in 2020. The school is one of the top 3 choices for PEP exams and is widely considered to be a prominent educational facility due to its numerous top placements in academics for the Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) and the Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations (CAPE).  History In 1960 , with one hundred and one first form students and a faculty of four Jesuit Fathers, the new school opened its doors and the first lessons were given that day in a pavilion and in classrooms borrowed from Campion Hall Preparatory School. The Jesuit faculty residence was the former residence of the Jesuit Superior of the Island, Campion House. Campion Hall had been founded in January 1940 when Rt. Reverend Thomas A. Emmet, S.J.,D.D., was Vicar Apostolic of Jamaica and V. Reverend Thomas J. Feeney, S.J. was Superior. It began on the premises of St. George's College but moved to Roslyn Hall at 115 Old Hope Road on 6 January 1942. To make room for the growing needs of Campion College, it graduated its last class in December 1962, just as twenty-two years earlier it had taken in its first students to supply the needs of St. George's College. Campion House, the former Superior's residence at 105 Hope Road, was the property of Mr. Roy Lindo before it and the large adjoining field were sold to the Society of Jesus. Ground was broken on 26 August 1960 for a ¬£20,000 (British Currency) two-storey structure of eight classrooms with an accommodation for 240 pupils. It was designed by McMorris & Sibley, Architects, and erected by the firm of Ivan D. Arscott. It was formally blessed on Monday, 20 March 1961 by the Rt. Reverend John J. McEleny, S.J.,D.D., Bishop of Kingston, and was dedicated to the memory of Mr. Martin A. Waters of Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A., whose bequest along with other benefactors made the erection possible. In addition to Waters Hall and to the West of it, a second new building was erected. The 15,000 pound Science Block has laboratories and classrooms for Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Its construction, supervised by Leonard I. Change, was finished in December 1963 and opened for use in January 1964. The formal dedication and opening took place on Monday 24, February 1964, when it was blessed by V. Rev. John V. O'Conner, S.J., New England Provincial of the Society of Jesus.  Spirit  Motto = The school's full motto is \\"Fortes in Fide et Opere\\" (Steadfast in Faith and Good Works) = Patron saint = The school is named after the Catholic martyr Edmund Campion, executed for his faith at Tyburn in London on 1 December 1581. = Houses = Apart from the school's patron saint, they recognize six noble Jesuits as their House names. They are: Loyola , Xavier , Gonzaga , Regis , Kostka , and Bellarmine .  Activities, sports, service  The school sponsors circa 60 clubs and societies and 15 different sports, including participation in all national sports competitions. A service project is required each term from each of the clubs, besides the following specifically service-oriented groups: Interact Club (branch of Rotary International), Ministry Outreach Group (visits indigent elderly), tutoring for primary school students, Teens for Change (mentoring at boys home), St. Anne's Programme (tutoring inner-city youth).

In 2003, the South Aral Sea itself split into eastern and western basins, the Eastern Sea and the West Aral Sea, connected by a narrow channel (channel bed at an elevation of ) that balanced surface levels but did not allow mixing, and in 2005 the North Aral Sea was dammed to prevent the collapse of its fisheries, cutting off the only remaining inflow to the southern lakes. In 2008, the Eastern Sea split again, and in May 2009 had almost completely dried out, leaving only the small permanent Barsakelmes Lake between the Northern and Western Seas and increasing the expanse of the Aralkum desert. In 2010, it was partially filled again by meltwater, and by 2014 was once again dry. The West Aral Sea has some replenishment from groundwater in the northwest, and so is likely to avoid desiccation. Background The Aral Sea began shrinking in the 1960s, when the Soviet Union decided that the two rivers feeding it, the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, would be diverted in order to irrigate cotton and food crops in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. In 1987, due to an accelerated loss of water, the Aral Sea was split into northern and southern parts; the northern part is the current North Aral Sea. Salinity In 2007, the western basin had a salinity of 70 g/l and the eastern basin 100 g/l. Once the water level falls below the connecting channel (elevation 29 m), the salinities can be expected to diverge further. Under current conditions, the eastern basin may receive water from the Amu Darya in wet years, fluctuating in salinity and flooding an area of up to 4500 km¬≤ in salt water to a depth of about one meter, which would preclude any economic activity in the area, while the western basin becomes increasingly saline. Water diversion from the Amu Darya directly to the deeper western basin could lower its salinity enough to allow resumption of local fisheries, while allowing the eastern basin to desiccate almost entirely and avoiding the problems of flooding.\\"The rehabilitation of the ecosystem and bioproductivity of the Aral Sea under conditions of water scarcity\\" (rev. August 2007) Current situation The West Aral Sea is expected to stabilize at , a mean depth of , and a maximum depth of , assuming groundwater discharge at the rate of per year.Peter O. Zavialov, 2005, Physical oceanography of the dying Aral Sea, p 112 The Eastern Sea dried up completely in the summer of 2009, apart from the small permanent Barsakelmes Lake (between the Northern and Western seas), but it received some water from snow melt in the spring of 2010. It is expected to alternate between complete desiccation in the summers and the occasional flood from the Amu Darya or spillover from the dam holding back the North Aral Sea, though a second dike, begun in 2010, may reduce the incidence of the latter.

After suspecting that the Semiramis hotel was one of two Arab headquarters in Katamon, the Haganah planted a bomb there on the night of 5‚Äì6 January 1948. The mission was carried out by a team consisting of four men supported by ten riflemen.Lapierre and Collins, 1972, pp. 128‚Äì133. The explosion killed 24 or 26 civilians including at least one child. Among the dead were seven members of the Aboussouan family and Hubert Lorenzo, the 23-year-old son of the proprietor. The Spanish vice-consul, Manuel Allende Salazar, was also killed in the attack.Lapierre and Collins, 1972, pp. 129, 133 The ruins of the Semiramis Hotel after the Haganah bombing According to Associated Press reports at the time a Haganah spokesman said that the Jerusalem hotel attack was executed because \\"the building was an important meeting place of Arab gangs, where arms were distributed to villages in the Jerusalem area.\\" He continued, \\"Unfortunately, we cannot hit at the Arab band's (main) headquarters as it is secreted in a mosque.\\" The attack was harshly condemned by the British authorities,Benny Morris (2003) The Birth Of The Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, Cambridge University Press, p. 103 and David Ben-Gurion sacked Mishael Shaham, the Haganah officer responsible for the Jerusalem sector, replacing him with David Shaltiel. According to John B. Quigley, the hotel was not a military headquarters and the British authorities denounced the attack as the \\"wholesale murder of innocent people.\\"Quigley, 2005, p. 43. Ilan Papp√© and J. Bowyer Bell attribute the bombing to the Irgun.Pappe, 2007, p. 60. Prior to the bombing, the distinctive white jeep of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, commander of Jerusalem's Arab forces, had been seen in the hotel driveway. In O Jerusalem!, Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins write that Mishael Shaham, the Haganah leader who organised the bombing, had been sent to Jerusalem to stop the flow of beleaguered Jews retreating from mixed areas of Jerusalem to the Jewish areas.

Mariology is developed by theologians on the basis not only of Scripture and Tradition but also of the sensus fidei of the faithful as a whole, \\"from the bishops to the last of the faithful\\",Catechism of the Catholic Church, 92 and papal documents have recorded those developments, defining Marian dogmas, spreading doctrines and encouraging devotions within the Catholic Church. Popes have been highly influential for the development of doctrine and the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary. They made decisions not only in the area of Marian beliefs but also Marian practices and devotions. Before the twentieth century, Popes promulgated Marian veneration and beliefs by authorizing new Marian feast days, prayers, initiatives, and special privileges. Since Pope Leo XIII, Popes have promulgated Mariology also with encyclicals, apostolic letters and with two dogmas (Immaculate Conception and Assumption). This article reviews the major official teachings by the popes. Background Historically a Papal bull was \\"an Apostolic letter with a leaden seal.\\"Thurston, Herbert. \\"Bulls and Briefs.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 23 August 2017 A papal bull is an official formal decree. In terms of formality, papal bulls and apostolic constitutions are above encyclicals, followed by apostolic letters. An apostolic constitution is the highest level of decree issued by the Pope, and is generally issued as a bull with the requisite formalities regarding seal and signature. By their nature, apostolic constitutions are addressed to the public, whereas encyclicals are usually addressed to patriarchs, primates, archbishops and bishops in communion with the Holy See.Mann, Stephanie A., \\"What Is a Papal Bull?\\", Our Sunday Visitor, 1 September 2016 DogmasThe perpetual virginity of Mary= * Dominici gregis - This papal bull was issued by Pope Clement VIII on 3 February 1603. It considered Marian piety the basis for Church and condemned a number of issues as errors, including the denial of the virginity of Mary.The mystery of Mary by Paul Haffner 2004 page 120 =Mother of God= This dogma was decided at The Council of Ephesus. This dogma has attached to it the penalty of an anathema. It was promulgated during the Arian Heresy who state that Mary was just the \\"Christotokos\\" (Mother of the Christ) rather than the \\"Theotokos\\" (Mother of God) =The Immaculate Conception= * Cum Praeexcelsa, a bull by Sixtus IV, issued 28 February 1476, when plague was ravaging the country, established a Mass and Office for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. * Ubi primum is an encyclical of Pope Pius IX to the bishops of the Catholic Church asking them for opinion on the definition of a dogma on the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. It was issued on 2 February 1849.Pope Pius IX, \\"Ubi primum\\", 2 February 1849, PapalEncyclicals.net * Ineffabilis Deus - In this key papal bull (the title of which means \\"ineffable God\\" in Latin) Pope Pius IX defined ex cathedra the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The decree was promulgated on 8 December 1854, the date of the annual Feast of the Immaculate Conception. The decree surveys the history of the belief, citing its roots in the long-standing feast of the Conception of Mary as a date of significance in the Eastern and Western churches. It also cites the approval of Catholic bishops worldwide who were asked in 1849 to offer their opinion on the matter. (The decree had been preceded by the encyclical Ubi Primum of 2 February 1849 whereby Pius IX solicited the opinions of the bishops of the Catholic Church regarding defining dogma. Coat of arms of Pius X * Ad diem illum - This encyclical by Pope Pius X on the Immaculate Conception, was given on 2 February 1904, in the first year of his Pontificate. It was issued in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. It is an important document because it explains the Mariology of Pope Pius X. One of the reasons the pope gave for writing the encyclical was his desire for the restoration of all things in Christ which he had defined as his motto Instaurare omnia in Christo: to restore everything in Christ, to whom there is no safer or more direct road than Mary.Pope Pius X. Ad diem Illum, ¬ß7, 2 February 1904, Libreria Editrice Vaticana * Fulgens corona - This encyclical by Pope Pius XII was issued on 8 September 1953 on the Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The encyclical proclaimed a Marian year for 1954, to commemorate the centenary of the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. Fulgens corona is significant as it contained the Mariological methodology of Pope Pius XII and his views on limits and challenges of Roman Catholic Mariology. Pope Pius XII, Fulgens corona, 8 September 1953, Libreria Editrice Vaticana =The Assumption= * Deiparae Virginis Mariae (1 May 1946) - an encyclical of Pope Pius XII to all Catholic bishops on the possibility of defining the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary as a dogma of faith.McNally, Terrence, What Every Catholic Should Know about Mary page 113 * Munificentissimus Deus This Apostolic constitution (the title of which means \\"most bountiful God\\" in Latin) was issued by Pope Pius XII on 1 November 1950. It defines ex cathedra the dogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It is the second ex-cathedra infallible statement ever made by a Pope, the first since the official ruling on Papal Infallibility was made at the First Vatican Council (1869-1870). Following the example of Pius IX, Pope Pius XII issued the encyclical Deiparae Virginis Mariae on issued on 1 May 1946 to all Catholic bishops on the possibility of defining the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary as a dogma of faith.

It was given on 15 September, (the Feast of the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin Mary), 1951. The encyclical states that from the beginning of his pontificate, Pope Pius XII entrusted to the Mother of God the destiny of the human family. The Pope strongly supports the idea, that Catholic families should pray the rosary together. Pope Pius XII, Ingruentium malorum , 15 September 1951, Libreria Editrice Vaticana John Paul II Coat of arms with the Marian Cross *Rosarium Virginis Mariae - This Apostolic Letter by Pope John Paul II was issued on 16 October 2002. It deals with the Holy Rosary and views it as compendium of the Gospel message: The Rosary, though clearly Marian in character, is at heart a Christocentric prayer. In the sobriety of its elements, it has all the depth of the Gospel message in its entirety, of which it can be said to be a compendium. The letter reaffirms the Roman Catholic beliefs on the power of the rosary and states: Through the Rosary the faithful receive abundant grace, as though from the very hands of the Mother of the Redeemer.Pope John Paul II, Rosarium Virginis Mariae, 16 October 2002, Libreria Editrice Vaticana Sodality of Our Lady *Gloriosae Dominae - by Pope Benedict XIV was issued on 27 September 1748. In this Apostolic Letter Pope Benedict XIV called the Blessed Virgin Mary \\"Queen of heaven and earth,\\" stating that the sovereign King has in some way communicated to her his ruling power. * Bis Saeculari - This Apostolic Constitution Sodality of Our Lady was promulgated by Pope Pius XII on 27 September 1948, the two hundredth anniversary of the Papal bull Gloriosae Dominae of Pope Benedict XIV in 1748. It is important because of the fact that Apostolic constitutions are the highest form of Papal teaching, above encyclicals, and below dogmatization ex cathedra. The Sodality of Our Lady dates to 1584. It consists of associations of persons, sodalists, dedicated to a Christian life, following the model of the Virgin Mary. In Bis Saeculari, Pope Pius XII pointed to the importance of the Sodality of Our Lady within the Church, which after four hundred years exists in all countries. It has produced virtuous lives among the faithful, priests and saints. It continues to prepare women and men to be active in modern society.Bis Saeculari 13 Other documents * Signum Magnum - an Apostolic exhortation by Pope Paul VI issued My 13, 1967 on consecration to the Blessed Virgin Mary.Pope Paul VI, Signum Magnum, 13 May 1967, Libreria Editrice Vaticana *Marialis Cultus - Pope Paul VI issued this Apostolic exhortation on 2 February 1974. The letter is subtitled, For the Right Ordering and Development of Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary.

Vatican during the Savoyard era describes the relation of the Vatican to Italy, after 1870, which marked the end of the Papal States, and 1929, when the papacy regained autonomy in the Lateran Treaty, a period dominated by the Roman Question. Background In the years that followed the revolutions of 1848, Italian nationalists ‚Äì both those who wished to unify the country under the Kingdom of Sardinia and its ruling House of Savoy and those who favored a republican solution ‚Äì saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as Emperor Napoleon III, tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other. After the Austro-Sardinian War of 1859, much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi led a revolution that overthrew the Bourbon monarchy in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to Latium, the immediate neighborhood of Rome. Rome was declared Capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital Turin in Piemonte. However, the Italian government could not take possession of its capital because Napoleon III kept a French garrison in Rome protecting Pope Pius IX. The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the Franco-Prussian War began in July 1870. Emperor Napoleon III had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the battle of Sedan, widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian government take Rome. King Victor Emmanuel II sent Count Gustavo Ponza di San Martino to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. End of the Papal States According to Raffaele De Cesare: > The Pope's reception of San Martino [10 September 1870] was unfriendly. Pius > IX. allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King's letter upon > a table, he exclaimed, \\"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited > sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters > received from the King. After, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \\"I am no > prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\\" > San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.De Cesare, p. 444 On 10 September, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General Raffaele Cadorna, crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the Aurelian Walls on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. On 20 September, the Bersaglieri entered Rome and marched down Via Pia, which was subsequently renamed Via XX Settembre. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a plebiscite. In Chapter XXXIV, De Cesare also made the following observations: *\\"The Roman question was the stone tied to Napoleon's feet‚Äîthat dragged him into the abyss. He never forgot, even in August, 1870, a month before Sedan, that he was sovereign of a Catholic country, that he had been made Emperor, and was supported by the votes of the Conservatives and the influence of the clergy; and that it was his supreme duty not to abandon the Pontiff.\\"De Cesare, p. 440 *\\"For twenty years Napoleon III. had been the true sovereign of Rome, where he had many friends and relations... Without him the temporal power would never have been reconstituted, nor, being reconstituted, would have endured.\\"De Cesare, p. 443 This event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the Leonine City on the west bank of the Tiber, but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the Quirinal Palace, had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a self-proclaimed \\"prisoner\\", refusing to leave or to set foot in St. Peter's Square, and forbidding (Non Expedit) Catholics under pain of excommunication to participate in elections in the new Italian state. In October, a plebiscite in Rome and the surrounding Campagna resulted in a vote for union with the Kingdom of Italy. Pius IX refused to accept this act of force majeure. He remained in his palace, describing himself as a prisoner in the Vatican. However, the new Italian control of Rome did not wither, nor did the Catholic world come to the Pope's aid as Pius IX had expected. The provisional capital of Italy had been Florence since 1865. In 1871, the Italian government moved to the banks of the Tiber. Victor Emmanuel installed himself in the Quirinal Palace. Rome became once again, for the first time in thirteen centuries, the capital city of a united Italy. Rome was unusual among capital cities only in that it contained the power of the Pope and a small parcel of land (Vatican City) beyond national control. This anomaly was not formally resolved until the Lateran pacts of 1929. Last years of Pius IX Pope Pius spent the last eight years of his long pontificate ‚Äì the longest in Church history ‚Äì as prisoner of the Vatican. Catholics were forbidden to vote or be voted in national elections. However, they were permitted to participate in local elections, where they achieved successes.Schmidlin, p. 119 Pius himself was active during those years, by creating new diocesan seats and appointing bishops to numerous dioceses which had been unoccupied for years. Asked if he wanted his successor to follow his Italian policies, the old pontiff replied: > My successor may be inspired by my love to the Church and my wish, to do the > right thing. Everything changed around me. My system and my policies had > their time; I am too old to change direction. This will be the task of my > successor.Schmidlin, p. 109 Pope Leo XIII In 1882, Pope Leo XIII wrote to the Austrian emperor Franz Josef I to move the papacy to Salzburg or Trieste. Pope Leo XIII, considered a great diplomat, managed to improve relations with Russia, Prussia, Germany, France, England and other countries. However, in light of a hostile anti- Catholic climate in Italy, he continued the policies of Pius IX towards Italy, without major modifications.Schmidlin, p. 409 He had to defend the freedom of the Church against Italian persecutions and attacks in the area of education, expropriation and violation of Catholic churches, legal measures against the Church and brutal attacks, culminating in anticlerical groups attempting to throw the body of the deceased Pope Pius IX into the Tiber river on 13 July 1881.Schmidlin, p. 413 The Pope even considered moving the papacy to Trieste or Salzburg, two cities in Austria, an idea which the Austrian monarch Franz Josef I gently rejected.Schmidlin, p. 414 Recovery of papal prestige Paradoxically, the eclipse of papal temporal power during the 19th century was accompanied by a recovery of papal prestige. The monarchist reaction in the wake of the French Revolution and the later emergence of constitutional governments served alike, though in different ways, to sponsor that development. The reinstated monarchs of Catholic Europe saw in the papacy a conservative ally rather than a jurisdictional rival. Later, when the institution of constitutional governments broke the ties binding the clergy to the policies of royal regimes, Catholics were freed to respond to the renewed spiritual authority of the pope. The popes of the 19th and 20th centuries exercised their spiritual authority with increasing vigor and in every aspect of religious life. By the crucial pontificate of Pope Pius IX (1846‚Äì1878), for example, papal control over worldwide Catholic missionary activity was firmly established for the first time in history.

It is listed on the OMX Stockholm Stock Exchange (Mid Cap), and has an annual turnover of around 4.4 bn SEK. Haldex focuses on brake products, air suspension systems and products to enhance safety for heavy vehicles. The Foundation Brake product line includes brake products for wheel ends such as disc brakes, brake adjusters for drum brakes and actuators. Air Controls comprises products that improve the safety and driving dynamics of the brake system, such as compressed air dryers, valves, ABS and EBS. Haldex production plants The Haldex Landskrona plant Haldex has production plants in the following countries:Haldex Annual Report 2008 - list of production plants * Brazil * China * Germany * Hungary * Mexico * United States * Sweden * India History Haldex early history has two branches ‚Äì Halda Fickurfabrik and Svenska Bromsregulatorer (SAB). Halda Fickurfabrik: The company has its base in Halda Fickurfabrik in Sv√§ngsta, which was founded 1887 by the entrepreneur Henning Hammarlund. When the company went bankrupt in 1920 it was split into two companies. Halda manufactured typewriters in Sv√§ngsta, and Fabriks AB Haldataxametern, which manufactured taximeters in Stockholm. 1922 a group of business men in Halmstad created a company called AB Trafikkontroll, later AB TAKO to manufacture taximeters and other equipment. The company went bankrupt 1927 and was bought by a new company. The new AB TAKO, which was controlled by Fabriks AB Haldataxametern, moved the manufacturing of the taximeters from Stockholm to Halmstad in 1931. The same year the new AB TAKO ended their business. AB Trafikkontroll had started their business on the south side of Halmstad, but was moved in 1026 to a factory on Tollsgatan. 1943 Fabriks AB Haldextaxamtern moved to more modern premises at Kn√§redsgatan. The name was changed in 1944 to Verkstads AB Haldex and was later acquired by SAB. Not until 1985, the whole company changed its name to Haldex. Svenska AB Bromsregulatorer (SAB): 1916 Axel Djurson founded Svenska AB Bromsregulatorer (SAB) in Malm√∂, Sweden. They handed in a patent for an automatic brake adjuster for trains. Over the years, SAB became one of the prominent manufacturers of brake systems for trains. Enoch Thulin and his aeroplane Around this time, the famous aviator Enoch Thulin founded the company Thulinverken in Landskrona, Sweden. They developed and manufactured airplane engines and cars. Thulinverken became an important supplier to SAB and was later acquired by them. The 1960s laid the ground for today's business at Haldex. 1962 SAB started a project to see how they could produce brake adjusters for road vehicles instead of only trains. The result became the brake adjuster which still is the single product with the highest turnover at Haldex. Investments in the US: The company made two acquisitions in the United States since the late 1990s, Midland-Grau in 1998 and Neway/Anchorlok in 2002. Haldex up to 2011: In 1993, Haldex started an extensive project to produce disc brakes for heavy vehicles. During 1999 Haldex delivered their first generation of disc brakes, called ModulX. A second generation, called ModulT, was launched in 2011 and ModulT is today the fastest growing product for Haldex. During the 1990s, Haldex bought the patent for creating the Haldex Coupling from the rally driver Sigvard ‚ÄúSigge‚Äù Johansson and launched the first version in 1998. The company also included the earlier Hesselman Elhydraulik founded by Jonas Hesselman. Among other things, this company manufactured injection pumps for truck engines and it can be found on older trucks by Scania, Volvo, and Tidaholmslastbilar. Hesselman later became the leading producer of hydraulic aggregates located at the lifts at the end of trucks. The product is used this way for handicap buses, as well as within material handling industries. Haldex co-owned (from 2004) the company Alfdex with Alfa Laval, for production of separators for truck engines. Haldex after 2011: In 2011, the Traction division was divested to BorgWarner including the all-wheel drive. The hydraulic division formed a new company called Concentric and was listed on the Stockholm stock exchange. The commercial vehicle division remained as Haldex.  Owners  The biggest owner of Haldex, with 13 percent of the stocks and votes, was earlier Investment AB √ñresund, (later Creades AB). Since the autumn of 2016 the biggest owners are ZF AG and Knorr- Bremse. Public takeover offers On July 14, 2016 a bidding process started that ended in 2017. Three companies have presented three different offers. Knorr-Bremse's offer at 125 SEK per share remains. Knorr-Bremse's bid has a condition stating that they need clearance from all relevant competitive regulators. The offer can be finalized only if and when such clearance has been granted. The Knorr-Bremse bid was deemed an anti-trust situation and invalidated.

The village's coat of arms is a red shield with a bird sitting on the upper of two yellow horizontal bars, each with three short vertical bars (crenellations).Home History The village was settled by people from the now-abandoned village of Bernsrode due, according to tradition, to flooding at Bernsrode. In 1318 the village was the split property of Dietrich von Kerstlingerode and Ehrenfriede von Berlepsch.Rittmarshausen The Rittmarshausen \\"Palace\\" (Das Rittmarsh√§user Schloss) replaced a castle first built in AD 1541 in the early 18th century, being completed in 1716.

The first services weren't held in the church until the early 17th century. Although the village has been predominantly Protestant (Lutheran) since the thirty Years War, a Roman Catholic community exists in the community and has, since 1997, had its own church, serving all twelve Gartetal villages.Rittmarshausen The Garte Gericht (regional court) had its seat in the village until 1839. A brewery was established in the Rittmarshausen Palace in 1852, but production of alcohol was discontinued in the first part of the 20th century. Toward the end of the 19th century, a narrow-gauge railway linking the Gartetal to Goettingen was built. This, the Gartetalbahn, served the city's population‚Äîespecially the students‚Äîas a convenient excursion vehicle to rural Gaststaetten as well as a means for the residents of Rittmarshausen and the villages along the way to get to market in the city. In 1957, passenger service was discontinued, and a year later the beet service ended and the tracks were torn up.Rittmarshausen The train station still stands, currently in private ownership.

He is rarely known because of his hidden identity during his undercover missions of 1673. Early history Gover Jaspes Le Buen was born in Maastricht, Netherlands to Pierre-Janko Le Buen and Marie Croche . Pierre- Janko was born in Rotterdam and Marie was born somewhere between the Holy Roman Empire and Venice. Gover was taught at home by his mother but a spell of tuberculosis took her life somewhere in 1650c. Gover's father, Pierre-Janko then taught Gover French and German to further expand his knowledge abroad. At age 31, Gover was working for a bakery in Maastricht. The Franco-Dutch War In 1672, war broke out between The Netherlands, Spain, The Holy Roman Empire and Brandenburg against France, England, The Archbishopric of Cologne and the Bishopric of Munster. Gover joined the Dutch Army and was assigned to defend Maastricht. In 1673, the French army laid siege to Maastricht. Gover was assigned to remain in the city when the French took over. Knowing their defeat, the Dutch Army retreated to north of Maastricht. The French took over and Gover stayed with others to spy on the French. Whilst hiding out, Gover's commanding officer was shot dead by a French soldier. Gover took lead of his group and managed to soften the French forces by taking over the castle the French had commanded. The Dutch came back and pushed the French out. Post war After the war, Gover stayed at his home of Maastricht. He was still a part of the Dutch garrison and was relieved of his command but still remained within the ranks of the army . At a later time, Gover left the army and stayed home with his wife and children. His wife was then killed during a horse riding accident. Tragedy struck Gover again, when his father was killed in Amsterdam, by a boating accident. Staying at home, Gover began painting for his own needs to beat his darkening depression brought on by the war he fought. Gover began a brief period of baking, but became ill and became bed- ridden. Death On 16 June 1712, Gover died of influenza at his home of Maastricht. His children either married out or never did wed. Gover is buried in his home city of Maastricht. References Davis, Paul K.

Foot- propelled diving birds  Some diving birds - for example, the extinct Hesperornithes of the Cretaceous Period - propelled themselves with their feet. They were large, streamlined, flightless birds with teeth for grasping slippery prey. Today, cormorants (family Phalacrocoracidae), loons (Gaviidae), and grebes (Podicipedidae) are the major groups of foot propelled diving birds.

The oval is located at the corner of Glenmore Road & Hampden Street, Paddington and is named in honour of Victor Trumper. The oval has a long history of catering for Australian Football in the form of NSWFL foundation club, East Sydney, as well as catering for cricket and athletics. A series of walking trails connect surrounding streets. Australian football has been played at this oval since at least 1903. To put this date of 1903 in perspective, Australian football was played on Trumper Oval five years prior to the establishment of the first rugby league competition in Australia and only one year after the establishment of the Hawthorn football club. All the Sydney FL grand finals (bar one) between 1952 and 1977 were played at this venue. Some of the biggest names in Australian football history have played on this oval including Jack Dyer (Richmond vs NSW 1946), Keith Miller (Sydney Naval), Bill Morris (Richmond), Kevin Murray (Fitzroy/East Perth) and John Pitura (North Shore) amongst many others. History Originally named Hampden Park Oval, the ground was built on a reclaimed swamp (Glenmore Brook runs down and under its middle), an old quarry and a garbage dump. It had to be built up by as much as 13 feet in some places in order to turn it into a cricket oval. It was named in honour of Viscount Hampden, Governor of New South Wales (1895‚Äì99) - Hampden Street alongside the park was originally named Ebenezer Street. According to Rob Hillier's 1970 book the three first inhabitants of Paddington: Underwood, Forbes and Cooper - built a Gin Distillery just next to today's Trumper Park. According to Hillier, the teams who had to transport the gin back into the colony along Oxford Street (formerly South Head Road) were \\"winding between trees and outcrops of sandstone, between swamp and firm ground, found the easiest way for the footslogger was through land not yet parcelled out. But any track that opened up the bush was welcome, and once it was established it acted as a frontage for later grants of all sizes and the most incredible shapes. This track was named Glenmore Road and it is still the winding link between Oxford Street and the New South Head Road built in the 1830s along the harbour foreshores.\\" At the opening of the oval there was a great demonstration of community feeling - the owners of produce stores gave bags of potatoes, butchers in the district gave a sheep each, bakers gave bread and grocers gave jams and tea. A bullock was roasted whole and various games were held, including a fancy dress cricket match in which Trumper played. The name of park, and the oval, was changed in 1931 to honour one of Paddington's cricketing heroes, Victor Trumper (1877-1915). The Eastern Suburbs Roosters played a total of 10 first grade NSWRL games at Trumper Oval with 4 games in 1915, another 5 in 1934 and one game against North Sydney in 1941. Current Sporting Teams The oval is currently home to the following sporting groups; * UTS Australian Football Club * Eastern Suburbs Juniors * Eastern Suburbs Little Athletics * Eastern Suburbs Cricket Club * Wentworth Tennis  Stands  In its present configuration the Frank Dixon grandstand is a single, ground-level grandstand. Originally constructed in 1936, the grandstand was reduced in size in the mid-1980s to reflect the current usage.

The study of locally discrete collections is worthwhile as Bing's metrization theorem shows. Formal definition Let X be a topological space. A collection {Ga} of subsets of X is said to be locally discrete, if each point of the space has a neighbourhood intersecting at most one element of the collection. A collection of subsets of X is said to be countably locally discrete, if it is the countable union of locally discrete collections. Properties and examples 1\\\\. Locally discrete collections are always locally finite. See the page on local finiteness. 2\\\\. If a collection of subsets of a topological space X is locally discrete, it must satisfy the property that each point of the space belongs to at most one element of the collection. This means that only collections of pairwise disjoint sets can be locally discrete. 3\\\\. A Hausdorff space cannot have a locally discrete basis unless it is itself discrete. The same property holds for a T1 space. 4\\\\. The following is known as Bing's metrization theorem: A space X is metrizable iff it is regular and has a basis that is countably locally discrete. 5\\\\. A countable collection of sets is necessarily countably locally discrete. Therefore, if X is a metrizable space with a countable basis, one implication of Bing's metrization theorem holds. In fact, Bing's metrization theorem is almost a corollary of the Nagata-Smirnov theorem.

In 1946, just after the reformation of competitive rugby in Wales after the events of the Second World War, the club formed a joint committee with the local cricket club to purchase a playing field. The playing fields would, in 1963, become part of the local Athletics Club. In 2015, Neyland Rugby Football Club turned 130 years old. Five years later, in 2020, the Club celebrated its 135th anniversary year. Club honours In the 2009/10 season, after several years in WRU Division Five West, Neyland were promoted to WRU Division Four West after winning the league. It was an impressive season with the senior team losing only one of the 22 games of the tournament, and scoring more tries than any team across all regions and divisions; a total of 150. Kit Neyland traditionally play in black shirts, with black shorts and black socks. They occasionally wear an alternative kit: a white shirt with black hoops and red sleeves, with black shorts and socks. Rivalries Neyland's main rivals include Milford Haven RFC, Pembroke Dock Harlequins RFC and Llangwm RFC. However, with the Division now much more localised, almost every game is a local derby.

History On June 4, 1985, the FCC granted a construction permit to Muncy Broadcasting Inc. for the creation of a new radio station to broadcast at 1190 kHz with 1,000 watts of power, daytime only. On December 12, 1985, the station was granted a license to cover and begin regular broadcast operations. In January 1988, the station's broadcast license was transferred from Muncy Broadcasting to Pro Marketing, Inc. In May 1989, the license was transferred again from Pro Marketing to Kennedy Broadcasting, Inc. On June 7, 1990, license transfer was consummated once again, this time from Kennedy Broadcasting to North Penn Broadcasting, Inc. In January 1995, North Penn Broadcasting reached a deal to transfer the license to Dame Media, Inc., and the transfer was consummated in July 1995. In August 1998, WRKK was transferred from Dame Media to Clear Channel Communications (acting as Clear Channel Metroplex License Inc.) as part of a 21 station deal. The stock-for-stock deal was publicly valued at $85 million. =Frequency change= On June 25, 1990, the station received a new construction permit to change frequencies from 1190 kHz to 1200 kHz, increase daytime power from 1,000 watts to 10,000 watts, add nighttime service at 250 watts, and make suitable changes in the antenna system to accommodate these changes. This construction permit expired on December 25, 1991. The station was granted a reinstatement of the expired permit in June 1993 but it too would be allowed to expire in December 1993. Another reinstatement was granted in March 1995 and set to expire in September 1995. Several extensions of this permit were granted pushing the expiration date back to May 1996, January 1997, August 1997, and April 1998. In June 1998, the station was granted a minor modification of this permit to correct the coordinates of the transmitter location and to adjust the daytime broadcast pattern but this also extended the permit until December 1998. Finally and after several months of testing, on June 23, 1998, nearly eight years to the day after first being granted the permit, the station received a new license to broadcast at 1200 kHz. =Rock 94.9= On October 1, 2014 WRKK split from its simulcast with news/talk-formatted WRAK (1400 AM) and changed their format to active rock, branded as \\"Rock 94.9\\" (simulcast on FM translator W235BA 94.9 FM).

St George Shrine Pilgrim Centre Kulathuvayal The church named after St. George was established as early as 1941 under the initiative of Rev. Fr. Peediekkal. Janab Moythu Sahib donated of prime land at Kulathuvayal hill top for the new church. The thatched shed for the new church was constructed in no time under the leadership of Rev. Fr. Peediekkal, Rev. Fr. Mathew Kappukattil, and Rev. Fr. John Makkil. It was a modest attempt by the settlers who had been weakened by malampani. Taking a contribution of 25 paise each during prayer meetings had accumulated the necessary money. The cemetery was also established near the church by Rev. Fr. Peediekkal in 1941. In 1943 the church building was reconstructed.

Syro-Malabar Religious Houses In Kulathuvayal 1\\\\. Missionary Sisters of Mary Immaculate (MSMI) Generalate Kulathuvayal The Congregation of the Missionary Sisters Of Mary Immaculate (MSMI) was started by Fr. C.J. Varkey also known as \\"Varkeyachan\\" in 1962. At present, it has 800 professed sisters working in one hundred communities in India, U.S.A. Germany and Italy, engaged with different apostolic activities like teaching, nursing, orphanage, leprosy center, old age homes, family apostolate, social work, pastoral care, prayer and counseling. He was one of the most admired figures in Kerala Church and a leader of the charismatic renewal movement in the state. Monsignor Varkey, popularly known as Varkey Achan (\\"Father\\" Varkey) was based in Kulathuvayal, about 50 kilometers east of Kozhikode town, and for 58 years he worked across four northern districts of Kerala. He came to Kulathuvayal in 1951 when the region was an underdeveloped hill area with no roads, schools or churches. Most Christians in Malabar are migrants. Migration began during the economic Depression of the 1930s and continued for decades. He started the first school in Kulathuvayal in 1954 and encouraged other parishes in the diocese to open schools before building churches. In 1976, Monsignor Varkey started the Malabar region's first charismatic retreat center that now attracts thousands of people. Pope Benedict XVI gave the priest the honorary title of monsignor in 2007 in recognition of his service to the Church. He died on 24 June 2009 at the age of 88.

She was introduced in 1998, but written out in 1999 due to the personal problems of the actress who played her. Nine years later, in 2008, the character was reintroduced, once again played by Clarke, who initially signed a two-month contract. Jackie continued to make sporadic appearances until March 2010. It was confirmed in July 2018, that Tyrone would receive the news that Jackie had died in the coming weeks, ruling out a return for Clarke and an off-screen death for Jackie. Storylines1998‚Äì1999= Liverpudlian Jackie first appeared in March 1998 as the cellmate of Deirdre Rachid (Anne Kirkbride); Jackie was in prison for ABH. Jackie's introduction was part of a high-profile storyline that saw Deirdre framed by her boyfriend and wrongfully imprisoned. Jackie first appeared in a specially constructed prison cell at Granada Studios. Deirdre's conviction was quashed within three weeks and she was released; Jackie soon followed her to the soap's primary setting of Weatherfield on parole, needing a friend to turn to, having been dumped by her partner and left homeless. Jackie moved to the area with her teenage son Tyrone (Alan Halsall), squatting in Curly Watts' (Kevin Kennedy) vacant premises. She became a factory worker for Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), where she had numerous run-ins with Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle) over flirtations with Janice's husband Les Battersby (Bruce Jones). Jackie remained on the show for one year before leaving in the midst of a property feud with Curly, who had returned to Coronation Street to find her formally renting his house. Jackie fled back to Liverpool with her husband Darren (James McMartin), though Tyrone stayed behind as a lodger with Jack (Bill Tarmey) and Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn). =2008‚Äì2018= Tyrone contacted her about his engagement in August 2008. Jackie was living in a nice home with a cat and she claimed to have turned over a New Age leaf, but she was actually only catsitting, and was being menaced by an ex-boyfriend to whom she owed a ¬£1,000 debt. Tyrone and Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns) cashed in their wedding fund to pay her debt. Jackie asked for more money for travel fare, and when they said no, she effectively disowned Tyrone. Soon she went to Tyrone's home in an attempt to see him, but was asked to leave by Molly's aunt Pam Hobsworth (Kate Anthony), as well as Jack Duckworth. Jackie returned again on New Year's Day 2009, ahead of the wedding of Molly and Tyrone. She claimed to be in severe pain due to a ruptured breast implant. When Jack asked her to leave, she faked a fainting spell. Molly looked up the details Jackie had given them and discovered nothing was wrong with her. She still decided to give Jackie another chance, for Tyrone's sake. Her forgiving mood vanished when Jackie showed up at the hen night and quickly got drunk, encouraging Graeme Proctor (Craig Gazey) to do a striptease and groping one of the men hired to serve food until he asked to leave. Pam physically ejected Jackie. Jackie missed the wedding, but, wearing a dark wig, she attended the reception at the Rovers. She was hurt that Tyrone had no kind words for her in his wedding speech. When Jackie revealed herself, Molly once again pledged to give Jackie another chance, for Tyrone's sake. Jackie perked up when she learned the newlyweds had received Eurostar tickets to Paris as a honeymoon gift. She managed to pocket the tickets without anyone noticing. As Jackie crept off into the night, she took one final look at her son and his new wife, a brief hint of pride on her face at the man Tyrone had become. Tyrone's relationship with Molly changed drastically in the year since he had seen his mother. Molly had grown distant and they had split up. Tyrone took the news badly. Jackie learned of this when she called and Jack's new girlfriend Connie Rathbone (Rita May), who knew nothing about Jackie, gave her some details. Jackie immediately returned to see Tyrone, and feeling that he had already lost so much, accepted her. Jackie went round to Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) corner shop and confronted Molly for dumping Tyrone and accused her of cheating on Tyrone. Molly denied it and insulted Jackie, prompting her to knock food off the shelves so Molly threw her out of the shop and fought in the street until Tyrone stepped in. Molly threw flowers at Jackie, and the police told them to stop or they would get involved. Molly then told Tyrone, Jackie started the fight and Tyrone says, 'at least she is fighting for me'. Jack and Connie tried to warn Tyrone about what Jackie was doing in his house but this infuriated him and he threw them out of his house. Jackie told Tyrone that she really did love him even if she had been a useless mother in the past but she was here for him now. Although Jackie seemed to care about her son, she also fell back into old patterns of bringing men back for one night stands. Jackie was coming home when she saw Molly packing up some belongings. Molly insisted she was leaving Weatherfield and Jackie was getting what she wanted, but Jackie was convinced that Molly was burgling the place. She dragged Tyrone home, hoping this would be the last straw for his feelings towards Molly. Instead, Tyrone felt sorry for Molly, and threw Jackie out, telling the cab that Molly had ordered to take Jackie anywhere but where he lived. In July 2018, Tyrone receives news from the police that Jackie has died. In subsequent weeks, it transpires that Jackie and Darren were not Tyrone's biological parents, having found him as a baby outside a police station and registered him as their own, due to Jackie's desire to have children. This leads to Tyrone eventually discovering his long- lost grandmother Evelyn Plummer (Maureen Lipman) in September 2018, where she reveals that his mother and Evelyn's daughter, Cassandra, gave birth to him as a teenager, before leaving for South Africa and dying whilst over there. It later became apparent that Cassandra had intense drug addiction issues, and Evelyn left Tyrone outside the police station in order to help Cassandra get clean. Creation and developmentPersonality= Jackie as she appeared in 1998. Margi Clarke has described the character of Jackie: \\"I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs vile ‚Äì there‚Äôs definitely a heart beating in Jackie. She has an obvious intelligence but she‚Äôs not had opportunities in life and has made some mistakes. She‚Äôs a born survivor but doesn‚Äôt know how to play straight\\" Discussing Jackie's severed relationship with her son Tyrone, Clarke said \\"She's not the best mother in the world. Even though she's trying to spiritually develop herself, there is a side that's under-developed, a side that thinks only about herself. It makes the character interesting, though. I think that Jackie realises that Tyrone's going to do what she never did - that he's going to get it right first time. I think he'll stay with Molly - he's one of those lads that wants to correct what his mother's done. Mother and father split up, mother being with all kinds of fellas. I think that's how he wants to live - he's a one woman guy\\". Speaking of the apparent changes her character underwent in 2008, Clarke said \\"on the outside she's a reformed character. She's into yoga and natural living, but deep down, Jackie Dobbs is going to burst back out again. She's mellowed a little bit, though. I think it's the pink hair.\\" =Axing (1999)= Off-screen, actress Margi Clarke was axed from Coronation Street due to personal problems that interfered with her work. Clarke explains, \\"[My mother] was a Corrie fan and I was still grieving for her when I first appeared on the show. As a result, I don‚Äôt think I played the part to the best of my ability.\\" =Reintroduction (2008)= In 2008, producers decided to reintroduce the character of Jackie, 9 years after she had last appeared. They initially considered recasting the role, however, Liverpudian scriptwriter Carmel Morgan spoke up for Margi Clarke at a writers meeting, saying that \\"Margi's in a great place right now, she looks fantastic, she's healthy, very positive, and would love to make up for her shortcomings last time\\". So, she was asked to re-audition for the role. Clarke was sent scripts to rehearse for the audition, however, as no scripts for Jackie's return had been finalised, Clarke was sent a script for a character named auntie Pam, Molly Compton's relation. Mistakenly believing that she was being asked to audition for a new character, the sister of Jackie, Clarke dyed her hair bright pink to make her visually different from Jackie, who was known to viewers for her peroxide blonde hair. The look impressed the directors and after a successful audition, Jackie Dobbs was brought back with pink hair. She initially signed a two-month contract and appeared in the lead up to her son's engagement to Molly Compton. Speaking about her comeback, Margi Clarke has said > When I got the phone call, I was crying tears of joy out of my living room > window. It was nine years ago since I last walked the Cobbles, so I've been > lost at sea for that long. It was like finding my way back to the land of > milk and honey. I couldn't believe it. I'm delighted to be back, though > [...] I'd always wanted to go back and I hoped that it would always be a > possibility. Jackie Dobbs lived on. She was referred to every now and then, > what with Tyrone being her son. If Tyrone wasn't there, I wouldn't be going > back! Thanks God for my 'son'! Not many actors leave a soap. I left and I > thought I was going to get a long run of work. With my character being quite > an explosive one, I was never going to go into the corner shop and ask Dev > for a loaf. Characters like mine don't tend to survive long because they're > wild, but she's brilliant to play. Clarke has vowed to take the soap more seriously after wasting her \\"golden opportunity\\" in the late 1990s. She said: \\"It's one of Britain's top soaps and to be called to play on that stage, it's on a par with being asked to play for England and you should really honour it, have the commitment and give it everything you've got. I'm 54 now, and I'm never going to look a gift horse in the mouth again.\\" Reception Discussing the character's reintroduction in 2008, Kris Green from entertainment website Digital Spy said, \\"It was a coup on Corrie part when they managed to lure her back. Jackie's an excellent character and will hopefully bring back some of Corrie 'energy' that it's been lacking of late.\\" TV critic Christine Klabacher added, \\"Actress Margi Clarke threw herself into the role as always and brightened a rather dull week in the soap [...] characterisation was called for, and Margi obliged in bucketloads.\\" References Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas Category:Fictional people from Liverpool Category:Television characters introduced in 1998 Category:Fictional prisoners and detainees Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Jackie Dobbs"},{"id":"17950956","text":"Turkish philosophy has long been affected by Islam and the country's proximity to Greece and ancient Greek philosophy.

This is usually considered to have begun with Magna Carta of 1215, a landmark document in British constitutional history. Development of civil liberties advanced in common law and statute law in the 17th and 18th centuries, notably with the Bill of Rights 1689. During the 19th century, working-class people struggled to win the right to vote and join trade unions. Parliament responded with new legislation, and attitudes to universal suffrage and liberties progressed further in the aftermath of the first and second world wars. Since then, the United Kingdom's relationship to civil liberties has been mediated through its membership of the European Convention on Human Rights. The United Kingdom, through Sir David Maxwell- Fyfe, led the drafting of the Convention, which expresses a traditional civil libertarian theory.see e.g. the Praemble to the Convention, which states the Convention is there to secure \\"effective political democracy\\". It became directly applicable in UK law with the enactment of the Human Rights Act 1998. The relationship between human rights and civil liberties is often seen as two sides of the same coin. A right is something you may demand of someone, while a liberty is freedom from interference by another in your presumed rights. However, human rights are broader. In the numerous documents around the world, they involve more substantive moral assertions on what is necessary, for instance, for \\"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\\", \\"to develop one's personality to the fullest potential\\" or \\"protect inviolable dignity\\". \\"Civil liberties\\" are certainly that, but they are distinctly civil, and relate to participation in public life. As Professor Conor Gearty writes, > Civil liberties is another name for the political freedoms that we must have > available to us all if it to be true to say of us that we live in a society > that adheres to the principle of representative, or democratic, > government.Conor Gearty, Civil Liberties (2007) Clarendon Law Series, Oxford > University Press, p.1 In other words, civil liberties are the \\"rights\\" or \\"freedoms\\" which underpin democracy. This usually means the right to vote, the right to life, the prohibition on torture, security of the person, the right to personal liberty and due process of law, freedom of expression and freedom of association.Care should be taken with such definitions. Much more \\"underpins\\" democracy than civil and political rights. Capacity for public participation goes into the social and economic: see, e.g. Jeremy Waldron, 'Social Citizenship and the Defence of Welfare Provision' (1993) in Liberal Rights: Collected papers 1981-91, Cambridge University Press, Ch.12; Also, the language of rights, liberties, freedoms, etc, etc, is inherently vague and the divisions between different rights in various documents are inevitably meaningless (e.g. is the right to liberty different from a fair trial, and does it matter?), and simply express country's cultural and historical preferences. At the core all these things come down to the mediation of relations between people, whether for power or resources or between individuals or the state. See, e.g. Alan Gewirth, Human Rights: Essays on Justification and Applications (1982); he puts forth the formula that any right can be put in the form of X claiming right Y against Z Background The Bill of Rights 1689 secured the supremacy of Parliament over the King, laying the foundations of representative democracy. *Magna Carta (1215), supported what became the writ of habeas corpus, trial by one's peers, representation of nobility for taxation, and a ban on retroactive punishment. *The Case of Proclamations (1610) decided that \\"the King by his proclamation or other ways cannot change any part of the common law, or statute law, or the customs of the realm\\" and that \\"the King hath no prerogative, but that which the law of the land allows him.\\" *Dr. Bonham's Case (1610), decided that \\"in many cases, the common law will control Acts of Parliament\\". This may have influenced Marbury v. Madison (1803) which led to judicial review in the United States. *The Petition of Right (1628), established the illegality of taxation without parliamentary consent and prohibited arbitrary imprisonment. *Habeas Corpus Act 1679, safeguarded individual freedom against unlawful imprisonment with right to appeal. *Bill of Rights 1689, Claim of Right Act 1689, asserted certain rights of Parliament and the individual, and limited the power of the monarch‚Äîthe result of the Glorious Revolution. *The Second Treatise on Representative Government (1689) outlines John Locke's ideas for a more civilised society based on natural rights and contract theory. Enlightenment Sir William Blackstone was the archetypal figure of the British Enlightenment, a legal scholar who in his Commentaries professed the liberty of citizens deriving from the Magna Carta and the common law. *Ashby v White (1703) 1 Sm LC (13th Edn) 253, right to vote cannot be interfered with by a public official. *Armory v Delamirie (1722) K.B., 1 Strange 505, 93 ER 664, right to property that you find. *Entick v Carrington (1765), right against arbitrary search and seizure; Lord Camden, quoting almost verbatim from John Locke, held that man entered society to secure his \\"property\\" (lives, liberties and estates). His principle was that the individual could do anything not prohibited by law, and the state could do nothing but that which was authorised by law. *R v Knowles, ex parte Somersett (1772) 20 State Tr 1; (1772) Lofft 1, abolition of slavery, for \\"the air of England has long been too pure for a slave, and every man is free who breathes it.\\" However, this did nothing for the colonies. *Trials of John Wilkes.

Local brewers formed a so-called \\"skeleton army\\", and threatened to disrupt the march with force. The police, fearing for public order told the Salvation Army to call it off, but they went ahead. Then the police forced them, by breaking up the brass band. Field J in the High Court held that there was no right of the police to do so. The Salvation Army was associating \\"for religious exercises among themselves, and for a religious revival\\". No one could \\"say that such an assembly [is] in itself an unlawful one\\". Stopping the march would be like saying \\"that a man may be convicted for doing a lawful act‚Äîthere is no authority for such a proposition.\\"(1882) 9 QBD 308, 313-4; Compare now, Hammond v Director of Public Prosecutions [2004] EWHC 69 (Admin), where a homophobic preacher in Bournemouth was arrested for breach of peace after people started pushing and throwing water over him; and Redmond-Bate v Director of Public Prosecutions [1999] Crim Law Rev, where Fundamentalist Christians preaching on Cathedral steps, attracting 100 stirred up people were removed for \\"breach of the peace\\". Sedley LJ held that in contravention to Art.11 ECHR and Beatty *Third Reform Act of 1884 and the Redistribution Act of the following year extended the same voting qualifications in the towns to the countryside and established the present-day one-member constituency as the normal pattern for Parliamentary representation. *Trade Disputes Act 1906, removed liability in tort for trade unions going on strike, after the House of Lords in a series of cases invented ways to bankrupt unions for any action.see, Taff Vale case, Quinn v Leatham and South Wales Mines; the first of these was the direct cause for the formation of the Labour Party: to lobby for its reversal. *Nairn v The University Court of the University of St Andrews, (1907) 15 SLT 471, 473, per Lord McLaren, it is \\"a principle of the unwritten constitutional law of this country that men only were entitled to take part in the election of representatives to Parliament.\\" *Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants v Osborne [1910] AC 87, per Lord Shaw and Lord James, any contributions by trade unions to Members of Parliament were \\"unconstitutional and illegal\\".Although clearly these cases are anachronistic to the highest degree and moribundly conservative, political donations by unions and business alike; see for instance the Companies Act 2006 ss.362-379. Reversed by the Trade Union Act 1913. *Representation of the People Act 1918, allowed universal male suffrage for over-21s, and the vote for women over 30. *Representation of the People Act 1928, universal suffrage over 21. *Liversidge v Anderson [1942] AC 206. *Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed v Veitch [1942] AC 435, right to collective bargaining.

Access to counsel and court was held to be a necessary element in the right to a fair trial, because otherwise countries could abolish courts and not be in breach. *Ahmad v Inner London Education Authority [1978] QB 38, the case concerned the right of freedom of religion under Art.9 ECHR, and whether a Muslim man could take time off on Fridays, with pay, to go and worship at his local mosque. His case was turned down both by the Court of Appeal, and by the Commission in Strasbourg. But before it went to Europe, Lord Denning MR, famously said with regard to the Convention: > \\"We will do our best to see that our decisions are in conformity with it. > But it is drawn in such vague terms that it can be used for all sorts of > unreasonable claims and provoke all sorts of litigation.

The Attorney-General had obtained an injunction preventing The Sunday Times newspaper from publishing an article describing the history of the testing, manufacture and marketing of the drug thalidomide by The Distillers Company, on the grounds that it would prejudice ongoing litigation between Distillers and parents of children who had suffered birth-defects caused by the drug. By 11 votes to 9, the European Court of Human Rights held that the injunction violated the paper's right to freedom of expression under Art.10 ECHR. In response to this judgment the UK parliament passed the Contempt of Court Act 1981. 1980s Margaret Thatcher oversaw a gradual tightening of security legislation to crack down on industrial protests and the Provisional IRA. *Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, allowed four days' detention without trial (previously it was 24 hours). *CCSU v Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374, where GCHQ members were banned by Margaret Thatcher (also the Minister for the Civil Service) from belonging to unions. The House of Lords held that the Royal prerogative was subject to judicial review. Banning unions was within the discretion of the Minister. *Malone v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1979] Ch 344, Megarry VC said that the executive could do anything that was not prohibited by law (purporting to reverse Entick v Carrington). This meant that a dodgy antique dealer could not be prosecuted for handling stolen goods based on evidence from a wire tap that the police had no authority under any statute to do. *Malone v United Kingdom (1984) 7 EHRR 14, said that UK allowing the phone tapping is in breach of its obligations under the ECHR, because there was no law that did 'indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities.\\"(1984) 7 EHRR 14, 79 *Interception of Communications Act 1985, the government's response to the ruling, allowing any phone tapping. *Public Order Act 1986, passed in the context of widespread industrial disputes, particularly the miners' strike, Part II limited public processions and demonstrations by requiring 6 days advance notice to be given to the police. The Brighton Hotel Bombing by the Provisional Irish Republican Army to coincide with the Conservative Party conference preceded a sterner approach to security legislation. *Official Secrets Act 1989, cf R v Shayler [2002] UKHL 11 (David Shayler) *Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 1990s *Attorney-General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd. (No. 2)[1990] 1 A.C. 109, at p. 283G per Lord Goff of the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords stated in the case the common law principle that \\"[In England] everybody is free to do anything, subject only to the provisions of the law.\\" *R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Brind [1991] 1 AC 696 concerning the dubbing of voices by any IRA members on television. Anthony Lester QC argued that implied in the Home Secretary's discretion must be an adherence to the ECHR's norms on free expression. This was squarely rejected by the House of Lords (Lord Ackner leading the judgment), and on appeal *Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, codified the many restrictions and formalities placed on trade union activity and the right to strike. **cf. Wilson v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 523, where the Strasbourg Court held that UK legislation must uphold the right of workers to join trade unions and take actions to defend their interests. *Charter 88, a liberal pressure group which took its name from the Czech Charter 77 and advocated institutional reforms modelled on the United States, was addressed by Labour leader John Smith. He promised a Bill of Rights for Britain. *The Intelligence Services Act 1994 and the Police Act 1997, included powers to intercept communications.Security and Privacy, The Guardian, 19 July 2001 Tony Blair and then-U.S. President George W. Bush both introduced rafts of new security legislation as a reaction to terrorism after the September 11, 2001 attacks and the Iraq War. *Human Rights Act 1998, for the first time this allowed direct appeal in British courts to be made on the basis of the European Convention on Human Rights. It preserves Parliamentary sovereignty, because courts may not strike down democratically decided laws, they can only issue a \\"declaration of incompatibility\\" (s.4). Judges, when interpreting legislation, may also presume that Parliament intended not to derogate from Convention rights (s.3). It is a precondition of a claim to the Strasbourg court that a claimant has exhausted the domestic legal system's avenues for appeal. The main reason for incorporation, and justification from advocates and the Government was to save time and cost. Other countries, such as Germany and France have their own standards, but all follow and stay conformity with the ECHR. Similarly, the ECHR is drawn from the traditions of every member state, and acts as a method for maintaining minimum standards on which there is general consensus. Despite its controversy, this may be viewed as a uniquely British measure, especially given the fact that the Convention was drafted under the direction of the British government. 21st century *Terrorism Act 2000, extended the limit to 7 days' detention without charge for terrorist suspects. It also allows terrorist organisations to be banned. Sixty groups have to date been outlawed. The Act also introduced a broad definition of \\"terrorism\\" under s.1. The stop and search powers in the Act were used to search protesters at an arms trade fair in Canary Wharf, including a Ph.D. student and a journalist who took legal action as a result. The police action was held to be lawful in R (Gillan) v Commissioner for the Metropolitan Police [2006] UKHL 12. *Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, allows the government full surveillance powers of all kinds of communication. The current rate is 30 warrants being issued a week. In the 15 months from July 2005 to October 2006, 2,407 warrants were issued. *Civil Contingencies Act 2004, allows the government, for an \\"emergency\\", to deploy armed forces anywhere in the country during peacetime (cf. Bill of Rights 1689). It also allows property to be sequestrated, for an \\"emergency\\" with or without compensation anywhere (cf. Prot. 1, Art.1 ECHR). *Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, created an offence of inciting religious hatred, an advanced notification scheme for protests up to 1 kilometre from Parliament. cf Blum v Director for Public Prosecutions. *Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001, in response to the destruction of the NYC World Trade Center on 9/11, the government passed legislation allowing indefinite detention without trial for non-British nationals suspected of committing terrorist offences, but without enough evidence for an actual trial (cf. Magna Carta, Habeas Corpus Act 1679). When passing Acts of Parliament, under the HRA 1998 the Minister has to make a \\"statement of compatibility\\" with the Convention. What they did was to send notice of derogation from the right to a fair trial, Art.6 ECHR. Art.15 ECHR is the derogation provision, which says \\"In time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation\\" a member can derogate \\"to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation\\". The minister then declared when passing the 2001 Act that it was (with the derogation sent) compatible with the HRA 1998. *Criminal Justice Act 2003, abrogated double jeopardy in cases with \\"new and compelling evidence\\". *A and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 17, the majority of the House of Lords decided that the detention without trial under the ATCSA 2001 was discriminatory to non-British nationals, and therefore incompatible under Art.14 ECHR. A declaration of incompatibility was issued under s.4 HRA 1998. Lord Hoffmann was the only dissenting judge to hold that the whole detention without trial idea was incompatible with the right to a trial under Art.6, and that the derogation was unacceptable, because there was no \\"threat to the life of the nation\\". He argued strongly that it would be wrong to suggest, with the majority's view that discrimination was the problem, that the government should be allowed to lock up all Britons alike. *Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, the government in response to A's case passed this allows the Home Secretary to impose control orders on any British citizen. Anybody suspected of terrorist related activities by the Home Secretary, but without any kind of trial, can be electronically tagged, monitored, be restricted from making phone calls, using the internet, be banned from certain kinds of work, can be restricted from going certain places, have one's passport revoked and be under a duty to report to the police. The control order system was held disproportionate in Secretary of State for the Home Department v JJ [2007] UKHL 45. The system was declared incompatible, because there was no derogation. However Lord Brown stated that if a suspect was left with eight hours' liberty a day, then it would have been acceptable. *Terrorism Act 2006, following the bombings in London on the 7 July, this legislation allows for people suspected of terrorist offences to be detained without charge for up to 28 days. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 had extended the time to 14 days. The government had initially proposed a limit of 90 days, saying this was on the recommendation of the police, and citing support from opinion polls. Opposition among MPs saw the first defeat for the Blair government; the Conservative amendment of 28 days' detention without charge being accepted. The act also created a new offence of \\"glorifying terrorism\\". *Austin v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [2007] EWCA Civ 989, Court of Appeal rejects a charge of false imprisonment and an Art.5 ECHR claim for police holding May Day protestors in Oxford Circus in 2001. *Counter-Terrorism Bill 2008 sought to extend the number of days' detention without charge to 42 days and to allow the Home Secretary to require an inquest to be established without a jury in secret if they deems it to be in the public interest, the interest of an overseas treaty partner or in the interest of national security. David Davis MP, a Conservative politician and Shadow Home Secretary at the time, resigned his parliamentary seat in June 2008 in protest over the proposed extension to detention with charge. His resignation forced a by-election, which he contested and won on a civil liberties platform. Neither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats stood a candidate *R v AB and CD (2014) was the first British trial to be held entirely in secret although some of the restrictions were loosened somewhat by the court of appeal after a legal challenge by The Guardian. * Felony disenfranchisement in the United Kingdom was the topic of ECHR cases and political debate between 2005 and 2012 See also *Big Brother Watch *Campaign Against Censorship *Censorship in the United Kingdom *Civil and political rights *Civil libertarianism *Constitution of the United Kingdom *Freedom of speech *History of liberalism *Human rights in the United Kingdom *Liberalism in the United Kingdom *Liberty (pressure group) *Michael Mansfield *Mass surveillance in the United Kingdom *Parliament in the Making for a summary of the historical development of parliament and civil rights in the UK *Privacy International *Taking Liberties - Documentary about the implications of anti terrorism legislation on civil rights in the UK. *Terrorism in the United Kingdom NotesReferences ;Historical *Helen Fenwick, Civil Rights: New Labour, Freedom and the Human Rights Act (2000) Longman *Keith Ewing and Conor Gearty, Freedom under Thatcher: Civil Liberties in Modern Britain (1990) Oxford University Press *Keith Ewing and Conor Gearty, The Struggle for Civil Liberties: Political Freedom and the Rule of Law in Britain, 1914-1945 (2000) Oxford University Press ;General *Conor Gearty, Civil Liberties (2007) Clarendon Law Series, Oxford University Press *David Feldman, Civil Liberties and Human Rights in England and Wales (2002) Oxford University Press * A.W.

The early sound film features Smith in an African- American speakeasy of the prohibition era singing the W. C. Handy standard, \\"St. Louis Blues\\". Directed by Dudley Murphy, it is the only known film of Bessie Smith, and the soundtrack is her only recording not controlled by Columbia Records. Bessie Smith had a hit on the song in 1925 and Handy himself asked Bessie Smith to appear in the movie. Handy co-authored the film and was the musical director. The film was a dramatization of the song, a woman left alone by her roving man. It features a band that included James P. Johnson on piano, Thomas Morris and Joe Smith on cornet, as well as the Hall Johnson Choir with some thrilling harmonies at the end. The film has an all African- American cast. Bessie Smith co-stars with Jimmy Mordecai as the boyfriend and Isabel Washington as the other woman. It was filmed in June 1929 in Astoria, Queens. The film is about 16 minutes long. In 2006, this version was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".

The analgesic naproxen is an example of a compound that is prepared industrially using the Heck reaction. For his work in palladium- catalyzed coupling reactions and organic synthesis, Heck was awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, shared with the Japanese chemists Ei-ichi Negishi and Akira Suzuki. Early life and education Heck was born in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1931. He earned his Ph.D. in physical organic chemistry in 1954 at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), working under the supervision of Dr. Saul Winstein. After two periods of postdoctoral research at the ETH in Zurich, Switzerland, and then back at UCLA, Heck took a position with the Hercules Corporation in Wilmington, Delaware in 1957. After productive research work at Hercules, he was hired by the University of Delaware's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry in 1971. Heck was a professor of chemistry at the University of Delaware. In 2012, he was appointed by De La Salle University in Manila as adjunct professor in its chemistry department.

Pissarides, Konstantin Novoselov, Andre Geim, Akira Suzuki, Ei-ichi Negishi, and Richard Heck, Nobel Prize Laureates 2010, at a press conference at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. The development of the Heck reaction began with Heck's investigations of the coupling of arylmercury compounds with olefins using palladium as a catalyst during the late 1960s. This work was published in a series of seven consecutive articles in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) for which Heck was the sole author. During the early 1970s, Tsutomu Mizoroki independently reported the use of the less toxic aryl halides as the coupling partner in the reaction. Quality of archived page is low. Full text access requires an account. During his career, Heck continued to improve the transformation, developing it into a powerful synthetic method for organic synthesis. The importance of this reaction grew slowly in the organic synthesis community. In 1982, Heck was able to write an Organic Reactions chapter that covered all the known instances in just 45 pages. Quality of archived page is low. Full text access requires an account. By 2002, applications had grown to the extent that the Organic Reactions chapter published that year, limited to intramolecular Heck reactions, covered 377 pages. These reactions, a small part of the total, couple two parts of the same molecule. Quality of archived page is low. Full text access requires an account. Today, the Heck reaction stands as one of the widely used methods for the creation of carbon-carbon bonds in the synthesis of organic chemicals. This reaction has been subject to numerous scientific review articles, including a ~600 page monograph dedicated to this subject published in 2009. =Palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions= Heck's work set the stage for a variety of other palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions, including those of aryl halides with derivatives of boronic acid (Suzuki‚ÄìMiyaura coupling), organotin reagents (Stille coupling), organomagnesium compounds (Kumada-Corriu coupling), silanes (Hiyama coupling), and organozincs (Negishi coupling), as well as with amines (Buchwald‚ÄìHartwig amination) and alcohols. These palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions are now widely practiced in organic synthesis, including in the chemical engineering production of certain organic compounds in factories. Of the several reactions developed by Heck, the greatest societal impact has been from the palladium- catalyzed coupling of an alkyne with an aryl halide. This is the reaction that was used to couple fluorescent dyes to DNA bases, allowing the automation of DNA sequencing and the examination of the human genome. In Sonogashira's original report of what is now known as the Sonogashira coupling, his group modified an alkyne coupling procedure previously reported by Heck, by adding a copper(I) salt.

Rhiwbina RFC is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and is a feeder club for the Cardiff Blues. Rhiwbina RFC also run a mini and Junior Section with teams from Under 7's up to Youth. History 2011 League Champions The club was established on 14 February 1962, when a notice was put up in a Post Office window in Rhiwbina by Jack Treeby. Jack asked for interested people to a meeting and following this meeting the club was formed. The \\"Squirrel\\" name and logo came about as a result of the newly formed club meeting in the Butchers Arms, an Ansells pub which used the squirrel motif as an emblem. Rhiwbina Rugby was awarded full Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) status in 1975, the nominator's included Pontypridd and Penarth Rugby clubs. Rhiwbinas previous President was Keith Rowlands, who was also the President of the WRU and who played for Wales and the British Lions. Rhiwbina has in recent years enjoyed success on and off the field. There were wholesale change of the committee in 2008, this saw the club head in an exciting new direction, with a new enthusiasm. The introduction of the experienced new coaching team of Gareth Lintern and Jared Lougher saw a turn around of fortunes on the pitch. Back to back promotions in 2010/11 and 2011/12 saw the club narrowly miss out on a third promotion in 2012/13. In 2013 there was the opening by WRU CEO Roger Lewis of new changing rooms and floodlights, this proved a worthwhile addition to the club. In the following season Rhiwbina RFC won the Div 2 East title gaining promotion to Div 1. During this season there was an appearance at the Millennium Stadium in the final of the SWALEC Plate Final. The team narrowly lost to Merthyr 29-26. In the same season was a first appearance in the Silver Ball Final. James Bird a Rhiwbina RFC product gained international honor's with the USA in 2016.

He left St Kilda at the end of the year and crossed to but failed to make the seniors again, spending two years with Fitzroy's reserves. =SANFL= Williams moved to South Australia in 1980 where he joined West Adelaide and would be a regular fixture in their side for the rest of the decade. Under legendary coach Neil Kerley, Williams was a member of West's 1983 premiership side that defeated Sturt. He started the 1983 SANFL Grand Final in the Forward pocket and had stints in the ruck throughout the game. During the second quarter of the game at Football Park Williams dislocated the Ring finger on his left hand which was said to be \\"at right angles to where it should be\\". Despite this, Williams returned to the game in the 2nd half and helped The Bloods win their first (and so far only) premiership since 1961. Williams is regarded as having his best game of club football in Round 21 of the 1982 season when West Adelaide defeated Sturt by 2 points at the Adelaide Oval.

Looking down onto the Pass of Drumochter from the Boar of Badenoch. A' Mharconaich is a Scottish mountain that is located 29 km WNW of Blair Atholl in the Highland council area. It is in a group of mountains that lie west of the A9 road near the summit of the Pass of Drumochter and are known accordingly as the Drumochter Hills. The hill is just within the Cairngorms National Park although it is not part of the Cairngorms mountains. Overview A' Mharconaich is a Munro of height 975 metres (3199 feet). It is well seen by travellers on the A9 to which it shows it more steeper and rugged eastern flanks with a high corrie located just beneath the summit. The mountains names translates from the Gaelic as \\"the horse place\\" and dates from a time when horses were a valuable element of the economy of the region: places where horses gathered would be noted and named accordingly.\\"The Magic of the Munros\\", Irvine Butterfield, Page 76 Gives meaning of Gaelic translation of name and meaning. The hill is crossed by the border between Perth and Kinross and Highland areas or in the old day Perthshire and Inverness-shire and is marked by old rusting fence posts which can be used as an aid to navigation when traversing the hill.\\"OS Landranger 42\\" Shows county boundary on hill . Geography A' Mharconaich has a SW-NE orientated summit ridge, just over a kilometre long with high points at each end. The NE summit is regarded as the highest point and this has been confirmed by an Abney Level survey which found the SW top, named Bruach nan Iomairean, to be a few metres lower.Database of British and Irish Hills.. The 1974 edition of Munro's Tables moved the summit to the SW top, possibly in error, but the location reverted to the original summit in 1981.Database of British and Irish Hills; The Munros and Tops 1891-1997. Gives details of temporary summit re-location in 1974. A' Mharconaich throws out two fine steep ridges on either side of the eastern corrie. The NE ridge descends initially as a steep buttress before easing and continuing for three km to reach the A9 at Balsporran Cottages. The less well defined eastern ridge descends steeply from Bruach nan Iomairean to a col with a height of approximately 655 metres which links to the hill the Boar of Badenoch also known as An Torc. The line of old fence posts can be followed the whole way. The Boar reaches a height of 739 metres and is a Graham Top. It is a fine viewpoint down into the Pass of Drumochter.\\"The High Mountains of Britain and Ireland, Vol 1\\", Irvine Butterfield, Page 114 Gives mountain topography and some route information. To the SW A' Mharconaich links to the adjacent Munro of Beinn Udlamain, again following the fence posts for four km across undulating ground with little loss of height. This area is often teeming with deer being part of the Dalnaspidal deer forest.\\"Hamish‚Äôs Mountain Walk\\", Hamish Brown, Page 155 Says the col to Beinn Udlamain is often full of deer. 2.5 km to the north is another Munro, Geal-ch√†rn which is reached by descending to a height of 739 metres and traversing around the head of Coire Fhar. Drainage from A' Mharconaich reaches the east coast of Scotland but is divided by the Pass of Drumochter, either going north to join the River Spey or south to meet the River Tay.\\"The Munros, Scotland‚Äôs Highest Mountains\\", Cameron McNeish, Page 94 Gives general mountain description and topography. Ascents and view There are two starting points for the direct ascent of A' Mharconaich and several permutations if it is being climbed in conjunction with other hills as it usually is. One route starts on the A9 at the top of the Pass of Drumochter at grid reference and goes up Coire Dhomhain for just over a kilometre and then ascending NW to the col between A' Mharconaich and the Boar of Badenoch from where the line of fence posts is followed steeply to the summit ridge. This starting point can be used for a complete circuit of Coire Dhomhain taking in the other two Munros of Sgairneach Mh√≤r and Beinn Udlamain. An alternative start is at Balsporran cottages (), and offers a direct ascent up the NE ridge or a longer walk which takes in the adjoining Munro of Geal-ch√†rn. The summit is marked by a substantial collection of stones which has been shaped in to a wind shelter rather than the usual cairn.

For example, Al-Azhar mosque would aid the community through the endowments and remained economically separate via the revenue they earned from the awqaf. This enabled the mosque to maintain a state of independence from the dictates of the government and rulers. Mosques could use the endowments to help the community as needed. Also, because mosques were economically independent, imams could preach what they felt was important, with little to no government intervention. However, when the government effectively took over the endowments program, the people suffered greatly. They no longer had their only means of political representation and Al-Azhar‚Äôs religious influence was manipulated into producing propaganda by the state. =Nationalization of awqaf= Alsharawi in the Ministry of Awqaf, 1978 The first Egyptian leader to nationalize the awqaf was Muhammad Ali. He began the precedent of bringing the endowments under state control. His successors continued the process and by the time King Fuad I was in power, Al- Azhar carried out the government‚Äôs wishes. When the king desired to be caliph some ‚Äú‚Ä¶Al-Azhar sheikhs were ready to provide the necessary pronouncements‚Äù (Ibrahim 636). Endowments were considered a part of the state when Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized them in 1952. Gamal Abdel Nasser used the newly created propaganda machine of Al-Azhar to ‚Äú‚Ä¶justify Arab Socialism and his struggle against Israel‚Äù (Ibrahim 636). Anwar Sadat continued Nasser‚Äôs policies of using Al-Azhar for the ‚Äú‚Ä¶sake of justifying opposing policies, including his treaty with Israel‚Äù (Ibrahim 637). This process arguably twisted what was once a community-benefitting mosque, into a corrupt political machine; and with the Ministry of Awqaf promoting rationalism rather than supporting the cause of the poor. In 1977 Jamaat al Muslimin, a guerrilla Islamic group that rose out of the Muslim Brotherhood, killed the Minister of Awqaf, Muhammad al-Dhahabi, after the arrest of its members. The Ministry of Awqaf and the mosques, was in the eyes of much of the public a tool of the state, and because the mosques were now under the state‚Äôs economic control, the imams were effectively employees of the state. The government, for the first time, now had the authority to dictate to the imams and the mosque what could or could not be preached. =Present day= The deposed President Hosni Mubarak followed the precedent of his predecessors in keeping the establishment of awqaf nationalized. The government today aims to moderate the tone of the mosques and retains the ability to do so by means of the ministry. Mahmoud Hamdy Zakzouk served as minister from 1995 to 2011. The ministry also serves as an archives center for various awqaf legal documents over the past hundreds of years. Crime at awqaf mosques Awqaf ministry building In the year 2008 growing concern erupted in Egypt over the increase of thefts from Awqaf mosques in Egypt, such as Ganim Al Bahlawan and Altinbugha Al-Maridani mosques, where inlaid wood panels from the minbars were stolen. Thieves were also caught trying to steal an ironwork grill window from the sabil kuttab of Rokaya Dudu. The Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA) blamed the Ministry of Awqaf for the incidents, stating that the role of the SCA is only to restore mosques and give then back to the Awqaf, who are then in charge of security. Yet, legally the SCA is in charge of security of monuments and archaeological sites. In 2017, it was decided that some mosque artifacts would be stored at SCA warehouses, for security reasons.

Schenck, and released by United Artists. The film is based on the 1920 mystery play The Bat, written by Mary Roberts Rinehart and Avery Hopwood, and is the second film version by the same director, previously adapted in 1926. An early talkie and one of the first widescreen films, West financed the cinematography, which required two cameramen, several techniques and was once a lost film but thanks to the duplicate filmstock was restored in 1988. Plot A mysterious criminal by the name of \\"The Bat\\" eludes police and then finally announces his retirement to the country. In the countryside near the town of Oakdale, news of a bank robbery in Oakdale has put Mrs. Van Gordner's maid, Lizzie, on edge. Van Gordner is leasing the house from Mr. Fleming, the Oakdale bank president, who is in Europe. The chief suspect in the bank robbery, a cashier, has disappeared. Van Gordner's niece, Dale arrives followed by the gardener she has hired. Dr. Venrees arrives and tells Van Gordner that he has received a telegram from Fleming stating that because of the robbery he will be returning soon and will need to occupy his house. There are mysterious noises in the house and lights turning on and off. A rock is thrown through the window with a note threatening harm if the occupants don't leave. Dale, and the gardener, who is actually Brook, the missing teller, are looking for a secret room in the house. They believe the money from the robbery is hidden there. Detective Anderson shows up and questions Van Gordner. Fleming's nephew, Richard, arrives at Dale's request. She is hoping he can help in finding the secret room. Richard finds the house plans but refuses to show them to Dale. He pushes her away and runs up the stairs but he is shot by someone at the top of the stairs and falls dead. Van Gordner sends for a private detective. A mysterious masked man sticks a gun in the caretaker's back and tells him he better get everyone out of the house. The lights continue to go on and off. The shadow of the Bat is seen by various occupants of the house. Anderson states that Fleming isn't in Europe but robbed his own bank. He accuses the doctor of being part of the plot. An unconscious man is found in the garage. He comes to and is questioned by Anderson. He can't remember anything. Anderson tells the private detective to keep an eye on him. The hidden room and the missing money are found. Fleming, the missing banker, is found dead behind a wall in the room. The garage suddenly bursts into flames. In the ensuing chaos, the Bat appears and is caught, but he gets away before he can be unmasked. As the Bat is fleeing from the house, he is caught in a bear trap, set up by Lizzie. He is revealed to be Anderson, who isn't actually Anderson. The real Anderson is the man who was found unconscious. The Bat says that no jail can hold him and he will escape. A curtain closes across the screen. We are in a theater. Chester Morris, who played Anderson tells the audience that as long as they don't reveal the Bat's identity they will be safe from the Bat.  Film techniques  Director West financed the Magnafilm widescreen process and employed two cinematographers, using techniques not to be seen until the 1950s and Otto Preminger. Along with The Big Trail(1930) its one of the first known uses of widescreen. Cameras used two different sized film stock and filmed in a variety of techniques including panning, cut scenes, and close ups. Panning can be seen throughout the film but most notably in the opening scene of the movie. The movie begins with a shot of the face of a clock tower. It then pulls back and slowly scans or \\"pans\\" all the way down the building to show a car pulling out of a police station. Cut scenes can be seen throughout the film to show lapses in time. For example, when the police car is driving down the street, the scene (shot from the back of the car over the driver's shoulder) can be seen fading into another scene to convey a sense of time passing. In 1930, movie cameras weren't portable enough to be used in the back of cars yet, however Charles Cline invented a camera used for filming The Bat Whispers, more often used in Ray June's cinematography, for fluidity and to show The Bat in flight. It was \\"a lightweight 24-foot-long camera dolly that could send a camera zooming 18 feet in a fraction of a second\\". Close up shots were also incorporated, often when the residents of the mansion are frightened and trying to figure out where the mysterious noises are coming from, the camera \\"zooms in\\" on the actors faces, and when The Bat is creeping up to Dale Van Gorder in the secret room. Production background An early talkie, this film is the second film version of the 1920 hit Broadway play The Bat, written by Mary Roberts Rinehart and Avery Hopwood, based on Roberts 1908 book The Circular Staircase. The first film version of the play, The Bat (1926), was also directed by Roland West. Just as in the play and the first film, people explore an old mansion looking for a hidden treasure while a caped killer picks them off one by one. This film is noted by Bob Kane as one of the inspirations for some elements of the Batman character, which he co-created with Bill Finger. The film was shot in three versions: a pair of 1.33:1 aspect ratio, 35mm negatives for US and foreign prints; and a 2:1 aspect ratio 65mm widescreen \\"Magnifilm\\" version (misspelled \\"Magnafilm\\" in some ads).David Coles, \\"Magnified Grandeur, Widescreen 1926-1931\\" The domestic negative was cut down to 72 minutes for the 1938 Atlantic Pictures reissue, and subsequently was lost. In 1988 the UCLA Film and Television Archive restored and preserved the 35mm foreign version and the 65mm Magnifilm from the original camera negatives.BBC Online Network UCLA gained access through the Library of Congress upon Mary Pickford's death in 1979 when she willed them her film collection, The Bat Whispers (65mm) was among it. This film was remade again in 1959 as The Bat with Agnes Moorehead and Vincent Price. Connection to \\"Batman\\" Comic-book creator Bob Kane said in his 1989 autobiography Batman and Me that the villain of The Bat Whispers was an inspiration for his character Batman.

Biography Alex Turnbull was born in Stratford, Ontario and died in Burnaby, British Columbia. For most of his career, \\"Dad\\" Turnbull gained his fame playing in the home (midfield) and outside home (attack) positions, although when he first started playing senior in Ontario, it was as a defensive player. He played his first senior matches in 1884 in Toronto. He bounced around teams in Toronto and Paris, Ontario, for six years before landing in Brockville in 1890. He played with Brockville and then Perth until 1894. In 1896 he found himself playing with and assortment of Toronto-based teams: the Elms, West Torontos, and then the Tecumsehs. In the fall of 1897, Turnbull moved to British Columbia‚Äîfirst to Rossland and then onwards to New Westminster where he would launch a 14-season career [spanning from 1897 to 1909, followed by a comeback in 1918] with the Salmonbellies. He played professional lacrosse for New Westminster Salmonbellies in 1909 and 1918, in which he scored 5 goals in 13 matches over those two seasons. Turnbull was regarded back in the day to be quite healthy for his age and a model athletic for his diet and regimen. Notable for the time, he never drank and very rarely smoked and he was praised in newspapers such as the Ottawa Citizen for his temperance and \\"clean living\\". He had to stop playing in 1909 after suffering two broken ribs during a game, but made a comeback in 1918 at age 46. In later years, he employed as the warden at the provincial jail (a separate complex from BC Penitentiary). On April 3, 1911, he was shot in the leg while on the job when a guard's revolver accidentally exploded. In 1965, he was inducted as a charter member to the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame. Two years later he was inducted into the British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame. Discrepancies with Turnbull's age \\"Dad\\" Turnbull was almost always noted in contemporary newspapers of his day for his remarkable, advanced playing age, however there appears to be some discrepancies reconciling the birth year of 1872, which is the usual given year, with the start of his playing career in 1884. The Montr√©al Gazette noted in a 1908 article that he was aged 44 at time of publication (on July 31, 1908) and he would be 45 as of September of that year, which would imply he was born in 1863. It also would imply a different birthdate from that of December 6. This 1863 birth year would however better correspond with his senior playing career beginning in 1884, because otherwise he would have been 12 (if born in 1872) when he started playing senior lacrosse. In an Ottawa Citizen reprint of a Vancouver Daily Province article in 1917, his age at retirement in 1910 was quoted as being 42, which would then imply a birth year of 1868 thereabouts.

Self-portrait in the mirror. 1913 Davit' Kakabadze () (August 20, 1889 ‚Äì May 10, 1952) was one of the leading Georgian avant-garde painter, graphic artist and scenic designer. A multi-talent, he was also an art scholar and innovator in the field of cinematography as well as an amateur photographer. Kakabadze's works are notable for combining innovative interpretation of European \\"Leftist\\" art with Georgian national traditions, on which he was an expert. Imeretia - My Mother. 1918 Kakabadze was born into a poor peasant family in the village of Kukhi near the town of Khoni. Sponsored by local philanthropists, he studied natural sciences at St. Petersburg University from which he graduated in 1916. At the same time, he attended painting classes at the studio of Dmitroyev-Kavkazsky and did a research in old Georgian arts. After a brief period of working as a painter and educator in Tbilisi, he went to Paris where he lived from 1919 to 1927. He partook in the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants exhibitions and joint exhibitions with the Georgian artists Lado Gudiashvili and Shalva Kikodze. The cycle of landscapes reproducing the nature of Kakabadze's native province of Imereti is some of the most interesting of his early works. During his stay in Paris, Kakabadze was attracted by \\"subjectless painting,\\" and worked on problems of pictorial technique, occasionally using metal, mirror glass, stained glass and other such materials in place of paints. He soon went over to an even more \\"Leftist\\" position, and paid generous tribute to cubism. He lectured on various aspects of visual arts in Paris and, developing his interest in kinetic form, in 1923 he constructed a film camera that produced the illusion of relief and thus became one of the pioneers of three-dimensional cinema. By the mid-1920s he had rejected his cubist-influenced style in favor of more abstract sculpture and painting. Having return to Georgia in 1927, Kakabadze continued his Imereti themes in new monumental decorative landscapes, including industrial landscapes. Around the same time, he collaborated with the leading Georgian theatre director Kote Marjanishvili to produce several set designs for Marjanishvili's theatre in Kutaisi. In 1931, he also produced a documental film \\"The Old Monuments of Georgia\\".Turner, Jane (1996), The Dictionary of Art, p. 732. Grove, .

It is generally dated from 3100‚Äì2900 BC. It is named after the type site Tell Jemdet Nasr, where the assemblage typical for this period was first recognized. Its geographical distribution is limited to south- central Iraq. The culture of the proto-historical Jemdet Nasr period is a local development out of the preceding Uruk period and continues into the Early Dynastic I period. History of research In the early 1900s, clay tablets with an archaic form of the Sumerian cuneiform script began to appear in the antiquities market. A collection of 36 tablets was bought by the German excavators of Shuruppak (Tell Fara) in 1903. While they thought that the tablets came from Tell Jemdet Nasr, it was later shown that they probably came from nearby Tell Uqair. Similar tablets were offered for sale by a French antiquities dealer in 1915, and these were again reported to have come from Tell Jemdet Nasr. Similar tablets, together with splendidly painted monochrome and polychrome pottery, were also shown by local Arabs in 1925 to the Assyriologist Stephen Herbert Langdon, then director of the excavations at Tell al-Uhaymir. The Arabs told Langdon the finds came from Jemdet Nasr, a site some northeast of Tell al-Uhaymir. Langdon was sufficiently impressed, visited the site and started excavations in 1926. He uncovered a large mudbrick building containing more of the distinctive pottery and a collection of 150 to 180 clay tablets bearing the proto-cuneiform script. The importance of these finds was realized immediately and the Jemdet Nasr Period (named after the eponymous type site) was officially defined at a conference in Baghdad in 1930, where at the same time both the Uruk and Ubaid periods had been defined. It has later been shown that some of the material culture that was initially thought to be unique for the Jemdet Nasr Period also occurred during the preceding Uruk Period and the subsequent Early Dynastic Period. Nevertheless, it is generally believed that the Jemdet Nasr Period is still sufficiently distinct in its material culture as well as its socio-cultural characteristics to be recognized as a separate period. Since the first excavations at Tell Jemdet Nasr, the Jemdet Nasr Period has been found at numerous other archaeological sites across much of south-central Iraq, including Abu Salabikh, Shuruppak, Khafajah, Nippur, Tell Uqair, Ur, and Uruk. Dating and periodization Older scientific literature often used 3200‚Äì3000 BC as the beginning and end dates of the Jemdet Nasr Period. The period is nowadays dated from 3100‚Äì2900 BC based on radiocarbon dating. The Jemdet Nasr Period is contemporary with the early Ninevite V Period of Upper Mesopotamia and the Proto-Elamite Period of Iran, and shares with these two periods characteristics such as an emerging bureaucracy and inequality. Defining characteristics steatite and modern seal impression (found in Tell Khafajah, Iraq.)alt=A carved cylindrical object and a small plaque of clay showing a repetitive geometric design The Blau Monuments combine proto-cuneiform characters and illustrations, 3100-2700 BC. British Museum. The hallmark of the Jemdet Nasr Period is its distinctive painted monochrome and polychrome pottery. Designs are both geometric and figurative; the latter displaying trees and animals such as birds, fish, goats, scorpions, and snakes. Nevertheless, this painted pottery makes up only a small percentage of the total assemblage and at various sites it has been found in archaeological contexts suggesting that it was associated with high-status individuals or activities. At the site of Jemdet Nasr, the painted pottery was found exclusively in the settlement's large central building, which is thought to have played a role in the administration of many economic activities. Painted Jemdet Nasr Period pots were found in similar contexts at Tell Fara and Tell Gubba, both in the Hamrin Mountains. Apart from the distinctive pottery, the period is known as one of the formative stages in the development of the cuneiform script. The oldest clay tablets come from Uruk and date to the late fourth millennium BC, slightly earlier than the Jemdet Nasr Period. By the time of the Jemdet Nasr Period, the script had already undergone a number of significant changes. It originally consisted of pictographs, but by the time of the Jemdet Nasr Period it was already adopting simpler and more abstract designs. It is also during this period that the script acquired its iconic wedge-shaped appearance. While the language in which these tablets were written cannot be identified with certainty, it is thought to have been Sumerian. The texts deal without exception with administrative matters such as the rationing of foodstuffs or listing objects and animals. Literary genres like hymns and king lists, which become very popular later in Mesopotamian history, are absent. Two different counting systems were in use: a sexagesimal system for animals and humans, for example, and a bisexagesimal system for things like grain, cheese, and fresh fish. Contemporary archives have been found at Tell Uqair, Tell Khafajah, and Uruk. Society in the Jemdet Nasr Period Administrative tablet, Jamdat Nasr period 3100‚Äì2900 BC, probably from the city of Uruk. The centralized buildings, administrative cuneiform tablets and cylinder seals from sites like Jemdet Nasr suggest that settlements of this period were very organized, with a central administration regulating all aspects of the economy, from crafts to agriculture to the rationing of foodstuffs. The economy seems to have been primarily concerned with subsistence based on agriculture and sheep-and-goat pastoralism and small- scale trade. Very few precious stones or exotic trade goods have been found at sites of this period. However, the homogeneity of the pottery across the southern Mesopotamian plain suggests intensive contacts and trade between settlements. This is strengthened by the find of a sealing at Jemdet Nasr that lists a number of cities that can be identified, including Ur, Uruk, and Larsa.

The valley has been the site of a broad range of cultures for more than 10,000 years. Archaeologists have explored the remains of 450 prehistoric and historic sites in the area and have uncovered many Native American artifacts. The area was first explored by Europeans in 1701, and by 1810 a network of farms dotted the valley linked to Pittsboro, North Carolina, the county seat. The land was settled by Scottish Highlanders in the 1740s, and it saw action in both the Revolutionary and Civil wars. It became a logging center in the early 1900s as railroads such as the New Hope Valley Railway pushed through the area. Following a disastrous hurricane which struck the Cape Fear River Basin in 1945, Congress directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to undertake a comprehensive study of water resource needs in the area. The project, then known as New Hope Lake, was authorized in 1963, and construction began in 1967. In 1973, the name of the project was changed to B.

History The station was opened in 1892 by the Dublin and Belfast Junction Railways, then absorbed into the Northern Railway of Ireland. Then it was taken over by the Great Northern Railway (Ireland). The station closed under this management in 1933. On 24 June 1921, during the Irish War of Independence, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) derailed a British military train near the station. Four British soldiers were killed and twenty wounded. The attack was carried out by volunteers of the IRA's Fourth Northern Division, led by Frank Aiken. The soldiers had been returning from the opening of Northern Ireland's new parliament, which took place in Belfast two days before. Future Taoiseach √âamon de Valera was ‚Äòdeported‚Äô through this station by the Royal Ulster Constabulary in 1924 when he was arrested at the Canal Street police station, and put on the train to Dublin at Adavoyle. The building is in ruins. A dwelling house has recently been built in the grounds of the station. The Dublin-Belfast railway line, including the Enterprise services, still passes the former platforms.  Modelling  Tony Miles' Adavoyle Junction in 1963 was an important early model railway using the P4 Finescale standards. The desire to model a local broad gauge prototype, without commercial model support, meant that scratchbuilding was necessary anyway and so the adoption of P4 was less of a change than was seen by British standard gauge modellers. The railway was somewhat fictionalised, as a larger junction with two GNR branches added to it: one running north-west to Monaghan, and the other south-east to a LNWR packet port at Greenore. A typical Irish 3 foot gauge narrow gauge line ran South to Inniskeen.

J. Coates, F.L.A. London : Council of the British National Bibliography, 1960 is a faceted classification that was commissioned from E. J. Coates by the Council of the British National Bibliography to organize the content of the British Catalogue of Music. The published schedule (1960) was considerably expanded by Patrick Mills of the British Library up until its use was abandoned in 1998. Entries in the catalogue were organized by BCM classmark from the catalogue's inception in 1957 until 1982. From that year the British Catalogue of Music (which from 1974 onward was published by The British Library) was organized instead by Dewey Decimal Classification number, though BCM classmarks continued to be added to entries up to the 1998 annual cumulation. The schedule is divided into two main parts: A‚ÄìB representing Musical literature and C‚ÄìZ representing Music ‚Äì Scores and Parts. There are also seven auxiliary tables dealing with various sub-arrangements, sets of ethnic/locality subdivisions and chronological reference points. The notation is retroactive using uppercase alphabetic characters omitting I and O, with the addition of slash / and parentheses ( ) which have specific anteriorizing functions. Retroactive notation requires that the classifier combines terms in reverse schedule order. This has the benefit of producing a compact notation by removing the need for facet indicators. The schedule at A (Music Literature) parallels that from the Scores and Parts schedules thus Choral Music is at D while books about Choral Music are at AD; Harp Music is at TQ so books on harp music are at ATQ. The schedule at B accommodates books about specific composers and music in non-European traditions. As a fully faceted scheme after the ideas of S. R. Ranganathan, BCM class numbers are capable of being chain-indexed, allowing index access to each step of the hierarchy. BCM classification had a strong influence on Russell Sweeney's so-called Phoenix Dewey 780 scheduleDDC Dewey Decimal Classification : proposed revision of 780 music / prepared under the direction of Russell Sweeney and John Clews with assistance from Winton E. Mathews Jr. Albany N.Y. : Forest Press, 1980. which in turn influenced the 780 Music schedule in the 20th edition of Dewey Decimal Classification. The music schedule of the second edition (BC2) of the Bliss bibliographic classification is also strongly influenced by BCM classification. This classification system is still in use at a number of libraries, including the State Library of Western Australia and the Library at Edith Cowan University.

Construction and armament  Narcissus was constructed at Lewis‚Äôs shipyard in Aberdeen in April 1941, with the express purpose of joining the Battle of the Atlantic as a convoy escort. She was to act as a platform, from which attacking German submarines could be detected above or below the surface anytime, and driven away or destroyed. She was equipped with sonar and, eventually, type-271 radar and armed with depth charge rails and throwers. A forward throwing Hedgehog was added at a later date.  War Service  After her crew had been worked up at the training base at Tobermory in August 1941, she joined the Clyde Escort Force at Greenock on the River Clyde. Apart from three annual refits and a rearmament at Govan, Fort William and Troon, she escorted merchant ships continuously for three years. Narcissus went across the North Atlantic to Newfoundland; across the Bay of Biscay to Gibraltar; and once to Freetown and back. During the course of these convoys, she expended countless depth charges against under-water contacts and picked up survivors from several Allied ships. In March 1943, she took part in the rescue of survivors of the destroyer , which had been sunk by during the passage of convoy HX 228.

Biography Holt played for a number of clubs before signing for Everton in August 1888. His first club was called King's Own Blackburn, then he joined Blackpool St. John's in 1886, a club that pre- dated Blackpool but ceased to exist as the latter became the major club for the town. He then played for his hometown club of Church before returning to Blackpool to play for Blackpool F.C. He then went to Merseyside where, in football terms, he stayed and became a local favourite. He joined Bootle in 1887 and that must be where Everton discovered him as he signed for Everton to play in their inaugural Football League season in August 1888. Holt was a relatively small man at 5 ft 5in, but he was considered to be one of the best centre-halves in the United Kingdom during the 1890s, as well as being a character in the game of football. He was a pocket dynamo with boundless energy, he could outjump the tallest opponent but was a temperamental player, known for his petty and crafty fouls performed on the blind side of the referee. His nickname, a bit of a mouthful, was \\"Little Everton Devil\\". 1888‚Äì1889 season Johnny Holt made his League debut on 8 September 1888, as a wing‚Äìhalf, at Anfield, the then home of Everton. The home team defeated the visitors, Accrington 2‚Äì1. Johnny Holt played in 17 of the 22 League matches played by Everton in season 1888‚Äì89. As a centre‚Äìhalf (13 appearances) he played in an Everton defence that achieved a clean sheet on two occasions and restricted the opposition to one‚ÄìLeague‚Äìgoal‚Äìin‚Äìa‚Äìmatch on four separate occasions.

As Sir William Howard, he was elected Member of Parliament for Surrey in 1597. However, two days before the Parliament met his father was raised to an Earldom. This meant that, as his heir, William acquired the courtesy title Lord Howard of Effingham. It seems that all concerned mistakenly believed that this disqualified him from sitting in the House of Commons,http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/howard- sir-william-1577-1615 and his younger brother, Charles, was elected to replace him and sat for Surrey throughout the Parliament. However, the same mistake was not made at the next election and William represented Surrey in the Parliament of 1601. In 1603, he was summoned to the House of Lords in his father's barony by a writ of acceleration, and sat as a peer until his death. However, he died before his father, without male issue. Both the Earldom and barony were therefore eventually inherited by his younger brother, and William is not considered by some sources to have succeeded as 3rd Baron Howard of Effingham. Howard married Ann St John, daughter of John St John, 2nd Baron St John of Bletso, on 7 February 1597: they had one daughter, Elizabeth (1603‚Äì1671), who married John Mordaunt, 1st Earl of Peterborough.

Career Williams graduated from University of California, Berkeley with a B.A in Comparative Literature in 1969, and then earned a PhD at the University of Colorado for her dissertation subsequently published as Figures of Desire: A Theory and Analysis of Surrealist Film. Her main academic areas of interest are: film history, film genre, melodrama, pornography, feminist theory and visual culture; all with an emphasis on women, gender, race, and sexuality. With respect to film genres, she argues that horror, melodrama, and pornography all fall into the category of \\"body genres\\", since they are each designed to elicit physical reactions on the part of viewers. Horror is designed to elicit spine-chilling, white-knuckled, eye- bulging terror (often through images of blood); melodramas are designed to elicit sympathy (often through images of tears); and pornography is designed to elicit sexual arousal (often through images of \\"money shots\\").Keith, Barry. Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology. Wallflower Press: 2007 Williams believes that much pornographic expression, and the form that expression takes, is due to the distance between the audience and the actual performers, and so, she concludes, much of what pornography becomes is a type of compensation for the distance between viewer and viewed.

The gaol was designed by the NSW Colonial Architect's Office and was built from 1847 to 1945 by James Atkinson Jnr (1862‚Äì63) and William Bonython Moffatt (1871 and 1874). The gaol is also known as the Dubbo Jail and the Dubbo Gaol. The building was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 26 March 2004. The building was the second gaol in Dubbo, replacing lockups built in 1847 and 1862. When closed, the Government of New South Wales planned its demolition and replacement with a multi-storey office block. Protests led by the then Dubbo City Council and local historical society led to the plans being dropped. In 1973 the building was transferred from the NSW Department for Corrections to the city council, with the intention of restoration and creation of a tourist attraction.  History  The Dubbo Gaol was erected on the site of the original courthouse. It is believed to have been officially opened in 1887. Many of the buildings however were already in existence by this time. Many changes and new buildings followed. The surrounding wall also changed shape. Closed as a gaol in 1966, the complex re-opened as a tourist attraction in 1974. In 2015 Old Dubbo Jail won a silver prize in the cultural tourism category of the 12th Travel Inland Tourism Awards. The Gaol was inducted into the Tourism Hall of Fame.Dubbo Photo News. 30 July 2015. In August 2016 the gaol was closed to allow extensive restoration and renovation of the site.Star FM. Dubbo. 1 August 2016.  Description  The Old Dubbo Gaol is a small, compact gaol located within the central business district of Dubbo. The enclosing wall is extensive and high. It is built of Dubbo red-brown bricks in English bond, with piers, laid in lime mortar. Above the north-eastern corner of the wall is a watchtower having a wide eaved roof of corrugated iron. Originally a catwalk extended from the watchtower. The structure inside the gaol wall include the main male cell block with 12 ordinary cells and specialised cells comprising two solitary confinement cells, a padded cell, a condemned cell; the female cell block comprising two cells, a bathroom and exercise yard; the infirmary and kitchen block, including a kitchen, infirmary, Library, bathroom, two store rooms, two offices; two remand yards adjacent to a debtors exercise yard and an early toilet block, laundry building with toilets and fenced exercise yards, sanitary disposal facility, toilet. The buildings are mainly sandstone with hipped corrugated iron roofs, while the entrance, watchtower and women's cell block are of brick. The infirmary and kitchen and the male exercise yard feature simple wooden brackets to the verandah posts. The gallows were re-erected. = Condition = As at 8 December 2010, the physical condition of the buildings is good, however, rising damp is a problem in some areas. Fences are suffering from dry rot. The re-erected gallows are in poor, deteriorating condition. The first two public buildings in Dubbo - a police residence and court house/lockup were built in this precinct. There were two prisons and two court houses built within the precinct prior to the construction of the present buildings. Archaeological potential would be expected to be medium to high in a number of areas. Some features lost but reasonably authentic restoration overall. Built over a number of different periods always changing. More sympathetic signs suggested. = Modifications and dates = Modifications since initial construction are: *1847-48 - First police residence and courthouse/lockup built *1862-63 - New court house and watch house built, designed by Colonial Architects office. *1869-70 - Additions to back of court house. *1871 - New stone watch house or lock up built - beginning of Dubbo Gaol. *1873-74 Additions - extension to cell block with 5 cells, fenced enclosure around the east end of cell block, *1877-80 - major extensions - hospital and kitchen block, perimeter wall and two watchtowers, shelter sheds. *1886-87 - major alterations and additions including construction of residences (gaoler's), re- located entrance, women's cells & bathroom, new gateway/entrance *1895-98 - extension of gaol wall, removal of one watchtower, new trial yard, shelter sheds, new office and guard room etc. *1928-29 - extensive renovations and additions, including new gaolers residence *1934 - sewerage connected and modifications to bathrooms etc. *1945 - two trial yards extended  Heritage listing  As at 24 July 2003, Old Dubbo Gaol is of State, regional and Local significance and is listed on the now defunct Register of the National Estate. The presence of the gaol is a significant reminder of the unusual origins of the City of Dubbo as a regional centre for the judiciary before it became a location of commerce and habitation. Although no longer a working gaol, it served the area both as a Police and minor Gaol in the 95 years of operation as part of the facilities for the administration of justice across the region. It is a survivor of the \\"Hay\\" type of gaol typical of the New South Wales justice system. Most of these have now disappeared or are very much altered. It is associated with a James Barnet Court House within the precinct. Old Dubbo Gaol also has social significance as a major tourist attraction in the city and is also seen as an underutilised civic amenity. It is of social significance for the fact that it was saved from demolition by State government actions by a group of local citizens in 1974. The survival of the gaol is due to their enthusiasm and energy. Its social significance is also extended to surviving inmates and their relatives and descendants, both of European and Aboriginal extract. The Old Dubbo Gaol has aesthetic significance as a group of well proportioned and well constructed buildings surrounded by grass lawns set within a brick walled compound. It is an oasis of peace and calm in the middle of a bustling modern city. Old Dubbo Gaol was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 26 March 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Old Dubbo Gaol is one of many country gaols erected in the 19th century to cope with the burgeoning population as it spread west and opened up the interior of New South Wales. By 1900 there were many prisons and lockups across the state. As such then, Old Dubbo Gaol is not important in the course, or pattern of NSW's cultural or natural history. However, it is of exceptional significance locally. The buildings erected for the purpose of the administration of justice for Dubbo and the surrounding region were the first to appear in the new settlement. The Gaol therefore traces its lineage to the beginning of the city. Aboriginal association with the gaol, in terms of intercultural relations on the frontier of white settlement is exceptionally high. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Dubbo Gaol was never more than a local and regional gaol. The staff, inmates and other visitors were similar to other gaols and judicial institutions of this type across the state. The Gaol has associations with some infamous criminals, in particular, Jackie Underwood who was hanged in the Gaol in 1901 for his part in the Breelong Incident near Gilgandra. The Gaol is also associated with the Dubbo Court House, a remarkable James Barnet Court House designed c.1887. While working as the Clerk of the Court in Dubbo, Rolf Boldrewood penned the Australian classic novel, Robbery under Arms. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Old Dubbo Gaol sits within a high gaol wall in the main street of Dubbo. While the gaol itself does not have any extraordinary aesthetic appeal, the location and ambience of the buildings within the busy Dubbo CBD, provides an appealing oasis within the Dubbo CBD. Its close proximity to the aesthetically outstanding Dubbo Court House and gardens adds to this setting. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Old Dubbo Gaol does not have strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in NSW (or the local; area) for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It does however, have association with the \\"under-classes\\", in particular, rural poor, itinerant rural workers, hawkers and \\"swaggies\\". The Gaol did incarcerate a surprisingly large number of prisoners from culturally diverse backgrounds, particularly the Chinese. Of the eight men hanged in the Gaol, two were Aboriginal, two were Chinese and one was a Dane. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The history of the Gaol is now well researched and it is unlikely that any significant new material will emerge from the place. Archaeological excavations may reveal some interesting information or remains but nothing that could be gleaned from other sites. A very large number of Aboriginal people from the region were incarcerated in the Gaol during the process of dispossession, and future research may reveal some interesting episodes in the history of inter-cultural relations in a \\"frontier\\" location. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Old Dubbo Gaol is uncommon in its completeness. It is possibly the most complete country gaol listed on the register of the National Estate for New South Wales. Most of the other country gaols have been removed, demolished, or altered so significantly that it is not easy to interpret their origins and functions. In this respect Old Dubbo Gaol has HIGH significance for the State and for the region beyond the Blue Mountains. The free standing, demountable scaffold, is probably unique in Australia and therefore highly significant to the study of capital punishment in Australia. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Old Dubbo Gaol is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of NSW's cultural; or natural places in that it closely follows the \\"Hay\\" style of country gaol as identified by J. S. Kerr. In this it is judged as being of HIGH significance. It would gain a higher rating if the Gaoler's Cottage was still standing. As both the early and the later cottages have been demolished the gaol is not complete. However, in its current state of preservation it is a remarkably intact survivor of its type.

Three months later he was sent to the English mission, but was discovered almost immediately by the agents of the Government; after the Gunpowder Plot, the English state was particularly active in hunting down Catholic priests. He was brought to trial, under the statute of 27 Elizabeth, on the charge of receiving orders abroad, and condemned to death. By an act of clemency, this sentence was commuted to banishment for life; but after a brief exile, Flathers returned to England and his mission. After ministering for a short time to Catholics in Yorkshire, he was again apprehended. Brought to trial at York on the charge of being ordained abroad and exercising priestly functions in England, Flathers was offered his life on condition that he take the recently enacted Oath of Allegiance.

This drawing assumes very low air temperatures, with rapid refreezing of the water inside the lead. Aerial view of the Chukchi Sea between Chukotka and Alaska, displaying a pattern of leads. Much of the open water inside those leads is already covered by new ice (indicated by a slightly lighter blue color). A lead (, rhymes with \\"reed\\") is a large fracture within an expanse of sea ice, defining a linear area of open water that can be used for navigation purposes.http://www.aari.nw.ru/gdsidb/XML/volume1.php?lang1=0&lang2;=1&arrange;=1Environment Canada - Weather and Meteorology - Ice GlossaryAll About Sea Ice, Introduction :: National Snow and Ice Data Center Leads vary in width from meters to hundreds of meters.sea ice (ice formation) : Sea ice formation and features - Britannica Online Encyclopedia As is the case for polynyas (another sea ice feature involving open water), leads allow the direct interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean, and are important for Arctic sea ice ecology. Additionally it has been lately found that ice leads contribute significantly to the amount of mercury deposited onto surface and leaked into the ocean.Weiss J. and Marcq S. (2012). Influence of sea ice lead-width distribution on turbulent heat transfer between the ocean and the atmosphere. The Cryosphere, 6, 143‚Äì156 If the air is cold enough (typically in the winter), the water within a lead quickly refreezes, such that in many cases, leads are partly or entirely covered by a thin layer of new ice.Weeks, W. F. (2010) On sea ice (Chap. 11). University of Alaska Press, Fairbanks, 664 p.  Differences between leads and polynyas  Unlike polynyas, which tend to occur, and remain, at a given location, leads are transient features that can form anywhere in an ice-covered ocean. Moreover, while the origin of polynyas is linked with either warm air current circulation from the coastline or a warm water upwelling, the driving force behind lead formation is a state of stress, either wind- or current-induced, within the plane of the ice. Lead formation is therefore tied in with synoptic-scale weather patterns, typically lasting a few days. Also, because the open water within a lead tends to quickly refreeze, the contribution of leads to heat exchange and water vapour output to the atmosphere is significantly less than that of polynyas, where refreezing of the open water is prevented.  Formation  Sea ice is often classified according to whether or not it is attached (or frozen) to the shoreline. If attached, it is called land fast ice. Otherwise, it is called drift ice and is free to move with currents and winds. This is why leads typically belong to the drift ice zone. They are seen as a stress relieving mechanism, in response to divergent current flows or the effects of wind. Leads are cracks or fissures that initiate inside an otherwise continuous sea ice cover, and open up progressively afterward. They are linear features, though generally not rigorously straight, as they may comprise any number of short offsets at an angle with the general trend of the initial crack. This crack may cut right across both thin and thick ice. Because leads are associated with the initial break up of an ice cover, they open the way to various dynamic processes that can take place afterward, involving the interaction between individual floes, such as the formation of pressure ridges.Weeks, W. F. (2010) On sea ice (Chap. 12). University of Alaska Press, Fairbanks, 664 p. Depending on the state of stress within the drift zone, leads may also close up. As the two sides converge back toward each other, this can lead to finger rafting of the new ice inside the lead.  Ice formation in leads  Once a crack occurs within the ice cover and begins to expand to make up a lead, the open water inside the lead is exposed to the cold air temperatures and will freeze. Because wind fetch inside a lead is typically very short, wave action is considerably reduced. Ice growth therefore takes place in a low energy regime environment. Following a stage of frazil ice formation, which sometimes results from seeding by snow crystals, the resulting thin ice skim is followed by the growth of congelation ice. In windier regions, as in the Southern Ocean, frazil ice accumulation may occur along the downwind side of leads. If the ice on that side is thin, the frazil may be driven below that ice (resulting in a complex interlayering pattern). Leads affect global water circulation. As ice begins to form inside a lead, it incorporates some of the salt in the seawater This is why sea ice is saline. but rejects most of it. This brine then sinks, inducing convective processes in the water column below.  Types  There are a few types of leads: * A blind lead is a lead that is closed off ‚Äì both ends terminate within the drift ice zone. * A flaw lead is a lead that forms between the fast ice zone and the drift ice zone. * An open lead is a lead that connects two bodies of open water ‚Äì the term is also used for a lead in which open water is found. * A shore lead is a lead that forms between the drift ice zone and the shore.

Following this he undertook a doctorate in Chemistry which he started at Bangor University and completed at the University of Bristol under the supervision of Professor F. Gordon A. Stone. Following a spell as a post doctoral researcher, at the University of Sheffield under the supervision of Professor Sidney Kettle, he took up a position at Queen Elizabeth College, London as a lecturer in chemistry. His years as a Chemist were highly productive leading to numerous publications in the field of vibrational spectroscopy of isolated molecules, group theory and crystal chemistry. Over time he developed an increasing interest in solid-state physics. In the 1970s, Iain retrained as a theologian and clergyman at New College, Edinburgh. He spent a year of his early career in the ministry at Princeton University researching a PhD in theology under the supervision of Professor Thomas F. Torrance. As a systematic theologian, his work focused on the relationship between Science and Religion and he published several books in this field.

It was made from 1935 until 1973 by John Allen and Sons in Cowley, Oxfordshire. The company, formerly the Eddison and Nodding Company, was bought in 1897 by John Allen, who renamed it the Oxford Steam Plough Company, and then renamed it to John Allen and Sons.Christine Edbury: Highlights of the British Collection: Aerial Photographs - Major Allen's Life and Work (1891-1940). January 2012 at britisharchaeology.ashmus.ox.ac.uk Accessed 3 March 2018 Description The Allen Scythe does not resemble a hand scythe but serves the same purpose. The engine drives a or or 4ft wide toothed blade sliding back and forth horizontally across stationary teeth to produce a scissor action, and also drives two large wheels for forward travel. There are handles to allow the machine to be controlled by an operator walking behind it, controls comprise throttle and clutch. The wheels are driven through ratchets which allow either wheel to free-wheel when steering the machine (the wheel on the outside of the turn will be able to rotate faster than the inside wheel). This system is simpler than a differential axle and, unlike a differential, means that when one wheel slips the other keeps turning and driving the machine forwards. It has the disadvantage that the machine can run away from the operator downhill and for this reason the ratchet mechanisms can be locked. The machines are extremely robust and many from the 1950s are still in regular use. They can be dangerous, as the clutch system only disengages the wheel drive from the engine: the blades cut all the time the engine runs. Later models were available with different attachments, including rotating brushes that replaced the cutting head, air or water pumps and saws or hedge trimmers that drove from the starting pulley side of the engine. Engine John Allen and Sons used a number of engine types, the most common being a Villiers two-stroke with magneto ignition and rope start. The engines may fail to start because of ignition problems.

Among the shop's customers were Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger, John Lennon and Jimi Hendrix. Robert Orbach arranged for his ex boss Warren Gold aka Lord John to rent the shop in Wardour Street to John Paul. Another new branch of Kitchener's was opened in Foubert's Place, off Carnaby Street, also arranged by Orbach selling militaria and Swinging London novelty items, that was rented from Henry Moss and Harry Fox of Lady Jane fame. In 1967 two more Kitchener's outlets opened on Carnaby Street and later expanded to sites in Piccadilly Circus and then King's Road (where the shop was named I Was Lord Kitchener's Thing). The military uniforms on sale largely consisted of scarlet tunics derived from pre-1914 stocks that had been withdrawn from regular army use upon the outbreak of World War I. In the summer of 1967, Fisk and Paul dissolved their partnership. Fisk took sole ownership of the Portobello road premises, which became the Injun Dog head- shop (subtitled Once I Was Lord Kitchener's Valet).

Raja Bakht-Mal's reign covered an eventful period in Indian history. Like his father he was in good terms with the Lodi dynasty of Delhi. After the conquest of India by Babar in 1526 the Pathania Kingdom must not have come under Mughal control, because on the flight of babar's son Humayun in 1540 and the accession of Sher Shah Suri at Delhi, Bakht-Mal was still in good terms with the Sur dynasty. The Tarikh-i-Daudi says that the famous fortress of Maukot was erected within the pathania Kingdom by Islam Shah Suri (1545‚Äì53), that is during the reign of Raja Bakht-Mal. But it cannot be true because the practice of erecting forts in an independent Kingdom was only done after conquering it, which is not the case here because the Pathania kings ruled an independent Kingdom with a minimal submission i.e., to assist the power at Delhi in times of war. Maukot fort was probably built by the predecessors of Bakht-Mal, or he had built it in his own lifetime.  Mau or Maukot Fort  It was nearest to the plains, almost half way to Nurpur from Pathankot, situated on a low hill of Shiwalik range running east to the Chakki river. It was an enclosure surrounded by dense forests, a Castle of great strength. It was a legend in its times, a saying was in vogue: Mau Ki Muhim Yaro Maut Ki Nishani Hai, 'The expedition to Mau, friends is a call to death'. Islam Shah Suri had a narrow escape at Maukot from being assassinated. While ascending the hill from a narrow path, a man suddenly rushed upon him with a drawn sword, but he was cut down. It was then discovered that the sword had been presented some time before to one of his own officers. The fort of Maukot is frequently referred to by the Muslim historians, and figures prominently in the history of the Pathania Rajputs till the time of Shahjahan, when it was completely demolished because of the threat it imposed on the Mughals. In 1553, Mirza Kamran, younger brother of Humayun, on being driven out of Kabul retired to India and sought an asylum with Islam Shah Sur. He was detained as a prisoner but succeeded in making his escape and fled to Raja Bakht-Mal. He made his way to Maukot in disguise, there he found himself in danger and escaped to the Gakhars, by whom he was surrendered to Humayun and blinded. Sikandar Shah Suri after being driven out of Delhi took refuge in the fortress of Maukot. Bakht-Mal was always in good terms with the Sur dynasty therefore he supported him and defended Maukot, which was besieged by the Mughals for six months. On surrender of the fort in July 1557, Sikandar Shah Suri was permitted to retire to Bengal where a Jagir was assigned to him. = Shahpurkandi Fort = According to the book The history of the Punjab Hills, Raja Bakht-Mal built this fort on the Ravi river. But other accounts say that the fort was built by Jaspal Singh Pathania around 1505, he must have been a General of Raja Bhil Pal Pathania. It was built strategically to have control over the Kangra and the Nurpur regions. The Pathania Clan was famous for its resistance, and they were almost always in war with the invaders of Hindustan. Despite this fact the paramount powers at Delhi regarded them as crucial allies, and only asked for nominal allegiance during times of war. Yet time after time the Pathania Kings would rebel against superior numbers of the imperial armies. A passage in the Maasir-ul-Umara says that after the capture of Sikandar Shah Suri, Raja Bakht-Mal was captured and taken to the fort of Lahore where he was rendered helpless, which has been translated as killed. But this is not true, because it was not easy to capture a Rajput and that too a ruling chief, because according to the Rajput code, when defeat was certain he would fight to the death. Raja Bakht-mal probably died fighting against Akbar, when he had invested the fort of Maukot to capture Sikandar Shah Suri. After his death, his brother, Pahari-Mal ascended on the throne in 1557.

After his wife's death in 1911 it has been suggested that the two would have married but for the opposition of Freshfield's family. Still living at Tylehurst with her parents, Needham participated in the London season for some years, but gave it up in favour of gardening and home pursuits. Her sister Evelyn had married and had four sons, and Needham was a devoted aunt, telling bedtime stories which formed the basis of the 'Stormy Petrel' adventures. Her attempts at being published were turned down on the grounds that the work was too difficult for children. Following the deaths of Freshfield and Charles Needham in 1934, and Amy Needham in 1936, Tylehurst was sold and Violet went to live in London.

The eleven Ruritanian novels, sometimes known as the Empire series or the Stormy Petrel series, are set in three fictional countries in Eastern Europe: the Empire, Flavonia, and Ornowitza, the latter being a small duchy between the other two. Her first novel, The Black Riders, introduces the hero Dick Fauconbois, known as the \\"Stormy Petrel\\". He lives in the Empire, although he visits Flavonia during the course of the novel.

With about 1,250 students aged 11 to 18, it is the biggest single-sex grammar school in England.  History  Altrincham Grammar School for Girls was founded in 1910. With many other schools, it was a product of the 1902 Education Act, which set out to build new schools to provide enhanced education for girls. Originally dual schools for girls and boys were envisaged for the site, which had been occupied by a substantial derelict house with spacious grounds, Bowdon Lodge. However, it was finally agreed that there was insufficient space for both, and the girls' school was built there and Altrincham County High School for Boys, now Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, was built elsewhere. The building was designed to accommodate one hundred and eighty children, thirty of whom were at nursery age, and the school was opened on Monday, 4 July 1910. In September 1910, the school was eventually populated by sixty pupils. Three full-time and five part-time staff were employed. In 1931, the school's 21st anniversary, it lost most of its preparatory department. The headmistress for the first twenty-three years of AGGS was Miss Mary Howes Smith; she retired in 1933. The school motto, which can still be seen on an illuminated light-oak board in the main hall, is Fortiter, Fideliter, Feliciter: Bravely, Faithfully and Cheerfully. During the late 1960s the school expanded further, across Cavendish Road and into a large Victorian Villa known as 'Breeze Hill'. The villa had extensive grounds, which the school put to good use with a number of Portakabin like classroom structures. The rooms within the villa were also made into classrooms including a large art room which benefited from the light from the large Victorian windows. The difficulty came as the pupils had to cross Cavendish Road, sometimes a number of times each day, and the road was fairly busy, causing safety issues. The school has undergone much building work. In 1983, Fairlie was built on the opposite side of Cavendish Road. The school has seen developments to the Main school building as well, beginning with the science block at the East Wing was built, and continuing with a new reception area and Dining room, plus a new science staffroom and four new science labs. The West wing, with a new library, was added in 2003. It features a floating first floor with a stainless steel staircase in the middle. The most recent addition to AGGS is the new Breeze Hill, replacing an older building of the same name and including three Geography and History rooms and an ICT suite as well as a Training Room, where courses and conferences for teachers from around the North-West are held. In 2010 the school celebrated its centenary year; a centenary garden was built in commemoration. In 2011, the headmistress from 1997 onward, Dame Dana Ross-Wawrzynski, set up the 'Bright Futures Educational Trust'. This is a partnership between AGGS and disadvantaged schools around East Manchester which attempts to help failing schools improve their performance. It began with Cedar Mount High School, now Cedar Mount Academy, which is located in Gorton, Manchester. Teachers from AGGS were sent on a temporary post to help teachers at Cedar Mount to improve their techniques. Heading the Trust became such a large job for Ross-Wawrzynski that she decided to hand over the management of Altrincham Grammar school for Girls to her Deputy, Mrs Mary Speakman, at the start of the school year beginning 2012. Speakman has since retired and the new head, Miss Stephanie Gill, took over her role at the start of the school year beginning 2014. In December 2017, the school announced it was introducing a gender-neutral policy in communications for the sake of transgender and gender-questioning students, and would transition away from describing pupils as \\"girls\\". The school site has been used by many production companies; the BBC used the Main Hall for the CBBC show All at Sea and it was later used by Netflix.  Results  AGGS is one of the highest achieving schools in England and has gained status as a language college. In 2000 Ofsted found it to be \\"an extremely effective school that sets very high standards and achieves these through high quality teaching and excellent management and leadership\\". Most recently it has had excellent results in national GCSE exams with all students achieving an A*-C grade (a 100% pass rate) and with 80% of these girls achieving at least a B. In 2007 it was listed fourth by The Independent among grammar schools with excellent A-level results. In 2008, At A2-Level, over 80% of students achieved all Bs or As, a high result nationally.  Feminist society controversy  In the 2010s students started a feminist society and engaged with a national campaign called Who Needs Feminism, which involved posting pictures online of themselves holding placards with statements about their feminist convictions. After students received threats and abuse online in response to the pictures, school management, which had initially been supportive, asked that they be taken down. One of the students then published an op-ed in The Guardian accusing the school of failing to protect its students. The school's statement in response said that they only \\"recommend[ed]\\" that the pictures be removed. The students' campaign has since gone national after coverage on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.

Harding was educated at Christ's Hospital and the City and Guilds College (part of Imperial College London), interrupting his studies 1918-19 with a one-year period spent as a cadet in the Officers' Training Corps. Following graduation Harding worked for Mowlem where he specialised in tunnelling work for London Underground including the reconstruction of Piccadilly Circus tube station and the expansion of the Central line. In the 1930s he and Mowlem were instrumental in introducing geotechnical processes to the UK. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Harding was placed in charge of defence and emergency repair of underground services in London. He built pre-cast concrete petrol barges and eight of the Mulberry Harbour segments used in the Normandy Landings. He was also a founding director of Soil Mechanics Ltd, a subsidiary of Mowlem dedicated to work in geotechnics. After the war Harding was involved with investigations into the feasibility of construction of a Channel Tunnel and sat on the tribunal investigating the Aberfan disaster of 1966. Harding was elected president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, was the founding chairman of the British Tunnelling Society, fellow of the City and Guilds of London Institute and fellow of Imperial College. He was also a founder fellow of the Fellowship of Engineering and governor of three separate academic institutions: Westminster Technical College. Northampton Engineering College, and Imperial College. He received a knighthood in 1968. Early life Harding was born in Wandsworth, London to Arthur Boyer Harding and his wife Helen Clinton Lowe, daughter of William Lowe, the vicar of Bunbury. His father died in 1902 and the family spent the next four years in South Africa with his mother's sister and her husband. Harold and his brother were educated at their uncle's expense at Christ's Hospital, Horsham and Harold entered the City and Guilds College (a part of Imperial College London) in 1917. He served as a full-time Officers' Training Corps cadet in 1918 before resuming his studies in 1919. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering in 1922. Work with Mowlem Upon graduation Harding joined John Mowlem & Co., an engineering contractor, where he worked on the development of the London Underground network including the reconstruction of the Piccadilly Circus tube station from 1926‚Äì29. In 1927 he married Sophie Helen Blair Leighton, an artist with whom he had constructed a model of the Piccadilly works that later found its way to the Science Museum and is now in the London Transport Museum. Sophie was the daughter of the Pre- Raphaelite inspired painter Edmund Leighton. The Hardings had a daughter and two sons. During this period Harding was the first to employ the technique of dewatering of soil in the UK and the first to use the Joosten process of stabilisation by two part chemical injection.British Tunnelling Society 2000 Harold Harding Lecture In 1931 Harding worked on the construction of the new Ford Motor Company plant at Dagenham. Major foundation problems had to be overcome during the works as the plant was sited on the spot where Cornelius Vermuyden had closed a breach in the Thames in 1621‚Äì22. From this experience Harding developed an interest in chemical consolidation techniques and was a pioneer in their use. He also developed a belief in the value of the use of compressed air in difficult ground. He was in charge of the 1936‚Äì39 extension of the London Underground's Central line from Bow Road tube station to Leytonstone. World War Two Following the outbreak of the Second World War Harding was placed in charge of defence and emergency repair of underground services in London. In 1942 he co-founded Soil Mechanics Ltd, a subsidiary of Mowlem which was the first construction company concerned with geotechnics. The other founding directors were Rudolph Glossop and Hugh Golder, who later founded Golder Associates. From 1943‚Äì44 Harding was involved with the pre- casting of concrete and built several petrol barges and eight of the Mulberry Harbour segments which were used in the Normandy Landings. Post-war After the war Harding was increasingly involved with the management of Soil Mechanics Ltd and served as a director of it from 1949‚Äì55 and also as a director of Mowlem from 1950‚Äì56. Following this he worked independently as a consultant and arbitrator in the UK and abroad until 1978. He was the UK consultant with Ren√© Malcor his colleague and French counterpart from 1958‚Äì1970 of the Channel Tunnel study group investigations into the feasibility of a Channel Tunnel, which eventually resulted in the tunnel's construction in 1988‚Äì94. From 1966‚Äì67 Harding was also a member of the Aberfan disaster tribunal, chaired by Lord Justice Edmund Davies, which investigated the rotational slip of a slag heap in South Wales which caused 144 deaths. Harding died at Topsham, Devon on 27 March 1986, having been lobbying for a twin-bore tunnel solution for the Channel Tunnel up to the announcement of its go-ahead, just weeks before his death.

She was the first NSW female Minister for Education; the first female President of the New South Wales Legislative Council; and Chair and CEO of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.  Early life  She was born in Newcastle and educated at the Newcastle Girls High School from 1967 until 1968, then at Dormers Wells, Southall, UK 1969‚Äì70. She attended Newcastle Technical College 1971‚Äì73 and achieved her B.A., Dip.Ed. at the University of Newcastle.  Political career  Chadwick served as a Member of the Liberal Party State Executive before being elected to the NSW Legislative Council in 1978. She served as Opposition Whip and a member of the Opposition front bench before becoming the first female NSW Liberal Minister when the Greiner Government swept into power in 1988. Chadwick was a minister of the Greiner-Fahey era, initially serving as Minister for Family and Community Services, Minister for the Hunter and Minister for Women (25 March 198820 July 1990). Following the resignation of Education Minister Terry Metherell, Chadwick was appointed the state's first female Minister for Education (20 July 19904 April 1995), and was later given additional responsibility as Minister for Tourism (26 May 19934 April 1995). Chadwick's appointment to the Education portfolio followed Minister Terry Metherell who reduced head office staffing, introduced Basic Skills testing and increased class sizes to pay for Special Education initiatives. Metherell's style quickly escalated to war with the Teachers Union, the Parents and Citizens Federation and even his own department. The strikes and protest rallies held during this unrest were amongst the largest in NSW history. As the new Minister, Chadwick's first task was to broker peace between the Government and the Education lobby, especially teachers. The first breakthrough came with a settlement to the long-running teachers pay dispute. Parliament House, Sydney where Virginia Chadwick served as an elected representative for 20 years. During her time in Education, Chadwick drew on her consultative skills to implement extensive reforms initiated by her predecessor. (These reforms are known as \\"School Centred Education\\" (Scott Reports) and in Curriculum, the 'Carrick' and 'Excellence and Equity' Reports.) The NSW Board of Studies was established, key learning areas developed and implemented in curriculum and schools; budgeting and some staffing responsibilities were devolved to school principals; more than a thousand local school councils were established. Selective schools, \\"centres of excellence\\" and specialist schools such as Westfields Sports High School were funded to create choice in public education in Sydney's West as well as regional and rural areas of the state. A Greiner loyalist, Chadwick was concerned during the 1992 Independent Commission Against Corruption investigation of the Metherell Affair, when Greiner was forced to resign. Although a Member of the Upper House, Chadwick was viewed by many as an obvious successor to Greiner; but when approached to take the leadership, she declined.

In 1998 Chadwick again made history as the Parliament of New South Wales's first woman Presiding Officer with her election as President of the Legislative Council.Parliament of New South Wales, History Bulletin 6, Women in the New South Wales Parliament Her victory in the ballot for the Presidency was a surprise. The Labor Government's nominee for the position was Hon Helen Sham- Ho who had suddenly defected from the Liberal Party days before the ballot. The Government Leader in the Legislative Council, Michael Egan (Australian politician) mistakenly believed that one of the Government members who was absent from the House on leave for an exam would be paired. (Pairs are a courtesy arrangement in Parliament whereby an Opposition Member would have abstained from the vote when a Government member is absent, or vice versa). The Clerk of the Parliaments advised midway through the ballot that pairs did not apply for secret ballots. The Government tried to call off the vote but was advised that this was not possible after ballot papers for the secret ballot had been issued. Chadwick defeated Sham Ho by 21‚Äì19. She held this position from 29 June 1998 to 5 March 1999, when she retired from politics. Chadwick holds the record for the shortest presidency of the Legislative Council, being in office for 250 days.  Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority  Soon after her retirement from State politics, Federal Environment Minister Robert Hill appointed Chadwick as Chairperson and CEO of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA). She moved to Townsville with husband Bruce Chadwick and served in this role until her retirement in July 2007. Chadwick led the difficult negotiations with fishermen, farmers, tourist operators, local, state and federal Governments to achieve an increase in highly protected areas on the reef from 4.5 per cent to 33 per cent. This was recognised in 2004 when the Authority was presented a prestigious Banksia Award'Banksia Award Recognises New Zoning Plan' GBRMPA Media Release /6/2004 http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/media/media_archive/2004/banksia_award_recognises_new_zoning_plan by the Banksia Environmental Foundation. Following a potential crisis involving an oil tanker attempting to navigate through the Reef, Chadwick was appointed to a safety inquiry and so impressed the stakeholders she was then appointed to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) Advisory Committee. She subsequently led an Australian delegation to the United Nations on International Law of the Sea. In the 2005 Queen's Birthday Honours Chadwick was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia.

Currently located to the south of Lago de Valencia, the monastic community was originally established as a mission procure in Caracas following World War I. Caracas' expansion restrained the development of the abbey, and in the late 1980s the monks relocated to G√ºig√ºe. The community's superior is Fr Abbot Jos√© Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez Barrera. HistoryEarly Days in Caracas= Like the Missionary Benedictines' Newton Abbey and Christ the King Priory, the original monastic community in Caracas was established at the behest of Archabbot Norbert Weber in the wake of World War I. The Congregation had learned the dangers of having all of its resources concentrated in Germany. If another crisis were to occur, the survival of the missions required that personnel be spread around the world. With this in mind, Archabbot Weber took over a boys' boarding school in Caracas, Venezuela. The site was also the location of a shrine to St Joseph, devotion to which the new residents continued to foster. The first Missionary Benedictines arrived from Germany on April 2, 1923. Among the group were some with mission experience in Africa, and others who had worked at an attempted monastic foundation in Argentina. The monks continued to maintain the school, but added technical training to the boys' academic regimen. The many visitors to the shrine of San Jos√© del Avila allowed the Benedictines to exercise their charism of hospitality. The shrine inspired the creation of the \\"Pia Union de San Jos√© del Avila\\", whose members supported the activities of the Missionary Benedictines. This was a great advantage in the days monastery's early days, when efforts were concentrated at procuring funds for the Congregation's missions. In its initial stages, the monastery depended entirely on expatriate German vocations. This source was interrupted by World War II, during which the Congregation's German monasteries were forcibly shut down by the Nazi regime. Thus, the Venezuelan monastery needed to cultivate local vocations in order to stay alive. However, the culturally German character of the abbey made it difficult to entice Venezuelans to join. An effort to cater to local vocations led the community to gather several monks from monasteries in Spain. The drought of local vocations continued, until the monks opened a house in Bogot√°, Colombia in 1961. =Relocation to G√ºig√ºe= In 1964, seventeen years after becoming a conventual priory, San Jos√© del Avila was raised to the status of an abbey, under the leadership of Fr Abbot Theobald Schmid. At this time, the community was quite international, featuring monks from Germany, Switzerland, Spain, and France. However, as the community continued to grow, so did the city of Caracas. While San Jos√© had been on the city's outskirts at the time of its founding, by 1976 the monastery had to deal with the deafening noise produced by nearby eight-lane highways. Thus, in 1981, it was decided to permanently relocate to a rural area about 150 km southwest of Caracas. On August 10, 1985, the monks took up temporary residence in Camuri Chaco, east of Caracas, while a permanent monastery at G√ºig√ºe was under construction. View of Valencia Lake from the abbey The new, modern-looking monastery at G√ºig√ºe now stands in marked contrast to the traditional shrine that the monks had inhabited in Caracas. Following four years of construction, the monks were able to move into their new building. On June 20, 1990, the archbishop of Valencia consecrated the abbey's church. The change in location brought about a corresponding change in apostolate. Now the monks concentrated their efforts on hospitality and spiritual direction. Agriculture also provided a source of regular income. Dependencies * El Rosal: Founded near Bogot√°, Colombia, in 1961, El Rosal was raised to the status of a simple priory in 1963. The monastery was founded with the intent of recruiting and training local monastic vocations. The community became a conventual priory in 1992. Its eight monks are under the leadership of Fr Prior Marcos Dworschak. * Camuri Chaco: In possession of the Missionary Benedictines since 1948, the Abbey of G√ºig√ºe has leased out this land since 1988. Personnel Like many religious communities, G√ºig√ºe Abbey has experienced a significant decrease in vocations since the Second Vatican Council. In 1970, the community's population peaked at 54 professed monks. As of May 18, 2011, G√ºig√ºe Abbey has ten solemnly professed monks, four of whom are priests. The monastery also has two novices and one lay oblate G√ºig√ºe Abbey is governed by Abbot Jos√© Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez Barrera. Elected as the community's second abbot in 1982, he resigned his leadership position in 2002. From 2007 to 2011, he acted as the community's prior administrator. Mart√≠nez Barrera was reelected abbot on January 11, 2011.

He was the younger brother of Pope Urban V. He was born about 1315 in the Castle of Grizac, now located in the commune of Le Pont-de-Montvert, the son of William de Grimoard, Lord of Bellegarde, and of Amph√©lise de Montferrand. As a young man, he joined the Canons Regular of Saint Augustine at the Abbey of Saint Rufus near Valence. In 1358 he became prior of the Priory of St.-Pierre-de-Dieu. In September 1362 his older brother, the Benedictine Abbot Guillaume, was elected pope. His brother named him Bishop of Avignon that following December. Four years later, in a consistory held at Avignon on 18 September 1366, Grimoard was created Cardinal Priest, with the title of San Pietro in Vincoli, long held by canons regular. In September 1367 he was promoted to the rank of Cardinal-Bishop of Albano. He was Papal Vicar for the administration of the Papal States from 1368 until 1371. In this office, he tried to conquer the city of Forl√¨, which was a Ghibelline town, but was never able to do so. At the end of 1370, the dying Pope Urban, who had returned to Avignon after a brief stay in Rome, asked to be moved to Anglic's residence, that he might be closer to the people he loved. He died there on 19 December.American Catholic.org \\"Blessed Pope Urban V After the ensuing conclave held in Avignon to choose the new pope, Grimoard was named archpriest of the Lateran Basilica, succeeding Cardinal Pierre Roger de Beaufort, who had been elected Pope Gregory XI. He became Dean of the Sacred College in November 1373. He chose not to return to Rome with Gregory, who returned the residence of the papacy to Rome in 1376. After the outbreak of the Great Western Schism in 1378 he gave his allegiance to the Antipope Clement VII, in consequence of which he lost his position as Dean of the collegiate chapter of York. Cardinal Grimoard was never able to participate in either of the conclaves held during his cardinalate as he was serving in Italy when his brother died, and was in Avignon for the following one, which was held in Rome.

Among couples seeking sex therapy, problems of sexual desire are the most commonly reported dysfunctions, yet have historically been the most difficult to treat successfully. Sexual satisfaction in a relationship has a direct relationship with overall relationship satisfaction and relationship well-being. Sexual desire and sexual frequency do not stem from the same domains, sexual desire characterizes an underlying aspect of sexual motivation and is associated with romantic feelings while actual sexual activity and intercourse is associated with the development and advancement of a given relationship. Thus together, sexual desire and sexual frequency can successfully predict the stability of a relationship. While higher individual sexual desire discrepancies among married individuals may undermine overall relationship well-being, higher SDD scores for females may be beneficial for romantic relationships, because those females have high levels of passionate love and attachment to their partner. Studies suggest that women with higher levels of desire relative to that of their partners' may experience fewer relationship adjustment problems than women with lower levels of desire relative to their partners'. Empirical evidence has shown that sexual desire is a factor that heavily influences couple satisfaction and relationship continuity which has been one of the main reasons for the interest in this research domain of human sexuality.  Heterosexual couples  Marital couples = In married couples, husbands have been found to experience higher sexual desire discrepancies than their wives. Those who individually experience higher rates of sexual desire discrepancy during their marriage exhibit lower levels of satisfaction in the relationship. This high discrepancy has also been found to impair other aspects of the relationship. For example, an increase in relationship instability, more negative communication within the relationship and an increase in conflict all result from high desire discrepancies. It has also been established that sexual desire and frequency of sex decreased as the length of marriage increased. Further investigation has revealed that this attenuation occurs within the first 2 years of marriage. = Non-marital couples = High desire discrepancies affect men differently to women in a relationship. Men experience reduced sexual satisfaction while women experience reduced relationship satisfaction. Other studies have found men also experience lower relationship satisfaction when desire discrepancy is high. Furthermore, research by Davies, Katz and Jackson (1999) shows that of the individuals studied, approximately 25% reported believing their personal level of sexual desire to be different to that of their partner's, implying that not all couples who experience SDD label it as such. Same-sex couplesLesbian couples= Low sexual desire discrepancies (low sexual desire and low sexual frequency) are common amongst lesbian couples, similar to heterosexual women in a relationship.Nichols, M. (1995) Sexual desire disorder in a lesbian couple: the intersection of therapy and politics. In R. Rosen & S. Leiblum (Eds.) Case studies in sex therapy (pp. 161-175). New York: Guilford PressLoulan, J. (1987) Lesbian passion. San Francisco: Spinsters Ink. The sexual frequency between lesbian couples are reported as less frequent in comparison to gay male, heterosexual, married and unmarried couples. To support this notion, a study looked at 1,500 lesbian women who were in a relationship where 78% were initially uninvolved in sexual activities. Blumstein and Schwartz reported in ‚ÄòAmerican Couples‚Äô that in a sample of lesbian women in a relationship, half of the lesbian sample had low levels of sexual contact and stated that they were dissatisfied with their sexuality suggesting low sexual desire, therefore low SDD. As well as this, the lesbian sample had reported high sexual desire and frequency at the beginning of their relationship and a pattern appeared with a decrease of sexual activity within long term relationships. However, this study comes with various criticisms. (see Lesbian bed death:criticisms). Studies show that homosexual women are particularly prone to internalizing negative homophobic societal attitudes which has detrimental affects on their self-esteem and identity. It has been proposed that homosexual women sometimes show a tendency of using defenses in an attempt to deny their homosexuality in a homophobic society. Lesbian women may thus manifest strong emotional connections to their partners but repress any sexual desires due to an unconscious internalization of society's homophobic attitudes which ultimately manifests itself in a reduced sexual desire and sexual intercourse frequency. In same-sex relationships for women, those with low sexual desire discrepancies mean that women experience low sexual activity and low satisfaction for their sexual relationship. Although, at early stages of their relationship, it is common to find high relationship satisfaction and no issues with low desire discrepancy, meaning that a good sexual satisfaction should exist. As well as lesbian women commonly reporting low sexual desire in their relationship, they also report low arousal, more issues with lubrication, low sexual satisfaction and low sexual frequency as the relationship length increases. However, research suggests that given the fact that lesbian couples in a relationship are seen to have lower sexual activity, they are likely to be satisfied with their sexual frequency similar to heterosexual women in their relationship highlighting the fact that low desire discrepancies may not necessarily be an issue for women. An explanation for low desire discrepancies for lesbian couples can be explained by the ‚Äúlesbian bed death‚Äù myth, which argues that sexual activity will significantly reduce in same-sex relationships as the length of the relationship increases, which supports the idea that lesbian couples experience high SDD at early stages in their relationships compared to later on. Other explanations for low SDD's in lesbian couples could possibly be due to the fact that women are more \\"sensual rather than sexual\\" so are less likely to participate in such sexual activities, or perhaps due to the absence of a male figure needed to elicit sexual drive.  Treatment  It has been proposed that among lesbian couples, SDD or Inhibited Sexual Desire (ISD) masks other underlying emotions, namely anger. Thus, exercises targeting underlying anger such as creating lists of \\"grievances\\" and encouraging the couple to pretend argue during a treatment session can be used to address the issues of underlying feelings of anger in an attempt to alleviate sexual dysfunction. When the believed cause for sexual desire discrepancy is believed to be a form of internalized homophobia, it is recommended to begin a treatment session with a questionnaire inquiring about the individuals' feelings towards being homosexual (\\"How do you feel about being lesbian?\\", \\"Have you ever felt suicidal as a result of your homosexuality?\\", \\"In what way do you think homosexual people are different from heterosexual people?\\"). The following suggested treatment is referrals to lesbian social and education groups for an exposure to positive homosexual role models. = Gay couples = To date, there is only a limited hand of research on gay couples sexual desire and sexual frequency. Gay males' desire for a sexual partner stems from a male's physical attractiveness and features and signs of youth. They also favour sexual activities as the fundamental component of a gay relationship.Symons, D. (1979). The evolution of human sexuality. New York: Oxford University Press. Research by Blumstein and Schwartz depicts that gay men had higher levels of sexual frequencies in comparison to lesbian women throughout all stages of their relationship. Supporting this, it was also found that white homosexual male couples reported higher levels (47%) of copulating more than once in a week compared to lesbians (32%). This was also found amongst gay Black homosexual couples reporting 65% amongst males and 56% amongst females.Bell, A.P., & Weinberg, M.S. (1978). Homosexualities:Astudy of diversity among men and women. New York: Simon & Schuster. During the first two years of a gay couples relationship, two-thirds of gay couples had sexual intercourse three of more times a week compared to lesbian couples in a two- year relationship. Even so, during a ten-year relationship 11% of gay couples copulated compared to 1% of lesbian couples signifying that gay couples have higher frequencies of sex. Given that males desire higher levels of sex in comparison to females, it is thus, common to find that gay males, in comparison to heterosexuals and lesbians, have the highest frequencies of sex across all stages of their relationships. Thus, this signifies that gay couples encounter in higher levels of sexual intercourse. Given that there is a lack of research on sexual desire amongst homosexual male couples, it is difficult to make definitive assumptions. However, there is research on sexual satisfaction amongst gay couples. Sexual satisfaction and sexual frequency are correlated amongst gay couples. A study showed that most gay couples were sexually satisfied with their partner, with 83% of men reporting \\"satisfied\\" and 7% \\"very satisfied\\".McWhirter, D. P., & Mattison, A. M. (1984). The male couple. Englewood Cliffs, NJ. Prentice-Hall. Amongst young gay male couples in (average length was 15 months), the median rating for sexual satisfaction on a 7-point scale was 5.8 and Black gay male couples reported 5.5 on the 7 point scale.Peplau, L. A., Cochran, S. D., & Mays, V. M. (1997). A national survey of the intimate relationships of African-American lesbians and gays: A look at commitment, satisfaction, sexual behavior, and HIV disease. In B. Greene (Ed.), Ethnic and cultural diversity among lesbians and gay men (pp. 11‚Äì38). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. As well as this, males have higher testosterone levels in comparison to females. Testosterone is able to fuel sex drive amongst men and women. Gay couples, therefore together obtain more testosterone thus, ultimately could be a suggestion as to why gay couples have more sexual encounters than lesbian and heterosexual couples. Thus, suggesting that gay couples desire discrepancy involves high sexual desire and high sexual frequency (however, research is needed to confirm this). Despite such reports, literature states that gay men can vary between sexual desire and sexual frequencies,Sanderson, T. (1994). A-Z of gay sex. London: Other Way Press conveying that gay male couples may not always obtain high sexual desires and high sexual frequencies. Even so, sexual frequency amongst gay couples can also reduce over time, similar to lesbian couples and heterosexual couples. This conveys that currently, there is no definitive conclusion on desire discrepancy amongst gay couples. However, when gay men are clinically diagnosed with Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (see Desire Discrepancy Disorders below), clinicians take self-inflicted homophobia, interpersonal issues, attitude, lack of appropriate sex education and early life experience trauma into account as possible predisposition factors for the onset of the disorder.  Treatment  Re-labeling internal cues is one path of SDD treatment in gay couples. Zilbergeld and Ellison (1980) proposed that sometime when an individual believes they feel a desire for sexual intercourse, what they actually feel is a desire for interpersonal closeness and reassurance. In such cases, treatment focuses on teaching individuals how to differentiate desires for closeness from desires for sexual intercourse and express them in a more appropriate manner. Sometimes, desire discrepancy may arise when partner A feels repeatedly rejected after their attempts at initiating sex. This may be because partner B is simply not interested or not in the mood but may also be because partner B just happens to be more passive in nature and thus relies on partner A to do the initiating. In such cases, it is suggested that feelings of both partners should be discussed and their patterns of initiating and rejecting explored.  Desire discrepancy disorders  In one of the previous editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-4), a particularly low degree of sexual desire would have been the main diagnostic criteria for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). However, since the release of the DSM-5 in 2013, the disorder has been redefined and distinguished by gender differences being female sexual interest/arousal disorder and male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Research has found for both men and women suffering from low sexual desire on a clinical level, significantly lower levels of sexual satisfaction as well as lower levels of overall relationship adjustment are reported. Due to its adverse effects on an individual's sexual satisfaction, it has been shown to negatively affect a relationship overall. = Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (FSIAD) = According to the DSM-5, females who have experienced a lack of sexual interest/arousal for a period of at least 6 months can be diagnosed with FSIAD. This condition is specified by a lessened desire for, and pleasure from, sexual activity in the absence of other non-sexual mental disorders, medical conditions or relationship distress (e.g. domestic violence). It is also characteristic for the individual to experience clinical distress as a result of the condition which can be further classified as either mild, moderate or severe distress. The DSM-5 notes that low desire discrepancy, whereby a woman has a lower desire for sex than her partner, is not sufficient for the diagnosis of FSIAD but rather a reduction or absence in: * sexual activity * sexual fantasies * receptivity to partner's initiation of sexual activity * receptivity to internal or external cues for sexual activity * sensations in genital or non-genital regions during sexual activity The disorder can be further subdivided as either: * Lifelong: apparent since the woman became sexually active. * Acquired: onset occurred after normal sexual functioning. * Generalised: present across different partners, contexts or type of stimulations. * Situational: limited to certain partners, contexts or type of stimulations. It is associated with dyspareunia, mood disorders, problems orgasming and dysfunctional relationships. The DSM also states that women who experience FSIAD may also hold unconventional expectations of what a 'normal' level of sexual interest is and a lack of knowledge of sexuality.  Risk factors  Problems with relationships and social development history (e.g. relationship with caregiver or childhood stressors) and a history with mental disorders have been shown to be influencing factors. Certain medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus and thyroid dysfunction are clinically known to predispose women to FSIAD.  Assessment tool  The Sexual Interest and Desire Inventory‚ÄìFemale (SIDI-F) was created as a tool for clinicians to assess FSIAD in female patience. It is a 13 item scale is reportedly holds high internal consistency and high internal validity. It is the most credible measurement tool to date and is the most specified tool for assessing FSIAD (formerly known and referred to HSDD in women in the original paper) = Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (MHSDD) = The DSM 5 has characterised the diagnostic features of MHSDD as males experiencing deficient or no erotic fantasies and desire for sexual activity for a period of at least 6 months. The level of deficiency in patients is determined by clinicians who take factors such as age and socio-cultural environment of the individual into account which may affect the individual's sexual functioning. The manifestation of personal distress due to the disorder in the absence of non- sexual disorders, significant relationship stress, other forms of stress and other medical conditions distinguishes MHSDD. As with FSIAD, it can also be subdivided into the subtypes: lifelong, acquired, generalised, situational and distress severity can be classified as either: mild, moderate or severe. Aspects that differentiate MHSDD from FSIAD include associative features such as erectile or ejaculatory problems and a particularly low sex desire manifested in a lack of sex initiation which is usually led by the male.  Risk factors  In men, mood symptoms of anxiety are seemingly strong indicators of low desire in men. Approximately half of the men who have experienced psychiatric symptoms in the past are more likely to experience a significant loss in sexual desire relative to those without this history (15%). The use of alcohol may be a resultant outcome of this disorder. Hyperprolactinemia (a disorder of the endocrine system) and hypogonadism has also been associated with affecting men's sexual desire.  Prevalence  This disorder is more prevalent in older men aged between 66‚Äì74 years old (41%) and fewer young men aged between 18-24 (6%). Overall, however, this condition only affects a small proportion of the male population (1.8%) for men aged between 16-44. Prevalence also varies cross culturally with higher rates experienced in men from Southeast Asia (28%) compared to Northern European men (12.5%).  Desire discrepancy and gender Gender differences= Gender differences exist in the frequency of experiencing sexual desire, with men showing a higher frequency than womenAmerican Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publications. in all stages of relationships. Furthermore, there are gender differences in the causes attributed to sexual desire. Men are more likely to consider their sexual desire to stem from erotic environmental factors whereas women are more likely to view interpersonal factors and intimacy as playing a greater role in their sexual desire. Men are known to desire the same frequency of sexual intercourse in their current relationship and this is persistent one year later. However women have low sexual desires as the relationship length continues.Kristen P. Mark & Sarah H. Murray (2012) Gender Differences in Desire Discrepancy as a Predictor of Sexual and Relationship Satisfaction in a College Sample of Heterosexual Romantic Relationships, Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, 38:2, 198-215. Between both men and women, it has been found that vaginal sex, kissing and sexually stimulating caressing have been positively associated with no discrepancy between desired and actual frequency of sexual intercourse (otherwise referred to as sexual satisfaction). =Reasons for gender differences= Women's sexual desire is seen to be much weaker than men's,Rosen, R. C., & Leiblum, S. R. (1989). Assessment and treatment of desire disorders. In R. Rosen & S. Leiblum (Eds.), Principles and practice of sex therapy (2nd ed., pp. 19‚Äì47). New York: Guilford.Leiblum, S. R., & Rosen, R. C. (1988). Changing perspectives on sexual desire. In S. Leiblum & R. Rosen (Eds.), Sexual desire disorders (pp. 1‚Äì20). New York: Guilford. with sexual urges portraying to be less strong than men's sexual urges. Reasons for women's low sexual desire may be due to the understanding that sexual intercourse leads to pregnancy. Engaging in sexual intercourse requires a woman to invest 9 months in pregnancy, whereas a male's investment is based solely on how much time he wishes to commit to the partner. Thus, there are differential costs to engage in sexual activity which can affect a woman's sexual desire. Another reason why women are more likely to have low sexual desire and less sexual activity compared to men may be because when enduring in copulation with a male, women's experience of achieving an orgasm is low.Laumann, E. O., Gagnon, J. H., Michael, R. T., & Michaels, S (1994). The social organization of sexuality: Sexual practices in the United States. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Therefore, a females gratification for sexual intercourse may be lower than a males, where a male is able to enjoy sex consistently compared to a female, signifying why males sexual desire is usually higher. Another reason for this difference may be due to differences in levels of testosterone between men and women. Males possess significantly higher levels of testosterone levels in comparison to females.Dabbs, J. M., Jr. (2000). Heroes, rogues, and lovers: Testosterone and behavior. New York: McGraw-Hill. Studies have shown the importance of testosterone levels and its effect on sexual desire. For example, female-to-male transsexuals were administered with testosterone and reportedly experienced higher levels of sexual arousal and desire. The opposite occurred for male-to-female transsexuals who received androgen deprivation (antiandrogens), who reportedly experienced a decrease in sexual desire. Even so, a study looked at women who had their ovaries removed. The females received high doses of testosterone as a treatment therapy. There were increased levels of sexual motivation, sexual fantasies, masturbation, as well as reports of increased sexual intercourse with the testosterone treatment. A consistent finding across culture, religions, relationship status and sexual orientations is that men tend to experience higher sexual desire discrepancy than women. Men value giving and receiving sex orally more than womenLaumann, E. O. (1994). The social organization of sexuality: Sexual practices in the United States. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. and men report higher rates of intercourse than women do. Therefore, due to the higher value placed on sexual acts and the greater desired frequency of sex in men may be another contributing reason as to why their sexual desire discrepancy is higher than women's overall. Looking at the evolutionary perspective, the evolutionary theory depicts that partners sexual desire are usually deemed to be high during the start of the relationship. This high sexual drive can instigate individuals to become closely connected to one another. This sexual desire is ultimately reduced throughout the course of the relationship in order to focus on producing children.Buss, D. M. (2005a). (Ed.), The handbook of evolutionary psychology. New York: Wiley Women ultimately may incur in decreases of sexual desire once they feel they have achieved a connection with their partner. However, with men this is not the case and will continually wish to participate in sexual activity. But, men can experience decreases in sexual desires but due to the expectations by women of male sexual principles, it may not be reasonable for a man to confess to this matter as they should invariably possess high sexual desires. An important point by McCarthy and McDonald highlighted that there are variations in men's sex drive signifying that solid conclusions should not be made. As well as this, both males and females have reported in engaging in sexual activities with the low sexual desire levels therefore highlighting that sexual desire and sexual behaviour are not always intertwined. Age Age is an important factor in understanding human sexuality.Kinsey, A., Pomeroy, W., & Martin, C. (1949). Sexual behavior in the human male. Philadelphia, PA: W. B. Saunders. From adolescence, to adults, to old age, an individual experiences changes in sexual desires and sexual frequencies. This is predominantly due to biological changes, such as testosterone levels Schiavi, R. (1999). Aging and male sexuality. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. and environmental factors, such as cultural influences.Levy, J. (1994). Sex and sexuality in later life stages. In A. S. Rossi (Ed.), Sexuality across the life course (pp. 287‚Äì309). Chicago: University of Chicago Press To date, there is little research on SDD amongst adolescents. =Old age= Sexual desire discrepancy (SDD) declines from adolescence into older age, where sexual desire and sexual frequency both decrease.Levine, S. (1998). Sexuality in mid-life. New York: Plenum Press. Data suggests that female sexual desire is not affected by age,Masters, W., Johnson, V., & Kolodny, R. (1994). Heterosexuality. New York: Harper Collins however, the majority of data shows that sexual desire is affected by age and decreases as age increases. For older women, sexual desire can be determined by one's relationship context, i.e. whether she has a partner or not, but a man's sexual desire is not determined by this. With men between the ages 40 and 70 years old, sexual desire, sexual thoughts and sexual dreams gradually decline with age.McKinlay, J. & Feldman, H. (1994). Age-related variations in sexual activity and interest in normal men: Results from the Massachusetts Male Aging Study. In A. S. Rossi (Ed.), Sexuality across the life course (pp. 261‚Äì285). Chicago: University of Chicago Press However, Diokono and researchers showed that almost 74% of married men above the age of 60 were sexually active, and 63% of men aged between 80 and 102 years were also sexually active. There are several reasons for the changes in sexual desire discrepancies, that is low sexual desire and low sexual frequencies. From a biological perspective, as an individual ages, sex hormones change. For men, levels of testosterone reduce with age and by the time a man is 80, testosterone levels are likely to be one sixth of a young man.Schover LR. Prime time: sexual health for men over fifty. New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston; 1984 However, testosterone level has not been regarded to correlate with sexual drive/desire, but bioavailable testosterone levels were correlated with sexual desire and erectile functions (total testosterone level is the sum of bioavailable testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)). In women ovaries create 95% of estradiol (a sex hormone), but during menopause estradiol is terminated by the ovaries. This means estrogen levels decline as a woman becomes older, which creates changes to a woman's hormone levels and can ultimately reduce vaginal lubrication.Maurice, W. (1999). Sexual medicine in primary care. New York: Mosby. This signifies that a reduction in the frequency of sexual intercourse among older women may be because sexual intercourse can become uncomfortable. Other factors for low SDD in older individuals may be illness. The effects on sexual ability and partaking in sexual intercourse can be influenced by illnesses such as arthritis, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, where these are co-morbid with age.Maurice, W. (1999). Sexual medicine in primary care. New York: Mosby Attitudes towards an individual's self and towards their sexual partner can too affect sexual behaviour and sexual desire.Yura, H., & Walsh, M. (1983). Human needs and the nursing process. Norwalk, CT: Appleton- Century-Croft. A negative view of sex in older men and women are common attitudes held. With regards to \\"attitudes\\" in culture, sex appeal factors in America tend to be placed on youthful appearances such as smooth clear skin, rather than aged skin. There is also a stereotype that older people are physically unattractive, unable to achieve sexual arousal and have a lack of sexual interest.Friend, R. A. Older lesbian and gay people: A theory of successful aging. In J. Lee. (Ed.), Gay and midlife maturity (pp.99-118). New York: Haworth Press. Another cultural attitude is that sexual acts amongst older women who are post-menopausal are deemed to be inappropriate due to the fact that sexual intercourse is for reproduction and women can no longer reproduce therefore they should not be sexually active.  Theoretical considerations  Given the subjective nature of human sexuality, it is important that the findings from the various studies within this field are taken tentatively. The most prevalent limitation to most of the research conducted on desire discrepancy comes from the low diversity samples. Most research in this domain, and Psychology generally, tends to be conducted on university students and the samples also remain unrepresentative. Further limitations can be found in the definitions used to define sexual desire which can be misconstrued for sexual arousal which then affects the psychometric testing taking place. Different definitions of the same concepts can lead to contradictory findings of a given study with studies of the past and can thereby lead to circular, as opposed to progressive, debates in the literature. Although research has been able to establish that throughout the duration of a relationship, there is a decrease in sexual desire but increase in intimacyChelune, G. J., Robison, J. T., & Kommer, M. J. (1984). A cognitive interactional model of intimate relationships. In V. J. Derlega (Ed.), Communication, intimacy and close relationships (pp. 11‚Äì46). Orlando, FL: Academic Press. there has been a lack of research investigating these specific two factors.

It is classified as a nitrile herbicide, and as such sold under many trade names. It is a white solid. It works by inhibiting photosynthesis. It is moderately toxic to mammals. Production and use It is produced by bromination of 4-hydroxybenzonitrile. It is a post-emergence to control annual broadleaved weeds.Franz M√ºller and Arnold P. Applebyki \\"Weed Control, 2.

Persistence increases in soils with elevated clay or organic matter content, suggesting the compound has somewhat limited bioavailability to microorganisms in these environments. Under aerobic conditions in soils or pure cultures, products of bromoxynil degradation often retain the original bromine groups. The herbicide, and one of its common degradation products (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid) have been shown to undergo metabolic reductive dehalogenation by the microorganism Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans. In the Great Plains region of Canada, where it is widely used on cereal grains, average levels detected in drinking water were 1 nanogram per liter. In one case as high as 384 nanograms per liter were detected. Levels of bromoxynil were consistently lower than of several other pesticides tested, and it was observed to undergo greater reduction in water treatment than the others. Safety Lethal doses in mammals range between 60 and 600 milligrams ingested per kilogram, and teratogenic effects have been observed in rats and rabbits above 30 milligrams per kilogram. Chronic exposure for more than one year in humans caused symptoms of weight loss, fever, vomiting, headache, and urinary problems in one documented case.

The script was written by Aranda, Gubern and their mutual friend Ricardo Bofill, an architect also associated with the Barcelona School. The screenplay was loosely inspired by F. Scott Fitzgerald's the Great Gatsby in a portrait of Barcelona's upper class seen from an outsider coming from the provinces. Although Gubern worked on the screenplay and prepared the scenes to be shot each day, the actual direction of the film was completely in Aranda's hands. German Cobos was chosen to be the leading man thanks to his brother association in the theater with Roman Gubern and Joaquin Jord√°, another member of the Barcelona's group of filmmakers and close friend of Gubern and Aranda. Serena Vergano, an Italian actress who had recently came to Spain to make the film El Conde Sandorf (1963), was chosen for the female lead. At the time she was involved in a romantic relationship with Ricardo Bofill. Production of the film was problematic. There was a dispute between Ricardo Bofill, the co-scriptwriter who was present during shooting, and the cinematographer Aurelio G. Larraya. This had a negative effect in the resulting film. Brillante Porvenir was shot in various locations in Barcelona, Castelldefels and Sitges between 14 October and 6 December 1963. Location were set apart geographically and the many scenes complicated the work of Aranda, who was directing his first film. Reception Brillante Porvenir is set within a neorealistic aesthetic, following in the footsteps of the Italian neorealism and the work of Michelangelo Antonioni, who was then popular in the art house circuits. However by the mid 1960s, when Brillante Porvenir was made, this approached seemed dated. Brillante Porvenir aspired to be a chronicle of Barcelona's upper middle class from the point of view of an outsider, a newcomer who arrives from a provincial background.C√°novas, Miradas sobre el cine de Vicente Aranda, p. 81 This social criticism, unusual in Spanish films during Francisco Franco's regime, faced cuts from censors who eliminated parts of the script and later forced the director to alter the end of the film. These mandatory changes distorted the meaning and intentions of the film and negatively affected its reception. Brillante Porvenir was coldly received by critics and public.C√°novas, Miradas sobre el cine de Vicente Aranda, p. 82 It was a commercial an artistic disappointment.

(e.g. Canyon Diablo at Meteor Crater; Australasian strewnfield) Fragments distribution In the case of mid-air fragmentation, smaller fragments tend to fall shorter and the biggest fragments are usually found at the far end of the oval. In order to get an idea of the original flight direction it is necessary to analyze the size pattern of the material over the strewnfield. Fragments of about 1 to 5 grams can be picked up on weather radar as they fall at terminal velocity.

The method works by collecting oriented samples at measured intervals throughout the section. The samples are analyzed to determine their characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM), that is, the polarity of Earth's magnetic field at the time a stratum was deposited. This is possible because volcanic flows acquire a thermoremanent magnetization and sediments acquire a depositional remanent magnetization, both of which reflect the direction of the Earth's field at the time of formation. This technique is typically used to date sequences that generally lack fossils or interbedded igneous rock. Technique When measurable magnetic properties of rocks vary stratigraphically they may be the basis for related but different kinds of stratigraphic units known collectively as magnetostratigraphic units (magnetozones). The magnetic property most useful in stratigraphic work is the change in the direction of the remanent magnetization of the rocks, caused by reversals in the polarity of the Earth's magnetic field. The direction of the remnant magnetic polarity recorded in the stratigraphic sequence can be used as the basis for the subdivision of the sequence into units characterized by their magnetic polarity. Such units are called \\"magnetostratigraphic polarity units\\" or chrons. If the ancient magnetic field was oriented similar to today's field (North Magnetic Pole near the Geographic North Pole) the strata retain a normal polarity. If the data indicate that the North Magnetic Pole was near the Geographic South Pole, the strata exhibit reversed polarity. =Chron= A polarity chron, or chron, is the time interval between polarity reversals of Earth's magnetic field.Marshak, Stephen, 2009, Essentials of Geology, W. W. Norton & Company, 3rd ed. It is the time interval represented by a magnetostratigraphic polarity unit. It represents a certain time period in geologic history where the Earth's magnetic field was in predominantly a \\"normal\\" or \\"reversed\\" position. Chrons are numbered in order starting from today and increasing in number into the past. As well as a number, each chron is divided into two parts, labelled \\"n\\" and \\"r\\", thereby showing the position of the field's polarity. A chron is the time equivalent to a chronozone or a polarity zone. It is called a \\"polarity subchron\\" when the interval is less than 200,000 years long. =Sampling procedures= Oriented paleomagnetic samples are collected in the field using a rock core drill, or as hand samples (chunks broken off the rock face). To average out sampling errors, a minimum of three samples is taken from each sample site. Spacing of the sample sites within a stratigraphic section depends on the rate of deposition and the age of the section. In sedimentary layers, the preferred lithologies are mudstones, claystones, and very fine-grained siltstones because the magnetic grains are finer and more likely to orient with the ambient field during deposition. =Analytical procedures= Samples are first analyzed in their natural state to obtain their natural remanent magnetization (NRM). The NRM is then stripped away in a stepwise manner using thermal or alternating field demagnetization techniques to reveal the stable magnetic component. Magnetic orientations of all samples from a site are then compared and their average magnetic polarity is determined with directional statistics, most commonly Fisher statistics or bootstrapping. The statistical significance of each average is evaluated. The latitudes of the Virtual Geomagnetic Poles from those sites determined to be statistically significant are plotted against the stratigraphic level at which they were collected. These data are then abstracted to the standard black and white magnetostratigraphic columns in which black indicates normal polarity and white is reversed polarity. =Correlation and ages= Geomagnetic polarity in late Cenozoic Because the polarity of a stratum can only be normal or reversed, variations in the rate at which the sediment accumulated can cause the thickness of a given polarity zone to vary from one area to another. This presents the problem of how to correlate zones of like polarities between different stratigraphic sections. To avoid confusion at least one isotopic age needs to be collected from each section. In sediments, this is often obtained from layers of volcanic ash. Failing that, one can tie a polarity to a biostratigraphic event that has been correlated elsewhere with isotopic ages. With the aid of the independent isotopic age or ages, the local magnetostratigraphic column is correlated with the Global Magnetic Polarity Time Scale (GMPTS). Because the age of each reversal shown on the GMPTS is relatively well known, the correlation establishes numerous time lines through the stratigraphic section. These ages provide relatively precise dates for features in the rocks such as fossils, changes in sedimentary rock composition, changes in depositional environment, etc. They also constrain the ages of cross-cutting features such as faults, dikes, and unconformities. Sediment accumulation rates Perhaps the most powerful application of these data is to determine the rate at which the sediment accumulated. This is accomplished by plotting the age of each reversal (in millions of years ago) vs. the stratigraphic level at which the reversal is found (in meters). This provides the rate in meters per million years which is usually rewritten in terms of millimeters per year (which is the same as kilometers per million years). These data are also used to model basin subsidence rates. Knowing the depth of a hydrocarbon source rock beneath the basin-filling strata allows calculation of the age at which the source rock passed through the generation window and hydrocarbon migration began. Because the ages of cross-cutting trapping structures can usually be determined from magnetostratigraphic data, a comparison of these ages will assist reservoir geologists in their determination of whether or not a play is likely in a given trap. Changes in sedimentation rate revealed by magnetostratigraphy are often related to either climatic factors or to tectonic developments in nearby or distant mountain ranges. Evidence to strengthen this interpretation can often be found by looking for subtle changes in the composition of the rocks in the section. Changes in sandstone composition are often used for this type of interpretation. Siwalik Magnetostratigraphy The Siwalik fluvial sequence (~6000 m thick, ~20 to 0.5 Ma) represents one of the best example of magnetostratigraphy application in the continental records.

It identifies the processing establishment that produced and packaged the product and that is therefore responsible for its hygiene status. These marks are meant as a monitoring and tracking aid for food safety and customs inspectors, and each food processing facility dealing with food products of animal origin is required to keep records of its trading partners and their approval numbers (in the case they process said food products), both for buying and selling. The identification and health marks are not an indication for the specific origin of a particular piece of food by themselves, as they do not encode the location of the farm that provided the initial raw product or livestock. However, consumers could use them to identify the actual manufacturer behind supermarket store brand products, where the labeling deliberately lacks any information about the real producer, which could be one that otherwise produces high-quality products using its regular brandings.  Regulations  The European Union has multiple regulations regarding food safety and quality control in the food industry. These are: * the EC/852/2004 regulation, regarding general food safety (commonly known as the Food Law), * the EC/853/2004 regulation, regarding processing and trading of food products of animal origin, and * the EC/854/2004 regulation, regarding the veterinary and laboratory examination of livestock and meat products. The EC/853/2004 regulation defines the identification mark (to identify the last plant or facility which processed the item), and the EC/854/2004 regulation defines the health mark (to identify the slaughterhouse for raw meat or the dairy facility for raw milk, the vet's name being optional). The former is in effect only when there is no need for the latter, though they use essentially the same marking style.  Meaning  The identification and health marks contains the following information in an oval: * the name of the country in which the product was processed, or more commonly its two-letter ISO country code (which could be AT, BE, BG, CY, CZ, DE, DK, EE, ES, EL, FR, FI, HU, HR, IE, IT, LT, LU, LV, MT, NL, PL, PT, RO, SE, SI, SK or UK); * the national approval number of the facility where the food was processed (the format of the approval number can be country- specific); * the letters EC for European Community (sometimes also the older EEC for European Economic Community), or their equivalents in other EU languages (for example, EK instead of EC, or EGK instead of EEC), but only if the source materials were produced in/imported from another EC member state. = Examples = An example of a simple identification mark: :HU :260 :EK Where HU is the country code for Hungary, 260 is the national approval number of a processing facility (in this case, a dairy facility of the company Alf√∂ldi Tej), and EK stands for Eur√≥pai K√∂z√∂ss√©g (European Community in Hungarian). Another example with a more complex national approval number: ::FR :49.099.001 ::CE Where FR is the country code for France, 49.099.001 is a complex national approval number, which encodes some geographic data about the facility (49: Maine-et-Loire region, 099: Cholet commune, 001: facility number), and CE stands for Communaut√© europ√©enne (European Community in French).

Lewis Vivian M. Lewis (June 8, 1869 - March 14, 1950) was an American jurist and politician. He was the Republican nominee for Governor of New Jersey in 1910 against Woodrow Wilson and lost the election. Early life and education Lewis was born in Paterson, New Jersey in 1869 to Isaac Arriston and Hanna (Davies) Lewis. He attended local schools in Paterson. As was the custom of the time, he studied law with private tutors (read the law) and was admitted to the bar in 1892. During this time he also wrote for New York newspapers.Scannell's New Jersey First Citizens, 1917-1918. J.J. Scannell, 1918. Political career Lewis joined the Republican Party and became politically active. In 1897 he was elected as a Republican to the New Jersey General Assembly. He was re-elected in 1899 and 1900, serving as majority leader in the Assembly during his last term.Myers, William Starr. The Story of New Jersey (1945). Reprinted as Prominent Families of New Jersey (Genealogical Publishing Company, 2000). In 1904 Lewis was elected City Counsel of Paterson. He resigned this position when Governor Franklin Murphy appointed him Clerk in Chancery (an office now known as Clerk of the Superior Court). Lewis filled the vacancy left by Edward C. Stokes, who resigned upon his inauguration as governor. He was renominated by Stokes for a full term in 1905. Lewis left the position of Clerk in Chancery in 1909 when he was appointed by Governor John Franklin Fort to be the State Commissioner of Banking and Insurance. In 1910, Lewis was nominated to be the Republican candidate for Governor of New Jersey, facing off against Democrat Woodrow Wilson, then President of Princeton University. Wilson ran a spirited campaign declaring his independence from machine politics, promising that party bosses would not control the state if he was elected. Lewis did not articulate an appealing campaign. Wilson soundly defeated Lewis in the general election by a margin of more than 49,000 votes. However, Republican William Howard Taft had carried New Jersey in the 1908 presidential election by more than 80,000 votes.Biography of Woodrow Wilson (PDF) , New Jersey State Library. Some historians think that Wilson benefited from former president Theodore Roosevelt's public campaign for progressive causes in this period. In 1912, Lewis resigned from his position as banking commissioner to accept the judicial position of vice chancellorship from Chancellor Edwin Robert Walker. He was reappointed to this office in 1919, 1926, 1933 and 1940. He retired in 1947, when the powers of the chancellor and vice chancellors were absorbed by the Superior Court, under the new State Constitution.\\"Vivian M.

They form the highest point of development of medieval Roman law. The school of the glossators in Bologna lost its vitality, resulting in the rise of a new school of legal thought in the 14th century, centred on Orl√©ans in France. Bartolus was the most famous of the commentators. Rather than simply seeking to explain the law, the commentators were more concerned with the potential for practical application of the law. Politically at this time, the idea of the Spirit of One ‚Äì one church and one empire, was popular in Europe. Roman law thus appealed as bringing the potential for one law in addition. Roman law was written and certain as well as being generally consistent and complete. The educated liked its roots and saw the potential for application. The commentators faced head on the conflict of law with custom as they saw the potential for practical application of the Roman law. They were opportunistic and as medieval Italy flourished, there were many opportunities to be the mediator between the developing political, scientific and economic spheres. Thus many of their ideas were based on practical morality, bold construction of the law and clever interpretations. For example, feudal law, which violated the absoluteness of dominium, was harmonised with Roman law by drawing links with the long lease, which gave rise to a vindicatio directa. The commentators argued that the vindicata directa was evidence of another type of ownership and that feudal ownership could fall within this category. This made Roman law more flexible, although was clearly a move away from the texts, and thus made it of greater practical use to rulers who were seeking a rational and coherent law. The Commentators went beyond the glossators, who had treated each text separately. The commentators instead wrote prose commentaries on the texts (rather like lectures,) working through, book by book, through the Digest. Rather than simply taking individual Roman law texts at face value, making it useful for practical application involved considering the rationale and principles behind the law. Certain areas were thus not considered at all, for example, Bartolus makes no attempt to consider culpa. However, this general approach produced a far more sophisticated law and enabled harmonisation between Roman law and local law. For example, Roman law said that a will was valid if you had 5 witnesses and that Roman law superseded customary law, whilst Venice law only required 3 witnesses. Bartolus‚Äô approach was to consider why Roman law superseded custom. He concluded that this was because custom was presumed bad. However, in certain circumstances, custom would be allowed by the Emperor, where the law was considered good. Since the Venice law had come into practice after the Emperor, the Emperor had not considered if it were good law. However, it clearly was and therefore it should be allowed to continue. The Commentators also harmonised canon law with Roman law to some extent. Canonists argued that bare agreement could give rise to an action (but they only had jurisdiction where that agreement was made by oath.) The Commentators said that the canon law was simply a form of clothing which could make a bare pact enforceable. The extraction of general principles allowed Roman law to be used in situations which were unfamiliar to the Romans, it provided a coherent and convenient set of rules, which could then be used to interpret local customs, which were given primacy but very narrowly interpreted. The impact of the commentators was thus substantial. Their commentaries were found throughout Europe, in fact it was said that if one was not a Bartolist (a commentator), one could not be a lawyer at all.

Olliver began riding at the age of six, not uncommon for the times, before becoming a stable lad to his uncle, one Mr Page, and later progressing into racing over obstacles, falling in his first ride at Finchley. Olliver was among the seventeen riders who participated in the first official running of the Grand National in 1839, finishing second on Seventy Four. He went on to ride in a record nineteen Nationals, a feat not equalled until 2014. His first victory came in 1842 when he piloted Gaylad. He became the first dual winning rider the following year when he rode Vanguard. The latter was later presented to Olliver as a gift, and he held the horse in such high esteem that when Vanguard died, Olliver had his hide used to make a sofa, which today is the property of Aintree racecourse. Olliver's final victory in the National came aboard the veteran Peter Simple in 1853. He told the owner before the race, \\"Sometimes he means it and I don't, sometimes I means it he don't but today we both mean it.\\"Gallant Sport-John Pinfold PP115 but Olliver also had several near misses. In addition to the aforementioned Seventy Four, beaten three lengths, he finished as runner up on St Leger, 1847, beaten a length and The Curate, 1848, beaten half a length, thus missing a record six victories, which would have stood to this day, by four and a half lengths. In Olliver's other National rides, he was third once and failed to complete the course ten times. Away from the course, Olliver was known for his swarthy dark looks, which led many to believe that his ancestry was either Spanish or Gypsy or even both. This led him to be known as 'Black' Tom. His interest in women, combined with his love of a party and with a sense of generosity, often saw him in grave financial difficulties. On one occasion, when he had been placed in the 'Pokey' (Debtors prison), he was visited by some cavalry officers. The story goes that when asked if there was anything they could provide for him, he replied, \\"Get me a damn good wall jumper.\\"A-Z of the Grand National-Cottrell & Armytage pp365 Olliver described himself as \\"Hopelessly insolvent.\\" even going to the length of adding the second l to his original surname Oliver, claiming that \\"It is better to have an extra ¬£ in hand.\\" (L is the symbol for the British pound.) Olliver's last National was in 1858, after which time he retired from the saddle and became the landlord of 'The Star' public house in Leamington. He soon grew to miss racing and set himself up as a trainer in Wroughton in Wiltshire. In the winter of 1873, he set about preparing his George Frederick for a crack at the 1874 Epsom Derby, but his health began to deteriorate and in January 1874 he died at the age of sixty-one. Olliver's head lad continued the preparations of the horse, who won the richest prize in English racing that summer.

The team consisted of Al Greene (real name Al Denney) and Don Greene. They were 7 time NWA Southern Tag Team Champions and wrestled as a tag team from October 6, 1955 to June 28, 1973. HistoryTennessee area (1955-1973)= The Heavenly Bodies was a tag team composed of Al and Don Greene. One of their matches was on October 6, 1969 in Memphis, Tennessee against Southern Tag Team Champions Dennis Hall and Johnny Walker with their titles on the line. The veteran tag team picked up the win, capturing the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship for the first time. They started feuding with Dennis Hall and Johnny Walker who were unable to regain the titles. Dennis and his new partner, the legendary Jackie Fargo, however, were able to beat the new champions for the titles only two weeks later. The first reign of Heavenly Bodies was short-lived as it lasted only two weeks. They won the titles for the second time on November 3, by beating Fargo and Hall for the titles. A week later, on November 10, they lost the titles to Bearcat Brown and Les Thatcher before regaining the titles a week later, on November 17. Their third reign was better and longer than their previous two reigns which lasted almost a month as they lost the titles to Dennis Hall and Johnny Long on December 15. On December 23, they defeated Hall and Walker in another longer reign where they lost the titles back to Dennis Hall and Johnny Walker on January 19, 1970 in a match in which Don was injured and sidelined. Al formed a tag team with Frank Martinez and held the Southern Tag Team Championships three times. Don returned from injury in late 1970 and reunited with Al as Heavenly Bodies. In December, they beat Jerry Jarrett and Tojo Yamamoto for the titles before losing them back to Jarrett and Yamamoto on January 9, 1971. They won the titles a sixth time in 1971 when they defeated longtime rivals Dennis Hall and Johnny Walker. On May 31, they lost the titles to another longtime rivals Jarrett and Yamamoto before taking the titles back from them a final time on June 21. A week later, on June 28, their final reign ended when they were beaten by Jerry Jarrett and Jackie Fargo for the titles. Al and Don stopped teaming together, disbanding Heavenly Bodies. =Georgia area= After the Greene Brothers disbanded, Don Greene teamed up with upcoming star Jerry Lawler as the Heavenly Bodies throughout the Georgia territory. The team was short lived as Lawler would begin to focus on his singles career.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. It is a large fortified village, that is the type site for the Initial Coalescent, a culture that flourished in the area c. 1200-1350 CE. Site description The Arzberger Site is located on a terrace overlooking the east bank of the Missouri River, about southeast of Pierre. The site is that of a fortified village, which originally had a wooden stockade encircling an area of about . The stockade was fortified with 24 bastions, and there were 44 house structures inside it. Although the site is considered the type site for the Initial Coalescent, it appears temporally late in the sequence of sites now associated with that cultural phase, and may be one of its final outposts. Its people appear to have disappeared from the region not long afterward, supplanted by the Middle Missouri culture. It is not far from the Crow Creek Site, the scene of a major massacre in the 1300s. The site was first excavated in 1939 by William Duncan Strong and Albert Spaulding, at which time portions of the fortification ditch, one bastion, and four houses were excavated. Of the houses excavated, two were typical circular earth lodge, while one was more rectangular in shape, a style more typically found in North Dakota. The houses included fire pits and cache pits, the latter found both inside and outside the structures. Pottery finds, according to Strong, were of a style that appears ancestral to both the Arikara to the north and the Pawnee to the south.
