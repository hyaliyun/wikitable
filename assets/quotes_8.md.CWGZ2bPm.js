Lotus is most commonly known for the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet application, the first feature-heavy, user- friendly, reliable and WYSIWYG-enabled product to become widely available in the early days of the IBM PC, when there was no graphical user interface. Much later, in conjunction with Ray Ozzie's Iris Associates, Lotus also released a groupware and email system, Lotus Notes. IBM purchased the company in 1995 for US$3.5 billion, primarily to acquire Lotus Notes and to establish a presence in the increasingly important client‚Äìserver computing segment, which was rapidly making host-based products such as IBM's OfficeVision obsolete. On December 6, 2018, IBM announced the sale of Lotus Software/Domino to HCL for $1.8 billion.  History  Lotus was founded in 1982 by partners Mitch Kapor and Jonathan Sachs with backing from Ben Rosen. Lotus's first product was presentation software for the Apple II known as Lotus Executive Briefing System. Kapor founded Lotus after leaving his post as head of development at VisiCorp, the distributors of the VisiCalc spreadsheet, and selling all his rights to Visi-Plot and Visi-Trend to Visi-Corp. Shortly after Kapor left Visi-Corp, he and Sachs produced an integrated spreadsheet and graphics program. Even though IBM and VisiCorp had a collaboration agreement whereby Visi-Calc was being shipped simultaneously with the PC, Lotus had a clearly superior product. Lotus released Lotus 1-2-3 on January 26, 1983. The name referred to the three ways the product could be used, as a spreadsheet, graphics package, and database manager. In practice the latter two functions were less often used, but 1-2-3 was the most powerful spreadsheet program available. Lotus was almost immediately successful, becoming the world's third largest microcomputer software company in 1983 with $53 million in sales in its first year, compared to its business plan forecast of $1 million in sales. In 1982 Jim Manzi ‚Äî a graduate of Colgate University and The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy ‚Äî came to Lotus as a management consultant with McKinsey & Company, and became an employee four months later. In October 1984 he was named president, and in April 1986 he was appointed CEO, succeeding Kapor. In July of that same year he also became Chairman of the Board. Manzi remained at the head of Lotus until 1995. =Dominance= As the popularity of the personal computer grew, Lotus quickly came to dominate the spreadsheet market. Lotus introduced other office products such as Ray Ozzie's Symphony in 1984 and the Jazz office suite for the Apple Macintosh computer in 1985. Jazz did very poorly in the market (in Guy Kawasaki's book The Macintosh Way, Lotus Jazz was described as being so bad, \\"even the people who pirated it returned it\\"). Also in 1985, Lotus bought Software Arts and discontinued its VisiCalc program. In the late 1980s Lotus developed Lotus Magellan, a file management and indexing utility. In this period Manuscript, a word processor, Lotus Agenda, an innovative personal information manager (PIM) which flopped, and Improv, a ground-breaking modeling package (and spreadsheet) for the NeXT platform, were released. Improv also flopped, and none of these products made a significant impact on the market. =\\"Look and feel\\" lawsuits= Lotus was involved in a number of lawsuits, of which the most significant were the \\"look and feel\\" cases which started in 1987. Lotus sued Paperback Software and Mosaic for copyright infringement, false and misleading advertising, and unfair competition over their low-cost clones of 1-2-3, VP Planner and Twin, and sued Borland over its Quattro spreadsheet. This led Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, to found the League for Programming Freedom (LPF) and hold protests outside Lotus Development offices. Paperback and Mosaic lost and went out of business; Borland won and survived. The LPF filed an amicus curiae brief in the Borland case. =Diversification and acquisition by IBM= In the 1990s, to compete with Microsoft's Windows applications, Lotus had to buy in products such as Ami Pro (word processor),\\"Ami Pro, also called just Ami initially, was a word processor sold by Samna and later Lotus Software, where it became Lotus Word Pro.\\" \\"There is much to recommend Ami Pro 2.0, the latest version of Lotus Corp.'s high- powered word processing program for Windows. Approach (database), and Threadz, which became Lotus Organizer. Several applications (1-2-3, Freelance Graphics, Ami Pro, Approach, and Lotus Organizer) were bundled together under the name Lotus SmartSuite. Although SmartSuite was bundled cheaply with many PCs and may initially have been more popular than Microsoft Office, Lotus quickly lost its dominance in the desktop applications market with the transition from 16- to 32-bit applications running on Windows 95. In large part due to its focusing much of its development resources on a suite of applications for IBM's new (and eventually commercially unsuccessful) OS/2 operating system, Lotus was late in delivering its suite of 32-bit products, and failed to capitalize on the transition to the new version of Windows. The last significant new release was the SmartSuite Millennium Edition released in 1999. All new development of the suite was ended in 2000, with ongoing maintenance being moved overseas. The last update release was 2014. Lotus began its diversification from the desktop software business with its 1984 strategic founding investment in Ray Ozzie's Iris Associates, the creator of its Lotus Notes groupware platform. As a result of this early speculative move, Lotus had gained significant experience in network-based communications years before other competitors in the PC world had even started thinking about networked computing or the Internet. Lotus initially brought Lotus Notes to market in 1989, and later reinforced its market presence with the acquisition of cc:Mail in 1991. In 1994, Lotus acquired Iris Associates. Lotus's dominant groupware position attracted IBM, which needed to make a strategic move away from host-based messaging products and to establish a stronger presence in client‚Äìserver computing, but it also soon attracted stiff competition from Microsoft Exchange Server. In the second quarter of 1995 IBM launched a hostile bid for Lotus with a $60-per-share tender offer, when Lotus' stock was only trading at $32. Jim Manzi looked for potential white knights, and forced IBM to increase its bid to $64.50 per share, for a $3.5 billion buyout of Lotus in July 1995. On October 11, 1995 Manzi announced his resignation from what had become the Lotus Development division of IBM; he left with stock worth $78 million. =Assimilation of name, web site, and branding= While IBM allowed Lotus to develop, market and sell its products under its own brand name, a restructuring in January 2001 brought it more in line with its parent company, IBM. Also, IBM moved key marketing and management functions from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to IBM's New York office. Gradually, the Lotus.com web site changed the \\"About us\\" section of its web site to eliminate references to \\"Lotus Development Corporation\\". The Lotus.com web page in 2001 clearly showed the company as \\"Lotus Development Corporation\\" with \\"a word from its CEO\\" by 2002 the \\"About us\\" section was removed from its site menu, and the Lotus logo was replaced with the IBM logo. By 2003 an \\"About Lotus\\" link returned to the Lotus.com page on its sidebar, but this time identifying the company as \\"Lotus software from IBM\\" and showing in its contact information \\"Lotus Software, IBM Software Group\\". By 2008 the Lotus.com domain name stopped showing a standalone site, instead redirecting to www.ibm.com/software/lotus, and in 2012 the site discontinued all reference to Lotus Software in favor of IBM Collaboration Solutions. IBM discontinued development of IBM Lotus Symphony in 2012 with the final release of version 3.0.1, moving future development effort to Apache OpenOffice, and donating the source code to the Apache Software Foundation. Later that year, IBM announced it was discontinuing the Lotus brand and on March 13, 2013, IBM announced the availability of IBM Notes and Domino 9.0 Social Edition, replacing prior versions of IBM Lotus Notes and IBM Lotus Domino and marking the end of Lotus as an active brand. On December 6, 2018, IBM announced the selling of Lotus Software/Domino to HCL for $1.8 billion. Corporate culture Mitch Kapor Lotus's first employee was Janet Axelrod who created the Human Resources organization and was the central figure in creating the Lotus culture. As she continued to build her organization and play a central role with senior management, she eventually hired Freada Klein as the first Director of Employee Relations. Lotus was the first major company to support an AIDS walk, in 1986. In 1990 Lotus opened a daycare center for the children of its employees. In 1992 Lotus was the first major company to offer full benefits to same-sex partners. In 1998 Lotus was named one of the top 10 companies for working mothers to work for by Working Mother magazine. In 1995 Lotus had over 4,000 employees worldwide; IBM's acquisition of Lotus was greeted with apprehension by many Lotus employees, who feared that the corporate culture of \\"Big Blue\\" would smother their creativity. To the surprise of many employees and journalists, IBM initially adopted a very hands-off, laissez-faire attitude towards its new acquisition. However, by 2000 the assimilation of Lotus was well underway. While the mass employee defections that IBM feared did not materialize, many long-time Lotus employees did complain about the transition to IBM's culture‚ÄîIBM's employee benefits programs, in particular, were singled out as inferior to Lotus's very progressive programs. Lotus's headquarters in Cambridge were originally divided into two buildings, the Lotus Development Building (LDB) on the banks of the Charles River, and the Rogers Street building, adjacent to the CambridgeSide Galleria. However, in 2001, then President and General Manager, Al Zollar decided not to renew the lease of LDB. The subsequent migration of employees across the street (and into home offices) generally coincided with what was probably the final exodus of employees from the company. Later, IBM's offices at 1 Rogers St supported mobile employees, the Watson Research Center on User interface, and IBM DataPower. The integration of Lotus into IBM continued and eventually the Lotus brand was discontinued, but many former Lotus employees still identified with Lotus and saw themselves as part of the Lotus community for a considerable period after the takeover. =Origins= Mitch Kapor got the name for his company from 'The Lotus Position' or 'Padmasana'. Kapor used to be a teacher of Transcendental Meditation technique as taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Incidentally, competitor Borland code-named their Quattro Pro software \\"Buddha\\", as the software was meant to \\"assume the Lotus position\\" and take over Lotus 1-2-3's market.

Set up by the Bertoleoni family, allegedly sanctioned by Charles Albert, King of Sardinia, it claimed to be one of the smallest kingdoms in the world. Giuseppe Bertoleoni claimed to be its monarch. When he died in the 1840s, his eldest son became King Paolo I. Tavolara, the royal grave. During his reign, in 1861 the Italian government paid 12,000 Italian lire for land at the northeast end of the island to build a lighthouse, which began operating in 1868.\\"Notice to Mariners,\\" London Gazette, Aug 28, 1868, p 4734 After Paolo's death in 1886,\\"E morto il Re!\\" La Sardegna, June 8, 1886, p 1 a number of newspapers published the report that according to his will, the island had become a republic.

The third king of Tavolara was Carlo I, who was succeeded upon his death in 1928 by his son King Paolo II. Paolo went abroad, however, and left Carlo's sister Mariangela as regent in his absence. Mariangela died in 1934, leaving the kingdom to Italy.\\"Italy Gets Queen's Island of Tavolara,\\" Hartford Courant, July 9, 1934, p 15 Her nephew Paolo II still claimed the kingdom until his death in 1962, a year that marked the installation of a NATO station on the island.

The second Boy Scouts of America National Headquarters was in North Brunswick, although it was referred to in BSA publications as being in neighboring New Brunswick. Early history (1910‚Äì1950) Camp Glen Gray, located in Bergen County, New Jersey (Northern New Jersey Council) has been continually active since 1917, and was originally located in a valley in the Ramapo Mountains in New Jersey. Camp Glen Gray is named after Frank Fellows Gray, (1869‚Äì1935) a well known early professional Scouter of that area. It was selected and developed by Gray to give a permanent summer camp for Scouts, and the camp is the first purpose-built Scout camp in New Jersey. Prior Scout summer camping experiments were typically temporary affairs at farm fields or church camps. Frank Gray was one of America's earliest Scoutmasters, having started Troop 4 in Montclair, New Jersey, known as the \\"Lord Baden-Powell Troop\\" in March 1909. He also created an honor program that was used in New Jersey and in the Brooklyn Council called \\"Senior Division\\". The camp ultimately reached a size of about and was operated by Eagle Rock Council, then Essex Council, and finally Northern New Jersey Council. In 2003, the camp was sold to the Bergen County Parks Commission and operated through a management agreement by the non-profit group Friends of Glen Gray, and is supported by a group of volunteers known as the \\"Old Guard\\". While no longer an \\"official\\" Boy Scout Camp, it does continue to host a large number of Scouting groups and activities throughout the year, as well as hosting a summer day camp for an area special-needs school. Notable Scout Walter Marty Schirra, Jr. (March 12, 1923 ‚Äì May 3, 2007) earned the rank of First Class in Troop 36 in Oradell, New Jersey. He was one of the original Mercury 7 astronauts. He was also the only person to fly in all of America's first three space programs (Mercury, Gemini and Apollo). Cub Scouting Origins ‚Äì To begin including younger boys to Scouting, James E. West approved the formation of the Boy Rangers of America, a separate organization for boys eight through twelve based on an American Indian theme. The Boy Rangers used the Scout Law and Chief Guide Emerson Brooks was a Boy Scout commissioner in Montclair, New Jersey. The BSA finally began some experimental Cubbing units in 1928 and in 1930 the BSA began registering the first Cubbing packs, and the Boy Rangers were absorbed. The Cub Scouting program used elements of Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book series, with the Cubmaster taking the role of Akela and the assistant Cubmaster the role of Baloo. The American program also syncretized American Indian elements, with all Cub Scouts belonging to the Webelos tribe, symbolized by the Arrow of Light and led by Akela. Webelos was also an acronym meaning Wolf, Bear, Lion, Scout. The initial rank structure was Wolf, Bear and Lion, with ages of 9, 10 and 11. Dens of six to eight Cubs were entirely led by a Boy Scout holding the position of den chief. Mortimer L. Schiff ‚Äì After a long tenure as vice-president of the BSA beginning in 1910, during which he also appeared on the cover of Time magazine on February 14, 1927, Mortimer L. Schiff was elected as president in 1931, but died after serving one month and Walter Head returned until 1946. Schiff's mother purchased and donated of land in New Jersey and donated it to the BSA, thus creating Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation as a national training center. Both Mortimer and his son, John M. Schiff, received the Silver Buffalo Award from the BSA. William \\"Green Bar Bill\\" Hillcourt ‚Äì William Hillcourt was one of the BSA's most prolific writers. He wrote numerous articles for Boys' Life and Scouting magazines, including a column aimed at patrol leaders under the by-line of \\"Patrol Leader Green Bar Bill\\". At least 12,610,000 copies of his three editions of the Boy Scout Handbook were printed. Hillcourt died in Europe while on a Scouting tour in 1992. He is buried with his wife Grace in St. Joseph's Cemetery in Mendham, New Jersey at Row 8, Block I, to be near Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation as he had lived for so many years. His legacy in Scouting and his influence continue in the programs and training of Scouting. Consequently, his writings are still used within the Scouting movement and his material continues to be reprinted in Scouting magazine.[21] The Hiawatha Seaway Council operates the William Hillcourt Scout Museum at Camp Woodland in New York to \\"keep the traditions of Scouting alive\\" through the preservation of the history that is a foundation for today's Scouting movement Order of the Arrow ‚Äì The first Order of the Arrow ceremony for the Vigil Honor was held in New Jersey by E. Urner Goodman using Scouts from the Treasure Island Scout Reservation. The 1925 and 1936 National Order of the Arrow Lodge Meetings were held at Treasure Island, New Jersey. Recent history (1950‚Äì1990) In 1954, the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America moved its National Headquarters from New York City to a new site at the southwest corner of U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 130 in North Brunswick, New Jersey, although the location appeared in BSA publications as \\"New Brunswick\\". The building has been torn down and the intersection reveloped. The Shoppes at North Brunswick retail shopping center now occupies the site of the former BSA building. The Johnston Historical Museum and a conservation education trail were also located there. The national headquarters moved to Irving, Texas in 1979.http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/210-551.pdf Boy Scouting in New Jersey today There are seven Boy Scouts of America (BSA) local councils active in New Jersey. =Washington Crossing Council= The Washington Crossing Council serves scouts in Bucks County, Pennsylvania and scouts in two districts located in Western New Jersey that were transferred from the former Central New Jersey Council: The Mercer Area District in Mercer County, New Jersey and the Hunterdon Arrowhead District in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. =Garden State Council= Southern New Jersey Council and Burlington County Council merged to form this new council as of January 1, 2013.

Scouts are encouraged to try their hand at activities such as candle making, flint and steel fire starting, blacksmithing, woodsman tools, tin-smithing, blacksmithing and more. Chillicothe is a program unique to RSR, and it is an often underutilized program. It was designed to encourage the return of older Scouts who had earned most of the merit badges offered by the camp. Prior to the 2019 Camp season it was decided that the Chillicothe program area was in need of some repair, so the area itself is currently closed and the badges that were offered have been moved to other program areas. This temporary closure is expected to be only until the New Nature Science Center Pavilion is opened, at which point any new additional donations and funding will go into the rebuilding of the Chillicothe Program area. In 2012, RSR introduced Venturing Week, a week of resident camp for youth in the Venturing Program. In addition to various open programming opportunities, offerings included a full-week half-day COPE course, American Red Cross Wilderness First Aid, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Hunter Education course, and more.

During the 2014 Year the camp decided to experiment with a STEM program dedicated to the last week of the season. Keeping with the style of the camp to try and only offer badges that scouts can't typically earn in a normal troop setting, the same has gone for STEM week. Past offerings have been the Robotics, Space Exploration, and Nuclear Sciences meritbadges. Each year the camp might have a different selection of \\"Supernova\\" Badges depending on available Volunteers or available skill sets of current staff members.

It belongs to Ripa, the twelfth rione, or ward, of Rome. The part of the city that stands on it is sometimes referred to as Reme, or Ream. Location and boundaries seven hills and Servian Wall. The Aventine Hill is the southernmost of Rome's seven hills. It has two distinct heights, one greater to the northwest and one lesser to the southeast, divided by a steep cleft that provides the base for an ancient roadway between the heights. During the Republican era, the two hills may have been recognized as a single entity.Lawrence Richardson, A new topographical dictionary of ancient Rome, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992, p.47 googlebooks preview. Richardson asserts the single identity of the two heights as Aventine during the Republican era as commonly accepted in modern scholarship. O. Skutsch, \\"Enniana IV: Condendae urbis auspicia\\", The Classical Quarterly, New Series, Vol. 11, No. 2 (Nov., 1961), pp. 252-267, argues that they were originally considered and named as separate hills: the Aventine was the northwestern height only, and the slightly lower southeastern height was Mons Murca. The Augustan reforms of Rome's urban neighbourhoods (vici) recognised the ancient road between the two heights (the modern Viale Aventino) as a common boundary between the new Regio XIII, which absorbed Aventinus Maior, and the part of Regio XII known as Aventinus Minor.Lawrence Richardson, A new topographical dictionary of ancient Rome, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992, p.47 googlebooks preview. Richardson asserts the single identity of the two heights as Aventine during the Republican era as commonly accepted in modern scholarship. O. Skutsch, \\"Enniana IV: Condendae urbis auspicia\\", The Classical Quarterly, New Series, Vol. 11, No. 2 (Nov., 1961), pp. 252-267, argues that they were originally considered and named as separate hills: the Aventine was the northwestern height only, and the slightly lower southeastern height was Mons Murca. Etymology and mythology Most Roman sources trace the name of the hill to a legendary king Aventinus. Servius identifies two kings of that name, one ancient Italic, and one Alban, both said to have been buried on the hill in remote antiquity. Servius believes that the hill was named after the ancient Italic king Aventinus. He rejects Varro's proposition that the Sabines named the hill after the nearby Aventus river; likewise, he believes that the Aventinus who was fathered by Hercules on Rhea Silvia was likely named after the Aventine Hill.Maurus Servius Honoratus, Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil, 7. 657. The Aventine was a significant site in Roman mythology. In Virgil's Aeneid, a cave on the Aventine's rocky slope next the river is home to the monstrous Cacus, killed by Hercules for stealing Geryon's cattle.Brill's New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World. \\"Cacus\\", 2002. Retrieved on May 4, 2007. In Rome's founding myth, the divinely fathered twins Romulus and Remus hold a contest of augury, whose outcome determines the right to found, name and lead a new city, and to determine its site. In most versions of the story, Remus sets up his augural tent on the Aventine; Romulus sets his up on the Palatine.For discussion of Remus in Roman founder-myth, see T.P. Wiseman, Remus: a Roman myth, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p.7 ff. For discussion of Ennius' much copied, corrupted and problematic text, particularly his Mons Murca as the lesser Aventine hill, see O. Skutsch, \\"Enniana IV: Condendae urbis auspicia\\", The Classical Quarterly, New Series, Vol. 11, No. 2 (Nov., 1961), pp. 255-259. Each sees a number of auspicious birds (aves) that signify divine approval but Remus sees fewer than Romulus. Romulus goes on to found the city of Rome at the site of his successful augury. An earlier variant, found in Ennius and some later sources, has Romulus perform his augury on one of the Aventine Hills. Remus performs his elsewhere, perhaps on the southeastern height, the lesser of the Aventine's two hills, which has been tentatively identified with Ennius' Mons Murcus.For discussion of Remus in Roman founder-myth, see T.P. Wiseman, Remus: a Roman myth, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p.7 ff. For discussion of Ennius' much copied, corrupted and problematic text, and particularly his Mons Murca as the lesser Aventine hill, see O. Skutsch, \\"Enniana IV: Condendae urbis auspicia\\", The Classical Quarterly, New Series, Vol. 11, No. 2 (Nov., 1961), pp. 255-259. Skutsch (1961) regards Ennius' variant as the most likely, with Romulus's Palatine augury as a later development, after common usage had extended the Aventine's name - formerly used for only the greater, northeastern height - to include its lesser neighbour. Augural rules and the mythos itself required that each twin take his auspices at a different place; therefore Romulus, who won the contest and founded the city, was repositioned to the more fortunate Palatine, the traditional site of Rome's foundation. The less fortunate Remus, who lost not only the contest but later, his life, remained on the Aventine: Servius notes the Aventine's reputation as a haunt of \\"inauspicious birds\\".Otto Skutsch, \\"Enniana IV: Condendae urbis auspicia\\", The Classical Quarterly, New Series, Vol. 11, No. 2 (Nov., 1961), pp. 252-267.Maurus Servius Honoratus, Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil, 7. 657. History =Roman= According to Roman tradition, the Aventine was not included within Rome's original foundation, and lay outside the city's ancient sacred boundary (pomerium). The Roman historian Livy reports that Ancus Marcius, Rome's fourth king, defeated the Latins of Politorium, and resettled them there.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.33. The Roman geographer Strabo credits Ancus with the building of a city wall to incorporate the Aventine.Strabo. \\"Geography\\", November 6, 2006. Retrieved on May 8, 2007. Others credit the same wall to Rome's sixth king, Servius Tullius. The remains known as the Servian Wall used stone quarried at Veii, which was not conquered by Rome until c.393 BC, so the Aventine might have been part-walled, or an extramural suburb. The Aventine appears to have functioned as some kind of staging post for the legitimate ingress of foreign peoples and foreign cults into the Roman ambit. During the late regal era, Servius Tullius built a temple to Diana on the Aventine, as a Roman focus for the new-founded Latin League. The Aventine's outlying position, its longstanding association with Latins and plebeians and its extra-pomerial position reflect its early marginal status. At some time around 493 BC, soon after the expulsion of Rome's last King and the establishment of the Roman Republic, the Roman senate provided a temple for the so-called Aventine Triad of Ceres, Liber and Libera, patron deities of the Roman commoners or plebs; the dedication followed one of the first in a long series of threatened or actual plebeian secessions. The temple overlooked the Circus Maximus and the Temple of Vesta, and faced the Palatine Hill. It became an important repository for plebeian and senatorial records.Cornell, T., The beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c.1000‚Äì264 BC), Routledge, 1995, p. 264. It is presumed that the Aventine was state-owned public land; in c.456 BC a Lex Icilia allowed or granted the plebs property rights there. By c.391 BC, the city's overspill had overtaken the Aventine and the Campus Martius, and left the city vulnerable to attack; around that year, the Gauls overran and temporarily held the city. After this, the walls were rebuilt or extended to properly incorporate the Aventine; this is more or less coincident with the increasing power and influence of the Aventine-based plebeian aediles and tribunes in Roman public affairs, and the rise of a plebeian nobility.Carter, Jesse Benedict. \\"The Evolution of the City of Rome from Its Origin to the Gallic Catastrophe\\"], Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, September 2, 1909, pp. 132 - 140. googlebooks preview (link updated 27 November 2010). Rome absorbed many more foreign deities via the Aventine: \\"No other location approaches [its] concentration of foreign cults\\". In 392 BC, Camillus established a temple there to Juno Regina. Later introductions include Summanus, c. 278, Vortumnus c. 264, and at some time before the end of the 3rd century, Minerva.Orlin, Eric M., Foreign Cults in Republican Rome: Rethinking the Pomerial Rule, Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, Vol. 47 (2002), pp. 4-5. For Camillus and Juno, see Stephen Benko, The virgin goddess: studies in the pagan and Christian roots of mariology, BRILL, 2004, p.27. The Aventine was also the site of the Baths of Decius, built in 252. =Modern= Basilica Santa Sabina During the Fascist period, many deputies of the opposition retired on this hill after the murder of Giacomo Matteotti, here ending - by the so-called \\"Aventine Secession\\" - their presence at the Parliament and, as a consequence, their political activity. The hill is now an elegant residential part of Rome with a wealth of architectural interest, including palaces, churches, and gardens, for example, the basilica of Santa Sabina and the Rome Rose Garden. Popular culture references The Aventine Hill is portrayed as a rough working-class area of ancient Rome in the popular Falco series of historical novels written by Lindsey Davis about Marcus Didius Falco, a 'private informer' who occasionally works for the Emperor Vespasian and lives in the Aventine. The same image is portrayed in much of the series Rome, in which the Aventine is the home of Lucius Vorenus. In season two, Vorenus and his friend legionary Titus Pullo seek to maintain order over the various collegia competing there for power. The Vesta-class of starships in the Star Trek novels are named for Rome's seven hills. The most featured ship is the U.S.S. Aventine under Captain Ezri Dax.

Vibe Magazine dubbed Megahertz one of music's \\"10 Most Valuable Producers\\", while About.com ranked him on its list of the \\"Top 50 Greatest Hip-Hop Producers\\". Described by Billboard Magazine as a \\"Powerful Producer\\", Megahertz has enjoyed commercial success producing music for television, film, video games, mixtapes & songs that have been certified gold, platinum and multiplatinum. Associated with artists such as P. Diddy, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, 50 Cent, R. Kelly, Busta Rhymes, Nas & Saturday Night Live's Robert Smigel ‚Äì it has been said that Megahertz \\"..brings the wattage.\\"  Early career  Megahertz is a native of Willingboro, New Jersey. He was raised in a \\"Christian household that didn't allow rap music.\\" Trying to keep his passion hidden, he would get \\"extra church time\\" if his mom heard him rapping. Despite his rigid religious upbringing, Megahertz immersed himself in what his mother called \\"evil music\\". But as Megahertz admitted to Billboard Magazine, \\"Not being able to listen to music only made me want to hear it more.\\" Tired of rapping over other people's beats, Megahertz began to purchase his own equipment and secretly keep it at his friend's house. Before long, producing music took precedence over rapping. One of his first breakthrough hits was \\"Bad Boy for Life\\". According to Vibe Magazine, \\"...Megahertz's bionic rubber-band beat for 'Bad Boy for Life' put Diddy back in the winner's circle.\\" Grammy nominated and certified four times platinum, it was the second single from P. Diddy's The Saga Continues, which peaked at number two on the US Billboard Mainstream Top 40. The \\"Bad Boy for Life\\" music video featured cameo's by actor Ben Stiller, rock drummer Travis Barker, NBA star Shaquille O'Neal and others.  Commercial success  Described by Billboard Magazine as a \\"powerful producer\\", Megahertz has enjoyed commercial success producing music for television, film, video games, mixtapes & songs that have been certified gold, platinum and multiplatinum. Associated with artists such as P. Diddy, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, 50 Cent, R. Kelly, Busta Rhymes, Nas & Saturday Night Live's Robert Smigel ‚Äì it has been said that Megahertz \\"..brings the wattage.\\" Megahertz made history when he produced \\"Gotta Make It to Heaven\\" for the fourth highest selling U.S. rap album of all-time, 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin'. With over 12 million copies sold, it is on one of the best selling albums of the decade.  Production style  Music writer Raqiyah Mays wrote, \\"There's power in Megahertz's name: a million cycles per second, to be exact. And when you buy his beats it's as if that power electrocutes whomever he's working with, shocking them into accelerating their skills.\\" Megahertz's genre-bending production style uses original composition, in combination with the occasional use of sampled sounds or songs, performed over programmed drums. One such track was the Nas single \\"Got Ur Self a Gun\\", which used \\"Woke Up This Morning\\" ‚Äì the theme song from HBO's The Sopranos. Referencing the music Megahertz created around that sample, MTV's Shaheed Reid wrote, \\"Megahertz molded pianos and strings that sound like they could've been played at the coronation ceremony for an 18th century king.\\" Another example of his knack for reinterpreting popular music occurred when Megahertz created a track for Tony Yayo's debut album using a sample made popular by Britney Spears. In the words of one fan, \\"'Love My Style' is probably one of the album's craziest tracks as Megahertz flips the same sample used on Britney Spear's 'Toxic.' What was once sugar-sweet pop takes on a menacing and minister tone and Yayo takes full advantage as he attacks the beat with confidence.\\" Megahertz's diverse production style, opened the door for collaborations with rock groups like P.O.D. & Linkin Park. Attracted to unusual musical pairings, Megahertz told Source Magazine, \\"I like System of a Down and I wouldn't mind doing something with them....I'd work with Limp Bizkit and I'm a Bj√∂rk fan. I'll do Calypso. I'll do some Indian music, whatever, just bring it on. I'll do it.\\" Resolute that his music continue to evolve, Megahertz said, \\"I'm not into repeat joints- I want to be re- discovered for new sounds each time.\\" Performer As a performer Megahertz grew up rapping, a talent that blossomed into creating jingles, commercial spots and ultimately led to songwriting & singing. In one such performance, Megahertz drops a cameo on the chorus of \\"Superstar\\", a song that features Ice Cube, WC & Mack 10.  Controversy  One of the most high-profile feuds in American hip hop history was the rivalry between Jay-Z & Nas. Vibe Magazine writer Dave Tompkins recounts, \\"When Jigga's (a.k.a. Jay-Z's) publicized beef with Nas reached nasty proportions, everyone waited on a response from God's Son (a.k.a. Nas). And he came out swinging with the Megahertz produced \\"Got Ur Self A Gun\\" ‚Äì a killer cut laced with a violent harpsichord.\\" The track was the second single on Nas' Stillmatic album, and just days after its release, Jay-Z retaliated by putting out \\"Supa Ugly\\", a combative freestyle, performed over \\"Got Ur Self A Gun\\" and Dr. Dre's song \\"Bad Intentions.\\" Later years At the height of his production career, he suddenly disappeared from the music industry. According to Megahertz, the reason was due to the death of his father around the time of his success.

History =Early history (1908‚Äì1950)= One of the earliest Scouting groups in Pennsylvania began in 1908 in Pottsville, when a Superintendent with the Pennsylvania State Police, Lynn G. Adams, formed a troop using Baden-Powell's handbook, Scouting for Boys. The troop was made up of two patrols, one sponsored by the Pottsville Mission and the other by the YMCA. Adams became the first Scoutmaster in Pennsylvania in 1910 soon after the BSA was incorporated. The oldest Pennsylvania Scout troop still in existence is \\"Troop Bala One\\" in Bala Cynwyd, which was founded in 1908 by Frank H. Sykes.Troop Bala One History The first council in Pennsylvania was the Delaware & Montgomery County Council in 1911. This council eventually became the former Valley Forge Council, now part of the Cradle of Liberty Council. Warren, Pennsylvania, Boy Scout basketball team, 1912 Sixteen councils were chartered in America between 1910 and 1913. The seventeenth was the Warren County Council headquartered in Warren, Pennsylvania. This council later changed its name to Chief Cornplanter Council and is still in operation. It is currently the oldest existing, continuously registered council in America. The other preceding 16 councils either went out of business or merged with another council at some point in their history. The information for this paragraph was provided by the Registration Department of the National Office of the BSA, Irving, Texas, in October 2007.legis.state.pa.usdoubleknot.comWarren Times-Mirror February 9, 1967 Also in 1913, the Philadelphia Council opened the first American scout camp, Treasure Island Scout Reservation, near Point Pleasant. Two years later, Dr. E. Urner Goodman and Carrol Edson founded the Order of the Arrow, which inducted its first members on July 16, 1915 at Treasure Island. In 1914, the Allegheny County Council, forerunner of today's Laurel Highlands Council, was chartered. Also in 1914, the Philadelphia Council was chartered. In 1915 charters were first granted to the councils headquartered in Erie, Wilkes- Barre, and Oil City. In 1916, councils were chartered in Reading, Lancaster, Harrisburg, and Scranton, among others. The council in Harrisburg is now part of New Birth of Freedom Council. In 1917 Meadville, State College and Bethlehem were granted charters by the National Office, along with nine other councils. 1919 saw the councils in Williamsport, Altoona and Chester County formed. Like Chief Cornplanter, the Chester County Council is still in operation, one of only a handful of small one-county councils left in America. The other one in Pennsylvania, Bucks County Council, received its first charter in 1927. By 1920, forty-six councils had been chartered in Pennsylvania. Most of these were small councils no larger than the town they were named after. Some of these were known as \\"Second Class Councils\\". In the following years, other currently chartered councils were started: Juniata Valley in 1929; Bucktail in 1930; Columbia-Montour and Schuylkill County Area in 1931; and York-Adams in 1932. 1937 saw the formation of the current Westmoreland-Fayette Council in Greensburg. All other current councils in Pennsylvania are the result of mergers which began to occur in the 1960s through the present day. 1941 saw the creation of Camp Ockanickon in Bucks County Council. Among the claimants for First Boy Scout Troop in the United States is Troop 1 in Bala Cynwyd. Pennsylvania is home to the oldest annual Scouting event in the nation, the Valley Forge Pilgrimage and Encampment. In 1928, Eagle Scout (and Erie native) Paul Siple was one of the first Scouts to travel to Antarctica with Admiral Richard Byrd. Byrd had held a national contest to invite worthy Eagle Scouts onto the expedition. Paul Siple later went on to develop what is now known as the \\"Wind Chill Factor\\" The 1921 and 1931 National Order of the Arrow Lodge Meetings were held at Philadelphia, the 1922 and 1927 National Lodge Meetings were held at Reading, and the 1940 National Lodge Meeting was held at Ligonier. =Recent history (1950‚Äì1990)= The 1950 National Scout Jamboree was held at Valley Forge. That positive experience led to National Jamborees in 1957 and 1964 as well. Outside of the few small councils mentioned above, the history of Pennsylvania councils over the past 50 years has been one of mergers. Beginning in 1962, the Mid-Valley Council, headquartered in Peckville, merged with the former Dan Beard Council in Scranton to form the Forest Lakes Council. Meanwhile, in 1970, the former Anthracite Council (Hazleton) merged with the former Wyoming Valley Council (Wilkes-Barre) to form the Penn Mountains Council. In 1984, the area comprising the former Anthracite Council removed itself from the Penn Mountains Council and joined neighboring Minsi Trails Council. Forest Lakes Council and Penn Mountains Council merged in 1990 to form the current Northeastern Pennsylvania Council, in Moosic. In 1967, the former Nemacolin Trails Council in Washington, Pennsylvania, merged with the Allegheny Council in Pittsburgh to become the Allegheny Trails Council. This council merged again in 1993 with East Valley Council to become the Greater Pittsburgh Council. In 1969, the Lehigh County Council (Allentown), Bethlehem Area Council and Delaware Valley Area Council (Easton) merged to form the current Minsi Trails Council in Allentown. In 1970, the former Appalachian Trail Council and Daniel Boone Council merged to form the current Hawk Mountain Council in Reading. 1970 also saw the merger of the Blair-Bedford Area Council (Altoona), William Penn Council (Indiana) and Admiral Robert E. Peary Council (Johnstown) into the Penns Woods Council in Ebensburg. In 1971, the Lancaster County and Lebanon County councils merged to form the Lancaster-Lebanon Council. This council changed its name in 1995 to the Pennsylvania Dutch Council and is headquartered in Lancaster. In 1972, the Washington Trail Council (Erie), Colonel Drake Council (Oil City) and Custaloga Council (Sharon) merged to form the current French Creek Council, headquartered in Erie. 1973 saw the merger of the former Lawrence County Council (New Castle) with the former Pioneer Trails Council (Butler), forming the current Moraine Trails Council, host to two National Jamborees (see below). Also in 1973, the former Elk Lick Council, in Bradford, merged into the Allegheny Highlands Council headquartered in Falconer, New York. In 1974, the former West Branch Council (Williamsport) and Susquehanna Valley Area Council (Sunbury) merged to form the current Susquehanna Council in Williamsport. Other notable happenings in Pennsylvania Scouting at this time include: The 1950, 1957, and 1964 National Scout Jamborees were held at Valley Forge. Half of the 1973 National Scout Jamboree (\\"Jamboree East\\") was held at Moraine State Park in Butler County, where the 1977 National Scout Jamboree and Campaganza 2010 were also held. During 1975 and 1976, Scouts in the Philadelphia area could earn a \\"Colonial Philadelphia\\" merit badge. It could only be counted towards palms, not any rank, and came in a green border and a very yellow-green border. This was the only time BSA National approved a regional merit badge for any such use.

Early life Francis Davis Millet was born in Mattapoisett, Massachusetts. Most sources give his date of birth as November 3, 1846, but a diary which he kept during his military service stated that November 3, 1864 was his 16th birthday, indicating birth in 1848. At age fifteen, Millet entered the Massachusetts regiment, first as a drummer boy and then a surgical assistant (helping his father, a surgeon) in the American Civil War. He repeatedly pointed to his experience working for his father as giving him an appreciation for the vivid blood red that he frequently used in his early paintings. He graduated from Harvard with a Master of Arts degree. He worked as a reporter and editor for the Boston Courier and then as a correspondent for the Advertiser at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. Career In 1876, Millet returned to Boston to paint murals at Trinity Church in Boston with John LaFarge. He entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts at Antwerp, Belgium. He was the first student to win a silver medal in his first year; the following year he won a gold medal. In the Russo‚ÄêTurkish war of 1877‚Äì78, he was engaged as a war correspondent by the New York Herald, the London Daily News, and the London Graphic. He was decorated by Russia and Romania for his bravery under fire and his services to the wounded. Millet became a member of the Society of American Artists in 1880, and in 1885 was elected as a member of the National Academy of Design, New York and as Vice- Chairman of the Fine Arts Committee. He was made a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and sat on the advisory committee of the National Gallery of Art. He was decorations director for the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, with claims he invented the first form of compressed air spraypainting to apply whitewash to the buildings, but the story may be apocryphal as contemporary journals note spraypainting had already been in use since the early 1880s. His career included work on a number of worlds' fairs, including Vienna, Chicago, Paris, and Tokyo, where he made contributions as a juror, administrator, mural painter/decorator, and adviser.Gaines, Catherine S.

She enjoys great popularity in Puerto Rico (where she had a weekly variety show for more than a decade) and in other Latin American countries, as well as such U.S. locales as New York, Miami, and Los Angeles. Career Chac√≥n has been known by various nicknames, such as \\"La Bomba de Puerto Rico\\" (The Puerto Rican Bombshell), and \\"La Vedette de Am√©rica\\" (America's Showgirl). During her heyday in the 1970s and early 1980s, she toured most of Latin America, the United States, Europe and Japan. She also starred in two movies and many telenovelas, such as Yo S√© Que Ment√≠a. =Amalie Oil commercial= In 1982, AMCAR, Inc. hired her for a television commercial about Amalie Oil Company automobile coolant products, which became one of the most famous television commercials in Puerto Rico's history. The publicity surrounding the commercial landed her in a front-page article in The Wall Street Journal in June 1983 entitled \\"A Onetime Choirgirl Rules as Sex Goddess On Puerto Rican TV\\". The ad employed a play on words between the English word coolant and Spanish cul√≥n which means large derri√®re. =Mid-1980s to present= From 1984 through the early 1990s, Iris Chac√≥n appeared on such American TV shows as America Onstage, The Joan Rivers Show, The Merv Griffin Show, Geraldo Rivera Show, and David Letterman. Letterman described her as the Dolly Parton and Loni Anderson of Puerto Rico and joked about proposing to her. Griffin said of her that \\"she was the answer to 'Where's the beef?'\\", a reference to the Wendy's commercial of that time period. However, by 1984, Chac√≥n reached her peak, and not being able to reach an \\"Anglo\\" market, ended her show in Puerto Rico by mid-1985 at the age of 35. Her show aired in syndication until the end of the 1980s. Outside of the U.S., Chac√≥n appeared on various Spanish-language programs, including Anabel, Siempre en Domingo, Mala Noche No, and Al Ritmo de la Noche which were all Televisa productions. Personal life Chac√≥n was married to Latin musician Junno Faria, from 1977 to 2017. They have a daughter together, Katiria. Iris divides her time between residences in Orlando and Puerto Rico.

Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the mid- to late-1950s.Pop Art: A Brief History, MoMA LearningLivingstone, M., Pop Art: A Continuing History, New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1990 The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books and mundane mass-produced cultural objects. One of its aims is to use images of popular (as opposed to elitist) culture in art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any culture, most often through the use of irony. It is also associated with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques. In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, or combined with unrelated material.de la Croix, H.; Tansey, R., Gardner's Art Through the Ages, New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., 1980. Among the early artists that shaped the pop art movement were Eduardo Paolozzi and Richard Hamilton in Britain, and Larry Rivers, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns among others in the United States. Pop art is widely interpreted as a reaction to the then- dominant ideas of abstract expressionism, as well as an expansion of those ideas. Due to its utilization of found objects and images, it is similar to Dada. Pop art and minimalism are considered to be art movements that precede postmodern art, or are some of the earliest examples of postmodern art themselves. Pop art often takes imagery that is currently in use in advertising. Product labeling and logos figure prominently in the imagery chosen by pop artists, seen in the labels of Campbell's Soup Cans, by Andy Warhol. Even the labeling on the outside of a shipping box containing food items for retail has been used as subject matter in pop art, as demonstrated by Warhol's Campbell's Tomato Juice Box, 1964 (pictured). Origins The origins of pop art in North America developed differently from Great Britain. In the United States, pop art was a response by artists; it marked a return to hard-edged composition and representational art. They used impersonal, mundane reality, irony, and parody to \\"defuse\\" the personal symbolism and \\"painterly looseness\\" of abstract expressionism.Gopnik, A.; Varnedoe, K., High & Low: Modern Art & Popular Culture, New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1990 In the U.S., some artwork by Larry Rivers, Alex Katz and Man Ray anticipated pop art. By contrast, the origins of pop art in post-War Britain, while employing irony and parody, were more academic. Britain focused on the dynamic and paradoxical imagery of American pop culture as powerful, manipulative symbolic devices that were affecting whole patterns of life, while simultaneously improving the prosperity of a society. Early pop art in Britain was a matter of ideas fueled by American popular culture when viewed from afar. Similarly, pop art was both an extension and a repudiation of Dadaism. While pop art and Dadaism explored some of the same subjects, pop art replaced the destructive, satirical, and anarchic impulses of the Dada movement with a detached affirmation of the artifacts of mass culture. Among those artists in Europe seen as producing work leading up to pop art are: Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, and Kurt Schwitters. =Proto-pop= Charles Demuth, I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold 1928, collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City Although both British and American pop art began during the 1950s, Marcel Duchamp and others in Europe like Francis Picabia and Man Ray predate the movement; in addition there were some earlier American proto-pop origins which utilized \\"as found\\" cultural objects.Piper, David. The Illustrated History of Art, , p486-487. During the 1920s, American artists Patrick Henry Bruce, Gerald Murphy, Charles Demuth and Stuart Davis created paintings that contained pop culture imagery (mundane objects culled from American commercial products and advertising design), almost \\"prefiguring\\" the pop art movement.Wayne Craven, American Art: History and . p.464. United Kingdom: the Independent Group alt=A collage of many different styles shows a mostly naked man and woman in a house. The Independent Group (IG), founded in London in 1952, is regarded as the precursor to the pop art movement.Arnason, H., History of Modern Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc. 1968. They were a gathering of young painters, sculptors, architects, writers and critics who were challenging prevailing modernist approaches to culture as well as traditional views of fine art. Their group discussions centered on pop culture implications from elements such as mass advertising, movies, product design, comic strips, science fiction and technology. At the first Independent Group meeting in 1952, co-founding member, artist and sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi presented a lecture using a series of collages titled Bunk! that he had assembled during his time in Paris between 1947 and 1949. This material of \\"found objects\\" such as advertising, comic book characters, magazine covers and various mass-produced graphics mostly represented American popular culture. One of the collages in that presentation was Paolozzi's I was a Rich Man's Plaything (1947), which includes the first use of the word \\"pop\\", appearing in a cloud of smoke emerging from a revolver. Following Paolozzi's seminal presentation in 1952, the IG focused primarily on the imagery of American popular culture, particularly mass advertising. According to the son of John McHale, the term \\"pop art\\" was first coined by his father in 1954 in conversation with Frank Cordell, although other sources credit its origin to British critic Lawrence Alloway.\\"Pop art\\", A Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Art, Ian Chilvers. Oxford University Press, 1998.\\"Pop art\\", The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms, Michael Clarke, Oxford University Press, 2001. (Both versions agree that the term was used in Independent Group discussions by mid-1955.) \\"Pop art\\" as a moniker was then used in discussions by IG members in the Second Session of the IG in 1955, and the specific term \\"pop art\\" first appeared in published print in the article \\"But Today We Collect Ads\\" by IG members Alison and Peter Smithson in Ark magazine in 1956.Alison and Peter Smithson, \\"But Today We Collect Ads\\", reprinted on page 54 in Modern Dreams The Rise and Fall of Pop, published by ICA and MIT, However, the term is often credited to British art critic/curator Lawrence Alloway for his 1958 essay titled The Arts and the Mass Media, even though the precise language he uses is \\"popular mass culture\\".Lawrence Alloway, \\"The Arts and the Mass Media,\\" Architectural Design & Construction, February 1958. \\"Furthermore, what I meant by it then is not what it means now. I used the term, and also 'Pop Culture' to refer to the products of the mass media, not to works of art that draw upon popular culture. In any case, sometime between the winter of 1954-55 and 1957 the phrase acquired currency in conversation...\\"Klaus Honnef, Pop Art, Taschen, 2004, p. 6, Nevertheless, Alloway was one of the leading critics to defend the inclusion of the imagery of mass culture in the fine arts. Alloway clarified these terms in 1966, at which time Pop Art had already transited from art schools and small galleries to a major force in the artworld. But its success had not been in England. Practically simultaneously, and independently, New York City had become the hotbed for Pop Art. In London, the annual Royal Society of British Artists (RBA) exhibition of young talent in 1960 first showed American pop influences. In January 1961, the most famous RBA-Young Contemporaries of all put David Hockney, the American R B Kitaj, New Zealander Billy Apple, Allen Jones, Derek Boshier, Joe Tilson, Patrick Caulfield, Peter Phillips and Peter Blake on the map; Apple designed the posters and invitations for both the 1961 and 1962 Young Contemporaries exhibitions. Hockney, Kitaj and Blake went on to win prizes at the John- Moores-Exhibition in Liverpool in the same year. Apple and Hockney traveled together to New York during the Royal College's 1961 summer break, which is when Apple first made contact with Andy Warhol ‚Äì both later moved to the United States and Apple became involved with the New York pop art scene. United States Although pop art began in the early 1950s, in America it was given its greatest impetus during the 1960s. The term \\"pop art\\" was officially introduced in December 1962; the occasion was a \\"Symposium on Pop Art\\" organized by the Museum of Modern Art.Scherman, Tony. \\"When Pop Turned the Art World Upside Down.\\" American Heritage 52.1 (February 2001), 68. By this time, American advertising had adopted many elements of modern art and functioned at a very sophisticated level. Consequently, American artists had to search deeper for dramatic styles that would distance art from the well-designed and clever commercial materials. As the British viewed American popular culture imagery from a somewhat removed perspective, their views were often instilled with romantic, sentimental and humorous overtones. By contrast, American artists, bombarded every day with the diversity of mass-produced imagery, produced work that was generally more bold and aggressive. alt=A woman's crying face is overwhelmed by waves as she thinks, \\"I don't care! I'd rather sink than call Brad for help!\\" Two important painters in the establishment of America's pop art vocabulary were Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. Rauschenberg was influenced by the earlier work of Kurt Schwitters and other Dada artists, and his belief that \\"painting relates to both art and life\\" challenged the dominant modernist perspective of his time.Rauschenberg, Robert; Miller, Dorothy C. (1959). Sixteen Americans [exhibition]. New York: Museum of Modern Art. p. 58. . OCLC 748990996. ‚ÄúPainting relates to both art and life. Neither can be made. (I try to act in that gap between the two.)‚Äù His use of discarded readymade objects (in his Combines) and pop culture imagery (in his silkscreen paintings) connected his works to topical events in everyday America.Sandler, Irving H. The New York School: The Painters and Sculptors of the Fifties, New York: Harper & Row, 1978. pp. 174‚Äì195, Rauschenberg and Johns; pp. 103‚Äì111, Rivers and the gestural realists. The silkscreen paintings of 1962‚Äì64 combined expressive brushwork with silkscreened magazine clippings from Life, Newsweek, and National Geographic. Johns' and Rauschenberg's work of the 1950s is frequently referred to as Neo- Dada, and is visually distinct from the prototypical American pop art which exploded in the early 1960s.Robert Rosenblum, \\"Jasper Johns\\" Art International (September 1960): 75.Hapgood, Susan, Neo-Dada: Redefining Art, 1958-62. New York: Universe Books, 1994. The Cheddar Cheese canvas from Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans, 1962. Roy Lichtenstein is of equal importance to American pop art. His work, and its use of parody, probably defines the basic premise of pop art better than any other. Selecting the old-fashioned comic strip as subject matter, Lichtenstein produces a hard-edged, precise composition that documents while also parodying in a soft manner. Lichtenstein used oil and Magna paint in his best known works, such as Drowning Girl (1963), which was appropriated from the lead story in DC Comics' Secret Hearts #83. (Drowning Girl is part of the collection of the Museum of Modern Art.) His work features thick outlines, bold colors and Ben-Day dots to represent certain colors, as if created by photographic reproduction. Lichtenstein said, \\"[abstract expressionists] put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's.\\" Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery/content into the mix. The paintings of Lichtenstein, like those of Andy Warhol, Tom Wesselmann and others, share a direct attachment to the commonplace image of American popular culture, but also treat the subject in an impersonal manner clearly illustrating the idealization of mass production. Andy Warhol is probably the most famous figure in pop art. In fact, art critic Arthur Danto once called Warhol \\"the nearest thing to a philosophical genius the history of art has produced\\". Warhol attempted to take pop beyond an artistic style to a life style, and his work often displays a lack of human affectation that dispenses with the irony and parody of many of his peers.Michelson, Annette, Buchloh, B. H. D. (eds) Andy Warhol (October Files), MIT Press, 2001.Warhol, Andy. The Philosophy of Andy Warhol, from A to B and back again. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1975 =Early U.S. exhibitions= Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine and Tom Wesselmann had their first shows in the Judson Gallery in 1959 and 1960 and later in 1960 through 1964 along with James Rosenquist, George Segal and others at the Green Gallery on 57th Street in Manhattan. In 1960, Martha Jackson showed installations and assemblages, New Media - New Forms featured Hans Arp, Kurt Schwitters, Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Jim Dine and May Wilson. 1961 was the year of Martha Jackson's spring show, Environments, Situations, Spaces. Andy Warhol held his first solo exhibition in Los Angeles in July 1962 at Irving Blum's Ferus Gallery, where he showed 32 paintings of Campell's soup cans, one for every flavor. Warhol sold the set of paintings to Blum for $1,000; in 1996, when the Museum of Modern Art acquired it, the set was valued at $15 million. Donald Factor, the son of Max Factor Jr., and an art collector and co-editor of avant-garde literary magazine Nomad, wrote an essay in the magazine's last issue, Nomad/New York. The essay was one of the first on what would become known as pop art, though Factor did not use the term. The essay, \\"Four Artists\\", focused on Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, Jim Dine, and Claes Oldenburg.Diggory (2013). In the 1960s, Oldenburg, who became associated with the pop art movement, created many happenings, which were performance art-related productions of that time. The name he gave to his own productions was \\"Ray Gun Theater\\". The cast of colleagues in his performances included: artists Lucas Samaras, Tom Wesselmann, Carolee Schneemann, √ñyvind Fahlstr√∂m and Richard Artschwager; dealer Annina Nosei; art critic Barbara Rose; and screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer.Kristine McKenna (July 2, 1995), When Bigger Is Better: Claes Oldenburg has spent the past 35 years blowing up and redefining everyday objects, all in the name of getting art off its pedestal Los Angeles Times. His first wife, Patty Mucha, who sewed many of his early soft sculptures, was a constant performer in his happenings. This brash, often humorous, approach to art was at great odds with the prevailing sensibility that, by its nature, art dealt with \\"profound\\" expressions or ideas. In December 1961, he rented a store on Manhattan's Lower East Side to house The Store, a month-long installation he had first presented at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York, stocked with sculptures roughly in the form of consumer goods. Opening in 1962, Willem de Kooning's New York art dealer, the Sidney Janis Gallery, organized the groundbreaking International Exhibition of the New Realists, a survey of new-to-the-scene American, French, Swiss, Italian New Realism, and British pop art. The fifty-four artists shown included Richard Lindner, Wayne Thiebaud, Roy Lichtenstein (and his painting Blam), Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, Jim Dine, Robert Indiana, Tom Wesselmann, George Segal, Peter Phillips, Peter Blake (The Love Wall from 1961), Yves Klein, Arman, Daniel Spoerri, Christo and Mimmo Rotella. The show was seen by Europeans Martial Raysse, Niki de Saint Phalle and Jean Tinguely in New York, who were stunned by the size and look of the American artwork. Also shown were Marisol, Mario Schifano, Enrico Baj and √ñyvind Fahlstr√∂m. Janis lost some of his abstract expressionist artists when Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell, Adolph Gottlieb and Philip Guston quit the gallery, but gained Dine, Oldenburg, Segal and Wesselmann. At an opening-night soiree thrown by collector Burton Tremaine, Willem de Kooning appeared and was turned away by Tremaine, who ironically owned a number of de Kooning's works. Rosenquist recalled: \\"at that moment I thought, something in the art world has definitely changed\\". Turning away a respected abstract artist proved that, as early as 1962, the pop art movement had begun to dominate art culture in New York. A bit earlier, on the West Coast, Roy Lichtenstein, Jim Dine and Andy Warhol from New York City; Phillip Hefferton and Robert Dowd from Detroit; Edward Ruscha and Joe Goode from Oklahoma City; and Wayne Thiebaud from California were included in the New Painting of Common Objects show. This first pop art museum exhibition in America was curated by Walter Hopps at the Pasadena Art Museum. Pop art was ready to change the art world. New York followed Pasadena in 1963, when the Guggenheim Museum exhibited Six Painters and the Object, curated by Lawrence Alloway. The artists were Jim Dine, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol. Another pivotal early exhibition was The American Supermarket organised by the Bianchini Gallery in 1964. The show was presented as a typical small supermarket environment, except that everything in it‚Äîthe produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.‚Äîwas created by prominent pop artists of the time, including Apple, Warhol, Lichtenstein, Wesselmann, Oldenburg, and Johns. This project was recreated in 2002 as part of the Tate Gallery's Shopping: A Century of Art and Consumer Culture. By 1962, pop artists started exhibiting in commercial galleries in New York and Los Angeles; for some, it was their first commercial one-man show. The Ferus Gallery presented Andy Warhol in Los Angeles (and Ed Ruscha in 1963). In New York, the Green Gallery showed Rosenquist, Segal, Oldenburg, and Wesselmann. The Stable Gallery showed R. Indiana and Warhol (in his first New York show). The Leo Castelli Gallery presented Rauschenberg, Johns, and Lichtenstein. Martha Jackson showed Jim Dine and Allen Stone showed Wayne Thiebaud. By 1966, after the Green Gallery and the Ferus Gallery closed, the Leo Castelli Gallery represented Rosenquist, Warhol, Rauschenberg, Johns, Lichtenstein and Ruscha. The Sidney Janis Gallery represented Oldenburg, Segal, Dine, Wesselmann and Marisol, while Allen Stone continued to represent Thiebaud, and Martha Jackson continued representing Robert Indiana.Pop Artists: Andy Warhol, Pop Art, Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns, Peter Max, Err√≥, David Hockney, Wally Hedrick, Michael Leavitt (May 20, 2010) Reprinted: 2010, General Books, Memphis, Tennessee, USA, , . In 1968, the S√£o Paulo 9 Exhibition ‚Äì Environment U.S.A.: 1957‚Äì1967 featured the \\"Who's Who\\" of pop art. Considered as a summation of the classical phase of the American pop art period, the exhibit was curated by William Seitz. The artists were Edward Hopper, James Gill, Robert Indiana, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol and Tom Wesselmann.Jim Edwards, William Emboden, David McCarthy: Uncommonplaces: The Art of James Francis Gill, 2005, p.54 France Nouveau r√©alisme refers to an artistic movement founded in 1960 by the art critic Pierre RestanyKarl Ruhrberg, Ingo F. Walther, Art of the 20th Century, Taschen, 2000, p. 518. and the artist Yves Klein during the first collective exposition in the Apollinaire gallery in Milan. Pierre Restany wrote the original manifesto for the group, titled the \\"Constitutive Declaration of New Realism,\\" in April 1960, proclaiming, \\"Nouveau R√©alisme‚Äînew ways of perceiving the real.\\"Kerstin Stremmel, Realism, Taschen, 2004, p. 13. This joint declaration was signed on 27 October 1960, in Yves Klein's workshop, by nine people: Yves Klein, Arman, Martial Raysse, Pierre Restany, Daniel Spoerri, Jean Tinguely and the Ultra-Lettrists, Francois Dufr√™ne, Raymond Hains, Jacques de la Villegl√©; in 1961 these were joined by C√©sar, Mimmo Rotella, then Niki de Saint Phalle and G√©rard Deschamps. The artist Christo showed with the group. It was dissolved in 1970. Contemporary of American Pop Art‚Äîoften conceived as its transposition in France‚Äînew realism was along with Fluxus and other groups one of the numerous tendencies of the avant-garde in the 1960s. The group initially chose Nice, on the French Riviera, as its home base since Klein and Arman both originated there; new realism is thus often retrospectively considered by historians to be an early representative of the movement.Rosemary M. O'Neill, Art and Visual Culture on the French Riviera, 1956‚Äì1971: The Ecole de Nice, Ashgate, 2012, p. 93. In spite of the diversity of their plastic language, they perceived a common basis for their work; this being a method of direct appropriation of reality, equivalent, in the terms used by Restany; to a \\"poetic recycling of urban, industrial and advertising reality\\".60/90. Trente ans de Nouveau R√©alisme, La Diff√©rence, 1990, p. 76 Spain In Spain, the study of pop art is associated with the \\"new figurative\\", which arose from the roots of the crisis of informalism. Eduardo Arroyo could be said to fit within the pop art trend, on account of his interest in the environment, his critique of our media culture which incorporates icons of both mass media communication and the history of painting, and his scorn for nearly all established artistic styles. However, the Spanish artist who could be considered most authentically part of \\"pop\\" art is Alfredo Alca√≠n, because of the use he makes of popular images and empty spaces in his compositions. Also in the category of Spanish pop art is the \\"Chronicle Team\\" (El Equipo Cr√≥nica), which existed in Valencia between 1964 and 1981, formed by the artists Manolo Vald√©s and Rafael Solbes. Their movement can be characterized as \\"pop\\" because of its use of comics and publicity images and its simplification of images and photographic compositions. Filmmaker Pedro Almod√≥var emerged from Madrid's \\"La Movida\\" subculture of the 1970s making low budget super 8 pop art movies, and he was subsequently called the Andy Warhol of Spain by the media at the time. In the book Almodovar on Almodovar, he is quoted as saying that the 1950s film \\"Funny Face\\" was a central inspiration for his work. One pop trademark in Almodovar's films is that he always produces a fake commercial to be inserted into a scene. Japan In Japan, pop art evolved from the nation's prominent avant- garde scene. The use of images of the modern world, copied from magazines in the photomontage-style paintings produced by Harue Koga in the late 1920s and early 1930s, foreshadowed elements of pop art. The work of Yayoi Kusama contributed to the development of pop art and influenced many other artists, including Andy Warhol. In the mid-1960s, graphic designer Tadanori Yokoo became one of the most successful pop artists and an international symbol for Japanese pop art. He is well known for his advertisements and creating artwork for pop culture icons such as commissions from The Beatles, Marilyn Monroe, and Elizabeth Taylor, among others. Another leading pop artist at that time was Keiichi Tanaami. Iconic characters from Japanese manga and anime have also become symbols for pop art, such as Speed Racer and Astro Boy. Japanese manga and anime also influenced later pop artists such as Takashi Murakami and his superflat movement. Italy In Italy, by 1964, pop art was known and took different forms, such as the \\"Scuola di Piazza del Popolo\\" in Rome, with pop artists such as Mario Schifano, Franco Angeli, Giosetta Fioroni, Tano Festa, Claudio Cintoli, and some artworks by Piero Manzoni, Lucio Del Pezzo, Mimmo Rotella and Valerio Adami. Italian pop art originated in 1950s culture ‚Äì the works of the artists Enrico Baj and Mimmo Rotella to be precise, rightly considered the forerunners of this scene. In fact, it was around 1958‚Äì1959 that Baj and Rotella abandoned their previous careers (which might be generically defined as belonging to a non-representational genre, despite being thoroughly post-Dadaist), to catapult themselves into a new world of images, and the reflections on them, which was springing up all around them. Rotella's torn posters showed an ever more figurative taste, often explicitly and deliberately referring to the great icons of the times. Baj's compositions were steeped in contemporary kitsch, which turned out to be a \\"gold mine\\" of images and the stimulus for an entire generation of artists. The novelty came from the new visual panorama, both inside \\"domestic walls\\" and out-of-doors. Cars, road signs, television, all the \\"new world\\", everything can belong to the world of art, which itself is new. In this respect, Italian pop art takes the same ideological path as that of the international scene. The only thing that changes is the iconography and, in some cases, the presence of a more critical attitude toward it. Even in this case, the prototypes can be traced back to the works of Rotella and Baj, both far from neutral in their relationship with society. Yet this is not an exclusive element; there is a long line of artists, including Gianni Ruffi, Roberto Barni, Silvio Pasotti, Umberto Bignardi, and Claudio Cintoli, who take on reality as a toy, as a great pool of imagery from which to draw material with disenchantment and frivolity, questioning the traditional linguistic role models with a renewed spirit of \\"let me have fun\\" √† la Aldo Palazzeschi. Belgium In Belgium, pop art was represented to some extent by Paul Van Hoeydonck, whose sculpture Fallen Astronaut was left on the Moon during one of the Apollo missions, as well as by other notable pop artists. Internationally recognized artists such as Marcel Broodthaers ( 'vous √™tes doll? \\"), Evelyne Axell and Panamarenko are indebted to the pop art movement; Broodthaers's great influence was George Segal. Another well-known artist, Roger Raveel, mounted a birdcage with a real live pigeon in one of his paintings. By the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, pop art references disappeared from the work of some of these artists when they started to adopt a more critical attitude towards America because of the Vietnam War's increasingly gruesome character. Panamarenko, however, has retained the irony inherent in the pop art movement up to the present day. Evelyne Axell from Namur was a prolific pop-artist in the 1964-1972 period. Axell was one of the first female pop artists, had been mentored by Magritte and her best-known painting is 'Ice Cream'. Other notable works by Axell can be found in key galleries internationally. Netherlands While there was no formal pop art movement in the Netherlands, there were a group of artists that spent time in New York during the early years of pop art, and drew inspiration from the international pop art movement. Representatives of Dutch pop art include Daan van Golden, Gustave Asselbergs, Jacques Frenken, Jan Cremer, Wim T. Schippers, and Woody van Amen. They opposed the Dutch petit bourgeois mentality by creating humorous works with a serious undertone. Examples of this nature include Sex O'Clock, by Woody van Amen, and Crucifix / Target, by Jacques Frenken. Russia Russia was a little late to become part of the pop art movement, and some of the artwork that resembles pop art only surfaced around the early 1970s, when Russia was a communist country and bold artistic statements were closely monitored. Russia's own version of pop art was Soviet- themed and was referred to as Sots Art. After 1991, the Communist Party lost its power, and with it came a freedom to express. Pop art in Russia took on another form, epitomised by Dmitri Vrubel with his painting titled My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love in 1990. It might be argued that the Soviet posters made in the 1950s to promote the wealth of the nation were in itself a form of pop art.

Created by Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews, Ted was portrayed by comedian Dermot Morgan for the programme's three series. The character is a morally dubious Roman Catholic priest exiled to Craggy Island, a small island off the coast of Galway. The character was originally created by Mathews for a short- lived stand-up routine in the late 1980s. In 1994, Linehan and Mathews cast Morgan in the role for the television series, developing the character to match his abilities. Morgan's performance was acclaimed; after his death in February 1998, he was awarded a posthumous BAFTA for his work in the third series. Concept and creation Nighthawks, 1989. Arthur Mathews (centre) portrays an early version of Father Ted Crilly. Arthur Mathews had a lifelong fascination with priests, and developed the character of Father Ted while working at Hot Press with Graham Linehan and Paul Woodfull in 1987‚Äì89. After considering several surnames, Linehan suggested Crilly, which stuck. Mathews has described his version of Ted as a generic priest, but Woodfull saw the character as more camp, and later said that he felt Mathews had preempted the camp/gay priest stereotype in Irish comedy. During production weekends, Mathews and Woodfull had the idea for The Joshua Trio, a comedic U2 tribute band. The band performed various warm-up sketches written by Mathews, Woodfull and Linehan, who joined in a non-musical capacity. This led to a side-project, a short-lived sketch troupe called The Fun Bunch. Deciding to base a sketch around Mathews's Father Ted character, the group brainstormed for a surname in Linehan's Castleknock kitchen; Linehan suggested Crilly, which stuck immediately. Mathews debuted his character on-stage at a comedy night in the Project Arts Centre. The character was received better than Woodfull's own working-class Dublin priest, and Mathews later appeared as Father Ted in warm- up sketches for The Joshua Trio and Woodfull's other musical act, Tony St James and The Las Vegas Sound. As Ted, Mathews sometimes read from a book, Notes from Africa, purportedly written by Father Dougal McGuire, a missionary friend who described his experiences of being attacked and chased by natives. In one sketch, Ted discussed his concern for Dougal, who had been voted Most Unpopular Priest in Africa for two years running and was spending Christmas up a tree in the grounds of The Bob Geldof Centre. During one Tony St James Olympia gig, audience members shouted \\"Not a fucking priest!\\", but were pleased when Ted produced a portable confessional and proceeded to talk about it. On one occasion at The Purty Loft in D√∫n Laoghaire, he sang \\"We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off\\". Later, Mathews and Woodfull included the character in The Starship R√≥is√≠n, a short-lived science fiction comedy radio series they wrote for The Ian Dempsey Show on RT√â Radio. An Irish parody of Star Trek, it followed the adventures of Captain Bono (played by Woodfull, based on the singer Bono) and his Vulcan sidekick Stephen \\"Spock\\" Roche (played by Mathews, based on cyclist Stephen Roche, with a \\"cold, cycling brain\\". Storylines involved \\"space bicycles\\"), the ship chef Darina Alien (based on Darina Allen), emcee Tony St James (Woodfull), Johnny Guitar (a \\"little fella\\" who made guitar sounds), and ship chaplain Father Ted (Mathews). Woodfull later said that the show was \\"probably a bit too weird for [its] slot\\", and that, when the station suggested they take two of the characters and launch a spin- off called Tea and Toast with Tony and Ted, Mathews opted out. In 1989, Ted (played by Mathews) performed with The Joshua Trio in an episode of the Irish music anthology series Nighthawks, marking the character's first televised appearance. In 1990, Linehan and Mathews began writing Irish Lives, a six-part comedy television series. The show would have taken the form of a mockumentary, with each episode focusing on interviewing a different character; one of the six characters was Father Ted Crilly. The script, delivered in 1990, described Ted as \\"a perpetually jolly and rather sad man who, through some terrible accident of faith, has found himself in the priesthood.\\" The story involved Ted returning to his seminary to catch up with his old friends, including Father Jack, whom he fails to realise has recently died. Producer Geoffrey Perkins asked Linehan and Mathews to discard the mockumentary format and expand the Father Ted episode to a traditional sitcom. Linehan found the character of Ted easier to write if he imagined Mathews's version delivering the lines. \\"Every time I wrote Ted in the early days, I'd hear Arthur's voice... Ted was this very bland character who'd never curse except for saying a very quiet 'feck' to himself. That panic and turmoil under the surface defined Ted before we even started writing him. Years later, when we did, it was just like pressing 'play' on a tape recorder.\\" One of the writers' key influences was Charles Grodin's character in the 1972 film The Heartbreak Kid. Casting Actor Maurice O'Donoghue auditioned for the role, and Linehan felt that he was the right appearance, age and \\"lightness\\" for the character. Mathews wanted to cast comedian Dermot Morgan from an early stage, but Linehan was reluctant; he worried that audiences would confuse Ted with Father Trendy, a character Morgan had previously created for The Live Mike. Trendy parodied a class of priests including Brian D'Arcy, perceived in the 1970s as wanting to be considered liberal and \\"cool\\", whereas Ted was written as a more conservative, traditional priest. Morgan lobbied hard for the role, eventually persuading Linehan. The writers considered O'Donoghue a back-up to use should Morgan become unavailable, and later created Father Dick Byrne, Ted's recurring rival, specifically for O'Donoghue to play. Aspects such as Ted's obsession with money and fantasy of going to Las Vegas emerged while writing for Morgan, and the writers began to feel for Ted in a way they did not for the other characters. After the second series aired, Linehan said he still believed that Mathews could easily have played Ted in the show. There have been several attempts to remake the show for American audiences. In 2004, Steve Martin was reported to have signed on to play Ted in a new version. In 2007, John Michael Higgins was cast in the part. No remake has yet entered production, as of 2019. Fictional character biography Considered his family's \\"idiot brother\\", Ted was sent off to the priesthood while his brother, the favourite son, became a doctor, as was the custom at the time. Ted attended Saint Colm's seminary, and was bullied by the other novices, who nicknamed him Father Fluffybottom after seeing his backside in the showers. Some time after being ordained, he was stationed in a Wexford parish, where he was investigated under suspicion of stealing a child's Lourdes money (which he maintained was \\"just resting in his account\\") to fund his own trip to Las Vegas. Though escaping formal charges, Bishop Brennan still banished Ted to the remote, cold, rainy Craggy Island, telling him that he would stay there until all of the money was accounted for. Ted was unsuccessful in this regard, as in the first series he mentions having lived on the island for over six years. He was eventually promoted and managed to move to a comfortable parish in Dublin, though his stay there was abruptly ended after irregularities in his expenses claims were discovered, and he was promptly sent straight back to Craggy Island. For the duration of the show, Ted lives in the Craggy Island Parochial House with the childlike and dimwitted Father Dougal McGuire, the senile, aggressive and alcoholic Father Jack Hackett, and their neurotic housekeeper, Mrs Doyle (whom Linehan states Ted first met when she won the local Lovely Girls competition). He has a bitter rivalry with Father Dick Byrne, a priest living on the nearby Rugged Island. Ted's experiences throughout the show range from the mundane (having to protest against a blasphemous film in \\"The Passion of Saint Tibulus\\" and rigging a raffle to repair the roof in \\"Think Fast, Father Ted\\"), to the surreal (becoming Ireland's entry for Eurosong 1996 in \\"A Song for Europe\\", and climbing out of a flying plane to fix the fuel line in \\"Flight Into Terror\\"). In \\"A Christmassy Ted\\", Ted prevents a national scandal by helping seven other priests find their way out of Ireland's largest department store lingerie section. The Church honours him with the Golden Cleric award. Fathers Ted and Dougal then host the 1997 Comic Relief telethon (with Morgan and O'Hanlon in character for the duration of the event); when Ted wonders why he has been selected, Dougal suggests that God has planned it to allow Ted a chance to earn forgiveness for his sins by raising money for the charity. In the next episode, the first of series three, \\"Are You Right There Father Ted?\\", Ted has been transferred to an idyllic parish in Castlelawn, Dublin, but is soon sent back to Craggy Island when irregularities are discovered in his expenses. He later discovers the hard way that there is a Chinatown on Craggy Island and then has to go to great lengths to disprove rumours that he is a racist. In the final episode, \\"Going to America\\", Ted persuades the suicidal Father Kevin not to jump off a ledge at the \\"It's Great Being a Priest! '98\\" conference. Impressed, an American priest offers Ted a place at his Los Angeles parish. Ted, unable to tell the others that they cannot come with him, is wracked with guilt; he cancels the move at the last minute after discovering Los Angele's gang problem , then tells them that he has realised he belongs on Craggy Island. Dougal says that they will live together on the island forever, and a montage of clips from all previous episodes is shown before the episode ends. The episode originally ended by flashing forward a year to the next conference. Ted sees Father Kevin standing on the ledge again; instead of helping, he joins him on the ledge, preparing to jump himself. The scene was cut and replaced with the montage following Morgan's death and poor reaction from audiences. Mathews later noted that the original ending still left Ted's fate ambiguous, and would have suggested the possibility of future episodes. Linehan stated, \\"It's nice to think of them all in the house having adventures, but when you think about it, it's really cruel to Ted. It's just an awful future for him... He's not watching a sitcom, he's living this awful life.\\" Personality The Independent characterised Ted as \\"by turns devious, cunning and disingenuous\\", noting a running joke about parish funds being traced to Ted's personal account. Ardal O'Hanlon, who played Father Dougal, said that Ted was the show's only rounded, fully formed character, and that the rest of the cast were essentially playing caricatures. Ted is frequently portrayed as a natural leader, albeit within the context of the priesthood. In a 1997 interview, Morgan attributed the show's success to the appealing double-act formed by Dougal, \\"an idiot who knows nothing\\", and Ted, \\"an idiot who thinks he knows something but actually knows nothing.\\" The actor identified Ted as \\"an Everyman guy, bumbling through life with a half-wit.\\" Linehan and Mathews have described Ted as a decent man, albeit one with \\"cheap\\" and \\"earthly\\" ambitions; they note that he would hate to become a bishop or cardinal. Ted does not want to be seen as a priest, but is still willing to flash his collar and ask for free entry at the cinema. The writers also agree that Ted is the character most like them. Mathews grew up surrounded by priests (including his own uncle), and it was from these priests that Mathews drew Ted's \\"voice\\". Linehan is often asked about potential Father Ted spin-offs, but believes that Ted himself is the only character complex enough to survive outside the Father Ted environment. Mathews has suggested that Ted could even have worked well in a spin-off drama series. The writers agree that Ted should be married to Polly Clarke (played by Gemma Craven), the novelist he becomes infatuated with in \\"And God Created Woman\\", and consider the impossibility of their relationship \\"terribly sad\\". Appearance Ted is a middle-aged man with a distinctive head of silver-grey hair (often imitated through wigs by cosplaying fans). He wears two badges: one is a pin signifying membership of the Pioneers, an Irish Catholic teetotalers organisation, and the other is a F√°inne, which indicates the wearer's fluency in the Irish language. Reception and legacy In 1996, Morgan was named the Best TV Comedy Actor at the British Comedy Awards for his performance in the second series. He died in February 1998, one day after the third series of Father Ted completed recording, and was posthumously given the Award for Best Comedy Performance at the British Academy Television Awards 1999. In November 2014, the Irish Examiner named Ted the greatest Irish TV character, calling him \\"a rare example of a straight man providing almost as many chuckles as his compatriots\\" and praising his characterisation as an \\"upstanding-yet-oh-so- faintly-slippery man of the cloth\\" as true to life for many rural Irish viewers.

Microscopic view of a histologic specimen of human lung tissue stained with hematoxylin and eosin. In biology, tissue is a cellular organizational level between cells and a complete organ. A tissue is an ensemble of similar cells and their extracellular matrix from the same origin that together carry out a specific function. Organs are then formed by the functional grouping together of multiple tissues. The English word \\"tissue\\" derives from the French word \\"tissu\\", meaning that something that is \\"woven\\", from the verb tisser, \\"to weave\\". The study of human and animal tissues is known as histology or, in connection with disease, as histopathology. For plants, the discipline is called plant anatomy. The classical tools for studying tissues are the paraffin block in which tissue is embedded and then sectioned, the histological stain, and the optical microscope. Developments in electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and the use of frozen tissue-sections have enhanced the detail that can be observed in tissues. With these tools, the classical appearances of tissues can be examined in health and disease, enabling considerable refinement of medical diagnosis and prognosis.  Animals  PAS diastase showing the fungus Histoplasma Animal tissues are grouped into four basic types: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial. Collections of tissues joined in units to serve a common function compose organs. While all animals can generally be considered to contain the four tissue types, the manifestation of these tissues can differ depending on the type of organism. For example, the origin of the cells comprising a particular tissue type may differ developmentally for different classifications of animals. The epithelium in all animals is derived from the ectoderm and endoderm, with a small contribution from the mesoderm, forming the endothelium, a specialized type of epithelium that composes the vasculature. By contrast, a true epithelial tissue is present only in a single layer of cells held together via occluding junctions called tight junctions, to create a selectively permeable barrier. This tissue covers all organismal surfaces that come in contact with the external environment such as the skin, the airways, and the digestive tract. It serves functions of protection, secretion, and absorption, and is separated from other tissues below by a basal lamina. = Epithelial tissue = The epithelial tissues are formed by cells that cover the organ surfaces, such as the surface of skin, the airways, surfaces of soft organs,the reproductive tract, and the inner lining of the digestive tract. The cells comprising an epithelial layer are linked via semi- permeable, tight junctions; hence, this tissue provides a barrier between the external environment and the organ it covers. In addition to this protective function, epithelial tissue may also be specialized to function in secretion, excretion and absorption. Epithelial tissue helps to protect organs from microorganisms, injury, and fluid loss. Functions of epithelial tissue: *The principle function of epithelial tissues are covering and lining of free surface * The cells of the body's surface form the outer layer of skin. * Inside the body, epithelial cells form the lining of the mouth and alimentary canal and protect these organs. * Epithelial tissues help in absorption of water and nutrients. * Epithelial tissues help in the elimination of waste. * Epithelial tissues secrete enzymes and/or hormones in the form of glands. * Some epithelial tissue perform secretory functions. They secrete a variety of substances including sweat, saliva, mucus, enzymes. There are many kinds of epithelium, and nomenclature is somewhat variable. Most classification schemes combine a description of the cell-shape in the upper layer of the epithelium with a word denoting the number of layers: either simple (one layer of cells) or stratified (multiple layers of cells). However, other cellular features such as cilia may also be described in the classification system. Some common kinds of epithelium are listed below: * Simple squamous epithelium * Stratified squamous epithelium * Simple cuboidal epithelium * Transitional epithelium * Pseudostratified columnar epithelium (also known as ciliated columnar epithelium) * Columnar epithelium * Glandular epithelium = Connective tissue = Connective tissues are fibrous tissues made up of cells separated by non-living material, which is called an extracellular matrix. This matrix can be liquid or rigid. For example, blood contains plasma as its matrix and bone's matrix is rigid. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. Blood, bone, tendon, ligament, adipose, and areolar tissues are examples of connective tissues. One method of classifying connective tissues is to divide them into three types: fibrous connective tissue, skeletal connective tissue, and fluid connective tissue. = Muscular tissue = Muscle cells form the active contractile tissue of the body known as muscle tissue or muscular tissue. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle tissue is separated into three distinct categories: visceral or smooth muscle, found in the inner linings of organs; skeletal muscle, typically attached to bones, which generate gross movement; and cardiac muscle, found in the heart, where it contracts to pump blood throughout an organism. = Nervous tissue = Cells comprising the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system are classified as nervous (or neural) tissue. In the central nervous system, neural tissues form the brain and spinal cord. In the peripheral nervous system, neural tissues form the cranial nerves and spinal nerves, inclusive of the motor neurons.  Plants  Cross-section of a flax plant stem with several layers of different tissue types: 1\\\\. Pith 2\\\\. Protoxylem 3\\\\. Xylem I 4\\\\. Phloem I 5\\\\. Sclerenchyma (bast fibre) 6\\\\. Cortex 7\\\\. Epidermis In plant anatomy, tissues are categorized broadly into three tissue systems: the epidermis, the ground tissue, and the vascular tissue. * Epidermis - Cells forming the outer surface of the leaves and of the young plant body. * Vascular tissue - The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. These transport fluids and nutrients internally. * Ground tissue - Ground tissue is less differentiated than other tissues. Ground tissue manufactures nutrients by photosynthesis and stores reserve nutrients. Plant tissues can also be divided differently into two types: # Meristematic tissues # Permanent tissues. = Meristematic tissues = Meristematic tissue consists of actively dividing cells, and leads to increase in length and thickness of the plant. The primary growth of a plant occurs only in certain, specific regions, such as in the tips of stems or roots. It is in these regions that meristematic tissues are present. Cells in these tissues are roughly spherical or polyhedral, to rectangular in shape, and have thin cell walls. New cells produced by meristem are initially those of meristem itself, but as the new cells grow and mature, their characteristics slowly change and they become differentiated as components of the region of occurrence of meristematic tissues, being classified as: * Apical meristem - It is present at the growing tips of stems and roots and increases the length of the stem and root. They form growing parts at the apices of roots and stems and are responsible for the increase in length, also called primary growth. This meristem is responsible for the linear growth of an organ. * Lateral meristem - This meristem consists of cells which mainly divide in one plane and cause the organ to increase in diameter and growth. Lateral meristem usually occurs beneath the bark of the tree in the form of Cork Cambium and in vascular bundles of dicots in the form of vascular cambium. The activity of this cambium results in the formation of secondary growth. * Intercalary meristem - This meristem is located in between permanent tissues. It is usually present at the base of the node, internode and on leaf base. They are responsible for growth in length of the plant and increasing the size of the internode. They result in branch formation and growth. The cells of meristematic tissues are similar in structure and have thin and elastic primary cell wall made up of cellulose. They are compactly arranged without inter-cellular spaces between them. Each cell contains a dense cytoplasm and a prominent nucleus. The dense protoplasm of meristematic cells contains very few vacuoles. Normally the meristematic cells are oval, polygonal or rectangular in shape. Meristematic tissue cells have a large nucleus with small or no vacuoles as they have no need to store anything, opposed to their function of multiplying and increasing the girth and length of the plant, and no intercellular spaces. = Permanent tissues = Permanent tissues may be defined as a group of living or dead cells formed by meristematic tissue and have lost their ability to divide and have permanently placed at fixed positions in the plant body. Meristematic tissues that take up a specific role lose the ability to divide. This process of taking up a permanent shape, size and a function is called cellular differentiation. Cells of meristematic tissue differentiate to form different types of permanent tissues. There are 3 types of permanent tissues: # simple permanent tissues # complex permanent tissues # special or secretory tissues (glandular).  Simple Permanent tissues  A group of cells which are similar in origin; similar in structure and similar in function are called simple permanent tissue. They are of three types: # Parenchyma # Collenchyma # Sclerenchyma = Parenchyma = Parenchyma (para - 'beside'; infusion - 'tissue') is the bulk of a substance. In plants, it consists of relatively unspecialized living cells with thin cell walls that are usually loosely packed so that intercellular spaces are found between cells of this tissue. These are generally isodiametric, in shape. They contain small number of vacuoles or sometimes they even may not contain any vacuole. Even if they do so the vacuole is of much smaller size than of normal animal cells. This tissue provides support to plants and also stores food. Chlorenchyma is a special type of parenchyma that contains chlorophyll and performs photosynthesis. In aquatic plants, aerenchyma tissues, or large air cavities, give support to float on water by making them buoyant. Parenchyma cells called idioblasts have metabolic waste. Spindle shape fiber also contained into this cell to support them and known as prosenchyma, succulent parenchyma also noted. In xerophytes, parenchyma tissues store water. = Collenchyma = Cross section of collenchyma cells Collenchyma is Greek word where \\"Colla\\" means gum and \\"enchyma\\" means infusion. It is a living tissue of primary body like Parenchyma. Cells are thin-walled but possess thickening of cellulose, water and pectin substances (pectocellulose) at the corners where a number of cells join together. This tissue gives tensile strength to the plant and the cells are compactly arranged and have very little inter-cellular spaces. It occurs chiefly in hypodermis of stems and leaves. It is absent in monocots and in roots. Sometimes it contains chlorophyll which can help them photosynthesize. Collenchymatous tissue acts as a supporting tissue in stems of young plants. It provides mechanical support, elasticity, and tensile strength to the plant body. It helps in manufacturing sugar and storing it as starch. It is present in the margin of leaves and resists tearing effect of the wind. = Sclerenchyma = Sclerenchyma is Greek word where \\"Sclero-\\" means hard and \\"enchyma\\" means infusion. This tissue consists of thick-walled, dead cells and protoplasm is negligible. These cells have hard and extremely thick secondary walls due to uniform distribution and high secretion of lignin and have a function of providing mechanical support. They do not have inter-molecular space between them. Lignin deposition is so thick that the cell walls become strong, rigid and impermeable to water which is also known as a stone cell or sclereids. These tissues are mainly of two types: sclerenchyma fiber and sclereids. Sclerenchyma fiber cells have a narrow lumen and are long, narrow and unicellular. Fibers are elongated cells that are strong and flexible, often used in ropes. Sclereids have extremely thick cell walls and are brittle, and are found in nutshells and legumes. = Epidermis = The entire surface of the plant consists of a single layer of cells called epidermis or surface tissue. The entire surface of the plant has this outer layer of the epidermis. Hence it is also called surface tissue. Most of the epidermal cells are relatively flat. The outer and lateral walls of the cell are often thicker than the inner walls. The cells form a continuous sheet without intercellular spaces. It protects all parts of the plant. The outer epidermis is coated with a waxy thick layer called cuticle which prevents loss of water. The epidermis also consists of stomata(singular:stoma) which helps in transpiration.  Complex permanent tissue  The complex tissue consists of more than one type of cells which work together as a unit. Complex tissues help in the transportation of organic material, water, and minerals up and down the plants. That is why it is also known as conducting and vascular tissue. The common types of complex permanent tissue are: * Xylem or wood * Phloem or bast. Xylem and phloem together form vascular bundles. = Xylem = Xylem consists of: * Xylem tracheids * Xylem vessel * Xylem fibres or Xylem sclerenchyma * Xylem parenchyma Cross section of 2-year-old Tilia Americana, highlighting xylem ray shape and orientation.Xylem serves as a chief conducting tissue of vascular plants. It is responsible for the conduction of water and mineral ions/salt. Xylem tissue is organised in a tube-like fashion along the main axes of stems and roots. It consists of a combination of parenchyma cells, fibers, vessels, tracheids, and ray cells. Longer tubes made up of individual cells are vessels tracheids, while vessel members are open at each end. Internally, there may be bars of wall material extending across the open space. These cells are joined end to end to form long tubes. Vessel members and tracheids are dead at maturity. Tracheids have thick secondary cell walls and are tapered at the ends. They do not have end openings such as the vessels. The tracheids end overlap with each other, with pairs of pits present. The pit pairs allow water to pass from cell to cell. Though most conduction in xylem tissue is vertical, lateral conduction along the diameter of a stem is facilitated via rays. Rays are horizontal rows of long-living parenchyma cells that arise out of the vascular cambium. In trees and other woody plants, rays radiate out from the center of stems and roots and appear like spokes on a wheel in cross section. Rays, unlike vessel members and tracheids, are alive at functional maturity. = Phloem = Phloem consists of: * Sieve tube * Companion cell * Phloem fibre * Phloem parenchyma. Phloem is an equally important plant tissue as it also is part of the 'plumbing system' of a plant. Primarily, phloem carries dissolved food substances throughout the plant. This conduction system is composed of sieve- tube member and companion cells, that are without secondary walls. The parent cells of the vascular cambium produce both xylem and phloem. This usually also includes fibers, parenchyma and ray cells. Sieve tubes are formed from sieve- tube members laid end to end. The end walls, unlike vessel members in xylem, do not have openings. The end walls, however, are full of small pores where cytoplasm extends from cell to cell. These porous connections are called sieve plates. In spite of the fact that their cytoplasm is actively involved in the conduction of food materials, sieve-tube members do not have nuclei at maturity. It is the companion cells that are nestled between sieve-tube members that function in some manner bringing about the conduction of food. Sieve-tube members that are alive contain a polymer called callose, a carbohydrate polymer, forming the callus pad/callus, the colourless substance that covers the sieve plate. Callose stays in solution as long as the cell contents are under pressure. Phloem transports food and materials in plants upwards and downwards as required.  Mineralized tissues  Mineralized tissues are biological tissues that incorporate minerals into soft matrices. Such tissues may be found in both plants and animals, as well as algae. Typically these tissues form a protective shield against predation or provide structural support. History of the concept Xavier Bichat (1771‚Äì1802) The term was introduced in anatomy by Xavier Bichat in 1801. He was \\"the first to propose that tissue is a central element in human anatomy, and he considered organs as collections of often disparate tissues, rather than as entities in themselves\\". Although he worked without a microscope, Bichat distinguished 21 types of elementary tissues from which the organs of the human body are composed, a number later reduced by other authors.

A farmer-run organisation, British Wool was established in 1950 with the aim of achieving the best possible net return for producers. It is the only organisation in the world that collects, grades, sells and promotes fleece wool and is the only remaining agricultural commodity board in the UK. Receiving no financial support, although operating commercially, British Wool is a non-profit-making organisation, returning to producers the market price for their wool, with its own costs deducted.  Organisational structure  Under the British Wool Marketing Scheme, British Wool is required to register all producers with four or more sheep with the exception of producers in Shetland, which has its own arrangement by selling through a cooperative. This system was developed after the Second World War, when farmers were trying to sell their wool on an open market. The system was described as being \\"chaotic and discriminatory\\". According to British Wool, there were between 40,000 and 46,000 registered producers in 2015. The number of producers has been falling; in 1995 it was 91,000, by 2012 it was 75,000. This has also been in line with the number of sheep available; in 1990 there were 65 million sheep for wool farming, by 2012 this had fallen to 40 million. Certain rare breeds of sheep are exempt from the BWMB system (British Merino, castle milk, Lincoln Longwool etc.), but farmers may also apply to keep for artisan purposes. Additionally, up to may be exempt for non-textile uses such as building insulation. The board of nine elected producer members, representing nine different areas of the UK, and two government appointees, meet eight times a year and report back to nine regionally elected committees. Day-to-day operations are run from British Wool's headquarters in Bradford, West Yorkshire with smaller offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Wool fleeces are graded at one of the eleven grading centres that the BWMB operate, and then they are sent to auctions which are held up 18 times per year.

It served as the navigation authority for the majority of canals and a number of rivers and docks in England, Scotland and Wales. On 2 July 2012 all of British Waterways' assets and responsibilities in England and Wales were transferred to the newly founded charity the Canal & River Trust. In Scotland, British Waterways continues to operate as a standalone public corporation under the trading name Scottish Canals. The British Waterways Board was initially established as a result of the Transport Act 1962 and took control of the inland waterways assets of the British Transport Commission in 1963. British Waterways was sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in England and Wales, and by the Scottish Government in Scotland. British Waterways managed and maintained of canals, rivers and docks within the United Kingdom including the buildings, structures and landscapes alongside these waterways. Half of the United Kingdom population lives within five miles of a canal or river once managed by British Waterways.British Waterways London Quarterly Newsletter, Summer 2007 In addition to the watercourses, British Waterways also cared for and owned 2,555 listed structuresBritish Waterways Heritage including seventy scheduled ancient monuments. A further 800 areas have special designation and a further hundred are Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). Through its charitable arm The Waterways Trust, British Waterways maintained a museum of its history at the National Waterways Museum's three sites at Gloucester Docks, Stoke Bruerne and Ellesmere Port. Since the transfer of the assets and responsibilities of British Waterways to the Canal & River Trust the Waterways Trust in England and Wales has merged with the Canal & River Trust. It continues, however, as an independent charity in Scotland. History British Waterways sign near Gas Street Basin on the BCN Main Line in Birmingham =Formation= During the early 20th century, the canal network was in decline because of increasing competition from the railways and road transport. Until the 1950s, freight and other cargo was still carried on the canals, by then owned by the railway companies. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, the canals they owned were also incorporated into the new British Transport Commission. The Commission focused on encouraging commercial traffic to the waterways, but with the construction of motorways in the 1950s, and legislation such as the Clean Air Act 1956 affecting the coal carriers using the waterways, that policy could not be sustained. The last regular long-distance narrow-boat-carrying contract, to a jam factory near London, ended in October 1970, although lime juice continued to be carried by narrow boat from Brentford to Boxmoor until 1981, and aggregate from Thurmaston to Syston from 1976 until 1988. Under the Transport Act 1962, the British Transport Commission was split into several new organisations, including the British Railways Board and the London Transport Board, with the inland waterways of Britain becoming part of the new British Waterways Board (BWB). In the same year, a remarkably harsh winter saw many boats frozen into their moorings, unable to move for weeks at a time. That was one of the reasons given for the decision by the BWB to formally cease most of its commercial narrow boat traffic on the canals. By that time, the canal network had shrunk to just , half the size it was at its peak in the early 19th century. However, the basic network was still intact, with many of the closures affecting duplicate routes or branches. =Transport Act 1968 = The Transport Act 1968 classified the nationalised waterways into three distinct categories as specified by BWB: * Commercial - Waterways that could still support commercial traffic; these were mainly located in the North East of England * Cruising - Waterways that had a potential for leisure use, such as cruising, fishing and recreational use * Remainder - Waterways for which no potential commercial or leisure use could be seen. British Waterways Board was required under the Act to keep Commercial and Cruising Waterways fit for their respective traffic and use. However, these obligations were subject to the caveat of being by the most economical means and BWB had no requirement to maintain Remainder waterways or keep them in a navigable condition. As a result, many remainder waterways could face abandonment or transference to the local authority who would contribute to the waterway's upkeep as part of the act. Additionally, many of these remainder waterways were crossed by new roads and motorways without provision for boat navigation. =Late 20th century= As the century progressed leisure boating on the canals began to expand, with numbers reaching 20,000 by the early 1980s. Additionally, the work of voluntary restoration groups succeeded in restoring some waterways to their former condition. However, despite this steady progress throughout the 1970s and 1980s, organisations such as English Heritage criticised the newly named British Waterways for failing to provide \\"adequate training or access to professional advice [for British Waterways officers] on the conservation of historic structures\\". However, by the late 1990s the canal network and British Waterways were flourishing; revenues generated for canal maintenance reached ¬£100,000,000 for the first time in 1998, large grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund allowed the canal network to expand again by restoring former canals and additional funding was announced for British Waterways in 1999 by the then Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. By the early 2000s, boating numbers had overtaken the previous industrial revolution high and the canal network was officially classed as 'safe' following the completion of all outstanding safety works. =Abolition= By 2009, British Waterways was looking for a means of gaining a larger and more secure supply of funding in order to plug a ¬£30m shortfall in its budget, while utilising the potential for volunteers on the waterways, allowing the waterways community to play a greater role. Its plans involved moving to become a charitable trust, in charge of the current canal systems in addition to acquiring other waterways, such as those operated by the Environment Agency. In March 2010, the plans were given a boost when the government announced in the Budget that it intended to turn BW into a mutual organisation, but no further details were released. BW welcomed the announcement, with the chairman Tony Hales stating that the plan would preserve the canals and their associated infrastructure, and \\"safeguard against a return to the decline and dereliction which they faced in the last century\\". It would also \\"unlock the enormous public support that there is for them.\\" By September of the same year the proposals seemed likely to be enacted; a leaked list of quangos that were due to be abolished was acquired by the BBC, including British Waterways, with the note: \\"Abolish as a non-departmental public body and mutualise\\". The following month saw an official announcement from British Waterways confirming the leaked list, and that a new charity would be established to tend the of canals and rivers in England and Wales cared for by British Waterways. The new name, the Canal & River Trust, and logo were revealed in October 2011, and the trust was granted charitable status on 5 April 2012. On 2 July 2012 all of British Waterways' responsibilities for waterways in England and Wales were transferred to the Canal & River Trust. The Scottish Government, however, decided that the waterways in Scotland would not be part of the new charity, and that British Waterways Scotland would remain a state-owned entity, operating as Scottish Canals. Organisation River Avon British Waterways operated from headquarters in Watford, with additional administrative offices in Leeds and thirteen regional waterway offices. At the strategic level, there were ten non-executive board members, who were led by the chairman (in the final phase of operations, Tony Hales), and appointed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Scottish Government (eight by the former and two by the latter). In addition, there were nine executive directors led by Robin Evans, the Chief Executive. At a regional level, British Waterways was divided into thirteen regional waterways; each appointed a waterways manager. These regions were: *Scotland (Highlands) *Scotland (Lowlands) *North West Waterways *North East Waterways *Manchester and Pennine Waterways *North Wales and Borders Waterways *West Midlands Waterways *Central Shires Waterways *East Midlands Waterways *South Wales and Severn Waterways *South East Waterways *Kennet and Avon Waterways *London Waterways Finance British Waterways was funded through a mixture of commercial activities, government grants and grants and donations from charitable bodies. In 2010/11, BW raised over ¬£103.6 million from their commercial activities, including waterways licensing, received ¬£58.9 million from a government grant, issued via the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and gained a further ¬£14 million through third party contributions. However, operating revenue for the company was at a deficit of ¬£3.7 million, a result of a large cut of 16 per cent in the government grant given to BW, and through the continuing programme of renovation and works costing ¬£92.1 million. British Waterways owned a large canalside property portfolio which made a considerable contribution to the funding of the waterway network. This amounted to ¬£130m in the five years prior to 2008. As of 2008, a HM Treasury team was reviewing the management of this portfolio in terms of public sector savings and efficiencies. Another source of revenue contemplated by BW in October 2008 was the installation of 50 wind turbines on waterside land, generating around 100 megawatts. Waterscape As part of British Waterways' commitment to promote the canals to users other than boaters, BW set up the Waterscape website in 2003 to be an official information and leisure resource for UK inland waterways. The website worked alongside the Environment Agency and the Broads Authority and covered all canals, rivers and waterways in England, Scotland and Wales. The Waterscape website was taken down on 3 July 2012 and was replaced by the new website of the Canal & River Trust.

The Port of London Authority is that for the tidal section of the Thames. Broads Authority is that for the Norfolk Broads. The Manchester Ship Canal, Bridgewater Canal, Basingstoke Canal, Cam and Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation were managed by other authorities.

WWT Caerlaverock It covers a site at Eastpark Farm, on the north shore of the Solway Firth to the south of Dumfries. It is a wild nature reserve with a network of screened approaches and several observation towers. There is a visitor centre and farmhouse accommodation. The site received 13,913 visitors in 2018. Caerlaverock is home to one of only two UK populations of the \\"living fossil\\" Triops cancriformis, the horseshoe shrimp. It is also home to the UK's most northerly population of the natterjack toad. Almost the entire Svalbard population of barnacle goose overwinters in the Solway Firth area, with many of the birds often at Caerlaverock for part or all of the winter; their protection by the reserve has enabled the population to recover from just 500 birds in the 1940s, to over 25,000 now. In 2016 the peak count on the reserve was 15,980 in October. Other high counts of wildfowl that year included 221 whooper swan, 2,457 Northern pintail, 3,000 Eurasian teal, 1,230 Eurasian wigeon and 150 greater scaup. These numbers attract raptors such as peregrine falcon, common buzzard and hen harrier. Vagrant birds recorded on the reserve include common crane, long-billed dowitcher, red-breasted goose, snow goose, ring-necked duck and white-tailed plover. In January 2002, a new education centre was officially opened by King Harald V of Norway. A pair of ospreys have nested on the reserve since 2005. Their nest can be observed by webcam through the reserve's web-site during the day in the nesting season (April‚ÄìAugust). At other times the webcam shows the whooper pond or a barn owl nest.

Cavendish held public office and accumulated a considerable fortune, and became one of Thomas Cromwell's \\"visitors of the monasteries\\" during the dissolution of the monasteries. He was MP for Thirsk in 1547.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/cavendish- sir-william-1505-57 In 1547 he married Bess of Hardwick, and the couple began the construction of Chatsworth House in 1552, a project which would not be completed until after his death. His second son William Cavendish (1552‚Äì1626) became the first Earl of Devonshire, purchasing his title from the impecunious King James I. Early life He was the younger son of Thomas Cavendish (1472‚Äì1524), who was a senior financial official, the \\"clerk of the pipe\\", in the Court of Exchequer, and his wife, Alice Smith of Padbrook Hall. He was the great-great-great-grandson of Sir John Cavendish from whom the Dukes of Devonshire and the Dukes of Newcastle inherited the family name of Cavendish. Career Cavendish became one of Thomas Cromwell's \\"visitors of the monasteries\\" when King Henry VIII annexed the property of the Catholic Church at the end of the 1530s, in the dissolution of the monasteries. This followed from his successful career as a financial expert holding public office in the Exchequer, which led to his wealth. He was accused of accumulating extra riches unfairly during the dissolution. After Cromwell's fall, he was sent to Ireland to survey and value lands which had fallen to the English during the Fitzgerald Rebellion. Chatsworth House, Derbyshire, begun by Cavendish He was connected to the Seymour brothers Edward and Thomas, and via them to the family of Jane Grey, but he also took care to send tokens of goodwill to The Lady Mary. He was appointed Treasurer of the Chamber from 1546 to 1553 but, after an audit, was accused of embezzling a significant amount of money. Only his death saved the family from disgrace. During the reign of Mary I, a favourable biography of Thomas Cardinal Wolsey was first published, written from the perspective of one of his closest aides, the one who had taken King Henry news of Wolsey's death. Although for centuries Sir William was said to be its author, historians now attribute it to his older brother George Cavendish (1494‚Äì1562). Family William Cavendish had a total of 16 children by three different wives. His first wife was Margaret Bostock; they had five children, but only three daughters survived: * Catherine, who married Thomas Brooke, son of Lord Cobham * Mary (died after 1547) * Ann who married Sir Henry Boynton in 1561. * Margaret, died in 1540. In 1542 he was married to Elizabeth Parker; she had three children, none of whom survived. She died after giving birth to a stillborn daughter in 1546. In 1547 he married Bess of Hardwick.Pearson, John, The Serpent and the Stag, (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1983), 6. He sold his property in Suffolk and moved to Bess's native county of Derbyshire. He purchased the Chatsworth estate in 1549 and the couple began to build Chatsworth House in 1552.Pearson, 18. In the ten years before he died, they had eight children, six of whom survived infancy: * Frances Cavendish, (1548‚Äì1632) married Henry Pierrepont. * Henry Cavendish, (1550‚Äì1616), eldest son, Knight of the Shire and MP for Derbyshire for over 20 years, eventually disinherited by his mother in favour of his younger brother William. * William Cavendish (1552‚Äì1626), the first Earl of Devonshire. *Charles Cavendish, (1553‚Äì1617) father of William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle * Elizabeth Cavendish, (1555‚Äì1582) later entered into a controversial marriage with Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox, by whom she was the mother of Arbella Stuart, claimant to the English throne. * Mary Cavendish, (1556‚Äì1632) married Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury. Their daughter Alethea Talbot Howard is an ancestor of the 5th and later Dukes of Norfolk.

After experimenting with Impressionism and Pointillism, Picabia became associated with Cubism. His highly abstract planar compositions were colourful and rich in contrasts. He was one of the early major figures of the Dada movement in the United States and in France. He was later briefly associated with Surrealism, but would soon turn his back on the art establishment.Marianne Heinz, Grove Art Online, MoMA, 2009 Oxford University Press  Biography  = Early life = La Source (The Spring), oil on canvas, 249.6 x 249.3 cm, Museum of Modern Art, NewYork. Exhibited at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, Paris Francis Picabia was born in Paris of a French mother and a Cuban father who was an attach√© at the Cuban legation in Paris. His mother died of tuberculosis when he was seven. Some sources would have his father as of aristocratic Spanish descent, whereas others consider him of non- aristocratic Spanish descent, from the region of Galicia. Financially independent, Picabia studied under Fernand Cormon and others at the √âcole des Arts Decoratifs in the late 1890s.

Joseph Csaky (Groupe de femmes, sculpture front the left); Amedeo Modigliani (sculptures behind that of Csaky); paintings by Franti≈°ek Kupka (Amorpha, Fugue in Two Colors); Francis Picabia (The Spring); Jean Metzinger (Dancer in a caf√©); and Henri Le Fauconnier (Mountaineers Attacked by Bears) In 1894, Picabia financed his stamp collection by copying a collection of Spanish paintings that belonged to his father, switching the originals for the copies, without his father's knowledge, and selling the originals. Fernand Cormon took him into his academy at 104 boulevard de Clichy, where Van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec had also studied. From the age of 20, he lived by painting; he subsequently inherited money from his mother.

In the beginning of his career, from 1903 to 1908, Picabia was influenced by the Impressionist paintings of Alfred Sisley. Little churches, lanes, roofs of Paris, riverbanks, wash houses, lanes, barges‚Äîthese were his subject matter. Some however, began to question his sincerity and said he copied Sisley, or that his cathedrals looked like Monet, or that he painted like Signac. online biography, retrieved June 15, 2009 From 1909, he came under the influence of those that would soon be called Cubists and later form the Golden Section (Section d'Or). The same year, he married Gabrielle Buffet. Around 1911 Picabia joined the Puteaux Group, members of which he met at the studio of Jacques Villon in Puteaux; a commune in the western suburbs of Paris. There he became friends with artist Marcel Duchamp and close friends with Guillaume Apollinaire. Other group members included Albert Gleizes, Roger de La Fresnaye, Fernand L√©ger and Jean Metzinger. Picabia paintings published in the New York Tribune, 9March 1913 = Proto-Dada = Picabia was the only member of the Cubist group to personally attend the Armory Show, and Alfred Stieglitz gave him a solo show, Exhibition of New York studies by Francis Picabia, at his gallery 291 (formerly Little Galleries of the Photo- Secession), 17 March ‚Äì 5 April 1913. From 1913 to 1915 Picabia traveled to New York City several times and took active part in the avant-garde movements, introducing Modern art to America. When he landed in NewYork in June 1915, though it was ostensibly meant to be a simple port of call en route to Cuba to buy molasses for a friend of his‚Äîthe director of a sugar refinery‚Äîthe city snapped him up and the stay became prolonged.

He suffered from dropsy and tachycardia.Paris Match No 2791 These years can be characterized as Picabia's proto-Dada period, consisting mainly of his portraits m√©caniques. = Manifesto = Machine Turn Quickly, 1916-1918, tempera on paper, National Gallery of Art Later, in 1916, while in Barcelona and within a small circle of refugee artists that included Albert Gleizes and his wife Juliette Roche, Marie Laurencin, Olga Sacharoff, Robert Delaunay and Sonia Delaunay, he started his Dada periodical 391 (published by Galeries Dalmau), modeled on Stieglitz's own periodical. He continued the periodical with the help of Marcel Duchamp in the United States. In Zurich, seeking treatment for depression and suicidal impulses, he had met Tristan Tzara, whose radical ideas thrilled Picabia. Back in Paris, and now with his mistress Germaine Everling, he was in the city of \\"les assises dada\\" where Andr√© Breton, Paul √âluard, Philippe Soupault and Louis Aragon met at Certa, a Basque bar in the Passage de l'Opera. Picabia, the provocateur, was back home. Francis Picabia, R√©veil Matin (Alarm Clock), Dada 4-5, Number 5, 15May 1919 Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Z√ºrich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. (See Cannibale, 1921.) He denounced Dada in 1921, and issued a personal attack against Breton in the final issue of 391, in 1924. The same year, he put in an appearance in the Ren√© Clair surrealist film Entr'acte, firing a cannon from a rooftop. The film served as an intermission piece for Picabia's avant-garde ballet, Rel√¢che, premiered at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es, with music by Erik Satie. = Later years = In 1922, Andr√© Breton relaunched Litt√©rature magazine with cover images by Picabia, to whom he gave carte blanche for each issue. Picabia drew on religious imagery, erotic iconography, and the iconography of games of chance.Mark Polizzotti, Revolution of the Mind, (1995) pages 93-94, 160, 173, 196. In 1925, Picabia returned to figurative painting, and during the 1930s became a close friend of the modernist novelist Gertrude Stein. In the early 1940s he moved to the South of France, where his work took a surprising turn: he produced a series of paintings based on the nude glamour photos in French \\"girlie\\" magazines like Paris Sex-Appeal, in a garish style which appears to subvert traditional, academic nude painting. Some of these went to an Algerian merchant who sold them, and so it passed that Picabia came to decorate brothels across North Africa under the Occupation. Francis Picabia, Francis chante le Coq, 391, n. 14, Nov. 1920 Before the end of World War II, he returned to Paris where he resumed abstract painting and writing poetry. A large retrospective of his work was held at the Galerie Ren√© Drouin in Paris in the spring of 1949. Francis Picabia died in Paris in 1953 and was interred in the Cimeti√®re de Montmartre. = Legacy = Public collections holding works by Picabia include the Museum of Modern Art and Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the Art Institute of Chicago; the Tate Gallery, London; the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, Paris; and Museum de Fundatie, Zwolle, Netherlands.

Utah and Omaha are separated by the Douve River, whose mouth is clear in the coastline notch (or \\"corner\\") of the map. Sword, commonly known as Sword Beach, was the code name given to one of the five main landing areas along the Normandy coast during the initial assault phase, Operation Neptune, of Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of German-occupied France that commenced on 6 June 1944. Stretching from Ouistreham to Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, the beach was the easternmost landing site of the invasion. Taking Sword was to be the responsibility of the British Army with sea transport, mine sweeping, and a naval bombardment force provided by the British Royal Navy as well as elements from the Polish, Norwegian and other Allied navies. Among the five beaches of the operation, Sword is the nearest to Caen, being located around from the goal of the 3rd Infantry Division. The initial landings were achieved with low casualties, but the advance from the beach was slowed by traffic congestion and resistance in heavily defended areas behind the beachhead. Further progress towards Caen was halted by the only armoured counter-attack of the day, mounted by the 21st Panzer Division. Background Following the Fall of France, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to return to continental Europe and liberate the Nazi German-occupied nations.D'Este, p. 21 The Western Allies agreed to open a Second Front in northern Europe in 1942 to aid the Soviet Union. However, with resources for an invasion lacking, it was postponedBauer, 44 but planning was undertaken that in the event of the German position in western Europe becoming critically weakened or the Soviet Union's situation becoming dire, forces could be landed in France; Operation Sledgehammer. At the same time, planning was underway for a major landing in occupied France during 1943; Operation Roundup.Ellis, p. 7 In August 1942, Canadian and British forces attempted an abortive landing‚ÄîOperation Jubilee‚Äîat the Calais port-town of Dieppe; the landing was designed to test the feasibility of a cross-channel invasion. The attack was poorly planned and ended in disaster; 4,963 soldiers were killed, wounded or captured.Granatstein, p. 11 The decision to prosecute the Battle of the Atlantic to its closure, the lack of landing craft,Ellis, p. 9 invading Sicily in July 1943, and Italy in September following the defeat of Axis forces in North Africa in May 1943Granatstein, pp. 13‚Äì14 resulted in the postponement of any assault on northern Europe till 1944. Having succeeded in opening up an offensive front in southern Europe, gaining valuable experience in amphibious assaults and inland fighting, Allied planners returned to the plans to invade Northern France.Zuehlke, p. 25 Now scheduled for 5 June 1944,Ellis, p. 140 the beaches of Normandy were selected as landing sites, with a zone of operations extending from the Cotentin Peninsula to Caen. Operation Overlord called for the British Second Army to assault between the River Orne and Port en Bessin, capture the German-occupied city of Caen and form a front line from Caumont-l'√âvent√© to the south-east of Caen, in order to acquire airfields and protect the left flank of the United States First Army while it captured Cherbourg.Ellis, p. 78 Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture the city of Falaise, which could then be used as a pivot for an advance on Argentan, the Touques River and then towards the Seine River.Ellis, p. 81 Overlord would constitute the largest amphibious operation in military history.Granatstein, p. 18 After delays, due to both logistical difficulties and poor weather, the D-Day of Overlord was moved to 6 June 1944. Eisenhower and Bernard Montgomery, commander of 21st Army Group, aimed to capture Caen within the first day, and liberate Paris within 90 days. Plans =Allied= The coastline of Normandy was divided into seventeen sectors, with codenames using a spelling alphabet‚Äîfrom Able, west of Omaha, to Roger on the east flank of Sword. Eight further sectors were added when the invasion was extended to include Utah on the Cotentin Peninsula. Sectors were further subdivided into beaches identified by the colours Green, Red, and White. The Anglo-Canadian assault landings on D-Day were to be carried out by the British Second Army, under Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey. The Second Army's I Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General John Crocker, was assigned to take Sword. To Major General Tom Rennie's 3rd Infantry Division fell the task of assaulting the beaches and seizing the main British objective on D-Day, the historic Norman city of Caen.Williams, p. 24Wilmot, p. 273 Attached to the 3rd Infantry Division for the assault were the 27th Independent Armoured Brigade, the 1st Special Service Brigade (which also contained Free French Commandos), No. 41 (Royal Marine) Commando of the 4th Special Service Brigade, Royal Marine armoured support, additional artillery and engineers, and elements of the 79th Armoured Division.Ford, pp. 28‚Äì29, 42 6th Beach Group was deployed to assist the troops and landing craft landing on Sword and to develop the beach maintenance area. The 3rd Infantry Division was ordered to advance on Caen, from Sword,Ford, p. 17 with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division advancing on its western flank to secure Carpiquet airfield, from Juno Beach, on the outskirts of the city. The 3rd Infantry was also ordered to relieve the elements of the 6th Airborne Division that had secured the bridges over the River Orne and Caen Canal during Operation Tonga, secure the high ground north of Caen, and \\"if possible Caen itself\\".Scarfe, p. 18 The last point was further reinforced when I Corps' commander, General Crocker, instructed the division, prior to the invasion, that by nightfall the city must be either captured or \\"effectively masked\\" with troops based north-west of the city and B√©nouville.Wilmot, p. 274 Queen beach, dated 16 August 1943 Sword stretched about from Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer in the west to the mouth of the River Orne in the east. It was further sub- divided into four landing sectors; from west to east these sectors were 'Oboe' (from Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer to Luc-sur-Mer), 'Peter' (from Luc-sur-Mer to Lion- sur-Mer), 'Queen' (from Lion-sur-Mer to La Br√®che d'Hermanville), and finally 'Roger' (from La Br√®che d'Hermanville to Ouistreham). Each sector was also divided into multiple beaches.Ford, pp. 36-37, 40-41 The sector chosen for the assault was the wide 'White' and 'Red' beaches of 'Queen' sector, as shallow reefs blocked access to the other sectors.Ford, p. 37 Two infantry battalions supported by DD tanks would lead the assault followed up by the commandos and the rest of the division;Ford, pp. 37, 42 the landing was due to start at 07:25 hours;Ford, p. 47 the division would be the last assault division to land. =German= An example of German beach defences On 23 March 1942, F√ºhrer Directive Number 40 called for the official creation of the Atlantic Wall - a line of concrete gun emplacements, machine-gun nests, minefields and beach obstacles stretching along the French coast. Fortifications were initially concentrated around ports, but were extended into other areas beginning in late 1943.Kaufmann & Kaufmann, pp. 196‚Äì197 While the German Army had seen its strength and morale heavily depleted by campaigns in Russia, North Africa and Italy, it remained a powerful fighting force.Granatstein, p. 19 Most of the German divisions along the French coast in late 1943, however, were either formations of new recruits or battered veteran units still resting and rebuilding after service on the Eastern Front; altogether some 856,000 soldiers were stationed in France, predominantly along the Channel coast. They were supported by an additional 60,000 Hilfswillige (Russian and Polish conscripts to the German army).Wieviorka, p. 157 Under the command of Field Marshals Erwin Rommel and Gerd von Rundstedt, the defences of the Atlantic Wall were heavily upgraded; in the first six months of 1944, 1.2 million tons of steel and 17.3 million cubic yards of concrete were laid.Saunders, p. 35 The coast of northern France was also studded with four million antitank and anti-personnel mines, and 500,000 beach obstacles. On and behind Sword, twenty strongpoints, including several artillery batteries, were constructed. The coastline was littered with wooden stakes, mines, hedgehogs, and Dragon's teeth, while along the top of the beach, the Germans had constructed a network of trenches, gun pits, mortar pits, and machine gun nests. Barbed wire surrounded these positions and lined the beach.Ford, pp. 32, 49Notes on Operations of 21 Army Group, p. 3 The beachfront itself, being generally flat and exposed, was guarded by a few scattered bunkers, with machine gun and sniper posts in some of the holiday homes and tourist facilities lining the shore. To reinforce the defences, six strongpoints had been constructed, each with at least eight 5 cm Pak 38 50mm anti-tank guns, four 75mm guns, and one 88mm gun. One of the strongpoints (codenamed Cod by the British), faced directly on to Queen sector. Exits from the beaches had been blocked with various obstacles, and behind the beaches, six artillery batteries had been positioned, three of which were based within three strongpoints; these latter batteries had four 100 mm guns and up to ten 155mm guns. In addition, positioned east of the River Orne was the Merville Gun Battery, containing four Czechoslovakian 100 mm howitzers which were within range of Sword and the invasion fleet.Buckingham, p. 145Harclerode,p. 319 Between Cherbourg and the River Seine there were a total of 32 batteries capable of firing on to the five invasion beaches; half of them were positioned in casemates of reinforced concrete. German defence at Ouistreham; the turret is from a Renault FT-17 tank Since the spring of 1942, Generalleutnant Wilhelm Richter's 8,000-man strong 716th Infantry Division had been positioned to defend the Calvados coast of Normandy.Ford and Gerrard, p. 16. In March 1942, the 352nd Infantry Division assumed control of the western Calvados coast, leaving the 716th in position north of Caen covering an 8-mile (13 km) stretch of coastline. The division comprised four regular infantry battalions, two Ost battalions, and artillery units.Copp, p. 37 Four infantry companies were spread along Sword, with two positioned facing Queen sector - another four were positioned inland behind the beach. Further inland, Generalleutnant's Edgar Feuchtinger's 16,297 strong 21st Panzer Division had been positioned on both sides of the River Orne around Caen to provide an immediate counter-attack force should a landing take place.Beevor, p. 29Ford, p. 23D‚ÄôEste, p. 117 In May 1944, two Panzergrenadier battalions and an antitank battalion from the 21st Panzer Division were placed under Richter's command;Copp, p. 37 this deployment eliminated 21st Panzer as a mobile reserve. One of these battalions, along with the division's anti-tank guns and several mobile 155 mm guns, was positioned on P√©riers Ridge, which rose to about above sea level, south of Sword.Buckley, p. 20Ford, p. 65 Order of battle =3rd Division group= Film still from the D-Day landings showing commandos aboard a landing craft on their approach to Sword, 6 June 1944. 20px 3rd DivisionJoslen, pp. 584‚Äì5. ‚Äì Major-General T.

The figure in the foreground is Piper Bill Millin. The assault on Sword began at about 03:00 with the aerial and naval bombardment of German coastal defences and artillery sites. The landing was to be concentrated on Queen Red and Queen White in front of Hermanville-sur-Mer, other approaches having proven impassable due to shoals. At 07:25, the first units set off for the beach. These were the amphibious DD tanks of the 13th/18th Hussars; they were followed closely by the 8th Infantry Brigade, and by Royal Engineers in AVREs and the various odd-looking, specialized vehicles that had been nicknamed 'Hobart's funnies'. The engineers set to work clearing mines and obstacles under a steady hail of small arms fire and artillery fire from P√©riers Ridge just south of Hermanville.Thompson, p.133-139Ford and Gerrard, p. 13. Resistance on the beach was initially fairly strong, with wrecked vehicles piling up and casualties mounting; however, with most of their armoured vehicles successfully landed, the British were able to quickly secure the immediate area. By 09:30 the engineers had cleared seven of the eight exits from the beach, allowing the inland advance to begin.Thompson, p.139 British and French commandos encountered tough resistance in the seaside town of Ouistreham, on Sword's eastern extremity, but were able to clear it of enemy strongpoints. By 13:00, the 1st Special Service Brigade had reached the bridges on the River Orne and the Caen Canal, linking up with paratroops of the 6th Airborne Division, who were holding the bridges, after earlier disabling German gun batteries in a fierce night-time battle at Merville. On the western flank of Sword, commandos of the 4th Special Service Brigade moved out to secure Lion-sur-Mer and effect a link up with Canadian forces at Juno Beach, but encountered strong resistance and were pinned down by heavy fire for several hours. Meanwhile, around the main landing area, the men of the 3rd Infantry Division had secured Hermanville-sur-Mer by 10:00, but were finding tougher going as they slowly fought their way up P√©riers Ridge and moved inland. Congestion as more men, vehicles, and equipment arrived on the beach further complicated matters. It was gradually becoming apparent that the British would not be able to make the hook-up with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division necessary to protect its right flank in an immediate assault on Caen. Troops of the King's Shropshire Light Infantry continued down the Hermanville- Caen road, reaching Bi√©ville-Beuville, close to Caen, but were supported by only a few self-propelled guns, their flanks exposed. The issue was fully rendered moot when, on the afternoon of 6 June, the 21st Panzer Division, based around Caen, launched the only major German counterattack of D-Day.Thompson, p.139-140 =German counter-attacks= German prisoners being marched along Queen beach, Sword The 21st Panzer Division, with its formidable inventory of some 127 Panzer IV tanks,Mitcham, p. 18. was intended for use as a rapid response force; on the morning of 6 June, however, its commander, Generalmajor Edgar Feuchtinger, was in Paris, and Rommel was in Germany. The division was unable to finalize orders and preparations for a counterattack until late in the day. At about 17:00, two thrusts were launched, east and west of the River Orne. The eastern attack, carried out by II Battalion and supporting units, under Major Hans von Luck, was intended to destroy the 6th Airborne Division's Orne bridgehead, but was almost immediately stopped in its tracks by intense Allied air attacks and naval gunfire.Von Luck, p.178-9 To the west, a larger Armoured Group initially fared somewhat better. Taking advantage of the gap between the Sword and Juno sectors, elements of the 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment were able to reach the coast at Lion-sur-Mer by 8:00 p.m.; however, with few flak units and very little support from the Luftwaffe, they too suffered devastating losses to Allied aircraft. When 250 Gliders of the British 6th Airlanding Brigade overflew their positions, on their way to reinforce the Orne bridgehead in Operation Mallard, the Germans, believing they were about to be cut off, retired.Thompson, p.151 The Luftwaffe was particularly weak in this sector, but tried to support the attack with a few of the rare daylight appearances it made on D-Day. Generalfeldmarschall Hugo Sperrle, commanding Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet 3) was responsible for the air defense of Normandy and ordered all available forces to attack the beachhead. Junkers Ju 88s from Kampfgeschwader 54 (KG 54: Bomber Wing 54) attacked British positions with Butterfly Bombs. III./KG 54 struck Lion-sur-Mer while I./KG 54 bombed shipping at the mouth of the Orne. No. 145 Wing RAF intercepted and shot down five German aircraft.Weal 2000, pp. 81.de Zeng 2007, p. 183, 190. Aftermath =Analysis= The Panzer IV was the main battle tank of the German 21st Panzer Division. The division had 127 Panzer IVs on 6 June. By the end of D-Day, 28,845 men of I Corps had come ashore across Sword. The British Official Historian, L. F. Ellis, wrote that \\"in spite of the Atlantic Wall over 156,000 men had been landed in France on the first day of the campaign.\\" British losses in the Sword area amounted to 683 men.Ford, pp. 86, 112 The British and Canadians were able to link up and resume the drive on Caen the following day, but three days into the invasion, the advance was halted.Ford, p. 90, 96Keegan, p. 143. On 7 June, Operation Perch, a pincer attack by the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division and XXX Corps was launched to encircle Caen from the east and west flanks.Ellis, p. 250 The 21st Panzer Division halted the 51st Division advance and the XXX Corps attack resulted in the Battle of Villers-Bocage and the withdrawal of the leading elements of the 7th Armoured Division soon after.Van der Vat, p. 139Taylor, p. 76 The next offensive, codenamed Operation Epsom, was launched by VIII Corps on 26 June, to envelope Caen from the west.Clark, pp. 32‚Äì33Clark, pp. 31‚Äì32 German forces managed to contain the offensive but to do so, they were obliged to commit all their available strength.Hart, p. 108 On 27 June, the 3rd Infantry Division and its supporting tanks launched Operation Mitten. The objective was to seize two German-occupied ch√¢teaux, la Londe and le Landel. The initial evening assault was repulsed but the following morning, attacks gained the objectives and destroyed several German tanks. Operation Mitten cost at least three British tanks and 268 men.Fortin, p. 30Copp (2004), p. 113 In 2003 Copp wrote that fighting for these ch√¢teaux made the area the \\"bloodiest square mile in Normandy\\". Scarfe wrote in 1947 that, had the operation gone more smoothly, further elements of the division and elements of the 3rd Canadian Division would have launched Operation Aberlour, an ambitious plan to capture several villages north of Caen but the attack was cancelled by Lieutenant-General John Crocker.Scarfe, pp. 68‚Äì69 Several days later I Corps launched a new offensive, codenamed Operation Charnwood, to gain possession of Caen. In a frontal assault, the northern half of the city was captured,Williams, p. 131 but German forces retained possession of the city south of the River Orne. The southern half of Caen was only captured 12 days later by Canadian infantry during Operation Atlantic.Bercuson, p. 222Trew, p. 102 See also * List of ships in Sword Bombardment Group Notes ;Footnotes ;Citations References     * * Lt-Col H.F.

Nicknamed the Indy, it began as a broadsheet and changed to tabloid format in 2003. The last printed edition was published on Saturday 26 March 2016, leaving only the online edition. It tends to take a pro-market stance on economic issues. The newspaper was controlled by Tony O'Reilly's Irish Independent News & Media from 1997 until it was sold to the Russian businessman Alexander Lebedev in 2010. In 2017, a Saudi Arabian investor bought a 30% stake in it. In June 2015, the newspaper had an average daily circulation of just below 58,000, 85% down from its 1990 peak, while the Sunday edition had a circulation of just over 97,000.ABC circulation figures Press Gazette The daily edition was named National Newspaper of the Year at the 2004 British Press Awards. The website and mobile app have a combined monthly reach of 22,939,000. History =1986 to 1990= Launched in 1986, the first issue of The Independent was published on 7 October in broadsheet format.Dennis Griffiths (ed.) The Encyclopedia of the British Press, 1422‚Äì1992, London & Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1992, p. 330 It was produced by Newspaper Publishing plc and created by Andreas Whittam Smith, Stephen Glover and Matthew Symonds. All three partners were former journalists at The Daily Telegraph who had left the paper towards the end of Lord Hartwell's ownership. Marcus Sieff was the first chairman of Newspaper Publishing, and Whittam Smith took control of the paper. The paper was created at a time of a fundamental change in British newspaper publishing. Rupert Murdoch was challenging long-accepted practices of the print unions and ultimately defeated them in the Wapping dispute. Consequently, production costs could be reduced which, it was said at the time, created openings for more competition. As a result of controversy around Murdoch's move to Wapping, the plant was effectively having to function under siege from sacked print workers picketing outside. The Independent attracted some of the staff from the two Murdoch broadsheets who had chosen not to move to his company's new headquarters. Launched with the advertising slogan \\"It is. Are you?\\", and challenging both The Guardian for centre-left readers and The Times as the newspaper of record, The Independent reached a circulation of over 400,000 by 1989. Competing in a moribund market, The Independent sparked a general freshening of newspaper design as well as, within a few years, a price war in the market sector. When The Independent launched The Independent on Sunday in 1990, sales were less than anticipated, partly due to the launch of the Sunday Correspondent four months prior, although this direct rival closed at the end of November 1990. Some aspects of production merged with the main paper, although the Sunday paper retained a largely distinct editorial staff. =1990‚Äì1999 = In the 1990s, The Independent was faced with price cutting by the Murdoch titles, and started an advertising campaign accusing The Times and The Daily Telegraph of reflecting the views of their proprietors, Rupert Murdoch and Conrad Black. It featured spoofs of the other papers' mastheads with the words The Rupert Murdoch or The Conrad Black, with The Independent below the main title. had financial problems. A number of other media companies were interested in the paper. Tony O'Reilly's media group and Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) had bought a stake of about a third each by mid-1994. In March 1995, Newspaper Publishing was restructured with a rights issue, splitting the shareholding into O'Reilly's Independent News & Media (43%), MGN (43%), and Prisa (publisher of El Pa√≠s) (12%). In April 1996, there was another refinancing, and in March 1998, O'Reilly bought the other shares of the company for ¬£30 million, and assumed the company's debt. Brendan Hopkins headed Independent News, Andrew Marr was appointed editor of The Independent, and Rosie Boycott became editor of The Independent on Sunday. Marr introduced a dramatic if short-lived redesign which won critical favour but was a commercial failure, partly as a result of a limited promotional budget. Marr admitted his changes had been a mistake in his book, My Trade. Boycott left in April 1998 to join the Daily Express, and Marr left in May 1998, later becoming the BBC's political editor. Simon Kelner was appointed as the editor. By this time the circulation had fallen below 200,000. Independent News spent heavily to increase circulation, and the paper went through several redesigns. While circulation increased, it did not approach the level which had been achieved in 1989, or restore profitability. Job cuts and financial controls reduced the morale of journalists and the quality of the product. =2000‚Äì2009 = Ivan Fallon, on the board since 1995 and formerly a key figure at The Sunday Times, replaced Hopkins as head of Independent News & Media in July 2002. By mid-2004, the newspaper was losing ¬£5 million per year. A gradual improvement meant that by 2006, circulation was at a nine-year high. In November 2008, following further staff cuts, production was moved to Northcliffe House, in Kensington High Street, the headquarters of Associated Newspapers. The two newspaper groups' editorial, management and commercial operations remained separate, but they shared services including security, information technology, switchboard and payroll. =2010‚Äì2016 = On 25 March 2010, Independent News & Media sold the newspaper to a new company owned by the family of Russian oligarch Alexander Lebedev for a nominal ¬£1 fee and ¬£9.25m over the next 10 months, choosing this option over closing The Independent and The Independent on Sunday, which would have cost ¬£28m and ¬£40m respectively, due to long-term contracts. Alexander's son Evgeny became Chairman of the new company, with Alexander becoming a board director. In 2009, Lebedev had bought a controlling stake in the London Evening Standard. Two weeks later, editor Roger Alton resigned.Ponsford, Dominic (9 April 2010) \\"Roger Alton steps down as Independent editor\\", Press Gazette (London). In July 2011, The Independents columnist Johann Hari was stripped of the Orwell Prize he had won in 2008 after claims, to which Hari later admitted, of plagiarism and inaccuracy. In January 2012, Chris Blackhurst, editor of The Independent, told the Leveson inquiry that the scandal had \\"severely damaged\\" the newspaper's reputation. He nevertheless told the inquiry that Hari would return as a columnist in \\"four to five weeks\\". Hari later announced that he would not return to The Independent. Jonathan Foreman contrasted The Independents reaction to the scandal unfavourably with the reaction of American newspapers to similar incidents such as the Jayson Blair case, which led to resignations of editors, \\"deep soul-searching\\", and \\"new standards of exactitude being imposed\\". The historian Guy Walters suggested that Hari's fabrications had been an open secret amongst the newspaper's staff and that their internal inquiry was a \\"facesaving exercise\\". A proportion of articles are now behind a pay wall, that section is titled, 'Independent Minds'. The Independent and The Independent on Sunday endorsed \\"Remain\\" in the Brexit referendum of 2016. = From 2016 = In March 2016 The Independent decided to close its print edition and become an online newspaper; the last printed edition was published on Saturday 26 March 2016. The Independent on Sunday published its last print edition on 20 March 2016 and was closed following that. Content =Format and design= The Independent began publishing as a broadsheet, in a series of celebrated designs. The final version was designed by Carroll, Dempsey and Thirkell following a commission by Nicholas Garland who, along with Alexander Chancellor, was unhappy with designs produced by Raymond Hawkey and Michael McGuiness ‚Äì on seeing the proposed designs, Chancellor had said \\"I thought we were joining a serious paper\\". The first edition was designed and implemented by Michael Crozier, who was Executive Editor, Design and Picture, from pre-launch in 1986 to 1994. From September 2003, the paper was produced in both broadsheet and tabloid-sized versions, with the same content in each. The tabloid edition was termed \\"compact\\" to distance itself from the more sensationalist reporting style usually associated with \\"tabloid\\" newspapers in the UK. After launching in the London area and then in North West England, the smaller format appeared gradually throughout the UK. Soon afterwards, Rupert Murdoch's Times followed suit, introducing its own tabloid-sized version. Prior to these changes, The Independent had a daily circulation of around 217,500, the lowest of any major national British daily, a figure that climbed by 15% as of March 2004 (to 250,000). Throughout much of 2006, circulation stagnated at a quarter of a million. On 14 May 2004, The Independent produced its last weekday broadsheet, having stopped producing a Saturday broadsheet edition in January. The Independent on Sunday published its last simultaneous broadsheet on 9 October 2005, and thereafter followed a compact design until the print edition was discontinued. On 12 April 2005, The Independent redesigned its layout to a more European feel, similar to France's Lib√©ration. The redesign was carried out by a Barcelona-based design studio. The weekday second section was subsumed within the main paper, double-page feature articles became common in the main news sections, and there were revisions to the front and back covers. A new second section, \\"Extra\\", was introduced on 25 April 2006. It is similar to The Guardians \\"G2\\" and The Timess \\"Times2\\", containing features, reportage and games, including sudoku. In June 2007, The Independent on Sunday consolidated its content into a news section which included sports and business, and a magazine focusing on life and culture. On 23 September 2008, the main newspaper became full-colour, and \\"Extra\\" was replaced by an \\"Independent Life Supplement\\" focusing on different themes each day. Three weeks after the acquisition of the paper by Alexander Lebedev and Evgeny Lebedev in 2010, the paper was relaunched with another redesign on 20 April. The new format featured smaller headlines and a new pullout \\"Viewspaper\\" section, which contained the paper's comment and feature articles. From 26 October 2010, the same day as its sister paper, i, was launched, The Independent was printed on slightly thicker paper than before and ceased to be full-colour throughout, with many photographs and pictures (though none of those used in adverts) being printed in black and white only. On 11 October 2011, The Independent unveiled yet another new look, featuring a red, sans- serif masthead. In November 2013, the whole newspaper was overhauled again, including new custom fonts and a vertical masthead in black. =Front pages= Following the 2003 switch in format, The Independent became known for its unorthodox and campaigning front pages, which frequently relied on images, graphics or lists rather than traditional headlines and written news content. For example, following the Kashmir earthquake in 2005, it used its front page to urge its readers to donate to its appeal fund, and following the publication of the Hutton Report into the death of British government scientist David Kelly, its front page simply carried the word \\"Whitewash?\\" In 2003, the paper's editor, Simon Kelner, was named \\"Editor of the Year\\" at the What the Papers Say awards, partly in recognition of, according to the judges, his \\"often arresting and imaginative front-page designs\\". In 2008, however, as he was stepping down as editor, he stated that it was possible to \\"overdo the formula\\" and that the style of the paper's front pages perhaps needed \\"reinvention\\". Under the subsequent editorship of Chris Blackhurst, the campaigning, poster-style front pages were scaled back in favour of more conventional news stories. =Sections= The weekday, Saturday and Sunday editions of The Independent all included supplements and pull-out subsections: { - valign=top width=50% Daily (Monday to Friday) The Independent: *\\"Monday Sport\\": A weekly pull-out containing reports of the previous weekend's sporting events. Saturday's The Independent: *\\"Saturday Sport\\": A weekly pull-out containing reports looking ahead to the weekend's sporting events. *\\"Radar\\": A compact, primarily listings magazine, including television schedules, film and DVD reviews and events listings for the coming week. It also includes a round-up of the \\"50 best\\" items in a particular category. For example, over the Christmas period there are weekly supplements of \\"Gifts for him\\" and \\"Gifts for her\\". *\\"Traveller\\": Contains travel articles and advertisements. *\\"The Independent Magazine\\": A features magazine including sections on food, interiors and fashion. width=50% The Independent on Sunday: *\\"Sport\\": A weekly pull-out containing reports of Saturday's sporting events. *\\"The New Review\\": A features magazine. *\\"Arts & Books\\": A culture supplement. *\\"Rainbow List\\" An annually-updated list, first published in 2000, then as the \\"Pink List\\", of the most famous and influential people who have declared themselves lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. } =Online presence= On 23 January 2008, The Independent relaunched its online edition, www.independent.co.uk.\\"Welcome to The Independent's new website\\". The Independent (web only). 23 January 2008. The relaunched site introduced a new look, better access to the blog service, priority on image and video content, and additional areas of the site including art, architecture, fashion, gadgets and health. The paper launched podcast programmes such as \\"The Independent Music Radio Show\\", \\"The Independent Travel Guides\\", \\"The Independent Sailing Podcasts\\", and \\"The Independent Video Travel Guides\\". Since 2009, the website has carried short video news bulletins provided by the Al Jazeera English news channel. In 2014, The Independent launched a sister website, i100, a \\"shareable\\" journalism site with similarities to Reddit and Upworthy. Political views When the paper was established in 1986, the founders intended its political stance to reflect the centre of the British political spectrum and thought that it would attract readers primarily from The Times and The Daily Telegraph. It has been seen as leaning to the left wing of the political spectrum, making it more a competitor to The Guardian. However, The Independent tends to take a liberal, pro-market stance on economic issues. The Independent on Sunday referred to itself as a \\"proudly liberal newspaper\\". The paper took a strong editorial position against the 2003 invasion of Iraq and aspects of US and UK foreign policy related to the War on Terrorism following the . In addition, The Independent has highlighted what it refers to as war crimes being committed by pro-government forces in the Darfur region of Sudan. The paper has been a strong supporter of electoral reform. The paper has also taken strong positions on environmental issues, campaigned against the introduction of ID cards, and campaigned against the restriction of mass immigration to the UK. In 1997, The Independent on Sunday launched a campaign for the decriminalisation of cannabis. Ten years later, it reversed itself, arguing that skunk, the cannabis strain \\"smoked by the majority of young Britons\\" in 2007, had become \\"25 times stronger than resin sold a decade ago\\". The paper supports the United Kingdom becoming a republic. Originally, it avoided royal stories, Whittam Smith later saying he thought the British press was \\"unduly besotted\\" with the Royal Family and that a newspaper could \\"manage without\\" stories about the monarchy. In 2007, Alan Rusbridger, editor of The Guardian, said of The Independent: \\"The emphasis on views, not news, means that the reporting is rather thin, and it loses impact on the front page the more you do that\\". In a 12 June 2007 speech, British Prime Minister Tony Blair called The Independent a \\"viewspaper\\", saying it \\"was started as an antidote to the idea of journalism as views not news. That was why it was called the Independent. Today it is avowedly a viewspaper not merely a newspaper\\". The Independent criticised Blair's comments the following dayGrice, Andrew (13 June 2007). \\"Blair's attack provokes anger among newspaper editors and broadcasters\\". The Independent (London). Retrieved 9 December 2009. but later changed format to include a \\"Viewspaper\\" insert in the centre of the regular newspaper, designed to feature most of the opinion columns and arts reviews. A leader published on the day of the 2008 London mayoral election compared the candidates and said that, if the newspaper had a vote, it would vote first for the Green Party candidate, Sian Berry, noting the similarity between her priorities and those of The Independent, and secondly, with \\"rather heavy heart\\", for the incumbent, Ken Livingstone. An Ipsos MORI poll estimated that in the 2010 general election, 44% of regular readers voted Liberal Democrat, 32% voted Labour, and 14% voted Conservative, compared to 23%, 29%, and 36%, respectively, of the overall electorate. On the eve of the 2010 general election, The Independent supported the Liberal Democrats, arguing that \\"they are longstanding and convincing champions of civil liberties, sound economics, international co-operation on the great global challenges and, of course, fundamental electoral reform. These are all principles that this newspaper has long held dear. That is why we argue that there is a strong case for progressively minded voters to lend their support to the Liberal Democrats wherever there is a clear opportunity for that party to win\\". However, before the 2015 general election The Independent on Sunday desisted from advising its readers how to vote, writing that \\"this does not mean that we are a bloodless, value-free news-sheet. We have always been committed to social justice\\", but the paper recognised that it was up the readers to \\"make up [their] own mind about whether you agree with us or not\\". Rather than support a particular party, the paper urged all its reader to vote as \\"a responsibility of common citizenship\\". On 4 May 2015, the weekday version of The Independent said that a continuation of the Conservative‚ÄìLiberal Democrat coalition after the general election would be a positive outcome. At the end of July 2018 The Independent led a campaign they called the \\"Final Say\\" ‚Äì a change.org petition by editor Christian Broughton, for a binding referendum on the Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union. As of 2019, Independent in Arabic is owned and managed by Saudi Research and Marketing Group (SRMG), a major publishing organisation with close ties to the Saudi royal family.

Junot embarks for France, after the Convention of Cintra, at Cais do Sodr√©, Lisbon The Convention of Cintra (or Sintra) was an agreement signed on 30 August 1808, during the Peninsular War. By the agreement, the defeated French were allowed to evacuate their troops from Portugal without further conflict. The Convention was signed at the Palace of Queluz, in Queluz, Cintra, Estremadura. The French forces under Jean-Andoche Junot were defeated by the Anglo- Portuguese forces commanded by Sir Arthur Wellesley at Vimeiro on 21 August and found themselves almost cut off from retreat. However, at that moment, Wellesley was superseded by the arrival of Sir Harry Burrard and then the next day by Sir Hew Dalrymple. Both were cautious old men who had seen little recent fighting; rather than push the French, they were satisfied to open negotiations. Wellesley had sought to take control of the Torres Vedras area high ground and cut the French retreat with his unused reserve, but he was ordered to hold. Talks between Dalrymple and Fran√ßois Kellerman led to the signing of the Convention. Dalrymple allowed terms for Portugal similar to those a garrison might receive for surrendering a fortress. The 20,900 French soldiers were evacuated from Portugal with all their equipment and 'personal property' (which may have included looted Portuguese valuables) by the British Navy. They were transported to Rochefort, France. Junot arrived there on 11 October. Avoiding all Spanish entanglements and getting free transport meant the French travelled loaded, not light like a defeated garrison marching to their own lines. The Convention was seen as a disgrace by many in the United Kingdom who felt that a complete defeat of Junot had been transformed into a French escape, while Dalrymple had also ignored the Royal Navy's concern about a blockaded Russian squadron in Lisbon. The squadron was allowed to sail to Portsmouth, and eventually to return to Russia, despite the fact that Britain and Russia were at war. Wellesley wanted to fight, but he signed the preliminary Armistice under orders. He took no part in negotiating the Convention and did not sign it. Dalrymple's reports were written, however, to centre any criticism on Wellesley, who still held a ministerial post in the government. Wellesley was subsequently recalled from Portugal, together with Burrard and Dalrymple, to face an official inquiry. The inquiry was held in the Great Hall at the Royal Hospital Chelsea from 14 November to 27 December 1808. All three men were cleared; but while Wellesley soon returned to active duty in Portugal, Burrard and Dalrymple were quietly pushed into retirement and never saw active service again. Sir John Moore, commenting on the Inquiry, expressed the popular sentiment that \\"Sir Hew Dalrymple was confused and incapable beyond any man I ever saw head an army. The whole of his conduct then and since has proved him to be a very foolish man.\\" Lord Byron laments the Convention in his Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: > And ever since that martial synod met, > Britannia sickens, Cintra! at thy name; > And folks in office at the mention fret, > And fain would blush, if blush they could, for shame. > How will posterity the deed proclaim! > Will not our own and fellow-nations sneer, > To view these champions cheated of their fame, > By foes in fight o'erthrown, yet victors here, > Where Scorn her finger points, through many a coming year? > The Convention of Cintra is also the name of a pamphlet written by the future British Poet Laureate William Wordsworth in 1808; he also wrote a passionate sonnet that, in his own words, was \\"composed while the author was engaged in writing a tract occasioned by\\" the Convention, in which he laments the bondage felt by \\"suffering Spain\\".

It is a National Nature Reserve, a Ramsar internationally important wetland site, a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I, and part of the Waveney and Little Ouse Valley Fens Special Area of Conservation. It is managed by the Suffolk Wildlife Trust. It is the largest remaining area of river valley fen in England and consists of a number of different fen types, including saw-sedge beds, as well as having areas of open water, heathland, scrub and woodland. It is also one of only three sites in the UK where the fen raft spider Dolomedes plantarius is known to be found. Ecology The habitats present at Redgrave and Lopham are characteristic of areas of valley mire. This ecosystem creates a zonation of vegetation types, producing a diverse range of habitat. Dry marginal woodland becomes fen grassland, dominated by purple moor-grass, which grades into mixed fenland of reed and sedge beds. This grassland is particularly notable at Redgrave and Lopham for its areas of saw sedge Cladium mariscus. Into these areas of fenland protrude sandy ridges covered in heath vegetation. Without management these communities become invaded by sallow and develop into scrubland. To maintain site diversity, this has been allowed to occur in some areas of the Fen. Cladium mariscus These habitats maintain a community of plants and animals, with the site being particularly known for its diversity of invertebrate species. Surveys have identified nineteen species of dragonfly and 27 species of butterfly at the Fen, which has also long been recognised for its nationally important population of the fen raft spider Dolomedes plantarius. Further surveys have also found 26 species of mammals, including otter, pipistrelle bats and introduced species such as the Chinese water deer. The site has also recorded 4 species of amphibian and 4 species of reptile and a 2006 survey recorded 96 species of bird visiting the Fen. Management To maintain and improve the diversity of species and quality of habitat at the site continual management is required. Suffolk Wildlife Trust employs a Site Manager and Assistant Warden to run and monitor the site but also relies on volunteers to carry out management work. Such work includes rush mowing, sedge harvesting, scrub clearance, coppicing and fence construction. The site has also introduced a successful grazing regime to reduce the cost incurred from mowing such a large area of fen. It actively manages the fen raft spider population. =Grazing= Koniks grazing wet grassland at Fen. The site uses sheep, cattle and ponies as part of its management strategy. This has visibly benefited the fen structure and means only the larger saw sedge beds are now on a manual cutting rotation. The use of grazing has led to the emergence of a greater mosaic of vegetation and habitat types within the Fen and has inhibited the expansion of scrub. Hebridean sheep owned by the Trust and beef cattle from local farms graze on the dryer areas of scrub, heath and fen margins and help prevent the expansion of scrub. In 1995 the reserve introduced a herd of Polish Konik ponies to graze the wetter areas of the fen. They were chosen over native breeds for their hardiness and ability to graze in very wet conditions. The success of the Konik ponies has led to their use for grazing in other nature reserves in the UK and on the Broads. The cattle and Konik are usually kept on the fen between April and December which avoids the wettest and most barren months of the year. =Fen raft spider= A female Fen raft spider at Redgrave and Lopham Fens Redgrave and Lopham Fens was the first site in the UK at which a population of the fen raft spider (Dolomedes plantarius) was recorded. Following their discovery in 1956 a number of new pools were dug to encourage population expansion. However, water extraction from the borehole and a series of droughts in the 1980s reduced the population to only two isolated areas on the reserve. Throughout this period irrigation of the pools inhabited by the spider enabled the continuation of the population. The removal of the borehole in 1999 was expected to trigger an increase in population as water levels returned to normal. However, a study carried out in 2006 showed that no noticeable change had occurred. The population of the fen raft spider remains small and restricted in distribution. Recommendations for future management of the population include increasing the depths of turf pool, creating more pool habitats and greater, more focused use of water management in the reserve. The visitor centre and picnic area at Redgrave and Lopham Fens Access and facilities The reserve is open to the public all year round. It has an Education Centre which it uses to host family activity days, school trips and adult education courses. There is a picnic area and toilet facilities. It has three dedicated nature trails of 2, 3 and 4.5 km lengths, some of which are accessible by wheelchair. . . History =Pre-1959= Redgrave and Lopham Fens lies at the headwaters of the Waveney and Little Ouse rivers and had for centuries provided natural resources for the local population. This activity created and maintained the various habitats of the Fen. The cutting of peat for fuel lead to the creation of open pools edged in reedbeds and the pathways between them became species-rich fen meadows. Sedge and reed were cut for thatching, furze and other vegetation was removed for livestock bedding and firewood. Cattle and other livestock were also grazed on the meadow, heath and other marginal land around the fens. This removed any invading species, prevented ecological succession from occurring and preserved the diversity of the fenland. However, with the industrialisation of farming and the wider use of fossil fuels the traditional use and management of the Fen began to decline. In 1954 Redgrave and Lopham Fens was given the status as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to the nationally important presence of the fen raft spider and the diversity of its fenland. =1959-1991= In 1959 a borehole was drilled at the Fen to provide drinking water for the local population, with a capacity to take 3,600m¬≥ of water every day from the underlying aquifer. This diverted water from the springs that fed the fen and the water table began to fall. This led to a change in the Fen‚Äôs hydrology in the early 1960s as it went from a year-round water supply to alternating summer drought and winter floods. With a net loss of water this caused the fen to begin to dry out. The Waveney Trail. A raised footpath that separates areas of fenland within the reserve. The loss of water and lack of management led to the degradation of the fen, and scrub began to invade large areas. In 1961 the Suffolk Wildlife Trust gained control of the site but insufficient resources meant the large scale work they wished to carry out to return it to its previous state could not be achieved; the condition of the overall Fen continued to decline. =1991-present= In the early 1990s Redgrave and Lopham Fens gained wider recognition for its importance. Thus it was designated a RAMSAR site in 1991 and gained National Nature Reserve status in 1993. At this time the Environment Agency undertook studies to determine the extent of damage to the Fen and how restoration could best be carried out. This led to a large scale and internationally recognised restoration project, costing approximately ¬£3.4 million. Restoration project The restoration of the reserve was split into three key areas: the relocation of the borehole, the restoration of the river and the restoration of the fen, with a budget of ¬£2.2 million, ¬£0.4 million and ¬£0.8 million respectively. The European Commission funded 50% of this cost from the LIFE Fund. =Borehole relocation= In order to re-establish the original Fen water regime it was recommended that the borehole removing water from the system be relocated and that the new borehole provide sufficient water without damaging the fenland. To fit these requirements a large search for a suitable site was carried out with many test sites drilled and tested. Eventually a site was located 3 km southeast of the reserve and planning and construction of the new borehole was carried out at a cost of ¬£1.2 million. This was the first time a public water borehole was relocated on solely environmental grounds. The onsite borehole was shut down in July 1999 and within one month significant increases in water levels were recorded. By summer 2002 the maximum groundwater recharge level was believed to have been reached and the hydrological recovery closely followed modeling predictions. This return to natural levels of water supply has helped solve many ecological problems, with peat soils and reed beds now having sufficient water throughout the year. The many old peat cuttings have also filled with water, creating small pools filled with vegetation at various stages of succession throughout the reserve. =River restoration= The reserve is divided by the River Waveney and the river can have a great impact on the fen ecology if mismanaged. The restoration project aimed to raise the water level within the river, restore the river ecology to its previous state and improve its habitats. To achieve this two fully adjustable sluice gates were introduced to the river course. These would allow direct control of water levels within the Fen and protect the site from flooding or drought events. The banks of the river were also reworked to create greater areas of marginal habitat and the shallow bank shelves that are of interest to wildlife such as water voles. The material removed from the bank was reformed to create flood defense levees alongside the river. Restored Phragmites reed bed and pond =Fen restoration= The third stage of the project was to recreate the conditions that would allow the most important fen communities to become re- established. This would involve a number of different tasks but mainly focused on scrub and tree clearance and peat stripping operations. Around 80 hectares of wood and scrub were identified for clearance, all of which has now been removed and has opened up land to be reclaimed by the fen habitat. Due to the lack of water over the years large areas of peat had degraded. To restore the Fen to its previous state the decision was made to strip off the peat down to a level where it was undamaged and allow natural growth from that point. By 2002 around 250,000 tonnes of peat had been removed and a number of large pools surrounded by reed bed were created. Eventually the annual growth and dieback of the fen vegetation will restart the process of forming new peat.

It is on the Norfolk coast between Burnham Overy Staithe and Blakeney, and is managed by Natural England with the cooperation of the Holkham Estate. Its comprise a wide range of habitats, including grazing marsh, woodland, salt marsh, sand dunes and foreshore. The reserve is part of the North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest, and the larger area is additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar listings, and is part of both an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and a World Biosphere Reserve. Holkham NNR is important for its wintering wildfowl, especially pink-footed geese, Eurasian wigeon and brant geese, but it also has breeding waders, and attracts many migrating birds in autumn. A number of scarce invertebrates and plants can be found in the dunes, and the reserve is one of the only two sites in the UK to have an antlion colony. This stretch of coast originally consisted of salt marshes protected from the sea by ridges of shingle and sand, and Holkham's Iron Age fort stood at the end of a sandy spit surrounded by the tidal wetland. The Vikings navigated the creeks to establish Holkham village, but access to the former harbour was stopped by drainage and reclamation of the marshes between the coast and the shingle ridge which started in the 17th century, and was completed in 1859. The Holkham estate has been owned by the Coke family, later Earls of Leicester since 1609, and their seat at Holkham Hall is opposite the reserve's Lady Anne's Drive entrance. The 3rd Earl planted pines on the dunes to protect the pastures reclaimed by his predecessors from wind-blown sand. The national nature reserve was created in 1967 from of the Holkham Estate and of foreshore belonging to the Crown. The reserve has over 100,000 visitors a year, including birdwatchers and horse riders, and is therefore significant for the local economy. The NNR has taken steps to control entry to the fragile dunes and other areas important for their animals or plants because of the damage to sensitive habitats that could be caused by unrestricted access. The dunes are an essential natural defence against the projected rises in sea level along this vulnerable coast.

Retrieved 3 September 2012. There is a car park near Holkham village at the north end of Lady Anne's Drive that gives access to two bird hides, and another parking area at the end of Beach Road in Wells. To the east of the Wells channel, the reserve is mainly salt marshes and mud flats, and is difficult and potentially dangerous to access, although a public footpath runs along the southern edge of these tidal areas. Retrieved 3 September 2012. The salt marshes on this coast are stated in the Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) notification document to be \\"among the best in Europe ... the flora is exceptionally diverse\\". Holkham also has good examples of sand dunes, and the pines planted on the dunes have provided shelter for other trees and shrubs to become established, making this the only substantial area of woodland in the North Norfolk Coast SSSI. The dunes are created and altered by the elements, and the sand islands in Holkham Bay have formed only within the last 60 years. The flat ground inland from the dunes is reclaimed salt marsh that was used as pasture until the 1940s, but converted to arable land during World War II. The value of the fields to wildlife was reduced by the resulting lower water table, but Natural England's management measures have raised the water levels, attracting breeding and wintering birds. Water management can also be used to ensure a high water table in summer, benefiting breeding waders, and drier conditions in winter, preferred by the geese. The management of water levels and grassland increased the numbers of breeding wetland birds from 120 pairs of ten species in 1986 to 795 pairs of 26 species in 1994, and the number of wintering birds of four key wildfowl species rose from 1,215 to 17,305 in the decade from 1983/84.  History  left Norfolk has a long history of human occupation. Both modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago, before the last glaciation, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the then prevailing very cold conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic (10,000‚Äì5,000 BCE), the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as Doggerland. Retrieved 18 September 2012.Robertson et al.

A large Iron Age fort (Holkham Camp) at the end of a sandy spit in the marshes could only be approached along the spit; it enclosed and remained in use until the defeat of the Iceni in 47 AD.

Retrieved 2 September 2012. Until the 17th century, ships could navigate the tidal creeks to reach the staithe (harbour) at Holkham village, but local landowners began to reclaim the marshes from 1639, and the final embankment at Wells was constructed by the 2nd Earl in 1859, completing the conversion of about to farmland. The 3rd Earl planted Corsican, maritime and Scots pines on the dunes in the late 19th century to shelter the agricultural land from wind-blown sand, which is carried inland when the wind speed exceeds three metres (10 ft) per second and blows from directions between northwest to northeast. The Holkham National Nature Reserve was created in 1967 from of the Holkham Estate and of intertidal sand and mud flats belonging to the Crown Estate.Allen & Pye (1992) p. 148.

Flora and fauna  = Birds = Pink-footed geese leaving the grazing marshes at dawnthumb As many as 50,000 pink- footed geese, 13,000 Eurasian wigeon and 7,000 brent geese winter at Holkham, making it of international importance for these species. Up to 400 white- fronted geese and a few tundra bean geese may join the wildfowl flocks, and the odd peregrine falcon, short-eared owl, merlin, marsh harrier or hen harrier may hunt over the fields. The shingle banks and foreshore hold wintering flocks of shore larks, snow buntings and twite, and waders like knots, curlews, dunlins and grey plover probe for invertebrates in the mud flats. Spring migration is relatively quiet, although sightings of ring ouzel and firecrest are possible amongst the more common arrivals. Breeding birds include lapwings, common snipe, pied avocets, common redshanks and marsh harriers on the grazing marshes, ringed plovers and little terns on the beach, and black-headed, herring and lesser black-backed gulls on the salt marsh.

On exposed parts of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no vegetation except possibly algae or eelgrass, but where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marsh contains glassworts and annual seablite in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh here, although they are uncommon in the UK away from the Norfolk coast. Grasses such as sea couch grass and sea poa grass are important in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand.

A 2005 survey at Holkham and five other North Norfolk coastal sites found that 39 per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit. The 7.7 million day visitors and 5.5 million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent ¬£122 million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs. Holkham NNR is one of three sites within the SSSI that attract 100,000 or more visitors annually, the others being Titchwell Marsh and Cley Marshes. The large number of visitors at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as Ringed Plovers and Little Terns, and also for wintering geese. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle.Liley (2008) pp. 10‚Äì14.

The dune vegetation can be damaged by too many people walking over it, leading to blowout, the rapid wind erosion of the sand. Boardwalks and steps enable visitors to reach the beach on foot without harming the dunes, and horse riders and naturists are asked to stay on the beach and keep off the dunes.

As the climate becomes warmer in the future, there is likely to be more tourism pressure on the coasts, but the effects of this may be mitigated by a move towards lower- impact activities like bathing. The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divide the coast and its hinterland into three zones for tourism development purposes. Holkham dunes, along with Holme Dunes and Blakeney Point, were considered to be sensitive habitats already suffering from visitor pressure, and were designated as red-zone areas with no development or parking improvements to be recommended. The rest of the NNR is placed in the orange zone, for locations with fragile habitats but less tourism pressure.Scott Wilson Ltd (2006) pp. 5‚Äì6.  Threats  Vegetated dunes along the coast protect the reserve from flooding. The underlying geology of the North Norfolk coast is Cretaceous chalk, exposed at Hunstanton cliffs just to the west of the SSSI, but buried by soft Quaternary glacial debris for the entire length of the SSSI coast.Robertson et al.

However, this coastline is threatened by climate change, with sea level rising an estimated 1‚Äì2 mm per year for the last 100 years, increasing the risk of flooding and coastal erosion.East Anglia Coastal Group (2010) pp. 32‚Äì33. Half the area of the salt marshes that formed in the lee of Scolt Head Island has been reclaimed in the last 300 years, creating ecologically important, but very fragile, grazing marshes. Although Holkham is low-lying and can flood in severe weather conditions, it is protected by the spit that developed at the Holkham Gap in the 1990s and the dunes along the coast, which are increasingly being stabilised by vegetation.East Anglia Coastal Group (2010) pp. 15‚Äì18. The Environment Agency's management plan until 2105 is to rely on the natural protection of the dunes, intervening only if work is necessary to maintain their effectiveness in the face of a potential sea level rise of 1.1 m (3 ft) by that date.East Anglia Coastal Group (2010) p. 80. The shingle that makes up Scolt Head Island is moving westwards and southwards at up to 3.5 m (10 ft) per year. This may affect the movement of sediment, and lead to some erosion of the dunes and beaches at Holkham, but should not destroy their effectiveness as a sea defence unless the island reattaches to the mainland at some date in the distant future.

History Trust Sign in Ireland Wood The charity was founded in Devon, England in 1972 by retired farmer and agricultural machinery dealer Kenneth Watkins. The Trust's first purchase was part of the Avon Valley Woods, near Kingsbridge, Devon. By 1977 it had twenty two woods in six counties. In 1978 it relocated to Grantham in Lincolnshire and announced an expansion of its activities across the UK. In 1984, Balmacaan Wood next to Loch Ness became the Trust's first Scottish acquisition. It has supported the National Tree Week scheme, which takes place in late November and is run by The Tree Council. From 2005 to 2008 it co-operated with the BBC for their Springwatch programme and the BBC's Breathing Places series of events held at woods. It continues to work with Springwatch and Autumnwatch most recently in 2015 as part of the Big Spring Watch, which encouraged viewers to record the signs of nature (Phenology) through the Trust's Nature's Calendar project. = Sites = * It now has over 80 woods in Scotland, covering . * In Wales, it acquired the Coed Lletywalter in Snowdonia National Park in 1980.

By comparison, other viruses, such as smallpox and vaccinia, are around ten times larger at about 300 nanometers, while flu viruses are around 80‚Äì120 nm.  History  In 1953, when a cluster of nurses developed a mild respiratory illness, Winston Price, from the Johns Hopkins University, took nasal passage samples and isolated the first rhinovirus, which he called the JH virus, named after Johns Hopkins. His findings were published in 1956.  Transmission and epidemiology  There are two modes of transmission: via aerosols of respiratory droplets and from fomites (contaminated surfaces), including direct person-to-person contact. Rhinoviruses are spread worldwide and are the primary cause of the common cold. Symptoms include sore throat, runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing and cough; sometimes accompanied by muscle aches, fatigue, malaise, headache, muscle weakness, or loss of appetite. Most sinus findings are reversible consistent with a self-limited viral process typical of rhinovirus colds. Fever and extreme exhaustion are more usual in influenza. Children may have six to twelve colds a year. In the United States, the incidence of colds is higher in the autumn and winter, with most infections occurring between September to April. The seasonality may be due to the start of the school year and to people spending more time indoors (thus in proximity with each other), thereby increasing the chance of transmission of the virus. Lower ambient, especially outdoor, temperatures may also be factor given that rhinoviruses preferentially replicate at 32 ¬∞C (89 ¬∞F) as opposed to 37 ¬∞C (98 ¬∞F) ‚Äì see following section. Variant pollens, grasses, hays and agricultural practices may be factors in the seasonality as well as the use of chemical controls of lawn, paddock and sportsfields in schools and communities. The changes in temperature, humidity and wind patterns seem to be factors. It is also postulated that poor housing, overcrowding and unsanitary conditions related to poverty are relevant factors in the transmission of 'common cold'. Those most affected by rhinoviruses are infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised people.  Pathogenesis  The primary route of entry for human rhinoviruses is the upper respiratory tract (mouth and nose). Rhinovirus A and B use \\"major\\" ICAM-1 (Inter-Cellular Adhesion Molecule 1), also known as CD54 (Cluster of Differentiation 54), on respiratory epithelial cells, as receptors to bind to. Some subgroups under A and B uses the \\"minor\\" LDL receptor instead. Rhinovirus C uses cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) to mediate cellular entry. As the virus replicates and spreads, infected cells release distress signals known as chemokines and cytokines (which in turn activate inflammatory mediators). Cell lysis occurs at the upper respiratory epithelium. Infection occurs rapidly, with the virus adhering to surface receptors within 15 minutes of entering the respiratory tract. Just over 50% of individuals will experience symptoms within 2 days of infection. Only about 5% of cases will have an incubation period of less than 20 hours, and, at the other extreme, it is expected that 5% of cases would have an incubation period of greater than four and a half days. Human rhinoviruses preferentially grow at 32 ¬∞C (89 ¬∞F), notably colder than the average human body temperature of 37 ¬∞C (98 ¬∞F); hence the virus's tendency to infect the upper respiratory tract, where respiratory airflow is in continual contact with the (colder) extrasomatic environment. Rhinovirus C, unlike the A and B species, may be able to cause severe infections. This association disappears after controlling for confounders. Duly, amongst infants infected with symptomatic respiratory illness in low-resource areas, there appears to be no association between rhinovirus species and disease severity.  Taxonomy  Rhinovirus was formerly a genus from the family Picornaviridae. The 39th Executive Committee (EC39) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) met in Canada during June 2007 with new taxonomic proposals. In April 2008, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses voted and ratified the following changes: * 2005.264V.04 To remove the following species from the existing genus Rhinovirus in the family Picornaviridae: ** Human rhinovirus A ** Human rhinovirus B * 2005.265V.04 To assign the following species to the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae: ** Human rhinovirus A ** Human rhinovirus B * 2005.266V.04 To remove the existing genus Rhinovirus from the family Picornaviridae. Note: The genus Rhinovirus hereby disappears. In July 2009, the ICTV voted and ratified a proposal to add a third species, Human rhinovirus C to the genus Enterovirus. * 2008.084V.A.HRV-C-Sp 2008.084V To create a new species named Human rhinovirus C in the genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae. There have been a total of 215 taxonomic proposals, which have been approved and ratified since the 8th ICTV Report of 2005. =Serotypes= Human rhinovirus serotype names are of the form HRV-Xn where X is the rhinovirus species (A, B, or C) and n is an index number. Species A and B have used the same index, while Species C has a separate index. Valid index numbers are as follows: *Rhinovirus A: 1, 2, 7‚Äì13, 15, 16, 18‚Äì25, 28‚Äì34, 36, 38‚Äì41, 43‚Äì47, 49‚Äì51, 53‚Äì68, 71, 73‚Äì78, 80‚Äì82, 85, 88‚Äì90, 94‚Äì96, 98, 100‚Äì103 *Rhinovirus B: 3‚Äì6, 14, 17, 26, 27, 35, 37, 42, 48, 52, 69, 70, 72, 79, 83, 84, 86, 91‚Äì93, 97, 99 *Rhinovirus C: 1‚Äì51  Structure  Human rhinovirus genome, virion structure, and species. Rhinoviruses have single-stranded positive sense RNA genomes of between 7200 and 8500 nt in length. At the 5' end of the genome is a virus-encoded protein and, as in mammalian mRNA, there is a 3' poly-A tail. Structural proteins are encoded in the 5' region of the genome and non structural at the 3' end. This is the same for all picornaviruses. The viral particles themselves are not enveloped and are icosahedral in structure. The viral proteins are translated as a single, long polypeptide, which is cleaved into the structural and nonstructural viral proteins. Human rhinoviruses are composed of a capsid that contains four viral proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. VP1, VP2, and VP3 form the major part of the protein capsid. The much smaller VP4 protein has a more extended structure, and lies at the interface between the capsid and the RNA genome. There are 60 copies of each of these proteins assembled as an icosahedron. Antibodies are a major defense against infection with the epitopes lying on the exterior regions of VP1-VP3.  Novel antiviral drugs  Interferon-alpha used intranasally was shown to be effective against human rhinovirus infections. However, volunteers treated with this drug experienced some side effects, such as nasal bleeding, and began developing resistance to the drug. Subsequently, research into the treatment was abandoned. Pleconaril is an orally bioavailable antiviral drug being developed for the treatment of infections caused by picornaviruses. This drug acts by binding to a hydrophobic pocket in VP1, and stabilizes the protein capsid to such an extent that the virus cannot release its RNA genome into the target cell. When tested in volunteers, during the clinical trials, this drug caused a significant decrease in mucus secretions and illness-associated symptoms. Pleconaril is not currently available for treatment of human rhinoviral infections, as its efficacy in treating these infections is under further evaluation. Other substances such as Iota-Carrageenan may form a basis for the creation of drugs to combat the human rhinovirus. In asthma, human rhinoviruses have been recently associated with the majority of asthma exacerbations for which current therapy is inadequate. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) has a central role in airway inflammation in asthma, and it is the receptor for 90% of Human rhinoviruses. Human rhinovirus infection of airway epithelium induces ICAM-1. Desloratadine and loratadine are compounds belonging to the new class of H1-receptor blockers. Anti-inflammatory properties of antihistamines have been recently documented, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are not completely defined. These effects are unlikely to be mediated by H1-receptor antagonism and suggest a novel mechanism of action that may be important for the therapeutic control of virus-induced asthma exacerbations. In 2018, a new series of anti-rhinoviral compounds were reported by researchers at Imperial College London and colleagues at the University of York and the Pirbright Institute. These molecules target human N-myristoyltransferase, an enzyme in the host cell which picornavirus requires in order to assemble its viral capsid, and thus generate an infectious virion. The lead compound in this series, IMP-1088, very potently inhibited host myristoylation of viral capsid protein and prevented infectious virus formation, rescuing the viability of cells in culture which had been exposed to a variety of rhinovirus serotypes, or to related picornaviruses including poliovirus and foot-and-mouth-disease virus. Because these compounds target a host factor, they are broadly active against all serotypes, and it is thought to be unlikely that they can be overcome by resistance mutations in the virus.  Vaccine  There are no vaccines against these viruses as there is little-to-no cross-protection between serotypes. At least 99 serotypes of human rhinoviruses affecting humans have been sequenced. However, a study of the VP4 protein has shown it to be highly conserved among many serotypes of human rhinovirus, opening up the potential for a future pan-serotype human rhinovirus vaccine. A similar result was obtained with the VP1 protein. Like VP4, VP1 also occasionally \\"pokes\\" out of the viral particle, making it available to neutralizing antibodies. Both peptides have been tested on rabbits, resulting in successful generation of cross-serotype antibodies. The successful introduction of human ICAM-1 into mice has removed a major roadblock in creating an animal model for RV vaccination.  Prevention  Human rhinovirus is most contagious during the autumn and winter months. The virus can remain activated for up to 3 hours outside of a human host. Once the virus is contracted, a person is most contagious within the first 3 days. Preventative measures such as regular vigorous handwashing with soap and water may aid in avoiding infection. Avoiding touching the mouth, eyes, and nose, the most common entry points for rhinovirus may also aid in prevention. Droplet precautions, which take the form of a surgical mask and gloves, are the method used in major hospitals.

It originally aired on October 16, 1959 on CBS. It was the first Twilight Zone episode to be rerun. Opening narration Plot Al Denton was once known as the quickest draw in town, but riddled with increasing guilt over the losers in his gun duels (one of whom was a teenage boy), he became an alcoholic wreck and the laughingstock of the community. A mysterious salesman named Henry J. Fate causes Denton to inexplicably regain his expert shooting touch and once again inspire the respect and awe of the townsfolk; Denton explains to Liz, a saloon girl, that this will only cause reputation-hungry gunslingers from miles around to seek him out and, inevitably, kill him. He cleans himself up and goes sober but only, he says, so as to die with dignity. Just as Denton predicted, soon enough a challenge is delivered which Denton dares not refuse. The still-weary and not-so-sure-handed Denton practices in the desert for his suicidal duel, but he misses his targets miserably and concludes that he must skip town. As he packs his things and tries to flee under the cover of night, he strikes up a conversation with Fate, who seems to know things about Denton and offers him a way out. Fate offers him a potion guaranteed to make the drinker the fastest gun in the West for exactly ten seconds. Denton is skeptical but Fate goads him into drinking a free sample, after which Denton immediately realizes its benefits. At the appointed time, Denton faces his challenger, Pete Grant, a brash young gunfighter. Denton downs his potion only to find his opponent holding an identical empty bottle. Grant and Denton both realize that Fate tricked them, but it is too late to back out of the duel. Each man shoots the other in the hand, causing injuries which are minor but forever ruin both men's ability to pull a trigger. Denton tells his young opponent that they have both been blessed because they will never again be able to fire a gun in anger. He tells Liz that Grant is lucky because he was given this lesson early. Henry J. Fate tips his hat to Denton and rides quietly out of town. Closing narration Cast * Dan Duryea as Al Denton * Martin Landau as Dan Hotaling * Jeanne Cooper as Liz Smith * Malcolm Atterbury as Henry J. Fate * Doug McClure as Pete Grant * Ken Lynch as Charlie * Bill Erwin as Man at the Bar Episode notes This episode is one of very few in the series whose opening sequence features an eye with heavy mascara. It was plastered over the original opening when \\"Mr. Denton on Doomsday\\" was rerun on June 24, 1960. Although the plastering of Season One intros (including the majority of episodes with this alternate intro) is not uncommon due to the Summer 1961 repeat season, this is the only case of the alternate Season One intro plastering the original. The original lagoon opening has since been restored. In his 1959 promotional film shown to potential sponsors, Rod Serling summarized an earlier version of this episode's plot under its original title, \\"Death, Destry, and Mr. Dingle\\". As told by Serling, the basic premise is similar, but the earlier version seems to have been more comedic in tone, involving a meek schoolteacher who quite unintentionally gains notoriety as a top gunslinger. The name \\"Mr. Dingle\\" (originally intended for the Dan Duryea character) would be used by Serling for a future episode, with Burgess Meredith playing the eponymous character in \\"Mr. Dingle, the Strong\\" in 1961. The harmonica in the background is playing the Russian folksong \\"Stenka Razin\\". Al Denton's speech to Liz Smith, in which he describes having been a top gunfighter until he turned to drink after being \\"called out\\" by a 16-year- old boy, was parodied in the Mel Brooks comedy Blazing Saddles. In that film, the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder) had also been a top gunfighter until he was challenged (and shot) by a six-year-old child, leading him to become an alcoholic. Martin Landau, playing here the sadistic bully to the story's protagonist, Al Denton, would return to The Twilight Zone five years later in ‚ÄúThe Jeopardy Room‚Äù; this time he is the sadistically-treated victim - a KGB major longing to defect but targeted for assassination.

It originally aired on October 23, 1959 on CBS. The title is a reference to 16 mm film. Opening narration Plot Aging film star Barbara Jean Trenton secludes herself in her private screening room, where she reminisces about her past by watching her old films from the 1930s. In an attempt to bring her out into the real world, her agent Danny Weiss arranges a part for her in a new movie. Barbara and the man who runs the studio, Marty Sall, however, have historically had a contentious relationship; he is rather petty, small, and callous. He offers her the role of a mother, which she refuses. When Barbara returns home, she and Danny get into an argument when she decides to deny reality and throw a party for her friends (all have either moved away or have died). After the argument, Barbara has, according to her maid, chosen to stay in the screening room day and night. Danny decides to bring a former leading man‚Äînow also older, Jerry Herndon, many years retired from acting and managing a chain of grocery stores‚Äîto visit her. She is horrified by her friend's aged appearance and orders them both to leave. After the ill-fated visit, Barbara goes back into the projector room and puts on a movie that features Jerry's younger self. She will not accept that the present-day Jerry is the real one and voices her wish repeatedly to join the one on the screen; the screen blurs accordingly. Barbara's maid comes with a snack and coffee, only to find the room empty‚Äîand is horrified by what she sees on the screen. She calls Danny and, when he comes over, tells him that - to her mind - Barbara has vanished from the house. He runs the projector and sees, in the movie, the living room of the house filled with movie stars, looking as they did in the old films. Barbara descends the stairs, welcomes them to the party and says that dinner will be by the pool. As she starts off with Jerry, Danny tries to call her back to 1959 and reality. In response, she throws her scarf toward the camera and departs. The film ends. In the actual living room, Danny finds Barbara's scarf. \\"To wishes, Barbie\\", he says wistfully. \\"To the ones that come true.\\" Closing narration Cast * Ida Lupino as Barbara Jean Trenton * Martin Balsam as Danny Weiss * Jerome Cowan as Jerry * Ted de Corsia as Marty Sall * Alice Frost as Sally Episode notes This episode contains several similarities to Billy Wilder's 1950 film Sunset Boulevard starring Gloria Swanson and shares the same composer and conductor of music, Franz Waxman. Mitchell Leisen directed Billy Wilder scripts at Paramount in the 1930s. It also evokes 1952's The Star with Bette Davis which was directed by Stuart Heisler and released by Twentieth-Century Fox. Ida Lupino later directed the season five episode \\"The Masks\\". She was both the only person to have acted in one episode and directed another, and the only woman to direct a Twilight Zone episode. References Further reading * DeVoe, Bill. (2008).

Plot While driving his car in the countryside on a summer afternoon circa 1959, 36-year-old New York advertising executive Martin Sloan stops to have his car serviced at a gas station within walking distance of Homewood, his hometown. After walking into town, he sees that it apparently has not changed since he was a boy. He visits the drugstore and is confused when he finds out that ice cream sodas are still only 10 cents. Martin walks to the town park, where he is startled to see himself as a boy of eleven, carving his name into the bandstand, exactly as he remembers doing. Grown-up Martin approaches, resulting in tweenage Martin becoming scared, believing himself to be in trouble, and he runs away. Following his tween self home, he meets his folks as they were in his childhood, but is turned away. He sees the next door neighbor, a teen boy working on his brand new roadster; Martin soon discovers that it is the year 1934. > A man can think a lot of thoughts and walk a lot of pavements between > afternoon and night.

Confused and worried, Martin wanders around town and ends up at his former home again later that evening, where he again tries to convince his parents who he is by showing his identification, but is slapped by his mother and rejected. Martin wanders back to the park and finds his preteen self on a carousel. His advances again frighten the boy, who falls off the merry-go- round and injures his leg. Simultaneously, Martin experiences excruciating pain in his leg, due to the effect of the injury propagating through time to his adult self. The carousel is stopped, and Martin tries to tell his younger self to enjoy his boyhood while it lasts. After eleven-year-old Martin is carried away, adult Martin, sitting dejectedly on the carousel, is joined by his father who tells him young Martin will be all right, but will have a limp. He also tells him that having seen money with future dates and adult Martin's driver's license (with a 1960 expiration date) from Martin's wallet, which he had dropped at the house during the confrontation earlier, he now believes Martin's story. Martin's father advises his son that everyone has his time and that instead of looking behind him, he should look ahead; as delightful and rewarding as he may remember childhood to be, adulthood holds its own delights and rewards. When Martin walks back into the drugstore, he finds himself back in 1959, where ice cream sodas are now 35 cents. He discovers that he now has a limp from the carousel injury. Martin makes his way back to the gas station where he picks up his car. He drives away, content for once to live his life in his own age group.

As for other Twilight Zone episodes, Bernard Herrmann‚Äîalso composer of the first season's main title music and most of its stock music‚Äîwrote the music for this one. The very intimate and tuneful score has an isolated running time of about 19 minutes and is played by a 19-piece-orchestra consisting of strings (violins, violas, cellos, basses) and one harp. The park in this episode is said to be inspired by Recreation Park in Binghamton, New York, which is located about five blocks away from Rod Serling's childhood home. Like the park in \\"Walking Distance\\", Recreation Park has a carousel and a bandstand. There is a plaque in the Recreation Park bandstand commemorating the episode.Rod Serling official website The plaque and the episode are referenced heavily in the 2015 film The Rewrite, which is mostly set in Binghamton. Themes Similar themes of nostalgia, its potential risks, the relentless pressures of the business world, and the disillusionments that come with being an adult are explored in \\"A Stop at Willoughby\\", \\"Young Man's Fancy\\", \\"The Incredible World of Horace Ford\\", \\"Of Late I Think of Cliffordville\\", and to a lesser extent, \\"The Brain Center at Whipple's\\", as well as two Serling teleplays from before and after The Twilight Zone: The Kraft Television Theatre episode \\"Patterns\\" and the Night Gallery episode \\"They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar\\". Critical response \\"Walking Distance\\" has continued to be one of the most popular and critically acclaimed of all Twilight Zone episodes. Paul Mandell of American Cinematographer wrote: \\"[Walking Distance] was the most personal story Serling ever wrote, and easily the most sensitive dramatic fantasy in the history of television.\\" The episode was listed as the ninth best episode in the history of the series by Time in celebration of the series' 50th anniversary. In an audio recording of an early 1970's lecture at Ithaca College included in Twilight Zone DVD packages, Serling was critical towards the episode, feeling in retrospect that his relative inexperience as a writer at the time was apparent in the screenplay. Soundtrack releases Due to the high popularity of the episode and the music itself the score has received several releases on CD in its original film version in monoaural sound and two re-recordings in stereo as well, one done by Joel McNeely with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra (the only complete version) and the other by William T. Stromberg conducting the Moscow Symphony Orchestra. Orchestrator John Morgan enlarged all sections of the orchestra for the latter, referring to Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings as Herrmann's main influence on the score in the liner notes. Composer/Pianist, Tom Alexander, included the piece, \\"Excerpts From Walking Distance,\\" on his 2016 solo piano album, \\"Overbrook Avenue.\\" References Further reading * Zicree, Marc Scott: The Twilight Zone Companion.

It originally aired on November 13, 1959 on CBS. Opening narration Plot In 2046, an inmate named Corry, convicted of murder, is sentenced to fifty years' solitary confinement on a distant asteroid. On the fifteenth day of the sixth month of the fourth year of incarceration, he is visited by the spacecraft (flown by a Captain Allenby) that brings him supplies and news from Earth four times a year. While Corry expects that perhaps he and Allenby will have time to play cards or chess, the captain informs the inmate that the ship and crew can stay only fifteen minutes this time; the asteroid's orbit is such that they would otherwise be stuck fourteen days at least, awaiting favorable orbital conditions to depart. Allenby's crew resent being away from Earth because of the likes of Corry. Allenby has been trying to make Corry's stay humanely tolerable by bringing him things to take his mind off the loneliness, like the components to build an old car. He believes Corry that the killing was in self-defense and sympathizes with him. On this particular trip, the transport crew delights in bringing news that Corry's pardon was rejected and that murder cases are not even being reviewed. This causes Corry to feel that there is no way he is going to last out the years and the loneliness. Before leaving, Allenby orders his men to fetch a large crate which the captain instructs Corry to not open until the transport crew is out of sight‚Äîthey have no clue what is inside the box. Upon opening this special container, Corry discovers that Allenby has left him with a gynoid named Alicia to keep him company. Alicia is capable of emotions, memory and has a lifespan comparable to a human. At first, Corry detests her, rejecting her as a mere machine; synthetic skin and wires only capable of mocking him. However, when Corry hurts Alicia and sees that she is in fact capable of crying, he realizes that she has feelings. Over the next eleven months, Corry begins to fall in love with her. Alicia develops a personality that mirrors Corry's, and the days become bearable. When the ship returns, Captain Allenby brings news that the murder cases have been reviewed and Corry has been pardoned. He can return home to earth immediately but they only have twenty minutes before they must leave; the crew has been dodging meteors and are nearly out of fuel. Corry learns that, because there are seven other passengers from other asteroids on the ship, there is only room for him and fifteen pounds of luggage. He is initially unconcerned as he doesn't have fifteen pounds' worth of possessions that he cares about; then he realizes that Allenby does not consider Alicia human. The fifteen-pound limit is far too small to accommodate her. He frantically tries to find some way to take Alicia with him, arguing that she is not a robot, but a woman, and insisting that Allenby simply does not know Alicia as he does. At that point, just as the transport crew is surprised at the sight of Alicia, the captain suddenly draws his gun and shoots her in the face. The robot breaks down, malfunctioning, her face a mass of wire and broken circuitry which repeats the name \\"Corry\\". Allenby then takes Corry back to the ship, assuring him he will only be leaving behind loneliness. \\"I must remember that\\", Corry says tonelessly. \\"I must remember to keep that in mind\\".

The episode was adapted from a short story written by Lynn Venable (pen name of Marilyn Venable). The short story appeared in the January 1953 edition of the science fiction magazine If: Worlds of Science Fiction about seven years before the television episode first aired. \\"Time Enough at Last\\" became one of the most famous episodes of the original Twilight Zone and has been frequently parodied since. It is \\"the story of a man who seeks salvation in the rubble of a ruined world\\"Serling, Rod. Promotional spot for \\"Time Enough at Last\\". Original airdate: 13 November 1959. and tells of Henry Bemis (), played by Burgess Meredith, who loves books, yet is surrounded by those who would prevent him from reading them. The episode follows Bemis through the post-apocalyptic world, touching on such social issues as anti-intellectualism, the dangers of reliance upon technology, and the difference between aloneness (solitude) and loneliness. Opening narration Plot Bank teller and avid bookworm Henry Bemis (Meredith) reads David Copperfield while serving a customer from his window in a bank. He is so engrossed in the novel he regales the increasingly annoyed woman with information about the characters, and shortchanges her. Bemis's angry boss (Taylor), and later his nagging wife (deWit), both complain to him that he wastes far too much time reading \\"doggerel\\". As a cruel joke, his wife asks him to read poetry to her from one of his books; he eagerly obliges, only to find that she has inked over the text on every page, obscuring the words. Seconds later, she destroys the book by ripping the pages from it, much to Henry's dismay. The next day, as usual, Henry takes his lunch break in the bank's vault, where his reading cannot be disturbed. Moments after he sees a newspaper headline, which reads \\"H-Bomb Capable of Total Destruction\\", an enormous explosion outside shakes the vault, knocking Bemis unconscious. After regaining consciousness and recovering the thick glasses required for him to see, Bemis emerges from the vault to find the bank demolished and everyone in it dead. Leaving the bank, he sees that the entire city has been destroyed, and realizes that, while a nuclear war has devastated Earth, him being in the vault has saved him. Finding himself alone in a shattered world with canned food to last him a lifetime and no means of leaving to look for other survivors, Bemis succumbs to despair. As he prepares to commit suicide using a revolver he has found, Bemis sees the ruins of the public library in the distance. Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact; all the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and time to read them without interruption. His despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts the books he looks forward to reading for years to come, with no obligations to get in the way. Just as he bends down to pick up the first book, he stumbles, and his glasses fall off and shatter. In shock, he picks up the broken remains of the glasses without which he is virtually blind and bursts into tears, surrounded by books he now can never read. Closing narration Production Burgess Meredith as Henry Bemis \\"Time Enough at Last\\" was one of the first episodes written for The Twilight Zone. It introduced Burgess Meredith to the series; he went on to star in three more episodes, being introduced as \\"no stranger to The Twilight Zone\\" in promotional spots for season two's \\"The Obsolete Man\\". He also narrated for the 1983 film Twilight Zone: The Movie, which made reference to \\"Time Enough at Last\\" during its opening sequence, with the characters discussing the episode in detail. Footage of the exterior steps of the library was filmed several months after production had been completed. These steps can also be seen on the exterior of an Eloi public building in MGM's 1960 version of The Time Machine.Zicree, Marc Scott. The Twilight Zone Companion. Sillman-James Press, 1982 (second edition). John Brahm was nominated for a Directors Guild award for his work on the episode. The book that Bemis was reading in the vault and that flips open when the bomb explodes is A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus by Washington Irving. Themes Humanity's propensity for destruction and suicide are among the episode's themes. Although the overriding message may seem to \\"be careful what you wish for, you just might get it\\", there are other themes throughout the episode as well. Among these is the question of solitude versus loneliness, as embodied by Bemis' moment of near-suicide. Additionally, the portrayal of societal attitudes towards books speaks to the contemporary decline of traditional literature and how, given enough time, reading may become a relic of the past. At the same time, the ending \\"punishes Bemis for his antisocial behavior, and his greatest desire is thwarted\\". Rod Serling's concluding statement in the episode alludes to Robert Burns' Scots language poem \\"To a Mouse\\". The poem concludes: \\"The best-laid schemes o' mice an men / Gang aft agley\\" (translation: \\"Often go awry\\"). Although \\"Time Enough at Last\\" implies that nuclear warfare has destroyed humanity, film critic Andrew Sarris notes that the episode's necessarily unrealistic format may have been what allowed its production to commence: In the era of the Internet and eBooks, the irony depicted in \\"Time Enough at Last\\" has an information age counterpart, according to Weston Ochse of Storytellers Unplugged. As Ochse points out, when Bemis becomes the last person on Earth, he finally has time to read, with all his books at his fingertips and the only impediment is technology when his medium for accessing them‚Äîhis glasses‚Äîbreaks. In a hypothetical world where all books are published electronically, Ochse observes, readers would be \\"only a lightning strike, a faulty switch, a sleepy workman or a natural disaster away from becoming Henry Bemis at the end of the world\\"‚Äîthat is, a power outage has the potential to give them time to read, yet like Bemis, they too would lose their medium for accessing their books‚Äînamely the computer. =Similar episodes= The Twilight Zone often explored similar themes throughout its run. \\"Time Enough at Last\\" has strong thematic ties to a number of other episodes in the series, starting with that of isolation, first explored in the series pilot, \\"Where Is Everybody?\\" It is also a prominent theme in the previous episode \\"The Lonely\\". Additionally, in a plot very similar to that of \\"Time Enough at Last\\", \\"The Mind and the Matter\\" tells of a man who uses his mind to erase humanity, only to find that existence without other people is unbearable. The notion of being an outsider, lost in a sea of conformity, was one of the most common themes of the series. Other thematic elements in this episode can be found throughout the series, as well. \\"The Obsolete Man\\" takes the episode's literary subtext‚Äîthe notion that reading may eventually be considered \\"obsolete\\"‚Äîto an extreme: The state has declared books obsolete and a librarian (also played by Meredith) finds himself on trial for his own obsolescence. This notion, akin to Ray Bradbury's short story \\"The Pedestrian\\" (1951), is also alluded to in the episode \\"Number 12 Looks Just Like You\\", in which a perfect and equal world contradictorily considers works like those of Shakespeare \\"smut\\". Impact =Critical and fan favorite= \\"Time Enough at Last\\" was a ratings success in its initial airing and \\"became an instant classic\\". It \\"remains one of the best-remembered and best-loved episodes of The Twilight Zone\\" according to Marc Zicree, author of The Twilight Zone Companion. When a poll asked readers of Twilight Zone Magazine which episode of the series they remembered the most, \\"Time Enough at Last\\" was the most frequent response, with \\"To Serve Man\\" coming in a distant second. In TV Land's presentation of TV Guide's \\"100 Most Memorable Moments in Television\\", \\"Time Enough at Last\\" was ranked at #25. In an interview, Serling cited \\"Time Enough at Last\\" as one of his two favorites from the entire series. (The other episode was \\"The Invaders\\", with Agnes Moorehead.) =Amusement park attractions= *The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, a theme park ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios and formerly Disney California Adventure Park, displays a replica of Henry Bemis' broken glasses in the lobby. It is noted that, while they are indeed reading glasses, Burgess Meredith wears them the entire episode to make Bemis look more bookish. =Comics= The comic book version of The Simpsons, Simpsons Comics, published a story called \\"The Last Fat Man\\", based partially on \\"Time Enough at Last\\", and includes a short scene where Homer Simpson shoos a bespectacled man who is reading a book out of a nuclear bunker so he can eat in it, unintentionally taking shelter in it. =Film= *In Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983), Albert Brooks recounts the episode to Dan Aykroyd as they drive along an empty stretch of highway. \\"This thing freaked me out when I was seven years old,\\" says Brooks' character, adding: \\"I bought another pair of glasses just in case that would happen.\\" *The episode's title was borrowed by a 2004 independent film about a man who tries to escape an office building. The film's official website listed the webmaster's e-mail alias as \\"\`rodserling\`\\". =Games= *The PC game Fallout Tactics (2001) includes a librarian in a desolate world who wants the player to find his missing glasses so he can read his books. =Music= *The episode's title was borrowed by a song on The Fall's 1992 album Code: Selfish (1992) =Television= An episode of The Scary Door in Futurama parodies \\"Time Enough at Last\\". *The Modern Family episode \\"Airport 2010\\" references \\"Time Enough at Last\\" when the screen on Jay's electronic reader gets broken. Jay pours the broken glass to the floor while saying \\"Not fair. It's not fair\\". *Episode 12 of Revolution, titled \\"Ghosts\\", has Jim Hudson's character who goes by the name of Henry Bemis. Henry (Jim) has become the town librarian, until Miles convinces him to help the rebels and go back to his real name. *The line, \\"Seconds, minutes, hours, they crawl by on hands and knees\\" was referenced to in The Powerpuff Girls Season 2 episode, \\"Speed Demon\\", where the villain, HIM, torments the Powerpuff Girls before revealing that they have unknowingly arrived 50 years into the future, landing in a Townsville that HIM now controls. *In the season 14 episode of The Simpsons, \\"Strong Arms of the Ma\\", a postman is accidentally trapped under a car in front of the Simpson house. He intends to read The Twilight Zone Magazine but discovers that his glasses were broken in the accident while the Twilight Zone main-theme music is heard in the background. *The Scary Door, a show-within-a-show on Futurama parodying The Twilight Zone, pokes fun at the final twist in \\"Time Enough at Last\\". When the man in the episode loses his glasses, he realizes he can still read large print since his eyesight is not as bad as he perceived; his eyes fall out, but he declares he can read Braille; his hands fall off, and as he screams, his tongue falls out and then his head falls off. Bender comments, \\"Cursed by his own hubris.\\" *The Family Guy episode \\"Wasted Talent\\" features an end scene similar to the ending of \\"Time Enough At Last\\". In the Family Guy version, a lone brain cell discovers it is the last of its kind (as Peter drank so much alcohol throughout the episode that Brian worries that Peter may have killed his brain cells), and with a book in hand and stacks of other books surrounding him, prepares to begin reading, but looks down and his glasses shatter, after which, dismayed, he picks them up and says, \\"No! It's not fair! There was finally going to be TIME!...\\", much like what happens to Mr. Bemis. *The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius episode \\"Return of the Nanobots\\" features Hugh being the last man on Earth due to the nanobots having deleted everyone in Retroville and sampling endless supplies of pie. When Jimmy finally destroys the Nanobots' ship, Hugh is caught in the explosion, knocking over his mountains of pie, to which he says \\"No! It's not fair!\\", much like what happened to Henry, but everyone deleted returns. *The closing credits of The Drew Carey Show, season 5, episode 1, \\"Y2K, You're OK\\", include a parody of the final scene, where Drew is left alone in his bomb shelter with his \\"literature\\", in this case pornographic magazines, after the nuclear explosion, only to have his glasses break in the same manner, whereupon he repeated the final lines from Burgess Meredith. *In the Fear the Walking Dead episode \\"Buried\\" (Season 4, Episode 4), Nick and Luciana are scavenging in an abandoned library when they see, amid a trail of bloodied books on the floor, a pair of broken spectacles that resemble those belonging to Henry Bemis in \\"Time Enough At Last.\\" Nearby, they see a zombie who, as a human, had slashed his own wrists, presumably because he could no longer read once his glasses broke. * In The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel episode \\"Someday\\" (Season 2, Episode 8), Abe Weissman is revealed to be a fan of The Twilight Zone, regaling some party guests by reciting the events of \\"Time Enough at Last\\". Adaptations \\"Time Enough at Last\\" has been released in numerous formats over the years. *In 1988 it was available on VHS as part of a Twilight Zone collector's edition. *Two releases were made in 1998 and 1999, as part of a more widely available two- episodes-per-tape release scheme. *Although similar individual multi-episode DVDs were released, it is now exclusively available as part of The Twilight Zone ‚Äì The Definitive Edition, the first volume of which was released December 24, 2004. Included is an audio-only interview with Burgess Meredith as well as the clip of The Drew Carey Show's parody of the episode. *The story which inspired it has been released in eBook and MP3 form, capitalizing on the success of the episode. *In 2003, the Falcon Picture Group produced a series of radio dramas based on the series‚Äîstating, \\"In the 1950s many radio series were turned into television series ‚Äì so why not the reverse?\\"‚Äîwhich were broadcast on about 200 stations through the USA; \\"Time Enough at Last\\" was included in volume six. *In 2005, \\"Time Enough at Last\\" became one of the first Twilight Zone episodes offered for download via Google Video and later on sites such as Amazon.com.

It originally aired on November 27, 1959 on CBS. The title of the episode and the Charles Beaumont short story that inspired it is taken from Hamlet's \\"To be, or not to be\\" speech.from Hamlet, Act III, Scene I: > To die, - To sleep, - > To sleep ! Perchance to dream: - ay, there's the rub; > For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, > When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, > Must give us pause: there's the respect > That makes calamity of so long life; > Opening narration Plot Edward Hall (Conte), a man with a severe heart condition, believes that if he falls asleep, he'll die. On the other hand, keeping himself awake will put too much of a strain on his heart. He believes that his overactive imagination is severely out of control, to the point where he's been able to see and feel something that was not there. Due to this, his heart condition is especially dangerous. He seeks the aid of psychiatrist Dr. Eliot Rathmann. When he first enters the doctor's office, so tired he is barely able to stand, Rathmann helps him to the couch. Hall begins to drift into sleep, but suddenly jolts awake and gets up. He explains that, when he has allowed himself to sleep he has been dreaming in chapters, as if in a movie serial. In his dreams, Maya, a carnival dancer, lures him first into a funhouse and later onto a roller coaster in an attempt to scare him to death. Feeling that Rathmann cannot help him, Hall starts to leave, but stops when he sees that Rathmann's receptionist looks exactly like Maya. Terrified, he runs back into Rathmann's office and jumps out of the window. In reality, the doctor calls his receptionist, who does in fact look exactly like Maya, into his office, where Hall lies on the couch, his eyes closed. Rathmann tells the receptionist that Hall came in, lay down, immediately fell asleep, and then a few moments later let out a scream and died. \\"Well, I guess there are worse ways to go,\\" the doctor says philosophically. \\"At least he died peacefully...\\" Closing narration Episode notes *This was the first episode aired that was written by Charles Beaumont (and also the first that was not written by Rod Serling). *\\"Throughout the TV filming, Florey strove for quality. It might have been the most expensive MGM feature. He rooted out the meanings of certain lines, frequently surprising me with symbols and shadings I'd neither planned nor suspected. The set was truly impressionistic, recalling the days of Caligari and Liliom. The costumes were generally perfect.

Craven, however, insisted that his work was never inspired by Beaumont's. Radio drama The episode was adapted for radio in 2002 featuring Fred Willard as Edward Hall.

It was highly praised and shortlisted for the Booker Prize, the top literary prize in the UK. This was considered a comeback novel for Pym; she had fallen out of favour as styles changed, and her work had been rejected by publishers for 15 years. This followed her successful record as a novelist during the 1950s and early 1960s. As a novel, it represents a departure from her earlier style of light comedy, as it is the story of four office workers on the verge of retirement. Plot summary Marcia, Letty, Norman and Edwin all work together in the same office. None is married (Edwin being a widower) and each is nearing retirement age. Letty has plans to share a country retreat with her long-time friend, Marjorie. Her hopes are dashed when Marjorie suddenly announces that she is to marry a clergyman some years younger than she. After Marcia and Letty retire, each is faced with challenges. Letty suddenly has to move and Marcia has to deal with a loss of the routine that was an essential part of her life. Marcia gradually withdraws from the outside world, while Letty has to engage with it. Marcia eventually gives up eating and dies in pathetic circumstances. She has unexpectedly left her estate to Norman, in whom she had indulged a brief and secret semi-romantic interest. When Marjorie's fianc√© deserts her for a younger widow, Letty and her friend decided to take the country cottage after all. By now she has come to terms with retirement, her world has expanded, and so she does not immediately move. She realizes that she has opportunities to make her own choices. Norman and Edwin play less central roles in the \\"quartet\\", as their characters develop in response to the absences and actions of Marcia and Letty. At the end of the book, Letty is looking forward to inviting Norman and Edwin to meet Marjorie in the country. She thinks this would be a huge \\"opportunity\\" for the quartet, which was previously so urban and parochial, even though they have lost Marcia. Publication history Pym conceived of the novel in 1972: At the time, Pym was still working full-time at the International African Institute in London, and recovering from a mastectomy after developing cancer in her left breast. As she transitioned to retirement in late 1973 and 1974, Pym commenced work on the novel. Whereas most of her novels had been written in short time spans, Pym took three years to write Quartet in Autumn. She had not had a novel published since 1961, and had no realistic expectations that this would be either.Pym 1984, p.285 She completed the novel in 1976, under the original title of Four Point Turn. The poet Philip Larkin, who had a long- running correspondence with Pym, read the final draft and found it very strong. He was surprised by the sombre tone, so unlike Pym's earlier comic style, and suggested the title did not suit. Pym submitted the novel to Hamish Hamilton Limited in 1976 but it was rejected.Holt 1990, p.249 On 21 January 1977, The Times Literary Supplement ran an article in which high-profile literary figures listed their most underrated and overrated British novelists of the century. Pym was chosen as the most underrated writer by both Larkin and Lord David Cecil; she was the only novelist to be selected by two contributors. On the strength of this review, literary interest in Pym was revived after 16 years, and she was approached by several publishers for new material.Pym, Barbara, Finding a Voice, talk delivered on BBC Radio 3 on 4 April 1978, archived on The Barbara Pym Society website, accessed 26 April 2020 Quartet in Autumn was published by Macmillan in 1977. It was published in the United States by E.P. Dutton the following year, the second of her novels to do so (Less than Angels had been published in a small run in the 1950s) and the first to have mainstream success in the US. The novel was released as an audiobook by Chivers Press, read by Elizabeth Stephan. It was published in Portugal as Quarteto no Outono, France as Quatuor d'automne, Germany as Quartett im Herbst, and Turkey as Sonbahar Kuarteti. Reception Combined with the media interest after the piece in The Times, Quartet in Autumn was a success, with almost universally positive reviews, including in The Guardian and The Sunday Times.Holt 1990, p.260 Kirkus Reviews considered the book \\"Terribly brisk, but very affecting\\".Kirkus Reviews, 1 August 1978, accessed 26 April 2020 The only publications to write mixed reviews were The Sunday Telegraph and the New Statesman.Pym 1984, p.307 As this was the first time most American readers had heard of Pym, there was especial interest in her from American media outlets.

The title of the book is taken from the poem \\"Something to Love\\" by Thomas Haynes Bayly.Bayly, Thomas Haynes, Songs, Ballads, and Other Poems, London: Richard Bentley, 1844 Plot summary The novel details the lives of two sisters, Belinda and Harriet Bede, both spinsters in their fifties. University-educated Belinda is in love with the local Archdeacon, with whom she studied English poetry many years ago, but who is now married. Harriet, her more attractive sister, is constantly pursued by an Italian count, but she is more interested in the young curates who come to work in the village. During the course of the novel, both Belinda and Harriet meet various men who may be a potential love match. However they must also consider the conflict between entering into marriage at last, or remaining in their comfortable existences. Publication history Pym initially wrote Some Tame Gazelle in 1935 while studying at St Hilda's College, Oxford. However the novel was rejected by several publishers including Jonathan Cape and Gollancz. Cape expressed interest in Pym's writing, however, and encouraged her to make some alterations to the text and consider re-submitting.Pym 1984, p.60 Pym's friend, the up-and-coming literary critic Robert Liddell provided detailed criticism of the novel to assist with edits. World War II interrupted Pym's budding literary career, and she finally revised the novel to the point where it was accepted by Cape in 1950.Holt 1990, p.145 The novel sold 3,544 copies in Great Britain by the end of the 1950s, which was not a bestselling figure but was reasonable for a debut novelist.Holt 1990, p.194 Among the titles Pym considered was Some Sad Turtle Pym 1984, p.52 and The Well Tam'd Heart.Holt 1990, p.57 The novel was first published in the United States by E.P. Dutton in 1983. In 2012, the novel was released as an audiobook by Hachette, read by Patience Tomlinson. Some Tame Gazelle was published in Italy as Qualcuno da amare (Someone to love) and in France with the title literally translated as Comme une gazelle apprivois√©e. Reception and analysis The novel received several positive reviews. The Manchester Guardian called it \\"an enchanting book about village life\\" while Antonia White reviewed the novel for the New Statesman:Holt 1990, p.155 It has been considered a remarkable first novel, because of the way in which the youthful Pym‚Äîwho began the book while she was a student at Oxford, in the early 1930s‚Äîimagined herself into the situation of a middle-aged spinster, living with her sister in the country.Barbara Pym Society The poet Philip Larkin regarded Some Tame Gazelle as Pym's Pride and Prejudice Holt 1990, p.219 Many of the characters in the book are based on Pym's own circle, as she pictured them in twenty or thirty years' time. The two heroines, Belinda and Harriet Bede, are Barbara herself and her sister, Hilary. Archdeacon Hoccleve, a married clergyman for whom Belinda has long nurtured a passion, is believed to be based on Pym's first love, Henry Harvey. In the course of the book, both sisters receive proposals of marriage which they feel obliged to reject, partly because they are not attracted to the men in question, but mainly because they are so used to living together and have become devoted to one another. In fact, Pym and her sister did end up living together in a quiet village in Oxfordshire. Pym's friend, the British writer Robert Liddell, appears in the novel in the guise of Dr. Nicholas Parnell. Another character, Count Ricardo Bianco, is based on the real-life count and academic, Roberto Weiss. Connections to other novels Pym's characters often recur in minor roles. Harriet Bede reappears in An Unsuitable Attachment, in which Count Bianco's death is also reported, and Archdeacon Hoccleve is featured in Excellent Women and A Glass of Blessings.

Antonia Fraser called her \\"one of the most underrated writers of the 20th century\\", while Hilary Mantel said she was \\"deft, accomplished and somewhat underrated\\". Life and writings Born in Reading, Berkshire, the daughter of Oliver Coles, an insurance inspector, and his wife Elsie May Fewtrell, Elizabeth was educated at The Abbey School, Reading and then worked as a governess, tutor and librarian. She married John Taylor, owner of a confectionery company, in 1936, after which they lived in Penn, Buckinghamshire for almost all their married life.

As it progresses, it seems as if the cast are so fully rounded that all the novelist had to do was place them, successively, in one setting after another and observe how they reacted to each other.... The plot... never feels as if it were organised in advance; it feels as if it arises from her characters' mutual responses.\\"Philip Hensher \\"The Other Liz Taylor\\", The Daily Telegraph (London), 9 April 2006. Retrieved 13 March 2011. Taylor's work is mainly concerned with the nuances of everyday life and situations. Her shrewd but affectionate portrayals of middle-class and upper middle-class English life won her an audience of discriminating readers, as well as loyal friends in the world of letters. She was a friend of the novelist Ivy Compton-Burnett and of the novelist and critic Robert Liddell. Her long correspondence with the latter forms the subject of one of her short stories, \\"The Letter Writers\\" (published in The Blush, 1951), but the letters were destroyed, in line with her general policy of keeping her private life private. A horror of publicity is the subject of another celebrated short story, \\"Sisters\\", written in 1969.Publisher's copy for a reissue of The Other Elizabeth Taylor by Nicola Beauman. Retrieved 13 March 2011. Anne Tyler once compared Taylor to Jane Austen, Barbara Pym and Elizabeth Bowen ‚Äì \\"soul sisters all,\\" in Tyler's words. Taylor was also a close friend of Elizabeth Jane Howard, who was asked by Taylor's widower to write a biography following Elizabeth Taylor's death. Howard refused due to what she felt was a lack of incident in Taylor's life.Edmund Gordon \\"Elizabeth Taylor's last secret\\", Times Literary Supplement, 22 April 2009, as reproduced on the timesonline website See Slipstream, Elizabeth Jane Howard's memoir, for more details on their friendship. Taylor's editor at the UK publisher Chatto & Windus was the poet D. J. Enright. Elizabeth Taylor died of cancer in Penn, Buckinghamshire, at the age of 63. In the 21st century a new interest in her work was kindled by film-makers. During the 1970s, Ruth Sacks Caplin had written a film screenplay based on Taylor's novel Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont. Caplin's screenplay languished for decades, until her son, Lee Caplin, purchased the rights to the film in 1999. Ruth Sacks Caplin's film adaptation, Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont, directed by Dan Ireland, was finally released in 2005 with British actress Joan Plowright in the title role. French director Fran√ßois Ozon made a 2007 film of Angel with Romola Garai.

From the age of 16, she was mainly resident in England, where she was sent for her education. She is best known for her novel Wide Sargasso Sea (1966), written as a prequel to Charlotte Bront√´'s Jane Eyre. In 1978, she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her writing. Early life Rhys was born in Roseau, the capital of Dominica, one of the British Leeward Islands. Her father, William Rees Williams, was a Welsh doctor and her mother, Minna Williams, n√©e Lockhart, was a third-generation Dominican Creole of Scots ancestry. (\\"Creole\\" was broadly used in those times to refer to any person born on the island, whether they were of European or African descent, or both.) She had a brother. Her mother's family had an estate, a former plantation, on the island. Rhys was educated in Dominica until the age of 16, when she was sent to England to live with an aunt, as her relations with her mother were difficult. She attended the Perse School for Girls in Cambridge, where she was mocked as an outsider and for her accent. She attended two terms at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London by 1909. Her instructors despaired of her ever learning to speak \\"proper English\\" and advised her father to take her away. Unable to train as an actress and refusing to return to the Caribbean as her parents wished, Williams worked with varied success as a chorus girl, adopting the names Vivienne, Emma, or Ella Gray. She toured Britain's small towns and returned to rooming or boarding houses in rundown neighbourhoods of London.Carr, Helen (2004). \\"Williams, Ella Gwendoline Rees (1890‚Äì1979),\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press. After her father died in 1910, Rhys appeared to have experimented with living as a demimondaine. She became the mistress of wealthy stockbroker Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, whose father Hugh Colin Smith had been Governor of the Bank of England. Though a bachelor, Smith did not offer to marry Rhys, and their affair soon ended. However, he continued to be an occasional source of financial help. Distraught by events, including a near-fatal abortion (not Smith's child), Rhys began writing and produced an early version of her novel Voyage in the Dark. In 1913, she worked for a time in London as a person. During the First World War, Rhys served as a volunteer worker in a soldiers' canteen. In 1918, she worked in a pension office. Marriage and family In 1919, Rhys married Willem Johan Marie (Jean) Lenglet, a French-Dutch journalist, spy, and songwriter. He was the first of her three husbands. She and Lenglet wandered through Europe. They had two children, a son who died young and a daughter. They divorced in 1933, and her daughter lived mostly with her father. The next year, Rhys married Leslie Tilden-Smith, an English editor. In 1936, they went briefly to Dominica, the first time Rhys had returned since she had left for school. She found her family estate deteriorating and island conditions less agreeable. Her brother Oscar was living in England, and she took care of some financial affairs for him, making a settlement with an mixed-race woman on the island and Oscar's illegitimate children by her. In 1937, Rhys began a friendship with novelist Eliot Bliss (who had taken her first name in honour of two authors she admired). The two women shared Caribbean backgrounds. The correspondence between them survives.McFarlin Library Retrieved 17 September 2015. Bliss is quoted on their relations in Alexandra Pringle's introduction to the 1984 reissue of Bliss's novel Luminous Isle: \\"She used to make me delightful West- Indian suppers, and we used to drink an awful lot. Well, she could hold it, but it used to make me ill, frequently ill. And she had a delightful husband who used to leave us, go out. Well, often he would come home and find us drunk. He once picked her off the floor. And he was furious if he found we'd drunk his wine.\\" In 1939, Rhys and Tilden-Smith moved to Devon, where they lived for several years. He died in 1945. In 1947, Rhys married Max Hamer, a solicitor who was a cousin of Tilden-Smith. He was convicted of fraud and imprisoned after their marriage.\\"Kent: From Maidstone Prison to the Wide Sargasso Sea!\\" , Reading Detectives. He died in 1966. Writing career In 1924, Rhys came under the influence of English writer Ford Madox Ford. After meeting Ford in Paris, Rhys wrote short stories under his patronage. Ford recognised that her experience as an exile gave Rhys a unique viewpoint, and praised her \\"singular instinct for form\\". \\"Coming from the West Indies, [Ford] declared, 'with a terrifying insight and... passion for stating the case of the underdog, she has let her pen loose on the Left Banks of the Old World'.\\" This he wrote in his preface to her debut short story collection, The Left Bank and Other Stories (1927). It was Ford who suggested she change her name from Ella Williams to Jean Rhys.Owen, Katie, \\"Introduction\\", Quartet, Penguin Modern Classics edition, Penguin, 2000, p. vi. At the time her husband was in jail for what Rhys described as currency irregularities. Rhys moved in with Ford and his long-time partner Stella Bowen. An affair with Ford ensued, which she portrayed in fictionalised form in her novel Quartet (1928). Her protagonist is a stranded foreigner, Marya Zelli, who finds herself at the mercy of strangers when her husband is jailed in Paris. The 1981 film adaptation of the novel, produced by Merchant Ivory Productions, starred Maggie Smith, Isabelle Adjani, Anthony Higgins, and Alan Bates. In After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie (1931), the protagonist, Julia Martin, is a more unravelled version of Marya Zelli, romantically dumped and inhabiting the sidewalks, cafes and cheap hotel rooms of Paris. With Voyage in the Dark (1934), Rhys continued to portray a mistreated, rootless woman. Here the narrator, Anna, is a young chorus girl who grew up in the West Indies and feels alienated in England. Good Morning, Midnight (1939) is often considered a continuation of Rhys's first two novels. Here, she uses modified stream of consciousness to voice the experiences of an ageing woman, Sasha Jansen, who drinks, takes sleeping pills, and obsesses over her looks, and is adrift again in Paris. Good Morning, Midnight, acknowledged as well written but deemed depressing, came as World War II broke out and readers sought optimism. This seemingly ended Rhys's literary career. In the 1940s, Rhys largely withdrew from public life. From 1955 to 1960, she lived in Bude, Cornwall, where she was unhappy, calling it \\"Bude the Obscure\\", before moving to Cheriton Fitzpaine, a small village in Devon. After a long absence from the public eye, she was rediscovered by Selma Vaz Dias, who in 1949, placed an advertisement in the New Statesman asking about her whereabouts, with a view to obtaining the rights to adapt her novel Good Morning, Midnight for radio. Rhys responded, and thereafter developed a long-lasting and collaborative friendship with Vaz Dias, who encouraged her to start writing again. This encouragement ultimately led to the publication in 1966 of her critically acclaimed novel Wide Sargasso Sea. She intended it as an account of the woman whom Rochester married and kept in his attic in Jane Eyre. Begun well before she settled in Bude, the book won the notable WH Smith Literary Award in 1967. She returned to themes of dominance and dependence, especially in marriage, depicting the mutually painful relationship between a privileged English man and a Creole woman from Dominica made powerless on being duped and coerced by him and others. Both the man and the woman enter marriage under mistaken assumptions about the other partner. Her female lead marries Mr. Rochester and deteriorates in England as the \\"madwoman in the attic\\". Rhys portrays this woman from a quite different perspective from the one in Jane Eyre. Diana Athill of Andr√© Deutsch gambled on publishing Wide Sargasso Sea. She and the writer Francis Wyndham helped to revive interest in Rhys's work.Preliminary page in Jean Rhys, Quartet, Penguin: 2000, In 1968, Andr√© Deutsch published a collection of Rhys' short stories, Tigers Are Better-Looking, of which eight were written during her 1950s period of obscurity and nine republished from her 1927 collection The Left Bank and Other Stories. Her 1969 short story \\"I Spy a Stranger\\", published by Penguin Modern Stories, was adapted for TV in 1972 for the BBC's Thirty-Minute Theatre starring Mona Washbourne, Noel Dyson, Hanah Maria Pravda, and Basil Dignam. In 1976, Deutsch published another collection of her short stories, Sleep It Off Lady, consisting of 16 pieces from an approximately 75-year period, starting from the end of the 19th century. Later years From 1960, and for the rest of her life, Rhys lived in Cheriton Fitzpaine in Devon that she once described as \\"a dull spot which even drink can't enliven much.\\"\\"Villagers Reject 'Dull Spot' Jibe\\" , Exeter Express & Echo, 11 February 2010. Characteristically, she remained unimpressed by her belated ascent to literary fame, commenting, \\"It has come too late.\\" In an interview shortly before her death she questioned whether any novelist, not least herself, could ever be happy for any length of time: \\"If I could choose I would rather be happy than write... if I could live my life all over again, and choose....\\"In Their Own Words: British Novelists.

In addition to vivid fictional portrayals of Theseus, Socrates, Plato, and Alexander the Great, she wrote a non-fiction biography of Alexander. Biography Born at Dacre Lodge, 49 Plashet Road, Forest Gate, Essex (now in London), of physician Frank Challans and Mary Clementine Newsome Baxter Challans, Renault was educated first at Levick family school and Clifton Girls School in Bristol. She read English at St Hugh's College, Oxford, then an all-women's college, receiving an undergraduate degree in 1928. In 1933 she began training as a nurse at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford. During her training she met Julie Mullard (1912 ‚Äì 2006), a fellow nurse with whom she established a lifelong romantic relationship. She worked as a nurse while beginning a writing career, treating Dunkirk evacuees at the Winford Emergency Hospital in Bristol, and working in Radcliffe Infirmary's brain surgery ward until 1945. She published her first novel, Purposes of Love, in 1939: it has a contemporary setting, like her other early novels, and the novelist Linda Proud has described it as \\"a strange combination of Platonism and hospital romance\\". Her novel The Friendly Young Ladies (1943), which is about a lesbian relationship between a writer and a nurse, seems to have been inspired by her own relationship with Mullard. In 1948, after her novel Return to Night won an MGM prize worth $150,000, Renault and Mullard emigrated to South Africa, where they remained for the rest of their lives. There, according to Proud, they found a community of gay expatriates who had \\"escaped the repressive attitudes towards homosexuality in Britain for the comparatively liberal atmosphere of Durban.... Mary and Julie found themselves able to set up home together in this new land without causing the outrage they had sometimes provoked at home.\\" However, both Renault and Mullard were critical of the less liberal aspects of their new home, and participated in the Black Sash movement against apartheid in the 1950s. Shortly before her death, Mary was listed as one of the famous alumnae who had brought the Radcliffe Infirmary Nurses' Home much honour. Due to the especially wet winter of 1983 in Cape Town, Mary picked up a small cough. At first, the cough was no more than a mild irritant for Mary, but it soon \\"become a persistent, hacking attempt to clear her lungs and catch her breath.\\" After Julie voiced her fears to their mutual friend Dr. Sonnenberg, x-rays were performed, and Mary was diagnosed with pneumonia and was directed to a nursing home. After failing to eliminate the pneumonia with antibiotics, a visiting British surgeon performed a bronchoscopy under general anaesthetic. Shortly after, the doctor revealed to Julie that he had \\"found fluid on the lung and had aspirated some of it: the cause was cancer.\\" Julie begged the doctors to say nothing to Mary unless she demanded to be told. By October, a friend of Dr. Sonnenberg, Dr. Slome, was draining off liquid twice a week and was convinced that there was a pocket he could not reach. Mary was then put on oxygen in order to ease her breathing. On 12 December 1983, as a last hope, the doctors decided to inject a new chemical into the pleura early the next morning, in the hope that it would stop further fluid from forming. Before the operation even began, Julie received a phone call, which she knew \\"could only mean one thing\\". Mary Renault died in Cape Town on 13 December 1983. Themes In South Africa Renault was able to write forthrightly about homosexual relationships for the first time. Her sympathetic treatment of love between men won her a wide gay readership, but it also led to rumours that Renault was really a gay man writing under a female pseudonym. Renault found these rumours amusing but also sought to distance herself from being labelled a \\"gay writer\\". Her historical novels are all set in ancient Greece. They include a pair of novels about the mythological hero Theseus and a trilogy about the career of Alexander the Great. In a sense, The Charioteer (1953), the story of two young gay servicemen in the 1940s who try to model their relationship on the ideals expressed in Plato's Phaedrus and Symposium, is a warm-up for Renault's historical novels. By turning away from the twentieth century and focusing on stories about male lovers in the warrior societies of ancient Greece, Renault no longer had to deal with homosexuality and anti-gay prejudice as social \\"problems\\". Instead she was free to focus on larger ethical and philosophical concerns while examining the nature of love and leadership. The Charioteer could not be published in the US until 1959, which made it a somewhat later addition to homosexual literature in the United States because American readers and critics had accepted serious gay love stories in such works as Djuna Barnes' Nightwood (1936), Carson McCullers' Reflections in a Golden Eye (1941), Truman Capote's Other Voices, Other Rooms (1948) and Gore Vidal's The City and the Pillar (1948). Although not a classicist by training, Renault was admired in her day for her scrupulous recreations of the ancient Greek world. Some of the history presented in her fiction and in her non-fiction work, The Nature of Alexander has been called into question, however. Her novels about Theseus rely on the controversial theories of Robert Graves, and her portrait of Alexander has been criticised as uncritical and romanticised. According to Kevin Kopelson, professor of English at the University of Iowa, Renault \\"mischaracterise[s] pederastic relationships as heroic.\\" Defying centuries of admiration for Demosthenes as a great orator, Renault portrayed him as a cruel, corrupt and cowardly demagogue. Renault defended her interpretation of the available sources in author's notes attached to her books. Though Renault appreciated her gay following, she was uncomfortable with the \\"gay pride\\" movement that emerged in the 1970s after the Stonewall riots. Like Laurie Odell, the protagonist of The Charioteer, she was suspicious of identifying oneself primarily by one's sexual orientation. Late in her life she expressed hostility to the gay rights movement, troubling some of her fans. David Sweetman remarks in his biography of Renault that her novels generally portray mothers in a poor light and that, particularly in her later novels, this is extended to women in general. Her generally negative depiction of women has also been noted by the critic Carolyn Heilbrun.Reinventing Womanhood Carolyn Heilbrun, 1979 (Chapter Three) Legacy The powerful impact Renault's work may have had on many readers, especially emerging young gay men, is suggested in a personal memoir by author and critic Daniel Mendelsohn.

He was the only sculptor among the original members. After participating in the foundation of the PRB, Woolner emigrated for a period to Australia. He returned to Britain to have a successful career as a sculptor, creating many important public works as well as memorials, tomb sculptures and narrative reliefs. He corresponded with many notable men of the day and also had some success as a poet and as an art dealer. Art career Born in Hadleigh, Suffolk, Woolner trained with the sculptor William Behnes, exhibiting work at the Royal Academy from 1843. He became friendly with Dante Gabriel Rossetti and was invited by him to join the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Woolner was active in the early history of the group, emphasising the need for a more vivid form of realism in sculpture. Woolner's classical inclinations became increasingly difficult to reconcile with Pre-Raphaelite Medievalism, but his belief in close observation of nature was consistent with their aims. Woolner's sculptures immediately after the foundation of the Brotherhood in 1848 display close attention to detail. He made his name with forceful portrait busts and medallions, but was at first unable to make a living. He was forced to emigrate to Australia in 1852 (inspiring the painting The Last of England by Ford Madox Brown), but after a year he returned to Britain, soon establishing himself as both a sculptor and art-dealer. His visit to Australia nevertheless helped him to obtain commissions there and elsewhere for statues of British imperial heroes, such as Captain Cook and Sir Stamford Raffles. His bronze statue of John Robert Godley in Christchurch, New Zealand, was toppled and shattered into several pieces by the February 2011 earthquake. It has since been repaired and was re-erected in March 2015. Woolner became a close friend of Francis Turner Palgrave. The two shared a house and both were known for their combative personalities. Henry Adams refers to them in The Education of Henry Adams, noting that Woolner had a \\"rough\\" personality and had to make \\"a supernatural effort\\" to be polite.Henry Adams, Ira B. Nadel, (ed), The Education of Henry Adams, Oxford University Press, 1999, p.183. Woolner designed the frontispiece of a piping youth for Palgrave's famous verse anthology the Golden Treasury (1861). There was a minor scandal in 1862 when Palgrave was commissioned to write a catalogue for the 1862 International Exhibition, in which he praised Woolner and denigrated other sculptors, especially Woolner's main rival Carlo Marochetti. The well known controversialist Jacob Omnium pointed out in a series of letters to the press that the two lived together. William Holman Hunt wrote a reply supporting Woolner,James H. Coombs, A Pre-Raphaelite friendship: the correspondence of William Holman Hunt and John Lucas Tupper, UMI Research Press, 1986, p.133. but Palgrave was forced to withdraw the catalogue. Thomas Woolner, c. 1865 His largest single commission was a programme of architectural sculptures for the Manchester Assize Courts, built in Manchester from 1859 through 1864. Woolner created a large number of statues depicting lawgivers and rulers which formed part of the building's structure. Most dramatic was a giant sculpture depicting Moses which was placed on the top, above the entrance. There were also allegorical figures of Justice and Mercy. Inside was a relief sculpture depicting the Judgment of Solomon, flanked by statues of a Drunk Woman and a Good Woman. Alfred Waterhouse, the architect, wrote, \\"we are all delighted with your virtuous woman, and disgusted as we ought to be with the awful example.\\"Terry Wykes, Harry Cocks, Public Sculpture of Greater Manchester, Liverpool University Press, 2004, p.76. The building was bombed during World War II. Some of the sculptures were saved and incorporated into the replacement building. Woolner made his living mainly from creating statues of famous men, but his most personal and complex works in sculpture were what he called \\"ideal\\" groups, notably Civilization (1867) and Virgilia bewailing the absence of Coriolanus (1871). These demonstrate his attempt to express the tension between the static stone and the dynamic desires of the figures represented emerging into solidity from it. Woolner also made a large number of relief sculptures for memorials. His reliefs depicting scenes from the Iliad were widely reproduced. These were intended to commemorate the classical scholarship of William Gladstone. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1875 and served as professor of sculpture from 1877 to 1879. Personal life On 6 September 1864 Woolner married Alice Gertrude Waugh. He had initially been in love with her sister, Fanny, and had previously proposed to her, but she turned him down. Fanny married Woolner's Pre-Raphaelite colleague William Holman Hunt the following year, but died in childbirth a year later. In 1874, while in Italy, Hunt married their third sister Edith, an act which Woolner considered immoral and which was defined as incest under British laws at the time. He never spoke to Hunt again. Hunt's granddaughter Diana Holman-Hunt later claimed that before his marriage Woolner had been involved in a relationship with a lower-class girl called Amelia Henderson, who appealed to Hunt for support. Hunt arranged with Frederick Stephens to give her funds to emigrate to Australia so that she would not interfere with Woolner's wedding plans.Diana Holman-Hunt, My Grandfather, his Wives and Loves, London: Hamish Hamilton, 1969, p.234. Woolner and Alice had six children, four daughters and two sons. His eldest child, Amy, later wrote a biography of her father. His two sons Hugh (1866‚Äì1925) and Geoffrey (1867‚Äì1882) were sent to Marlborough College, where Geoffrey died at the age of 14. Hugh became a stockbroker. Poetry and other work Woolner in later years Woolner was also a poet of some reputation in his day. His early poem My Beautiful Lady is a Pre- Raphaelite work, emphasising intense unresolved moments of feeling. He later expanded it into a full-length work modelled on Tennyson's narrative poetry. According to William Michael Rossetti, Coventry Patmore \\"praised Woolner's poems immensely, saying however that they were sometimes slightly over- passionate, and generally 'sculpturesque' in character\\".William Michael Rossetti, ed., Pre-Raphaelite Diaries and Letters (London, 1906), p. 222. By this, he meant that \\"each stanza was a separate unit\\".Lionel Stevenson, The Pre-Raphaelite Poets, University of North Carolina Press, NC, 1972, p.256. In the 1880s he wrote three long narrative works, Pygmalion, Silenus and Tiresias. These renounce Pre-Raphaelitism in favour of an often eroticised classicism. The first describes the sculptor Pygmalion's efforts to create a more realistic form of art. He battles against a group called \\"The Archaics\\". The second describes the love affair between Silenus and the nymph Syrinx. After her death at the hands of Pan, Silenus becomes an obese alcoholic, but acquires prophetic powers. A vision of the goddess Athena restores him to emotional stability. In Tiresias the blind sage recalls his long life; in a visionary pantheism, he demonstrates his power to understand the language of birds and enter into the experiences of all living things and natural forces. Woolner was a close friend of a number of writers of the day, notably Thomas Carlyle and Alfred Tennyson. He provided the latter with the scenario for his poem \\"Enoch Arden\\". He also corresponded with Charles Darwin, who named part of the human ear the 'Woolnerian Tip' after a feature in Woolner's sculpture Puck. Woolner had discussed the feature when Darwin had been sitting to him for a portrait. Darwin later sought his views when preparing The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Thomas Woolner died instantly from a stroke at the age of 66. He was buried in St Mary‚Äôs churchyard, Hendon. The kerb around his grave has a sculptor‚Äôs mallet and tools carved into it. Buried within St Mary‚Äôs Church itself is Sir Stamford Raffles, whose statue he sculpted. His wife Alice died in 1912. Their son, Hugh, travelled back to his home in New York from her funeral on the .

It offers study programs in engineering, humanities, natural and social sciences, in which students can acquire bachelor's, master's or doctorate degrees. Furthermore, the university offers a preparatory program ‚Äì the Foundation Year. Jacobs University‚Äôs students come from more than 120 countries. With about 80% foreign students and approx. 33% international faculty members, Jacobs University is one of the most international universities. According to its mission statement, Jacobs University pursues the goal of supporting talented young people to become world citizens through academic education, intensive mentoring and living together on an international campus - regardless of nationality, religion and financial background.  History  Jacobs University Bremen Campus Center Jacobs University Bremen (originally called International University Bremen) was founded in 1999 with the support of the University of Bremen, Rice University in Houston, Texas, and the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, with study programs beginning in 2001. After the university faced some financial problems, the Jacobs Foundation invested ‚Ç¨200 million in the institution in November 2006, thus taking over a two-thirds majority of the partnership share. At the beginning of 2007, the university changed its name to Jacobs University Bremen. The campus is located on the site of the former Roland Barracks in Bremen-Grohn. The site was erected in 1938 during the National Socialist period. After the Second World War it was transformed into a displaces-persons camp by the International Refugee Organization under the management of the American forces known as Camp Grohn. Shortly after the formation of the Bundeswehr, Camp Grohn was passed into the responsibility of the German government in 1955 and renamed Roland Kaserne. Roland Kaserne housed a Bundeswehr logistics school during the Cold War. In 1999, the military base was inactivated, making way for the university. The approximately 34-hectare site of the campus university is home to four residential colleges, buildings for administration, lecturing and research, an Information Resource Center (IRC) with a library and digital resources, sport, leisure and park facilities. = Financing = At the end of a four-year plan (2014-2017) for realignment, Jacobs University generated revenues of ‚Ç¨50.2 million in fiscal year 2017, an increase of ‚Ç¨2.8 million (5.9 percent) over the previous year. Compared to the reference year 2012, Jacobs University was able to continuously reduce its losses. As part of its restructuring, the university cut a total of 65 jobs in 2014. The long-term financing of Jacobs University is an ongoing debate in Bremen. The university generates its income through different areas, including study fees, donations, third-party funding, business cooperations and contributions from the Jacobs Foundation. The funding from the state of Bremen, which amounts to three million euros a year, expired in 2017. In June 2018, the Jacobs Foundation decided to support the private university until 2027 with a maximum of another 100 million Swiss francs. Simultaneously, the city of Bremen took over a loan from the start-up phase of the university in order to strengthen the financial abilities of the institution in the long term. Organization The university is managed by a not-for-profit company Jacobs University Bremen gGmbH. In line with the statutes, it is composed of four organs: the Councilors, the Board of Trustees, the Board of Governors and the Executive Board, which comprises the Managing Director and the President. The Board of Governors is the central decision-making committee for all the fundamental questions of the university's development, including the appointment of the president and the professors. Christian Jacobs, the eldest son of the entrepreneur and patron Klaus J. Jacobs (1936‚Äì2008), is a member of the board of trustees of the Jacobs Foundation. = University Leadership = On December 1, 2019, Prof. Dr. Antonio Loprieno took over as President of the University from Prof. Dr. Michael H√ºlsmann.

Exchange programs with a total of 26 international partners help to foster the international atmosphere. Overseen by resident mentors, the vast majority of students live on campus in one of four colleges. They pursue their sporting, social, political or cultural interests in more than 50 student clubs. Jacobs students organize a number of recurring events on campus such as conferences, culture information days, sports competitions and art exhibitions. Jacobs University has two groups of student government: The Undergraduate Student Government (USG) and the Graduate Student Association (GSA), representing the undergraduate and graduate student body, respectively. = Research = Research in the three Focus Areas is an important pillar of Jacobs University. Its scientists have made a name for themselves through a large number of international and national research projects. Jacobs University's faculty members have been very successful in attracting third-party funding. In 2017, each professor raised an average of 205,900 euros in third-party funding. Jacobs University's research projects are funded by the German Research Foundation or the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation of the European Union as well as by leading global companies. Professors often involve the students in their research work from the first semester onwards. = Rankings = In national and international university rankings, Jacobs University continuously achieves top ratings. According to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2020 Jacobs University is among the 25 percent of the best universities worldwide and is the most international university in Germany. In THE Young University Rankings 2019, Jacobs University is ranked 26th among young universities worldwide and among the top 5 in Germany.

It received top ratings in the categories of international alignment and research. According to USNWR's 2019 indicator rankings, Jacobs University was ranked as #364(tie) in Europe, #57 in Germany, Subject Chemistry #535(tie) worldwide. = Partnerships = The university closely cooperates with many local and international partners, including students exchange, faculty mobility, joint programs, and research collaborations. The partners include world-renowned institutions, such as: *North America (now US only): :Carnegie Mellon University :Rice University :New York University :University of Pennsylvania :Cornell University :Case Western Reserve University :University of Notre Dame *Europe: :University of Edinburgh, UK :University of Warwick, UK :University of Groningen, The Netherlands :Sciences Po, France :Uppsala University, Sweden :University of Oslo, Norway :St. Petersburg State University, Russia *Germany: :Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), Bremen :Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Marine Microbiology, Bremen :University of Bremen *Asia (Far & Middle East): :Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology, Israel :The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel :Ritsumeikan University, Japan :University of Nottingham Ningbo, China :Fudan University, Shanghai, China = Alumni Association = The Jacobs University Alumni Association was founded in 2004. It comprises around 2,400 members; around 70 percent of all graduates have joined the Alumni Association. In 2008 a limited company was founded as Jacobs University Bremen Alumni & Friends GmbH, laying the legal foundations to give the alumni a say in the university's development. The limited company, which is 99-percent owned by the Alumni Association, with one percent owned by the university, is one of three shareholders in Jacobs University and owns a sixth of the shares in the school. The president of the Alumni Association is also a member of the Board of Governors, thus taking a very active role in shaping the future of the institution.  Categorization of the study model  Jacobs University has combined features of typical US and German higher education institutions. US universities can be public or private and typically offer 4-year undergraduate programs. They charge high annual tuition fees and provide accommodation for students to live on campus. in contrast, most German universities are public and offer 3-year undergraduate programs in accordance with the Bologna Process. The majority of German universities does not charge tuition fees, but only collect a small service fee. Dormitories and meals are managed by Studentenwerk, a municipal student service organization independent of universities. Now Jacobs, a private university, offers 3-year undergraduate programs with less expensive tuition fees and provides accommodation on the residential campus for its student. A typical 4-year US program includes physical educations, requiring its students to take around four to five courses per semester. Like German universities, Jacobs's 3-year program offers athletics in the form of extracurricular activities. The average 30 ECTS per semester include more than 6 courses of soft skills training(e.g. language courses as additional competences). Jacobs also provides career advising as mandatory courses. The admission process of Jacobs University follows the US- American system.  Cooperation with Businesses  Jacobs University offers companies various opportunities for cooperation, which include long-term research collaborations, the provision of scientific services as part of short-term research and development projects, or training of junior and managerial staff.

He was the first non-Japanese judoka to win gold at the World Judo Championship, a feat he accomplished in 1961 and 1965. He was also an Olympic Champion, having won gold at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Japan, and won a record 21 European Judo Championships during his career. Judo career Geesink in 1956 Geesink took up judo aged 14 and by 17 started competing internationally, winning a silver medal in 1951. The following year, he won his first European title. Through to 1967, twenty more European titles followed. At the 1956 World Championships, Geesink was eliminated in the semi- finals against Yoshihiko Yoshimatsu. At the 1961 World Championships, Geesink, then 5th dan, became World Champion in the open class, defeating the Japanese champion Koji Sone. Japanese judokas had won all the World Championship titles contested up to that point. Judo debuted as an official sport at the 1964 Summer Olympics, which were held in the sport's home country, Japan. Although Japan dominated three of the four weight divisions (light, middle and heavy), Anton Geesink won the final of the open weight division, defeating Akio Kaminaga in front of his home crowd.Anton Geesink. sports-reference.com After winning the 1965 World Championships and a last European title in 1967, Geesink quit competitive judo. Anton Geesink was one of the few 10th Dan grade judoka (j≈´dan) recognized by the IJF but not by Kodokan at that rank. Promotions from 6th to 10th Dan are awarded for services to the sport of judo. In 2010 there are three living 10th dan grade judoka (j≈´dan) recognized by Kodokan: Toshiro Daigo, Ichiro Abe and Yoshimi Osawa. The Kodokan has not awarded the 10th Dan to anybody outside Japan. Professional wrestling career In October 1973, All Japan Pro Wrestling owner Giant Baba recruited Anton Geesink to join AJPW. Baba sent him to Amarillo, TX and Dory Funk Jr. and Terry Funk trained him for a month. He worked for All Japan from 1973 to 1978, as a popular part-timer. Geesink's notable professional wrestling opponents included Bruno Sammartino, Gorilla Monsoon, Dick Murdoch, Dory Funk Jr., Bobby Duncum, Bob Remus (Sgt. Slaughter), Don Leo Jonathan, and Jumbo Tsuruta. Films and publications Rififi in Amsterdam Geesink made his acting debut in 1962, playing a detective in the Dutch film Rififi in Amsterdam. In 1965 he starred as Samson in the Italian historical film Gideon and Samson: Great Leaders of the Bible, and in the 1970s-1980s took part in two Dutch TV series.Anton Geesink. IMDb In the 1960s he published several books on judo in Dutch and English.Anton Geesink. Google Books. International Olympic Committee work In 1987, Geesink became a member of the board of the Dutch National Olympic Committee, and a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Geesink was among the IOC members suspected of accepting bribes during the scandal surrounding the election of Salt Lake City as the host of the 2002 Winter Olympics. Geesink's name was cleared by the IOC which nevertheless issued him a warning for the appearance of a conflict of interest which could have damaged the reputation of the IOC. Geesink continued working for IOC until his death in 2010. Personal life and death Geesink with wife and children in 1964 Geesink was born and raised in Utrecht. His family was poor and he started work as a builder aged 12. He died in 2010 aged 76 in the town of his birth. He was survived by Jans Geesink, his wife of more than 50 years; his daughters Willy and Leni; and son Anton jr. .Nichols, Peter (6 September 2010) Anton Geesink obituary. The Guardian Honours Geesink was chosen as the Dutch Sportsman of the Year in 1957, 1961, 1964 and 1965. He was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the Japanese government in 1997.L'Harmattan web site (in French), Order with gold rays His home town of Utrecht has a street named after him ‚Äî which is the street he lived on for some time up until his death in August 2010.

Before the seventh generation of video game consoles, plugging in a controller into one of a console's controller ports were the primary means of using a game controller, although since then they have been replaced by wireless controllers, which do not require controller ports on the console but are battery-powered. USB game controllers could also be connected to a computer with a USB port. Input devices that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards, mouses, gamepads, joysticks, etc. Special purpose devices, such as steering wheels for driving games and light guns for shooting games, are also game controllers. Game controllers have been designed and improved over the years to be as user friendly as possible. The Microsoft Xbox controller, with its shoulder triggers that mimic actual triggers such as those found on guns, has become popular for shooting games. Some controllers are designed to be best for one type of game, such as steering wheels for driving games, or dance pads for dancing games. One of the first video game controllers was a simple dial and single button, used to control the game Tennis for Two. Controllers have since evolved to include directional pads, multiple buttons, analog sticks, joysticks, motion detection, touch screens and a plethora of other features.  Variants  = Gamepad = A Nintendo Switch Pro Controller :A gamepad, also known as a joypad, is held in both hands with thumbs and fingers used to provide input. Gamepads can have a number of action buttons combined with one or more omnidirectional control sticks or buttons. Action buttons are generally handled with the digits on the right hand, and the directional input handled with the left. Gamepads are the primary means of input on most modern video game consoles. Due to the ease of use and user-friendly nature of gamepads, they have spread from their origin on traditional consoles to computers, where a variety of games and emulators support their input as a replacement for keyboard and mouse input. Most modern game controllers are a variation of a standard gamepad. Common additions include shoulder buttons placed along the edges of the pad, centrally placed buttons labeled start, select, and mode, and an internal motor to provide haptic feedback. :As modern game controllers advance, so too do their user ability qualities. Typically, the controllers become smaller and more compact to more easily, and comfortably, fit within the user's hand. Modern examples can be drawn from systems such as Xbox, whose controller has transformed subtly, yet dramatically, from the original Xbox 360 controller to the Xbox One controller introduced in 2013. : = Paddle = Paddle controllers were popular early in the 2nd console generation for Pong games. : A paddle is a controller that features a round wheel and one or more fire buttons. The wheel is typically used to control movement of the player or of an object along one axis of the video screen. As the user turns the wheel further from the default position, the speed of control in the game become more intensive. Paddle controllers were the first analog controllers and they lost popularity when \\"paddle and ball\\" type games fell out of favor. A variation, the Atari driving controller, appeared on the Atari 2600. Designed specifically for the game Indy 500, it functioned almost identically in operation and design to the regular paddle controller. The exceptions were that its wheel could be continuously rotated in either direction, and that it was missing the extra paddle included on the previous model. Unlike a spinner, friction prevented the wheel from gaining momentum. = Joystick = PlayStation arcade style controller for the Sega Dreamcast. :A joystick is a peripheral that consists of a handheld stick that can be tilted around either of two axes and (sometimes) twisted around a third. The joystick is often used for flight simulators. HOTAS (hands on throttle and stick) controllers, composed of a joystick and throttle quadrant (see below) are a popular combination for flight simulation among its most fanatic devotees. Most joysticks are designed to be operated with the user's primary hand (e.g. with the right hand of a right-handed person), with the base either held in the opposite hand or mounted on a desk. Arcade controllers are typically joysticks featuring a shaft that has a ball or drop-shaped handle, and one or more buttons for in game actions. Generally the layout has the joystick on the left, and the buttons on the right, although there are instances when this is reversed. = Trackball = : A trackball is a smooth sphere that is manipulated with the palm of one's hand. The user can roll the ball in any direction to control the cursor. It has the advantage that it can be faster than a mouse depending on the speed of rotation of the physical ball. Another advantage is that it requires less space than a mouse, which the trackball was a precursor of. Notable uses of a Trackball as a gaming controller would be games such as Centipede, Marble Madness, Golden Tee Golf and SegaSonic the Hedgehog. = Throttle quadrant = : A throttle quadrant is a set of one or more levers that are most often used to simulate throttles or other similar controls in a real vehicle, particularly an aircraft. Throttle quadrants are most popular in conjunction with joysticks or yokes used in flight simulation. = Steering wheel = A Logitech steering wheel for the PlayStation 3 :A Racing wheel, essentially a larger version of a paddle, is used in most racing arcade games as well as more recent racing simulators such as Live for Speed, Grand Prix Legends, GTR2, and Richard Burns Rally. While most arcade racing games have been using steering wheels since Gran Trak 10 in 1974, the first steering wheels for home systems appeared on fifth-generation consoles such as the PlayStation and Nintendo 64. Many are force feedback (see Force Feedback Wheel), designed to give the same feedback as would be experienced when driving a real car, but the realism of this depends on the game. They usually come with pedals to control the gas and brake. Shifting is taken care of in various ways including paddle shifting systems, simple stick shifters which are moved forward or back to change gears or more complex shifters which mimic those of real vehicles, which may also use a clutch. Most wheels turn only 200 to 270 degrees lock-to-lock but some models, such as the Logitech Driving Force Pro, Logitech G25 and Logitech G27 can turn 900 degrees, or 2.5 turns, lock-to-lock. The Namco Jogcon paddle was available for the PlayStation game R4: Ridge Racer Type 4. Unlike \\"real\\" video game steering wheels, the Jogcon was designed to fit in the player's hand. Its much smaller wheel (diameter roughly similar to a soda can's) resembles the jog-and-shuttle control wheel used on some VCRs. The Nintendo Wii game Mario Kart Wii is bundled with the Wii Wheel: a steering wheel-shaped shell that the Wii Remote is placed inside thus using the Wii Remote's motion sensing capabilities to control the kart during the game. Hori also has a steering wheel that is made for the Nintendo 3DS game Mario Kart 7. When the steering wheel is placed on the back of the console, then it will have the same ability as in Mario Kart Wii by using the gyroscope in first-person mode. = Yoke = : A yoke is very similar to a steering wheel except that it resembles the control yoke found on many aircraft and has two axes of movement: not only rotational movement about the shaft of the yoke, but also a forward-and-backward axis equivalent to that of pitch control on the yoke of an aircraft. Some yokes have additional controls attached directly to the yoke for simulation of aircraft functions such as radio push-to-talk buttons. Some flight simulator sets that include yokes also come with various other aircraft controls such as throttle quadrants and pedals. These sets, including the yoke, are intended to be used in a flight simulator. = Pedals = :Logitech Driving Force GTPedals may be used for driving simulations or flight simulations and often ships with a steering- wheel-type input device. In the former case, an asymmetric set of pedals can simulate accelerator, brake, and clutch pedals in a real automobile. In the latter case, a symmetric set of pedals simulates rudder controls and toe brakes in an aircraft. As mentioned, most steering wheel controllers come with a set of pedals. There are also variations of the pedal controller such as the proposed rotating pedal device for a cycling game, which relies on an ergometer to generate user inputs such as pedal rpm and pedal resistance. A variation of this concept surfaced in 2016 when a startup called VirZoom debuted a set of sensors that can be installed in the pedal and handlebars, turning a physical bike into one controller for games on the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift virtual reality (VR) platforms. The same concept is behind a product called Cyber ExerCycle, which is a set of sensors attached to the pedal and connected to the PC via USB for bicycle simulation games such as NetAthlon and Fuel. WASD keyboard setup is used widely, but by no means universally. = Mouse and keyboard = : A mouse and computer keyboard are typical input devices for a personal computer and are currently the main game controllers for computer games. The mouse is often used with a mousepad to achieve greater speed, comfort, accuracy and smoother movement for the gamer. Some video game consoles also have the ability to function with a keyboard and a mouse. The computer keyboard is modelled after the typewriter keyboard and was designed for the input of written text. A mouse is a handheld pointing device used in addition to the keyboard. For games, the keyboard typically controls movement of the character while the mouse is used to control the game camera or used for aiming. While originally designed for general computer input, there are several keyboard and mouse peripherals available which are designed specifically for gaming, often with gaming-specific functions built- in. Examples include peripherals by Razer, the \\"Zboard\\" range of keyboards and Logitech's 'G' series. The numeric keypad found on the keyboard is also used as a game controller and can be found on a number of separate devices, most notably early consoles, usually attached to a joystick or a paddle. The keypad is a small grid of keys with at least the digits 0-9. A Gaming keypad is a specialized controller used for FPSs, RTSs and some arcade type games. These controllers can be programmed to allow the emulation of keys, and macros in some cases. These generally resemble a small part of a keyboard but may also feature other inputs such as analog sticks. They were developed because some of these games require a keyboard to play, and some players find this to be awkward for such a task. = Touchscreen = :Nintendo DS touchscreen (bottom) with stylus.A touchscreen is an input device that allows the user to interact with the computer by touching the display screen. The first attempt at a handheld game console with touchscreen controls was Sega's intended successor to the Game Gear, though the device was ultimately shelved and never released due to the high cost of touchscreen technology in the early 1990s. The first released console to use a touchscreen was the Tiger game.com in 1997. Nintendo popularized it for use in video games with the Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS; other systems including the Tapwave Zodiac as well as Smartphones and the vast majority of PDAs have also included this feature. The primary controller for Nintendo's Wii U console, the Wii U GamePad, features an embedded touchscreen. Modern touch screens use a thin, durable, transparent plastic sheet overlaid onto a glass screen. The location of a touch is calculated from the capacitance for the X and Y axes, which varies based upon where the sheet is touched. One console that is touchscreen, but is not manufactured by Nintendo is Sony's PlayStation Vita which has a 5 inch OLED touchscreen. The Nintendo Switch features a 6.2 inch touchscreen. = Breathing controllers = : Breathing controllers help their users improve breathing through video games. All controllers have sensors that sense users breath, with which user controls video game on computer, tablet or on smartphone. Alvio is a breathing trainer, symptom tracker and mobile game controller. Zenytime promotes deep, rhythmic breathing to trigger short-term rewards of controlled breathing (relaxation, improved oxygenation...). Breathing games by Breathing Labs are based on Pursed lip breathing and are used on iPhone / iPad, Windows, macOS and Android devices. = Motion sensing = Wii Remote. : Motion controllers include the Sega Activator, released in 1993 for the Mega Drive (Genesis). Based on the Light Harp invented by Assaf Gurner, it could read the player's physical movements and was the first controller to allow full-body motion sensing. However, it was a commercial failure due to its \\"unwieldiness and inaccuracy\\". Nintendo's Wii system released in 2006 utilizes the Wii Remote controller, which uses accelerometers to detect its approximate orientation and acceleration and an image sensor, so it can be used as a pointing device. The Sixaxis, DualShock 3, and PlayStation Move controllers for Sony's PlayStation 3 system have similar motion sensing capabilities. In 2010, Microsoft released the Kinect for the Xbox 360. This motion sensing controller uses cameras to track a players movement. Microsoft released a revised version of the Kinect with the launch of the Xbox One. This controller was bundled with the console on launch, and was removed from the default bundle in June 2014. Sony's EyeToy similarly uses cameras to detect the player's motions and translate them into inputs for the game. = Light gun = The Dreamcast light gun : A light gun is a peripheral used to \\"shoot\\" targets on a screen. They usually roughly resemble firearms or ray guns. Their use is normally limited to rail shooters, or shooting gallery games like Duck Hunt and those which came with the Shooting Gallery light gun. A rare example of a non-rail first person shooter game is Taito's 1992 video game Gun Buster, a first-person shooter that used a joystick to move and a light gun to aim. Though light guns have been used in earlier arcade games such as Sega's Periscope in 1966Ashcraft, Brian (2008), Arcade Mania! The Turbo Charged World of Japan's Game Centers, p. 133, Kodansha International and Missile in 1969, the first home console light gun was released for the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972; later on, Nintendo would include one standard on their Famicom and NES, called the NES Zapper. Nintendo has also released a \\"shell\\" in the style of a light gun for the more recent Wii Remote called the Wii Zapper which comes bundled with the game Link's Crossbow Training. = Rhythm game controllers = Guitar controllers. : A Rhythm game accessories used for rhythm games can resemble musical instruments, such as guitars (from 5-button guitars in Guitar Freaks, the Guitar Hero series, the Rock Band series to real guitars in Rock Band 3 and Rocksmith), keyboards (Rock Band 3), drums (Donkey Konga, Drum Mania, the Rock Band series and the Guitar Hero series), or maracas (Samba de Amigo) have also seen some success in arcades and home consoles. Other rhythm games are based around the art of Djing or turntablism (DJ Hero), or playing a synthesizer (IIDX) using a turntable shaped peripheral with buttons. = Wireless = : Wireless versions of many popular controller types (joypads, mice, keyboards) exist, and wireless motion controls are an emerging class for virtual reality. = Others = * Pinball controllers and multi-button consoles for strategy games were released in the past, but their popularity was limited to hardcore fans of the genre. * Dance pads, essentially a grid of flat pressure-sensitive gamepad buttons set on a mat meant to be stepped on, have seen niche success with the popularity of rhythm games like Dance Dance Revolution and Pump It Up. The dance pad was first introduced by Bandai on the Famicom in 1986 as a part of their \\"Family Fun Fitness\\" set, then Exus released the \\"Foot Craz\\" pad for the Atari 2600 in 1987. Nintendo purchased the technology from Bandai in 1988 and used it on their \\"Power Pad\\", for the Famicom and NES. * Balance board: The Wii Balance Board comes with the game Wii Fit. This was preceded by decades by the Joyboard, made to plug into an Atari 2600, to play skiing and surfing games. * Buzzers: A recent example of specialized, while very simple, game controllers, is the four large \\"buzzers\\" (round buttons) supplied with the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 quiz show game series Buzz! (2005‚Äìpresent); both game and controllers clearly being inspired by the television show genre. * NeGcon: is a unique controller for racing games on the PlayStation. Physically it resembles a gamepad, but its left and right halves twist relative to each other, making it a variation of the paddle controller. * Microphone: A few games have made successes in using a headset or microphone as a secondary controller, such as Hey You, Pikachu!, the Rock Band series, the Guitar Hero series, the SingStar series, Tom Clancy's Endwar, the Mario Party series, and the SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs series. The use of these microphones allowed players to issue commands to the game, controlling teammates (as in SOCOM) and other AI characters (e.g., Pikachu). The Nintendo DS features a microphone that is built into the system. It has been used for a variety of purposes, including speech recognition (Nintendogs, Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!), chatting online between and during gameplay sessions (Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl), and minigames that require the player to blow or shout into the microphone (Feel the Magic: XY/XX, WarioWare: Touched!, Mario Party DS). * Steel Battalion for the Xbox was bundled with a full dashboard, with 2 joysticks and over 30 buttons, in an attempt to make it feel like an actual mecha simulator. * Fishing rod: the first fishing rod controller appeared as an accessory for the Dreamcast video console for playing Sega Marine Fishing. Later other games for PlayStation console use also a similar controllers. * Floating Interactive Display: at least two commercial systems (Heliodisplay and FogScreen) offer interactive \\"floating interfaces\\" which display an image projected in mid-air but can be interacted with by finger similar to a touch screen. * Mind-controlled headset: As of March 24, 2007 a United States/Australian company called Emotiv Systems began launching a mind-controlled device for video games based on electroencephalography. It was reported by The Wall Street Journal's Don Clark on MSNBC. * PCGamerBike similar to a pair of pedals removed from an exercise bike, then set down in front of a chair & used to precisely control game characters instead. * Optical motion tracking systems such as TrackIR and FreeTrack use a video camera to track an infrared illuminated or emissive headpiece. Small head movements are tracked and then translated into much larger virtual in-game movements, allowing hands-free view control and improved immersiveness. * Mechanical motion tracking systems like Gametrak use cables attached to gloves for tracking position of physical elements in three- dimensional space in real time. The Gametrak mechanism contains a retracting cable reel and a small tubular guide arm from which the cable passes out. The guide arm is articulated in a ball joint such that the arm and ball follow the angle at which the cable extends from the mechanism. The distance of the tracked element from the mechanism is determined through components which measure the rotation of the spool drum for the retracting cable reel, and calculating how far the cable is extended. * Exoskeleton controllers use exoskeleton technology to provide the player with different responses based on the player's body position, speed of movement, and other sensed data. In addition to audio and visual responses, an exoskeleton controller may provide a controlled resistance to movement and other stimuli to provide realism to the action. This not only lets players feel as if they are actually performing the function, but also helps reinforce the correct muscle pattern for the activity being simulated. The Forcetek XIO is an example of an exoskeleton video game controller. * Instrument panels are simulated aircraft instrument panels, either generic or specific to a real aircraft, that are used in place of the keyboard to send commands to a flight simulation program. Some of these are far more expensive than all the rest of a computer system combined. The panels usually only simulate switches, buttons, and controls, rather than output instrument displays. ** Train controls: Other instrument panel like hardware such as train controls have been produced. The \\"RailDriver\\" for example is designed to work with Trainz, Microsoft Train Simulator and Kuju Rail Simulator. (as of January 2009) it is limited in ease of use by the lack of a Windows API for some of the software it is designed to work with. A train controller for a Taito bullet train sim has also been made for the Wii console. * R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy) is an accessory for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), which allowed players to interact with NES games by controlling the robot. Known in Japan as the Famicom Robot, this short- lived accessory jumpstarted Nintendo's involvement in the western market, though only used for Stack-Up and Gyromite. It has been considered a \\"Trojan horse\\" for getting NESs into stores during the video game market crash of 1983 and the accessory was called by GameSpy the fifth greatest video game marketing move within twenty-five. As a character, R.O.B. appeared in later Nintendo games such as Mario Kart DS and Super Smash Bros. Brawl. * The Sega Toylet, an interactive urinal, uses urine as a control method; pressure sensors in the bowl translate the flow of urine into on-screen action.  Use on PCs  Gamepads typically require device drivers if used on contemporary personal computers. The device may be treated as its own class of human interface device, or by use of a program known as a gamepad translator (or gamepad mapper) translated to key strokes or mouse actions. An example gamepad translator for Microsoft Windows is Xpadder, or antimicro which is free and open-source and cross-platform. Sometimes support for mapping to different devices is built into the controller itself, as with the Nostromo SpeedPad n52, which can act as either a keyboard, mouse, joystick or as a hybrid between the three.

An example in English is the vowel sound of the \\"a\\" in the word about. Schwa in English is mainly found in unstressed positions, but in some other languages it occurs more frequently as a stressed vowel. In relation to certain languages, the name \\"schwa\\" and the symbol may be used for some other unstressed and toneless neutral vowel, not necessarily mid central. Etymology The word schwa is from the Hebrew ' ( , classical pronunciation: ' ), the name of niqqud sign used to indicate the phoneme. The term was introduced by German linguists in the 19th century, and so the spelling sch is German in origin. It was first used in English texts between 1890 and 1895. The symbol was used first by Johann Andreas Schmeller for the reduced vowel at the end of the German name Gabe. Alexander John Ellis, in his pal√¶otype alphabet, used it for the similar English sound in but . The origin of the symbol is an e turned 180 degrees. Description Sometimes the term \\"schwa\\" is used for any epenthetic vowel, but some languages use different epenthetic vowels (Navajo uses ). In English, schwa is the most common vowel sound.Rachael-Anne Knight(2012), Phonetics: A course book, Cambridge University Press, p.71. It is a reduced vowel in many unstressed syllables especially if syllabic consonants are not used. Depending on dialect, it may be written using any of the following letters: *'a', as in about *'e', as in taken *'i', as in pencil *'o', as in memory *'u', as in supply *'y', as in sibyl *unwritten, as in rhythm Schwa is a very short neutral vowel sound, and like all other vowels, its precise quality varies depending on the adjacent consonants. In most varieties of English, schwa occurs almost exclusively in unstressed syllables. (There is also an open-mid central unrounded vowel or \\"long schwa\\", represented as , which occurs in some non-rhotic dialect stressed syllables, as in bird and alert.) In New Zealand English, the high front lax vowel (as in the word bit ) has shifted open and back to sound like schwa, and both stressed and unstressed schwas exist. To a certain extent, that is true for South African English as well. In General American English, schwa and are the two vowel sounds that can be r-colored (rhotacized); r-colored schwa is used in words with unstressed \\"er\\" syllables, such as dinner. See also stress and vowel reduction in English. Welsh uses the letter to represent schwa, which is a phonemic vowel rather than the realisation of an unstressed vowel. The letter represents schwa in all positions except in final syllables where it represents or . For example, the word ysbyty (\\"hospital\\") is pronounced . Quite a few languages have a sound similar to schwa. It is similar to a short French unaccented , which is rounded and less central, more like an open-mid or close-mid front rounded vowel. It is almost always unstressed, but Albanian, Bulgarian, Slovene and Afrikaans are some of the languages that allow stressed schwas. In most dialects of Russian unstressed and reduce to either or schwa. In dialects of Kashubian a schwa occurs in place of the Old Polish short consonants u, i, y. Many Caucasian languages and some Uralic languages (like Komi) also use phonemic schwa, and allow schwas to be stressed. In the Eastern dialects of Catalan, including the standard variety, based in the dialect spoken in and around Barcelona, an unstressed or is pronounced as a schwa (called \\"vocal neutra\\", 'neutral vowel'). A stressed schwa can occur in the Catalan dialects spoken in the Balearic Islands, as well as in Romanian, as in mƒÉturƒÉ ('broom'). In European and some African dialects of Portuguese, the schwa occurs in many unstressed syllables that end in , such as noite ('night'), tarde ('afternoon'), p√™ssego ('peach'), and pecado ('sin'). However, that is rare in Brazilian Portuguese except in such areas as Curitiba in Paran√°. In Neapolitan, a final, unstressed , and unstressed and are pronounced as a schwa: p√¨zza ('pizza'), semm√†na ('week'), purtu√†llo ('orange'). The inherent vowel in the Devanagari script, an abugida used to write Hindi, Marathi, Nepali and Sanskrit is a schwa, written either in isolation or word-initially. Other characters used to represent this sound include in Armenian, in Romanian, and in Albanian. In Bulgarian Cyrillic, the letter , which has a very different orthographic function in Modern Russian, is used. In languages such as Polish and Spanish there is no such sound that would resemble the \\"schwa\\" characteristics. In most Sanskrit-based languages, the schwa is the implied vowel after every consonant and so has no didactic marks. For example, in Hindi, the character ‡§ï is pronounced \\"k…ô\\" without marking, but ‡§ï‡•á is pronounced \\"ke\\" (pronounced \\"kay\\") with a marking. A subscript small schwa (‚Çî) is used in Indo-European studies. Examples =Albanian= In Albanian, schwa is represented by the letter , which is also one of the letters of the Albanian alphabet, coming right after the letter . It can be stressed like in words i √´mb√´l and √´nd√´rr ('sweet' and 'dream', respectively). =Armenian= In Armenian, schwa is represented by the letter ’® (capital ‘∏). It is occasionally word-initial but usually word-final, as a form of the definite article. Unwritten schwa sounds are also inserted to split initial consonant clusters; for example, ’≥’∂’≥’≤’∏÷Ç’Ø (ƒçnƒç≈Çuk) [t É º…ônt É º…ô' Åuk] 'sparrow'. =Azerbaijani= In the Azerbaijani alphabet, the schwa character …ô is used, but to represent the √¶ sound. =Catalan= In Catalan, schwa is represented by the letters a or e in unstressed syllables: \\"pare\\" (father), \\"Barcelona\\" . In the Balearic Islands, the sound is sometimes also in stressed vowels, \\"pera\\" (pear). =Dutch= In Dutch, the digraph in the suffix -lijk , as in waarschijnlijk ('probably') is pronounced as a schwa. If an falls at the ultimate (or penultimate) place before a consonant in Dutch words and is unstressed, it becomes a schwa, as in the verb ending \\"-en\\" (lopen) and the diminutive suffix \\"-tje(s)\\" (tafeltje(s)). =German= In German, schwa is respresented by the letter e and occurs only in unstressed syllables, as in gegessene. Schwa is not native to Bavarian dialects of German spoken in Southern Germany, as well as Austria. Vowels that are realized as schwa in standard german change to -e, -…ê, or -…õ. In compound words, like Fernweh, and borrowed terms, like Effekt, unstressed e is not reduced and retains its usual value of /eÀê/ (if long) or /…õ/ (if short). =Korean= The schwa is rarely used in Korean phonology. It is an alternative form of  å. For example, Ìò∏Îñ° (hotteok) [ho.tÕà…ôkÃö]. =Madurese= In Madurese, some words with /a/, usually in nonfinal position, would be pronounced as the schwa. When writing Madurese in its traditional abugida, Hanacaraka, words as such would not be written with a vowel diacritic that denote that it is a schwa. Nowadays, even after the Madurese people have adopted the Latin alphabet, such writing fashion is still used. Examples: * \\"Jhabah\\" (/d í…ôb…ôh/) ‚Äì Javanese, Java Island * \\"sagara\\" (/sag…ôr…ô/) ‚Äì sea,ocean * \\"lajar\\" (/l…ôd í…ôr/) ‚Äì to sail * \\"Sorbaja\\" (/sorb…ôd í…ô/) ‚Äì Surabaya * \\"Madura\\" (/madur…ô/) ‚Äì Madurese, Madura Island * \\"Bulan\\" (/bul…ôn/) ‚Äì Moon =Malay= In the Indonesian variant, schwa is always unstressed except for Jakarta- influenced informal Indonesian whose schwa can be stressed. In final closed syllables in the formal register, the vowel is a (the final syllable is usually the second syllable since most Indonesian root words consist of two syllables). In some cases, the vowel a is pronounced as a stressed schwa (only when the vowel a is located between two consonants in a syllable), but never in formal speech: *datang (=come), pronounced , and often written as dateng in informal writing. *kental (=viscous), pronounced . *hitam (=black), pronounced , written as item in informal language. *dalam (=deep, in), pronounced , often written as dalem. *malam (=night), pronounced , written as malem in informal language. Indonesian orthography formerly used unmarked only for the schwa sound, and the full vowel /e/ was written . Malaysian orthography, on the other hand, formerly indicated the schwa with (called pƒïpƒït), and unmarked stood for /e/. In the 1972 spelling reform that unified Indonesian and Malaysian spelling conventions (Ejaan yang Disempurnakan, regulated by MABBIM), it was agreed to use neither diacritic.Asmah Haji Omar, There is no longer an orthographic distinction between /…ô/ and /e/; both are spelled with an unmarked . For example, the word for 'wheeled vehicle' in Indonesia and Malaysia, which was formerly spelled ker√©ta in Indonesia and kƒïreta in Malaysia, is now spelled kereta in both countries. This means that the pronunciation of any given letter e in both Indonesian and Malaysian variants is not immediately obvious to the learner and must be learned separately. However, in a number of Indonesian dictionaries and lesson books for foreign learners, the notation is preserved to help learners. In Southern Malaysian pronunciation, which is predominant in common Malaysian media, the final letter -a represents schwa, and final -ah stands for /a/. The dialect of Kedah in northern Malaysia, however, pronounces final -a as /a/ also. In loanwords, a nonfinal short /a/ may become schwa in Malay such as Mekah ( The phenomenon has been termed the \\"schwa deletion rule\\" of Hindi. One formalization of the rule has been summarized as …ô -> √∏  VC_CV. In other words, when a vowel- preceded consonant is followed by a vowel-succeeded consonant, the schwa inherent in the first consonant is deleted. However, the formalization is inexact and incomplete (it sometimes deletes a schwa that exists, and it fails to delete some schwas that it should) and so can yield errors. Schwa deletion is computationally important because it is essential to building text-to- speech software for Hindi. As a result of schwa syncope, the correct Hindi pronunciation of many words differs from that expected from a literal rendering of Devanagari. For instance, ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ is RƒÅm (expected: RƒÅma), ‡§∞‡§ö‡§®‡§æ is RachnƒÅ (expected: RachanƒÅ), ‡§µ‡•á‡§¶ is Vƒìd (expected: Vƒìda) and ‡§®‡§Æ‡§ï‡•Ä‡§® is Namkƒ´n (expected: Namakƒ´na). Correct schwa deletion is critical also because the same Devanagari letter sequence can sometimes be pronounced two different ways in Hindi depending on the context: failure to delete the appropriate schwas can then change the meaning. For instance, the sequence ‡§ß‡§°‡§º‡§ï‡§®‡•á in ‡§¶‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§ß‡§°‡§º‡§ï‡§®‡•á ‡§≤‡§ó‡§æ (\\"the heart started beating\\") and in ‡§¶‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ß‡§°‡§º‡§ï‡§®‡•á‡§Ç (\\"beats of the heart\\") is identical prior to the nasalization in the second usage. However, it is pronounced dhadak.ne in the first and dhad.kane·πÅ in the second. While native speakers correctly pronounce the sequence differently in different contexts, non-native speakers and voice-synthesis software can make them \\"sound very unnatural\\", making it \\"extremely difficult for the listener\\" to grasp the intended meaning. =American English= Some forms of American English have the tendency to delete a schwa when it appears in a midword syllable that comes after the stressed syllable. Kenstowicz (1994) states, \\"American English schwa deletes in medial posttonic syllables\\". He gives as examples words such as sep(a)rate (as an adjective), choc(o)late, cam(e)ra and elab(o)rate (as an adjective), where the schwa (represented by the letters in parentheses) has a tendency to be deleted. Other examples include fam(i)ly , ev(e)ry , and diff(e)rent . =French= Schwa is deleted in certain positions in French.

He is known for his photographic projects that take an intimate, satirical and anthropological look at aspects of modern life, in particular documenting the social classes of England, and more broadly the wealth of the Western world. His major projects have been rural communities (1975‚Äì1982), The Last Resort (1983‚Äì1985), The Cost of Living (1987‚Äì1989), Small World (1987‚Äì1994) and Common Sense (1995‚Äì1999). Since 1994, Parr has been a member of Magnum Photos. He has had around 40 solo photobooks published, and has featured in around 80 exhibitions worldwide ‚Äì including the international touring exhibition ParrWorld, and a retrospective at the Barbican Arts Centre, London, in 2002. The Martin Parr Foundation, founded in 2014, opened premises in his hometown of Bristol in 2017. It houses his own archive, his collection of British and Irish photography by other photographers, and a gallery. Life and career Parr in 2014 =Personal life= Born in Epsom, Surrey, Parr wanted to become a documentary photographer from the age of fourteen. He cites his grandfather, George Parr, an amateur photographer and fellow of the Royal Photographic Society, as an early influence. He married Susan Mitchell and they have one child, Ellen Parr (born 1986). =Photographer= Parr has said of his photography: > The fundamental thing I'm exploring constantly is the difference between the > mythology of the place and the reality of it. ... Remember I make serious > photographs disguised as entertainment. That's part of my mantra. I make the > pictures acceptable to find the audience but deep down there is actually a > lot going on that's not sharply written in your face. If you want to read it > you can read it. Parr's aesthetic is close-up, through use of a macro lens, and employing saturated colour, a result of either the type of film and/or use of a ring flash. This allows him to put his subjects \\"under the microscope\\" in their own environment, giving them space to expose their lives and values in ways that often involve inadvertent humour. His technique, as seen in his book Signs of the Times: A Portrait of the Nation's Tastes (1992), has been said to leave viewers with ambiguous emotional reactions, unsure whether to laugh or cry. Manchester Polytechnic, 1970‚Äì1973 Parr studied photography at Manchester Polytechnic from 1970 to 1972 with contemporaries Daniel Meadows and Brian Griffin. Parr and Meadows collaborated on various projects, including working at Butlin's as roving photographers. They were part of a new wave of documentary photographers, \\"a loose British grouping, which, though it never gave itself a title have become variously known as 'the Young British Photographers', 'Independent Photographers' and the 'New British Photography'.\\" Rural communities, West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Ireland, 1975‚Äì1982 In 1975 Parr moved to Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire where he would complete his first mature work. He was involved with the Albert Street Workshop, a hub for artistic activity which included a darkroom and exhibition space. Parr spent five years photographing rural life in the area, focusing on the Methodist (and some Baptist) non-conformist chapels, a focal point for isolated farming communities that in the early 1970s were closing down. He photographed in black-and-white, for its nostalgic nature and for it being appropriate to his celebratory look at this past activity. Also, photographers at that time were obliged to work in black-and-white to be taken seriously, colour being associated with commercial and snapshot photography. His series The Non-Conformists was widely exhibited at the time and published as a book in 2013. Critic Sean O'Hagan, writing in The Guardian, said \\"It's easy to forget how quietly observational Parr was as a black-and-white photographer.\\" In 1980 Parr married Susan Mitchell and, for her work, they moved to the west coast of Ireland. He set up a darkroom in Boyle, County Roscommon. Parr's first publications, Bad Weather, published in 1982 by Zwemmer with an Arts Council subsidy, Calderdale Photographs (1984) and A Fair Day: Photographs from the West Coast of Ireland (1984), all featured photographs from mostly northern England, and Ireland, in black-and-white. He used a Leica M3 with a 35 mm lens; although for Bad Weather he quickly switched to an underwater camera with a flashgun. The working class, The Last Resort, 1982‚Äì1985 In 1982 Parr and his wife moved to Wallasey, England, and he switched permanently to colour photography, inspired by the work of US colour photographers, mostly Joel Meyerowitz, but also William Eggleston and Stephen Shore, and also the British Peter Fraser and Peter Mitchell. Parr has written that \\"I had also encountered the post cards of John Hinde when I worked at Butlin's in the early 70s and the bright saturated colour of these had a big impact on me.\\" During the summers of 1983, 1984 and 1985 he photographed working-class people at the seaside in nearby New Brighton. This work was published in the book The Last Resort: Photographs of New Brighton (1986) and exhibited in Liverpool and London. Although John Bulmer had pioneered colour documentary photography of Britain, from 1965, Gerry Badger has said of The Last Resort: > It is difficult from a perspective of almost a quarter of a century to > underestimate [sic] the significance of The Last Resort, either in British > photography or Martin Parr's career. For both, it represented a seismic > change in the basic mode of photographic expression, from monochrome to > colour, a fundamental technical change that heralded the development of a > new tone in documentary photography. Karen Wright, writing in The Independent, has said \\"He was attacked by some critics for his scrutiny of the working classes, but looking at these works, one merely sees Parr's unflinching eye capturing the truth of a social class embracing leisure in whatever form available.\\"\\"In The Studio: Martin Parr, photographer\\", The Independent. The middle class, The Cost of Living (1987‚Äì1989) In 1985 Parr completed a commission for the Documentary Photography Archive in Manchester to photograph people at supermarkets in Salford, Retailing in the Borough of Salford, which is now held at the archive. He and his wife moved to Bristol in 1987, where they still live. During 1987 and 1988 he completed his next major project, on the middle class, who were at that time becoming increasingly affluent under Thatcherism. He photographed middle-class activities such as shopping, dinner parties and school open days, predominantly around Bristol and Bath in the southwest of England. It was published as his next book The Cost of Living (1989) and exhibited in Bath, London, Oxford and Paris. His book One Day Trip (1989) featured photographs taken when he accompanied people on a booze cruise to France, a commission from Mission Photographique Transmanche. Mass tourism, Small World (1987‚Äì1994) Between 1987 and 1994 Parr travelled internationally to make his next major series, a critique of mass tourism,\\"Portfolio: Martin Parr\\", The Independent.The book Small World is reproduced at the Magnum Photos website. published as Small World in 1995. A revised edition with additional photographs was published in 2007. It was exhibited in 1995‚Äì1996 in London, Paris, Edinburgh, and Palma in Spain and has continued to be shown in various locations since. He was visiting professor of photography at the University of Art and Design in Helsinki between 1990 and 1992. Global consumerism, Common Sense (1995‚Äì1999) Between 1995 and 1999 Parr made the series Common Sense about global consumerism. Common Sense was an exhibition of 350 prints, and a book published in 1999 with 158 images. The exhibition was first shown in 1999 and was staged simultaneously in forty- one venues in seventeen countries. The pictures depict the minutiae of consumer culture, and are intended to show the ways in which people entertain themselves. The photographs were taken with 35 mm ultra-saturated film for its vivid, heightened colours. =Magnum Photos= Parr joined Magnum Photos as an associate member in 1988. The vote on his inclusion as a full member in 1994 was divisive, with Philip Jones Griffiths circulating a plea to other members not to admit him.Russell Miller, Magnum: Fifty Years at the Front Line of History (London: Pimlico, 1997; ). Here at Google Books. Retrieved 10 April 2014. Parr achieved the necessary two-thirds majority by one vote. Magnum membership helped him work on editorial photography, and on editorial fashion photography for Paul Smith, Louis Vuitton, Galerie du jour Agn√®s B. and Madame Figaro.\\"On the Beach with Martin Parr\\", The New Yorker. In 2014 Parr was voted in as president of Magnum Photos International, a post he held for 3.5 years until 2017. =Collector= Photobooks Parr is a collector and critic of photobooks.Imagine (TV series), Season 2, Episode 4, The World According to Parr, 3 December 2003 His collaboration with the critic Gerry Badger, The Photobook: A History (in three volumes) covers more than 1,000 examples of photobooks from the 19th century through to the present day. The first two volumes took eight years to complete. Tate Modern's retrospective exhibition of Daido Moriyama in London included many Moriyama books loaned from Parr displayed in vitrines. Other items Parr also collects postcards, photographs and various other items of vernacular and popular culture such as wallpaper, Saddam Hussein watches and prostitute advertising cards from phoneboxes (items with a photograph on them). Here too, items from his collections have been used as the basis for publications and exhibitions. Since the 1970s, Parr has collected and publicised the garish postcards made between the 1950s and 1970s by John Hinde and his team of photographers. =Curator= Parr was guest artistic director for the 2004 Rencontres d'Arles festival of photography, guest curator of the New Typologies exhibition at the 2008 New York Photo Festival, and guest curator of Brighton Photo Biennial in 2010, which he called New Documents. Critic Sean O'Hagan, writing in The Guardian, said \\"Back in 2004, he was invited by the organisers of the annual Rencontres D'Arles to be guest curator. That year's Arles festival, in its range and ambition, remains the standard by which all subsequent Rencontres have been judged.\\" Parr was artistic director of the newly established Bristol Photo Festival, scheduled to open in 2021. However in July 2020 he quit, due to his involvement with a 2018 reissue of the photobook London by Gian Butturini, after a campaign by an anthropology student at University College London, who called a pairing of photographs in it racist. =Film and television= Parr has been involved in making television, and documentary and other films. From 1990 to 1992 Parr collaborated with Nick Barker, taking photographs to accompany Barker's film Signs of the Times. In 1997, Parr began producing his own television documentaries with Mosaic Film. In 2003 Parr was the subject of and appeared extensively in the Imagine BBC One TV series episode The World According to Parr, directed and produced by Rebecca Frayn, and hosted and executive produced by Alan Yentob. He was cameraman on the film It's Nice Up North (2006) with comedian Graham Fellows (as his character John Shuttleworth). The film is a comic documentary filmed over several years in Shetland. In 2007 Parr took part in BBC Four's The Genius of Photography, a six-part documentary series exploring the history of photography. In 2008 he was one of three judges on the Channel 4 series Picture This. In 2014 Parr created \\"Turkey and Tinsel\\", a 60-minute deadpan and often hilarious observational video documentary about faux Christmas in small town England. =Teaching= In 2004 Parr was appointed professor of photography at the University of Wales, Newport. In 2013 he was appointed professor of photography at Ulster University in Belfast. Previously he was a visiting lecturer at West Surrey College of Art & Design (now University for the Creative Arts).http://www.lumas.com/artist/martin_parr/ Martin Parr Foundation The Martin Parr Foundation was founded in 2014. It opened premises in Bristol in October 2017.Niall Flynn, \\"Martin Parr: we don‚Äôt appreciate British photography enough\\". Dazed, 19 September 2017. Retrieved 22 October 2017 The Foundation houses Parr's own archive, and his collection of prints and book dummies made by other photographers‚Äîmainly British and Irish photography, and work by several photographers from abroad who have photographed in the UK. There is also a gallery open to the public; its first exhibition is Parr's Black Country Stories. It is located in Paintworks in south East Bristol. Parr is the Foundation's main source of income. Reception The German photographic curator Thomas Weski has said: > Martin Parr is a chronicler of our age... Leisure, consumption and > communication are the concepts that this British photographer has been > researching for several decades now on his worldwide travels... Parr enables > us to see things that have seemed familiar to us in a completely new way. Dan Rule, writing in The Age, has said: > Parr's signature is his ability not only to isolate the most evocative of > human details, but to elevate such visual fragments to that of the wider > societal signpost or glyph.

A supplement can provide nutrients either extracted from food sources or synthetic, individually or in combination, in order to increase the quantity of their consumption. The class of nutrient compounds includes vitamins, minerals, fiber, fatty acids and amino acids. Dietary supplements can also contain substances that have not been confirmed as being essential to life, but are marketed as having a beneficial biological effect, such as plant pigments or polyphenols. Animals can also be a source of supplement ingredients, as for example collagen from chickens or fish. These are also sold individually and in combination, and may be combined with nutrient ingredients. In the United States and Canada, dietary supplements are considered a subset of foods, and are regulated accordingly. The European Commission has also established harmonized rules to help insure that food supplements are safe and properly labeled. Creating an industry estimated to have a 2015 value of $37 billion, there are more than 50,000 dietary supplement products marketed just in the United States, where about 50% of the American adult population consumes dietary supplements. Multivitamins are the most commonly used product. For those who fail to consume a balanced diet, the United States National Institutes of Health states that certain supplements \\"may have value.\\" In the United States, it is against federal regulations for supplement manufacturers to claim that these products prevent or treat any disease. Companies are allowed to use what is referred to as \\"Structure/Function\\" wording if there is substantiation of scientific evidence for a supplement providing a potential health effect. An example would be \\"_____ helps maintain healthy joints\\", but the label must bear a disclaimer that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \\"has not evaluated the claim\\" and that the dietary supplement product is not intended to \\"diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease\\", because only a drug can legally make such a claim. The FDA enforces these regulations and also prohibits the sale of supplements and supplement ingredients that are dangerous, or supplements not made according to standardized good manufacturing practices (GMPs). Definition In the United States, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 provides this description: \\"The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) defines the term ‚Äúdietary supplement‚Äù to mean a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: a vitamin, a mineral, an herb or other botanical, an amino acid, a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the aforementioned ingredients. Furthermore, a dietary supplement must be labeled as a dietary supplement and be intended for ingestion and must not be represented for use as conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or of the diet. In addition, a dietary supplement cannot be approved or authorized for investigation as a new drug, antibiotic, or biologic, unless it was marketed as a food or a dietary supplement before such approval or authorization. Under DSHEA, dietary supplements are deemed to be food, except for purposes of the drug definition.\\"Dietary Supplement Labels: Key Elements Office of Inspector General, Depart of Health and Human Services (2003). Per DSHEA, dietary supplements are consumed orally, and are mainly defined by what they are not: conventional foods (including meal replacements), medical foods,Guidance for Industry: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Foods; Second Edition U.S. Food and Drug Administration (May 2016). preservatives or pharmaceutical drugs. Products intended for use as a nasal spray, or topically, as a lotion applied to the skin, do not qualify. FDA-approved drugs cannot be ingredients in dietary supplements. Supplement products are or contain vitamins, nutritionally essential minerals, amino acids, essential fatty acids and non- nutrient substances extracted from plants or animals or fungi or bacteria, or in the instance of probiotics, are live bacteria. Dietary supplement ingredients may also be synthetic copies of naturally occurring substances (example: melatonin). All products with these ingredients are required to be labeled as dietary supplements. Like foods and unlike drugs, no government approval is required to make or sell dietary supplements; the manufacturer confirms the safety of dietary supplements but the government does not; and rather than requiring risk‚Äìbenefit analysis to prove that the product can be sold like a drug, such assessment is only used by the FDA to decide that a dietary supplement is unsafe and should be removed from market. Types =Vitamins= Pharmacies and supermarkets in the U.S. sell a large variety of vitamin dietary supplements A vitamin is an organic compound required by an organism as a vital nutrient in limited amounts.Lieberman, S and Bruning, N (1990). The Real Vitamin & Mineral Book. NY: Avery Group, 3, An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) is called a vitamin when it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism, and must be obtained from the diet. The term is conditional both on the circumstances and on the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is a vitamin for anthropoid primates, humans, guinea pigs and bats, but not for other mammals. Vitamin D is not an essential nutrient for people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, as then they synthesize vitamin D in skin. Humans require thirteen vitamins in their diet, most of which are actually groups of related molecules, \\"vitamers\\", (e.g. vitamin E includes tocopherols and tocotrienols, vitamin K includes vitamin K1 and K2). The list: vitamins A, C, D, E, K, Thiamine (B1), Riboflavin (B2), Niacin (B3), Pantothenic Acid (B5), Vitamin B6, Biotin (B7), Folate (B9) and Vitamin B12. Vitamin intake below recommended amounts can result in signs and symptoms associated with vitamin deficiency. There is little evidence of benefit when consumed as a dietary supplement by those who are healthy and consuming a nutritionally adequate diet. The U.S. Institute of Medicine sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for some of the vitamins. This does not prevent dietary supplement companies from selling products with content per serving higher than the ULs. For example, the UL for vitamin D is 100 ¬µg (4,000 IU), but products are available without prescription at 10,000 IU. =Minerals= Minerals are the exogenous chemical elements indispensable for life. Four minerals: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, are essential for life but are so ubiquitous in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino acids. Sulfur is essential, but for humans, not identified as having a recommended intake per se. Instead, recommended intakes are identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine. There are dietary supplements that provide sulfur, such as taurine and methylsulfonylmethane. The essential nutrient minerals for humans, listed in order by weight needed to be at the Recommended Dietary Allowance or Adequate Intake are potassium, chlorine, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, manganese, copper, iodine, chromium, molybdenum, selenium and cobalt (the last as a component of vitamin B12). There are other minerals which are essential for some plants and animals, but may or may not be essential for humans, such as boron and silicon. Essential and purportedly essential minerals are marketed as dietary supplements, individually and in combination with vitamins and other minerals. Although as a general rule, dietary supplement labeling and marketing are not allowed to make disease prevention or treatment claims, the U.S. FDA has for some foods and dietary supplements reviewed the science, concluded that there is significant scientific agreement, and published specifically worded allowed health claims. An initial ruling allowing a health claim for calcium dietary supplements and osteoporosis was later amended to include calcium supplements with or without vitamin D, effective January 1, 2010. Examples of allowed wording are shown below. In order to qualify for the calcium health claim, a dietary supplement must contain at least 20% of the Reference Dietary Intake, which for calcium means at least 260 mg/serving.Food Labeling: Health Claims; Calcium and Osteoporosis, and Calcium, Vitamin D, and Osteoporosis U.S. Food and Drug Administration. *\\"Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.\\" *\\"Adequate calcium as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life.\\" *\\"Adequate calcium and vitamin D throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.\\" *\\"Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life.\\" In the same year, the European Food Safety Authority also approved a dietary supplement health claim for calcium and vitamin D and the reduction of the risk of osteoporotic fractures by reducing bone loss. The U.S. FDA also approved Qualified Health Claims (QHCs) for various health conditions for calcium, selenium and chromium picolinate.Qualified Health Claims: Letters of Enforcement Discretion U.S. Food and Drug Administration. QHCs are supported by scientific evidence, but do not meet the more rigorous ‚Äúsignificant scientific agreement‚Äù standard required for an authorized health claim. If dietary supplement companies choose to make such a claim then the FDA stipulates the exact wording of the QHC to be used on labels and in marketing materials. The wording can be onerous: \\"One study suggests that selenium intake may reduce the risk of bladder cancer in women. However, one smaller study showed no reduction in risk. Based on these studies, FDA concludes that it is highly uncertain that selenium supplements reduce the risk of bladder cancer in women.\\"Selenium and a Reduced Risk of Site-specific Cancers, FDA-2008-Q-0323 U.S. Food and Drug Administration. =Proteins and amino acids= Protein-containing supplements, either ready-to-drink or as powders to be mixed into water, are marketed as aids to people recovering from illness or injury, those hoping to thwart the sarcopenia of old age, to athletes who believe that strenuous physical activity increases protein requirements, to people hoping to lose weight while minimizing muscle loss, i.e., conducting a protein-sparing modified fast, and to people who want to increase muscle size for performance and appearance. Whey protein is a popular ingredient, but products may also incorporate casein, soy, pea, hemp or rice protein. According to US & Canadian Dietary Reference Intake guidelines, the protein Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults is based on 0.8 grams protein per kilogram body weight. The recommendation is for sedentary and lightly active people. Scientific reviews can conclude that a high protein diet, when combined with exercise, will increase muscle mass and strength, or conclude the opposite. The International Olympic Committee recommends protein intake targets for both strength and endurance athletes at about 1.2-1.8 g/kg body mass per day.Nutrition for Athletes, International Olympic Committee Nutrition Working Group of the Medical and Scientific Commission of the International Olympic Committee, Revised and Updated in June 2016. One review proposed a maximum daily protein intake of approximately 25% of energy requirements, i.e., approximately 2.0 to 2.5 g/kg. The same protein ingredients marketed as dietary supplements can be incorporated into meal replacement and medical food products, but those are regulated and labeled differently from supplements. In the United States, \\"meal replacement\\" products are foods and are labeled as such. These typically contain protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals. There may be content claims such as \\"good source of protein\\", \\"low fat\\" or \\"lactose free.\\" Medical foods, also nutritionally complete, are designed to be used while a person is under the care of a physician or other licensed healthcare professional.Medical Foods Guidance Documents & Regulatory Information U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Medical Foods - Guidance for Industry: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Foods; Second Edition U.s. Food and Drug Administration (May 2016) Liquid medical food products - example Ensure - are available in regular and high protein versions. Proteins are chains of amino acids. Nine of these proteinogenic amino acids are considered essential for humans because they cannot be produced from other compounds by the human body and so must be taken in as food. Recommended intakes, expressed as milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day, have been established. Other amino acids may be conditionally essential for certain ages or medical conditions. Amino acids, individually and in combinations, are sold as dietary supplements. The claim for supplementing with the branched chain amino acids leucine, valine and isoleucine is for stimulating muscle protein synthesis. A review of the literature concluded this claim was unwarranted. In elderly people, supplementation with just leucine resulted in a modest (0.99 kg) increase in lean body mass. The non-essential amino acid arginine, consumed in sufficient amounts, is thought to act as a donor for the synthesis of nitric oxide, a vasodilator. A review confirmed blood pressure lowering. Taurine, a popular dietary supplement ingredient with claims made for sports performance, is technically not an amino acid. It is synthesized in the body from the amino acid cysteine. =Bodybuilding supplements= =Essential fatty acids= Fish oil is a commonly used fatty acid supplement because it is a source of omega-3 fatty acids. Fatty acids are strings of carbon atoms, having a range of lengths. If links are all single (C-C), then the fatty acid is called saturated; with one double bond (C=C), it is called monounsaturated; if there are two or more double bonds (C=C=C), it is called polyunsaturated. Only two fatty acids, both polyunsaturated, are considered essential to be obtained from the diet, as the others are synthesized in the body. The \\"essential\\" fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid, and linoleic acid (LA), an omega-6 fatty acid. ALA can be elongated in the body to create other omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Plant oils, particularly seed and nut oils, contain ALA. Food sources of EPA and DHA are oceanic fish, whereas dietary supplement sources include fish oil, krill oil and marine algae extracts. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identifies 250 mg/day for a combined total of EPA and DHA as Adequate Intake, with a recommendation that women pregnant or lactating consume an additional 100 to 200 mg/day of DHA. In the United States and Canada are Adequate Intakes for ALA and LA over various stages of life, but there are no intake levels specified for EPA and/or DHA.Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, National Academies Supplementation with EPA and/or DHA does not appear to affect the risk of death, cancer or heart disease. Furthermore, studies of fish oil supplements have failed to support claims of preventing heart attacks or strokes. In 2017, the American Heart Association issued a science advisory stating that it could not recommend use of omega-3 fish oil supplements for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease or stroke, although it reaffirmed supplementation for people who have a history of coronary heart disease. =Natural products= St. John's wort petals used in natural product supplements Dietary supplements can be manufactured using intact sources or extracts from plants, animals, algae, fungi or lichens, including such examples as ginkgo biloba, curcumin, cranberry, St. John‚Äôs wort, ginseng, resveratrol, glucosamine and collagen. Products bearing promotional claims of health benefits are sold without requiring a prescription in pharmacies, supermarkets, specialist shops, military commissaries, buyers clubs, direct selling organizations, and the internet. While most of these products have a long history of use in herbalism and various forms of traditional medicine, concerns exist about their actual efficacy, safety and consistency of quality. Canada has published a manufacturer and consumer guide describing quality, licensing, standards, identities, and common contaminants of natural products. In 2018, sales of herbal supplements just in the United States were $8.8 billion, with the market growing at about 9% per year, and cannabidiol and mushroom product sales as the highest. Italy, Germany and Eastern European countries were leading consumers of botanical supplements in 2016, with European Union market growth forecast to be $8.7 billion by 2020. =Probiotics= In humans, the large intestine is host to more than 1,000 species of microorganisms, mostly bacteria, numbering in the tens of trillions. \\"Probiotic\\" in the context of dietary supplements is the theory that by orally consuming specific live bacteria (or yeast) species, it is possible to influence the large intestine microbiota, with consequent health benefits. Although there are numerous claimed benefits of using probiotic supplements, such as maintaining gastrointestinal health, in part by lowering risk of and severity of constipation or diarrhea, and improving immune health, including lower risk of and severity of acute upper respiratory tract infections, i.e., the common cold, such claims are not all supported by sufficient clinical evidence. A review based on interviews with dozens of experts in microbiome research expressed concern about \\"...how biomedical research is co-opted by commercial entities that place profit over health.\\" The concern is timely, as through 2021, probiotic supplements are expected to be the fastest growing segment of the dietary supplement market worldwide, while at the same time, the global health benefits market for probiotic-containing yogurt (a food, not a dietary supplement) is declining. As with all dietary supplements, in the United States inappropriate label health claims such as preventing or treating disease are opposed by the FDA and deceptive advertisements by the Federal Trade Commission. Probiotic foods and dietary supplements are allowed to make claims using Structure:Function vocabulary as long as human trial evidence is adequate. In 2005, the FDA issued a Warning Letter to UAS Laboratories for disease treatment claims (colds, flu, ulcers, elevated blood cholesterol, colon cancer...). The company revised label and website content and continued to sell the product.UAS Warning Letter, May 13, 2005 US Food and Drug Administration In 2011 the company was found to have resumed the label and website claims, and the FDA seized product and stopped production.FDA News Release, June 7, 2011 US Food and Drug Administration In 2010 a FTC action was brought against a probiotic food company for exaggerated health claims, resulting in a multimillion-dollar fine and revisions to future advertising. In the European Union a more restrictive approach has been taken by the EFSA. All proposed health claims were rejected on the grounds that the science was not sufficient, and no health claims are permitted. Foods with live microorganisms (yogurt, kefir) can be sold, but without claims. Probiotic supplements are generally regarded as safe. The greatest concern, evidenced by reviews reporting on case studies, is that for people with compromised gut wall integrity there may be a risk of systemic infection. For this reason, probiotic research is expected to exclude bacteria species that are antibiotic resistant. Industry In 2015, the American market for dietary supplements was valued at $37 billion, with the economic impact in the United States for 2016 estimated at $122 billion, including employment wages and taxes. One 2016 analysis estimated the total market for dietary supplements could reach $278 billion worldwide by 2024. Controversy =Adulteration= Over the period 2008 to 2011, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) of the United States received 6,307 reports of health problems (identified as adverse events) from use of dietary supplements containing a combination of ingredients in manufactured vitamins, minerals or other supplement products, with 92% of tested herbal supplements containing lead and 80% containing other chemical contaminants. Using undercover staff, the GAO also found that supplement retailers intentionally engaged in \\"unequivocal deception\\" to sell products advertised with baseless health claims, particularly to elderly consumers. Consumer Reports also reported unsafe levels of arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury in several protein powder products. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that protein spiking, i.e., the addition of amino acids to manipulate protein content analysis, was common. Many of the companies involved challenged CBC's claim. A 2013 study on herbal supplements found that many products were of low quality, one third did not contain the active ingredient(s) claimed, and one third contained unlisted substances. In a genetic analysis of herbal supplements, 78% of samples contained animal DNA that was not identified as an ingredient on the product labels. In some botanical products, undeclared ingredients were used to increase the bulk of the product and reduce its cost of manufacturing, while potentially violating certain religious and/or cultural limitations on consuming animal ingredients, such as cow, buffalo or deer. In 2015, the New York Attorney General (NY-AG) identified four major retailers with dietary supplement products that contained fraudulent and potentially dangerous ingredients, requiring the companies to remove the products from retail stores. According to the NY-AG, only about 20% of the herbal supplements tested contained the plants claimed. The methodology used by the NY-AG was disputed. The test involves looking for DNA fragments from the plants named as the dietary supplement ingredients in the products. One scientist said that it was possible that the extraction process used to create the supplements removed or destroyed all DNA. This, however, would not explain the presence of DNA from plants such as rice or wheat, that were not listed as ingredients. A study of dietary supplements sold between 2007 and 2016 identified 776 that contained unlisted pharmaceutical drugs, many of which could interact with other medications and lead to hospitalization. 86% of the adulterated supplements were marketed for weight loss and sexual performance, with many containing prescription erectile dysfunction medication. Muscle building supplements were contaminated with anabolic steroids, and multiple products contained antidepressants and antihistamines. Despite these findings, fewer than half of the adulterated supplements were recalled. =Regulatory compliance= The European Commission has published harmonized rules on supplement products to assure consumers have minimal health risks from using dietary supplements and are not misled by advertising. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA Office of Inspections, Compliance, Enforcement, and Criminal Investigations) monitors supplement products for accuracy in advertising and labeling. Dietary supplements are regulated by the FDA as food products subject to compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) and labeling with science- based ingredient descriptions and advertising. When finding CGMP or advertising violations, FDA warning letters are used to notify manufacturers of impending enforcement action, including search and seizure, injunction, and financial penalties. Examples between 2016 and 2018 of CGMP and advertising violations by dietary supplement manufacturers included several with illegal compositions or advertising of vitamins and minerals. The United States Federal Trade Commission, which litigates against deceptive advertising in marketed products, established a consumer center to assist reports of false health claims in product advertising for dietary supplements. In 2017, the FTC successfully sued nine manufacturers for deceptive advertising of dietary supplements. Adverse effects In the United States, manufacturers of dietary supplements are required to demonstrate safety of their products before approval is granted for commerce. Despite this caution, numerous adverse effects have been reported, including muscle cramps, hair loss, joint pain, liver disease, and allergic reactions, with 29% of the adverse effects resulting in hospitalization, and 20% in serious injuries or illnesses. By more than five-fold, the highest incidence of health problems derived from \\"combination products\\", whereas supplements for vitamins and minerals, lipid products, and herbal products were less likely to cause adverse effects. Among general reasons for the possible harmful effects of dietary supplements are: a) absorption in a short time, b) manufacturing quality and contamination, and c) enhancing both positive and negative effects at the same time. The incidence of liver injury from herbal and dietary supplements is about 16-20% of all supplement products causing injury, with the occurrence growing globally over the early 21st century. The most common liver injuries from weight loss and bodybuilding supplements involve hepatocellular damage with resulting jaundice, and the most common supplement ingredients attributed to these injuries are green tea catechins, anabolic steroids, and the herbal extract, aegeline. Weight loss supplements have also had adverse psychiatric effects. Society and culture =Public health= Work done by scientists in the early 20th century on identifying individual nutrients in food and developing ways to manufacture them raised hopes that optimal health could be achieved and diseases prevented by adding them to food and providing people with dietary supplements; while there were successes in preventing vitamin deficiencies, and preventing conditions like neural tube defects by supplementation and food fortification with folic acid, no targeted supplementation or fortification strategies to prevent major diseases like cancer or cardiovascular diseases have proved successful. For example, while increased consumption of fruits and vegetables are related to decreases in mortality, cardiovascular diseases and cancers, supplementation with key factors found in fruits and vegetable, like antioxidants, vitamins, or minerals, do not help and some have been found to be harmful in some cases. In general as of 2016, robust clinical data is lacking, that shows that any kind of dietary supplementation does more good than harm for people who are healthy and eating a reasonable diet but there is clear data showing that dietary pattern and lifestyle choices are associated with health outcomes. As a result of the lack of good data for supplementation and the strong data for dietary pattern, public health recommendations for healthy eating urge people to eat a plant-based diet of whole foods, minimizing processed food, salt and sugar and to get exercise daily, and to abandon Western pattern diets and a sedentary lifestyle. =Legal regulation= United States The regulation of food and dietary supplements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is governed by various statutes enacted by the United States Congress and interpreted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\\"FDA\\"). Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\\"the Act\\") and accompanying legislation, the FDA has authority to oversee the quality of substances sold as food in the United States, and to monitor claims made in the labeling about both the composition and the health benefits of foods. Substances which the FDA regulates as food are subdivided into various categories, including foods, food additives, added substances (man-made substances which are not intentionally introduced into food, but nevertheless end up in it), and dietary supplements. The specific standards which the FDA exercises differ from one category to the next. Furthermore, the FDA has been granted a variety of means by which it can address violations of the standards for a given category of substances. Dietary supplement manufacture is required to comply with the good manufacturing practices established in 2007. The FDA can visit manufacturing facilities, send Warning Letters if not in compliance with GMPs, stop production, and if there is a health risk, require that the company conduct a recall.Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) for Dietary Supplements U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2007). European Union The European Union's (EU) Food Supplements Directive of 2002 requires that supplements be demonstrated to be safe, both in dosages and in purity. Only those supplements that have been proven to be safe may be sold in the EU without prescription. As a category of food, food supplements cannot be labeled with drug claims but can bear health claims and nutrition claims. The dietary supplements industry in the United Kingdom (UK), one of the 28 countries in the bloc, strongly opposed the Directive. In addition, a large number of consumers throughout Europe, including over one million in the UK, and various doctors and scientists, had signed petitions by 2005 against what are viewed by the petitioners as unjustified restrictions of consumer choice. In 2004, along with two British trade associations, the Alliance for Natural Health (ANH) had a legal challenge to the Food Supplements Directive referred to the European Court of Justice by the High Court in London. Although the European Court of Justice's Advocate General subsequently said that the bloc's plan to tighten rules on the sale of vitamins and food supplements should be scrapped, he was eventually overruled by the European Court, which decided that the measures in question were necessary and appropriate for the purpose of protecting public health. ANH, however, interpreted the ban as applying only to synthetically produced supplements, and not to vitamins and minerals normally found in or consumed as part of the diet. Nevertheless, the European judges acknowledged the Advocate General's concerns, stating that there must be clear procedures to allow substances to be added to the permitted list based on scientific evidence. They also said that any refusal to add the product to the list must be open to challenge in the courts. =Fraudulent products during the COVID-19 outbreak= During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the FDA and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned consumers about marketing scams of fraudulent supplement products, including homeopathic remedies, cannabidiol products, teas, essential oils, tinctures and colloidal silver, among others. By August 2020, the FDA and FTC had issued warning letters to dozens of companies advertising scam products, which were purported \\"to be drugs, medical devices or vaccines. Products that claim to cure, mitigate, treat, diagnose or prevent disease, but are not proven safe and effective for those purposes, defraud consumers of money and can place consumers at risk for serious harm\\" Research Examples of ongoing government research organizations to better understand the potential health properties and safety of dietary supplements are the European Food Safety Authority, the Office of Dietary Supplements of the United States National Institutes of Health, the Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate of Canada, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia. Together with public and private research groups, these agencies construct databases on supplement properties, perform research on quality, safety, and population trends of supplement use, and evaluate the potential clinical efficacy of supplements for maintaining health or lowering disease risk. =Databases= As continual research on the properties of supplements accumulates, databases or fact sheets for various supplements are updated regularly, including the Dietary Supplement Label Database, Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database, and Dietary Supplement Facts Sheets of the United States. In Canada where a license is issued when a supplement product has been proven by the manufacturer and government to be safe, effective and of sufficient quality for its recommended use, an eight-digit Natural Product Number is assigned and recorded in a Licensed Natural Health Products Database. The European Food Safety Authority maintains a compendium of botanical ingredients used in manufacturing of dietary supplements. In 2015, the Australian Government's Department of Health published the results of a review of herbal supplements to determine if any were suitable for coverage by health insurance. Establishing guidelines to assess safety and efficacy of botanical supplement products, the European Medicines Agency provided criteria for evaluating and grading the quality of clinical research in preparing monographs about herbal supplements. In the United States, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health of the National Institutes of Health provides fact sheets evaluating the safety, potential effectiveness and side effects of many botanical products. =Quality and safety= To assure supplements have sufficient quality, standardization, and safety for public consumption, research efforts have focused on development of reference materials for supplement manufacturing and monitoring. High-dose products have received research attention, especially for emergency situations such as vitamin A deficiency in malnutrition of children, and for women taking folate supplements to reduce the risk of breast cancer. =Population monitoring= In the United States, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) has investigated habits of using dietary supplements in context of total nutrient intakes from the diet in adults and children. Over the period of 1999 to 2012, use of multivitamins decreased, and there was wide variability in the use of individual supplements among subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and educational status. Particular attention has been given to use of folate supplements by young women to reduce the risk of fetal neural tube defects. =Clinical studies= Research initiatives to improve knowledge of the possible health benefits of supplementing with essential nutrients to lower disease risk have been extensive. As examples, just in 2017 were reviews on *vitamin D, providing evidence for protection against acute respiratory tract infections *iron, to deter maternal iron deficiency anemia and adverse effects on the fetus *folate, to lower the risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease *multiple supplements for which there was no evidence of benefit to lower risk of death, cardiovascular disease or cancer A 2017 review indicated a rising incidence of liver injury from use of herbal and dietary supplements, particularly those with steroids, green tea extract, or multiple ingredients. =Absence of benefit= The potential benefit of using essential nutrient dietary supplements to lower the risk of diseases has been refuted by findings of no effect or weak evidence in numerous clinical reviews, such as for cardiovascular diseases, cancer, HIV, or tuberculosis. =Reporting bias= A review of clinical trials registered at clinicaltrials.gov, which would include both drugs and supplements, reported that nearly half of completed trials were sponsored wholly or partially by industry. This does not automatically imply bias, but there is evidence that because of selective non- reporting, results in support of a potential drug or supplement ingredient are more likely to be published than results that do not demonstrate a statistically significant benefit. One review reported that fewer than half of the registered clinical trials resulted in publication in peer-reviewed journals. =Future= Improving public information about use of dietary supplements involves investments in professional training programs, further studies of population and nutrient needs, expanding the database information, enhancing collaborations between governments and universities, and translating dietary supplement research into useful information for consumers, health professionals, scientists, and policymakers. Future demonstration of efficacy from use of dietary supplements requires high-quality clinical research using rigorously-qualified products and compliance with established guidelines for reporting of clinical trial results (e.g., CONSORT guidelines).

She began painting in earnest at the age of 78 and is often cited as an example of an individual who successfully began a career in the arts at an advanced age. Her works have been shown and sold in the United States and abroad and have been marketed on greeting cards and other merchandise. Moses' paintings are displayed in the collections of many museums. Sugaring Off was sold for US$1.2 million in 2006. Moses appeared on magazine covers, television, and in a documentary of her life. She wrote an autobiography (My Life's History), won numerous awards, and was awarded two honorary doctoral degrees. The New York Times said of her: \\"The simple realism, nostalgic atmosphere and luminous color with which Grandma Moses portrayed simple farm life and rural countryside won her a wide following. She was able to capture the excitement of winter's first snow, Thanksgiving preparations and the new, young green of oncoming spring... In person, Grandma Moses charmed wherever she went. A tiny, lively woman with mischievous gray eyes and a quick wit, she could be sharp-tongued with a sycophant and stern with an errant grandchild.\\" She was a live-in housekeeper for a total of 15 years, starting at 12 years of age. One of her employers noticed her appreciation for their prints made by Currier and Ives, and they supplied her with art materials to create drawings. Moses and her husband began their married life in Virginia, where they worked on farms. In 1905, they returned to the Northeastern United States and settled in Eagle Bridge, New York. The couple had ten children, five of whom survived infancy. She expressed an interest in art throughout her life, including embroidery of pictures with yarn, until arthritis made this pursuit too painful. Early life Anna Mary Robertson in the 1860s Anna Mary Robertson was born in Greenwich, New York on September 7, 1860; she was the third of ten children born to Margaret Shanahan Robertson and Russell King Robertson. She was raised with four sisters and five brothers. Her father ran a flax mill and was a farmer. As a child, Moses attended a one-room school for a short period of time. That school is now the Bennington Museum in Vermont, which has the largest collection of her works in the United States. She was inspired to paint by taking art lessons at school. Moses first painted as a child, using lemon and grape juice to make colors for her \\"landscapes\\". Other natural materials that she used to create works of art included ground ochre, grass, flour paste, slack lime and sawdust. At 12 years of age, she left home and began to work for a wealthy neighboring family, performing chores on their farm. She continued to keep house, cook and sew for wealthy families for 15 years. One of the families that she worked for‚Äîthe Whitesides‚Äînoticed her interest in their Currier and Ives prints and purchased chalk and wax crayons so that she could create her own artwork. Marriage and children When she was 27, she worked on the same farm with Thomas Salmon Moses, a \\"hired man.\\" They were married and established themselves near Staunton, Virginia where they spent nearly two decades, living and working in turn on five local farms. Four are as follows: * The Bell Farm, Belvidere also named the Eakle Farm * The Dudley Farm a modern farming enterprise (house still standing and occupied) * Mount Airy Farm , rather badly eroded; now included within Augusta County's Millway Place Industrial Park * Mount Nebo the farm on which she made and sold potato chips Source: My Life's History, Grandma Moses The Mount Airy Farm House in which the Moses family lived still stands (2018) To supplement the family income, Anna made potato chips and churned butter from the milk of a cow that she purchased with her savings. Later, the couple bought a farm. Anna Mary Robertson Moses with two of her children Five of the ten children born to them survived infancy. Although she loved living in the Shenandoah Valley, in 1905 Anna and Robert moved to a farm in Eagle Bridge, New York at her husband's urging. When Thomas Moses was about 67 years of age in 1927, he died of a heart attack, after which Anna's son Forrest helped her operate the farm. Anna Moses never married again. She retired and moved to a daughter's home in 1936. Anna Mary was known as either \\"Mother Moses\\" or \\"Grandma Moses,\\" and although she first exhibited as \\"Mrs. Moses,\\" the press dubbed her \\"Grandma Moses,\\" and the nickname stuck. Decorative arts Fireboard decorated by Moses in 1918 As a young wife and mother, Moses was creative in her home; for example, in 1918 she used housepaint to decorate a fireboard. Beginning in 1932, Moses made embroidered pictures of yarn for friends and family. She also created beautiful quilted objects, a form of \\"hobby art\\" as defined by Lucy R. Lippard. By the age of 76, Moses had developed arthritis, which made embroidery painful. Her sister Celestia suggested that painting would be easier for her, and this idea spurred Moses's painting career in her late 70s. When her right hand began to hurt, she switched to her left hand. Art career What appeared to be an interest in painting at a late age was actually a manifestation of a childhood dream. With no time in her difficult farm-life to pursue painting, she was obliged to set aside her passion to paint. At age 92 she wrote, \\"I was quite small, my father would get me and my brothers white paper by the sheet. he liked to see us draw pictures, it was a penny a sheet and lasted longer than candy.\\" It was her father's encouragement that fed her passion to paint and this dream was able to manifest later in her life. =Style= Moses painted scenes of rural life from earlier days, which she called \\"old-timey\\" New England landscapes. Moses said that she would \\"get an inspiration and start painting; then I'll forget everything, everything except how things used to be and how to paint it so people will know how we used to live.\\" From her works of art, she omitted features of modern life, such as tractors and telephone poles. Her early style is less individual and more realistic or primitive, despite her lack of knowledge of, or perhaps rejection of, basic perspective. Initially she created simple compositions or copied existing images. As her career advanced she created complicated, panoramic compositions of rural life. She was a prolific painter who generated over 1,500 canvasses in three decades. Moses initially charged $3 to $5 for a painting, depending upon its size, and as her fame increased her works were sold for $8,000 to $10,000. Her winter paintings are reminiscent of some of the known winter paintings of Pieter Bruegel the Elder, although she had never seen his work. A German fan of her work said, \\"There emanates from her paintings a light-hearted optimism; the world she shows us is beautiful and it is good. You feel at home in all these pictures, and you know their meaning. The unrest and the neurotic insecurity of the present day make us inclined to enjoy the simple and affirmative outlook of Grandma Moses.\\" =Initial exhibitions= During a visit to Hoosick Falls in 1938, Louis J. Caldor, an art collector who worked as an engineer in the state of New York, saw paintings made by Moses in the window of a drug store. He bought their supply and ten more from her Eagle Bridge house for $3 or $5 each. The next year, three Grandma Moses paintings were included in New York's Museum of Modern Art exhibition entitled \\"Contemporary Unknown American Painters\\". Her first solo exhibition, \\"What a Farm Wife Painted,\\" opened in the same city in October 1940 at Otto Kallir's Galerie St. Etienne. A meet- and-greet with the artist and an exhibition of 50 paintings at Gimbel's Department Store was held next on November 15. Her art displays included samples of her baked goods and preserves that won Moses prizes at the county fair. Her third solo show in as many months, was held at the Whyte Gallery, Washington, D.C. In 1944, she was represented by the American British Art Center and the Galerie St. Etienne, which increased her sales. Her paintings were exhibited throughout Europe and the United States over the next 20 years. Otto Kallir established the Grandma Moses Properties, Inc. for her. The paintings of Grandma Moses were used to publicize American holidays, including Thanksgiving, Christmas and Mother's Day. During the 1950s, her exhibitions broke attendance records around the world. Art historian Judith Stein noted: \\"A cultural icon, the spry, productive nonagenarian was continually cited as an inspiration for housewives, widows and retirees.\\" Her paintings were reproduced on Hallmark greeting cards, tiles, fabrics, and ceramics. They were also used to market products, like coffee, lipstick, cigarettes, and cameras. =Acclaim= In 1950, the National Press Club cited her as one of the five most newsworthy women and the National Association of House Dress Manufacturers honored her as their 1951 Woman of the Year. When she reached 88, Mademoiselle magazine named her a \\"Young Woman of the Year.\\" She was awarded two honorary doctoral degrees. The first was bestowed in 1949 from Russell Sage College and the second two years later from the Moore College of Art and Design. President Harry S. Truman presented her with the Women's National Press Club trophy Award for outstanding accomplishment in art in 1949. Jerome Hill directed the 1950 documentary of her life, which was nominated for an Academy Award. In 1952, she published My Life's History, her autobiography. In it she said \\"I look back on my life like a good day's work, it was done and I feel satisfied with it. I was happy and contented, I knew nothing better and made the best out of what life offered. And life is what we make it, always has been, always will be.\\" In 1955, she appeared as a guest on See It Now, a television program hosted by Edward R. Murrow. Later years and death She was a member of the Society of Mayflower Descendants and Daughters of the American Revolution. Her 100th birthday was proclaimed \\"Grandma Moses Day\\" by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. LIFE magazine celebrated her birthday by featuring her on its September 19, 1960, cover. The children's book Grandma Moses Story Book was published in 1961. Grandma Moses died at age 101 on December 13, 1961 at the Health Center in Hoosick Falls, New York. She is buried there at the Maple Grove Cemetery. President John F. Kennedy memorialized her: \\"The death of Grandma Moses removed a beloved figure from American life. The directness and vividness of her paintings restored a primitive freshness to our perception of the American scene. Both her work and her life helped our nation renew its pioneer heritage and recall its roots in the countryside and on the frontier. All Americans mourn her loss.\\" After her death, her work was exhibited in several large traveling exhibitions in the United States and abroad. Legacy The 1969 U.S. postage stamp honoring Grandma Moses. It re-creates her painting Fourth of July, which the White House owns. * A 1942 piece, The Old Checkered House, 1862, was appraised at the Memphis 2004 Antiques Roadshow. It was not as common as her winter landscapes. Originally purchased in the 1940s for under $10, the piece was assigned an insurance value of $60,000 by the appraiser, Alan Fausel. * In November 2006, her 1943 work Sugaring Off became her highest-selling work at US $1.2 million. * Otto Kallir of the Galerie St. Etienne gave Grandma Moses' painting Fourth of July (1951) to the White House as a gift in 1952.Richard L. Lewis & Susan Ingalls Lewis, The Power of Art (rev. 3rd ed.: Centgage Learning, 2013), p. 22. The painting also appears on a U.S. commemorative stamp that was issued in Grandma Moses' honor in 1969. * The character Daisy \\"Granny\\" Moses, played by actress Irene Ryan on the popular 1960s rural comedy television series The Beverly Hillbillies, was named as an homage to Grandma Moses, who died shortly before the series began. * Norman Rockwell and Grandma Moses were friends who lived over the Vermont-New York state border from each other. Moses lived in Eagle Bridge, New York and after 1938 the Rockwells had a house in nearby Arlington, Vermont.

Spurgeon remains highly influential among Christians of various denominations, among whom he is known as the \\"Prince of Preachers\\". He was a strong figure in the Reformed Baptist tradition, defending the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith, and opposing the liberal and pragmatic theological tendencies in the Church of his day. Spurgeon was pastor of the congregation of the New Park Street Chapel (later the Metropolitan Tabernacle) in London for 38 years. He was part of several controversies with the Baptist Union of Great Britain and later he left the denomination over doctrinal convictions. In 1867, he started a charity organisation which is now called Spurgeon's and works globally. He also founded Spurgeon's College, which was named after him posthumously. Spurgeon authored many types of works including sermons, an autobiography, commentaries, books on prayer, devotionals, magazines, poetry, hymns, and more. Many sermons were transcribed as he spoke and were translated into many languages during his lifetime. He is said to have produced powerful sermons of penetrating thought and precise exposition. His oratory skills are said to have held his listeners spellbound in the Metropolitan Tabernacle and many Christians hold his writings in exceptionally high regard among devotional literature. Biography =Early life= Born in Kelvedon, Essex, he moved to Colchester at 10 months old.Fullerton, W. Y. Charles Haddon Spurgeon: A Biography. The Tyndale Series of Great Biographies. Pg. 5. Chicago: Moody Press, 1966. Spurgeon's conversion from nominal Congregationalism came on 6 January 1850, at age 15. On his way to a scheduled appointment, a snow storm forced him to cut short his intended journey and to turn into a Primitive Methodist chapel in Artillery Street, Newtown, Colchester where God opened his heart to the salvation message. The text that moved him was Isaiah 45:22 ‚Äì \\"Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and there is none else.\\" Later that year on 4 April 1850, he was admitted to the church at Newmarket. His baptism followed on 3 May in the river Lark, at Isleham. Later that same year he moved to Cambridge, where he later became a Sunday school teacher. Spurgeon preached his first sermon in the winter of 1850‚Äì51 in a cottage at Teversham while filling in for a friend. From the beginning of Spurgeon's ministry, his style and ability were considered to be far above average. In the same year, he was installed as pastor of the small Baptist church at Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, where he published his first literary work, a Gospel tract written in 1853. =New Park Street Chapel= Spurgeon at age 23. In April 1854, after preaching three months on probation and just four years after his conversion, Spurgeon, then only 19, was called to the pastorate of London's famed New Park Street Chapel, Southwark (formerly pastored by the Particular Baptists Benjamin Keach, theologian John Gill and John Rippon). This was the largest Baptist congregation in London at the time, although it had dwindled in numbers for several years. Spurgeon found friends in London among his fellow pastors, such as William Garrett Lewis of Westbourne Grove Church, an older man who along with Spurgeon went on to found the London Baptist Association. Within a few months of Spurgeon's arrival at Park Street, his ability as a preacher made him famous. The following year the first of his sermons in the \\"New Park Street Pulpit\\" was published. Spurgeon's sermons were published in printed form every week and had a high circulation. By the time of his death in 1892, he had preached nearly 3,600 sermons and published 49 volumes of commentaries, sayings, anecdotes, illustrations and devotions. Immediately following his fame was criticism. The first attack in the press appeared in the Earthen Vessel in January 1855. His preaching, although not revolutionary in substance, was a plain-spoken and direct appeal to the people, using the Bible to provoke them to consider the teachings of Jesus Christ. Critical attacks from the media persisted throughout his life. The congregation quickly outgrew their building, and moved to Exeter Hall, then to Surrey Music Hall. In these venues Spurgeon frequently preached to audiences numbering more than 10,000. At 22, Spurgeon was the most popular preacher of the day. Staffordshire figurine, c. 1860 On 8 January 1856, Spurgeon married Susannah, daughter of Robert Thompson of Falcon Square, London, by whom he had twin sons, Charles and Thomas born on 20 September 1857. At the end of that year, tragedy struck on 19 October 1856, as Spurgeon was preaching at the Surrey Gardens Music Hall for the first time. Someone in the crowd yelled, \\"Fire!\\" The ensuing panic and stampede left several dead. Spurgeon was emotionally devastated by the event and it had a sobering influence on his life. For many years he spoke of being moved to tears for no reason known to himself. Spurgeon later in life. Walter Thornbury later wrote in \\"Old and New London\\" (1897) describing a subsequent meeting at Surrey: > a congregation consisting of 10,000 souls, streaming into the hall, mounting > the galleries, humming, buzzing, and swarming ‚Äì a mighty hive of bees ‚Äì > eager to secure at first the best places, and, at last, any place at all. > After waiting more than half an hour ‚Äì for if you wish to have a seat you > must be there at least that space of time in advance... Mr. Spurgeon > ascended his tribune. To the hum, and rush, and trampling of men, succeeded > a low, concentrated thrill and murmur of devotion, which seemed to run at > once, like an electric current, through the breast of everyone present, and > by this magnetic chain the preacher held us fast bound for about two hours. > It is not my purpose to give a summary of his discourse. It is enough to say > of his voice, that its power and volume are sufficient to reach every one in > that vast assembly; of his language that it is neither high-flown nor > homely; of his style, that it is at times familiar, at times declamatory, > but always happy, and often eloquent; of his doctrine, that neither the > 'Calvinist' nor the 'Baptist' appears in the forefront of the battle which > is waged by Mr. Spurgeon with relentless animosity, and with Gospel weapons, > against irreligion, cant, hypocrisy, pride, and those secret bosom-sins > which so easily beset a man in daily life; and to sum up all in a word, it > is enough to say, of the man himself, that he impresses you with a perfect > conviction of his sincerity. Spurgeon's work went on. A Pastors' College was founded in 1857 by Spurgeon and was renamed Spurgeon's College in 1923, when it moved to its present building in South Norwood Hill, London. At the Fast Day, 7 October 1857, he preached to the largest crowd ever ‚Äì 23,654 people ‚Äì at The Crystal Palace in London. Spurgeon noted: > In 1857, a day or two before preaching at the Crystal Palace, I went to > decide where the platform should be fixed; and, in order to test the > acoustic properties of the building, cried in a loud voice, \\"Behold the Lamb > of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\\" In one of the galleries, a > workman, who knew nothing of what was being done, heard the words, and they > came like a message from heaven to his soul. He was smitten with conviction > on account of sin, put down his tools, went home, and there, after a season > of spiritual struggling, found peace and life by beholding the Lamb of God. > Years after, he told this story to one who visited him on his death-bed. =Metropolitan Tabernacle= Spurgeon preaching at the Surrey Music Hall circa 1858. On 18 March 1861, the congregation moved permanently to the newly constructed purpose-built Metropolitan Tabernacle at Elephant and Castle, Southwark, seating 5000 people with standing room for another 1000. The Metropolitan Tabernacle was the largest church edifice of its day. Spurgeon continued to preach there several times per week until his death 31 years later. He never gave altar calls at the conclusion of his sermons, but he always extended the invitation that if anyone was moved to seek an interest in Christ by his preaching on a Sunday, they could meet with him at his vestry on Monday morning. Without fail, there was always someone at his door the next day. He wrote his sermons out fully before he preached, but what he carried up to the pulpit was a note card with an outline sketch. Stenographers would take down the sermon as it was delivered and Spurgeon would then have opportunity to make revisions to the transcripts the following day for immediate publication. His weekly sermons, which sold for a penny each, were widely circulated and still remain one of the all-time best selling series of writings published in history.

It was mostly a compilation of Isaac Watts's Psalms and Hymns that had been originally selected by John Rippon, a Baptist predecessor to Spurgeon. Singing in the congregation was exclusively a cappella under his pastorate. Thousands heard the preaching and were led in the singing without any amplification of sound that exists today. Hymns were a subject that he took seriously. While Spurgeon was still preaching at New Park Street, a hymn book called \\"The Rivulet\\" was published. Spurgeon aroused controversy because of his critique of its theology, which was largely deistic. At the end of his review, Spurgeon warned: > We shall soon have to handle truth, not with kid gloves, but with gauntlets, > ‚Äì the gauntlets of holy courage and integrity. Go on, ye warriors of the > cross, for the King is at the head of you. On 5 June 1862, Spurgeon challenged the Church of England when he preached against baptismal regeneration. However, Spurgeon taught across denominational lines as well: for example, in 1877 he was the preacher at the opening of a new Free Church of Scotland church building in Dingwall. It was during this period at the new Tabernacle that Spurgeon found a friend in James Hudson Taylor, the founder of the inter-denominational China Inland Mission. Spurgeon supported the work of the mission financially and directed many missionary candidates to apply for service with Taylor. He also aided in the work of cross-cultural evangelism by promoting \\"The Wordless Book\\", a teaching tool that he described in a message given on 11 January 1866, regarding Psalm 51:7: \\"Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.\\" The book has been and is still used to teach people without reading skills and people of other cultures and languages ‚Äì young and old ‚Äì around the globe about the Gospel message. Following the example of George M√ºller, Spurgeon founded the Stockwell Orphanage, which opened for boys in 1867 and for girls in 1879, and which continued in London until it was bombed in the Second World War. The orphanage became Spurgeon's Child Care which still exists today. On the death of missionary David Livingstone in 1873, a discolored and much-used copy of one of Spurgeon's printed sermons, \\"Accidents, Not Punishments,\\" was found among his few possessions much later, along with the handwritten comment at the top of the first page: \\"Very good, D.L.\\" He had carried it with him throughout his travels in Africa. It was sent to Spurgeon and treasured by him.W. Y. Fullerton, Charles Haddon Spurgeon: A Biography , ch. 10 =Downgrade Controversy= Sword and Trowel original cover page A controversy among the Baptists flared in 1887 with Spurgeon's first \\"Down-grade\\" article, published in The Sword & the Trowel. In the ensuing \\"Downgrade Controversy,\\" the Metropolitan Tabernacle disaffiliated from the Baptist Union, effectuating Spurgeon's congregation as the world's largest self-standing church. Spurgeon framed the controversy in this way: > Believers in Christ's atonement are now in declared union with those who > make light of it; believers in Holy Scripture are in confederacy with those > who deny plenary inspiration; those who hold evangelical doctrine are in > open alliance with those who call the fall a fable, who deny the personality > of the Holy Ghost, who call justification by faith immoral, and hold that > there is another probation after death... It is our solemn conviction that > there should be no pretence of fellowship. Fellowship with known and vital > error is participation in sin. The Controversy took its name from Spurgeon's use of the term \\"Downgrade\\" to describe certain other Baptists' outlook toward the Bible (i.e., they had \\"downgraded\\" the Bible and the principle of sola scriptura). Spurgeon alleged that an incremental creeping of the Graf-Wellhausen hypothesis, Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, and other concepts were weakening the Baptist Union. Spurgeon emphatically decried the doctrine that resulted: > Assuredly the New Theology can do no good towards God or man; it, has no > adaptation for it. If it were preached for a thousand years by all the most > earnest men of the school, it would never renew a soul, nor overcome pride > in a single human heart. The standoff caused division amongst the Baptists and other non-conformists, and is regarded by many as an important paradigm. =Opposition to slavery= Photograph of Spurgeon c.1870 Spurgeon strongly opposed the owning of slaves. He lost support from the Southern Baptists, sales of his sermons dropped to a few, and he received scores of threatening and insulting letters as a consequence. > Not so very long ago our nation tolerated slavery in our colonies. > Philanthropists endeavored to destroy slavery; but when was it utterly > abolished? It was when Wilberforce roused the church of God, and when the > church of God addressed herself to the conflict, then she tore the evil > thing to pieces. I have been amused with what Wilberforce said the day after > they passed the Act of Emancipation. He merrily said to a friend when it was > all done, \\"Is there not something else we can abolish?\\" That was said > playfully, but it shows the spirit of the church of God. She lives in > conflict and victory; her mission is to destroy everything that is bad in > the land. The Best Warcry, March 4th, 1883' In a letter In column 5. to the Christian Watchman and Reflector (Boston), Spurgeon declared: > I do from my inmost soul detest slavery . . . and although I commune at the > Lord's table with men of all creeds, yet with a slave-holder I have no > fellowship of any sort or kind. Whenever [a slave-holder] has called upon > me, I have considered it my duty to express my detestation of his > wickedness, and I would as soon think of receiving a murderer into my church > . . . as a man stealer. =Restorationism= Like other Baptists of his time, despite opposing Dispensationalism,Sermon on 'Jesus Christ Immutable', Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit, 1869, vol. 15, no. 848 . Spurgeon anticipated the restoration of the Jews to inhabit the Promised Land. > We look forward, then, for these two things. I am not going to theorize upon > which of them will come first ‚Äì whether they shall be restored first, and > converted afterwards ‚Äì or converted first and then restored. They are to be > restored and they are to be converted, too. The Restoration And Conversion > of the Jews.

Spurgeon also suffered ill health toward the end of his life, afflicted by a combination of rheumatism, gout and Bright's disease. He often recuperated at Menton, near Nice, France, where he died on 31 January 1892. He enjoyed cigars and smoked a \\"F.

It is designed primarily for pedestrian usage and commonly found in urban areas where pedestrian activity is expected. In comparison with a conventional curb (finished at a right angle above the street surface) a curb cut is finished at an intermediate gradient that connects both surfaces, sometimes with tactile paving. History Historically speaking, footpaths were finished at right angles to the street surface with conventional curb treatments. The introduction of them to help people pushing prams dates back at least as far as the 1930s in the UK. Kalamazoo, Michigan installed curb cuts in the 1940s as a pilot project to aid employment of disabled veterans. A major project in Berkeley, California led by Ed Roberts and others at the Center for Independent Living led to curb cuts up and down Telegraph and Shattuck Avenues creating an extensive path of travel. Following this, the value of curb cuts was promoted more strongly and their installment was often made on a voluntary basis by municipal authorities and developers. Curb cuts in Western countries have been mandated by legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) in the United States (which requires that curb cuts be present on all sidewalks) or the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 in Australia. The legislative requirements in some jurisdictions have been increased from the original requirements in recent times, to the point where existing treatments can now fail to meet the most recent design requirements. Supporters of curb cut requirements point to mandatory curb cuts as an example of disability rights legislation that can benefit every user of public spaces, and not just disabled people.https://slate.com/business/2018/07/curb-space-is-way-too- valuable-for-cities-to-waste-on-parked-cars.html Users and uses A curb cut at an intersection Curb cuts placed at street intersections allow wheelchair users, toddlers on tricycles etc., to move onto or off of a sidewalk with less difficulty. Many curb cuts also feature tactile paving, a pattern of circular bumps that indicate to visually impaired pedestrians that they are about to enter a roadway. Curb cuts also benefit pedestrians if they are using a walker or cane, pushing a stroller, a pram or a buggy for babies, pushing or pulling a cart or hand truck, or walking next to a bicycle; as well as anyone riding a bicycle, roller skates, or a skateboard. Other curb cuts A wider curb cut is also useful for motor vehicles to enter a driveway or parking lot on the other side of a sidewalk. Smaller curb cuts may be used along streets, parking areas or sidewalks to redirect water from traditional drainage ways to stormwater BMPs which allows infiltration, such as a grassed area or rain garden. Design Accessible curb cuts transition from the low side of a curb to the high side (usually 15 cm change in level). Accessible curb ramps are a minimum of 1 metre wide. They are sloped no greater than 1:12 (8.33%), which means that for every 12 cm of horizontal distance, they rise no more than one centimetre. The concrete curb ramp is sometimes scored with grooves, the texture of which may serve as a warning to vision-impaired persons of the transition to the street. Such grooves also allow for traction and water runoff, and may be stained a color that significantly contrasts with the adjacent concrete. If a curb ramp contains flared sides, they are usually no greater than 1:10 slope. Pram ramps in Australia are designed according to Australian Standard AS 1428: Design for access and mobility.

Its value is +1 if n is the product of an even number of prime numbers, and ‚àí1 if it is the product of an odd number of primes. Explicitly, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that any positive integer n can be represented uniquely as a product of powers of primes: n = p_1^{a_1}\\\\cdots p_k^{a_k} where p1 < p2 < ... < pk are primes and the aj are positive integers. (1 is given by the empty product.) The prime omega functions count the number of primes, with (Œ©) or without (œâ) multiplicity: :œâ(n) = k, :Œ©(n) = a1 \\\\+ a2 \\\\+ ... + ak. Œª(n) is defined by the formula :\\\\lambda(n) = (-1)^{\\\\Omega(n)}. . Œª is completely multiplicative since Œ©(n) is completely additive, i.e.: Œ©(ab) = Œ©(a) + Œ©(b). Since 1 has no prime factors, Œ©(1) = 0 so Œª(1) = 1. It is related to the M√∂bius function Œº(n). Write n as n = a2b where b is squarefree, i.e., œâ(b) = Œ©(b). Then :\\\\lambda(n) = \\\\mu(b). The sum of the Liouville function over the divisors of n is the characteristic function of the squares: : \\\\sum_{dn}\\\\lambda(d) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{if }n\\\\text{ is a perfect square,}  0 & \\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} M√∂bius inversion of this formula yields :\\\\lambda(n) = \\\\sum_{d^2n} \\\\mu\\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{d^2}\\\\right). The Dirichlet inverse of Liouville function is the absolute value of the M√∂bius function, \\\\lambda^{-1}(n) = \\\\mu(n) = \\\\mu^2(n), the characteristic function of the squarefree integers. We also have that \\\\lambda(n) \\\\mu(n) = \\\\mu^2(n). Series The Dirichlet series for the Liouville function is related to the Riemann zeta function by :\\\\frac{\\\\zeta(2s)}{\\\\zeta(s)} = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\lambda(n)}{n^s}. The Lambert series for the Liouville function is :\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\lambda(n)q^n}{1-q^n} = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty q^{n^2} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\vartheta_3(q)-1\\\\right), where \\\\vartheta_3(q) is the Jacobi theta function. Conjectures on weighted summatory functions Summatory Liouville function L(n) up to n = 104. The readily visible oscillations are due to the first non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function. Summatory Liouville function L(n) up to n = 107. Note the apparent scale invariance of the oscillations. Logarithmic graph of the negative of the summatory Liouville function L(n) up to n = 2 √ó 109. The green spike shows the function itself (not its negative) in the narrow region where the P√≥lya conjecture fails; the blue curve shows the oscillatory contribution of the first Riemann zero. Harmonic Summatory Liouville function T(n) up to n = 103 The P√≥lya conjecture is a conjecture made by George P√≥lya in 1919. Defining : L(n) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\lambda(k) , the conjecture states that L(n)\\\\leq 0 for n > 1\\\\. This turned out to be false. The smallest counter-example is n = 906150257, found by Minoru Tanaka in 1980. It has since been shown that L(n) > 0.0618672 for infinitely many positive integers n, while it can also be shown via the same methods that L(n) < -1.3892783 for infinitely many positive integers n. For any \\\\varepsilon > 0, assuming the Riemann hypothesis, we have that the summatory function L(x) \\\\equiv L_0(x) is bounded by :L(x) = O\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{x} \\\\exp\\\\left(C \\\\cdot \\\\log^{1/2}(x) \\\\left(\\\\log\\\\log x\\\\right)^{5/2+\\\\varepsilon}\\\\right)\\\\right), where the C > 0 is some absolute limiting constant. Define the related sum : T(n) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\frac{\\\\lambda(k)}{k}. It was open for some time whether T(n) ‚â• 0 for sufficiently big n ‚â• n0 (this conjecture is occasionally‚Äìthough incorrectly‚Äìattributed to P√°l Tur√°n). This was then disproved by , who showed that T(n) takes negative values infinitely often. A confirmation of this positivity conjecture would have led to a proof of the Riemann hypothesis, as was shown by P√°l Tur√°n. =Generalizations= More generally, we can consider the weighted summatory functions over the Lioville function defined for any \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} as follows for positive integers x where (as above) we have the special cases L(x) := L_0(x) and T(x) = L_1(x) :L_{\\\\alpha}(x) := \\\\sum_{n \\\\leq x} \\\\frac{\\\\lambda(n)}{n^{\\\\alpha}}. These \\\\alpha^{-1}-weighted summatory functions are related to the Mertens function, or weighted summatory functions of the Moebius function. In fact, we have that the so-termed non- weigthed, or ordinary function L(x) precisely corresponds to the sum :L(x) = \\\\sum_{d^2 \\\\leq x} M\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{d^2}\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{d^2 \\\\leq x} \\\\sum_{n \\\\leq \\\\frac{x}{d^2}} \\\\mu(n). Moreover, these functions satisfy similar bounding asymptotic relations. For example, whenever 0 \\\\leq \\\\alpha \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{2}, we see that there exists an absolute constant C_{\\\\alpha} > 0 such that :L_{\\\\alpha}(x) = O\\\\left(x^{1-\\\\alpha}\\\\exp\\\\left(-C_{\\\\alpha} \\\\frac{(\\\\log x)^{3/5}}{(\\\\log\\\\log x)^{1/5}}\\\\right)\\\\right). By an application of Perron's formula, or equivalently by a key (inverse) Mellin transform, we have that :\\\\frac{\\\\zeta(2\\\\alpha+2s)}{\\\\zeta(\\\\alpha+s)} = s \\\\cdot \\\\int_1^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{L_{\\\\alpha}(x)}{x^{s+1}} dx, which then can be inverted via the inverse transform to show that for x > 1, T \\\\geq 1 and 0 \\\\leq \\\\alpha < \\\\frac{1}{2} :L_{\\\\alpha}(x) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi\\\\imath} \\\\int_{\\\\sigma_0-\\\\imath T}^{\\\\sigma_0+\\\\imath T} \\\\frac{\\\\zeta(2\\\\alpha+2s)}{\\\\zeta(\\\\alpha+s)} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{x^s}{s} ds + E_{\\\\alpha}(x) + R_{\\\\alpha}(x, T), where we can take \\\\sigma_0 := 1-\\\\alpha+1 / \\\\log(x), and with the remainder terms defined such that E_{\\\\alpha}(x) = O(x^{-\\\\alpha}) and R_{\\\\alpha}(x, T) \\\\rightarrow 0 as T \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. In particular, if we assume that the Riemann hypothesis (RH) is true and that all of the non-trivial zeros, denoted by \\\\rho = \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\imath\\\\gamma, of the Riemann zeta function are simple, then for any 0 \\\\leq \\\\alpha < \\\\frac{1}{2} and x \\\\geq 1 there exists an infinite sequence of \\\\\\\\{T_v\\\\\\\\}_{v \\\\geq 1} which satisfies that v \\\\leq T_v \\\\leq v+1 for all v such that :L_{\\\\alpha}(x) = \\\\frac{x^{1/2-\\\\alpha}}{(1-2\\\\alpha) \\\\zeta(1/2)} + \\\\sum_{\\\\gamma < T_v} \\\\frac{\\\\zeta(2\\\\rho)}{\\\\zeta^{\\\\prime}(\\\\rho)} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{x^{\\\\rho-\\\\alpha}}{(\\\\rho-\\\\alpha)} + E_{\\\\alpha}(x) + R_{\\\\alpha}(x, T_v) + I_{\\\\alpha}(x), where for any increasingly small 0 < \\\\varepsilon < \\\\frac{1}{2}-\\\\alpha we define :I_{\\\\alpha}(x) := \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi\\\\imath \\\\cdot x^{\\\\alpha}} \\\\int_{\\\\varepsilon+\\\\alpha-\\\\imath\\\\infty}^{\\\\varepsilon+\\\\alpha+\\\\imath\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\zeta(2s)}{\\\\zeta(s)} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{x^s}{(s-\\\\alpha)} ds, and where the remainder term :R_{\\\\alpha}(x, T) \\\\ll x^{-\\\\alpha} + \\\\frac{x^{1-\\\\alpha} \\\\log(x)}{T} + \\\\frac{x^{1-\\\\alpha}}{T^{1-\\\\varepsilon} \\\\log(x)}, which of course tends to 0 as T \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. These exact analytic formula expansions again share similar properties to those corresponding to the weighted Mertens function cases. Additionally, since \\\\zeta(1/2) < 0 we have another similarity in the form of L_{\\\\alpha}(x) to M(x) in so much as the dominant leading term in the previous formulas predicts a negative bias in the values of these functions over the positive natural numbers x.

Multiple variants of the lyrics exist, generally sung as four-line verses to the tune of the \\"Colonel Bogey March\\". Origin of the song In his autobiography Fringe Benefits, writer Donough O'Brien says his father, Toby O'Brien, wrote the original in August 1939 as British propaganda.Greg Kelley, \\"Colonel Bogey‚Äôs March through Folk and Popular Culture\\" in Warrior Ways: Explorations in Modern Military Folklore, Utah State University Press, 2012, p.208 Toby O'Brien was a publicist for the British Council at the time. This version started with the words \\"G√∂ring has only got one ball\\", a reference to G√∂ring's grievous groin wound suffered during the Beer Hall Putsch, and went on to imply that Hitler had two small ones. In virtually all later versions, the positions are reversed. The statement that Himmler has \\"something sim'lar\\" appears in all versions. The final line of this original and some later forms ends with the word play that Goebbels had \\"no balls\\". Both these variations argue strongly in favour of O'Brien's version's being a very early version, and a Daily Mail report of the time states that it was \\"attributed to someone not unconnected with our old friend the British Council\\". O'Brien's claims have not been substantiated, and no author has ever been identified for the more popular versions that begin \\"Hitler has only got one ball\\". Hubert Gregg also claimed to have written the lyrics, which he said he sent anonymously to the British War Office. There is no known attempt by anyone to claim or enforce a copyright on the lyrics. It is listed in the Roud Folk Song Index, number 10493. The numerous versions, including the obscene, reflect the enthusiasm with which it was first adopted as a British Army marching-song, then as a popular song of defiance against Adolf Hitler's Nazi-German regime in the other branches of the British armed forces, and amongst British civilians, from 1940 onwards. In the words of Greg Kelley, In a book authored by Ron Rosenbaum, it suggested that the pre-Glasnost Soviet descriptions of what remained of Hitler's corpse reported his monorchism (having only one functional testicle) at the suggestion of Guy Burgess and/or Kim Philby, as part of their making a joke, based on this song, that they could expect the British population and secret services, if not those of the US or USSR, would get. A book published in 2015 asserts, on evidence from an enforced medical examination Hitler underwent in 1923, that he in fact had unilateral cryptorchism, that is he suffered from an undescended right testicle. The book also suggests he had hypospadias or micropenis brought about by low testosterone levels during gestation. Whatever the reason for Hitler's alleged monorchism becoming a popular myth, there was psychodynamic literature, produced outside the USSR after World War II, which sought to explain his personality and behaviour, as a charismatic, genocidal megalomaniac, which drew on his alleged congenital \\"semi-castration\\" and/or the child-rearing practices of his family. Song lyrics Introductory verse - infrequently, an introductory verse is used, set to the tune of \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\". All versions are sung to the tune of The Colonel Bogey March. O'Brien's version of the song runs: Popular alterations have been made to the lines in this version, most of them apparently for the purpose of better fitting the \\"Colonel Bogey\\" rhythm. A common version swaps the names in the first two lines and improves the scansion of the final line:Anthony Hopkins' \\"Songs from the Front & Rear\\" Hurtig Publishers, Edmonton; 1979 pg 186 Outside the United Kingdom, the second line is often sung as \\"the other is on the kitchen wall\\" or another location such as the Taj Mahal. Some areas of the UK alter the second line from the Albert Hall to feature local buildings. Where Australian troops had served in North Africa, Rommel took the place of G√∂ring in the second line. One variant reflects the respect in which Rommel was held by British soldiers during the war, describing him as having \\"four or five\\" balls. A common additional or third verses also contains lyrics that contain events that happen after the testicle has been cut off.http://www.odps.org/glossword/index.php?a=term&d;=3&t;=128  In popular culture  In the Red Dwarf episode \\"Timeslides\\", Lister interacts with Hitler at Nuremberg, claiming that Hitler has \\"only got one testicle\\", in reference to the song. This song was featured in Episode 8 of Season 4 of the Amazon Prime show The Man in the High Castle. The science-fiction series depicts an alternate reality in which the Axis powers won World War II in place of the Allied powers. The episode is titled ‚ÄúHitler Has Only Got One Ball.‚Äù A sketch in season 3, episode 5 of The Armstrong & Miller Show tÔøºÔøºells the fictional tale of the writing of the song after it is discovered that the stories in the song lyrics are true.

Early life Smothers was born in 1937 at the Fort Jay army post hospital on Governors Island in New York City, the son of Ruth (n√©e Remick), a homemaker; and Major Thomas B. Smothers, an army officer who died a POW in April 1945. After moving to California, he graduated from Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California. He was a competitive unicyclist, and a state champion gymnast in the parallel bars. Smothers later attended San Jos√© State University, then known as San Jos√© State College. At SJSC, Smothers participated both in gymnastics and pole vault for the track team. Career The Smothers Brothers initially wanted to be folk musicians. Tom did not feel that he was good enough to be a professional musician, but he was funny enough to do comedy. The two began adding comedy bits to their act. Tom's first foray into the medium of television was as a regular on The Steve Allen Show in 1961. He followed that role with a single episode of Burke's Law. The Smothers Brothers next appeared on the CBS sitcom The Smothers Brothers Show from 1965 to 1966. Tom felt that the show did not play to the brothers' strengths and wanted creative control over their next venture. =The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour and aftermath= Tom Smothers negotiated creative control over their next CBS show, a variety show entitled The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in 1967. The documentary Smothered describes how the brothers (particularly Tom) fought CBS censors to sneak in references to religion, recreational drugs, sex, and the Vietnam War. Smothers is widely quoted as saying: \\"The only valid censorship of ideas is the right of people not to listen.\\" The brothers' oppositional politics led to their show's demise, with David Steinberg later claiming \\"The most innovative variety show on television shut down because of political pressure\\". During the same years, Tom wrote and recorded mainstream songs, such as \\"Can't Help Falling in Love with You.\\" Tom has since stated, \\"When the Smothers Brothers came on the air we had no political point of view or social consciousness, it just evolved as the show was on the air.\\" =Rock and Roll= Smothers introduced some musical acts at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. As he became more politically active, he befriended similarly inclined celebrities like John Lennon. In 1969, Smothers played guitar on Lennon's recording of his single \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" (his name was mentioned in the song as well). The song was written and performed during Lennon's 'Bed-In' honeymoon on June 1, 1969, in Room 1742 at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Smothers can be seen in the hotel room in the documentary film Imagine. =Political involvement= After the show was canceled, Tom became more strident in his politics. In the 1970s, Smothers chided popular comedian Bill Cosby for not taking a stand on political issues of the day such as civil rights. In October 1976, both Cosby and Smothers were in attendance at a Playboy Mansion party. The tension between the two culminated in Cosby's punching Smothers in the head. Tom Smothers's politics are in marked contrast to those of his brother Richard, who is a conservative. Tom stated in 2006 that the duo's real-life political and philosophical differences were a key part of their ability to maintain their act for as long as they did.July 22, 2006 interview with Tommy Smothers from Vancouver's comedycouch.com =Film roles= In motion pictures, Tom Smothers portrayed corporate-executive-turned-tap-dancing-magician Donald Beeman in one of Brian De Palma's earlier films, Get to Know Your Rabbit (1972). He also played a banker in Silver Bears. He later portrayed Spike in Serial (1980). In 1973, he voiced Ted E. Bear (Theodore Edward Bear) in the DePatie-Freleng NBC animated Christmas special The Bear Who Slept Through Christmas. Ten years later, he voiced Ted E. Bear again for its Halloween sequel The Great Bear Scare. In 1980 Smothers starred in the film There Goes the Bride. In 1982 he played with an ensemble cast in Pandemonium in which he was a brave Canadian Mountie chasing down a serial killer at a cheerleader camp. He also voiced one of the characters in the cartoon Christmas movie Precious Moments: Timmy's Special Delivery in 1993. =Later work= In 2007, Tom and Dick Smothers filmed a series of 30-second commercials and promotional spots for the River Rock Casino in Geyserville, California. To augment their act in recent years, \\"Yo- Yo Man\\" became part of their shows. Tom Smothers had created the mostly non- speaking character in the late '60s, a comedic performer of tricks using a yo- yo. The term \\"Yo-Yo Man\\" is registered in his name. In their 2008 tour, Yo-Yo Man was listed as the group's opening act. In 2008, during the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards, Smothers was awarded a special Emmy. In 1968, when he was head writer of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, the writing staff was awarded the Emmy for Outstanding Writing in a Comedic Series. Smothers had refused to let his name be on the list of writers nominated for the Emmy, because he felt his name was too volatile. The award at the 2008 ceremony was presented by Steve Martin, who was once a writer on the program. In December 2009, Tom and Dick both guest starred in a 21st-season episode of The Simpsons that also featured Cooper, Peyton and Eli Manning. On May 6, 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union's Sonoma County chapter honored Smothers with its Jack Green Civil Liberties Award for his work against television censorship and for speaking out for peace and civil liberties.Sonoma Civil Liberties , Winter 2011, #60, p. 1-2. Tom and Dick Smothers reunited in 2019 to mark the 50th anniversary of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour's abrupt cancellation. Personal life Smothers is the owner of Remick Ridge Vineyards in Sonoma County, California, with his wife Marcy Carriker and two children, Bo (born 1991), and Riley Rose (born 1996). He also has a son, Thomas Bolyn Smothers IV (Tom Jr.), from his first marriage, and one grandson, Phoenix Parrish-Smothers. There is a Smothers sisterSherryborn September 1941, in Pasadena, California.

His work in developing a homotopy theory for algebraic varieties and formulating motivic cohomology led to the award of a Fields Medal in 2002. He is also known for the proof of the Milnor conjecture and motivic Bloch‚ÄìKato conjectures and for the univalent foundations of mathematics and homotopy type theory.  Early life and education  Vladimir Voevodsky's father, Aleksander Voevodsky, was head of the Laboratory of High Energy Leptons in the Institute for Nuclear Research at the Russian Academy of Sciences. His mother Tatyana was a chemist. Voevodsky attended Moscow State University for a while, but was forced to leave without a diploma for refusing to attend classes and failing academically. He received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Harvard University in 1992 after being recommended without ever applying, following several independent publications; he was advised there by David Kazhdan. While he was a first year undergraduate, he was given a copy of Esquisse d'un Programme (submitted a few months earlier by Alexander Grothendieck to CNRS) by his advisor George Shabat. He learned the French language \\"with the sole purpose of being able to read this text\\" and started his research on some of the themes mentioned there.See the autobiographical story in  Work  Voevodsky's work was in the intersection of algebraic geometry with algebraic topology. Along with Fabien Morel, Voevodsky introduced a homotopy theory for schemes. He also formulated what is now believed to be the correct form of motivic cohomology, and used this new tool to prove Milnor's conjecture relating the Milnor K-theory of a field to its √©tale cohomology. For the above, he received the Fields Medal at the 24th International Congress of Mathematicians held in Beijing, China.The second medal at the same congress was received by Laurent Lafforgue In 1998 he gave a plenary lecture (A1-Homotopy Theory) at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin. He coauthored (with Andrei Suslin and Eric M. Friedlander) Cycles, Transfers and Motivic Homology Theories, which develops the theory of motivic cohomology in some detail. From 2002, Voevodsky was a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In January 2009, at an anniversary conference in honor of Alexander Grothendieck, held at the Institut des Hautes √âtudes Scientifiques, Voevodsky announced a proof of the full Bloch‚ÄìKato conjectures. In 2009, he constructed the univalent model of Martin-L√∂f type theory in simplicial sets. This led to important advances in type theory and in the development of new Univalent foundations of mathematics that Voevodsky worked on in his final years. He worked on a Coq library UniMath using univalent ideas. In April 2016, the University of Gothenburg awarded an honorary doctorate to Voevodsky. Death and legacy  Voevodsky died on 30 September 2017 at his home in Princeton, from an aneurysm. He is survived by daughters Diana Yasmine Voevodsky and Natalia Dalia Shalaby.

He is a professor at the Institut des Hautes √âtudes Scientifiques and a distinguished professor at the University of Miami. He received the Henri Poincar√© Prize in 1997, the Fields Medal in 1998, the Crafoord Prize in 2008, the Shaw Prize and Fundamental Physics Prize in 2012, and the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics in 2014.  Biography  He was born into the family of Lev Kontsevich, Soviet orientalist and author of the Kontsevich system. After ranking second in the All-Union Mathematics Olympiads, he attended Moscow State University but left without a degree in 1985 to become a researcher at the Institute for Information Transmission Problems in Moscow. While at the institute he published papers that caught the interest of the Max Planck Institute in Bonn and was invited for three months. Just before the end of his time there, he attended a five-day international meeting, the Arbeitstagung, where he sketched a proof of the Witten conjecture to the amazement of Michael Atiyah and other mathematicians and his invitation to the institute was subsequently extended to three years. The next year he finished the proof and worked on various topics on mathematical physics and in 1992 received his Ph.D. at the University of Bonn under Don Bernard Zagier. His thesis outlines a proof of a conjecture by Edward Witten that two quantum gravitational models are equivalent. His work concentrates on geometric aspects of mathematical physics, most notably on knot theory, quantization, and mirror symmetry. One of his results is a formal deformation quantization that holds for any Poisson manifold. He also introduced the Kontsevich integral, a topological invariant of knots (and links) defined by complicated integrals analogous to Feynman integrals, and generalizing the classical Gauss linking number. In topological field theory, he introduced the moduli space of stable maps, which may be considered a mathematically rigorous formulation of the Feynman integral for topological string theory. Honors and awards In 1998, he won the Fields Medal for his \\"contributions to four problems of Geometry\\".

It is played by holding the free end of the string known as the handle (by inserting one fingerusually the middle or index fingerinto a slip knot), allowing gravity (or the force of a throw and gravity) to spin the yo-yo and unwind the string (similar to how a pullstring works). The player then allows the yo-yo to wind itself back to the player's hand, exploiting its spin (and the associated rotational energy). This is often called \\"yo-yoing\\". In the simplest play, the string is intended to be wound on the spool by hand; The yo-yo is thrown downwards, hits the end of the string then winds up the string toward the hand, and finally the yo-yo is grabbed, ready to be thrown again. One of the most basic tricks is called the sleeper, where the yo-yo spins at the end of the string for a noticeable amount of time before returning to the hand. Etymology The word yoyo probably comes from the Ilocano term y√≥yo, or a cognate word from the Philippines.  History  Boy playing with a terracotta yo-yo, Attic kylix, c. 440 BC, Antikensammlung Berlin (F 2549) A 1791 illustration of a woman playing with an early version of the yo-yo, which was then called a \\"bandalore\\" Lady with a yo-yo, Northern India (Rajasthan, Bundi or Kota), c. 1770 Opaque watercolor and gold on paper A Greek vase painting from 440 BC shows a boy playing with a yo-yo (see right). Greek records from the period describe toys made out of wood, metal, or painted terra cotta (fired clay). The terra cotta disks were used to ceremonially offer the toys of youth to certain gods when a child came of age‚Äîdiscs of other materials were used for actual play. = First yo-yo company = After the yo-yo was introduced to the United States, it spread to Mexico‚Äîa pile of handmade wood Mexican yo-yos is pictured. In 1928, Pedro Flores, a Filipino immigrant to the United States, opened the Yo-yo Manufacturing Company in Santa Barbara, California. The business started with a dozen handmade toys; by November 1929, Flores was operating two additional factories in Los Angeles and Hollywood, which all together employed 600 workers and produced 300,000 units daily. The principal distinction between the Filipino design popularized by Flores and more primitive yo-yos is in the way the yo-yo is strung. In older (and some remaining inexpensive) yo-yo designs, the string is tied to the axle using a knot. With this technique, the yo-yo just goes back-and-forth; it returns easily, but it is impossible to make it sleep. In Flores's design, one continuous piece of string, double the desired length, is twisted around something to produce a loop at one end which is fitted around the axle. Also termed a looped slip-string, this seemingly minor modification allows for a far greater variety and sophistication of motion, thanks to increased stability and suspension of movement during free spin. Shortly thereafter (c. 1929), an entrepreneur named Donald F. Duncan recognized the potential of this new fad and purchased the Flores yo-yo Corporation and all its assets, including the Flores name, which was transferred to the new company in 1932. The name \\"Yo-yo\\" was registered in 1932 as a trademark by in Vancouver, Canada,Online Etymology Dictionary. Etymonline.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-09. and Harvey Lowe won the first World Yo-Yo Contest in London, England. In 1932, Swedish Kalmartrissan yo-yos started to be manufactured as well.\\"Kalmartrissan\\" och andra \\"trissor\\" , County Museum of Kalmar \\"Kalmartrissan snurrar vidare\\", Dagens Nyheter 19 December 2012 (not available in the on-line edition) Kalmartrissan fyller 70 √•r, Sveriges radio, 25 January 2002, retrieved 22 March 2013 In 1933 yo-yos were banned in Syria, because many locals superstitiously blamed the use of them for a severe drought. In 1946, the Duncan Toys Company opened a yo-yo factory in Luck, Wisconsin. The Duncan yo-yo was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in Rochester, New York, in 1999. = 1960s resurgence = Declining sales after the Second World War prompted Duncan to launch a comeback campaign for his trademarked \\"Yo-Yo\\" in 1962 with a series of television advertisements. In a trademark case in 1965, a federal court's appeals ruled in favor of the Royal Tops Company, determining that yo-yo had become a part of common speech and that Duncan no longer had exclusive rights to the term. As a result of the expenses incurred by this legal battle as well as other financial pressures, the Duncan family sold the company name and associated trademarks in 1968 to Flambeau, Inc, which had manufactured Duncan's plastic models since 1955. , Flambeau Plastics continued to run the company. = Rise of the ball bearing = Modern yo-yos, some made of both aluminium and stainless steel As popularity spread through the 1970s and 1980s, there were a number of innovations in yo-yo technology, primarily regarding the connection between the string and the axle. In 1979, dentist and yo-yo celebrity Tom Kuhn patented the ‚ÄúNo Jive 3-in-1‚Äù yo-yo, creating the world's first \\"take-apart\\" yo-yo, which enabled yo-yo players to change the axle. Swedish bearing company SKF briefly manufactured novelty yo-yos with ball bearings in 1984. In 1990, Kuhn introduced the SB-2 yo-yo that had an aluminum transaxle, making it the first successful ball-bearing yo-yo.Classic Toys: The Yo-Yo. Retro Planet (2009-05-12). Retrieved on 2012-04-09. In all transaxle yo-yos, ball bearings significantly reduce friction when the yo-yo is spinning, enabling longer and more complex tricks. Subsequent yo-yoers used this ability to their advantage, creating new tricks that had not been possible with fixed-axle designs. There are many new types of ball bearings in the market which deviate from the original design and/or material of the standard stainless steel ball bearing. For example, a certain type of bearing has an inward facing curved surface, to prevent the string from rubbing on the sides of the yo-yo, which would cause unwanted friction when performing intricate string tricks. Other manufacturers replicate this with a similar inwardly curved surface, but use minor modifications. Some high-end bearings use ceramic composites in the balls of the bearing, to reduce internal friction, again making for a smoother spinning yo-yo. Precious materials such as ruby have also been used as a material in prototype ball bearings for its properties such as extreme hardness. The material was first tested in a prototype bearing made by Wolf Yoyo Works in May 2018.  Techniques  = Sleeping = The sleeper is one of the most common yo-yo throws and is the basis for nearly all yo-yo throws other than looping. Keeping a yo-yo spinning while remaining at the end of its uncoiled string is known as sleeping. While the yo-yo is in the \\"sleeping\\" state at the end of the string, one can then execute tricks like \\"walk the dog\\", \\"around the world\\", or the more complex \\"rock the baby\\". The essence of the throw is that one throws the yo-yo with a very pronounced wrist action so that when the yo-yo reaches the end of the string it spins in place rather than rolling back up the string to the thrower's hand. Most modern yo-yos have a transaxle or ball bearing to assist this, but if it is a fixed axle yo-yo, the tension must be loose enough to allow this. The two main ways to do this are (1), allow the yo-yo to sit at the bottom of the string to unwind, or (2) perform lariat or UFO to loosen the tension. When one decides to end the \\"sleeping\\" state, one merely jerks the wrist and the yo-yo \\"catches\\" the string and rolls back up to the hand. Ball-bearing yo-yos with a \\"butterfly\\" shape, primarily used for string tricks, frequently have low response or are completely unresponsive, requiring a \\"bind\\" for the yo-yo to return. In competition, mastery of sleeping is the basis for the 1A division. Inexpensive fixed-axle yo-yos usually spin between 10‚Äì20 seconds, while the expensive ball bearing yo-yos can spin about 1‚Äì4 minutes depending on the throw.Yo-Yo Basics, howstuffworks.com. , the world record sleep times were 3:51.54 minutes for fixed-axle and 21:15.17 minutes for transaxle yo-yos.American Yo-Yo Association website. In 2012, the transaxle yo-yo sleep time record was broken by the C3YoyoDesign BTH, with a time of 30:28.30 minutes. = Unresponsive (1A) = Eventually, wider string gaps and silicone response systems led to the innovation of unresponsive yoyoing, otherwise known as 1A. Traditional yoyos (responsive) would return to the hand when one would tug on the string, but unresponsive yoyos behave a little differently. Instead of returning to the hand when you tug on the string, you have to perform a trick called a \\"bind\\" where the string is doubled over inside the string gap to increase friction on the response system. This has brought about innovation of many different kinds of tricks involving leaving slack in the string, as this would have caused a responsive yoyo to return to the hand. = Looping (2A) = Looping is a yo-yo technique which emphasizes keeping the body of two yo-yos, one on each hand, in constant motion, with or without sleeping.Science News, Week of April 17, 2004; Vol. 165, No. 16, p. 250 Yo-yos optimized for looping have weight concentrated in their centers so they may easily rotate about the string's axis without their mass contributing to resistance due to a gyroscopic effect. also, known as 2A or two hands looping freestyle. In yo-yo competitions, looping both to the inside and outside of the hand with the yo- yo plays a strong role in the 2A division. = Two handed string tricks (3A) = Two handed or 3A style play involves doing string tricks with two flared bearing yo-yos. Popularized and pioneered by Mark McBride, the first modern Triple A trick appeared in Fiend Magazine and was called the Velvet Rolls. The different mounts in this style are referred to as houses (e.g. \\"Kink House\\"). Photos from as early as the late 1950s show early yo-yo demonstrators performing very basic Triple A tricks, such as a Sleeper with one hand, and a Trapeze with the other. While Triple A as a concept has existed for many years, it was not until the debut of Velvet Rolls, coupled with the rise of unresponsive yoyo play, that development began on what is currently considered Triple A. In competition, two handed string tricks have the 3A division. = Off-string (4A) = In the \\"off-string\\" technique, the yo-yo's string is not tied directly to the yo-yo's axle, and the yo-yo is usually launched into the air by performing a \\"forward pass\\" to be caught again on the string. However, some players can 'throw down' off-string yo-yos and catch it on the string just as it leaves the end of the string by pivoting the string around a finger as it unwinds, so that the yo-yo is caught on the string. This is exactly the opposite of a \\"forward pass\\", but with the same result. Yo-yos optimized for off-string tricks have flared designs, like the butterfly shape, which makes it easier to land on the string, and often have soft rubber rings on the edges, so minimum damage is inflicted on the yo-yo, the player, or anyone who happens to be standing nearby, should a trick go wrong. There are also tricks which involve the use of two off-string yoyos at the same time, thrown with the same hand, this is known as \\"soloham.\\" Yo-yo competitions have the 4A division for off-string tricks. = Freehand (5A) = In freehand tricks, the yo-yo's string is not tied to the player's hand, instead ending in a counterweight. The counterweight is then thrown from hand to hand and used as an additional element in the trick. Developed in 1999 by Steve Brown, as of 2008 freehand is considered to be the fastest-growing style of yo-yo play. Steve Brown was awarded a patent on his freehand yo-yo system, which was assigned to Flambeau Products (Duncan's parent company). In yo-yo competitions, counterweight yo-yos are emphasized in the 5A division.  Physical mechanism  When the yo-yo is first released, the gravity (and the throw) give it translational kinetic energy and necessarily, since the string must unwind, much of this energy is converted into rotational kinetic energy establishing the free move of the yo-yo, and causing it to spin rapidly. As the yo-yo unwinds downwards, it also converts potential energy from gravity to both translational and rotational kinetic energy. Because the yo-yo has significant rotational inertia, it can store enough energy in its rotation to overcome gravity all the way back up to the hand. Because the sense of spinning does not change during the whole move, the string winds up in the opposite direction upon the return of the yo-yo. If the shaft of the yo-yo is connected to the string with a loop, there may not be enough frictional force to overcome the weight of the yo-yo, which is necessary to begin winding up the string. In this case, the yo-yo will continue to spin in the loop at the end of the string (or sleep), just being slightly braked by the small dynamic friction, instead of returning. However, if the string is jerked slightly up, this will increase the force from the string on the shaft, thereby rising the boundary for static friction, proportional to the \\"weight\\" of the yo-yo, above the current frictional force, making it static friction, thereby forcing the rotational energy of the yo-yo to wind up the string and finish the rest of the return. Patents have been issued to create more complicated mechanisms to allow tension control and an adjustable mechanism.

He was president of the Argentine Confederation from 1854 to 1860. Life Palacio San Jos√© Justo Jos√© de Urquiza y Garc√≠a was born in Entre R√≠os, the son of Jos√© Narciso de Urquiza √Ålzaga, born in Castro Urdiales, Spain, and Mar√≠a C√°ndida Garc√≠a Gonz√°lez, a Creole of Buenos Aires. He was governor of Entre R√≠os during the government of Juan Manuel de Rosas, governor of Buenos Aires with powers delegated from the other provinces. Rosas presented a resignation to his charge frequently, but only as a political gesture, counting that the other governments would reject it. However, in 1851, resentful of the economic and political dominance of Buenos Aires, Urquiza accepted Rosas' resignation and resumed for Entre Rios the powers delegated in Buenos Aires. Along with the resuming of international commerce without passing through the port of Buenos Aires, Urquiza replaced the \\"Death to the savage unitarians!\\" slogan with \\"Death to the enemies of national organization!\\", requesting the making of a national constitution that Rosas had long rejected. Corrientes supported Urquiza's action, but Rosas and the other provinces condemned the \\"crazy, traitor, savage, unitarian\\" Urquiza. Supported by Brazil and the Uruguayan liberals, he created the \\"Big Army\\" and forced Manuel Oribe to capitulate, ending the long siege of Montevideo in October 1851, and finally defeating Rosas on 3 February 1852 at the Battle of Caseros. The other provinces that supported Rosas against Urquiza's pronunciation changed sides and supported his project of creating a National Constitution. Urquiza immediately began the task of national organization. He became provisional director of the Argentine Confederation in May 1852. In 1853, a constituent assembly adopted a constitution based primarily on the ideas of Juan Bautista Alberdi, and Urquiza was inaugurated president in March 1854. During his administration, foreign relations were improved, public education was encouraged, colonization was promoted, and plans for railroad construction was initiated. His work of national organization was, however, hindered by the opposition of Buenos Aires, which seceded from the Confederation. Open war broke out in 1859. Urquiza defeated the provincial army led by Bartolom√© Mitre in October 1859, at the Battle of Cepeda, and Buenos Aires agreed to re-enter the Confederation. Constitutional amendments proposed by Buenos Aires were adopted in 1860 but the settlement was short- lived, and further difficulties culminated in civil war. Urquiza met the army of Buenos Aires, again led by Mitre, in September 1861. The battle was indecisive, but Urquiza withdrew from the field, leaving the victory with Mitre. He retired to San Jos√© Palace, his residence in Entre R√≠os, where he ruled until he was assassinated at age 69 (along with his sons Justo and Waldino) by followers of dissident and political rival Ricardo L√≥pez Jord√°n. Like many other nineteenth century Argentine patriots,Including Juan Bautista Alberdi, Manuel Alberti, Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear, Miguel de Azcu√©naga, Antonio Gonz√°lez de Balcarce, Manuel Belgrano, Antonio Luis Beruti, Juan Jos√© Castelli, Domingo French, Gregorio Ar√°oz de Lamadrid, Francisco Narciso de Laprida , Juan Larrea, Juan Lavalle, Vicente L√≥pez y Planes, Bartolom√© Mitre, Mariano Moreno, Juan Jos√© Paso, Carlos Pellegrini, Gervasio Antonio de Posadas, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento; Jos√© de San Mart√≠n is known to have been a member of the Lautaro Lodge, but whether that lodge was truly masonic has been debated: Urquiza was a freemason.; ; His imposing Palacio San Jos√© has been interpreted as containing many masonic symbols, created \\"to symbolize and reflect the construction of his other work: the Argentine State\\". Tributes There are many streets, parks and squares all over Argentina that are named after Justo Jos√© de Urquiza, such as the Urquiza park in Rosario or the Urquiza park in Parana city. There is a central street in Rosario called Urquiza, and there is a commuter railway line in Buenos Aires named after him, the Urquiza Line.

The name is taken from the Sanskrit word ananda, which means \\"joy, bliss, delight\\", and amide. It is synthesized from N-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine by multiple pathways. It is degraded primarily by the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enzyme, which converts anandamide into ethanolamine and arachidonic acid. As such, inhibitors of FAAH lead to elevated anandamide levels and are being pursued for therapeutic use.  Physiological functions  Anandamide was first described (and named) in 1992 by Raphael Mechoulam and his lab members W. A. Devane and Lum√≠r Hanu≈°. Anandamide's effects can occur in either the central or peripheral nervous system. These distinct effects are mediated primarily by CB1 cannabinoid receptors in the central nervous system, and CB2 cannabinoid receptors in the periphery. The latter are mainly involved in functions of the immune system. Cannabinoid receptors were originally discovered as being sensitive to Œî9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Œî9-THC, commonly called THC), which is the primary psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis. The discovery of anandamide came from research into CB1 and CB2, as it was inevitable that a naturally occurring (endogenous) chemical would be found to affect these receptors. Anandamide has been shown to impair working memory in rats. Studies are under way to explore what role anandamide plays in human behavior, such as eating and sleep patterns, and pain relief. Anandamide is also important for implantation of the early stage embryo in its blastocyst form into the uterus. Therefore, cannabinoids such as Œî9-THC might influence processes during the earliest stages of human pregnancy. Peak plasma anandamide occurs at ovulation and positively correlates with peak estradiol and gonadotrophin levels, suggesting that these may be involved in the regulation of anandamide levels. Subsequently, anandamide has been proposed as a biomarker of infertility, but so far lacks any predictive values in order to be used clinically. Anandamide plays a role in the regulation of feeding behavior, and the neural generation of motivation and pleasure. Anandamide injected directly into the forebrain reward-related brain structure nucleus accumbens enhances the pleasurable responses of rats to a rewarding sucrose taste, and enhances food intake as well. Moreover, the acute beneficial effects of exercise (termed as runner's high) seem to be mediated by anandamide in mice. Anandamide is the precursor of a class of physiologically active substances, the prostamides. Anandamide inhibits human breast cancer cell proliferation. Anandamide is found in chocolate together with two substances that might mimic the effects of anandamide, N-oleoylethanolamine and N-linoleoylethanolamine. Additionally, anandamide and other endocannabinoids are found in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), although no CB receptors have been found in any insects.  Synthesis and degradation  In humans, anandamide is biosynthesized from N-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE). In turn NAPE arises by transfer of arachidonic acid from lecithin to the free amine of cephalin through an N-acyltransferase enzyme. Anandamide synthesis from NAPE occurs via multiple pathways and includes enzymes such as phospholipase A2, phospholipase C and N-acetylphosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolysing phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD). The crystal structure of NAPE-PLD in complex with phosphatidylethanolamine and deoxycholate shows how the cannabinoid anandamide is generated from membrane N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs), and reveals that bile acids ‚Äì which are mainly involved in the absorption of lipids in the small intestine ‚Äì modulate its biogenesis. Endogenous anandamide is present at very low levels and has a very short half-life due to the action of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which breaks it down into free arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. Studies of piglets show that dietary levels of arachidonic acid and other essential fatty acids affect the levels of anandamide and other endocannabinoids in the brain. High fat diet feeding in mice increases levels of anandamide in the liver and increases lipogenesis. This suggests that anandamide may play a role in the development of obesity, at least in rodents. Paracetamol (called acetaminophen in the US and Canada) is metabolically combined with arachidonic acid by FAAH to form AM404. This metabolite of paracetamol is a potent agonist at the TRPV1 vanilloid receptor, a weak agonist at both CB1 and CB2 receptors, and an inhibitor of anandamide reuptake. As a result, anandamide levels in the body and brain are elevated. In this fashion, paracetamol acts as a pro-drug for a cannabimimetic metabolite. This action may be partially or fully responsible for the analgesic effects of paracetamol. Endocannabinoid transporters for anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol include the heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs). It is found that anandamide prefer cholesterol and ceramide more than other membrane lipids, and cholesterol can behave as a binding partner for it, and following an initial interaction mediated by the establishment of a hydrogen bond, the endocannabinoid is attracted towards the membrane interior, where it forms a molecular complex with cholesterol after a functional conformation adaptation to the apolar membrane milieu, and from there, the complex is further directed to the cannabinoid receptor (CB1) and out. Research Black pepper contains the alkaloid guineesine, which is an anandamide reuptake inhibitor. It may therefore increase anandamide's physiological effects. Low dose intake of anandamide has an anxiolytic effect, but high dose intake injected directly into the cerebral fluid of the brain of mice shows evident cell apoptosis (programmed cell death) invitro as opposed to necrosis. Although this is contradicted by another study also done in both invitro and vivo showing neuron growth in the same situation. A Scottish woman with a rare genetic mutation in her FAAH gene with resultant elevated anandamide levels was reported to be immune to anxiety, unable to experience fear and insensitive to pain. The frequent burns and cuts she suffered due to her hypoalgesia healed quicker than average.

Before its publication, it was highly anticipated by German gamers hearing rumors of a \\"gamer's game\\" designed by Knizia. Tigris and Euphrates won first prize in the 1998 Deutscher Spielepreis. A card game version was released in 2005. The game is set as a clash between neighboring dynasties at the dawn of civilization and is named after the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, in the region now called the Middle East. The rivers together formed natural borders for an area which harboured several grand ancient civilizations, including Sumer, Babylonia, and Assyria. The Greeks called this area Mesopotamia, which literally means \\"between the rivers\\". Gameplay The game can be played by two, three, or four people. Play offers both tactical and strategic objectives. As with many games, short- term objectives gain prominence when more players participate, as players have fewer chances to follow up on previous moves. Luck plays a role, as players draw tiles from a bag, but it is seldom decisive. Players may selectively discard and redraw their tiles at the cost of one \\"action point\\", of which each player has two per turn. The game does not use dice. The board is a map of the two rivers, marked with a square grid. There are four types of tiles with corresponding leaders: temples and priests (red), farms and farmers (blue), markets and merchants (green), and settlements and kings (black). The game starts with ten isolated temple tiles already placed on the board. Players play tiles and leaders onto the board, creating and expanding regions and kingdoms. Monuments may be built on the board when four tiles of the same color are played into a square pattern. Two leaders of the same type cannot coexist in the same kingdom. Internal conflicts are caused by players adding a second leader of a type to a kingdom. External conflicts are caused by players playing tiles to merge two existing kingdoms. During the game, players collect points in each of the four colors as a result of playing tiles, resolving conflicts and controlling monuments. After the final round each player sorts his or her points by color, including any \\"treasures\\" which they have acquired, which count as any color the player wishes. In order to limit specialization the player with the most points in their weakest category wins. For example: *Alice has 6 black, 8 red, 12 green, and 12 blue points; thus has a score of 6. *Bob has 9 black, 10 red, 7 green, and 15 blue points; thus has a score of 7. *Charlie has 14 black, 14 red, 5 green, and 20 blue points; thus has a score of 5. Players must balance their scoring and avoid overspecializing. Knizia later used this mechanism as the basis for Ingenious. Reception Thomas Lehmann comments: \\"If you are looking for a tactically rich, intense strategy game with lots of conflict (unusual in a German game), try Tigris & Euphrates and see why so many players consider this game Reiner Knizia's masterpiece.\\" References External links * Category:Board games introduced in 1997 Category:Deutscher Spiele Preis winners Category:Hans im Gl√ºck games Category:Historical board games Category:Mayfair Games games Category:Reiner Knizia games Category:Tile-laying board games ","title":"Tigris and Euphrates"},{"id":"104538","text":"Chamber music is a form of classical music written for a small group of instruments.

Photo by √âdouard Baldus. The Salon des Refus√©s, French for \\"exhibition of rejects\\" (), is generally known as an exhibition of works rejected by the jury of the official Paris Salon, but the term is most famously used to refer to the Salon des Refus√©s of 1863.Catalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, gravure, lithographie et architecture : refus√©s par le Jury de 1863 et expos√©s, par d√©cision de S.M. l'Empereur au salon annexe, palais des Champs-Elys√©es, le 15 mai 1863, Biblioth√®que nationale de France Today by extension, salon des refus√©s refers to any exhibition of works rejected from a juried art show. Background of the Salon of 1863 The Paris Salon, sponsored by the French government and the Academy of Fine Arts, took place annually, and was a showcase of the best academic art. A medal from the Salon was assurance of a successful artistic career; winners were given official commissions by the French government, and were sought after for portraits and private commissions. Since the 18th century, the paintings were classified by genre, following a specific hierarchy; history paintings were ranked first, followed by the portrait, the landscape, the \\"genre scene\\", and the still life. The jury, headed by the Comte de Nieuwerkerke, the head of the Academy of Fine Arts, was very conservative; near-photographic but idealized realism was expected.Meneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial- la vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire √âditions Armand Colin, (1990). Much intrigue often went on to get acceptance, and to be given a good place in the galleries. In 1851, Gustave Courbet managed to get one painting into the Salon, Enterrement √† Ornans, and in 1852 his Baigneuses was accepted, scandalizing critics and the public, who expected romanticized nudes in classical settings, but in 1855 the Salon refused all of Courbet's paintings. As early as the 1830s, Paris art galleries mounted small-scale, private exhibitions of works rejected by the Salon jurors. Courbet was obliged to organize his own exhibit, called Le Realism, at a private gallery. Private exhibits attracted far less attention from the press and patrons, and limited the access of the artists to a small public. In 1863 the Salon jury refused two thirds of the paintings presented, including the works of Gustave Courbet, √âdouard Manet, Camille Pissarro and Johan Jongkind. The rejected artists and their friends protested, and the protests reached Emperor Napoleon III. The Emperor's tastes in art were traditional; he commissioned and bought works by artists such as Alexandre Cabanel and Franz Xaver Winterhalter, but he was also sensitive to public opinion. His office issued a statement: \\"Numerous complaints have come to the Emperor on the subject of the works of art which were refused by the jury of the Exposition. His Majesty, wishing to let the public judge the legitimacy of these complaints, has decided that the works of art which were refused should be displayed in another part of the Palace of Industry.\\"Published in Le Moniteur on 24 April 1863. Cited in Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial - La vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire, p. 173. More than a thousand visitors a day visited the Salon des Refus√©s. The journalist √âmile Zola reported that visitors pushed to get into the crowded galleries where the refused paintings were hung, and the rooms were full of the laughter of the spectators.Meneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial- la vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire, √âditions Armand Colin, (1990). p. 173. Critics and the public ridiculed the refus√©s, which included such now-famous paintings as √âdouard Manet's D√©jeuner sur l'herbe and James McNeill Whistler's Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl. But the critical attention also legitimized the emerging avant-garde in painting. The Impressionists successfully exhibited their works outside the traditional Salon beginning in 1874. Subsequent Salons des Refus√©s were mounted in Paris in 1874, 1875, and 1886, by which time the popularity of the Paris Salon had declined for those who were more interested in Impressionism. Works in the exhibition =Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe= Rejected by the Salon jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit D√©jeuner sur l'herbe and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refus√©s. D√©jeuner sur l'herbe depicts the juxtaposition of a female nude and a scantily dressed female bather in the background, on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. The painting sparked public notoriety and stirred up controversy and has remained controversial, even to this day. There is a discussion of it, from this point of view, in Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. One interpretation of the work is that it depicts the rampant prostitution in the Bois de Boulogne, a large park at the western outskirts of Paris, at the time. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting.Peter J. Gartner, Art and Architecture: Musee D'Orsay, 2001, p. 180. . Indeed, the Bois de Boulogne is to this day known as a pick-up place for prostitutes and illicit sexual activity after dark, just as it had been in the 19th century. √âmile Zola comments about D√©jeuner sur l'herbe: > The Luncheon on the Grass is the greatest work of √âdouard Manet, one in > which he realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural > grandeur in a landscape. We know the power with which he vanquished this > difficulty. There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, > a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two > young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the > water and who dries her naked skin in the open air. This nude woman has > scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas. My God! What > indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men! > That has never been seen. And this belief is a gross error, for in the > Louvre there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of > persons clothed and nude. But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized. > The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging The Luncheon on the Grass > like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some > people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that > the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, > while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a > straightforward audience. Painters, especially √âdouard Manet, who is an > analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which > torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to > paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists. Thus, assuredly, the > nude woman of The Luncheon on the Grass is only there to furnish the artist > the occasion to paint a bit of flesh. That which must be seen in the > painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with > its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and > its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under > great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this > delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the > background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves. It > is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature > rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an > artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in > him.√âmile Zola, √âdouard Manet, 1867, et lps 91 √âmile Zola incorporated a fictionalized account of the 1863 scandal in his novel L'≈íuvre (The Masterpiece) (1886). =Symphony in White no 1= In 1861, after returning to Paris for a time, James Abbott McNeill Whistler painted his first famous work, Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl. This portrait of his mistress and business manager Joanna Hiffernan was created as a simple study in white; however, others saw it differently. The critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary thought the painting an allegory of a new bride's lost innocence. Others linked it to Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White, a popular novel of the time, or various other literary sources. In England, some considered it a painting in the Pre-Raphaelite manner.Anderson and Koval, pgs. 106, 119 In the painting, Hiffernan holds a lily in her left hand and stands upon a bear skin rug (interpreted by some to represent masculinity and lust) with the bear's head staring menacingly at the viewer. Countering criticism by traditionalists, Whistler's supporters insisted that the painting was \\"an apparition with a spiritual content\\" and that it epitomized his theory that art should be concerned essentially with the arrangement of colors in harmony, not with a literal portrayal of the natural world.Peters, pg. 17 Whistler started working on The White Girl shortly after December 3, 1861, with the intention of submitting it to the prestigious annual exhibition of the Royal Academy. In spite of bouts of illness, he finished the painting by April .Spencer (1998), p. 300. The white paint Whistler used contained lead, and his work on the seven-foot high canvas had given the artist a dose of lead poisoning. The portrait was refused for exhibition at the conservative Royal Academy in London. Whistler then submitted the painting to the Paris Salon of 1863, where it was also rejected. The public was able to see the painting exhibited with other rejected works, in the Salon des Refus√©s. The Salon des Refus√©s was an event sanctioned by Emperor Napoleon III, to appease the large number of artists who joined forces to protest the harsh jury decisions in 1863 Of the over 5,000 paintings submitted in 1863, 2,217 were rejected. In a letter to George du Maurier in early 1862 Whistler wrote of the painting: Whistler submitted the painting to the Academy, but according to Joanna Hiffernan, he expected it to be rejected. The previous year, in 1861, another painting had caused a minor scandal. Edwin Henry Landseer's The Shrew Tamed showed a horse with a woman resting on the ground nearby. The model was named as Ann Gilbert,The Times, Saturday, May 04, 1861; pg. 12; Issue 23924; col A a noted equestrienne of the period,She offered her professional services to render ladies' horses \\"quiet, safe and pleasant to ride\\":The Times, Friday, Jun 20, 1856; pg. 2; Issue 22399; col A however it was soon rumored that it was actually Catherine Walters, the notorious London courtesan.Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine Vol. 90 (550) Aug 1861 Page 211:'\\"The Shrew Tamed\\" - a high-bred horse of soft silken coat, dappled with play of light and shade as on velvet, subdued by a \\"pretty horsebreaker\\", is certainly unfortunate as a subject. This picture has been made the more notorious by \\"The Belgravian Lament\\", which took the well-known rider as a text whereon to point a moral. We hope it will now be felt by Sir Edwin Landseer and his friends that the intrusion of \\"pretty horsebreakers\\" on the walls of the Academy is not less to be regretted than their presence in Rotten Row.' Whistler's painting was reminiscent enough of Landseer's that the judges were wary of admitting it.Spencer (1998), p. 310. White Girl was submitted to the Academy along with three etchings, all three of which were accepted, while the painting was not.Anderson & Koval (1994), pp. 129‚Äì30. Whistler exhibited it at the small Berners Street Gallery in London instead. The next year, Whistler tried to have the painting exhibited at the Salon in Paris ‚Äì the official art exhibition of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts ‚Äì but it was rejected there as well.Craven (2003), pp. 342‚Äì3. Instead, it was accepted at the alternative Salon des Refus√©s ‚Äì the \\"exhibition of rejects\\" that opened on May 15, two weeks after the official Salon.Weintraub (1974), p. 84. Although Whistler's painting was widely noticed, he was upstaged by Manet's more shocking painting Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe. The controversy surrounding the paintings was described in √âmile Zola's novel L'≈íuvre (1886). The reception Whistler's painting received was mostly favourable, however, and largely vindicated him after the rejection he had experienced both in London and in Paris.Newton & MacDonald (1978), p. 151. The painting was greatly admired by his colleagues and friends Manet, the painter Gustave Courbet and the poet Charles Baudelaire. The art critic Th√©ophile Thor√©-B√ºrger saw it in the tradition of Goya and Vel√°zquez. There were, however, those who were less favourable; certain French critics saw the English Pre-Raphaelite trend as somewhat eccentric.Spencer (1998), p. 308.

It is usually schematized as A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA. Examples include the da capo aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\" from Handel's Messiah, Chopin's Prelude in D-Flat Major (Op. 28)White, John D. (1976). The Analysis of Music, pp. 53‚Äì54. . and the opening chorus of Bach's St John Passion. Simple ternary form In ternary form each section is self- contained both thematically as well as tonally (that is, each section contains distinct and complete themes), and ends with an authentic cadence. The B section is generally in a contrasting but closely related key, usually a perfect fifth above or the parallel minor of the home key of the A section (V or i); however, in many works of the Classical period, the B section stays in tonic but has contrasting thematic material. It usually also has a contrasting character; for example section A might be stiff and formal while the contrasting B section would be melodious and flowing. =Da capo aria= Baroque opera arias and a considerable number of baroque sacred music arias was dominated by the Da capo aria which were in the ABA form. A frequent model of the form began with a long A section in a major key, a short B section in a relative minor key mildly developing the thematic material of the A section and then a repetition of the A section. By convention in the third section (the repeat of section A after section B) soloists may add some ornamentation or short improvised variations. In later classical music such changes may have been written into the score. In these cases the last section is sometimes labeled A‚Äô or A1 to indicate that it is slightly different from the first A section.Bartlette, Christopher, and Steven G. Laitz (2010). Graduate Review of Tonal Theory. New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 197‚Äì206. Compound ternary or trio form In a trio form each section is a dance movement in binary form (two sub-sections which are each repeated) and a contrasting trio movement also in binary form with repeats. An example is the minuet and trio from Haydn's Surprise Symphony. The minuet consists of one section (1A) which is repeated and a second section (1B) which is also repeated. The trio section follows the same format (2A repeated and 2B repeated). The complete minuet is then played again at the end of the trio represented as: . By convention in the second rendition of the minuet, the sections are not repeated with the scheme . The trio may also be referred to as a double or as I/II, such as in Bach's polonaise and double (or Polonaise I/II) from his second orchestral suite and his bouree and double (or Bouree I/II) from his second English Suite for harpsichord. Diagram of a minuet and trio The scherzo and trio, which is identical in structure to other trio forms, developed in the late Classical and early Romantic periods. Examples include the scherzo and trio (second movement) from Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 and the scherzo and trio in Schubert's String Quintet. Another name for the latter is \\"composite ternary form\\". Trio form movements (especially scherzos) written from the early romantic era sometimes include a short coda (a unique ending to complete the entire movement) and possibly a short introduction. The second movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 is written in this style which can be diagrammed as Polkas are also often in compound-ternary form. =Quasi compound form= Occasionally the A section or B section of a dance like movement is not divided into two repeating parts. For example, in the Minuet in Haydn's String Quartet op. 76 no. 6, the Minuet is in standard binary form (section A and B) while the trio is in free form and not in two repeated sections. Haydn labeled the B section \\"Alternative\\", a label used in some Baroque pieces (though most such pieces were in proper compound ternary form). Ternary form within a ternary form In a complex ternary form each section is itself in ternary form in the scheme of By convention each part is repeated and only on its first rendition: . An example are the Impromptus (Op. 7) by Jan Vo≈ô√≠≈°ek.\\"An Analysis of Three Impromptus for Piano Op. 68 by Lowell Liebermann\\" by Tomoko Uchino. Expanded ternary forms are especially common among Romantic-era composers; for example, Chopin's \\"Military\\" Polonaise (Op. 40, No. 1) is in the form , where the A and B sections and C and D sections are repeated as a group, and the original theme returning at the end without repeats.

At the 2010 census the population was 141. History In 1885, Five Points was named because of the five roads converging at a single point. Before this, the post office was known as \\"Lystra\\". The town was incorporated in 1915, making it Chambers County's oldest incorporated town. The Baptist Church was the first to take the name of \\"Five Points\\" on its building in 1929. Five Points holds the distinction of being the first town of its size to receive electricity from Alabama Power in 1925. In order to receive power, citizens were required to erect their own poles from Stroud to White Plains. Five Points is home to the first consolidated high school in Alabama. The original Five Points High School was an imposing brick building which had two floors above a full basement and a large auditorium that seated 400 people. Erected in 1916, it stood amidst an campus, the only rural school in the state with its own electric and steam-generating plant and water works. The school building was replaced by a one-story building in 1939. In 1974 a fire destroyed that structure which was replaced by the present building.

Lots for the new town were auctioned in October 1833, with proceeds from the sale financing the construction of a courthouse and jail. The town was first called \\"Chambersville\\", but by the time of incorporation on January 7, 1835, the town name had been changed to \\"Lafayette\\", named after the Marquis de Lafayette; its spelling was changed to \\"LaFayette\\" due to the influence of newspaper editor Johnson J. Hooper, who created a fictional character called Captain Simon Suggs, a backwoods southerner who pronounced the town's name as \\"La Fait\\". The city's newspaper, The LaFayette Sun, was founded under the name The Alabama Standard in April 1841 and adopted its current name on August 3, 1881. In 1898 John Anderson, a black man, was quickly hanged in LaFayette by a mob for a murder he did not commit.

At the 2010 census the population was 708. It is located approximately halfway between Tuscaloosa and Montgomery on U.S. Route 82. The mayor of Maplesville is W. C. Hayes, Jr.  History  The Walker-Klinner Farm in Maplesville The town of Maplesville first began to grow in a location east of its present location, near Mulberry Creek. European settlers migrated to the area from Georgia and the Carolinas following the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814, after the Native Americans who had been living there were defeated. The town was named after Stephen W. Maples, a merchant and the town's first postmaster. The town was located at the crossroads of two important trading routes: the Elyton Road from Selma to Birmingham, and the Fort Jackson Road from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery. By 1850, the original town of Maplesville had a population of 809. The town had two horse-racing tracks, which brought visitors to the town, and had several inns and taverns to accommodate the stagecoach traffic. The original town site began to decline in the early 1850s, after two railway lines were completed 3 miles west of the town. The Alabama & Tennessee River Railway was constructed through in 1853. That same year, a depot was constructed at that location. Residents and businesspeople from the original Maplesville began moving closer to the railroad, and when the Maplesville Post Office was relocated to the railroad town in 1856, the new town was renamed Maplesville. The original town site gradually became deserted, and all that remains today is the Old Maplesville Cemetery along Highway 191. The Old Maplesville Cemetery contains many of the town's original inhabitants. This cemetery is also home to the oldest grave in Chilton County, dating back to 1833.\\"The Official Website of Maplesville, Alabama-Cemeteries.\\" Accessed January 29th, 2020. www.townofmaplesville.com/cemeteries.html. However, the cemetery is just a fraction of its former size. Today, roughly 50 of the original tombstones remain. During the construction of Highway 191, several of the graves were destroyed during the process.Maplesville: The Town and The People, (1820-1989). Montevallo, Ala.:Times Print Co., 1989. Because of Maplesville's abundant rail access, it became a shipping point for cotton and other goods from the surrounding area. In 1865, the train depot was destroyed in a raid by Union general James H. Wilson, as Wilson's Raiders marched on to Selma. It was replaced soon after the Civil War, but was destroyed by fire in 1911. Maplesville continued to prosper after the Mobile and Ohio Railroad ran a line through the town in 1897, and many of the historic buildings in the town today were built during that period. In 1901, a lumber mill opened near the town, and the town's population grew as people moved to Maplesville to work at the mill. Maplesville incorporated in 1914, but the incorporation soon lapsed because the town failed to hold elections after the initial round. It reincorporated in 1947, and by 1951 had established a telephone system, garbage pick-up, and water system. A new town hall was completed in 1975.

History Thorsby's town sign displaying the local high school's mascot, the Rebel Man Thorsby is a small Central Alabama town located in Chilton County. Thorsby was first settled in 1815 and incorporated in 1901 by Scandinavian immigrants who had originally settled in the midwestern United States, but who were seeking a milder climate and fertile soil for growing food. One of those earliest settlers was Theodore T. Thorson, for whom the town was eventually named (the suffix \\"by\\" meaning \\"settlement\\" in Scandinavian languages). The town grew quickly, with two hotels, a sawmill and lumber company, and two wineries being built within the first couple of years. The town of Thorsby was declared a promised land for northerners looking to relocate to a warmer climate, suitable for farming and better health. The fertile soil of the South produced grapes in large numbers, along with other fruits such as strawberries, and the peaches for which Chilton County is famous. The founders formed the Concordia Land and Improvement Association and began advertising in New England newspapers about the \\"utopia\\" they had discovered in the Southeastern United States. Many traveled by railroad to purchase a tract of land and start a better life. Thorsby became affectionately known as the little \\"Swede town\\" by locals. Thorsby is located almost exactly between the downtown areas of Birmingham and Montgomery, with either destination being approximately from the center of town. Each autumn, the town of Thorsby celebrates its heritage with the Annual Swedish Festival that includes an arts and crafts fair, a pageant, music, car and motorcycle shows and food native to the American South. The town maintains a museum in the old Norwegian Lutheran Church, now called \\"Helen Jenkins Chapel\\". A Scandinavian Cemetery is available for visits any time. The town operates its own police and fire departments, as well as departments of building inspection, law, parks and recreation, and the Thorsby Water Works.

At the 2010 census the population was 4,209. Founded as a late 19th-century railroad town, it has transitioned over the course of more than a century into a 21st-century commercial hub. It is the childhood hometown of author and storyteller Kathryn Tucker Windham. History Thomasville was founded in 1888 and incorporated on November 24 of that year. The former community of Choctaw Corner, dating back to the antebellum period, was a settlement west of what would become Thomasville, but when the merchants there learned that a railroad was going to bypass their town to the east, they decided to move their stores to be near the railroad. The former community is now inside the city limits. The tracks between Mobile and Selma were completed the same year that Thomasville began. First referred to as \\"Choctaw\\", the town was named after railroad financier and former Union Civil War general, Samuel Thomas, after he donated $500 for the construction of Thomasville's first school. The town had expanded by the end of the 19th century with numerous stores, several hotels and boarding houses, and a depot station. In 1899, what is now downtown was destroyed by a fire that burned several blocks of the wood frame buildings. Thomasville quickly rebuilt, this time in brick, and was once again flourishing by the start of World War I. Over the next century, Thomasville continued to grow and expand. Over the years, many businesses came and others left. These included garment factories, sawmills, and cotton gins. The railroad discontinued its use of the town's depot by the 1950s, but that time also saw the opening of Thomasville's FPS-35 radar base, part of the Air Defense Command's Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, bringing in servicemen and their families. The prototype for the FPS-35 radar was developed at the Thomasville Aircraft Control and Warning Station. The 1950s also saw the planting of roses along Highway 43, the main highway through Thomasville, earning it the nickname of The City of Roses. The 1960s and 1970s saw the opening of numerous paper mills in the area, an industry that continues to be important to the economy of Thomasville today. This time also saw businesses begin to relocate from downtown to the main highway. The Thomasville Historic District was designated in 1999 by the National Register of Historic Places.

The population was 2,037 at the 2010 census. The city is the county seat of Clay County. History The Clay County Courthouse in Ashland. Clay County was formed by an act of the Alabama General Assembly on December 7, 1866. Less than a year later, Ashland was established as the county seat on land donated by Hollingsworth Watts for the construction of a courthouse. Ashland was incorporated in 1871 and was named for 19th century statesman Henry Clay's Kentucky estate home. During the early years, the town grew very rapidly. The town continued to grow with the opening of Alabama's first graphite mine in 1899. When World War I ended, the market for graphite dropped drastically, thus ending the town's growth phase. The 1930s brought the Great Depression and boll weevil to Ashland that destroyed the cotton industry. Farmers were forced to abandon what had been the community's major industry. Timber, poultry, and cabinet making became the dominant industries by the beginning of the 21st century. One of the newest attractions in Clay County in the 1920s, was the chicken business. Millions of chickens and eggs and long chicken houses In or about 1921, Reverend Secelar Claxton Ray took one hundred, day-old chicks to the Clay County Fair and put them under an oil burning brooder and called attention to the advantage of using chickens on the farm to supplement the 'all cotton' cash crop. This was something new, but it did gradually get the attention of the local farmers. He was now fully in the poultry business, and named it Goodwill Poultry Farm and Hatchery. He bought houses then idle at the local graphite mines in Clay County and hired neighbors in their spare time and built the hatchery and chicken houses and an extra tenant house on the farm, southeast of Ashland, Alabama whose population of close to one thousand had grown considerably from two hundred in 1881.Some Thoughts on the Bible as the Word of God, Rev.

At the 2010 census the population was 2,395. History Native Americans were the first to inhabit the area now known as Lineville. The Creek Indian War of 1813, however, resulted in their removal. The first white settlers in the area were William and Thomas Lundie. Their settlement became known as Lundie's Cross Roads after a trading post opened in the 1830s to serve pioneers and miners searching for gold. In 1856, Lundie's Cross Roads became known as County Line, probably for the Baptist Church, founded in 1848 and located on what was then the boundary line between Talladega and Randolph counties. Also in 1856, a post office was established in County Line, schools were consolidated and corn and cotton became cash crops. The Town of (Crooked Creek) Lineville was built on what was at that time the dividing line between Talladega and Randolph Counties, hence the name, Lineville. John H. Ingram, Sr. of Lineville, Alabama furnishes the following early history: ‚ÄúCrooked Creek Baptist Church, later Lineville, was organized in 1839 and built one and one quarter miles west of the town of Lineville about 200 yards northwest of the home of Frank Pittard; and the first literary school of the community was nearby. Some years later the church was moved a short distance and a house was built on the left side of the public road near the residence of the late Thomas H. Harris. In about 1863 the church was moved into the town of Lineville and a house built just west of the present grammar school building; the name was changed to Lineville Baptist Church in 1881 and legally incorporated in 1912; the first Circuit Court that was held in the new County of Clay, was held in the Lineville Baptist Church in 1867, with John Henderson of Talladega, Alabama, as a judge. The present new brick building was built in 1915 and 1916, with the first service held on March 1st, 1916, with prayer and thanksgiving service conducted by J.H. Ingram, Sr., and C.N. James, pastor.‚ÄùSome Thoughts on the Bible as the Word of God by SC Ray 1976, Temple Press, USA One of the newest attractions in Clay County in the 1920s, was the chicken business. Millions of chickens and eggs and long chicken houses In or about 1921, Reverend Secelar Claxton Ray took one hundred, day-old chicks to the Clay County Fair and put them under an oil burning brooder and called attention to the advantage of using chickens on the farm to supplement the ‚Äòall cotton‚Äô cash crop. This was something new, but it did gradually got the attention of the local farmers. He was now fully in the poultry business, and named it Goodwill Poultry Farm and Hatchery. He bought houses then idle at the local graphite mines in Clay County and hired neighbors in their spare time and built the hatchery and chicken houses and an extra tenant house on the farm, southeast of Ashland, Alabama whose population of close to one thousand had grown considerably from two hundred in 1881.Some Thoughts on the Bible as the Word of God by SC Ray 1976, Temple Press, USA The Civil War saw some 56 area men interred in the Old Lineville Cemetery.

At the time of the 2010 U.S. census, its population was 3,940. Elba is part of the Enterprise micropolitan statistical area. Elba is the official county seat of Coffee County, though there are two county courthouses, with the other one being located in the town of Enterprise. History The town which eventually became Elba originated near a ferry across the Pea River in the early 1830s. Originally called Bridgeville, a U.S. post office was established in the town by 1841. In 1851, a lottery to determine a new name for the town was held. One citizen had been reading a biography of Napoleon Bonaparte, and his suggestion of \\"Elba\\" as its name was the winner when it was drawn from a hat before any of the other suggestions. Elba became the county seat of Coffee County in 1852. A logging railroad first reached Elba on March 20, 1892, with the first permanent rail line arriving in October 1898. The \\"Dorsey Trailer Company\\" was constructed at the end of this railroad line, and this company manufactured the highway trailers that served on railroads and highways starting with the piggyback railroad or containerized cargo boom of the second half of the 20th century. The new railroad line ended in West Elba, where the \\"New Town\\" industrial section of the town was located. The Seaboard System Railroad ceased all railroad service to Elba, including freight service, on November 27, 1984. The Pea River is an essential component of the history of Elba. The river was originally called the Talakatchee River by the Creek Indians. (In the Creek language, talak means \\"pea\\", and hatchee means \\"small river\\".) The Pea River frequently flooded, causing great damage to the town. The Lincoln flood of 1865, named for the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in the same year, was the first to destroy the town. Another devastating flood occurred in 1929 when the river crested at a depth of early on March 15. Airplanes were used to drop supplies to the completely inundated town. There was only one death from the flood, an African-American man named \\"Phoe\\" Larkins. A child born at the Elba Hotel during this flood was named \\"Noah Tucker\\" after the biblical character Noah. Vivian Harper received the Theodore N. Vail Silver Medal for her heroic actions during the flood. A levee was built around the town in 1930. Flood gates were erected and drainage systems improved. Floods continued, however, with especially severe inundations in 1938, 1959 and 1975. The worst flood ever recorded in Elba occurred in 1990, with a river crest of . The levee broke and Whitewater Creek overflowed into the town. Elba was completely flooded for four days, and the town was nearly destroyed. More floods struck Elba in 1994 and 1998.

Its population was 26,562 at the 2010 census. Enterprise is the primary city of the Enterprise micropolitan statistical area (with the portion of the city located in Dale County part of the Ozark micropolitan statistical area), and is also part of the Dothan-Enterprise- Ozark combined statistical area. Enterprise is famous for the Boll Weevil Monument, a large monument of a woman holding a boll weevil, which is located in the middle of Main Street. The city erected the statue because the destruction of the cotton crop by the boll weevil had led to agricultural diversity, starting with peanuts and more prosperity than had ever come from cotton alone. It the only statue to an insect pest in the world. Enterprise is right outside the U.S. Army's Fort Rucker, the home of Army Aviation. Enterprise is home to Enterprise State Community College. History =Founding of the Boll Weevil Monument= Historical marker and Boll Weevil Monument in downtown Enterprise The founder of Enterprise, John Henry Carmichael, first settled there in 1881. Carmichael opened a store, which attracted more settlers to the area, and by the next year, a post office was relocated from the settlement of Drake Eye to the north to Enterprise. In 1896, with 250 people having settled there, the city of Enterprise incorporated. Soon afterward, the Alabama Midland Railway came to Enterprise, bringing with it opportunities for commerce and growth. By 1906, 10 years after the city incorporated, its population had grown to 3,750.\\"History of Enterprise\\". City of Enterprise Retrieved February 6, 2010. The way of life in Enterprise came under threat in 1915. An infestation of boll weevils had found its way into the region's cotton crops, resulting in the destruction of most of the cotton in Coffee County. Facing economic ruin, the nearly bankrupt area farmers were forced to diversify, planting peanuts and other crops in an effort to lessen the damage and recoup some of the losses inflicted upon them by the invading insect. Two years later, Coffee County was the leading producer of peanuts in the United States. Enterprise was able not only to stave off disaster, but also its economy was renewed by the thriving new crop base. In appreciation, the people of Enterprise erected a monument in the city center to what the monument describes as their \\"herald of prosperity\\"; the boll weevil. The Boll Weevil Monument was dedicated on December 11, 1919, as a reminder of how the city adjusted in the face of adversity. It is the only monument to an agricultural pest in the world. Downtown Enterprise's former Alabama Midland Railway depot, now the Depot Museum =March 2007 tornado= In the early afternoon of March 1, 2007, Enterprise was hit by a devastating tornado (rated EF4) during the February‚ÄìMarch 2007 tornado outbreak. The tornado caused nine deaths, injured over 121 others, and left severe damage in the city estimated at nearly $307,000,000, becoming the worst disaster in Enterprise history. The worst damage occurred at Enterprise High School, where the eight students died after one hallway was almost completely destroyed. The students' names are Michael Bowen (16), Andrew (AJ) Jackson (16), Ryan Mohler (16), Peter Dunn lll (16), Michael (Mikey) Tompkins (17), Jamie Vidensek (17), Michelle Wilson (16), and Kathryn Strunk (16); the remaining casualty was resident Edna Strickland. A quarter-mile-wide swath through the downtown area was devastated, with at least 370 houses damaged or destroyed. The National Guard was called into the city, and a dusk-to-dawn curfew was implemented immediately after the disaster. President Bush, who arrived the morning of March 3, declared the county a disaster area. An AmeriCorps team was sent to the city to help organize and participate in disaster relief. Newly constructed Enterprise High School after the tornado The high school was to be relocated to the west end of the Boll Weevil Circle. It was due to be rebuilt by the 2010‚Äì11 school year at a cost over $80,000,000. Until then, the students were required to go to school at the local community college, where trailers were used to add classrooms. The high school was rebuilt and reopened on August 23, 2010.

It is located along the Tennessee River in the northern part of the state and, as of the 2010 census, the population of Muscle Shoals was 13,146. The estimated population in 2019 was 14,575. Both the city and the Florence-Muscle Shoals Metropolitan Area (including four cities in Colbert and Lauderdale counties) are commonly called \\"the Shoals\\". Northwest Alabama Regional Airport serves the Shoals region, located in the northwest section of the state. Since the 1960s, the city has been known for music. Local studios and artists developed the \\"Muscle Shoals Sound\\", including FAME Studios in the late 1950s and Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in 1969. They produced hit records that shaped the national and international history of popular music. Due to its strategic location along the Tennessee River, Muscle Shoals had long been territory of historic Native American tribes. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, as Europeans entered the area in greater number, it became a center of historic land disputes. The new state of Georgia had ambitions to anchor its western claims (to the Mississippi River) by encouraging European-American development here, but that project did not succeed. In 1922 Muscle Shoals was the site of an attempted community development project by Henry Ford, noted Michigan entrepreneur of the automobile industry. He wanted to take over a dam and other infrastructure built by the War Department but did not like the terms offered. Due to Ford's influence in the area, some streets were named after streets in Detroit, Michigan. As in Detroit, Woodward Avenue is the name of the main road through the city. Henry Ford conceived of a 75-mile industrial corridor from Decatur, Alabama to the tri-state border of Pickwick Lake. Under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration during the Great Depression, the Tennessee Valley Authority was established to create infrastructure and jobs, resulting in electrification of a large rural area along the river. The Ford Motor Company did build and operate a plant for many years in the Listerhill community, three miles east of Muscle Shoals; it closed in 1982 as part of industrial restructuring when jobs moved out of the country. Etymology There are several explanations as to how the city got its name. One is that it was named for a former natural feature of the Tennessee River, a shallow zone where mussels were gathered, and settlers named as Muscle Shoals. When the area was first settled, the distinct spelling of \\"mussel\\" to refer to the shellfish had not yet been locally adopted. History Like other areas along waterways, this was important to indigenous peoples for thousands of years. The area of Muscle Shoals was a part of the historic Cherokee hunting grounds dating to at least the early eighteenth century, if not earlier. Many Cherokee fought against the rebels during the late American Revolutionary War, hoping to expel them from their territories. After the Revolution, Cherokee attitudes toward the new U.S. republic were divided, as settlers increasingly encroached on their territory. An anti-American faction, dubbed the Chickamauga, separated from more conciliatory Cherokees, and moved into present-day south-central and southeastern Tennessee. Most of this band settled along the Chickamauga River, from which their name was derived. They claimed Muscle Shoals as part of their domain. When Anglo-Americans attempted to settle the region in the 1780s and 1790s, the Chickamaugas bitterly resisted them.M. Thomas Hatley, The Dividing Paths: Cherokees and South Carolinians through the Era of Revolution (Oxford, UK: University Press, 1993), 215‚Äì228.William C. McLoughlin, Cherokee Renascence in the New Republic (Princeton, NJ: University Press, 1992), 19‚Äì20. The Upper Creek, residing in what is now north and central Alabama, also resented any European or Euro- American presence in the region. A major incident occurred in 1790, when U.S. President George Washington sent an expedition under Major John Doughty in an attempt to establish a fort and trading post at Muscle Shoals. This expedition was nearly annihilated by a Chickamauga and Creek party sent to destroy it, and the administration abandoned the project.William S. Coker and Thomas D. Watson, Indian Traders of the Southeastern Spanish Borderlands: Panton, Leslie & Company and John Forbes & Company, 1783‚Äì1847 (Pensacola: University of West Florida Press, 1986), 178. Anglo-American settlers in Tennessee continued to agitate for control of this region. The site was particularly desirable, as it controlled access to fine cotton-producing land immediately to its south.Michael Paul Rogin, Fathers and Children: Andrew Jackson and the Subjugation of the American Indian (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1976), 170‚Äì174. In 1797, John Sevier, the first governor of Tennessee, complained to Andrew Jackson that \\"The prevention of a settlement at or near the Muscle Shoals is a manifest injury done the whole western country.\\" At Sevier's behest, Jackson attempted to persuade Congress and President John Adams to fund a new expedition to take control of the site, but to no avail.H. W. Brands, Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times (New York: Random House Digital, Inc., 2006), 93. U.S. officials finally took control of the region in the wake of the U.S. invasion of Creek country during the War of 1812. Jackson and General John Coffee obtained cession of the land from both the Cherokee and Creek (who had continued to dispute possession) by treaty, without permission from the federal government. Secretary of War William H. Crawford refused to recognize the cession, and reconfirmed Cherokee ownership, leading to personal enmity between him and Jackson. The political struggle over the lands was eventually won by Jackson and his backers, who gained passage in Congress of the Indian Removal Act in 1830.Rogin, Fathers and Children, 170. When Jackson, as president, implemented the policy of Indian Removal, Muscle Shoals was used as a site from which to exile the Upper Creek to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).Don C. East, A Historical Analysis of the Creek Indian Hillabee Towns and Personal Reflections on the Landscape and People of Clay County, Alabama. (New York: iUniverse, 2008), 106‚Äì107. During World War I President Wilson authorized a dam on the Tennessee River just downstream of Muscle Shoals to help power nitrate plants for munitions. The first plant started producing nitrates two weeks after the armistice, but the dam was not completed until 1924. Meanwhile, in 1922 Henry Ford tried to buy the nitrate works and the unfinished dam. The Michigan car manufacturer and industrialist proposed leasing the uncompleted hydro-electric dam at Muscle Shoals on the Tennessee River in Alabama. The US War Department had begun the project during World War I, and engineers estimated a cost of $40 million to complete. At this time, public projects were financed either through raising taxes‚Äîwhich, Congress was unwilling to do at the time- or by issuing bonds. For the Muscle Shoals project, the proposal was for 30-year bonds at 4% interest. Ford and his friend and fellow inventor Thomas Edison balked at the idea that the US government should have to pay $48 million in interest on top of the $40 million they would have to pay back‚Äîall for a project that would benefit the public (the argument being that the hydro-electric dam and accompanying fertilizer plants would create jobs and revitalize the area). Responding to the bond issue, Edison remarked: ‚ÄúAny time we wish to add to the national wealth, we are compelled to add to the national debt.‚Äù Edison and Ford hoped that a new monetary system could be created where dollar bills were issued directly to workers and manufacturer, with the money being backed by the goods they produced rather than the gold and silver held in bank vaults.Kazek, K. (2013). \\"Could Muscle Shoals have been a hub rivaling Detroit? Henry Ford thought so.\\" Alabama Living‚ÄúFord Sees Wealth in Muscle Shoals,‚Äù The New York Times, (December 5, 1921) Congress eventually rejected Ford's idea. The project of area development based on hydroelectric power languished until the Great Depression. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration created the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933 to construct needed infrastructure and install an electrical system in the rural area, using newly generated electricity from the dam complex. Music Residents in Muscle Shoals created two studios that have worked with numerous artists to record many hit songs from the 1960s to today. These are FAME Studios, founded by Rick Hall, where Arthur Alexander, Percy Sledge, Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding and numerous others recorded; and Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, founded by the musicians known as The Swampers. They worked with Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Rod Stewart, the Rolling Stones, The Allman Brothers, and others. All four of the Quad Cities have contributed to what became known as the \\"Muscle Shoals Sound\\". In addition to the city being home to country music band Shenandoah, it has been a destination of numerous artists to write and record. Both FAME Studios and Muscle Shoals Sound Studio are still in operation in the city. They recorded such recent hit songs such as \\"Before He Cheats\\" by Carrie Underwood and \\"I Loved Her First\\" by Heartland, continuing the city's musical legacy. George Michael recorded an early, unreleased version of \\"Careless Whisper\\" with Jerry Wexler in Muscle Shoals in 1983. Bettye LaVette recorded her Grammy nominated album \\"Scene of the Crime\\" at FAME in 1972. The original Muscle Shoals Sound Studios were located at 3614 Jackson Highway in Sheffield but that site was closed in 1979 when the studio relocated to 1000 Alabama Avenue in Sheffield. The studio in the Alabama Avenue building closed in 2005; it houses a movie production company, which also hosts tours and concerts at the venue.Cypress Moon Studios. Roots of American Music Trail. Retrieved September 14, 2018 Muscle Shoals encouraged the cross-pollination of musical styles: black artists from the area, such as Arthur Alexander and James Carr, used white country music styles in their work, and white artists from the Shoals frequently borrowed from the blues/gospel influences of their black contemporaries, creating a distinct sound. Sam Phillips, founder of Sun Records, was born in and lived in the area. He stated that the Muscle Shoals radio station WLAY (AM), which played both \\"white\\" and \\"black\\" music, and where he worked as a disc jockey in the 1940s, influenced his merging of these sounds at Sun Records with Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash. Rolling Stone editor David Fricke wrote that if one wanted to play a single recording that would \\"epitomize and encapsulate the famed Muscle Shoals Sound\\", that record would be \\"I'll Take You There\\" by The Staple Singers in 1972. After hearing that song, American songwriter Paul Simon phoned his manager and asked him to arrange a recording session with the musicians who had performed it. Simon was surprised to learn that he would have to travel to Muscle Shoals to work with the artists. After arriving in the small town, he was introduced to the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section (\\"The Swampers\\") who had recorded this song with Mavis Staples. Expecting black musicians (the original Rhythm Section consisted only of white musicians), and assuming that he had been introduced to the office staff, Simon politely asked to \\"meet the band\\". Once things were sorted out, Simon recorded a number of tracks with the group, including \\"Loves Me Like a Rock\\", \\"Kodachrome\\" and \\"Still Crazy After All These Years\\" in 1973. When Bob Dylan told his record label that he intended to record Christian music, the label executives insisted that if he planned to pursue the project, he must, at least, record the work in Muscle Shoals. They believed this would provide the work \\"some much-needed credibility\\". Dylan had not previously expressed a religious attitude, and the executives feared that his new work might be taken as satirical. Recording in the Bible Belt, they thought, might avert a disaster. Dylan subsequently recorded two Christian albums at Muscle Shoals Sound Studios, Slow Train Coming (1979) and Saved (1980). In the early 21st century, Florence native Patterson Hood, son of \\"Swamper\\" David Hood, found fame as a member of the alternative rock group Drive-By Truckers. Siblings and Muscle Shoals natives Angela Hacker (winner) and Zac Hacker (second place) were the top two finishing finalists on the 2007 season of Nashville Star, a country-music singing competition. In 2008, State Line Mob, a Southern rock duo group formed by singer and songwriters Phillip Crunk (Florence native) and Dana Crunk (Rogersville native), released their first CD, Ruckus, and won two Muscle Shoals Music Awards for 2008 for (Best New Artist) and Best New Country Album) of the year. Band of Horses recorded a portion of their album Infinite Arms at Muscle Shoals. Artists signed to the FAME label in 2017 include Holli Mosley, Dylan LeBlanc, Jason Isbell, Angela Hacker, Gary Nichols, and James LeBlanc. Although Muscle Shoals is no longer the \\"Hit Recording Capital of the World\\" (as it was in the 1960s and 1970s), the music continues. Groups and artists include Drive-By Truckers, The Civil Wars, Dylan LeBlanc, Gary Nichols, Jason Isbell, State Line Mob, Eric \\"Red Mouth\\" Gebhardt, Fiddleworms, and BoomBox. Fans of Muscle Shoals music visit the local landmarks. While most of the city's recording studios are still active, the majority will allow tours with an appointment. A number of rock, R&B; and country music celebrities have homes in the area surrounding Muscle Shoals (Tuscumbia), or riverside estates along the Tennessee River. They may be seen performing in area nightclubs, typically rehearsing new material. FAME Recording Studios in Muscle Shoals (photograph by Carol M. Highsmith) Sister city Florence, Alabama, is frequently referred to as \\"the birthplace of the Blues\\". W. C. Handy was born in Florence and is generally regarded as the \\"Father of the Blues\\". Every year since 1982, the W. C. Handy Music Festival is held in the Florence/Sheffield/Muscle Shoals area, featuring blues, jazz, country, gospel, rock music and R&B.; The roster of jazz musicians known as the \\"Festival All-Stars\\", or as the W. C. Handy Jazz All-Stars, includes musicians from all over the United States, such as guitarist Mundell Lowe, drummer Bill Goodwin, pianist/vocalist Johnny O'Neal, vibraphone player Chuck Redd, pianist/vocalist Ray Reach, and flutist Holly Hofmann. On January 6, 2010, Muscle Shoals was added to the Mississippi Blues Trail. After FAME studio founder Rick Hall died in early 2018, The New Yorker concluded its retrospective with this comment: \\"Muscle Shoals remains remarkable not just for the music made there but for its unlikeliness as an epicenter of anything; that a tiny town in a quiet corner of Alabama became a hotbed of progressive, integrated rhythm and blues still feels inexplicable. Whatever Hall conjured there‚Äîwhatever he dreamt, and made real‚Äîis essential to any recounting of American ingenuity. It is a testament to a certain kind of hope.\\" Al.com commented that Hall is survived by his family \\"and a Muscle Shoals music legacy like no other\\". An editorial in the Anniston Star concludes with this epitaph, \\"If the world wants to know about Alabama ‚Äì a state seldom publicized for anything but college football and embarrassing politics ‚Äì the late Rick Hall and his legacy are worthy models to uphold\\". = 3614 Jackson Highway Studio= The original location of Muscle Shoals Sound Studios in Sheffield has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since June 2006. From the early 2000s to 2013, it had been partly restored and open for tours. In 2013, the documentary Muscle Shoals raised public interest in a major restoration of the original studio. In the same year, the Muscle Shoals Music Foundation was formed to raise funds to purchase the building and to complete major renovations. In June 2013, the owner of the property since 1999 sold it without the historic recording equipment to the Foundation. A grant from Beats Electronics, a manufacturer of headphones owned by Apple Inc., and founded by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, provided an essential $1 million. The state tourism director said in 2015 that the 2013 film Muscle Shoals had been a significant influence. \\"The financial support from Beats is a direct result of their film.\\" Additional donations were made by other groups and individuals. , tours were visiting the partly-restored studio on Jackson Highway. It was closed when major restoration work started in September 2015. Muscle Shoals Sound Studio reopened as a finished tourist attraction on January 9, 2017. Owned and operated by the foundation, the interior is reminiscent of the 1970s, with relevant recording equipment and paraphernalia. There are plans for future recording projects. Even before the Jackson Highway studio reopened, The Alabama Tourism Department named Muscle Shoals Sound Studio as the state's top attraction in 2017. =The Swampers= The members of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section were Pete Carr (lead guitar), Jimmy Johnson (rhythm guitar), Roger Hawkins (drums), David Hood (bass guitar) and Barry Beckett (keyboards). Affectionately called The Swampers, the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section was a local group of first-call studio musicians (initially working at FAME and then at Muscle Shoals Sound Studios) who were available for back-up. They were given the nickname The Swampers by music producer Denny Cordell during the Leon Russell sessions because of their \\"funky, soulful Southern 'swamp' sound\\". In the song \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd, a verse states: > Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers. > And they've been known to pick a song or two. > Lord, they get me off so much, > They pick me up when I'm feelin' blue. > Now, how 'bout you? When Lynyrd Skynyrd recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studios once early in their career, they saw the various gold and platinum records on the walls bearing the words \\"To The Swampers\\", and later included it in the song as a tribute.

Tuscumbia soon became the center for agriculture in northern Alabama. A line to the town on the Tuscumbia, Courtland and Decatur Railroad was completed in 1832, and by 1850 Tuscumbia was a major railroad hub for train traffic throughout the South. From 1826 to the 1860s, the Tuscumbia Female Academy operated in Tuscumbia.Isabella Margaret Elizabeth Blandin, History of Higher Education of Women in the South Prior to 1860, (New York: Washington, Neale Pub. Co., 1909), 64-65. During the Civil War, the railroad hub made Tuscumbia a target of the Union Army, which destroyed the railroad shops and other parts of the town. The Civil War resulted in the permanent closure of the Tuscumbia Female Academy. Tuscumbia became the county seat for Colbert County in 1867. In April 1894, three African-Americans suspected of planning arson were removed from the Tuscumbia jail by a mob of 200 men who hung them from the bridge over the Tennessee River.

For the next ten years, Fred was the town mascot. Fred gained popularity through a regular newspaper column, \\"A Dog's Life,\\" about his activities and encounters, and then national recognition after he was profiled on cable TV's Animal Planet. Fred died on December 23, 2002 in a Birmingham animal hospital, from a mysterious animal bite. He was buried behind the town's old jailhouse.

Elzy Garvin left South Carolina in search of better land, better climate for farming and for matters of faith. It was recorded that he once remarked, \\"Our family left Ireland to practice our faith, and we are not becoming something new.\\" The area reminded him so much of his home state that he named it \\"Carolina\\". Elzy was married to Emma Catherine Bass. They produced 5 children. Sherman, Ollie, Nancy, Willia & Odessa. Elzy and Emma are both buried in Carolina. Many of his relations have been found to be buried at Bethcar Baptist Church on the outskirts of Wagener, SC.

History Lockhart came into being about 1904 when the Jackson Lumber Company mill was constructed there, the community being a company town. Many streets were named for Native American tribes. The mill was erected to handle the dense forests of yellow pine in what was known as the \\"Jackson Tract\\". The town was named for Standard Oil magnate and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania financier, Charles Lockhart.http://pghbridges.com/articles/biography/lockhart- charles_brilliant.htmhttp://www.southernspaces.org/2013/inside-jackson-tract- battle-over-peonage-labor-camps-southern-alabama-1906 In 1912, the mill employed around a thousand workers and ran 24/7. At that time Lockhart was the largest lumber mill in the United States. Flooring for the famous Waldorf- Astoria Hotel in New York City came from Lockhart. In 1903 the mill was the center of a peonage scandal. More than a hundred immigrant laborers recruited in cities in the North were held against their will in a walled compound on the site. Company officials were sentenced to as much as eighteen months in jail when convicted but were able to have their sentences reduced by political friends. The milling facility was served by both the Central of Georgia Railroad and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, connecting through nearby Florala, Alabama.http://www.floralahistory.com/wp- content/uploads/2011/04/11-LN-CofGa-Depots-in-Lockhart-AL.21.jpg \\"The mill, however, closed in 1940, and historical accounts offer two reasons. Military enlistments prior to U.S. entry in World War II caused a labor shortage, or company officials sold their holdings and the land to the residents after cutting all the timber in the area and deciding not to wait for replanted timber to mature. Jackson Lumber Company also donated much land to the state that was replanted and developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps into Geneva State Forest in neighboring Geneva County.\\"http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-3446 This land had little value after it had been clear cut, the practice of the time, and being unable to sell the now-deforested acreage during the Great Depression, the company returned it to the state in the 1930s rather than pay taxes on it.

The soldiers who fought under Maister's command in northern Slovenia became known as \\"Maister's fighters\\" (). Maister was also an accomplished poet and self-taught painter. Life =Early career and fight for Styria= Maister was born in the Upper Carniolan commercial town of Kamnik, then part of Austria-Hungary. A career soldier, during World War I, he served in the Austro-Hungarian Army. In 1917, he was sent to Graz promoted to the rank of a major. In 1918, near the end of the war when it was obvious that Austria-Hungary was losing, the city council of Maribor proclaimed the annexation of Maribor to Austria. Maister organized Slovene volunteer forces of 4000 soldiers and 200 officers and in the night of 23 November 1918 seized control of the city of Maribor and the surrounding region of Lower Styria. This date has been recognized as a state holiday in Slovenia since 2005. The Slovene National Council for Lower Styria awarded him the rank of general on November 1. The German-speaking city was thus secured for the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which united with the Kingdom of Serbia into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes on December 1\\\\. Maister's rank as a general was confirmed by the National Government of the Slovene part of the Kingdom as a \\"lieutenant with the title and character of a general\\" on 11 December 1918, which was later also confirmed by the Belgrade Government. =Marburg's Bloody Sunday= On 27 January 1919, Germans awaiting the American peace delegation at the marketplace in Maribor () were fired on by Slovenian troops under the command of Maister. Nine Germans were killed and more than eighteen were seriously wounded. The responsibility for the shooting has not been conclusively established. German sources accused Maister's troops of shooting without cause, while Slovenian witnesses, such as Maks Pohar, testified that the Germans (some still in the uniforms of the German paramilitary organization called the Green Guard) attacked the Slovene soldiers guarding the city hall. The Austrian Germans allegedly attacked the police inspector, Ivan Senekoviƒç, and then pressed towards the Slovenian soldiers in front of the city hall. A Slovenian version of this event involves a German firing a revolver in the direction of the Slovenian soldiers, who responded spontaneously by firing into the civilian crowd. The event became known as Marburg's Bloody Sunday (). =Fight for Carinthia= Rudolf Maister's funeral. In November 1919, Maister's forces joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes Army's offensive in Carinthia. Maister joined them later and took part of the capture of Klagenfurt. After the Carinthian Plebiscite, in which majority of the local Slovenian population decided to remain part of Austria, Maister withdrew to private life. He spent most of his later life in an estate near Planina in Inner Carniola. Poetry Maister also wrote poetry, which he published in two collected volumes in 1904 and in 1929. Most of his poetry follows Post- Romantic aesthetics, and it is influenced by the 19th-century Slovene lyrical and patriotic poetry of Simon Jenko, Simon Gregorƒçiƒç, and Anton A≈°kerc.

The city describes itself as \\"The Friendliest City in the South\\", a slogan that appears on its \\"welcome\\" signs. At the 2010 census the population was 2,800. History Luverne was one of numerous towns developed in the state as a result of railroad construction. On July 2, 1880, the Montgomery and Southern Railway was created to construct a new railroad linking Montgomery to the Florida coast. The company completed around of narrow gauge track by September 18, 1882. The company was reorganized as the Montgomery and Florida Railway in May 1886, and a second time as the Northwest and Florida Railroad in 1888. In November 1888, the railroad reached the site of Luverne in the central part of Crenshaw County, near the Patsaliga River. Now totaling the line was converted to standard gauge by July 1889 and it was decided to proceed no further. The Alabama Terminal and Improvement Company, a subsidiary of the Alabama Midland Railway, controlled the railroad by 1889 and the line from Montgomery to Luverne was into the network of the latter. The new railroad terminus attracted related development, and the town grew. It was incorporated in 1891, and became a center of timbering in the Piney Woods of southern Alabama, as the land was not fertile enough to be suitable for large- scale cotton plantation agriculture. In 1893, the citizens of Crenshaw County voted to move the county seat from Rutledge to the more populous Luverne. By the late 1930s, lynchings of African Americans were increasingly conducted in small groups or in secret, rather than in the former mass public displays.Mrs. Jessie Daniels Ames, The Changing Character of Lynching, Commission on Interracial Cooperation, 1942 On June 22, 1940, an African-American man named Jesse Thornton was lynched in Luverne for failing to address a white man with the title of \\"Mister\\".

His inspiration was the English game Hoppity which was devised in 1854.Brian Love, Great Board Games, London, (1979), p. 5 The gameboard is checkered and divided into 16√ó16 squares. Pieces may be small checkers or counters, or wooden or plastic cones or men resembling small chess pawns. Piece colors are typically black and white for two-player games, and various colors or other distinction in games for four players.  Overview  The game is played by two or four players seated at opposing corners of the board. The game is won by being first to transfer all of one's pieces from one's own camp into the camp in the opposing corner. For four-player games played in teams, the winner is the first team to race both sets of pieces into opposing camps. On each turn, a player either moves a single piece to an adjacent open square, or jumps over one or more pieces in sequence.  Rules  = Setup = pawn-style playing pieces, often called \\"Halma pawns\\" * The board consists of a grid of 16√ó16 squares. * Each player's camp consists of a cluster of adjacent squares in one corner of the board. These camps are delineated on the board. ** For two-player games, each player's camp is a cluster of 19 squares. The camps are in opposite corners. ** For four-player games, each player's camp is a cluster of 13 squares. Each of the four corners of the board is a camp. * Each player has a set of pieces in a distinct color, of the same number as squares in each camp. * The game starts with each player's camp filled by pieces of their own color. = Play sequence = Valid (green) and invalid (red) moves of a white pawn in Halma * Players randomly determine who will move first. * Pieces can move in eight possible directions (orthogonally and diagonally). * Each player's turn consists of moving a single piece of one's own color in one of the following plays: ** One move to an empty square: *** Place the piece in an empty adjacent square. *** This move ends the play. ** One or more jumps over adjacent pieces: *** An adjacent piece of any color can be jumped if there is an adjacent empty square on the directly opposite side of that piece. *** Place the piece in the empty square on the opposite side of the jumped piece. *** The piece that was jumped over is unaffected and remains on the board. *** After any jump, one may make further jumps using the same piece, or end the play. * Once a piece has reached the opposing camp, a play cannot result in that piece leaving the camp. * If the current play results in having every square of the opposing camp occupied by one's own pieces, the acting player wins. Otherwise, play proceeds clockwise around the board.  Comparison to other games  * The mechanic of jumping pieces is reminiscent of draughts (checkers) but differs in that no opposing pieces are ever captured or otherwise withdrawn from the board nor is jumping compulsory. * Chinese Checkers, a variant of Halma, was originally published in 1892 as Stern-Halma (German for \\"Star Halma\\") and later renamed upon marketing to the United States to appear more exotic. The name is misleading, since the game has no historical connection with China, nor is it a checkers game.  Variations  There are also 8√ó8 and 10√ó10 board variations, either of which is adequate for two players and they have 10 and 15 pieces per player, respectively. There are various online versions, usually for two-player, turn-based play. Some sites implement a rule variation stating that a player automatically loses if they still have a piece in their start region after a certain number of moves (typically 30 for the 8√ó8 game, 50 for the 10√ó10 game). Fast-advancing players occasionally attempt to blockade an opposing piece, but this tactic can backfire if the other player is aware of it. In non-electronic versions, the number of moves is not normally counted.  Basic strategy and tactics  A game of Halma has three distinct phases. The beginning (before opposing pieces come into contact) is usually a set- piece battle, with players setting up their favoured openings. The middle (when opposing pieces are blocking or jumping each other) is usually characterised by opportunistic play; the player with the most patience to check the whole board for opportunities, including those gained by moving backwards in order to move forwards, will gain an advantage. Players should also set up for the endgame (when opposing pieces have passed one another and must run for home), avoiding stragglers. As with most board games, early control of the center is a key tactic, as it provides additional mobility. Pieces can form a two-layer blocking wall, deflecting the opponent from the center and forcing them into a longer trajectory; however, if the opponent builds an adjacent wall, then the first player to disband his wall usually suffers a strategic disadvantage. It is important to understand that paired pieces move faster than single pieces in the endgame. This means that a player with a pair of \\"leapfrogging\\" pieces has an advantage over a player with two individual stragglers. The larger boards have more strategic combinations available than the smaller boards, and the four player game offers more tactical intrigue than the two player game.

It is located along Interstate 65, about north of Birmingham and about south of Huntsville. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 14,775, with an estimated population of 16,034 in 2019. History Before European settlement, the area that today includes Cullman was originally in the territory of the Cherokee Nation. The region was traversed by a trail known as the Black Warrior's Path, which led from the Tennessee River near the present location of Florence, Alabama, to a point on the Black Warrior River south of Cullman. This trail figured significantly in Cherokee history, and it featured prominently in the American Indian Wars prior to the establishment of the state of Alabama and the relocation of several American Indian tribes, including the Creek people westward along the Trail of Tears. During the Creek War in 1813, General Andrew Jackson of the U.S. Army dispatched a contingent of troops down the trail, one of which included the frontiersman Davy Crockett. In the 1820s and the 1830s, two toll roads were built linking the Tennessee Valley to present-day Birmingham. In 1822, Abraham Stout was given a charter by the Alabama Legislature to open and turnpike a road beginning from Gandy's Cove in Morgan County to the ghost town of Baltimore on the Mulberry Fork near Colony. The road passed near present-day Vinemont through Cullman, Good Hope, and down the current Interstate 65 corridor to the Mulberry Fork. The road was later extended to Elyton (Birmingham) in 1827. It then became known as Stout's Road. Mace Thomas Payne Brindley was given a charter in 1833 to turnpike two roads, one running between Blount Springs to Somerville by way of his homestead in present-day Simcoe, and the second road passing west of Hanceville and east of Downtown Cullman to join Stout's Road north of the city. What later became the Brindley Turnpike became an extension of Stout's Road to Decatur. Cullman later became located between the juncture of the two roads, and they predated the corridor of U.S. Route 31. During the Civil War, the future location of Cullman was the site of the minor Battle of Day's Gap. On April 30, 1863, Union forces under the command of Colonel Abel Streight won a victory over forces under Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest. This battle was part of a campaign and chase known collectively as Streight's Raid. Although Streight got the upper hand in this battle, Forrest would have the last laugh. In one of the more humorous moments of the war, Streight sought a truce and negotiations with Forrest in present-day Cherokee County near present-day Gaylesville. Although Streight's force was larger than Forrest's, while the two were negotiating, Forrest had his troops march repeatedly in a circuitous route past the site of the talks. Thinking himself to be badly outnumbered, Streight surrendered to Forrest . Colonel John G. Cullmann, founder of Cullman (1823‚Äì1895) Cullman itself was founded in 1873 by Colonel John G. Cullmann, a German immigrant.Although some sources state that Cullmann had earlier Americanized his name from \\"Kullmann,\\" Stanley Johnson, his only surviving American descendant, told The Cullman Times in 1998 that there are no German records indicating the name \\"Kullmann\\", and that \\"Cullmann\\" had always been the correct spelling. Cullmann had been an advocate of democratic reforms in his native Bavaria, having fought and acquired his honorific title \\"Colonel\\" during the Revolutions of 1848‚Äì49. After the failure of the revolution, Cullmann found himself in financial ruin. In the years to follow, he would try to re-establish himself in business, but after several setbacks, including a great financial loss in the First Schleswig War, he would remain unsuccessful. As time went on and Prussia, under King Wilhelm I and his Minister President Otto von Bismarck, began to exert more influence in the German region (eventually unifying Germany under Prussian rule in 1871), Cullmann began to believe that his political ideals were fundamentally incompatible with those of the German Government. As a result, he decided to emigrate from his homeland. Settling first in London due to fears that he would be forced to join in the ongoing American Civil War, Cullman eventually came to America in 1865. He moved to Alabama in 1871 and, in 1873, negotiated an agreement to act as agent for a tract of land in size, owned by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company, on which he established a colony for German immigrants. Five German families moved to the area in March 1873; in 1874, the town was incorporated and named after Colonel Cullmann (with the town name being Americanized to 'Cullman' with one 'n'). Over the next twenty years, Cullmann encouraged around 100,000 Germans to immigrate to the United States, with many settling in the Cullman area. Cullmann drew on his military engineering training in laying out and planning the town. During this period, Cullman underwent considerable growth. German continued to be widely spoken, and Cullmann himself was the publisher of a German-language newspaper. When Cullmann died in 1895, at the age of 72, his funeral was marked by the attendance of Governor William C. Oates. The site Cullmann selected for his headquarters is now his gravesite. German immigrants also founded St Bernard's Monastery, on the grounds of which is the Ave Maria Grotto, containing 125 miniature reproductions of some of the most famous religious structures of the world. It's Cullman's principal tourist attraction. During the 1890s, Cullman was reported to be a sundown town, where African Americans were not allowed to live. Reprinted in The Ku Klux Klan would maintain a presence in the county throughout the civil rights movement. Erecting signs that deterred African Americans from being within the county at night. This subsequently led to a rise in population of Colony, Alabama which was a safe haven for the discriminated. For many years Cullman was a college town, with Saint Bernard College serving as the home of several hundred students. In the mid-1970s, St. Bernard briefly merged with Sacred Heart College (a two-year Benedictine women's college), to become Southern Benedictine College. That college closed in 1979, and it now operates as St. Bernard Preparatory School. The former site of Sacred Heart College is now the Sacred Heart Monastery, which serves as a retreat center operated by the Benedictine Sisters of Sacred Heart Monastery. During the twentieth century, Cullman developed a more diverse economy, including several manufacturing and distribution facilities. The City of Cullman regularly ranks as a top 'micropolitan' city in the nation. Cullman gained national attention in early 2008, when a special election was held to fill a vacancy in the Alabama House of Representatives. The district that included Cullman elected James C. Fields, an African-American, in that special election. Cullman's German heritage was repressed during World War I and World War II, while the United States was fighting Germany. This was reversed in the 1970s, with renewed interest in the city's history and heritage. Today, Cullman holds an annual Oktoberfest. An honorary \\"B√ºrgermeister\\" is elected for each Oktoberfest. For many years the Oktoberfest did not include alcohol because Cullman was dry, but starting in 2011 the Oktoberfest was able to offer beer. 2011 tornado damage Downtown was significantly damaged by an EF4 tornado during the 2011 Super Outbreak. Hitting on April 27, it destroyed many buildings in downtown and in an east-side residential area, but causing no fatalities. The twister moved northeast towards Arab and Guntersville, killing two Cullman County residents and four or more others. Cullman has since rebuilt and revitalized the downtown area. New zoning laws and alcohol ordinances have allowed for greater expansion and growth in the downtown Cullman area.

History  The original name of the post was Ozark Triangular Division Camp, but before the camp was officially opened on 1 May 1942, the War Department named it Camp Rucker. The post was named in honor of Colonel Edmund W. Rucker, a Civil War Confederate officer, who was given the honorary title of \\"General,\\" and who became an industrial leader in Birmingham after the war. Fort Rucker (situated on of sub-marginal farmland, and formerly a wildlife refuge) was opened on 1 May 1942 as \\"Camp Rucker\\". It had quarters for 3,280 officers and 39,461 enlisted personnel. In September 1942, 1,259 additional acres south of Daleville were acquired for the construction of an airfield to support the training camp. It was known as Ozark Army Airfield until January 1959, when the name was changed to Cairns Army Airfield. The first troops to train at Camp Rucker were those of the 81st Infantry Division; the 81st Division left Rucker for action in the Pacific Theater in March 1943. Three other infantry divisions received training at Camp Rucker during the Second World War‚Äîthe 35th, the 98th, and the 66th. The 66th (Panther) Division left for the European Theater in October 1944. Camp Rucker was also used to train dozens of units of less than division size; these included tank, infantry replacement, and Women's Army Corps units. During the latter part of the Second World War, several hundred German and a few Italian prisoners-of-war were housed in stockades near the railroad east of the warehouse area, on the southern edge of the post. The 91st Infantry Division was sent to Camp Rucker at the end of the war, being deactivated in December 1945. Camp Rucker was inactive from March 1946 until August 1950. It was reopened during the Korean War. The Minnesota Army National Guard's 47th Infantry Division was mobilized and sent to Camp Rucker in the fall of 1950, the division provided cadre that would conduct basic training of soldiers, who would later on be sent as replacements to units in Korea. The 47th Infantry Division would remain at Camp Rucker throughout the war. After another short deactivation, it was again reopened and expanded when it became a helicopter training base. The name was changed to \\"Fort Rucker\\" in October 1955. The Hanchey Army Airfield became the home of the Department of Rotary Wing Training of the Army Aviation School on 5 October 1959, marking the first time the Department was centralized.

He is best known outside Germany for his early lyric poetry, which was set to music in the form of lieder (art songs) by composers such as Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert. Heine's later verse and prose are distinguished by their satirical wit and irony. He is considered part of the Young Germany movement. His radical political views led to many of his works being banned by German authorities‚Äîwhich, however, only added to his fame. He spent the last 25 years of his life as an expatriate in Paris. Early life =Childhood and youth= Heine's mother, \\"Betty\\" Heine was born on 13 December 1797, in D√ºsseldorf, in what was then the Duchy of Berg, into a Jewish family. He was called \\"Harry\\" in childhood but became known as \\"Heinrich\\" after his conversion to Lutheranism in 1825.\\"There was an old rumor, propagated particularly by anti-Semites, that Heine's Jewish name was Chaim, but there is no evidence for it\\". Ludwig B√∂rne: A Memorial, ed. , Camden House, 2006, p. 13 n. 42. Heine's father, Samson Heine (1764‚Äì1828), was a textile merchant. His mother Peira (known as \\"Betty\\"), n√©e van Geldern (1771‚Äì1859), was the daughter of a physician. Heinrich was the eldest of four children. He had a sister, Charlotte, and two brothers, Gustav Heine von Geldern (later Baron Heine- Geldern and publisher of the Viennese newspaper ') and Maximilian, who became a physician in Saint Petersburg.Sammons 1979, pp. 11‚Äì30 Heine was also a third cousin once removed of philosopher and economist Karl Marx, also born to a German Jewish family in the Rhineland, with whom he became a frequent correspondent in later life.Raddatz Karl Marx: A Political Biography D√ºsseldorf was then a small town with a population of around 16,000. The French Revolution and subsequent Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars involving Germany complicated D√ºsseldorf's political history during Heine's childhood. It had been the capital of the Duchy of J√ºlich-Berg, but was under French occupation at the time of his birth.Sammons p. 30 It then went to the Elector of Bavaria before being ceded to Napoleon in 1806, who turned it into the capital of the Grand Duchy of Berg, one of three French states he established in Germany. It was first ruled by Joachim Murat, then by Napoleon himself.In the name of his four-year-old nephew, Napoleon Louis. (Sammons, p. 31) Upon Napoleon's downfall in 1815 it became part of Prussia. Thus Heine's formative years were spent under French influence. The adult Heine would always be devoted to the French for introducing the Napoleonic Code and trial by jury. He glossed over the negative aspects of French rule in Berg: heavy taxation, conscription, and economic depression brought about by the Continental Blockade (which may have contributed to his father's bankruptcy).Sammons p. 32 in Heinrich Heine: Alternative Perspectives 1985‚Äì2005, p. 67 Heine greatly admired Napoleon as the promoter of revolutionary ideals of liberty and equality and loathed the political atmosphere in Germany after Napoleon's defeat, marked by the conservative policies of Austrian chancellor Klemens von Metternich, who attempted to reverse the effects of the French Revolution.Sammons, pages 30 to 35 Heine's parents were not particularly devout. As a young child they sent him to a Jewish school where he learned a smattering of Hebrew, but thereafter he attended Catholic schools. Here he learned French, which would be his second language - although he always spoke it with a German accent. He also acquired a lifelong love for Rhineland folklore.Sammons, pages 35 to 42 In 1814 Heine went to a business school in D√ºsseldorf where he learned to read English, the commercial language of the time.Sammons, page 47 The most successful member of the Heine family was his uncle Salomon Heine, a millionaire banker in Hamburg. In 1816 Heine moved to Hamburg to become an apprentice at Heckscher & Co, his uncle's bank, but displayed little aptitude for business. He learned to hate Hamburg with its commercial ethos, but it would become one of the poles of his life alongside Paris. When he was 18 Heine almost certainly had an unrequited love for his cousin Amalie, Salomon's daughter. Whether he then transferred his affections (equally unsuccessfully) to her sister Therese is unknown.Sammons, pages 42 to 46 This period in Heine's life is not clear but it seems that his father's business deteriorated, making Samson Heine effectively the ward of his brother Salomon.Sammons, pages 47 to 51 =Universities= Salomon realised that his nephew had no talent for trade, and it was decided that Heine should enter the law. So, in 1819, Heine went to the University of Bonn (then in Prussia). Political life in Germany was divided between conservatives and liberals. The conservatives, who were in power, wanted to restore things to the way they were before the French Revolution. They were against German unification because they felt a united Germany might fall victim to revolutionary ideas. Most German states were absolutist monarchies with a censored press. The opponents of the conservatives, the liberals, wanted to replace absolutism with representative, constitutional government, equality before the law and a free press. At the University of Bonn, liberal students were at war with the conservative authorities. Heine was a radical liberal and one of the first things he did after his arrival was to take part in a parade which violated the Carlsbad Decrees, a series of measures introduced by Metternich to suppress liberal political activity. Heine was more interested in studying history and literature than law. The university had engaged the famous literary critic and thinker August Wilhelm Schlegel as a lecturer and Heine heard him talk about the Nibelungenlied and Romanticism. Though he would later mock Schlegel, Heine found in him a sympathetic critic for his early verses. Heine began to acquire a reputation as a poet at Bonn. He also wrote two tragedies, Almansor and William Ratcliff, but they had little success in the theatre.Sammons, pages 55 to 70 After a year at Bonn, Heine left to continue his law studies at the University of G√∂ttingen. Heine hated the town. It was part of Hanover, ruled by the King of Britain, the power Heine blamed for bringing Napoleon down. Here the poet experienced an aristocratic snobbery absent elsewhere. He also hated law as the Historical School of law he had to study was used to bolster the reactionary form of government he opposed. Other events conspired to make Heine loathe this period of his life: he was expelled from a student fraternity for anti-Semitic reasons and he heard the news that his cousin Amalie had become engaged. When Heine challenged another student, Wiebel, to a duel (the first of ten known incidents throughout his life), the authorities stepped in and Heine was suspended from the university for six months. His uncle now decided to send him to the University of Berlin.Sammons, pages 70 to 74 Franz Kugler Heine arrived in Berlin in March 1821. It was the biggest, most cosmopolitan city he had ever visited (its population was about 200,000). The university gave Heine access to notable cultural figures as lecturers: the Sanskritist Franz Bopp and the Homer critic F. A. Wolf, who inspired Heine's lifelong love of Aristophanes. Most important was the philosopher Hegel, whose influence on Heine is hard to gauge. He probably gave Heine and other young students the idea that history had a meaning which could be seen as progressive.Sammons, pages 74 to 81 Heine also made valuable acquaintances in Berlin, notably the liberal Karl August Varnhagen and his Jewish wife Rahel, who held a leading salon. Another friend was the satirist Karl Immermann, who had praised Heine's first verse collection, Gedichte, when it appeared in December 1821.Sammons, pages 81 to 85 During his time in Berlin Heine also joined the Verein f√ºr Cultur und Wissenschaft der Juden, a society which attempted to achieve a balance between the Jewish faith and modernity. Since Heine was not very religious in outlook he soon lost interest, but he also began to investigate Jewish history. He was particularly drawn to the Spanish Jews of the Middle Ages. In 1824 Heine began a historical novel, Der Rabbi von Bacherach, which he never managed to finish.Sammons, pages 89 to 96The Rabbi of Bacharach on Wikisource. In May 1823 Heine left Berlin for good and joined his family at their new home in L√ºneburg. Here he began to write the poems of the cycle Die Heimkehr (\\"The Homecoming\\"). He returned to G√∂ttingen where he was again bored by the law. In September 1824 he decided to take a break and set off on a trip through the Harz mountains. On his return he started writing an account of it, Die Harzreise.Sammons, pages 96 to 107 On 28 June 1825 Heine converted to Protestantism. The Prussian government had been gradually restoring discrimination against Jews. In 1822 it introduced a law excluding Jews from academic posts and Heine had ambitions for a university career. As Heine said in self-justification, his conversion was \\"the ticket of admission into European culture\\". In any event, Heine's conversion, which was reluctant, never brought him any benefits in his career.Sammons, pp. 107‚Äì110 =Julius Campe and first literary successes= Heine now had to search for a job. He was only really suited to writing but it was extremely difficult to be a professional writer in Germany. The market for literary works was small and it was only possible to make a living by writing virtually non-stop. Heine was incapable of doing this so he never had enough money to cover his expenses. Before finding work, Heine visited the North Sea resort of Norderney which inspired the free verse poems of his cycle Die Nordsee.Sammons, pages 113 to 118 First page of first edition of Heine's Buch der Lieder, 1827 In Hamburg one evening in January 1826 Heine met , who would be his chief publisher for the rest of his life. Their stormy relationship has been compared to a marriage. Campe was a liberal who published as many dissident authors as he could. He had developed various techniques for evading the authorities. The laws of the time stated that any book under 320 pages had to be submitted to censorship (the authorities thought long books would cause little trouble as they were unpopular). One way around censorship was to publish dissident works in large print to increase the number of pages beyond 320. The censorship in Hamburg was relatively lax but Campe had to worry about Prussia, the largest German state which had the largest market for books (it was estimated that one-third of the German readership was Prussian). Initially, any book which had passed the censor in a German state was able to be sold in any of the other states but in 1834 this loophole was closed. Campe was reluctant to publish uncensored books as he had bad experience of print runs being confiscated. Heine resisted all censorship; this issue became a bone of contention between the two.Sammons, pages 118 to 124 However, the relationship between author and publisher started well: Campe published the first volume of Reisebilder (\\"Travel Pictures\\") in May 1826. This volume included Die Harzreise, which marked a new style of German travel-writing, mixing Romantic descriptions of Nature with satire. Heine's ' followed in 1827. This was a collection of already published poems. No one expected it would be one of the most popular books of German verse ever published and sales were slow to start with, picking up when composers began setting Heine's poems as Lieder.Sammons, pages 124 to 126 For example, the poem \\"Alln√§chtlich im Traume\\" of the Buch der Lieder was set to music by Robert Schumann as well as by Felix Mendelssohn. It contains the ironic disillusionment which is typical of Heine: Heine, 1829 Alln√§chtlich im Traume seh ich dich, Und sehe dich freundlich gr√º√üen, Und laut aufweinend st√ºrz ich mich Zu deinen s√º√üen F√º√üen. Du siehst mich an wehm√ºtiglich, Und sch√ºttelst das blonde K√∂pfchen; Aus deinen Augen schleichen sich Die Perlentr√§nentr√∂pfchen. Du sagst mir heimlich ein leises Wort, Und gibst mir den Strau√ü von Zypressen. Ich wache auf, und der Strau√ü ist fort, Und das Wort hab ich vergessen. Nightly I see you in dreams ‚Äì you speak, With kindliness sincerest, I throw myself, weeping aloud and weak At your sweet feet, my dearest. You look at me with wistful woe, And shake your golden curls; And stealing from your eyes there flow The teardrops like to pearls. You breathe in my ear a secret word, A garland of cypress for token. I wake; it is gone; the dream is blurred, And forgotten the word that was spoken. (Poetic translation Hal Draper) Starting from the mid-1820s, Heine distanced himself from Romanticism by adding irony, sarcasm and satire into his poetry, and making fun of the sentimental-romantic awe of nature and of figures of speech in contemporary poetry and literature.Neue Gedichte (New Poems), citing: DHA, Vol. 2, p. 15 An example are these lines: Das Fr√§ulein stand am Meere Und seufzte lang und bang. Es r√ºhrte sie so sehre der Sonnenuntergang. Mein Fr√§ulein! Sein sie munter, Das ist ein altes St√ºck; Hier vorne geht sie unter Und kehrt von hinten zur√ºck. A mistress stood by the sea sighing long and anxiously. She was so deeply stirred By the setting sun My Fr√§ulein!, be gay, This is an old play; ahead of you it sets And from behind it returns. The blue flower of Novalis, \\"symbol for the Romantic movement\\", also received withering treatment from Heine during this period, as illustrated by the following quatrains from Lyrisches IntermezzoPerry, Beate Julia, Schumann's Dichterliebe and Early Romantic Poetics: Fragmentation of Desire, Cambridge University Press; 2002, p. 87-88: Am Kreuzweg wird begraben Wer selber brachte sich um; dort w√§chst eine blaue Blume, Die Armes√ºnderblum. Am Kreuzweg stand ich und seufzte; Die Nacht war kalt und stumm. Im Mondenschein bewegte sich langsam Die Armes√ºnderblum. At the cross-road will be buried He who killed himself; There grows a blue flower, Suicide‚Äôs flower. I stood at the cross-road and sighed The night was cold and mute. By the light of the moon moved slowly Suicide‚Äôs flower. Heine became increasingly critical of despotism and reactionary chauvinism in Germany, of nobility and clerics but also of the narrow-mindedness of ordinary people and of the rising German form of nationalism, especially in contrast to the French and the revolution. Nevertheless, he made a point of stressing his love for his Fatherland: > Plant the black, red, gold banner at the summit of the German idea, make it > the standard of free mankind, and I will shed my dear heart's blood for it. > Rest assured, I love the Fatherland just as much as you do. =Travel and the Platen affair= Count von Platen, target of Heine's satire in Die B√§der von Lucca The first volume of travel writings was such a success that Campe pressed Heine for another. Reisebilder II appeared in April 1827. It contains the second cycle of North Sea poems, a prose essay on the North Sea as well as a new work, Ideen: Das Buch Le Grand, which contains the following satire on German censorship:Sammons, pages 127 to 129Heine, Ideen. Das Buch Le Grand, Chapter 12 The German Censors ‚Äî‚Äî idiots ‚Äî‚Äî Heine went to England to avoid what he predicted would be controversy over the publication of this work. In London he cashed a cheque from his uncle for ¬£200 (equal to ¬£ today), much to Salomon's chagrin. Heine was unimpressed by the English: he found them commercial and prosaic, and still blamed them for the defeat of Napoleon.Sammons, pp. 129‚Äì132 On his return to Germany, Cotta, the liberal publisher of Goethe and Schiller, offered Heine a job co-editing a magazine, Politische Annalen, in Munich. Heine did not find work on the newspaper congenial, and instead tried to obtain a professorship at Munich University, with no success.Sammons, pages 132 to 138 After a few months he took a trip to northern Italy, visiting Lucca, Florence and Venice, but was forced to return when he received news that his father had died. This Italian journey resulted in a series of new works: Die Reise von M√ºnchen nach Genua (Journey from Munich to Genoa), Die B√§der von Lucca (The Baths of Lucca) and Die Stadt Lucca (The Town of Lucca).Sammons, pp. 138‚Äì141 Die B√§der von Lucca embroiled Heine in controversy. The aristocratic poet August von Platen had been annoyed by some epigrams by Immermann which Heine had included in the second volume of Reisebilder. He counter-attacked by writing a play, Der romantische √ñdipus, which included anti-Semitic jibes about Heine. Heine was stung and responded by mocking Platen's homosexuality in Die B√§der von Lucca.Sammons, pp. 141‚Äì147 This back-and-forth ad hominem literary polemic has become known as the . Paris years Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People, celebrating France's 1830 revolution =Foreign correspondent= Heine left Germany for France in 1831, settling in Paris for the remainder of his life. His move was prompted by the July Revolution of 1830 that had made Louis-Philippe the \\"Citizen King\\" of the French. Heine shared liberal enthusiasm for the revolution, which he felt had the potential to overturn the conservative political order in Europe.Sammons, pages 150 to 155 Heine was also attracted by the prospect of freedom from German censorship and was interested in the new French utopian political doctrine of Saint-Simonianism. Saint-Simonianism preached a new social order in which meritocracy would replace hereditary distinctions in rank and wealth. There would also be female emancipation and an important role for artists and scientists. Heine frequented some Saint-Simonian meetings after his arrival in Paris but within a few years his enthusiasm for the ideology ‚Äì and other forms of utopianism ‚Äì had waned.See Sammons, pp. 159‚Äì168 Heine soon became a celebrity in France. Paris offered him a cultural richness unavailable in the smaller cities of Germany. He made many famous acquaintances (the closest were G√©rard de Nerval and Hector Berlioz) but he always remained something of an outsider. He had little interest in French literature and wrote everything in German, subsequently translating it into French with the help of a collaborator.Sammons, pages 168 to 171 Heine, 1837 In Paris, Heine earned money working as the French correspondent for one of Cotta's newspapers, the Allgemeine Zeitung. The first event he covered was the Salon of 1831. His articles were eventually collected in a volume entitled Franz√∂sische Zust√§nde (\\"Conditions in France\\").Sammons, pages 172 to 183 Heine saw himself as a mediator between Germany and France. If the two countries understood one another there would be progress. To further this aim he published De l'Allemagne (\\"On Germany\\") in French (begun 1833). In its later German version, the book is divided into two: Zur Geschichte der Religion und Philosophie in Deutschland (\\"On the History of Religion and Philosophy in Germany\\") and Die romantische Schule (\\"The Romantic School\\"). Heine was deliberately attacking Madame de Sta√´l's book De l'Allemagne (1813) which he viewed as reactionary, Romantic and obscurantist. He felt de Sta√´l had portrayed a Germany of \\"poets and thinkers\\", dreamy, religious, introverted and cut off from the revolutionary currents of the modern world. Heine thought that such an image suited the oppressive German authorities. He also had an Enlightenment view of the past, seeing it as mired in superstition and atrocities. \\"Religion and Philosophy in Germany\\" describes the replacement of traditional \\"spiritualist\\" religion by a pantheism that pays attention to human material needs. According to Heine, pantheism had been repressed by Christianity and had survived in German folklore. He predicted that German thought would prove a more explosive force than the French Revolution.Sammons, pages 188 to 197 Heine's wife \\"Mathilde\\" (Crescence Eug√©nie Mirat) Heine had had few serious love affairs, but in late 1834 he made the acquaintance of a 19-year-old Paris shopgirl, Crescence Eug√©nie Mirat, whom he nicknamed \\"Mathilde\\". Heine reluctantly began a relationship with her. She was illiterate, knew no German, and had no interest in cultural or intellectual matters. Nevertheless, she moved in with Heine in 1836 and lived with him for the rest of his life (they were married in 1841).Sammons, pages 197 to 205 =Young Germany and Ludwig B√∂rne= Heine and his fellow radical exile in Paris, Ludwig B√∂rne, had become the role models for a younger generation of writers who were given the name \\"Young Germany\\". They included Karl Gutzkow, Heinrich Laube, Theodor Mundt and Ludolf Wienbarg. They were liberal, but not actively political. Nevertheless, they still fell foul of the authorities. In 1835 Gutzkow published a novel, Wally die Zweiflerin (\\"Wally the Sceptic\\"), which contained criticism of the institution of marriage and some mildly erotic passages. In November of that year, the German Diet consequently banned publication of works by the Young Germans in Germany and ‚Äì on Metternich's insistence ‚Äì Heine's name was added to their number. Heine, however, continued to comment on German politics and society from a distance. His publisher was able to find some ways of getting around the censors and he was still free, of course, to publish in France.Sammons, pp. 205‚Äì218 B√∂rne. Portrait by Oppenheim. Heine's relationship with his fellow dissident Ludwig B√∂rne was troubled. Since B√∂rne did not attack religion or traditional morality like Heine, the German authorities hounded him less although they still banned his books as soon as they appeared. B√∂rne was the idol of German immigrant workers in Paris. He was also a republican, while Heine was not. Heine regarded B√∂rne, with his admiration for Robespierre, as a puritanical neo-Jacobin and remained aloof from him in Paris, which upset B√∂rne, who began to criticise him (mostly semi-privately). In February 1837, B√∂rne died. When Heine heard that Gutzkow was writing a biography of B√∂rne, he began work on his own, severely critical \\"memorial\\" of the man. When the book was published in 1840 it was universally disliked by the radicals and served to alienate Heine from his public. Even his enemies admitted that B√∂rne was a man of integrity so Heine's ad hominem attacks on him were viewed as being in poor taste. Heine had made personal attacks on B√∂rne's closest friend Jeanette Wohl so Jeannette's husband challenged Heine to a duel. It was the last Heine ever fought ‚Äì he received a flesh wound in the hip. Before fighting, he decided to safeguard Mathilde's future in the event of his death by marrying her.Sammons, pages 233 to 242 Illustration by Max Liebermann for a 1920s edition of Heine's historical novel Der Rabbi von Bacherach Heine continued to write reports for Cotta's Allgemeine Zeitung (and, when Cotta died, for his son and successor). One event which really galvanised him was the 1840 Damascus Affair in which Jews in Damascus had been subject to blood libel and accused of murdering an old Catholic monk. This led to a wave of anti-Semitic persecution. The French government, aiming at imperialism in the Middle East and not wanting to offend the Catholic party, had failed to condemn the outrage. On the other hand, the Austrian consul in Damascus had assiduously exposed the blood libel as a fraud. For Heine, this was a reversal of values: reactionary Austria standing up for the Jews while revolutionary France temporised. Heine responded by dusting off and publishing his unfinished novel about the persecution of Jews in the Middle Ages, Der Rabbi von Bacherach.Sammons, pages 243 to 244 =Political poetry and Karl Marx= German poetry took a more directly political turn when the new Frederick William IV ascended the Prussian throne in 1840. Initially it was thought he might be a \\"popular monarch\\" and during this honeymoon period of his early reign (1840‚Äì42) censorship was relaxed. This led to the emergence of popular political poets (so-called Tendenzdichter), including Hoffmann von Fallersleben (author of Deutschlandlied, the German anthem), Ferdinand Freiligrath and Georg Herwegh. Heine looked down on these writers on aesthetic grounds ‚Äì they were bad poets in his opinion ‚Äì but his verse of the 1840s became more political too. Heine's mode was satirical attack: against the Kings of Bavaria and Prussia (he never for one moment shared the belief that Frederick William IV might be more liberal); against the political torpor of the German people; and against the greed and cruelty of the ruling class. The most popular of Heine's political poems was his least typical, Die schlesischen Weber (\\"The Silesian Weavers\\"), based on the uprising of weavers in Peterswaldau in 1844.Sammons, pp. 253‚Äì260 Marx's Vorw√§rts, featuring Heine's poem \\"Die schlesischen Weber\\" In October 1843, Heine's distant relative and German revolutionary, Karl Marx, and his wife Jenny von Westphalen arrived in Paris after the Prussian government had suppressed Marx's radical newspaper. The Marx family settled in Rue Vaneau. Marx was an admirer of Heine and his early writings show Heine's influence. In December Heine met the Marxes and got on well with them. He published several poems, including Die schlesischen Weber, in Marx's new journal Vorw√§rts (\\"Forwards\\"). Ultimately Heine's ideas of revolution through sensual emancipation and Marx's scientific socialism were incompatible, but both writers shared the same negativity and lack of faith in the bourgeoisie. In the isolation he felt after the B√∂rne debacle, Marx's friendship came as a relief to Heine, since he did not really like the other radicals. On the other hand, he did not share Marx's faith in the industrial proletariat and remained on the fringes of socialist circles. The Prussian government, angry at the publication of Vorw√§rts, put pressure on France to deal with its authors, and Marx was deported to Belgium in January 1845. Heine could not be expelled from the country because he had the right of residence in France, having been born under French occupation.Sammons, page 285 Thereafter Heine and Marx maintained a sporadic correspondence, but in time their admiration for one another faded.Sammons, pp. 260‚Äì265 Heine always had mixed feelings about communism. He believed its radicalism and materialism would destroy much of the European culture that he loved and admired. In the French edition of \\"Lutetia\\" Heine wrote, one year before he died: \\"This confession, that the future belongs to the Communists, I made with an undertone of the greatest fear and sorrow and, oh!, this undertone by no means is a mask! Indeed, with fear and terror I imagine the time, when those dark iconoclasts come to power: with their raw fists they will batter all marble images of my beloved world of art, they will ruin all those fantastic anecdotes that the poets loved so much, they will chop down my Laurel forests and plant potatoes and, oh!, the herbs chandler will use my Book of Songs to make bags for coffee and snuff for the old women of the future ‚Äì oh!, I can foresee all this and I feel deeply sorry thinking of this decline threatening my poetry and the old world order ‚Äì And yet, I freely confess, the same thoughts have a magical appeal upon my soul which I cannot resist .... In my chest there are two voices in their favour which cannot be silenced .... because the first one is that of logic ... and as I cannot object to the premise \\"that all people have the right to eat\\", I must defer to all the conclusions....The second of the two compelling voices, of which I am talking, is even more powerful than the first, because it is the voice of hatred, the hatred I dedicate to this common enemy that constitutes the most distinctive contrast to communism and that will oppose the angry giant already at the first instance ‚Äì I am talking about the party of the so- called advocates of nationality in Germany, about those false patriots whose love for the fatherland only exists in the shape of imbecile distaste of foreign countries and neighbouring peoples and who daily pour their bile especially on France\\".Heine's draft for Pr√©face in the French edition of Lutezia (1855), DHA, Vol. 13/1, p. 294. In October‚ÄìDecember 1843, Heine made a journey to Hamburg to see his aged mother and to patch things up with Campe with whom he had had a quarrel. He was reconciled with the publisher who agreed to provide Mathilde with an annuity for the rest of her life after Heine's death. Heine repeated the trip with his wife in July‚ÄìOctober 1844 to see Uncle Salomon, but this time things did not go so well. It was the last time Heine would ever leave France.Sammons, pages 265 to 268 At the time, Heine was working on two linked but antithetical poems with Shakespearean titles: Deutschland: Ein Winterm√§rchen (Germany. A Winter's Tale) and Atta Troll: Ein Sommernachtstraum (Atta Troll: A Midsummer Night's Dream). The former is based on his journey to Germany in late 1843 and outdoes the radical poets in its satirical attacks on the political situation in the country.Sammons, pages 268 to 275 Atta Troll (actually begun in 1841 after a trip to the Pyrenees) mocks the literary failings Heine saw in the radical poets, particularly Freiligrath. It tells the story of the hunt for a runaway bear, Atta Troll, who symbolises many of the attitudes Heine despised, including a simple-minded egalitarianism and a religious view which makes God in the believer's image (Atta Troll conceives God as an enormous, heavenly polar bear). Atta Troll's cubs embody the nationalistic views Heine loathed. Atta Troll was not published until 1847, but Deutschland appeared in 1844 as part of a collection Neue Gedichte (\\"New Poems\\"), which gathered all the verse Heine had written since 1831.Sammons, pages 275 to 278 In the same year Uncle Salomon died. This put a stop to Heine's annual subsidy of 4,800 francs. Salomon left Heine and his brothers 8,000 francs each in his will. Heine's cousin Carl, the inheritor of Salomon's business, offered to pay him 2,000 francs a year at his discretion. Heine was furious; he had expected much more from the will and his campaign to make Carl revise its terms occupied him for the next two years.Sammons, pages 278 to 285 In 1844, Heine wrote series of musical feuilletons over several different music seasons discussing the music of the day. His review of the musical season of 1844, written in Paris on 25 April of that year, is his first reference to Lisztomania, the intense fan frenzy directed toward Franz Liszt during his performances. However, Heine was not always honorable in his musical criticism. That same month, he wrote to Liszt suggesting that he might like to look at a newspaper review he had written of Liszt's performance before his concert; he indicated that it contained comments Liszt would not like. Liszt took this as an attempt to extort money for a positive review and did not meet Heine. Heine's review subsequently appeared on 25 April in Musikalische Berichte aus Paris and attributed Liszt's success to lavish expenditures on bouquets and to the wild behaviour of his hysterical female \\"fans\\". Liszt then broke relations with Heine. Liszt was not the only musician to be blackmailed by Heine for the nonpayment of \\"appreciation money\\". Meyerbeer had both lent and given money to Heine, but after refusing to hand over a further 500 francs was repaid by being dubbed \\"a music corrupter\\" in Heine's poem Die Menge tut es.Walker, Alan, Franz Liszt: The virtuoso years, 1811‚Äì1847, Cornell University Press; Rev. ed edition, 1997, p. 164 =Last years: the \\"mattress-grave\\"= Heine on his sickbed, 1851 In May 1848, Heine, who had not been well, suddenly fell paralyzed and had to be confined to bed. He would not leave what he called his \\"mattress-grave\\" (Matratzengruft) until his death eight years later. He also experienced difficulties with his eyes.Sammons, pages 295 to 297 It had been suggested that he suffered from multiple sclerosis or syphilis, although in 1997 it was confirmed through an analysis of the poet's hair that he had suffered from chronic lead poisoning.Bundesgesundheitsbl ‚Äì Gesundheitsforsch ‚Äì Gesundheitsschutz 2005, 48 (2):246‚Äì250 (in German) He bore his sufferings stoically and he won much public sympathy for his plight.Sammons, page 297 His illness meant he paid less attention than he might otherwise have done to the revolutions which broke out in France and Germany in 1848. He was sceptical about the Frankfurt Assembly and continued to attack the King of Prussia. Heine's grave in Paris When the revolution collapsed, Heine resumed his oppositional stance. At first he had some hope Louis Napoleon might be a good leader in France but he soon began to share the opinion of Marx towards him as the new emperor began to crack down on liberalism and socialism.Sammons, pages 298 to 302 In 1848 Heine also returned to religious faith. In fact, he had never claimed to be an atheist. Nevertheless, he remained sceptical of organised religion.Sammons, pages 305 to 310 He continued to work from his sickbed: on the collections of poems Romanzero and Gedichte (1853 und 1854), on the journalism collected in Lutezia, and on his unfinished memoirs.See Sammons, pages 310 to 338 During these final years Heine had a love affair with the young Camille Selden, who visited him regularly.Sammons, pages 341 to 343 He died on 17 February 1856 and was interred in the Paris Cimeti√®re de Montmartre. His tomb was designed by Danish sculptor Louis Hasselriis. It includes Heine's poem Where? () engraved on three sides of the tombstone. Wo wird einst des Wanderm√ºden Letzte Ruhest√§tte sein? Unter Palmen in dem S√ºden? Unter Linden an dem Rhein? Werd ich wo in einer W√ºste Eingescharrt von fremder Hand? Oder ruh ich an der K√ºste Eines Meeres in dem Sand? Immerhin! Mich wird umgeben Gotteshimmel, dort wie hier, Und als Totenlampen schweben Nachts die Sterne √ºber mir. Where shall I, the wander-wearied, Find my haven and my shrine? Under palms will I be buried? Under lindens on the Rhine? Shall I lie in desert reaches, Buried by a stranger's hand ? Or upon the well-loved beaches, Covered by the friendly sand? Well, what matter ! God has given Wider spaces there than here. And the stars that swing in heaven Shall be lamps above my bier. (translation in verse by L.U.) His wife Mathilde survived him, dying in 1883. The couple had no children.Sammons, pp. 343‚Äì344 Legacy Among the thousands of books burned on Berlin's Opernplatz in 1933, following the Nazi raid on the Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft, were works by Heinrich Heine. To commemorate the terrible event, one of the most famous lines of Heine's 1821 play Almansor was engraved in the ground at the site: \\"Das war ein Vorspiel nur, dort wo man B√ºcher verbrennt, verbrennt man auch am Ende Menschen.\\" (\\"That was but a prelude; where they burn books, they will ultimately burn people as well.\\" In the play it is the Muslim Hassan, who is saying these words, when he heard that the Christian conquerors had burned the scriptures of the Quran at the marketplace of Granada.)Heinrich Heine, Gesamtausgabe der Werke; Hrsg. Manfred Windfuhr (Hamburg 1973-1997), Bd. 5, page 16 In 1834, 99 years before Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party seized power in Germany, Heine wrote in his work \\"The History of Religion and Philosophy in Germany\\": > Christianity ‚Äì and that is its greatest merit ‚Äì has somewhat mitigated that > brutal Germanic love of war, but it could not destroy it. Should that > subduing talisman, the cross, be shattered, the frenzied madness of the > ancient warriors, that insane Berserk rage of which Nordic bards have spoken > and sung so often, will once more burst into flame. This talisman is > fragile, and the day will come when it will collapse miserably. Then the > ancient stony gods will rise from the forgotten debris and rub the dust of a > thousand years from their eyes, and finally Thor with his giant hammer will > jump up and smash the Gothic cathedrals. (...) > Do not smile at my advice ‚Äì the advice of a dreamer who warns you against > Kantians, Fichteans, and philosophers of nature. Do not smile at the > visionary who anticipates the same revolution in the realm of the visible as > has taken place in the spiritual. Thought precedes action as lightning > precedes thunder. German thunder is of true Germanic character; it is not > very nimble, but rumbles along ponderously. Yet, it will come and when you > hear a crashing such as never before has been heard in the world's history, > then you know that the German thunderbolt has fallen at last. At that uproar > the eagles of the air will drop dead, and lions in the remotest deserts of > Africa will hide in their royal dens. A play will be performed in Germany > which will make the French Revolution look like an innocent idyll. = Nazi interpretations of Heine = Heine's writings were abhorred by the Nazis and one of their political mouthpieces, the V√∂lkischer Beobachter, made noteworthy efforts to attack him. Within the pantheon of the \\"Jewish cultural intelligentsia\\" chosen for anti-Semitic demonization, perhaps nobody was the recipient of more National Socialist vitriol than Heinrich Heine. When a memorial to Heine was completed in 1926, the paper lamented that Hamburg had erected a \\"Jewish Monument to Heine and Damascus...one in which Alljuda ruled!\\".\\"Ein Heinrich Heine-Denkmal in Hamburg,\\" V√∂lkischer Beobachter, October 1926; as found in Heinrich Heine im Dritten Reich und im Exil by Hartmut Steinecke (Paderborn: Sch√∂ningh, 2008), p. 10-12. Editors for the V√∂lkischer Beobachter referred to Heine's writing as degenerate on multiple occasions as did Alfred Rosenberg.Alfred Rosenberg, The Myth of the 20th Century (Mythus des XX. Jahrhunderts): An Evaluation of the Spiritual- Intellectual Confrontations of Our Age. https://archive.org/stream/TheMythOfTheTwentiethCentury_400/MythOfThe20thCentury_djvu.txt Correspondingly, during the rise of the Third Reich, Heine's writings were banned and burned.Rupert Colley (2010). Nazi Germany In An Hour. History In An Hour. p. 19-20Jonathan Skolnik, Jewish Pasts, German Fictions: History, Memory, and Minority Culture in Germany, 1824-1955 (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2014), p. 147 During the Nazi regime, Heinrich Heine became discredited as author of popular German folksongs (i.e. the lyrics of ‚ÄúDie Lorelei‚Äù) in an effort to dismiss and hide Jewish contribution to German art and culture. Instead of listing Heine as the author, in songs that could not be burnt, Die Lorelei was said to be written by an ‚Äúunknown author‚Äù (unbekannter Dichter). =Music= Many composers have set Heine's works to music. They include Robert Schumann (especially his Lieder cycle Dichterliebe), Friedrich Silcher (who wrote a popular setting of \\"Die Lorelei\\", one of Heine's best known poems), Franz Schubert, Felix Mendelssohn, Fanny Mendelssohn, Johannes Brahms, Hugo Wolf, Richard Strauss, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Edward MacDowell, Clara Schumann and Richard Wagner; and in the 20th century Nikolai Medtner, Hans Werner Henze, Carl Orff, Lord Berners, Paul Lincke, Yehezkel Braun, Marcel TybergBuffalo News. Performers revel in premiere of Tyberg songs and Friedrich Baumfelder (who wrote another setting of \\"Die Lorelei\\", as well as \\"Die blauen Fr√ºhlingsaugen\\" and \\"Wir wuchsen in demselben Thal\\" in his Zwei Lieder). Heine's play William Ratcliff was used for the libretti of operas by C√©sar Cui (William Ratcliff) and Pietro Mascagni (Guglielmo Ratcliff). Frank van der Stucken composed a \\"symphonic prologue\\" to the same play. In 1964, Gert Westphal and the Attila-Zoller Quartet released the vinyl \\"Heinrich Heine Lyrik und Jazz\\". In 2006 Philips/Universal launched a republication on CD. Wilhelm Killmayer set 37 of his poems in his song book ', subtitled Ein Liederbuch nach Gedichten von Heinrich Heine, in 1994. Morton Feldman's I Met Heine on the Rue F√ºrstemberg was inspired by a vision he had of the dead Heine as he walked through Heine's old neighborhood in Paris: \\"One early morning in Paris I was walking along the small street on the Left Bank where Delacroix's studio is, just as it was more than a century ago. I'd read his journals, where he tells of Chopin, going for a drive, the poet Heine dropping in, a refugee from Germany. Nothing had changed in the street. And I saw Heine up at the corner, walking toward me. He almost reached me. I had this intense feeling for him, you know, the Jewish exile. I saw him. Then I went back to my place and wrote my work, I Met Heine on the Rue F√ºrstemberg.\\" =Controversy= Statue of Lorelei; the Lorelei Fountain ‚Äì Heine Memorial ‚Äì is located in the Bronx, New York City In the 1890s, amidst a flowering of affection for Heine leading up to the centennial of his birth, plans were made to honor Heine with a memorial; these were strongly supported by one of Heine's greatest admirers, Elisabeth of Bavaria, Empress of Austria. The empress commissioned a statue from the sculptor Louis Hasselriis. This statue, originally located at Achilleion, Empress Elisabeth's palace in Corfu, was later removed by Kaiser Wilhelm II after he acquired Achilleion in 1907, but it eventually found a home in Toulon.Richard S. Levy, Heine Monument Controversy, in Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, ABC-CLIO, 2005, p.295 This became the inspiration for Tony Harrison's 1992 film-poem, The Gaze of the Gorgon. Another memorial, a sculpted fountain, was commissioned for D√ºsseldorf. While at first the plan met with enthusiasm, the concept was gradually bogged down in anti-Semitic, nationalist, and religious criticism; by the time the fountain was finished, there was no place to put it. Through the intervention of German American activists, the memorial was ultimately transplanted into the Bronx, New York City (in Philadelphia already in 1855 was printed the complete edition of Heine's works in German language).Rolf Hosfeld, Heinrich Heine: Die Erfindung des europ√§ischen Intellektuellen - Biographie (M√ºnchen 2014), page 153 While the memorial is known in English as the Lorelei Fountain, Germans refer to it as the Heinrich Heine Memorial.Sturm und Drang Over a Memorial to Heinrich Heine. The New York Times, 27 May 2007. Also, after years of controversy,\\"West German Universities: What to Call Them?\\" by John Vinocur, The New York Times, 31 March 1982 the University of D√ºsseldorf was named Heinrich Heine University. Today the city honours its poet with a boulevard (Heinrich-Heine- Allee) and a modern monument. In Israel, the attitude to Heine has long been the subject of debate between secularists, who number him among the most prominent figures of Jewish history, and the religious who consider his conversion to Christianity to be an unforgivable act of betrayal. Due to such debates, the city of Tel Aviv delayed naming a street for Heine, and the street finally chosen to bear his name is located in a rather desolate industrial zone rather than in the vicinity of Tel Aviv University, suggested by some public figures as the appropriate location. Ha-‚ÄòIr (◊î◊¢◊ô◊® ‚Äì The City, a left-leaning Tel Aviv magazine) sarcastically suggested that \\"The Exiling of Heine Street\\" symbolically re-enacted the course of Heine's own life. Since then, a street in the Yemin Moshe neighborhood of JerusalemJewish Postcards from... haGalil onLine. and, in Haifa, a street with a beautiful square and a community center have been named after Heine. A Heine Appreciation Society is active in Israel, led by prominent political figures from both the left and right camps. His quote about burning books is prominently displayed in the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Jerusalem. (It is also displayed in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and in the pavement in Frankfurt am Main).

G. Wells' Things to Come) is a 1936 British black-and-white science fiction film from United Artists, produced by Alexander Korda, directed by William Cameron Menzies, and written by H. G. Wells. The film stars Raymond Massey, Edward Chapman, Ralph Richardson, Margaretta Scott, Cedric Hardwicke, Maurice Braddell, Derrick De Marney, and Ann Todd. The dialogue and plot were devised by H. G. Wells as \\"a new story\\" meant to display the \\"social and political forces and possibilities\\" that he had outlined in his 1933 story The Shape of Things to Come, a work he considered less a novel than a \\"discussion\\" in fictional form that presented itself as the notes of a 22nd-century diplomat.H. G. Wells, Things to Come ‚Äì A Film Story (London: Cresset, 1935), p. 9. The film was also influenced by previous works, including his 1897 story \\"A Story of the Days to Come\\" and his 1931 work on society and economics, The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind. The cultural historian Christopher Frayling called Things to Come \\"a landmark in cinematic design\\". Plot In the city of Everytown in southern England, businessman John Cabal (Raymond Massey) cannot enjoy Christmas Day, 1940, with the news everywhere of possible war. His guest, Harding (Maurice Braddell), shares his worries, while another friend, the over-optimistic Pippa Passworthy (Edward Chapman), believes it will not come to pass, and if it does, it will accelerate technological progress. An aerial bombing raid on the city that night results in general mobilisation and then global war. Months later, Cabal, now a Royal Air Force airman piloting a Hawker Fury, shoots down an enemy aircraft dropping gas on the British countryside. He lands and pulls the badly injured enemy pilot (John Clements) from the wreckage. As they dwell on the madness of war, they put on their gas masks, as poison gas drifts in their direction. When a young girl runs towards them the wounded pilot insists she take his mask, choosing to accept death to save her life. Cabal takes the girl to his aeroplane, pausing to leave the doomed man a revolver. The pilot dwells on the irony that he may have gassed the child's family and yet he has sacrificed his own life in order to save her. A gun shot is then heard. The war continues into the 1960s, long enough for the people of the world to have forgotten why they are fighting. Humanity enters a new Dark Age. Every city in the world is in ruins, the economy has been devastated by hyperinflation, and there is little technology left apart from weapons of war. By 1966 the enemy's armies and navies have been defeated, but their greatly depleted air force is deploying a biological weapon called the \\"wandering sickness\\" in a final desperate bid for victory. Dr. Harding and his daughter struggle to find a cure, but with little equipment it is hopeless. The plague kills half of humanity and extinguishes the last vestiges of government. By 1970, the warlord Rudolf (Ralph Richardson), known as the \\"Boss\\", has become the chieftain of Everytown and eradicated the pestilence by shooting the infected. He has started yet another war, this time against the \\"hill people\\" of the Floss Valley to obtain coal and shale to render into oil so his ragtag collection of prewar planes can fly again. On May Day 1970, a sleek new aeroplane lands in Everytown, startling the inhabitants who have not seen a new machine in many years. The pilot, John Cabal, emerges and proclaims that the last surviving band of engineers and mechanics known as \\"World Communications\\" have formed a civilisation of airmen called \\"Wings Over the World\\", based in Basra, Iraq. They have outlawed war and are rebuilding civilisation throughout the Near East and the Mediterranean. Cabal considers the Boss and his band of warlords to be brigands, but offers them the opportunity to join them in rebuilding the world. The Boss immediately rejects the offer and takes Cabal prisoner, forcing him to work for his mechanic Gordon, who struggles to keep the Boss's biplanes airworthy. Gordon takes an Avro 504K up for a test flight and heads for Iraq to alert World Communications. Gigantic flying wing aircraft arrive over Everytown and saturate its population with sleeping gas globes. The Boss orders his air force to attack, but the obsolete fighters inflict little damage. The people awaken shortly thereafter to find themselves under the control of Wings Over the World and the Boss dead from a fatal allergic reaction to the sleeping gas. Cabal observes, \\"Dead, and his old world dead with him ... and with a new world beginning ... And now for the rule of the Airmen and a new life for mankind\\". A montage follows, showing decades of technological progress, beginning with Cabal explaining plans for global consolidation by Wings Over the World. By 2036, mankind lives in modern underground cities, including the new Everytown. Civilisation is at last devoted to peace and scientific progress. All is not well, however. The sculptor Theotocopulos (Cedric Hardwicke) incites the populace to demand a \\"rest\\" from all the rush of progress, symbolised by the coming first manned flight around the Moon. The modern-day Luddites are opposed by Oswald Cabal, the head of the governing council and grandson of John Cabal. Oswald Cabal's daughter Catherine (Pearl Argyle) and Maurice Passworthy (Kenneth Villiers) insist on manning the capsule. When a mob later forms and rushes to destroy the space gun, used to propel the projectile toward the Moon, Cabal launches it ahead of schedule. Later, after the projectile is just a tiny light in the immense night sky, Oswald Cabal delivers a stirring philosophical monologue about what is to come for mankind to his troubled and questioning friend, Raymond Passworthy (Chapman), the father of Maurice. He speaks passionately for progress and humanity's unending quest for knowledge and advancement as it journeys out into immensity of space to conquer the stars and beyond. He concludes with the rhetorical questions, \\"All the universe or nothing? Which shall it be, Passworthy? Which shall it be? ...\\" Cast * Raymond Massey as John Cabal/Oswald Cabal * Edward Chapman as Pippa Passworthy/Raymond Passworthy * Ralph Richardson as Rudolf a.k.a.

Production Things to Come sets out a future history from 1940 to 2036. In the screenplay, or \\"treatment\\"H. G. Wells, Things to Come ‚Äì A Film Story (London: Cresset, 1935), p. 11. that Wells published in 1935, before the film was released, the story ends in the year \\"A.D. 2054\\".H. G. Wells, Things to Come: A Film (London: Cresset, 1935), pp. 91‚Äì93; Wells mentions the date four times on these pages, but in the \\"Introductory Remarks\\", he gives the date as \\"A.D. 2055\\" (p. xi) Wells is sometimes incorrectly assumed to have had a degree of control over the project that was unprecedented for a screenwriter, and personally supervised nearly every aspect of the film. Posters and the main title bill the film as \\"H. G. Wells' Things to Come\\", with \\"an Alexander Korda production\\" appearing in smaller type. In fact, Wells ultimately had no control over the finished product, with the result that many scenes, although shot, were either truncated or not included in the finished film.Cooper, Nick. \\"Things to Come Viewing Notes\\", Network Blu-Ray, 2012, page 14 The rough-cut reputedly ran to 130 minutes; the version submitted to the British Board of Film Censors was 117m 13s; it was released as 108m 40s (later cut to 98m 06s) in the UK, and 96m 24s in the United States (see below for later versions).Cooper, Nick. \\"Things to Come Viewing Notes\\", Network Blu-Ray, 2012, page 18 Wells's script (or \\"film treatment\\") and selected production notes were published in book form in 1935 and reprinted in 1940 and 1975. An academic edition annotated by Leon Stover was published in 2007. The script contains many scenes that were either never filmed or no longer exist, although the extant footage also includes scenes not in the published script (e.g. the Boss's victory banquet after the capture of the colliery).Cooper, Nick. \\"Things to Come Viewing Notes\\", Network Blu-Ray, 2012, page 17 Wells originally wanted the music to be recorded in advance, and have the film constructed around the music, but this would have impeded editing, and so the score, by Arthur Bliss, was fitted to the film afterwards in a more conventional way. A concert suite drawn from the film has remained popular; as of 2015, there are numerous recordings of it in print. After filming had already begun, the Hungarian abstract artist and experimental filmmaker L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy was commissioned to produce some of the effects sequences for the re-building of Everytown. Moholy-Nagy's approach was partly to treat it as an abstract light show, but only some 90 seconds of material was used, e.g. a protective-suited figure behind corrugated glass. In the autumn of 1975 a researcher found a further four sequences which had been discarded. The art design in the film is by Vincent Korda, brother of the producer. The futuristic city of Everytown in the film is based on London: a facsimile of St Paul's Cathedral can be seen in the background. Reception Things to Come was voted the ninth best British film of 1936. It was the 16th most popular film at the British box office in 1935‚Äì36.\\"The Film Business in the US and Britain during the 1930s\\" by John Sedgwick and Michael Pokorny, The Economic History ReviewNew Series, Vol. 58, No. 1 (Feb., 2005), pp.79-112 Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a mixed review. Although Greene made it clear that \\"a third of the film is magnificent\\", the second third (as the world of tomorrow reverts to barbarism and anarchy) seemed implausible, and the last third of the film with the introduction of the \\"Great Conspiracy\\" (an international force of airmen bent on restoring Earth's former glory) begins to lose all interest for Greene. The optimism and idealism comes off as naive for Greene. (reprinted in: ) Science fiction historian Gary Westfahl has stated: \\"Things to Come qualifies as the first true masterpiece of science fiction cinema, and those who complain about its awkward pace and uninvolving characters are not understanding Wells's message, which is that the lives and actions of individuals are unimportant when compared to the progress and destiny of the entire human race\\".Wells, H.G.. Gary Westfahl's Bio-Encyclopedia of Science Fiction Film. Retrieved 21 January 2014. During early development of what would become 2001: A Space Odyssey, Arthur C. Clarke had Stanley Kubrick watch Things to Come as an example of a grounded science fiction film; Kubrick, however, disliked it.Arthur C. Clarke, The Lost Worlds of 2001 (London: Sidgwick and Jackson, 1972), pg. 35. After seeing 2001, Frederik Pohl of Galaxy Science Fiction complained in a 1968 editorial that Things to Come was the most recent serious film with a large budget, good actors, and a science fiction screenwriter. The film is recognised by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2005: AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores ‚Äì Nominated Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 93%, based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 7.46/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Eerily prescient in its presentation of a dystopian future, Things to Come's special effects may be somewhat dated, but its potent ideas haven't aged at all\\". Duration, releases, and surviving versions The rough-cut of the film was 130 minutes in length, while the version submitted for classification by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) was 117m 13s.Things to Come at BBFC By the time of the 21 February 1936 UK premiere and initial release, this had been reduced to 108m 41s, while the American print premiered on 18 April 1936 was further cut to 96m 31s. By late 1936, a 98m 07s print was in circulation in the UK, and a 76m 07s print was resubmitted for classification by the BBFC and was passed ‚Äì after further cuts ‚Äì at 72m 13s for reissued by Exclusive FIlms in 1943. The 96m 31s American print was cut down to 93m 19s by the removal of three sections of footage for a reissue by British Lion Films in 1948, and subsequently to 92m 44s by the removal of one more segment. A continuity script exists for a version of approximately 106m 04s, which contains all the material in the 96m 31s and 92m 44s versions, plus a number of other sequences. It is not known if a version of this duration was actually in circulation at any time, or if it was simply an intermediate stage between the premiere and release versions.Cooper, Nick. \\"Things to Come Viewing Notes\\", Network Blu-Ray, 2012, pages 24‚Äì26 For many years, the principal surviving version of the film was the 92m 44s print (in countries using PAL or SECAM video systems, it runs to 89m exactly). From at least the late-1970s until 2007, this was the only version \\"officially\\" available from the rights holders in the UK. In the United States, although the 92m 44s version was most prevalent, a version was also in circulation that included the four pieces of footage that were in the 96m 31s print, but not the 92m 44s version, although due to other cuts, actually ran shorter than the latter. Home video A cut version of the 92m 44s print was digitally restored and colourised by Legend Films, under the supervision of Ray Harryhausen (who had no connection with the making of the film whatsoever), and released on DVD in the United States in early 2007. In May 2007, Network DVD in the UK released a digitally restored copy of the 96m 31s version, the longest version remaining of the film. The two-disc set also contains a \\"Virtual Extended Version\\" with most of the missing and unfilmed parts represented by production photographs and script extracts. In 2011 Network released an updated and expanded version of this edition on Blu-ray in HD. The Criterion Collection released the 96m 31s print on DVD and Blu-ray in North America on 18 June 2013. This includes the unused Moholy-Nagy footage as an extra.The Criterion Collection: Things to Come Copyright status Although the film lapsed into the public domain in the US in 1964 due to non- renewal,see Copyright Act of 1909 copyright remained in force in the UK, the European Union, and elsewhere. In the UK, copyright for films as \\"dramatic works\\" subsists for seventy years after the end of the year of release, or the death of either the director, the writer (or author of original story), or the composer of original music, whichever is the latest. As the composer, Arthur Bliss, did not die until 1975, copyright will not expire until after 31 December 2045. The current copyright holder is ITV Global Entertainment Ltd., while the longest surviving original nitrate print is held by the BFI National Archive, a copy of the 96m 31s print donated by London Films to the newly formed National Film Archive in March 1936.Cooper, Nick. \\"Things to Come Viewing Notes\\", Network Blu-Ray, 2012, page 20 The film came back into copyright in the US in 1996 under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA),Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the US which, among other measures, amended US copyright law to reinstate copyright on films of non-US origin if they were still in copyright in their country of origin. The URAA was subsequently challenged in Golan v. Gonzales, initially unsuccessfully, later with partial success, but the challenge was ultimately defeated in Golan v. Holder and a new principle established that international agreements could indeed restore copyright to works which had previously come into the public domain.

It was first in beta in 1996 and was released in June 1997. Netscape Communicator addressed the problem of Netscape Navigator 3.x being used as both the name of the suite and the browser contained within it by renaming the suite to Netscape Communicator. It included more groupware features intended to appeal to enterprises. In February 1998, Netscape announced that Mozilla.org would co-ordinate the development of Netscape Communicator 5 as \\"a dedicated team within Netscape with an associated Web site that will promote, foster and guide open dialog and development of Netscape's client source code.\\" However, the aging Communicator code proved to be difficult to work with, so it was abandoned. The whole source code of Communicator was re-written by Mozilla, who were then testing it as Mozilla Application Suite. Netscape, now owned by AOL, finally released Communicator's successor Netscape 6 in November 2000, based on Mozilla Application Suite with changes and additions. Minor updates to Communicator continued to be issued, culminating in the release of Netscape Communicator 4.8 in August 2002.

The following components were included in Netscape Communicator (different editions had different components and some components were dropped in later editions): =Features= *Netscape Navigator ‚Äî Web browser *Netscape Messenger ‚Äî e-mail client and (in version 4.5 and above) news client *Netscape Collabra ‚Äî news client (merged into Messenger in version 4.5) *Netscape Address Book ‚Äî address book *Netscape Composer ‚Äî HTML editor *Netscape Netcaster ‚Äî push technology client (dropped in version 4.5) *Netscape Conference ‚Äî multi-user communication client (dropped in version 4.5) *Netscape Calendar ‚Äî enterprise calendar client (dropped in version 4.72 because Netscape's license to use the underlying technology expired\\"What happened to Netscape Calendar?\\". SillyDog701.) =Updates= In October 1998, a major update to the program was released as Netscape 4.5. This included many improvements, mostly to the Messenger e-mail client, which now also took on the features of Collabra. However, some of the less popular components, such as Netcaster, were dropped. A feature called \\"Roaming Profiles\\" was added in version 4.5 that synchronized a user's bookmarks, address book and preferences with a remote server, so that a user's home and work browsers could have the same bookmarks.\\"Netscape Roaming Profiles - What is it?\\". Colorado State University (via Archive.org). By the time version 4.5 was released, Netscape had started the Mozilla open source project and had ceased charging for Communicator. The term \\"Navigator\\" referred to the browser component alone, while \\"Communicator\\" referred to the suite as a whole, as established in version 4.0. However, due to user confusion, the names were often used interchangeably. Also, because none of the applications besides Navigator were popular on their own, and because Netscape never produced any other desktop software that approached the popularity of Navigator, people would often refer to both the Communicator suite and the Navigator browser as simply \\"Netscape\\". The Mozilla Foundation continued to develop the Netscape code base, providing the Mozilla Application Suite as a continuation of Netscape Communicator. The Mozilla Foundation decided in 2006 to discontinue development of the Application Suite. A community-maintained version called SeaMonkey has come to replace the Application Suite.

The gravitational binding energy of a system is the minimum energy which must be added to it in order for the system to cease being in a gravitationally bound state. A gravitationally bound system has a lower (i.e., more negative) gravitational potential energy than the sum of the energies of its parts when these are completely separated‚Äîthis is what keeps the system aggregated in accordance with the minimum total potential energy principle. For a spherical body of uniform density, the gravitational binding energy U is given by the formulaChandrasekhar, S. 1939, An Introduction to the Study of Stellar Structure (Chicago: U. of Chicago; reprinted in New York: Dover), section 9, eqs. 90‚Äì92, p. 51 (Dover edition)Lang, K. R. 1980, Astrophysical Formulae (Berlin: Springer Verlag), p. 272 :U = \\\\frac{3GM^2}{5R} where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the sphere, and R is its radius. Assuming that the Earth is a sphere of uniform density (which it is not, but is close enough to get an order-of-magnitude estimate) with M = and r = m, then U = . This is roughly equal to one week of the Sun's total energy output. It is , 60% of the absolute value of the potential energy per kilogram at the surface. The actual depth-dependence of density, inferred from seismic travel times (see Adams‚ÄìWilliamson equation), is given in the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM). Using this, the real gravitational binding energy of Earth can be calculated numerically as U = . According to the virial theorem, the gravitational binding energy of a star is about two times its internal thermal energy in order for hydrostatic equilibrium to be maintained. As the gas in a star becomes more relativistic, the gravitational binding energy required for hydrostatic equilibrium approaches zero and the star becomes unstable (highly sensitive to perturbations), which may lead to a supernova in the case of a high-mass star due to strong radiation pressure or to a black hole in the case of a neutron star. Derivation for a uniform sphere The gravitational binding energy of a sphere with radius R is found by imagining that it is pulled apart by successively moving spherical shells to infinity, the outermost first, and finding the total energy needed for that. Assuming a constant density \\\\rho, the masses of a shell and the sphere inside it are: :m_\\\\mathrm{shell}=4\\\\pi r^{2}\\\\rho\\\\,dr and m_\\\\mathrm{interior}=\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi r^3 \\\\rho The required energy for a shell is the negative of the gravitational potential energy: :{\\\\it dU}=-G\\\\frac{m_\\\\mathrm{shell} m_\\\\mathrm{interior}}{r} Integrating over all shells yields: :U = -G\\\\int_0^R {\\\\frac{(4\\\\pi r^2\\\\rho)(\\\\tfrac{4}{3}\\\\pi r^{3}\\\\rho)}{r}} dr = -G{\\\\frac{16}{3}}\\\\pi^2 \\\\rho^2 \\\\int_0^R {r^4} dr = -G{\\\\frac{16}{15}}{\\\\pi}^2{\\\\rho}^2 R^5 Since \\\\rho is simply equal to the mass of the whole divided by its volume for objects with uniform density, therefore :\\\\rho=\\\\frac{M}{\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi R^3} And finally, plugging this into our result leads to :U=-G\\\\frac{16}{15} \\\\pi^2 R^5 \\\\left(\\\\frac{M}{\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi R^3}\\\\right)^2= -\\\\frac{3GM^2}{5R} Negative mass component Two bodies, placed at the distance R from each other and reciprocally not moving, exert a gravitational force on a third body slightly smaller when R is small. This can be seen as a negative mass component of the system, equal, for uniformly spherical solutions, to: :M_\\\\mathrm{binding}=-\\\\frac{3GM^2}{5Rc^2} For example, the fact that Earth is a gravitationally-bound sphere of its current size costs 2.49421 √ó 1015 kg of mass (roughly one fourth the mass of Phobos ‚Äì see above for the same value in Joules), and if its atoms were sparse over an arbitrarily large volume the Earth would weigh its current mass plus 2.49421 √ó 1015 kilograms (and its gravitational pull over a third body would be accordingly stronger). It can be easily demonstrated that this negative component can never exceed the positive component of a system. A negative binding energy greater than the mass of the system itself would indeed require that the radius of the system be smaller than: :R\\\\leq\\\\frac{3GM}{5c^2} which is smaller than \\\\frac{3}{10} its Schwarzschild radius: :R\\\\leq\\\\frac{3}{10} r_\\\\mathrm{s} and therefore never visible to an external observer. However this is only a Newtonian approximation and in relativistic conditions other factors must be taken into account as well. Non-uniform spheres Planets and stars have radial density gradients from their lower density surfaces to their much denser compressed cores. Degenerate matter objects (white dwarfs; neutron star pulsars) have radial density gradients plus relativistic corrections. Neutron star relativistic equations of state include a graph of radius vs. mass for various models.Neutron Star Masses and Radii, p. 9/20, bottom The most likely radii for a given neutron star mass are bracketed by models AP4 (smallest radius) and MS2 (largest radius). BE is the ratio of gravitational binding energy mass equivalent to observed neutron star gravitational mass of M with radius R, :BE = \\\\frac{0.60\\\\,\\\\beta}{1 - \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{2}} \\\\beta \\\\ = G\\\\,M/R\\\\,{c}^{2} .

Located in the fictional city of Ankh- Morpork, the UU is staffed by a faculty composed of mostly indolent and inept old wizards. The university's name is a pun on the Invisible College, and many aspects of the University are references to Oxford and Cambridge University. The exploits of the head wizards of the Unseen University are one of the main plot threads in the long-running fantasy series, and have played a central role in 13 novels to date, as well as the four supplementary Science of Discworld novels and the short story, A Collegiate Casting-Out of Devilish Devices.  Motto and Coat of Arms  The official motto of Unseen University is \\"Nunc Id Vides, Nunc Ne Vides\\", loosely translated as \\"Now you see it, now you don't\\". The unofficial motto is \\"Œ∑ Œ≤ œÄ\\", or \\"Eta Beta Pi\\" (\\"Eat a Bit of Pie\\" or \\"Eat a Better Pie\\" (according to the Hogfather novel)). The coat of arms is: Azure, in chief an open book proper bearing the motto \\"nunc id vides, nunc ne vides\\" and in base a wizard's hat gules with stars semy Or. For crest is an owl displayed proper. As usually rendered, the coat of arms resembles the coat of arms of the University of Oxford. Wizardry The title wizard is said to be derived from the archaic word \\"Wys-ars\\", meaning one who, at bottom, is very wise. In fact, the older wizards tend not to understand how magic actually works at all, instead relying on centuries of lore to achieve their effects. Younger wizards enthusiastically experiment, pushing back the boundaries of knowledge and making new discoveries about the nature of the universe. They don't understand how magic works either, but have much more exciting words to explain why not. These often invoke images of particle physics. The main issue is a generalized worry to where the power actually comes from and what sort of (often eldritch and downright monstrous) entities excessive use can attract. An eighth son of an eighth son is automatically a wizard. When a wizard nears death ‚Äì which they know some time in advance ‚Äì he formally passes on his staff to a newborn wizard. If a wizard happens to have an eighth son, this child will be a \\"wizard squared\\" or \\"Sourcerer\\", as he generates his own magic and can therefore do just about anything with no effort. This is very dangerous, both because absolute power corrupts absolutely, and because it increases background magic levels considerably. Because of this, wizards generally lack children, due to both rigid celibacy laws and overall non-enabling personality. Besides a mention of Krull (see below) and the prominent Eskarina Smith, all wizards are implicitly male, though this may be a cultural bias of the Unnamed Continent confirmed by narrativium. Wizards grade magical ability in a series of levels, the highest of which is eight. People without magical ability are \\"level zero\\". It was the opinion of many tutors at the time Rincewind was a student that he had a level that was possibly in minus figures, and that the overall magical potential of humanity would actually increase after his death. Besides the UU, Wizard magic is known to be taught at Bugarup University in Fourecks (Archchancellor, Bill Rincewind) and Krull University in the secretive nation of Krull, as well as the recently established Braseneck College in Pseudopolis. Grounds and buildings The University is a large walled-off complex on the turnwise side of the Ankh, somewhat hubwards of the Isle of Gods. Aside from the Tower of Art, the geography of the UU is somewhat fluid, with rooms shifting and disappearing on a regular basis. It is much larger on the inside than on the outside. Forming much of the border is the main building, which contains the garden known as the Main Octangle and the Clock Tower housing Old Tom, the University's tongueless octiron (a fictitious magical metal) bell whose strokes silence everything briefly. Turnwise of the main building lies the Library, housing the largest collection of magical texts known on the Disc. This is analogous to the deposit libraries of the UK which include three university libraries. Further hubwards of this is the High Energy Magic Building (a play on high energy physics; the more boffinish of the students and young wizards, such as Ponder Stibbons, work here, breaking magic down into smaller particles). The spot between this building and the Library is the workspace of the University gardener, Modo, a genteel dwarf who was nearly eaten by his own compost pile. The University holds rowing contests, but because of the normal state of the Ankh, these usually amount to a jogging/sprinting race on the crusted surface. Entering the gardens over the Ankh is the Bridge of Size (a pun on Bridge of Sighs, a name used in various cities including those of Oxbridge), which connects to the Wizard's Pleasaunce (possibly a reference to Parson's Pleasure), another small garden on the Ankh's turnwise side walled off from Hen & Chickens Field. At one point, in the novel Sourcery the Pleasaunce contained a temporary new headquarters for the University staff. Entrance and exit into the complex is by one of the gates. These gates close in the evening, and students who like to get out after this have created an alternate opening known as Scholar's Entry. This is a place in the wall where bricks can be slid out to form a usable ladder, and has always been known only to students. However, many students forget that all the staff were, in their time, students themselves. = Tower of Art = The Tower of Art is the tower that forms the University's core. It has a total of 8,888 steps up to the top (on the Disc the number 8 has great mystical significance). Originally the Tower was the only building on campus, but teaching has long since moved on to other buildings. The Tower itself is usually only used for astronomical and other observations requiring altitude and the traditional May Morning chorus song from its top (inaudible to anyone but the chorus, but traditionally applauded by all below). While historical wizards were known to build towers for themselves, the builders are unknown. It is certainly older than both the city and the University around it, and some have speculated that it is older than the Disc itself, although evidence for this is scarce. In the novel Sourcery it survives many magical attacks; other, newer towers do not. In the same novel it became important for the heroic wizard Rincewind, as towers help wizards fulfill their potential. Around the top of it a magical species of raven has developed that is much more intelligent than usual. Quoth, the raven from Soul Music and all the books featuring Susan Sto Helit, is one of these. The Tower of Art is also the motif of the Ankh-Morpork Post Office one-dollar stamp. =Library= Like the Bodleian Library at Oxford, the UU Library features chained books - although at Oxford this is done to protect the books from the students, whereas at UU it is done to protect the students from the books. The high concentration of magical lore has warped the Library interior into a locus of \\"L-Space\\" where the concepts of distance and direction are only vaguely defined. It is generally described as resembling an M. C. Escher pastiche of the Bodleian or the British Museum Reading Room. Within L-Space the Library contains every book ever written, possibly written, unwritten and yet to be written. Since the contents of all libraries are in L-Space, it is possible to enter a Library in one city and exit in another. Access to libraries of other times or other realities is restricted to the Librarian himself. People entering the deeper parts of the library usually carry chalk, until the chalk turns into something else. Octavo The Octavo, named after a book size and the in- Universe magical power of the number eight, features prominently in the Colour of Magic/Light Fantastic pair of novels. It is described as the Creator's own grimoire, left behind shortly after the Creator completed Creation, and thus the most powerful book of magic on the Discworld. The Eight Great Spells that initially made the Discworld are imprisoned on its pages, giving the book sentience. It is chained down, fastened by eight padlocks: one for each head of an Order of Magic. When obtained by the University, it was stored in a locked room, off and under the its Library. The walls are covered with protective symbols and lead octagrams (a reference to precautions taken to shield nuclear reactors; Pratchett once worked for a power generation company). The maximum time an individual can spend in the room is given as 4 minutes and 32 seconds, a figure \\"deduced after two centuries of cautious experimentation\\". As part of Rincewind's backstory, he opens the Octavo in his first year for a bet, whereupon one of the Eight Great Spells leapt from the book and lodged itself into his mind. The failure of the aforementioned security measures is later explained as the actions of the Great Spells themselves. Efforts to remove the spell fail and, unable to learn any other spells (supposedly afraid of sharing his head with a Great Spell) Rincewind is dismissed from the University. In the conclusion of The Light Fantastic, the Spell returns to the Octavo and Rincewind recites all eight Spells to prevent the Discworld's imminent destruction. The book is subsequently swallowed by Rincewind's Luggage, then spat out a few days later.  Staff  The staff usually come in a group in the books in which they appear, though Rincewind initially followed his own storyline, only being a part of the group in the Science of Discworld books and Unseen Academicals, and the Librarian makes solo appearances in several books. Ridcully and Ponder also appeared in Going Postal and Night Watch. Ridcully alone appears in Thud!. The wizards are referred to by their offices, rather than names. There is a slight reference to this in The Last Continent, when the wizards notice that they not only don't know the Librarian's name, but they also don't know the names of one another. Also, in Unseen Academicals, Ridcully has difficulty remembering the Dean's name, despite having started at UU around the same time. =Archchancellor= Mustrum Ridcully illustrated by Paul Kidby The head of Unseen University is the Archchancellor, considered an important figure and holds a seat on the Ankh-Morpork council (although this council itself has no power either), in which he acts as a magical advisor to the Patrician of Ankh- Morpork. The Archchancellor of UU is considered the leader of all wizards on the Disc (by those at the UU), the first among equals (i.e. the other eighth- level wizards). There are a total of eight eighth-level wizards, and the number becomes progressively higher as the level decreases. It is common to ascend through the ranks by assassinating superiors. This has been known as the tradition of \\"dead men's pointy shoes.\\" Unseen University has existed for thousands of years, and the average Archchancellor remains in office for about eleven months. The current Archchancellor is Mustrum Ridcully who assumed the post in Moving Pictures and held it for the rest of the novels. Unlike his predecessors, Ridcully seems to have had a very successful and, above all, injury-free career as Archchancellor. He finally put a halt to the traditional method of promotion simply by being indestructible. This is related to his habit of springing up behind would-be assassins, shouting loudly at them and banging their head repeatedly in the door. He is also known as Ridcully the Brown (a possible reference to \\"Radagast the Brown\\" from Lord of the Rings). At the time he became Archchancellor, he had not been seen at the University for forty years, having become a Seventh Level Wizard at the exceptionally young age of twenty-seven, before leaving the university to look after his family's land. As a result, he loves hunting, owns several crossbows and is much given to using the corridors of Unseen University as a shooting range. He also loves sport and was a Rowing Brown for the University in his youth (a parodic reference to the Blue at Oxford and Cambridge Universities). Since wizards' favourite sports traditionally are things like Competitive Eating and Extreme Napping, other wizards find him very tiring to be around. He is not stupid but finds it very difficult to deal with unexpected information, and generally ignores it until it goes away or becomes someone else's problem. He holds the view that if someone is still trying to explain something to him after about two minutes, it must be worth listening to, and if they give up earlier, it was not worth bothering him with in the first place. Ridcully has shown the occasional flash of magical skill. For example, in Moving Pictures, the Bursar is surprised to discover Ridcully's adeptness at using a magic mirror, which, like most Discworld scrying devices, is hard to steer. In Soul Music Ridcully improvises, at short notice and with minimal assistance, a slimmed-down version of the rite of AshkEnte for summoning Death (though what he got was Susan, Death's granddaughter ‚Äì not because the Rite was less effective, however; the plot of the novel was to do with Susan taking over Death's job). It is also implied that he has some degree of practical magic knowledge ‚Äì instead of using a 'thaumometer' (a device that gives a numerical measurement of a magic field's strength), he licks a finger and notes the colour and size of the small spark it gives off in the air (The Last Continent). He also tends to be more practical than most of his fellow wizards such as when he revives Mr. Teatime by hitting him on the chest before any of his fellow wizards could whip up a spell. The faculty member he gets on best with seems to be Ponder Stibbons. He never seems to understand what Ponder is saying, and Ponder never expects him to, but at least the young man is doing something, which is more than can be said for the rest of them. He is also quite fond of the Librarian, dismissing a rather snide question about whether it's appropriate for UU's librarian to be an ape with the response, \\"... he's the only one of you buggers who's awake more'n an hour a day\\". He also gets along with Watch Commander Samuel Vimes, despite the latter's legendary dislike of magic, as both of them share the belief that the most important thing about magic is knowing when not to use it. His father was a butcher (Unseen Academicals), and his brother is Hughnon Ridcully, High Priest of Blind Io, and Ankh-Morpork's religious spokesman. While priests and wizards are traditionally at odds due to philosophical differences, neither Ridcully is of a particularly philosophical frame of mind, and they tend to ignore this. In Lords and Ladies we learn he had a relationship with a young Esme Weatherwax, some fifty years before becoming Archchancellor. It is suggested in the book that, in one of the many parallel universes adjacent to the one on which the Discworld novels take place, Ridcully and Esme Weatherwax are married and have children; though it also implies that they were all probably killed by the Queen of the Elves. He is deeply affected by her death (The Shepherd's Crown). In the Cosgrove Hall animation of Soul Music he was voiced by Graham Crowden. In 2007's miniseries adaptation of Hogfather he was played by Joss Ackland, and in the 2010 adaptation of Going Postal he was portrayed by Timothy West. =Bursar= (Professor A.A. Dinwiddie, DM (7th), D.Thau., B.Occ., M.Coll. starting in ~~Faust~~ Eric) The Bursar is a quiet, reserved person, who took the job of University treasurer because he had an affinity for numbers (the Archchancellor describes him as \\"one of those idiot servants\\") and there was less competition for the role than other faculty posts. He took over the job from the previous Bursar, Spelter, after the latter was killed trying to save the Library from destruction in Sourcery. Dinwiddie expected that the Bursarship would be a relatively safe office to hold (considering that the normal means of obtaining an office in UU at the time was to assassinate the previous incumbent, but nobody else actually wanted to be bursar) and dreamed of spending the rest of his life quietly adding up rows of figures. Unfortunately, shortly after he became the Bursar, Mustrum Ridcully was appointed Archchancellor. The brashness of Ridcully's personality wore away at the Bursar, a man whose idea of excitement was a soft-boiled egg, and throughout the books his sanity decreased until, by the middle of the series Dr. Dinwiddie is almost completely insane. He is kept functional, just, by experimental dosages of dried frog pills, though the effect is sometimes erratic. The pills are actually hallucinogens, the idea being that a proper dosage will cause him to hallucinate he is sane. An improper dose causes him to demonstrate symptoms of catatonia or disorganized schizophrenia. Sadly, one of the other things he hallucinates is that he can fly. He being a wizard, this is relatively easy to deal with; the other faculty members simply have to keep him from flying higher than the walls. Hex temporarily inherited the Bursar's condition after having a \\"conversation\\" with him, until Archchancellor Ridcully remedied the matter by convincing the ant-run thinking engine it had just been administered \\"LOTS OF DRYD FRORG P¬ºLLS\\". The Bursar's insanity has become a byword in Ankh-Morpork; \\"to go Bursar\\" is \\"to go crazy\\". =Dean= The Dean of Pentacles/Archchancellor Henry of Brazeneck College. An incredibly obese man (\\"...looks like a man who's swallered a bed!\\" in Moving Pictures) who is generally found in his study reading a grimoire or in the great hall eating. His only job is to sit around, sleep and eat incredibly big dinners. He also attends some of the functions that are held by guilds or clubs around the city on behalf of the University and partakes of other people's big dinners. According to Ponder Stibbons, he is \\"normally never nice\\". One of the Dean's more interesting characteristics is his susceptibility to whatever occult or semi-magical occurrence is happening, as well as any fads or trends - most notably in Soul Music. He is also, when roused into action, very enthusiastic and violent, and is a part-time Watch Special Constable, on the agreement that he will not use magic in the course of his duties. In The Last Continent, he was nicknamed \\"Two Chairs\\" by Ridcully, on the basis that he was the only person able to sit on two chairs at once. In Hogfather, Ridcully is impressed by Hex, the UU \\"computer\\", and asks if there is any chance they could fit a similar one in the Dean's head. Ponder Stibbons then informs him that the resulting brain would weigh ten tons, upon which Ridcully merely remarks \\"Really? Quite a large crowbar would be in order, then.\\" In Unseen Academicals it is revealed that The Dean has left UU to become the new Archchancellor of the new Brazeneck University and that his first name is Henry. The Dean became the first person to voluntarily resign from the University ‚Äì something previously considered unthinkable (as people usually left 'in disgrace, in a box or, in a few cases, in bits') to the point Ridcully regards him as a traitor. Despite the fact they had been friends since their first day at Unseen University, Ridcully cannot decide what to call the Dean and eventually remembers his name is Henry (over 'Archchancellor', because that 'was out of the question', 'Dean' was 'too obvious an insult', 'Two Chairs' was 'ditto with knobs on' and 'ungrateful, backstabbing, slimy bastard' took too long to say.) By the end of the novel Ridcully is comfortable enough with his presence to refer to him as 'Dean' ‚Äì which Henry lets slide. =Librarian= The Librarian The Librarian appeared in the second novel of the series, The Light Fantastic, where he was transformed into an orang-utan as the Octavo fired a beam of magic upwards. On discovering that being an orang-utan had certain advantages for a librarian ‚Äì he can climb up to high shelves, for example ‚Äì he refused to be transformed back into a human and has remained an orang-utan ever since. The other wizards have gradually become used to the situation, to the extent that, from Night Watch: \\"if someone ever reported that there was an orang-utan in the Library, the wizards would probably go and ask the Librarian if he'd seen it.\\" He is known for his violent reaction to most people calling him a \\"monkey\\", as he is technically an ape. He speaks a language whose vocabulary consists primarily of the single word Ook (originally Oook), inflected for simple affirmations and negations. Eeek is also occasionally heard, particularly in moments of panic or rage. Nonetheless, most people seem able to understand him. As with other members of the UU faculty, the Librarian is referred to uniquely by his office and not by a name. If the Librarian's name were known, he could be changed back into a human, and he has since The Last Continent carefully excised his name from the records of the University. The Discworld Companion hints that he may once have been Dr. Horace Worblehat, which goes most of the way to explaining why he is happier as an orang-utan. The Art of Discworld confirms that the Librarian was indeed Dr. Horace Worblehat, and that his fears of turning back into human are baseless at most. Rincewind is apparently the only wizard who still remembers the Librarian's name, but he has agreed not to tell anyone, possibly because the Librarian is capable of bouncing the head of a man on the pavement when holding him by the ankle. The Librarian served a brief stint in the City Watch during the reign of terror caused by the dragon of Ankh-Morpork, where he helped to rescue Sam Vimes from the Patrician's cell. He retained an honorary position with the Watch, and is considered as of Thud! to be one of the first members of the 'Specials' ‚Äì the Ankh-Morpork City Militia. In Soul Music, he joined the Band with Rocks In since his large hands and wide reach make him an excellent keyboard player. He remains the chief organist for the Unseen University, and does not consider an organ complete without a vox diabolica stop, a thunder pedal, and a 256-ft Earthquake pipe. Fortunately, the Johnson organ in the Great Hall of Unseen University is one of the few organs thus equipped. The Librarian is a member of a small elite group of senior Librarians of Time and Space who have the knowledge and ability to travel through L-Space, an extradimensional space that connects all libraries and other large accumulations of books. He used this knowledge to save books from the great library of Ephebe in Small Gods and to enter our world via the library of Sir Francis Walsingham in The Science of Discworld II. The very strict rules that members of this group are pledged to enforce are: # Silence. # Books must be returned no later than the last date shown. # Do not meddle with the nature of causality. The Librarian has been known to break both the first and third rules on occasion, but he is adamant about the second. In Men at Arms, it is stated that the Librarian likes being the best man at weddings because he is allowed to kiss the bridesmaids and they are not allowed to run away; in Lords and Ladies the Librarian served as the best man for Magrat and Verence. The cover of the Discworld picture book Where's My Cow? indicates that it has won the Ankh- Morpork Librarian's award. The Librarian tends to spend his leisure hours at the Mended Drum, where he drinks quietly unless provoked, eats prodigious quantities of peanuts, and plays a ruthless game of Cripple Mr Onion with anyone foolish enough to take him on. The Librarian appears in orang-utan form in the video games Discworld and Discworld II. In the 2008 TV adaptation of The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic by Sky One, he appears in both human and orang-utan form. His human form is played by Nicolas Tennant, who had previously played Corporal Nobbs in Terry Pratchett's Hogfather. This adaptation also establishes his name as Horace Worblehat. =Ponder Stibbons= Head of Inadvisably Applied Magic, Praelector and Reader in Invisible Writings, the Master of Traditions, the Camerlengo of Unseen University, and among other positions, the keeper of Hex, the University's computer, Ponder Stibbons fulfills the role of the one person in the organisation who knows what's going on. Originally portrayed as an obsessive geeky student, who passed the University's graduation exam because he was allowed to take the test paper of the absent slacker genius, Victor Tugelbend, (which consisted solely of the question \\"What is your name?\\"), after a mishap with his own; he would become the head of the students whose experiments with High Energy Magic would lead to the creation of Hex, and eventually a member of the Faculty where the more senior members generally treat him as the odd- jobs man. Of course at this point he's effectively the only person who can get anything done (often without the consent of the other Faculty members) and the right-hand man of Archchancellor Ridcully. In The Science of Discworld, Stibbons led the project to \\"split the thaum\\" (the magical equivalent of the atom). It is revealed in Unseen Academicals that, due to the number of positions he holds (because somebody has to), Stibbons has accumulated sufficient votes to technically control the University Council ‚Äì causing the Archchancellor to remark \\"Didn't anyone notice you were getting all this power?\\". His entry in The New Discworld Companion states: 'originally rather lazy by nature, he seems to have blossomed to become the youngest and most depressingly keen member of the faculty... as one of the few wizards at the University with his head screwed on in any fashion, he appears, quite against his will, to be in the front line'. He doesn't support the theory of a beard as a sign of knowledge because he has been unable to grow one-himself. In the film version of Hogfather he is portrayed by Ed Coleman. Stibbons appears in the video game Discworld II, in the High Energy Facility. He is characterized differently than in the books, as apparently the long hours of working with Hex's thaumic accelerator caused his brain to \\"melt\\". This is evidenced by his erratic speech patterns and verbal tics, as well as his denials that he is being adversely affected: he reacts to Rincewind's remarks with \\"There's no truth at all that splitting thaums causes the brain to *woof* melt! No truth at all! Haaaah! Every day, and in every way, I'm getting BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER! They laughed at me and said I was mad, you know. HAVE A NICE DAY! HAVE A NICE DAY! HAVE A REAL, REAL, REAL NICE NIGHT-NO-DAY! HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!\\". =Rincewind= Rincewind holds the Chair of Experimental Serendipity, the Chair for the Public Misunderstanding of Magic, and the positions of Professor of Virtual Anthropology, Egregious Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geography, Reader in Slood Dynamics, Fretwork Teacher, Lecturer in Approximate Accuracy, and Health and Safety Officer. These apparently unwanted positions were awarded to Rincewind provided that he not receive any salary. Prior to receiving these titles, Rincewind held the post of Assistant Librarian, but it is unclear whether or not he retains the office. Rincewind is often concerned with his life, as many people all across Discworld have attempted to take it. In the film version of The Colour of Magic he is portrayed by David Jason. =Doctor Hix= Dr John Hix ‚Äì 'Hicks with an X' in Unseen Academicals, after changing his name from Hicks because it didn't suit his position. Dr Hix is a necromancer. Since necromancy is officially banned in Ankh-Morpork, he is instead the Head of the Department of Post Mortem Communications (although he acknowledges this is just a fancy way of saying necromancy). Dr Hix has one member of staff, a reanimated skeleton called Charlie, who helps procure the tools of the trade (which are mostly items from the joke shop down the road). Dr Hix did have another member of staff, the late Professor Flead, but insorcized him into the Pink Pussycat Club at the end of Making Money (the Professor haunts the club, and the club does not mind the loss of one chair out of the club's seating capacity). Dr Hix frequently misbehaves, performs evil deeds and makes comments in bad taste as he is required to under University statute, a fact which the other members of UU grudgingly accept. He uses the phrase \\"Skull ring, remember?\\" as an excuse for his misbehaviour, much like the Patrician's use of the phrase, \\"Tyrant, remember?\\". Hix may be a parody of Peter Higgs. =Hex= Hex is the UU's first mainframe computer, though instead of RAM, it is powered by a waterwheel inside a ram skull, and its mouse is an actual mouse. Its \\"brain\\" consists of a series of glass tubes filled with ants, which form its processor, and a beehive in a back room, which constitutes its hard drive. It bears a sticker up front saying that there is an anthill inside (a parody of the advertising slogan \\"Intel Inside\\"). Initially just a computer, it has gradually developed more of a personality over the course of the series. Ponder Stibbons has by default become the person in charge of developing and operating Hex, though he admits that Hex largely develops itself. = Other staff = Other staff at the UU include: * the Senior Wrangler (described in Reaper Man as \\"a philosopher who looks like a horse\\") * the Chair of Indefinite Studies * the Lecturer in Recent Runes * the Chair of Oblique Frogs * the Professor of Revolvings * the Professor of Extreme Horticulture * the Professor of Applied Anthropics * the Reader in Esoteric Studies * the Lecturer in Creative Uncertainty *Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geography (died in The Last Continent, position now held by Rincewind) * the Professor of Dust, Fluff, and Miscellaneous Particles * the Lecturer in Vindictive Astronomy * the Professor of Recondite Architecture and Origami Map-Folding * Ladislav Pelc, Prehumous Professor of Morbid Bibliomancy * Professor Goitre, Posthumous Professor of Morbid Bibliomancy * Devious H. \\"Dragonbreath\\" Collabone * Professor Flead * Professor Ritornello, Master of the Music * Professor Bengo Macarona, visiting professor from Genua and extraordinary football player * Mrs Whitlow, the domineering head of the kitchen * Modo, the gardener = Past archchancellors = Notable former archchancellors include: * Alberto Malich: The first Archchancellor and university founder; sent himself to the land of Death when he performed the Rite of AshkEnte backwards. Staying in Death's Domain, he became Death's Assistant and Butler. Returned (briefly) in Mort and Soul Music, and for rather longer during the events described in Hogfather when he appeared as Pixie Albert to Death's Hogfather. In the film version of Hogfather he is portrayed by David Jason. * Chancellor Galder Weatherwax: A distant cousin of Granny Weatherwax (they have never met), he is Chancellor for the first half of The Light Fantastic. Note that in The Light Fantastic, he is referred to as Chancellor, but Ridcully subsequently upgrades him to Archchancellor in Lords and Ladies, when talking to aforementioned Granny Weatherwax. He is the 304th Chancellor of the University. In the film version of The Colour of Magic he is portrayed by James Cosmo. * Archchancellor Ymper Trymon: Archchancellor for the second half of The Light Fantastic. Nearly causes the end of the world. In the film version of The Colour of Magic he is portrayed by Tim Curry. * Coin the Sourcerer: Archchancellor during Sourcery. Also nearly causes the end of the world. Others include Cutangle in Equal Rites, Virrid Wayzygoose for one night in Sourcery, Ezrolith Churn during ~~Faust~~ Eric, Sloman, who discovered the Special Theory of Slood, and Preserved Bigger, whose conditional bequest necessitated a game of football in Unseen Academicals. = Past students = * Eskarina Smith, commonly known as Esk, is the main character in Equal Rites, where she became the Unseen University's first and only known female graduate. Esk went on to work on a new kind of magic based on not using it at all, in the company of wunderkind wizard Simon. Although she was the pivotal character in Equal Rites, she was not seen or mentioned again until I Shall Wear Midnight, published a full 23 years later, where she was described as being both old and young due to her mastery of time travel. Though it is unclear whether or not she's a practising part of the Ankh Morpork coven, perhaps due to her shared witchiness/wizardliness, Tiffany Aching is forewarned by Mrs. Proust that she would be contacted by her. In the future, she becomes a close friend of the adult Tiffany Aching. Esk is mentioned briefly again in The Shepherd's Crown, with an (unnamed) son. * Victor Tugelbend (in Moving Pictures) * Adrian Turnipseed, aka Big Mad Drongo, aka Big Mad Adrian (to Archchancellor Ridcully only) (in Soul Music, The Last Continent, Hogfather and others). A geeky wizard who works with Ponder Stibbons at the High Energy Magic Building. By the time of Unseen Academicals Adrian Turnipseed was working for Braseneck College and fulfilling an equivalent role there to UU's Ponder Stibbons. * Mr. Sideney: A member of Teatime's gang who break into the Tooth Fairy's castle. In the film adaptation of Hogfather, he is portrayed by Nigel Planer. =Past wizards= Drum Billet The wizard who starts the events of Equal Rites by bequeathing his staff just before his death to, as he thinks, the eighth son of an eighth son, the child of the smith of the village of Bad Ass in Lancre. The midwife, Granny Weatherwax, tries to point out that they are making a mistake but Billet and the new father ignore her. As a result, the staff and its power are transferred to a girl, Eskarina Smith (\\"Esk\\"). Later in the book he has been reincarnated as an ant living under Unseen University. The name is a pleonasm, as \\"Drum\\" is slang for \\"House\\" in some English dialects, and \\"Billet\\" is a (more typically) military term for housing. Hence his name should be House House. Windle Poons Windle Poons was a very old wizard, usually moving on his monstrous wheelchair. He first appeared in Moving Pictures in which his physical and mental state could be described as \\"invalid, deaf, wandering of mind and hot on the ladies' behinds in his wheelchair\\". Strangely, it resulted in friendly relations with Ridcully, since Windle didn't mind being shouted at, and he was also used to people ignoring his questions. He died at the age of 130 shortly after his farewell party, but thanks to Death's absence he returned briefly as a zombie.

At the 2010 census the population was 1,862, up from 1,431 in 2000. Crossville is located atop Sand Mountain, a southern extension of the Cumberland Plateau. History Crossville is a farming community in northeast Alabama, situated on the sandstone plateau of Sand Mountain. The native peoples called the plateau Raccoon Mountain.This is noted several places, including on page 478 of the History of Alabama and Dictionary of Alabama Biography, Vol. 1, by Thomas McAdory Owen and Marie Bankhead Owen. It holds some historical significance for having figured tangentially in the Creek War.. The area's soil, game, climate, and proximity to streams proved attractive to settlers, the majority of whom were drawn there from neighboring states following the expulsion of the indigenous Creeks.. Sand Mountain lay in an area that included disputed borders between the Creeks and the Cherokee. Although Alabama became a state in 1819, until the 1830s much of northern Alabama was still officially Cherokee territory. However, white settlement in the area increased steadily, coming to a head with the gold rush in the nearby mountains of northwest Georgia. While gold supplies began to dwindle, soon eclipsed by the California Gold Rush, the settlement by white farmers continued and played prominently in the expulsion of Cherokee, Creek and Choctaw nations from the area. That expulsion is called the Trail of Tears, considered an act of genocide because of the thousands who died on the journey, and the forced removal of native peoples from their home territories. (In nearby Fort Payne, which lies across the valley and at the foot of next- door Lookout Mountain, there is a historical sign marking the town as one of the starting points for the Trail of Tears, and also the area where Sequoyah lived, who developed the Cherokee alphabet.) During the times of slavery, Crossville, Sand Mountain and DeKalb County, where Crossville is located, were not major slave areas. This can be verified by a study of census rolls which reveal a mostly poor area, where people worked and survived by the labor of their own hands, rather than the forced labor of captive Africans and their descendants. Leading up to the Civil War, DeKalb County was typical of Southern mountain counties in that it voted against secession from the United States. This can be corroborated by a study of the roster of the votes on this issue, county by county. In fact, there was serious discussion among Northern Alabama and East Tennessee counties about forming a proposed state of Nickajack, rather than going along with secession.Fleming, Walter L., Civil War and Reconstruction in Alabama. New York: Columbia University Press, 1905, pp 109‚Äì111 During the Civil War, DeKalb County families, particularly families from mountain terrains such as Sand and Lookout Mountain, tended at first to avoid fighting, since it was considered a \\"rich man's war\\", and not of particular interest to mountain people. However, as the war progressed, many DeKalb County families fought for Union cavalries, notably the 1st Tennessee & Alabama Independent Vidette Cavalry and the 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment. A perusal of the cavalries' rostersRosters of the First Alabama Regiment will reveal family names that to this day are prominent in the area.See also Potter, Johnny, First Tennessee & Alabama Independent Vidette Cavalry Roster, 1863‚Äì1864, Mountain Press, 1995. The First Alabama Cavalry was particularly notable in that it was one of the few units that was racially integrated. Crossville's name, given to it by James A. Copeland (1880‚Äì1964), not to be confused with the outlaw James Copeland), was meant to reflect its many crossroads. In the mid-19th century, mail was brought through Crossville from Rome, Georgia, and Guntersville, Alabama, via stagecoach. Soon the town had its first U.S. post office, with A.C. Copeland serving as the first postmaster. In 1888, George Wyatt Justice established the first business in Crossville, and in 1903, W.B. Jones installed machinery for his cotton mills. His son Loy Jones (spouse-Sara Jones) followed his footsteps and ran a once successful business in Crossville. Loy and Sara had a daughter named Pam, and she had two sons named Blake and Blane Raley. The Jones family was vital to the growth early on in Crossville. The first church established in the Crossville area was a Methodist Episcopal Church called Pine Bark Church, formed just prior to the Civil War. The community's first Baptist church was established in 1892 at Union Grove east of the town center. In 1925, several people started meeting at the high school and formed the First Baptist Church of Crossville.First Baptist Church of Crossville A new sanctuary was built in 1926. Crossville established its first school, a one-room structure with a single teacher and approximately 50 students, in the late 19th century at Bryant's Chapel Church. The first banking institution was established in 1914 by N.W. Black and Boyce Rains. Soon after, Crossville was granted provisional incorporation, and Charlie J. Crump was appointed first mayor. Little progress was made during his tenure, and the incorporation's dissolution followed quickly thereafter.http://www.landmarksdekalbal.org/communities/Crossville.html The town was incorporated a second time on December 21, 1942. Dr. Luther F. Erwin was chosen mayor, and the town government established ordinances and levied privilege licenses. Collection enforcement was lax, however, resulting in insufficient resources to maintain basic town services. Following this, C.W. (Bill) Russell was elected mayor. He hired Colonel Mack Kilcrease as a legal adviser to mayor and council. This group worked together to establish a solid town government with taxation, collection and basic town services that would become the foundation for the Town of Crossville.

It is home to a major hydroelectric power plant at Thurlow Dam operated by Alabama Power Company. Tallassee is part of the Montgomery Metropolitan Statistical Area.  History  = The Creek Wars and Indian removal = The historic Creek peoples in this area are believed to have descended from the Mississippian culture, which flourished throughout the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys and the Southeast from about 1000 to 1450. They were mound builders, who created massive earthwork mounds as structures for political and religious purposes. They relied greatly on fishing and riverway trading at their major sites (c.f. Moundville, Tuscaloosa). Talisi (which means \\"Old Town\\" in the Creek language) was a town of the Coosa Province of the Mississippian culture; it was visited in 1540 by Hernando de Soto and his expedition through the Southeast. Later it was occupied by the historic Creek people. The Tallassee area was the location of the Creek capital city, Tuckabatchee, as well as the location of the seven sacred plates. Tensions first broke out as a civil war among the Creek, but US forces also got involved. Trying to intercept a Red Sticks party who were bringing back arms thought to be purchased from the Spanish in Florida, United States Army forces attacked the Creek at the Battle of Burnt Corn. The Creek band ultimately defeated the soldiers. In retaliation, the next month the Red Sticks attacked Fort Mims, about 35 miles north of Mobile, Alabama, killing most of the more than 500 settlers and mixed-race Lower Creek who had taken refuge there. Osceola is believed to have been born in Talisi, to a mixed-race Creek mother and an English father. He was among those Creek who migrated to Florida after the Creek War and joined the Seminole Indians. He became a prominent leader who continued resistance to US forces and settlement. The Creek Wars (1813‚Äì1814) were marked by mutual raids, civilian massacres, and scalpings by both sides. The last major battle was at Horseshoe Bend in 1814 on the banks of the Tallapoosa River. Led by then-General Andrew Jackson, a coalition of militia from Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia, federal troops, Lower Creek, and Cherokee crushed the outnumbered and out-gunned Red Sticks. Jackson counted the conflict as among his politically strategic victories; it increased his popularity for later election to the presidency and his future policies of Indian removal. After their defeat, many Creek migrated to Indian Territory, while some went into hiding with other resistant Indians in the Southeast, including the Cherokee and the Seminole tribes in Florida. The Creek who relocated from the Tuckabatchee area named a new settlement Talisia in Indian Territory. It was later known as Tulsa, Oklahoma. =American Civil War= \\"Tallassee sent her fair share, and more, of her sons to fight for the Confederacy and a Tallassee textile manufacturer, Barnett, Micou, and Company, supplied cloth for Confederate uniforms and tents, leased land and a building for production of a Confederate carbine, and produced supplies, laborers, and rations for the Armory, its employees, and officers.\\"Solomon, Olivia Pienezza.

In June 1864 the Confederate army moved the Richmond Carbine Factory from Virginia to an old Tallassee cotton mill. It began manufacturing the carbines. During the course of the American Civil War, the town of Tallassee was never attacked by Union forces, except for their one attempt to destroy the Tallassee Mill. The Tallassee Armory was the only Confederate one not destroyed during the war. =2009 Fire= Hotel Talisi following the 2009 fire Early in the morning of November 30, 2009, the historic Hotel Talisi was heavily damaged by a fire. The hotel, closed since 2008, was purchased by a group of seven investors in the fall of 2009. It was renovated and had been reopened for a month. The fire destroyed the hotel and a consignment shop next door. The fire was ruled an arson and a 17-year-old, Dylan Keith Carroll, pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree arson, one count of third-degree arson, two counts of third-degree burglary, and three counts of first-degree criminal mischief. After the trial, the hotel's owners met in March 2010 and decided to rebuild the structure. =Mills= thumb \\"In 1900, the Tallassee Falls Manufacturing Company became a part of the Mount Vernon-Woodberry Cotton Duck Company.

Robert E (Bobby) Payne served as Tallassee's mayor for 24 years, making him the longest-tenured mayor in the city's history. Payne was raised in Etowah County, where he excelled as a high school football player for the Etowah County Blue Devils. He earned a football scholarship from Auburn University in 1963. After completing his eligibility he moved with his wife Mary Carroll to Tallassee, where he worked at Mount Vernon Mills. In 1976 he ran for city council. He won the council seat and served three terms before he ran for mayor in 1988. Payne won in a highly contested race against incumbent Thomas Pollard. He remained in office for 24 years before losing in 2008. He entered the race in 2012 to reclaim his seat and he won convincingly. He retired in 2016. During his time in office, Tallassee achieved more economic growth than at any other time in the city's history. Johnny Hammock won Payne's seat in a landslide. Geography Tallassee is located at (32.539402, ‚àí85.893061). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and 0.5 square miles (1.4 km2, 5.21%) is water. Tallassee is located in the densely forested Emerald Mountains, a small southeastern chain of the Lower Appalachians.

The Tallapoosa River also serves as the dividing line between two counties and towns: the City of Tallassee (Elmore County) and East Tallassee (Tallapoosa County). The Alabama Power Company began to develop the Tallapoosa River in 1923 and in the following ten years three power plants built by the Alabama Power Company were built along the Tallapoosa River. Composed of the Thurlow Dam, the Yates Dam, and Martin Dam, these power plants have a combined capacity of 269,000 horsepower. Tallassee is served by State Highway 14, which runs northwest-northeast through the town, and State Highway 229, which runs northwest-south. AL-14 leads east 15 mi (24 km) to Notasulga and west 22 mi (35 km) to Wetumpka. AL-229 leads north 15 mi (24 km) to Alabama State Route 63 northeast of Wetumpka, and south 8 mi (13 km) to Interstate 85 at exit 26.http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-3311 Tallassee Municipal Airport serves general aviation.

At the 2010 census the population was 6,528.http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/01/0181720.html In the early 21st century Elmore County became one of the fastest-growing counties in the state. The city is considered part of the Montgomery Metropolitan Area. Wetumpka identifies as \\"The City of Natural Beauty\\". Among the notable landmarks are the Wetumpka crater and the Jasmine Hill Gardens, with a full- sized replica of the Temple of Hera of Olympia, Greece. Historic downtown Wetumpka developed on both sides of the Coosa River. It was near Fort Toulouse, built by French colonists in 1717, when they had claimed this territory for the king. Etymology The placename Wetumpka is derived from the Creek phrase we-wau tum-cau meaning \\"rumbling waters\\", believed to be a description of the sound of the nearby Coosa River at the rapids of the Devil's Staircase. The roar of the rapids reportedly could be heard for miles before the construction in the 20th century of Walter Bouldin Dam and Jordan Dam, when the river was captured as a reservoir behind the dam. After being forced west to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma), by United States soldiers under the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the Muscogee named their major settlement there Wetumka, after their historic village. History Wetumpka was long settled by the Muscogee people, whose territory extended through present-day Georgia and Alabama. Their largest towns were on the banks of the Coosa and at its confluence with the Tallapoosa River, at Wetumpka and Talisi (now Tallassee), respectively. =French and British colonization= Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville After moving the 1702 settlement of Mobile to Mobile Bay in 1711, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville sent an expedition up the Alabama River to establish a fort in the interior of the colony, known as La Louisiane or New France, to stop the encroachment of British colonists and to foster trade and goodwill with the Creek. Mississippi Territory from 1798 (expanded 1804/1812), with Alabama Territory created March 3, 1817 Bienville directed the construction of Fort Toulouse along the Coosa River in 1714, above the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers and the Creek village of Taskigi. Bienville selected this area as a strategic locale for a fortification. The French traded at Wetumpka and garrisoned Fort Toulouse until 1763, when they ceded the territory to the British following defeat in the Seven Years' War (known as the French and Indian War in North America). For nearly a quarter century, the British had control of this area. Several Scots and Irish traders, such as McGillivray and Weatherford, were active in the region. They married into the Creek matrilineal aristocracy and later claimed vast land grants. Their descendants became important Creek leaders because of their mothers' status. =United States rule= After Britain was defeated in the American Revolutionary War, it ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River to the United States in 1783. In 1798 the US made this area part of the Mississippi Territory, after cessions from the states of Georgia and South Carolina. Between 1800 and 1812, European-American pioneers began to arrive, many with enslaved African-American laborers, and encroach on the lands of the Southeast Indian tribes. By the early 19th century, there were tensions among the Creek, with young men of the Upper Creek promoting a revival of religion and traditional culture, and the Lower Creek, more influenced by settlement and trade with European Americans in Georgia, becoming more assimilated. In addition, in 1811, the Shawnee chief Tecumseh of the upper Northwest appealed to the Creek to join his Western Confederacy to try to drive out and exterminate the European settlers west of the Appalachians. When the U.S. declared war on Britain in June 1812, the Upper Creek lost the assistance of the British, but they persisted with war against American settlers in the area. Upon receiving the news of the massacre at Fort Mims, whose refugees included many Lower Creek, American settlers appealed for government help. General Andrew Jackson led a militia with members from Tennessee, Mississippi, and Georgia and attacked the Creek in Alabama. The path the militia traveled became known as \\"Jackson's Trace\\". 1814: Chief Red Eagle (William Weatherford) surrenders to General Andrew Jackson at Fort Jackson in Wetumpka. Jackson's forces won a decisive victory at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. He moved on to Fort Toulouse, where he directed its repair. During his absence, the site was renamed Fort Jackson in his honor. Jackson made the fort his headquarters during the War of 1812. The newly created Montgomery County held its courts there. The defeated Creek were forced to sign the Treaty of Fort Jackson (1814), which ceded to the United States of Creek lands: much of the remainder of their territory in Georgia and most of central Alabama. After the war, many of Jackson's Tennessee militia returned home, collected their families and belongings, and brought them back to settle near the fort. =Growth and incorporation= Settlers, mostly from Georgia and the Carolinas, flooded into the fertile land that the Creeks had been forced to give up. With its strategic location at the river confluence, Wetumpka quickly became an important center of agricultural trade. The city was formally incorporated in 1834. Cotton was the commodity crop of the new state of Alabama, with cultivation of short-staple cotton in the upland areas made possible by Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin, which reduced the labor of processing. From the scattered fields and large plantations worked by slave labor in the interior, cotton was carted overland to Wetumpka. At the fall line of the Coosa River, the port shipped out cotton bales by steamboats which went downriver to the markets at Mobile for sale. The west bank looking across the Coosa River toward two Wetumpka landmarks, the Bibb Graves Bridge (1936) and First Presbyterian Church (1856). Wetumpka became a cotton boom town. The new city was divided in half. The part on the eastern bank of the river was commercial, with banks, stores, and hotels, and was located in Coosa County. The western section in Autauga County was residential, with houses and churches laid out on a grid pattern of streets. By 1836, the city's population was 1,200. Harper's Weekly asserted that \\"Wetumpka, Alabama and Chicago, Illinois are the most promising two cities of the West. The city commissioned a steamboat, The Coosa Belle, to ferry passengers and cotton between Wetumpka and Mobile. The same forces contributing to Wetumpka's growth were shifting the balance of power within Alabama. A standoff between the farmers of the Tennessee Valley, centered in the former capital of Huntsville, and the old mercantile wealth of Mobile, had resulted in the capital being located for many years at Tuscaloosa. By 1845, the cotton planters in the interior Black Belt had become some of the wealthiest in the country, and power was shifting toward the southern and central part of the state. Both the Black Belt cotton barons and the Mobilians wanted the capital moved. Compromise indicated a new, centrally located capital, accessible by river and by steamboat. The lead contenders were Wetumpka (then straddling old Autauga and Coosa Counties) and the newer city of Montgomery (in Montgomery County), a few miles south. Neither city had a majority of support; representatives from north Alabama, enraged that the capital was being moved from Tuscaloosa, were indifferent to either site. Just before the vote, Montgomery lured an expensive French chef to the new hotel that had been built to house the state's representatives if Montgomery were selected. The city distributed elegant menus to the statesmen. The promise of luxury swayed the vote, and Montgomery won. That same year, a fire broke out in Wetumpka, burning warehouses and many commercial buildings. The charred bricks were carried downriver to Montgomery to supply the building boom in Alabama's new capital. =War and flood= Though their civic pride was wounded by losing the capital to Montgomery, Wetumpka's planters and merchants continued to flourish throughout the antebellum period. They promoted a plan to build a lock and dam so that boats would be able to pass above the Fall Line and travel up the Coosa as far as Rome, Georgia. One famous resident was William Lowndes Yancey, a firebrand newspaper editor and statesman who was an influential advocate of states' rights and Southern secession. In February 1861, representatives from seven Southern states met in Montgomery to form the Confederate government, inaugurating Jefferson Davis as their president on the steps of the Alabama state capitol. The first six states to secede were those whose residents owned the most slaves in the South. The same year saw the majority of Wetumpka's male population going off to war. Wetumpka was never harmed by Federal troops. No Union troops entered the area until early 1865, and they were driven to reach Montgomery to punish the former Confederate capital before the war ended. Veterans of the war returned to a city and a region whose economy had been completely destroyed. In 1866, a Reconstruction government drew up a new plan of counties for the state, and Elmore County was created out of parts of Coosa, Autauga, and Montgomery counties, with Wetumpka as its county seat. (Rockford was chosen as seat of the \\"new\\" Coosa County.) Despite this, the city's future seemed grim. Before the war (in 1850), the population had reached 3,824 to become the 3rd largest city in the state (behind Mobile and Montgomery). By 1870 it had 1,137 residents (with Black residents outnumbering Whites by a margin of 594 to 543); in 1880, 816 residents; by 1890, it had declined to 619, and would bottom out at 562 in 1900. Not until 1950 would it return to the population it had a century earlier (with 3,813 residents). In 1886, the worst flood in city history inundated the west bank and most of downtown. The bridge connecting the city's two halves was washed away, and more than a year passed before it was replaced. The Lexington Kentucky Morning Herald of October 3, 1900, had a rather grim addition to Wetumpka's history: =Progress= Downtown Wetumpka with Model T Ford cars The first paved road linking Wetumpka with Montgomery was completed in 1924. Montgomery continued to grow during the two World Wars because of military spending in the region and the growth of the state government. By the 1950s, the ubiquity of the automobile allowed Wetumpka's residents to commute daily to Montgomery for work. Geography Wetumpka is located southwest of the center of Elmore County at (32.540972, ‚àí86.207726), and sits on both sides of the Coosa River northeast of its confluence with the Tallapoosa River, where they merge to become the Alabama River. The city is situated astride the Fall Line, where the Appalachian foothills give way to the flat Gulf Coastal Plain. The city is located along many major US and state routes, notably U.S. Route 231, which runs east of downtown, leading north 28 mi (45 km) to Rockford and south 18 mi (29 km) to downtown Montgomery. Alabama State Route 14 runs west to east through the downtown area, leading east 22 mi (35 km) to Tallassee and southwest 17 mi (27 km) to Prattville. Other state highways that run through the city include Alabama State Route 9 and Alabama State Route 170. Downtown Wetumpka covers two city blocks, and is bordered on the northwest by the Coosa River. The Bibb Graves Bridge crosses the river here, and is the city's most recognizable landmark. Directly across the bridge are the city's three antebellum churches, the First Methodist, First Presbyterian, and First Baptist. On January 19, 2019, a tornado destroyed the First Presbyterian church and badly damaged the first Baptist church.https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2019/01/19/alabama- tornado-wetumpka-damage-first-baptist-church-presbyterian- al/2628693002/http://www.wsfa.com/2019/01/20/first-presbyterian-church- destroyed-pastor-reflects/ According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.66%, is water.

It is located on the Coosa River about northeast of Birmingham and southwest of Chattanooga, Tennessee. It is the primary city of the Gadsden Metropolitan Statistical Area, which has a population of 103,931. As of the 2010 census, the population of the city was 36,856, with an estimated population of 35,000 in 2019. Gadsden and Rome, Georgia, are the largest cities in the triangular area defined by the interstate highways between Atlanta, Birmingham, and Chattanooga. In the 19th century, Gadsden was Alabama's second-most important center of commerce and industry, trailing only the seaport of Mobile. The two cities were important shipping centers: Gadsden for riverboats and Mobile for international trade. From the late 19th century through the 1980s, Gadsden was a center of heavy industry, including the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and Republic Steel. In 1991, following more than a decade of sharp decline in industry, Gadsden was awarded the honor of All-America City by the National Civic League. History The first substantial European-American settlement in the area that developed as Gadsden was a village called \\"Double Springs\\". It was founded in about 1825 by John Riley, a mixed-race American Indian and European-American settler who built his house near two springs. Riley used his house for a stagecoach stop on the Huntsville-to-Rome route. The original building still stands as the oldest in Gadsden. The house was purchased by brothers Gabriel and Asenath Hughes in 1840. The Hughes brothers purchased much of the land between Lookout Mountain, the Coosa River, and the mouth of Wills Creek. The brothers proposed constructing a railroad from the port of Savannah to Nashville, Tennessee through their land.Lawrence, James. A Study of the Origins of Gadsden, Alabama. 2005. The original survey of Gadsden included the Hughes brothers' land, plus that of John S. Moragne and Lewis L. Rhea. On July 4, 1845, Captain James Lafferty piloted the steamboat Coosa to the settlement. He landed near the site where the Memorial Bridge was built. The Hughes brothers suggested renaming the town as \\"Lafferty's Landing\\", but residents adopted \\"Gadsden\\" in honor of Colonel James Gadsden of South Carolina. He later was noted for negotiating the United States' Gadsden Purchase from Mexico.Gadsden-Etowah Tourism Board: Early Gadsden History (archived) In 1867, after the American Civil War, the legislature organized Baine County; Gadsden was incorporated and made the county seat. After a constitutional convention, the new legislature dissolved Baine County in 1868 and renamed it as Etowah County. Gadsden retained its standing as county seat.\\"Gadsden\\", Encyclopedia of Alabama By the late 19th century, Gadsden had developed as a major river port on the Coosa River, and was second to Mobile, a seaport on the Gulf Coast, in importance. It also developed as a center of heavy industry. =20th century to present= With unionization, industrial workers could earn middle-class salaries and improve their lives, even as African Americans struggled under Jim Crow laws and political disfranchisement. The city reached its peak of population in 1960. Affected by the national restructuring of railroads and heavy industry, most of Gadsden's major industries closed in the 1970s and 1980s. The city lost many jobs and much population, and began to decline. The city government has struggled to manage the transition to a different economy, just as numerous other industrial cities had to do. Redevelopment efforts, such as the Cultural Arts Center and downtown revitalization, earned Gadsden first place in the 2000 City Livability Awards Program of the US Conference of Mayors.\\"Gadsden Receives First Place in 2000 City Livability Awards Program.\\" The United States Conference of Mayors , Accessed December 9, 2005.

The city was home to Congregation Beth Israel, a Reform synagogue founded in 1908. In a 1960 attack, the synagogue was fire-bombed, its windows smashed, and two members shot and wounded by a Nazi sympathizer.Webb, Clive. Fight Against Fear: Southern Jews and Black Civil Rights, University of Georgia Press, 2001, pp. 142-143.

Law enforcement Gadsden is served by a 106-member municipal police department that includes a Patrol Division and Detective Division. The Patrol Division operates patrol, a bomb squad unit, special projects team, and a joint SWAT team with the Etowah County Sheriff Office.

In May 2010, the Gadsden Police Department acquired two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under the auspices of a $150,000 federal grant. The drones are equipped with video cameras and wireless transmitters, designed to be used for aerial surveillance., KTRK Television Education The Gadsden City Board of Education oversees fourteen schools: eight elementary schools, three middle schools, one high school, and two specialty schools (one alternative center and one technical center). A new high school, Gadsden City High School, replaced the three former city high schools (Emma Sansom High School, Gadsden High School, and Litchfield High School) via merger for the 2006‚Äì2007 school year. Gadsden is home to Gadsden State Community College, the second largest of the 27 two-year institutions in the Alabama Community College System. This was founded by former Governor George Wallace. Small satellites of Jacksonville State University and the University of Alabama also offer college courses in Gadsden. Gadsden is home to the first statewide day-treatment program for juvenile offenders. The Community Intensive Treatment for Youth Program (C.I.T.Y.) was founded in January 1981 by Edward E. Earnest (1943-2005). With the assistance and support of the Honorable Judge Robert E. Lewis (1927-1993), the city of Gadsden, and the Gadsden City Board of Education, the C.I.T.Y. Program began enrolling students on February 1, 1981. C.I.T.Y. is designed to be a multi-dimensional program emphasizing habilitation (i.e., equipping at-risk youth on juvenile probation with skills needed to meet the demands of modern society). Its objectives are: 1. to identify the at-risk youth's individual strengths and weaknesses, 2. to provide an individualized environment in which the at-risk youth can develop skills, and 3. to alter the natural environment of the at-risk youth so that new acquired skills are nurtured and encouraged. To achieve these objectives, C.I.T.Y. offers academic remediation in reading, math, language; intensive counseling that involves behavior modification, consumer education, and job readiness training. After all objectives have been met, C.I.T.Y. provides GED preparation, return to public school, and placement into technical school, college, job, or military service. In 1983, C.I.T.Y. Program of Etowah County (Gadsden) received the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges Unique and Innovative Project Award. On October 1, 2009, C.I.T.Y.‚Äôs name was changed to Special Programming for Achievement Network (S.P.A.N.) It operates under the directorship of the Alabama Department of Youth Services.

It is part of the Gadsden Metropolitan Statistical Area. At the 2010 census the population was 4,286. History Hokes Bluff was established on a high bluff overlooking the Coosa River. The town was called \\"The Bluff\\", and was used as a lookout station for Native American tribes, as they could see a great distance across, up and down the Coosa River. Hokes Bluff was one the staging areas where the Cherokee were collected, and sent to Gunter's Landing (Guntersville), and west to Oklahoma on the Trail of Tears. Settlers came into the area in the 1840s. Daniel Hoke Jr. was among the settlers, who came in 1850 and built a trading post and a blacksmith shop near the site of the bluff. The town was renamed \\"Hoke's Bluff\\" after him in 1853 by W.B. Wynne, a friend of Hoke. The town was raided and pillaged during the Civil War by raiding parties of both sides of the Union and the Confederacy. John Henry Wisdom, who became the \\"Paul Revere of the Confederacy\\" after making his famous ride from Gadsden to Rome during the Civil War, was a resident of Hokes Bluff. A new mail route was established from Gadsden to Hokes Bluff in 1890. Before it was established, Hokes Bluff had poor mail service, receiving most mail by steamboat. The post office was established in 1877 and discontinued in 1931. One legend associated with the town is about Tawannah Springs, the town's water supply. It is said that the springs are named for a Native American princess (Tawannah) who grieved herself to death after her cousin, Princess Noccalula, jumped herself to death at Noccalula Falls in Gadsden. Hokes Bluff was incorporated in 1946 with a population of 1,200. W.B. Ford was the first mayor. In 1949, a water system was installed with a 75,000 gallon reservoir and 54 hydrants.

It incorporated in 1950. The population was 9,602 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Gadsden Metropolitan Statistical Area. History This city was named after U.S. Highway 411, called Rainbow Drive, which runs through the middle of the city. Some of the older citizens say it was named after the US 42nd Infantry Division, known as the \\"Rainbow Division\\". As early as 1818, families from the Carolinas and Georgia began to migrate to the area and homestead land near the Coosa River. Hernando de Soto's troops were the first visitors to the area in 1540, and today a bridge stands where the Pensacola Trading Path crossed the Coosa River. A paved highway now traces the trail that was cut from Nashville to Horseshoe Bend by Andrew Jackson on his way to fight the Creek Native Americans in what is now known as the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. Originally called \\"Coosa Bend\\", the area was later called \\"Morgan's Cross Road\\". It was located at the intersection of the Gadsden-Ashville Road and Gilbert's Ferry Road. The land was passed from Edmond Jones to his son Clayton, who never married. When he died, the land passed to his sister, Luvica Morgan, who was also the wife of William Morgan. Knowing the importance of education, John Sheffield Jones, the grandson of Edmond Jones, an original settler, donated $1,000 and the land for the construction of the first John S. Jones Elementary School. Later, John S. Jones burned to the ground and a new elementary school was built and serves the Rainbow City area today. On Saturday, April 2, 1831, a church was organized at the Harmony Meeting House. Thomas Morgan served as the first pastor. A few years later, the first Baptist association was organized by Rev. John Gilliland. Harmony was one of the first five members in the association. The adjoining cemetery, Old Harmony Cemetery, has been declared a historic landmark. This cemetery has black and white slaves buried in it, Native Americans, single and double interment, and most of the tombstones have poems and writings on them. They say one man is buried crosswise because he lived crosswise with the world. Education The city is served by the Etowah County Board of Education. The city has one public elementary school, and shares a middle and high school with neighboring Southside. There is also a private school for the city, Westbrook Christian School.

Town history In the 1880s, a railroad work crew leader and engineer by the name of Phillip Campbell (originally from England) established a work camp. Mel Allen, a prominent local businessman, told Campbell that if he would construct a railroad depot and add a side track to the stretch of railroad going through the area, Allen could develop a town, which he would name after Campbell. Campbell built both the depot and siding, and Allen followed through on his promise. Phil Campbell is one of only two towns in Alabama given both the first and last names of an individual - the other is Susan Moore. In June 1995 the Scots writer Phil Campbell organized a convention in this town for people with the name \\"Phil Campbell\\". Twenty-two Phil Campbells and one Phyllis Campbell attended; they hailed from all over the United States. The article about the Phil Campbell convention was published in Might magazine, a San-Francisco-based publication founded by writer Dave Eggers. The essay was later included in Might's anthology, Shiny Adidas Tracksuits and the Death of Camp, and the convention was mentioned by Ripley's Believe it or Not! A second \\"Phil Campbell Day\\" was organized the following year, but it was not as well attended. Phil Campbell's city hall maintains a file of all the Phil Campbells who visit and check in. = Tornado = EF5 damage from the April 2011 tornado On April 27, 2011, the town suffered extensive damage from a very large and swift-moving tornado. The tornado was rated EF5 with estimated winds of 210 mph. The tornado damaged many buildings in and around the main part of town. Twenty-seven people in Phil Campbell died in the event. A reporter stated that the town may never be able to recover from the tornado because the damage was so extensive. Phil Campbell, a Scot writer who settled in Brooklyn, New York, was planning another namesake convention for June 2011. After the tornado, he converted his organizing to a relief effort. He called on the Phil Campbells of the world and other supporters to unite under the slogan, \\"I'm with Phil\\". He set up a website for people to donate money to help repair houses in two areas of the town, in addition to assisting in the repair of the high school and city hall. Attendees at the convention later traveled to the town to assist the local community in rebuilding. Andrew Reed, a resident of the town, directed a documentary about the Campbells' relief effort called I'm With Phil. The town had also been affected by an F5 tornado during the 1974 Super Outbreak. Town council The members of the city council are Danny Brown, Lynn Landers, Roy Nagle, Eddie Barton, and Jim Cartee. The mayor of Phil Campbell is Steve Bell. Phil Campbell High School The first school in Phil Campbell was a two-story frame building constructed in 1910. It was located at the back of the Phil Campbell Methodist Church. The school was subsequently destroyed by fire. The second school was constructed in 1915 and was located at the site of the present school on Alabama State Route 13 in Phil Campbell. This school was a small wooden building and was also destroyed by fire, on Christmas Day, 1924. During the next two years, classes were held in local church buildings, the town's former bank building, and the U.S. Post Office building located near the railroad. Graduation services for the first accredited Phil Campbell High School class were conducted in 1926 in the Phil Campbell Methodist Church. The class had nine graduating members.Photograph of Graduating Class The third Phil Campbell school was completed in 1926. It had a main classroom building and a vocational school. After the main building was destroyed by fire in 1954, the present school buildings were constructed. After the 2011 tornado, the damaged high school was torn down. A new school was completed and opened in September 2014. Sports The boys basketball team won the state title in 1947, defeating Scottsboro 23-21.

Highlights of the downtown district include the Chat 'n' Chew restaurant and Mrs D's. Other businesses include a Piggly Wiggly grocery store, H&R; Block, and Dollar General. The town has a total of three traffic lights. Every summer Phil Campbell hosts an annual celebration, the Downtown Hoedown (formerly Phil Campbell Day). The celebration features carnival rides, car shows, and arts- and-crafts items for sale. Local bands and singers perform in the evening. Beginning in 2010, there was a 5k-road race called the Hoedown Hustle (in 2013 renamed the Judy James Memorial, a benefit for pancreatic cancer), and a 1-mile fun run. The town is home to a campus of Northwest-Shoals Community College (the state's first junior college). Before Christmas every year, students from NWSCC perform The Legend of Toyland. This is a live choreographed performance set to pre-recorded narration. It has been produced for more than 25 years. Schools from surrounding counties bring students to watch the performance. Lanny McAlister (music director at NWSCC) is credited with the creating the production and directing it since then.

It was founded in 1907. The population was 3,158 at the 2010 census, down from 3,374 at the 2000 census. The town's name comes from the native red clay soil and the many bay trees (Persea borbonia) in the area. History What is now Red Bay was originally known as \\"Vinson's Crossroads,\\" and was initially located further to the southwest along Gum Creek. A branch of the Illinois Central Railroad was constructed through the area in 1907, and Red Bay developed into an important lumber and shipping center. The city incorporated during this same period.James P. Kaetz, \\"Red Bay,\\" Encyclopedia of Alabama, 7 June 2018. =Oak trees= One of the city's most well known and admired features are the Red Bay oak trees. The trees, planted by the Red Bay Garden Club in the 1930s, cast a canopy over Main Street. =Red Bay High School= The first school in Red Bay was located where the First United Methodist Church stands today. In 1903, this school had one faculty member who was responsible for teaching, as well as most of the custodial duties. After crops were harvested, students attended school through the remainder of the fall and winter months until the spring planting season.Watts, Clara. \\"Franklin County Education Association Directory: 2004-2005.\\" Franklin County Chapter, Alabama Education Association. The second school was constructed in the early 1900s. It was located on the site that is now the location of the Red Bay City Park. It was a small building with few amenities. The school continued dismissals timed with the local harvests. In 1927, a new school site was selected, and a new school built for $45,000. Since this construction, the location of the school has not changed. The building constructed in 1927 was a brick \\"U\\", one of the most popular school designs in Alabama at the time. Facing the school, the right wing of the \\"U\\" housed the elementary classes while the left wing held the high school. Once inside the school, after going under the stone entryway, the office of the principal was on your immediate left. A small room on the right served as the library. A large auditorium with double wooden seats that could be folded and stored was centrally located between the two wings. The building housing the home economics and agriculture departments was located on the left of the main school building. At a later date, classrooms were added to the left wing of the main building. Due to the slope of the site, a ground-level lunchroom was included in this addition. With steps leading from the hallway, the first cafeteria available to Red Bay students became operational. Due to increased enrollment, a new high school section was completed in 1962. In 1967, the auditorium and elementary wing of the 1927 building was destroyed by fire. The disaster occurred while school was in session, but no injuries occurred. Plans began immediately to rebuild the school. A new auditorium and elementary classroom section first welcomed students during the 1968-69 school year. In 1976, Red Bay celebrated both the nation's bicentennial and the opening of a new gymnasium.

Later, the games were played at the American Legion Field which is the current location of Tiffin Motor Homes. Red Bay finished runnerup in football in 1974 and 1976. Following the 1976 runner-up game, there was a scandal involving Red Bay football team and coaches on alcohol abuse before the game. The football teams in the following seasons struggled to win a game, until the 1986-87 team which won the first game in years. There were players who, prior to this time, granted scholarships at Alabama and Auburn. One notable player was Van Tiffin, who went on to the University of Alabama and made his mark there by kicking a 52-yard game-winning field goal against Alabama's archrival Auburn that is now known in Alabama's hall of fame as \\"The Kick\\".

Loss of Charter  The Town of Eunola lost its charter when a judge ruled in August 2007 that because it had not held elections since regaining its charter in 1957, it was not functioning as a town. Several days later, many Eunola residents signed a petition in hopes of reincorporating, and papers were filed in Geneva County Probate Court to start the process. Probate Judge Fred Hamic then asked for an Attorney General's opinion on whether the town could reincorporate. In January 2008 the Attorney General ruled that Alabama law precludes a community with a population of less than 300 from being incorporated. Attorneys for the town argued that Alabama law allowed a town that had become dormant to become reinstated by a petition of the majority of the taxpayers in that town. However, the AG opinion stated that Eunola had not become dormant, but had been dissolved. That means, in essence, the Town of Eunola never existed and would have to incorporate through the requirements of Alabama law, including the population provision. For almost 50 years, the mayor and town council positions were changed by word of mouth instead of elections. Longtime residents said they don't recall anyone questioning the fact that elections were never held. The fact that Eunola had never held elections came to light after the Eunola Town Council attempted to enforce a 1988 zoning ordinance that would have kept a couple from placing mobile homes on their property for rent. Attorney Jeffery D. Hatcher of Geneva, Alabama challenged the validity of the ordinance on the grounds that it was not properly adopted, and also that it was moot because the town had never held elections since being granted a charter in 1957. Eunola sued the property owners in an effort to enforce the ordinance. Another lawsuit arose from that action, resulting in the town losing its charter after it was proven no elections were held.

At the 2010 census the population was 2,934. The city was named in honor of the Battle of Eutaw Springs, the last engagement of the American Revolutionary War in the Carolinas. Schools in Eutaw include Robert Brown Middle School, Eutaw Primary School, and Greene County High School.  History  Confederate statue in Eutaw's Mesopotamia Cemetery Eutaw was laid out in December 1838 at the time that Greene County voters chose to relocate the county seat from Erie, which was located on the Black Warrior River. It was incorporated by an act of the state legislature on January 2, 1841.http://www.lat34north.com/historicmarkersal/MarkerDetail.cfm?KeyID=32-09&MarkerTitle;=Welcome%20To%20Eutaw%2C%20Alabama%3A%20A%20City%20of%20Progress As the county seat, it also developed as the trading center for the county, which developed an economy based on cultivation and processing of cotton, the chief commodity crop in the antebellum years. The crop was lucrative for major planters, who depended on the labor of enslaved African Americans, and they built a number of fine homes in the city. Many have been preserved into the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Eutaw has twenty-seven antebellum structures on the National Register of Historic Places. Twenty-three of these are included in the Antebellum Homes in Eutaw multiple property submission. The Coleman-Banks House, Old Greene County Courthouse, First Presbyterian Church, and Kirkwood are listed individually. Additionally, the Greene County Courthouse Square District is a listed historic district in the heart of downtown. A nearby property, Everhope Plantation, is also listed in the register. During the Reconstruction Era, Eutaw was the site of a number of Klan murders and acts by insurgents who were not finished with the war. The county courthouse was burned in 1868; the prevailing theory for the burning of the courthouse is that it was intended to destroy the records of some 1,800 suits by freedmen against planters, which were about to be prosecuted. On March 31, 1870, the Republican county solicitor, Alexander Boyd, was shot and killed at his hotel when resisting being taken by a masked group of armed Klan members. (An early-20th century historian of the Klan claimed the group was from Mississippi.) That same night, James Martin, a black Republican leader, was killed near his home in Union, Alabama, also in Greene County. In the fall of 1870, in the run-up to the gubernatorial election, two more black Republican politicians were killed in Greene County. On October 25, 1870, white members attacked a Republican rally in the courthouse square that had attracted 2,000 blacks, who mostly voted Republican. The Eutaw massacre resulted in four black deaths and some 54 wounded outside the county courthouse. Most blacks did not vote in the fall's election, which showed a majority in Greene County for the Democratic candidate for governor. Whites continued to use violence and intimidation of blacks across the state to suppress their voting and to regain power in the state legislature. In many places in Alabama, lynchings increased in the late 19th century into the early 20th century. None was documented in Greene County during this period, according to a 2015 report by the Equal Justice Initiative. On May 16, 1892, Sheriff Cullen and Deputy Sheriff E. C. Meredith of Greene County, with aid of a posse, distinguished themselves by going into Pickens County after a lynch mob of about 50 men. The mob had taken African-American suspect Jim Jones from the Greene County jail, saying they were going to hang him in Carrollton for an alleged crime there. Cullen and his posse confronted the mob at gunpoint, and took Jones back to Greene County. =20th century to present= Agriculture has continued to dominate the economy of this county. Now conducted on an industrial scale, it has reduced the need for farm workers. Unemployment is high in the rural county. James Bevel, the main strategist and architect of the Civil Rights Movement, was buried in Ancestors Village Cemetery in Eutaw on December 29, 2008. In addition to his early work in the Nashville Student Movement and Mississippi movement, he initiated, planned, and directed the strategies for the 1963 Birmingham Children's Crusade, the 1965 Selma to Montgomery march, and the 1966 Chicago Open Housing Movement.

History Abbeville is the oldest remaining colonial settlement in East Alabama from Florida to the Tennessee line. It is older than either the county of Henry or the State of Alabama. European Americans set up an active trading post in Abbeville in Alabama Territory early in 1819. The first settler gateway to the wiregrass region was at Franklin, located fourteen miles west of Abbeville. Locals say that the name derives from the Muscogee name for Abbey Creek, Yatta Abba, meaning \\"dogwood tree grove.‚Äù Abbeville was designated as the Henry County seat in 1833; the seat had previously been Columbia. It was formally incorporated in 1853. =20th century to present= In February 1937, Wes Johnson, an 18-year-old African- American man, was accused of attacking a white woman and was arrested. He was abducted from the Henry County jail by a mob of 100 white men and lynched: shot and hanged to death.Oprah Winfrey, \\"Inside the memorial to victims of lynching\\", 60 Minutes, April 8, 2018; accessed April 11, 2018 His body was found \\"bullet marked\\" and \\"swinging from a tree.\\" As was typical of lynchings, none of the members of the mob was charged with a crime. Faye Walker Howell, a resident of nearby Dothan, Alabama, has done research on this case for 20 years. She has documented that Johnson and the white woman had a consensual sexual relationship. The white men could not live with that, and lynched the young man. Howell was featured on 60 Minutes on April 8, 2018 during an episode featuring Oprah Winfrey touring the new National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama. Johnson is among the lynching victims memorialized there.Lance Griffin, \\"Dothan resident featured in 60 Minutes segment with Oprah; set to air Sunday\\", Dothan Eagle, April 6, 2018; accessed April 11, 2018 Henry County is noted as among the 805 counties where lynchings took place.

An appeal was heard by the Alabama Supreme Court, which overturned the impeachment in June 1937. The Alabama Attorney General openly declared that Johnson was innocent of the charges against him. In 1944, Recy Taylor, an African-American woman, was gang-raped by seven white men. Although the men admitted the rape to authorities, two grand juries subsequently declined to indict them.

History James Joshua Head (1839‚Äì1927) founded Headland in 1871 as \\"Head's Land\\". He patented land, plotted the town and built his home. The post office opened, as \\"Headland\\", on October 10, 1871. The Headland Public Square was laid off in 1871 by J.J. Head with a vision for a branch courthouse. Henry County voters decided in the 1879 and 1885 courthouse site elections not to locate a courthouse on the public square. Henry has been Alabama's only county with three courthouses at the same time. J.J. Head sold Headland to Hosey C. Powell in 1879, who sold to Dr. Wyatt S. Oates in 1880. J.J. Head moved to Tampa, Florida, in 1883 and later established Lake Magdalene, Florida. Headland incorporated in 1884 with 26 white and 4 black petitioners. The railroad was built in 1893 along with the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Depot. The depot was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 1980. It has since been disassembled. Headland's \\"Spirit of the American Doughboy\\" statue was the first public statue in Henry County. It was erected on the square in 1926 as a tribute to the town's military dead. The square was paved in 1935.

In 2000, it broke Dothan's then-Henry County 1900 record of 3,275 residents with 3,523 and added nearly 1,000 more by 2010.

History Ashford Depot 1920's In March 1888, the Alabama Midland Railway built a small depot of Victorian railroad architecture in Ashford to be a waystation along the Bainbridge-to-Montgomery route. The depot was the only building to survive the 1915 fire that destroyed the rest of the town. The original depot received additions at least twice‚Äîan enclosed warehouse and open loading dock were added to the east, followed by racially segregated passenger waiting rooms on the west side. The depot faced two sidings that served for loading turpentine from the Adams Company still one block away, and pulpwood. Cotton bales, fertilizer, and a single sweet potato crop were loaded from both sidings. Old Planters Cotton Warehouse 1930's The depot changed hands as railroads consolidated. The Alabama Midland was absorbed by the Atlantic Coast Line, which merged in the 1980s with the Seaboard Air Line to form the Seaboard Coast Line. CSX Transportation later bought the Seaboard Coast Line. Ashford Depot had fallen into disrepair after it closed in 1978. In the 1980s, concerned citizens founded a preservation committee, led by Jimmy Burgess, and received a grant to add a new roof to the building. This committee also placed the depot on the Alabama Register of Historical Places. It remained active into the 1990s. Former Mayor Bryan Alloway revived the depot preservation committee after his 2000 election. This committee planned to incorporate and seek tax-exempt status in 2005. It received two US Department of Transportation grants ($850,000), two Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs grants ($290,000), and one Alabama Resource Conservation & Development (RC&D;) grant ($7500) to thoroughly renovate the depot. Construction began in fall 2004. The committee and Ashford City officials held a ribbon-cutting ceremony on November 17, 2005, to mark the end of Phase I of the reconstruction.

The town was incorporated on April 29, 1880http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-3607 and was the center of education, culture, commerce, and trade. Columbia was the largest town in the area during the 19th century and remains one of the area's oldest continuously operating municipalities. Columbia received its first cotton textile mill in 1891 and its first electric plant in 1892. A branch of the Henry County Courthouse was located here from 1889 until Columbia became part of Houston County in 1903. Columbia got electric street lights in 1900 and its first electric utility company in 1914. At the turn of the 20th century, Columbia was bypassed by the Alabama Midland Railway in favor of Dothan. As the railroads continued to take freight trade away from the riverboats. Columbia's position as a principal trade center began to decline; however, Columbia sustained itself as a thriving farming community through the mid-20th century.\\"Columbia\\". (1978).

At the time of 2010 census the population was 2,418, down from 2,728 in 2000. Bridgeport is included in the Chattanooga-Cleveland-Dalton, TN-GA-AL Combined Statistical Area. History Bridgeport developed after the 1840s, when European Americans established a riverboat landing here along the Tennessee River. This landing was a place for local farmers to trade their crops for other goods. Within a few years, a small hamlet known as \\"Jonesville\\" had developed around the landing, and included a trading post, gristmill, warehouses, and several saloons. The Jonesville post office opened in 1852.Gene Ford, National Register of Historic Places Inventory Form for Bridgeport Historic District, March 2002, Section 8, pp. 20-25. Fluctuating river levels made riverboat trade unreliable, and area merchants began campaigning for railroad access in the late 1840s. The first rail line reached Jonesville in 1852. A railroad bridge over the Tennessee River was completed in 1854, connecting the city with Chattanooga, Tennessee. In recognition of this accomplishment, the name of the city was changed to \\"Bridgeport.\\" Construction of a second rail line connecting Bridgeport with Jasper, Tennessee, to the north, began in 1860, but was not completed until after the Civil War.James Kaetz, ‚ÄúBridgeport,‚Äù Encyclopedia of Alabama, 2011. Retrieved: 26 September 2016. Railway bridge in Bridgeport destroyed by retreating Confederates, 1861 Because of its location on both a rail line and the Tennessee River, Bridgeport was a strategic site during the Civil War. The rail bridge at Bridgeport was among those targeted by the East Tennessee bridge-burning conspiracy in November 1861.Oliver Perry Temple, East Tennessee and the Civil War (R. Clarke Company, 1899), p. 380. Although this attempt failed, the bridge would be burned twice during the course of the war.Dennis Lambert, ‚ÄúBridgeport, Alabama: History,‚Äù South Pittsburg Historic Preservation Society website, June 2008. Bridgeport was the site of a major skirmish on April 29, 1862, when Union General Ormsby Mitchel seized control of the city, and numerous other small actions over the following year as Confederate forces attempted to regain control of the area. The city was burned by Confederate troops under General Braxton Bragg in the Summer of 1863, but it was reoccupied by Union forces. In the latter part of the war, Bridgeport was the site of a major Union shipyard that built gunboats and transports for the Union Army. The USS Chattanooga was built here; it became a vital part of the famous \\"Cracker Line,\\" which broke the Confederates' siege of Chattanooga in November 1863. In the early 1880s, brothers Frank and Walter Kilpatrick, investors from New York, along with their father, Edward, established a lumber company in Bridgeport. Believing the city's location and resources had extraordinary potential for development, the Kilpatricks began buying up land in the area. Other investors became interested in the city, and in 1889 the Bridgeport Land and Development Company was incorporated. This company bought up land and laid out a new grid pattern for the city, which incorporated in 1891. Frank Kilpatrick, who became the city's mayor, built a series of imposing Queen Anne-style houses on the street now known as Kilpatrick Row.Kelly Kazek, ‚ÄúCastles in the Sky: Oft- Overlooked Town of Bridgeport is Showplace of Queen Anne Homes,‚Äù AL.com, 2 January 2013. Several factories, including a pipe works, stove works, rail car works, and planing mill, were built along the river. The rapid development of Bridgeport came to an abrupt end, however, with the onset of the financial Panic of 1893. Investors withdrew from the area, and the Bridgeport Land and Improvement Company went out of business. Frank Kilpatrick returned to Bridgeport in 1895, and managed to lure some industry to the city. The Mission Revival-style Bridgeport Depot was completed in 1917, and two hosiery mills were operating in the city by the 1920s. The construction of the nearby Widows Creek Power Plant by the Tennessee Valley Authority in the 1950s brought a small housing boom to the city. Geography According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (4.00%) is water. The city is situated along the western bank of the Tennessee River, at river mile 410. This section of the river is part of Guntersville Lake, which is created by Guntersville Dam about 60 miles downstream from Bridgeport. The Cumberland Plateau rises prominently to the northwest, and the plateau's southern extension, Sand Mountain, rises across the river to the east. U.S. Route 72 connects Bridgeport with South Pittsburg across the Tennessee state line to the north, and Stevenson to the southwest.

It is located 30 miles each from the state boundaries of Georgia to the east (Dade County) and Tennessee to the north, about 45 miles from Huntsville, Alabama to the west and about 55 miles from Chattanooga, Tennessee to the northeast.  History  =Early history= Prior to Scottsboro's founding, the area surrounding the present- day city was inhabited by the Cherokee Indians. While the Tennessee Valley did not have large Native American settlements at the time of the first white settlers, there was a Cherokee town named \\"Crow Town\\" near where Scottsboro developed along the Tennessee River.Kennamer, John Robert, Sr., History of Jackson County Alabama, Jackson County Historical Association, Scottsboro, Alabama 1935 (reprinted 1993), page 3 As settlers began pouring into the eastern Tennessee region, chiefly from the Upper South, they found the Tennessee River to be an excellent source of food, water, and a way of shipping goods to the big cities. John Hunt, in 1805, decided to migrate to the area and built a small log cabin in the woods near the river. More people settled in the area, and Huntsville was formally incorporated in 1811. More settlers moved into the Mississippi Territory, resulting in the statehood of Mississippi, and the creation of the Alabama Territory in 1818. Delegates from Tennessee and the newly formed Madison County met in Sauta Cave and decided to admit a new county. On December 13, 1819, Jackson County was formed.(Kennamer, p. 17) One day later, the State of Alabama was admitted into the Union as the 22nd state on December 14, 1819. The first county seat of Jackson County was at Sauta, a former native town, near present-day Scottsboro. Early county meetings were held in Sauta cave. Sauta did not survive after the courthouse was moved to Bellefonte in 1821.(Kennamer, p. 166) Since Bellefonte had better access to the Tennessee River than Sauta, more settlers started moving to the area. They were also attracted by it being the county seat. Scottsboro's founder, Robert Thomas Scott, served in the Alabama LegislatureWoodfin, Byron, Lay Down With Dogs: The Story of Hugh Otis Bynum and the Scottsboro First Monday Bombing, The University of Alabama Press, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, 1997, p. 10 for almost 20 years and later ran a hotel in Bellefonte.Gist, W. Jerry, The Story of Scottsboro, Alabama, Rich Printing, Nashville, Tennessee, 1968, p. 43(Kennamer, p. 165) Since he and his wife, Elizabeth, wanted a place to call their own and were not very fond of Bellefonte, they moved to Scottsboro around 1850‚Äì53. The town was called Scottsville, Scott's Mill,(Kennamer, p. 164) or Sage Town(Woodfin, p. 10) until 1868. In 1853, the newly formed Memphis and Charleston Railroad (a stretch of railroad that starts at Memphis, TN, and ends in Charleston, SC) decided to build a station at Scottsboro and did so in 1857. In the same year, passengers started disembarking at Scott's Station. On January 20, 1870, Scottsboro was incorporated by the Alabama Legislature. A. Snodgrass was the first mayor. Scottsboro got its first telegraph office in 1872. Bellefonte citizens rejected the railroad because they did not want train travel to interfere with the town's thriving river trade. In addition, its low riverside land was not suitable for tracks.(Kennamer, p. 39) In 1861/1863, the Bellefonte courthouse was set ablaze and charred. The area was heavily damaged during the U.S. Civil War. Selection of the new county seat began in 1860 by having a contest to see which towns were suitable. Many of the county's towns pushed for their selection, but the leading candidates were Hollywood, Stevenson, Larkinsville, and Scotts-borough (Scottsboro). To narrow consideration, the county council decided that: * The town must be within of the Memphis & Charleston Railroad line (the rising form of transportation). * The town must be near the center of the county. The second requirement eliminated Stevenson and Larkinsville,(Kennamer, p. 67) and the County Commissioners ultimately selected Scottsboro as the county seat. This led to the rapid decline of Bellefonte, which also suffered from no railroad access. Courthouse construction began in 1868 with the jail following two years later.(Kennamer, p. 70) County commissioners sited the courthouse at its current location in the public square. The 20th century brought great changes to Scottsboro. In 1902, two cases of smallpox were found but the disease did not spread more widely. In 1903, the first car that came to the town drove through the square en route from Ohio to Florida. In 1906, local blacksmith H.C. Payne built Scottsboro's first homemade automobile, which was made with a wooden frame, four sprocket wheels and hand-powered cranks. In 1911, the courthouse was set ablaze and was rebuilt. In 1912, the courthouse was demolished and an election was held to determine whether the courthouse would be moved to Stevenson or stay in Scottsboro (some Stevenson residents did not think Scottsboro deserved the role of county seat). Scottsboro won the vote and the present courthouse was built (It was later renovated and expanded in 1954.) =History of local racism= The Scottsboro Boys case was among the most important civil rights cases in the history of American jurisprudence. It was twice appealed to the United States Supreme Court and established the principles that, in the United States, criminal defendants are entitled to effective assistance of counselPowell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932) and that people may not be de facto excluded from juries due to their race.Norris v. Alabama, 294 U.S. 587 (1935) In 1931 nine black youths, ranging in age from twelve to twenty, were accused in Scottsboro of raping two white women, Victoria Price and Ruby Bates, one of whom would later recant her accusation. The victims and accused alike had all hitched rides on a passing train on the Southern Railroad freight route from Chattanooga to Memphis on March 25, 1931. It happened to stop in Jackson County, Alabama where these women made their accusations to local officials against these black youths.James R. Acker, Scottsboro and Its Legacy, Praeger Publishing, Westport, Ct., 2008, pp. 2‚Äì3. The defendants were brought to Scottsboro for trial because it was the seat of Jackson County.James Goodman, Stories of Scottsboro, Pantheon Books, New York, N.Y., 1994, pp. 3‚Äì4. Street in front of court house where crowd gathered During the course of four trials, most of the youths were convicted and sentenced to death by all-white juries, although witnesses provided weak and contradictory testimonies. The case is now widely regarded (including in Scottsboro) as one of the worst travesties of justice perpetrated against blacks in the post- Reconstruction South. Only the first trials were held in Scottsboro. Of the original nine young black defendants (some of them minors at the time of arrest), accused of gang raping two fellow hobo white women on a freight train, eight were quickly convicted and sentenced to death by all-white juries in trials occurring in a mob atmosphere in Scottsboro. The only two local attorneys who were willing to take the cases had few qualifications for criminal defense work. They were unable to put up much of a defense when the judge gave them no time to prepare their defenses before the trials. He started the first trial as soon as they agreed to take the cases, and then began each case as soon as the jury had gone out on the previous one. In its two reviews of appeals from the case, the United States Supreme Court overturned their death sentences and convictions, saying that the convictions had been obtained by improper procedures. Those convicted spent at least six years and as many as nineteen years incarcerated in harsh local jails and state prisons. The Scottsboro Boys had served long prison sentences when Governor George Wallace partially mitigated this widely accepted injustice by issuing a pardon in 1976 for the one remaining Scottsboro defendant still imprisoned.David Aretha, The Trial of the Scottsboro Boys, Morgan Reynolds Publishing, Greensboro, North Carolina, 2008, p. 106. \\"In January, 2004, amidst television cameras and radio and newspaper reporters, a crowd gathered near the Jackson County Court House in Scottsboro to dedicate a historical marker commemorating the Scottsboro Boys' trial and their struggle for justice.\\"Id, at p.208. \\"An 87-year-old black man who attended the ceremony, one of the few who could remember the cases firsthand, recalled that the mob scene following the Boys' arrest 'was frightening' and that death threats were leveled against the jailed suspects. He applauded the town's move to install the plaque on the courthouse yard. 'I think it will bring the races closer together,' he said, 'to understand each other better.'\\"Id, at pp.208‚Äì209. The Scottsboro Boys Museum was opened in this city in February 2010.Civil rights leader urges crowd at Scottsboro Boys Museum opening to rededicate themselves to cause  al.com =Modern history= In 1900, Scottsboro was home to about 1,000 residents.(Gist, p. 256) Beginning in 1908, a ferry began transporting passengers and automobiles to and from Sand Mountain.(Gist, p. 153-154) In 1928‚Äì1931, the Kansas City Bridge Company built the B.B. Comer Bridge, a long steel bridge that now connects the county seat to Sand Mountain, almost tripling the town's population. The bridge entered use in July, 1930.(Gist, p. 64) By 2007, the aging structure was classified by the Alabama Department of Transportation as being a structurally deficient bridge with an overall rating of 7.7 out of 100. Construction of a replacement bridge commenced in October, 2007, and was expected to be complete by 2012. In 1932, a couple were wed on top of the bridge. The newlywed wife commented, \\"I wanted to be married where the light-blue water touches and meets with the light-blue sky‚Ä¶\\"(Gist, p. 159) In the 1980s, a second bridge was built to increase travel and reduce traffic on the B.B. Comer bridge. In 1913, the city purchased approximately for a water system on Sand Mountain. The first electric lights in Scottsboro became operational on January 21, 1916. Scottsboro's first hospital was established in 1923.(Gist, p. 154-6) In 1927, aviator Charles Lindbergh performed stunts in his famous plane the Spirit of St. Louis.(Gist, p. 157) In 1932, Scottsboro officially became a \\"city\\" when an act of the Alabama Legislature bestowed that title on towns with more than 2,000 inhabitants. Scottsboro's population at the time was about 2,304.(Gist, p. 160) In 1954, the courthouse was starting to deteriorate, so it was renovated and all the wooden walls were replaced with marble. Because of the growth in population and demand, more rooms were added to expand offices for services such as automobile tags and land records. Since the early 1980s to the late 2000s, Scottsboro has seen substantial population growth and an economy moved away from its rural agrarian past to a more diversified one.

King Caldwell Park in Scottsboro Also, on the old Memphis and Charleston Railroad near the public square, the freight depot still stands. Built in 1856, it is considered the oldest standing structure in the original city limits. During the Civil War, Union raiders and Confederate soldiers fought in a skirmish, which ended up with bullet holes in the brick walls and wooden cargo doors. The structure was restored and reopened as a museum in June 2012. First Monday has been a major draw for over one hundred years,Jackson Country Chamber of Commerce: Attractions perhaps since 1870.(Gist, p. 101) In the old Southern style, First Monday is a trade day (or flea market) in which people set up stalls, sell homemade wares, and generally have a good time.

The King Caldwell Park is named after Scottsboro native and philanthropist, David King Caldwell, who went by the name \\"King Caldwell\\". He moved to Tyler, Texas, where he became an oil tycoon and founded the Caldwell Zoo. He constantly gave generously to local causes in Scottsboro and paid for the higher education of many Scottsboro school children. He visited his namesake Caldwell School in Scottsboro and gave every white child in the school a shiny new quarter, at a time when that was a lot of money for a child to receive. Development The attraction of Guntersville Lake has brought in numerous real estate developers. The Goose Pond area of Scottsboro has seen recent development of communities centered around a lake-living lifestyle.

Stevenson Depot  Gazebo by Railroad museum The Stevenson Railroad Depot Museum, located in downtown Stevenson, is dedicated to preserving an important part of railroading history through the display of related artifacts. In addition, the museum displays artifacts recalling Native American culture, pioneer life, and Civil War events. The depot, which was built in 1872 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places, stands on the ruins of Stevenson's first railroad depot, which was built around 1852 for common use by the Nashville Chattanooga and the Memphis & Charleston Railroads. That original depot was destroyed either during, or shortly after, the Civil War. Bricks salvaged may have been used in the building of the present structure.  Fort Harker  Fort Harker Constructed by the Union Army in summer 1862 and expanded in 1864, using soldiers and slaves, Fort Harker was built on a broad hill a quarter-mile east of the town of Stevenson. It overlooked Crow Creek and was well within firing range of Stevenson‚Äôs strategic railroad lines, supply depots and warehouses. Ft. Harker was an earthen redoubt, square, with walls that were high, surrounded by an dry moat. It contained 7 cannon platforms, a bomb-proof powder magazine, a draw-bridge entrance and an 8-sided wooden blockhouse at its center.Payette, Pete (2006). Northern Alabama. Retrieved August 1, 2014. Fort Harker was critical to Union plans. No major fighting occurred here, but skirmishes and sniper attacks were common as territory traded hands between Union and Confederate forces. One other large fort, two smaller redoubts and at least seven blockhouses were constructed along the railroad lines at Stevenson during the Civil War. Stevenson was the major junction for the Memphis and Charleston Railroad and the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. In addition to forts, the Union Army established a medical facility and a refugee camp at Stevenson. The remains of Gen. Rosecrans‚Äô headquarters is on the National Register of Historic Places. Both may be seen near downtown Stevenson today.  Depot Days  Every June, the town of Stevenson holds the annual Depot Days celebration. This celebration includes many different aspects of the southern town's culture and celebrates the great things that Stevenson represents. The week-long celebration is concluded with a parade, a day full of activities, and a street dance in the middle of Downtown Stevenson.  North Jackson High School  Stevenson is the location of the North Jackson High School. In 1993, the school won the Alabama 4A State Title in football.

The population was 27,456 at the 2010 Census.United States Census It is within the Birmingham-Hoover, AL Metropolitan Statistical Area, of which Jefferson County is the center. It developed rapidly as an industrial city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 2019 it was named Alabama's \\"Worst City to Live in\\" by 24/7 Wall Street. History The town was founded in the postbellum era by the Bessemer Land and Improvement Company, named after Henry Bessemer and owned by coal magnate Henry F. DeBardeleben. He had inherited Daniel Pratt's investments.Alabama Men's Hall of Fame: Henry Fairchild DeBardeleben , Samford University The mayor and councilmen voted to incorporate the city of Bessemer on September 9, 1887.\\"Bessemer\\", Encyclopedia of Alabama Located 16 miles southwest of Birmingham, Bessemer grew rapidly and its promoters believed that it might overtake the other city in economic power. Given the iron ore, coal and limestone deposits in the area, the city became a center of steelmaking from about 1890 through the 20th century. It attracted rural migrants from across the South, as well as European immigrants. By the 1950s, the city was majority African American in population.S. Jonathan Bass, He Calls Me By Lightning: The Life of Caliph Washington and the Forgotten Saga of Jim Crow, Southern Justice, and the Death Penalty, Liveright Publishing, 2017 The industry went through considerable restructuring in the late 20th century, and jobs moved out of the area. Steel is no longer made there. Geography Bessemer is located approximately southwest of Birmingham. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.17%) is water. Bessemer is situated in the midst of the iron ore and limestone district of Alabama, in the southern part of Jones Valley (about wide). Iron ore was mined on the hills on the city's southeast side, coal was (and still is) mined to the north and west, and limestone deposits were also nearby. All three ingredients were necessary for steelmaking, which led to the area becoming a major steel center from about 1890 through the twentieth century. Steel is no longer made within the city limits, but is still manufactured in the neighboring city of Fairfield. =Climate= The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Bessemer has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \\"Cfa\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Bessemer, Alabama Demographics As of the 2013 American Community Survey, there were 27,336 people living in the city. 72.0% were African American, 24.0% White, 0.1% Native American, 0.2% Asian, 0.1% from some other race and 0.4% from two or more races. 3.2% were Hispanic or Latino of any race. As of the census of 2000, there were 29,672 people, 11,537 households, and 7,868 families living in the city. The population density was 729.0 people per square mile (281.5/km2). There were 12,790 housing units at an average density of 314.2 per square mile (121.3/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 69.55% Black or African American, 28.93% White, 0.28% Native American, 0.18% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.30% from other races, and 0.74% from two or more races. 1.14% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. There were 11,537 households, out of which 30.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 34.6% were married couples living together, 29.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.8% were non-families. 29.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.52 and the average family size was 3.12. In the city, the population was spread out, with 26.8% under the age of 18, 9.6% from 18 to 24, 26.1% from 25 to 44, 21.1% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 82.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 75.8 males. The median income for a household in the city was $23,066, and the median income for a family was $28,230. Males had a median income of $29,413 versus $21,552 for females. The per capita income for the city was $12,232. About 24.2% of families and 27.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 37.8% of those under age 18 and 24.7% of those age 65 or over. Economy The Bright Star in Bessemer is Alabama's oldest restaurant The groundbreaking of the Amazon fulfillment center in Bessemer in 2018. In 1900, Bessemer ranked eighth in population in the state, second in amount of capital invested in manufacturing, and fourth in the value of its manufactured product for the year. By 1911, ore mining, iron smelting, and the manufacture of iron and coke were the chief industries of Bessemer. Truck farming was also an important industry, dating from the area's agricultural past. Both blacks and whites from rural areas were attracted to the city for its new work opportunities. Gradually African Americans moved into industrial jobs and became part of integrated unions; such jobs enabled many working-class families to enjoy middle-class incomes. Today, ore mining has ended, as supplies were exhausted. Manufacturing remains a factor, with the U.S. Pipe and Foundry ductile pipe plant on the city's north side. On May 9, 2007, U.S. Pipe announced that it would be building a new $45-million foundry near the current plant. The site was selected, among other reasons, for having available space for potential future expansions. U.S. Pipe is the largest domestic producer of Ductile Iron pipe in sizes 4 inch through 64 inch. The city was once home to a large railroad car manufacturing factory, operated by Pullman Standard for many decades and later by Trinity Industries. With railroad restructuring in the late 20th century and other manufacturing moving offshore, this plant ceased most production in the 1990s. In 2012, BLOX LLC (bloxbuilt.com) a manufacturer of modular components for healthcare facilities moved into this facility. The decline of mining and exodus of the steelmaking and railcar manufacturing industries resulted in extensive loss of jobs. The city has lost population since a peak in 1970. It faced an economic crisis in the early to mid-1980s, as unemployed workers constituted more than one-third of the workforce. Since that time the city, through the efforts of the Bessemer Area Chamber of Commerce and the Bessemer Industrial Development Board, has been successful in diversifying its economy. It is recognized for its business growth. In June 2018, Amazon announced that it would build a new , $325 million fulfillment center in Bessemer which will initially create 1,500 new jobs. Crime increased following the rise in unemployment and social disruption from the decline of manufacturing industries in the area. As of 2019 Bessemer ranks first in terms of violent crimes for US cities with 25,000 or more people. Arts and culture The performance center Bessemer Civic Center provides multiple performance spaces for music and theatre. Government Bessemer uses the mayor‚Äìcity council form of government. The council has seven members, elected from single-member districts. As of 2016, Kenneth Gulley is mayor, a position elected at-large.Jesse Chambers, \\"Bessemer Mayor Kenneth Gulley talks about the state of his city\\", Al.com, 08 February 2013 at 5:58 PM, updated February 15, 2013 at 11:35 AM He was first elected in 2010 and reelected to a second term in 2014.\\"Mayor's Office\\" , Bessermer, Alabama A satellite Jefferson County courthouse is located in downtown Bessemer. There is a special county government district, known as the \\"Bessemer Cutoff\\", which was established in the middle of the 20th century when Bessemer was a major city in its own right. A separate county government was considered a possibility, but there was not sufficient land area to meet legislative requirements for a county. The \\"Cutoff\\" had a separate series of Alabama license plates, with a different numeric prefix than the rest of the county. Bessemer has since been surpassed in size by Birmingham suburbs such as Hoover. But Bessemer retains the branch county courthouse to this day. The term \\"Bessemer Cutoff\\" continues to be used regularly by area residents.

Education =Public schools= Bessemer operates its own school system independent of Jefferson County schools. The system includes: * Hard Elementary * Jonesboro Elementary * Greenwood Elementary * Abrams Elementary * Westhills Elementary * Bessemer City Middle * Bessemer City High School (formally Jess Lanier) The Board of Education also operates the Quitman Mitchell Opportunity Center, which includes an adult learning center, Even Start child care center, and New Horizon Alternative School. =Private schools= K‚Äì12 private schools in the Bessemer included Bessemer Academy and Rock Christian School. =Community college= Lawson State Community College operates the former Bessemer Technical College campus. The two schools merged in 2005 as a cost-saving measure. Media The Western Star is a weekly newspaper which covers Bessemer and nearby communities. The Birmingham News is published three days per week, and also publishes a weekly section devoted to news from Bessemer and nearby communities. One radio station, WZGX (1450 AM), operates within the city; it broadcasts some Spanish programming and music to appeal to the growing Mexican-American population of Jefferson County. It also continues a tradition of broadcasting high school football games on Friday nights. All of metro Birmingham's stations are heard in Bessemer, as well as several stations broadcasting from Tuscaloosa. Television station WDBB (channel 17) is licensed to Bessemer, but broadcasts from studios in Birmingham, simulcasting with WTTO (channel 21). All of Birmingham's television stations may be viewed in Bessemer, and some have established news bureaus there. Infrastructure Southern Railway depot in Bessemer, 1905. Photo by Jet Lowe. =Transportation= In 1911, the town was served by five railroad lines: Alabama Great Southern (Queen & Crescent route), the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, the Kansas City, Memphis & Birmingham (St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad system), the Birmingham Southern Railroad, and the Atlanta, Birmingham & Atlantic railways. Passenger service decreased after people started choosing to travel by automobiles, increasingly so after World War II. In addition, there was widespread restructuring in the railroad industry that also applied to freight lines. By 2006, the companies noted above had consolidated to CSX Transportation, which has lines to Birmingham and Brookwood; and the Norfolk Southern Railway, with lines to Birmingham, Mobile and New Orleans; Birmingham Southern continues in service. A major railroad feature is the \\"High Line\\", constructed by Tennessee Coal & Iron (predecessor to U.S. Steel) to ship iron ore from the mines on the city's south side to the steel works in nearby Fairfield. This elevated line traverses the eastern side of the city. Though tracks were removed over much of the High Line when the mines closed, part of the line is still used by the Birmingham Southern. All of the roadbed and bridges remain in place. Bessemer is served by the small Bessemer Airport to the southeast of the city. Commercial service in the region is provided by the much larger Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport, located north of downtown Birmingham (about 21 miles away in total). Major highways in Bessemer include I-20/59, I-459, U.S. Route 11, and State Route 150, which connects Bessemer with Hoover.

At the 2010 census the population was 2,945. It is part of the Birmingham-Hoover Metropolitan Statistical Area, which in 2010 had a population of about 1,128,047, approximately one-quarter of Alabama's population. It is one of four cities in Jefferson County named after cities in Great Britain. Many of the city's early settlers were of English descent; they named the town after the English tourist and resort city of Brighton, which is located on the English Channel. Geography Brighton is located at . According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. History Brighton was not settled by European Americans until the late 19th century. Brighton was officially founded in 1892, when developer G.B. Edwards subdivided a tract of land and sold lots. It was named after an English resort coastal town. It was situated along a dummy railroad line built in 1889 by the Bessemer & Birmingham Railroad Company to connect those two growing industrial cities. The Old Huntsville Road was renamed as Main Street and the city was incorporated in 1901. By that year, at least 100 families were living in Brighton. The town had a population of 1,502 by the 1910 census, with seventeen commercial establishments, including eight grocery stores. The city's fortunes have been closely linked to those of Woodward Iron Company. Together with coal mining in this area, the iron company was integral to the industrial development in this part of Alabama, which is based on the much larger cities of Birmingham, Bessemer, and Gadsden. After industrial restructuring in the late 1970s and when the iron company moved out, the town has declined in population since its peak in 1980. Brighton Cemetery, which is still operating, contains the graves of persons of Scottish, English and German descent who came to work at Woodward.Marjorie L. White, The Birmingham District, An Industrial History and Guide (1981), pp. 141-142 In August 1908, coal miner and union leader William Miller, who was black, was accused of blowing up the home of a white mine operator Finley Fuller. It was during a period of labor unrest as mine workers tried to organize unions. Miller was lynched by a white mob that dragged him out of the Brighton jail. They hanged and killed him not far from Brighton City Hall. Later, it was found that whites opposed to unionization had bombed Fuller's home; by linking the crime to a black man, they intended to increase general opposition to the union's drive for better wages.Jeremy Gray, \\"Marker honors Alabama coal miner lynched in 1908\\", AL.com, 14 December 2015; accessed 13 April 2018 In 2015, after the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) published its study Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror, the city of Brighton resolved to place a historical marker to commemorate Miller for his work with the union and as a victim of lynching. They worked in cooperation with EJI and placed the marker in a ceremony near City Hall. Brighton was the first city in Alabama to install such a memorial. In a related effort, scholarships will be awarded to high school students for writing essays about Alabama's racial history. City government Brighton has a Mayor‚Äìcouncil government. It operates both police and fire departments. Demographics At the 2000 census, there were 3,640 people, 1,413 households, and 921 families living in the city.

As of the 2010 census, the population of the town was 1,363. The mayor is Roger McCondichie. History The Brookside mine was opened in 1886 by the Coalburg Coal and Coke Company. It was purchased one year later by the Sloss Iron and Steel Company as a source of fuel for their blast furnaces in Birmingham. Following the practice of the time, the mined coal was processed into coke in rows of beehive ovens banked into the hillside below the mine opening. In 1897 a Robinson-Ramsey Coal Washer was installed, increasing the efficiency of coke burning and therefore the overall efficiency of the mine. Other advanced equipment was also installed at Brookside, placing it at the forefront of mining technology in the Birmingham District at the turn of the century. Brookside served as the headquarters for four Sloss-owned mines in the immediate area (Cardiff, Coalburg, Brazil and Brookside). Because the capacity of Brookside's processing equipment exceeded the mine output, some of the slack from the Brazil mine was brought to Brookside for washing and coking. Brookside was incorporated in 1898. The descriptive name Brookside stems from the Five-Mile creek that flows through the town. Sloss, like other employers in the booming industrial expansion of the early 20th century, had difficulty recruiting skilled labor. Recruitment efforts extended internationally and Brookside became the home of many Czechoslovakian immigrants and their families who made their way to the mines. As Brookside became a destination for Eastern European miners in the area, the culture of the town reflected their ethnic traditions. A Russian Orthodox church was founded and served to strengthen community ties. This church was one of the first Russian Orthodox churches built south of the Mason-Dixon. Unlike other mines where skilled whites and unskilled blacks could be played against each other by the owners, the Brookside miners were tightly organized and carried out a successful (albeit violent) strike in 1906. Between 1910 and 1920, mining operations jumped around to several seams and the number of miners fluctuated between a low of 54 in 1910 and a high of over 600 in 1914. In 1913 the mechanical coal cutters used previously were supplanted by hand picks. A new church building for St. Nicholas was completed in 1916. The 1920 Alabama coal strike, combined with a global depreciation in the coal market, led to a shutdown of the mine. When the strike was settled in 1921, Brookside mine was never re-opened. In 1924, Brookside served as one of the settings for the Famous Players-Lasky's 1925 feature film Coming Through, which was based on Jack Bethea's novel Bed Rock. Silent film stars Thomas Meighan, Lila Lee and Wallace Beery stayed with local families during production. (Jones-2007) Sloss removed all of the surface works and held on to the mine property. In 1952 Sloss merged with the U. S. Pipe and Foundry Company, a subsidiary of Jim Walter Industries since 1969. Saint Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church Brookside remains a small town with a distinct Eastern European flavor. Founded in 1894, its onion dome church was re-faced with brick in 1965 and still holds services for approximately 70 congregants. The ‚ÄúAnnual Russian/Slavic Food Festival,‚Äù observed the first full weekend of each November, brings visitors to tour the temple, see traditional Eastern European dances, and sample time-honored ethnic plate lunches and baked goods prepared by the Sisterhood of Saint Olga. Geography Brookside is located at (33.631867, -86.913068).

Industry and business Main entrance to the U.S. Steel Fairfield Works Though the United States steel making industry has gone through a decline through the last half of the 20th Century, U.S. Steel's Fairfield Works continues to be a major employer, though not in the levels seen around the 1950s. Advances in steel-making technology have enabled the works to produce roughly the same amount of product as during that era, but with a much smaller workforce. Portions of the Works have been closed over the years, but many parts of the complex have been reopened by smaller industries, some of which are steel-related. Fairfield is traversed by I-20/I-59. Three railroads serve the area: CSX Transportation (former Louisville and Nashville Railroad), Norfolk Southern Railway (former Southern Railway), and short-line Birmingham Southern Railroad, which is headquartered in Fairfield. The city's downtown area features a number of small businesses, primarily service-related. Other retail businesses are concentrated along Aronov Drive, northwest of Western Hills Mall, though those strip malls have declined due to closures of Kmart, Winn-Dixie, and Sears locations. Walmart shut its doors in early 2016 . All public bus transportation was terminated in July 2016 for failure to pay the bill. The water board has threatened to cut off all water to public buildings because of non payment.

As of the 2010 census, the population of the city is 8,380. History Fulton was a mining town in the 1900s. Fulton was incorporated in 1947. The town's name is derived from the combination of the names of two nearby communities, Fulton Springs and Glendale. This area was once known as Fulton Springs. Prior to the building of Interstate 65, US 31 was the main route for travelers northbound from Birmingham towards Nashville, Tennessee. As a result, hotels such as the Keystone Lodge and Buchmann Motor Inn prospered. On the city's southern edge was located one of the few drive-in theatres in the Birmingham area (the \\"Skyview\\"). This was torn down when I-65 was built in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Pine Bowl bowling alley is still a long time fixture in the city. Traces of the old routing of US 31 are still noticeable in the city. From just south of the city hall to an old bridge on this city's northern side, most of this old routing is known as Stouts Road or in some cases simply \\"old US 31.\\" Fultondale was a relatively stagnant community until the last decade. Growth has occurred in residential areas mainly west of Interstate 65, while retail development has focused along and near the I-65/Walkers Chapel Road exit. In the early 2000s, the Chapel Hills subdivision was begun on the west side of I-65 off of Ellard Road. In the years following, other new subdivisions have been built off of US Highway 31 including Black Creek Station, Town Square, and Fulton Springs.

The area has been thoroughly mined for coal and other minerals in the past 100 years. The city is served by two major north/south highways, Interstate 65 and US Highway 31. The new Interstate 22 encroaches on the city's western edge and on June 20, 2016, the interchange with I-65 just south of Fultondale opened. I-22 will provide direct interstate access to Memphis, Tennessee. Upon completion of Interstate 22, Fultondale will become the fourth Alabama city (after Birmingham, Montgomery, and Mobile) to be directly served by more than one two-digit interstate highway (I-65 & I-22). The only east/west thoroughfare of note is Walkers Chapel Road (west of US 31) and New Castle Road (east of US 31). Rail lines run north/south along the city's eastern edge from Boyles Yard in Tarrant to points north and east. Air travel is available from nearby Birmingham International Airport.

Newspapers include The Birmingham News (Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) and The North Jefferson News (weekly). On May 24, 2012, Advance Publications announced that its three Alabama newspapers (in Birmingham, Mobile and Huntsville) would do away with their print editions on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The move was a result of the continuing decline in advertising revenue and circulation for its traditional print products. The move places increased emphasis on their website, al.com, and reorganizes the Alabama properties into two companies: Alabama Media Group, the editorial side; and Advance Central Services Alabama, which will handle production, distribution and back-office services. The changes took effect on October 1, 2012, making Birmingham the second-largest city in the United States not to be served by a daily newspaper; New Orleans became the largest that same day. Education Fultondale is served by Jefferson County Schools. Fultondale High School is located on Carson Road on the northeast side of the city. Fultondale Elementary School serves grades PreK-6th grade and is located on the southern end of the city off of US Highway 31. In 2020, it was announced that Fultondale High School will get a new building and the Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School will move to the current high school location once renovations are completed. The school is nicknamed the Wildcats (and Junior Wildcats) and both schools' colors are orange and navy blue. Colonial Promenade Fultondale The development is a project of Colonial Properties and a portion opened in the fall of 2007. Target is the anchor tenant in the development along with Books-A-Million. Target features a Starbucks and Books-A-Million a Joe Muggs. Ashley Furniture HomeStores is located at the southern end of the shopping complex. Phase II of the Promenade opened in the fall of 2008 with a JCPenney, rue21 and Ross Dress For Less. Additionally, there are several restaurants in and around this development including: Chili's, Stix (Japanese), Logan's Roadhouse, and Full Moon BBQ. Mugshots Grill and Bar has announced it will be opening its Fultondale location in August 2020 at the site of the former Wintzell's. Retail and commercial Due to difficult topography, for many years Fultondale was limited in its ability to grow. However, as technology improved, the ability to convert what had been difficult to unusable land for retail and commercial purposes improved. Besides the retail development of Colonial Promenade, other retail development nearby includes Lowe's and various chain restaurants such as O'Charley's and Outback Steakhouse. Other older, more mature business establishments line US 31 in the center of the community including supermarkets, casual fast food, banks, a bowling alley and skating rink.  Parks and recreation  Fultondale's Black Creek Park is situated adjacent to Black Creek and includes batting cages, the Senior Center, walking trails, the Children's Park, and the Fultondale Bark Park with separate play areas for small and large dogs. The dog park is home to the annual Barking at the Moon Festival. The nature trail along Black Creek is part of a rails-to-trails project of approximately three miles in length and crosses historic Stouts Road. The city also maintains a park and sports complex across from Fultondale Elementary School that is home to the Fultondale Youth Football and Cheer Association games.

The population was 13,893 at the 2010 census.U.S. Census Bureau. 2010 Population Census for Incorporated Places History A large farm settlement near the area today known as Gardendale was settled around 1825. Some years later, other settlers began to move into the community commonly known as Jugtown, a name given to the area based on the presence of a large jug and churn factory that operated in the area. Some years later, Hettie Thomason Cargo, a school teacher, would lead a campaign to change the name of the community. In 1906, the name Gardendale was selected, and in 1955, the City of Gardendale was officially incorporated. Today, with more than 13,000 residents (estimated), the city of Gardendale has grown to include more than 400 businesses, 4 schools, and 24 churches. In 1996, the Olympic torch run passed through the city during the weeks leading up to the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta. Before Interstate 65 was constructed, the main route between Nashville, Tennessee and Birmingham, Alabama was U.S. Route 31. Prior to being built as a four-lane road, U.S. 31 was a twisting two-lane road that is still largely visible today. From the north end of Gardendale, it is now Snow Rogers Road, North Road, Moncrief Road, and then Main Street southward through the city to the Fultondale city limit where it becomes Stouts Road. In the fall of 2008, new signs were placed along the original route of Stouts Road through Gardendale denoting its historical significance as a stagecoach route between Tennessee and Birmingham during the 19th century. The first traffic signals in the city were located along U.S. 31 at Tarrant Road, Fieldstown Road, and Moncrief Road as well as Tarrant Road at Pineywood Road. A new signal at the intersection of Fieldstown Road and Main Street near city hall replaced a blinking signal shortly thereafter. Fieldstown Road was a narrow two lane road from U.S. 31 westward until Interstate 65 was built and then Fieldstown Road was re-routed onto the new road in the mid-1980s. An abundance of traffic signals have been erected in the city since those early days. In approximately 1970, the city installed street lights along U.S. 31 from the Fultondale city limits northward to the Moncrief Road intersection. The technology at that time was for blue vapor lights. Today, nearly 40 years later those same blue vapor lights still exist with some being replaced with the more modern bulbs near major intersections. Since 1980, Gardendale has annexed considerable amounts of land on the north, east, and west sides. Much of the eastern area is uninhabited. The western annexation is centered along Fieldstown Road. Most of the newest residential development has been in this area and along Shady Grove Road south of Fieldstown Road. The northern annexation has centered along US 31 and extends nearly farther north than 1980. The city has a working historical society, established January 23, 2006, that is working to record the history of the Gardendale area. They have a museum that is open to the public on Saturday mornings each week. It contains a variety of photographs, documents, and other historical memorabilia from Gardendale. Geography Gardendale is located at (33.6601033, -86.8127702). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. However, with the recent annexation of several thousand acres from the community of Mt. Olive and other unincorporated areas, the city now has an estimated total area of around . Gardendale is situated along one of the three major transportation corridors from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast (I-75, I-65, I-55). A tremendous volume of freight (via rail and truck) passes through or near Gardendale. Gardendale is served by two major north‚Äìsouth highways: Interstate 65 and U.S. 31. A new interstate highway, Interstate 22 will run northwestward from I-65 near Gardendale towards Memphis, Tennessee. This freeway is open from Coalburg Road near Fultondale just southwest of Gardendale to Memphis. Another future road project is the Northern Beltline which will run from Interstate 59 near Argo westward across northern Jefferson County, crossing I-65 on the northern edge of Gardendale. This highway is currently designated to become Interstate 422. This route is some 15‚Äì20 years away from completion. Major east‚Äìwest roads in Gardendale include Fieldstown Road (there has been some discussion of requesting a state highway designation for this road between US 31 and I-65 and perhaps westward towards I-22) which runs from U.S. 31 in Gardendale westward, Tarrant Road which runs from the city eastward, and Mt. Olive Road which runs northwestward from the city. Another future road project may be an extension of Fieldstown Road east of U.S. 31 to connect to the Castle Pines development (which is in the city but only accessible via a roundabout route nearly long) and then across New Castle Road, and then further east to connect to Carson Road. Gardendale is located in an area that once yielded large amounts of coal. Gardendale is located at the southwestern end of one of the Appalachian ridgelines running from eastern Tennessee into northeast Alabama. Several old and closed coal mines exist in the area as well as lands that were once strip mined and then replanted for forests. No major waterways are located in Gardendale but several streams feed into the Locust Fork of the Black Warrior River that passes north and west of the city. Much of the land inside the city limits on the east and northeast sides of Gardendale is rocky and hilly with deep ravines. This portion of the city is sparsely populated and has limited access by road. The only major rail line passing near Gardendale is a north‚Äìsouth track passing on the eastern edge of the city from Boyles Yard near Tarrant paralleling New Castle Road northward towards Blount County. This rail line carries freight and is not a passenger line. The nearest passenger train service is by Amtrak at the Birmingham station south of Gardendale. Commercial air travel is located at the nearby Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the local coal mines and steel mills attracted families from all over Alabama. As a result of this growth, Graysville established the City's first series of home developments and subdivisions.

History Helena, AL town historical marker sign Helena, AL town historical marker sign =Early settlers= The area was long the territory of the historic Muscogee people, known by English colonists as the Creek Indians. While Scots-Irish and English traders had interaction with them, and there was some armed conflict in the early 19th century, most European-American settlers did not come to this area until 1849. This was after the United States had conducted Indian Removal of the Creek and other Southeastern tribes in the 1830s, to lands west of the Mississippi River. The first European-American settlers to Helena, which they initially named Cove, were veterans of the final campaigns of the War of 1812. Members of Andrew Jackson's army were attracted to the quiet, peaceful valleys and streams after the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. By 1856, the Cove post office opened. Shortly thereafter, the settlers changed the name of the town to Hillsboro. =Civil War= The onset of the Civil War brought the need for the South to increase its manufacturing production and develop new industries. Coal and iron ore mines were dug throughout this area and the construction of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad provided new transportation connections. Helena became an important industrial center for the wartime efforts. Around 1864 a rolling mill was built on Buck Creek, near the rail lines to process the iron from Selma. Peter Boyle, an engineer for the railroad working on a new line, met and courted Helen Lee. He would name the rail station that supported the rolling mill after her. Eventually the town was named Helena after the train station. Wilson's Raid As the final battles of the Civil War were being fought, Union forces amassed a force for a cavalry raid to attack the South's war fighting capability, as Sherman's march had done the previous year. Led by James Harrison Wilson, this force passed through the town of Helena on March 30, 1865, where they destroyed much of the newly developed industry and residential buildings. =Reconstruction= Within a few years of the end of the Civil War, industrialists were again developing the area coal and iron ore resources. The railroads were rebuilt and coke ovens were established by the Eureka Company in 1870. The rolling mill was rebuilt in 1873, with support by spurred by Rufus Cobb, later elected as a two-term governor.Robert David Ward, \\"Rufus W. Cobb, 1878-1882\\" in Alabama Governors, edited by Samuel L. Webb and Margaret E. Armbrester (The University of Alabama Press, 2001), pp. 106-109. Much of what was Hillsboro had been absorbed by the expanding Helena area. The town was surveyed by Joseph Squire in 1873 and incorporated in 1877. By 1880, Helena contained > six mercantile stores, one drugstore, two hotels, and several boarding > houses‚Ä¶ The rolling mill had been expanded and modernized and the number of > merchants had increased.Ken Penhale and Martin Everse, Images of America: > Helena Alabama (Arcadia Publishing, 1998), 7-8. A rail yard was added by the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company. =Depression era= The town was reincorporated in 1917 after the initial incorporation paperwork was found to contain errors. Charles Hind was elected mayor the same year. Much of the industry began to decline as the economy contracted in the years after World War I. The rolling mill was closed in 1923 and many mine closures followed. As the Great Depression set in during the 1930s, the town fell on hard times. Many residents left to find work elsewhere.  1933 Tornado  Around 3 AM on May 5, 1933 residents were awoken to a massive tornado that ripped through the heart of Helena. A total of twelve persons were killed; 75 people were reported as injured. Many of the original houses were completely destroyed and railroad cars were overturned. The property damage was estimated to be in the range of $100,000 to $150,000 (1933 dollars).Shelby County Reporter, \\"12 Dead, 75 Injured, Property Damage Heavy,\\" 11 May 1933, Volume 90, Number 30 =Modern expansion= Helena remained a small town in the largely rural county until suburban growth from Birmingham reached the city in the late 20th century. Numerous residential and commercial developments have taken place, spurring improvements to city facilities and services. By the early 21st century, Helena had large population gains, with related growing pains in trying to provide services, as a result of its convenient location and high quality of life.History, City of Helena website Geography Buck Creek flows over the dam at Helena, Alabama, during the autumn low-water flow.

The Cahaba River and its tributary Buck Creek run through Helena. Buck Creek is dammed upstream of Alabama State Route 261 in the Old Town area to form Lake Davidson. It was used both for recreation and to generate water wheel power at the turn of the 20th century. Fishing, wading, and canoeing are popular uses of both waterways. Helena sits at the foothills of the very southern extent of the Appalachian Mountains as they descend into the Gulf of Mexico coastal plain. The area is largely rolling hills with numerous small streams, and undeveloped areas are primarily mixed woodlands. Downtown Birmingham is 20 mi (32 km) north via Alabama Route 261 to US-31 or I-65. Climate The climate of Helena is typical of the Deep South, with long, hot, humid summers and short, relatively mild winters. Summer high temperatures are commonly in the upper 90s and low 100s F; winter lows are usually in the 20s F. Measurable snowfall is rare, occurring only a few times a decade.

He was the second son of King Adolf Frederick of Sweden and Louisa Ulrika of Prussia, sister of Frederick the Great.Karl 2 ‚Äì utdypning (Store norske leksikon) Though known as King Charles XIII in Sweden, he was actually the seventh Swedish king by that name, as Charles IX (reigned 1604‚Äì1611) had adopted his numeral after studying a fictitious history of Sweden.Article Karl in Nordisk familjebok In Norway he is known as Charles II.Karl 2 ‚Äì utdypning (Store norske leksikon) Early life Prince Charles, in 1758 by Ulrica Pasch. Prince Charles was placed under the tutelage of Hedvig Elisabet Str√∂mfelt and then Ulrica Sch√∂nstr√∂m. He was appointed grand admiral when he was but few days old. He was described as a good dancer at the amateur theatre of the royal court. Reportedly he was not very close to his mother. The Queen preferred her youngest children, Sophie Albertine and Frederick Adolf.Alma S√∂derhjelm (1945). Gustav III:s syskon (The siblings of Gustav III) Stockholm: Albert Bonniers F√∂rlag. pp. 28‚Äì29. 23033 (Swedish) Charles was, however, his father's favorite, and similar to him in personality.Karl XIII, urn:sbl:12358, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Olof J√§gerski√∂ld), h√§mtad 2015-02-09. He was also described as close to his brother Gustav during their childhood. Because of his position as the heir to the throne after his elder brother Gustav, he was early targeted as a useful tool for the opposition to his brother: already in the 1760s, the Caps (party) tried to use him against his brother the crown prince through his then love interest countess Brita Horn, daughter of the Cap's politician Adam Horn. Gustav, however, was always careful to prevent Charles from being used by the opposition, which came to its first test during the December Crisis (1768), when Charles, ultimately, did not let himself be used by the Caps party. In 1770, he made a journey through Germany and France alone. Reign of Gustav III Gustav III, King of Sweden, and his brothers After the death of his father in 1771, when his brother the crown prince was abroad, the Caps once again attempted to use him against his brother, now King Gustav III of Sweden, and his mother Louisa Ulrika used this in order to have her own rights as a dowager queen respected by the Caps. Upon the departure of his mother to Prussia, and the return of his brother, however, Gustav III managed to win him to his side. In 1772 he cooperated in the Revolution of 1772 of his elder brother, King Gustav. He was given the task of using his connections in the Caps party to neutralize it and secure the southern provinces by use of the military, tasks he performed successfully and for which the king rewarded him with the title Duke of S√∂dermanland. Duke Charles in early years was the object of his mother's plans to arrange political marriages for her children. On the wish of his mother, he was to be married to her niece, his cousin Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt, a plan to which he had agreed in 1770. The government, however, refused to issue negotiations because of the costs. After the accession of Gustav III and the coup d'√©tat which introduced absolute monarchy, his brother terminated these plans against their mother's will in October 1772, and began negotiations for a marriage between Charles and his cousin Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp. As King Gustav had not consummated his own marriage, he wished to place the task of providing an heir to the throne with his brother. Charles agreed to the marriage in August 1773, and the marriage took place the following year. After a false alarm of a pregnancy of Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte in 1775, the king finally consummated his own marriage. The royal couple lived separate private lives and each had extramarital affairs. During the great succession scandal of 1778, when queen dowager Louisa Ulrika questioned the paternity of the issue of Gustav III, Charles sided with his brother the king against their mother, this despite the fact that it was in fact he who had informed her of the rumors regarding the legitimacy, something he however withheld from the king. Coronet created for Prince Charles and worn at his brother Gustav's coronation in 1772. Charles was described as dependent and easily influenced.Alma S√∂derhjelm (1945). Gustav III:s syskon (The siblings of Gustav III) Stockholm: Albert Bonniers F√∂rlag. p. 28-29. 23033 (Swedish) His numerous affairs gave him the reputation of being a libertine. He was reputed for his \\"harem\\" of lovers, of which the more well known were Augusta von Fersen, Charlotte Eckerman, Fran√ßoise- √âl√©onore Villain, Mariana Koskull and Charlotte Slottsberg, the last one reputed to have had political influence over him. He unsuccessfully courted Magdalena Rudensch√∂ld, and her refusal of his advances has been pointed out as the cause of the harsh treatment he exposed her to as regent during the Armfelt conspiracy. After the late 1790s, when his health deteriorated as a result of a series of rheumatic attacks, his relationship to his consort improved and she gained more influence over him.Alma S√∂derhjelm (1945). Gustav III:s syskon (The siblings of Gustav III) Stockholm: Albert Bonniers F√∂rlag. 23033 (Swedish) The Duke was known for his interest in the supernatural and mysticism, and he was engaged in several secret societies. He was a member of the Freemasons. He was reportedly a client of the fortune teller Ulrica Arfvidsson, and he also favored the medium Henrik Gustaf Ulfvenklou. In 1811, he founded the Order of Charles XIII, a Swedish order of chivalry awarded only to a maximum number of 33 knights, on the condition of confessing the Lutheran Evangelic Religion and being Freemasons. All Princes and Kings of the Bernadotte dynasty, the royal house of Sweden are from baptism, incorporate parts of the royal order of knights and freemasons. In addition are the order of merit granted to members of foreign Grand Lodges affiliated to the so- called Swedish System, such as the Grande Loge Nationale Fran√ßaise, if of royal rank. When the Swedish order of Freemason's states that \\"Freemasonry in Sweden has continued to develop under leadership of their Grand Masters, all of them belonging to the Royal House since more than 200 years\\", the origin of which arrives in large from King Charles II of Norway, XIII of Sweden. Duke Charles was given several political tasks during his tenure as a duke. In 1777, he served as regent during Gustav III's stay in Russia. In 1780, he served as formal chief commander during the king's stay in Spa. The same year, Gustav III named him regent for his son should he succeed him while still a minor. However, he was not appointed regent during the journey of the king to Italy and France in 1783-84, and in the following years, he came under the influence of Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm, who was in opposition to the monarch, and came to be less trusted by Gustav III. In 1785, he was offered the Dukedom of Courland by the nobility of the Duchy and given the support of Gustav III. This however never materialized. On the outbreak of the Russo-Swedish War of 1788 he served with distinction as admiral of the fleet, especially at the battles of Hogland (7 June 1788) and √ñland (26 July 1789). On the latter occasion he would have won a signal victory but for the remissness of his second-in-command, Admiral Liljehorn. The autumn of 1789, Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte wished to depose Gustav III and place her husband Duke Charles upon the throne.My Hellsing (2013). Hovpolitik. Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte som politisk akt√∂r vid det gustavianska hovet (Court Politics. Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte as a political actor at the Gustavian court) √ñrebro: √ñrebro universitet. (in Swedish) Her ideal was the Swedish Constitution of 1772, which she saw as a good tool for an enlightened aristocracy, and the war and the Union and Security Act had made her a leading part of the opposition. She cooperated with Prince Frederick Adolf of Sweden and Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm. The plan was to force Charles to act as a symbol of the opposition to the Union and Security Act when the time was right. When the time arrived to make Charles act, however, he refused, which effectively foiled the coup. Charles was in close connection to the opposition against Gustav III, and it is debated whether he knew of and supported the plans to assassinate the king.Nationalencyklopedin accessed online 2 January 2007, article Karl XIII Reign of Gustav IV Adolf On the assassination of Gustav III in 1792, Charles acted as regent of Sweden till 1796 on behalf of his nephew, King Gustav IV, who was a minor when his father was shot in the Stockholm opera. Gustav III had designated him regent in his earlier will. When he was dying, he altered the will, and while still appointing Charles regent of his minor son, he was no longer to rule absolute, but restricted by a government consisted of the supporters of Gustav III. After the death of the monarch, however, Charles successfully contested the will and was given unlimited power as sole regent. The Duke-regent was in practice not willing or capable to manage the state affairs, reportedly because of his lack of energy and staying power. Instead, he entrusted the power of government to his favorite and adviser Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm, whose influence over him was supreme. These four years have been considered perhaps the most miserable and degrading period in Swedish history; an Age of Lead succeeding an Age of Gold, as it has been called, and may be briefly described as alternations of fantastic jacobinism and the ruthless despotism. Reuterholm ruled as the uncontested regent de facto the entire tenure of the regency, \\"only seldom disturbed by other influences or any personal will of charles\\". The unexpectedly mild sentences of the involved in the regicide of Gustav III attracted attention. In 1794 the discovery of the Armfelt Conspiracy exposed the opposition of the Gustavian Party. The marriage negotiations of the young king disturbed the relationship to Russia, and the alliance with revolutionary France was greatly disliked by other powers. On the coming of age of Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden in November 1796, the duke's regency ended. His relationship to Gustav IV Adolf was cordial though never close, and he was not entrusted with much responsibility during the rule of his nephew. In 1797 and 1798, he and his consort had their first children, though in neither case the child lived. After this, the Duke and Duchess made a journey through Germany and Austria in 1798-99. In 1803, the Boheman affair caused a severe conflict between Gustav IV Adolf and the ducal couple. The mystic Karl Adolf Boheman (1764‚Äì1831) had been introduced to the couple by Count Magnus Stenbock in 1793 and gained great influence by promising to reveal scientific secrets about the occult. Boheman inducted them into a secret society Yellow Rose in 1801, where both sexes where accepted as members, and to which the Counts and Countesses Ruuth and Brahe as well as the mother of the queen were introduced. Boheman was arrested upon an attempt to recruit the monarch, who accused him of revolutionary agendas and expelled him. The ducal couple were exposed in an informal investigation by the monarch, and the duchess was questioned in the presence of the royal council. In 1808, Charles was again chief commander during Gustav IV Adolf's stay in Finland. He is presumed to have been, if not involved, aware of the plans to depose Gustav IV Adolf in 1809. He kept passive during the Coup of 1809, and accepted the post of regent from the victorious party after having assured himself that the deposed monarch was not in mortal danger. Charles was initially not willing to accept the crown, however, out of consideration for the former king's son. Reign The elderly King Carl XIII On 13 March 1809, those who had dethroned Gustav IV Adolf appointed Charles regent, and he was finally elected king by the Riksdag of the Estates. By the time he became king, he was 60 years old and prematurely decrepit. In November 1809, he was affected by a heart attack, and was not able to participate in government. The new constitution which was introduced also made his involvement in politics difficult. A planned attempt to enlarge the royal power in 1809‚Äì10 was not put into effect because of his indecisiveness and health condition. His incapacity triggered a search for a suitable heir. The initial choice was a Danish prince, Christian August, who took the name Charles August upon being adopted by Charles. However, Charles August died only a few months after his arrival in Sweden. One of Napoleon's generals, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, was then chosen as his successor. The new crown prince took over the government as soon as he landed in Sweden in 1810. Charles' condition deteriorated every year, especially after 1812, and he eventually became but a mute witness during the government councils chaired by the crown prince, having lost his memory and no longer being able to communicate. By the Union of Sweden and Norway on 4 November 1814 Charles became king of Norway under the name Carl II of Norway. After eight years as king only by title, Charles died without a natural heir on 5 February 1818, and Bernadotte succeeded him as King Charles XIV John.Halvdan Koht: biografi (Karl XIII), i NBL1, bd. 7, 1936 Charles was the 872nd Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Spain.

It is a suburb of Birmingham, located on the other side of Red Mountain due south of the city center. As of the 2010 census its population was 25,167, and in 2019 the estimated population was 25,377.  History  = Early history and development = The first settlers of the area which would eventually become Homewood arrived in the early 1800s. The area's population, however, did not grow significantly until Birmingham suffered a major cholera epidemic in 1873 (See Timeline of Birmingham, Alabama). Speculators soon began buying up land and developing communities in the countryside surrounding Birmingham. Many of the smaller communities which would eventually become Homewood were developed during this time period, including Rosedale, Grove Park, Edgewood, and Oak Grove. Edgewood saw the greatest amount of development. The community contained an Electric Railway leading to downtown Birmingham by 1911 and a man-made lake by 1915. The lake was created by the construction of a dam along Shades Creek near Columbiana Road. Two parallel roads were graded on either side of the lake with the intention of creating a race track around the lake, however these plans never came to fruition. The roads eventually became Lakeshore Drive and South Lakeshore Drive. = Incorporation = In 1926, a local attorney named Charles Rice started a movement to merge several of the communities surrounding Birmingham. In September of the same year, Rosedale, Edgewood, and Grove Park voted to incorporate under the name Homewood. The city of Hollywood, Alabama was annexed into Homewood in 1929. In 1955, Oak Grove was also annexed into Homewood. = Great Depression and World War II = The Great Depression and a polio epidemic, which sickened 80 children in Homewood, greatly damaged Homewood's economy and social landscape. The regional economy picked up after the outbreak of World War II and the accompanying steel boom in Birmingham, where production ramped up in order to contribute to the war effort. During the 1940s, Homewood's police and fire departments doubled in size to accommodate a 73.9 percent increase in the city's population from 1940 to 1950. = Civil rights era = In 1959, Homewood voters defeated a move by Birmingham to annex the city. A second attempt supposedly succeeded in July 1964, but voting irregularities and lawsuits prevented the outcome of that election in the courts until September 9, 1966, when the Alabama Supreme Court ruled the 1964 vote null and void (See \\"City of Birmingham v. Bouldin\\"). In a special election on December 13, 1966, a vote for annexation failed with 65 percent of Homewood residents voting against the annexation. Homewood avoided the worst of the turmoil associated with the Civil Rights Movement and, more specifically, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's 1963 Birmingham campaign. However, in September 1963, the Shades Valley Sun newspaper reported on a racially motivated bombing on Central Avenue in Rosedale. In 1970, Homewood created its own school system, breaking away from the Jefferson County school system. The new Homewood High School opened in December 1972. =Hollywood= Hollywood is a former town annexed into Homewood, Alabama, in 1929. A historic district of much of the area is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Hollywood Historic District. The district is roughly bounded by U.S. Highway 31, U.S. Highway 280, and Lakeshore Drive and is significant for the Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style of surviving houses and other buildings. See also: Clyde Nelson began developing Hollywood Boulevard as a residential subdivision in 1926. He employed a sales force of 75, armed with the memorable slogan \\"Out of the Smoke Zone, Into the Ozone\\", to entice Birmingham residents over Red Mountain. Architect George P. Turner designed many of the new homes in the Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, which had become fashionably linked with the glamour of Hollywood, California in the early days of the motion picture industry there. Turner also nodded to the English Tudor style which was already widespread in Birmingham and over the mountain. The Hollywood Country Club on Lakeshore Drive (destroyed in 1984 by fire) and the American Legion Post 134 (originally Hollywood's Town Hall) were also built at this time. In order to support his new development, Nelson created the area's first autobus line and extended the first natural gas pipeline into Shades Valley. Hollywood incorporated as a town on January 14, 1927 with Clarence Lloyd as its first and only mayor. The town was annexed into Homewood on October 14, 1929. The Great Depression virtually ended development of the subdivision. In 2002, the Hollywood Historic District was registered with the National Register of Historic Places, and is home to The American Institute of Architects (AIA)-nominated houses like 11 Bonita Drive. The listing includes 412 contributing buildings and one contributing site, over a area. Geography Homewood is located at (33.468306, -86.808146).

At this time, the settlement was known as Kennelsville. The city then became known as Jefferson, probably after the nearby Old Jefferson coal mine, until the late 1880s. In 1888, the town's post office was relocated to nearby Morris. In 1905, the town voted to change its name to Kimberly because another Alabama town had already claimed the name Jefferson. The town had a population of around 900 by 1910. Local coal mines were primary employers in Kimberly and were active through the 1940s, gradually closing down during the 1950s. Another significant employer in Kimberly was the Dixie Firebrick Company, founded in the 1930s; it was later bought out by A.P. Green Refractories Company.

History =History= The War of 1812, geography, geology, and three cultures shaped the history of Leeds. Lying at the crossroads of ancient Native-American paths in the center of Alabama, Leeds drew European and African-American settlers to a land of fertile growing seasons and rich sources of coal and mineral ore. The early settlers built churches and schools with many remaining in Cedar Grove, Oak Ridge, Ohanafeefee and Mt. Pleasant. The principal survey of Leeds was entered into Jefferson County Map Book 10, page 21, in 1908. The settlement, dating to 1818 and incorporating on April 27, 1887 as \\"Leeds\\", has existed along the banks of the Little Cahaba River; beside an historic stagecoach route; and along two large railroads for the greater part of American History.content work of The Alabama Tourism Department and the City of Leeds, September 2010 James Hamilton, a Scottish- Irish American veteran of the War of 1812 and first sheriff of Shelby County, settled in Cedar Grove in 1816. John Richard Ingram Pashal Stewart, a Cherokee English teacher and American veteran of the War of 1812, settled at Ohanafeefee Village c.1840. At Oak Ridge in 1820 or 1821, European settlers formed Shiloh Cumberland Presbyterian Church, the first CPC congregation in middle Alabama. By 1887, the original railroad pioneers included free African- American settlers who came to work at the Leeds cement plant and the Central of Georgia as the Georgia Pacific railroads. Some gravitated to historic Mt. Pleasant Church where a handful of freed slaves had founded Scott City, Hillard Holley, Ciscero Davis, Jeff Harris, and Bill Johnson started Leeds Negro/Primary School in 1921. =Folklore= The tale of John Henry was believed to have originated in Leeds. In this folk story, John Henry, the \\"steel-drivin' man\\", raced and won against a steam engine in the laying of railroad that penetrated the Oak Mountain Tunnel in Leeds. Retired chemistry professor and folklorist John Garst, of the University of Georgia, has argued that the contest happened at the Coosa Mountain Tunnel or the Oak Mountain Tunnel of the Columbus and Western Railway (now part of Norfolk Southern Railway) in Leeds on September 20, 1887. Based on documentation that corresponds with the account of C.C. Spencer, who claimed in the 1920s to have witnessed the contest, Garst speculates that John Henry may have been a man named Henry who was born a slave to P.A.L. Dabney, the father of the chief engineer of that railroad, in 1850. Since 2007, the city of Leeds has honored John Henry's legend during an annual festival held on the third weekend in September, the Leeds Downtown Folk Festival & John Henry Celebration.\\"Free Leeds Downtown Folk Festival is Saturday & Sunday\\", Christie Dedman -- The Birmingham News The Birmingham News, September 15, 2011 \\"John Henry in Leeds\\" , Leeds Folk Festival Geography Leeds is located at (33.545592, -86.557388), primarily within Jefferson County.

History The city of Lipscomb was first incorporated on June 30, 1910, and was named for L. Y. Lipscomb, one of three brothers who first settled in the area in 1885. As early as the 1880s, the community was called Wheeling and the town had 200-300 residents by 1906. The community was originally named after Wheeling, West Virginia because the owners of Woodward Iron Company, who employed many of the residents, also had business interests in that state. Y. L. Lipscomb ran a general store on the old South Bessemer car line which opened in 1890, though the first settlers actually came to the area in the 1830s, when Vincent Loveless established his farm in the area. The first church was established in the area in June, 1834 when a log structure was built named Union Baptist Church which sat on the site of the present church.The Birmingham District, An Industrial History and Guide, page 209, published 1981, Marjorie L.

The land for the school was donated by the Young family. The location was at the center of the coal communities of Bayview, Brookside, Docena, Edgewater and Mulga and other and later communities (Adamsville, Alden, Coalburg, Crumly Chapel, Forestdale, Fieldstown, Graysville, Hillview, Maytown, McDonald Chapel, Midway, Mineral Springs, Republic, Sandusky and Sylvan Springs). The school burned down in 1926 and rebuilt and reopened in 1928. W. C. Petty was named principal in 1922 and served through May 1958. The building served as the high school through May 1988 when a new high school was built in Adamsville. In the 1960s, Minor Christian School was established on McDonald Chapel Road.  Economy  Over the years, a few businesses were established: * Minor Grocery (owner Grace Houk) * Powell/Motley Grocery * Top Hat Inn, a night club * Donaldson Filling Station * Minor Ice Cream Bar, started by the Blevins family and later operated by Tommy and Jones Pender, the Marshman's, the Alexander's and Mr. and Mrs. Floyd * Anthony/Gardner/Lucas Bus Lines * Lindley Plumbing & Heating Co. (1960 to 2001) * Stowe Florist * Reach's Hair Salon * Pit Stop gas station * Jones Florist * Rankin's TV Repair and Stouts Watch Repair At the fork of Mulga Loop Road and Docena Road (later changed to Minor Parkway) stood Pete's and Bud's Bar-B-que and later a Shell service station. Frank Baker built a service station across the road that was demolished to build a highway. Tillman's service station was up the road toward Ensley and later became Plunkett's Bar-B-Que. Still later, Charlie's (a nightclub) was built near Docena Road and Birmingport. A small stripmall was built on Birmingport Road by the Echert's. It had a Shell service station, a restaurant and a convenience store. Later, all but the gas station portion burned down. By 2017, only the Pit Stop was in business.

Its population at the 2010 census was 20,413. It is one of the state's most affluent places. History The city was originally developed in 1929 by real-estate businessman Robert Jemison, Jr., as an extensive residential subdivision along the ridges known as Red Mountain and Shades Mountain. It was incorporated on May 24, 1942. The plans, by Boston-based landscape architect Warren H. Manning, called for estate-sized lots along winding scenic roads and denser commercial development centering on three picturesque \\"villages\\": English Village, Mountain Brook Village and Crestline Village. Most of Mountain Brook's development preserved the existing trees: 92.03% is under tree cover, one of the highest ratios in the nation. Residential sections such as Cherokee Bend, Brookwood Forest, Overton, and Crestline have houses in a forest setting, with a recreational network of bridle paths. This has protected the area from urban encroachment. Mountain Brook is the location of the first office park in the U.S., built in 1955. It featured the then novel concepts of ample free parking and low-profile office buildings surrounded by waterspouts and landscaped grounds. A new city hall, including a fire and police station, was completed in 2013. Geography The city is located at (33.486972, ‚àí86.740465).

It is part of the Birmingham metropolitan area. Its nickname is \\"The Good Neighbor City\\". At the 2010 census the population was 10,110. History It was established in 1889, but incorporated as a city in January 1937. The incorporation came about by reason of a rather unusual circumstance. The town sits on land honeycombed by coal mines. For many years, the residents had relied on water wells for their water supply. As years passed and more mining was done, Pleasant Grove found itself confronted with a problem. Residents would sometimes go to their well to draw water only to find there was none. The water had gone into the mines. During the mid to late 1930s, the Federal Government had a program for financing the building of local water systems. In exploring the possibility of securing such funds, it was revealed that in order to secure such financing a community must be legally incorporated. At this time the incorporation became a reality. The first appointed Mayor of Pleasant Grove was W.P. Stone. The city is governed by a mayor and five council members who serve four-year terms. Elections for city officials is held during the summer of each leap year with four-year terms beginning the first Monday in October. The area known as Pleasant Grove, Alabama was first homesteaded in September 1836. Pleasant Grove is in Jefferson County. Although no one seems to know when or exactly how the town came by its name, old documents indicate that at least part of this area was called Pleasant Grove as early as 1884. Pleasant Grove was made up of four communities which included Frog Pond, Lizard Ridge, Cottage Hill, and Pleasant Grove. The city was damaged by large tornadoes in 1956, 1977, 1998, and 2011. Government The city is governed by a mayor, currently Jerry Brasseale, and five-member council. All city officials are elected to four-year terms on leap years. The council meets the first and third Monday of each month at Pleasant Grove City Hall. Council members as of the 2008 election are James Mosely, William Bullion, Terrie Hicks, Philip Houston and Paula Johnson. Geography Pleasant Grove is located at .

Education Pleasant Grove Schools are operated by the Jefferson County Board of Education. Land was originally given to the Board of Education and a gift of $150,000 toward the construction of a Junior High School. In 1970, Pleasant Grove High School was built. It combined with the Junior High School. The schools were accredited by the State of Alabama in May 1973. It agreed to give the Board of Education $1,000,000.00 over a ten- year period to add onto the existing Elementary School and get all of the children K-6 under one roof. In January 1997, students who formerly attended Woodward School were relocated to the city. Construction of a new Pleasant Grove High School was completed in 2010.http://www.al.com/news/birminghamnews/west.ssf?/base/community/1239783496156670.xml&coll;=2 Pleasant Grove High School has the highest graduation rate in the Jefferson County School system.

It is a suburb of Birmingham and part of the Birmingham-Hoover Metropolitan Statistical Area. Its population at the 2010 census was 19,933.  Geography  Trussville is located at (33.621623, -86.596404). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.27%) is water. History = Early settlement = The first European settler to establish residence in the area was Warren Truss, who entered the area with his brothers and constructed a grist mill on the Cahaba River in 1821. Truss was a North Carolina man of English descent.Trussville, Alabama: A Brief History By Gary Lloyd page 11 Trussville remained an agricultural community until after the Civil War, when the Alabama-Chattanooga Railway was built through the city. By 1886 a blast furnace was built on what is now the site of the new Cahaba Elementary School. Trussville was listed as an incorporated community on the 1890http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1890a_v1-07.pdf and 1900http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/33405927v1ch05.pdf U.S. Census rolls. At some point after 1900 until its reincorporation in 1947, it did not appear on census records. = Cahaba Project = Much of Trussville's growth and development came from the Cahaba Project, a planned development of over 250 homes constructed by Franklin D. Roosevelt's Government Resettlement Administration during the 1930s. The Cahaba Project was originally planned by staff at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute to be a rural community of small farmsteads raising potatoes and vegetables. By the middle of the decade it was decided to locate the community close enough to Birmingham to commute by public transit, so the site in Trussville was chosen. About 60 existing houses were demolished, with white residents moved to the Roper Hill community and cottages for African-Americans built on a 40-acre tract northwest of the Cahaba Project called \\"Washington Heights\\" or, more commonly, \\"The Forties\\". Local landscape architect W. H. Kestler designed a relatively dense suburban layout with 400 houses on 1/2 to 3/4 acre lots encircling a central green space called \\"The Mall\\". The design was approved in 1936 and constructed over the following two years. In all, 243 single-family houses and 44 duplexes were constructed at a total cost of $2,661,981.26. They were rented to approved lower-middle-income families for $14-$23 per month. The village featured paved streets, sidewalks and landscaped park areas. An entrance gateway with a covered gazebo was built at the corner of Main Street and Parkway Drive to serve as the community's \\"front door\\". Most of the one- and two-level homes were constructed in the American four-square style with brick and wood siding, pine floors and metal roofs. Each house had electricity, hot-and-cold running water, and a sewer connection. Two oak saplings were given to each household to beautify their yards. During World War II many families planted Victory Gardens to supplement their grocery rations. Oak furnishings and appliances were also available to renters at a nominal cost from the government. A back porch was supplied with a hose for a wringer-type washer. A communal washer was also available in a separate building on the mall. Other community facilities included a swimming pool, an elementary school and a high school, all built near the mall. A co-op store was erected near the high school, serving as a general store and lending library. Several churches were founded, including the Holy Infant of Prague Catholic Church. The Cahaba Association, the Village residents' organization, elected community leaders, raised funds for civic projects, and published the Cahaba Hub newspaper. Many residents participated in an amateur softball league which made use of a lighted field on the mall. Resentment over the privileges given to residents of the government-funded Cahaba Project resulted in tensions between them and the \\"Old Trussville\\" families, many of whom lacked electricity and indoor plumbing. The presence of so many community facilities within the project limited interactions between the project's residents and their neighbors. After World War II the government made plans to sell the houses to residents. It also offered undeveloped parcels for sale, giving veterans the first option at 10 percent down. The Cahaba Project was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. = Incorporation and growth = On June 10, 1947, Trussville was incorporated as a town, and on May 31, 1957, the town officially became a city. It was on this date the City of Trussville was adopted as the official name. Today Trussville is one of the Birmingham region's most rapidly growing areas. In the 30-year period between 1980 and 2010, the city grew by over 500%. It has seen much residential and retail construction, with two major shopping centers built during the early 2000s: the Colonial Promenade at Trussville on its western side and both the Colonial Promenade Tutwiler Farm and Pinnacle at Tutwiler Farm along Highway 11 at the I-59/I-459 interchange.  Demographics  In 2010 the United States Census Bureau listed the Trussville population as 19,993, making it one of the fastest growing cities in Jefferson County and Alabama.

In 2004, the city council passed a resolution that created the Trussville Board of Education, and in 2005, Trussville City Schools officially separated from the Jefferson County School System. The system consists of five schools: * Cahaba Elementary School (grades K-5) * Hewitt-Trussville High School (grades 9-12) * Hewitt-Trussville Middle School (grades 6-8) * Magnolia Elementary School (grades K-5) * Paine Elementary School (grades K-5)  Economy  The 2014 median family income was $94,875, with 1.1% of families living below the poverty line.

It is a suburb of Birmingham and it is made up of Vestavia, Liberty Park, and Cahaba Heights. As of the 2010 census, its population was 34,033, up from 24,476 in 2000. It moved up from the fifth largest city in Jefferson County in 2000https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/phc-1-2.pdf to the third largest in 2010, behind Birmingham and Hoover.https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-1-2.pdf History Sibyl Temple Vestavia Hills is named for the estate of former Birmingham mayor George B. Ward. It was situated on the crest of Shades Mountain in what is now the northern edge of the city. Ward's mansion at the Vestavia estate became a landmark in the area as soon as it was completed in 1925. The -story house was patterned after the circular Temple of Vesta in Rome, with dark pink sandstone walls encircled by 20 massive white Doric columns surmounted by a carved entablature. The extensive gardens, populated by statuary and peacocks, surrounded a smaller domed gazebo patterned after the Temple of Sibyl in Tivoli. After Ward's death, the house, something of a tourist stop near the highway between Birmingham and Montgomery, was used as a tearoom and reception hall before being purchased by Vestavia Hills Baptist Church. The church met in the temple like structure for several years before demolishing a portion of the building in 1971 to make way for a larger building; a central portion of the original building remains. The local garden club moved the gazebo to a prominent outcropping closer to the highway, there to serve as a landmark gateway into the community. The development of Vestavia Hills as a residential suburb began in 1946, when developer Charles Byrd planned a subdivision for approximately 1,000 people on the southern flank of Shades Mountain. The suburb was incorporated as a separate city on November 8, 1950, and has since grown, by rapid development and annexation, into a thriving small city of over 34,000 by 2010.

Highway 72 helps connect the city to Huntsville and Chattanooga, Tennessee to the east and Memphis, Tennessee to the west. Interstate 65 is accessible about forty-five minutes east on Highway 72. Both of these roads cross the Tennessee River on O'Neal Bridge, connecting Florence to Sheffield. Alabama state highways that serve the city include State Route 13, State Route 17, State Route 20, State Route 133, and State Route 157. Alabama 133 connected Florence and Muscle Shoals via Wilson Dam until 2002, when the new six-lane \\"Patton Island Bridge\\" finished construction. The bridge is part of a new corridor that will eventually see the widening of Wilson Dam Road in Muscle Shoals to Alabama 20, and the construction of a new road from the bridge to Florence Blvd. in Florence. State Route 157, a road to Florence and the Shoals area, serves as a four-lane link to Interstate 65 in Cullman. the project was completed in the summer of 2007. The road is known as the \\"University of North Alabama Highway\\". Florence and the Shoals area does not have a direct link to an Interstate highway. One solution discussed has been the Memphis to Atlanta Highway, proposed to connect the two cities via a freeway through north Alabama. However, in recent years Mississippi has concentrated its funding on U.S. 78 (Interstate 22), also known as \\"Corridor X\\". Though U.S. 72 through Mississippi is four lanes, there are no plans to upgrade it to freeway status. The state of Georgia has also not committed to the necessary work to connect the freeway from the Alabama state line to Atlanta. The highway remains in the planning stages with the Alabama Department of Transportation. Another plan recently discussed is extending Interstate 565 west from its current terminus just outside Decatur, along Alabama 20/Alternate U.S. 72. The plan has received support from Decatur officials. Florence is served by the Northwest Alabama Regional Airport in Muscle Shoals. The airport is used for commercial and general aviation, It is served commercially by Boutique Air which provides several daily flights to Atlanta and Nashville. Huntsville International Airport, another option for Florence residents, offers service to eleven domestic destinations, and is an hour's drive from Florence.

Their land eventually became what is now the downtown business district.McDonald, William L. Rogersville Played Key Role in Settlement of Lauderdale County, TimesDaily (August 3, 2003), p. 18G When the Rogersville Post Office was established on October 4, 1825 with Thomas Cunningham as the postmaster, the 'd' was dropped from the town's name and it has been known as Rogersville ever since. The town became a popular trading center due in part to its location near the intersection of three early thoroughfares, U.S. 72, Snake Road and Lamb's Ferry Road. U.S. 72, which now connects Chattanooga and Memphis, Tennessee, was once part of an Indian trail from Ditto's Landing on the Tennessee River south of Huntsville and was used to bypass the Muscle Shoals river barrier. Snake Road leads out of Rogersville into neighboring Limestone County and provided passage from Florence to Athens by way of a shallow ford across Elk River. Lamb's Ferry Road was named for John Lamb who moved from Indian Creek in Giles County, Tennessee in 1816 to establish a ferry across the Tennessee River south of what would later become Rogersville. Lamb's Ferry became an important river port where boats from Knoxville and other points on the upper Tennessee River would unload supplies that were taken over land to areas around Pulaski, TN.McDonald, William L.

He was the son of Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp, Prince of Eutin, and Albertina Frederica of Baden-Durlach. The first king from the House of Holstein-Gottorp, Adolf Frederick, was a weak monarch, instated as first in line to the throne following the parliamentary government's failure to reconquer the Baltic provinces in 1741‚Äì43. Aside from a few attempts, supported by pro-absolutist factions among the nobility, to reclaim the absolute monarchy held by previous monarchs, he remained a mere constitutional figurehead until his death. His reign saw an extended period of internal peace. However, the finances stagnated following failed mercantilist doctrines pursued by the Hat administration. The Hat Administration ended during the 1765‚Äì66 parliament, where the Cap opposition overtook the government and enacted reforms towards greater economic liberalism as well as a Freedom of Press Act. The Freedom of Press Act is unique for the time for its curtailing of all censorship, retaining punitive measures only for libelling the monarch or the Church of Sweden. Ancestry His father was Christian Augustus (1673-1726) duke and a younger prince of Schleswig- Holstein-Gottorp, prince-bishop of L√ºbeck, and administrator, during the Great Northern War, of the duchies of Holstein-Gottorp for his relative Charles Frederick.

On his mother's side, Adolf Frederick descended from King Gustav Vasa and Christina Magdalena, a sister of Charles X of Sweden. Reign Adolf Frederick in old age as King, by Lorens Pasch the Younger From 1727 to 1750 Prince Adolf Frederick was the prince-bishop of L√ºbeck. This meant he ruled a fief around and including Eutin. After his first cousin, Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, died in 1739, Adolf Frederick became the administrator of Holstein-Kiel during the minority of the duke's orphan son, Charles Peter Ulrich. Shortly afterward, the young boy was invited to Russia by his maternal aunt, Empress Elizabeth, who soon declared him her heir. He later became known as Peter III of Russia. In 1743, Adolf Frederick was elected heir to the throne of Sweden by the Hat faction (Swedish: Hattarna). The Hat faction wanted to obtain better conditions at the Treaty of √Öbo from Empress Elizabeth of Russia, who had adopted his nephew as her heir. He succeeded as King Adolf Frederick 12 years later on 25 March 1751. During his 20 reign, Adolf Frederick was little more than a figurehead, the real power being with the Riksdag of the Estates, often distracted by party strife. Twice he endeavoured to free himself from the tutelage of the estates. The first occasion was in 1756. Stimulated by his consort Louisa Ulrika of Prussia (sister of Frederick the Great), he tried to regain a portion of the attenuated prerogative through the Coup of 1756 to abolish the rule of the Riksdag of the Estates and reinstate absolute monarchy in Sweden. He nearly lost his throne in consequence. On the second occasion during the December Crisis (1768), under the guidance of his eldest son, Gustav, he succeeded in overthrowing the \\"Cap\\" (Swedish: M√∂ssorna) senate, but was unable to make any use of his victory. =Death= Adolf Frederick died in Stockholm on 12 February 1771 after having consumed a large meal, consisting of lobster, caviar, sauerkraut, kippers and champagne, topped off with 14 servings of his favourite dessert: hetv√§gg, made of semla pastries served in bowls of hot milk.The lowdown on Sweden's best buns The Local, February 2007 Following his death, his son Gustav III seized power in 1772 in a military coup d'√©tat, reinstating absolute rule. Legacy The King was regarded as dependent on others, a weak ruler, and lacking of any talents. However, he was allegedly a good husband, a caring father, and a gentle master to his servants. His favourite pastime was to make snuffboxes, which he allegedly spent a great deal of time doing. His hospitality and friendliness were witnessed by many who deeply mourned him at his death. Children By his marriage to Princess Louisa Ulrika of Prussia (which took place on 18 August/29 August 1744 in Drottningholm), he had the following children: #(Stillborn) (18 February 1745 in Stockholm) #Gustav III (1746‚Äì1792) #Charles XIII (1748‚Äì1818) #Frederick Adolf (1750‚Äì1803) #Sofia Albertina (1753‚Äì1829) With Jeanne Du Londel he had one son: # Adolf Fredriksson (c. 1734-1771), Captain in the Swedish Army.Rainer, Claes (2019).

The creek was named for a Cherokee chief who lived in the area when the first European settlers arrived. The current town is reportedly located on the site of the Native American village. Courtland began as a small settlement known as Ebenezer in the early 1800s. Its early settlers were wealthy planters mostly from Virginia, Tennessee, the Carolinas and Georgia. It was presently named for the federal courthouse and land office there.

One of the South's earliest railroads, the Tuscumbia, Courtland and Decatur Railroad, was organized at Courtland in 1831, and chartered the following year. The railroad's organizers routed the railroad to bypass the dangerous shoals along the Tennessee River to the north. The railroad was absorbed by the Memphis and Charleston Railroad in the 1850s, and later became part of the Southern Railway. In 1835, Courtland physician Jack Shackelford organized a volunteer military unit to fight in the Texas Revolution. Known as the \\"Red Rovers\\" for the color of their uniforms, the company was captured by Mexican forces at Coleto in March 1836, and most of its men were killed in the Goliad massacre. Shackelford was among the few survivors.Alabama Historical Association, \\"The Red Rovers\\" historical marker on the Town Square in Courtland, 1964.

Auburn is a city in Lee County, Alabama, United States. It is the largest city in eastern Alabama with a 2019 population of 66,259. It is a principal city of the Auburn-Opelika Metropolitan Area. The Auburn-Opelika, AL MSA with a population of 158,991, along with the Columbus, GA-AL MSA and Tuskegee, Alabama, comprises the greater Columbus-Auburn-Opelika, GA-AL CSA, a region home to 501,649 residents. Auburn is a historic college town and is the home of Auburn University. It is Alabama's fastest-growing metropolitan area and the nineteenth fastest-growing metro area in the United States since 1990. U.S. News ranked Auburn among its top ten list of best places to live in the United States for the year 2009. The city's unofficial nickname is \\"The Loveliest Village On The Plains,\\" taken from a line in the poem The Deserted Village by Oliver Goldsmith: \\"Sweet Auburn! Loveliest village of the plain...\\" History Inhabited in antiquity by the Creek, the land on which Auburn sits was opened to settlement in 1832 with the Treaty of Cusseta. The first settlers arrived in the winter of 1836 from Harris County, Georgia. These settlers, led by Judge John J. Harper, intended to build a town that would be the religious and educational center for the area. Auburn was incorporated on February 2, 1839, in what was then Macon County, covering an area of . By that time, Methodist and Baptist churches had been established, and a school had been built and had come into operation. In the mid-1840s, separate academies for boys and girls were established in addition to the primary school. This concentration of educational institutions led to a rapid influx of families from the planter class into Auburn in the 1840s and 1850s. By 1858, of the roughly 1,000 free residents of Auburn, some 500 were students. In 1856, the state legislature chartered a Methodist college, the East Alabama Male College in Auburn. This college, now Auburn University, opened its doors in 1859, offering a classical and liberal education. With the advent of the Civil War in 1861, Auburn quickly emptied. All of the schools closed, and most businesses shuttered. Auburn was the site of a hospital for Texan Confederate soldiers, but only saw direct combat with the raids of Rousseau in 1864 and Wilson in 1865. After the Civil War, Auburn's economy entered a prolonged depression that would last the remainder of the century. Public schools did not reopen until the mid-1870s, and most businesses remained closed. A series of fires in the 1860s and 1870s gutted the downtown area. East Alabama Male College was turned over to the state in 1872, and with funds from the federal Morrill Act was renamed Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College with a new mission as a land grant college. Passage of the Hatch Act in 1887 allowed for expansion of agricultural research facilities on campus. In 1892, the college became the first four-year college in Alabama to admit women. This, combined with increased interest in scientific agriculture and engineering and new funding from business licenses, allowed the city to start expanding again. By 1910, Auburn's population had returned to its antebellum level. SIAA Conference championships won by the Auburn college's football team brought attention and support to Auburn, and helped fill the city's coffers. Fortunes were quickly reversed with the collapse of cotton prices in the early 1920s and the subsequent Great Depression a decade later. Due to these events, the state government became unable to fund the college, and--as Auburn's economy was completely derived from the college--residents were forced into a barter economy to support themselves. Money began to flow into Auburn again with America's entry into World War II. Auburn's campus was turned into a training ground for technical specialists in the armed forces. After the war, Auburn was flooded by soldiers returning to school on the G.I. Bill. Primarily due to this influx of students, Auburn began a period of growth that lasted through the 1950s and 1960s. A considerable amount of residential and business construction pushed Auburn's growth outside of the original boundaries of the city, leading to a series of large annexations which expanded Auburn to nearly . Construction of Interstate 85 beginning in 1957 connected Auburn to the major cities of the state. This allowed for Auburn University (renamed in 1960) to schedule more home football games in Auburn rather than in larger cities, creating a strong tourism component in Auburn's economy. Auburn Mall opened as \\"Village Mall\\" in 1973. Growth slowed somewhat in the 1970s, and a series of budget cuts made it clear that Auburn's sole economic reliance on Auburn University put the city in a tenuous position. Backlash against what was seen as an ineffectual city council led to the election of Jan Dempsey as mayor in 1980 and the removal of the previous city government system in favor of a council-manager system. With a new government in place, the city began aggressively pursuing industry, leading to a nearly 1,200% increase in the number of industrial jobs over the next twenty years. As public satisfaction with the city administration reached record levels, Auburn began very rapid residential growth. Historic Noble Hall, Auburn, Alabama A series of reports in the 1980s and 1990s ranking the Auburn public school system among the top in the state and nation convinced thousands of new residents to move to Auburn over the past 25 years. Between 1980 and 2003, Auburn's population grew by 65%, and Auburn's economy expanded by 220%. With growth came issues of urban sprawl, which has become the primary political issue in Auburn at the turn of the 21st century. Geography A creek flowing through Chewacla State Park in Auburn. The city of Auburn lies in western Lee County and is bordered by the city of Opelika to the northeast and by Chambers County to the north. The city stretches south to the Macon County line in the southwest. Auburn sits on the Fall Line at the juncture of the piedmont plateau and the coastal plain. Portions of Auburn also include the southernmost exposure of rocks indicating the Appalachian orogeny‚Äîas such, the last foothill of the Appalachian Mountains lies in Chewacla State Park in southern Auburn. As a result of these three varied physical environments, Auburn has an extremely diverse geology. The southwest and west regions of the city on the plateau are marked by rolling plains and savannahs, with the undeveloped portion primarily being used for cattle grazing and ranching. South of this region sits the coastal plain, with sandy soil and pine forest. Parts of north Auburn have much more rugged topographies, with thick forests in high hills and deep hollows of the type common to parts of eastern Tennessee. The region surrounded by Chewacla Park in the south of the city contains sharp peaks and sudden drops of elevation as the 1.05 billion-year-old rock of the Appalachians meets the coastal plain. Auburn sits near the divide between the Chattahoochee and Tallapoosa River watersheds. Auburn is drained by three main creek systems: in the south, by the Chewacla/Opintlocco Creek system; in the north, by the Saugahatchee Creek system; and in the extreme northern reaches of Auburn by Sandy Creek. The dividing line between the Chewacla and Saugahatchee watersheds roughly follows railroad line east‚Äìwest through the center of town. Auburn is located at (32.597684, ‚àí85.480823) and according to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2000, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (1.11%) is water. The elevation of Auburn at City Hall is above sea level; though due to Auburn's diverse topography, elevation ranges from above sea level where Chewacla Creek crosses Sand Hill Road to above sea level in northern Auburn near the Chambers County line. =Climate= Typical of the Deep South, Auburn has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen Cfa), marked by mild winters, early springs, long, hot, muggy summers, and warm autumns. Due to its position near the Gulf of Mexico, the city receives a significant amount of rainfall‚Äîon average, per year--though there is a distinct dry season in the late summer and early fall. Severe storm activity - thunderstorms producing damaging winds and/or large hail - is common from the late winter through early summer. There is the risk of tornadoes. Owing to its proximity to the Gulf, Auburn is also subject to fringe effects from tropical storms and hurricanes in the summer and fall. Hurricanes Opal in 1995 and Ivan in 2004 are among two of the most notable tropical systems to affect the Auburn area in recent memory, bringing torrential rains and high winds. Winters are typically mild, with an average of snowfall, though more than three-fourths of all seasons do not have any measurable snow. Most days have + highs, and from December to February, an average total of 10-11 days of + highs, while it rarely stays below freezing all day. However, the city straddles the border between USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 7B and 8A, and there are an average of 5.6 nights with sub- lows. On the other end, summers are long, hot, and humid, with 57 days of + highs. Although the actual air temperature reaching is uncommon (1.2 days annually), high humidity can push daytime heat indices over that mark. The record high for Auburn is , set on July 15, 1980 (needs updating), and August 10, 1980, while the record low was , set on February 13, 1899, and January 21, 1985.

Auburn Precinct/Division (1870-1970) The Auburn Beat (Lee County 2nd Beat) first appeared on the 1870 U.S. Census. In 1890, \\"beat\\" was changed to \\"precinct.\\" In 1870, 1930 and 1940 when racial demographics were reported, it showed a Black majority. In 1960, the precinct was changed to \\"census division\\" as part of a general reorganization of counties.http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37721510v1p2ch2.pdf, 1960 AL Census The city boundaries and that of the census division were contiguous by that census. In 1980, the census divisions of Auburn and Opelika, along with parts of Loachapoka-Roxana, Opelika Rural-Pepperell were consolidated into the new division of Auburn- Opelika.http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1980a_alABC-01.pdf, 1980 AL Census Auburn-Opelika Census Division (1980-) The Auburn-Opelika Census Division was created in 1980 by the merger of Auburn and Opelika census divisions and parts of Loachapoka-Roxana, Opelika Rural-Pepperell divisions.

Recreational opportunities in Auburn include 16 parks, highlighted by Chewacla State Park, a park in the Appalachian foothills, Kiesel Park, a \\"passive\\" park with numerous trails, and the Louise Kreher Forest Ecology Preserve. The Donald E. Davis Arboretum showcases 150 different tree species native to Alabama and the Southeast. Auburn is also ringed by miles of multi-use trails and several lakes. Sports Auburn has no professional sports teams, but nonetheless has a vibrant sports culture due to the presence of Auburn University's NCAA Division I athletic squads. Auburn University football in particular is a major force in Auburn's culture and economy. When Auburn University has home football games in the fall, the city often sees over 100,000 visitors, and the yearly economic impact is measured at nearly $100 million. While other sports do not attract as many tourists to Auburn, the university's 17 varsity sports offer citizens a variety of other opportunities for viewing competition at virtually the highest level. Home football games particularly change the face of Auburn for several weekends a year. Tens of thousands of fans flood the campus hours--sometimes days--before the game to tailgate, creating a festival-like atmosphere throughout the weekend. Football games in Auburn are played in 87,451 seat Jordan‚ÄìHare Stadium, which sits on the main campus, just a few blocks from downtown. Basketball is played at 9,600-seat Auburn Arena, while baseball games are held at 4,096-seat Plainsman Park, which was named the top collegiate ballpark in the nation by Baseball America in 2003. One of Auburn's most competitive sports is the swimming program, which has won seven of the last nine NCAA national championships including the last five straight and 11 consecutive SEC men's championships. Also, the women's program have won five NCAA national titles and four SEC championships. The teams compete at the James E. Martin Aquatics Center. More Olympic swimmers have come from Auburn's swimming program than any other university swimming program. The Auburn Metro Area is home to 146 holes of golf at six courses, and has played host to several professional and amateur golf tournaments. Auburn Links was rated as one of the top three new courses in the nation when it opened in 1996, and the Robert Trent Jones-designed Grand National course in the Auburn metro is often cited as one of the top public courses in the nation. Because of this, in 2005, the Auburn Metro Area was ranked number 1 in the United States for golf by Golf Digest.

It is located less than 1/2 mile west of Auburn and approximately west of Auburn University, in west-central Lee County. The population was 180 as of the 2010 census. It is part of the Auburn metropolitan area. The name \\"Loachapoka\\" means \\"turtle killing place\\" in Muskogee, with locha meaning \\"turtle\\" and poga meaning \\"killing place.\\" In literature, Lochapoka was the destination of the colonists in James H. Street's 1940 novel Oh, Promised Land. Loachapoka is the location of the first Rosenwald School.  Government  Loachapoka is governed by a mayor and 5 town council members. However, in the most recent municipal election (2016), no incumbents submitted qualifying paperwork to run for re- election. Therefore, the only citizen that did qualify for the ballot became mayor-elect, as per state law, and this was confirmed by the AL Director of Elections. When the mayor-elect brought the issue to light, several town, county and state officials worked together in a poorly hatched plan to improperly disqualify the only candidate to follow the law for qualification, as referenced in several newspaper articles and audio recordings of town hall meetings. The corruption portrayed in this series of events reflect a pattern of politics in Alabama that has been commonplace for many years, as reported in the Harvard Political Review. History Loachapoka was a Creek Indian town for some decades prior to white settlement. In the last census prior to the Native removal to Oklahoma, Loachapoka was found to have a population of 564. Upon settlement by Euro-Americans, Loachapoka‚Äîtemporarily renamed Ball's Fork‚Äîbecame the regional trade center, a position that was reinforced in 1845 when it became the easternmost point on the railroad to Montgomery. Loachapoka's influence peaked in the early 1870s, when her population reached nearly 1,300. Within a few years, a collapse of trade due to the Panic of 1873 and additional rail lines in the area sent Loachapoka into economic decline. Loachapoka roughly stabilized as a small farming community by the mid-20th century, and by the early 2000s (decade) had become a small-town suburb of Auburn. The mayor of Loachapoka is Zach Holmes. Culture Loachapoka was home to two fall festivals, both held on the same day each fall‚Äîthe annual Syrup Sopping Day [to the South of Highway 14] and the Lee County Historical Fair [at Pioneer Park, to the north of Highway 14.] Many fairgoers were not aware of the fact that they are actually attending two celebrations of area history. The Syrup Sop featured the making of syrup in traditional methods from sorghum and ribbon cane. The Historical Fair featured life in the 1850s in east central Alabama. The two festivals were combined into one named Pioneer Day. Combined, the two events attract more than 20,000 people to Loachapoka annually. Loachapoaka is the home town of country music singer Freddie Hart. The Lee County Historical Society Museum is located in an 1845 general store in the Loachapoka historic district, located at \\"Pioneer Park,\\" a six and-a-half-acre park of 9 buildings and 5 gardens reminiscent of the 1850s in east central Alabama.

It is a principal city of the Auburn-Opelika Metropolitan Area. As of the 2010 census, the population of Opelika was 26,401, and in 2019 the estimated population was 30,908. The Auburn-Opelika, AL MSA with a population of 150,933, along with the Columbus, Georgia metropolitan area, comprises the Greater Columbus combined statistical area, a region home to 501,649 residents. Opelika's historic downtown History The first white settlers in the area now known as Opelika arrived in the late 1830s and established a community called Lebanon. After the removal of the native Creek (Muscogee) peoples by federal troops in 1836‚Äì37, the area became known as \\"Opelika.\\" This word taken from the Muskogee language means \\"large swamp\\". In 1848, the Montgomery and West Point Railroad Company extended a rail line from Montgomery, Alabama, to Opelika, and in 1851, completed a connection to West Point, Georgia, thus connecting Opelika with Atlanta, Georgia. This line was the only direct rail route between New Orleans and the Eastern Seaboard. It rapidly became one of the primary trade lines for shipments of raw cotton from Southern plantations to the North. The Montgomery and West Point was soon joined by a rail connection to Columbus, Georgia, in 1855, and a connection to Birmingham, Alabama, in 1869. Almost overnight, Opelika became a regional hub for commerce. To manage this rapid growth, Opelika was incorporated as a town on February 9, 1854, then within Russell County. As a result of Opelika's transportation infrastructure, many warehouses for storing cotton and other goods were built. With the onset of the Civil War, these warehouses were converted to Confederate supply depots. In 1864 and 1865, Union raids commanded by Lovell Rousseau and James H. Wilson attacked Opelika, tearing up the railroads and destroying all government property, including Opelika's warehouses. Soon after the end of the war, the Alabama state legislature created a new county out of parts of Macon, Russell, Chambers, and Tallapoosa Counties to be named after Confederate general Robert E. Lee. In 1866, citizens of the new \\"Lee County\\" voted Opelika as the county seat. The town was technically unincorporated after having its charter revoked for abetting the rebellion against the United States. After Opelika received a new charter in 1870, rapid growth resumed. The town nearly doubled in size between 1870 and 1900. Opelika's downtown was packed with saloons catering to railroad workers and other men. Frequent gunfire in the street by intoxicated patrons resulted in railroads directing their passengers to duck beneath the windows when their trains passed through the town.\\"The Battle Of The Bar- rooms; Murderous Factions Fights In Alabama‚ÄîDeath Of Maloney In Opelika\\", New York Times, 15 December 1882, accessed 4 April 2016. In 1882, two factions claimed to rule the city government, one known as the \\"Bar room\\" headed by Mayor Dunbar, a saloon keeper, and another known as the \\"Citizens\\". In a riot in late November‚ÄìDecember of that year, a dozen men were wounded. In the end, a few were killed. The Citizens had claimed control of the city via the elections, but Dunbar refused to give up. After continued violence, the state legislature revoked the city's charter and the governor sent in the militia to restore order. The legislature appointed five commissioners to manage the city, a situation that continued until 1899. That year, the legislature restored the city's charter. =1900 to present= In 1900, local investors founded the Opelika Cotton Mill as the first textile plant in the city, employing 125. The city was located on the Fall Line of the Piedmont, where factories were established to take advantage of water power. Attempts to expand the textile industry in Opelika continued for the next three decades. From 1930 to 1970, Opelika continued industrialization, becoming a regional economic powerhouse. In the 1950s, Opelika attracted the nation's first and largest magnetic tape manufacturing plant. In 1963, tire manufacturer Uniroyal constructed a massive plant in Opelika. Around the same time, Diversified Products revolutionized the physical fitness equipment industry with products produced in their Opelika plant. By the early 1970s, Opelika's industries employed nearly 10,000 people. Between the late 1970s and 2005, nonagricultural employment in the Auburn-Opelika, AL, MSA grew at a slow and steady pace. Of the goods-producing industries, the metropolitan area has experienced the most change in manufacturing, which peaked in employment in the late 1980s. As many jobs moved offshore, employment declined, but this trend appears to be changing, as the number of manufacturing jobs has risen steadily since 2002. In the late 1990s, Opelika purchased and developed the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park to increase its base. The park site was purchased with funds from two bond issues, commonly called the 1998A and 1998B issues, totaling $10,280,000. Additional expenditures involved in constructing the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park included $4.3 million transferred from the city's general fund to the Opelika Industrial Development Authority (OIDA) between 1997 and 2000, a $1.9 million federal industrial park access road grant, $2.5 million from Opelika Water Works Board and the City of Opelika to sewer and water the park, $12.1 million from the Alabama Department of Transportation to construct an interchange. Additional expenditures were made by Tallapoosa Electric Cooperative for an electrical substation and by the OIDA for building construction for park tenants. Final expenditures for the land and development of the park totaled about $32 million. Since 1999, two major distribution centers, four tier-one automotive suppliers, Pharmavite, the global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of dietary supplements, and most recently Golden State Foods, one of the biggest service providers to McDonald's restaurants, including liquid products, and its third largest beef supplier in the U.S., have located within the park. The site has also attracted serious interest from automakers Audi, Nissan, and Hyundai. In the summer of 2003, the park was recognized as one of the \\"South's Best Automotive Assembly Plant Sites\\" by Southern Business and Development, an industry trade publication. Opelika has had a related boom in retail development. TigerTown, a mixed-use development, is east Alabama's largest retail center with more than of retail space. Located at the intersection of Interstate 85 and Highway 280 (exit 58) in Opelika and home to more than 70 businesses, TigerTown's tenants include Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, Starbucks, Olive Garden, Kroger, PETCO, Office Depot, Dick's Sporting Goods, World Market, Hobby Lobby, Kohl's, Bed, Bath and Beyond, T.J. Maxx, Kroger, Old Navy, and more. Opelika's largest employer is the East Alabama Medical Center, which paid around $119 million in salaries and benefits to more than 2,700 employees in 2009.page 14 Historic downtown Opelika has had an urban design revitalization in association with the national Main Street, Inc. program. With a compact historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places, downtown Opelika has attracted a variety of specialty shops, galleries, antique stores, and restaurants. With industrial and retail growth has come an increase in population. From 2000 to 2010, Opelika grew from 23,638 to 26,617.Opelika population figures as recorded by the US Census Bureau (July 1 estimates base): 2000-23,638, 2001-23,636, 2002-23,579, 2003-23,597, 2004-23,483, 2005-23,804 .

As of the 2010 census, the population of the city was 32,822. Phenix City lies immediately west across the Chattahoochee River from the much larger Columbus, Georgia and observes Eastern Time on a de facto basis (in contrast to the rest of Alabama, which observes Central Time) due to Phenix City's strong economic ties to Columbus. Most of Phenix City is included in the Columbus Metropolitan Statistical Area, and the remainder is in Lee County and therefore included in the Auburn, Alabama Metropolitan Statistical Area. The entire city is part of the Columbus-Auburn-Opelika Combined Statistical Area. In 2007, BusinessWeek named Phenix City the nation's No. 1 Best Affordable Suburb to raise a family. It is home to Chattahoochee Valley Community College, a public, two-year college with an acceptance rate of 100%.https://www.collegesimply.com/colleges- near/alabama/phenix-city/ As of 2020, the mayor is Eddie N.

Geography Phenix City is located at (32.472822, ‚àí85.020121). It is the easternmost settlement in the state of Alabama as well as the Central Time Zone, but it and some other nearby areas unofficially observe Eastern Time, as these areas are part of the metropolitan area of the considerably larger city of Columbus, Georgia, which is in the Eastern Time Zone and adjacent to the city across the Chattahoochee River to the east. Several major highways run through Phenix City, namely U.S. Routes 80, 280, and 431. U.S. Route 80 runs through the northern and western parts of the city, leading west 44 mi (71 km) to Tuskegee and northeast to Columbus, Georgia. U.S. 280 runs through the western part of the city from northwest to southeast, leading northwest 27 mi (43 km) to Opelika and southeast into Columbus. U.S. 431 runs north to south to the west of the city, concurrent with US 280, which it follows to Opelika, and leads south 47 mi (76 km) to Eufaula.

On the south side was Girard, in Russell County, and the town of Brownville, on the north side, which was entirely within Lee County. Because a community in Tuscaloosa County already claimed the name of Brownville, the post office insisted on the name of \\"Lively\\". To compound the confusion, the nearby railroad depot was called Knight's Station. Because residents preferred Brownville, on the 1880 U.S. Census, it was listed as both Brownville and Lively. It was formally incorporated by the legislature on February 23, 1883.http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-2133 Within the decade, the name would be changed to Phenix (or Phenix City), although some misspellings had it as \\"Phoenix\\". It was not clear if it was named for Phenix Mills in adjacent Columbus, Georgia, or for the fabled bird. It appeared as Phenix City on the 1890 U.S. Census and was incorporated as such on February 19, 1897 by the state legislature. The City Official website displays the mythical Phoenix. The City's Seal also depicts the Phoenix burning up in its nest. The 'Our Community/History' page confirms the uncertainty behind the name: \\"Although no definitive source reveals why this name was chosen.\\" On August 9, 1923, Russell County's neighboring Girard (which made up most of current downtown Phenix City) and Lee County's Phenix City formally merged, keeping the name of Phenix City. Because the consolidated city still remained divided into two counties, in 1932, the Lee County portion was moved entirely into Russell County (also cited for the redraw was to account for population shifts involved in the Auburn University opening and expansion). Lee County received the rural segment at Marvyn as compensation, which was formerly in Russell County's northwest corner. In 1926, the Russell County portion of Phenix City was designated the second county seat (the seat from 1868 had been at rural Seale). In 1934/35, Phenix City then became the sole county seat. Phenix City was notorious during the 1940s and 1950s for being a haven for organized crime, prostitution, and gambling. Many of its customers came from the United States Army training center at Fort Benning, Georgia. The leaders of the crime syndicate in Phenix City were Jimmie Matthews and Hoyt Shepherd. Albert Patterson, from Phenix City, was elected to become attorney general of Alabama on a platform of reforming the city, but was shot and killed in 1954 outside his office on 5th Ave, north of 14th Street. As a result, the city had a negative reputation, and many people still associate this legacy with Phenix City. The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama by Margaret Ann Barnes chronicles these events, which led the small town to be known as \\"Sin City, USA\\". The bordertown was the subject of an acclaimed film, The Phenix City Story, made in 1955. In 1955, it won the All-America City Award from the National Municipal League. Despite the city having been entirely annexed into Russell County in 1932, the growth of the city has spread northward back into Lee County, where it first appeared on 1980 U.S. Census records. , nearly 4,200 residents (out of almost 33,000) reside in the Lee County portion.1880‚Äì2010 U.S. Censuses research on Brownville and Phenix City, Alabama Religion Phenix City is home to many Christian churches.

History Southern Railroad Depot, Madison, Alabama This area was occupied historically by the Koasati (also known as Coushatta), a Muskogean- speaking people and, before them, thousands of years of indigenous cultures. Madison's first European-American resident was John Cartwright, who settled in the area in 1818. The city was originally known as Madison Station, and it developed in the 1850s around a stop of the Memphis & Charleston Railroad. Textile mills were built in the area in the late 19th century for processing of cotton. Madison was the site of a battle in the American Civil War. On May 17, 1864, Col. Josiah Patterson's 5th Alabama Cavalry, supported by Col. James H. Stuart's cavalry battalion and a section of horse artillery, drove Col. Adam G. Gorgas's 13th Illinois Infantry Regiment from the city. Patterson's men captured the 13th Illinois Regiment's wagon train, taking 66 prisoners. They also burned Union supplies and tore up the railroad tracks before retreating. Portions of the 5th Ohio Cavalry, the 59th Indiana Infantry and the 5th Iowa Infantry were sent in pursuit from Huntsville.

Its population was 49 at the 2010 census. Geography Benton is located at (32.306248, -86.817551). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (8.82%) is water. History Settled in 1832 on land owned by James Maull, it was initially known as Maull's Landing, before it was renamed and incorporated as Benton in 1834.http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-3541 It was named after Thomas Hart Benton, then the U.S. Senator from Missouri, who had served under General Andrew Jackson in the Creek Campaign. During the steamboat era, it was a major trading stop along the Alabama River. Maull's son, Edward, auctioned off lots in 1855, that were incorporated into the town. The earliest year any population figures were returned by the U.S. Census for the area (below the county level) was in 1870, when Benton Beat (then one of ten divisions in Lowndes County) returned 2,627 residents, the majority of whom were newly emancipated blacks.http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1870a-05.pdf In 1880, Lowndes County was subdivided further into 20 beats (precincts), and the Benton Beat fell to 1,094 residents.http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1880a_v1-09.pdf In 1890, it declined to 994, and for the first time, the town of Benton was reported separately with a population of 265.http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1890a_v1-07.pdf Benton's incorporation would lapse shortly (the town did not report a separate population in 1900) and with the shift to railroads, followed by the outmigration of the majority black population, it would dwindle in size. The Benton Precinct would fall from 1,049 in 1900 (same as its 1880 population), down to 409 by 1950, before all the county precincts were eliminated and redistricted into census divisions. In 1964, Benton was reincorporated, reporting 115 residents as of the 1970 census. As of 1990, it has declined to just under 50 residents and has held steady as of 2010. Out of Lowndes County's seven incorporated communities, it is one of only two with a white majority (as of 2000 and 2010), Lowndesboro being the other. It is also one of the smallest incorporated communities in the state. Benton, Alabama can be confused in genealogy research with Calhoun County, Alabama, which was known as Benton County from 1832 to 1858, and which was also originally named for Senator Benton, but renamed because of his unpopular (in Alabama) political views by the late 1850s.

At the 2010 census the population was 932, down from its record high of 1,177 in 2000. The city is the county seat of Lowndes County. It is also part of the Montgomery Metropolitan Statistical Area. It initially incorporated in 1831, but lapsed, finally reincorporating in 1967. Before 1970, the town appeared only twice on the U.S. Census: in 1850 and 1890. The 1850 estimate of 800 residents ranked it as the largest town in the county at the time. History Located in the fertile Black Belt region, Hayneville was the county seat in a slave society based on cotton production. The town was later a railway terminus and home to the Hayneville Railway Company, which was organized in 1903. Two years later, the company was reorganized as the Hayneville & Montgomery Railroad Company and provided connections for shipping with the L&N; Railroad Company's tracks. During the early part of the 20th century, the boll weevil invaded the South, destroying cotton crops across the most productive counties. At the same time, In the latter half of the 20th century, the agricultural focus shifted to more diverse crops and livestock. Hayneville, like the rest of the Black Belt, has struggled to shift to a more productive economy. =Settlement (1820-1831)= Hayneville was founded in 1820 by settlers from the Edgefield, Abbeville, and Colleton districts of South Carolina on property purchased from the U.S. Land Office at Cahawba. Throughout the 1820s, Hayneville was known as \\"Big Swamp\\". The indigenous Muscogee Creek people had been forced to cede their lands under various treaties with the United States, and most of them were removed to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. In 1831, after being chosen as the county seat of Lowndes County, the town was officially named Hayneville in honor of Robert Y. Hayne, governor of South Carolina and a U.S. senator. =Civil Rights Era and \\"Bloody Lowndes\\" (1965)= Despite the county's black majority, it had no registered black voters in the spring of 1965, after more than 60 years of disenfranchisement under the state constitution. Civil rights activists worked in Hayneville and Lowndes to organize residents in preparation for registration and voting. After passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 in August, activists provided residents with political education and helped them register to vote. They continued to work to integrate stores and public facilities. On August 13, 1965, Jonathan Daniels, an Episcopal seminarian from New Hampshire, worked with a group of 29 civil rights protesters to picket whites-only stores in the small town of Fort Deposit. All of the protesters were arrested by county police and taken to jail in nearby Hayneville. Five juvenile protesters were released the next day. The rest of the group was held for six days; they refused to accept bail unless everyone was bailed. On August 20, the prisoners were released without transport back to Fort Deposit. After release, the group waited by a road nearby the jail. Daniels, along with three others ‚Äî a white Catholic priest and two black women activists‚Äîwent to buy soft drinks at Varner's Grocery Store, one of the few local stores that would serve non-whites. There, they encountered Tom L. Coleman, an engineer for the state highway department and unpaid special county deputy wielding a shotgun. The man threatened the group, and finally leveled his gun at seventeen-year-old Ruby Sales. Daniels pushed Sales to the ground and caught the full blast of the gun, which killed him instantly. Father Richard F. Morrisroe grabbed the other protester and ran. Coleman shot Morrisroe, wounding him in the lower back. White resistance to civil rights organizers continued. In June 1965, Gregory Orr, a student from upstate New York who traveled to Mississippi to take part in civil rights protests, was driving home from the capital of Jackson. He had been arrested there with other protesters and held without charges for 10 days at the state fairgrounds. While driving through Lowndes County, he was stopped by white vigilantes, kidnapped and held without charges for eight days in the Hayneville courthouse jail. Back in New York that August, Orr read a report of the murder of Jonathan Daniels in The New York Times. He recognized one of his kidnappers in a photograph‚Äîapparently Tom Coleman.Gregory Orr, \\"Return to Hayneville\\", Virginia Quarterly Review, Summer 2008 Numerous other incidents have been documented in the county of violence against civil rights people. Civil rights activities in Lowndes continued in the county under the leadership of Stokeley Carmichael, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and local residents, to educate and register blacks to vote after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. They organized the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LFCO), the first independent black political party in the county since Reconstruction era, and continued to register voters. They ran a slate of candidates in 1966 but lost due to election fraud in the majority-black county. In 1970, African-American chairman of LCFO John Hulett was elected as county sheriff. =Incorporation (1967-1968)= The incorporation of Hayneville as a town began in July 1967 with the vision of 25 qualified electors of the county and residents of the Hayneville community. Two subsequent attempts were made for incorporation, the last resulting in favor of incorporation. Only one person filed for a statement of candidacy and was nominated for the office of Mayor and five places on the town council. Therefore, due to the completion of the requirements of incorporation, the court declared on July 15, 1968, by Probate Judge Harold Hammond, that Hayneville was completely incorporated.

At the 2010 census the population was 115, down from 140 in 2000. It is part of the Montgomery Metropolitan Statistical Area. Although initially incorporated in 1856 by an act of the state legislature, it lapsed and was not reincorporated until 1962. As of the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Censuses, Lowndesboro, along with Benton, are the only two towns (out of 7) in Lowndes County with a white majority of residents. Both are the 6th (Lowndesboro) and 7th (Benton) smallest communities. History Originally known as McGill's Hill, the community began attracting settlers following the conclusion of the Creek War. In 1832, the residents changed the name to Lowndesboro in honor of U.S. Congressman William Lowndes, the son of Rawlins Lowndes, an early South Carolina governor. With its proximity to the Alabama River, the community had grown into a prosperous town by the 1830s. Many wealthy planters settled in the area, leaving a legacy of historic mid-19th-century architecture that largely survived intact into the modern era. A brief skirmish was fought at Lowndesboro in April 1865 between a group of Confederate cavalry and advance troops of the Union Army during Wilson's Raid. Federal troops occupied the town after driving off the Confederate force, with very little destruction noted from the occupation, thus preserving many of the antebellum houses and structures in the Lowndesboro Historic District. Like many small Southern communities with an economy based on cotton production and trade, Lowndesboro declined rapidly in the post-war years. At least partially attributed to this decline was the survival of much of the pre-war architecture into the 20th century, making it a unique assemblage of 19th-century architecture. Today much of the town is included in the Lowndesboro Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Dicksonia Plantation ruins are also a notable place of interest. Lowndesboro was the site of a number of significant events in the civil rights movement. On March 25, 1965, civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo was shot to death during a high-speed chase by Ku Klux Klan members on U.S. Route 80, while driving to Montgomery to pick up a group of demonstrators waiting to return to Selma after the Selma-to- Montgomery march. The Klansmen spotted the white Liuzzo and her black passenger, Leroy Moton, at a stoplight in Selma, catching up to the pair about two miles (3 km) west of Lowndesboro. In 1966 a number of Lowndes County African-American families were evicted from their homes in retaliation for their participation in the movement. Twenty of these families set up a tent city outside of Lowndesboro rather than flee the area. Geography Lowndesboro is located at (32.273118, -86.609915).

The 2010 census placed the population at 149, unchanged from 2000. History and educational legacy The Creek Indians (Muscogee people) had long been cultivating lands in this area, producing crops of maize, squash and beans (the Three Sisters), and tobacco, used primarily for ritual purposes. Osceola (1804-1838), who became well-known as a leader of the Seminole people in Florida, was born to a Creek woman at Red Creek, 10 miles from the Tallapoosa River. He was of mixed race but identified as Creek; the people have a matrilineal kinship system. Franklin has been home to many churches for more than 200 years. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a Methodist Missionary Church operated here for the Creek. It had two cemeteries, one for whites and one for the Creek. James McQueen, a Scots trader who lived here and married a Creek woman, was great-grandfather of Osceola. McQueen is buried in the Indian cemetery. After the Creek were forced to cede their lands, European Americans developed the area for cotton cultivation. They depended on the labor of enslaved African Americans, many of whom were initially transported to this region from the Upper South in the domestic slave trade. Cotton continued as the chief commodity crop after the Civil War. Residents established Franklin School by the 1890s, teaching grades 1‚Äì11 of white students. By the mid-1930s, the upper grades had been moved to another facility, and it held grades 1-6. Northern and southern classrooms were adjoined by a common auditorium. The school's original water source was a spring near the buildings. A well was later dug in the front yard of the school, with a hand pump to get water. Heat was provided by a wood-burning potbelly stove. Each student brought a stick of wood every morning to burn in the stove. The school closed in 1942, and its 75‚Äì80 students transferred to Tuskegee schools. After the school closed, the northern classroom was moved to its current location and converted to a community center. The rest of the school was torn down. In the mid-20th century, musician Hank Williams Sr. often performed at dances at the community center. Upon Franklin's incorporation in 1977, the town began using the community center building as the town hall. A mile north of Town Hall lay the remnants of what is rumored to be the first school in Macon County. Harris Barret School. Harris Barrett School was built in 1903 with handmade bricks made by students of the Tuskegee Normal School (now Tuskegee University), under the direction of Booker T. Washington. In the segregated system of public facilities, the Barrett School was reserved for African-American students, who were mostly descendants of freedmen in this rural area. Both the Barrett School and the Tuskegee Institute played a major role in education in the Franklin community. They operated an experimental farm on the west side of Baldwin Farm Road. Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver were both active in farming in Franklin, and assisted farmers both black and white. Harris Barrett School was restored and is operated as a historic museum; it is located at the corner of Co. Rd. 27 and 36. Geography Franklin is located at (32.455388, -85.802884).

Retrieved: October 3, 2010.) is a city in Macon County, Alabama, United States. It was founded and laid out in 1833 by General Thomas Simpson Woodward, a Creek War veteran under Andrew Jackson, and made the county seat that year. It was incorporated in 1843. It is also the largest city in Macon County. At the 2010 census the population was 9,865, down from 11,846 in 2000. Tuskegee has been an important site in African-American history and highly influential in United States history since the 19th century. Before the American Civil War, the area was largely used as a cotton plantation, dependent on African-American slave labor. After the war, many freedmen continued to work on plantations in the rural area, which was devoted to agriculture. In 1881 the Tuskegee Normal School (now Tuskegee University, a historically black college) was founded by Lewis Adams, a former slave whose father, Jesse Adams, a slave owner, allowed him to be educated. Its first founding principal was Booker T. Washington, who developed a national reputation and philanthropic network to support education of freedmen and their children. In 1923, the Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center was established here, initially for the estimated 300,000 African-American veterans of World War I in the South, when public facilities were racially segregated. Twenty-seven buildings were constructed on the 464-acre campus.\\"Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center Celebrates - 85 Years of Service\\", press release, Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System (CAVHCS), 2008 The city was the subject of a notable civil rights case, Gomillion v. Lightfoot (1960), in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that the state legislature had violated the Fifteenth Amendment in 1957 by gerrymandering city boundaries as a 28-sided figure that excluded nearly all black voters and residents, and none of the white voters or residents. The city's boundaries were restored in 1961 after the ruling. Etymology The name \\"Tuskegee\\" comes from Spanish \\"Tasquiqui\\", which came from the Muskogee word \\"Taskeke\\", a name of a Creek settlement and meaning \\"warriors.\\" History The area was settled by whites in the 1830s after the Creek Native American tribes had been removed to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Pioneer planters brought or purchased African-American slaves to develop the rich soil for cotton plantations, as short-staple cotton was the chief commodity crop through the 19th century. Invention of the cotton gin at the end of the 18th century meant that this type of cotton could be processed profitably and it was adaptable to the upland areas. Designated as the county seat of rural Macon County, Tuskegee developed as its only city. In 1881, the young Booker T. Washington was hired to develop the Tuskegee Normal School for Colored Teachers on the grounds of a former plantation. It was founded to train teachers for the segregated school system and freedmen for self- sufficiency. Washington established a work-study program by which students practiced skills and trades. Over the decades, the programs were expanded. This was later named the Tuskegee Institute. Graduate courses were added and it became Tuskegee University. Washington was known for his emphasis on education and self-improvement. The institute became known for stressing a practical education with work experience by students, to prepare them for the work available in the small towns and rural areas to which most would return. Teaching was a highly respected calling, as education was a major goal among the freedmen and their children. Washington believed that African Americans would achieve acceptance by southern whites when they had raised themselves.Richard B. Sobol, \\"Reviewed Work: Gomillion versus Lightfoot: The Tuskegee Gerrymander Case by Bernard Taper\\", Columbia Law Review Vol. 62, No. 4 (Apr. 1962), pp. 748‚Äì751 Washington led the school for decades, building a wide national network of white industrialist donors among some of the major philanthropists of the era, including George Eastman. At the same time, Washington secretly provided funding to the NAACP for its legal defense of some highly visible civil rights cases, including supporting challenges to southern states' discriminatory constitutions and practices that disenfranchised African Americans.Richard H. Pildes, Democracy, Anti- Democracy, and the Canon, Constitutional Commentary, vol.17, 2000, pp.13‚Äì14 Accessed March 10, 2008 Through the 1920s and 1930s, Washington worked with Julius Rosenwald and architects at the college to develop models for rural schools, to be used with Rosenwald's matching funds to gain construction of more rural schools for black children in the South. Beginning in 1932, the school was the site of the now-infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study (1932‚Äì1972), started to test treatments of the disease. 600 African-American men became involved, being offered free medical care by the U.S. government for their participation, while being unwittingly tested for syphilis. With funding cut by the Great Depression, staff cut back on medication to treat the disease and studied the effects of untreated syphilis on patients and their partners. Those in the study who had syphilis were not told, nor were they informed that treatment was available for their disease, even after antibiotics had been developed. One of the most famous teachers at Tuskegee was George Washington Carver, whose name is synonymous with innovative research into Southern farming methods and the development of hundreds of commercial products derived from regional crops, including peanuts and sweet potatoes. During World War II, Tuskegee and Tuskegee Institute were also home to the famed Tuskegee Airmen. This was the first squadron of African-American pilots trained in the U.S. Military for service in that war. The university in the 21st century is a center of excellence for African-American education. The heart of the university has been designated as a National Historic District and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center was opened in 1923, authorized by Congress. A total of 27 buildings were constructed on the 464-acre campus, which provided housing and a hospital to serve the needs of more than 300,000 African- American veterans in the South from World War I. It attracted doctors from top schools, such as Dr. Toussaint Tourgee Tildon, a graduate of Harvard Medical School. He was one of the first six African-American doctors to work at the hospital; as director of the complex for 12 years (1946‚Äì1958), he achieved accreditation for a medical residency program at the hospital. He also worked to ensure accessibility for graduates to good medical positions in the federal government.Elizabeth D. Schafer. \\"Tildon, Toussaint Tourgee\\", American National Biography Online, February 2003, published by Oxford University Press, Inc., copyright 2000 American Council of Learned Societies In the 1930s, a group of black men from the Tuskegee Men's Club began efforts to get more black voters registered. Beginning in 1941, the group reorganized under the name the Tuskegee Civic Association (TCA). With the group's consistent effort to register more voters, the area's statistics about registered black voters continued to increase. The group and potential voters were often met with obstacles that prevented them from being successful. The surrounding black community showed support and wanted to recognize black leaders in the community. The work of the TCA also had a huge emphasis on educating their communities on various civic duties. Though the existing support for the TCA was not often vocalized, many black community members wanted to challenge the political system that was present in Macon County. The group shed a light on the disparities in the numbers of black people applying for voter registration and those who were successful, even going as far as talking to the United States Commission on Civil Rights. =Voting rights challenge= Following passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, activists had made progress in registering black voters in the city. African Americans in Tuskegee and other Alabama cities had been largely disenfranchised after passage of a new state constitution in 1901, which included requirements that were discriminatory in practice, including a poll tax and literacy tests. In 1957, a total of 1000 voters were registered, with the 400 registered black voters nearly equalling the number of white voters. But in the city, African Americans outnumbered whites on a four-to-one basis; among them were many highly-educated, professional African Americans working at the Tuskegee Institute and the Veterans Administration hospital. That year, without debate and against the protests of many African Americans, the state legislature redrew the boundaries of the city, enacting Local Law 140, which created an irregular, 28-sided city boundary that left only ten black voters within the newly- defined city and excluded 420 black voters. Those excluded included the entire professional staff of the Institute and the hospital. No white voters were excluded by the change.Allen Mendenhall, \\"Gomillion v. Lightfoot\\", Encyclopedia of Alabama, May 2, 2011 The law was intended to guarantee that minority whites could retain control of the city even if more blacks succeeded in the arduous process of registering to vote. Some 3,000 African-American residents protested passage of the law at a church in Tuskegee; they also began an economic boycott of white businesses in the city. The boycott was referred to as a \\"selective buying campaign\\" due to the fact that boycotting was illegal under state law. It lasted about four years, during which twenty- six businesses operated by white proprietors closed down. African Americans also organized a legal challenge to the law, supported by the NAACP, in a case known as Gomillion v. Lightfoot. The law was initially upheld by the US District Court and affirmed by the Appeals Court based in New Orleans. However, it was struck down by the US Supreme Court in 1960, with the ruling implemented in 1961.Richard B. Sobol, \\"Reviewed Work: Gomillion versus Lightfoot: The Tuskegee Gerrymander Case by Bernard Taper\\", Columbia Law Review, Vol. 62, No. 4 (Apr. 1962), pp. 748‚Äì751, Published by: Columbia Law Review Association, Inc., accessed January 17, 2015 The court ruled that the gerrymandering of city boundaries was racially motivated and violated the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which states that \\"states were not insulated from federal judicial review when they jeopardized federally protected rights.\\" The exclusionary gerrymandering was overturned and the previous boundaries of the city were restored. This case was cited in the later Baker v. Carr (1964), in which the Supreme Court ruled that Tennessee's malapportionment of election districts violated civil rights. It ruled that representation in both houses of all state legislatures had to be based on population, under the \\"one man, one vote\\" doctrine, and that such districts had to be regularly updated to reflect population changes. =After the civil rights movement= Johnny Ford was elected the first black mayor of the city in 1972, and served six consecutive terms in office. Lucenia Williams Dunn was elected the first black woman mayor in 2000. Governance In the 21st century, Tuskegee has a council‚Äìmanager government led by a four-member city council, a mayor, and an appointed city manager. The city council acts as a legislative body of the city, passing laws and regulations and appointing citizens to the city's various boards. Each member of the city council is elected for a four-year term from one of three geographic single-member districts. Tuskegee has one city council member who is elected at-large to a four-year term and serves as mayor-pro tem. The duties of the mayor are to promote the city, communicate with residents, and preside over City Council meetings. As such, the position of mayor in Tuskegee is primarily ceremonial.

The city and other officials were sued under Gomillion v. Lightfoot (1960); the US Supreme Court ruled against the state's action. The city boundaries were reinstituted, as reflected by the dramatic \\"increase\\" of population in the city recorded in 1970. The population in 1960, with the restored borders, was 7,240, according to the 1970 U.S. Census. Because of lack of economic opportunities in the largely rural area, both the city and rural county have lost population since the late 20th century. As of the census of 2000, there were 11,846 people, 4,169 households, and 2,326 families residing in the city. The population density was 765.7 people per square mile (295.7/km).

As of the 2010 census, the population of the community is 5,281.  History  In the late 1800s through early 1900s, Harvest saw growth and development due to extension of the Fayetteville, TN rail yard along the existing Nashville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis (NC&StL;) Railroad. In the early-mid 1900s Harvest was centered around the railroad, between Capshaw and Toney, presently known as Old Railroad Bed Rd. Many early settlers in the Harvest area were from the Fayetteville, TN. April 20, 1929, the NC&StL; Railroad Company sold the property and roadbed running through Madison County to the County Highway Department with a quitclaim deed. Today, the roadbed is marked as a two-lane roadway that continues to serve as a vital link in the modern day-to-day transportation network, and carries the seemingly appropriate name ‚ÄúOld Railroad Bed Road‚Äù. Elder members of the Harvest community recall a significant Native American presence in the area, primarily along the railroad areas. On April 3, 1974, during the 1974 Super Outbreak, two F5 tornadoes struck the community within 30 minutes of each other. Most of Harvest, primarily along the Old Railroad Bed area, along with nearby communities such as Tanner, was destroyed. Fifty people were killed by the tornadoes. Harvest was hit by another violent tornado on May 18, 1995 that devastated the Anderson Hills subdivision. This tornado killed one person and was rated F4. On April 27, 2011, during the 2011 Super Outbreak, Harvest suffered significant damage from the EF5 tornado that destroyed Hackleburg and Phil Campbell, primarily north of Nick Davis Road, situated between Old Railroad Bed and Wall Triana. The Anderson Hills subdivision was once again devastated, and damage in Harvest was rated EF4. The tornado killed 72 people along its path. On March 2, 2012, during the tornado outbreak of March 2‚Äì3, 2012, Harvest suffered yet another direct hit from a damaging tornado, this one rated EF3. The tornado hit exactly the same area as the April 27, 2011 tornado, though no fatalities occurred this time. Some of the houses being rebuilt from that outbreak were destroyed again.

As of the 2010 census, the population of the community was 3,630. The 2010 estimated population for the Hazel Green zip code 35750 was 12,783.  History  The town was named Hazel Green because of the hazel bushes along the road were of a vibrant green. In the early 19th century, several farmers from Georgia and the Carolinas settled in Hazel Green after discovering that the area had some of the richest soil in the Southeast. A post office was built in 1819 on the southeast corner of the intersection now known as Hwy. 231-431 & Joe Quick Road. Several grocers and rest stops were also built along this intersection. It became a bustling community and incorporated into a town on June 15, 1821 by an act of the state legislature with a population of approximately 400. At the time, Hazel Green was a small, rural community that served as a crossroads. Roads connected Hazel Green with Athens to the west, Winchester, TN to the east, Huntsville to the south, and Nashville to the north. These roads intersected at what is now known as the intersection of US Highway 231/431, Joe Quick Road, and West Limestone Road. The town eventually became unincorporated and despite recent growth, remains unincorporated to this day. On April 3, 1974, Hazel Green was hit by an F5 tornado during the 1974 Super Outbreak. After several months of rumors and speculation, Walmart began construction of a Supercenter on the southwest corner of US Highway 231/431 and Charity Lane in June 2014. This brought attention to several local residents and media outlets, as Walmart typically does not build supercenters in unincorporated areas. After completion in March 2015, the store attracted several other businesses in the same vicinity, including multiple fast food restaurants and shopping centers. As of December 2016, Zaxby's, Burger King, Arby's, Papa Murphy's Pizza, Taco Bell, AT&T;, Great Clips, Dollar Tree, Hibbett Sports, Verizon, and Pet Depot make up the list of new businesses in the area.

The Arsenal is a garrison for a number of tenants including the United States Army Materiel Command, Army's Aviation and Missile Command, the Missile Defense Agency of the Department of Defense, and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. RSA has benefited from decisions by the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission. The Redstone Arsenal CDP had a population of 1,946 as of the 2010 census. The base contains a government and contractor workforce that averages 36,000 to 40,000 personnel daily. Originally a chemical weapons manufacturing facility for World War II, in the immediate post-war era it became home to the German rocket scientists that were brought to the US as part of Operation Paperclip. The team first worked on ballistic missiles, starting with V-2 rocket derivatives before moving on to a series of ever larger designs. Many of their tests were carried out at White Sands Missile Range and flights between the two locations were common. In late 1956 the Army was relieved of most of its ballistic missiles in favor of similar weapons operated by the US Air Force. The German design team was then spun off to become part of the newly founded NASA. Redstone served as the primary site for space launch vehicle design into the 1960s.

History =Pre-1941= A total of 651 prehistoric archaeological sites were archived at Redstone Arsenal to date.Data on File at the Redstone Arsenal Environmental Management Division At least 22 have components dating to the Paleo-Indian period (9200 to 8000 BC). The Paleo-Indian projectile point called the Redstone Point was named after Redstone Arsenal where it was first identified.RSA Archeological Program . redstone.army.mil Euroamerican settlers began to establish homesteads on the land that is now Redstone Arsenal by the first decade of the 19th century. Prior to the Civil War, the landscape was dominated by several large plantations, the remains of which survive as archaeological sites. The land played a peripheral role during the Civil War with activity limited to the posting of pickets along the Tennessee River bank. Following the war, many of the large plantations were increasingly divided into smaller parcels owned by small farmers, who included former slaves and their descendants. By the start of the 20th century, many of the farms were owned by absentee owners, with the land being worked by tenants and sharecroppers. The remains of hundreds of tenant and sharecropper houses still dot the landscape around the installation.Curry, Beverly S.; \\"The People Who Lived on the Land that Is Now Redstone Arsenal\\", Cultural Resources Management Program, U.S. Army Missile Command, 2006 (available at regional libraries) At the beginning of the 20th century, the approximately area of rolling terrain, which contained some of the richest agricultural land in Madison County, included such small farming communities as Spring Hill, Pond Beat, Mullins Flat, and Union Hill. Although there was no electricity, indoor plumbing, or telephones, few roads, and fewer cars or tractors, the people who lived in the area that one former resident recalled as being \\"nearly out of the world\\" prospered enough to support their own stores, mills, shops, gins, churches, and schools. A total of 46 historic cemeteries including slave cemeteries, plantation family cemeteries, and late 19th to early 20th century community cemeteries are maintained on the installation as Redstone Arsenal cemeteries. =Huntsville Arsenal= As part of the mobilization leading to U.S. involvement in World War II, Huntsville Arsenal was established in 1941 to create a second chemical weapons plant in addition to one in Edgewood, Maryland. It was announced by the War Department on July 3, 1941. Over 550 families were displaced when the Army acquired the land, including over 300 tenants and sharecroppers. Most of the landowners were allowed to salvage their assets and rebuild elsewhere. The remaining buildings were almost all razed by the War Department. A land-use agreement was arranged with the Tennessee Valley Authority for the Army to use about of land along the Tennessee River. The military installation was originally composed of three separate entities: the Huntsville Arsenal and the Huntsville Depot (later the Gulf Chemical Warfare Depot), which were operated under the auspices of the Chemical Warfare Service; and the Redstone Ordnance Plant, operated by the Army Ordnance Department. The name Redstone drew on the region's red rocks and soil.Cagle, Mary T.; \\"[Early] History of Redstone Arsenal\\", Public Information Office, Redstone Arsenal; http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/huntsville/history_redstone_arsenal.pdf 1940s munitions production at Huntsville Arsenal In its early years, the arsenal produced and stockpiled chemical weapons such as phosgene, Lewisite, and mustard gas. The use of toxic gases in warfare was banned under the Geneva Protocol of 1925, but the U.S. signed with the reservation that it be allowed to use chemical weapons against aggressors who used them. The facility also produced carbonyl iron powder (for radio and radar tuning), tear gas, and smoke and incendiary devices. The arsenal also produced small pyrotechnic devices including small solid-fuel rockets during the war. In recognition of its production record, the arsenal received the Army-Navy \\"E\\" Award four times, the first on 31 October 1942. The ordnance plant was renamed Redstone Arsenal in 1943. Through the war years, more than 27,000,000 items of chemical munitions were produced and 45,200,000 ammunition shells were loaded. Redstone Army Airfield was established in 1943 for the 6th Army Air Force to test incendiary devices in preparation for the firebombing of Japanese cities.Baker, Michael E.; \\"Redstone Arsenal: Yesterday and Today\\", U.S. Government Printing Office, 1993-758-626/80050; summary: http://geckocountry.com/redstons.shtml Three days after the announcement of the Japanese surrender, production facilities at the installation were put on standby. After the war, Huntsville Arsenal was briefly used as the primary storage facility for the Chemical Warfare Service, and for manufacture of gas masks and dismantling of surplus incendiary bombs. Most of the wartime civilian workforce was furloughed, dropping to 600 from a wartime high of around 4,400. Much of the arsenal land was leased for agriculture, and many of the buildings were leased for local industry. By 1947, the installation was declared to be excess, the first step toward demilitarization.Baker, Op. Cit. Major political and commercial efforts were made in searching for government or business tenants for the space. In early 1948, several buildings of Huntsville Arsenal were leased by the newly formed Keller Motors Corporation with the intention of establishing a major automobile manufacturing complex. Only 18 Keller prototype vehicles were built before the firm's president and primary organizer, George Keller, suddenly died and the operation folded.Gross, Ken, and Rich Taylor; \\"America's Most Needed Car\\", Special Interest Autos no. 30, Sept.‚ÄìOct. 1975, pp. 32‚Äì40, 59; http://assets.hemmings.com/uimage/2197977-0-1200.jpg The Army Air Forces was searching for a site to establish a major air development center and considered Huntsville Arsenal. In 1949, a competing site near Tullahoma, Tennessee was selected. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army then directed that Huntsville Arsenal be advertised for sale by 1 July 1949. The proposed sale never happened, because the Army found it needed the land for the new mission of developing and testing rocket systems. Thiokol Corporation moved operations to Redstone Arsenal from Maryland in the summer of 1949 to research and develop rocket propellants, while Rohm and Haas began work on rockets and jet propulsion. On 30 June 1949, Huntsville Arsenal was deactivated and consolidated with the other two entities to become Redstone Arsenal. Command responsibilities were assumed by Redstone. =Army Ordnance Corps= At the close of World War II, a number of key German scientists and engineers were brought to the United States under Operation Paperclip. Col. Holger Toftoy arranged for 127 individuals, including Wernher von Braun, to receive contracts for work on Army missiles. In late 1945, they began arriving at Fort Bliss, Texas, where, using components brought from Germany, started upgrading the V-2 missile. Testing was done at the nearby White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico.Fidenbach, Peter L.; \\"A Brief History of White Sands Proving Ground,1941‚Äì1965; Ordnance Department, U.S. Army; On 1 June 1949, the Army Chief of Ordnance designated Redstone Arsenal as the Ordnance Rocket Center, its facility for ordnance rocket research and development. In April 1950, the Fort Bliss missile development operation, then with 130 German contract employees, 120 civil-service employees, and 500 military personnel, was transferred to Redstone Arsenal. This became the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC), with Maj. James Hamill as acting commander and von Braun as technical director. An initial project was the Major tactical missile. Upon the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, OGMC was given the mission of developing a surface-to-surface ballistic missile with an objective range of . Starting with an upgraded Major missile, the design went through a series of improvements and ultimately became the PGM-11 with the popular name Redstone rocket. To expedite development, an existing engine was used, greatly reducing the operational range to between 58 and 200 miles.Bullard, John W.; \\"History of the Redstone Missile System\\", Historical Monograph Project No. AMC23M, Historical Division, Army Missile Command, Oct. 1965; http://www.dtic.mil/cgi- bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc;=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD;=ADA434109 During the Korean War, ammunition production was resumed at Redstone Arsenal. From July 1951 through July 1955, near 38,700,000 rounds of chemical artillery munitions were produced. The Ordnance Missile Laboratories (OML) was formed in 1952 to coordinate research and development within the OGMC. Holger Toftoy, who had originally recruited von Braun and his team of missile specialists, was assigned to Huntsville and promoted to Brigadier General as director of the OML. Test operations were under Kurt Debus, who set up the Interim Test Stand and the launch facility at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Redstone static fire testing began in the spring of 1953, followed by the first launch at Cape Canaveral on 20 August 1953. In addition to the Redstone rocket development, the OML had many other research and development programs. Under Toftoy, the organization included the R&D; Division under Col. Miles Birkett Chatfield, the Field Service Division under Maj. Ben Keyserling, and the Industrial Division. In the R&D; Division there were the Surface-to-Air Projects under Maj. Rudy Axelson, the Surface-to-Surface Division under Maj. Dan Breedon, and Special Projects under Lt. Colonel John O'Conner. Projects in Surface-to-Air included the Nike B (later called the Nike Hercules), Hawk and others. Surface-to-Surface projects were the Honest John, Little John, Lacrosse, and Corporal Type III; the liquid-fueled Corporal Type III was soon canceled and the solid Thiokol fueled Sergeant project started. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at the California Institute of Technology was an Army research operation at that time, years before NASA. It was JPL that designed the Corporal system and later was the R&D; designer of the Sergeant. At a 1954 meeting of the Spaceflight Committee of the American Rocket Society, von Braun proposed placing a satellite into orbit using the Redstone with clusters of small solid-fuel rockets on top. The proposal, Project Orbiter, was rejected in 1955. =Ordnance schools= In March 1952, the commanding officer at Redstone Arsenal officially established the Provisional Redstone Ordnance School. In December, the Ordnance Guided Missile School (OGMS) was established, taking over the provisional operation. The OGMS greatly expanded through the years, occupying a large land area with many buildings and providing a wide variety of missile and munitions courses for thousands of students from the U.S. as well as many foreign countries. The name was later changed to the Missile and Munitions Center & School in 1966 and then to the Ordnance Missile and Munitions Center and School in the mid-1980s. In 1994, the School Brigade disbanded and was replaced by the reformed 59th Ordnance Brigade, which had previously disbanded in Europe in 1992. The school was then renamed the Ordnance Munitions and Electronic Maintenance School in 2002 and moved to Fort Lee in 2011.\\"Welcome to OMEMS\\" . =Army Ballistic Missile Agency= RSA commander Maj. Gen. John Medaris, Wernher von Braun, and RSA deputy commander Brig. Gen. Holger Toftoy (left to right) in the 1950s The Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), commanded by Maj. Gen. John Medaris, was formed on 1 February 1956, taking over from Redstone Arsenal the facilities and personnel of OGMC. Von Braun was the Director of ABMA's Development Operations Division. Redstone Arsenal then became an Army post, supporting the ABMA and, in the future, other agencies. Medaris also commanded RSA, and BG Toftoy was deputy.Baker, Op.Cet. The ABMA's primary mission was developing and fielding the Army's first intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Jupiter. By August 1958, the system was delivered to the Air Force for early deployment overseas. Jupiter later proved to be a significant bargaining chip in the Cuban Missile Crisis. During his command, Medaris' operation also fielded the PGM-11 Redstone and MIM-23 Hawk missiles, accelerated the development of the Nike Zeus system, and began development of the MGM-31 Pershing missile system, which later played a role in ending the Cold War. As part of the 1957‚Äì58 International Geophysical Year, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union proposed to launch a scientific satellite. Although von Braun had proposed in 1954 that the OML could place a satellite in Earth orbit, the Naval Research Laboratory, using its Vanguard rocket, was given this assignment. On 4 October 1957, the USSR orbited Sputnik I, the first Earth satellite. A second Sputnik was launched a month later. On 6 December 1957, a first attempt to launch a satellite-carrying Vanguard failed. Toftoy, Medaris, and von Braun immediately pleaded for the opportunity to show what the Army's \\"space team\\" could do. The go-ahead was given and on 31 January 1958, America's first satellite, Explorer I, was placed into orbit using a modified Jupiter launch vehicle (a four-stage system designated Juno I).\\"Explorer I Mssion\\"; The Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC) was formed in March 1958. Headquartered at Redstone Arsenal and commanded by Maj. Gen. Medaris, AOMC had several subordinate elements, including ABMA, White Sands Missile Range, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at California Institute of Technology. Another local activity, the Army Rocket and Guided Missile Agency (ARGMA), was formed and added to AOMC in June. Six months after Explorer I, President Dwight Eisenhower created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on 29 July 1958. On 21 October 1959, he approved the transfer of all Army space-related activities to NASA. This was accomplished effective 1 July 1960, when 4,670 civilian employees, about $100 million worth of buildings and equipment, and of land transferred from RSA/ABMA's Development Operations Division to NASA's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Von Braun was MSFC's first director.\\"Historical Facts\\", MSFC History Office; http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/history_fact_sheet.htm =Army Missile Command= The U.S. Army Missile Command (MICOM) was activated on 1 August 1962 at Redstone Arsenal, absorbing all of the personnel, facilities, and projects remaining in the prior AOMC. On 12 March 1964, the Francis J. McMorrow Missile Laboratories were dedicated in memory of MICOM's first commander, who died while in command. Dating from the start of AMC, Project Nike involving anti- aircraft missiles had been conducted. As the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) came into being, a much higher-performance system was needed for ICBM defense. The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) examined the requirements and recommending a system, designated Nike-X, incorporating phased-array radars, high-performance computers, and separate low-altitude (Sprint) and high-altitude (Spartan) high-velocity interceptor missiles. To manage this development, in 1963 MICOM created the Nike-X Project Office headed by Colonel (later Brigadier General) Ivy O. Drewry. The People's Republic of China exploded its first thermonuclear bomb in June 1967. Hence, ABM system requirements were revised and the Sentinel System was born, replacing Nike-X.\\"Logic behind the ABM system\\", Life, 29 September 1967, pp. 26‚Äì28:https://books.google.com/books?id=clYEAAAAMBAJ&lpg;=PP1&lr;=&rview;=1&pg;=PP1#v=onepage&q;&f;=false In 1968, the Army Ballistic Missile Defence Agency (ABMDA) was formed, taking over Sentinel and other ballistic missile defense projects previously under MICOM. Commanded by BG Drewry, ABMDA established operations adjacent to Redstone Arsenal in the Cummings Research Park. In May 1974, all ballistic missile defense efforts were consolidated under a single manager in the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, which eventually evolved into today's U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command. On 17 July 1997, the former Army Missile Command combined with the aviation portion of the U.S. Army Aviation and Troop Command (ATCOM), creating a new organization at RSA, the United States Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM).Baker, Michael E.; \\"Redstone Arsenal Through the Years\\", 2003 (video);Redstone Arsenal Through the Years. Produced by Michael E. Baker, Command Historian for the US Army Aviation and Missile Command, 2003 =Redstone Arsenal today= Redstone Arsenal remains the center of testing, development, and doctrine for the Army's missile programs. Besides the U.S. Army Materiel Command and the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Life Cycle Management Command, Redstone houses the Tactical UAV Project Office, Redstone Test Center (RTC), the Missile Defense Agency, the Missile and Space Intelligence Center, and other operations. After operating as a tenant on Redstone Arsenal for over half a century, the Ordnance Munitions and Maintenance School was moved to Fort Lee, Virginia. Redstone Arsenal continues to host the Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA's field center for propulsion analysis and development, which developed the Saturn rocket family in the 1960s and propulsion systems for the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and '80s.

DDT pollution In 1977, the EPA issued warnings that fish and waterfowl from the Huntsville Spring Branch had shown high levels of Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in their bodies. Two years later, the EPA began to investigate how the pollutant had contaminated the water supply of the area. The findings indicated that the pollutant came from the Olin Corporation's production of the chemical on Redstone Arsenal. Lawsuits were filed against Olin Corporation by residents of Triana, as well as the United States Department of Justice. These lawsuits were eventually settled. The water near Triana was monitored by the EPA from 1982‚Äì1995 to track the levels of DDT that was still in the Huntsville Spring Branch. During that time, the amount of DDT in the water was reduced by 97%. The EPA now considers the physical cleanup process for the site to be complete. Despite this, it is still on the Agency's Superfund list.

Phillips High School The local high school is Phillips High School, home of the Bears. The original wooden frame school building across the highway from the present location of Phillips School held grades 1-9. This building caught fire around Christmas of 1925. Local churches provided temporary space for the teachers and pupils. Mrs. John Robert Phillips graciously donated land for a new school on April 16, 1926. Her husband, who died in April 1925, wanted the addition of a high school. The community pulled together with its volunteer labor and donated timber from virgin pines in Bear Creek. Members of the community sacrificed time and money in their participation with the construction of the new Phillips School. Logging was done by wagon and hauled to Veal's sawmill. Brick arrived by rail and was transported by wagon to the site. McKinley Campbell, assisted by his brother, was the contractor for the new facility. The first graduation was held at Phillips High School in 1929. Agricultural and home economics (aka Family and Consumer Sciences) departments were added in 1935 and housed near the present location of the cafeteria. The football field was located behind the main building, which was later replaced in 1969. On September 2, 2003, the Phillips football field (James E. Glass Stadium) was named after Coach James E. Glass in honor of the dedication he has given to the football team and school throughout the years. The football field was the first football field in the state of Alabama to be lighted, which took place in the fall of 1933. The original lights brightened the football field until the 2010 season, when a grant for new lights was awarded to both the football and baseball facilities of the school. Phillips High School has won four state championships in sports. This includes back-to-back state titles in 1985 and 1986 in girls varsity basketball, followed in 2001 by girls volleyball.

History The present Town of Brilliant was incorporated in 1927http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-3490 as Boston, Alabama and was named for the City of Boston, Massachusetts and in part for early settlers of the area, the Bostick family. In the late part of the 19th century, the discovery of coal led to the development of the Brilliant Coal Company, which was located adjacent to the town of Boston. The Brilliant Coal Company served as a catalyst for growth for the area and provided ample employment for more than 50 years. At the turn of the 20th century, the Brilliant and Boston area was the most densely populated part of Marion County. In 1957 due to declines in industry and population the post office at Boston, Alabama was absorbed into the Brilliant, Alabama post office. The history of Boston, Alabama changed forever with the passage of Act 284 by the Alabama Legislature, which changed the name of the town of Boston to Brilliant. By the end of the 1950s The Brilliant Coal Company had shuttered its mining operations, however several smaller mining operations were in business around the area until the early 1990s. From 1987 until 2000 the town was home to Brilliant Homes Ltd. a manufacturer of mobile homes. The company was acquired by American Homestar Corporation of League City, Texas in 1997.

As of the 2010 census, the population of the city was 21,160 and it is the largest city in Marshall County. History The area which today includes Albertville was inhabited by the Cherokee Indians until their removal to Oklahoma in the 1830s. It was, however, near the territory of the Creek nation, and several major trails which afforded communication (or military action) between the two nations crossed the area. It is believed to have been crossed by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto during his expeditions in 1540. During the American Civil War, the area around Albertville was the scene of several mid-level clashes between Union and Confederate forces. The first non-indigenous settlement in what is today Albertville began in the 1850s, and the settlement was named for Thomas A. Albert, an early settler who moved from Georgia and was a town leader until his death in 1876. The city was incorporated in 1891. A post office was established in 1910.Foscue, Virginia.

Guntersville is located at the southernmost point of the Tennessee River on Lake Guntersville, formed by the Guntersville Dam (built by the Tennessee Valley Authority). Geologically, the lake occupies a southern extension of Sequatchie Valley, which continues south as Browns Valley. History Guntersville was founded by John Gunter (1765‚Äì1835), the great-grandfather of American humorist Will Rogers. John's own great-great-grandfather, of Welsh-English descent, had emigrated to the New World in 1644. John Gunter was the wealthy owner of a salt mine in the early 19th century. In order to obtain more land to mine, John struck a deal with the Cherokee tribe that inhabited the area to use in his household as servants. As part of the deal, John married the daughter (Ghe-No-He-Li, aka Katy and Cathrine) of the tribe's chief (Chief Bushyhead of the Paint Clan) and agreed to give salt to the tribe. A town sprung up next to the mine and was named after Gunter. The town of Guntersville puts on a festival every July to celebrate Will Rogers, this festival involves many activities of interest to Will Rogers. Initially incorporated as Gunter's Landing in 1848, it won the contest to become county seat from Warrenton (which had been the seat since 1841). It formally changed its name to Guntersville in 1854.http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-2531 The United States Navy began operating a fleet of gunboats on the Tennessee River in late 1864. Confederate troops mounted a spirited defense of the river from Guntersville. In January 1865, the USS General Grant attempted to destroy the town in retaliation. For much of the 20th century, the economy of Guntersville revolved around cotton processing, especially with the Saratoga Victory Mill. Guntersville sits on a 69,000 acre lake, Lake Guntersville, that is the biggest lake in Alabama. The lake is maintained and managed by the Tennessee Valley Authority. Bass anglers from around the country recognize this lake as one of the best in the country. Researchers have put this lake as the third best bass fishing lake in America. Guntersville has one school system in the town which is made up of four schools; Guntersville Elementary School (Kindergarten-2nd grade), Cherokee Elementary School (3rd‚Äì5th grade), Guntersville Middle School (6th‚Äì8th grade), and Guntersville High School (9th‚Äì12th grade).

Bayou La Batre is a fishing village with a seafood- processing harbor for fishing boats and shrimp boats. The local chamber of commerce has described the city as the \\"Seafood Capitol of Alabama\\" for packaging seafood from hundreds of fishing boats. Bayou La Batre was the first permanent settlement on the south Mobile County mainland and was founded in 1786, when French-born Joseph Bouzage (Bosarge) [1733-1795] was awarded a Spanish land grant on the West Bank of the bayou (see history below). The modern City of Bayou La Batre was incorporated in 1955. Bayou La Batre was featured in the 1994 film Forrest Gump and the book upon which it is based. In April 2005, Disney Studios launched a secretly built pirate ship, the Black Pearl, out of Bayou La Batre for filming sequels to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.. Bayou La Batre's seafood industry also serves as a centerpiece for the History channel's reality documentary series Big Shrimpin'.

A fishing boat at the dock As part of the French settlement of the Gulf Coast, the bayou was originally called \\"Riviere D'Erbane\\" and acquired the present name from the French-maintained battery of artillery on the west bank (\\"bayou of the battery\\"). Bayou La Batre was the first permanent settlement on the south Mobile County mainland and was founded in 1786, when Joseph Bouzage (Bosarge) [1733-95] moved into the area and was awarded a Spanish land grant on the bayou's west bank.

On September 7, the Hurricane Katrina Update for libraries affected by the storm indicated that the Bayou La Batre Public Library (then known as Mose Hudson Tapia Public Library) had been destroyed. Students from the Alba Middle School documented the destruction through a series of photos that were exhibited at various venues in Alabama and the Chicago, Illinois region. Some of these were published in a book titled Eyes of the Storm: A Community Survives after Katrina (). Immediately following the hurricane a group of high school students from Sierra High School in Truckee, California adopted the city of Bayou La Batre. They sent roughly $15,000, supplies, and 15 students to help rebuild homes. Students gathered donations, sold raffle tickets, and filled their school's gym with supplies from bedding and clothes to basic household items. The school also set up a pen pal program with the students of the nearby school in Bayou La Batre. In October 2005, seven weeks after Hurricane Katrina, Bayou La Batre was adopted by the City of Santa Monica, California (see: \\"Santa Monica Pier\\") to assist in clean-up activities. \\"News Release - 10/20/2005 - City of Santa Monica\\" (help after Hurricane Katrina), Santa Monica, CA, 2005, webpage: SMgov-news-051020: states \\"location for the Bubba Gump scenes in the movie \\"Forrest Gump\\"...\\" The Santa Monica City Council approved loaning Bayou La Batre 18 vehicles, including six pickups, two trucks with large cranes, utility vehicles with smaller cranes, a dump truck, street sweepers, a riding lawnmower, and six chainsaws. The equipment was used to help remove debris and fishing boats from downtown; however, the larger shrimp boats that were washed into the surrounding woods by the flood waters remain there today. Shipbuilding Bayou La Batre is a center for shipbuilding. The shipyards are owned and operated mainly by local families such as Gazzier Marine Services, Metal Shark (formerly Horizon Shipbuilding), Steiner Ship Yard, Rodriguez Boat Builders, Master Boat Builders, Williams Fabrication, and Landry Boat Works. People from all over the world including the United States, South America, and Africa have boats built in Bayou La Batre frequently. In 2005, Steiner Ship Yard was asked by Walt Disney Studios to build a pirate ship, the Black Pearl; the pitch-black ship was actually a huge wooden prop built on top of a modern 96-foot-long steel utility boat. Crews sailed the ship out of the bayou to the Caribbean for the filming of sequels to Disney's 2003 film \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\\".

Alba Middle (which was in great part located in portable classrooms and was a part of the high School campus, as was Grand Bay Middle) took over the high school building, greatly relieving overcrowding. Similarly, the Alba Elementary Campus which shared land with the middle school, while being mostly autonomous, also became part of Alba Middle School. Alba and Grand Bay Middle are the focal point of bus routes for all school buses for Bryant High, those buses shared in grades 6-12 as a cost-saving effort to avoid overlapping routes for the separate schools. In December 2007, a new library was opened to serve the area's Asian-American community. The library is located on Wintzell Avenue in the Bayou La Batre office of Boat People SOS, a national group that assists Vietnamese-Americans. The Mobile County Commission gave $2,500. The library will be used as a place where elderly immigrants can master computer skills, children can practice their Vietnamese after school, and day laborers can surf the Web after work.

The property was bought by Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation in 1940. It expanded with the defense buildup during World War II. It attempted to restrict the activities of Jehovahs Witnesses, it was the subject of a case that reached the Supreme Court of the United States, Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501 (1946). The court ruled that although the Chickasaw Shipyard Village was privately owned, because it functioned as a town open to the public, the right conferred on residents and visitors by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution cannot be abridged. In 1946 the village was purchased by Leedy Investment Company. It renovated housing and offered it for sale to renters. Some former residents returned to the village and bought houses. It suffered from downturns in shipbuilding, which caused the loss of jobs. Residents worked to have the village documented, and in 2004 the Chickasaw Shipyard Village Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places. =Notable person= *Ray Sawyer of the band Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show was born in Chickasaw in 1937.

At the 2010 census, the population was 3,905. It is included in the Mobile metropolitan statistical area. It is about 34 miles from the port of Mobile near the Gulf Coast. History This area was inhabited by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. By the time of European contact, the historic Choctaw and Creek people hunted in the area. The first known European explorers of this area were French in the 18th century. They learned that the land had healing herbs and mineral springs. The area was settled in 1811 and established as a jurisdiction (incorporated) in 1892. The name \\"Citronelle\\" is French and is derived from the citronella plant, which is native to the area. In the late 19th century, the town became a popular resort destination because of the climate, herbs, and healing waters. Many hotels were built to accommodate the surge of visitors. On May 4, 1865, one of the last significant Confederate armies was surrendered by Lieutenant General Richard Taylor under the \\"Surrender Oak.\\" This was the third in the series of five major surrenders of armies that ended the war. The two previous surrenders occurred at Appomattox Court House, Virginia between General Robert E. Lee and US General Ulysses S.

A living history/reenactment of the surrender occurs each year in Citronelle. The historic \\"Surrender Oak\\" no longer stands, as it was destroyed by a hurricane in 1902. In 1955, oil was discovered in the area. Today Citronelle is known as the oil capital of Alabama.Citronelle: History, Citronelle Chamber of Commerce Geology Citronelle developed on what is known as the Citronelle Dome, a salt dome formation that is still rising, as shown by the centrifugal drainage of streams away from the center. In 1955 oil was discovered in this geologic structure at a greater depth than had previously been considered as feasible. The Citronelle Dome was developed as among the first of many \\"deep\\" oil fields.

It incorporated in 1988. The population was 1,238 at the 2010 census. The town is included in the Mobile metropolitan area. The island (originally named Massacre Island) was renamed for Louis XIV of France's great-grandson and heir, the dauphin, the future Louis XV of France. The name of the island is often mistaken as Dolphin Island; the word dauphin is French for dolphin, but historically, the term was used as the title of the heir apparent to the French monarch. The island is one of the Mississippi‚ÄìAlabama barrier islands, with the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and the Mississippi Sound and Mobile Bay to the north. The island's eastern end helps define the mouth of Mobile Bay.

Although the island has several bird sanctuaries, the main one is the Audubon Bird Sanctuary. Because Dauphin Island is the first land encountered by many birds as they migrate north from South America, many species can be found resting there before continuing their journey.

Shell Mound Park, along the Island's northern shore, is administered by Alabama Marine Resources Division. View of the southeastern shore of the island. In 1519, the Spanish explorer Alonso √Ålvarez de Pineda was the first documented European to visit, staying long enough to map the island with remarkable accuracy. The island's French history began on January 31, 1699, when the explorer Pierre Le Moyne, sieur d'Iberville, one of the founders of French Louisiana, arrived at Mobile Bay, and anchored near the island on his way to explore the mouth of the Mississippi River. D'Iberville mistakenly named it √éle du Massacre (Massacre Island) because of a large pile of human skeletons discovered there. In reality, the site was a Mississippian burial mound which had been broken open by a hurricane, not a massacre site; however, the dramatic misnomer stuck. D'Iberville later established a port for Fort Louis de La Louisiane on the island due to its abundant timber, reliable supply of fresh water, and deep- water harbor. The settlement consisted of a fort, a chapel, government-owned warehouses, and residences. Inside Shell Mound Park The island served as a major trading depot where goods from Saint-Domingue (Haiti), Mexico, Cuba and France were unloaded and a short-lived fur trade was conducted. Before a channel was dredged, Mobile Bay was too shallow and its sandbars too treacherous for ocean-going vessels to travel up the bay and Mobile River to Fort Louis de La Louisiane. Thus, smaller boats carried the cargo within Mobile Bay to and from Dauphin Island. In 1719 the first African slaves of Alabama arrived at Dauphin Island. [9] After the French and Indian war known as the Seven Years' War ended in 1763, the island was ceded to the British. After the American Revolutionary War, the territory again came under Spanish jurisdiction, being part of the Province of West Florida until 1812. In 1795 after the Treaty of San Lorenzo was signed between Spain and the United States, new settlers began migrating to Alabama from Virginia, North & South Carolina and Georgia. [9] In 1805, the Chickasaw, Cherokee and Choctaw were forced to cede their lands to the government. The Creek Tribes aggressively fought to hold their lands, but eventually were forced to cede in 1813. Fort Gaines on the eastern tip of the island was built between 1821 and 1848. It was occupied by Confederate forces in 1861 and captured by the Union Army during the Battle of Mobile Bay. The phrase, \\"Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead,\\" was supposedly spoken by U. S. Admiral David Farragut just a few hundred yards from Dauphin Island's shore. Typical elevated house on Dauphin Island The first Sand Island Light, authorized in 1834, was replaced by a structure high, at a cost of $35,000, that was destroyed by Confederate forces. The present lighthouse (1873; in use until 1970), has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its ownership was recently transferred from the Department of Interior to the town of Dauphin Island.

Hurricanes  Over the centuries, many hurricanes have struck the island. Some recent storms include: * In 1969, Hurricane Camille flooded 70% of the island, and was the worst storm to strike the area until Hurricane Frederic. * In 1979, Hurricane Frederic (September 12, 1979) destroyed the bridge to the mainland, which had been opened in 1955. * In 1985, Hurricane Elena brought wind gusts of over to the island. * In 1997, Hurricane Danny caused extensive flooding on the east end of the island. * In 1998, Hurricane Georges destroyed 41 houses on the island. * In 2004, Hurricane Ivan caused nearly one-fourth of the island to be covered with approximately two feet of water. * On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina brought damage to parts of Dauphin Island. Some homes on the west end of the island were destroyed, and the Katrina Cut was formed as a channel splitting off the western part. However, most areas of the Central and East end of the island experienced little flooding from the storm surge. The approach road to the island fared better than expected. The damage to most East End beachfront homes was limited to decks, stairs and storage buildings. In DeSoto Landing, a gated gulf-front subdivision on Dauphin Island, the main homes had no water entering the homes unless a window or roof system failed; many avoided surge waters entirely. Damage was limited due to Sand Island (Pelican Island), a large sandbar south of DeSoto Landing which broke the force of battering waves. An oil drilling platform grounded near the island as the hurricane passed by. It was identified by its owners, Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., as the Ocean Warwick, pushed nearly from its original location by the hurricane. * Beginning on September 14, 2020, storm surge from offshore Hurricane Sally began flooding the island. Tourist attractions The old walled Fort Gaines is on the east end of Dauphin Island. A ferry from nearby Fort Morgan in Gulf Shores brings both vehicles and pedestrians to the island. One of the closest attractions to the ferry dock is The Estuarium, a fresh- and saltwater aquarium highlighting species native to Alabama.

Cogon Grass, a highly-invasive rhizome, first introduced to the area as packing material in satsuma trees imported from Asia, has now become a serious Southeastern agricultural problem. In 1993, the old Grand Bay State Bank building became the temporary site of the El Cazador Museum, and held treasure from the El Cazador.

As the community and surrounding area changed during World War II, the annual celebration was discontinued. It was revived in 1973 by the Grand Bay Junior Chamber of Commerce. Currently, it is sponsored by the Grand Bay Independent Order of Odd Fellows #73. It is currently held at the Odd Fellows Festival Park and local baseball park just north of U.S. Highway 90 on the west side of Grand Bay. It begins on July 3 from 3-7 p.m. and continues on July 4 from 8 a.m. and concludes at 4 p.m. The website for the Grand Bay Watermelon Festival is: www.grandbaywatermelonfestival.org.  Pecans and fruit Much of the rural land around Grand Bay is planted in pecan trees, another reminder of the Grand Bay Land Company days. Many of the pecan orchards have been converted from agricultural production for use as residential home sites. However, pecan production is still an important business and provides supplemental income to residents who work in nonagricultural jobs. In addition, the area has become home to a large peach business and satsumas, once destroyed by freezing temperatures, have now returned to commercial production in a more weather-hardy variety. Grand Bay Watermelons, however, remain the produce most identified with the community. Community center The Grand Bay-St. Elmo Community Center is a multi-use facility located on the east side of Grand Bay at 11610 Highway 90. The building is near the intersection of Highway 90 and Ramsay Road Extension. Constructed in 2005, the center operates on a non-profit basis. Facilities are available for rent to the public. The Center is located on the site of the former Grand Bay Elementary School for Colored, a racially segregated elementary school established in 1919. Economy The business section of Grand Bay stretches east to west along Highway 90 for about two miles from Festival Park Road on the west side to Highway 188 on the east, and north to south along Grand Bay Wilmer Road from Highway 90 to Old Pascagoula Road. Recent development has centered on two areas, primarily at the intersection of Grand Bay-Wilmer Road and US 90, and at the intersection of Grand Bay-Wilmer Road and Interstate 10.

The film was directed by Milo≈° Forman and also features Danny DeVito, Courtney Love, and Paul Giamatti. The story traces Kaufman's steps from childhood through the comedy clubs and television appearances that made him famous, including his memorable appearances on Saturday Night Live, Late Night with David Letterman, Fridays, and his role as Latka Gravas on the sitcom Taxi, which was popular among viewers but disruptive for Kaufman's co-stars. The film pays particular attention to the various inside jokes, scams, put-ons, and happenings for which Kaufman was famous, most significantly his long-running feud with wrestler Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler and his portrayal of the bawdy lounge singer Tony Clifton. It was released on December 22, 1999 in US and May 5, 2000 in UK by Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures in some markets, although the film was unsuccessful commercially and received mixed reviews, Carrey received critical acclaim for his performance and won a Golden Globe, his second in a row after his award for The Truman Show. His nomination was in the Musical/Comedy category. The documentary Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond was released in 2017 and chronicles Carrey's performance as Kaufman in the film, a performance he maintained during much of the film's production. Plot Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. Kaufman catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs him as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti- humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the Taxi set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the set. He relates to Shapiro that he never knows exactly how to entertain an audience \\"short of faking my own death or setting the theater on fire.\\" Kaufman decides to become a professional wrestler ‚Äî but to emphasize the \\"villain\\" angle, he will wrestle only women (hired actresses) and then berate them after winning, declaring himself \\"Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion.\\" He becomes smitten with one woman he wrestles, Lynne Margulies, and they begin a romantic relationship. Problems arise when, during an appearance on ABC's live TV comedy show Fridays, Kaufman refuses to speak his lines. Kaufman feuds publicly with Jerry Lawler, a male professional wrestler, who challenges him to a \\"real wrestling match\\", which Kaufman accepts. Lawler easily overpowers and appears to seriously injure Kaufman. Lawler and an injured Kaufman (wearing a neck brace) appear on NBC's Late Night with David Letterman, ostensibly to call a truce, but Lawler insults Kaufman, who spews a vicious tirade of epithets and throws coffee at the wrestler. It is later revealed that Kaufman and Lawler were in fact good friends and staged the entire feud, but Kaufman pays a price when he is banned from SNL by a vote of audience members, weary of his wrestling antics. Shapiro advises Kaufman and Lawler not to work together again, and later calls Kaufman to inform him that Taxi has been canceled. After a show at a comedy club, Kaufman calls together Lynne, Zmuda, and Shapiro to disclose that he has been diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer and may die soon. They aren't sure whether to believe this, thinking it could be yet another stunt, with Zmuda actually believing a fake death would be a fantastic prank. With little time to live, Kaufman gets a booking at Carnegie Hall, his dream venue. The performance is a memorable success, culminating with Kaufman inviting the entire audience out for milk and cookies. As his health deteriorates, a desperate Kaufman heads to the Philippines to seek a medical miracle through psychic surgery only to find it a hoax, laughing at the irony. He dies soon after. At Kaufman's funeral, friends and loved ones sing along to \\"This Friendly World\\" with a video of Kaufman. One year later, in 1985, Clifton appears at Kaufman's tribute at The Comedy Store's main stage, performing \\"I Will Survive\\". Zmuda watches in the audience.

Danny DeVito, who was also in the cast of Taxi, co-starred in the film and did not appear as himself. Many of Kaufman's other real-life friends and co-stars also appear in the film (although not all as themselves), including Zmuda, Shapiro, Margulies, David Letterman, Paul Shaffer, professional wrestler Jerry Lawler, wrestling announcers Jim Ross and Lance Russell, The Improv founder Budd Friedman, Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels, and actors Vincent Schiavelli and Chad Whitson.allmovie.com - Man on the Moon by Mark Deming. Retrieved 31 March 2007. Michael Richards is played by Norm Macdonald in a recreation of the Fridays show skit. According to Jerry Lawler's autobiography It's Good to be the King ... sometimes, WCW wrestler Glenn Gilbertti, better known to wrestling fans as Disco Inferno, was considered for the role of Lawler. Production Man on the Moon was shot in Los Angeles in the winter of 1998. The film's production is notable for Carrey's rigid method acting, staying in- character as Kaufman both on and off the set for the duration of production. Carrey's adherence to the role reached the extent where he would develop unscripted tics and habits that were previously characteristic of Kaufman himself. Among other examples, Courtney Love noted how Carrey would stuff his clothing with Limburger cheese on the set when playing Kaufman's Tony Clifton character in the film, something Kaufman had done in his own performances of the character. A documentary, Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond, was released in November 2017. Using behind-the-scenes footage, the documentary covers the production of Man on the Moon with a particular focus on Carrey's method- acting as Kaufman. Soundtrack The soundtrack for the film was written by rock band R.E.M., whose 1992 song \\"Man on the Moon\\" (originally written in honor of Kaufman) gave the film its title. The soundtrack also included the Grammy-nominated song \\"The Great Beyond\\", which remains the band's highest- charting single in the United Kingdom. Historical accuracy The film makes a few changes to Kaufman's life story. As Kaufman (played by Carrey) explains in the prologue, \\"All the most important things in my life are changed around and mixed up for dramatic purposes.\\" The famous Carnegie Hall \\"milk and cookies\\" performance, portrayed in the film as one of his last performances after being diagnosed with cancer, had in fact occurred in 1979, five years before Kaufman's death and well before his diagnosis. Also, the film is deliberately ambiguous over whether Kaufman actually died or if his death was a hoax as some fans believe. The film implies that Carol Kane was a member of the Taxi cast during the show's first season, which in real life was 1978‚Äì79. In actuality, Kane did not make her first appearance on the series until the episode \\"Guess Who's Coming for Brefnish\\", which first aired on ABC in January 1980 during the show's second season. The film implies that Taxi was canceled only once. However, the show went on for one more season on NBC. Other inaccuracies include scenes based around SNL, specifically the first episode's host. Also, the scene where Lorne Michaels asks the home viewing audience to vote Kaufman off the show happened in 1982, two years after Michaels left the show as executive producer and Dick Ebersol took over.Shales, Tom, and James Andrew Miller. (2002). Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live. Boston, MA: Little, Brown. . After its release, the film attracted some criticism over various events in Kaufman's life that were left out. Max Allan Collins maintained that the filmmakers did not understand Kaufman, and that the film \\"does not give Kaufman the credit for his genius, that he had a complete intellectual grasp of what he was up to and a showman's instincts for how to play an audience.\\"'Man on the Moon' Misses Kaufman by Max Allan Collins. 6 January 2000. Accessed 31 March 2007. Significantly, these critics included Kaufman's own father Stanley, who was displeased that little of Andy's early life (before show business) and early career were portrayed. Sam Simon, executive producer on Taxi, stated in a 2013 interview with Marc Maron for the WTF with Marc Maron podcast that the portrayal of Andy on the show was \\"a complete fiction,\\" that Kaufman was \\"completely professional\\" and that he \\"told you Tony Clifton was him.\\" Simon also stated that sources for these stories were mostly from Bob Zmuda and a \\"little bit of press and hype,\\" but conceded that Kaufman would have \\"loved\\" Zmuda's version of events. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 63% based on 119 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Jim Carrey is eerily dead-on in his portrayal of Andy Kaufman, which helps to elevate Man on the Moon above the script's formulaic biopic cliches.\\"Rotten Tomatoes - Man on the Moon Retrieved March 31, 2007 Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 58 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert wrote for the Chicago Sun Times: Man on the Moon ended a string of Jim Carrey films that had very successful opening weekends, and grossed just $47 million against a budget of $82 million.Box Office Guru - Weekend Box Office (December 24 - 26, 1999) Retrieved 31 March 2007, Although the film received mixed reviews from critics, they were near unanimous in their praise for Jim Carrey's portrayal of Andy Kaufman.

As of the 2010 census, the population of the city is 13,405. It is a part of the Mobile metropolitan area. Saraland is the third largest city in Mobile County. Geography Saraland is located at (30.825186, -88.091932). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.50%) is water.  History  The land area that was to become the present-day Saraland, was included in a Spanish land grant to Don Diego Alvarez. Hence, descendants of Alvarez were the ones to give the community its first name: Alvarez Station. Later land squatters moved into the area and were able, legally, in 1800 to begin purchasing property. In 1807, a land office was opened in St. Stephens to handle all land transactions. Some of the pioneer families who seized the opportunity to buy up sections were named Alvarez, Rice, Hartley, Moore, LaCoste, Williams, Tool and Cleveland. Ultimately, Alvarez Station was called Cleveland Station. The present name of the city is reported to have been given by C.J. DeWitt, a retired minister editor who moved south in 1890 for health reasons. He opened the first post office on the Southern Railroad in 1895. The community is purported to be the namesake of his beloved wife, Sara. Saraland was sparsely populated during the first part of the 20th century, until an industrial and population boom occurred in neighboring Mobile. Northward expansion of Mobile in the 1940s and 50s brought about the incorporation of Saraland in 1957. At the time of incorporation, the city reported only 125 residents. By the 1960 U.S. Census, annexations had swelled the population to 4,595. In 1980, census figures cited 9,844 Saraland residents. Current census records report that as of 2017, Saraland's population is estimated to have grown to 14,576. The worst rail disaster in the history of Amtrak occurred near Saraland on Big Bayou Canot on September 22, 1993. At approximately 2:53 AM, Amtrak's Sunset Limited train, powered by three locomotives, and en route from Los Angeles, California to Miami, Florida with 220 passengers and crew aboard, crossed the Bayou Canot bridge at high speed and derailed at a kink in the track caused by a barge captain who rammed the bridge by making a wrong turn in the waterway, and failed to report the accident. Forty-seven people, of whom 42 were passengers, were killed, many by drowning, others by fire. Much of the rescue efforts were average citizens of the community who journeyed out in the early morning hours in small fishing boats to help at the scene.

History What would become Frisco City started out as two mid-19th century communities named Lufkin and Snider. It initially incorporated as the town of Jones Mill in 1909. It was named for the owner of the local grist mill. Four years later on November 4, 1913, the town was renamed as Roy for Roy Megargel, owner of the Gulf, Florida, and Alabama Railroad (GFA). The renaming was done on the Me lplcondition that \\"Roy\\" would receive a rail line to the Town. When Megargel failed to deliver on his promise, the town reverted to its name of Jones Mill in 1919 (also referred to as Jones Mills plural). Megargel failed to keep his name on Jones Mill, but later received a community named for him, that of Megargel, a census-designated place . In 1925, the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad bought the GFA Railroad and agreed to complete what Megargel was not able to. In 1928, the line was completed, and in gratitude, the town formally renamed itself as Frisco City (taken from San Francisco).http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-3052 =Climate= Climate is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year.

He is best known as the lead vocalist of the American rock band Incubus. Early life Boyd graduated from Calabasas High School in 1994 and attended Moorpark College for two years before committing to Incubus. Brandon grew up in Calabasas, California with Ricky Taylor who inspired him to write music. His parents, Priscilla \\"Dolly\\" Wiseman and Charles Boyd, both of whom had experience in entertainment, had nurtured his artistic side since he was a child. Other notable family members include his younger brother, Jason Boyd, the former lead singer of the band Audiovent, his cousin Berto Boyd, an accomplished Flamenco guitarist and composer, as well as cousin Sam Boyd, a professional motocross rider. In an interview, Brandon explained that he had \\"yet to stumble across his best work\\" because he lacked the ability to read music. Incubus Boyd designed concert fliers that advertised Incubus' early performances. He occasionally plays guitar during live performances and is known for bringing unusual instruments into his songs, such as the didgeridoo and djembe. Boyd's voice was part of what enticed Sony's Epic/Immortal Records, along with the self-released album Fungus Amongus. The band was signed in 1996. Incubus' first two releases on the label, Enjoy Incubus and S.C.I.E.N.C.E. went largely unnoticed in the mainstream, but subsequent releases Make Yourself and Morning View were commercial successes. Boyd attracted a large number of female fans. In a 2001 interview, Spin wrote \\"Considering his androgynous beauty and sweet demeanor, plus Incubus' kid-tested/mother-approved guitar rock, it's no surprise he's MTV's newest weapon of mass heartbreak. Girls scream for him to take his shirt off at Incubus shows (he usually obliges), and Teen People recently voted him one of 'The Hottest Guys in Music.' His sensitive-guy appeal sets him apart from today's testosterone-drunk rock\\".SPIN Nov 2001, Vol. 17, No. 11 The band's 2004 release A Crow Left of the Murder... has continued their success, nominating the band for Best Hard Rock Performance in the 2005 Grammy Awards. On November 28, 2006, the band released Light Grenades. On June 16, 2009, Incubus released a greatest hits album titled Monuments and Melodies. In 2011 Incubus finished their seventh studio album If Not Now, When?, released on July 12, 2011, followed by a tour. It was their final release under Sony. Boyd performing with Incubus in 2007. On December 13, 2014 they performed their upcoming single entitled \\"Trust Fall\\" at KROQ. They announced the release of two EP's in 2015 with the first, Trust Fall, released on March 24, 2015 through Island Records. On February 5, 2015, the single \\"Absolution Calling\\" was released. Two years later, in February 2017, Boyd and Incubus teamed with Skrillex on a collaboration that was released under the title \\"8\\" in April, 2017. Literature and fine art Although Boyd had been drawing his entire life, between 2003 and 2008 he focused more seriously on creating fine art, specifically painting. During this time he participated in many different group and solo art shows, using his artwork as a means for environmental activism. September 8, 2008 marked the opening of his first solo show, \\"Ectoplasm,\\" at Mr. Musichead Gallery in Los Angeles, California. In March 2020, Boyd had planned to debut a new large-scale solo exhibit, \\"Impossible Knots,\\" at the Samuel Lynne Galleries in Dallas, Texas. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the in-person exhibit had to be postponed. On April 18, 2020, his work debuted online via a virtual exhibition preview on Instagram LIVE. This online debut will be followed by the in-person exhibition in Fall 2020 or Spring 2021. Boyd released a card-matching game called \\"Two Doors/Deux Portes,\\" based on a series of his watercolor paintings. Boyd has written and curated three books, each of which comprise his personal illustrations, photography, song lyrics, and additional thoughts and writings. His books are White Fluffy Clouds (2003), From the Murks of the Sultry Abyss (2007), and So the Echo (2013), all published under his book imprint, Endophasia Publications. So the Echo \\"visually weaves\\" the years that Boyd spent honing his craft and his talents, both in music and art.  Charity and activism  In the spring of 2011, Boyd made a large mural at the Hurley Space Gallery in order to raise awareness about single use plastics and their harmful effects on the world's oceans. Boyd is involved with many organizations and charitable causes and in 2003, along with his Incubus bandmates, he founded the 501(c)(3) non-profit The Make Yourself Foundation, which has raised over $1.4 million for various philanthropic causes locally and globally. The organization has awarded grant funding to over 60 nonprofit organizations. Jesus Christ Superstar Arena Spectacular 2014 Boyd was selected to play the role of Judas Iscariot for the North American arena tour of Andrew Lloyd Webber's rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. He was to play the role starting June 9 through August 17. On May 31, the tour was canceled. Solo career On July 6, 2010, Boyd announced that his debut solo album, The Wild Trapeze was released. On June 21, 2010, a music video for Boyd's first single from The Wild Trapeze, entitled \\"Runaway Train,\\" was released online. A second music video was released for the album, for the song \\"Last Night a Passenger\\" in October 2010. On January 18, 2013 Brandon announced his new band, Sons of the Sea. With Incubus on indefinite hiatus, Sons of the Sea will tour 2013 and 2014. On May 29, 2013 Brandon released a teaser video announcing the name of the album, Sons of the Sea. That same year, he embarked on a book-signing tour of the Northeast to coincide with his latest publication \\"So The Echo,\\" as well as the release of \\"Sons of the Sea\\"'s eponymous record. Tattoos Boyd is known for his wide variety of tattoos. On his forearms he carries the widely known mantra Om Mani Padme Hum, referring to the qualities of generosity, ethics, patience, diligence, renunciation and wisdom. Underneath that is a koi fish in red ink by Lars Johansson. On the inside of his right arm he has several tattoos, one once again incorporating the Tibetan mantra. Following the release of their album \\"A Crow Left of the Murder,\\" he got an elaborate back tattoo featuring the common image of the All Seeing-Eye embedded in a pyramid. He also has a tattoo of the Eye of Horus on his right ankle. Other tattoos include his parents' names (Priscilla and Charles) on his forearms, an owl on his back, one teardrop on his index finger on both hands, and a picture inspired by Aubrey Beardsley's famous art, \\"The Peacock Skirt\\", on his left arm.

Guggenheim Museum, often referred to as The Guggenheim, is an art museum located at 1071 Fifth Avenue on the corner of East 89th Street in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. It is the permanent home of a continuously expanding collection of Impressionist, Post- Impressionist, early Modern, and contemporary art and also features special exhibitions throughout the year. The museum was established by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1939 as the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, under the guidance of its first director, Hilla von Rebay. It adopted its current name in 1952, three years after the death of its founder Solomon R. Guggenheim. In 1959, the museum moved from rented space to its current building, a landmark work of 20th-century architecture designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The cylindrical building, wider at the top than at the bottom, was conceived as a \\"temple of the spirit\\". Its unique ramp gallery extends up from ground level in a long, continuous spiral along the outer edges of the building to end just under the ceiling skylight. The building underwent extensive expansion and renovations in 1992 when an adjoining tower was built, and from 2005 to 2008. The museum's collection has grown over eight decades and is founded upon several important private collections, beginning with that of Solomon R. Guggenheim. The collection is shared with sister museums in Bilbao, Spain and elsewhere. In 2013, nearly 1.2 million people visited the museum, and it hosted the most popular exhibition in New York City.\\"Top 100 Art Museum Attendance\\", The Art Newspaper, 2014, pp. 11 and 15, accessed July 8, 2014.

Guggenheim completely changed his collecting strategy, turning to the work of Wassily Kandinsky, among others. He began to display his collection to the public at his apartment in the Plaza Hotel in New York City.\\"Biography: Solomon R. Guggenheim\\", Art of Tomorrow: Hilla Rebay and Solomon R.

Under Rebay's guidance, Guggenheim sought to include in the collection the most important examples of non-objective art available at the time by early modernists such as Rudolf Bauer, Rebay, Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, Marc Chagall, Robert Delaunay, Fernand L√©ger, Amedeo Modigliani and Pablo Picasso.Calnek, Anthony, et al. The Guggenheim Collection, pp. 39‚Äì40, New York: The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, 2006 By the early 1940s, the foundation had accumulated such a large collection of avant-garde paintings that the need for a permanent museum building had become apparent. In 1943, Rebay and Guggenheim wrote a letter to Frank Lloyd Wright asking him to design a structure to house and display the collection. Wright accepted the opportunity to experiment with his organic style in an urban setting. It took him 15 years, 700 sketches, and six sets of working drawings to create the museum. In 1948, the collection was greatly expanded through the purchase of art dealer Karl Nierendorf's estate of some 730 objects, notably German expressionist paintings. By that time, the foundation's collection included a broad spectrum of expressionist and surrealist works, including paintings by Paul Klee, Oskar Kokoschka and Joan Mir√≥.\\"Guggenheim Museum New York\\", Encyclopedia of Art, visual-arts-cork.com. Retrieved April 18, 2012. After Guggenheim's death in 1949, members of the Guggenheim family who sat on the foundation's board of directors had personal and philosophical differences with Rebay, and in 1952 she resigned as director of the museum.\\"Biography: Hilla Rebay\\", Art of Tomorrow: Hilla Rebay and Solomon R.

Nevertheless, she left a portion of her personal collection to the foundation in her will, including works by Kandinsky, Klee, Alexander Calder, Albert Gleizes, Mondrian and Kurt Schwitters. The museum was renamed the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1952. = Design = Rebay conceived of the space as a \\"temple of the spirit\\" that would facilitate a new way of looking at the modern pieces in the collection. She wrote to Wright that \\"each of these great masterpieces should be organized into space, and only you ... would test the possibilities to do so. ... I want a temple of spirit, a monument!\\"The Guggenheim: Frank Lloyd Wright and the Making of the Modern Museum, pp. 217‚Äì18, New York: Guggenheim Museum Publications, 2009 The critic Paul Goldberger later wrote that, before Wright's modernist building, \\"there were only two common models for museum design: Beaux-arts Palace ... and the International Style Pavilion.\\"\\"The Secret Life of Buildings: New York Public Library and Guggenheim Museum\\", Colebrook Bosson Saunders Products Ltd.. Retrieved March 21, 2012. Goldberger thought the building a catalyst for change, making it \\"socially and culturally acceptable for an architect to design a highly expressive, intensely personal museum. In this sense almost every museum of our time is a child of the Guggenheim.\\" The museum's atrium From 1943 to early 1944, Wright produced four different sketches for the initial design. While one of the plans (scheme C) had a hexagonal shape and level floors for the galleries, all the others had circular schemes and used a ramp continuing around the building. He had experimented with the ramp design in 1948 at the V. C. Morris Gift Shop in San Francisco and on the house he completed for his son in 1952, the David and Gladys Wright House in Arizona. Wright's original concept was called an inverted \\"ziggurat\\", because it resembled the steep steps on the ziggurats built in ancient Mesopotamia. His design dispensed with the conventional approach to museum layout, in which visitors are led through a series of interconnected rooms and forced to retrace their steps when exiting. Wright's plan was for the museum guests to ride to the top of the building by elevator, to descend at a leisurely pace along the gentle slope of the continuous ramp, and to view the atrium of the building as the last work of art. The open rotunda afforded viewers the unique possibility of seeing several bays of work on different levels simultaneously and even to interact with guests on other levels.Perez, Adelyn. \\"AD Classics: Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum\\", May 18, 2010. Retrieved March 21, 2012. At the same time, before settling on the site for the museum at the corner of 89th Street and the Museum Mile section of Fifth Avenue, overlooking Central Park, Wright, Rebay and Guggenheim considered numerous locations in Manhattan, as well as in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, overlooking the Hudson River. Guggenheim felt that the site's proximity to Central Park was important; the park afforded relief from the noise, congestion and concrete of the city. Nature also provided the museum with inspiration. The building embodies Wright's attempts \\"to render the inherent plasticity of organic forms in architecture\\". The Guggenheim was to be the only museum designed by Wright. The city location required Wright to design the building in a vertical rather than a horizontal form, far different from his earlier, rural works.Since Wright was not licensed as an architect in New York, he relied on Arthur Cort Holden, of the architectural firm Holden, McLaughlin & Associates, to deal with New York City's Board of Standards and Appeals. Staircase at the Vatican Museums designed by Giuseppe Momo in 1932 The spiral design recalled a nautilus shell, with continuous spaces flowing freely one into another. Even as it embraced nature, Wright's design also expresses his take on modernist architecture's rigid geometry. Wright ascribed a symbolic meaning to the building's shapes. He explained, \\"these geometric forms suggest certain human ideas, moods, sentiments ‚Äì as for instance: the circle, infinity; the triangle, structural unity; the spiral, organic progress; the square, integrity.\\"Rudenstine, Angelica Zander. The Guggenheim Museum Collection: Paintings, 1880‚Äì1945, New York: Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1976, p. 204 Forms echo one another throughout: oval-shaped columns, for example, reiterate the geometry of the fountain. Circularity is the leitmotif, from the rotunda to the inlaid design of the terrazzo floors. Several architecture professors have speculated that the double spiral staircase designed by Giuseppe Momo in 1932 at the Vatican Museums was an inspiration for Wright's ramp and atrium. Jaroslav Josef Pol√≠vka assisted Wright with the structural design and managed to design the gallery ramp without perimeter columns.Jaroslav J. Pol√≠vka, \\"What it's Like to Work with Wright\\" in The Guggenheim's surface was made out of concrete to reduce the cost, inferior to the stone finish that Wright had wanted. Wright proposed a red-colored exterior, which was never realized.Bianchini, Riccardo. \\"The Guggenheim, an American revolution\\", inexhibit.com, 2014, accessed July 5, 2014. The small rotunda (or \\"Monitor building\\", as Wright called it) next to the large rotunda was intended to house apartments for Rebay and Guggenheim but instead became offices and storage space. In 1965, the second floor of the Monitor building was renovated to display the museum's growing permanent collection, and with the restoration of the museum in 1990‚Äì92, it was turned over entirely to exhibition space and christened the Thannhauser Building, in honor of one of the most important bequests to the museum. Wright's original plan for an adjoining tower, artists' studios and apartments went unrealized, largely for financial reasons, until the renovation and expansion. Also in the original construction, the main gallery skylight had been covered, which compromised Wright's carefully articulated lighting effects. This changed in 1992 when the skylight was restored to its original design. =Sweeney years and completion of construction= Museum under construction in photo taken on Nov. 12, 1957 In 1953, the foundation's collecting criteria expanded under its new director, James Johnson Sweeney. Sweeney rejected Rebay's dismissal of \\"objective\\" painting and sculpture, and he soon acquired Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi's Adam and Eve (1921), followed by works of other modernist sculptors, including Joseph Csaky, Jean Arp, Calder, Alberto Giacometti and David Smith. Sweeney reached beyond the 20th century to acquire Paul C√©zanne's Man with Crossed Arms (c. 1899). The same year, the foundation also received a gift of 28 important works from the Estate of Katherine S. Dreier, a founder of America's first collection to be called a modern art museum, the Soci√©t√© Anonyme. Dreier had been a colleague of Rebay's. The works included Little French Girl (1914‚Äì18) by Br√¢ncu»ôi, an untitled still life (1916) by Juan Gris, a bronze sculpture (1919) by Alexander Archipenko and three collages (1919‚Äì21) by German Hanoverian Dadaist Schwitters.

Prior to the opening of the museum twenty-one artists signed a letter protesting the display of their work in such a space. Historian Lewis Mumford summed up the opprobrium: > Wright has allotted the paintings and sculptures on view only as much space > as would not infringe upon his abstract composition. ...

Messer succeeded Sweeney as director of the museum (but not the foundation) in 1961 and stayed for 27 years, the longest tenure of any of the city's major arts institutions' directors. When Messer took over, the museum's ability to present art at all was still in doubt due to the challenges presented by continuous spiral ramp gallery that is both tilted and has non-vertical curved walls.Russell, John. \\"Director of Guggenheim Retiring After 27 Years\\", The New York Times, November 5, 1987.

It is difficult to properly hang paintings in the shallow, windowless exhibition niches that surround the central spiral: canvasses must be mounted raised from the wall's surface. Paintings hung slanted back would appear \\"as on the artist's easel\\". There is limited space within the niches for sculpture. Almost immediately, in 1962, Messer took a risk putting on a large exhibition that combined the Guggenheim's paintings with sculptures on loan from the Hirshhorn collection. Three-dimensional sculpture, in particular, raised \\"the problem of installing such a show in a museum bearing so close a resemblance to the circular geography of hell\\", where any vertical object appears tilted in a \\"drunken lurch\\" because the slope of the floor and the curvature of the walls could combine to produce vexing optical illusions.Canaday, John. \\"Museum Director Solves Problem; Guggenheim Official Faces Troubles of Architecture\\", The New York Times, August 17, 1962 It turned out that the combination could work well in the Guggenheim's space, but, Messer recalled that at the time, \\"I was scared. I half felt that this would be my last exhibition.\\" Messer had the foresight to prepare by staging a smaller sculpture exhibition the previous year, in which he discovered how to compensate for the space's weird geometry by constructing special plinths at a particular angle, so the pieces were not at a true vertical yet appeared to be so. In the earlier sculpture show, this trick proved impossible for one piece, an Alexander Calder mobile whose wire inevitably hung at a true plumb vertical, \\"suggesting hallucination\\" in the disorienting context of the tilted floor.

In The New York Times, critic Michael Kimmelman wrote that the sales \\"stretched the accepted rules of deaccessioning further than many American institutions have been willing to do.\\" Krens defended the action as consistent with the museum's principles, including expanding its international collection and building its \\"postwar collection to the strength of our pre-war holdings\\" and pointed out that such sales are a regular practice by museums.

This initial condition assessment included: * the removal of paint from the original surface, revealing hundreds of cracks caused over the years, primarily by seasonal temperature fluctuations; * detailed monitoring of the movement of selected cracks over 17 months; * impact-echo technology, in which sound waves are sent into the concrete and the rebound is measured to locate voids within the walls; * laser surveys of the exterior and interior surfaces, believed to be the largest laser model ever compiled; * core drilling to gather samples of the original concrete and other construction materials; and * testing of potential repair materials.Pogrebin, Robin. \\"The Restorers' Art of the Invisible\\", The New York Times, September 10, 2007, pp. E1‚Äì5. 1966 2 Cent U.S. postage stamp honoring Wright Much of the interior of the building was restored during the 1992 renovation and addition by Gwathmey Siegel and Associates Architects.

It has a spectacular position in the Alpilles mountains, set atop a rocky outcrop that is crowned with a ruined castle overlooking the plains to the south. Its name refers to its site: in Proven√ßal, a bau√ß is a rocky spur. The name bauxite (Aluminium ore) is derived from the village name when it was first discovered there by geologist Pierre Berthier in 1821. Named after the province of Provence, it has been named one of the most beautiful villages in France and has over 1.5 million visitors per year although it has only 22 residents in the upper part of the commune and 436 for the whole commune. Inhabitants of the commune are known as Baussencs or Baussenques.Inhabitants of Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne History =Prehistory= The defensive capabilities of Baux have always made it an attractive location for human habitation. Traces of habitation have been found and dated to 6000 BC. in the Costap√©ra cave which was discovered in 1928 and which houses a collective burial ground from the early Bronze Age.\\"The Alpilles and La Montagnette\\", Archaeological Map of Gaul, Vol. 13/2, 1999, p. 118 The site was used by the Celts as a fort or oppidum around the 2nd century BC. Peripheral areas or castrum developed very early as evidenced by the Tr√©ma√Ø√©.\\"The People of the Alpilles during the Iron Age\\", in The Alpilles, Encyclopedia of a Proven√ßal Mountain, P. Arcelin, p. 143 The way from the Baux oppidum to the plains north of the Alpilles was by a protohistoric way through the valley of Laval and the town of Glanon which later took the name Glanum.Y. Marcadal, \\"The oppida of the Alpilles\\", in The Alpilles, Encyclopedia of a Proven√ßal Mountain, p. 146 =Antiquity= Tr√©ma√Ø√© Bas- relief Ancient village Fen√™tre \\"Post Tenebras Lux\\" () While Protohistory was strongly marked by pastoralism and agriculture in the Alpilles, limestone was also extracted from quarries around Baux where a workshop from the end of the 2nd and early 1st centuries BC has been found. In the second part of the Iron Age (7th to 6th centuries. BC), the population was sedentary and began to build durable houses. The castrum was structured like a village with its streets and houses. The process of permanent construction was in parallel with the intensification of economic exchanges with Mediterranean traders. In exchange for luxury goods, the inhabitants of the Alpilles produced grain and achieved a state of autarky with a real trading economy. Over the following centuries the population of the Alpilles consistently decreased: the Greek colony at Arles attracted many people from across the region. =Middle Ages= In the Middle Ages the area became the stronghold of a feudal domain covering 79 towns and villages. The fortress was built from the 11th to the 13th century over seven hectares. The princes of Baux controlled Provence for many years and they gained a formidable reputation. They were said to be descended from the Biblical Magi Balthazar and their coat of arms was a silver star with sixteen branches as a reminder that, according to the Gospel, it guided the three wise men to Bethlehem. Their motto was: \\"Au hasard, Balthazar\\" (\\"To chance, Balthazar\\"). As a medieval stronghold on the borders of Languedoc, Comtat Venaissin and Provence, the fortress had a turbulent military history and has been the subject of many assaults. The solid dungeon that still dominates the village today reiterates the importance of this castle which was a desirable possession in the Middle Ages. At the end of the Baussenque Wars in the 12th century the princes of Baux were defeated. The large castle began to be renowned for its highly cultivated court and chivalrous conduct. The estate finally came to an end in the 15th century after the death of the last princess of Baux. The death of Queen Joanna I of Naples led to a crisis of succession to the County of Provence. The cities of the Aix Union (1382‚Äì1387) supported Charles, Duke of Durazzo, against Louis I, Duke of Anjou. The King of France, Charles VI, intervened and sent the Seneschal of Beaucaire, Enguerrand d'Eudin, who rallied Guillaume III Roger de Beaufort. Les Baux, the possession of the Roger, was thus neutral at the beginning of war and on the Angevin side at the end of the decade.Genevi√®ve Xhayet, Partisans and Adversaries of Louis of Anjou during the war with the Union of Aix , Provence historique, F√©d√©ration historique de Provence, volume 40, No. 162, \\"Author of the war of the Union of Aix\\", 1990, p. 407 and 413 (note 61). =Late Middle Ages= Les Baux, together with Provence, was then attached to the crown of France. Under the rule of the Manville family, the village became a center of Protestantism and even tried a rebellion against the crown. In 1631, tired of conflict, the people negotiated with the king for the redemption of the castle territory and the right to dismantle the fortifications, \\"which were a refuge for rebels\\". Louis XIII consented on 5 August.Gustave Noblemaire, History of the House of Baux, p. 162-163 In 1642 the town was offered to the Grimaldi family as a marquisate in favour of Hercule de Grimaldi, Prince of Monaco (1642-1780). The title Marquis of Baux is still carried by the Prince of Monaco. Administratively, the town is entirely French and the title of Marquis of Baux is traditionally given to the heir to the throne of Monaco. Jacques, the son of the current Prince of Monaco Albert II, carries among his many titles that of Marquis of Baux. =Modern Period= In 1822 bauxite was discovered in the area by geologist Pierre Berthier. The ore was intensively mined until its exhaustion at the end of the 20th century. Geography Ch√¢teau des Baux Les Baux-de-Provence is located in the foothills of the Alpilles in the Parc Naturel Regional des Alpilles some 22 kilometers south of Avignon and 15 kilometers north-east of Arles. Access to the commune is by the D27 road from Maussane-les-Alpilles in the south which passes through the village and continues north to join the D99 east of Mas-Blanc-des-Alpilles. The D5 also comes from Maussane-les-Alpilles in the south and passes through the east of the commune as it goes north to Saint-R√©my-de-Provence. The D27A links the two roads in the commune. The D78F branches from the D27 in the commune and goes south-west to join the D17 west of Paradou. Apart from the village there are the hamlets of Mes de Mai, Carita, and Manville. The commune is farmland in the south-east and forested hills in the rest. The commune is traversed by numerous streams which are called \\"gaudres\\". A Gaudre (from the Proven√ßal Gaudre meaning \\"small stream\\") refers to a river often dry in summer and with low flow the rest of the year. The main gaudres in the commune are the Gaude de Valmouirane with numerous tributaries flowing north to join the Canal du Vigueirat north of Mas-Blanc- des-Alpilles. The Gaudre du Mas de Chevrier also with numerous tributaries flows west to join the Gaudre d'Auge west of the commune. The Gaudre d'Entreconque flows from the north-east to south to join the Gaudre de la Foux which continues south to join the Canal des Pompes south of Maussane-les- Alpilles. =Climate= The climate in Les Baux-de-Provence, as in the rest of the Alpilles, is considered Mediterranean. The winters are mild and dry and summers hot and dry. The average maximum temperature is in July and August (29 ¬∞C) with the lowest average minimum temperature in December and January (+ 3 ¬∞C). The wettest month is January with an average of 7 days of rain against two days in July.Cliamte of Les Baux-de-Provence Holidaycheck website The Alpilles region receives more rainfall than the shores of the Mediterranean: 500 mm / year in Camargue against 600 to 700 mm / year in Les Baux. Major frosts are rare and were more frequent in the 19th century as evidenced by repeated freezing of the Rh√¥ne which has been virtually unknown since then. The mistral violently blows from the north or north-west especially in winter and spring. The Alpilles deflect the wind but it blows in Baux almost as strong as in the north of the chain. The mistral blows strongly 100 days a year on average and less strong on 83 days leaving only 182 days a year without wind.\\"The Climate\\", in Les Alpilles, Encyclopedia of a Proven√ßal Mountain, H. Bruneton, Les Alpes de Lumi√®re, Forcalquier, 2009, p. 23-24 There are two types of mistral: the \\"white mistral\\" on clear days and the \\"black mistral\\", rarer, which is accompanied by rain. =Flora and fauna= The flora in the commune is mainly xerophytic and Mediterranean Phytochorion. The botanist Bernard Girerd counted 800 plant species in 1992.\\"The Flora of the Alpilles\\", in Les Alpilles..., B. Girerd, p. 52 Apart from the olive tree, characteristic of a maussanais landscape, there are also hackberries, small sized Kermes oak, and Shadbush. Protected plant species, such as the summer snowflake (Leucojum aestivum) and H√©lianth√®me (Helianthemum lavandulaefolium), are found at the bottom of the valleys. Many animal species nest in the Alpilles and can be seen in the commune. The most famous is the Bonelli's eagle, a protected species, as well as the Egyptian vulture, the lesser kestrel, and the Eurasian eagle-owl.The Natural heritage of Alpilles The arid rocks are home to a species of lizard emblematic of the Alpilles: the ocellated lizard which is also considered threatened and protected. There are many mammals in the commune, especially in the valleys. Wild boar abounds and its population is growing. Conversely, the number of hares and rabbits have tended to decrease. The reason seems to be the outbreak of myxomatosis in 1953 that caused havoc in the population, and, since the end of the 20th century, Rabbit haemorrhagic disease causing the decline of the species. The scarcity of these rodents could pose longer term problems for the survival of species of birds of prey that feed on them. A view of Les Baux-de-Provence Demographics In 2010 the commune had 436 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.At the beginning of the 21st century, the methods of identification have been modified by Law No. 2002-276 of 27 February 2002 , the so-called \\"law of local democracy\\" and in particular Title V \\"census operations\\" allows, after a transitional period running from 2004 to 2008, the annual publication of the legal population of the different French administrative districts. For communes with a population greater than 10,000 inhabitants, a sample survey is conducted annually and the entire territory of these communes is taken into account at the end of the period of five years. The first \\"legal population\\" after 1999 under this new law came into force on 1 January 2009 and was based on the census of 2006. Economy =Olive growing sector= Baux-de-Provence olive oil The commune produces Olive oil of the valley of Les Baux-de-Provence which is protected by the appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) by a decree issued by INAO on 27 August 1997. The olive varieties that go into its preparation are: Salonenque, B√©ruguette, Grossane, and Verdale of Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne.Olive oil of the Valley of Baux-de- Provence AOC Crushed olives and black olives are also produced that fall under the INAO decree. The varieties of crushed olives broken are Salonenque and B√©ruguette. For black olives only the variety Grossane is acceptable.Cruished Olives of the Valley of Baux-de-Provence AOC Black Olives of the Valley of Baux-de-Provence AOC =Wine production= The commune is classified AOC for its Coteaux-des-baux-en-provence wines. This AOC was created by decree on 20 April 1995 for red and ros√© wines. They were first classified VDQS by an order of 23 January 1956 for Coteaux-d'aix-en-provence. A second decree dated 24 December 1985 allowed the use of the generic name Les Baux recognizing the specific identity of the vineyards of the Baux region covering seven communes in the Alpilles. Production is 15,500 hectolitres per year: 75% red and 25% ros√©.Coteaux-des-baux-de-provence (AOC) on the Institut National des Appellations d'Origine INAO website Culture Klimt exhibition at the Carri√®res de Lumi√®re Christmas at Baux in the Church of Saint Vincent is held on Christmas Eve during midnight mass. This is primarily a live nativity scene, which takes place before the pastarage ritual developed in the pastoral world and dating back to the 16th century. This traditional ceremony was abandoned during the 19th century but was revived in 1902: a cart pulled by a ram, decorated with leaves and candles, brings a newborn lamb. Each shepherd, in turn, kisses the feet of the child Jesus then passes the lamb hand to hand before giving an offering. Carri√®res de Lumi√®res, established in 1976 as the Cath√©drale d'Images, is a permanent show in which large bright images are projected on the stone walls of huge galleries dug into the rock of the Val-d'Enfer on the road to Maillane. The wall surface used extends over 4,000 m2. Cath√©drale d'Images is a fairy and giant slide show in the dark projected on the limestone walls of the quarry where the viewer is immersed in a visual and musical universe. Despite its success the Cath√©drale d'images had to stop its activities in Baux-de-Provence at the end of 2010 after refusing a Public Service Delegation. The municipal council then entrusted the management of the site to the Culturespaces company who operate under the name of Carri√®res de Lumi√®res. = Exhibitions = 2019 Stefan Szczesny paintings in les Baux-de-Provence In 2019, Stefan Szczesny exhibited in the whole village of Les Baux-de-Provence.

He ascended the throne following the death of his brother-in-law absolutist Charles XII in the Great Northern War, and the abdication of his wife, Charles's sister and successor Ulrika Eleonora, after she had to relinquish most powers to the Riksdag of the Estates and thus chose to abdicate. His powerless reign and lack of legitimate heirs of his own saw his family's elimination from the line of succession after the parliamentary government dominated by pro-revanchist Hat Party politicians ventured into a war with Russia, which ended in defeat and the Russian tsarina Elizabeth getting Adolph Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp instated following the death of the king. Youth He was the son of Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, and Princess Maria Amalia of Courland. In 1692 the young prince made his Grand Tour to the Dutch Republic, in 1695 to the Italian Peninsula and later he studied in Geneva. After this he had a military career, leading the Hessian troops as Lieutenant General in the War of the Spanish Succession on the side of the Dutch. He was defeated in 1703 in the Battle of Speyerbach, but participated the next year in the great victory in the Battle of Blenheim. In 1706 he was again defeated by the French in the Battle of Castiglione. Both in 1716 and 1718 he joined the campaign of Charles XII of Sweden against Norway, and was appointed Swedish Generalissimus. Prince consort of Sweden He married his second wife, Princess Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden, in 1715. He was then granted the title Prince of Sweden, with the style Royal Highness by the estates, and was prince consort there during Ulrika Eleonora's rule as queen regnant from 1718 until her abdication in 1720. He is the only Swedish prince consort there has been to date. Frederick I had much influence during the reign of his spouse. Some historians have suggested that the bullet which killed his brother-in-law Charles XII of Sweden in 1718 was actually fired by Frederick's aide Andr√© Sicre. Charles had been an authoritarian and demanding ruler; one reason the Swedish Estates elected Frederick was because he was taken to be fairly weak, which indeed he turned out to be. King of Sweden Frederick succeeded Ulrika Eleonora on the throne upon her abdication in his favor in 1720, elected by the Swedish Estates. The defeats suffered by Charles XII in the Great Northern War ended Sweden's position as a first-rank European power. Under Frederick, this had to be accepted. Sweden also had to cede Estonia, Ingria and Livonia to Russia in the Treaty of Nystad, in 1721. Frederick I was a very active and dynamic king at the beginning of his 31-year reign. But after the aristocracy had regained power during the wars with Russia, he became not so much powerless as uninterested in affairs of state. In 1723, he tried to strengthen royal authority, but after he failed, he never had much to do with politics. He did not even sign official documents; instead a stamp of his signature was used. He devoted most of his time to hunting and love affairs. His marriage to Queen Ulrika Eleonora was childless, but he had several children by his mistress, Hedvig Taube. In 1723 Frederick rewarded the military inventor Sven √Öderman with the estate of Halltorps on the island of √ñland, for improving the rate of fire of the musket. As a king, he was not very respected. When he was crowned, it was said of him: \\"King Charles we recently buried, King Frederick we crown ‚Äì suddenly the clock has now passed from twelve to one\\". It is said about him, that although a lot of great achievements in the country's development happened during his reign, he never had anything to do with them himself. When he died, Carl Gustaf Tessin said about him: > Under the reign of King Frederick, science has developed ‚Äì he never bothered > to read a book. The merchant business has flourished ‚Äì he has never > encouraged it with a single coin. The Stockholm Palace has been built ‚Äì he > has never been curious enough to look at it. Neither did he have anything to do with the founding of the first Swedish speaking theater at Bollhuset during his reign. One of his few important policies was the banning of duels. On 23 February 1748 Frederick I instituted the three Swedish royal orders of the Seraphim, of the Sword and of the North Star, the three principal Swedish orders of chivalry. Landgrave of Hesse- Kassel Frederick became Landgrave of Hesse only in 1730, ten years after becoming King of Sweden. He immediately appointed his younger brother William governor of Hesse. As Landgrave, Frederick is generally not seen as a success. Indeed, he did concentrate more on Sweden, and due to his negotiated, compromise-like ascension to the throne there, he and his court had a very low income. The money for that very expensive court, then, since the 1730s came from wealthy Hesse, and this means that Frederick essentially behaved like an absentee landlord and drained Hessian resources to finance life in Sweden. Also, Frederick's father, Charles I of Hesse-Kassel, had been the state's most successful ruler, rebuilding the state over his decades-long rule by means of economic and infrastructure measures and state reform, as well as tolerance, such as attracting, for economic purposes, the French Huguenots. His brother the governor, who would succeed Frederick as Landgrave William VIII of Hesse- Kassel, though by background a distinguished soldier, was likewise a great success locally. There are very few physical remainders of Frederick in Hesse today; one of them is his large Royal Swedish paraph (FR) over the old door of the University of Marburg's former riding hall, now the Institute of Physical Education. Ancestry Family and issue Riddarholm Church On 31 May 1700, he married his first wife, Louise Dorothea, Princess of Prussia (1680‚Äì1705), daughter of Frederick I of Prussia (1657‚Äì1713) and Elizabeth Henrietta of Hesse-Kassel (1661‚Äì1683). Louise Dorothea died in childbirth in December 1705. His second wife, whom he married in 1715, was Ulrika Eleonora, Princess of Sweden, (1688‚Äì1741), daughter of Charles XI of Sweden (1655‚Äì1697) and of Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark (1656‚Äì1693). Ulrika suffered two miscarriages, one in 1715 and another in 1718, after which there are no further recorded pregnancies. Frederick I had three extramarital children with his mistress Hedvig Taube: * Frederick William von Hessenstein (1735‚Äì1808). * Charles Edward von Hessenstein (1737‚Äì1769). * Hedwig Amalia von Hessenstein (1743‚Äì1752). After the death of Hedvig Taube, his official mistress was the noblewoman Catharina Ebba Horn, whom he gave the title and recognition of German-Roman Countess (1745‚Äì1748). Thus, the Hessian line in Sweden ended with him and was followed by that of Holstein-Gottorp. In Hesse-Kassel, he was succeeded by his younger brother William VIII, a famous general.

She was the youngest child of King Charles XI and Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark and named after her mother. After the death of her brother King Charles XII in 1718, she claimed the throne. Her deceased older sister, Hedvig Sophia, had left a son, Charles Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, who had the better claim by primogeniture. Ulrika Eleonora asserted that she was the closest surviving relative of the late king (the idea of proximity of blood) and cited the precedent of Queen Christina. She was recognized as successor by the Riksdag after she had agreed to renounce the powers of absolute monarchy established by her father. She abdicated in 1720 in favor of her husband, Landgrave Frederick I of Hesse-Kassel. Princess and regent After their mother's death in 1693, Ulrika Eleonora and her siblings were placed in the care of their grandmother, Hedwig Eleonora. However, her grandmother was known to favor her elder sister. During her childhood, Eleonora was somewhat overlooked in favor of this elder, more extroverted and talented sister, princess Hedvig Sophia. Her elder siblings enjoyed riding and dancing and reportedly somewhat looked down upon her as she did not have the courage to participate in their games and was easily brought to tears. She was described as friendly, modest and dignified, with good posture and beautiful hands, but she was not regarded as either intelligent or attractive. Her grandmother, Hedwig Eleonora, described her as stubborn, and she was known to demonstrate her dislike of others or of events by simulating illness. She was a talented musician, and when performing with her sister at court concerts, she would play the clavier while her sister sang. Ulrika Eleonora lived most of her life in the shadow of others, outshone by her brother the king, and by her attractive sister. From 1700, she took care of her dominating grandmother, Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp, during her brother's absence in the Great Northern War. Her older sister, Hedvig Sophia, was then the heir presumptive to the throne. Ulrika Eleonora As their brother Charles XII was unmarried and childless, Ulrika Eleonora was regarded as a likely future heir to the throne, and was thereby attractive on the marriage market. In 1698, a marriage alliance was suggested by marrying her to Prince Charles of Denmark and her brother to Princess Sophia Hedwig of Denmark, but in 1700 this plan was discarded. In 1700, there were negotiations of a marriage to Frederick William I of Prussia, but nothing came of them.Olof J√§gerski√∂ld: Lovisa Ulrika, drottning av Sverige (1945) These plans were about to be put into effect when they were disrupted, without motivation, by her brother. She was later made the god-mother of Louisa Ulrika of Prussia, who was named Ulrika after her. In 1702, a marriage to the future King George II of Great Britain was suggested, but was postponed, and in the end nothing came of it. Duke John William of Saxe-Gotha was given permission by her brother to court her, but the marriage plans were interrupted after he engaged in a duel with Anders Lagercrona in the presence of the monarch. In 1710, she received a proposal from Prince Frederick of Hesse. The negotiations were handled by her favorite and confidante Emerentia von D√ºben. The marriage was supported by her grandmother Hedwig Eleonora, as the Queen Dowager thought this would force Ulrika Eleonora to leave Sweden for Hesse, increasing the chances for the son of Ulrika Eleonora's elder sister, Charles of Holstein-Gottorp, to become heir to the throne. The engagement was announced on 23 January 1714, and the wedding took place 24 March 1715. During the wedding, her brother Charles XII remarked: \\"Tonight my sister is dancing away the crown\\".Scheutz, Lisbet (2001). Ber√∂mda och gl√∂mda Stockholmskvinnor: sju stadsvandringar : 155 kvinnoportr√§tt. Stockholm: MBM f√∂rl.. Libris 8392583. After her grandmother's death in 1715, she became the center of the court, and this was one of the happiest periods of her life. In 1715, she married Landgrave Frederick I of Hesse-Kassel. The marriage, which on her side was a love-match, became another attempt to use her as a political puppet. Frederick had married her with the intent of reaching the throne, and immediately began plotting to have her named heir in place of her nephew. The \\"Hesse Party\\" and the \\"Holstein Party\\" stood against each other in the struggle for the throne. Ulrika Eleonora's situation began to change after the death of her older sister, Hedvig Sophia, in 1708. Ulrika Eleonora became the only adult member of the royal house present in Sweden, aside from her grandmother, Queen Dowager Hedwig Eleonora. Already in late 1712, Charles XII had thoughts of making her regent during his absence. The royal council convinced her to be present at their meetings and give them her support. On 2 November 1713, she appeared at her first session, and a decision was made to assemble the Riksdag to declare her regent in her capacity as the closest heir to the throne. In 1713, the government and her grandmother named her regent during the king's absence and thus she became a pawn of the many powers struggling for influence in a country without an official heir presumptive or heir apparent. The choice now stood between Ulrika Eleonora and her nephew. Her accession as regent and president of the parliament was treated with great enthusiasm. The Riksdag had opposed her brother as they wanted to abolish the absolute monarchy and reinstate their own power. As regent, she kept herself informed of state affairs and urged her brother to return, warning him of the effects if he did not. With his permission she signed all documents of state affairs except those written to him personally. However, she regarded herself only as her brother's representative, and therefore made no suggestions of her own. As his sister, many times during the war, she had asked her brother if she could visit him, but was never permitted to. She met her brother for the first time after sixteen years in Vadstena in 1716, and after that one last time in Kristinehamn in 1718. Queen regnant On 5 December 1718, Ulrika Eleonora received the news of the death of her brother, Charles XII. It has never been claimed that she had any advance knowledge of the purported involvement of her husband's aide Andr√© Sicre, but she did immediately declare herself monarch in Uddevalla by stating that she had inherited the throne. The council was taken by surprise and did not contest this. She took control over the affairs of state and had Georg Heinrich von G√∂rtz and his followers removed from power. The \\"Hesse Party\\" secured Ulrika Eleonora's succession to the throne. They gained the support of the Riksdag opposition, who wanted to end the absolute monarchy established in 1680 and reinstate parliamentary rule. On 15 December 1718, she declared that though she had inherited the throne, she did not intend to keep the Carolinian absolutism but agreed to reinstate the older system. The war council was determined to abolish absolutism and the right to inherit the throne, but was willing to acknowledge her as an elected monarch. Their opinion was supported by the majority of the Assembly of the Estates. Ulrika Eleonora was forced into agreeing to abolish absolute monarchy and the right to inherit the throne, both for her and for her contestant, her nephew Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. After having agreed to sign the new constitution as monarch, she was elected queen on 23 January 1719. On 19 February she signed the Instrument of Government (1719), thereby securing the support of the Estates not to give the throne to her nephew and competitor. She was crowned in Uppsala Cathedral 17 March 1719 and made her formal entrance into Stockholm as monarch on 11 April that same year. During the ceremonies in Stockholm, she received the Estates, who passed the throne in procession. On this occasion, she demonstrated that she knew who her followers were. When she received the nobility, she only allowed their representatives to kiss her hand with her glove on, while the other representatives were allowed to kiss her hand without the glove. Ulrika Eleonora never made the traditional journey through the country, the Eriksgata, on her own. Instead, she made it with Frederick in 1722, after his coronation. Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden Her reign occurred just before the end of the Great Northern War. During the Russian Pillage of 1719-1721 in August of the summer of 1719, the Russian Fleet attacked the capital of Stockholm. Despite the ongoing attack, Ulrika Eleonora forced her courtiers to attend a previously accepted reception at the British ambassador's, \\"being so untouched as if there had been no enemies present for hundreds of miles\\",Lundh-Eriksson, Nanna (Swedish): Den gl√∂mda drottningen. Karl XII:s syster. Ulrika Eleonora D.Y. och hennes tid (The Forgotten Queen. The Sister of Charles XII. The Age of Ulrika Eleonora the Younger) Aff√§rstryckeriet, Norrt√§lje. (1976) which was considered to be an impressive act of courage. Her favorite courtier was Emerentia von D√ºben (1669‚Äì1743), her old nurse, who had been ennobled and made lady-in-waiting in 1707 and with whom she had a close relationship all her life. D√ºben acted as her advisor, her comfort and her support, and was said to not have abused her influence - they were described as sisters. During her short reign, to secure support for her rule, she ennobled many families. In a period of fifteen months, she ennobled 181 people, more than any other monarch in Swedish history; one count, two barons and eight lesser noblemen every month. She had seven field marshals where her brother only ever had between three and five. Ulrika Eleonora was in fact in favour of an absolute monarchy. She had agreed to the new constitution only to secure the throne from her nephew, and her relations with the council were not good. She came into conflict with the president of the Privy Council Arvid Horn, who resigned in protest, as well as with his successor Gustaf Cronhielm. Horn criticized her for discussing state affairs with her husband, pressed her as to whether she would respect the constitution and insulted her by making the remark that nothing better was to be expected \\"under the regiment of a female.\\" These conflicts had a deleterious effect on the war and state affairs. Ulrika Eleonora supported the political ambitions of her consort, and from the beginning, she wished for him to become her co-monarch, in the fashion of William III and Mary II. However, this was not permitted by the Riksdag. One reason being that co-reigning had been forbidden in Sweden since the 15th century. There was also opposition in the Riksdag to the influence of Emerentia von D√ºben and her siblings over the affairs of state. Her difficulty in respecting the constitution and trouble in getting along with the Riksdag, as well as her way of continuously discussing state affairs with her husband, did however make the Riksdag willing to replace her with Frederick as sole monarch if she abdicated, an idea that had the support of Frederick. On 29 February 1720, after having again been denied a co-monarchy, Ulrika Eleonora abdicated in favour of her husband on the condition that she should succeed him if he should die before her. This condition of her abdication in fact granted her place as the heir to the Swedish throne until her death. This succession was confirmed by the Riksdag. She often spoke of the abdication as the greatest sacrifice of her life. Frederick succeeded her on 24 March 1720. Queen consort Georg Engelhard Schr√∂der ‚Äì Ulrika Eleonora Queen of Sweden The reign of her husband began the period traditionally known as the Age of Liberty, when the monarchy lost most of its power to a parliamentary system. As queen consort, she withdrew to private life. Ulrika Eleonora had married for love and was known to be fiercely loyal to Frederick. Initially, the relationship between Ulrika Eleonora and Frederick was described as a happy one, and before Frederick became monarch, he restricted himself to the role of her consort. After two miscarriages in 1715 and 1718 and at least until 1724, the Queen expressed hope that she would give birth to an heir, but ultimately her marriage was childless.Holst, Walfrid. Ulrika Eleonora d. y. Karl XII's syster Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand, Stockholm 1956 King Frederick suggested placing his brother and his line in the House of Hesse in the succession line, and though this attempt was unsuccessful, Ulrika Eleonora supported this choice rather than her nephew the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp.Jacobson, Esther, Hedvig Taube: en bok om en svensk kunglig m√§tress, Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand, Stockholm, 1919 Queen Ulrika Eleonora enjoyed great popularity during the reign of her spouse, partly as the last member of the old royal house, and partly because of her personal piety. She was aware that this gave her power to influence policy, and when she let her opinion be known, it was often followed. This influence was recognized. During the Riksdag of 1738, for example, the queen expressed her displeasure when Carl Gustaf Tessin was due to be elected to a post, which resulted in public protests which did not quiet down until Tessin had been received at the Royal Palace and allowed to kiss the bare hand of the queen, who assured him that she had no intention of interfering. The relationship between Ulrika Eleonora and Frederick changed after he became king, and it was said that when she gave him the crown, she gave him his freedom.Lyttkens, Alice (1973). Kvinnan b√∂rjar vakna: den svenska kvinnans historia fr√•n 1700 till 1840-talet. (The awakening of Woman: The history of the Swedish woman from 1700 until the 1840s). Stockholm: Bonnier. Libris 7144053. (Swedish) King Frederick had mistresses, and his extramarital affairs increased after he lost much of his royal authority in 1723. In 1734, Frederick became the first king in Swedish history to have an official mistress, the noblewoman Hedvig Taube, who was given the title Countess of Hessenstein. Ulrika Eleonora expressed her disapproval to her close confidant Emerentia von D√ºben, who convinced her never to display any public reaction to the affair, as it would be beneath the queen's dignity and her position was untouchable: \\"As the Moon travels along its course over the sky without bothering over the barks of dogs, so should Her Majesty despise the gossip, which has been unleashed by this much unfortunate and blinded commitment\\". By convincing Ulrika Eleonora not to publicly display her displeasure of his adultery, Emerentia von D√ºben also became favored by King Frederik. Ulrika Eleonora sternly followed the policy of not displaying her feelings about the adultery for years. At the beginning of the affair, on one occasion she even walked publicly with Hedvig Taube in her effort to defend the reputation of her husband. During the Riksdag of 1738, the question of the king's adultery was raised by the clergy estate within the Riksdag of the Estates, and a letter of protest was presented to the king on 3 April 1739. The archbishop had already had a private conversation with the queen about the matter, during which the queen had lamented herself over the king's adultery and her disappointment of the Taube family. The clergy estate pointed to the oath made by the king in 1720, when he succeeded the queen on the Swedish throne after she abdicated in his favor, in which he had made the promise to: \\"love, honor and respect my most worthy consort, the all powerful Princess Ulrica Eleonora [...] and declare the Estates to be free of their oath of allegiance, should I ever break this oath and insurance\\", in fact declaring the king deposed if he disrespected the queen. On 26 April, the king expressed a wish to leave for Hesse. He was rumored to plan to settle there permanently with Taube. A rumor circulated of a planned coup d'etat by the queen's followers. The plan was to have the king leave with Taube, leaving the queen as regent of Sweden in his absence. After his departure, the queen's followers would present her with proof that the king had secretly married Taube, expecting the queen to respond by considering her marriage dissolved and agree to be reinstated as monarch. This planned coup never took place; the king never presented a request to leave for Hesse. During the Riksdag of 1740‚Äì41, the question was raised again. At this point, a change had occurred in the queen's attitude, signs of which were observed already during the Riksdag of 1738. The policy of Ulrika Eleonora not to express her dislike of Frederick's adultery was weakened during her last years, possibly due to the unique position of Taube as the official mistress, because of the long-term nature of the affair and because they had children. Another reason for her change of conduct was reportedly that she, as an orthodox Lutheran, was concerned for the king's soul. Despite demonstrating her compassion with the other riksr√•d deposed during the riksdag of 1738, she smiled when the misfortune of the father of Hedvig Taube was mentioned. When hosting the wedding of her maid of honour Sigrid Bonde at court, she neglected to invite the Taube, Gylleborg and Sparre families (the last two known supporters of Hedvig Taube), although court protocol would have expected them to be included, and when the new riksr√•d Carl Sparre, a known supporter of Taube, was presented to her during the audience for the new members of government, she demonstratively retired, preventing him from kissing her skirt in accordance with protocol. The discontent of Queen Ulrika Eleonora was not a small matter for the Riksdag: not only because of the queen's popularity, but also because the queen had abdicated in favour of the king on the condition that she would succeed him if he should die before her, a condition which made the queen the heir to the throne. During the Riksdag of 1741, the matter of the king's adultery was, for the second time, raised in parliament by the clergy estate, this time by Bishop Erik Benzelius, who referred to the matter as that \\"which the Queen had made it known\\" that they should raise, in order to \\"set the mourning heart of the Queen to rest\\". An official statement of protest was made, stating a reminder of the king's oath always to treat the queen with respect when she abdicated in his favor, and that the whole kingdom was in mourning of the queen's sorrow, and concerned for the welfare of the king's soul. Two delegations from the clergy estate were appointed: one to the king, and one to Hedvig Taube. In July 1741, the statement was read to the king in his audience chamber. The king reacted with rage, refused to accept the statement and stated that the Riksdag of the Estates had promised him not to interfere in his private life. He was, on their second attempt, forced to receive the statement. When told the result of that audience with the king, the queen, Ulrika Eleonora insisted that the planned embassy to Hedvig Taube was also to be executed according to plan, and replied to the hesitation of the bishop with the words: \\"When you priests follow your calling and your conscience, you do well to do so with no concern of other matters.\\" On this occasion, Hedvig Taube defended her by saying that she had never been aware of any negative reaction whatsoever from the Queen. Riddarholm Church. Ulrika Eleonora served as regent twice: The first time during Frederick's absence in 1731, and the second time during his illness in 1738-1739. She was declared regent in May 1731 when Frederick departed to visit Hesse, and ruled until his return in the autumn. In 1738, she was asked by the Estates to accept the regency at an occasion when Frederick was so ill that he was in danger of dying and was incapable of ruling. She duly accepted this task and handled the state affairs until after New Year's Eve 1738‚Äì39. During her second regency, she banned the newly founded Swedish theatre by refusing to extend their access to Bollhuset;Tryggve Bystr√∂m (1981). Svenska komedien 1737-1754. (Swedish Comedy 1737-1754) Bor√•s: Centraltryckeriet AB. (Swedish) her reason for this was opposition toward the theatre among the clergy. The theatre, however, was restored the following year. Ulrika Eleonora was interested in jewelry and music. She enjoyed to participate in the dance at court balls, and though religious scruples made her conflicted in the issue, she also engaged German and French theatre companies to perform at Bollhuset. Intensely religious, she was capable of interrupting a parliamentary session to pray. Similarly, at court presentations, she could interrogate the female debutantes about the Bible, rewarding them for correct answers. Sternly maintaining her royal pride, she was known to simulate illness and decline to leave her quarters when she felt insulted. Her dependency upon Emerentia von D√ºben has often been mentioned, but she had several additional friends, among them Hedvig M√∂rner, as well as her childhood friend Anna Fleming, who was her lady-in-waiting for thirty years.Eva √ñsterberg, red (1997).

There were rumours that she had been poisoned, but these rumours were silenced when the marks of her illness were visible during her public lit de parade. As she had been the heir to the throne, her death marked the beginning of a succession crisis. Ancestry References * Hofberg, Herman et al. (1906). Svenskt Biografiskt Handlexikon.

He was the son of John Casimir, Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken-Kleeburg and Catherine of Sweden. After his father's death he also succeeded him as Pfalzgraf. He was married to Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp, who bore his son and successor, Charles XI. Charles X Gustav was the second Wittelsbach king of Sweden after the childless king Christopher of Bavaria (1441‚Äì1448) and he was the first king of the Swedish Caroline era, which had its peak during the end of the reign of his son, Charles XI. He led Sweden during the Second Northern War, enlarging the Swedish Empire. By his predecessor Christina, he was considered de facto Duke of Eyland (√ñland)Paul Meijer Granqvist in Carl X Gustaf \\"den f√∂rste pfalzaren Askerbergs, Stockholm 1910 p. 56-57 before ascending to the Swedish throne. His numbering as Charles X derives from a 16th-century invention. The Swedish king Charles IX (1604‚Äì1611) chose his numeral after studying a fictitious history of Sweden. This king was the fourth actual King Charles,Article Karl in Nordisk familjebok but has never been called Charles IV. Heir presumptive In his early childhood, raised in the Swedish court alongside his cousin Queen Christina, he received an excellent civil education. Later Charles X learned the art of war under Lennart Torstenson, being present at the second Battle of Breitenfeld (1642) and at Jankowitz (1645). From 1646 to 1648 he frequented the Swedish court, supposedly as a prospective husband of his cousin the queen regnant, Christina of Sweden (1626‚Äì89, reigned 1632‚Äì54), but her insurmountable objection to wedlock put an end to these anticipations, and to compensate her cousin for a broken half-promise she declared him her successor in 1649, despite the opposition of the Privy Council headed by Axel Oxenstierna. In 1648 he gained the appointment of commander of the Swedish forces in Germany. The conclusion of the treaties of Westphalia in October 1648 prevented him from winning the military laurels he is said to have desired, but as the Swedish plenipotentiary at the executive congress of Nuremberg, he had an opportunity to learn diplomacy, a science he is described as having quickly mastered. As the recognized heir to the throne, his position on his return to Sweden was dangerous because of the growing discontent with the queen. He therefore withdrew to the isle of √ñland until the abdication of Christina on 5 June 1654 called him to the throne. Early days as King Image of King Carl Gustav on a wall of Stockholm Palace. Charles Gustav was crowned on 7 June 1654, the day after his cousin Christina abdicated. The beginning of Charles X's reign concentrated on the healing of domestic discords and on the rallying of all the forces of the nation round his standard for a new policy of conquest. On the recommendation of his predecessor, he contracted a political marriage on 24 October 1654 with Hedwig Eleonora, the daughter of Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. He was hoping to secure a future ally against Denmark. The Riksdag which assembled at Stockholm in March 1655, duly considered the two great pressing national questions: war, and the restitution of the alienated crown lands. Over three days a secret committee presided over by the King decided the war question: Charles X easily persuaded the delegates that a war against Poland appeared necessary and might prove very advantageous; but the consideration of the question of the subsidies due to the crown for military purposes was postponed to the following Riksdag. In 1659 he proclaimed severe punishment for anyone hunting in the royal game reserve in Ottenby, √ñland, Sweden, where he had built a long dry-stone wall separating the southern tip of the island. Second Northern War (1655‚Äì1660) =War in Poland-Lithuania= Engraving of Charles X On 10 July 1655, Charles X left Sweden to engage in a war against the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, in what became the Second (or Little) Northern War (1655‚Äì1660). By the time war was declared he had at his disposal 50,000 men and 50 warships. Hostilities had already begun with the occupation of D√ºnaburg in Polish Livonia by the Swedes on 1 July 1655. Then on 21 July 1655 Swedish army under Arvid Wittenberg crossed into Poland and proceeded towards the encampment of the Greater Poland Levy of the Nobility (pospolite ruszenie) encamped among the banks of the Noteƒá river, with some regular infantry for support. On 25 July the Polish noble levy army capitulated, and the voivodeships of Pozna≈Ñ and Kalisz placed themselves under the protection of the Swedish King. Thereupon the Swedes entered Warsaw without opposition and occupied the whole of Greater Poland. The Polish king, John II Casimir of Poland (1648‚Äì68) of the House of Vasa, eventually fled to Silesia after his armies had suffered defeats. A great number of Polish nobles and their personal armies joined the Swedes, including the majority of the famous Winged Hussars. Many Poles saw Charles X Gustav as a strong monarch who could be a more effective leader than John II Casimir. Charles X in skirmish with Tatars near Warsaw Meanwhile, Charles X Gustav pressed on towards Krak√≥w, which the Swedes captured after a two months' siege. The fall of Krak√≥w followed a capitulation of the Polish Royal armies, but before the end of the year a reaction began in Poland herself. On 18 November 1655 the Swedes invested the fortress-monastery of Czƒôstochowa, but the Poles defended it and after a seventy days‚Äô siege the Swedish besiegers had to retire with great loss. This success elicited popular enthusiasm in Poland and gave rise to a nationalistic and religious rhetoric concerning the war and Charles X. He was depicted as tactless and his mercenaries barbaric. His refusal to legalize his position by summoning the Polish diet and his negotiations for the partition of the very state he affected to befriend, awoke a nationalistic spirit in the country. National Museum in Warsaw In the beginning of 1656 King John II Casimir returned from exile and the reorganised Polish army, increased in numbers. By this time Charles had discovered that he could more readily defeat the Poles than conquer Poland. What is described as his chief object, the conquest of Prussia, remained unaccomplished, and a new Swedish adversary arose in the elector of Brandenburg, Frederick William I, alarmed by the ambition of the Swedish king. Charles forced the elector, albeit at the point of the sword, to become his ally and vassal (Treaty of K√∂nigsberg, 17 January 1656); but the Polish national rising now imperatively demanded his presence in the south. For weeks he engaged in the pursuit of Polish divisions engaged in guerrilla tactics in the snow-covered plains of Poland, penetrating as far south as Jaros≈Çaw in Ruthenian Voivodeship (wojew√≥dztwo ruskie), by which time he had lost two-thirds of his 15,000 men army with no apparent result. In the meantime, the Russians signed a cease-fire with the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (Treaty of Vilno of 1656 ) and then pursued a campaign in Livonia and laid siege to Riga, the second largest city in the Swedish Realm. Charles's retreat from Jaros≈Çaw to Warsaw almost ended with disaster, for he returned with the fragments of his host, for his army was trapped by the Polish-Lithuanian armies ‚Äì amidst three converging armies, in a marshy forest region intersected in every direction by well-guarded rivers ‚Äì is considered one of his most brilliant achievements. But on 21 June 1656 the Poles retook Warsaw, and four days later Charles was obliged to purchase the assistance of Frederick William I, by the treaty of Marienburg (23 June 1656). On 28‚Äì30 July the combined Swedes and Brandenburgers, 18,000 strong, after a three days‚Äô battle, defeated John Casimir's army of 40,000 at Warsaw, however the Polish- Lithuanian forces promptly withdrew with no large losses and apparent strong will to fight another day, while Swedish host reoccupied the Polish capital again, causing much destruction to the city and its inhabitants. However, this feat of arms did not have the desired result for Charles, and when Frederick William compelled the Swedish king to open negotiations with the Poles, they refused the terms offered, the war resumed, and Charles concluded an offensive and defensive alliance with the elector of Brandenburg (Treaty of Labiau, 20 November 1656) which stipulated that Frederick William and his heirs should henceforth possess the full sovereignty of East Prussia. =War on Denmark- Norway= Charles X. Engraving after a painting by David Kl√∂cker Ehrenstrahl Labiau involved an essential modification of Charles's Baltic policy; but the alliance with the elector of Brandenburg had now become indispensable for him on almost any terms. The difficulties of Charles X in Poland are believed to have caused him to receive the tidings of the Danish-Norwegian declaration of war on 1 June 1657 with extreme satisfaction. He had learnt from Torstensson that Denmark was most vulnerable if attacked from the south, and he attacked Denmark with a velocity which paralysed resistance. At the end of June 1657, at the head of 8,000 seasoned veterans, he broke up from Bromberg (Bydgoszcz) south of Pomerania and reached the borders of Holstein on 18 July. The Danish army dispersed and the Swedes recovered the duchy of Bremen. In the early autumn Charles's troops swarmed over Jutland and firmly established themselves in the duchies. But the fortress of Fredriksodde (Fredericia) held Charles's smaller army at bay from mid-August to mid-October, while the fleet of Denmark - Norway, after two days‚Äô battle, compelled the Swedish fleet to abandon its projected attack on the Danish islands. The position of the Swedish king had now become critical. In July Denmark-Norway and Poland-Lithuania concluded an offensive and defensive alliance. Still more ominously for the Swedes, the elector of Brandenburg, perceiving Sweden's difficulties, joined the league against Sweden and compelled Charles to accept the proffered mediation of Oliver Cromwell, Coenraad van Beuningen and Cardinal Mazarin. The negotiations foundered, however, upon the refusal of Sweden to refer the points in dispute to a general peace-congress, and Charles received encouragement from the capture of Fredriksodde, 23-24 October, whereupon he began to make preparations for conveying his troops over to Funen in transport vessels. But soon another and cheaper expedient presented itself. In the middle of December 1657 began the great frost, which would prove so fatal to Denmark-Norway. In a few weeks the cold had grown so intense that the freezing of an arm of the sea with so rapid a current as the Small Belt became a conceivable possibility; and henceforth meteorological observations formed an essential part of the strategy of the Swedes. March across the Belts The crossing of the Great Belt On 28 January 1658, Charles X arrived at Haderslev in South Jutland. His meteorologists estimated that in a couple of days the ice of the Little Belt would become firm enough to bear even the passage of a mail-clad host. The cold during the night of 29 January became most severe; and early in the morning of the 30th the Swedish king gave the order to start, the horsemen dismounting on the weaker spots of ice and cautiously leading their horses as far apart as possible, until they swung into their saddles again, closed their ranks and made a dash for the shore. Swedish arms quickly overpowered the Danish troops lining the opposite coast and won the whole of Funen with the loss of only two companies of cavalry, which disappeared under the ice while fighting with the Danish left wing. Pursuing his march, Charles X, with his eyes fixed steadily on Copenhagen, resolved to cross the frozen Great Belt also. However, he accepted the advice of his chief engineer officer Erik Dahlberg, who acted as pioneer throughout and chose the more circuitous route from Svendborg, by the islands of Langeland, Lolland and Falster, in preference to the direct route from Nyborg to Kors√∏r, which would have had to cross a broad, almost uninterrupted expanse of ice. A council of war, which met at two o‚Äôclock in the morning to consider the practicability of Dahlberg's proposal, dismissed it as hazardous. Even the king wavered; but when Dahlberg persisted in his opinion, Charles overruled the objections of the commanders. On the night of 5 February the transit began, the cavalry leading the way through the snow-covered ice, which quickly thawed beneath the horses‚Äô hoofs so that the infantry which followed after had to wade through half an ell (nearly 2 feet) of sludge, facing the risk that the ice would break beneath their feet. At three o‚Äôclock in the afternoon, with Dahlberg leading the way, the army reached Grimsted in Lolland without losing a man; on 8 February, Charles reached Falster. On 11 February he stood safely on the soil of Zealand. A Swedish medal struck to commemorate the transit of the Baltic Sea bear the inscription: Natura hoc debuit uni. Sweden had achieved a rare war exploit, in Sweden considered to be matched only by the crusade of the Livonian Order led by William of Modena to conquer Saaremaa (Osel) in January 1227 and afterwards when two Russian armies crossed the frozen Gulf of Bothnia from Finland to mainland Sweden in March 1809 during the Finnish War. It is believed that the effect of this achievement on the Danish government found expression in the Treaty of Taastrup on 18 February, and in the Treaty of Roskilde (26 February 1658), whereby Denmark - Norway sacrificed a great part of her territory to save the rest. However, Charles X continued the war efforts against Denmark - Norway after a council held at Gottorp on 7 July, even though he was in defiance of international equity. Without warning, Denmark - Norway was attacked a second time. On 17 July he again landed on Zealand and besieged Copenhagen with its king Frederick III of Denmark and Norway, but Copenhagen repelled a major assault and managed to hold out long enough for the Dutch fleet under Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam to relieve the city, defeating the Swedish fleet in the Battle of the Sound on 29 October 1658. Jutland had been reconquered by Denmark-Norway's allies, Poland and Brandenburg, and in 1659 Danish and forces liberated the Island of Funen in the Battle of Nyborg. As Baltic trade was vital to the Dutch economy they made clear to Charles they wouldn't allow Sweden to control the Sound. The Estates in Gothenburg Charles X consented to reopen negotiations with Denmark, at the same time proposing to exercise pressure upon his rival by a simultaneous winter campaign in Norway. Such an enterprise necessitated fresh subsidies from his already impoverished people, and obliged him in December 1659 to cross over to Sweden to meet the estates, whom he had summoned to Gothenburg. The lower estates protested the imposition of fresh burdens, but were persuaded by Charles. Foot end of King Carl Gustav's elaborate coffin in Stockholm's Riddarholm Church Illness and death Soon after the estates opened on 4 January 1660, Charles X Gustav fell ill with symptoms of a cold. Ignoring his illness, he repeatedly went to inspect the Swedish forces near Gothenburg, and soon broke down with chills, headaches and dyspnoea. On 15 January, court physician Johann K√∂ster arrived, and in medical error mistook Charles X Gustav's pneumonia for scorbut and dyspepsia. K√∂ster started a \\"cure\\" including the application of multiple enemata, laxatives, bloodletting and sneezing powder. While after three weeks the fever eventually was down and the coughing was better, the pneumonia had persisted and evolved into a sepsis by 8 February. On 12 February, Charles X Gustav signed his testament: His son, Charles XI of Sweden, was still a minor, and Charles X Gustav appointed a minor regency consisting of six relatives and close friends. Charles X Gustav died the next day at the age of 37. Family Charles X had one legitimate child by Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp: his successor Charles XI (1655‚Äì1697, reigned 1660‚Äì1697). By M√§rta Allertz he had an illegitimate son: Gustaf Carlson (1647‚Äì1708), who became Count of B√∂rringe and Lindholmen Castle in Scania. He also had a number of other children, by different women, before his marriage.

In the Gregorian calendar, Charles was born 4 December 1655 and died 15 April 1697. was King of Sweden from 1660 until his death, in a period of Swedish history known as the Swedish Empire (1611‚Äì1718). He was the only son of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein- Gottorp. His father died when he was four years old, so Charles was educated by his governors until his coronation at the age of seventeen. Soon afterward, he was forced out on military expeditions to secure the recently acquired dominions from Danish troops in the Scanian War. Having successfully fought off the Danes, he returned to Stockholm and engaged in correcting the country's neglected political, financial, and economic situation. He managed to sustain peace during the remaining 20 years of his reign. Changes in finance, commerce, national maritime and land armaments, judicial procedure, church government, and education emerged during this period. Charles XI was succeeded by his only son Charles XII, who made use of the well-trained army in battles throughout Europe. The fact that Charles was crowned as Charles XI does not mean that he was the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles. His father's name (as the 10th) was due to his great-grandfather, King Charles IX of Sweden (1604‚Äì1611), having adopted his own numeral by using a mythological History of Sweden. This ancestor was actually the 5th King Charles.Article Karl in Nordisk familjebok The numbering tradition thus begun still continues, with the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf. Under guardian rule Ehrenstrahl. Miniature of Charles XI, Pierre Signac, circa 1662 Charles was born in the Stockholm Palace Tre Kronor in November 1655. His father, Charles X of Sweden, had left Sweden in July that year to fight in the war against Poland. After several years of warfare, the king returned in the winter of 1659, gathered his family and the Riksdag of the Estates in Gothenburg. Here he beheld his four-year-old son for the first time. Only a few weeks later, in mid-January 1660, the king fell ill; one month later, he wrote his last will and died.√Öberg (1958) Charles X Gustav's will and testament left the administration of the Swedish Empire during Charles XI's minority to a regency led by Queen Dowager Hedwig Eleonora as both formal regent and chair of a six-member Regency Council with two votes and a final say over the rest of the council. Per Brahe was one member of the council. In addition, Charles X Gustav left command of the army and a seat on the council to his younger brother, Adolph John I, Count Palatine of Kleeburg. These provisions among others led to the remainder of the council immediately challenging the will. On 14 February, the day after King Charles X's death, Hedwig Eleonora sent a message to the council stating that she knew that they contested the will and that she demanded that it should be respected. The council answered that the will must first be discussed with the parliament, and at the following council in Stockholm on 13 May, the council tried to keep her from attending. The parliament questioned whether it would be good for her health or suitable for a widow to attend council, and that if not, it would be hard to keep sending a messenger to her quarters. Her reply that the council would be allowed to meet without her and only inform her when they considered it necessary was met with satisfaction from the council. Hedwig Eleonora's ostensible indifference to politics came as a great relief to the lords of the guardian government. His mother, Queen Hedvig Eleonora, remained the formal regent until Charles XI attained his majority on 18 December 1672, but she was careful not to embroil herself in political conflicts.Rystad (2003), p.26 During his first appearances in parliament, Charles spoke to the government through her. He would whisper the questions he had in her ear, and she would ask them aloud and clearly for him. Herman Lindqvist: Historien om Sverige: Storhet och Fall (History of Sweden: Greatness and fall) As an adolescent, Charles devoted himself to sports, exercise, and his favourite pastime of bear-hunting. He appeared ignorant of the very rudiments of statecraft and almost illiterate. His main difficulties are now seen as evident signs of dyslexia, a disability that was poorly understood at the time.Nationalencyclopedin, article Karl XIIRystad (2003), p.23√Öberg (1958) gives examples: he would start with the last letter when reading words, and would spell faton instead of afton, etc. According to many contemporary sources, the king was considered poorly educated and therefore not qualified to conduct himself effectively in foreign affairs.Upton, Anthony F. (1998). Charles XI and Swedish Absolutism, 1660‚Äì1697. Cambridge University Press, 1998. , p. 91: \\"There was a widespread contemporary impression that the king was poorly qualified and ineffective in foreign affairs [...] The Danish minister, M. Scheel, reported to his king how Charles XI seemed embarrassed by questions, kept his eyes down and was taciturn [...] The French diplomat, Jean Antoine de Mesmes, comte d‚ÄôAvaux, described him as 'a prince with few natural talents', so obsessed with getting money out of his subjects that he 'does not concern himself much with foreign affairs'. The Dane, Jens Juel, made a similar comment.\\" Charles was dependent on his mother and advisors to interact with the foreign envoys since he had no foreign language skills apart from German and was ignorant of the world outside the Swedish borders.Upton, p. 91. Italian writer Lorenzo Magalotti visited Stockholm in 1674 and described the teenage Charles XI as \\"virtually afraid of everything, uneasy to talk to foreigners, and not daring to look anyone in the face\\". Another trait was a deep religious devotion: he was God-fearing, frequently prayed kneeling and attended sermons. Magalotti otherwise described the king's main pursuits as hunting, the upcoming war, and jokes.Rystad (2003) p. 37√Öberg (1958), pp.63‚Äì65 Scanian War Charles XI at the Battle of Lund in 1676. Painting by David Kl√∂cker Ehrenstrahl in 1682. The situation in Europe was shaky during this time and Sweden was going through financial problems. Charles XI's guardians decided to negotiate an alliance with France in 1671. This would ensure that Sweden would not be isolated if there was a war, and that the national finances would improve thanks to French subsidies.√Öberg (1959) pp.50‚Äì53 France directed its aggression against the Dutch in 1672, and by the spring of 1674, Sweden was forced to take part by directing forces towards Brandenburg, under the lead of Karl Gustav Wrangel.√Öberg, p.66 Denmark was an ally of the Habsburg Holy Roman Empire, and it was evident that Sweden was on the verge of yet another war with that country. A remedy was attempted by chancellor Nils Brahe, who traveled to Copenhagen in the spring of 1675 to try to get the Danish princess Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark engaged to the Swedish king. In mid-June 1675, the engagement was officially proclaimed. However, when news arrived of the Swedish defeat at the Battle of Fehrbellin, Danish king Christian V declared war on Sweden that September.√Öberg (1958), pp.71‚Äì72 The Swedish Privy Council continued its internal feuds, and the king was forced to rule without them.√Öberg (1958), pp.72‚Äì74 The 20-year-old king was inexperienced and considered ill-served amidst what has been called the anarchy in the nation. He dedicated autumn in his newly formed camp in Scania to arm the Swedish nation for battle in the Scanian War. The Swedish soldiers in Scania were outnumbered and outequipped by the Danes. In May 1676, they invaded Scania, taking Landskrona and Helsingborg, then proceeding through Bohusl√§n towards Halmstad. The King had to grow up quickly. He suddenly found himself alone and under great pressure.√Öberg (1958), pp.75‚Äì76 Victory at the Battle of Halmstad (17 August 1676), when Charles and his commander-in-chief Simon Grundel-Helmfelt defeated a Danish division, was the king's first glimmer of good luck. Charles continued south through Scania, arriving on the tableland of the flooded K√§vlinge River ‚Äì near Lund ‚Äì on 11 November. The Danish army commanded by Christian V was positioned on the other side. It was impossible to cross the river and Charles had to wait for weeks until it froze over. This finally happened on 4 December and Charles launched a surprise attack on the Danish forces to fight the Battle of Lund. This was one of the bloodiest engagements of its time. Of the over 20,000 combatants, about 8,000 perished on the battlefield.√Öberg (1958, pp.77‚Äì79Rystad (2003), p. 95, estimates that 8,000‚Äì9,000 men fell out of 20,000 All the Swedish commanders showed ability, but the chief glory of the day was attributed to Charles XI and his fighting spirit. The battle proved to be a decisive one for the rule of the Scanian lands and it has been described as the most significant event for Charles' personality. Charles commemorated this date the rest of his life.√Öberg (1958) p.81Rystad (2003) p.97 In the following year, 9,000 men led by Charles routed 12,000 Danes at the Battle of Landskrona. This proved to be the last pitched battle of the war since, in September 1678, Christian V evacuated his army back to Zealand. In 1679, Louis XIV of France dictated the terms of a general pacification, and Charles XI, who is said to have bitterly resented \\"the insufferable tutelage\\" of the French king, was forced at last to acquiesce to a peace that managed to leave his empire practically intact. Peace was made with Denmark in the treaties of Fontainebleau (1679) and Lund, and with Brandenburg in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679). Post-war actions An allusion of a triumphant Charles XI on horse back Charles devoted the rest of his life to avoiding further warfare by gaining larger independence in foreign affairs, while he also promoted economic stabilization and a reorganization of the military. His remaining 20 years on the throne were the longest peacetime of the Swedish Empire (1611‚Äì1718).Nationalencyklopedin, article Karl XI In the early years, he was assisted by the man who had become his trusted prime-minister, Johan G√∂ransson Gyllenstierna (1635‚Äì1680). Some sources say the king was basically dependent on Gyllenstierna,.√Öberg (1958), pp.106‚Äì107 His sudden death in 1680 opened up the road to the monarch, and many men tried to get close to the king to take Gyllenstierna's place.Rystad (2003) p.165 =Financial restoration= L√§ck√∂ Castle, one of many mansions reclaimed by the Crown. Engraving by Willem Swidde from circa 1700 in Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna. Sweden's weak economy had suffered during the war and was now in a deep crisis. Charles assembled the Riksdag of the Estates in October 1680. The assembly has been described as one of the most important held by the Riksdag of the Estates.Rystad (2003), p.167 Here, the king finally pushed through the reduction ordeal, something that had been discussed in the Riksdag since 1650. It meant that any land or object previously owned by the crown and lent or given away ‚Äì including counties, baronies and lordships ‚Äì could be recovered. It affected many prominent members of the nobility, some of whom were ruined by it. One of them was the former guardian and Lord Chief Justice Magnus De La Gardie, who, among many other Estates, had to return the extravagant 248-room L√§ck√∂ Castle.Rystad (2003) p.181 The reduction process involved the examination of every title deed in the kingdom, including the dominions, and it resulted in a complete readjustment of the nation's finances.√Öberg (1958), pp 93‚Äì94 =Greycoat= According to Swedish legend, Charles XI travelled around the country dressed as a farmer or simple traveller. In the legend he is referred to as the Greycoat (Swedish: Gr√•kappan).Lars O. Lagerqvist in Sverige och dess regenter under 1000 √•r p. 185 This was done to discover and identify corruption and oppression against the populace. There are many stories about him arriving in villages looking for corrupt church officials and punishing them. One anecdote tells of him visiting one village with a church in splendid condition and the priest living in poverty. Continuing, the King found in the next village a church in disrepair and a priest living lavishly. The King solved the situation by switching the priests, giving the poor priest the lavish living condition and a church the King was certain he would rebuild. Charles was always followed by a military cort√®ge but he was one of the kings in Sweden during this era that travelled the most throughout the country and was famous for the speed he travelled with, setting many speed records during his journeys. The stories of the Greycoat were published in a book by Arvid August Afzelius in the middle of the 19th century. =Absolutism= Portrait in Samuel von Pufendorf: De rebus a Carolo Gustavo, 1696 Another important decision made during the assembly was that of the Swedish Privy Council. Since 1634, it had been mandatory for the king to take advice from the council. During the Scanian War, the members of the council were engaged in internal feuds, and the king more or less ruled without listening to their advice. At the 1680 assembly, he asked the Estates whether he was still bound to the council, to which the Estates responded with his desired reply: \\"he was not bound by anyone other than himself\\" (\\"env√§lde\\"), and thereby the absolute monarchy was formally established in Sweden.√Öberg (1958), p.111 The Riksdag of the Estates confirmed his power in 1693 by officially proclaiming that the king was the sole ruler of Sweden.√Öberg (1958), p.190 =Military restructure= In the 1682 assembly of the Riksdag of the Estates, the king put forth his suggestion for military reform, whereby each of the lands of Sweden were to have 1,200 soldiers at the ready, at all times, and two farms were to provide accommodations for one soldier. His soldiers were known as Caroleans, trained to be skilled and preferring to attack rather than defend. Savaging and looting were strictly forbidden. Soldier huts around the country were the most visible part of the new Swedish allotment system. However, Charles also modernized the military techniques and worked to improve the overall skill and knowledge of the officers by sending them abroad to study.√Öberg (1958) pp.125‚Äì134Rystad (2003), pp.241‚Äì265 The Swedish navy suffered major defeats against Danish-Dutch forces in the Scanian War, revealing weaknesses in organization and supply, and weaknesses in basing the fleet at Stockholm. The navy was bolstered with the founding of a naval base at Karlskrona in 1680 which became the main base of future operations. Today it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. =Assimilation of the newest territories= Development of the Swedish Empire in Early Modern Europe (1560‚Äì1815) Charles believed it was very important to assimilate the new Swedish territories of Scania, Blekinge, Halland, in southern Sweden; Bohusl√§n in western Sweden and J√§mtland, in northern Sweden, and the island of Gotland. Some assimilation policies included: the ban of all books written in Danish or Norwegian, thus breaking the promise made at the Treaty of Roskilde; the use of Swedish language in the conduct of sermons; and all new priests and teachers having to come from Sweden.√Öberg (1958), pp.135‚Äì146Rystad (2003) pp.307‚Äì344 The king had seen bitter resentment from the Scanian peasants during the Scanian War and was particularly tough on that province. The guerrilla Snapphane movement, in northern Scania, had attacked his soldiers and stolen his money. They also had strong support from the local villages. Charles remained sceptical about the Scanian inhabitants throughout his life. He did not allow soldiers from Scania in his Scanian regiment: the 1,200 soldiers that were to be stationed there had to be recruited from more northern provinces. He also advocated rough treatment of the inhabitants and the first Governor-General of Scania, his trusted aide Johan Gyllenstierna (governor-general 1679‚Äì1680), was notably brutal in his treatment of the locals. The rule of Rutger von Ascheberg (governor-general 1680‚Äì1693), proved more lenient. The assimilation was not as strongly implemented in the German dominions of Swedish Pomerania, Bremen-Verden, and the Baltic dominions (Estonia and Livonia). In Germany, Charles found himself being opposed by the Estates there. He was also bound by the law of the German emperor and the peace treaty. In the Baltic, the power structure was completely different, with a German-descended nobility that used serfs, something that Charles abhorred and wanted to abolish but was unable to. Finally, Kexholm and Ingria were sparsely populated and not of great interest. =Church= Charles was a devoted Lutheran Christian. In February 1686, a church law was put forth on his initiative. The church order declared that the king was ruler of the Church in the same way that he ruled the country and God ruled the world. Attending sermons on Sunday was made obligatory and ordinary people found walking around on the streets during that time risked being arrested. Three years later, he declared it obligatory for all commoners to learn to read a catechism written by archbishop Olov Svebilius and then-bishop Haqvin Spegel so that they would understand the \\"magnificence of God\\".√Öberg (1958), pp.157‚Äì166Rystad (2003) pp.345‚Äì357 Charles encouraged the production of a hymnal (Psalmbok) to be printed and distributed to the churches (completed 1693), and a new printed version of the Bible that was completed in 1703 and named after his successor: Charles XII Bible. Family matters Ulrika Eleonora, Charles's wife Arvid Karlsteen, Charles XI and Ulrica Eleonora of Denmark, 1680, National Gallery of Art Charles XI:s family, 1690s The death of Prince Ulric as painted by David Kl√∂cker Ehrenstrahl Gartered coat of arms of Charles XI, King of Sweden, KG On 6 May 1680, Charles married Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark (1656‚Äì1693), daughter of King Frederick III of Denmark (1609‚Äì1670). He had previously been engaged to his cousin, Juliana of Hesse-Eschwege, but the engagement was broken after a scandal. Charles and Ulrika were engaged in 1675 in an attempt to smooth over longstanding hostilities, but the Scanian War soon broke out. During the war, Ulrika Eleonora gained a reputation for loyalty to her future home country by exhibiting kindness to Swedish prisoners: she pawned her jewelry, even her engagement ring, to care for the Swedish prisoners of war. Her personal merits and continued charitable acts throughout her tenure endeared her to the Swedish people and eased some of the difficulties brought on by her Danish background.Nanna Lundh-Eriksson (1947). Hedvig Eleonora. Stockholm: Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand. ISBN (Swedish) In the peace negotiations between Sweden and Denmark in 1679, the marriage between her and Charles XI was on the agenda, and ratified on 26 September 1679. They married at Skottorp on May 6, 1680 in a hasty ceremony, as Charles prioritized government work over private matters, even a marriage ceremony. Charles and Ulrika Eleonora were very different. He enjoyed hunting and riding, while she enjoyed reading and art, and is best remembered for her great charitable activity. She was also limited by ill-health and numerous pregnancies. Charles was very active and busy and while Charles was away inspecting his troops or pursuing his pastimes, she was often lonely and sad. The marriage itself, however, is considered a success, with the King and Queen being very fond of each other. As queen, Ulrika Eleonora had little political involvement and was placed in the shadow of her mother-in-law. During \\"The Great Reversion\\" to the crown of counties, baronies and large lordships from the nobility, Ulrika tried to speak on the behalf of the people whose property was confiscated by the crown. But the king told her that the reason he had married her was not because he wanted her political advice. Instead, she helped people whose property had been confiscated by secretly compensating them economically from her own budget. However Charles XI's confidence in her grew over time: in 1690, he named her future Regent, should his son succeed him still a minor. Instead Ulrika Eleonora predeceased him by almost four years. At the time of her death she was personally supporting 17,000 people.Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark in CF Bricka, Danish biographical encyclopaedia (1st edition, 1904) It is said that on his death bed, Charles XI admitted to his mother that he hadn't been happy since Ulrika Eleonora's death.Rystad (2003), pp.287‚Äì289 The marriage produced seven children, of whom only three outlived Charles: * Hedwig Sophia (1681‚Äì1708), duchess of Holstein-Gottorp and grandmother of Tsar Peter III; * Charles XII (1682‚Äì1718), who succeeded him to the throne; he had no issue *Gustav (1683‚Äì1685) *Ulric (1684‚Äì1685) *Frederick (1685‚Äì1685) *Charles Gustav (1686‚Äì1687) *Ulrika Eleonora (\\"the younger\\", 1688‚Äì1741), who succeeded her brother on the Swedish throne; no issue Ulrika Eleonora (the elder) was sickly, and the many child births eventually broke her. When she became seriously ill, in 1693, Charles finally dedicated his time and care to her. Her death in July that year shook him deeply and he never fully recovered. Her infant son Ulric (1684‚Äì1685) had been given Ulriksdal Palace, which was renamed for him (Ulric's Dale). Death Charles XI on lit de parade, 1697. Charles' coffin at Riddarholmen Church Charles XI had complained of stomach pains since 1694. In the summer of 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had continuously become worse, but they had no viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.Rystad (2003), pp.368‚Äì369 Legacy Image of King Carl XI on a wall of Stockholm Palace. Charles XI has sometimes been described in Sweden as the greatest of all the Swedish kings, except for Gustavus II Adolphus, unduly eclipsed by his father and his son. In the first half of the 20th century, the view of him changed and he was regarded as dependent, uncertain, and easily influenced by others.Back-cover of √Öberg (1958) In the most recent book, Rystads biography from 2003, the king is again characterized as a strong-willed shaper of Sweden through economic reforms and achievement of financial and military stability and strength.Back-cover of Rystad (2003) Charles XI was commemorated on the previous 500-kronor bill. His portrait is taken from one of Ehrenstrahl's paintings, possibly the one displayed on this page. The king is pictured on the bill since the Bank of Sweden was founded in 1668, during Charles' reign. 500-kronorssedeln ‚Äì From Bank of Sweden official site. Accessed 2 September 2008 The fortified town of Carlsburg near Bremen, at the site of modern Bremerhaven, was named after Charles XI. The Swedish town of Karlskrona, built during his reign to host the primary navy base in southern Sweden, which it remains to this day, is also named after him. Charles' Church in Tallinn, Estonia, is dedicated to Charles XI.

He belonged to the House of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken, a branch line of the House of Wittelsbach. Charles was the only surviving son of Charles XI and Ulrika Eleonora the Elder. He assumed power, after a seven-month caretaker government, at the age of fifteen. In 1700, a triple alliance of Denmark‚ÄìNorway, Saxony‚ÄìPoland‚ÄìLithuania and Russia launched a threefold attack on the Swedish protectorate of Holstein-Gottorp and provinces of Livonia and Ingria, aiming to draw advantage as the Swedish Empire was unaligned and ruled by a young and inexperienced king, thus initiating the Great Northern War. Leading the Swedish army against the alliance Charles won multiple victories despite being usually significantly outnumbered. A major victory over a Russian army some three times the size in 1700 at the Battle of Narva compelled Peter the Great to sue for peace which Charles then rejected. By 1706 Charles, now 24 years old, had forced all of his foes into submission including, in that year, a decisively devastating victory by Swedish forces under general Carl Gustav Rehnski√∂ld over a combined army of Saxony and Russia at the Battle of Fraustadt. Russia was now the sole remaining hostile power. Charles' subsequent march on Moscow met with initial success as victory followed victory, the most significant of which was the Battle of Holowczyn where the smaller Swedish army routed a Russian army twice the size. The campaign ended with disaster when the Swedish army suffered heavy losses to a Russian force more than twice its size at Poltava. Charles had been incapacitated by a wound prior to the battle, rendering him unable to take command. The defeat was followed by the Surrender at Perevolochna. Charles spent the following years in exile in the Ottoman Empire before returning to lead an assault on Norway, trying to evict the Danish king from the war once more in order to aim all his forces at the Russians. Two campaigns met with frustration and ultimate failure, concluding with his death at the Siege of Fredriksten in 1718. At the time, most of the Swedish Empire was under foreign military occupation, though Sweden itself was still free. This situation was later formalized, albeit moderated in the subsequent Treaty of Nystad. The result was the end of the Swedish Empire, and also of its effectively organized absolute monarchy and war machine, commencing a parliamentary government unique for continental Europe, which would last for half a century until royal autocracy was restored by Gustav III. Charles was an exceptionally skilled military leader and tactician as well as an able politician, credited with introducing important tax and legal reforms. As for his famous reluctance towards peace efforts, he is quoted by Voltaire as saying upon the outbreak of the war; \\"I have resolved never to start an unjust war but never to end a legitimate one except by defeating my enemies\\". With the war consuming more than half his life and nearly all his reign, he never married and fathered no children. He was succeeded by his sister Ulrika Eleonora, who in turn was coerced to hand over all substantial powers to the Riksdag of the Estates and opted to surrender the throne to her husband, who became King Frederick I of Sweden.  Royal title  The 15-year- old Charles in 1697 as king of the Swedish Empire Charles, like all kings, was styled by a royal title, which combined all his titles into one single phrase. This was: We Charles, by the Grace of God King of Sweden, the Goths and the Vends, Grand Prince of Finland, Duke of Scania, Estonia, Livonia and Karelia, Lord of Ingria, Duke of Bremen, Verden and Pomerania, Prince of R√ºgen and Lord of Wismar, and also Count Palatine by the Rhine, Duke in Bavaria, Count of Zweibr√ºcken‚ÄìKleeburg, as well as Duke of J√ºlich, Cleve and Berg, Count of Veldenz, Spanheim and Ravensberg and Lord of Ravenstein. The fact that Charles was crowned as Charles XII does not mean that he was the 12th king of Sweden by that name. Swedish kings Erik XIV (1560‚Äì1568) and Charles IX (1604‚Äì1611) gave themselves numerals after studying a mythological history of Sweden. He was actually the 6th King Charles.Article Karl in Nordisk familjebok. The non- mathematical numbering tradition continues with the current King of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, being counted as the equivalent of Charles XVI. Great Northern War = Early campaigns = Charles XIII which has lions similarly arranged; that statue is known as \\"the pot between four lions\\" (\\"Krukan mellan fyra lejon\\"), referring to a Swedish slang expression for a coward. Around 1700, the monarchs of Denmark‚ÄìNorway, Saxony (ruled by elector August II of Poland, who was also the king of Poland-Lithuania) and Russia united in an alliance against Sweden, largely through the efforts of Johann Reinhold Patkul, a Livonian nobleman who turned traitor when the \\"great reduction\\" of Charles XI in 1680 stripped much of the nobility of lands and properties. In late 1699 Charles sent a minor detachment to reinforce his brother-in-law Duke Frederick IV of Holstein-Gottorp, who was attacked by Danish forces the following year. A Saxon army simultaneously invaded Swedish Livonia and in February 1700 surrounded Riga, the most populous city of the Swedish Empire. Russia also declared war (August 1700), but stopped short of an attack on Swedish Ingria until September 1700. Charles's first campaign was against Denmark‚ÄìNorway, ruled by his cousin Frederick IV of Denmark, For this campaign Charles secured the support of England and the Netherlands, both maritime powers concerned with Denmark's threats to close the Sound. Leading a force of 8,000 and 43 ships in an invasion of Zealand, Charles rapidly compelled the Danes to submit to the Peace of Travendal in August 1700, which indemnified Holstein.Thomas Derry, History of Scandinavia: Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland (2000), p. 154. Having forced Denmark‚ÄìNorway to make peace within months, King Charles turned his attention upon the two other powerful neighbors, King August II (cousin to both Charles XII and Frederick IV of Denmark‚ÄìNorway) and Peter the Great of Russia, who also had entered the war against him, ironically on the same day that Denmark came to terms. Russia had opened their part of the war by invading the Swedish-held territories of Livonia and Estonia. Charles countered this by attacking the Russian besiegers at the Battle of Narva (November 1700). The Russians outnumbered the Swedish army of ten thousand men by almost four to one. Charles attacked under cover of a blizzard, effectively split the Russian army in two and won the battle. Many of Peter's troops who fled the battlefield drowned in the Narva River. The total number of Russian fatalities reached about 10,000 at the end of the battle, while the Swedish forces lost 667 men.Richard Cavendish, \\"The Battle of Narva.\\" History Today 50#11 (2000): 50+. Charles did not pursue the Russian army. Instead, he turned against Poland-Lithuania, which was formally neutral at this point, thereby disregarding Polish negotiation proposals supported by the Swedish parliament. Charles defeated the Polish king Augustus II and his Saxon allies at the Battle of Kliszow in 1702 and captured many cities of the Commonwealth. After the deposition of Augustus as king of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, Charles XII put Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski as his puppet on the Polish throne (1704). = Russian resurgence = Charles XII and Mazepa at the Dnieper River after Poltava by Gustaf Cederstr√∂m While Charles won several decisive battles in the Commonwealth and ultimately secured the coronation of his ally Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski and the surrender of Saxony, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great embarked on a military reform plan that improved the Russian army, using the effectively organized Swedes and other European standards for role models. Russian forces managed to penetrate Ingria and established a new city, Saint Petersburg, there. Charles planned an invasion of the Russian heartland, allying himself with Ivan Mazepa, Hetman of the Ukrainian Cossacks. The size of the invading Swedish army was peeled off as Charles left Leszczy≈Ñski with some 24,000 German and Polish troops, departing eastwards from Saxony in late 1707 with some 35,000 men, adding a further 12,500 under Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt marching from Livonia. Charles left the homeland with a defense of approximately 28,800 men, with a further 14,000 in Swedish Finland as well as further garrisons in the Baltic and German provinces.Karoliner by Alf √Öberg, p. 117.Karl XII by Bengt Liljegren, pp. 151 and 163. After securing his \\"favorite\\" victory in the Battle of Holowczyn, despite being outnumbered over three to one against the new Russian army, Charles opted to march eastwards on Moscow rather than try to seize Saint Petersburg, founded from the Swedish town of Nyenskans five years earlier.Svenska slagf√§lt, page 280. Peter the Great managed, however, to ambush Lewenhaupt's army at Lesnaya before Charles could combine his forces, thus losing valuable supplies, artillery and half of Lewenhaupt's men. Charles' Polish ally, Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, was facing internal problems of his own. Charles expected the support of a massive Cossack rebellion led by Mazepa in Ukraine, with estimates suggesting Mazepa of being able to muster some 40,000 troops, but the Russians subjugated the rebellion and destroyed its capital Baturin before the arrival of the Swedish troops. The harsh climate took its toll as well, as Charles marched his troops for winter camp in Ukraine.Svenska folkets underbara √∂den, book four by Carl Grimberg, about the numbers of Mazepa's army. By the time of the decisive Battle of Poltava, Charles had been wounded, one-third of his infantry was dead, and his supply train was destroyed. The king was incapacitated by a coma resulting from his injuries and was unable to lead the Swedish forces. With the numbers of Charles' army reduced to some 23,000, with several wounded and handling the siege of Poltava, his general Carl Gustav Rehnski√∂ld had a clearly inferior force to face the fortified and modernized army of Tsar Peter, with some 45,000 men.Bra B√∂ckers Lexikon, the article of Karl XII. The Swedish assault ended in disaster, and the king fled with a small entourage south to the Ottoman Empire, where he set up camp at Bender with some 1,000 of his Caroleans (\\"Karoliner\\" in Swedish). The remainder of the army surrendered days later at Perevolochna under Lewenhaupt's command, most of them (including Lewenhaupt himself) spending the rest of their days in Russian captivity. The Swedish defeat at Poltava in 1709 marks the downfall of the Swedish Empire, as well as the founding of the Russian Empire. = Exile in the Ottoman Empire = Royal Monogram The Ottomans initially welcomed the Swedish king, where he went to Abdurrahman Pasha, the commander of the √ñz√º Castle, as he was about to fall into the hands of the Russian army, and he was able to take refuge in the castle at the last moment. Afterwards, he settled in Bender at the invitation of its governor, Yusuf Pasha. In the meantime, Charles sent Stanislaw Poniatowski and as his messengers to Constantinople.Herman Lindquist (in Swedish): Historian om Sverige. Storhet och Fall. (History of Sweden. Greatness and fall) 91-7263-092-2 (2000) Nordstedts f√∂rlag, Stockholm They managed to indirectly contact with G√ºlnu≈ü Sultan, mother of Sultan Ahmed III, who became intrigued by Charles, in which she took an interest in his cause, and even corresponded with him in Bender. His expenses during his long stay in the Ottoman Empire were covered by the Ottoman state budget, as part of the fixed assets (Demirba≈ü in Turkish), hence his nickname Demirba≈ü ≈ûarl (Fixed Asset Charles) in Turkey. Eventually, a small village named Karlstad (Varni»õa) had to be built near Bender to accommodate the ever-growing Swedish population there. Sultan Ahmet III, as a gesture to the King, had bought some of the Swedish women and children put up for sale by the Russians and turned them over to the Swedes, thus further strengthening the growing community of Caroleans. G√ºlnu≈ü Sultan convinced her son to declare war against Russia, as she thought that Charles was a man worth taking a risk for. Later on, the Ottomans and Russians signed the Treaty of the Pruth and Treaty of Adrianople to end the hostilities between them. The treaties dissatisfied pro-war party, supported by King Charles and Stanislaw Poniatowski who failed to reignite the conflict. However, the sultan Ahmed III's subjects in the empire eventually got tired of Charles' scheming. His entourage also accumulated huge amounts of debts with Bender merchants. Eventually, \\"crowds\\" of townspeople attacked the Swedish colony at Bender and Charles had to defend himself against the mobs and the Ottoman Janissaries involved. This uprising was called \\"kalabalƒ±k\\" (Turkish for crowd) which afterwards found a place in Swedish lexicon referring to a ruckus. The Janissaries did not shoot Charles during the skirmish at Bender, but captured him and put him under house-arrest at Dimetoka (nowadays Didimoticho) and Constantinople. During his semi- imprisonment the King played chess and studied the Ottoman Navy and the naval architecture of the Ottoman galleons. His sketches and designs eventually led to the famous Swedish war ships Jarramas (Yaramaz) and Jilderim (Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m). Meanwhile, Russia and Poland regained and expanded their borders. Great Britain, an adversary of Sweden, defected from its alliance obligations while Prussia attacked Swedish holdings in Germany. Russia occupied Finland (the Greater Wrath 1713‚Äì1721). After defeats of the Swedish army, consisting mainly of Finnish troops in the Battle of P√§lk√§ne 1713 and the Battle of Storkyro 1714, the military, administration and clergymen escaped from Finland, which fell under Russian military regime. During his five-year stay in the Ottoman Empire, Charles XII corresponded with his sister (and eventual successor), Ulrika Eleonora. According to Mrs. Ragnhild Marie Hatton, a Norwegian-British historian, in some of those letters Charles expressed his desire for a peace treaty which would be defensible in the future Swedish generations' eyes. However, he emphasized that only a greater respect for Sweden in Europe would enable him to achieve such a peace treaty. Meanwhile, the Swedish Council of State (government) and Estates/Diet (Parliament) tried to keep the beleaguered Sweden somehow organized and independent. Eventually, in the autumn of 1714, their warning letter reached him. In it, those executive and legislative bodies told the absentee King that unless he quickly returned to Sweden, they would independently conclude an achievable peace treaty with Russia, Poland and Denmark. This stark admonition prompted Charles to rush back to Sweden.R.M. Hatton, Charles XII of Sweden, London, 1968; Seppo Zetterberg et al. (eds.), A Small Giant (Compendium) of the Finnish History / Suomen historian pikkuj√§ttil√§inen. 2nd edition. Helsinki, Finland, 2003) Charles traveled back to Sweden with a group of Ottomans, soldiers such as escorts and businessmen to whom he promised to repay his debts during his stay in the Ottoman Empire, but they had to wait several years before that happened. According to the prevailing church law in Sweden at that time, all who lived in the country, but were not members of the Swedish state church, would be baptized. In order for the Jewish and Muslim creditors to avoid this, Charles wrote a \\"free letter\\" so that they could practice their religions without being punished. The soldiers chose to remain in Sweden instead of difficult trips home. They were called \\"Askersson\\" (the word asker in Turkish means soldier). In the course of history, the descendants of these Turks who were still living in Sweden were swept away. =Pomerania and Norway= Karl XII, 1707. Skokloster Castle. The Royal Armoury in Stockholm. romanticized painting by Gustaf Cederstr√∂m, 1884 Charles agreed to leave Constantinople and returned to Swedish Pomerania. He made the journey on horseback, riding across Europe in just fifteen days. He traveled across the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary to Vienna and arrived at Stralsund. A medal with Charles on horseback, his long hair flying in the wind, was struck in 1714 to commemorate the speedy ride. It reads Was sorget Ihr doch? Gott und Ich leben noch. (What worries you so? God and I live still.). After five years away, Charles arrived in Sweden to find his homeland at war with Russia, Saxony, Hannover, Great Britain and Denmark. Sweden's western enemies attacked southern and western Sweden while Russian forces traveled across Finland to attack the Stockholm district. For the first time, Sweden found itself in a defensive war. Charles' plan was to attack Denmark by striking at her possessions in Norway. It was hoped that by cutting Denmark's Norwegian supply lines the Danes would be compelled to withdraw their forces from Swedish Scania. Charles invaded Norway in 1716 with a combined force of 7,000 men. He occupied the capital of Christiania, (modern Oslo), and laid siege to the Akershus fortress there. Due to a lack of heavy siege cannons he was unable to dislodge the Norwegian forces inside. After suffering significant losses of men and materiel, Charles was forced to retreat from the capital on 29 April. In the following mid-May, Charles invaded again, this time striking the border town of Fredrikshald, now Halden, in an attempt to capture the fortress of Fredriksten. The attacking Swedes came under heavy cannon fire from the fortress and were forced to withdraw when the Norwegians set the town of Fredrikshald on fire. Swedish casualties in Fredrikshald were estimated at 500 men. While the siege at Fredrikshald was underway, the Swedish supply fleet was attacked and defeated by Tordenskjold in the Battle of Dynekilen. In 1718 Charles once more invaded Norway. With a main force of 40,000 men, he again laid siege to the fortress of Fredriksten overlooking the town of Fredrikshald. Charles was shot in the head and killed during the siege, while he was inspecting trenches. The invasion was abandoned, and Charles' body was returned to Sweden. A second force, under Carl Gustaf Armfeldt, marched against Trondheim with 10,000 men but was forced to retreat. In the march that ensued, many of the 5,800 remaining men perished in a severe winter storm. Death While in the trenches close to the perimeter of the fortress on 11 December (30 November Old Style), 1718, Charles was struck in the head by a projectile and killed. The shot struck the left side of his skull and exited from the right. The shock of the impact caused the king to grasp his sword with his right hand, and cover the wound with his left hand, leaving his gloves covered in blood. The definitive circumstances around Charles's death remain unclear. Despite multiple investigations of the battlefield, Charles's skull and his clothes, it is not known where and when he was hit, or whether the shot came from the ranks of the enemy or from his own men. There are several hypotheses as to how Charles died, though none can be given with any certainty. Although there were many people around the king at the time of his death, there were no known witnesses to the actual moment he was struck. A likely explanation has been that Charles was killed by the Dano-Norwegians as he was within easy reach of their guns. There are two possibilities that are usually cited: that he was killed by a musket shot, or that he was killed by grapeshot from the nearby fortress. More sinister theories claim he was assassinated: One is that the killer was a Swedish compatriot and asserts that enemy guns were not firing at the time Charles was struck. Suspects in this claim range from a nearby soldier tired of the siege and wanting to put an end to the war, to an assassin hired by Charles's own brother-in-law, who profited from the event by subsequently taking the throne himself as Frederick I of Sweden, that person being Frederick's aide-de-camp, Andr√© Sicre. Sicre confessed during what was claimed to be a state of delirium brought on by fever but later recanted. It has also been suspected that a plot to kill Charles may have been put in place by a group of wealthy Swedes who would benefit from the blocking of a 17% wealth tax that Charles intended to introduce. In the Varberg Fortress museum there is a display with a lead filled brass button - Swedish - that is claimed by some to be the projectile that killed the king. Another odd account of Charles' death comes from Finnish writer Carl Nordling, who states that the king's surgeon, Melchior Neumann, dreamed the king had told him that he was not shot from the fortress but from \\"one who came creeping\\". From the autopsy of Charles XII in 1917 Charles XII's sarcophagus in Riddarholmen Church, Stockholm Charles's body has been exhumed on three occasions to ascertain the cause of death; in 1746, 1859 and 1917. The 1859 exhumation found that the wound was in accordance with a shot from the Norwegian fort. In 1917, his head was photographed. Peter Englund asserted in his essay \\"On the death of Charles XII and other murdersF√∂rflutenhetens landskap (\\"The Landscape of Times Past\\") (1991), collection of essays, pp. 126‚Äì129.\\" that the mortal wound sustained by the King, with a smaller exit wound than entry wound, would be consistent with being hit by a bullet with a speed not exceeding 150 m/s, concluding that Charles was killed by stray grapeshot from the nearby fortress. Charles was succeeded to the Swedish throne by his sister, Ulrika Eleonora. As his duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken required a male heir, Charles was succeeded as ruler there by his cousin Gustav Leopold. Georg Heinrich von G√∂rtz, Charles' minister, was beheaded in 1719. Personal life Charles never married and fathered no children of whom historians are aware. In his youth he was particularly encouraged to find a suitable spouse in order to secure the succession, but he would frequently avoid the subject of sex and marriage. Possible candidates included Princess Sophia Hedwig of Denmark and Princess Maria Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp ‚Äì but of the latter he pleaded that he could never wed someone \\"as ugly as Satan and with such a devilish big mouth\\".R. M. Hatton, Charles XII of Sweden, 1968, p. 89. Instead he made it clear that he would marry only someone of his own choice, and for love rather than dynastic pressures. His lack of mistresses may have been due to a strong religious faith.Frans Bengtsson, The Life of Charles XII, p. 38. Charles himself suggested in conversation with Axel L√∂wen that he actively resisted any match until peace could be securedLiljegren, Karl XII: en biografi. and was in some sense \\"married\\" to the military life.R. M. Hatton, Charles XII of Sweden, 1968, p. 210.Frans Bengtsson, The Life of Charles XII, p. 469. But that he was \\"chaste\\" occasioned speculation in his lifetime. Rumours that he was a hermaphrodite were quelled in 1917 when his coffin was opened and he was shown to have suffered no physical irregularities.R. M. Hatton, Charles XII of Sweden, 1968, p. 219. Portrait of King Charles XII, by Michael Dahl. c. 1710 - 1717 In his conversations with L√∂wen, he also stated that he did not lack taste for beautiful women, but that he held in his sexual desires for fear that they would get out of control if unchecked, and that if he committed to something like that, it would be forever.R. M. Hatton, Charles XII of Sweden, 1968, p. 220. Some historians suggest that he resisted a marriage with Denmark which could have caused a family rift between those who dynastically favoured Holstein-Gottorp.Byron Nordstrom, Dictionary of Scandinavian History, p. 317. Historians such as Blanning and Montefiore believe he was in fact homosexual.Tim Blanning, Frederick the Great, 2015, p. 152.Simon Sebag Montefiore, The Romanovs: 1613-1918, 2016, p. 451. Certainly a letter from Reuterholm suggested that Charles had indicated a closeness to the Elector Prince of Saxony, Maximilian Emanuel of W√ºrttemberg-Winnental, whom Charles described as \\"very pretty\\". But writing in the 1960s, Hatton argues that Wurttemberg was very much heterosexual and the relationship is just as likely to have been that of teacher-pupil ‚Äì suggesting instead that Charles simply had an interest in the opposite sex never consummated.  Legacy  Charles XII by Johann Heinrich Wedekind Exceptional for abstaining from alcohol and sex, he felt most comfortable during warfare. Contemporaries report of his seemingly inhuman tolerance for pain and his utter lack of emotion. His brilliant campaigning and startling victories brought his country to the pinnacle of her prestige and power, although the Great Northern War resulted in Sweden's defeat and the end of her empire within years of his own death. Charles' death marked the end of autocratic kingship in Sweden, and the subsequent Age of Liberty saw a shift of power from the monarch to the parliament of the estates. Historians of the late 18th and early 19th centuries viewed Charles' death as the result of an aristocratic plot, and Gustav IV Adolf, the king who refused to settle with Napoleon Bonaparte, \\"identified himself with Charles as a type of righteous man struggling with iniquity\\" (Roberts). Repr. 2003. Throughout the 19th century's romantic nationalism Charles XII was viewed as a national hero. He was idealized as a heroic, virtuous young warrior king, and his fight against Peter the Great was associated with the contemporary Swedish-Russian enmity. Repr. 2003. Examples of the romantic hero idolatry of Charles XII in several genres are Esaias Tegn√©r's song Kung Karl, den unge hj√§lte (1818), Johan Peter Molin's statue in Stockholm's Kungstr√§dg√•rden (unveiled on 30 November 1868, the 150th anniversary of Charles' death) and Gustaf Cederstr√∂m's painting Karl XII:s likf√§rd (\\"Funeral procession of Charles XII\\", 1878). The date of Charles' death was chosen by a student association in Lund for annual torch marches beginning in 1853. In 1901, August Strindberg in his play Karl XII broke with the heroization practice, showing an introverted Charles XII in conflict with his impoverished subjects. In the so-called Strindberg feud (1910‚Äì1912), his response to the \\"Swedish cult of Charles XII\\" (Steene) was that Charles had been \\"Sweden's ruin, the great offender, a ruffian, the rowdies' idol, a counterfeiter.\\" Verner von Heidenstam however, one of his opponents in the feud, in his book Karolinerna instead \\"emphasized the heroic steadfastness of the Swedish people in the somber years of trial during the long-drawn-out campaigns of Karl XII\\" (Scott). In the 1930s, the Swedish Nazis held celebrations on the date of Charles XII's death, and shortly before the outbreak of World War II, Adolf Hitler received from Sweden a sculpture of the king at his birthday. In the late 20th century, Swedish nationalists and neo- Nazis had again used 30 November as a date for their ceremonies, however these were regularly interrupted by larger counter-demonstrations and were abandoned. On the use of Charles XII by nationalists and Nazis in general = Scientific contributions = Apart from being a monarch, the King's interests included mathematics, and anything that would be beneficial to his warlike purposes. He is credited with having invented an octal numeral system, which he considered more suitable for war purposes because all the boxes used for materials such as gunpowder were cubic. According to a report by contemporary scientist Emanuel Swedenborg, the King had sketched a model of his thoughts on a piece of paper and handed it to him at their meeting in Lund in 1716. The paper was reportedly still in existence a hundred years later but has since been lost. =Literature= Charles fascinated many in his time. In 1731, Voltaire wrote a biography of Charles XII, History of Charles XII. Voltaire portrays the Swedish king in a positive light, against the brutal nature of Peter the Great. Samuel Johnson, a devoted anti-militarian, wrote in his poem \\"The Vanity of Human Wishes\\": Swedish author Frans G. Bengtsson and Professor Ragnhild Hatton have written biographies of Charles XII of Sweden. Charles XII figures quite prominently in Robert Massie's magnum opus Peter the Great.  Ancestors  Coat of Arms of the House of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken  In popular culture  August Strindberg's 1901 play Carl XII is about him. The 1925 Swedish film Charles XII was a silent epic portraying his reign. In the 1983 comedy film ', Charles XII is portrayed by G√∂sta Ekman. In 2007, Oleg Ryaskov again portrayed Charles XII (Eduard Flerov) in the Russian drama The Sovereign's Servant. Charles XII appears in the absurdist comedy A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence (2014), in which his army passes a modern- day cafe on their way to, and retreating from, the Battle of Poltava. He is played by Viktor Gyllenberg. The Swedish power metal band Sabaton wrote an album named after him, which includes several songs about his life.

He is best known for his 1973 novel The Boat (Das Boot), which became an international bestseller and was adapted in 1981 as an Oscar- nominated film. Early life Buchheim was born in Weimar, in the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (present-day Thuringia), the second son of artist Charlotte Buchheim. She was unmarried, and he was raised by his mother and her parents. They lived in Weimar until 1924, then Rochlitz until 1932, and finally Chemnitz. He began contributing to newspapers in his teens and put on an exhibition of his drawings in 1933, when he was 15. He travelled to the Baltic Sea with his brother, and canoed along the Danube to the Black Sea. After taking his Abitur in 1937, he spent time in Italy, where he wrote his first book, Tage und N√§chte steigen aus dem Strom. Eine Donaufahrt (\\"Days and nights rise from the river. A journey on the Danube\\"), published in 1941. He studied art in Dresden and Munich in 1939, and volunteered for the Kriegsmarine in 1940. Second World War Buchheim was a Sonderf√ºhrer in a propaganda unit of the Kriegsmarine in the Second World War, writing as a war correspondent about his experiences on minesweepers, destroyers and submarines. He also made drawings and took photographs. As a Leutnant zur See in the autumn of 1941, Buchheim joined Kapit√§nleutnant Heinrich Lehmann- Willenbrock and the crew of on her seventh patrol in the Battle of the Atlantic. His orders were to photograph and describe the U-boat in action. From his experiences, he wrote a short story, \\"Die Eichenlaubfahrt\\" (The Oak- Leaves Patrol; Lehmann-Willenbrock had been awarded the Knight's Cross with oak leaves). Buchheim ended the war as an Oberleutnant zur See. Post-war career After the war, Buchheim worked as an artist, art collector, gallery owner, art auctioneer and art publisher. Through the 1950s and 1960s, he established an art publishing house, and he wrote books on Georges Braque, Max Beckmann, Otto Mueller and Pablo Picasso. He collected works by French and German Expressionist artists, from groups including Die Br√ºcke and Der Blaue Reiter, such as Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Max Pechstein, Emil Nolde, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Franz Marc, Gabriele M√ºnter, Alexej von Jawlensky, and Max Beckmann. These works had been derided as \\"degenerate\\" during the Nazi period, and he was able to buy them cheaply. In 1973 he published a novel based on his wartime experiences, ' (The Boat), a fictionalised autobiographical account narrated by a \\"Leutnant Werner\\". It became the best- selling German fiction work on the war. His novel was followed by a non- fiction work, U-Boot-Krieg (U-Boat War) in 1976, which became the first part of a trilogy, together with U-Boot-Fahrer (U-Boat Sailors, 1985), and Zu Tode Gesiegt (Victory in the Face of Death, 1988). The trilogy includes over 5,000 photographs taken during World War II. He is also the author of the novels Die Festung (The Fortress, 1995), based on travels home across France in 1944, and Der Abschied (The Parting, 2000), about the nuclear-powered cargo vessel NS Otto Hahn. Das Boot was turned into a film in 1981, featuring J√ºrgen Prochnow as the captain and the debut of Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer as \\"Leutnant Werner\\". Director Wolfgang Petersen and Buchheim fell out after the author was not allowed to write the script. (Buchheim was always noted for his short temper ‚Äì he was later nicknamed the \\"Starnberg volcano\\".) The film was the most expensive German film ever made. It was nominated for six Oscars. Even though impressed by the technological accuracy of the film's set-design and port construction buildings, Buchheim expressed great disappointment with Petersen's adaptation in a film review published in 1981, describing Petersen's film as converting his clearly anti-war novel into a blend of a \\"cheap, shallow American action flick\\" and a \\"contemporary German propaganda newsreel from World War II\\". He also criticised the hysterical overacting of the cast, which he called highly unrealistic, despite their talent. Buchheim, after several attempts for an American adaptation had failed, had provided his own script as soon as Petersen was chosen as new director. It would have been a six-hour epic; Petersen turned him down because the producers were aiming for a 90-minute feature for international release. However, today's Director's Cut of Das Boot amounts to over 200 minutes, and the complete TV version of the film is 282 minutes long. Later life In later life, Buchheim sought a location to house his art collection, including curiosities ranging from nutcrackers and Thai shadow puppets to mannequins and carousel animals in addition to his important collection of German Expressionist paintings and graphics. A building was constructed in Duisburg, but he considered it unfit, and he turned down offers from Weimar, Munich and Berlin. After years of quarreling with his home town of Feldafing, Bavaria, about his plans for a museum for his art collection, the town's citizens voted against the museum in a referendum. His museum finally opened in 2001 as the Museum der Phantasie in Bernried on the shore of Lake Starnberg, funded by the government of Bavaria. The entire collection has been estimated to be worth up to $300 million.  Private life and death  Despite a fortune estimated at 14.1 million Swiss francs in the late 1980s, Buchheim became known for parsimony. He used a camping table in his dining room, and according to his son, did not pay taxes and reused print blocks made by Otto M√ºller, forging the artist's initials. He died of heart failure in Starnberg, survived by his wife, Diethild, and two children.

Most often seen in dramatic literature, the term can describe either a tragic play which contains enough comic elements to lighten the overall mood or a serious play with a happy ending. Tragicomedy, as its name implies, invokes the intended response of both the tragedy and the comedy in the audience, the former being a genre based on human suffering that invokes an accompanying catharsis and the latter being a genre intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter.  In theatre  =Classical precedent= Tragic Comic masks of Ancient Greek theatre represented in the Hadrian's Villa mosaic. There is no concise formal definition of tragicomedy from the classical age. It appears that the Greek philosopher Aristotle had something like the Renaissance meaning of the term (that is, a serious action with a happy ending) in mind when, in Poetics, he discusses tragedy with a dual ending.Poetics: XIII, End of 2nd paragraph, Trans: Bywater, Ingram, 1920 In this respect, a number of Greek and Roman plays, for instance Alcestis, may be called tragicomedies, though without any definite attributes outside of plot. The word itself originates with the Roman comic playwright Plautus, who coined the term somewhat facetiously in the prologue to his play Amphitryon. The character Mercury, sensing the indecorum of the inclusion of both kings and gods alongside servants in a comedy, declares that the play had better be a \\"tragicomoedia\\": =Renaissance revivals= Italy Plautus's comment had an arguably excessive impact on Renaissance aesthetic theory, which had largely transformed Aristotle's comments on drama into a rigid theory. For \\"rule mongers\\" (the term is Giordano Bruno's), \\"mixed\\" works such as those mentioned above, more recent \\"romances\\" such as Orlando Furioso, and even The Odyssey were at best puzzles; at worst, mistakes. Two figures helped to elevate tragicomedy to the status of a regular genre, by which is meant one with its own set of rigid rules. Giovanni Battista Giraldi Cinthio, in the mid-sixteenth century, both argued that the tragedy-with-comic-ending (tragedia de lieto fin) was most appropriate to modern times and produced his own examples of such plays. Even more important was Giovanni Battista Guarini. Guarini's Il Pastor Fido, published in 1590, provoked a fierce critical debate in which Guarini's spirited defense of generic innovation eventually carried the day. Guarini's tragicomedy offered modulated action that never drifted too far either to comedy or tragedy, mannered characters, and a pastoral setting. All three became staples of continental tragicomedy for a century and more. England In England, where practice ran ahead of theory, the situation was quite different. In the sixteenth century, \\"tragicomedy\\" meant the native sort of romantic play that violated the unities of time, place, and action, that glibly mixed high- and low-born characters, and that presented fantastic actions. These were the features Philip Sidney deplored in his complaint against the \\"mungrell Tragy-comedie\\" of the 1580s, and of which Shakespeare's Polonius offers famous testimony: \\"The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individuable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.\\" Some aspects of this romantic impulse remain even in the work of more sophisticated playwrights: Shakespeare's last plays, which may well be called tragicomedies, have often been called romances. By the early Stuart period, some English playwrights had absorbed the lessons of the Guarini controversy. John Fletcher's The Faithful Shepherdess, an adaptation of Guarini's play, was produced in 1608. In the printed edition, Fletcher offered an interesting definition of the term, worth quoting at length: \\"A tragi-comedie is not so called in respect of mirth and killing, but in respect it wants deaths, which is enough to make it no tragedy, yet brings some neere it, which is inough to make it no comedie.\\" Fletcher's definition focuses primarily on events: a play's genre is determined by whether or not people die in it, and in a secondary way on how close the action comes to a death. But, as Eugene Waith showed, the tragicomedy Fletcher developed in the next decade also had unifying stylistic features: sudden and unexpected revelations, outr√© plots, distant locales, and a persistent focus on elaborate, artificial rhetoric. Some of Fletcher's contemporaries, notably Philip Massinger and James Shirley, wrote successful and popular tragicomedies. Richard Brome also essayed the form, but with less success. And many of their contemporary writers, ranging from John Ford to Lodowick Carlell to Sir Aston Cockayne, made attempts in the genre. Tragicomedy remained fairly popular up to the closing of the theaters in 1642, and Fletcher's works were popular in the Restoration as well. The old styles were cast aside as tastes changed in the eighteenth century; the \\"tragedy with a happy ending\\" eventually developed into melodrama, in which form it still flourishes. Landgartha (1640) by Henry Burnell, the first play by an Irish playwright to be performed in an Irish theatre, was explicitly described by its author as a tragicomedy. Critical reaction to the play was universally hostile, partly it seems because the ending was neither happy nor unhappy. Burnell in his introduction to the printed edition of the play attacked his critics for their ignorance, pointing out that as they should know perfectly well, many plays are neither tragedy nor comedy, but \\"something between\\". Later developments The more subtle criticism that developed after the Renaissance stressed the thematic and formal aspects of tragicomedy, rather than plot. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing defined it as a mixture of emotions in which \\"seriousness stimulates laughter, and pain pleasure.\\" Even more commonly, tragicomedy's affinity with satire and \\"dark\\" comedy have suggested a tragicomic impulse in modern theatre with Luigi Pirandello who influenced Beckett. Also it can be seen in absurdist drama. Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt, the Swiss dramatist, suggested that tragicomedy was the inevitable genre for the twentieth century; he describes his play The Visit (1956) as a tragicomedy. Tragicomedy is a common genre in post-World War II British theatre, with authors as varied as Samuel Beckett, Tom Stoppard, John Arden, Alan Ayckbourn and Harold Pinter writing in this genre. Many writers of the metamodernist and postmodernist movements have made use of tragicomedy and/or gallows humor. A notable example of a metamodernist tragicomedy is David Foster Wallace's 1996 magnum opus, Infinite Jest.

The name was bestowed by Catholic missionaries of Alta California after native people introduced them to it. It was so abundant there that its name was also applied to the settler's town adjacent to Mission San Francisco de As√≠s as well as to the cove along San Francisco Bay upon which it was situated.

Eric XIV was the oldest son of Gustav I (1496‚Äì1560) and Catherine of Saxe-Lauenburg (1513‚Äì35). He was also ruler of Estonia, after its conquest by Sweden in 1561. While he has been regarded as intelligent and artistically skilled, as well as politically ambitious, early in his reign he showed signs of mental instability, a condition that eventually led to insanity. Some scholars claim that his illness began early during his reign, while others believe that it first manifested with the Sture murders. Eric, having been deposed and imprisoned, was most likely murdered. An examination of his remains in 1958 confirmed that he probably died of arsenic poisoning.Lars Ericson in Johan III, , p. 109 Early years Portrait sent to Queen Elizabeth I of England, to further the negotiations regarding the marriage. By Steven van der Meulen 1561 Eric XIV was born at Tre Kronor castle, at 9 o'clock on the morning of 13 December 1533. Before the age of two, he lost his mother. In 1536, his father, Gustav Vasa, married Margaret Leijonhufvud (1516‚Äì1551), a Swedish noblewoman. Eric's first teacher was the learned German Georg Norman, whose services were shortly thereafter needed elsewhere within the Swedish state. He was replaced by French Calvinist Dionysius Beurraeus (1500‚Äì67). Dionysius taught both Eric and his half-brother John, and seems to have been appreciated by both. Eric was very successful in foreign languages and mathematics. He was also an informed historian, a good writer and familiar with astrology. When Eric started to appear in public, he was referred to as \\"chosen king\\" () and after the meeting of parliament in Stockholm in 1560, he received the title of \\"hereditary king\\" (). In 1557, Eric was assigned the fiefdoms of Kalmar, Kronoberg and √ñland. He took up residence in the city of Kalmar. Against his father's wishes, Eric entered into marriage negotiations with the future Queen Elizabeth I of England and pursued her for several years. Tensions between Eric and his father grew. Eric also made unsuccessful marriage proposals to, among others, Mary, Queen of Scots (1542‚Äì87), Renata of Lorraine (1544‚Äì1602), Anna of Saxony (1544‚Äì77) and Christine of Hesse (1543‚Äì1604). Rule Eric's grave in V√§ster√•s Cathedral The news of his father's death reached Eric as he was on the point of embarking for England to press his suit for the hand of Queen Elizabeth. Back in Stockholm he summoned a Riksdag, which met at Arboga on 15 April 1561. There he adopted the royal propositions known as the \\"Arboga articles\\", considerably curtailing the authority of the royal dukes, John and Charles, in their respective provinces. He was crowned as Eric XIV, but was not necessarily the 14th king of Sweden named Eric. He and his brother Charles adopted regnal numbers according to Johannes Magnus's partly fictitious history of Sweden. There had, however, been at least six earlier Swedish kings with the name of Eric, as well as pretenders about whom very little is known.Almgren, H. L√∂wgren, A och Bergstr√∂m, B. (2007) Alla Tiders Historia Gleerups Utbildning AB page 117. From the start of his reign, Eric was in opposition to the Swedish nobility. He chose as a close adviser G√∂ran Persson (1530‚Äì68), who had narrowly escaped execution under Eric's father. Persson was also opposed to the nobility and a determined opponent of Eric's half-brother, later John III of Sweden (1537‚Äì92). John was the Duke of Finland and was married to a Polish princess, against Eric's wishes, which made him friendly with Poland. John pursued an expansionist policy in Livonia (now Estonia and Latvia), in breach of the Arboga articles, which led to contention between the brothers. In 1563, John was seized by an army sent to Finland, and tried for high treason by Eric's order. Unlike his father, who had been satisfied with ruling an independent state, Eric tried to expand his influence in the Baltic region and in Estonia, beginning the process that resulted in Sweden becoming a great power in the 17th century. This expansionism resulted in a clash with his cousin, Frederick II of Denmark (1534‚Äì88). Most of Eric XIV's reign was then dominated by the Livonian War and the Scandinavian Seven Years' War against Denmark (1563‚Äì70), during which he successfully repelled most Danish attempts at conquest, but was unable to keep his own acquisitions. From 1563 onwards, his insanity became pronounced; his rule became even more arbitrary and marked by violence. His suspicion of the nobility led him to suspicions of the Sture family, then headed by Svante Stensson Sture, who was married to Gustav's sister-in-law. He first acted against the family in 1566, accusing Svante's son Nils of treason, but commuted the sentence and instead sent Nils to Lorraine, supposedly to arrange a marriage with the princess Renata. However, Eric had determined to marry his mistress Karin M√•nsdotter and in 1567, on Nils's return and suspicious of high treason, he killed several members of the family in the so- called Sture Murders, Eric himself stabbing Nils Svantesson Sture. The King probably thought of the killing as an execution rather than murder.Dahlstr√∂m, G och Swahn, J-√ñ (red). (1984) Bra B√∂ckers Lexikon Bra B√∂cker AB. Book nr 7-page 76 Downfall After the Sture homicides, John was imprisoned and Eric's conflict with the nobility came to its climax. Early in 1568 Eric seemed to recover his reason, and attempted to reconcile with John on the condition that the latter recognized Eric's marriage with Karin M√•nsdotter. This marriage was solemnized in July, Karin crowned Queen, and their infant son Gustav pronounced Prince-royal. However, in the fall of 1568, asserting Eric's insanity, the dukes and the nobles rebelled, and after some resistance Eric was imprisoned by his brother Duke John, who took power on 30 September. J√∂ran Persson was assigned much of the blame for the actions directed against the nobility during Eric XIV's reign and was executed shortly after John III had incarcerated Eric, who was legally dethroned in January 1569 by the Riksdag.Ingvar Andersson in Erik XIV Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand 1979 pp. 263 & 265 Imprisonment and death For the next seven years the ex-king was a source of anxiety to the new government. Three rebellions - the 1569 Plot, the Mornay Plot and the 1576 Plot - with the object of releasing and reinstating him, had to be suppressed, and Eric was held as a prisoner in many different castles in both Sweden and Finland. He died in prison in √ñrbyhus Castle. According to a tradition starting with Johannes Messenius, his final meal was a poisoned bowl of pea soup. A document signed by his brother, John III of Sweden, and a nobleman, Bengt Bengtsson Gylta (1514‚Äì74), gave Eric's guards in his last prison authorization to poison him if anyone tried to release him. His body was later exhumed and modern forensic analysis revealed evidence of lethal arsenic poisoning.

When Messer took over, the museum's ability to present art at all was still in doubt due to the challenges presented by continuous spiral ramp gallery that is both tilted and has curved walls. Almost immediately, in 1962, he took a risk putting on a large exhibition that combined the Guggenheim's paintings with sculptures on loan from the Hirshhorn Museum. Three-dimensional sculpture, in particular, raised \\"the problem of installing such a show in a museum bearing so close a resemblance to the circular geography of hell\\", where any vertical object appears tilted in a \\"drunken lurch\\" because the slope of the floor and the curvature of the walls could combine to produce vexing optical illusions. It turned out that the combination could work well in the Guggenheim's space, but, Messer recalled that at the time, \\"I was scared. I half felt that this would be my last exhibition.\\" Messer had the foresight to prepare by staging a smaller sculpture exhibition the previous year, in which he discovered how to compensate for the space's weird geometry by constructing special plinths at a particular angle, so the pieces were not at a true vertical yet appeared to be so. In the earlier sculpture show, this trick proved impossible for one piece, an Alexander Calder mobile whose wire inevitably hung at a true plumb vertical, \\"suggesting hallucination\\" in the disorienting context of the tilted floor.

Guggenheim Museum, in New York City, testifies not only to Wright's architectural genius, but also to the adventurous spirit that characterized its founders.Levine, p. 362 The critic Paul Goldberger later wrote that, before Wright's modernist building, \\"there were only two common models for museum design: Beaux-arts Palace ... and the International Style Pavilion.\\"\\"The Secret Life of Buildings: New York Public Library and Guggenheim Museum\\", Colebrook Bosson Saunders Products Ltd..

In this sense almost every museum of our time is a child of the Guggenheim.\\" =New York= An interior view of the museum Before settling on the present site for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum on Fifth Avenue between 88th and 89th Streets, Wright, Rebay and Guggenheim considered numerous locations in Manhattan, as well as in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, overlooking the Hudson River.Ballon, pp. 22‚Äì27 Guggenheim felt that the site's proximity to Central Park was important; the park afforded relief from the noise, congestion and concrete of the city.Storrer, pp. 400‚Äì01 Nature also provided the museum with inspiration. The building embodies Wright's attempts \\"to render the inherent plasticity of organic forms in architecture.\\"Levine, p. 340 The Guggenheim was to be the only museum designed by Wright. The city location required Wright to design the building in a vertical rather than a horizontal form, far different from his earlier, rural works. Wright's original concept was called an inverted \\"ziggurat\\", because it resembled the steep steps on the ziggurats built in ancient Mesopotamia. His design dispensed with the conventional approach to museum layout, in which visitors are led through a series of interconnected rooms and forced to retrace their steps when exiting. Wright's plan was for the museum guests to ride to the top of the building by elevator, to descend at a leisurely pace along the gentle slope of the continuous ramp, and to view the atrium of the building as the last work of art. The open rotunda afforded viewers the unique possibility of seeing several bays of work on different levels simultaneously and even to interact with guests on other levels.Perez, Adelyn. \\"AD Classics: Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum\\", May 18, 2010. Retrieved March 21, 2012 The spiral design recalled a nautilus shell, with continuous spaces flowing freely one into another.Levine, p. 301 Even as it embraced nature, Wright's design also expresses his take on modernist architecture's rigid geometry. Wright ascribed a symbolic meaning to the building's shapes. He explained, \\"these geometric forms suggest certain human ideas, moods, sentiments ‚Äì as for instance: the circle, infinity; the triangle, structural unity; the spiral, organic progress; the square, integrity.\\"Rudenstine, Angelica Zander.

Circularity is the leitmotif, from the rotunda to the inlaid design of the terrazzo floors. The Guggenheim atrium, looking up at the skylight Wright's vision took 16 years to be fulfilled. Set in sharp contrast to typically rectangular Manhattan buildings that surround it, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum building opened in October 1959. Even before it opened, the design polarized architecture critics.

The building, nevertheless, became widely praised\\"The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum\\", The Art Story Foundation. Retrieved on March 21, 2012 and inspired many other architects. The building's surface was made out of concrete to reduce the cost, inferior to the stone finish that Wright had wanted.Sennott, pp. 572‚Äì73 The small rotunda (or \\"Monitor building\\", as Wright called it) next to the large rotunda was intended to house apartments for Rebay and Guggenheim but instead became offices and storage space.Levine, p. 317 In 1965, the second floor of the Monitor building was renovated to display the museum's growing permanent collection, and with the restoration of the museum in 1990‚Äì92, it was turned over entirely to exhibition space and christened the Thannhauser Building, in honor of one of the most important bequests to the museum.Ballon, pp. 59‚Äì61 Wright's original plan for an adjoining tower, artists' studios and apartments went unrealized, largely for financial reasons. However, as part of the restoration, architects Gwathmey Siegel and Associates analyzed Wright's original sketches to design the rectangular 10-story limestone tower, that stands behind, and taller than, the original spiral building (replacing a much smaller structure), which has four additional exhibition galleries with flat walls that are \\"more appropriate for the display of art.\\" Also in the original construction, the main gallery skylight had been covered, which compromised Wight's carefully articulated lighting effects. This changed in 1992 when the skylight was restored to its original design. Funding for the alterations was raised partly through the controversial sale of masterworks by the foundation in 1991. In 2001, the museum opened the Sackler Center for Arts Education to the public, which was another part of Wright's original design for the building, through a gift of the Mortimer D. Sackler family.

History In 1973, the company was founded as an unprofitable collection of Texas oil wells for investors seeking tax write-offs. In 1986, the company acquired Spectrum 7 for 200,000 shares from George W. Bush. After the sale of his company, Bush served on the board of directors of the company and received $80,000-$100,000 per year in consulting fees. Bush remained on the board through 1993. In 1987, Talat Othman joined the board of the company and served as the chair of the Audit Committee. In 1989, the company's subsidiary Aloha Petroleum was sold to company insiders for $12 million, most of which was borrowed from Harken. The sale of the subsidiary for an exorbitant price helped the company show a profit that year and disguise losses, a similar technique used by Enron that led to the Enron scandal. In September 1989, the company made an offer to acquire Tesoro Petroleum. The offer was withdrawn in February 1990. In 2007, the company changed its name to HKN, Inc. Controversies =Insider trading allegations= Harken attracted attention because of the role played in its affairs during the 1980s by George W. Bush, later the President of the United States. On June 22, 1990, while he was a member of the company's board of directors, Bush sold stock in Harken shortly before the company announced substantial losses. This transaction resulted in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of probable insider trading. A transaction associated with the financial endowment of Harvard University was also investigated. =Exploration offshore Costa Rica= In 2000, a subsidiary of the company received a 20-year concession to exploit resources offshore Costa Rica. After pressure from indigenous tribes and environmentalists, operating as Acci√≥n de Lucha Anti-Petrola, the government instituted a moratorium on exploration. In September 2003, the company filed a dispute seeking $57 billion from the government of Costa Rica for lost earnings. The lawsuit was thrown out of court and the concession was revoked.

John III (, ; 20 December 1537 ‚Äì 17 November 1592) was King of Sweden from 1569 until his death. He was the son of King Gustav I of Sweden and his second wife Margaret Leijonhufvud. He was also, quite autonomously, the ruler of Finland, as Duke John from 1556 to 1563. In 1581 he assumed also the title Grand Prince of Finland. He attained the Swedish throne after a rebellion against his half-brother Eric XIV. He is mainly remembered for his attempts to close the gap between the newly established Lutheran Church of Sweden and the Catholic church. His first wife was Catherine Jagellonica of the Polish-Lithuanian ruling family, and their son Sigismund eventually ascended both the Polish-Lithuanian and Swedish thrones. Biography He was the second son of Gustav Vasa (1523‚Äì60). His mother was Margaret Leijonhufvud (1514‚Äì51), a Swedish noblewoman. As a Duke of Finland, he opposed his half-brother Eric XIV of Sweden (1560‚Äì68) and was imprisoned in 1563. After his release from prison, probably because of his brother's insanity (see Sture Murders), John again joined the opposition, deposed Eric and made himself the king. His important ally was his maternal uncle Sten Leijonhufvud, who at deathbed was made Count of Raseborg. Shortly after this John executed his brother's most trusted counsellor, J√∂ran Persson, whom he held largely responsible for his harsh treatment while in prison. John further initiated peace talks with Denmark and L√ºbeck to end the Scandinavian Seven Years' War, but rejected the resulting Treaties of Roskilde (1568) where his envoys had accepted far-reaching Danish demands. After two more years of fighting, this war was concluded without many Swedish concessions in the Treaty of Stettin (1570). During the following years he successfully fought Russia in the Livonian War, concluded by the Treaty of Plussa in 1583, a war that meant a Swedish reconquest of Narva. As a whole his foreign policy was affected by his connection to Poland of which country his son Sigismund III Vasa was made king in 1587. In domestic politics John showed clear Catholic sympathies, inspired by his Polish wife, a fact that created frictions to the Swedish clergy and nobility. He sought to enlist the help of the papacy in gaining release of his wife's family assets, which were frozen in Naples. He also allowed Jesuits to secretly staff the Royal Theological College in Stockholm. However, John himself was a learned follower of the mediating theologian George Cassander. He sought reconciliation between Rome and Wittenberg on the basis of the consensus of the first five centuries of Christianity. John approved the publication of the Lutheran Swedish Church Order of Archbishop Laurentius Petri in 1571 but also got the church to approve an addendum to the church order in 1575, Nova ordinantia ecclesiastica that displayed a return to patristic sources. This set the stage for his promulgation of the Swedish-Latin Red Book, which reintroduced several Catholic customs and resulted in the Liturgical Struggle, which was not to end for twenty years. In 1575, he gave his permission for the remaining Catholic convents in Sweden to start receiving novices again. From time to time he was also at odds theologically with his younger brother Duke Charles of Sudermannia (afterwards Charles IX of Sweden), who had Calvinist sympathies, and did not promote King John's Liturgy in his duchy. John III was an eager patron of art and architecture. =John III as king= In January 1569, John was recognized as king by the same riksdag that forced Eric XIV off the throne. But this recognition was not without influence from John; Duke Karl received confirmation on his dukedom without the restrictions on his power that the Arboga articles imposed. The nobilities' power and rights were extended and their responsibilities lessened. John was still concerned about his position as king as long as Eric was alive. During the imprisonment of Eric, three major conspiraces were made to depose John: the 1569 Plot, the Mornay Plot and the 1576 Plot.Karin Tegenborg Falkdalen (2010). Vasad√∂ttrarna (2). Falun: Historiska Media. Nordisk familjebok / Uggleupplagan. 7. Egyptologi - Feinschmecker. p. 787-788 The fear of a possible liberation of the imprisoned king worried him to the point that in 1571 he ordered the guards to murder the captured king if there were any suspicion of an attempt to liberate him. It is possible that this is how Eric died in 1577. John III claimed that he had liberated Sweden from the \\"tyrant\\" Eric XIV, just as his father had claimed that he had liberated Sweden from the \\"bloodhound\\" Christian II. John was violent, hot tempered and greatly suspicious. Family Catherine Jagellonica Gunilla Bielke John married his first wife, Catherine Jagellonica of Poland (1526‚Äì83), of the House of Jagiello, in Vilnius on 4 October 1562. In Sweden, she is known as Katarina Jagellonica. She was the sister of king Sigismund II Augustus of Poland. Their children were: * Isabella (1564‚Äì1566) * Sigismund (1566‚Äì1632), King of Poland (1587‚Äì1632), King of Sweden (1592‚Äì99), and Grand Duke of Finland and Lithuania * Anna (1568‚Äì1625) He married his second wife, Gunilla Bielke (1568‚Äì1592), on 21 February 1585; they had a son: Tomb of John III in Uppsala Cathedral. * John (1589‚Äì1618), firstly Duke of Finland, then from 1608 Duke of Ostrogothia. The young duke married his first cousin Maria Elisabet (1596‚Äì1618), daughter of Charles IX of Sweden (reigned 1599‚Äì1611) With his mistress Karin Hansdotter (1532‚Äì1596) he had at least four illegitimate children: * Sofia Gyllenhielm (1556‚Äì1583), who married Pontus De la Gardie * Augustus Gyllenhielm (1557‚Äì1560) * Julius Gyllenhielm (1559‚Äì1581) * Lucretia Gyllenhielm (1560‚Äì1585) John cared for Karin and their children even after he married Catherine Jagellonica, in 1562. He got Karin a husband who would care for her and the children: in 1561, she married nobleman Klas Andersson (V√§stg√∂te), a friend and servant of John. They had a daughter named Brita. He continued supporting Karin and his illegitimate children as king, from 1568. In 1572 Karin married again, as her first husband was executed for treason by Eric XIV in 1563, to a Lars Henrikson, whom John ennobled in 1576 to care for his issue with Karin. The same year, he made his daughter Sofia a lady in the castle, as a servant to his sister Princess Elizabeth of Sweden. In 1580, John married her to Pontus de la Gardie. She later died giving birth to Jacob De la Gardie. Ancestry See also * History of Sweden (1523‚Äì1611).

These transactions are alleged to involve either issues relating to insider trading, or influence peddling. No wrongdoings were found by any investigating authorities although the matter generated political controversy. Spectrum 7 purchase George W. Bush ran an energy company called Spectrum 7 during the 1980s. In the mid-1980s the oil market was in a slump, with prices dropping daily. The firm was in serious financial trouble until another company, a distressed oil properties specialist, Harken Energy, purchased Spectrum 7 in 1986. Part of the attraction for Harken's management to purchase Spectrum 7 was having Bush on its team ‚Äî his father was then vice-president, he had extensive \\"connections\\" and knowledge of the oil and gas business. Harken Energy offered Bush a seat on its board of directors along with stock worth about $500,000 at the time. Bush received a consulting contract worth between $80,000 and $120,000 annually as well. The Job In 1987 and 1988, George W. Bush dedicated himself (and much of his efforts) to the presidential campaign of his father George H.W. Bush. Fortunes turned for Bush, and the following year he invested in the Texas Rangers baseball team. To help pay for this investment, he borrowed a sum of $600,000; to pay off the loan, he sold his stock in Harken Energy. That investment paid off handsomely for him, not only monetarily. As team owner, the popularity derived from his public persona lead to the invitation to run for governor of Texas and ultimately, two terms as president. Bush's stock sale George W. Bush sold 212,140 shares of Harken Energy at $4 a share on June 22, 1990, for a grand total of $848,560. Two months later, on August 20, Harken announced a larger than expected loss for the previous quarter. Surprisingly, the price of the company's stock shares barely declined at first, following these two negative, or \\"bearish,\\" events. In the ensuing months, Harken's stock price did drift downward to $1.25 per share by the end of the year. However, the stock price then recovered its value and more the following year, which was strange behavior for the stock. The sale of the large block of shares had become widely publicized and allegations of the use of insider information, and improper stock transactions, were leveled at Bush. =SEC investigation= The SEC's exhaustive investigation examined thousands of pages of documents. Additionally, and in an unusual move, Bush waived client-attorney privileges so the attorneys could be questioned, in order to leave no remaining doubts on the subject. Regarding whether Bush knew in advance about the losses, the SEC investigators found: \\"The evidence establishes that George W. Bush was not aware of the majority of the items that comprised the loss Harken announced on August 20.\\" The SEC investigators concluded that the loss resulted from write- downs and expenses that occurred after he sold his stock. Basically an outsider, Bush did not usually receive the Executive Committee's Weekly Flash Reports on the company's financial condition. In short, concluded an SEC investigative memo, George W. Bush was not particularly informed about the company's finances. Regarding whether the stock was sold deliberately in time to avoid losing money before bad news was made public, the SEC found that Bush did not initiate the sale, but was contacted by a stockbroker who offered to buy a large block of Harken stock. There was evidence that before selling the stock, company board member Bush checked with inside and outside company executives, fellow directors and legal experts concerning the sale of his stock. The SEC report read, \\"In light of the facts uncovered, it would be difficult to establish that, even assuming Bush possessed material nonpublic information, he acted with sentience or intent to defraud.\\" Whether the news of Harken's unexpectedly large loss hurt the company's investors unfairly was quickly discarded after the SEC examined Harken Energy's share price just before and just after news of the loss was made public. Though the price dropped about 20% that day, the move downward was not immediate, and the price rebounded to $3 the following day. If indeed the announcement had caused a loss of confidence in the company, SEC investigators reasoned, the stock would most likely have fallen immediately and stayed down. \\"The conclusion of the Office of Economic Analysis is that, because the price of Harken did not immediately react to the earnings announcement and there is no news that explains Harken's return to its pre-announcement price of $3 on August 21, 1990, the earnings announcement did not provide investors with new material information,\\" the SEC wrote. Moreover, the stock rebounded the next year and hit $8 a share. Formal troubles There are also questions about when federal regulators were informed of the sale, and whether Bush tried to hide this information. Newspapers (and internet pundits) have alleged that though the law requires prompt disclosure of insider sales, Bush neglected to inform the SEC about his transaction until 34 weeks had passed. Even though he had broken the law, no charges were filed. Many have linked this to his father's position as president. The reality of the matter is somewhat different. Although these articles usually do not mention it, only one of the two disclosure forms Bush was required to file with the SEC was delayed in its filing. The \\"Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities\\" Form 144, was filed on the day of the sale, June 22, 1990, thereby clearing Bush of the intent to hide or not disclose. Bush filed the second form, Form 4, the following year, in 1991, due to \\"a mix up with the attorneys\\". Because the stock sale information had indeed been disclosed, and duly filed in a timely manner via Form 144, the tardy filing of Form 4 was not viewed as a serious or punishable offense. It appears that the late filing of Form 4 was not considered serious by the SEC at the time. Conclusion Bush was cleared of any wrongdoing. The Center for Public Integrity said of this episode - \\"The documents from the SEC inquiry show that Harken Energy engaged in questionable accounting practices as they attempted to stave off a financial crisis in 1989 and 1990. They also show that [George W.] Bush was unaware of much of what was going on in the company. Ultimately, the SEC required the company to correct its financial reports, but concluded there was insufficient evidence to pursue an insider trading case against Bush.\\" References Further reading =SEC documents= * Janick, Herb; Gerlach, Paul; Adelman, Jim. \\"In the Matter of trading in the Securities of Harken Energy Corp., HO-2518\\" August 21, 1991 Internal SEC Memorandum * The Division of Enforcement. \\"In the Matter of Trading in the Securities of Harken Energy Corp., File No. HO-2518 - SEC Action Memorandum, March 18, 1992 =News reports and analysis= * External links *SEC *White House Statement on Harken stock transaction *A complete Compendium of Documents *GuardianUK report *Washington Post report *The National Review Online Category:Corporate scandals Category:Scandals in the United States Category:1990 in the United States Category:George W.

It was founded in 1979 by Baptist minister Jerry Falwell Sr. and associates, and dissolved in the late 1980s. It played a key role in the mobilization of conservative Christians as a political force and particularly in Republican presidential victories throughout the 1980s. Oxford Dictionaries defines the term as a \\"right-wing movement in the US formed in the 1970s.\\" History =Before establishment= The origins of the Moral Majority can be traced to 1976 when Baptist minister Jerry Falwell Sr. embarked on a series of \\"I Love America\\" rallies across the country to raise awareness of social issues important to him.Liebman, Robert and Robert Wuthnow (1983) The New Christian Right, p. 58. New York: Aldine Publishing Company. These rallies were an extension of Falwell's decision to go against the traditional Baptist principle of separating religion and politics, a change of heart Falwell says he had when he perceived what he described as the decay of the nation's morality.Allitt, Patrick (2003). Religion in America Since 1945: A History, p. 152. New York: Columbia University Press. Through hosting these rallies, Falwell was able to gauge national support for a formal organization and also raise his profile as a leader. Having already been a part of a well- established network of ministers and ministries, within a few years Falwell was favorably positioned to launch the Moral Majority. The impetus for the Moral Majority was the struggle for control of an American conservative Christian advocacy group known as Christian Voice during 1978. Robert Grant, Christian Voice's acting President, said in a news conference that the religious right was a \\"sham... controlled by three Catholics and a Jew.\\" Following this, Paul Weyrich, Terry Dolan, Richard Viguerie (the Catholics) and Howard Phillips (the Jew) left Christian Voice. During a 1979 meeting, they urged televangelist Jerry Falwell Sr. to found Moral Majority (a phrase coined by WeyrichLernoux, Penny. \\"A Reverence for Fundamentalism,\\" The Nation, vol. 248, Issue #0015, 17 April 1989). This was the period when the New Christian Right arose. Joining Falwell in the Moral Majority was Ed McAteer, who the same year, founded the Religious Roundtable in Memphis, Tennessee. =Establishment and organizational activity= Falwell and Weyrich founded the Moral Majority in June 1979. According to former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who was Texas evangelist James Robison's communications director at the time, Robison's \\"Freedom Rally\\" at the Dallas Convention Center was the genesis of the Moral Majority. The Moral Majority was predominately a Southern-oriented organization of the Christian Right, although its state chapters and political activity extended beyond the South. The number of state chapters grew quickly, with organizations in eighteen states by 1980.Liebman, Robert and Robert Wuthnow (1983) The New Christian Right, pp. 31‚Äì32. New York: Aldine Publishing Company. The variety of resources available to the Moral Majority at its founding facilitated this rapid expansion, and included Falwell's mailing list from his program, Old Time Gospel Hour. In addition, the Moral Majority took control of the Old Time Gospel Hour's publication, Journal Champion, which had been distributed to the show's donors.Liebman, Robert and Robert Wuthnow (1983) The New Christian Right, p. 61. New York: Aldine Publishing Company. Through the 1980s, Falwell was the organization's best-known spokesperson. By 1982, Moral Majority surpassed Christian Voice in size and influence. The Moral Majority's headquarters were in Lynchburg, Virginia, where Falwell was the presiding minister of the nation's largest independent Baptist church, Thomas Road Baptist Church. Virginia has been a seat of Christian Right politics, being the state where the Christian Coalition's first headquarters were established. Falwell was at the head of the Moral Majority and maintained an advisory board, constituting the organization's primary leadership. This leadership was drawn mostly from Falwell's fellow members of the Baptist Bible Fellowship. Falwell insisted the Moral Majority leadership also include Catholics and Jews, although not all members of the leadership approved of this inclusion.Allitt, Patrick (2003). Religion in America Since 1945: A History, p. 153. New York: Columbia University Press. The Moral Majority was an organization made up of conservative Christian political action committees which campaigned on issues its personnel believed were important to maintaining its Christian conception of moral law. They believed this represented the opinions of the majority of Americans (hence the movement's name). With a membership of millions, the Moral Majority became one of the largest conservative lobby groups in the United States and at its height, it claimed more than four million members and over two million donors.Wilcox, Clyde (1996). Onward Christian Soldiers?, p. 96. Boulder: Westview Press. These members were spread among about twenty state organizations, of which Washington State's was the largest. The Moral Majority was incorporated into the Liberty Federation in 1985, remaining a distinct entity but falling under the Liberty Federation's larger jurisdiction. By 1987, Falwell retired as the formal head of the Moral Majority, and was succeeded by Jerry Nims, although he maintained an active and visible role within the organization. =Dissolution= By the end of Ronald Reagan's presidential administration, Christian Right organizations were generally in a phase of decline. After Reagan's two terms in office, donations were decreasing, because after eight years of Christian Right- supported leadership, the nation was no longer in the same state of supposed moral peril as it was when Reagan first took office.Wilcox, Clyde (1996). Onward Christian Soldiers?, p. 38. Boulder: Westview Press. The Moral Majority's financial base seriously eroded by the time it became part of the Liberty Federation; its financial difficulties ultimately were a major factor in the decision to disband the organization.Wilcox, Clyde (1992). God's Warriors, p. 14. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. Falwell offered an optimistic public opinion about the Moral Majority's dissolution. Disbanding the Moral Majority in 1989 in Las Vegas, Falwell declared, \\"Our goal has been achieved‚Ä¶The religious right is solidly in place and ‚Ä¶ religious conservatives in America are now in for the duration.\\"Allitt, Patrick (2003). Religion in America Since 1945: A History, p. 198. New York: Columbia University Press. Organizational goals and composition The Moral Majority sought to mobilize conservative Americans to become politically active on issues they thought were important. A variety of tactics were used to garner support. These tactics included direct-mail campaigns, telephone hotlines, rallies, and religious television broadcasts.Robert Wuthnow (1988). The Restructuring of American Religion, p. 205. Princeton: Princeton University Press. Although the Moral Majority operated for only a decade, it rapidly became a visible political force and was relatively effective in its mobilization goals. According to Robert Liebman and Robert Wuthnow, common explanations for this success include:Liebman, Robert and Robert Wuthnow (1983) The New Christian Right, p. 55‚Äì57. New York: Aldine Publishing Company. * The Moral Majority was founded with strong financial backing already in place. * Its leaders frequently communicated with its constituents, enabling consistent messages to resonate throughout all levels. * Its leaders generally had previous organizational and management experience. * The general public was amenable to the issues the Moral Majority emphasized. Some issues for which the Moral Majority campaigned included: * Promotion of a traditional family values * Opposition to media outlets accused of promoting an anti- family agenda * Opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment and Strategic Arms Limitation Talks * Opposition to state recognition or acceptance of homosexual acts * Prohibition of abortion, including in cases involving incest or rapeFalwell: An Autobiography, The Inside Story, Liberty House Publishers, Lynchburg, 1997, p. 395. * Support for Christian prayers in schools * Proselytising to Jews and other non-Christians for conversion to Christianity =Social agenda= Moral Majority successfully campaigned to create an integrated social platform that appealed to most conservative Christians by packaging a variety of previously disparate issues under the banner of \\"traditional family values‚Äù.Fetner, Tina. How the Religious Right Shaped Lesbian and Gay Activism, p. 58. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. . Moral Majority portrayed issues such as abortion, divorce, feminism, gay and lesbian rights, and the Equal Rights Amendment as attacks on the traditional concept and values of American families and tapped into a sense of societal moral decay that resonated with many evangelicals. They also campaigned for the inclusion of prayer in schools and tax incentives for married couples as protection for the traditional family structure. Under this pro-family agenda, they mobilized a large base of supporters with issue-centric dialogue that they proliferated in their network of preachers and mailings. Gay rights issues In particular, their anti-homosexual rhetoric that they publicized through fund-raising letters and Christian broadcasting had higher contribution rates than other topics. While not explicitly anti-gay in their public platforms during the 1970s, their internal mobilization as ‚Äúshared anti-gay sentiment aided in solidifying a collective set of grievances and ideologies, in establishing a collective identity of constituents, and in constructing a hostile enemy against which the conservative Christian activists were to fightFetner, Tina. How the Religious Right Shaped Lesbian and Gay Activism, p. 60. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. .‚Äù. The Moral Majority refrained from directly speaking out against gays, feminists, and pro-abortion parties and instead used ‚Äúpro-family‚Äù rhetoric to articulate their point. For example, instead of coming out directly against homosexuality and gay families, leaders of the Moral Majority defined a family as ‚Äútwo heterosexual parents‚Äù which appealed to many conservatives. Later, as the organization gained more influence in the 1980s, their rhetoric became more explicit in their stance on gay rights as they characterized the movement as an attack on the American family. Jerry Falwell Sr. expressed that because gay people were rejected by most of society, they had no choice but to prey on the young and were therefore a threat to children and families. Various Moral Majority members also expressed more extreme opinions, such as Moral Majority commentator Charlie Judd, who argued that ‚ÄúThere are absolutes in this world. Just as jumping off a building will kill a person, so will the spread of homosexuality bring about the demise of American culture as we know it\\". Organizational structure The Moral Majority comprised four distinct organizations:Liebman, Robert and Robert Wuthnow (1983) The New Christian Right, p. 54. New York: Aldine Publishing Company. * Moral Majority Inc. ‚Äì the organization's lobbying division, which addressed issues on local, state, and national levels. * Moral Majority Foundation ‚Äì the organization's educational component, through which the Moral Majority educated ministers and lay people on political issues and conducted voter registration drives. * Moral Majority Legal Defense Fund ‚Äì the organization's legal instrument, used primarily to challenge the American Civil Liberties Union and secular humanist issues in court. * Moral Majority Political Action Committee ‚Äì the organization's mechanism for supporting the candidacy of people whose political platforms reflected Moral Majority values. The state chapters of the Moral Majority were financially independent from the national organization and relied on local resources to conduct their activities. Consequently, the national organization encouraged local chapters to cooperate with their policies but had little control over local chapters' activities.Liebman, Robert and Robert Wuthnow (1983) The New Christian Right, p. 70. New York: Aldine Publishing Company. Political activity of the Moral Majority divided accordingly, with the national Moral Majority office usually focused on addressing multiple issues through Congress while local branches tended to work on a single issue within their respective states.Liebman, Robert and Robert Wuthnow (1983) The New Christian Right, p. 71. New York: Aldine Publishing Company. Political involvement The Moral Majority engaged in political activity in a variety of ways, including national media campaigns and grassroots organization aimed at supporting particular candidates in elections and using mail and phone calls to reach office-holders.Wilcox, Clyde (1996). Onward Christian Soldiers?, p. 86. Boulder: Westview Press. The Moral Majority's initial political actions were aimed at supporting Jesse Helms' proposed legislation on school prayer.Liebman, Robert and Robert Wuthnow (1983) The New Christian Right, p. 34. New York: Aldine Publishing Company. Before long, the Moral Majority became heavily invested in presidential elections and national politics; although at the state level branches of the Moral Majority continued to pursue specific issues at lower levels of government. As far as elections, state Moral Majority chapters tended to deliberately focus their efforts towards particular candidates. For example, state chapters participated in campaigns to oust liberal members of Congress during the 1980 election. Also, in 1981, the Moral Majority mobilized delegates to the Virginia Republican state nominating convention in order to support Guy Farley, an evangelical candidate for lieutenant governor.Rozell, Mark J. and Clyde Wilcox (2003). \\"Virginia: Birthplace of the Christian Right,\\" The Christian Right in American Politics, ed. John C. Green, et al., p. 43. Washington, D.C.: Georgetown University Press. Nationally, the Moral Majority encouraged electoral participation among its members and used registration drives to register church-goers to vote, with the logic that Moral Majority members would be likely to vote for Moral Majority-endorsed candidates, thus strengthening the organization's electoral efficacy and strengthening its endorsements. Leaders within the Moral Majority asked ministers give their congregants political direction, reminding congregants when to vote, whom to vote for, and why the Moral Majority held particular positions on issues.Liebman, Robert and Robert Wuthnow (1983) The New Christian Right, p. 37. New York: Aldine Publishing Company. The Moral Majority, however, is probably best known for its involvement in presidential elections, specifically those of Ronald Reagan. =Presidential elections= The 1976 election of Jimmy Carter as President of the United States marked a milestone for evangelical Christians. For the first time, a self-professed evangelical Christian had been elected to the nation's highest office, bringing the national awareness of evangelical Christianity to a new level. Despite commonality in religious identification, however, evangelical Christians in general and eventually the newly formed Moral Majority in particular came to be disappointed with Carter's policies. Carter did not share the Moral Majority's political imperative to unify personal and political positions and would instead support the positions of his own party, the Democratic Party. In particular, Carter did not actively oppose his party's general pro-choice platform on abortion, nor did Carter work to bridge the church-state divide, both factors in the Moral Majority's decision to support Ronald Reagan's candidacy in 1980. 1980 The Moral Majority was a relatively early supporter of Reagan, endorsing him before the Republican convention.Liebman, Robert and Robert Wuthnow (1983) The New Christian Right, p. 36. New York: Aldine Publishing Company. According to Jimmy Carter, \\"that autumn [1980] a group headed by Jerry Falwell purchased $10 million in commercials on southern radio and TV to brand me as a traitor to the South and no longer a Christian.\\" Naturally, the Moral Majority continued working on behalf of Reagan after he gained the Republican nomination. Following the organization's lead, more than one-fifth of Moral Majority supporters that had supported Carter in 1976 voted for Reagan in 1980.Wilcox, Clyde (1992). God's Warriors, p. 117. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. After Reagan's victory, Falwell attributed Reagan's success directly to the Moral Majority and others registering and encouraging church-goers to vote who had never before been politically active.Wilcox, Clyde (1992). God's Warriors, p. 96. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. Empirical evidence suggests that Falwell's claim about the role of Christian Right organizations in Reagan's victory has some truth, though difficult to determine definitively.Wilcox, Clyde (1992). God's Warriors, pp. 115-17. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. Reagan sought input from the Moral Majority leadership during his campaign and appointed the Rev. Robert Billings, the Moral Majority's first executive director, to be a religious advisor to the campaign.Liebman, Robert and Robert Wuthnow (1983) The New Christian Right, p. 60. New York: Aldine Publishing Company. Later, Reagan appointed Billings to a position in the Department of Education. This appointment was particularly significant for the Moral Majority, which had lobbied on education policy issues, especially those regarding private schools.Wald, Kenneth (1997). Religion and Politics in the United States, p. 137. Washington, D.C.: Congressional Quarterly Press. 1984 The Moral Majority maintained their support for Reagan's 1984 reelection campaign and, alongside other Christian Right organizations, influenced the Republican platform for the election, shaping the party's campaign stances on school prayer and abortion. The nation's political climate, however, had changed since Reagan's first campaign. Although Reagan won reelection, the role of the Moral Majority in the victory had changed since 1980. A study of voters in the 1984 election showed that more anti-Moral Majority voters voted for Walter Mondale than pro-Moral Majority voters voted for Reagan, suggesting the Moral Majority may have actually had a negative effect on Reagan's campaign. 1988 1988 was the last presidential election for which the Moral Majority was an active organization. With Reagan having reached his two-term limit, the Republican nomination was open to a variety of primary contenders. The evangelical minister and televangelist Pat Robertson sought the Republican nomination and would have been, at first glance, a natural choice for the Moral Majority's support. Although Robertson's political platforms were extremely similar to the ones the Moral Majority supported, Falwell gave his organization's endorsement to contender George H. W. Bush instead. Falwell's decision highlighted the rivalry between Falwell and Robertson as televangelists but also revealed the deep-seated tension that still persisted between competing evangelical traditions ‚Äì Falwell's fundamentalist tradition was at odds with Robertson's charismatic tradition.Wilcox, Clyde (1992). God's Warriors, p. xv. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. Challenges to the Moral Majority By 1987‚Äì88, the views of the Moral Majority were challenged widely and the organization started to crumble. With its waning support, critics said \\"The Moral Majority is neither\\", meaning the organization was neither moral nor a majority. By 1988, there were serious cash flow problems and Falwell dismantled the organization in 1989.Utter, G., True, J.: Conservative Christians and Political Participation ‚Äì A Reference Handbook.. ABC Clio, Santa Barbara, California, 2004. p. 68. During its existence the Moral Majority experienced friction with other evangelical leaders and organizations as well as liberal leaders and organizations. For example, Bob Jones particularly sought to challenge the public position of the Moral Majority and was known to make public statements that the Moral Majority was an instrument of Satan. Such rivalries affected the Moral Majority's grassroots efforts. In South Carolina, the Moral Majority had no presence because Bob Jones University's religious network had already organized the state's independent Baptists.Vinson, C. Danielle and James L. Guth (2003). \\"Advance and Retreat in the Palmetto State: Assessing the Christian Right in South Carolina,\\" The Christian Right in American Politics, ed. John C. Green, et al., p. 23. Washington, D.C.: Georgetown University Press. The tension between Falwell and Pat Robertson also affected the Moral Majority, as noted in the presidential elections section of this article. On the ideologically opposed side, Norman Lear's liberal organization People for the American Way was formed with the specific intention of opposing the platforms of the Moral Majority and other Christian Right organizations.Williams, Peter W. (1988). America's Religions, p. 482. Princeton: Princeton University Press. Moral Majority Coalition In November 2004, Falwell revived the Moral Majority name for a new organization, the Moral Majority Coalition. The intent of the organization is to continue the \\"evangelical revolution\\" to help conservative politicians get elected. Referring to the Coalition as a \\"21st century resurrection of the Moral Majority,\\" Falwell, a father of the modern \\"religious right\\" political movement, committed to leading the organization for four years.

The collection is housed in the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, an 18th-century palace, which was the home of the American heiress Peggy Guggenheim for three decades. She began displaying her private collection of modern artworks to the public seasonally in 1951. After her death in 1979, it passed to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, which opened the collection year-round from 1980. The collection includes works of prominent Italian futurists and American modernists working in such genres as Cubism, Surrealism and abstract expressionism. It also includes sculptural works. In 2017, Karole Vail, a granddaughter of Peggy Guggenheim, was appointed Director of the collection, succeeding Philip Rylands, who led the museum for 37 years. Collection The collection is principally based on the personal art collection of Peggy Guggenheim, a former wife of artist Max Ernst and a niece of the mining magnate, Solomon R. Guggenheim. She collected the artworks mostly between 1938 and 1946, buying works in Europe \\"in dizzying succession\\" as World War II began, and later in America, where she discovered the talent of Jackson Pollock, among others.Walsh, John. \\"The Priceless Peggy Guggenheim\\", The Independent, October 21, 2009, accessed March 12, 2012 The museum \\"houses an impressive selection of modern art.

Although sometimes mistaken for a modern building,Lauritzen and Zielcke, p. 229 it is an 18th-century palace designed by the Venetian architect Lorenzo Boschetti.Vail, p. 77 The building was unfinished, and has an unusually low elevation on the Grand Canal. The museum's website describes it thus: The palazzo was Peggy Guggenheim's home for thirty years. In 1951, the palazzo, its garden, now called the Nasher Sculpture Garden, and her art collection were opened to the public from April to October for viewing.Vail, p. 92 Her collection at the palazzo remained open during the summers until her death in Camposampiero, northern Italy, in 1979; she had donated the palazzo and the 300-piece collection to the Solomon R.

After the Foundation took control of the building in 1979, it took steps to expand gallery space; by 1985, \\"all of the rooms on the main floor had been converted into galleries ... the white Istrian stone facade and the unique canal terrace had been restored\\" and a protruding arcade wing, called the barchessa, had been rebuilt by architect Giorgio Bellavitis.\\"Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice\\", The Solomon R.

Lawsuits Since 1992, Peggy Guggenheim's grandson, Sandro Rumney, together with his children and some cousins, have raised several disputes with the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. The disputes concern, in part, the difference in language between Guggenheim's unconditional 1976 deed of gift to the foundation, a 1969 letter, and a 1972 version of her will. The courts have found the deed binding.Ruiz, Cristina. \\"Peggy Guggenheim's great- grandchildren say New York exhibition violates her legacy\\" , The Art Newspaper, April 20, 2017 In 1992, Rumney and two other grandsons, sued the foundation in Paris claiming, among other things, that the modernization of the collection did not comply with the letter and spirit of her wishes. In 1994, the court dismissed the claims and ordered the grandsons to pay the foundation court costs.Esterow, Milton. \\"The Bitter Legal Battle over Peggy Guggenheim‚Äôs Blockbuster Art Collection\\", Vanity Fair, January 5, 2017 Following the gift of approximately 80 works to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation by Hannelore and Rudolph Schulhof (a former trustee of the foundation) in 2012, some works collected by Guggenheim were removed from the Palazzo to make room for the display of the new works. The Schulhofs' names were inscribed alongside Guggenheim's at both entrances of the museum. Their son, Michael P. Schulhof, has been a trustee of the Guggenheim foundation since 2009. In 2014, several French descendants of Peggy Guggenheim, led by Rumney, sued the foundation for violating her will and agreements with the foundation, which they said require that her collection \\"remain intact and on display\\". They also claimed that the resting place of her ashes in the gardens of the Palazzo has been desecrated by the display of sculptures nearby, among other things. The lawsuit requested that the founder's bequest be revoked or that the collections, gravesite and signage be restored. Other descendants of Peggy Guggenheim supported the foundation's position. In 2014, the court dismissed the claims and awarded the foundation legal fees. The court noted that the descendants had attended some of the parties held in the gardens by the foundation. In 2015, the Paris Court of Appeal dismissed the lawsuit and awarded the foundation additional legal fees.Carvajal, Doreen. \\"Peggy Guggenheim‚Äôs Kin Lose Bid to Challenge How Her Collection Is Displayed\\", The New York Times, September 23, 2015 Rumney stated his intention to continue to appeal.

Civilian casualties occur in a general sense, when civilians are killed or injured by non-civilians, mostly law enforcement officers, military personnel, or criminals such as terrorists and bank robbers. Under the law of war, it is referred to civilians who perished or suffered wounds as a result of wartime acts. In both cases, they can be associated with the outcome of any form of action regardless of whether civilians were targeted directly or not. Overview Casualties of a mass panic during a June 1941 Japanese bombing of Chongqing.Herbert Bix, Hirohito and the making of modern Japan, 2001, p. 364 More than 5,000 civilians died during the first two days of air raids in 1939. In times of armed conflict, despite numerous advancements in technology, the European Union‚Äôs European Security Strategy, adopted by the European Council in Brussels in December 2003, stated that since 1990, almost 4 million people have died in wars, 90% of them civilians. However, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reports that civilian fatalities have climbed from 5 per cent at the turn of the century to more than 90 per cent in the wars of the 1990s. The body of a young boy on the street after the Finnish Civil War. Generating reliable assessments of casualties of war is a notoriously complex process. Civilian casualties present particular difficulties. One problem is that the attribution of the label ‚Äòcivilian‚Äô is contested in some cases. On the surface, the definition of a civilian, at least in the context of international armed conflicts, is relatively simple: a civilian is any person who is not a member of the armed forces and is not a combatant in Britain of armed conflict. To make effective use of such statistics as there are about civilian casualties of war, it is necessary to be explicit about the criteria for inclusion. All too often, there is a lack of clarity about which of the following categories of civilian casualties are included in any given set of figures.Lives and Statistics: Are 90% of War Victims Civilians? :1. Those killed as a direct effect of war; :2. Those injured as a direct effect of war; :3. Those dying, whether during or after a war, from indirect effects of war such as disease, malnutrition and lawlessness, and who would not have been expected to die at such rates from such causes in the absence of the war; :4. Victims of one-sided violence, such as when states slaughter their own citizens in connection with a war; :5. Victims of rape and other forms of sexual violence in connection with a war; :6. Those uprooted in a war ‚Äì that is, refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs); :7 Those who, even after a war is over, die prematurely from injuries sustained in war. The inclusion of people in each of these categories may be defensible, but needs to be explicit. Each category presents its own methodological problems. In the case of people dying from indirect effects (category 3), much careful work is needed to distinguish between ‚Äòexpected‚Äô and ‚Äòexcess‚Äô levels. of mortality. In the case of victims of sexual crimes (category 5) there could be an argument for including not only direct crimes by combatants, but also 'indirect‚Äô crimes due to general social collapse. In the case of those uprooted in war (category 6), the implication that refugees and IDPs always count as war victims is too simple. Some may be fleeing one-sided violence from a repressive state apparatus, natural calamity, or general social breakdown. Moreover, in certain episodes, such as the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Kosovo War of 1999, and the Afghanistan War of 2001, military campaigns have enabled large numbers of refugees to return home. Indeed, in the 1971 and 1999 wars, refugee return was a stated reason for launching hostilities. Yet this key observation finds remarkably little reflection in the literature about the casualties of contemporary war. A focus on the numbers of those uprooted in war is especially problematic as those who are trapped in conflict zones may in fact be worse off than those uprooted, but seldom feature in statistics. Figures for war deaths and for war-related migration should be presented separately, not amalgamated. International law Following the Second World War, a series of treaties governing the laws of war were adopted starting in 1949. These Geneva Conventions would come into force, in no small part, because of a general reaction against the practices of the Second World War. Although the Fourth Geneva Convention attempted to erect some legal defenses for civilians in time of war, the bulk of the Fourth Convention devoted to explicating civilian rights in occupied territories, and no explicit attention is paid to the problems of bombardment and the hazardous effects in the combat-zone. In 1977, Protocol I was adopted as an amendment to the Geneva Conventions, prohibiting the deliberate or indiscriminate attack of civilians and civilian objects in the war-zone and the attacking force must take precautions and steps to spare the lives of civilians and civilian objects as possible. Although ratified by 173 countries, the only countries that are currently not signatories to Protocol I are the United States, Israel, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Turkey. The Rome Statute defines that \\"intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population\\" to be illegal, but only came into effect on July 1, 2002 and has not been ratified by every country.Rome Statute  Ethics  Many modern nations' views on the ethics of civilian casualties align with the Just War theory, which advocates a system of proportionality. An act of war is deemed proportional in Just War theory if the overall destruction expected from the use of force is outweighed by the projected good to be achieved.http://www.usccb.org/sdwp/international/justwar.htm This view is a war-adapted version of utilitarianism, the moral system which advocates that the morally correct action is the one that does the most good. However, moral philosophers often contest this approach to war. Such theorists advocate absolutism, which holds there are various ethical rules that are, as the name implies, absolute. One such rule is that non-combatants cannot be attacked because they are, by definition, not partaking in combat; to attack non- combatants anyway, regardless of the expected outcome, is to deny them agency. Thus, by the absolutist view, only enemy combatants can be attacked. The philosopher Thomas Nagel advocates this absolutist rule in his essay \\"War and Massacre\\". Finally, the approach of pacifism is the belief that war of any kind is morally unjust. Pacifists sometimes extend humanitarian concern not just to enemy civilians but also to enemy combatants, especially conscripts. =Refugees= The laws of war have changed over the course of history, and international protocols like the Fourth Geneva Convention explicitly provide legal protections to civilians in territories occupied by a belligerent party during and after an international armed conflict. The 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees has also given protection to people who have a well founded fear of persecution. Some researchers have included refugees and internally displaced persons in their definition of \\"civilian casualty\\".Ahlstrom, C. and K.-A. Nordquist (1991). \\"Casualties of conflict: report for the world campaign for the protection of victims of war.\\" Uppsala, Department of Peace and Conflict Research, Uppsala University. Civilian casualty ratio The civilian casualty ratio in an armed conflict is the ratio of civilian casualties to combatant casualties or total casualties. The measurement can apply either to casualties inflicted by a particular belligerent or to casualties in the conflict as a whole. The ratio of ten civilian casualties for every combatant is a frequently-cited, but disputed figure.Roberts, A. (2010). \\"Lives and Statistics: Are 90% of war victims civilians?\\" Survival 52(3): 115-136. Collateral damage Collateral damage is defined in terms of armed conflict as unavoidable or accidental killing or injury of non-combatants or unavoidable or accidental destruction of non-combatant property caused by attacks on legitimate military targets.

The film co-stars Dolph Lundgren, Burt Young, Talia Shire, Carl Weathers, Tony Burton, Brigitte Nielsen and Michael Pataki. Rocky IV was the highest grossing sports movie for 24 years, before it was overtaken by The Blind Side. It is the fourth and most financially successful installment in the Rocky film series. In the film, the Soviet Union and its top boxer make an entrance into professional boxing with their best athlete Ivan Drago, who initially wants to take on World champion Rocky Balboa. Rocky's best friend Apollo Creed decides to fight him instead but is fatally beaten in the ring. Enraged, Rocky decides to fight Drago in the Soviet Union to avenge the death of his friend and defend the honor of his country. Critical reception was mixed, but the film was a huge success at the box office, earning $300 million. This film marked Carl Weathers' final appearance in the series. Its success led to a fifth entry released on November 16, 1990. The events of this film serve as the backstory to the plot of Creed II, where Apollo Creed's son, Donnie, is challenged to fight Drago's son, Viktor. Stallone announced in August 2020 that he is working on a Director's Cut of the film.  Plot  Ivan Drago, a Soviet boxer, arrives in the United States with his wife, Ludmilla, a Soviet swimmer and a team of trainers from the Soviet Union and Cuba. His manager, Nicolai Koloff, takes every opportunity to promote Drago's athleticism as a hallmark of Soviet superiority. Motivated by patriotism and an innate desire to prove himself, Apollo Creed challenges Drago to an exhibition bout. Rocky has reservations, but agrees to train Apollo, despite his misgivings about the match. During a press conference regarding the match, hostility sparks between Apollo's and Drago's respective camps. The boxing exhibition takes place at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas.Block, Marcelline (2011). World Film Locations: Las Vegas. Intellect Books. Pages 40‚Äì41. . Apollo enters the ring in an over-the-top patriotic entrance with James Brown performing \\"Living in America\\" complete with showgirls. The bout starts tamely with Apollo landing several punches that are ineffective against Drago, but Drago suddenly retaliates with devastating effects. By the end of the first round, Rocky and Apollo's trainer, Duke, plead with him to stop the match, but Apollo refuses to do so and tells Rocky to not stop the match \\"no matter what.\\" Drago continues to pummel him in the second round and Duke begs Rocky to throw in the towel. Rocky honors Apollo's wishes, which allows Drago to land one final punch on Apollo, killing him. In the aftermath, Drago displays no sense of contrition, commenting to the assembled media: \\"If he dies, he dies.\\" Frustrated by the Soviets' cold indifference, Rocky decides to challenge Drago himself, but has to surrender his championship to do so. Drago's camp agrees to an unsanctioned 15-round fight in the Soviet Union on Christmas Day, an arrangement meant to protect Drago from the threats of violence he has been receiving in the United States. Rocky travels to the Soviet Union without Adrian due to her disapproval of the match, setting up his training base in a remote cabin in Krasnogourbinsk with only Duke and Paulie to accompany him. Duke opens up to Rocky, stating that he actually raised Apollo and that his death felt like a father losing his son, and expresses his faith in Rocky that he will emerge victorious. To prepare for the match, Drago uses high-tech equipment, a team of trainers and doctors monitoring his every movement, and regular doses of anabolic steroids. Rocky, on the other hand, does roadwork in deep snow over mountainous terrain and workouts utilizing antiquated farm equipment. Adrian arrives unexpectedly to give Rocky her support, which gives Rocky a new vigor. Before the match, Drago is introduced with an elaborate patriotic ceremony, with the Soviet general secretary and the Politburo in attendance. The home crowd is squarely on Drago's side and hostile to Rocky. In contrast to his match with Apollo, Drago immediately goes on the offensive. Rocky takes a fierce pounding in the first round, but goes on the offensive toward the end of the second round after landing a brutal right hook that cuts Drago's left eye, stunning both Drago and the crowd. Duke encourages Rocky by reminding him that he just proved Drago is a man and not a machine as he's been made out to be. In contrast, Drago comments to his trainers that Rocky \\"is not human, he is like a piece of iron,\\" after his trainers reprimand him for his performance against the \\"weak\\" American. The two boxers spend the next dozen rounds trading blows, with Rocky managing to continually hold his ground despite Drago's best efforts. His resilience and determination rallies the previously hostile Soviet crowd to his side. After being berated by Koloff, Drago rebels, throwing him from the ring and directly addressing Gorbachev, stating he fights only for himself. In the final round, with both fighters exhausted, Rocky initially takes more punishment, then seizes an opening and unleashes a series of vicious blows to defeat Drago by knockout. Rocky gives a victory speech, acknowledging that the local crowd's disdain of him had turned to mutual respect during the fight. Rocky finally declares, \\"If I can change and you can change, everybody can change!\\" The Soviet premier stands up and reluctantly applauds Rocky, and his aides follow suit. Rocky ends his speech by wishing his son watching the match on TV a Merry Christmas, and raises his arms into the air in victory as the crowd applauds, concluding the movie. Cast =Main cast= * Sylvester Stallone as Robert \\"Rocky\\" Balboa Sr., \\"The Italian Stallion\\": Beloved Heavyweight Champion of the World * Talia Shire as Adrian Balboa: Rocky's wife and support through his boxing career. * Burt Young as Paulie Pennino: Rocky's friend and brother-in-law. * Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed: Former Heavyweight Champion of the World, and close friend to Rocky. * Brigitte Nielsen as Ludmilla Vobet Drago: Wife and supporter of Ivan Drago, and Olympic swimming champion. In real-life Nielsen was engaged to Stallone during the production, and married shortly after the release. Both were divorced in 1987. * Dolph Lundgren as Captain Ivan Drago: the Soviets' prize Champion boxer and a Soviet Army infantry captain =Supporting cast= * Tony Burton as Tony \\"Duke\\" Evers: Apollo's father-figure, friend, trainer and manager, who becomes Rocky's trainer for his match against Drago. * Michael Pataki as Nicolai Koloff: Trainer, promoter, and manager of Ivan Drago. *Rocky Krakoff as Rocky Jr. * David Lloyd Austin as Soviet Leader (uncredited) LeRoy Neiman plays the ring announcer in the Creed-Drago match. Burgess Meredith appears as Mickey Goldmill in archive footage. Appearing as themselves are singer James Brown and commentators Stu Nahan, Warner Wolf, R. J. Adams, Barry Tompkins and Al Bandiero. Production =Development and writing= Wyoming doubled for the frozen expanse of the Soviet Union. The small farm where Rocky lived and trained was in Jackson Hole, and Grand Teton National Park was used for filming many of the outdoor sequences in the Soviet Union. The PNE Agrodome at Hastings Park in Vancouver, British Columbia served as the location of Rocky's Soviet bout. Sylvester Stallone has stated that the original punching scenes filmed between him and Dolph Lundgren in the first portion of the fight are completely authentic. Stallone wanted to capture a realistic scene and Lundgren agreed that they would engage in legitimate sparring. One particularly forceful Lundgren punch to Stallone's chest slammed his heart against his breastbone, causing the heart to swell. Stallone, suffering from labored breathing and a blood pressure over 200, was flown from the set in Canada to Saint John's Regional Medical Center in Santa Monica, and was forced into intensive care for eight days. Stallone later commented that he believed Lundgren had the athletic ability and talent to fight in the professional heavyweight division of boxing. Additionally, Stallone has stated that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit during the filming of the Apollo- vs.-Drago \\"exhibition\\" fight. At one point in the filming of the scene, Lundgren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring. Weathers shouted profanities at Lundgren while leaving the ring, and announcing that he was calling his agent and quitting the movie. Only after Stallone forced the two actors to reconcile did filming continue. The event caused a four-day work stoppage, while Weathers was talked back into the part and Lundgren agreed to tone down his aggressiveness. Rocky IV is one of the few sport movies that applies genuine sound effects from actual punches, bona fide training methods created by boxing consultants, and a bevy of other new special effects. The film is recognized as being ahead of its time in its demonstration of groundbreaking high-tech sporting equipment, some of which was experimental and 20 years from public use. In 2012, Olympians Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte noted that the training sequences in Rocky IV inspired them to use a cabin similar to what the resourceful Balboa utilized in the film. =Pre- production= Sportscaster Stu Nahan makes his fourth appearance in the series as commentator for the Creed‚ÄìDrago fight. Warner Wolf replaces Bill Baldwin, who died following filming for Rocky III, as co-commentator. For the fight between Rocky and Drago, commentators Barry Tompkins and Al Bandiero portray themselves as USA Network broadcasters. Apollo Creed's wife Mary Anne (Sylvia Meals) made her second appearance in the series, the first being Rocky II, although the character was mainly featured in Rocky II. Stallone's future wife, Brigitte Nielsen, appeared as Drago's wife, Ludmilla. Paulie's robot, a character that through the years has enjoyed a cult following of its own, was created by International Robotics Inc. in New York City. The robot's initial voice was that of the company's CEO, Robert Doornick. The robot is identified by its engineers as \\"SICO\\" and is/was a member of the Screen Actors Guild. It toured with James Brown in the 1980s. The robot was written into the movie after it had been used to help treat Stallone's autistic son, Seargeoh.Edwards, Phil. \\"The Rocky IV robot‚Äôs secret connection to autism treatment,\\" Trivia Happy (Mar. 27, 2014). The Soviet premier in the sky box during the Rocky‚ÄìDrago match, played by David Lloyd Austin, strongly resembles contemporary Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Austin later played Gorbachev in The Naked Gun, and Russian characters in other films. =Litigation= The script development was the subject of a famous copyright lawsuit, Anderson v. Stallone.Anderson v. Stallone, 11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989) Timothy Anderson developed a treatment for Rocky IV on spec; after the studio decided not to buy his treatment, he sued when the resulting movie script was similar to his treatment. The court held that Anderson had prepared an unauthorized derivative work of the characters Stallone had developed in Rocky I through III, and thus he could not enforce his unauthorized story extension against the owner of the character's copyrights. Music =Soundtrack= The musical score for Rocky IV was composed by Vince DiCola, who would later compose the music for The Transformers: The Movie. Rocky IV is the only film in the series not to feature original music by Bill Conti, who was replaced by DiCola; however, it does feature arrangements of themes composed by Conti from previous films in the series, such as \\"The Final Bell\\". Conti, who was too busy with the first two Karate Kid films at the time, would return for Rocky V and Rocky Balboa. Conti's famous piece of music from the Rocky series, \\"Gonna Fly Now\\", does not appear at all in Rocky IV (the first time in the series this happened), though a few bars of it are incorporated into DiCola's training montage instrumental. Songs from the movie included \\"Living in America\\", by James Brown, and also music by John Cafferty (\\"Heart's on Fire\\", featuring Vince DiCola), Survivor, Kenny Loggins, and Robert Tepper. Four of these songs became U.S. chart hits, three of which reached the Top Five. Go West wrote \\"One Way Street\\" for the movie by request of Sylvester Stallone. Europe's hit \\"The Final Countdown\\", written earlier in the decade by lead singer Joey Tempest, is often incorrectly stated as being featured in the film due to its similarity to DiCola's \\"Training Montage.\\" However, Europe's track was not released as a single until late 1986, after Rocky IV's release. According to singer Peter Cetera, he originally wrote his best-selling solo single \\"Glory of Love\\" as the end title for this film, but was passed over by United Artists, and instead used the theme for The Karate Kid Part II. Release =Theatrical= Rocky IV premiered in Westwood, Los Angeles on November 21, 1985. Reception =Box office= The film opened Wednesday, November 27 on 1,325 screens and over the 5-day Thanksgiving weekend, it grossed a non-summer record $31,770,105. In its fourth week of release it expanded to a record 2,232 screens. It grossed a total of $127.8 million in United States and Canada, and $300 million worldwide, the most of any Rocky film. It was the highest-grossing sports film of all time, until The Blind Side (2009), which grossed $309 million (without accounting for inflation). It was also the highest-grossing fourth installment of a film in the United States and Canada, surpassing the record of Sudden Impact (1983). Stallone has been quoted as saying the enormous financial success and fan-following of Rocky IV once had him envisioning another Rocky movie, devoted to Drago and his post-boxing life, with Balboa's storyline running parallel to Drago's. However, he noted the damage both boxers sustained in the fight made them \\"incapable of reason\\", and thus instead planned Rocky V as a showcase of the dangers of boxing. =Critical response= The film has a 40% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, from 48 critics, indicating mixed reviews; the critical consensus states, \\"Rocky IV inflates the action to absurd heights, but it ultimately rings hollow thanks to a story that hits the same basic beats as the first three entries in the franchise.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 42 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, stating that with this film the Rocky series began \\"finally losing its legs. It's been a long run, one hit movie after another, but Rocky IV is a last gasp, a film so predictable that viewing it is like watching one of those old sitcoms where the characters never change and the same situations turn up again and again.\\" Ian Nathan of Empire gave the film two out of five stars, calling the script a \\"laughable turd\\" and describing Rocky IV as \\"the [film] where the Rocky series threw in the towel on the credibility.\\" Gene Siskel of The Chicago Tribune gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars, and stated in his review, \\"[Stallone] creates credible villains worthy of his heroic character.\\" Russian goodwill ambassador Katya Lycheva objected to the character Ivan Drago, saying that the film uses him to vilify the Russian people. =Accolades= Dolph Lundgren received acclaim for his performance as Ivan Drago. He won the Marshall Trophy for Best Actor at the Napierville Cinema Festival. Rocky IV also won Germany's Golden Screen Award. The film won five Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Actor (Sylvester Stallone, along with Rambo: First Blood Part II), Worst Director (Stallone), Worst Supporting Actress (Brigitte Nielsen), Worst New Star (Nielsen, and also for Red Sonja) and Worst Musical Score. It also received nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Supporting Actress (Talia Shire), Worst Supporting Actor (Burt Young) and Worst Screenplay. =Analysis= Scholars note that the film's strong yet formulaic structure emphasizes the power of the individual, embodied by Rocky, the prototypically American hero who is inventive, determined, and idealistic. They contrast that with Ivan Drago's hyperbolic characterization as a representation of Soviet power in the context of the latter part of the Cold War. Writer/director Stallone highlights the nationalistic overtones of the Balboa‚ÄìDrago fight throughout the film, such as when Drago's wife calls the United States an \\"antagonistic and violent government,\\" that is filled with \\"threats of violence\\" to her husband. Drago's trainer comments that American society has become \\"pathetic and weak.\\" Drago represents the totalitarian regime, demonstrating his power when he topples an arrogant opponent (Creed). Later on, the radio announcer says, \\"Ivan Drago is a man with an entire country in his corner.\\" Scholars note that Drago's ultimate defeat ‚Äî and the Soviet crowd's embrace of Rocky ‚Äî represents a crumbling of the Soviet Union. Rocky IV has also been interpreted as a commentary on the power struggle between technology and humans, illustrated by both Paulie's robot and the technology utilized by Drago's trainers. Other media =Sequel= A sequel titled Rocky V, was released in 1990. =Novelization= A novelization was published by Ballantine Books in 1985. Sylvester Stallone was credited as the author. =Video games= In 1987, Rocky was released, based on the first four Rocky films. In 2002 was released Rocky, based on the first five Rocky films. In 2004 was released Rocky Legends, based on the first four Rocky films.

Isidore de Lara, born Isidore Cohen (9 August 18582 September 1935), was an English composer and singer. After studying in Italy and France, he returned to England where he taught for several years at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and became a well known singer and composer of art songs. In the early 1880s he began to compose music for the stage, eventually achieving his greatest successes with opera in Monte Carlo from the late 1890s through the outbreak of World War I. His most popular opera, Messaline (1899), enjoyed frequent revivals throughout Europe and in the United States during the first quarter of the 20th century. He returned to London and spent much of the 1920s trying to create a permanent National opera company in England, without much success. Biography Portrait photograph of Isidore de Lara Born in London, de Lara went to Milan in 1874 to study composition with Alberto Mazzucato and singing with Francesco Lamperti at the Milan Conservatory. In 1876 he went to Paris to study with √âdouard Lalo. The following year he returned to London to take a position as a professor of singing at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He became known as a concert singer and a writer of vocal songs, of which his The Garden of Sleep (1877) and After Silent Years (1887) were particularly popular.Nigel Burton, Susan Thach Dean: \\"Isidore de Lara\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 30 January 2009), (subscription access) In the early 1880s, de Lara began to switch his attention to composing music for the theatre. His first opera, The Royal Word, premiered at the Gaiety Theatre, London on 17 April 1883 with de Lara portraying the role of Charles II of England. This was soon followed by Wrong Notes (1883) and Minna, or The Fall from the Cliff (1886). A few years later the acclaimed French baritone Victor Maurel persuaded him to turn his cantata The Light of Asia, based on the life of Buddha, into an Italian opera, La luce dell'Asia, which was produced at Covent Garden in 1892. In 1893 de Lara's opera Amy Robsart was given in French at Covent Garden with Emma Calv√©. Well received, the work was staged the following year at the Op√©ra de Monte- Carlo. While in Monte Carlo, De Lara met Princess Alice of Monaco who became a close friend, patron and, eventually, lover. Under her support, De Lara remained in Monaco and moved into the most successful part of his career. His opera Mo√Øna was produced there in 1897. It was followed in 1899 by his most famous work, Messaline, which featured the presence of the greatest Italian heroic tenor of the era, Francesco Tamagno, in the cast of the premiere performance. Messaline proved very popular and was the inspiration for Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's painting of the same name. Notably, it was the first opera by an English composer to be mounted at La Scala (in 1901).Nigel Burton: \\"Messaline\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 25 January 2009), (subscription access) With the outbreak of World War I, de Lara returned to London. Concerned for the survival of the arts during this time, he established a fund for the relief of distressed musicians. At the close of the war, he strove to establish an English national opera throughout the 1920s, but was unable to get the financial support needed to maintain a permanent company. He retired to Paris where he died on 2 August 1935. Works De Lara was a moderately prolific composer, producing a total of 13 operas, 67 vocal art songs, and a small amount of chamber music. His musical style was highly eclectic, although the influences of Jules Massenet and Camille Saint-Sa√´ns are readily apparent within his operas. Musicologist Nigel Burton wrote, \\"His style may be said to have developed, but it never really settled down.\\" The somewhat erratic side to his writing was a weakness and a strength. The fluctuating musical vocabulary in his writing enabled him to create any attitude, emotion, or impression at a moment's notice, but at times the musical effects seem out of place or without cause; a criticism also made of Giacomo Meyerbeer. Critics have also commented on de Lara's tendency towards over sentimentality. As one critic said, \\"at the moments when the music should attempt to rise to dramatic greatness, it degenerates into synthetic posturings.\\" However, de Lara by all accounts had a wonderful musical ear and at his best he is a fine composer. Perhaps de Lara's strongest area was his skill at orchestration which was both tasteful and highly creative at the same time. =Selected operas= * The Royal Word (1883) * Wrong Notes (1883) * Minna, or The Fall from the Cliff (1886) * La luce dell'Asia (The Light of Asia) (1892, Covent Garden) * Amy Robsart (1893, Covent Garden) * Mo√Øna (1897, Monte Carlo) * Messaline (1899, Monte Carlo) * Sol√©a (1907) * Na√Øl (abt. 1910) * Les trois mousquetaires (abt. 1920) References * Oxford Dictionary of National Biography *Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), The Oxford Dictionary of Opera, 782 pages, External links * *Play by Isidore de Lara on Great War Theatre Category:English opera composers Category:Male opera composers Category:English classical composers Category:British Jews Category:French Jews Category:Jewish classical composers Category:1858 births Category:1935 deaths Category:Musicians from London Category:Milan Conservatory alumni Category:Academics of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama Category:English male classical composers ","title":"Isidore de Lara"},{"id":"104987","title":"Steven Wright"},{"id":"104988","text":"Atrocities is the fourth studio album by American rock band Christian Death, released in 1986 through record label Normal.

Etymology The term \\"sequential art\\" was coined in 1985 by comics artist Will Eisner in his book Comics and Sequential Art. Eisner analyzed this form into four elements: design, drawing, caricature, and writing. Scott McCloud, another comics artist, elaborated the explanation further, in his books Understanding Comics (1993) and Reinventing Comics (2000). In Understanding Comics, he notes that the movie roll, before it is being projected, arguably could be seen as a very slow comic.\\"You might say that before it‚Äôs projected, film is just a very very very very slow comic!\\"‚ÄîScott McCloud as quoted in Michael Cadden, Telling Children's Stories: Narrative Theory and Children's Literature, University of Nebraska Press, 2010, p. 149.Eadweard Muybridge was interested in what closely-spaced sequential photography could show about motion; his works blur the line between science and art, although they are not proper comics.

It has given its name to the Swiss canton through which its upper portion flows. Course The river rises in the Val Bedretto in Switzerland at the frontier between the cantons of Valais and Ticino, is fed by the glaciers of the Alps and later flows through Lake Maggiore, before entering Italy. The Ticino joins the Po a few kilometres downstream (along the Ticino) from Pavia. It is about long. The highest point of the drainage basin is the summit of Grenzgipfel (a subpeak of Monte Rosa), at . Beneath it flows the Anza, a right-bank tributary of the Ticino. The river is dammed in Switzerland in order to create hydroelectricity, while in Italy it is primarily used for irrigation. History The legendary Gallic leader Bellovesus was said to have defeated the Etruscans here in circa 600 BC. Ticino was the location of the Battle of Ticinus, the first battle of the Second Punic War fought between the Carthaginian forces of Hannibal and the Romans under Publius Cornelius Scipio in November 218 BC. The Ticino was in the territory of the Duchy of Milan during much of the later medieval and early modern period, although its upper portion as far as Bellinzona in 1500 and as far as the shores of Lago Maggiore in 1513, fell to the Old Swiss Confederacy as a result of the Swiss campaigns in the Italian Wars. Towns and tributaries Part of the river Ticino, south of Milan-Malpensa Airport in Italy. =Val Bedretto= The upper Ticino near Airolo Val Bedretto, a narrow alpine valley named after the village of Bedretto, culminates in Nufenen Pass, Italian Passo della Novena, at located between Pizzo Gallina and Nufenstock. Through it runs the border between the cantons of Valais and Ticino. A road constructed in 1964 goes over the pass ultimately leading to the Rh√¥ne Valley on the other side. French is mainly spoken in Valais but near the pass German is spoken. The population of Ticino speaks Italian. The road up the val is fairly straight until it approaches the pass, where it becomes hairpin. On the slope below the first hairpin at about is an area of springs from which the Ticino originates. Subsequently, it becomes a mountain brook flowing straight down the val to the village of All'Acqua or All'Acqua Ospizio at , named for the hospice for travellers located there at the previous end of the road in former centuries. Currently it is a base for skiing and hiking. Below it is Ronco at and Bedretto at . The val is subject to avalanches and snow can remain on the ground as late as September. Below Bedretto the Ri di Cristallina, \\"Cristallina stream\\", comes in from the right at Ossasco, and further down Fontana, still in Bedretto.

Ethnicity is sometimes used interchangeably with the term nation, particularly in cases of ethnic nationalism, and is separate from, but related to the concept of races. Ethnicity can be an inherited status or based on the society within which one lives. Membership of an ethnic group tends to be defined by a shared cultural heritage, ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language or dialect, symbolic systems such as religion, mythology and ritual, cuisine, dressing style, art or physical appearance. Ethnic groups often continue to speak related languages and share a similar gene pool. By way of language shift, acculturation, adoption and religious conversion, individuals or groups may over time shift from one ethnic group to another. Ethnic groups may be subdivided into subgroups or tribes, which over time may become separate ethnic groups themselves due to endogamy or physical isolation from the parent group. Conversely, formerly separate ethnicities can merge to form a pan-ethnicity and may eventually merge into one single ethnicity. Whether through division or amalgamation, the formation of a separate ethnic identity is referred to as ethnogenesis. Terminology The term ethnic is derived from the Greek word ·ºîŒ∏ŒΩŒøœÇ ethnos (more precisely, from the adjective ·ºêŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫œåœÇ ethnikos,·ºêŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫œåœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus which was loaned into Latin as ethnicus). The inherited English language term for this concept is folk, used alongside the latinate people since the late Middle English period. In Early Modern English and until the mid-19th century, ethnic was used to mean heathen or pagan (in the sense of disparate \\"nations\\" which did not yet participate in the Christian oikumene), as the Septuagint used ta ethne (\\"the nations\\") to translate the Hebrew goyim \\"the nations, non-Hebrews, non-Jews\\".ThiE. Tonkin, M. McDonald and M. Chapman, History and Ethnicity (London 1989), pp.11‚Äì17 (quoted in J. Hutchinson & A.D. Smith (eds.), Oxford readers: Ethnicity (Oxford 1996), pp.18‚Äì24) The Greek term in early antiquity (Homeric Greek) could refer to any large group, a host of men, a band of comrades as well as a swarm or flock of animals. In Classical Greek, the term took on a meaning comparable to the concept now expressed by \\"ethnic group\\", mostly translated as \\"nation, people\\"; only in Hellenistic Greek did the term tend to become further narrowed to refer to \\"foreign\\" or \\"barbarous\\" nations in particular (whence the later meaning \\"heathen, pagan\\").·ºîŒ∏ŒΩŒøœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus In the 19th century, the term came to be used in the sense of \\"peculiar to a race, people or nation\\", in a return to the original Greek meaning. The sense of \\"different cultural groups\\", and in American English \\"racial, cultural or national minority group\\" arises in the 1930s to 1940s, Oxford English Dictionary Second edition, online version as of 2008-01-12, \\"ethnic, a. and n.\\". Cites Sir Daniel Wilson, The arch√¶ology and prehistoric annals of Scotland 1851 (1863) and Huxley & Haddon (1935), We Europeans, pp. 136,181 serving as a replacement of the term race which had earlier taken this sense but was now becoming deprecated due to its association with ideological racism. The abstract ethnicity had been used for \\"paganism\\" in the 18th century, but now came to express the meaning of an \\"ethnic character\\" (first recorded 1953). The term ethnic group was first recorded in 1935 and entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 1972.Cohen, Ronald. (1978) \\"Ethnicity: Problem and Focus in Anthropology\\", Annu. Rev. Anthropol. 1978. 7:379-403; Glazer, Nathan and Daniel P. Moynihan (1975) Ethnicity‚Äì Theory and Experience, Cambridge, Massachusetts Harvard University Press. The modern usage definition of the Oxford English Dictionary is: (Oxford English Dictionary Second edition, online version as of 2008-01-12, s.v. \\"ethnic, a. and n.\\") Depending on the context that is used, the term nationality may either be used synonymously with ethnicity or synonymously with citizenship (in a sovereign state). The process that results in the emergence of an ethnicity is called ethnogenesis, a term in use in ethnological literature since about 1950. The term may also be used with the connotation of something exotic (cf. \\"ethnic restaurant\\", etc.), generally related to cultures of more recent immigrants, who arrived after the dominant population of an area was established. Depending on which source of group identity is emphasized to define membership, the following types of (often mutually overlapping) groups can be identified: * Ethno-linguistic, emphasizing shared language, dialect (and possibly script)‚Äì example: French Canadians * Ethno-national, emphasizing a shared polity or sense of national identity‚Äì example: Austrians * Ethno-racial, emphasizing shared physical appearance based on genetic origins‚Äì example: African Americans * Ethno- regional, emphasizing a distinct local sense of belonging stemming from relative geographic isolation‚Äì example: South Islanders of New Zealand * Ethno-religious, emphasizing shared affiliation with a particular religion, denomination or sect‚Äì example: Jews In many cases, more than one aspect determines membership: for instance, Armenian ethnicity can be defined by citizenship of Armenia, native use of the Armenian language, or membership of the Armenian Apostolic Church. Definitions and conceptual history Ethnography begins in classical antiquity; after early authors like Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus, Herodotus in c. 480 BC laid the foundation of both historiography and ethnography of the ancient world. The Greeks at this time did not describe foreign nations but had also developed a concept of their own \\"ethnicity\\", which they grouped under the name of Hellenes. Herodotus (8.144.2) gave a famous account of what defined Greek (Hellenic) ethnic identity in his day, enumerating # shared descent (·ΩÖŒºŒ±ŒπŒºŒøŒΩ ‚Äì homaimon, \\"of the same blood\\"),·ΩÖŒºŒ±ŒπŒºŒøœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus # shared language (·ΩÅŒºœåŒ≥ŒªœâœÉœÉŒøŒΩ ‚Äì homogl≈çsson, \\"speaking the same language\\")·ΩÅŒºœåŒ≥ŒªœâœÉœÉŒøœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus # shared sanctuaries and sacrifices (Greek: Œ∏Œµ·ø∂ŒΩ ·º±Œ¥œÅœçŒºŒ±œÑŒ¨ œÑŒµ Œ∫ŒøŒπŒΩ·Ω∞ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œ∏œÖœÉŒØŒ±Œπ ‚Äì the≈çn hidrumata te koina kai thusiai)I.

Leoussi, Steven Grosby, Nationalism and Ethnosymbolism: History, Culture, and Ethnicity in the Formation of Nations, Edinburgh University Press, 2006, p. 115 Whether ethnicity qualifies as a cultural universal is to some extent dependent on the exact definition used. Many social scientists, such as anthropologists Fredrik Barth and Eric Wolf, do not consider ethnic identity to be universal. They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups. According to Thomas Hylland Eriksen, the study of ethnicity was dominated by two distinct debates until recently. * One is between \\"primordialism\\" and \\"instrumentalism\\". In the primordialist view, the participant perceives ethnic ties collectively, as an externally given, even coercive, social bond.Geertz, Clifford, ed. (1967) Old Societies and New States: The Quest for Modernity in Africa and Asia. New York: The Free Press. The instrumentalist approach, on the other hand, treats ethnicity primarily as an ad-hoc element of a political strategy, used as a resource for interest groups for achieving secondary goals such as, for instance, an increase in wealth, power, or status.Cohen, Abner (1969) Custom and Politics in Urban Africa: A Study of Hausa Migrants in a Yoruba Town. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul.Abner Cohen (1974) Two-Dimensional Man: An essay on power and symbolism in complex society. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul. This debate is still an important point of reference in Political science, although most scholars' approaches fall between the two poles.J. Hutchinson & A.D. Smith (eds.), Oxford readers: Ethnicity (Oxford 1996), \\"Introduction\\", 8-9 * The second debate is between \\"constructivism\\" and \\"essentialism\\". Constructivists view national and ethnic identities as the product of historical forces, often recent, even when the identities are presented as old.Gellner, Ernest (1983) Nations and Nationalism. Oxford: Blackwell.Ernest Gellner (1997) Nationalism. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson. Essentialists view such identities as ontological categories defining social actors.Smith, Anthony D. (1986) The Ethnic Origins of Nations. Oxford: Blackwell.Anthony Smith (1991) National Identity. Harmondsworth: Penguin. According to Eriksen, these debates have been superseded, especially in anthropology, by scholars' attempts to respond to increasingly politicized forms of self-representation by members of different ethnic groups and nations. This is in the context of debates over multiculturalism in countries, such as the United States and Canada, which have large immigrant populations from many different cultures, and post- colonialism in the Caribbean and South Asia.T.H. Eriksen \\"Ethnic identity, national identity and intergroup conflict: The significance of personal experiences\\" in Ashmore, Jussim, Wilder (eds.): Social identity, intergroup conflict, and conflict reduction, pp. 42‚Äì70. Oxford: Oxford University Press'. 2001 Max Weber maintained that ethnic groups were k√ºnstlich (artificial, i.e. a social construct) because they were based on a subjective belief in shared Gemeinschaft (community). Secondly, this belief in shared Gemeinschaft did not create the group; the group created the belief. Third, group formation resulted from the drive to monopolize power and status. This was contrary to the prevailing naturalist belief of the time, which held that socio-cultural and behavioral differences between peoples stemmed from inherited traits and tendencies derived from common descent, then called \\"race\\".Banton, Michael. (2007) \\"Weber on Ethnic Communities: A critique\\", Nations and Nationalism 13 (1), 2007, 19‚Äì35. Another influential theoretician of ethnicity was Fredrik Barth, whose \\"Ethnic Groups and Boundaries\\" from 1969 has been described as instrumental in spreading the usage of the term in social studies in the 1980s and 1990s. Barth went further than Weber in stressing the constructed nature of ethnicity. To Barth, ethnicity was perpetually negotiated and renegotiated by both external ascription and internal self-identification. Barth's view is that ethnic groups are not discontinuous cultural isolates or logical a priority to which people naturally belong. He wanted to part with anthropological notions of cultures as bounded entities, and ethnicity as primordialist bonds, replacing it with a focus on the interface between groups. \\"Ethnic Groups and Boundaries\\", therefore, is a focus on the interconnectedness of ethnic identities. Barth writes: \\"...categorical ethnic distinctions do not depend on an absence of mobility, contact, and information, but do entail social processes of exclusion and incorporation whereby discrete categories are maintained despite changing participation and membership in the course of individual life histories.\\" In 1978, anthropologist Ronald Cohen claimed that the identification of \\"ethnic groups\\" in the usage of social scientists often reflected inaccurate labels more than indigenous realities: > ...the named ethnic identities we accept, often unthinkingly, as basic > givens in the literature are often arbitrarily, or even worse inaccurately, > imposed. In this way, he pointed to the fact that identification of an ethnic group by outsiders, e.g. anthropologists, may not coincide with the self-identification of the members of that group. He also described that in the first decades of usage, the term ethnicity had often been used in lieu of older terms such as \\"cultural\\" or \\"tribal\\" when referring to smaller groups with shared cultural systems and shared heritage, but that \\"ethnicity\\" had the added value of being able to describe the commonalities between systems of group identity in both tribal and modern societies. Cohen also suggested that claims concerning \\"ethnic\\" identity (like earlier claims concerning \\"tribal\\" identity) are often colonialist practices and effects of the relations between colonized peoples and nation-states.Ronald Cohen 1978 \\"Ethnicity: Problem and Focus in Anthropology\\", Annual Review of Anthropology 7: 383-384 Palo Alto: Stanford University Press According to Paul James, formations of identity were often changed and distorted by colonization, but identities are not made out of nothing: > [C]ategorizations about identity, even when codified and hardened into clear > typologies by processes of colonization, state formation or general > modernizing processes, are always full of tensions and contradictions. > Sometimes these contradictions are destructive, but they can also be > creative and positive. Social scientists have thus focused on how, when, and why different markers of ethnic identity become salient. Thus, anthropologist Joan Vincent observed that ethnic boundaries often have a mercurial character.Vincent, Joan (1974), \\"The Structure of Ethnicity\\" in Human Organization 33(4): 375-379 Ronald Cohen concluded that ethnicity is \\"a series of nesting dichotomizations of inclusiveness and exclusiveness\\". He agrees with Joan Vincent's observation that (in Cohen's paraphrase) \\"Ethnicity... can be narrowed or broadened in boundary terms in relation to the specific needs of political mobilization. This may be why descent is sometimes a marker of ethnicity, and sometimes not: which diacritic of ethnicity is salient depends on whether people are scaling ethnic boundaries up or down, and whether they are scaling them up or down depends generally on the political situation. Kanchan Chandra rejects the expansive definitions of ethnic identity (such as those that include common culture, common language, common history and common territory), choosing instead to define ethnic identity narrowly as a subset of identity categories determined by the belief of common descent. =Approaches to understanding ethnicity= Different approaches to understanding ethnicity have been used by different social scientists when trying to understand the nature of ethnicity as a factor in human life and society. As Jonathan M. Hall observes, World War II was a turning point in ethnic studies. The consequences of Nazi racism discouraged essentialist interpretations of ethnic groups and race. Ethnic groups came to be defined as social rather than biological entities. Their coherence was attributed to shared myths, descent, kinship, a commonplace of origin, language, religion, customs, and national character. So, ethnic groups are conceived as mutable rather than stable, constructed in discursive practices rather than written in the genes.David Konstan, \\"Defining Ancient Greek Ethnicity\\", Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies, vol. 6, 1 (1997), pp. 97‚Äì98. Overview of J.M. Hall's book \\"Ethnic Identity in Greek Antiquity\\", Cambridge University Press, 1997 Examples of various approaches are primordialism, essentialism, perennialism, constructivism, modernism, and instrumentalism. * \\"Primordialism\\", holds that ethnicity has existed at all times of human history and that modern ethnic groups have historical continuity into the far past. For them, the idea of ethnicity is closely linked to the idea of nations and is rooted in the pre-Weber understanding of humanity as being divided into primordially existing groups rooted by kinship and biological heritage. ** \\"Essentialist primordialism\\" further holds that ethnicity is an a priori fact of human existence, that ethnicity precedes any human social interaction and that it is unchanged by it. This theory sees ethnic groups as natural, not just as historical. It also has problems dealing with the consequences of intermarriage, migration and colonization for the composition of modern-day multi-ethnic societies. ** \\"Kinship primordialism\\" holds that ethnic communities are extensions of kinship units, basically being derived by kinship or clan ties where the choices of cultural signs (language, religion, traditions) are made exactly to show this biological affinity. In this way, the myths of common biological ancestry that are a defining feature of ethnic communities are to be understood as representing actual biological history. A problem with this view on ethnicity is that it is more often than not the case that mythic origins of specific ethnic groups directly contradict the known biological history of an ethnic community. ** \\"Geertz's primordialism\\", notably espoused by anthropologist Clifford Geertz, argues that humans in general attribute an overwhelming power to primordial human \\"givens\\" such as blood ties, language, territory, and cultural differences. In Geertz' opinion, ethnicity is not in itself primordial but humans perceive it as such because it is embedded in their experience of the world. * \\"Perennialism\\", an approach that is primarily concerned with nationhood but tends to see nations and ethnic communities as basically the same phenomenon holds that the nation, as a type of social and political organization, is of an immemorial or \\"perennial\\" character.Smith (1998), 159. Smith (1999) distinguishes two variants: \\"continuous perennialism\\", which claims that particular nations have existed for very long periods, and \\"recurrent perennialism\\", which focuses on the emergence, dissolution and reappearance of nations as a recurring aspect of human history.Smith (1999), 5. ** \\"Perpetual perennialism\\" holds that specific ethnic groups have existed continuously throughout history. ** \\"Situational perennialism\\" holds that nations and ethnic groups emerge, change and vanish through the course of history. This view holds that the concept of ethnicity is a tool used by political groups to manipulate resources such as wealth, power, territory or status in their particular groups' interests. Accordingly, ethnicity emerges when it is relevant as a means of furthering emergent collective interests and changes according to political changes in society. Examples of a perennialist interpretation of ethnicity are also found in Barth and Seidner who see ethnicity as ever-changing boundaries between groups of people established through ongoing social negotiation and interaction. ** \\"Instrumentalist perennialism\\", while seeing ethnicity primarily as a versatile tool that identified different ethnics groups and limits through time, explains ethnicity as a mechanism of social stratification, meaning that ethnicity is the basis for a hierarchical arrangement of individuals. According to Donald Noel, a sociologist who developed a theory on the origin of ethnic stratification, ethnic stratification is a \\"system of stratification wherein some relatively fixed group membership (e.g., race, religion, or nationality) is utilized as a major criterion for assigning social positions\\". Ethnic stratification is one of many different types of social stratification, including stratification based on socio-economic status, race, or gender. According to Donald Noel, ethnic stratification will emerge only when specific ethnic groups are brought into contact with one another, and only when those groups are characterized by a high degree of ethnocentrism, competition, and differential power. Ethnocentrism is the tendency to look at the world primarily from the perspective of one's own culture, and to downgrade all other groups outside one's own culture. Some sociologists, such as Lawrence Bobo and Vincent Hutchings, say the origin of ethnic stratification lies in individual dispositions of ethnic prejudice, which relates to the theory of ethnocentrism. Continuing with Noel's theory, some degree of differential power must be present for the emergence of ethnic stratification. In other words, an inequality of power among ethnic groups means \\"they are of such unequal power that one is able to impose its will upon another\\". In addition to differential power, a degree of competition structured along ethnic lines is a prerequisite to ethnic stratification as well. The different ethnic groups must be competing for some common goal, such as power or influence, or a material interest, such as wealth or territory. Lawrence Bobo and Vincent Hutchings propose that competition is driven by self-interest and hostility, and results in inevitable stratification and conflict. * \\"Constructivism\\" sees both primordialist and perennialist views as basically flawed, and rejects the notion of ethnicity as a basic human condition. It holds that ethnic groups are only products of human social interaction, maintained only in so far as they are maintained as valid social constructs in societies. ** \\"Modernist constructivism\\" correlates the emergence of ethnicity with the movement towards nation states beginning in the early modern period. Proponents of this theory, such as Eric Hobsbawm, argue that ethnicity and notions of ethnic pride, such as nationalism, are purely modern inventions, appearing only in the modern period of world history. They hold that prior to this, ethnic homogeneity was not considered an ideal or necessary factor in the forging of large-scale societies. Ethnicity is an important means by which people may identify with a larger group. Many social scientists, such as anthropologists Fredrik Barth and Eric Wolf, do not consider ethnic identity to be universal. They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups.Fredrik Barth, ed. 1969 Ethnic Groups and Boundaries: The Social Organization of Cultural Difference; Eric Wolf 1982 Europe and the People Without History p. 381 Processes that result in the emergence of such identification are called ethnogenesis. Members of an ethnic group, on the whole, claim cultural continuities over time, although historians and cultural anthropologists have documented that many of the values, practices, and norms that imply continuity with the past are of relatively recent invention.Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983), The Invention of Tradition, Sider 1993 Lumbee Indian Histories. Ethnic groups differ from other social groups, such as subcultures, interest groups or social classes, because they emerge and change over historical periods (centuries) in a process known as ethnogenesis, a period of several generations of endogamy resulting in common ancestry (which is then sometimes cast in terms of a mythological narrative of a founding figure); ethnic identity is reinforced by reference to \\"boundary markers\\" ‚Äì characteristics said to be unique to the group which set it apart from other groups.Camoroff, John L. and Jean Camoroff 2009: Ethnicity Inc.. Chicago: Chicago Press.The Invention of Tradition, Sider 1993 Lumbee Indian HistoriesSeidner,(1982), Ethnicity, Language, and Power from a Psycholinguistic Perspective, pp.2‚Äì3Smith 1987 pp.21‚Äì22 =Ethnicity theory in the United States= Ethnicity theory says that race is a social category and is but one of several factors in determining ethnicity. Some other criteria include: \\"religion, language, 'customs,' nationality, and political identification\\". This theory was put forth by sociologist Robert E. Park in the 1920s. It is based on the notion of ‚Äúculture‚Äù. This theory was preceded by over a century where biological essentialism was the dominant paradigm on race. Biological essentialism is the belief that white European races are biologically superior and other non-white races are inherently inferior. This view arose as a way to justify slavery of Africans and genocide of the Native Americans in a society which was supposedly founded on freedom for all. This was a notion that developed slowly and came to be a preoccupation with scientists, theologians, and the public. Religious institutions asked questions about whether there had been multiple genesis's (polygenesis) and whether God had created lesser races of men. Many of the foremost scientists of the time took up the idea of racial difference. They would inadvertently find that white Europeans were superior. One method that was used as the measurement of cranial capacity. The ethnicity theory was based on the assimilation model. Park outlined his four steps to assimilation: contact, conflict, accommodation, and assimilation. Instead of explaining the marginalized status of people of color in the United States with an inherent biological inferiority, he instead said that it was a failure to assimilate into American culture that held people back. They could be equal as long as they dropped their culture which was deficient compared to white culture. Michael Omi and Howard Winant's theory of racial formation directly confronts both ethnicity theory's premises and practices. They argue in Racial Formation in the United States that ethnicity theory was exclusively based on the immigration patterns of a white ethnic population and did not account for the unique experiences of non-whites in this country. While this theory identities different stages in an immigration process‚Äì contact, conflict, struggle, and as the last and best response, assimilation‚Äì it did so only for white ethnic communities. The ethnicity paradigm neglects the ways that race can complicate a community's interactions with basic social and political structures, especially upon contact. And assimilation‚Äì shedding the particular qualities of a native culture for the purpose of blending in with a host culture‚Äì did not work for some groups as a response to racism and discrimination as it did for others. Moreover, once the legal barriers to achieving equality had been dismantled, the problem of racism became the sole responsibility of already disadvantaged communities. It was assumed that if a Black or Latino community was not 'making it' by the standards that had been set by white ethnics, it was because that community did not hold the right values or beliefs. Or they must be stubbornly resisting dominant norms because they did not want to fit in. Omi and Winant's critique of ethnicity theory explains how looking towards a cultural defect for the source of inequality ignores the \\"concrete sociopolitical dynamics within which racial phenomena operate in the U.S.\\" In other words, buying into this approach effectively strips us of our ability to critically examine the more structural components of racism and encourages, instead, a ‚Äúbenign neglect‚Äù of social inequality. Ethnicity and nationality In some cases, especially involving transnational migration or colonial expansion, ethnicity is linked to nationality. Anthropologists and historians, following the modernist understanding of ethnicity as proposed by Ernest GellnerGellner 2006 Nations and Nationalism Blackwell Publishing and Benedict AndersonAnderson 2006 Imagined Communities Version see nations and nationalism as developing with the rise of the modern state system in the 17th century. They culminated in the rise of \\"nation-states\\" in which the presumptive boundaries of the nation coincided (or ideally coincided) with state boundaries. Thus, in the West, the notion of ethnicity, like race and nation, developed in the context of European colonial expansion, when mercantilism and capitalism were promoting global movements of populations at the same time that state boundaries were being more clearly and rigidly defined. In the 19th century, modern states generally sought legitimacy through their claim to represent \\"nations.\\" Nation-states, however, invariably include populations that have been excluded from national life for one reason or another. Members of excluded groups, consequently, will either demand inclusion based on equality or seek autonomy, sometimes even to the extent of complete political separation in their nation-state.Walter Pohl, \\"Conceptions of Ethnicity in Early Medieval Studies\\", Debating the Middle Ages: Issues and Readings, ed. Lester K. Little and Barbara H. Rosenwein, (Blackwell), 1998, pp13‚Äì24, notes that historians have projected the 19th-century conceptions of the nation-state backward in time, employing biological metaphors of birth and growth: \\"that the peoples in the Migration Period had little to do with those heroic (or sometimes brutish) clich√©s is now generally accepted among historians,\\" he remarked. Early medieval peoples were far less homogeneous than often thought, and Pohl follows Reinhard Wenskus, Stammesbildung und Verfassung. (Cologne and Graz) 1961, whose researches into the \\"ethnogenesis\\" of the German peoples convinced him that the idea of common origin, as expressed by Isidore of Seville Gens est multitudo ab uno principio orta (\\"a people is a multitude stemming from one origin\\") which continues in the original Etymologiae IX.2.i) \\"sive ab Alia national Secundum program collection distinct (\\"or distinguished from another people by its properties\\") was a myth. Under these conditions‚Äì when people moved from one state to another,Aihway Ong 1996 \\"Cultural Citizenship in the Making\\" in Current Anthropology 37(5) or one state conquered or colonized peoples beyond its national boundaries‚Äì ethnic groups were formed by people who identified with one nation, but lived in another state. Multi-ethnic states can be the result of two opposite events, either the recent creation of state borders at variance with traditional tribal territories, or the recent immigration of ethnic minorities into a former nation-state. Examples for the first case are found throughout Africa, where countries created during decolonization inherited arbitrary colonial borders, but also in European countries such as Belgium or United Kingdom. Examples for the second case are countries such as Netherlands, which were relatively ethnically homogeneous when they attained statehood but have received significant immigration during the second half of the 20th century. States such as the United Kingdom, France and Switzerland comprised distinct ethnic groups from their formation and have likewise experienced substantial immigration, resulting in what has been termed \\"multicultural\\" societies, especially in large cities. The states of the New World were multi-ethnic from the onset, as they were formed as colonies imposed on existing indigenous populations. In recent decades feminist scholars (most notably Nira Yuval-Davis)Nira Yuval-Davis, \\"Gender & Nation\\" (London: SAGE Publications Ltd, 1997) have drawn attention to the fundamental ways in which women participate in the creation and reproduction of ethnic and national categories. Though these categories are usually discussed as belonging to the public, political sphere, they are upheld within the private, family sphere to a great extent.Nira Yuval-Davis, \\"Gender & Nation\\" (London: SAGE Publications Ltd, 1997) pp. 12-13 It is here that women act not just as biological reproducers but also as 'cultural carriers', transmitting knowledge and enforcing behaviors that belong to a specific collectivity.Floya Anthias and Nira Yuval-Davis \\"Woman‚ÄìNation-State\\" (London: Macmillan, 1989), p. 9 Women also often play a significant symbolic role in conceptions of nation or ethnicity, for example in the notion that 'women and children' constitute the kernel of a nation which must be defended in times of conflict, or in iconic figures such as Britannia or Marianne. Ethnicity and race The racial diversity of Asia's ethnic groups, Nordisk familjebok (1904) Ethnicity is used as a matter of cultural identity of a group, often based on shared ancestry, language, and cultural traditions, while race is applied as a taxonomic grouping, based on physical or biological similarities within groups. Race is a more controversial subject than ethnicity, due to common political use of the term. Ram√≥n Grosfoguel (University of California, Berkeley) argues that 'racial/ethnic identity' is one concept and that concepts of race and ethnicity cannot be used as separate and autonomous categories. Before Weber (1864-1920), race and ethnicity were primarily seen as two aspects of the same thing. Around 1900 and before, the primordialist understanding of ethnicity predominated: cultural differences between peoples were seen as being the result of inherited traits and tendencies.Banton, Michael. (2007) \\"Weber on Ethnic Communities: A critique\\", Nations and Nationalism 13 (1), 2007, 19‚Äì35. With Weber's introduction of the idea of ethnicity as a social construct, race and ethnicity became more divided from each other. In 1950 the UNESCO statement, \\"The Race Question\\", signed by some of the internationally renowned scholars of the time (including Ashley Montagu, Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Gunnar Myrdal, Julian Huxley, etc.), stated: > \\"National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cultural groups do not > necessarily coincide with racial groups: and the cultural traits of such > groups have no demonstrated genetic connection with racial traits. Because > serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term 'race' is > used in popular parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to > drop the term 'race' altogether and speak of 'ethnic groups'.\\"A. Metraux > (1950) \\"United Nations Economic and Security Council Statement by Experts on > Problems of Race\\", American Anthropologist 53(1): 142-145) In 1982 anthropologist David Craig Griffith summed up forty years of ethnographic research, arguing that racial and ethnic categories are symbolic markers for different ways that people from different parts of the world have been incorporated into a global economy: According to Wolf, racial categories were constructed and incorporated during the period of European mercantile expansion, and ethnic groupings during the period of capitalist expansion.Eric Wolf, 1982, Europe and the People Without History, Berkeley: University of California Press. 380-381 Writing in 1977 about the usage of the term \\"ethnic\\" in the ordinary language of Great Britain and the United States, Wallman noted that In the U.S., the OMB states the definition of race as used for the purposes of the US Census is not \\"scientific or anthropological\\" and takes into account \\"social and cultural characteristics as well as ancestry\\", using \\"appropriate scientific methodologies\\" that are not \\"primarily biological or genetic in reference\\". Ethno-national conflict Sometimes ethnic groups are subject to prejudicial attitudes and actions by the state or its constituents. In the 20th century, people began to argue that conflicts among ethnic groups or between members of an ethnic group and the state can and should be resolved in one of two ways. Some, like J√ºrgen Habermas and Bruce Barry, have argued that the legitimacy of modern states must be based on a notion of political rights of autonomous individual subjects. According to this view, the state should not acknowledge ethnic, national or racial identity but rather instead enforce political and legal equality of all individuals. Others, like Charles Taylor and Will Kymlicka, argue that the notion of the autonomous individual is itself a cultural construct. According to this view, states must recognize ethnic identity and develop processes through which the particular needs of ethnic groups can be accommodated within the boundaries of the nation-state. The 19th century saw the development of the political ideology of ethnic nationalism, when the concept of race was tied to nationalism, first by German theorists including Johann Gottfried von Herder. Instances of societies focusing on ethnic ties, arguably to the exclusion of history or historical context, have resulted in the justification of nationalist goals. Two periods frequently cited as examples of this are the 19th-century consolidation and expansion of the German Empire and the 20th century Nazi Germany. Each promoted the pan-ethnic idea that these governments were only acquiring lands that had always been inhabited by ethnic Germans. The history of late-comers to the nation-state model, such as those arising in the Near East and south- eastern Europe out of the dissolution of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires, as well as those arising out of the former USSR, is marked by inter- ethnic conflicts. Such conflicts usually occur within multi-ethnic states, as opposed to between them, as in other regions of the world. Thus, the conflicts are often misleadingly labeled and characterized as civil wars when they are inter-ethnic conflicts in a multi-ethnic state. Ethnic groups by continent =Africa= Ethnic groups in Africa number in the hundreds, each generally having its own language (or dialect of a language) and culture. Many ethnic groups and nations of Africa qualify, although some groups are of a size larger than a tribal society. These mostly originate with the Sahelian kingdoms of the medieval period, such as that of the Akan, deriving from Bonoman (11th century) then the Kingdom of Ashanti (17th century). Wickens, Gerald E; Lowe, Pat (2008). =Asia= Assyrians are the indigenous peoples of Northern Iraq. Ethnic groups are abundant throughout Asia, with adaptations to the climate zones of Asia, which can be the Arctic, subarctic, temperate, subtropical or tropical. The ethnic groups have adapted to mountains, deserts, grasslands, and forests. On the coasts of Asia, the ethnic groups have adopted various methods of harvest and transport. Some groups are primarily hunter-gatherers, some practice transhumance (nomadic lifestyle), others have been agrarian/rural for millennia and others becoming industrial/urban. Some groups/countries of Asia are completely urban, such as those in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore. The colonization of Asia was largely ended in the 20th century, with national drives for independence and self-determination across the continent. =Europe= Basque people constitute an indigenous ethnic minority in both France and Spain. S√°mi family in Lapland of Finland, 1936. The Irish are an ethnic group indigenous to Ireland of which 70-80 million people worldwide claim ancestry. Europe has a large number of ethnic groups; Pan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct \\"peoples of Europe\\", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities within every state they inhabit (although they may form local regional majorities within a sub- national entity). The total number of national minority populations in Europe is estimated at 105 million people or 14% of 770 million Europeans.Christoph Pan, Beate Sibylle Pfeil, Minderheitenrechte in Europa.

Equivalently, a solvable group is a group whose derived series terminates in the trivial subgroup.  Motivation  Historically, the word \\"solvable\\" arose from Galois theory and the proof of the general unsolvability of quintic equation. Specifically, a polynomial equation is solvable in radicals if and only if the corresponding Galois group is solvable (note this theorem holds only in characteristic 0). This means associated to a polynomial f \\\\in F[x] there is a tower of field extensions > F = F_0 \\\\subset F_1 \\\\subset F_2 \\\\subset \\\\cdots \\\\subset F_m=K such that # F_i = F_{i-1}[\\\\alpha_i] where \\\\alpha_i^{m_i} \\\\in F_{i-1}, so \\\\alpha_i is a solution to the equation x^{m_i} - a where a \\\\in F_{i-1} # F_m contains a splitting field for f(x) = Example = For example, the smallest Galois field extension of \\\\mathbb{Q} containing the element > a = \\\\sqrt[5]{\\\\sqrt{2} + \\\\sqrt{3}} gives a solvable group. It has associated field extensions > \\\\mathbb{Q} \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{2}, \\\\sqrt{3}) \\\\subset > \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{2}, \\\\sqrt{3})\\\\left(e^{2\\\\pi i/ 5}\\\\sqrt[5]{\\\\sqrt{2} + > \\\\sqrt{3}}\\\\right) giving a solvable group containing \\\\mathbb{Z}/5 (acting on the e^{2\\\\pi i/5}) and \\\\mathbb{Z}/2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}/2 (acting on \\\\sqrt{2} + \\\\sqrt{3}). Definition A group G is called solvable if it has a subnormal series whose factor groups (quotient groups) are all abelian, that is, if there are subgroups 1 = G0 < G1 < ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ < Gk = G such that Gj‚àí1 is normal in Gj, and Gj /Gj‚àí1 is an abelian group, for j = 1, 2, ‚Ä¶, k. Or equivalently, if its derived series, the descending normal series :G\\\\triangleright G^{(1)}\\\\triangleright G^{(2)} \\\\triangleright \\\\cdots, where every subgroup is the commutator subgroup of the previous one, eventually reaches the trivial subgroup of G. These two definitions are equivalent, since for every group H and every normal subgroup N of H, the quotient H/N is abelian if and only if N includes the commutator subgroup of H. The least n such that G(n) = 1 is called the derived length of the solvable group G. For finite groups, an equivalent definition is that a solvable group is a group with a composition series all of whose factors are cyclic groups of prime order. This is equivalent because a finite group has finite composition length, and every simple abelian group is cyclic of prime order. The Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder theorem guarantees that if one composition series has this property, then all composition series will have this property as well. For the Galois group of a polynomial, these cyclic groups correspond to nth roots (radicals) over some field. The equivalence does not necessarily hold for infinite groups: for example, since every nontrivial subgroup of the group Z of integers under addition is isomorphic to Z itself, it has no composition series, but the normal series {0, Z}, with its only factor group isomorphic to Z, proves that it is in fact solvable.  Examples  = Abelian groups = The basic example of solvable groups are abelian groups. They are trivially solvable since a subnormal series being given by just the group itself and the trivial group. But non-abelian groups may or may not be solvable. = Nilpotent groups = More generally, all nilpotent groups are solvable. In particular, finite p-groups are solvable, as all finite p-groups are nilpotent.  Quaternion groups  In particular, the quaternion group is a solvable group given by the group extension > 1 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z}/4 \\\\to Q \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z}/2 \\\\to 1 where \\\\mathbb{Z}/4 is the subgroup generated by i. = Group extensions = Group extensions form the prototypical examples of solvable groups. That is, if G and G' are solvable groups, then any extension > 1 \\\\to G \\\\to G \\\\to G' \\\\to 1 defines a solvable group G. In fact, all solvable groups can be formed from such group extensions. = Nonabelian group which is non-nilpotent = A small example of a solvable, non-nilpotent group is the symmetric group S3. In fact, as the smallest simple non-abelian group is A5, (the alternating group of degree 5) it follows that every group with order less than 60 is solvable. = Finite groups of odd order = The celebrated Feit‚ÄìThompson theorem states that every finite group of odd order is solvable. In particular this implies that if a finite group is simple, it is either a prime cyclic or of even order. = Non-example = The group S5 is not solvable -- it has a composition series {E, A5, S5} (and the Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder theorem states that every other composition series is equivalent to that one), giving factor groups isomorphic to A5 and C2; and A5 is not abelian. Generalizing this argument, coupled with the fact that An is a normal, maximal, non-abelian simple subgroup of Sn for n > 4, we see that Sn is not solvable for n > 4. This is a key step in the proof that for every n > 4 there are polynomials of degree n which are not solvable by radicals (Abel‚ÄìRuffini theorem). This property is also used in complexity theory in the proof of Barrington's theorem. = Subgroups of GL2 = Consider the subgroups > B = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} * & *  0 & * \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\text{, > } U = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & *  0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} of > GL_2(\\\\mathbb{F}) for some field \\\\mathbb{F}. Then, the group quotient B/U can be found by taking arbitrary elements in B,U, multiplying them together, and figuring out what structure this gives. So > \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & b  0 & c \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\cdot \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & d >  0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & ad + b  0 & c \\\\end{bmatrix} Note the determinant condition on GL_2 implies ac eq 0 , hence \\\\mathbb{F}^\\\\times \\\\times \\\\mathbb{F}^\\\\times \\\\subset B is a subgroup (which are the matrices where b=0 ). For fixed a,b , the linear equation ad + b = 0 implies d = -b/a , which is an arbitrary element in \\\\mathbb{F} since b \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F} . Since we can take any matrix in B and multiply it by the matrix > \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & d  0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} with d = -b/a , we can get a diagonal matrix in B . This shows the quotient group B/U \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{F}^\\\\times \\\\times \\\\mathbb{F}^\\\\times.  Remark  Notice that this description gives the decomposition of B as \\\\mathbb{F} \\\\rtimes (\\\\mathbb{F}^\\\\times \\\\times \\\\mathbb{F}^\\\\times) where (a,c) acts on b by (a,c)(b) = ab . This implies (a,c)(b + b') = (a,c)(b) + (a,c)(b') = ab + ab' . Also, a matrix of the form > \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & b  0 & c \\\\end{bmatrix} corresponds to the element (b) \\\\times (a,c) in the group. = Borel subgroups = For a linear algebraic group G its Borel subgroup is defined as a subgroup which is closed, connected, and solvable in G, and it is the maximal possible subgroup with these properties (note the second two are topological properties). For example, in GL_n and SL_n the group of upper-triangular, or lower-triangular matrices are two of the Borel subgroups. The example given above, the subgroup B in GL_2 is the Borel subgroup.  Borel subgroup in GL3  In GL_3 there are the subgroups > B = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} * & * & *  0 & * & *  0 & 0 & * > \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, \\\\textU_1 = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & * & * >  0 & 1 & *  0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} Notice B/U_1 \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{F}^\\\\times \\\\times \\\\mathbb{F}^\\\\times \\\\times \\\\mathbb{F}^\\\\times, hence the Borel group has the form > U\\\\rtimes (\\\\mathbb{F}^\\\\times \\\\times \\\\mathbb{F}^\\\\times \\\\times > \\\\mathbb{F}^\\\\times)  Borel subgroup in product of simple linear algebraic groups  In the product group GL_n \\\\times GL_m the Borel subgroup can be represented by matrices of the form > \\\\begin{bmatrix} T & 0  0 & S \\\\end{bmatrix} where T is an n\\\\times n upper triangular matrix and S is a m\\\\times m upper triangular matrix. = Z-groups = Any finite group whose p-Sylow subgroups are cyclic is a semidirect product of two cyclic groups, in particular solvable. Such groups are called Z-groups.  OEIS values  Numbers of solvable groups with order n are (start with n = 0) :0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 14, 1, 5, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 15, 2, 2, 5, 4, 1, 4, 1, 51, 1, 2, 1, 14, 1, 2, 2, 14, 1, 6, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 52, 2, 5, 1, 5, 1, 15, 2, 13, 2, 2, 1, 12, 1, 2, 4, 267, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 50, ... Orders of non-solvable groups are :60, 120, 168, 180, 240, 300, 336, 360, 420, 480, 504, 540, 600, 660, 672, 720, 780, 840, 900, 960, 1008, 1020, 1080, 1092, 1140, 1176, 1200, 1260, 1320, 1344, 1380, 1440, 1500, ...  Properties  Solvability is closed under a number of operations. * If G is solvable, and H is a subgroup of G, then H is solvable.Rotman (1995), * If G is solvable, and there is a homomorphism from G onto H, then H is solvable; equivalently (by the first isomorphism theorem), if G is solvable, and N is a normal subgroup of G, then G/N is solvable.Rotman (1995), * The previous properties can be expanded into the following \\"three for the price of two\\" property: G is solvable if and only if both N and G/N are solvable. * In particular, if G and H are solvable, the direct product G √ó H is solvable. Solvability is closed under group extension: * If H and G/H are solvable, then so is G; in particular, if N and H are solvable, their semidirect product is also solvable. It is also closed under wreath product: * If G and H are solvable, and X is a G-set, then the wreath product of G and H with respect to X is also solvable. For any positive integer N, the solvable groups of derived length at most N form a subvariety of the variety of groups, as they are closed under the taking of homomorphic images, subalgebras, and (direct) products. The direct product of a sequence of solvable groups with unbounded derived length is not solvable, so the class of all solvable groups is not a variety. Burnside's theorem Burnside's theorem states that if G is a finite group of order paqb where p and q are prime numbers, and a and b are non-negative integers, then G is solvable. Related concepts =Supersolvable groups= As a strengthening of solvability, a group G is called supersolvable (or supersoluble) if it has an invariant normal series whose factors are all cyclic. Since a normal series has finite length by definition, uncountable groups are not supersolvable. In fact, all supersolvable groups are finitely generated, and an abelian group is supersolvable if and only if it is finitely generated. The alternating group A4 is an example of a finite solvable group that is not supersolvable. If we restrict ourselves to finitely generated groups, we can consider the following arrangement of classes of groups: :cyclic < abelian < nilpotent < supersolvable < polycyclic < solvable < finitely generated group. =Virtually solvable groups= A group G is called virtually solvable if it has a solvable subgroup of finite index. This is similar to virtually abelian. Clearly all solvable groups are virtually solvable, since one can just choose the group itself, which has index 1. =Hypoabelian= A solvable group is one whose derived series reaches the trivial subgroup at a finite stage. For an infinite group, the finite derived series may not stabilize, but the transfinite derived series always stabilizes. A group whose transfinite derived series reaches the trivial group is called a hypoabelian group, and every solvable group is a hypoabelian group. The first ordinal Œ± such that G(Œ±) = G(Œ±+1) is called the (transfinite) derived length of the group G, and it has been shown that every ordinal is the derived length of some group .

A red pixel shows the ant's location. Langton's ant is a two-dimensional universal Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. It was invented by Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on a square lattice of black and white cells. The universality of Langton's ant was proven in 2000. The idea has been generalized in several different ways, such as turmites which add more colors and more states. Rules Animation of first 200 steps of Langton's ant Squares on a plane are colored variously either black or white. We arbitrarily identify one square as the \\"ant\\". The ant can travel in any of the four cardinal directions at each step it takes. The \\"ant\\" moves according to the rules below: * At a white square, turn 90¬∞ clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit * At a black square, turn 90¬∞ counter-clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit Langton's ant can also be described as a cellular automaton, where the grid is colored black or white and the \\"ant\\" square has one of eight different colors assigned to encode the combination of black/white state and the current direction of motion of the ant. Modes of behavior These simple rules lead to complex behavior. Three distinct modes of behavior are apparent, when starting on a completely white grid. #Simplicity. During the first few hundred moves it creates very simple patterns which are often symmetric. #Chaos. After a few hundred moves, a large, irregular pattern of black and white squares appears. The ant traces a pseudo-random path until around 10,000 steps. #Emergent order. Finally the ant starts building a recurrent \\"highway\\" pattern of 104 steps that repeats indefinitely. All finite initial configurations tested eventually converge to the same repetitive pattern, suggesting that the \\"highway\\" is an attractor of Langton's ant, but no one has been able to prove that this is true for all such initial configurations. It is only known that the ant's trajectory is always unbounded regardless of the initial configuration ‚Äì this is known as the Cohen‚ÄìKong theorem. Universality In 2000, Gajardo et al. showed a construction that calculates any boolean circuit using the trajectory of a single instance of Langton's ant. Additionally, it would be possible to simulate an arbitrary Turing machine using the ant's trajectory for computation. This means that the ant is capable of universal computation. Extension to multiple colors Greg Turk and Jim Propp considered a simple extension to Langton's ant where instead of just two colors, more colors are used. The colors are modified in a cyclic fashion. A simple naming scheme is used: for each of the successive colors, a letter \\"L\\" or \\"R\\" is used to indicate whether a left or right turn should be taken. Langton's ant has the name \\"RL\\" in this naming scheme. Some of these extended Langton's ants produce patterns that become symmetric over and over again. One of the simplest examples is the ant \\"RLLR\\". One sufficient condition for this to happen is that the ant's name, seen as a cyclic list, consists of consecutive pairs of identical letters \\"LL\\" or \\"RR\\". (the term \\"cyclic list\\" indicates that the last letter may pair with the first one) The proof involves Truchet tiles. Image:LangtonsAnt-nColor_RLR_13937.pngRLR: Grows chaotically.

Extension to multiple states A further extension of Langton's ants is to consider multiple states of the Turing machine ‚Äì as if the ant itself has a color that can change. These ants are called turmites, a contraction of \\"Turing machine termites\\". Common behaviours include the production of highways, chaotic growth and spiral growth..

File:Turmite-181181121010-10211.pngConstructing a Fibonacci spiral. Extension to multiple ants Multiple Langton's ants can co-exist on the 2D plane, and their interactions give rise to complex, higher-order automata that collectively build a wide variety of organized structures. There is no need for conflict resolution, as every ant sitting on the same square wants to make the same change to the tape. There is a YouTube video showing these multiple ant interactions. Multiple turmites can co-exist on the 2D plane as long as there is a rule for what happens when they meet. Ed Pegg, Jr. considered ants that can turn for example both left and right, splitting in two and annihilating each other when they meet..

The Acle Straight is a turnpike road connecting Acle to Great Yarmouth. It opened in 1831. Acle railway station, which was built in 1883, lies on the Wherry Line from Norwich to Great Yarmouth. In 1892 a foundry was constructed that specialised in building windpumps for land drainage, including the very last windpump built for the Broads, at Ash Tree Farm. The three-mile (5 km) ¬£7.1m dual-carriageway A47 bypass opened in March 1989; local campaigners are still pressing for the dualling of the Acle Straight, the portion of the A47 running from Acle to Great Yarmouth, which has a relatively high accident rate. Since the turn of the century, a walkway running from the station to the Boat Dyke has been constructed by local volunteers; this walk (known as Damgate) offers an opportunity to view indigenous flora, some of which are rare. Also on the Damgate walk, there have been repeated sightings of a kingfisher, locally known as Henry, which is said to fly under the abandoned railway bridge around mid afternoon. Parish church of St Edmund St Edmund's Church, Acle The church of St Edmund is one of 124 existing round-tower churches in Norfolk. The round stage of the tower is the oldest part of the church, thought to be Saxon in origin and of a date between 850 and 950 AD. The octagonal stage was added in the 13th century, probably when the roof was raised. The battlements are from 1472. The tower houses six bells, five of which were cast in Norwich and date from 1623. The tower is reinforced with a metal frame to enable the bells to be rung safely. Entry to the church is by a porch on the north side, built in 1495. The dressed flints are in contrast with most of the walls which appear to be made of rubble. The main body of the church, the nave, is thought on the evidence of the measurements and wall thickness to be Norman in origin. This is not immediately obvious as no Norman doorways or arches remain. In 1927, when ivy was being stripped from the outside walls, one of the buttresses collapsed revealing a find of Norman-worked stones, which were later reassembled for safekeeping in the roof stair space. It is probable that all the Norman doors and archways were demolished when the floor level was raised, perhaps to prevent flooding, in the 13th century. It is reasonable to assume that at least the foundations of the nave are Norman. The main nave windows are 14th- century, and one near the pulpit is Tudor. The walls were probably painted at one time ‚Äì a very small fragment of a dragon or a serpent-like creature still exists on the wall of the old rood staircase. The stone font in the nave is dated 1410. A 15th-century wooden screen separates the nave from the chancel. It was not made for Acle church, and may have been brought from St Benet's Abbey or the Augustinian priory at Weybridge. The 14th-century chancel probably replaced an apse; the windows are of 14th-century design apart from the east window which holds Victorian stained glass.The Parish Church of St Edmund, Acle, Norfolk - A Brief Guide for Visitors See also *Nowhere References External links *Acle Village Website *Information from Genuki Norfolk on Acle. *Website with photos of Acle St Edmund, a round-tower church *Acle windmills from the Norfolkmills website * Category:Towns in Norfolk Category:Market towns in Norfolk Category:Civil parishes in Norfolk Category:Broadland ","title":"Acle"},{"id":"105022","title":"Larry David"},{"id":"105028","text":"Upton is a village on the River Bure in Norfolk, England within the Broads national park.

It is the seat of the Municipality of Kranjska Gora. Name Kranjska Gora was first mentioned in written sources in 1326 as Chrainow (and as Chrainau and Chrainaw in 1363, as Cranaw and Chranaw in 1390, and as Kraynaw in 1456‚Äì61, among other names). The Slovene name Kranjska Gora is a reworking of the German name, influenced by German Krainberg 'Karawanks'. The settlement was also called Borovska vas (or Borovska ves or Borov≈°ka vesKrajevni leksikon Dravske Banovine. 1937. Ljubljana: Zveza za tujski promet za Slovenijo, p. 540.) in Slovene in the past. History Kranjska Gora is believed to have been settled in the 11th century by Slovenes from Carantania. It was a fief of the Counts of Ortenburg in the 12th century. A trade route to Tarvisio already led through the town in the 14th century. In 1431 the Counts of Celje built a castle at Villa Bassa (now part of Tarvisio), which belonged to the town until 1848. Kranjska Gora came under Ottoman attack in 1476. A railroad connection was built to Kranjska Gora in 1870. During the First World War, in 1916, Russian prisoners of war built a wooden chapel above the settlement commemorating their comrades killed in an avalanche while building a road over the Vr≈°iƒç Pass. There is a small cemetery nearby.http://www.slovenia.info/si/kapelica/Vr%C5%A1i%C4%8D,-Ruska- kapelica.htm?kapelica=137&lng;=1 Commemorations take place at the chapel every year. =Mass grave= Mass grave site A mass grave from the end of the Second World War is found in the eastern part of the town. The Savsko Naselje Mass Grave (), also known as the Ru≈°ar Meadow Mass Grave (), contains the remains of up to 35 German soldiers killed in an engagement with the Partisans in May 1945. =Postwar period= Tourism developed further in Kranjska Gora after the Second World War. Various ski lifts were built on Mount Vitranc west of the town in 1949, 1962, 1964, and 1965, and a freight cableway was installed in 1958. Church The Counts of Ortenburg established a church dedicated to Our Lady on the White Gravel () in the 14th century, referring to the bank of the Pi≈°nica River, which has since changed course. The current church, dedicated to the Assumption of Mary, is late Gothic in style and has typical Carinthian rib vaulting. It contains two sculptures from the second half of the 15th century and paintings by Leopold Layer (1752‚Äì1828). Recreation Kranjska Gora is best known as a winter sports town, being situated in the Julian Alps. It annually hosts an event in the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup series, also known as the Vitranc Cup, for the slalom and giant slalom events. The well-known ski jumping hill Planica is located in the nearby Tamar Valley.

Starting with the music as a hobby in the late 90s and at the early age of 13 he became an enthusiast of the dance music genre of the moment, and passed to be a mere follower to become a producer even before starting his career as a DJ. HistoryDeejay Magazine. Reportaje: D-Mark. 2008. =The first years= D-Mark begun in the field of the music production using a tracker production software. He led a now disappeared project called Vanian-UT to spread all of these tracks made with that software across all the Spanish territory. In 2002, Vanian-UT was known in Spain as a young producers' collective with a lot of talent, that also focused on DJing, something that caught the attention of D-Mark as well. This year, Vanian-UT released with D-Mark mixes a set of CDs for the magazine Solo Tuning. =2003‚Äì2008= Year 2003 was a new begin for D-Mark. Focused on his DJ side and with the Vanian-UT project running at its top, the collective begun to perform their music on several clubs and events in the zone, like regular parties at Future Club in Barcelona or the event Trancenight Summer Party at Girona in 2004. 2005 was a year of changes. As new systems and computer production software became more affordable to everyone and the record deals were increasing into its members Vanian-UT was about to close, what took D-Mark to initiate and lead a new record label project called DanceDP Recordings. This idea was set up this year, but it would not come to light until the end of 2006. Meanwhile, D-Mark took his first appearance outside the zone of Catalunya, Spain, and moved to Madrid to perform a gig alongside DJ Precision and Menno de Jong, together with his friends and artists Shammu, DJ Row and the resident DJ at Future Club in Barcelona Pllo Future. 2006 and 2007 were, without a doubt, the most active at the DJ and musical career of D-Mark. During this time, he carried his music through all the Spanish territory in the cities of Ibiza, Barcelona, Madrid or Valladolid, and the countries of Norway, England and Slovenia and performing together with some of the most influenced DJs of the dance scene at these years, like Above & Beyond, Lemon & Einar K or Inkfish. In 2006 he made his debut abroad, in a Ministry of Sound event at Sentrum Scene in the city of Oslo, Norway. These years were also when D-Mark set the opening of his new record label project DanceDP Recordings. The first release of the record label and the first appearance of D-Mark in the music industry as well, Travelling EP, became unexpectedly a success: 10 weeks in a row at the top positions of the Technics/IDP/DMC Dutch Dance Charts and full reviews on the Spanish magazines Deejay and DJ1, that finally ended with the DJ Oner award No. 1 Spanish trance release and the appearance of Project Norway in the album of Dave Pearce Delirium on the label Ministry of Sound. In 2007 and 2008 D-Mark teamed up with who would be now his best friend in the music field and his studio and DJ partner G-Sus. They two together released several remixes for artists like Tragida and Der Mystik, and their hit La Lamida del Gato Negro produced in 2008 and released in 2009 got the unexpected support of the world's top DJ Paul van Dyk. 2008 is also the starting year of D-Mark's monthly radio/podcast project DanceDP Radio. The project begun with the appearances and the support of Ra√∫l CC and David Amante the first year, until David left his music career. G-Sus joined the team in 2010, where he is currently an active part of the show. =2009‚Äìpresent= 2009 and 2010 were two difficult years to the personal life of D-Mark that forced him to stop the recording of his already announced album debut Driving Nowhere and to leave momentarily his musical activity, that was also affecting his record label. The album was finally discarded due to the crisis that is lately passing through the music industry, especially in Spain, and the world's economy. However, this did not stop D-Mark and G-Sus in 2009 to organize and perform a special event in Pineda de Mar, which was the one who had the biggest attendance for them of all the times in Spain, 5500 attendees. 2011 is the year, as he said, of the coming back, with a new EP release and an amateur official videoclip made for what is his favourite city, Barcelona.

He was twice a Guggenheim fellow (1956‚Äì57 and 1963‚Äì64) and also was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1980. He is well known for his 1960 Doomsday equation formula published in Science predicting future population growth. As a polymath, he wrote nearly two hundred professional papers, gaining renown in fields from computer science and artificial intelligence to epistemology, and researched high-speed electronics and electro-optics switching devices as a physicist, and in biophysics, the study of memory and knowledge. He worked on cognition based on neurophysiology, mathematics, and philosophy and was called \\"one of the most consequential thinkers in the history of cybernetics\\". He came to the United States, and stayed after meeting with Warren Sturgis McCulloch, where he received funding from The Pentagon to establish the Biological Computer Laboratory, which built the first parallel computer, the Numa-Rete.Jamie Hutchinson. Von Foerster made Illinois a cybernetics \\"nerve center\\" Ingenuity newsletter, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, May 2004 Working with William Ross Ashby, one of the original Ratio Club members, and together with Warren McCulloch, Norbert Wiener, John von Neumann and Lawrence J. Fogel, Heinz von Foerster was an architect of cybernetics and one of the members of the Macy conferences, eventually becoming editor of its early proceedings alongside Hans-Lukas Teuber and Margaret Mead.Biography of Heinz von Foerster 2002 Biography Von Foerster was born in 1911 in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, as Heinz von F√∂rster. His paternal grandfather was Austrian architect Emil Ritter von Foerster. His maternal grandmother was Marie Lang, an Austrian feminist, theosophist and publisher. He studied physics at the Technical University of Vienna and at the University of Breslau, where in 1944 he received a Ph.D. in physics. His relatives included Ludwig Wittgenstein, Erwin Lang and Hugo von Hofmannsthal. Ludwig F√∂rster was his great-grandfather. His Jewish roots didn't cause him much troubles while he worked in radar laboratories during the Nazi era, as \\"he hid his ancestry with the help of an employer who chose not to press him for documents on his family.\\"John Markoff, \\"Heinz von Foerster, 90, Dies; Was Information Theorist\\", November 9, 2002, The New York Times He moved to the US in 1949, and worked at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, where he was a professor of electrical engineering from 1951‚Äì1975. He also was professor of biophysics (1962‚Äì1975) and Director of the Biological Computer Laboratory (1958‚Äì1975). Additionally, in 1956‚Äì57 and 1963‚Äì64 he was a Guggenheim Fellow and also President of the Wenner-Gren-Foundation for anthropological research from 1963‚Äì1965. He knew well and was in conversation with John von Neumann, Norbert Wiener, Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela, Gordon Pask, Gregory Bateson, Lawrence J. Fogel and Margaret Mead, among many others. He influenced generations of students as a teacher and inclusive, enthusiastic collaborator. Work Von Foerster was influenced by the Vienna Circle and Ludwig Wittgenstein. He worked in the field of cybernetics and is known as the inventor of second-order cybernetics. He made important contributions to constructivism.Segal, L. The Dream of Reality: Heinz Von Foerster's Constructivism, Springer, 2001. He is also known for his interest in computer music and magic. =The electron tube laboratory= In 1949, von Foerster started work at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign at the electron tube laboratory of the Electrical Engineering Department, where he succeeded Joseph Tykoci≈Ñski-Tykociner. With his students he developed many innovative devices, including ultra-high- frequency electronicsSee for example, in Review of Scientific Instruments 25: 640‚Äì653, 1954. He also worked on mathematical models of population dynamics and in 1959 published a model now called the \\"von Foerster equation\\", which is derivable from the principles of constant aging and conservation of mass. :\\\\frac{\\\\partial n}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial n}{\\\\partial a} = - m(a)n, where: n = n(t,a), t stands for time and a for age. m(a) is the death in function of the population age; n(t,a) is the population density in function of age. When m(a) = 0, we have:Murray, J.D. Mathematical Biology: An Introduction. Third edition. Interdisciplinary Applied Mathematics. Mathematical Biology. Spring: 2002. :\\\\frac{\\\\partial n}{\\\\partial t} = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial n}{\\\\partial a} It relates that a population ages, and that fact is the only one that influences change in population density; the negative sign shows that time flows in just one direction, that there is no birth and the population is going to die out.\\"Some Remarks on Changing Populations\\" in The Kinetics of Cellular Proliferation, F. Stohlman, Jr., ed., Grune & Stratton, New York, pp. 382‚Äì407 (1959); E. Trucco, Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics 27: 285‚Äì304 and 449‚Äì471, 1965 It is therefore a transport equation; it can be solved using a characteristics method. Another way is by similarity solution; and a third is a numerical approach such as finite differences. To get the solution, the following boundary conditions should be added: : n(t,0)= \\\\int_0^\\\\infty b (a)n(t,a) \\\\, dt , which states that the initial births should be conserved (see Sharpe‚ÄìLotka‚ÄìMcKendrick's equation for otherwise), and that : n(0,a)= f(a), \\\\, which states that the initial population must be given; then it will evolve according to the partial differential equation. =Biological Computer Laboratory= In 1958, he formed the Biological Computer Lab, studying similarities in cybernetic systems in biology and electronics. =Macy conferences= He was the youngest member of the core group of the Macy conferences on Cybernetics and editor of the five volumes of Cybernetics (1949‚Äì1953), a series of conference transcripts that represent important foundational conversations in the field. It was von Foerster who suggested that Wiener's coinage \\"Cybernetics\\" be applied to this conference series, which had previously been called \\"Circular Causal and Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social Systems\\". =Doomsday equation= A 1960 issue of Science magazine included an article by von Foerster and his colleagues P. M. Mora and L. W. Amiot proposing a formula representing a best fit to available historical data on world population; the authors then predicted future population growth on the basis of this formula. The formula gave 2.7 billion as the 1960 world population and predicted that population growth would become infinite by Friday, November 13, 2026 ‚Äì von Foerster's 115th birthday anniversary ‚Äì a prediction that earned it the name \\"the Doomsday Equation.\\" Based on population data obtained from various sources, von Foerster and his students concluded that world population growth over the centuries was faster than an exponential. In such a situation, doubling-time decreases over time. Von Foerster's tongue-in-cheek prediction of Doomsday on November 13, 2026, was based on an extrapolation into the future of doubling- time, with the finding that doubling-time would decrease to zero on that date. Responders to his Doomsday prediction objected on the grounds of the finite human gestation time of 9 months, and the transparent fact that biological systems rarely persist in exponential growth for any substantial length of time. Those who knew von Foerster could see in his rejoinders an evident sense of humor.

He fatally shot three people inside the university tower. He then went to the tower's 28th-floor observation deck, where he fired at random people for some 96 minutes, killing an additional 11 people (plus an unborn child) and wounding 31 others, including a woman whose injuries prevented her pregnancy from coming to term, before he was shot dead by Austin police officers.

A.\\" Whitman Jr. Whitman's father was raised in an orphanage in Savannah, Georgia, and described himself as a self-made man. He married Margaret, then 17 years old. The marriage of Whitman's parents was marred by domestic violence; Whitman's father was an admitted authoritarian who provided for his family but demanded near perfection from all of them. He was known to physically and emotionally abuse his wife and children. As a boy, Whitman was described as a polite child who seldom lost his temper. He was extremely intelligent‚Äîan examination at the age of six revealed his IQ to be 139. Whitman's academic achievements were encouraged by his parents, and any indication of failure or a lethargic attitude were met with discipline‚Äîoften physical‚Äîfrom his father. Margaret Whitman was a devout Roman Catholic who raised her sons in the same religion. The Whitman brothers regularly attended Mass with their mother, and all three brothers served as altar boys at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church. \\"Chaplain Leduc.\\" cimedia.com. Retrieved: November 2, 2010. Whitman's father was a firearms collector and enthusiast, who taught each of his young sons to shoot, clean, and maintain weapons. He regularly took them on hunting trips, and Charles became an avid hunter and accomplished marksman. His father said of him: \\"Charlie could plug the eye out of a squirrel by the time he was sixteen.\\" Whitman joined the Boy Scouts at age 11. He became an Eagle Scout at 12 years three months, reportedly the youngest of any Eagle Scout up to that time. Whitman also became an accomplished pianist at the age of 12. At around the same time, he began an extensive newspaper route. =High school= Whitman around 1959 (age 18) On September 1, 1955, Whitman entered St. Ann's High School in West Palm Beach, where he was regarded as a moderately popular student whose intelligence was noted by his teachers and peers. By the next month, he had saved enough money from his newspaper route to purchase a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, which he used on his route. Without telling his father beforehand, Whitman enlisted in the United States Marine Corps one month after his June 1959 graduation from high school, where he had graduated seventh in a class of 72 students. Whitman told a family friend that the catalyst for his enlistment was an incident a month earlier, in which his father had beaten him and thrown him into the family swimming pool because Whitman had come home drunk. Whitman left home on July 6, having been assigned an 18-month tour of duty with the Marines at Guant√°namo Bay. His father still did not know he had enlisted. As Whitman traveled toward Parris Island, his father learned of his action and telephoned a branch of the federal government, trying to have his son's enlistment canceled. =U.S. Marine and college student= During Whitman's initial 18-month service in 1959 and 1960, he earned a sharpshooter's badge and the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal. He achieved 215 of 250 possible points on marksmanship tests, doing well when shooting rapidly over long distances as well as at moving targets. After completing his assignment, Whitman applied to a U.S. Navy and Marine Corps scholarship program, intending to complete college and become a commissioned officer. Whitman earned high scores on the required examination, and the selection committee approved his enrollment at a preparatory school in Maryland, where he completed courses in mathematics and physics before being approved to transfer to the University of Texas at Austin to study mechanical engineering. University life On September 15, 1961, Whitman entered the mechanical engineering program at the University of Texas at Austin. He was initially a poor student. His hobbies included karate, scuba diving, gambling, and hunting. Shortly after his enrollment at the university, Whitman and two friends were observed poaching a deer, with a passer-by noting his license plate number and reporting them to the police. The trio were butchering the deer in the shower at Whitman's dormitory when they were arrested. Whitman was fined $100 ($ in ) for the offense. Whitman earned a reputation as a practical joker in his years as an engineering student, but his friends also noted he made some morbid and chilling statements. On one occasion in 1962, as Whitman and a fellow student named Francis Schuck Jr. browsed in the bookstore in the main building of the University of Texas, Whitman remarked, \\"A person could stand off an army from atop of it [the tower] before they got him.\\" =Marriage= In February 1962, 20-year-old Whitman met Kathleen Frances Leissner, an education major two years his junior. Leissner was Whitman's first serious girlfriend. They courted for five months before announcing their engagement on July 19. On August 17, 1962, Whitman and Leissner were married in a Catholic ceremony held in Leissner's hometown of Needville, Texas. The couple chose the 22nd wedding anniversary of Whitman's parents as the date for their wedding. Whitman's family drove from Florida to Texas to attend the event, and his younger brother Patrick served as best man. Fr. Leduc, a Whitman family friend, presided over the ceremony. Leissner's family and friends approved of her choice of husband, describing Whitman as a \\"handsome young man\\" who was both intelligent, and aspirational. Although Whitman's grades improved somewhat during his second and third semesters, the Marines considered them insufficient for continuation of his scholarship. He was ordered to active duty in February 1963 \\"Handbook of Texas Online.\\" tshanonline.com. Retrieved: November 2, 2010. and went to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, for the remainder of his five-year enlistment. =Camp Lejeune= Whitman apparently resented his college studies being ended, although he was automatically promoted to the rank of lance corporal. At Camp Lejeune, he was hospitalized for four days \\"Deranged tower sniper rained death on UT campus.\\" Houston Chronicle. Retrieved: November 2, 2010. after single-handedly freeing another marine by lifting a Jeep which had rolled over an embankment. Despite his reputation as an exemplary Marine, he continued to gamble. In November 1963, he was court-martialed for gambling, usury, possession of a personal firearm on base, and for threatening another Marine over a $30 loan ($ in ), for which he had demanded $15 in interest. Sentenced to 30 days of confinement and 90 days of hard labor, he was demoted from lance corporal (E-3) to private (E-1). Documented stressors Whitman's journal While awaiting his court martial in 1963, Whitman began to write a diary titled Daily Record of C. J. Whitman. In it, he wrote about his daily life in the Marine Corps and his interactions with Kathy and other family members. He also wrote about his upcoming court martial and contempt for the Marine Corps, criticizing them for inefficiencies. In his writings about his wife, Whitman often praised her and expressed his longing to be with her. He also wrote about his efforts and plans to free himself from financial dependence on his father. In December 1964, Whitman was honorably discharged from the Marines. He returned to the University of Texas at Austin, enrolling in the architectural engineering program. To support his wife Kathy and himself, he worked as a bill collector for the Standard Finance Company. Later, he worked as a bank teller at the Austin National Bank. In January 1965, Whitman took a temporary job with Central Freight Lines as a traffic surveyor for the Texas Highway Department. He also volunteered as a scout leader for Austin Scout Troop 5, while his wife worked as a biology teacher at Lanier High School. Friends later said that Whitman had told them that he struck his wife on two occasions. \\"John and Fran Morgan statement\\". The Whitman Archives via Austin American-Statesman. August 2, 1966. They said that Whitman despised himself for this and confessed to being \\"mortally afraid of being like his father.\\" In his journal, Whitman lamented his actions and resolved to be a good husband and not abusive as his father had been. =Separation of Whitman's parents= In May 1966, Margaret Whitman announced her decision to divorce her husband because of his continued physical abuse. Charles Whitman drove to Florida to help his mother move to Austin. Whitman was reportedly so afraid that his father would resort to violence against his mother as she prepared to leave, that he summoned a local policeman to remain outside the house while his mother packed her belongings. Whitman's youngest brother, John, also left Lake Worth and moved to Austin with his mother. Patrick Whitman, the middle son, remained in Florida and worked in his father's plumbing supply business. In Austin, Whitman's mother took a job in a cafeteria and moved into her own apartment, though she remained in close contact with Charles. Whitman's father later said he had spent more than a thousand dollars ($ in ) on long-distance phone calls to both his wife and Charles, begging his wife to return and asking his son to convince her to come back. During this stressful time, Whitman was abusing amphetamines and began experiencing severe headaches, which he described as being \\"tremendous\\".  Events leading to the shooting  Main building of the University of Texas at Austin. Whitman went up to the observation deck and fired upon people at ground level. The day before the shootings, Whitman bought a pair of binoculars and a knife from a hardware store, and some Spam from a 7-Eleven convenience store. He picked up his wife from her summer job as a telephone operator before he met his mother for lunch at the Wyatt Cafeteria, which was close to the university. At about 4:00 p.m. on July 31, 1966, Charles and Kathy Whitman visited their close friends John and Fran Morgan. They left the Morgans' apartment at 5:50 p.m. so Kathy could get to her 6:00‚Äì10:00 p.m. shift. At 6:45 p.m., Whitman began typing his suicide note, a portion of which read: > I do not quite understand what it is that compels me to type this letter. > Perhaps it is to leave some vague reason for the actions I have recently > performed. I do not really understand myself these days. I am supposed to be > an average reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately (I cannot > recall when it started) I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational > thoughts. These thoughts constantly recur, and it requires a tremendous > mental effort to concentrate on useful and progressive tasks. In his note, he went on to request an autopsy be performed on his remains after he was dead to determine if there had been a discernible biological contributory cause for his actions and for his continuing and increasingly intense headaches. He also wrote that he had decided to kill both his mother and wife. Expressing uncertainty about his reasons, he nonetheless stated he did not believe his mother had \\"ever enjoyed life as she is entitled to\\", and that his wife had \\"been as fine a wife to me as any man could ever hope to have\\". Whitman further explained that he wanted to relieve both his wife and mother of the suffering of this world, and to save them the embarrassment of his actions. He did not mention planning the attack at the university. Just after midnight on August 1, Whitman drove to his mother's apartment at 1212 Guadalupe Street. After killing his mother, he placed her body on her bed and covered it with sheets. Just how he murdered his mother is disputed, but officials believed he rendered her unconscious before stabbing her in the heart. He left a handwritten note beside her body, which read in part: > To Whom It May Concern: I have just taken my mother's life. I am very upset > over having done it. However, I feel that if there is a heaven she is > definitely there now [...] I am truly sorry [...] Let there be no doubt in > your mind that I loved this woman with all my heart. Whitman, Charles. > \\"Whitman Note Left with Mother's Body\\" , The Whitman Archives via Austin > American-Statesman, August 1, 1966. Whitman then returned to his home at 906 Jewell Street, where he killed his wife by stabbing her three times in the heart as she slept. He covered her body with sheets, then resumed the typewritten note he had begun the previous evening. Using a ballpoint pen, he wrote at the side of the page: > Friends interrupted. 8-1-66 Mon. 3:00 A.M. BOTH DEAD. Whitman continued the note, finishing it by pen: > I imagine it appears that I brutally killed both of my loved ones. I was > only trying to do a quick thorough job [...] If my life insurance policy is > valid please pay off my debts [...] donate the rest anonymously to a mental > health foundation. Maybe research can prevent further tragedies of this type > [...] Give our dog to my in-laws. Tell them Kathy loved \\"Schocie\\" very much > [...] If you can find in yourselves to grant my last wish, cremate me after > the autopsy. He also left instructions in the rented house requesting that two rolls of camera film be developed and wrote personal notes to each of his brothers. Whitman last wrote on an envelope labeled \\"Thoughts for the Day\\", in which he stored a collection of written admonitions. He added on the outside of the envelope: > 8-1-66. I never could quite make it. These thoughts are too much for me. At 5:45 a.m. on August 1, 1966, Whitman phoned his wife's supervisor at Bell System to explain that Kathy was ill and unable to work that day. He made a similar phone call to his mother's workplace five hours later. Whitman's final journal entries were written in the past tense, suggesting that he had already killed his wife and mother. University of Texas Tower shooting The tower observation deck At approximately 11:35 a.m., Whitman arrived on the University of Texas at Austin campus. He falsely identified himself as a research assistant and told a security guard he was there to deliver equipment. He then climbed to the 28th floor of the UT tower, killing three people within the tower, and opened fire from the observation deck with a hunting rifle and other weapons. Altogether, Whitman killed fourteen people and wounded thirty-one in the 96 minutes before he was shot and killed by Austin police officers Sergeant Ramiro Martinez and Patrolman Houston McCoy. They had raced to the top of the tower to stop Whitman.See, reprint of The Washington Post article, \\"50 years after the University of Texas Tower shooting\\", New Orleans Times-Picayune on-line, July 31, 2016 at nola.com Death and inquest =Medical history= Investigating officers found that Whitman had visited several university physicians in the year before the shootings; they prescribed various medications for him. Whitman had seen a minimum of five doctors between the fall and winter of 1965, before he visited a psychiatrist from whom he received no prescription. At some other time he was prescribed Valium by Dr. Jan Cochrum, who recommended he visit the campus psychiatrist. Whitman met with Maurice Dean Heatly, the staff psychiatrist at the University of Texas Health Center, on March 29, 1966. Whitman referred to his visit with Heatly in his final suicide note, writing, \\"I talked with a Doctor once for about two hours and tried to convey to him my fears that I felt come [sic] overwhelming violent impulses. After one visit, I never saw the Doctor again, and since then have been fighting my mental turmoil alone, and seemingly to no avail.\\" Whitman, Charles. \\"Whitman Letter\\" , The Whitman Archives. Austin American-Statesman. July 31, 1966. Heatly's notes on the visit said, \\"This massive, muscular youth seemed to be oozing with hostility [...] that something seemed to be happening to him and that he didn't seem to be himself.\\" \\"He readily admits having overwhelming periods of hostility with a very minimum of provocation. Repeated inquiries attempting to analyze his exact experiences were not too successful with the exception of his vivid reference to 'thinking about going up on the tower with a deer rifle and start shooting people. =Autopsy= Although Whitman had been prescribed drugs and was in possession of Dexedrine at the time of his death, the toxicology was delayed because Whitman had been embalmed on August 1, after his body was brought to the Cook Funeral Home in Austin. However, an autopsy had been requested in the suicide notes left by Whitman and was then approved by his father. On August 2, an autopsy was conducted by Coleman de Chenar (a neuropathologist at Austin State Hospital) at the funeral home. Urine and blood were removed to test for traces of amphetamines or other substances. During the autopsy, Chenar discovered a \\"pecan-sized\\" brain tumor, which he labeled an astrocytoma and which exhibited a small amount of necrosis. Chenar concluded that the tumor had no effect on Whitman's actions. These findings were later revised by the Connally Commission: \\"It is the opinion of the task force that the relationship between the brain tumor and Charles J. Whitman's actions on the last day of his life cannot be established with clarity.\\" =Connally Commission= Texas Governor John Connally commissioned a task force to examine the autopsy findings and material related to Whitman's actions and motives. The commission was composed of neurosurgeons, psychiatrists, pathologists, psychologists, including Stuart Brown, M.D., and the University of Texas Health Center Directors, John White and Maurice Heatly. The Commission's toxicology tests revealed nothing significant. They examined Chenar's paraffin blocks of the tumor, stained specimens of it and Whitman's other brain tissue, in addition to the remainder of the autopsy specimens available. \\"Report to the Governor, Medical Aspects, Charles J. Whitman Catastrophe\\" , The Whitman Archives. Austin American-Statesman. September 8, 1966. Following a three-hour hearing on August 5, the Commission concluded that Chenar's finding had been in error. They found that the tumor had features of a glioblastoma multiforme, with widespread areas of necrosis, palisading of cells, and a \\"remarkable vascular component\\" described as having \\"the nature of a small congenital vascular malformation\\". Psychiatric contributors to the report concluded that \\"the relationship between the brain tumor and [...] Whitman's actions [...] cannot be established with clarity. However, the [...] tumor conceivably could have contributed to his inability to control his emotions and actions\\", while the neurologists and neuropathologists concluded: \\"The application of existing knowledge of organic brain function does not enable us to explain the actions of Whitman on August first.\\" Forensic investigators have theorized that the tumor pressed against Whitman's amygdala, a part of the brain related to anxiety and fight-or-flight responses. Eagleman, David The Brain on Trial , The Atlantic Monthly, July 2011 Funeral A joint Catholic funeral service for Whitman and his mother was held in Lake Worth, Florida, on August 5, 1966. They were buried in Florida's Hillcrest Memorial Park. Since he was a military veteran, Whitman was buried with military honors; his casket was draped with the American flag.

Douglas was Minister of Finance in the Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand, 26 July 1984 to 2 November 1990. Rogernomics was characterised by market-led restructuring and deregulation and the control of inflation through tight monetary policy, accompanied by a floating exchange rate and reductions in the fiscal deficit.Dalziel, Paul in Easton, Brian ed The Making of Rogernomics Auckland University Press 1989 p. 53 Douglas came from a background of Labour Party politics. His adoption of policies more usually associated with the political right (or New Right), and their implementation by the Fourth Labour Government, were the subject of lasting controversy. Douglas and the development of economic policy, 1969‚Äì1983 Roger Douglas in 1965 Douglas became a Labour Member of Parliament at the 1969 general election. He showed his interest in economic policy in his maiden speech, in which he argued against foreign investment in the domestic economy.New Zealand Parliamentary Debates Vol 365 pp. 123‚Äì128 His case for external protection of the domestic economy and government involvement in investment was characteristic of the Labour Party of the time. From 1972 to 1975, Douglas was a junior minister in the Third Labour Government, where he won a reputation for his capacity for innovation.Bassett, Michael The Third Labour Government Dunmore Press 1976 pp. 24‚Äì25 This government followed a broadly Keynesian approach to economic management. As a minister, Douglas was innovative in the context of the public sector. As Broadcasting Minister he devised an administrative structure in which two publicly owned television channels competed against each other.Bassett 1976 p. 31 He was among the government‚Äôs leading advocates of compulsory saving for retirement, which he saw not only as a supplement to public provision for retirement but as a source of funding for public investment in economic development.Bassett 1976 p. 82 The superannuation scheme he helped design became law in 1974, but was disestablished by Robert Muldoon almost as soon as the National Party won the 1975 election. Douglas maintained his interest in economic issues in opposition. He framed his chief concern as the deep-seated problems in the structure of the economy that had contributed to deteriorating economic performance, and a standard of living that was slipping in comparison to that of other developed countries. In 1980, he described New Zealand as a country living on borrowed money, unable ‚Äì in spite of the record efforts of its exporters ‚Äì to pay its own way in the world.Douglas, Roger, An Alternative Budget 1980 From a neoliberal point of view which promotes small government, balanced budgets and inflation targeting, the economic policy of successive governments had left the domestic economy sheltered and unresponsive to consumers; inflation, which was more than ten per cent a year throughout the 1970s, was high by the standards of the country's major trading partners; and there was a persistent fiscal deficit. It was thought a large part of the economy was controlled by regulation, some arbitrary or inconsistent.This paragraph purports to be objective but is biased towards a neoliberal point of view that sees public investment/deficit as bad, the public sector as inherently inefficient and promotes deregulation. Douglas was a proponent of the shift away from Keneysianism/ mixed economy to a more neoliberal/unregulated one. It highly contentious whether that was positive or negative. This paragraph needs to declare its point of view. The post-war political consensus had produced stability but Douglas viewed this as being at the cost of innovation.Easton, Brian The Commercialisation of New Zealand Auckland University Press 1997 pp. 6‚Äì8 Both major political parties maintained the high levels of protection introduced by the First Labour Government from 1936 onwards, and since 1945 both parties had aimed at maintaining full employment. However, beneficiaries of the regulated economy had flourished in both public and private sectors.Bayliss, Len Prosperity Mislaid GP Publications 1994 pp. 42‚Äì45 Douglas argued that only radical action would improve the economic outlook. In 1980, he published an \\"Alternative Budget\\" that attacked what Douglas called the Muldoon government's \\"tinkering\\" with the economy. He wrote that twenty years of pandering to entrenched interests had dampened productive investment. The Labour leadership saw his proposals and their unauthorised publication as unfavourable comment on Labour policy. The Labour leader Bill Rowling publicly rebuked Douglas.Douglas, Roger and Callan, Louise Toward Prosperity David Bateman Ltd 1987 p. 16 Douglas then published his thinking in the form of a book.Douglas, Roger There's Got to Be a Better Way Fourth Estate Books Limited Wellington 1980 Alongside far-reaching proposals for reform of taxation and government spending, it advocated a twenty per cent devaluation of the dollar to increase the competitiveness of exports. Although radical, it took an eclectic approach and did not hint at the abandonment of Labour's Keynesian policy framework.Oliver, W H in Easton, Brian ed The Making of Rogernomics Auckland University Press 1989 p. 13 Douglas became increasingly frustrated by what he saw as the Labour Party's reluctance to deal with fundamental issues of economic policy. He claimed in 1981 that Labour had an image as a party that would promise the public anything to be elected. He argued that the party should agree on its economic policy before it agreed on anything else, and allow economic reality to play a part in its decision-making. Unable to convince Rowling of the merit of his case, a disillusioned Douglas decided to stand down from parliament at the 1981 election.Douglas and Callan 1987 pp. 21‚Äì27 One of those who persuaded him to stay was Labour‚Äôs deputy leader David Lange, who offered to make Douglas minister of finance if Lange was prime minister after the 1984 election.Lange, David My Life Viking 2005 p. 143 =Events after the 1981 election= After Labour's narrow loss in the 1981 election, Douglas found a growing audience in the parliamentary party for his view that Labour's established approach to economic policy was deficient. His colleague Mike Moore claimed that there was a public perception that Labour policy sought \\"to reward the lazy and defend bludgers\\".Oliver 1989 pp. 28‚Äì29 Douglas's case for a radical approach was strengthened by the belief among many of his parliamentary colleagues that the economy's deep-seated problems could only be solved by extensive restructuring. It was understood that some restructuring must follow the Closer Economic Relations agreement with Australia, which took effect in 1981 and reduced barriers to trade between Australia and New Zealand.Oliver 1989 p. 31 At the same time, many economists were arguing for the greater use of competition as a tool of policy, and expressing concern about excessive or inappropriate regulation of the economy.Jesson, Bruce Fragments of Labour Penguin Books 1989 pp. 39‚Äì40 In 1983, Lange succeeded Rowling as Labour leader. He gave Douglas responsibility for economic policy and made it clear that economic policy would determine other policy.Oliver 1989 p. 30 Although Douglas was innovative in his approach, and his open disregard for Rowling had earned him a reputation as a maverick, he remained within the mainstream of economic thinking in the parliamentary Labour Party.Oliver 1989 p. 35 He argued in 1982 that the government should actively support small business, and intervene to stop the aggregation of assets by big business. In his view, the government should use the tax system to encourage productive investment and discourage speculative investment. Until the end of 1983, Douglas saw exchange rate, tax and protection policies as means of actively shaping the business environment. In August 1982 he supported a contributory superannuation scheme as a means of funding industrial development and in February 1983 he wrote a paper called \\"Picking Winners for Investment\\" which proposed the establishment of local consultative groups to guide regional development. In a paper dated May 1983, Douglas argued that an unregulated market led to unhealthy concentrations of market power.Oliver 1989 pp. 13‚Äì15 A new direction, 1983‚Äì1984 At the end of 1983 there was a marked change in Douglas's thinking. He prepared a caucus paper called the \\"Economic Policy Package\\" which called for a market-led restructuring of the economy. The key proposal was a 20 per cent devaluation of the dollar, to be followed by the removal of subsidies to industry, border protection and export incentives. The paper doubted the value of \\"picking winners\\" and saw only a limited place for government funding of economic development.Oliver, 1989 pp. 19‚Äì20 His colleague Stan Rodger described the paper as a \\"quite unacceptable leap to the right\\". It immediately polarised opinion in the Labour Party.Oliver 1989 pp. 42‚Äì43 Douglas characterised the policy package as restrained and responsible, and an appropriate response to the country's economic difficulties.Douglas 1987 p. 36 He acknowledged the contribution to the package of Doug Andrew, a Treasury officer on secondment to the parliamentary opposition, among others.Douglas 1987 pp. 29‚Äì30 W H Oliver noted the close alignment of the package and Economic Management, Treasury's 1984 briefing to the incoming government.Oliver 1989 p. 19 His assessment was that Douglas was predisposed towards the Treasury view because its implementation required decisive action and because greater reliance on the market solved what Douglas saw as the problem of interest-group participation in policy-making.Oliver 1989 pp. 42‚Äì44 Division in Labour over economic policy crystallised when a competing proposal was submitted to the Labour Party's Policy Council. Its proponents included Rowling and others who had resisted his replacement as leader. It argued for a Keynesian use of monetary and fiscal policy. It was sceptical about the ability of the private sector to promote economic development. Economic restructuring was to be led by the government, which would act within a consultative framework. In this way, the social costs of restructuring would be avoided.Oliver 1989 pp. 43‚Äì45 There was stalemate in the Policy Council. As the 1984 election drew closer, Labour's deputy leader Geoffrey Palmer drafted a compromise that contained elements of both proposals. The Palmer paper was broadly worded, and it made no mention of devaluation. It anticipated some form of understanding between government and unions about wage restraint. It allowed for extensive consultation about economic policy and stated that necessary structural change would be gradual and agreed.Oliver 1989 pp. 48‚Äì49 When Muldoon unexpectedly called an early general election, the Labour Party adopted Palmer's paper as its economic policy. Lange said that Labour went into the election with an unfinished argument doing duty as its economic policy.Lange 2005 p. 164 Minister of Finance, 1984‚Äì1988 In 1984, Roger Douglas was made Minister of Finance, with two associate ministers of finance, David Caygill and Richard Prebble. They became known as the \\"Treasury Troika\\" or the \\"Troika\\", and became the most powerful group in Cabinet. Douglas was the strategist, Prebble the tactician, while Caygill mastered the details. With Caygill the \\"nice cop\\" and Prebble the \\"nasty cop\\", Douglas could sometimes appear as steering a considered middle course. Later Trevor de Cleene was made undersecretary to Douglas, with special responsibility for Inland Revenue. The key element of Douglas's economic thinking was implemented after Labour won the 1984 election but before it was formally sworn into office. This was the 20 per cent devaluation of the New Zealand dollar. The announcement of the snap election immediately provoked selling of the dollar by dealers who anticipated that a change of government would lead to a substantial devaluation. The result was a currency crisis that became a matter of public knowledge two days after the general election. Muldoon refused to accept official advice that devaluation was the only way to stop the currency crisis and provoked a brief constitutional crisis when he initially refused to implement the incoming government‚Äôs instruction that he devalue. Both crises were soon settled when accepted that he had no choice but to devalue after Muldoon's National Party colleagues threatened to approach the Governor General to dismiss him.Gustafson, Barry. His way: a biography of Robert Muldoon. Auckland University Press, 2000, pp. 384‚Äì395 Although devaluation was a contentious issue in the Labour Party and was not part of Labour's election policy, the decisiveness with which the incoming government acted won it popular acclaim and enhanced Douglas's standing in the new cabinet.Lange, David, interviewed in National Business Review, Auckland, 11 July 1986 The reformers argued that the speed with which the reforms were made was due to the fact that New Zealand had not adjusted to Britain's abandonment of the empire, and had to move quickly to \\"catch up\\" with the rest of the world.Philippa Mein Smith, A Concise History of New Zealand, Cambridge University Press, Melbourne: 2005, pp. 201‚Äì216. Douglas claimed in his 1993 book Unfinished Business that speed was a key strategy for achieving radical economic change: \\"Define your objectives clearly, and move towards them in quantum leaps, otherwise the interest groups will have time to mobilise and drag you down\\".Judith Bell, I See Red, Awa Press, Wellington: 2006, pp. 22‚Äì56. Political commentator Bruce Jesson argued that Douglas acted fast to achieve a complete economic revolution within one parliamentary term, in case he did not get a second chance.Bruce Jesson, \\"The New Rights Network of Power\\" in To Build a Nation: Collected Writings 1975‚Äì1999, edited Andrew Sharp, Penguin Press: 2005, p. 190. The reforms can be summarised as the dismantling of the Australasian orthodoxy of state development that had existed for the previous 90 years, and its replacement by the Anglo-American neo-classical model based on the monetarist policies of Milton Friedman and the Chicago School. The financial market was deregulated and controls on foreign exchange removed. Subsidies to many industries, notably agriculture, were removed or significantly reduced, as was tariff protection. The top marginal tax rate was halved over a number of years from 66% to 33%, and the standard rate was reduced from 42% in 1978 to 28% in 1988. To compensate, the variable sales taxes that had been in effect until then were replaced by a single Goods and Services Tax, initially set at 10%, later 12.5% (and eventually in 2011, 15%), and a surtax on superannuation, which had been made universal from age 60 by the previous government.Michael King, The Penguin History of New Zealand, Penguin Books (NZ), Auckland: 2003, p. 490. Immediate results New Zealand's leap into the neoliberalist global economy exposed both businesses and the wider workforce to the unregulated predatory practices of private capital - this led to a decade of insignificant (and sometimes negative) growth with the \\"economic miracle\\" being experienced by only a relatively small proportion of the population. With no restrictions on overseas money coming into the country the focus in the economy shifted from the productive sector to finance.Bruce Jesson, \\"The Changing Face of New Zealand Capitalism\\" in To Build a Nation ibid., pp. 177‚Äì178. Finance capital outstripped industrial capital and redundancies occurred in manufacturing industry; approximately 76,000 manufacturing jobs were lost between 1987 and 1992. The new state-owned enterprises created from 1 April 1987 began to shed thousands of jobs adding to unemployment: Electricity Corporation 3,000; Coal Corporation 4,000; Forestry Corporation 5,000; New Zealand Post 8,000. The newly unfettered business environment created by the deregulation of the financial sector, David Grant writes, left New Zealanders \\"easy targets for speculators and their agents\\", exacerbating the effects of the October 1987 stock market crash. During wage bargaining in 1986 and 1987, employers started to bargain harder. Lock-outs were not uncommon; the most spectacular occurred at a pulp and paper mill owned by Fletcher Challenge and led to changes to work practices and a no-strike commitment from the union. Later settlements drew further concessions from unions, including below-inflation wage increases, and an effective real wage cut.Colin James, The Quiet Revolution, Allen & Unwin New Zealand Ltd in association with Port Nicholson Press, Wellington: 1986, p. 166. There was a structural change in the economy from industry to services, which, along with the arrival of trans-Tasman retail chains and an increasingly cosmopolitan hospitality industry, led to a new ‚Äòcaf√© culture‚Äô enjoyed by more affluent New Zealanders. Some argue that for the rest of the population, Rogernomics failed to deliver the higher standard of living promised by its advocates. Over 15 years, New Zealand's economy and social capital faced serious problems: the youth suicide rate grew sharply into one of the highest in the developed world; the proliferation of food banks increased dramatically to an estimated 365 in 1994; marked increases in violent and other crime were observed; the number of New Zealanders estimated to be living in poverty grew by at least 35% between 1989 and 1992 while child poverty doubled from 14% in 1982 to 29% in 1994. Those on low incomes failed to return to the 1984 standard of living until 1996; the lowest 30% did not recover their own 1980s living standards for twenty years. The health of the New Zealand population was also especially hard-hit, leading to a significant deterioration in health standards among working and middle-class people. In addition, many of the promised economic benefits of the experiment never materialised. Between 1985 and 1992, New Zealand's economy grew by 4.7% during the same period in which the average OECD nation grew by 28.2%. From 1984 to 1993 inflation averaged 9% per year, New Zealand's credit rating dropped twice, and foreign debt quadrupled. Between 1986 and 1992, the unemployment rate rose from 3.6% to 11%. Legacy The policies of Ruth Richardson, sometimes called \\"Ruthanasia\\", are often seen as a continuation of Rogernomics. Richardson served as Finance Minister in the National Party government from 1990 to 1993. National expanded these policies by drastically cutting spending, deregulating Labour markets, and further asset sales. In 1990 David Lange said of the Government: > \\"It is there to be the securer of its citizen[s'] welfare. Where the market > works well, it should be given its head. Where the market results in > manifest inequity, or poor economic performance, the Government must get > involved.\\" After Rogernomics, the New Zealand Labour Party was paralysed by infighting for much of their time in opposition, Mike Moore became Leader of the Opposition (1990‚Äì1993), who was then followed by Helen Clark, whose first term as Leader of the Opposition was undermined by those who opposed her leadership. Some later left to form their own political parties ACT, the Alliance, and United (later United Future). Clark for her part survived these internal leadership scuffles and Labour stabilised under her leadership during the third and final term of the Jim Bolger and Jenny Shipley administrations. Much like Tony Blair in the United Kingdom, Clark assumed a compromise solution to social exclusion and poverty, combining advocacy of the open economy and of free trade with greater emphasis on fighting the consequences of neoliberal policies. Labour became loosely aligned with the third way between 1999 and 2008. In 1990s New Zealand, advocates of radical economic policies were often branded as \\"rogergnomes\\" by their opponents, linking their views to Douglas's and to the supposed baleful influence of international bankers, characterised as \\"the Gnomes of Z√ºrich\\". A 2015 Treasury report said that inequality in New Zealand increased in the 1980s and 1990s but has been stable for the last 20 years. However, another 2015 article reported that New Zealand's rate of rise of inequality had been the highest in the OECD, and that New Zealand's inequality had previously been low by OECD standards.

Live in Italy is Lydia Kavina's second compact disc. It was recorded in Italy in 1998 and then released on CD by Teleura in 2000. Theremin & Lydia Kavina Invented in 1919 in Russia by Lev Sergeivitch Termen, the Theremin was not only the first electronic musical instrument, but also the first (and still the only) instrument played without touching it by moving the hands in the space between two antennas, one of which controls intonation and the other the volume. Lydia Kavina is universally recognised as being the greatest virtuoso of the Theremin in the world. The niece of one of Lev Termen's first-degree cousins, Kavina began studying the Theremin under the direction of Termen himself when she was nine years old. Five years later, she was ready to give her first Theremin concert, which marked the beginning of a musical career that has so far led to more than 500 theatre, radio and television performances throughout the world. In addition to giving concerts, Kavina is a composer of music for the Theremin (three of her works can be heard on this disc) and teaches the instrument in Russia, the United States and Western Europe. Together with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, she participated in creating the sound track of the Oscar-winning film Ed Wood. In 1999 has been published Lydia's first disc entitled \\"Music from the Ether\\".

It is the capital of the Charente-Maritime department. The city is connected to the √éle de R√© by a bridge completed on 19 May 1988. Its harbour opens into a protected strait, the Pertuis d'Antioche. History =Antiquity= Roman times. The area of La Rochelle was occupied in antiquity by the Gallic tribe of the Santones, who gave their name to the nearby region of Saintonge and the city of Saintes. The Romans subsequently occupied the area, where they developed salt production along the coast as well as wine production, which was then re- exported throughout the Empire. Roman villas have been found at Saint-√âloi and at Les Minimes, as well as salt evaporation ponds dating from the same period. =Foundation= La Rochelle was founded during the 10th century and became an important harbour in the 12th century. The name was first recorded in 961 as Rupella, from a Latin diminutive meaning 'little rock', and was later known as Rocella and Roscella before the name took on its current form. The establishment of La Rochelle as a harbour was a consequence of the victory of Duke Guillaume X of Aquitaine over Isambert de Ch√¢telaillon in 1130 and the subsequent destruction of his harbour of Ch√¢telaillon.Reformation in La Rochelle: tradition and change in early modern Europe by Judith Chandler Pugh Meyer p.19 Google Books In 1137, Guillaume X to all intents and purposes made La Rochelle a free port and gave it the right to establish itself as a commune. Fifty years later Eleanor of Aquitaine upheld the communal charter promulgated by her father, and for the first time in France, a city mayor was appointed for La Rochelle, Guillaume de Montmirail. Guillaume was assisted in his responsibilities by 24 municipal magistrates, and 75 notables who had jurisdiction over the inhabitants. Under the communal charter, the city obtained many privileges, such as the right to mint its own coins, and to operate some businesses free of royal taxes, factors which would favour the development of the entrepreneurial middle-class (bourgeoisie). =Plantagenet rule (1154‚Äì1224)= Eleanor married Henry Plantagenet in 1152, who became king of England as Henry II in 1154, thus putting La Rochelle under Plantagenet rule, until Louis VIII captured it in the 1224 Siege of La Rochelle. During the Plantagenet control of the city in 1185, Henry II had the Vauclair castle built, remains of which are still visible in the Place de Verdun.Bradshaw's illustrated travellers' hand book in [afterw.] to France by George Bradshaw Google Books The main activities of the city were in the areas of maritime commerce and trade, especially with England, the Netherlands and Spain. In 1196, wealthy bourgeois Alexandre Auffredi sent a fleet of seven ships to Africa seeking wealth. He went bankrupt awaiting the return of his ships; they returned seven years later bearing riches. =Knights Templar= The Knights Templar had a strong presence in La Rochelle since before the time of Eleanor of Aquitaine, who exempted them from duties and gave them mills in her 1139 Charter. La Rochelle was the Templars' largest base on the Atlantic Ocean, and where they stationed their main fleet. From La Rochelle, they were able to act as intermediaries in trade between England and the Mediterranean. A popular thread of conspiracy theory originating with Holy Blood, Holy Grail has it that the Templars used a fleet of 18 ships which had brought Jacques de Molay from Cyprus to La Rochelle to escape arrest in France. The fleet allegedly left laden with knights and treasures just before the issue of the warrant for the arrest of the Order in October 1307. =Hundred Years' War= During the Hundred Years' War in 1360, following the Treaty of Bretigny La Rochelle again came under the rule of the English monarch. La Rochelle however expelled the English in June 1372, following the naval Battle of La Rochelle, between Castilian-French and English fleets. The French and Spanish decisively defeated the English, securing French control of the Channel for the first time since the Battle of Sluys in 1340. The naval battle of La Rochelle was one of the first cases of the use of handguns on warships, which were deployed by the French and Spanish against the English. Having recovered freedom, La Rochelle refused entry to Du Guesclin, until Charles V recognized the privileges of the city in November 1372. In 1402, the French adventurer Jean de B√©thencourt left La Rochelle and sailed along the coast of Morocco to conquer the Canary islands. Until the 15th century, La Rochelle was to be the largest French harbour on the Atlantic coast, dealing mainly in wine, salt and cheese. =French Wars of Religion= During the Renaissance, La Rochelle adopted Protestant ideas. Calvinism started to be propagated in the region of La Rochelle, resulting in its suppression through the establishment of Cours pr√©sidiaux tribunals by Henry II. An early result of this was the burning at the stake of two \\"heretics\\" in La Rochelle in 1552. Conversions to Calvinism however continued, due to a change of religious beliefs, but also to a desire for political independence on the part of the local elite, and a popular opposition to royal expenses and requisitions in the building projects to fortify the coast against England. On the initiative of Gaspard de Coligny, the Calvinists attempted to colonize the New World to find a new home for their religion, with the likes of Pierre Richier and Jean de L√©ry. After the short-lived attempt of France Antarctique, they failed to establish a colony in Brazil, and finally resolved to make a stand in La Rochelle itself.Fortress of the soul: violence, metaphysics, and material life by Neil Kamil p.133 Google Books Pierre Richier became \\"Ministre de l'√©glise de la Rochelle\\" (\\"Minister of the Church of La Rochelle\\") when he returned from Brazil in 1558, and was able to considerably increase the Huguenot presence in La Rochelle, from a small base of about 50 souls who had been secretly educated in the Lutheran faith by Charles de Clermont the previous year. He has been described, by Lancelot Voisin de La Popelini√®re, as \\"le p√®re de l'√©glise de La Rochelle\\" (\\"The Father of the Church of La Rochelle\\"). Protestant \\"Grand Temple\\" of La Rochelle, built on the Place du Ch√¢teau, modern Place de Verdun, in 1600‚Äì1603. Accidentally burned down in 1687. La Rochelle was the first French city, with Rouen, to experience iconoclastic riots in 1560, at the time of the suppression of the Amboise conspiracy, before the riots spread to many other cities. Further cases of Reformation iconoclasm were recorded in La Rochelle from 30 May 1562, following the Massacre of Vassy. Protestants pillaged churches, destroyed images and statues, and also assassinated 13 Catholic priests in the Tower of the Lantern.Fortress of the soul: violence, metaphysics, and material life by Neil Kamil p.148 Google Books From 1568, La Rochelle became a centre for the Huguenots, and the city declared itself an independent Reformed Republic on the model of Geneva.Fortress of the soul: violence, metaphysics, and material life by Neil Kamil p.149 Google Books During the subsequent period, La Rochelle became an entity that has been described as a \\"state within a state\\". This led to numerous conflicts with the Catholic central government. The city supported the Protestant movement of William of Orange in the Netherlands, and from La Rochelle the Dutch under Louis of Nassau and the Sea Beggars were able to raid Spanish shipping.The rise and fall of Renaissance France, 1483‚Äì1610 by Robert Jean Knecht p.355 Google BooksThe Counter-Reformation and price revolution, 1559‚Äì1610 Richard Bruce Wernham p.288 Google Books In 1571 the city of La Rochelle suffered a naval blockade by the French Navy under the command of Filippo di Piero Strozzi and Antoine Escalin des Aimars, a former protagonist of the Franco- Ottoman alliance. The city was finally besieged during the Siege of La Rochelle (1572-1573) during the French Wars of Religion, following the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in August 1572, and occurred at the same time as other sieges of Protestant cities such as the Siege of Sancerre. The conflict ended with the 1573 Peace of La Rochelle, which restricted the Protestant worship to the three cities of Montauban, N√Æmes and La Rochelle. Pierre Richier died in La Rochelle in 1580. =Huguenot rebellions= La Rochelle in 1628. Detail of Claude Lorrain Le si√®ge de La Rochelle. Under Henry IV, and under the regency of his son Louis XIII, the city enjoyed a certain freedom and prosperity. However, La Rochelle entered into conflict with the authority of the adult Louis, beginning with a 1622 revolt. A fleet from La Rochelle fought a royal fleet of 35 ships under Charles, Duke of Guise, in front of Saint-Martin-de-R√©, but was defeated on 27 October 1622, leading to the signing of the Peace of Montpellier. Revolt of Soubise (1625) In 1625, a new Huguenot revolt led by Duke Henri de Rohan and his brother Soubise led to the Capture of R√© island by the forces of Louis XIII. Soubise conquered large parts of the Atlantic coast, but the supporting fleet of La Rochelle was finally defeated by Montmorency, as was Soubise with 3,000 when he led a counter-attack against the royal troops who had landed on the island of R√©.Penny cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge Page 268 Google Books Siege of La Rochelle (1627‚Äì1628) Cardinal Richelieu at the Siege of La Rochelle, Henri Motte, 1881. Following these events, Louis XIII and his Chief Minister Cardinal Richelieu declared the suppression of the Huguenot revolt the first priority of the kingdom. The English came to the support of La Rochelle, starting the Anglo-French War, by sending a major expedition under the Duke of Buckingham. The expedition however ended in a fiasco for England with the Siege of Saint-Martin-de-R√©. Meanwhile, cannon shots were exchanged on 10 September 1627 between La Rochelle and Royal troops. This resulted in the Siege of La Rochelle in which Cardinal Richelieu blockaded the city for 14 months, until the city surrendered and lost its mayor and its privileges. Expulsion from La Rochelle of 300 Protestant families in November 1661, Jan Luiken (1649‚Äì1712). The remaining Protestants of La Rochelle suffered new persecutions, when 300 families were again expelled in November 1661, the year Louis XIV came to power. The reason for the expulsions was that Catholics deeply resented a degree of revival of Protestant ownership of property within the city. The growing persecution of the Huguenots culminated with the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV in 1685. Many Huguenots emigrated, founding such cities as New Rochelle in the vicinity of today's New York in 1689. La Rochelle, and the siege of 1627 form much of the backdrop to the later chapters of Alexandre Dumas, p√®re's classic novel, The Three Musketeers. =La Rochelle and the New World= La Rochelle slave ship Le Saphir ex-voto, 1741. La Rochelle harbour in 1762. Joseph Vernet. Mus√©e de la Marine. Because of its western location, which saved days of sailing time, La Rochelle enjoyed successful fishing in the western Atlantic and trading with the New World, which served to counterbalance the disadvantage of not being at the mouth of a river (useful for shipping goods to and from the interior). Its Protestant ship-owning and merchant class prospered in the 16th century until the Wars of Religion devastated the city.Kurlansky, Mark. Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World. Walker and Co., New York, 1997 pp. 51‚Äì52. . The period following the wars was a prosperous one, marked by intense exchanges with the New World (Nouvelle France in Canada, and the Antilles). La Rochelle armateurs (shipowners) became very active in triangular trade with the New World, dealing in the slave trade with Africa, sugar trade with plantations of the West Indies, and fur trade with Canada. This was a period of high artistic, cultural and architectural achievements for the city. Robert de La Salle departed from La Rochelle, France, on 24 July 1684, with the aim of setting up a colony at the mouth of the Mississippi, eventually establishing Fort Saint Louis in Texas. The city eventually lost its trade and prominence during the decades spanning the Seven Years' War, the French revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. During that period France lost many of the territorial possessions which it had had in the new World, and also saw a strong decrease in its sea power in the continuing conflicts with Britain, ultimately diminishing the role of such harbours as La Rochelle. After abolitionist movements led by such people as Samuel de Missy, the slave trade of La Rochelle ended with the onset of the French Revolution and the war with England in the 1790s, the last La Rochelle slave ship, the Saint-Jacques being captured in 1793 in the Gulf of Guinea. In February 1794, the National Assembly legislated the Universal Emancipation decree, which effectively freed all colonial slaves. In 1809, the Battle of the Basque Roads took place near La Rochelle, in which a British fleet defeated the French Atlantic Fleet. =La Rochelle faience= Faience of La Rochelle with Chinese figures, 18th century. Mus√©e d'Orbigny-Bernon. La Rochelle became one of the French centres for faience in the end of the 18th century. Bernard Palissy was born in the region and had some bearing in this development. During the 18th century, its style was greatly influenced by Chinese themes and Japanese Kakiemon-type designs.\\"Heavily potted plates with crude red and green Chinese figures were made in large numbers \\" in Collecting European delft and faience Diana Imber, Praeger, 1968, p.60\\"The industry only really started to flourish in La Rochelle towards the middle of the 18th century (...) new everyday vessels were decorated \\"au petit feu\\" with flowers and Chinese figures then in fashion.\\" Cahiers de la c√©ramique du verre et des arts du feu, Issues 41‚Äì45 Mus√©e national de c√©ramique (France).

A German stronghold, La Rochelle was the last French city to be liberated at the end of the war. The Allied siege of La Rochelle took place between 12 September 1944 and 7 May 1945. The stronghold, including the islands of R√© and Ol√©ron, was held by 20,000 German troops under German vice-admiral Ernst Schirlitz. Following negotiations by the French Navy frigate captain Meyer, the general German capitulation occurred on 7 May and French troops entered La Rochelle on 8 May. The submarine base became the setting for parts of the movie Das Boot. The U-boat scenes in Raiders of the Lost Ark were also shot in La Rochelle. The base is featured in the computer game Commandos 2: Men of Courage. It was also chosen in 2018 for the location shooting of the German television series Das Boot (a sequel to the 1981 Classic). Geography =Geology= La Rochelle seen from Spot Satellite The limestone cliffs around La Rochelle reveal the Jurassic geology of the area The bedrock of La Rochelle and surrounding areas is composed of layers of limestone dating back to the Sequanian stage (upper Oxfordian stage) of the Jurassic period (circa 160 million years ago), when a large part of France was submerged. Many of these layers are visible in the white cliffs that border the sea, which contain many small marine fossils. Layers of thick white rock, formed during period of relatively warm seas, alternate with highly fragile layers containing sand and remains of mud, formed during colder periods, and with layers containing various corals, that were formed during warmer, tropical times.La Rochelle touristic board at the \\"Pointe du Chay\\" The limestone thus formed is traditionally used as the main building material throughout the region. The area of La Pointe du Chay about from La Rochelle is a cliff area visited for leisurely geological surveys. =Climate= Under K√∂ppen‚Äôs climate classification, La Rochelle features an oceanic climate. Although at the same latitude as Montreal in Canada or the Kuril islands in Russia, the area is exceptionally mild throughout the year due to the influence of the Gulf Stream waters, the summers are relatively warm, and insolation is remarkably high, in fact, the highest in Western France including sea resorts much further in the south such as Biarritz. La Rochelle seldom experiences very cold or very warm weather. These specific conditions ‚Äì summer dry and sunny, winter mild and wet ‚Äì have led to the establishment of a Mediterranean-type vegetation cohabiting with more continental and oceanic types of vegetation. Population Today La Rochelle possesses a commercial deep water harbour, named La Pallice. The large submarine pens built during World War II still stand there, although they are not in use. La Pallice is equipped with oil unloading equipment, and mainly handles tropical wood. It is also the location of the fishing fleet, which was moved from the old harbour in the centre of the city during the 1980s. La Rochelle harbour by Vernet in 1762 and the same view 2019 La Rochelle also maintains strong links with the sea by harbouring the largest marina for pleasure boats in Europe at Les Minimes, and a rather rich boat-building industry which includes Amel Yachts. La Rochelle has a very big aquarium, and a small botanical garden (the Jardin des plantes de La Rochelle). The Calypso, the ship used by Jacques-Yves Cousteau as a mobile laboratory for oceanography, and which was sunk after a collision in the port of Singapore (1996) is now on display (sadly rotting) at the Maritime Museum of La Rochelle. One of the biggest music festivals in France, \\"FrancoFolies\\", takes place each summer in La Rochelle, where Francophone musicians come together for a week of concerts and celebration. 2004 marked the 20th anniversary of this event. The French Socialist Party has held its annual summer convention (Universit√© d'√©t√©) in La Rochelle since 1983. La Rochelle is the setting for the best-selling series of French language textbooks in the UK, titled Tricolore. The central character, Martine Dhome, lives with her family at the fictional address of 12, rue de la R√©publique. Tourism Harbour towers at night La Rochelle's main feature is the \\"Vieux Port\\" (\\"Old Harbour\\"), which is at the heart of the city, picturesque and lined with seafood restaurants. The city walls are open to an evening promenade. The old town has been well preserved. Three medieval towers are a prominent tourist attraction at the entrance to the harbor: The Chain Tower, The Lantern Tower and Saint Nicolas Tower. From the harbour, boating trips can be taken to the √éle d'Aix and Fort Boyard (home to the TV show of the same name). Nearby √éle de R√© is a short drive to the North. The countryside of the surrounding Charente-Maritime is very rural and full of history (Saintes). To the North is Venise Verte, a marshy area of country, crisscrossed with tiny canals and a resort for inland boating. Inland is the country of Cognac and Pineau. The nearby √éle de R√© is accessible via a bridge from La Rochelle. \\"Grosse Horloge\\" tower Fort Boyard Transport La Rochelle and its region are served by the international La Rochelle - √éle de R√© Airport, which has progressively developed over the last 5 years. The train station Gare de La Rochelle offers connections to Bordeaux, Nantes, Poitiers, Paris and several regional destinations. OFP La Rochelle is a freight railway serving the port. La Rochelle launched one of the first successful bicycle sharing systems in 1974. Education The city has more than 10,000 students each year. The University of La Rochelle was established in 1993. Together with the Excelia Group (La Rochelle Business School), they are the largest institutions of higher education of La Rochelle (7,000 and 3,500 students respectively).

It is a sub-prefecture of the Charente-Maritime department. History In December 1665, Rochefort was chosen by Jean-Baptiste Colbert as a place of \\"refuge, defence and supply\\" for the French Navy. The Arsenal de Rochefort served as a naval base and dockyard until it closed in 1926. In September 1757, Rochefort was the target of an ambitious British raid during the Seven Years' War. Another infrastructure of early Rochefort from 1766 was its bagne, a high-security penal colony involving hard labour. Bagnes were then common fixtures in military harbors and naval bases, such as Toulon or Brest, because they provided free labor. During the Jacobin period of the French Revolution (1790‚Äì95), over 800 Roman Catholic priests and other clergy who refused to take the anti-Papal oath of the \\"Civil Constitution of the Clergy\\" were put aboard a fleet of prison ships in Rochefort harbour, where most died due to inhumane conditions. Off Rochefort, from the island of √éle-d'Aix where he had spent several days hoping to flee to America, Napoleon Bonaparte surrendered to Captain F. L. Maitland aboard HMS Bellerophon, on 17 July 1815, ending the \\"Hundred Days\\". Rochefort is a notable example of 17th- century \\"ville nouvelle\\" or new town, which means its design and building resulted from a political decree. The reason for building Rochefort was to a large extent that royal power could hardly depend on rebellious Protestant La Rochelle, which Cardinal Richelieu had to besiege a few decades earlier. Well into the 20th century, Rochefort remained primarily a garrison town. The tourist industry, which had long existed due to the town's spa, gained emphasis in the 1990s.

The historic centre of the Artois region, with a Baroque town square, Arras is located in Northern France at the confluence of the Scarpe river and the Crinchon River.http://www.eupedia.com/france/arras.shtml The Arras plain lies on a large chalk plateau bordered on the north by the Marqueffles fault, on the southwest by the Artois and Ternois hills, and on the south by the slopes of Beaufort-Blavincourt. On the east it is connected to the Scarpe valley. Established during the Iron Age by the Gauls, the town of Arras was first known as Nemetocenna, which is believed to have originated from the Celtic word nemeton, meaning 'sacred space.'. Saint Vedast (or St. Vaast) was the first Catholic bishop in the year 499 and attempted to eliminate paganism among the Franks. By 843, Arras was seat of the County of Artois which became part of the Royal domain in 1191. The first mention of the name Arras appeared in the 12th century. Some hypothesize it is a contraction of Atrebates, a Belgic tribe of Gaul and Britain that used to inhabit the area. The name Atrebates could have successively evolved to become Atrades, Atradis, Aras and finally Arras. Others believe it comes from the Celtic word Ar, meaning 'running water', as the Scarpe river flows through Arras. Louis XIII reconquered Arras in 1640; the town officially became part of France in 1659. Arras is Pas-de-Calais‚Äô third most populous town after Calais and Boulogne- sur-Mer. The town counted 43,693 residents in 2012, with the Arras metropolitan area having a population of 124,200. Arras is located north of Paris and can be reached in 2 hours by car and in 50 minutes by TGV. It is the historic center of the former Artois province. Its local speech is characterized as a patois. The city of Arras is well known for its architecture, culture, and history. It was once part of the Spanish Netherlands, a portion of the Low Countries controlled by Spain from 1556 to 1714. Each year Arras attracts thousands of visitors, who explore the city's architecture and historic buildings. Some attractions include the splendid Town Hall and its Belfry (listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site since 15 July 2005), the \\"Boves\\" (a maze beneath the city), the Squares (La Place des H√©ros and La Grand'Place), the Art District (the Theatre of Arras and the H√¥tel de Gu√Ænes), the Abbey District (The Saint-Vaast Abbey and the Cathedral of Arras), the Vauban Citadel, and the Nemetacum site (the ancient town founded by the Romans 2000 years ago). The Canadian National Vimy Memorial is just outside the town. Unlike many French words, the final s in the name Arras should be pronounced. History =Prehistory= Archaeologists found evidence of prehistoric human settlements in the Scarpe basin. The archaeological sites of Mont-Saint-Vaast in Arras and Biache-Saint-Vaast were Stone Age settlements of the Mousterian culture. They were evidenced by the finds of stone tools. These tools show signs of the Levallois technique, a name given by archaeologists to a distinctive type of stone knapping, developed by forerunners to modern humans during the Paleolithic period 170,000 years ago. Very little was found to document the Bronze Age and Early Iron Age in the Arras area.\\"Arras\\", pp. 9-10. Editions des Beffrois, 1988. =Antiquity/Foundation= Arras was founded on the boat of Baudimont by the Belgic tribe of the Atrebates, who named it Nemetocenna in reference to a nemeton that probably existed there. It was later renamed Nemetacum/Atrebatum by the Romans, under whom it became an important garrison town.\\"Arras\\". Northern France and the Paris Region, pp. 120‚Äì122. Michelin Travel Publications, 2006. \\"Arras.\\" Concise Dictionary of World Place-Names. John Everett-Heath. Oxford University Press 2005. In the Scarpe valley archaeologists' excavations and data recovery revealed Late Iron Age settlements. These buildings, believed to be farms, were found near the municipalities of Arras, Hamblain-les-Pr√©s and Saint-Pol.\\"Arras\\", pp. 10. Editions des Beffrois, 1988. =Medieval and early modern period= Before the Middle Ages The ordination of Saint Vaast In the 4th century, Nemetacum was renowned for its arts and crafts as well as textiles trade throughout the whole empire. Between 406 and 407, the city was taken and destroyed by Germanic invaders. In 428, the Salian Franks led by Clodion le Chevelu took control of the region including the current Somme department. Roman General Aetius then chose to negotiate for peace and concluded a treaty (f≈ìdus) with Clodion that gave the Franks the status of ¬´foederati¬ª fighting for Rome. The town's people were converted to Christianity in the late 4th century by Saint Innocent, who was killed in 410 during a barbarian attack on the town. In 499, after the conversion of Clovis I to Catholicism, a diocese (√©v√™ch√© in French) was created in Arras, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arras, and given to Saint Vaast (also known as Saint Vedast in English), who remains the diocesan patron saint. Saint Vaast then established an episcopal see and a monastic community. It was suppressed in 580 to found the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cambrai, from which it would reemerge five centuries later. Early Middle Ages In 667 Saint Aubert, bishop of Cambrai, decided to found the Abbey of Saint Vaast, which developed during the Carolingian period into an immensely wealthy Benedictine abbey. The modern town of Arras initially spread around the abbey as a grain market. During the 9th century, both town and abbey suffered from the attacks of the Vikings, who later settled to the west in Normandy. The abbey revived its strength in the 11th century and played an important role in the development of medieval painting, successfully synthesizing the artistic styles of Carolingian, Ottonian and English art.\\"Arras.\\" Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages. Ed. Andr√© Vauchez. High Middle Ages \\"Li congi√©\\" by Jean Bodel, a trouv√®re that lived in Arras in the 12th century Arras: tapestry representing God's conversation with Noah In 1025, a Catholic council was held at Arras against certain Manichaean (dualistic) heretics who rejected the sacraments of the Church. In 1093, the bishopric of Arras was refounded on territory split from the Diocese of Cambrai. In 1097 two councils, presided over by Lambert d'Arras, dealt with questions concerning monasteries and persons consecrated to God. In this time, Arras became an important cultural center, especially for the group of poets who came to be known as trouv√®res. One particular society of such poets was later called the Puy d'Arras. The wool industry and trade The town was granted a commercial charter by the French crown in 1180 and became an internationally important location for banking and trade. The wool industry of Arras, established in the 4th century, became of great importance during the Middle Ages. Already in the third century Romans had lauded about the quality of wool from Tournai and Arras. By the eleventh century Arras was the leading city and trading hub of the wool industry. This prominence would eventually shift towards areas north of Arras, and cities such as Lille, Douai and Saint- Omer, followed by Ypres and eventually Bruges would become the centres of the wool industry and trade. However, by the 14th century Arras still was renowned and drew considerable wealth from the cloth and wool industry, and was particularly well known for its production of fine tapestries‚Äîso much so that in English and Italian the word Arras (Arazzi in Italian) was adopted to refer to tapestries in general. The patronage of wealthy cloth merchants ensured that the town became an important cultural center, with major figures such as the poet Jean Bodel and the trouv√®re Adam de la Halle making their homes in Arras. Late Middle Ages The ownership of the town was repeatedly disputed along with the rest of Artois. During the Middle Ages, possession of Arras passed to a variety of feudal rulers and fiefs, including the County of Flanders, the Duchy of Burgundy, the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg and the French crown. In 1430, Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc in French), was imprisoned in the region of Arras. The town was the site of the Congress of Arras in 1435, an unsuccessful attempt to end the Hundred Years' War that resulted in the Burgundians breaking their alliance with the English. After the death of Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 1477, King Louis XI of France took control of Arras but the town's inhabitants, still loyal to the Burgundians, expelled the French. This prompted Louis XI to besiege Arras in person and, after taking it by assault, he had the town's walls razed and its inhabitants expelled, to be replaced by more loyal subjects from other parts of France. In a bid to erase the town's identity completely, Louis renamed it temporarily to Franchise. In 1482, the Peace of Arras was signed in the town to end a war between Louis XI and Maximilian I of Austria; ten years later, the town was ceded to Maximilian. It was eventually bequeathed to the Spanish Habsburgs as part of the Spanish Netherlands.\\"Arras.\\" Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary. (2007).\\"Arras.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2008. Renaissance Arras remained under Habsburg rule from 1493 until 1640 when it was captured by the French. The Spanish ceded it by the peace treaty in 1659 and it has since remained French. The Union of Arras was signed here in January 1579 by the Catholic principalities of the Low Countries that remained loyal to King Philip II of Habsburg; it provoked the declaration of the Union of Utrecht later the same month. =Modern period= French Revolution Arras-born lawyer and politician Maximilien de Robespierre Maximilien de Robespierre, a French lawyer and politician from Arras and one of the best-known and most influential figures of the French Revolution, was elected fifth deputy of the third estate of Artois to the Estates-General in 1789. Robespierre also helped draft the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. During the French Revolution, the city of Arras was first presided over by French reformer Dubois de Fosseux, erudite squire, secretary of the Arras district (arrondissement in French) and future president of the Pas-de-Calais department. Around the same time, competing against Aire-sur-la- Lys, Calais and Saint-Omer, Arras won the prefecture of Pas-de-Calais. From September 1793 to July 1794, during the Reign of Terror, the city was under the supervision of Joseph Lebon who implemented food restrictions, ordered 400 executions and destroyed several religious monuments including the Arras Cathedral and the Abbey of St. Vaast. Arras' demography and economic activity remained the same throughout the French Revolution while Lille's grew exponentially. In 1898, under the influence of Mayor √âmile Legrelle, some of Arras' ramparts were demolished to build vast boulevards, establish a new sewage system and replace the old railway station from 1846. World Wars =World War I= H√¥tel de Ville, Arras on 26 May 1917 Grand'Place of Arras in February 1919 During most of the First World War, Arras was about away from the front line, and a series of battles were fought around the city and nearby, including the Battle of Arras (1914), the Battle of Arras (1917) and the Second Battle of the Somme component of 1918's Hundred Days Offensive. On 31 August 1914, German light cavalry (Uhlans) arrived in Tilloy-l√®s-Mofflaines, and an army patrol made a foray into Arras. On 6 September 1914, 3,000 soldiers led by General Hans-J√ºrgen von Arnim barracked within the city and in the citadel. Shortly after, Louis Ernest de Maud'huy's soldiers partly repelled the German army troops, and trenches were dug in the Faubourgs d'Arras. On 7 October 1914, the city hall burned. On 21 October 1914, the belfry was destroyed, and so was Arras Cathedral on 6 July 1915. In 1917, a series of medieval tunnels beneath the city, linked and greatly expanded by the New Zealand Tunnelling Company, became a decisive factor in the British forces holding the city particularly during that year's Battle of Arras. The nearby Canadian National Vimy Memorial By the end of World War I, the city was so heavily damaged that three-quarters had to be rebuilt. The reconstruction was extremely costly, yet it proved to be a success and allowed the city to expand. The town is located approximately south of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial built in 1936 on Hill 145, the highest point of the Vimy Ridge escarpment.http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/memorials/overseas/first- world-war/france/vimy/fast-facts It is dedicated to the Battle of Vimy Ridge assault (part of the 1917 Battle of Arras) and the missing First World War Canadian soldiers with no known grave; it is also the site of two WWI Canadian cemeteries. On 9 April 2017, the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge, Arras Mayor Fr√©d√©ric Leturque thanked Canadians, as well as Australians and British, New Zealanders and South Africans, for their role in the First World War battles in the area.http://thechronicleherald.ca/canada/1458104-slideshow-justin-trudeau-in- france-to-mark-the-100th-anniversary-of-vimy-ridge =World War II= In the early stages of the second World War, during the invasion of France in May 1940, the city was the focus of a major British counterattack. Arras saw an Allied counterattack against the flank of the German army. The German forces were pushing north towards the channel coast, in order to entrap the Allied Forces that were advancing east into Belgium. The counterattack at Arras was an Allied attempt to cut through the German spearhead and frustrate the German advance. Although the Allies initially made gains, they were repulsed by German forces and forced to withdraw to avoid encirclement. Arras was then occupied by the Germans and 240 suspected French Resistance members were executed in Arras citadel. On 3 September 1944, the city was entered and liberated by the British Guards Armoured Division. =Contemporary period= Recent cooperative agreement In September 1993, Ipswich (United Kingdom) and Arras became twin towns, and a square in the new Ipswich Buttermarket development was named Arras Square to mark the relationship. Geography Arras in the Pas-de-Calais \\"La Scarpe\\" by Arras-born painter Charles Desavary Arras in the summer =Location and area= Arras is located in northern France in the Hauts-de-France region. Hauts-de-France is divided into five departments: Nord, Pas-de-Calais, Somme, Oise, Aisne. Arras is in the south-east part of the Pas-de-Calais department and forms the Arras district (arrondissement d'Arras) in the Artois, a former province of northern France. By car, it is north of Paris, east of the English Channel, south of Brussels, and south of Amsterdam. The city's total area is . The lowest point in the city is at above sea level and the highest is at . =Geology= The soil of Arras is primarily composed of chalk, a soft, white, porous sedimentary rock that formed what is called the European stratigraphic unit. That Chalk Group deposited during the Late Cretaceous period 90 million years ago. It used to be extracted to construct the most prestigious buildings and houses of Arras. As a result, residents once nicknamed the city La ville blanche (the White Town). The Arras area soil is also composed of clay, which was used to produce bricks, build less noble buildings, and embellish fa√ßades. Clay is mostly found in the lieu-dit of La Terre Potier in the western part of the city. The level of earthquake hazard in the Arras area is low, as it is in the whole Pas-de-Calais department. =Hydrography= Two rivers flow through Arras: the Scarpe and the Crinchon, both left tributaries of the 350-kilometer-long Scheldt river (L'Escaut in French). The Crinchon is a rather small river of flowing through Arras underground, while the Scarpe is long, of which two-thirds has been turned into canals. The source of the Scarpe is at Berles-Monchel near Aubigny-en-Artois. It flows through the cities of Arras, Douai and Saint-Amand-les-Eaux. The river ends at Mortagne- du-Nord where it flows into the Scheldt. =Climate= Arras mainly has a Western European oceanic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Cfb) affected by the North Atlantic Current as it is close to the English Channel (La Manche in French). There is frequent rain in all seasons, and temperatures throughout the year are mild, as it is near the sea. Temperature variations tend to be moderate; but there are some brief cold spells as it is subject to both oceanic and continental influences. So the climate can also be referred as semi-oceanic (known as a Climat oc√©anique d√©grad√© in French). Summer days are usually moderately warm and agreeable, with temperatures between , occasionally rising above , with a fair amount of sunshine. Some years have even witnessed some unusual long periods of harsh summer weather, such as the heat wave of 2003 where temperatures exceeded for weeks, reaching on some days and rarely even cooling down at night. Spring and Fall have rather warm days and fresh nights, but remain quite unstable. Winter days are cold but generally above freezing, at around ; sunshine is usually scarce. Light night frosts are common as the temperature often falls below . Snowfall has been rare in the past decade but happens in some winters, such as 2009‚Äì10, with unusually cold weather: much of Europe had heavy snowfall and record-low temperatures. The most recent warmest winters recorded were in 1989‚Äì90, 1994‚Äì95, 2006‚Äì07 and 2013‚Äì14. The Arras region (and most of Northern Europe) had remarkably warm and sunny weather in the winter of 2013‚Äì14. Rain falls throughout the year. Average annual precipitation is with light rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year. The highest recorded temperature was , and the lowest was . On 28 October 2013, Cyclone Christian (also known as the St. Jude storm), one of the strongest extra-tropical cyclones ever recorded, hit Northern Europe including the Arras area. The cyclone's central pressure was 981 mb, and wind speeds reached a maximum of . The city of Arras did not experience any major damage.  Population and society  Arras' demography in the Pas-de-Calais department The Arras Prefecture =Demographics= , the population of Arras is 43,693 for a density of 3,756.92 people per square kilometre (9,880.69 per square mile). The residents go by the name of Arrageois (male) and Arrageoise (female). The population is rather young as the highest number of residents is 15-29 of age. The most recent male to female ratio is 100:113, and the female to male ratio is 100:89. There are 20,198 males (47%) for 22,474 females (53%). The Arras metropolitan area has a population of 124,200. = Religion = Arras's Basilique-Cath√©drale Notre-Dame et Saint-Vaast is the cathedral, a minor basilica, episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arras. =Education= Arras is part of the acad√©mie de Lille (Lille's School District). There are 11 √©coles maternelles (nursery schools), 11 √©coles primaires (elementary schools), 8 coll√®ges (junior high schools) and 7 lyc√©es (high schools) within the city.  Sights and attractions  Flemish-Baroque- style townhouses The Belfry of Arras View from the Belfry over the market Place des H√©ros Arras Cathedral The Boves The Vauban Citadel =Squares= The city centre is marked by two large squares, La Grand' Place and La Place des H√©ros, also called La Petite Place. The two squares are surrounded by a unique architectural ensemble of 155 Flemish-Baroque-style townhouses. These were built in the 17th and 18th century and were initially made of wood. In 1918, after the end of World War I, most of the townhouses were so severely damaged that they had to be restored to their pre-war conditions. They are now made of bricks. =Town hall and belfry= The Gothic town hall and its belfry were constructed between 1463 and 1554 and had to be rebuilt in a slightly less grandiose style after World War I. The belfry is high and used to serve as a watchtower. Nowadays tourists can enjoy ascending the belfry. =Cathedral of Arras= The original cathedral was constructed between 1030 and 1396. This Gothic structure was destroyed during the French Revolution and rebuilt in the 19th century. The present Basilique-Cath√©drale Notre-Dame et Saint-Vaast is a minor basilica. =The Boves= The Boves, a well-preserved underground network of tunnels, beneath the city, was built in the 10th century and can now be visited by tourists. The idea was to set up a vast underground network to make all inhabitants' cellars interconnect by means of tunnels. Excavation material (chalk) was not wasted but rather used to construct houses. During World War I and World War II, the Boves was utilized as an underground bunker to hide and protect residents and valued objects from falling bombs. =Art District= The Art District is renowned for its Italian-style theatre hall built in 1785 and the H√¥tel de Gu√Ænes, a private 18th-century townhouse that attracts artists, designers and producers of intimist shows. =Abbey District= Many of Arras's most remarkable structures, including the Mus√©e des beaux-arts d'Arras and several government buildings, occupy the site of the old Abbey of St. Vaast. The abbey's church was demolished and rebuilt in fashionable classical style in 1833, and now serves as the town's cathedral. The design was chosen by the one-time Abbot of St Vaast, the Cardinal de Rohan, and is stark in its simplicity, employing a vast number of perpendicular angles. There is a fine collection of statuary within the church and it houses a number of religious relics. = Vauban Citadel = Built by Vauban between 1667 and 1672, the Citadel has been nicknamed La belle inutile (the beautiful useless one) by residents as it has never been directly involved in heavy fighting and didn't prevent the Germans from occupying the city in either World War. Since 7 July 2008 it has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites Fortifications of Vauban which includes eleven other fortifications. Within the citadel on the side of La Place de Man≈ìuvre a small Baroque-style chapel was built. Outside, Le Mur des Fusill√©s (the wall of the people executed by a firing squad) pays tribute to the 218 members of the French Resistance shot in the citadel's ditch during World War II. =Seasonal events= Arras holds the biggest Christmas market north of Paris every year from the end of November to the end of December. Around 80 exhibitors offer a wide selection of arts and crafts, as well as local delicacies like chocolate rats, Atr√©bate beer and Coeurs d'Arras ‚Äì heart-shaped biscuits which come in two flavours, ginger and cheese. Entertainment includes cooking lessons with chefs, craft demonstrations, a merry-go-round, a ferris wheel, an ice-skating rink and heated shelters. It also offers native products from International locations such as Canada, Vietnam, Morocco, Indonesia, Africa and gourmet regional specialities from different parts of France: Auvergne, Savoie, South- Western France and Nord-Pas-de-Calais.Arras Christmas Market (Pas-de-Calais) - Visiting, Travel, Hotels The Main Square Festival is held for several days in early July within the Vauban Citadel, attracting tens of thousands of attendees and playing host to major acts such as The Chemical Brothers, Coldplay, Imagine Dragons, David Guetta and The Black Eyed Peas. The Arras Film Festival is a film festival held for ten days in November. Le jardin botanique Floralpina is a private botanical garden, specializing in alpine plants. It opens every year on the last Sunday of May and can be visited by appointment. =UNESCO recognition= Two buildings in Arras are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites: * The Belfry of the Town Hall, as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France group, since 2005 * The Vauban citadel, as part of the Fortifications of Vauban group, since 2008 =Outside Arras= The Vimy Memorial is a memorial just north of the town honouring a major World War I battle, the Battle of Vimy Ridge, which marked the first time Canada fielded an entire army of her own. Four Canadian divisions fought there on Easter weekend 1917. The Battle of Vimy Ridge was part of the broader Allied offensive in April known as the Battle of Arras. The Canadian National Vimy Memorial is nearby. Vimy was the only victory the Allies would enjoy during their 1917 spring offensive. The Basilica of Notre Dame de Lorette cemetery, overlooking the nearby village of Ablain-Saint-Nazaire, likewise stands before one of France's largest World War I necropolises. Part of an extensive network of tunnels dug in World War I by British Empire soldiers can be visited at the Carri√®re Wellington museum in the suburbs. Transportation =Railway station= La Gare d'Arras La Gare d'Arras before 1907 The Gare d'Arras railway station is served by a purpose-built branch of the LGV Nord high speed railway, with regular TGV services to Paris (45 minutes). There are also regular trains to Lille, Amiens, Dunkerque and several regional destinations.

After leading an abortive rebellion against British rule in 1803 he was captured then tried and executed for high treason against the British king George III of Great Britain and Ireland.Murphy, Sean. \\"The Grave of Robert Emmet\\", Irish Historical Mysteries, Dublin, Ireland; 2010 Emmet came from a wealthy Anglo-Irish Protestant ascendancy Church of Ireland family who sympathized with Irish Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, particularly in Ulster, such as the Presbyterians and their lack of representation in Parliament. The Emmet family also sympathized with the rebel colonists, or \\"patriots\\", in the American Revolution. While Emmet's efforts to rebel against British rule failed, his actions and speech after his conviction inspired his compatriots. Early life Emmet was born at 109 St. Stephen's Green, in Dublin on 4 March 1778. He was the youngest son of Dr Robert Emmet (1729‚Äì1802), a court physician, and his wife, Elizabeth Mason (1739‚Äì1803). The Emmets were financially comfortable, members of the Protestant Ascendancy with a house at St Stephen's Green and a country residence near Milltown. One of his elder brothers was an Irish Republican and Nationalist Thomas Addis Emmet, a close friend of Theobald Wolfe Tone, who was a frequent visitor to the house when Robert was a child. Emmet attended Oswald's school, in Dopping's-court, off Golden-lane.Webb, Alfred. A Compendium of Irish Biography, M.H. Gill & Son, Dublin, 1878 Emmet entered Trinity College Dublin in October 1793, at the age of fifteen. In December 1797 he joined the College Historical Society, a debating society. Career as a revolutionary While Emmet was at college, his brother Thomas and some of his friends became involved in political activism. Robert became secretary of a secret United Irish Committee in college, and was expelled in April 1798 as a result. That same year he fled to France to avoid the many British arrests of nationalists that were taking place in Ireland. While in France, Emmet supposedly garnered the support of Napoleon, who had promised to lend support when the upcoming revolution started. However this pledged support existed in Emmet's imagination, as Napoleon was fully involved from early 1798 in organising the French invasion of Egypt. Napoleon was in Toulon from 9 May 1798, before the Irish Rebellion of 1798 had begun, yet there is no record of Emmet travelling to Toulon to see him. After the 1798 rising, Emmet was involved in reorganising the defeated United Irish Society. In April 1799 a warrant was issued for his arrest. He escaped and soon after travelled to the continent in the hope of securing French military aid, but his efforts were unsuccessful. The French Consulate dictatorship was however focused on new peace treaties, that resulted in the Treaty of Lun√©ville in 1801 and the Treaty of Amiens (March 1802). Emmet returned to Ireland in October 1802. In March the following year, he began preparations for another uprising. In the meantime, the French Consulate was holding on to Holland, Switzerland and Piedmont, in a manner contrary to the Treaty of Amiens, and so the treaty was ended by the British government in May 1803. 1803 rebellion \\"Robert Emmet ‚Äì The Irish Patriot\\"; a posthumous imaginary portrait of 1872. After his return to Ireland, Emmet began to prepare a new rebellion, with fellow revolutionaries Thomas Russell and James Hope. He began to manufacture weapons and explosives at a number of premises in Dublin and developed a folding pike fitted with a hinge that allowed it to be concealed under a cloak. Unlike in 1798, the revolutionaries concealed their preparations, but a premature explosion at one of Emmet's arms depots killed a man. Emmet was forced to advance the date of the rising before the authorities' suspicions were aroused. Emmet was unable to secure the help of Michael Dwyer's Wicklow rebels. Many rebels from Kildare turned back due to the scarcity of firearms they had been promised, but the rising went ahead in Dublin on the evening of 23 July 1803. About 10,000 copies were printed of a proclamation in the name of the \\"Provisional Government\\", which influenced the 1916 Proclamation; most were destroyed by the authorities. Emmet wore a uniform of a green coat with white facings, white breeches, top-boots, and a cocked hat with feathers. Failing to seize Dublin Castle, which was lightly defended, the rising of some 200 men amounted to a large-scale disturbance in the Thomas Street area. Emmet saw a dragoon being pulled from his horse and piked to death, the sight of which prompted him to call off the rising to avoid further bloodshed. But, he had lost all control of his followers. In one incident, the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, Lord Kilwarden, was dragged from his carriage and stabbed by pikes. Found still alive, he was taken to a watch-house where he died shortly thereafter. He had been reviled as chief prosecutor of William Orr in 1797, but he was also the judge who granted habeas corpus to Wolfe Tone in 1798. Kilwarden's nephew, the Rev. Mr. Wolfe, was also murdered. Sporadic clashes continued into the night until finally quelled by British military forces. Capture and trial Robert Emmet's cell in Kilmainham Gaol Emmet fled into hiding, moving from Rathfarnham to Harold's Cross so that he could be near his sweetheart, Sarah Curran. He likely could have escaped to France, had he not insisted upon returning with Anne Devlin in order to take leave of Sarah Curran, to whom he was engaged. She was daughter of John Philpot Curran. Emmet was captured on 25 August and taken to the Castle, then removed to Kilmainham. Vigorous but ineffectual efforts were made to procure his escape. Depiction of Robert Emmet's trial He was tried for treason on 19 September; the Crown repaired the weaknesses in its case by secretly buying the assistance of Emmet's defense attorney, Leonard McNally, for ¬£200 and a pension. But McNally's assistant Peter Burrowes could not be bought and he pleaded the case as best he could. On 19 September, Emmet was found guilty of high treason. Before sentencing Emmet delivered a speech, the Speech from the Dock. It is especially remembered for its closing sentences and secured his posthumous fame among executed Irish republicans. It was printed in 1835 in Manchester for the bookseller TP Carlile.1835 text online; accessed April 8, 2014 > Let no man write my epitaph; for as no man who knows my motives dare now > vindicate them, let not prejudice or ignorance, asperse them.

Sullivan, Re Edited by Se√°n Ua Cellaigh, M.H. > Gill & Son, Dublin, 1953, pg.60 An earlier and more credible version of the speech was published in 1818, taken from the notes of his counsel Peter Burrowes, in a biography on Sarah Curran's father John, emphasising that Emmet's epitaph should be written on the future vindication of his character, and not specifically when Ireland took its place as a nation. It closed:Phillips, C. Recollections of Curran (1818 Milliken, Dublin) pp.256‚Äì259. > I am here ready to die. I am not allowed to vindicate my character; no man > shall dare to vindicate my character; and when I am prevented from > vindicating myself, let no man dare to calumniate me.

The modern historian Patrick Geoghehan wrote in 2003: \\"At last count there are over seventy different versions of the text, but most of these are later reworkings and have little claim to acceptance.\\"History Ireland, autumn 2003 Depiction of Robert Emmet's execution Memorial at Emmet's execution site, Thomas Street Chief Justice Lord Norbury sentenced Emmet to be hanged, drawn and quartered, as was customary for conviction of treason. The following day, 20 September, Emmet was executed in Thomas Street in front of St. Catherine's. He was hanged and then beheaded once dead. As family members and friends of Robert had also been arrested, including some who had nothing to do with the rebellion, no one came forward to claim his remains out of fear of arrest. Robert Emmet is described as slight in person; his features were regular, his forehead high, his eyes bright and full of expression, his nose sharp, thin, and straight, the lower part of his face slightly pock-marked, his complexion sallow. Burial Emmet's remains were first delivered to Newgate Prison and then back to Kilmainham Gaol, where the jailer was under instructions that if no one claimed them they were to be buried in a nearby hospital's burial grounds called 'Bully's Acre' in Kilmainham. A later search there found no remains. It is claimed that Emmet's remains were secretly removed from Bully's Acre and reinterred in St Michan's, a Dublin church with strong United Irish associations, though it was never confirmed.Sean Murphy, Bully's Acre and Royal Hospital Kilmainham Graveyards: History and Inscriptions, Dublin 1989 Speculation has continued regarding the whereabouts of Emmet's remains. It was suspected that they were buried secretly in the vault of a Dublin Anglican church. When the vault was inspected in the 1950s a headless corpse was found, suspected of being Emmet's, but could not be identified. Widely accepted is the theory that Emmet's remains were transferred to St Peter's Church in Aungier St. under cover of the burial of Robert's sister, Mary Anne Holmes, in 1804. In the 1980s the church was de-consecrated and all the coffins were removed from the vaults. The church has since been demolished. Legacy Irish postage stamps issued in 1953, commemorating the 150th anniversary of his death Emmet became a heroic figure in Irish history. His speech from the dock is widely quoted and remembered, especially among Irish nationalists. As he and his family also supported the American Revolutionary War, he is remembered there as well. Emmet's housekeeper, Anne Devlin, is also remembered in Irish history for enduring torture without providing information to the authorities. Robert Emmet's older brother, Thomas Addis Emmet emigrated to the United States shortly after Robert's execution. He eventually served as the New York State Attorney General. His descendants include the prominent American portrait painters Lydia Field Emmet, Rosina Emmet Sherwood, Ellen Emmet Rand, and Jane Emmet de Glehn, who were Robert Emmet's great-grand- nieces. Another descendant is American playwright Robert Emmet Sherwood. Golf course architect Devereux Emmet, electrical engineer William Le Roy Emmet, United States Army colonel Robert Temple Emmet, and attorney and sportsman C. Temple Emmet were among his great-grand-nephews. Representation in popular culture Robert Emmet wrote a letter from his cell in Kilmainham Gaol, Dublin on 8 September 1803. He addressed it to \\"Miss Sarah Curran, the Priory, Rathfarnham\\" and handed it to a prison warden, George Dunn, whom he trusted to deliver it. Dunn betrayed him and gave the letter to the government authorities. Due to Emmet's attempt to hide near Curran, which cost him his life, and his parting letter to her, Emmet became known as a legendary romantic character, appealing to the Victorian Era's appetite for Romanticism. His story was the subject of stage melodramas during the 19th century, most notably Dion Boucicault's inaccurate 1884 play Robert Emmet. He mistakenly portrayed Emmet and Curran as Roman Catholics (they were both Protestants), her father John Philpot Curran being portrayed as a Unionist, and Emmet being killed onstage by firing squad. Robert's friend from Trinity College, Thomas Moore, championed his cause by writing popular ballads about him and Sarah Curran, such as :Oh breathe not his name! let it sleep in the shade, :Where cold and unhonoured his relics are laid! The poem \\"On Robert Emmet's Grave\\" by Percy Bysshe Shelley states that Emmet's grave will \\"remain unpolluted by fame\\", as its location is unknown: :No trump tells thy virtues‚Äîthe grave where they rest :With thy dust shall remain unpolluted by fame, :Till thy foes, by the world and by fortune caressed, :Shall pass like a mist from the light of thy name. Esdaile manuscript book by Dowden, \\"Life of Shelley\\", 1887; dated 1812 Washington Irving devoted \\"The Broken Heart\\" in his The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. to the romance between Emmet and Sarah Curran, citing it as an example of how a broken heart can be fatal. The American film by Irish-Canadian Sidney Olcott entitled All for Old Ireland (1915), is also known as Bold Emmett, Ireland's Martyr or Robert Emmet, Ireland's Martyr.The Story of Irish Film, by Arthur Flynn, Currach Press, Dublin, 2005 .

From his base in Port Royal, Jamaica, he raided settlements and shipping on the Spanish Main, becoming wealthy as he did so. With the prize money from the raids he purchased three large sugar plantations on the island. Much of Morgan's early life is unknown. He was born in Monmouthshire, but it is not known how he made his way to the West Indies, or how he began his career as a privateer. He was probably a member of a group of raiders led by Sir Christopher Myngs in the early 1660s during the Anglo-Spanish War. Morgan became a close friend of Sir Thomas Modyford, the Governor of Jamaica. When diplomatic relations between the Kingdom of England and Spain worsened in 1667, Modyford gave Morgan a letter of marque, a licence to attack and seize Spanish vessels. Morgan subsequently conducted successful and highly lucrative raids on Puerto Principe (now Camag√ºey in modern Cuba) and Porto Bello (now Portobelo in modern Panama). In 1668 he sailed for Maracaibo and Gibraltar, both on Lake Maracaibo in modern-day Venezuela. He raided both cities and stripped them of their wealth before destroying a large Spanish squadron as he escaped. In 1671 Morgan attacked Panama City, landing on the Caribbean coast and traversing the isthmus before he attacked the city, which was on the Pacific coast. The battle was a rout, although the privateers profited less than in other raids. To appease the Spanish, with whom the English had signed a peace treaty, Morgan was arrested and summoned to London in 1672, but was treated as a hero by the general populace and the leading figures of government and royalty including Charles II. Morgan was appointed a Knight Bachelor in November 1674 and returned to the Colony of Jamaica shortly afterward to serve as the territory's Lieutenant Governor. He served on the Assembly of Jamaica until 1683 and on three occasions he acted as Governor of Jamaica in the absence of the post-holder. A memoir published by Alexandre Exquemelin, a former shipmate of Morgan's, accused the privateer of widespread torture and other offences; Morgan brought a libel suit against the book's English publishers and won, although the black picture Exquemelin portrayed of Morgan has affected history's view of the Welshman. He died in Jamaica on 25 August 1688. His life was romanticised after his death and he became the inspiration for pirate-themed works of fiction across a range of genres. Early life Henry Morgan was born around 1635 in Wales, either in Llanrumney or Pencarn, (both in Monmouthshire, between Cardiff and Newport) The historian David Williams, writing in the Dictionary of Welsh Biography, observes that attempts to identify his parents and antecedents \\"have all proved unsatisfactory\\", although his will referred to distant relations. Several sources state Morgan's father was Robert Morgan, a farmer. Nuala Zahedieh, writing for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, states that details of Morgan's early life and career are uncertain, although in later life he stated that he had left school early and was \\"much more used to the pike than the book\\". It is unknown how Morgan made his way to the Caribbean. He may have travelled to the Caribbean as part of the army of Robert Venables, sent by Oliver Cromwell as part of the Caribbean expedition against the Spanish in the West Indies in 1654, or he may have served as an apprentice to a maker of cutlery for three years in exchange for the cost of his emigration. Richard Browne, who served as surgeon under Morgan in 1670 stated that Morgan had travelled either as a \\"private gentleman\\" soon after the 1655 capture of Jamaica by the English, or he may have been abducted in Bristol and transported to Barbados, where he was sold as a servant. In the 17th century the Caribbean offered an opportunity for young men to become rich quickly, although significant investment was needed to obtain high returns from the sugar export economy. Other opportunities for financial gain were through trade or plunder of the Spanish Empire. Much of the plunder was from privateering, whereby individuals and ships were commissioned by government to attack the country's enemies. Career as a privateer Sir Christopher Myngs, under whom Morgan served It is probable that in the early 1660s Morgan was active with a group of privateers led by Sir Christopher Myngs attacking Spanish cities and settlements in the Caribbean and Central America when England was at war with Spain. In 1663 it is likely that Morgan captained one of the ships in Myngs' fleet, and took part in the attack on Santiago de Cuba and the Sack of Campeche on the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Sir Thomas Modyford had been appointed the Governor of Jamaica in February 1664 with instructions to limit the activities of the privateers; he made a proclamation against their activities on 11 June 1664, but economic practicalities led to him reversing the policy by the end of the month. About 1,500 privateers used Jamaica as a base for their activity and brought significant revenue to the island. As the planting community of 5,000 was still new and developing, the revenue from the privateers was needed to avoid economic collapse. A privateer was granted a letter of marque which gave him a licence to attack and seize vessels, normally of a specific country, or with conditions attached. A portion of all spoils obtained by the privateers was given to the sovereign or the issuing ambassador. In August 1665 Morgan, along with fellow captains John Morris and Jacob Fackman, returned to Port Royal with a large cargo of valuables. Modyford was impressed enough with the spoils to report back to the government that \\"Central America was the properest place for an attack on the Spanish Indies\\". Morgan's activities over the following two years are not documented, but in early 1666 he was married in Port Royal to his cousin, Mary Morgan, the daughter of Edward, the island's Deputy Governor; the marriage gave Henry access to the upper levels of Jamaican society. The couple had no children. Hostilities between the English and Dutch in 1664 led to a change in government policy: colonial governors were now authorised to issue letters of marque against the Dutch. Many of the privateers, including Morgan, did not take up the letters, although an expedition to conquer the Dutch island of Sint Eustatius led to the death of Morgan's father-in-law, who was leading a 600-man force. Sources differ about Morgan's activities in 1666. H. R. Allen, in his biography of Morgan, considers the privateer was the second-in-command to Captain Edward Mansvelt. Mansvelt had been issued a letter of marque for the invasion of Cura√ßao, although he did not attack Willemstad, the main city, either after he decided that it was too well-defended or that there was insufficient plunder. Alternatively, Jan Rogozi≈Ñski and Stephan Talty, in their histories of Morgan and piracy, record that during the year, Morgan oversaw the Port Royal militia and the defence of Jamaica; Fort Charles at Port Royal was partly constructed under his leadership. It was around this time that Morgan purchased his first plantation on Jamaica. =Attacks on Puerto Principe and Porto Bello (1667‚Äì1668)= Puerto Principe being sacked in 1668 In 1667 diplomatic relations between the kingdoms of England and Spain were worsening, and rumours began to circulate in Jamaica about a possible Spanish invasion. Modyford authorised privateers to take action against the Spanish, and issued a letter of marque to Morgan \\"to draw together the English privateers and take prisoners of the Spanish nation, whereby he might inform of the intention of that enemy to attack Jamaica, of which I have frequent and strong advice\\". He was given the rank of admiral and, in January 1668, assembled 10 ships and 500 men for the task; he was subsequently joined by 2 more ships and 200 men from Tortuga (now part of Haiti). Morgan's letter of marque gave him permission to attack Spanish ships at sea; there was no permission for attacks on land. Any plunder obtained from the attacks would be split between the government and the owners of the ships rented by the privateers. If the privateers stepped outside their official remit and raided a city, any resultant plunder would be retained by the privateers. Rogozi≈Ñski observes that \\"attacks on cities were illegal piracy‚Äîbut extremely profitable\\", although Zahedieh records that if Morgan was able to provide evidence of a potential Spanish attack, the attacks on cities were justifiable under the terms of his commission. Morgan's initial plan was to attack Havana, but, on discovering it was heavily defended, this was changed to Puerto Principe (now Camag√ºey), a town inland. Morgan and his men took the town, but the treasure obtained was less than hoped for. According to Alexandre Exquemelin, who sailed with Morgan, \\"It caused a general resentment and grief, to see such a small booty\\". When Morgan reported the taking of Puerto Principe to Modyford, he informed the governor that they had evidence that the Spanish were planning an attack on British territory: \\"we found seventy men had been pressed to go against Jamaica ... and considerable forces were expected from Vera Cruz and Campeachy ... and from Porto Bello and Cartagena to rendezvous at St Jago of Cuba [Santiago]\\". Morgan's attack on the Castillo de San Jeronimo, Porto Bello After the action, one of the English privateers quarrelled with one of his French shipmates and stabbed him in the back, killing him. Before a riot between the French and English sailors could begin, Morgan arrested the English sailor, and promised the French sailors that the man would be hanged on his return to Port Royal. Morgan kept his word and the sailor was hanged. After dividing the spoils of the conquest of Puerto Principe, Morgan announced a plan to attack Porto Bello (now in modern-day Panama). The city was the third largest and strongest on the Spanish Main, and on one of the main routes of trade between the Spanish territories and Spain. Because of the value of the goods passing through its port, Porto Bello was protected by two castles in the harbour and another in the town. The 200 French privateers, unhappy with the division of the treasure and the murder of their countryman, left Morgan's service and returned to Tortuga. Morgan and his ships briefly landed at Port Royal before leaving for Porto Bello. On 11 July 1668 Morgan anchored short of Porto Bello and transferred his men to 23 canoes, which they paddled to within of the target. They landed and approached the first castle from the landward side, where they arrived half an hour before dawn. They took the three castles and the town quickly. The privateers lost 18 men, with a further 32 wounded; Zahedieh considers the action at Porto Bello displayed a \\"clever cunning and expert timing which marked ... [Morgan's] brilliance as a military commander\\". Exquemelin wrote that in order to take the third castle, Morgan ordered the construction of ladders wide enough for three men to climb abreast; when they were completed he \\"commanded all the religious men and women whom he had taken prisoners to fix them against the walls of the castle ... these were forced, at the head of the companies to raise and apply them to the walls ... Thus many of the religious men and nuns were killed\\". Terry Breverton, in his biography of Morgan, writes that when a translation of Exquemelin's book was published in England, Morgan sued for libel and won. The passage about the use of nuns and monks as a human shield was retracted from subsequent publications in England. Morgan with a prisoner Morgan and his men remained in Porto Bello for a month. He wrote to Don Agust√≠n, the acting president of Panama, to demand a ransom for the city of 350,000 pesos. As they stripped the city of its wealth it is probable that torture was used on the residents to uncover hidden caches of money and jewels. Zahedieh records that there were no first-hand reports from witnesses that confirmed Exquemelin's claim of widespread rape and debauchery. After an attempt by Don Agust√≠n to recapture the city by force ‚Äì his army of 800 soldiers was repelled by the privateers ‚Äì he negotiated a ransom of 100,000 pesos. Following the ransom and the plunder of the city, Morgan returned to Port Royal, with between ¬£70,000 and ¬£100,000 of money and valuables; Zahedieh reports that the figures were more than the agricultural output of Jamaica, and nearly half Barbados's sugar exports. Each privateer received ¬£120 ‚Äì equivalent to five or six times the average annual earnings of a sailor of the time. Morgan received a five per cent share for his work; Modyford received a ten per cent share, which was the price of Morgan's letter of marque. As Morgan had overstepped the limits of his commission, Modyford reported back to London that he had \\"reproved\\" him for his actions although, Zahedieh observes, in Britain \\"Morgan was widely viewed as a national hero and neither he nor Modyford were rebuked for their actions\\". =Raids on Maracaibo and Gibraltar (1668‚Äì1669)= Maracaibo and La Ceiba (now Gibraltar) in modern-day Venezuela Morgan did not stay long in Port Royal and in October 1668 sailed with ten ships and 800 men for √éle-√†-Vache, a small island he used as a rendezvous point. His plan was to attack the Spanish settlement of Cartagena de Indias, the richest and most important city on the Spanish Main. In December he was joined by a former Royal Navy frigate, Oxford, which had been sent to Port Royal to aid in any defence of Jamaica. Modyford sent the vessel to Morgan, who made it his flagship. On 2 January 1669 Morgan called a council of war for all his captains, which took place on Oxford. A spark in the ship's powder magazine destroyed the ship and over 200 of its crew. Morgan and the captains seated on one side of the table were blown into the water and survived; the four captains on the other side of the table were all killed. The loss of Oxford meant Morgan's flotilla was too small to attempt an attack on Cartagena. Instead he was persuaded by a French captain under his command to repeat the actions of the pirate Fran√ßois l'Olonnais two years previously: an attack on Maracaibo and Gibraltar, both on Lake Maracaibo in modern-day Venezuela. The French captain knew the approaches to the lagoon, through a narrow and shallow channel. Since l'Olonnais and the French captain had visited Maracaibo, the Spanish had built the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress, outside the city, on the approach. Talty states that the fortress was placed in an excellent position to defend the town, but that the Spanish had undermanned it, leaving only nine men to load and fire the fortress's 11 guns. Under covering cannon fire from the privateer's flagship, Lilly, Morgan and his men landed on the beach and stormed the fortification; they found it empty when they eventually breached its defences. A search soon found that the Spanish had left a slow-burning fuse leading to the fort's powder kegs as a trap for the buccaneers, which Morgan extinguished. The fort's guns were spiked and then buried so they could not be used against the privateers when they returned from the rest of their mission. San Carlos de la Barra Fortress, which guarded the entrance to Maracaibo Morgan arrived at Maracaibo to find the city largely deserted, its residents having been forewarned of his approach by the fortress's troops. He spent three weeks in the city, ransacking and plundering what he could. Privateers searched the surrounding jungle to find the escapees; they, and some of the remaining occupants, were tortured to find where money or treasure had been hidden. Satisfied he had stolen all he could, he sailed south across Lake Maracaibo, to Gibraltar. The town's occupants refused to surrender, and the fort fired enough of a barrage to ensure Morgan kept his distance. He anchored a short distance away and his men landed by canoe and assaulted the town from the landward approach. He met scant resistance, as many of the occupants had fled into the surrounding jungle. He spent five weeks in Gibraltar, and there was again evidence that torture was used to force residents to reveal hidden money and valuables. Four days after he left Maracaibo, Morgan returned. He was told that a Spanish defence squadron, the Armada de Barlovento, was waiting for him at the narrow passage between the Caribbean and Lake Maracaibo, where the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress was sited. The forces, under the command of Don Alonso del Campo y Espinosa, had 126 cannon with which to attack Morgan, and had re-armed San Carlos de la Barra Fortress. The Spaniards had orders to end piracy in the Caribbean, and negotiations between Morgan and Espinosa continued for a week. The final offer put by the Spanish commander was for Morgan to leave all their spoils and slaves and to return to Jamaica unmolested, but no agreement was reached that would allow Morgan and his men to pass the fleet with their spoils but without attack. Morgan put the Spaniards' offers to his men, who voted instead to fight their way out. As they were heavily outgunned, one privateer suggested that a fire ship aimed at Espinosa's flagship, Magdalen would work. To this end, a crew of 12 prepared a ship that had been seized in Gibraltar. They disguised vertical logs of wood with headwear, to make the Spaniards believe that the vessel was fully crewed. To make it look more heavily armed, additional portholes were cut in the hull and logs placed to resemble cannons. Barrels of powder were placed in the ship and grappling irons laced into the ships rigging, to catch the ropes and sails of Magdalen and ensure the vessels would become entangled. Morgan destroys the Spanish Armada de Barlovento at Lake Maracaibo 1669 On 1 May 1669 Morgan and his flotilla attacked the Spanish squadron. The fire ship plan worked, and Magdalen was shortly aflame; Espinosa abandoned his flagship and made his way to the fort, where he continued to direct events. The second-largest Spanish ship, Soledad, tried to move away from the burning vessel, but a problem with the rigging meant they drifted aimlessly; privateers boarded the ship, fixed the rigging and claimed the craft as plunder. The third Spanish vessel was also sunk by the privateers. Morgan still needed to pass the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress, but was still out-gunned by the stronghold, which had the ability to destroy the privateer fleet if it tried to pass. The privateer decided to negotiate, and threatened to sack and burn Maracaibo if he was not allowed to pass. Although Espinosa refused to negotiate, the citizens of Maracaibo entered into talks with Morgan, and agreed to pay him 20,000 pesos and 500 head of cattle if he agreed to leave the city intact. During the course of the negotiations with the Maracaibos, Morgan had undertaken salvage operations on Magdalen, and secured 15,000 pesos from the wreck. Before taking any action, Morgan tallied his takings and divided it equally between his ships, to ensure that it was not all lost if one ship was sunk; it totalled 250,000 pesos, and a huge quantity of merchandise and a number of local slaves. Morgan observed that Espinosa had set his cannon for a landward attack from the privateers ‚Äì as they had done previously. The privateers faked a landing of their forces. The fort and its battlements were stripped of men as the Spanish prepared for a night assault from the English forces. That evening, with Spanish forces deployed to repel a landing, Morgan's fleet raised anchor without unfurling their sails; the fleet moved on the tide, only raising sail when they had moved level with the fortress, and Morgan and his men made their way back to Port Royal unscathed. Zahedieh considers the escape showed Morgan's \\"characteristic cunning and audacity\\". During his absence from Port Royal, a pro-Spanish faction had gained the ear of King Charles II, and English foreign policy had changed accordingly. Modyford admonished Morgan for his action, which had gone beyond his commission, and revoked the letters of marque; no official action was taken against any of the privateers. Morgan invested a share of his prize money in an plantation ‚Äì his second such investment. =Attack on Panama (1669‚Äì1672)= Morgan before Panama, 1671 (c. 1736 engraving used to illustrate Captain Charles Johnson's General History) In 1669 Mariana, the Queen Regent of Spain, ordered attacks on English shipping in the Caribbean. The first action took place in March 1670 when Spanish privateers attacked English trade ships. In response Modyford commissioned Morgan \\"to do and perform all manner of exploits, which may tend to the preservation and quiet of this island\\". By December Morgan was sailing toward the Spanish Main with a fleet of over 30 English and French ships carrying a large number of privateers. Zahedieh observes that the army of privateers was the largest that had gathered in the Caribbean at the time, which was \\"a mark of Morgan's renown\\". Morgan's first action was to take the connected islands of Old Providence and Santa Catalina in December 1670. From there his fleet sailed to Chagres, the port from which ships were loaded with goods to transport back to Spain. Morgan took the town and occupied Fort San Lorenzo, which he garrisoned to protect his line of retreat. On 9 January 1671, with his remaining men, he ascended the Chagres River and headed for Old Panama City, on the Pacific Coast. Much of the journey was on foot, through dense rainforests and swamps. The governor of Panama had been forewarned of a potential attack, and had sent Spanish troops to attack Morgan and his men along the route. The privateers transferred to canoes to complete part of the journey, but were still able to beat off the ambushes with ease. After three days, with the river difficult to navigate in places, and with the jungle thinning out, Morgan landed his men and travelled overland across the remaining part of the isthmus. The privateers, including Captain Robert Searle, arrived at Old Panama City on 27 January 1671; they camped overnight before attacking the following day. They were opposed by approximately 1,200 Spanish infantry and 400 cavalry; most were inexperienced. Morgan sent a 300-strong party of men down a ravine that led to the foot of a small hill on the Spanish right flank. As they disappeared from view, the Spanish front line thought the privateers were retreating, and the left wing broke rank and chased, followed by the remainder of the defending infantry. They were met with well-organised firing from Morgan's main force of troops. When the party came into view at the end of the ravine, they were charged by the Spanish cavalry, but organised fire destroyed the cavalry and the party attacked the flank of the main Spanish force. In an effort to disorganise Morgan's forces, the governor of Panama released two herds of oxen and bulls onto the battlefield; scared by the noise of the gunfire, they turned and stampeded over their keepers and some of the remaining Spanish troops. The battle was a rout: the Spanish lost between 400 and 500 men, against 15 privateers killed. Morgan attacking Panama, 1671 Panama's governor had sworn to burn down the city if his troops lost to the privateers, and he had placed barrels of gunpowder around the largely wooden buildings. These were detonated by the captain of artillery after Morgan's victory; the resultant fires lasted until the following day. Only a few stone buildings remained standing afterwards. Much of Panama's wealth was destroyed in the conflagration, although some had been removed by ships, before the privateers arrived. The privateers spent three weeks in Panama and plundered what they could from the ruins. Morgan's second-in-command, Captain Edward Collier, supervised the torture of some of the city's residents; Morgan's fleet surgeon, Richard Browne, later wrote that at Panama, Morgan \\"was noble enough to the vanquished enemy\\". The value of treasure Morgan collected during his expedition is disputed. Talty writes that the figures range from 140,000 to 400,000 pesos, and that owing to the large army Morgan assembled, the prize-per-man was relatively low, causing discontent. There were accusations, particularly in Exquemelin's memoirs, that Morgan left away with the majority of the plunder. He arrived back in Port Royal on 12 March to a positive welcome from the town's inhabitants. The following month he made his official report to the governing Council of Jamaica, and received their formal thanks and congratulations. Arrest and release; knighthood and governorship (1672‚Äì1675) Charles II, who ordered Morgan's arrest, but later knighted him During Morgan's absence from Jamaica, news reached the island that England and Spain had signed the Treaty of Madrid. The pact aimed to establish peace in the Caribbean between the two countries; it included an agreement to revoke all letters of marque and similar commissions. The historian Violet Barbour considers it probable that one of the Spanish conditions was the removal of Modyford from the Governorship. Modyford was arrested and sent to England by Sir Thomas Lynch, his recent replacement. The destruction of Panama so soon after the signing of the treaty led to what Allen describes as \\"a crisis in international affairs\\" between England and Spain. The English government heard rumours from their ambassadors in Europe that the Spanish were considering war. In an attempt to appease them, Charles II and his Secretary of State, the Earl of Arlington, ordered Morgan's arrest. In April 1672 the privateer admiral was returned to London where, Barbour writes, he was \\"handsomely lionized ... as the hero on whom Drake's mantle had fallen\\". Although some sources state that Morgan was also incarcerated in the Tower of London, Pope writes that Tower records make no mention of his presence there. Morgan probably remained at liberty throughout his time in London, and the political mood changed in his favour. Arlington asked him to write a memorandum for the king on how to improve Jamaica's defences. Although there was no court case ‚Äì Morgan was never charged with an offence ‚Äì he gave informal evidence to the Lords of Trade and Plantations and proved he had no knowledge of the Treaty of Madrid prior to his attack on Panama. Unhappy with Lynch's conduct in Jamaica, the King and his advisers decided in January 1674 to replace him with John Vaughan, 3rd Earl of Carbery. Morgan would act as his deputy. Charles appointed Morgan a Knight Bachelor in November 1674, and two months later, Morgan and Carbery left for Jamaica. They were accompanied by Modyford, released from the Tower of London without charge and made the Chief Justice of Jamaica. They travelled on board the Jamaica Merchant, which held cannon and shot meant to boost Port Royal's defences. The ship foundered on the rocks of √éle-√†-Vache and Morgan and the crew were temporarily stranded on the island until picked up by a passing merchant ship. In Jamaican politics (1675‚Äì1688) John Vaughan, 3rd Earl of Carbery On his arrival in Jamaica, the 12-man Assembly of Jamaica voted Morgan an annual salary of ¬£600 \\"for his good services to the country\\"; the move angered Carbery, who did not get on with Morgan. Carbery later complained of his deputy that he was \\"every day more convinced of ... [Morgan's] imprudence and unfitness to have anything to do with civil government\\". Carbery also wrote to the Secretary of State to bemoan Morgan's \\"drinking and gaming at the taverns\\" of Port Royal. Although Morgan had been ordered to eradicate piracy from Jamaican waters, he continued his friendly relations with many privateer captains, and invested in some of their ships. Zahedieh estimates that there were 1,200 privateers operating in the Caribbean at the time, and Port Royal was their preferred destination. These had a welcome in the city if Morgan received the dues owed to him. As Morgan was no longer able to issue letters of marque to privateer captains, his brother-in- law, Robert Byndloss, directed them to the French governor of Tortuga to have a letter issued; Byndloss and Morgan received a commission for each one signed. In July 1676 Carbery called for a hearing against Morgan in front of the Assembly of Jamaica, accusing him of collaborating with the French to attack Spanish interests. Morgan admitted he had met the French officials, but indicated that this was diplomatic relations, rather than anything duplicitous. In the summer of 1677 the Lords of Trade said they had yet to come to a decision on the matter and in early 1678 the king and the Privy Council recalled Carbery from Jamaica, leaving Morgan as governor for three months. In July 1678 Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle was appointed governor. By the late 1670s France became an increasing threat in the Caribbean, and Morgan took control of the defence of Port Royal. He declared martial law in 1678 and 1680 ‚Äì both during his periods as temporary governor of the island ‚Äì because of the threat of invasion, re-built the fortifications surrounding the town, and increased the number of cannon from 60 to more than 100 in the five years up to 1680. As Morgan and his allies on the Assembly of Jamaica continued to deal with privateers and pirates, criticism of their action in London was fomented by two former governors of Jamaica, Carbery and Lynch. After Lynch paid ¬£50,000 to Charles II, Morgan's commissions as lieutenant-governor and lieutenant-general were revoked and Lynch was appointed as the island's governor; Morgan still retained his position on the Assembly of Jamaica. Morgan had been a heavy drinker for several years; he received the news of the revocation of his positions badly and increased his intake of alcohol to the point where his health began to suffer. Lynch removed Morgan's supporters from the Assembly of Jamaica by 1683, and in October that year he removed Morgan and his brother-in-law, leaving the assembly packed with men loyal to him. In 1684 Lynch died, and was temporarily replaced as governor by his friend, the lieutenant-general, Hender Molesworth. Report from The London Gazette regarding Morgan's successful libel action In 1684 an account of Morgan's exploits was published by Exquemelin, in a Dutch volume entitled De Americaensche Zee-Roovers (trans: About the Buccaneers of America). Morgan took steps to discredit the book and successfully brought a libel suit against the book's publishers William Crooke and Thomas Malthus. In his affidavit he stated that he had \\"against evil deeds, piracies and robberies the greatest abhorrence and distrust,\\" and that \\"for the kind of men called buccaneers,\\" he \\"always had and still has hatred.\\" The court found in his favour and the book was retracted; damages of ¬£200 were paid to him. In December 1687 Lynch's permanent replacement arrived in Port George, Morgan's friend from his time in London, Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle. He dismissed Molesworth and gave Morgan an unofficial role as advisor. In July 1688 Albemarle persuaded the king to allow Morgan to regain a position on the Assembly, but the former privateer was too ill to attend. Hans Sloane, Albemarle's private physician, inspected Morgan and diagnosed dropsy; he also saw Morgan was drinking to excess and ordered him to reduce his alcohol intake, which was ignored. Sloane described his patient as > lean, sallow-coloured, his eyes a little yellowish and belly jutting out or > prominent ... He complained to me of want of appetite for victuals, he had a > kicking ... to vomit every morning and generally a small looseness attending > him, and withal is much given to drinking and sitting up late, which I > supposed had been the cause of his present indisposition. Morgan the slave owner In the 1670s and 1680s, in his capacity as an owner of three large slave plantations, Morgan led three campaigns against the Jamaican Maroons of Juan de Serras. Morgan achieved some success against the Maroons, who withdrew further into the Blue Mountains, where they were able to stay out of the reach of Morgan and his forces. However, Morgan failed in his attempts to either capture de Serras or to subdue his community of runaway slaves.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 23, 32-3. By the time Morgan died, he owned three plantations and large numbers of African slaves. He left most of his estate to his wife for the rest of her life. On her death, most of his land and slaves passed to his nephew Charles, second son of Robert Byndloss, who served as Chief Justice of Jamaica in 1681. Morgan also left a parcel of land in the now-defunct parish of St George to another Robert Byndloss (born c. 1673) the eldest son of his brother-in-law Robert Byndloss.Legacies of British Slave-ownership, University College London https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146662323 Retrieved 6 September 2020. Morgan also left some land in Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica to his friend, Roger Elletson, who was the ancestor of a future governor of Jamaica with the same name.Legacies of British Slave-ownership, University College London https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146662323 Retrieved 6 September 2020. Morgan's will was probated in 1689, and at his death he owned 131 African slaves on his estates, of which 64 were male and 67 female. About 33 of these slaves were listed as boys, girls or children. The slaves were valued at ¬£1,923.Legacies of British Slave-ownership, University College London https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146662323 Retrieved 6 September 2020. Death and subsequent events Morgan died on 25 August 1688; Albemarle ordered a state funeral, and laid Morgan's body at King's House for the public to pay respects. An amnesty was declared so that pirates and privateers could pay their respects without fear of arrest. He was buried at Palisadoes cemetery, Port Royal, followed by a 22-gun salute from the ships moored in the harbour. Morgan was a wealthy man when he died. His personal wealth was valued at ¬£5,263. His will initially left his plantations and slaves to his wife, Mary Elizabeth, but because they were childless, on her death his estate was to pass to his nephews, the children of his brother-in-law Byndloss. The burial of Lady Morgan was recorded in Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica on 3 March 1696.Legacies of British Slave-ownership, University College London https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146662323 Retrieved 6 September 2020.Rebecca Tortello, \\"Henry Morgan: the pirate king\\", Daily Gleaner http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0038.htm Retrieved 6 September 2020. In his will, signed 17 June 1688, he left his Jamaican property to his godsons Charles Byndloss and Henry Archbold, on condition they adopted the surname of Morgan. These were the children of his two cousins Anna Petronilla Byndloss and Johanna Archbold. To his sister Catherine Loyd he awarded ¬£60 per annum from his estate \\"paid into the hands of my ever honest cozen Thomas Morgan of Tredegar\\". On 7 June 1692 an earthquake struck Port Royal. About two-thirds of the town, amounting to 33 acres (13 ha), sank into Kingston harbour immediately after the main shock. Palisadoes cemetery, including Morgan's grave, was one of the parts of the city to fall into the sea; his body has never been subsequently located. Legacy Alexandre Exquemelin's De Americaensche Zee-Roovers (1678) which affected history's view of Morgan Rogozi≈Ñski observes that Morgan is probably the \\"best-known pirate\\" because of Exquemelin's book, although, Cordingly writes that Exquemelin bore a grudge over what he saw was Morgan's theft of the bounty from Panama. His experience explains \\"why he painted such a black picture of Morgan and portrayed him as a cruel and unscrupulous villain,\\" which subsequently affected historians' view of Morgan. Allen observes that, partly because of Exquemelin, Morgan has not been well-served by historians. He cites the examples of the historians whose biographies were so flawed they wrote that Morgan either died in London, prison or the Tower of London. These included Charles Leslie, A New History of Jamaica (1739), Alan Gardner, History of Jamaica (1873), Hubert Bancroft, History of Central America (1883) and Howard Pyle's work, Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates (compiled in 1921). Exquemelin wrote that Morgan's men undertook widespread torture in several of the towns they captured. According to Stephen Snelders, in his history of piracy, the Spanish reports of Morgan's raids do not refer to torture being practiced on the residents of Porto Bello or Gibraltar ‚Äì although there are reliable reports that it was carried out in Panama. The historian Patrick Pringle observes that while torture seems cruel and ruthless to contemporary eyes, it was an accepted part of judicial interrogation in many European countries at the time. Morgan always fought with a commission from the governor of Jamaica. In doing so, he was acting as a reserve naval force for the English government in the defence of Jamaica. As the Spanish did not recognise privateering as a legal activity, even if a captain carried letters of marque, they considered Morgan to be a pirate, something he firmly rejected. Rafael Sabatini's 1922 novel Captain Blood is based in large part on Morgan's career. Rogozi≈Ñski observes that Morgan does not appear in later fictional works as much as other pirates because of his \\"ambiguous mixture of charismatic leadership and selfish treachery\\", although his name and persona have featured in literature, including Rafael Sabatini's 1922 novel Captain Blood and John Steinbeck's first novel, Cup of Gold (1929), both of which are based in large part on Morgan's career. Morgan and stories of a hidden haul of treasure also feature to a lesser extent in other works, including Ian Fleming's 1954 novel Live and Let Die and John Masefield's 1920 poem \\"Captain Stratton's Fancy\\". Screen renditions of his life include Captain Blood (1935), The Black Swan (1942), Blackbeard the Pirate (1952), Morgan, the Pirate (1961), Pirates of Tortuga (1961) and The Black Corsair (1976). Morgan has also been featured in several video games, including Sid Meier's Pirates! and Age of Pirates 2: City of Abandoned Ships. In 1944 the Seagram Company started manufacturing the Captain Morgan brand of rum, named after the privateer and up until the 1990s the bottle neck had an illustration of a crest with the Welsh word 'UNDEB' for 'union' or 'unity' underneath, reflecting Henry Morgan's origin. This was later dropped in 2001 with the sale of the Captain Morgan brand to Diageo, the multinational drinks company based in London. The name of Morgan has been attached to local sites in the Caribbean, such as Morgan's Bridge, Morgan's Pass and Morgan's Valley in Clarendon, Morgan's Harbour Hotel and Beach Club in Kingston, the Hotel Henry Morgan, located in Roat√°n, Honduras, the Port Morgan resort located in Haiti and Captain Morgan's Retreat and Vacation Club on Ambergris Caye, Belize. The economist Peter Leeson believes that pirates and privateers were generally shrewd businessmen, far removed from the modern, romanticised view of them as murderous tyrants. The anthropologist Anne M. Galvin and the historian Kris Lane separately see Morgan as obtaining wealth to become a member of the landed gentry; Galvin wrote that Morgan showed \\"social mobility through self-interested acts of outlawry, political wiles, and business acumen\\". Glenn Blalock, writing for the American National Biography, claims that Morgan was seen as a hero to many Jamaicans and British both for his exploits as a buccaneer and for ensuring Jamaica remained a key part of the British Empire. However, many Jamaicans see Morgan as a \\"criminal pirate\\" who sought to maintain the system of slavery.Michael Burke, \\"Similarities with the first Christmas\\", Jamaica Observer, 21 December 2017 http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/opinion/similarities-with-the-first- christmas_120511?profile=&template;=PrinterVersion Retrieved 6 September 2020.Michael Burke, \\"Columbus, education, and Jamaica today\\", Jamaica Observer, 3 May 2018 http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/opinion/columbus- education-and-jamaica-today_132150?profile=1096 Retrieved 6 September 2020.

Constituting the westernmost bulk of the archipelago, it borders the Arctic Ocean, the Norwegian Sea, and the Greenland Sea. Spitsbergen covers an area of , making it the largest island in Norway and the 36th-largest in the world. The administrative centre is Longyearbyen. Other settlements, in addition to research outposts, are the Russian mining community of Barentsburg, the research community of Ny-√Ölesund, and the mining outpost of Sveagruva. Spitsbergen was covered in of ice in 1999, which was approximately 58.5% of the island's total area. The island was first used as a whaling base in the 17th and 18th centuries, after which it was abandoned. Coal mining started at the end of the 19th century, and several permanent communities were established. The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognized Norwegian sovereignty and established Svalbard as a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone. The Norwegian Store Norske and the Russian Arktikugol are the only mining companies at Spitsbergen. Research and tourism have become the important supplementary industries, featuring among others the University Centre in Svalbard and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. No roads connect the settlements; instead snowmobiles, aircraft, and boats serve as local transport. Svalbard Airport, Longyear provides the main point of entry and exit. The island has an Arctic climate, although with significantly higher temperatures than other places at the same latitude. The flora benefits from the long period of midnight sun, which compensates for the polar night. Svalbard is a breeding ground for many seabirds, and also supports polar bears, reindeer and marine mammals. Six national parks protect the largely untouched, yet fragile environment. The island has many glaciers, mountains, and fjords. Etymology Portion of 1599 map of Arctic exploration by the Dutch explorer Willem Barentsz. Spitsbergen, here mapped for the first time, appears as Het Nieuwe Land (Dutch for \\"the New Land\\"), center-left.

Hansard (1977) Chart of historical usage trends The Norwegian administrating authorities named the archipelago Svalbard in 1925, the main island becoming Spitsbergen. By the end of the 20th century, this usage had become common. History Dutch whalers near Spitsbergen by Abraham Storck, (1690) The first recorded sighting of the island by a European was by Willem Barentsz, who came across it while searching for the Northern Sea Route in June 1596. The first good map, with the east coast roughly indicated, appeared in 1623, printed by Willem Janszoon Blaeu. Around 1660 and 1728, better maps were produced. The archipelago may have been known to Russian Pomor hunters as early as the 14th or 15th century, although solid evidence preceding the 17th century is lacking. Following the English whalers and others in referring to the archipelago as Greenland, they named it Grumant (–ì—Ä—É–º–∞–Ω—Ç). The name Svalbard is first mentioned in Icelandic sagas of the 10th and 11th centuries, but this may have been Jan Mayen. =Early claims= Map of Spitsbergen Early whaling expeditions to Svalbard in general and Spitsbergen in particular tended, because of currents and fauna, to cluster on the western coast of Spitsbergen and the islands off shore. Shortly after whaling began (1611), the Danish‚ÄîNorwegian crown in 1616 claimed ownership of Jan Mayen and the Spitsbergen islands, as all of Svalbard was then known, but in 1613, the English Muscovy Company had done the same. The primary and most profitable whaling grounds of this joint-stock company came to be centered on Spitsbergen in the early 17th century, and the company's 1613 Royal Charter from the English Crown granted a monopoly on whaling in Spitsbergen, based on the (erroneous) claim that Hugh Willoughby had discovered the land in 1553.Schokkenbroek, Joost C.A. (2008). Trying-out: An anatomy of Dutch Whaling and Sealing in the Nineteenth Century, 1815-1885, p. 27. Not only had they wrongly assumed a 1553 English voyage had reached the area, but on 27 June 1607, during his first voyage in search of a \\"northeast passage\\" on behalf of the company, Henry Hudson sighted \\"Newland\\" (i.e. Spitsbergen), near the mouth of the great bay Hudson later named the Great Indraught (Isfjorden). In this way, the English hoped to head off expansion in the region by the Dutch, at the time their major rival.pp.1-22. Georg Michael Asher,(1860). Henry Hudson the Navigator.

Initially, the English tried to drive away competitors, but after disputes with the Dutch (1613‚Äì24), they, for the most part, only claimed the bays south of Kongsfjorden.Schokkenbroek, p. 28. =Danish expansion= A 1906 photograph of the Norwegian whaling factory ship Bucentaur in Bellsund, Spitsbergen From 1617 onwards, a Danish-chartered company began sending whaling fleets to Spitsbergen.pp. 18-20 in M√°r J√≥nsson. \\"Denmark-Norway as a Potential World Power in the Early Seventeenth Century\\", Itinerario, Volume 33, Issue 02, July 2009, pp 17-27. This successful expansion by Denmark into the North Atlantic has recently been cited by historians as the first step of the Danish-Norwegian state into overseas colonialism. It eventually built a small overseas empire of East Indian trade posts, North Atlantic possessions (such as Greenland and Iceland), and a small Atlantic trade route between possessions on the Guinea Coast (in modern Ghana) and what are now the United States Virgin Islands.M√°r J√≥nsson (2009) passim.,Pernille Ipsen and Gunl√∂g Fur. \\"Introduction to Scandinavian Colonialism\\", Itinerario, Volume 33, Issue 02, July 2009, pp 7-16. The entire Svalbard archipelago, nominally ruled first by Denmark‚ÄìNorway, and later the Norwegians (as Union between Sweden and Norway from 1814 to 1905, independent Norway from 1905), remained a source of riches for fishery and whaling vessels from many nations. The islands also became the launching point for a number of Arctic explorers, including William Edward Parry, Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld, Otto Martin Torell, Alfred Gabriel Nathorst, Roald Amundsen, and Ernest Shackleton. =Spitsbergen Treaty= Hornsund Polish Arctic Station, photographed in 2003 Between 1913 and 1920, Spitsbergen was a neutral condominium. The Spitsbergen Treaty of 9 February 1920, recognises the full and absolute sovereignty of Norway over all the arctic archipelago of Svalbard. Knowles, Daniel (2018) Tirpitz:The Life And Death of Germany's Last Great Battleship (Stroud:Fonthill Media) The exercise of sovereignty is, however, subject to certain stipulations, and not all Norwegian law applies. Originally limited to nine signatory nations, over 40 are now signatories of the treaty. Citizens of any of the signatory countries may settle in the archipelago. Once named Spitsbergen after its largest island, the Svalbard archipelago was made a part of Norway ‚Äî not a dependency ‚Äî by the Svalbard Act of 1925. Since this date, it has been a region of Norway, with a Norwegian- appointed governor resident at the administrative centre of Longyearbyen. Limitations on the imposition of certain Norwegian laws are outlined in the Spitsbergen Treaty. The largest settlement on Spitsbergen is the Norwegian town of Longyearbyen, while the second-largest settlement is the Russian coal- mining settlement of Barentsburg. (This was sold by the Netherlands in 1932 to the Soviet company Arktikugol). Other settlements on the island include the former Russian mining communities of Grumantbyen and Pyramiden (abandoned in 1961 and 1998, respectively), a Polish research station at Hornsund, and the remote northern settlement of Ny-√Ölesund.\\"Northern Townships: Spitsbergen\\", Hidden Europe magazine, 10 (September 2006), pp.2-5 =World War II= Allied soldiers were stationed on the island in 1941 to prevent Nazi Germany from occupying the islands. Norway came under German occupation in 1940. Germany took control of the oil fields and the weather station during this time, although most of the inhabitants on the island were Russian and Germany and the Soviet Union had a non-aggression pact until 22 June 1941. Once the non- aggression pact was ended, the United Kingdom and Canada sent military forces to the island to destroy German installations, both the Soviet coal mines and the German weather station.\\"Spitsbergen Operation\\", Lone Sentry website In 1943, the German battleship Tirpitz and an escort flotilla shelled and destroyed the Allied weather station in Operation Zitronella. On 6 September, a squadron consisting of Tirpitz, the battleship Scharnhorst, and nine destroyers weighed anchor in Altenfjord and K√•fjord and headed for Spitsbergen, to attack the Allied base. At dawn on 8 September 1943, Tirpitz and Scharnhorst opened fire against the two 3-inch guns which comprised the defences of Barentsburg, and the destroyers ran inshore with landing parties, destroying a supply dump and wrecking a landing station. By noon, the hostilities had ended, with the landing parties returning to the ships, along with some prisoners. The German ships returned safely to Altenfjord and K√•fjord on 9 September 1943. This was the last operation for the Tirpitz. = Post-war = On 29 August 1996, Vnukovo Airlines Flight 2801 crashed on the island, killing all 141 people on board. Government Lillieh√∂√∂kfjorden The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 established full Norwegian sovereignty over Svalbard. All 40 signatory countries of the treaty have the right to conduct commercial activities on the archipelago without discrimination, although all activity is subject to Norwegian legislation. The treaty limits Norway's right to collect taxes to that of financing services on Svalbard. Spitsbergen is a demilitarized zone, as the treaty prohibits the establishment of military installations. The treaty requires Norway to protect the natural environment. The island is administered by the Governor of Svalbard, who holds the responsibility as both county governor and chief of police, as well as authority granted from the executive branch. Although Norway is part of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the Schengen Agreement, Svalbard is not part of the Schengen Area nor EEA. Residents of Spitsbergen do not need visas for Schengen but are prohibited from reaching Svalbard from mainland Norway without them. People without a means of income can be rejected as residents by the governor. Citizens of any treaty signatory country may visit the island without a visa.Umbreit (2005): 106 Russia retains a consulate in Barentsburg.  Population  Longyearbyen In 2009, Spitsbergen had a population of 2,753, of whom 423 were Russian or Ukrainian, 10 were Polish and 322 were non- Norwegians living in Norwegian settlements. The largest non-Norwegian groups in Longyearbyen in 2005 were from Thailand, Sweden, Denmark, Russia and Germany. Spitsbergen is among the safest places on Earth, with virtually no crime.Umbreit (2005): 117 Longyearbyen is the largest settlement on the island, the seat of the governor, and the only incorporated town. It features a hospital, primary and secondary school, university, sports centre with a swimming pool, library, cultural centre, cinema, bus transport, hotels, a bank, and several museums. The newspaper Svalbardposten is published weekly.Umbreit (2005): 179 Only a small fraction of the mining activity remains at Longyearbyen; instead, workers commute to Sveagruva (or Svea) where Store Norske operates a mine. Sveagruva is a dorm town, with workers commuting from Longyearbyen on a weekly basis. Since 2002, Longyearbyen Community Council has had many of the same responsibilities of a municipality, including utilities, education, cultural facilities, fire department, roads and ports. No care or nursing services are available, nor is welfare payment available. Norwegian residents retain pension and medical rights through their mainland municipalities. The hospital is part of University Hospital of North Norway, while the airport is operated by state-owned Avinor. Ny-√Ölesund and Barentsburg are company towns with all infrastructure owned by Kings Bay and Arktikugol, respectively. Other public offices with presence on Svalbard are the Norwegian Directorate of Mining, the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Tax Administration and the Church of Norway. Svalbard is subordinate Nord-Troms District Court and H√•logaland Court of Appeal, both located in Troms√∏. Ny-√Ölesund is a permanent settlement based entirely on research. Formerly a mining town, it is still a company town operated by the Norwegian state-owned Kings Bay. While there is some tourism at the village, Norwegian authorities limit the access to the outpost to minimise impact on the scientific work. Ny-√Ölesund has a winter population of 35 and a summer population of 180. Poland operates the Polish Polar Station at Hornsund, with ten permanent residents. Barentsburg is the only remaining Russian settlement, after Pyramiden was abandoned in 1998. A company town, all facilities are owned by Arktikugol, which operates a coal mine. In addition to the mining facilities, Arktikugol has opened a hotel and souvenir shop, catering to tourists taking day trips or hikes from Longyearbyen. The village has facilities such as a school, library, sports center, community center, swimming pool, farm and greenhouse. Pyramiden has similar facilities; both are built in typical Soviet style and are the site of the world's two most northerly Lenin statues and other socialist realism artwork.Umbreit (2005): 194‚Äì203 Economy Skottehytta in Petuniabukta, Spitsbergen - polar base of Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland The three main industries on Spitsbergen are coal mining, tourism and research. In 2007, there were 484 people working in the mining sector, 211 people working in the tourism sector and 111 people working in the education sector. The same year, mining produced a revenue of NOK 2,008 million, tourism NOK 317 million and research NOK 142 million. In 2006, the average income for economically active people was NOK 494,700 ‚Äî 23% higher than on the mainland. Almost all housing is owned by the various employers and institutions and rented to their employees; there are only a few privately owned houses, most of which are recreational cabins. Because of this, it is almost impossible to live on Spitsbergen without working for an established institution. Since the resettlement of Spitsbergen in the early 20th century, coal mining has been the dominant commercial activity. Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, a subsidiary of the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry, operates Svea Nord in Sveagruva and Mine 7 in Longyearbyen. The former produced 3.4 million tonnes in 2008, while the latter sends 35% of its output to Longyearbyen Power Station. Since 2007, there has not been any significant mining by the Russian state-owned Arktikugol in Barentsburg. There has previously been some test drilling for petroleum on land, but this did not give results good enough to justify permanent operation. The Norwegian authorities do not allow offshore petroleum drilling activities for environmental reasons, and the land formerly test-drilled on has been protected as nature reserves or national parks. Spitsbergen Island coins were issued in 1946, with Russian Cyrillic lettering, in the USSR denomination of 10 and 20 kopecks. Then in 1993, coins were again minted in Russian values of 10, 20, 50, and 100 roubles. Both series have the motto \\"Arctic coal\\". Abandoned mine at Longyearbyen Spitsbergen has historically been a base for both whaling and fishing. Norway claimed a exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around Svalbard in 1977, Norway retains a restrictive fisheries policy in the zone, and the claims are disputed by Russia. Tourism is focused on the environment and is centered on Longyearbyen. Activities include hiking, kayaking, walks through glacier caves and snow-scooter and dog-sled safaris. Cruise ships generate a significant portion of the traffic, including stops by both offshore vessels and expeditionary cruises starting and ending in Svalbard. Traffic is strongly concentrated between March and August; overnight stays have quintupled from 1991 to 2008, when there were 93,000 guest-nights. Research on Svalbard centers on Longyearbyen and Ny-√Ölesund, the most accessible areas in the high Arctic. Norway grants permission for any nation to conduct research on Svalbard, resulting in the Polish Polar Station, Indian Himadri Station, and the Chinese Arctic Yellow River Station, plus Russian facilities in Barentsburg. The University Centre in Svalbard in Longyearbyen offers undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate courses to 350 students in various arctic sciences, particularly biology, geology and geophysics. Courses are provided to supplement studies at the mainland universities; there are no tuition fees and courses are held in English, with Norwegian and international students equally represented. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a \\"doomsday\\" seedbank to store seeds from as many of the world's crop varieties and their botanical wild relatives as possible. A cooperation between the government of Norway and the Global Crop Diversity Trust, the vault is cut into rock near Longyearbyen, keeping it at a natural and refrigerating the seeds to . The Svalbard Undersea Cable System is a fibre optic line from Svalbard to Harstad, needed for communicating with polar orbiting satellite through Svalbard Satellite Station and installations in Ny-√Ölesund. The Arctic World Archive, a huge digital archiving concern run by Norwegian private company Piql and the state-owned coal-mining company Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, opened in March 2017. In mid-2020, it acquired its biggest customer in the form of GitHub, a subsidiary of Microsoft. Transport Ships, such as MS Horyzont, are a common way for scientists to get around the island Within Longyearbyen, Barentsburg and Ny-√Ölesund, there are road systems, but they do not connect with each other. Off-road motorized transport is prohibited on bare ground, but snowmobiles are used extensively during winter ‚Äî both for commercial and recreational activities. Transport from Longyearbyen to Barentsburg () and Pyramiden () is possible by snowmobile during winter, or by ship all year round. All settlements have ports, and Longyearbyen has a bus system.Umbriet (1997): 63‚Äì67 Svalbard Airport, Longyear, located from Longyearbyen, is the only airport offering air transport for the island. Scandinavian Airlines has daily scheduled services to Troms√∏ and Oslo; there are also irregular charter services to Russia. Lufttransport provides regular corporate charter services from Longyearbyen to Ny-√Ölesund Airport and Svea Airport for Kings Bay and Store Norske; these flights are in general not available to the public. There are heliports in Barentsburg and Pyramiden, and helicopters are frequently used by the governor and to a lesser extent the mining company Arktikugol. Climate Snow is common throughout the year The climate of Svalbard is dominated by its high latitude, with the average summer temperature at to and January averages at to . The North Atlantic Current moderates Spitsbergens's temperatures, particularly during winter, giving it up to higher winter temperature than similar latitudes in Russia and Canada. This keeps the surrounding waters open and navigable most of the year. The interior fjord areas and valleys, sheltered by the mountains, have less temperature differences than the coast, giving about lower summer temperatures and higher winter temperatures. On the south of Spitsbergen, the temperature is slightly higher than further north and west. During winter, the temperature difference between south and north is typically , while about in summer.Torkilsen (1984): 98‚Äì99 Spitsbergen is the meeting place for cold polar air from the north and mild, wet sea air from the south, creating low pressure and changing weather and fast winds, particularly in winter; in January, a strong breeze is registered 17% of the time at Isfjord Radio, but only 1% of the time in July. In summer, particularly away from land, fog is common, with visibility under registered 20% of the time in July. Precipitation is frequent but falls in small quantities, typically less than annually in western Spitsbergen. More rain falls in the uninhabited east side, where there can be more than annually. Nature Svalbard poppy Three terrestrial mammalian species inhabit the island: the Arctic fox, the Svalbard reindeer, and accidentally introduced southern vole, which are only found in Grumant. Attempts to introduce the Arctic hare and the muskox have both failed.Umbreit (2005): 33 There are fifteen to twenty types of marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, seals, walruses, and polar bears. Arctic charr inhabit Linne¬¥vatn and other freshwater lakes on the island. Polar bears are the iconic symbol of Spitsbergen and one of the main tourist attractions.Torkildsen (1984): 174 While they are protected, persons going outside settlements are required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self-defence, as a last resort should they attack.Umbriet (2005): 132 Spitsbergen shares a common polar bear population with the rest of Svalbard and Franz Joseph Land. The Svalbard reindeer (R. tarandus platyrhynchus) is a distinct sub-species. While it was previously almost extinct, hunting is permitted for both it and the Arctic fox. About thirty types of bird are found on Spitsbergen, most of which are migratory. The Barents Sea is among the areas in the world with most seabirds, with about 20 million counted during late summer. The most common are little auk, northern fulmar, thick-billed murre and black-legged kittiwake. Sixteen species are on the IUCN Red List. Particularly Storfjorden and Nordvest- Spitsbergen are important breeding ground for seabirds. The Arctic tern has the furthest migration, all the way to Antarctica. Only two songbirds migrate to Spitsbergen to breed: the snow bunting and the wheatear. Rock ptarmigan is the only bird to overwinter.Torkilsen (1984): 162 Svalbard reindeer Two partial skeletons of Pliosaurus funkei from the Jurassic period were discovered in 2008. It is the largest Mesozoic marine reptile ever found ‚Äî a pliosaur estimated to be almost long. Svalbard has permafrost and tundra, with both low, middle and high Arctic vegetation. 165 species of plants have been found on the archipelago. Only those areas which defrost in the summer have vegetation.Torkilsen (1984): 144 Vegetation is most abundant in Nordenski√∂ld Land, around Isfjorden and where effected by guano.Umbreit (2005): 29‚Äì30 While there is little precipitation, giving the island a steppe climate, plants still have good access to water because the cold climate reduces evaporation.Torkilsen (1984): 101 The growing season is very short, and may last only a few weeks.Umbreit (2005): 32 There are six national parks on Spitsbergen: Indre Wijdefjorden, Nordenski√∂ld Land, Nordre Isfjorden Land, Nordvest-Spitsbergen, Sassen-B√ºnsow Land and S√∏r-Spitsbergen. The island also features Festningen Geotope Protected Area; some of the northeastern coast is part of Nordaust-Svalbard Nature Reserve. All human traces dating from before 1946 are automatically protected. Svalbard is on Norway's tentative list for nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

He is a feral boy from the Pench area in Seoni, India, who originally appeared in Kipling's short story \\"In the Rukh\\" (collected in Many Inventions, 1893) and then became the most prominent and arguably the most memorable character in the collections The Jungle Book and The Second Jungle Book (1894‚Äì1895), which also featured stories about other characters. Name In the stories, the name Mowgli is said to mean \\"frog\\", describing his lack of fur. Kipling made up the name, and it \\"does not mean 'frog' in any language that I know of.\\" Kipling stated that the first syllable of \\"Mowgli\\" should rhyme with \\"cow\\" (that is, )Kipling's list of names in the stories as opposed to the expected English word \\"mow\\" (). Kipling's Mowgli stories The Mowgli stories, including \\"In the Rukh\\", were first collected in chronological order in one volume as The Works of Rudyard Kipling Volume VII: The Jungle Book (1907) (Volume VIII of this series contained the non-Mowgli stories from the Jungle Books), and subsequently in All the Mowgli Stories (1933).. \\"In the Rukh\\" describes how Gisborne, an English forest ranger in the Pench area in Seoni at the time of the British Raj, discovers a young man named Mowgli, who has extraordinary skills in hunting, tracking, and driving wild animals (with the help of his wolf brothers). He asks him to join the forestry service. Mueller, the head of the Department of Woods and Forests of India as well as Gisborne's boss, meets Mowgli, checks his elbows and knees, noting the callouses and scars, and figures Mowgli is not using magic or demons, having seen a similar case in 30 years of service. Muller also offers Mowgli to join the service, to which Mowgli agrees. Later, Gisborne learns the reason for Mowgli's almost superhuman talents; he was raised by a pack of wolves in the jungle (explaining the scars on his elbows and knees from going on all fours). Mowgli marries the daughter of Gisborne's butler, Abdul Gafur. By the end of the story, Mowgli has a son and is back to living with his wolf brothers. Kipling then proceeded to write the stories of Mowgli's childhood in detail in The Jungle Book. Lost by his parents as a baby in the Indian jungle during a tiger attack, he is adopted by the Wolf Mother (Raksha) and Father wolf Rama, who call him Mowgli (frog) because of his lack of fur and his refusal to sit still. Shere Khan the tiger demands that they give him the baby but the wolves refuse. Mowgli grows up with the pack, hunting with his brother wolves. In the pack, Mowgli learns he is able to stare down any wolf, and his unique ability to remove the painful thorns from the paws of his brothers is deeply appreciated as well. Bagheera, the black panther, befriends Mowgli because both he and Mowgli have parallel childhood experiences; as Bagheera often mentions, he was \\"raised in the King's cages at Oodeypore\\" from a cub, and thus knows the ways of man. Baloo the bear, teacher of wolves, has the thankless task of educating Mowgli in \\"The Law of the Jungle\\". Shere Khan continues to regard Mowgli as fair game, but eventually Mowgli finds a weapon he can use against the tiger ‚Äì fire. After driving off Shere Khan, Mowgli goes to a human village where he is adopted by Messua and her husband, whose own son Nathoo was also taken by a tiger. It is uncertain if Mowgli is actually the returned Nathoo, although it is stated in \\"Tiger! Tiger!\\" that the tiger who carried off Messua's son was similar to the one that attacked Mowgli's parents. Messua would like to believe that her son has returned, however, she herself realises that this is unlikely. While herding buffalo for the village, Mowgli learns that the tiger is still planning to kill him, so with the aid of two wolves, he traps Shere Khan in a ravine where the buffalo trample him. The tiger dies and Mowgli sets to skin him. After being accused of witchcraft and cast out of the village, Mowgli returns to the jungle with Shere Khan's hide and reunites with his wolf family. In later stories in The Jungle Book's sequel, The Second Jungle Book, Mowgli learns that the villagers are planning to kill Messua and her husband for harboring him. He rescues them and sends elephants, water buffaloes, and other animals to trample the village and its fields to the ground. Later, Mowgli finds and then discards an ancient treasure (\\"The King's Ankus\\"), not realising it is so valuable that men would kill to own it. With the aid of Kaa the python, he leads the wolves in a war against the dhole (\\"Red Dog\\"). Finally, Mowgli stumbles across the village where his adopted human mother (Messua) is now living, which forces him to come to terms with his humanity and decide whether to rejoin his fellow humans in \\"The Spring Running\\". Play adaptations Rudyard Kipling adapted the Mowgli stories for The Jungle Play in 1899, but the play was never produced on stage. The manuscript was lost for almost a century. It was published in book form in 2000.The Jungle Play: UK paperback edition: Influences upon other works Only six years after the first publication of The Jungle Book, E. Nesbit's The Wouldbegoods (1899) included a passage in which some children act out a scene from the book. Mowgli has been cited as a major influence on Edgar Rice Burroughs who created and developed the character Tarzan. Mowgli was also an influence for a number of other \\"wild boy\\" characters. Poul Anderson and Gordon R. Dickson used the Mowgli stories as the basis for their humorous 1957 science fiction short story \\"Full Pack (Hokas Wild)\\". This is one of a series featuring a teddy bear-like race called Hokas who enjoy human literature but cannot quite grasp the distinction between fact and fiction. In this story, a group of Hokas get hold of a copy of The Jungle Book and begin to act it out, enlisting the help of a human boy to play Mowgli. The boy's mother, who is a little bemused to see teddy bears trying to act like wolves, tags along to try to keep him (and the Hokas) out of trouble. The situation is complicated by the arrival of three alien diplomats who just happen to resemble a monkey, a tiger and a snake. This story appears in the collection Hokas Pokas! (1998) and is also available online. Mowgli stories by other writers The Third Jungle Book (1992) by Pamela Jekel is a collection of new Mowgli stories in a fairly accurate pastiche of Kipling's style. Hunting Mowgli (2001) by Maxim Antinori is a very short novel which describes a fateful meeting between Mowgli and a human hunter. The Jungle Book: Last of the Species (2013) by Mark L Miller is a series of comic books that tells the story of a female Mowgli who unintentionally started a war between animal tribes after killing Shere Khan to avenge the fallen members of the wolf tribe.

The word is derived from the Greek word organon, which means tool or instrument, musical instrument, and organ. Types There are a variety of legal types of organizations, including corporations, governments, non-governmental organizations, political organizations, international organizations, armed forces, charities, not-for-profit corporations, partnerships, cooperatives, and educational institutions etc. A hybrid organization is a body that operates in both the public sector and the private sector simultaneously, fulfilling public duties and developing commercial market activities. A voluntary association is an organization consisting of volunteers. Such organizations may be able to operate without legal formalities, depending on jurisdiction, including informal clubs or coordinating bodies with a goal in mind which they may express in the form of an manifesto, mission statement, or in an informal manner reflected in what they do because remember every action done by an organization both legal and illegal reflects a goal in mind. Organizations may also operate secretly or illegally in the case of secret societies, criminal organizations and resistance movements. And in some cases may have obstacles from other organizations (ex: MLK's organization) but what makes an organization an organization is not the paperwork that makes it official but to be an organization there must be four things: # A goal in mind # A leader or committee making the decision # action involved # communication and members. But what makes an organization recognized by the government is either filling out Incorporation (business) or recognition in the form of either societal pressure (ex: Advocacy group), causing concerns (ex: Resistance movement) or being considered the spokesperson of a group of people subject to negotiation (ex: the Polisario Front being recognized as the sole representative of the Sahawri people and forming a partially recognized state.) Compare the concept of social groups, which may include non-organizations. Compare: Structures Diagram of the Federal Government and American Union, 1864. The study of organizations includes a focus on optimising organizational structure. According to management science, most human organizations fall roughly into four types: * Committees or juries * Ecologies * Matrix organizations * Pyramids or hierarchies = Committees or juries = These consist of a group of peers who decide as a group, perhaps by voting. The difference between a jury and a committee is that the members of the committee are usually assigned to perform or lead further actions after the group comes to a decision, whereas members of a jury come to a decision. In common law countries, legal juries render decisions of guilt, liability and quantify damages; juries are also used in athletic contests, book awards and similar activities. Sometimes a selection committee functions like a jury. In the Middle Ages, juries in continental Europe were used to determine the law according to consensus among local notables. Committees are often the most reliable way to make decisions. Condorcet's jury theorem proved that if the average member votes better than a roll of dice, then adding more members increases the number of majorities that can come to a correct vote (however correctness is defined). The problem is that if the average member is subsequently worse than a roll of dice, the committee's decisions grow worse, not better; therefore, staffing is crucial. Parliamentary procedure, such as Robert's Rules of Order, helps prevent committees from engaging in lengthy discussions without reaching decisions. = Ecologies = This organizational structure promotes internal competition. Inefficient components of the organization starve, while effective ones get more work. Everybody is paid for what they actually do, and so runs a tiny business that has to show a profit, or they are fired. Companies who utilize this organization type reflect a rather one-sided view of what goes on in ecology. It is also the case that a natural ecosystem has a natural border - ecoregions do not, in general, compete with one another in any way, but are very autonomous. The pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline talks about functioning as this type of organization in this external article from The Guardian. By:Bastian Batac De Leon. = Matrix organization = This organizational type assigns each worker two bosses in two different hierarchies. One hierarchy is \\"functional\\" and assures that each type of expert in the organization is well-trained, and measured by a boss who is super-expert in the same field. The other direction is \\"executive\\" and tries to get projects completed using the experts. Projects might be organized by products, regions, customer types, or some other schemes. As an example, a company might have an individual with overall responsibility for products X and Y, and another individual with overall responsibility for engineering, quality control, etc. Therefore, subordinates responsible for quality control of project X will have two reporting lines. The United States aerospace industries were first to officially use this organizational structure after it emerged in the early 1960s. = Pyramids or hierarchical = A hierarchy exemplifies an arrangement with a leader who leads other individual members of the organization. This arrangement is often associated with basis that there are enough imagine a real pyramid, if there are not enough stone blocks to hold up the higher ones, gravity would irrevocably bring down the monumental structure. So one can imagine that if the leader does not have the support of his subordinates, the entire structure will collapse. Hierarchies were satirized in The Peter Principle (1969), a book that introduced hierarchiology and the saying that \\"in a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.\\" Theories In the social sciences, organizations are the object of analysis for a number of disciplines, such as sociology, economics, political science, psychology, management, and organizational communication. The broader analysis of organizations is commonly referred to as organizational structure, organizational studies, organizational behaviour, or organization analysis. A number of different perspectives exist, some of which are compatible: * From a functional perspective, the focus is on how entities like businesses or state authorities are used. * From an institutional perspective, an organization is viewed as a purposeful structure within a social context. * From a process- related perspective, an organization is viewed as an entity is being (re-)organized, and the focus is on the organization as a set of tasks or actions. Sociology can be defined as the science of the institutions of modernity; specific institutions serve a function, akin to the individual organs of a coherent body. In the social and political sciences in general, an \\"organization\\" may be more loosely understood as the planned, coordinated and purposeful action of human beings working through collective action to reach a common goal or construct a tangible product. This action is usually framed by formal membership and form (institutional rules). Sociology distinguishes the term organization into planned formal and unplanned informal (i.e. spontaneously formed) organizations. Sociology analyses organizations in the first line from an institutional perspective. In this sense, organization is an enduring arrangement of elements. These elements and their actions are determined by rules so that a certain task can be fulfilled through a system of coordinated division of labor. Economic approaches to organizations also take the division of labor as a starting point. The division of labor allows for (economies of) specialization. Increasing specialization necessitates coordination. From an economic point of view, markets and organizations are alternative coordination mechanisms for the execution of transactions. An organization is defined by the elements that are part of it (who belongs to the organization and who does not?), its communication (which elements communicate and how do they communicate?), its autonomy (which changes are executed autonomously by the organization or its elements?), and its rules of action compared to outside events (what causes an organization to act as a collective actor?). By coordinated and planned cooperation of the elements, the organization is able to solve tasks that lie beyond the abilities of the single elements. The price paid by the elements is the limitation of the degrees of freedom of the elements. Advantages of organizations are enhancement (more of the same), addition (combination of different features) and extension. Disadvantages can be inertness (through co-ordination) and loss of interaction. Among the theories that are or have been influential are: *Activity theory is the major theoretical influence, acknowledged by de Clodomir Santos de Morais in the development of Organization Workshop method. *Actor‚Äìnetwork theory, an approach to social theory and research, originating in the field of science studies, which treats objects as part of social networks. *Complexity theory and organizations, the use of complexity theory in the field of strategic management and organizational studies. *Contingency theory, a class of behavioural theory that claims that there is no best way to organize a corporation, to lead a company, or to make decisions. *Critical management studies, a loose but extensive grouping of theoretically informed critiques of management, business, and organization, grounded originally in a critical theory perspective *Economic sociology, studies both the social effects and the social causes of various economic phenomena. *Enterprise architecture, the conceptual model that defines the coalescence of organizational structure and organizational behaviour. *Garbage Can Model, describes a model which disconnects problems, solutions and decision makers from each other. *Principal‚Äìagent problem, concerns the difficulties in motivating one party (the \\"agent\\"), to act in the best interests of another (the \\"principal\\") rather than in his or her own interests *Scientific management (mainly following Frederick W. Taylor), a theory of management that analyses and synthesizes workflows. *Social entrepreneurship, the process of pursuing innovative solutions to social problems. *Transaction cost theory, the idea that people begin to organize their production in firms when the transaction cost of coordinating production through the market exchange, given imperfect information, is greater than within the firm. *Weber's Ideal of Bureaucracy (refer to Max Weber's chapter on \\"Bureaucracy\\" in his book Economy and Society) Leadership A leader in a formal, hierarchical organization, is appointed to a managerial position and has the right to command and enforce obedience by virtue of the authority of his position. However, he must possess adequate personal attributes to match his authority, because authority is only potentially available to him. In the absence of sufficient personal competence, a manager may be confronted by an emergent leader who can challenge his role in the organization and reduce it to that of a figurehead. However, only authority of position has the backing of formal sanctions. It follows that whoever wields personal influence and power can legitimize this only by gaining a formal position in the hierarchy, with commensurate authority. =Formal organizations= An organization that is established as a means for achieving defined objectives has been referred to as a formal organization. Its design specifies how goals are subdivided and reflected in subdivisions of the organization. Divisions, departments, sections, positions, jobs, and tasks make up this work structure. Thus, the formal organization is expected to behave impersonally in regard to relationships with clients or with its members. According to Weber's definition, entry and subsequent advancement is by merit or seniority. Each employee receives a salary and enjoys a degree of tenure that safeguards him from the arbitrary influence of superiors or of powerful clients. The higher his position in the hierarchy, the greater his presumed expertise in adjudicating problems that may arise in the course of the work carried out at lower levels of the organization. It is this bureaucratic structure that forms the basis for the appointment of heads or chiefs of administrative subdivisions in the organization and endows them with the authority attached to their position. =Informal organizations= In contrast to the appointed head or chief of an administrative unit, a leader emerges within the context of the informal organization that underlies the formal structure. The informal organization expresses the personal objectives and goals of the individual membership. Their objectives and goals may or may not coincide with those of the formal organization. The informal organization represents an extension of the social structures that generally characterize human life ‚Äì the spontaneous emergence of groups and organizations as ends in themselves. In prehistoric times, man was preoccupied with his personal security, maintenance, protection, and survival. Now man spends a major portion of his waking hours working for organizations. His need to identify with a community that provides security, protection, maintenance, and a feeling of belonging continues unchanged from prehistoric times. This need is met by the informal organization and its emergent, or unofficial, leaders. Leaders emerge from within the structure of the informal organization. Their personal qualities, the demands of the situation, or a combination of these and other factors attract followers who accept their leadership within one or several overlay structures. Instead of the authority of position held by an appointed head or chief, the emergent leader wields influence or power. Influence is the ability of a person to gain cooperation from others by means of persuasion or control over rewards. Power is a stronger form of influence because it reflects a person's ability to enforce action through the control of a means of punishment. = The interplay between formal and informal organizations = As most organizations operate through a mix of formal and informal mechanisms, organization science scholars have paid attention to the type of interplay between formal and informal organizations. On the one hand, some have argued that formal and informal organizations operate as substitutes as one type of organization would decrease the advantages of using the other one. For instance, if parties trust each other the use of a formal contract is unnecessary or even detrimental to the relationship. On the other hand, other scholars have suggested that formal and informal organizations can complement each other. For instance, formal mechanisms of control can pave the way for the development of relational norms.

In some cases, when the Church has initiated the dispute, questions have been raised as to its motives. The Church says that its use of the legal system is necessary to protect its intellectual property and its right to freedom of religion. Critics say that most of the Church's claims are designed to harass Suppressive Persons, people who impede the progress of the Scientology movement. In the years since its inception, the Church of Scientology's lawsuits filed against newspapers, magazines, government agencies (including the United States tax collecting unit, the IRS), and individuals have numbered in the thousands. In 1991, Time magazine estimated that the Church spends an average of about $20 million per year on various legal actions, and it is the exclusive client of several law firms. According to a U.S. District Court Memorandum of Decision in 1993, Scientologists \\"have abused the federal court system by using it, inter alia, to destroy their opponents, rather than to resolve an actual dispute over trademark law or any other legal matter. This constitutes 'extraordinary, malicious, wanton, and oppressive conduct.' ... It is abundantly clear that plaintiffs sought to harass the individual defendants and destroy the church defendants through massive over-litigation and other highly questionable litigation tactics. The Special Master has never seen a more glaring example of bad faith litigation than this.\\" RTC v. Robin Scott, U. S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 85-711-JMI (Bx) 85-7197-JMI (Bx), January 20, 1993, Memorandum of Decision Rulings such as this have classified the Church of Scientology as a chronically vexatious litigant. Legal disputes initiated by Scientology against its former members, the media or others include the following: * Religious discrimination cases, including recognition as a religious organization. * Copyright infringement cases. Scientology's religious documents are copyrighted, and many are available only to members who pay for higher levels of courses and auditing. * Libel and slander cases. In the past, the Church has been involved in criminal court cases (e.g. United States v. Hubbard), but increasingly, lawsuits are being brought by former Church members against the Church, such as: * Human Trafficking and Forced Labor (Claire and Mark Headley v. Church of Scientology, Int'l) * Fraud and Misrepresentationhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10626116 California couple sues over donations to Scientology, The Guardian, January 23, 2013 (accessed on February 22, 2013) * Libel (e.g. Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto). The Church's view Scientologists say that the church's main goal is to be recognized as a religion, which on occasion has met resistance from opponents (including national governments), and this has forced it to have recourse to the courts. One such area is recognition as an official religion in various governments around the world. Scientology's path to legal recognition as a religion in New Zealand took 48 years and several lawsuits. Other efforts have had less success. In 1999, the United Kingdom rejected an application for charity status and the attendant tax benefits. The Charity Commission (November 17, 1999).

International Religious Freedom Report 2006, U.S. State Department The activities of the Church of Scientology are not prohibited or limited in any way in the European Union and Scientology enjoys the full freedom of any church in these countries. Some governments, however, have labeled the church as a cult. Although the status is not changed or the freedom is not limited, German and Belgian government entities have accused Scientology of violating the human rights of its members and therefore called it a \\"totalitarian cult\\" and a \\"commercial enterprise\\". In 1995, a parliamentary report in France classified it, along with 172 other religious groups, as a \\"dangerous cult.\\" French National Assembly Report of the Board of Inquiry into Cults (1995-12-22, in French, English translation available) In Russia, the government had refused to consider the church for registration as a religious organization, which became the subject of proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Church of Scientology Moscow v. Russia. The court decided that Russia's refusal to consider the Church of Scientology's application for registration as a religious community \\"had been a violation of Article 11 (freedom of assembly and association) of the European Convention on Human Rights read in the light of Article 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion).\\" L. Ron Hubbard and lawsuits Critics state that the ultimate aim of Scientology lawsuits is to destroy church opponents by forcing them into bankruptcy or submission, using its resources to pursue frivolous lawsuits at considerable cost to defendants. In doing so, they draw particular attention to certain controversial statements made by the church's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, in the 1950s and 1960s. Original (18M) In 1994, Scientology attorney Helena Kobrin was fined $17,775 for filing a frivolous lawsuit. U.S. District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema cited a frequently quoted statement of L. Ron Hubbard on the subject in the case of Religious Technology Center vs. The Washington Post, on November 28, 1995: Critics also allege that the Church uses litigation as a cover for intimidation tactics, such as investigating the criminal records (or lack thereof) of opponents and subjecting them to surveillance and invasive inquiries, both to discourage further criticism and to ensure the opponent's unwillingness to fight the lawsuit. A policy letter by L. Ron Hubbard, distributed in early 1966, says: > This is correct procedure: # Spot who is attacking us.'' # Start > investigating them promptly for FELONIES or worse using own professionals, > not outside agencies. # Double curve our reply by saying we welcome an > investigation of them. # Start feeding lurid, blood sex crime actual > evidence on the attackers to the press. Don't ever tamely submit to an > investigation of us. Make it rough, rough on attackers all the way. Attacks > on Scientology by L. Ron Hubbard, \\"HCO Policy Letter of 15 February 1966\\" Critics of Scientology cite this passage, among others (such as the widely documented Fair Game doctrine), to support their contentions that the church uses smear tactics to augment the effectiveness of legal threats. Scientology court cases Grand jury charges from the case of United States of America v. Mary Sue Hubbard (DDC, 1979). Notable Scientology court cases include the following: =Cases before the European Court of Human Rights= * On April 5, 2007, the Church of Scientology of Moscow won a judgment against the Russian government establishing its right to recognition as a religious organization. The European Court held that the government's refusal of registration \\"... had no lawful basis... the Moscow authorities did not act in good faith and neglected their duty of neutrality and impartiality vis-√†-vis the applicant's religious community.\\".

The church sued Armstrong for providing confidential documents about L. Ron Hubbard to Armstrong's attorney. The court found that Armstrong's actions were justifiable and affirmed this conclusion in Church of Scientology v. Gerald Armstrong.Wikisource:Church of Scientology v. Armstrong Armstrong settled his counter-claims with the church in December 1986 for $800,000 in exchange for his agreement to keep confidential his experience with the church. The church sued Armstrong for $10.5 million in 1995 and 2002 for allegedly violating the confidentiality agreement in 131 instances. A California appellate court awarded the church $321,923 in damages and $334,671.75 in attorneys fees in 1995, and $500,000 in damages in 2004. The court noted that \\"Armstrong makes no claim that he has complied, or will ever comply, with the injunction\\" and that Armstrong claims to now reside in Canada. Church of Scientology v. Superior Court, not reported in Cal.Rptr.3d (Cal.App. 1 Dist.), ¬∂¬∂2‚Äì7 s:Church of Scientology International v. Superior Court * From the time its tax exemption was removed by the IRS in 1967 to the reinstatement of the tax exemption in 1993, Scientologists filed approximately 2,500 lawsuits against the IRS. Over fifty lawsuits were still active against the IRS in 1993, although these were settled after the church negotiated a tax exemption with the government. * The Cult Awareness Network (CAN) was driven into bankruptcy in 1996 in part by a number of Scientology-related lawsuits. As the TV news program 60 Minutes reported in 1997, Scientologists filed over fifty lawsuits against the non-profit organization, which spent over $2 million on its legal defense. After one court handed down a judgment of $1 million against CAN, the organization filed for bankruptcy and auctioned off its assets, which were purchased for $20,000 by a lawyer affiliated with Scientology. * In May 1991, Time magazine published a cover story on Scientology entitled \\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\\". The Church responded by suing Time for $400 million; a five-year legal battle ensued in which Time spent approximately $7 million defending itself in court. The case was eventually dismissed in the magazine's favor. * Scientology has filed lawsuits against a number of Internet users, The Washington Post newspaper, over fifteen various Internet service providers in The Netherlands, and others concerned in the matter of Karin Spaink, a supporter of Arnaldo Lerma and other Internet activists who posted on her Web page excerpts from Scientology's copyrighted scriptures, which are withheld from the general public. This legal case included claims by Scientology that hyperlinks to alleged copyright infringements were also illegal. Spaink's case was taken all the way to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands; however, the Court rejected Scientology's claims in their entirety, including the claims regarding hyperlinks. * In 1998, Scientology (through subsidiary Bridge Publications) sued FACTNet for claimed copyright violations. When federal judge John Kane denied Scientology's request for summary judgment because FACTNet challenged Scientology's ownership of the copyrights of the documents, a settlement was reached in 1999. The terms were that if FACTNet is ever found guilty of violations of church copyrights, they are permanently enjoined to pay the church $1 million. * When the Church was charged with a felony count of practicing medicine without a license in the 1996 case involving the death of Scientologist Lisa McPherson, Florida asked for damages of approximately $15,000 to be awarded against the organization. The Church hired law firms and medical specialists at an estimated cost of over $1 million, waging a defense that eventually resulted in the case being dismissed due to lack of credible evidence. On May 29, 2004, the Church paid an undisclosed amount to settle a wrongful death suit brought on behalf of McPherson's estate. An article on the suit describes legal attacks made by Scientology's attorneys: > Dandar has persevered through a seemingly endless barrage of legal attacks. > There have been nine attempts to disqualify him, and four attempts to remove > Lisa's aunt, Dell Liebreich, as executor of Lisa's estate. Scientology > attorneys have filed bar complaints against both him and Lirot, lawsuits > against Lisa's family, and motions to remove judges and move the case to > other venues. When asked how going up against Scientology compares to normal > litigation, Lirot replied, \\"It's like comparing LSD to orange juice.\\" ... > The wrongful death case went through four judges in seven years. David S. > Touretzky, Razor (Web-based magazine) article, \\"A Church's Lethal Contract,\\" > January 2004 * In the case of Wollersheim vs. Church of Scientology (1980), former member Larry Wollersheim sued the organization for mental distress, and was awarded $30 million in damages. On appeal, the award was reduced to $2.5 million.Wikisource:Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology In 1996, Wollersheim was awarded an additional $130,506.71 in attorney's fees incurred while defending against a church lawsuit that was dismissed for violating a California law prohibiting strategic lawsuits against public participation. The Church vowed not to pay the award, and the case dragged through the courts for 22 years, including two separate appeals to the Supreme Court of the United States and two additional appeals to the Supreme Court of California. In early 2002, the case was finally settled, with the Church of Scientology paying Larry Wollersheim $8,674,643. * In Religious Technology Center v. Gerbode, 1994 WL 228607 (C.D. Cal. 1994) (against Frank A. Gerbode, inventor of Traumatic Incident Reduction), a Rule 11 sanction of $8,887.50 was imposed against Helena Kobrin, an attorney for the Church, for bringing baseless and frivolous claims.Wikisource:Religious Technology Center v.

Church of Scientology International, Laura DeCrescenzo sued the organization for forcing her to illegally work 14 hour days at age 12 and coercing her to get an abortion at age 17. Scientology settled with DeCrescenzo three weeks before the case went to trial. =Cases in the UK= * Bonnie Woods, a former member who began counseling people involved with Scientology and their families, became a target along with her husband Richard in 1993 when the Church of Scientology started a leaflet operation denouncing her as a \\"hate campaigner\\" with demonstrators outside their home and around East Grinstead. She and her family were followed by a private investigator, and a creditor of theirs was located and provided free legal assistance to sue them into bankruptcy.

During the case, it was shown that a file had been kept on him as an \\"Enemy Canada.\\" In their decision (1995), the Supreme Court of Canada found: > In this case, there was ample evidence upon which the jury could properly > base their finding of aggravated damages. The existence of the file on Casey > Hill under the designation \\"Enemy Canada\\" was evidence of the malicious > intention of Scientology to \\"neutralize\\" him.

Ron Hubbard, creator of Scientology, was convicted for illegal business practices, namely, making false claims about his ability to cure physical illnesses. He was sentenced to four years in prison, which was never served. * In 2009, a case went to trial in France, after a woman claims to have been pressured into paying ‚Ç¨21,000 ($29,400) to the Church of Scientology for lessons, books and medicines for her poor mental state accused the Church of Scientology of \\"organised fraud\\". Her lawyers argue that the church systematically seeks to make money through mental pressure and use scientifically dubious cures. \\"Scientology on trial in France\\", BBC, May 25, 2009 Coincidentally, a large scale simplification of the laws in France occurred just prior to the beginning of the trial. Suspicion was raised as the new law revision forbids the dissolution of a legal entity, an unadvertised change among hundreds of others. Dissolution was the main sentence requested by the prosecutor against the Church of Scientology in this trial, becoming unlawful as the law changed. On October 27, 2009, a verdict was rendered: six members of the CoS in France, and the Church itself, were convicted of fraud. Four of these, including Alain Rosenberg, were given suspended prison sentences. The Scientology Celebrity Center in Paris, a Scientology bookstore, and all six individual convicts were ordered to pay fines. The plaintiff's request for dissolution of the Church was not fulfilled.

As of the 2010 census, the population of the town is 519, up from 491 in 2000. the mayor currently is Mayor Gary Livingston. History Originally called Cowhead, the town began to be settled in 1820, just a year after Alabama achieved statehood. William J. Rook began a Post Office in Cowhead in 1883; however, it was closed a month later. According to local lore, at a community meeting, the town received its current name Eva in October 1883 at the suggestion of a local physician, Dr. Lewis Keller, who had just delivered a beautiful baby girl by that name, Eva Brandon. He liked that name because like the girl, the town was just getting started. After discussion, the community agreed upon the name Eva because the town needed a new name as a prerequisite for establishing a new post office. It was not until 1887 that the town's name was officially changed from Cowhead. In 1916, Mr. Wiley Steward, local saw mill owner, donated 5 acres of land to the town, for the construction of a new school. In 1918, using donations from the local community, Eva gazed with admiration upon a beautiful new four room schoolhouse. Nevertheless, as time went by, the need for higher educational training for the community was realized. In an effort spearheaded by local physician, Dr. J. G. Daves, later deemed, \\"the father of Eva School\\", in the 1920s a community campaign was set forth to raise the necessary funds to build another school. Even the Great Depression could not hold this thriving community down from its dream of higher education for its children. It was a community undertaking, but the fairy tale dream of a resolute community was realized in 1930, when Eva became a proud possessor of an accredited high school and held graduation exercises with a senior class composed of three members. The community forged ahead and in its desire to add to the curriculum of the school, through local donations, added a vocational agriculture building, elementary building, and in 1938, completed a large stone gymnasium. Eva School became a stunning campus with great educational opportunities provided to its students, through the vision of the community. In 1972, with the opening of Albert P. Brewer High School in Florette, Eva High School was consolidated into this new east regional Morgan County High School facility. In 1996, the Morgan County Board of Education, through a capitol funds campus upgrade, demolished the old school buildings, excluding the gymnasium that was constructed in 1985 and old lunchroom building, constructed in the mid 1960s. The campus was rebuilt, with a beautiful new modern K-8 building. Today, Eva School, as it has done for a century, continues to serve as source of pride for the Eva Community.

As of the 2010 census, the population of the city is 3,686, up 4.8% over 2000. First known as Muckle Ridge, the city was renamed after a hero of the American Revolution, Francis Marion. Due its accommodation of two colleges, Judson College and Marion Military Institute, Marion is often referred to as \\"The College City\\". A nickname that adorns the city's welcome sign. Marion is the 152nd most populous city in the state of Alabama, of 573 cities. History =Early history= Formerly the territory of the Creek Indians, it was founded shortly after 1819 as Muckle Ridge. The city was renamed in honor of Francis Marion, the \\"Swamp Fox,\\" hero of the American Revolutionary War, in 1822. It incorporated as a town the same year and also became the second county seat after the hamlet of Perry Ridge was unsuitable. In 1829, it upgraded from a town to a city. From the very early days, Marion created considerable history for a small town on the western frontier of Alabama. The old City Hall (1832) is but one of many antebellum public buildings, churches, and homes in the city today. General Sam Houston, while between terms as 1st and 3rd President of the Republic of Texas, married Margaret Lea of Marion in the city in 1840. At the 1844 meeting of the Alabama Baptist State Convention in Marion, the \\"Alabama Resolutions\\" were passed. This was one of the factors that led to the 1845 formation of the Southern Baptist Convention in Augusta, Georgia. =Founding of colleges= Judson College was founded in 1838 and Marion Military Institute after Howard College moved in 1887. Howard College, initially the location of the current Marion Military Institute, was founded in Marion in 1841, and moved to Birmingham in 1887, later becoming Samford University. A groundbreaking school for African Americans, the Lincoln Normal School, was founded here in 1867. The associated Lincoln Normal University for Teachers moved to Montgomery and became Alabama State University. In 1889, Marion Military Institute was chartered by the State of Alabama and today is the oldest military junior college in the nation. =Pre-Civil War= In December 1857, Andrew Barry Moore (1807-1873) of Marion was elected the sixteenth Governor of Alabama (1857-1861). After serving one term where he presided over Alabama's secession from the Union, he assisted in the war effort, was imprisoned a short time after the war and in ill health returned to Marion where he died eight years later. George Doherty Johnson (May 30, 1832 ‚Äì December 8, 1910) served as mayor of Marion in 1856, state legislator from 1857-58 and rose to the rank of brigadier general in the Confederate States Army in the American Civil War. =Civil War era= Leading up to the Civil War Nicola Marschall (1829-1917), a German-American artist, is generally credited with designing both the first official Confederate flag and the grey Confederate army uniform while a teacher at the old Marion Female Seminary. With the coming Civil War in 1861, Nicola Marschall was approached in February by Mary Clay Lockett, wife of prominent attorney Napoleon Lockett of Marion, and her daughter, Fannie Lockett Moore, daughter-in-law of Alabama Governor Andrew B. Moore of Marion, to design a flag for the new Confederacy. Marschall offered three designs, one of which became the \\"Stars and Bars,\\" the first official flag of the Confederate States of America (C.S.A.), and which was first raised in Montgomery, Alabama, on March 4, 1861. =Early 20th century= At the turn of the century in 1900, Perry County peaked in population at 31,783 or three times the population of the county in 2010 census. In 1909, Marion became the county seat. Hal Kemp, a jazz alto saxophonist, clarinetist, bandleader, composer, and arranger. was born in Marion in 1904 and died in Madera, California, following an auto accident in 1940. His major recordings were \\"There's a Small Hotel\\", \\"Where or When\\", \\"This Year's Kisses\\", \\"When I'm With You\\", \\"Got a Date With an Angel\\" and \\"Three Little Fishies\\". His band was very popular from 1934 until 1939. In 1936, he was number one for two weeks with \\"There's a Small Hotel\\" and two weeks with \\"When I'm With You\\". In 1937, his number one hits were \\"This Year's Kisses\\", which was number one for four weeks, and \\"Where or When\\", which was number one for one week. In 1992, Hal Kemp was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame. Coretta Scott King, wife of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., was born in Marion in 1927 and spent her childhood there. She graduated from Lincoln Normal School as valedictorian in 1945. The couple got married on the front lawn of her mother's home north of Marion in 1953. =Civil Rights era= A number of significant events occurred in Marion relating to the Civil Rights Movement. In 1958 Jimmy Wilson, a black man, was sentenced to death by a jury in Marion for stealing $1.95 from Estelle Barker.Dudziak, Mary L., \\"The Case of 'Death for a Dollar Ninety-Five: Finding America in American Injustice\\" , University of Southern California Law School, 2007, p.5 Wilson's case became an international cause c√©l√®bre, covered in newspapers worldwide and inspiring over 1000 letters per day to the office of governor Jim Folsom. Finally, after the Alabama Supreme Court upheld Wilson's conviction, at the urging of the Congress of Racial Equality, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles wrote to Folsom explaining the damage that the case was doing to the international reputation of the United States and Folsom quickly granted Wilson clemency. In 1964, Marion was a center of civil rights protests in Alabama. During a Southern Christian Leadership Conference march on the evening of February 18, 1965, during the height of the Selma Voting Rights Movement, Marion resident Jimmie Lee Jackson was shot and killed by Alabama State Trooper James Bonard Fowler. These events were depicted in the movie Selma, released in 2014. Jackson died on February 26 of an infection stemming from the wounds at nearby Good Samaritan Hospital in Selma. Martin Luther King Jr. preached a sermon at Jackson's funeral on March 3, and Jackson's death is recognized as the catalyst for James Bevel to call and organize the first Selma to Montgomery March on March 7.\\"James L. Bevel The Strategist of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement\\" by Randy Kryn, a paper in David Garrow's 1989 book We Shall Overcome, Volume II, Carlson Publishing Company It was not until 2007, that Fowler was indicted for murder for his role in Jackson's death. In 2010, Fowler pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter. In 2018, the US Department of the Interior granted Beyond 50 Years ‚Äì a community non-profit group in Marion ‚Äì a $500,00 grant to convert the historic Perry County Jailhouse into a voting rights museum. The historic jailhouse was the location of Reverend James Orange's incarceration, which sparked the 1965 march that resulted in the death of Jimmie Lee Jackson. The jail is currently under renovation for the conversion into a museum, however a grand opening date has not yet been announced. =Recent events= In 2009, Marion made national news when a three-year-old family feud turned into a 150-person riot outside the town's city hall, resulting in the arrest of eight people and the hospitalization of two. In early 2016, the New York Times reported the city was the center of an outbreak of tuberculosis. In 2014-15 twenty people in the area had contracted active cases of the disease and three had died.

At the 2010 census its population was 2,486, down from 2,567 in 2000. Founded in the first decade of the 20th century and incorporated in 1907, the city has become notable for its World War II-era prisoner-of-war camp, Camp Aliceville. Since 1930, it has been the largest municipality in Pickens County.1830-2010 U.S. Censuses research on Pickens County, Alabama communities History Story from the Montgomery Advertiser (September 1, 1907) about a lynching in Aliceville In 1902 the settlement that would become Aliceville was founded with the opening of a single store. The city was named in honor of the wife of John T. Cochrane, founder of the Alabama, Tennessee and Northern Railroad and moving force behind the construction of the short line from Carrollton, Alabama to Aliceville. Within two years of the completion of the short line, Aliceville had grown to what the Montgomery Advertiser called in 1905 \\"a town of considerable pretensions. There are about a dozen stores, a bank, public buildings and numerous enterprises.\\" In 1907 an election was scheduled to allow the citizens of Aliceville to decide whether their community should be incorporated. Incorporation was approved by the voters, and on March 19, 1907, a municipal election was held to choose municipal officers, including a mayor and five aldermen: T.H. Sommerville, J.M. Summerville, A. Hood, J.D. Sanders, W.E. Stringfellow, and J.B. Cunningham, respectively. In August 1907 a black man named Gibson was lynched in Aliceville, which caused civil disturbances in the community. Rumors swirled that \\"the negroes were arming themselves,\\" and a group of blacks on horseback were fired on in the street. Gibson's father was subsequently \\"ordered to leave the county on account of some impertient (sic) talk.\\" By March 1908, municipal officials had decreed that all streets should have ten-foot sidewalks built on both sides. Property owners were to be responsible for building the sidewalks in front of their parcels. This work, along with the paving of the streets, was largely completed by June 1910 and the city began considering the installation of water and electricity. =Camp Aliceville= During World War II, a Prisoner-of-war camp was set up in Aliceville to hold 6,000 German prisoners, most from the Afrika Korps, although the population of the camp rarely exceeded 3,500. The camp operated between June 2, 1943 and September 30, 1945. Prisoners were brought to the camp via the St. Louis ‚Äì San Francisco Railway. The only remaining trace of the camp is an old stone chimney. However, there is a German POW collection at the Aliceville Museum and Cultural Arts Center which retains documentation from the camp including maps, photographs, camp publications, letters, and artwork. Ingleside house in Aliceville, June 1937 =Civil rights movement= 1960 During the civil rights movement, organizing in small communities such as Aliceville was often more dangerous for activists than it was in larger cities because of their isolation. As late as 1965, according to James Corder, a Primitive Baptist minister from Aliceville, Pickens County had not yet experienced any civil unrest related to the movement. Jordan was inspired by the Selma to Montgomery marches in March of that year to organize a civil rights group in Aliceville, which he called the \\"Rural Farm and Development Council\\" in order to avoid scrutiny. The group organized protests at the Aliceville city hall to oppose officially sanctioned racism in the city. In September 1969 black students held protests against the principal of an all- black school in Aliceville, prompting governor Albert Brewer to send National Guard troops into the city. Two of the city's all-black schools were closed on September 4 due to the demonstrations, and they reopened the next day under National Guard supervision. 1970s and 1980s In 1982, Aliceville native Maggie Bozeman testified at Congressional hearings held in Montgomery, Alabama, concerning proposed amendments to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. She testified that as late as 1980 in Aliceville and Pickens County voting took place in the open rather than in private booths and that white police officers were stationed in polling places, taking photographs of people who assisted black voters. This revelation outraged Republican congressman Henry Hyde, who had previously been unconvinced of the necessity of amending the law. Bozeman's testimony followed her 1979 arrest, conviction, and sentencing for vote fraud. Bozeman and fellow political activist Julia Wilder of Olney, Alabama were given \\"the sternest sentences for a vote fraud conviction in recent Alabama history\\": five years for Wilder and four for Bozeman. The sentences were upheld on appeal, prompting the formation of an organization, the National Coalition to Free Julia Wilder and Maggie Bozeman and Save the Voting Rights Act, and a march through Aliceville from Carrollton, Alabama, to Montgomery to publicize their cause. The United States Department of Justice sent eight poll-watchers to Aliceville to observe the 1984 primary election runoffs following reports from observers of the July 1984 main primaries. =And after= In November 2013 three tanker cars carrying crude oil exploded when an Alabama and Gulf Coast Railway train derailed near Aliceville.

An information display showing code-shared flights (indicated by multiple flight numbers in a single time slot), at Fukuoka Airport. A codeshare agreement, also known as codeshare, is a business arrangement, common in the aviation industry, in which two or more airlines publish and market the same flight under their own airline designator and flight number (the \\"airline flight code\\") as part of their published timetable or schedule. Typically, a flight is operated by one airline (technically called an \\"administrating carrier\\"As defined in IATA Standard Schedules Information Manual) while seats are sold for the flight by all cooperating airlines using their own designator and flight number. The term \\"code\\" refers to the identifier used in a flight schedule, generally the two-character IATA airline designator code and flight number. Thus, XX224 (flight number 224 operated by the airline XX), might also be sold by airline YY as YY568 and by ZZ as ZZ9876. Airlines YY and ZZ are in this case called \\"marketing airlines\\" (sometimes abbreviated MKT CXR for \\"marketing carrier\\"). Most of the major airlines today have code sharing partnerships with other airlines, and code sharing is a key feature of the major airline alliances. Typically, code-sharing agreements are also part of the commercial agreements between airlines in the same airline alliances. History In 1967, Richard A. Henson joined with US Airways predecessor Allegheny Airlines in the nation's first codeshare relationship. The term \\"code sharing\\" or \\"codeshare\\" was coined in 1989 by Qantas and American Airlines,Financial Review, November 21, 1989 and in 1990 the two firms provided their first codeshare flights between an array of Australian cities and U.S. domestic cities. Code sharing has become widespread in the airline industry since then, particularly in the wake of the formation of large airline alliances. These alliances have extensive codesharing and networked frequent flyer programs. Terminology Under a code sharing agreement, the airline that administers the flight (the one holding the operational permissions, airport slots and planning/controlling the flight and responsible for the ground handling services) is commonly called the operating carrier, often abbreviated OPE CXR, even though the IATA SSIM term \\"administrating carrier\\" is more precise. The reason for this is that a third carrier may be involved, typically in the case that the airline originally planning to operate the flight needs to hire a subcontractor to operate the flight on their behalf (typically a wet lease, meaning an aircraft is leased with crew and all facilities to fly, commonly due to capacity limitations, technical problems etc.) In this case, the airline carrying the passenger should be designated the operating carrier, since it is the one carrying the passengers/cargo. When a flight is sold under several designators and flight numbers as described above, the one published by the \\"Administrating carrier\\" is commonly called a \\"prime flight\\" (as opposed to a codeshare marketing flight). Reasons and advantages Under a code sharing agreement, participating airlines can present a common flight number for several reasons, including: =For passengers= * Connecting flights: This provides clearer routing for the customer, allowing a customer to book travel from point A to C through point B under one carrier's code, instead of a customer booking from point A to B under one code, and from point B to C under another code. This is not only a superficial addition as cooperating airlines also strive to synchronize their schedules. =For airlines= * Flights from both airlines that fly the same route: this provides an apparent increase in the frequency of service on the route by one airline. * Perceived service to non-serviced markets: this provides a method for carriers who do not operate their own aircraft on a given route to gain exposure in the market through display of their flight numbers. Types of code sharing There are several types of code sharing arrangements: * Block space codeshare: A commercial (marketing) airline purchases a fixed number of seats from the administrating (operating/prime) carrier. A fixed price is typically paid, and the seats are kept away from the administrating carrier's inventory. The marketing airline decides on its own which booking classes the seats are sold in (the block of seats are optimised just like another aircraft cabin). * Free flow codeshare: The airlines' inventory and reservation systems communicate in real-time by messaging, commonly IATA AIRIMP/PADIS messaging (TTY and EDIFACT). A booking class mapping is defined between the airlines. No seats are locked to any of the airlines, and any airline can sell any number of seats. * Capped free flow: Basically the same as above, but a capping (maximum number of seats) are defined for each of the marketing airlines participating in the codeshare with the administrating carrier. Competitive concerns Much competition in the airline industry revolves around ticket sales (also known as \\"seat booking\\") strategies (revenue management, variable pricing, and geo-marketing). Criticism has been leveled against code sharing by consumer organizations and national departments of trade since it is claimed it is confusing and not transparent to passengers. Air-rail alliances There are also code sharing arrangements between airlines and railway companies, formally known as air- rail alliances, and commonly marketed as \\"Rail & Fly\\" due to the popularity of the Deutsche Bahn codeshare with many airlines. They involve some integration of both types of transport, e.g., in finding the fastest connection and allowing the transfer between plane and train using a single ticket. This allows passengers to book a whole journey at the same time, often for a discounted price compared to separate tickets.

The city is the county seat of Pike County. It was formally incorporated on February 4, 1843. Between the years of 1763 and 1783, the area where Troy sits was part of the colony of British West Florida.The Economy of British West Florida, 1763‚Äì1783 by Robin F. A. Fabel (University of Alabama Press, 2002) After 1783 the region fell under the jurisdiction of the newly created United States of America. As of the 2010 census, the population was 18,033. The 2019 estimated population was 18,957. The City of Troy is considered one of the fastest growing cities in Alabama. Troy is a college town and is home to Troy University, the fourth- largest university in total enrollment in the state of Alabama. History =Pre-Civil War= A map from 1767 of British West Florida, including the area where present-day Troy is. For many centuries, the area in and around Troy was settled by different tribes of Native Americans, but became primarily known for its Muskogee Creek presence. Most Creek tribes lived along rivers or streams at that time. Near the Troy area, many Native Americans settled around the Conecuh River and the Pea River. Between the years of 1763 and 1783, the area where Troy would eventually be established was part of the colony of British West Florida. After 1783 the region fell under the jurisdiction of the newly created United States of America. In 1819 the State of Alabama was admitted to the Union and was soon organized into counties. The county that Troy was eventually founded in, known as Pike County, was one of the first counties established in Alabama. It comprised a large tract of country, so large that it was called the \\"State of Pike\\", which included parts of what are now Crenshaw, Montgomery, Macon, Bullock, and Barbour counties, and extended to the Chattahoochee River on the east. After Pike County's borders were resized, the land that would later become Troy was settled in the early 1830s. Originally known as Deer Stand Hill (an Indian hunting ground) which was first settled about 1824, it was later known as Zebulon and then Centreville before being renamed Troy in 1838. Troy became the county seat that same year after a new county courthouse was built in the city, replacing the previous county seat town of Monticello. The court met in local stores until the courthouse was built in 1839. In 1880, this structure was torn down and rebuilt as an opera house, which was also eventually torn down. A brick courthouse was erected in 1880. A hotel and taverns along with small mercantile stores were soon created, quickly making the new town the social center of the county. Unfortunately, the town of Troy completely burned down in 1901 after a devastating fire, and had to be rebuilt. The courthouse, originally in the center of the town square, was demolished because of fire damage and relocated one block away just outside of the town square. To promote movement of settlers and to speed mail from Washington City to New Orleans, the Federal Road was laid out after 1805. In 1824, a military road was laid out from Fort Barrancas in Pensacola, Florida and ran on top of the ridges to Fort Mitchell in Russell County, Alabama, and connected to The Federal Road. Captain Daniel E. Burch of the U.S. Army marked the route using three notches on trees for a crew under Lt. Elias Phillips to follow. The route was eventually cleared in 1824 at a cost of $1,130. It follows the ridge dividing the water sheds of the Conecuh River to the northwest, and the Yellow River and Pea River to the southeast. This road became known as the Three Notch Road and ran through Troy and Pike County. While never being highly needed as a military supply road, it became a boon to the settlers who used it to move into south-central and southeast Alabama and into northwest Florida. During this time, tensions began to rise between the local Creek Indians and the European settlers that were moving into the area. As settlers began to force their way onto Creek lands and push the Indians out, the Creeks began to retaliate; first in small factions, then in larger factions. During this time, the Second Indian War was beginning to rage in the Southeastern United States. Battle of Hobdy's Bridge On February 10, 1837, the Battle of Hobdy's Bridge occurred after a force of over 100 American militiamen under Captain Jack Cooper intercepted about 75 Creek Indians making their way to Florida. After locating the site of the Creek camp, the militia divided into two groups to converge on the refugees by surprise. A brief fight ensued upon their approach, which centered around two fallen trees the Creeks had used as a natural breastwork. The creeks, being extremely low on ammunition, fired nails instead of bullets from the muskets they possessed. The militiamen eventually overran their position and captured the camp, wherein they found items recently plundered from area plantations. Exact casualties are unknown, but it is believed four or five Creeks and perhaps one American were killed. Though stripped of their supplies, the Creeks managed to continue their flight even as they continued to skirmish with other American troops. Near the Florida border, they retaliated by killing two American settlers. Battle of Pea River In of the last battles of the Second Creek War, on March 27, 1837, the Battle of Pea River occurred roughly 17 miles to the east of Troy, where the Pea River and Pea Creek converge near Hobdy's Bridge. A force of over 250 combined Alabama and Georgia militiamen led under General William Wellborn tracked a party of about 400 Creek fugitives that included men, women, and children. The Creeks, angry that the land that had been promised to them was being taken from them by local settlers by violent force, responded by burning local homes and plantations along the Pea River swamp. The Three Notch Trail that traversed through Troy was also considered dangerous at this point, as local Creek Indians around the area were turning violent and burning and looting houses along the stretch. The path of the Creeks had become easy to find due to the several looted and burned plantations they had left behind them as they moved south. After finding their temporary camp in a nearby swamp, General Wellborn divided his command into two wings to encircle the Creeks. He personally commanded one wing, and placed the other under Colonel Jefferson Buford. The Creeks detected the approach, however, and attacked and scattered Buford's wing. When Wellborn's command neared the camp, trudging through waist-high water, gunfire could be heard erupting further down the river. Wellborn ordered his men through the mud and water at a full run. Upon encountering the Creeks downstream, a fierce four-hour battle began on opposite sides of a nearby lagoon. The Creek warriors, many of whom were later found to have been using bullets made of melted pewter plates, made several unsuccessful charges on the militia's line before being overrun. Records from some of the participants in the battle reported that some of the Creek women and children also took up arms to fight, raining showers of rifle balls and arrows on the militiamen. In one case, two of the Creek women attacked a member of the militia with knives. Unable to defeat the desperate Creeks with gunfire alone, Wellborn finally ordered a direct charge on their lines. The tactic worked as many of the Creeks fled to their encampment to carry off their children, some even swimming the river to flee. The fighting then devolved into a massacre in which at least fifty Creek men, women and children were killed and an unknown number captured. The Creek survivors continued their flight south in small groups. According to some reports, some of the captured Creeks were enslaved by local planters. Only five Americans were killed, among them General Wellborn's teenage son, James H. Wellborn. In winning the Battle of Pea River & Pea Creek, Wellborn had defeated the refugee Creeks but had failed to surround and capture all of them as he had hoped. Instead they fled south down the Pea River to its confluence with the Choctawhatchee and continued across the line into Florida. Furious at their treatment, they continued to battle the whites for years to come. =During Civil War= At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the small village of Troy had a population of around 600. The 57th Alabama Infantry Regiment of Troy was formed in 1863. The group of soldiers from that regiment fought at the Battle of Peachtree Creek on July 20, 1864. Troy was mostly spared from the ravages of the war, except that its sons were dying on battlefields throughout the South. On April 26, 1865, a brigade of Union cavalry under the command of General Benjamin Henry Grierson camped outside of Troy. These soldiers moved on to Louisville, Clayton and Eufaula the next day without incident. However, roughly 20 miles east of Troy at the Pike County border, the Skirmish at Hobdy's Bridge, what some consider the last battle of the Civil War, took place on May 19, 1865. Skirmish at Hobdy's Bridge A detachment of Union soldiers from the 1st Florida U.S. Cavalry had been sent from Montgomery to Eufaula to escort a mail shipment through the unsettled regions of eastern Alabama. General Robert E. Lee had already surrendered and Wilson's Raid had just devastated the region, but there were still many former Confederate soldiers were drifting through the region trying to get home, which presented a threat. A mail escort, commanded by Lt. Joseph Carroll of the Union Army, left Montgomery on May 11, 1865, and reached Eufaula without difficulty. The total strength of the detachment was only 25 men, but because all seemed quiet, Carroll decided to spend a few days in Eufaula to rest his horses. Since some of his men were natives of the area, he granted them short leaves to go and visit their families. The entire detachment was to reassemble at Hobdy's Bridge over the Pea River on May 19, 1865. After many of his men dispersed to their homes, however, Carroll learned that a party of pro-Confederate \\"guerrillas\\" had been seen in the area. The identity of this unit, if it had an identity, is unknown, but at about the same time General Alexander Asboth in Pensacola reported that several companies of cavalry made up of \\"unrepentant rebels\\" were still active in the Alabama and Florida borderlands. Upon receiving this intelligence, Carroll decided to return to Montgomery as quickly as possible and crossed Hobdy's Bridge with the main body of his detachment two days before the appointed rendezvous. The other men of his command, at home and visiting their families, had no way to know of his decision to leave early or of the danger they faced. According to military records, the remaining Union soldiers gathered at Hobdy's Bridge as ordered on the morning of May 19, 1865, only to learn that Carroll and the main body were already gone. Turning their horses onto the long wooden bridge over Pea River, the cavalrymen started off to follow their commander's route. Unfortunately, they rode straight into a group of Confederate rebel guerillas. Three Union soldiers were wounded in the fight, and one Confederate soldier was killed. The lone soldier killed in the Skirmish at Hobdy's Bridge was identified as Corporal John W. Skinner of Company C, 1st Florida U.S. Cavalry. He was killed in action six days after Private John J. Williams of the 34th Indiana, who died at Battle of Palmito Ranch and is generally said to have been the last man killed in the Civil War. That sad distinction actually belongs to Corporal Skinner, who died on the wooden planks of Hobdy's Bridge in Alabama. =Post-Civil War= The old Troy Post Office(built 1920); now the Johnson Center for the Arts An original Carnegie Library (built 1908) located in Historic Downtown Troy; now the Troy City Hall Historic College Street During the Reconstruction Era after the end of the Civil War, Troy began to see new railroads and roads converging into the city. After the completion of the Mobile & Girard Railroad in 1870, Troy saw a quick spike in population. One of the many to have made the journey to Troy was Jeremiah Augustus \\"Gus\\" Henderson. Having owned a large store in nearby Gainers Store (now known as Henderson), he found it difficult to transport and receive shipments by wagon. In 1869, Henry moved his mercantile store to nearby Troy to be closer to the Mobile and Girard Railroad. One of his sons, Charles Henderson, would soon be the governor of Alabama and a large contributor to Troy. Troy would see a quick period of growth in the following years. There was rapid growth outside of the Troy downtown square, consisting of factories, churches, stores, and Victorian-style houses. Many of the early houses, churches, and cemeteries dating back to this era can still be found in the College Street Historic District, just on the edge of Historic Downtown Troy. Many of the buildings in the 2-block area date from as early as the 1870s. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 13, 1976. In 1887, a group of local educators and prominent citizens of Troy joined together to acquire a state normal school (teacher training school) for Troy. Thanks mostly to the efforts of Ariosto A. Wiley, a powerful state senator who was born in Troy, the city won the education prize over Lowndesboro, Alabama, which had also wanted a normal school. The school, which was to be known as Troy Normal School, was eventually constructed and completed in 1887 in downtown Troy on a four-acre campus. This school, which went on to become Troy University, had a stormy early history and was lucky to have survived in its cramped downtown location. Its survival was assured when the third president of the college, Edward Madison Shackelford, led the movement from downtown to its present site starting in 1924. In 1929, the name was changed to Troy State Teacher's College. The name was again changed in 1957 to Troy State College to reflect the expanded educational offerings of the school. The college would undergo yet another name change in 1967, being called Troy State University until reaching its current namesake, Troy University, in 2005. During the late 1800s into the early 1900s, Troy experienced steady growth thanks to the multiple factories, railroads, and the college. Geography Troy is located at (31.808768, ‚àí85.969951).

At the 2010 census the population was 4,197. History Columbiana, originally called Columbia, was selected as the county seat of Shelby County in 1826 over rivals Calera and Montevallo. After the selection as the county seat, Columbiana celebrated by drilling holes in a large pine tree and packing it with gunpowder. The tree was blown up and the sound could be heard for miles. Later in 1826, the courthouse was moved to an old school building in Columbiana. An act of the Alabama Legislature officially changed the name of Shelby County's county seat to Columbiana on January 13, 1832. Columbiana was incorporated on December 5, 1837 with corporate limits one-quarter of a mile in each direction from the public square. In 1854, the decision was made to build a larger courthouse at the south end of ‚ÄúSilk Stocking Road‚Äù, now Main Street. From 1854 to 1908 several additions and changes were made to the courthouse. During the American Civil War, Columbiana was connected to the nearby town of Shelby by the Shelby Iron Company Railroad, which connected the Shelby Iron Works to the Alabama and Tennessee River Railroad. The Iron Works supplied iron to the C.B. Churchill and Company foundry, which moved to Columbiana in 1862 after the fall of Corinth, Mississippi. The Churchill foundry made eight and ten pound shot, eight and ten pound shells, and shells for Blakely rifles. The C.B. Churchill and Company foundry, Shelby Iron Works and the railroad were destroyed by Union forces on March 31, 1865, as part of Wilson's Raid. Moving the courthouse to Columbiana was not necessarily popular in 1826 and there have been numerous attempts to relocate the county seat over the years. In 1901, the Alabama Constitutional Convention addressed the issue by including Section 41 in the new state constitution. Section 41 prohibited a move of the Shelby County seat from Columbiana unless a vote of the people was held, the only county in Alabama with such a designation. To further solidify Columbiana's claim to the county seat, in 1905 construction began two blocks north of the existing courthouse on a new marble courthouse at a cost of $300,000. The new courthouse was completed in 1908 and has been renovated and enlarged on a number of occasions. The new courthouse has served Shelby County for over 100 years. The ‚ÄúOld Courthouse‚Äù is now home to the Shelby County Museum and Archives. Today, Columbiana is home to the Shelby County Board of Education, the Shelby County Sheriff's Office, the Shelby County Jail, and Harrison Regional Library, which is the main office for the Shelby County Library System. Columbiana holds the annual Liberty Day celebration on the last weekend in June, which was first held in 1986 to honor the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty. The current mayor is Dr. Stancil Handley. The population of Columbiana was 4,647 as of 2017. Geography Columbiana is located at (33.183545, -86.609365).

He ranks among the most influential medieval historians of the twentieth century and was one of France's most prominent public intellectuals from the 1970s to his death. Born to a family of Proven√ßal craftsmen living in Paris, Duby was initially educated in the field of historical geography before he moved into history. He earned an undergraduate degree at Lyon in 1942 and completed his graduate thesis at the Sorbonne under Charles-Edmond Perrin in 1952. He taught first at Besan√ßon and then at the University of Aix-en-Provence before he was appointed in 1970 to the Chair of the History of Medieval Society in the Coll√®ge de France. He remained attached to the Coll√®ge until his retirement in 1991. He was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1987. Impact of the M√¢connais book Although Duby authored dozens of books, articles and reviews during his prolific career‚Äîfor academic as well as popular audiences‚Äîhis reputation and legacy as a scholar will always be attached to his first monograph, a published version of his 1952 doctoral thesis entitled La soci√©t√© aux XIe et XIIe si√®cles dans la r√©gion m√¢connaise (Society in the 11th and 12th centuries in the M√¢connais region). La soci√©t√© exerted a profound influence on medieval scholarship in the second half of the twentieth century, placing the study of medieval feudal society on an entirely new footing. Working from the extensive documentary sources surviving from the Burgundian monastery of Cluny, as well as the dioceses of M√¢con and Dijon, Duby excavated the complex social and economic relationships among the individuals and institutions of the M√¢connais region, charting a profound shift in the social structures of medieval society around the year 1000. Duby argued that in early eleventh century, governing institutions‚Äîparticularly comital courts established under the Carolingian monarchy‚Äîthat had represented public justice and order in Burgundy during the ninth and tenth centuries receded and gave way to a new feudal order wherein independent aristocratic knights wielded power over peasant communities through strong-arm tactics and threats of violence. The emergence of this new, decentralized society of dynastic lords could then explain such later eleventh-century phenomena as the Peace of God, the Gregorian reform movement and the Crusades. Following upon this, Duby formulated a famous theory about the Crusades: that the tremendous response to the idea of holy war against the Muslims can be traced to the desire of disinherited (but well-armed) second and third sons of this French parvenue aristocracy to make their fortunes by venturing abroad and settling in the Levant. While Duby's theory had long-lasting influence, later scholars such as Jonathan Riley-Smith have done much to discredit it, arguing that there was no large-scale shortage of land in Western Europe at the time, that knights actually lost money going on crusade, and that lay religious sentiment was their primary motivation. Duby's intensive and rigorous examination of a local society based on archival sources and a broad understanding of the social, environmental and economic bases of daily life became a standard model for medieval historical research in France for decades after the appearance of La soci√©t√©. Throughout the 1970s and 80's, French doctoral students investigated their own corners of medieval France, Italy and Spain in a similar way, hoping to compare and contrast their own results with those of Duby's M√¢connais and its thesis about the transformation of European society at the end of the first millennium. Although he was never formally a student in the circle of scholars around Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre that came to be known as the Annales School, Duby was in many ways the most visible exponent of the Annaliste tradition, emphasizing the need to place people and their daily lives at the center of historical inquiry.  Histoire des mentalit√©s  Duby was also a pioneer in what he and other Annaliste historians in the 1970s and 80's came to call the \\"history of mentalities\\", or the study of not just what people did, but their value systems and how they imagined their world. In books like The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined and The Age of Cathedrals, Duby showed how ideals and social reality existed in dynamic relationship to one another. His distilled biographical essay on William Marshal set the knight's career in the context of feudal loyalties, honour and the chivalric frame of mind. Duby's interest in the idea of historical \\"mentalities\\" extended to thinking about the position of contemporary society vis-a-vis its past. In Le Dimanche de Bouvines (1973) on the pivotal 1214 battle of Bouvines, Duby chose not to analyze the battle itself, but the ways it had been represented and remembered over time and the role its memory had played in the formation of French ideas about its medieval past. The book remains a classic of Annales-style historiography, eschewing the \\"great man\\" and event-oriented theories of political history in favor of asking questions about the evolution of historical perceptions and ideas over the long term, the longue dur√©e. Duby also wrote frequently in newspapers and popular journals and was a regular guest on radio and television programs promoting historical awareness and support for the arts and social sciences in France. He served as the first director of Soci√©t√© d'√©dition de programmes de t√©l√©vision (aka La Sept), a French broadcast network dedicated to educational programming. His last book, L'histoire continue (History Continues) (1991; Engl. trans. 1994), is an intellectual autobiography. In it, Duby stresses the importance of the historian as a public figure who can make the past relevant and exciting to those in the present.

He became the first county judge and later state senator. His log cabin stands in the city center. Philip Coleman originally owned the land on which the town stands, but he sold 30 acres to the five county commissioners, which included Ash, who was appointed by Gov. Thomas Bibb to establish a new county seat for St. Clair. It was designated the county seat in 1821 and the village incorporated in 1822. The first courthouse, also a log structure, was built two years later. It was replaced in 1844 with the current courthouse building.

The tornado also destroyed hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of property including homes, livestock, timberland, and farm equipment. Rescuers from neighboring communities immediately responded after the twister swept through the valley; however, due to the abundance of fallen timber blocking the roads and the remoteness of the community, many victims were forced to wait hours before aid could arrive. Following the devastation, Governor Robert Bentley visited the community along with officials from the Alabama Emergency Management Agency and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The community received both federal and state disaster aid for several weeks following the destructive tornado. With numerous families in the community left without homes, they were forced to seek shelter in hotels and homes of family members. Local police instituted a curfew as well as various home protection policies to insure that what property was left was taken care of.

Clay donated land for the railroad right-of-way, built mainly by the people he enslaved. As the town was settled, the post office became known as Cuba Station. The Town of Cuba was incorporated in 1890 with Dr. A.L. Vaughan as its first mayor. In 1870, Mr. Clay sold to Mr. Warner Lewis half of the town and divided it into lots, with two set aside for the building of the Baptist and Methodist churches. Cuba Baptist Church was organized in 1879; the original building still stands on the spot where it was first built. The Methodist Church was organized about 1884. This church membership dissolved many years ago. The Holiness Church was organized about 1886, the Presbyterian Church about 1906, and the Independent Holiness Church about 1925. Mrs. Curtis Vaughan was the first person to be buried in Cuba, in 1888. Mr. R.A. Clay, the morning after her death, donated the land for the Cuba Cemetery, which later became Clay Memorial Cemetery in his honor. Geography Cuba is located at (32.433782, -88.371776).

Chemical Waste Management landfill Emelle is home to the largest hazardous waste landfill in the United States, called the ‚ÄúCadillac of Landfills‚Äù, owned by Chemical Waste Management, Inc. This town of just a few dozen residents, became a center for controversy on environmental racism.Bullard, Robert D. \\"Environmental Racism in the Alabama Black Belt.\\" Environmental Justice Resource Center (2000): n. pag. Web. 26 April 2010. . Environmental racism is the idea that the majority of the nation‚Äôs hazardous chemical wastes are landfilled in African American, Hispanic and Native American communities. In 1978, Chemical Waste Management purchased a landfill permit of near Emelle in Sumter County. In Sumter County, one-third of the residents live below poverty level, which makes it one of the country's most impoverished regions. Over 90 percent of the residents near the landfill are Black, which to some qualifies this as environmental racism.WIQ1725. \\"More minorities live around Emelle site Study finds disproportionate number of minorities around several of nation's biggest toxic facilities.\\" Mobile Register (AL) 26 August 1994, AM, B: 1.

Currently, the company is working on defining an environmental image by participating in many recycling projects. Regulatory agencies are groups responsible for environmental protection that want to establish facilities that can handle the nation's waste safely. Examples include the Alabama Department of Environmental Management and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Alabamians for a Clean Environment (ACE) is a grassroots environmental group who wants to close down Chemical Waste Management. White women (such as Kaye Kiker) and their husbands formed the group.Setterberg, Fred, and Lonny Shavelson. Toxic Nation: The Fight to Save Our Communities from Chemical Contamination. 1st ed. New York: John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1993. 216-245. Print. Residents and other concerned citizens held a demonstration in Emelle against the Chemical Waste landfill. This demonstration was based on the struggle in Warren County, North Carolina, where the idea of environmental racism and the need for environmental justice emerged. The Emelle demonstration marked the first time that blacks and whites in Sumter County joined together in a public protest over any political issue. Alabamians for a Clean Environment used techniques such as sign waving and name calling to draw attention to their cause. They also had access to the media and Attorney General Jimmy Evans, who became a powerful actor in their cause. Soon they attracted national attention and gained support from larger partisan organizations such as the National Toxics Fund Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes, the National Toxics Fund Campaign, the Sierra Club and Greenpeace. They did not achieve their goal of shutting down Chemical Waste Management. =Economic background= Emelle is located in the Black Belt soil region in Alabama. During the Civil War, this city played a large role in Alabama‚Äôs cotton plantation economy and about half of the residents were slaves. Cotton production kept the Black population in poverty and continued their dependence on the white man. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 brought changes to Emelle, and Blacks were elected to public office in 1978. Soon the economy began to change as government and business elites were the main people affecting land-use decisions. A general theme arose of polluting industries coming into poor minority communities where local community leaders had no input. The environmental risks were traded for jobs. Key local leaders supported Chemical Waste Management, as the counties budgets were increased $5.00 for every ton of waste buried in the county.\\"The governor's proposed fee on hazardous waste is really - political pollution. This time he's doing - Environmental demagoguery.\\" Anniston Star, The (AL) 17 January 1990, Editorials: NewsBank. Web. 26 April 2010.

History =18th century= Epes has its origins in Fort de Tombecb√© (Fort Tombecbe), one of the major fortifications built under Louis XIV of France, in what is now the American south, in the early eighteenth century. In January 1736, Jean- Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, governor of Louisiana, recruited a Swiss officer serving with the French, Joseph Christophe de Lusser, to construct a fort on the Tombigbee River, \\"atop an 80-foot bluff to support his campaign against the Chickasaws\\" that was to proceed in the year following; Bienville visited the site in April of the same year, and took control of the construction, leading to its completion and its support of his martial efforts against the Native Americans. After a 26-year stay, during which the French used this and other holdings to check \\"westward expansion by the British into the French colony of Louisiana,\\" and to serve \\"as a trading post, solidifying France's relations with the Choctaws... the most powerful French ally in the area,\\" the French ceded the fort, with most of its North American territory, to Great Britain under the Treaty of Paris, surrendering Tombecb√© in November 1763; the British inspected and renamed it Fort York, although its actual inhabitation would await a recurrence of hostilities between the Choctaw and Creek Indians in 1766. Records of those overseeing the fort in this period document the challenge of supplying such a remote location, and after a 1768 truce ended the hostilities between the Choctaw and Creeks, the British abandoned Fort York, with Choctaws being the remaining inhabitants of the area until this tribe ceded a small parcel of land that included the fort to the Spanish in 1792/1793, under the Treaty of Boucfouca. (about the Tombigbee River and Juan de la Villebeuvre). As little of the original fortification structures remained when Spain arrived to take control in 1794, the Spanish chose to construct \\"a smaller but more substantial earthen structure\\" (rather building further wooden fortifications); they renamed the site and their resulting structure Fort Confederacion, in recognition of the alliance the Spanish had struck with Native American groups to assist them in resisting encroachment by commerce and settlements from the United States. Fortifications were completed before the beginning of 1796, in time to provide support to the Spanish when war broke out with the United States, and when hostilities began again between the Chickasaw and Creek Indians; the Treaty of San Lorenzo, between Spain and the young U.S., ended that part of the hostilities, and ceded Spanish territory \\"above the 31st parallel,\\" including the Fort, to the U.S, \\"thus marking the end of the European colonial era in Alabama.\\" =19th and 20th centuries= Epes was incorporated in 1899 and named for Dr. John W. Epes, who donated the right-of-way for Southern Railroad (if the town would be named Epes). The town is located on the high bluffs of the Tombigbee River. Standing on the bluffs, you could hear the ferries and steamboats traveling down river. During its prime, it was known as the transportation and business and service center.

History The area now known as Livingston was part of the traditional territory of the nation of Choctaw Indians until the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830. The federal government removed most of the Choctaw to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma. At that time, settlers from the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia established the first European-American community about two blocks from the current Courthouse Square, near the corner of Madison and Spring Streets. In 1833, a commission was formed to organize Sumter County. Livingston was named after a well-known statesman and jurist of the day, Edward Livingston. Livingston was chosen as the county seat. Soon followed the first newspaper, The Voice of Sumter; four schools (including Livingston Female Academy, now The University of West Alabama), the courthouse, and the Bored Well. The first courthouse was built of logs. It was replaced by a frame courthouse in 1839, which burned in 1901. The Probate Judge's office, built at the same time, survived the fire. It now houses the county commission office. In the latter part of the nineteenth century, Livingston became widely known as a health spa because of the water from its Bored Well, one of many that made extensive settlement possible in the Black Belt. This well was bored by an old blind mule which pulled an auger around until an artesian aquifer was reached in 1857. Promoters built a Chinese-styled pagoda over the wall. In 1924 the pagoda was replaced by the predecessor to the present pavilion. During the early part of the twentieth century, Livingston continued to be known as a health resort. It was also the site of the Alabama Normal School, which developed from the Livingston Female Academy and was established to train teachers for the public school system founded during the Reconstruction era. Reflecting its expanding programs and level of curriculum, the name of the college was later changed to the State Teachers College, then to Livingston State College, Livingston University and finally to The University of West Alabama. Livingston continued as the sleepy county seat of a mainly rural county, with a declining population. In the early 1960s, citizens made an effort to revitalize the town, building on their historic heritage and main street. The results were a near doubling in population in ten years, and corresponding increase in industry and businesses. In 1972 Livingston was named a finalist in the \\"All American Cities Competition\\", sponsored by The Saturday Evening Post. =Historic sites= Livingston has a number of historic sites and properties. Lakewood (1840) is a historic antebellum mansion occupied by Julia Tutwiler while she was president of Livingston Normal College. The Sumter County Courthouse (1902) is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Additionally, the Branch-Stuart Home (1903), Inge-Moon House (1834), St. James Episcopal Church (1840), and Voss-Pate House (1850) are all listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage.

Incorporated in 1910 to keep neighboring Sylacauga from annexing it, it was officially disincorporated after its population dwindled to zero effective December 31, 2001. History The history of the town goes back to 1830 when Dr. Edward Gantt discovered white marble and was one of the first towns in the county. A block of marble from the area is in the Washington Monument. The 1930 census showed a population of 542 but the Great Depression and dwindling demand for marble used in building construction began the towns decline. In 1940 the population was 456 and by 1973 it was down to 63 residents. According to the 1990 U.S. Census, the incorporated town of Gantt's Quarry had a population of seven. When the town was first established, the town was governed by a mayor, a five-member city council, and the odd citizen out served as the town clerk. Company housing was set up for the employees. By the late 1960s, the company that owned the Quarry decided to demolish the company owned houses and this forced the residents to move to other towns and communities. The town had its own post office, which also served as a library. The post office is pictured below. It was moved from the Quarry to its new location behind the B.B. Comer Museum in Sylacauga. By the time of the 2000 Census, the town shows a population of zero, and much of it appears to have been annexed into the city of Sylacauga. Preventing such an annexation was most likely the reason the town incorporated in the first place.

Geography The town of Oak Grove is located at (33.189772, -86.303163). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. Oak Grove is a suburb of the city of Sylacauga. The two municipalities are contiguous, and both run along U.S. Highway 280, which runs from Birmingham, Alabama, southeastward to Columbus, Georgia, and then through Georgia toward Savannah. Oak Grove is southeast of Birmingham and north of Montgomery via U.S. Highway 231. Oak Grove is a hilly town occupying both sides of Landers Hill and Merkle Mountain. There is no town square or downtown. There are numerous businesses along U.S. Highway 280, locally called \\"the four-lane\\", and County Road 511, which was formerly U.S. 280 before construction of the four-lane. In the middle of Oak Grove between its two hills there was a cut-your-own Christmas tree farm which yearly drew hundreds of families to Oak Grove. It was started in 1978 by later Oak Grove Mayor Bloise Zeigler, who operated the farm through 2009. Zeigler grew the official Alabama state Christmas tree, which was displayed at the Alabama Governor's Mansion in 2004.http://www.governorpress.state.al.us/pr/pr-2004-11-30-02-tourmansion.asp The Christmas tree farm was closed in 2010 and donated by the former Mayor to the Town of Oak Grove as a community garden named \\"Comet Grove\\".

Notable events Oak Grove gained national recognition in 1954 when it became the first reported site in the history of the world of a meteor striking a human. Mrs. Ann E. Hodges was on her sofa in her Oak Grove home when something crashed through her roof, striking her on the hip. It turned out to be a meteorite. The incident gained national news coverage, including an appearance by Mrs. Hodges on Gary Moore's TV show, I've Got a Secret. Celebrity participant Henry Morgan guessed the secret. Oak Grove has a \\"Gravity Hill\\" where cars appear to coast uphill, but is actually an optical illusion. The phenomenon has generated news coverage and curiosity seekers. It is on Old Highway 280, now named \\"Gravity Hill Road\\", just off Highway 280 in the western part of Oak Grove toward Childersburg. One native son of Oak Grove was elected to the Alabama Public Service Commission. Jim Zeigler, born in neighboring Sylacauga in 1948 and raised in Oak Grove, won the PSC seat in 1974, becoming the youngest person to hold a state office. He won the seat two years after graduating from the University of Alabama, where he had been elected President of the Student Government Association, defeating the fraternity political party, \\"The Machine\\".

At the 2010 census the population was 12,749. Nicknames for Sylacauga include \\"The Marble City\\", ‚ÄúThe Cog‚Äù, and \\"Alabama‚Äôs Best-Kept Secret\\". Sylacauga is known for its fine white marble bedrock. This was discovered shortly after settlers moved into the area and has been quarried ever since. The marble industry was the first recorded industry in the Sylacauga area. Sylacauga is the site of the first documented case of an object from outer space hitting a person. On November 30, 1954, a piece of what became known as the Hodges Meteorite crashed through the roof of an Oak Grove house, bounced off a radio, and badly bruised Mrs. Ann Hodges, who was taking an afternoon nap. Sylacauga is on the 2010 list of \\"100 Best Communities for Young People\\" by America's Promise Alliance. History Child workers at Central Mills in Sylacauga, 1910. Photo by Lewis Hine. The first historical account of the area comes from de Soto's chroniclers as his expedition traveled south along the east bank of the Coosa River in 1540, encountering the town of Talisi at the edges of the Mississippian-era chiefdoms of Coosa and Tuskaloosa. The inhabitants of the Coosa River Valley were later united as the confederacy of Creek people. Their later encounters with Spanish and French settlers had a significant influence on the history of Sylacauga. Events that occurred among these three groups were partly responsible for the settlement of the village of Chalakagay in 1748 near modern Sylacauga by refugee Shawnee Indians, led by Peter Chartier. In 1759 Chalakagay was listed in the French territorial records as a town inhabited by 50 Shawnee warriors.Jerry E. Clark, The Shawnee, University Press of Kentucky, 1977. A. Glynn Henderson, \\"The Lower Shawnee Town on Ohio: Sustaining Native Autonomy in an Indian \\"Republic\\".\\" In Craig Thompson Friend, ed., The Buzzel about Kentuck: Settling the Promised Land, University Press of Kentucky, 1999; pp. 25-56. Late in the summer of 1836 most of the remaining Native Americans in Alabama were rounded up and forcibly escorted west of the Mississippi River, by United States Army forces under the authorization of the Indian Removal Act. They were forced to cede their land claims in the Southeast to yield to development by European Americans. The name Sy-la-cau-ga is derived from the Indian words Chalaka-ge, which mean \\"The Place of the Chalaka Tribe\\". The city was first incorporated in 1838 as Syllacoga, and again in 1887 as Sylacauga. Several important roads traversed the region as early as the 1830s. Numerous ferries connected communities on opposite sides of the rivers. In 1852, a plank road was built from Montgomery, the capital, to Winterboro, Alabama, passing through Sylacauga. The first railroad through Sylacauga was the Anniston and Atlantic Railroad, completed through here on December 1, 1886. In 1838, the first Sylacauga post office was established, with George Washington Stone as postmaster. He later served as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. The first newspaper, the Sylacauga Argus, started publication in 1887. The paper was printed and edited in Calera by H.G. McCall. Sylacauga's main thoroughfare is Broadway Avenue. The first building on this street was built in 1890 by the Smith Brothers. Known as \\"The Marble City\\", Sylacauga was developed on a solid deposit of what is claimed to be the finest marble in the world. Some of the most beautiful buildings in the country, such as the United States Supreme Court, the Al Jolson Shrine in California, the Woolworth building in Houston, Texas, and many others have been constructed and ornamented with Sylacauga marble. Sylacauga is located slightly to the east of the geographical center of the state of Alabama in Talladega County. The city is roughly southeast of Birmingham, north of Montgomery, and southwest of Anniston, Alabama. =Marble industry= The first recorded discovery of marble was in 1820 by Dr. Edward Gantt, a physician who had accompanied General Andrew Jackson through the area in 1814. Even Gantt probably did not realize the extent of this calcium carbonate deposit. The deposit is part of the \\"Murphy Marble Belt\\", extending by deep. It is the world's largest commercial deposit of madre cream marble. In the 1830s, several quarries were opened in Talladega County and perhaps one in neighboring Coosa County. Using the old Plank Road, the operators shipped marble throughout central Alabama. By 1906, New York interests had bought Gantt's quarry from its Ocala, Florida investors. This site became the center of marble-working activity. An elite town developed in and around this property, later called the Alabama Marble Company. By the start of the 20th century, Sylacauga quarries had an established reputation, and shipments were being made throughout the state. Although structural marble was being produced to some extent, a very lucrative use of marble was found in the steel industry. More and more of the Sylacauga deposits were being blasted and used for fluxing steel. Later dolomite replaced marble in this process. In spite of the approaching depression, the late 1920s and early 1930s were times of spectacular growth for Sylacauga's marble industry. Technology changed the course of the industry when electricity replaced steam. Countless small marble operations had sprung up throughout the years. Facing tough competition, many went out of business or were absorbed by the larger companies, Alabama and Moretti-Harrah. One such significant merger was in 1929 when the Madras Marble Company (formerly Sylacauga Marble Corporation) merged with Moretti-Harrah. In 1935 the Moretti-Harrah Company was sold to B.F. Coggins of Atlanta and T.A. McGahey of Columbus, Mississippi. In 1944 Coggins sold the Sylacauga operation and Columbia Marble Company of North Carolina to McGahey. The Alabama Marble Company remained under its own management until 1963, when it merged with the Georgia Marble Company. The reputation of Sylacauga marble producers was shown by use of their marble on numerous building projects throughout the nation. Alabama Marble Company supplied marble for the 19th-century projects in Washington, DC, the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial. Marble supplied for the Washington monument was so like its Italian counterpart, Carrara marble, that it was placed aside until a confirmation of its origin could be made. Moretti-Harrah, in a 3¬Ω year project shared with Gray-Knox Marble Company of Knoxville, supplied much of the marble for the U.S. Supreme Court building, including 36 massive interior columns measuring 22‚Äô long x 3‚Äô4‚Äù in diameter. Listing all the buildings that use this lustrous stone would be difficult. Other memorable projects are the Dime Savings Bank (New York), the Mercedes-Benz showroom (New York), the Chicago Post Office, the Alabama Archives Building, the Chrysler Mausoleum (New York), and the Al Jolson Shrine (California). Beautiful cream marble from Sylacauga can be found in hotels, offices, mausoleums, memorials and homes across the country. Noted sculptor Gutzon Borglum, creator of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial, sculpted a masterpiece from Alabama marble ‚Äì the bust of Abraham Lincoln. It is located in the rotunda of the nation's Capitol. Borglum commented that the fine texture of Alabama marble enabled him to portray the expression of kindness on Lincoln's face that he had never been able to do with any other stone. By the 1940s endless uses for calcium products extracted from marble deposits became obvious. Calcium was needed for agricultural, pharmaceutical and paint products. Alabama Marble Company had already moved in this direction, having introduced its first Raymond Mill products for animal feed, insecticides, and joint cement materials in 1933. By-products were sold under the name of Alabama Calcium Products. By 1964, the company had completed one of the largest multi-product calcium carbonate plants in the United States, and in 1967 it closed its structural marble plant. Moretti-Harrah chose to continue its structural finishing operations. With increasingly fast and updated precision machinery, it introduced new lines of tile, window sills, and other building products. In addition, Moretti-Harrah expanded operations to include calcium products, entering into a partnership with Thompson-Weinman and Company of Cartersville, Georgia, in 1944. In 1956, Thompson-Weinman expanded its own crushing operation in Sylacauga. Sylacauga Calcium Products was formed as a division of Moretti-Harrah. Thompson, Weinman and Company remained privately owned until 1975, when it was purchased by Cyprus Mines Corporation. In 1979 Cyprus Mines was purchased by Standard Oil Company of Indiana, and it became a subsidiary of Amoco Minerals Company. In 1983 an expansion project of its calcium carbonate facilities was conducted. The expansion involved the installation of additional grinding capacity and new mill facilities to enable increased production. Calcium carbonate, long used as the coating of paper, became an important filler as the paper industry converted from acid-based paper making systems to alkaline systems. In 1988 English China Clays (ECC) International purchased Moretti Harrah, and in 1989 ECC purchased Cyprus Thompson Weinman. Then, Georgia Marble Company purchased Cyprus Thompson Weinman. In 1995, Imetal Group of Paris acquired the Georgia Marble Company, allowing this international company to strengthen its U.S. presence in the white pigments industry. Between 1994 and 1998, Imetal doubled in size; one- third through sales growth and two-thirds through acquisition. In 1999, Imetal acquired ECC. At that time the corporate name was changed to Imerys, to reflect a new minerals processing organization. Geography =Location= The city is located in southern Talladega County.

The first mayor was J.D. Dunn. Daviston was a natural evolution of the opening of Indian lands in 1832. Much of the Federal Horse Path was within Creek Indian lands in 1832. With construction of Chapman Road from West Point, Georgia to Fort Williams, Alabama on the Coosa River, land areas opened up to white settlement. Daviston flourished with improved roads and became a hub of migration. It had grist and saw mills, a blacksmith shop, buggy shop, coffin shop, general mercantile, public well, federal distillery, six saloons or inns, pharmacy, and doctors. The first land deed found was dated 1836 to S.W. Monk. The post office was established in 1853 with John Davis as the first postmaster. The story told over the years is that he used his own name for the town name. When he submitted the name to the government, due to poor penmanship or a mistake, \\"Davis Town\\" became Daviston and has since remained. =Daviston School= In 1883, Walker Allen and his twin, Walter, moved to Daviston. Walker Allen was elected principal of Daviston School. In 1884, a wooden two-story building was started on land given by J.T. Moncus to be called Daviston College.

A third building was constructed in 1923 and received accreditation that year. Lillie Thompson, who graduated in 1916, was the first graduate of Daviston High School. The school closed in 1988.

It incorporated in February 1891.http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-3415 At the 2010 census the population was 2,021, down from 2,071 in 2000. History About 310 million years ago, Carbon Hill was located in a swampy area south of the equator. A number of important fossil discoveries and trackways have been located near Carbon Hill. Carbon Hill, Alabama was settled in 1886 because of coal mining and the railroad. A post office was established in 1887 with John T. Anderson as the first Postmaster. By 1888, the community had grown enough to support the Carbon Hill United Methodist Church. The Galloway Coal Company was responsible for the early development of Carbon Hill. Col. Robert Galloway entered the coal and transfer business in 1863. On May 1, 1890 Galloway bought mines and property on Carbon Hill (as it was then called) from The Kansas City Coal and Coke Company for $130,000. Galloway turned the operation into a commercial success. Other mining companies set up operations after word spread of Galloway's success. On February 1, 1891, the Sheriff of Walker County telegraphed the governor of Alabama requesting fifty soldiers to be dispatched to Carbon Hill. Mayor Anderson wired: \\"There is a lawless mob here. Colored people are shot and driven from home. No arrest made. We need troops.\\" Superintendent B. W. Whitfield of the Carbon Hill Coal and Coke Company was anxious to fire 200 striking miners, and the men had caught word of it. The strikers feared the black citizens would take their jobs. On February 14, 1891, the town of Carbon Hill was incorporated, with John T. Anderson as mayor. February 14 is also known as St. Valentine's Day; the founding fathers wanted the tiny town to be known as The Village of Love and Luck. The notion of coal as luck derives from the cultural traditions of Scotland (where Colonel Galloway was born) - it is also customary and considered lucky in Scotland and the North of England to give coal as a gift on New Year's Day. This occurs as part of First-Footing and represents warmth for the year to come. On May 27, 1917, an F3 tornado hit Carbon Hill, killing 6 people and destroying 200 homes in an area 3 miles wide by 17 miles long. Carbon Hill was \\"especially hard-hit by the Depression,\\" and became known for its \\"savvy utilization of federal resources\\" provided by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Public Works Administration (PWA). Residents used the funding to build a new high school, and made improvements to sewers, sidewalks, and streets. On November 17, 1957 an F4 (max. wind speeds 207-260 mph) tornado 13.2 miles away from the Carbon Hill city center killed 4 people and injured 15 people. An F3 tornado destroyed much of Carbon Hill on November 10, 2002.

It was incorporated in 1897.http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-3297 At the 2010 census the population was 2,095, down from 2,423 in 2000. History Cordova was originally a settlement on the Mulberry Fork of the Black Warrior River called \\"Dent\\" or \\"Dent's Place.\\" The city was dubbed \\"Cordova\\" by Captain Benjamin M. Long in 1859. He named the city after a city in Mexico where he was stationed during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Long himself opened a mercantile shop in the city and helped lure other industries into the city by providing the land necessary for their operations. The company that had the biggest impact on the city was Nashua Manufacturing Company out of Nashua, New Hampshire, who brought in the Indian Head Textile Mills. The mill brought with it many jobs, and as was customary of the day, its own village. The company built over 100 houses in the city, many of which are still standing, and occupied today. The company even built the Indian Head school on the site of present-day \\"Cordova Health and Rehabilitation Center.\\" The mill helped to bring two major railways to the city, which at the time helped connect the city to much of the surrounding area. The mill eventually became its own \\"town\\" and even had its own separate police force. Indian Head Mills was one of the most highly awarded textile mills during World War II. Their products were found to be above all standards set forth by the government by the War Department. The Mill was referred to by the residents as the Cordova Spinners. The same way the mill shaped the city around the turn of the 20th century, it also shaped it upon its closing in the middle of the century, after 1962. Over 800 workers lost jobs, the population declined, and industry slowed, while neighboring Jasper took a strong hold on the county seat as the largest city in the county. =Present-day Cordova= Main Street in 2001, prior to the tornadoes With access to the Gulf of Mexico via the Warrior and Alabama Rivers, two major railways (Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Norfolk Southern), Interstate 22, and the recent addition of BAE Systems, the city is hoping for economic growth.

It destroyed the majority of the historic downtown district, including the city hall, police station, fire station, the old Tallulah Hotel, Piggly Wiggly grocer, People's Bank, and damaged the majority of the central business district beyond repair. The Long Memorial United Methodist Church was also heavily damaged, which had sheltered nearby residents in the basement during the tornado. The city has completed the following recovery projects since the 2011 tornadoes; $1.5 million Piggly Wiggly grocery store, $3.7 million city hall & police station, $2.4 million sewer treatment plant, $1.5 million utility line replacement, and are currently completing a $250,000 fire-station remodel. =2012 Cordova rock burst= On November 19, 2012, Cordova was hit by a minor rock burst that had a body wave magnitude of 2.6.

History The town of Nauvoo was founded in 1888, during the construction of the Northern Alabama Railway, and was formerly a center of coal mining.. An earlier settlement in northwestern Alabama, also called \\"Nauvoo,\\" is marked on the \\"Military map showing the marches of the United States forces under command of Maj. Genl. W. T. Sherman, U.S.A., during the years 1863, 1864, 1865.\\" (St. Louis, Mo.: 1865); but this appears to be a distinct settlement, with the same name, located at a different site. (The community marked as \\"Nauvoo\\" on the 1865 map is located near the Mississippi state line and next to Burleson, in Franklin County; the contemporary town of Nauvoo is located at an entirely different site far to the southeast, in between Kansas, Alabama and Houston, Alabama, on the county line between Walker County and Winston County.) The town grew out of isolated agricultural settlements on the Walker County-Winston County line, which had been known unofficially as Blackwell's Crossing and Ingle Mills (or Ingle's Mill) after prominent local landowners. Railroad construction drove the development of the town center on Joshua Blackwell's property, but he declined to have the new town be named officially in his honor. The local resident Tom Carroll suggested the name \\"Nauvoo,\\" after Nauvoo, Illinois -- a city founded by Mormon prophet Joseph Smith in 1839 and later the site of an Icarian colony settlement -- reportedly \\"because he had admired the [Illinois] town... in his earlier travels through that state.\\" By 1891, the town was mentioned in the Winston Herald as \\"Nauvoo, a flourishing town with three stores and one steam gin doing good business.\\"Quoted in Nauvoo incorporated in 1906.

Four processes (blue lines) compete for one resource (grey circle), following a right-before-left policy. A deadlock occurs when all processes lock the resource simultaneously (black lines). The deadlock can be resolved by breaking the symmetry. In concurrent computing, a deadlock is a state in which each member of a group is waiting for another member, including itself, to take action, such as sending a message or more commonly releasing a lock. Deadlock is a common problem in multiprocessing systems, parallel computing, and distributed systems, where software and hardware locks are used to arbitrate shared resources and implement process synchronization. In an operating system, a deadlock occurs when a process or thread enters a waiting state because a requested system resource is held by another waiting process, which in turn is waiting for another resource held by another waiting process. If a process is unable to change its state indefinitely because the resources requested by it are being used by another waiting process, then the system is said to be in a deadlock. In a communications system, deadlocks occur mainly due to lost or corrupt signals rather than resource contention. Two processes competing for two resources in opposite order. Necessary conditions A deadlock situation on a resource can arise if and only if all of the following conditions hold simultaneously in a system: # Mutual exclusion: At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode. Otherwise, the processes would not be prevented from using the resource when necessary. Only one process can use the resource at any given instant of time. # Hold and wait or resource holding: a process is currently holding at least one resource and requesting additional resources which are being held by other processes. # No preemption: a resource can be released only voluntarily by the process holding it. # Circular wait: each process must be waiting for a resource which is being held by another process, which in turn is waiting for the first process to release the resource. In general, there is a set of waiting processes, P = {P1, P2, ‚Ä¶, PN}, such that P1 is waiting for a resource held by P2, P2 is waiting for a resource held by P3 and so on until PN is waiting for a resource held by P1. These four conditions are known as the Coffman conditions from their first description in a 1971 article by Edward G. Coffman, Jr. While these conditions are sufficient to produce a deadlock on single-instance resource systems, they only indicate the possibility of deadlock on systems having multiple instances of resources. Deadlock handling Most current operating systems cannot prevent deadlocks. When a deadlock occurs, different operating systems respond to them in different non-standard manners. Most approaches work by preventing one of the four Coffman conditions from occurring, especially the fourth one. Major approaches are as follows. =Ignoring deadlock= In this approach, it is assumed that a deadlock will never occur. This is also an application of the Ostrich algorithm. This approach was initially used by MINIX and UNIX. This is used when the time intervals between occurrences of deadlocks are large and the data loss incurred each time is tolerable. Ignoring deadlocks can be safely done if deadlocks are formally proven to never occur. An example is the RTIC framework.https://rtic.rs/0.5/book/en/ =Detection= Under the deadlock detection, deadlocks are allowed to occur. Then the state of the system is examined to detect that a deadlock has occurred and subsequently it is corrected. An algorithm is employed that tracks resource allocation and process states, it rolls back and restarts one or more of the processes in order to remove the detected deadlock. Detecting a deadlock that has already occurred is easily possible since the resources that each process has locked and/or currently requested are known to the resource scheduler of the operating system. After a deadlock is detected, it can be corrected by using one of the following methods: # Process termination: one or more processes involved in the deadlock may be aborted. One could choose to abort all competing processes involved in the deadlock. This ensures that deadlock is resolved with certainty and speed. But the expense is high as partial computations will be lost. Or, one could choose to abort one process at a time until the deadlock is resolved. This approach has high overhead because after each abort an algorithm must determine whether the system is still in deadlock. Several factors must be considered while choosing a candidate for termination, such as priority and age of the process. # Resource preemption: resources allocated to various processes may be successively preempted and allocated to other processes until the deadlock is broken. =Prevention= 380pxthumbnailright (A) Two processes competing for one resource, following a first-come, first-served policy. (B) Deadlock occurs when both processes lock the resource simultaneously. (C) The deadlock can be resolved by breaking the symmetry of the locks. (D) The deadlock can be prevented by breaking the symmetry of the locking mechanism. Deadlock prevention works by preventing one of the four Coffman conditions from occurring. * Removing the mutual exclusion condition means that no process will have exclusive access to a resource. This proves impossible for resources that cannot be spooled. But even with spooled resources, the deadlock could still occur. Algorithms that avoid mutual exclusion are called non-blocking synchronization algorithms. * The hold and wait or resource holding conditions may be removed by requiring processes to request all the resources they will need before starting up (or before embarking upon a particular set of operations). This advance knowledge is frequently difficult to satisfy and, in any case, is an inefficient use of resources. Another way is to require processes to request resources only when it has none; First they must release all their currently held resources before requesting all the resources they will need from scratch. This too is often impractical. It is so because resources may be allocated and remain unused for long periods. Also, a process requiring a popular resource may have to wait indefinitely, as such a resource may always be allocated to some process, resulting in resource starvation. (These algorithms, such as serializing tokens, are known as the all-or-none algorithms.) * The no preemption condition may also be difficult or impossible to avoid as a process has to be able to have a resource for a certain amount of time, or the processing outcome may be inconsistent or thrashing may occur. However, the inability to enforce preemption may interfere with a priority algorithm. Preemption of a \\"locked out\\" resource generally implies a rollback, and is to be avoided since it is very costly in overhead. Algorithms that allow preemption include lock- free and wait-free algorithms and optimistic concurrency control. If a process holding some resources and requests for some another resource(s) that cannot be immediately allocated to it, the condition may be removed by releasing all the currently being held resources of that process. * The final condition is the circular wait condition. Approaches that avoid circular waits include disabling interrupts during critical sections and using a hierarchy to determine a partial ordering of resources. If no obvious hierarchy exists, even the memory address of resources has been used to determine ordering and resources are requested in the increasing order of the enumeration. Dijkstra's solution can also be used.  Livelock  A livelock is similar to a deadlock, except that the states of the processes involved in the livelock constantly change with regard to one another, none progressing. The term was coined by Edward A. Ashcroft in a 1975 paper in connection with an examination of airline booking systems. Livelock is a special case of resource starvation; the general definition only states that a specific process is not progressing. Livelock is a risk with some algorithms that detect and recover from deadlock. If more than one process takes action, the deadlock detection algorithm can be repeatedly triggered. This can be avoided by ensuring that only one process (chosen arbitrarily or by priority) takes action. Distributed deadlock Distributed deadlocks can occur in distributed systems when distributed transactions or concurrency control is being used. Distributed deadlocks can be detected either by constructing a global wait-for graph from local wait-for graphs at a deadlock detector or by a distributed algorithm like edge chasing. Phantom deadlocks are deadlocks that are falsely detected in a distributed system due to system internal delays but do not actually exist. For example, if a process releases a resource R1 and issues a request for R2, and the first message is lost or delayed, a coordinator (detector of deadlocks) could falsely conclude a deadlock (if the request for R2 while having R1 would cause a deadlock).

The population was 2,020 at the 2010 census, down from 2,257 in 2000, at which time it was a town. History What is now Camden was established on property donated by Thomas Dunn from his plantation holdings in order to have a new town founded on the site in 1833 to serve as the county seat. Dunn's Federal style house, built in 1825, is the oldest documented house in the town. The first county seat was in the community of Canton Bend. The county seat was moved in 1833 to Barboursville, later renamed Camden. It had been named Barboursville in honor of United States Congressman Philip Barbour of Virginia. Incorporated in 1841, Camden was renamed by local physician John D. Caldwell in honor of his hometown of Camden, South Carolina. The Camden Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church, completed in 1849. The area depended on cultivation of cotton as a commodity crop, which was worked by numerous African-American slaves. The earliest documented industries in the town were a brickyard, sawmill, and window fabricator. The Camden Phenix was the town's earliest known newspaper. Townspeople founded a girls' school in 1844, the Wilcox Female Seminary and Female Institute, whose red-brick Greek- Revival style building was constructed from 1845‚Äì50. In 1976 the former school was adapted to house the Wilcox County Historical Society. The red-brick Greek-Revival style Wilcox County Courthouse, also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was completed in 1857. It replaced an earlier wood-frame structure. During the American Civil War, many in the community joined the Confederate cause. The county courthouse was ransacked by Union forces in 1865, but advance warning allowed county officials to remove the county records to a safe place (legend claims that they were buried in a coffin) prior to arrival of Union troops. Already devastated by the Civil War, Camden suffered fires during 1869 and 1870 that destroyed about two-thirds of the town. The town began to recover during the 1880s, with the first bank incorporated in 1894. Camden benefited economically during the mid-20th century with the construction of a paper mill at Yellow Bluff and of the Millers Ferry Lock and Dam, a hydroelectric dam on the Alabama River near Millers Ferry. This created the William \\"Bill\\" Dannelly Reservoir, which has served as an important recreational resource. Geography Camden is located at (31.998851, -87.295743).

Addison Precinct/Division (1910-) Addison Census Division, the former 7th precinct of Winston County, first appeared on the 1910 U.S. Census.http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/41033935v1-8ch1.pdf The prior precinct/beat name from 1870-1900 (none reported in 1880) was Looney's Tavern.http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1870a-05.pdf In 1960, Addison precinct was changed to census division as part of a general reorganization of counties.http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37721510v1p2ch2.pdf, 1960 AL Census Addison High School Addison is home to Addison High School, a member of the Winston County School System. The athletic teams of the school are nicknamed the Bulldogs. Addison had the most successful sports program in class 1-A in 2005 winning state championships in football and volleyball. The school has had a competitive football team since coach A.G. Hicks came to Addison in the mid-1950s starting a tradition of teams known for great defense. In 1970 Addison won the state championship, going 13-0, and allowing only one touchdown to be scored against its defense. In 1976 the Bulldogs won their second state football championship under head coach Allen Stephenson. Randy White led the Bulldogs to a third championship in 2005. The volleyball program, under coach Pam Wilkins, won three straight state championships from 2003 to 2005, and was undefeated in 2005. The varsity girls' volleyball program won a 2A state championship in 2009, after being 2A runner-up in 2008. They also won the state volleyball championship for 1A for 2010. The girls won another state championship under Pam Wilkins in 2013. The girls' softball program, led by coach Debbie Thompson, won a state championship in 1996.

Its name is Latin for crab and it is commonly represented as one. Its astrological symbol is‚ôã. Cancer is a medium-size constellation with an area of 506 square degrees and its stars are rather faint, its brightest star Beta Cancri having an apparent magnitude of 3.5. It contains two stars with known planets, including 55 Cancri, which has five: one super-earth and four gas giants, one of which is in the habitable zone and as such has expected temperatures similar to Earth. At the (angular) heart of this sector of our celestial sphere is Praesepe (Messier 44), one of the closest open clusters to Earth and a popular target for amateur astronomers.  Characteristics  Cancer is a medium-sized constellation that is bordered by Gemini to the west, Lynx to the north, Leo Minor to the northeast, Leo to the east, Hydra to the south, and Canis Minor to the southwest. The three- letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is \\"Cnc\\". The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eug√®ne Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 sides (illustrated in infobox). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between and . Covering 506 square degrees or 0.921% of the sky, it ranks 31st of the 88 constellations in size. It can be seen at latitudes between +90¬∞ and -60¬∞ and is best visible at 9 p.m. during the month of March. Cancer Borders the bright constellations of Leo and Gemini and Canis Minor, Under city skies, Cancer is invisible to the naked eye. Features =Stars= Cancer is the second dimmest of the zodiacal constellations, having only two stars above the fourth magnitude. The German cartographer Johann Bayer used the Greek letters Alpha through Omega to label the most prominent stars in the constellation, followed by the letter A, then lowercase b, c and d. Within the constellation's borders, there are 104 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5. The constellation Cancer as it can be seen by the naked eye. Also known as Altarf or Tarf, Beta Cancri is the brightest star in Cancer at apparent magnitude 3.5. Located 290 ¬± 30 light-years from Earth, it is a binary star system, its main component an orange giant of spectral type K4III that is varies slightly from a baseline magnitude of 3.53‚Äîdipping by 0.005 magnitude over a period of 6 days. An aging star, it has expanded to around 50 times the Sun's diameter and shines with 660 times its luminosity. It has a faint magnitude 14 red dwarf companion located 29 arcseconds away that takes 76,000 years to complete an orbit. Altarf represents a part of Cancer's body. At magnitude 3.9 is Delta Cancri, also known as Asellus Australis. Located 131¬±1 light-years from Earth, it is an orange-hued giant star that has swollen and cooled off the main sequence to become an orange giant with a radius 11 times and luminosity 53 times that of the Sun. Its common name means \\"southern donkey\\". The star also holds a record for the longest name, \\"Arkushanangarushashutu,\\" derived from ancient Babylonian language, which translates to \\"the southeast star in the Crab.\\" Delta Cancri also makes it easy to find X Cancri, the reddest star in the sky. Known as Asellus Borealis \\"northern donkey\\", Gamma Cancri is a white-hued A-type subgiant of spectral type A1IV and magnitude 4.67, that is 35 times as luminous as of the Sun. It is located 181 ¬± 2 light-years from Earth. Iota Cancri is a wide double star. The primary is a yellow-hued G-type bright giant star of magnitude 4.0, located 330 ¬± 20 light-years from Earth. It spent much of its stellar life as a B-type main sequence star before expanding and cooling to its current state as it spent its core hydrogen. The secondary is a white main sequence star of spectral type A3V and magnitude 6.57. Despite having different distances when measured by the HIPPARCOS satellite, the two stars share a common proper motion and appear to be a natural binary system. Located 181 ¬± 2 light-years from Earth, Alpha Cancri (Acubens) is a multiple star with a primary component an apparent white main sequence star of spectral type A5 and magnitude 4.26. The secondary is of magnitude 12.0 and is visible in small amateur telescopes. Its common name means \\"the claw\\". The primary is actually two very similar white main sequence stars that are 5.3 AU distant from each other and the secondary is two small main sequence stars, most likely red dwarfs, that are 600 AU from the main pair. Hence the system is a quadruple one. Zeta Cancri or Tegmine (\\"the shell\\") is a multiple star system that contains at least four stars located 82 light-years from Earth. The two brightest components are a binary star with an orbital period of 1100 years; the brighter component is a yellow-hued binary pair and the dimmer component is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 6.2. The brighter component is itself a binary star with a period of 59.6 years; its primary is of magnitude 5.6 and its secondary is of magnitude 6.0. This pair is at its greatest separation around 2019. Ten star systems have been found to have planets. Rho-1 Cancri or 55 Cancri (or Copernicus) is a binary star approximately 40.9 light-years distant from Earth. 55 Cancri consists of a yellow dwarf and a smaller red dwarf, with five planets orbiting the primary star; one low-mass planet that may be either a hot, water-rich world or a carbon planet and four gas giants. 55 Cancri A, classified as a rare \\"super metal-rich\\" star, is one of the top 100 target stars for NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder mission, ranked 63rd on the list. The red dwarf 55 Cancri B, a suspected binary, appears to be gravitationally bound to the primary star, as the two share common proper motion. YBP 1194 is a sunlike star in the open cluster M67 that has been found to have three planets. =Deep-sky objects= Cancer is best known among stargazers as the home of Praesepe (Messier 44), an open cluster also called the Beehive Cluster, located right in the centre of the constellation. Located about 590 light-years from Earth, it is one of the nearest open clusters to our Solar System. M 44 contains about 50 stars, the brightest of which are of the sixth magnitude. Epsilon Cancri is the brightest member at magnitude 6.3. Praesepe is also one of the larger open clusters visible; it has an area of 1.5 square degrees, or three times the size of the full Moon. It is most easily observed when Cancer is high in the sky. North of the Equator, this period stretches from February to May. Ptolemy described the Beehive Cluster as \\"the nebulous mass in the breast of Cancer.\\" It was one of the first objects Galileo observed with his telescope in 1609, spotting 40 stars in the cluster. Today, there are about 1010 high-probability members, most of them (68 percent) red dwarfs. The Greeks and Romans identified the nebulous object as a manger from which two donkeys, represented by the neighbouring stars [1213] Asellus Borealis and [1210] Asellus Australis, were eating. The stars represent the donkeys that the god Dionysus and his tutor Silenus rode in the war against the Titans. The ancient Chinese interpreted the object as a ghost or demon riding in a carriage, calling it a \\"cloud of pollen blown from under willow catkins.\\" The smaller, denser open cluster Messier 67 can also be found in Cancer, 2600 light-years from Earth. It has an area of approximately 0.5 square degrees, the size of the full Moon. It contains approximately 200 stars, the brightest of which are of the tenth magnitude. QSO J0842+1835 is a quasar used to measure the speed of gravity in VLBI experiment conducted by Edward Fomalont and Sergei Kopeikin in September 2002. OJ 287 is a BL Lacertae object located 3.5 billion light years away that has produced quasi-periodic optical outbursts going back approximately 120 years, as first apparent on photographic plates from 1891. It was first detected at radio wavelengths during the course of the Ohio Sky Survey. Its central supermassive black hole is among the largest known, with a mass of 18 billion solar masses, more than six times the value calculated for the previous largest object. History and Mythology Cancer was first recorded by Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD in Almagest, under the Greek name ŒöŒ±œÅŒ∫ŒØŒΩŒøœÇ (Karkinos). Richard Hinckley Allen asserted this paragraph in the late 1890s, without underlying evidence: > \\"Cancer is said to have been the place for the Akkadian Sun of the South, > perhaps from its position at the winter solstice in very remote antiquity; > but afterwards it was associated with the fourth month Duzu, our June‚ÄìJuly, > and was known as the Northern Gate of Sun[...]\\"Star Names: Their Lore and > Meaning (Diss., University of MN, 1898; reprinted NY: Dover, 1899 and > continually to the present), 108. William Tyler Olcott repeats it nearly- > verbatim in Star Lore of All Ages: A Collection of Myths, Legends, and Facts > Concerning the Constellations of the Northern Hemisphere (NY: G.P. Putnam, > 1911), 89 (with attribution to Allen). Others continue to reprint it all > over to the present. Showing but few stars, and its brightest stars being of only 4th magnitude, Cancer was often considered the \\"Dark Sign\\", quaintly described as black and without eyes. Dante, alluding to this faintness and position of heavens, wrote in Paradiso: Cancer was the location of the Sun's most northerly position in the sky (the summer solstice) in ancient times, though this position now occurs in Taurus due to the precession of the equinoxes, around June 21. This is also the time that the Sun is directly overhead at 23.5¬∞N, a parallel now known as the Tropic of Cancer. The close conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in 1563‚Äî which was observed by Tycho Brahe and led him to note the inaccuracy of existing ephemerides and to begin his own program of astronomical measurements‚Äîoccurred in Cancer not far from Praesepe. In Greek mythology, Cancer is identified with the crab that appeared while Heracles fought the many-headed Hydra. Hercules slew the crab after it bit him in the foot. Afterwards, the goddess Hera, an enemy of Heracles, placed the crab among the stars.Pseudo-Hyginus, De Astronomica 2.23. Illustrations Cancer as depicted in Urania's Mirror, a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. The modern symbol for Cancer represents the pincers of a crab, but Cancer has been represented as many types of creatures, usually those living in the water, and always those with an exoskeleton. In the Egyptian records of about 2000 BC it was described as Scarabaeus (Scarab), the sacred emblem of immortality. In Babylonia the constellation was known as MUL.AL.LUL, a name which can refer to both a crab and a snapping turtle. On boundary stones, the image of a turtle or tortoise appears quite regularly and it is believed that this represents Cancer since a conventional crab has not so far been discovered on any of these monuments. There also appears to be a strong connection between the Babylonian constellation and ideas of death and a passage to the underworld, which may be the origin of these ideas in later Greek myths associated with Hercules and the Hydra. In the 12th century, an illustrated astronomical manuscript shows it as a water beetle. Albumasar writes of this sign in Flowers of Abu Ma'shar. A 1488 Latin translation depicts cancer as a large crayfish, which also is the constellation's name in most Germanic languages. Jakob Bartsch and Stanislaus Lubienitzki, in the 17th century, described it as a lobster. Names Richard Allen, in Star-names and Their Meanings, lists names for the constellation as follows: In Ancient Greece, Aratus called the crab ŒöŒ±œÅŒ∫ŒπŒΩŒøœÇ (Karkinos), which was followed by Hipparchus and Ptolemy. The Alfonsine tables called it Carcinus, a Latinized form of the Greek word. Eratosthenes extended this as ŒöŒ±œÅŒ∫ŒπŒΩŒøœÇ, ŒüŒΩŒøŒπ, Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ¶Œ±œÑŒΩŒ∑ (Karkinos, Onoi, kai Fatne): the Crab, Asses, and Crib. In Ancient Rome, Manilius and Ovid called the constellation Litoreus (shore-inhabiting). Astacus and Cammarus appear in various classic writers, while it is called Nepa in Cicero's De Finibus and the works of Columella, Plautus, and Varro; all of these words signify crab, lobster, or scorpion. Athanasius Kircher said that in Coptic Egypt it was ŒöŒªŒ±œÅŒπŒ± (Klaria), the Bestia seu Statio Typhonis (the Power of Darkness). J√©r√¥me Lalande identified this with Anubis, one of the Egyptian divinities commonly associated with Sirius. The Indian language Sanskrit shares a common ancestor with Greek, and the Sanskrit name of Cancer is Karka and Karkata. In Telugu it is \\"Karkatakam\\", in Kannada \\"Karkataka\\" or \\"Kataka\\", in Tamil Karkatan, and in Sinhala . The later Hindus knew it as Kulira, from the Greek ŒöŒøŒªŒøœÖœÅŒøœÇ (Kolouros), the term originated by Proclus. Astrology , the Sun appears in the constellation Cancer from July 20 to August 9. In tropical astrology, the Sun is considered to be in the sign Cancer from June 22 to July 22, and in sidereal astrology, from July 16 to August 16.

The population was 1,027 at the 2010 census, up from 713 in 2000. Akutan Harbor is adjacent. Geography Akutan is located at . Akutan is located in the Aleutian Islands Recording District. Akutan is located on Akutan Island in the eastern Aleutians, one of the Krenitzin Islands in the Fox Islands group. It is east of Unalaska, and southwest of Anchorage. Akutan lies in the maritime climate zone, resulting in mild winters and cool summers. Mean temperatures range from , and precipitation averages per year. High winds and storms are frequent in the winter, and fog is common in the summer. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (25.69%) is water. History and culture Akutan began in 1878 as a fur storage and trading port for the Western Fur & Trading Company. The company's agent established a commercial cod fishing and processing business that quickly attracted nearby Unangan to the community. A Russian Orthodox church and a school were built in 1878, but was replaced by the St. Alexander Nevsky Chapel, built in 1918. The Pacific Whaling Company built a whale processing station across the bay from Akutan in 1912. It was the only whaling station in the Aleutians, and operated until 1939. St. Alexander Nevsky Chapel After the Japanese attacked Unalaska in June 1942, the U.S. government evacuated Akutan residents to the Ketchikan area. In June 1942, a Japanese A6M Zero fighter piloted by Tadayoshi Koga crashed on Akutan Island. It was recovered in July by the United States Army Air Force. This plane, dubbed the Akutan Zero, significantly aided American tacticians in devising dog fighting techniques to defeat the Zero, and helped change the course of the war. The village was re- established in 1944, although many villagers chose not to return. This exposure to the outside world brought many changes to the traditional lifestyle and attitudes of the community. The City was incorporated in 1979. A federally recognized tribe is located in the community‚Äîthe Native Village of Akutan. The population of the community consists of 16.4% Alaska Native or part Native. Akutan is a fishing community, and is the site of a traditional Unangan village. Approximately 75 persons are year-round residents; the majority of the population are transient fish processing workers that live in group quarters.

Economy King Cove, SW of Anchorage at the end of the Alaska Peninsula, is home to PeterPan Seafoods' largest processing facility. King Crab, bairdi and opilio tanner crab, pollock, cod, salmon, halibut and black cod harvested in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska are processed throughout the year. The plant, with origins back to the early 1900s, has the largest salmon canning capacity of any plant in Alaska. All five species of salmon are abundant in the waters near King Cove. Salmon remains a major part of the annual operation, but in recent years the plant has expanded and streamlined whitefish operations. The plant produces several product forms including pollock fillet block, shatterpack fillets, mince and surimi. Cod shatterpack fillets and salt cod are mainstays. At peak seasons, both winter and summer, nearly 500 employees staff the operation. King Cove's economy depends almost completely on the year-round commercial fishing and seafood processing industries. The PeterPan Seafoods' facility is one of the largest cannery operations under one roof in Alaska. 76 residents hold commercial fishing permits. Income is supplemented by subsistence activities. The community is served by King Cove Airport, a state-owned public use airport with a gravel runway. A locally based FAA certificated Part 135 company called Eider Air provides on demand air-taxi service and charter operations to villagers and visitors. Grant Aviation also flys to King Cove, and has the contract for mail services. It is also served by the Alaska Marine Highway, the state-run ferry service which connects it with Cold Bay in the west and Sand Point in the east. A partially completed road between King Cove and Cold Bay is awaiting approval through the USDOI. This road would pass through the Izembek Wilderness, causing irreparable damage to the preserve per governmental assessments according to a report generated by The Wilderness Society . The previous negative decision by former USDOI director Sally Jewell is being reconsidered to include a land swap. Proponents of the road state it would help local citizens in need of medical evacuation when airplanes can not land or take off from the local airport due to darkness or weather conditions. Opponents contend the road's main purpose is, as it always has been, to provide a link between King Cove and a nearby airport for commercial reasons. No evidence has been put forward to support a road would be safer in difficult weather condition than air transport. On 22 January 2018, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke signed a land swap agreement to allow construction of the road. Healthcare The King Cove Community Health Clinic is run by the Eastern Aleutian Tribes and provides routine medical care, behavioral health, and emergency care services. The clinic is open Monday through Friday during normal business hours, closed for all Alaskan and Federal holidays. After hours emergencies are handled by on-call practitioners. There is an active local emergency medical services group who provide ambulance service. Care is also provided through Community Health Aide Practitioners, which are unique to Alaska.

At the 2010 census the population was 52, down from 83 in 2000. Nelson Lagoon was established around 1960 and is the youngest of the Borough communities. It is the only Aleut settlement on the Bering Sea shore. The community is on the northern coast of the Alaska Peninsula and sits on a narrow sand spit that separates the lagoon from the Bering Sea. Nelson Lagoon is in the middle of a rich and productive salmon fisheries area. The community's dock, boat ramp, harbormaster's office and warehouse were completed in the late 1990s. Nelson Lagoon has excellent docking facilities as well as boat and gear storage. A state-owned 4,000-foot- long lighted gravel runway allows regularly scheduled flights. In March, 2016, Nelson Lagoon was coated with tephra, during a strong eruption of nearby Mount Pavlof.  History  The location where Nelson Lagoon sits was used as an Aleut summer campsite during the fishing season. In 1882, the lagoon was named for Edward William Nelson, a naturalist and explorer who travelled the region between 1877 and 1920. From 1906 until 1917, a salmon salting facility operated at the location, which was staffed mainly by Scandinavian fishermen. These men married local women, and today most native people in Nelson Bay have partial Scandinavian ancestry. A permanent settlement was established in 1960. A school was built five years later, and the settlement grew into a larger permanent community.Edward William Nelson in Alaska In 1985, an environmental impact statement by the Minerals Management Service of the United States Department of the Interior was released, producing an in-depth analysis of the Nelson Bay community and its cultural, demographic, religious, political and educational atmosphere as well as predictions. The statement wrote about a well-organized, tight-knit community. The study reported the five-member Nelson Bay village council was formed in 1971, still consisted of all its original members, met often, and was competent and unified in its representation of the community. Unlike other villages, in Nelson Bay, politics were a familial affair; village councils represented the three main families in the village. The environmental impact statement wrote that culturally and economically, the village was much as it was at the time of its founding: small, relatively undeveloped and very isolated. The village's younger generations were reported to have developed the unique tendency of brothers of one family marrying sisters of another family, thus requiring future generations to find spouses in other communities. The Russian Orthodox Church was the village's dominant religion at the time, but secularization was taking place. Education was highly valued in the Nelson Bay, and the 1985 environmental impact statement wrote this could have been a legacy of the village's Scandinavian ancestors.

At the 2010 census the population was 976, up from 952 in 2000. It is on northwestern Popof Island, one of the Shumagin Islands, off the Alaska Peninsula. It is the borough seat of Aleutians East Borough, and is near the entrance to the Bering Sea. The Aleutians East Borough School District is in Southwestern Alaska along the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Chain The District was formed in 1988 from smaller districts that consolidated and formed a Borough with taxing authority. The Borough and District boundaries are the same, and stretch over approximately of roadless, mostly treeless tundra, from the middle of the Alaska Peninsula to the north and east, going southwest out to Akutan just east of Dutch Harbor. History Undated photograph of Sand Point by John Nathan Cobb (died 1930) Sand Point was founded by a San Francisco fishing company in 1898 as a cod fishing station and trading post. Aleuts and Scandinavians were among the early residents. Gold mining was briefly a part of the economy during the early 1900s. Fishing remains an important industry, as Sand Point is home to one of the largest fishing fleets in the Aleutian Chain. Description Almost half the inhabitants are of Aleut descent - mainly from the Qagan Tayagungin tribe, and support themselves by fishing and fish processing. There is a cold storage and fish-processing plant owned and operated by Trident Seafoods and Peter Pan has a support facility. There is an airport with a paved runway and daily flights (weather permitting) to Anchorage, to the northeast. The town is above the treeline, and there is a small herd of 120 bison (first introduced in the 1930s) which provides some meat for the island's inhabitants. It is notorious for the high winds caused by the meeting of cold air flows from the Bering Sea with the warm air over the Japan Current. It has a maritime climate, with temperature averages ranging from , an average snowfall of and an average rainfall of .

Often it is difficult to obtain a plane ticket off of the island with costs occasionally reaching $1200 for a round-trip ticket. Cargo service to Sand Point is available on PenAir and Alaska Central Express (ACE) Air Cargo. PenAir has cargo flights to Sand Point six mornings a week. ACE Air Cargo flies to Sand Point several days a week. Coastal Transportation is a Seattle-based marine carrier that provides weekly year-around service to communities throughout the Aleutians, including Sand Point. During the summer and into the fall, the Alaska Marine Highway operates the Tustumena. The Tustumena stops in Sand Point four times per month. From Sand Point the ferry goes to King Cove, Cold Bay, False Pass and Dutch Harbor. The ship has staterooms and dining room service. The ferry takes cars and trucks. As of 2017 ferry delays have been common. In Sand Point, rental cars are available from the Harbor Cafe and the Marine View Bed & Breakfast. Wind Power In 2012, two .5MW wind turbines were installed with blade diameters of 19.5 meters and a height of 59.5 meters. Activities Many people enjoy hunting for ptarmigan and buffalo. Commercial and pole fishing are enjoyable pastimes for the residents of Sand Point. Boating and riding all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) are popular pastimes as well. There is an annual Silver Salmon Derby in which contestants try to catch the largest fish to earn a cash prize. Adults can play Bingo and pull tabs on Sunday. The Boys and Girls Club offers after- school activities. Many adults spend their time at the local tavern and lounge both owned and operated by the Shumagin Corporation. Due to the small community and the lack of entertainment, many newcomers find themselves leaving. This includes many of the teachers. Fishing industry Like most Aleutian communities, commercial fishing drives the local economy. The Aleutians' largest fishing fleet is based in Sand Point. Trident Seafoods has a major Pacific cod, pollock, salmon and halibut processing plant, and provides fuel and other services. Peter Pan Seafoods owns a storage and transfer facility. In 1991, New West Fisheries had a floating processor near the city dock for Pacific cod processing. Residents in Sand Point have to acquire commercial fishing permits to participate in the fisheries. The city completed a major rehabilitation of the Robert E. Galovin Small Boat Harbor in the summer of 2014. The harbor can hold more than 150 boats in permanent slips, as well as transient vessels. There is also a new boat harbor on the waterfront next to the small boat harbor and City dock. This harbor was built by the Borough and Army Corps of Engineers, but does not have any floats. Business and shopping The AC Store (Alaska Commercial Company) provides groceries, apparel, motorized vehicles such as ATVs, and toiletries. Small local stores provide goods like hardware, toys, groceries, and electronics. There is a small selection of restaurants in the town. Alcohol can be purchased at two locations. A bed and breakfast is near the Trident bunkhouses. Cut R' Loose Coffee provides espresso and other specialty drinks to the local community.

At the 2010 census the population was 326, up from 316 in 2000. It is the westernmost municipality in the United States and the southernmost city in Alaska.Attu Station, Alaska, is technically east and is not incorporated (See Extreme points of the United States). The city is the former location of the Adak Army Base and Adak Naval Operating Base, NAVFAC Adak. Geography Adak is located on Kuluk Bay, on Adak Island, in the Andreanof Islands group of the Aleutian Islands Recording District, and in the 3rd Judicial District. It lies southwest of Anchorage and west of Dutch Harbor at 51.872¬∞ North, 176.636¬∞ West (Sec. 10, T096S, R195W, Seward Meridian), near the Russian end of the arc that makes up this volcanic island chain. Flight time to Anchorage is 3 hours or longer, depending on weather. Adak is the southernmost community in Alaska and on the same latitude as Haida Gwaii in Canada, and Brussels, Belgium. It is less than three degrees of latitude north of the 49th parallel, which forms the western part of the land border between the Contiguous United States and Canada. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (3.87%) is water. Climate Adak lies in the subpolar oceanic climate zone (Cfc), characterized by persistently overcast skies, moderated temperatures, high winds, significant precipitation and frequent cyclonic storms. Winter squalls produce wind gusts in excess of . During the summer, extensive fog forms over the Bering Sea and North Pacific. Average temperatures range from , but wind chill factors can be severe. Average annual precipitation is annually, concentrated markedly in fall and winter. December is the wettest single month on average, while June and July are markedly the driest months, with thunderstorms virtually unknown here. Snowfall averages nearly per winter season, which however tends to melt soon after falling. With 263 rainy days per year, Adak has the second highest number of any inhabited locality in the United States after Hilo, Hawaii. History and culture Kanaga Island view with Telephoto from Adak, AK 19th century The Aleutian Islands were historically occupied by the Unanga, more commonly known now as the Aleuts. The once heavily populated island was eventually abandoned in the early 19th century as the Aleutian Island hunters followed the Russian fur trade eastward, and famine set in on the Andreanof Island group. However, they continued to hunt and fish actively around the island over the years, until World War II broke out. Military involvement and the naval station Adak Army installations allowed U.S. forces to mount a successful offensive against the Japanese-held islands of Kiska and Attu. After the war, Adak was developed as a naval air station, playing an important role during the Cold War as a submarine surveillance center. Large earthquakes rocked the island in 1957, 1964 and 1977. Abandoned military buildings on Adak Island. These buildings house a basketball court, squash court, saunas, bowling alley, and more, all in an unusable state of disrepair.At its peak, the station housed over 6,000 naval and Coast Guard personnel and their families. In 1994, the base was downsized, and both family housing and schools were closed. The station officially closed on March 31, 1997, as a result of 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC). The Aleut Corporation purchased Adak's facilities under a land transfer agreement with the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Navy/Department of Defense. This agreement was finalized in March, 2004. About 30 families with children relocated to Adak in September 1998, most of them Aleut Corp. shareholders, and the former high school was reopened at that time as a K‚Äì12 institution. The community incorporated as a second-class city in April, 2001. Substantially all of the infrastructure and facilities on Adak are owned by Aleut Corporation, which is currently developing Adak as a commercial center via their subsidiary companies. For example, properties in active use are leased by Adak Commercial Properties, LLC. Since World War II, the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard developed facilities and recreation opportunities at Adak. At its peak, Adak had a college, a McDonald's restaurant, a Baskin-Robbins ice cream stand, movie theater, roller skating rink, swimming pool, ski lodge, bowling alleys, skeet range, auto hobby shop, photo lab, and racquetball & tennis courts. A new $18-million hospital was built in 1990, just seven years prior to the closure of the station. By March 2003, six years after the closure of the station, most of these facilities had closed. Demographics Adak first appeared on the 2000 U.S. Census as a census-designated place (CDP),https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/phc-1-3.pdf although it previously was the Adak Naval Station from 1970https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1970a_ak-01.pdfhttps://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1980a_akABCD-01.pdf to 1990.https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph5/cph-5-3.pdf In 2001, it formally incorporated as a city.

The wastewater treatment system discharges through a marine outfall line to Kuluk Bay. Adak's water system is reported to have lead in it. ; Waste Waste was previously removed of by a permitted landfill site; This site was operated on Adak Island under Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (Alaska DEC) solid waste regulations. The landfill operated from the early 1950s until 1972 and from 1975 until 2002. The site was used to dispose of sanitary trash, metal debris, batteries, solvents, waste paints, and construction rubble. From 1975 on, the landfill only accepted sanitary trash. The landfill was closed in 1997 by placing a low permeability soil cover over the landfill, implementing access restrictions, installing surface erosion controls, and placing a vegetative cover. In March 2002, the State of Alaska approved resumption of operations at Roberts Landfill through 2002 to dispose of inert demolition waste monofill and one cell for disposal of approximately 10 cubic yards of asbestos-containing material. Alaska DEC approved closure of the landfill in 2002. ; Identified contaminants Metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater and surface water. ; Current actions The Navy inspects institutional controls (ICs) annually.

Overage use is extremely expensive, and a monopoly exists because personal satellite internet is not available due to the satellite locations. Solar activity blocks communications during equinox seasons for several days of both spring and fall seasons. Due to its remoteness the internet connection is very poor, applications that require high bandwidth will not work as intended, and can only be picked up in various \\"hot spots\\" within the town. There are no radio stations within 200 miles (320 km) of Adak; radio can be received in Adak only through satellite or shortwave receivers. ; Health care There is no hospital; however there is Adak Community Health Center, managed by Eastern Aleutian Tribes, Inc. (EAT). The health center provides Family Medicine, Chronic Care and urgent care services, and is staffed by a physician-assistant or, at times, by a community health practitioner. There is no doctor, no blood supply, and limited medications to stabilize a patient awaiting a medical evacuation, weather permitting. Behavioral Health is also provided via tele-video and quarterly site visits. EAT sends a dentist to Adak one week per year to provide limited dental services; otherwise, dental services must be referred outside of Adak. Tele-Radiology (X-ray) and Tele-Medicine are also present. Limited lab, pharmacy, and public health services are also available. The pharmacy medications are limited to acute medications. Filling of prescriptions from outside facilities usually cannot be accommodated. All visitors should bring plenty of their own medications as the health center stocks a very limited supply of chronic medications. Auxiliary emergency health care is provided by Adak Volunteer Fire Department. Economy Logo on side of vehicle owned by Eastern Aleutian Tribes Inc. A land exchange between Aleut Corp., the U.S. Navy, and the Department of the Interior transferred most of the former naval facilities to the Aleut Corp. in March 2004. A portion of the island remains within the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The U.S. Navy retains part of the north end of Adak Island (Parcel 4) and does annual sweeps of the Andrew Lake Seawall for unexploded ordnance. Their website lists the Institutional Controls in place for all of Adak as part of the land exchange or Interim Conveyance. The Navy provides the trail maps as part of the ordnance awareness information required to be shown to all Adak residents and visitors. Adak currently provides a fueling port and crew transfer facility for a combination of Seattle and Alaskan based fishing fleet -- an airport, docks, housing facilities, restaurant, grocery, and ship supply store are available. Golden Harvest Alaska Seafood processes Pacific cod, pollock, mackerel, halibut, snow and king crabs at a 144,000-square-foot seafood processing facility on the island. Four local residents hold commercial fishing permits, primarily for groundfish; however, commercial fishing vessels based out of Seattle and other parts of Alaska provide most of the work for the seafood plant by regularly offloading their catch at the facility's large dock. The local airport allows the company to send orders via air cargo from Adak to markets around the world, including entire planes full of live king crab to China. Facilities Other facilities in Adak include three deep water docks and fueling facilities. The city has requested funds to greatly expand the Sweeper Cove small boat harbor, including new breakwaters, a dock and new moorage floats . There are approximately of paved and primitive roads on Adak, all privately owned by the Aleut Corporation. The Aleut are also seeking to develop their water system, which has been well-maintained and -designed for a larger Naval population, as an export industry. Airport Alaska Airlines at Adak Airport Because of its naval aviation past, Adak has an unusually large and sophisticated airport for the Aleutian Islands. The airport is currently operated by the State of Alaska Department of Transportation. Complete with an Instrument Landing System, Adak Airport has no control tower and two 200' wide asphalt paved runways at 19' elevation. One runway measures 7,790' long while the other runway measures 7,605'. Alaska Airlines operates twice-weekly Boeing 737 passenger jet service from Anchorage via Cold Bay. At present, flights operate each Wednesday and Saturday, weather permitting. Occasionally, extra seasonal flights are operated to meet the demand of the fishing season. Tourism Land use permits are required for all non-residents visiting Aleut Corporation land. There are multiple different locations to stay in the city; the former naval base housing can be rented by various companies for long and short stays. Unfortunately cabins that were once maintained by Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge have fallen into disrepair and are unsafe to occupy. Camping is legal without a permit on the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge land but due to the harsh climate it is not recommended to do so. The wind on Adak is highly variable and often unpredictable (the record speed is unknown because the wind ripped the anemometer off of the tower). Birdwatchers often travel to Adak and nearby Attu Island, as many vagrant birds from Asia and elsewhere can be spotted there. Bald Eagles exist there in high numbers. Developed trails are limited and most are not maintained. It is possible to hike on the tundra, but visitors are advised both to prepare for frequent weather changes and to never hike alone. Nightlife and dining opportunities are few on Adak. The Adak General Store is open sporadically during the week. Two restaurants operate in Adak: the Bay 5 (which is housed in the same annex building with the liquor store) and Blue Bird Cafe. Hunting and fishing continue in Adak, especially caribou. There is no bag limit for cows, but in 2007, the Board of Game passed new regulations for bulls. Hunting access to the south end of the island involves two licensed local boat charter services: either Aleutian Adventure Tours or Homeward Bound Charters. Anglers can access halibut in the Kagalaska Straits. Hunters must possess an Alaska state hunting license and a harvest ticket for each animal taken; non-residents of Alaska must also possess the appropriate big game tag. Anglers require a sport fishing license. All areas of the island with roads are owned by the Aleut Corporation, and a special permit is required for all non-residents accessing this private property. No ATVs are permitted within the wildlife refuge and the Aleut Corporation only allows ATVs on the roads and trails, not on the tundra. Under Alaska state law, wastage is illegal.

LORAN Station Attu had provided a navigational signal for mariners of the North Pacific since the 1970s.Home page for USCG Loran Station Attu (modified 7/23/2007) Although often considered the westernmost place in the United States, due to its location relative to the rest of the country, Attu Station is actually one of the easternmost points in the United States, located at , on the opposite side of the 180th meridian from the rest of the United States (See Extreme Points of the United States, even though Attu is not listed there). History After the Japanese invasion of Attu Island and the battle to retake it, the United States government constructed a LORAN station on the southern tip of the island, at Theodore Point. The equipment to build the station came from Holtz Bay and was ferried on barges and landing craft to Baxter Cove, about east of the station. Bulldozers were used to cut a road from Baxter Cove to Theodore Point. In 1960, the station was moved to Casco Cove, near the former United States Navy base at Massacre Bay. Later, it was moved to Massacre Bay. LORAN Station Attu ceased transmission of the LORAN signal on February 8, 2010 and the Russian-American signal ceased on August 1, 2010.

History and culture The Pribilofs, named after the Russian navigator, Gavriil Pribylov, were discovered in 1786 by Russian fur traders; no Alaska Natives are known to have lived on the island prior to this point. They landed first on St. George and named the larger island to the north St. Peter and St. Paul Island. In 1788, the Russian-American Company enslaved and relocated Aleuts from Atka and Unalaska to the Pribilofs, Retrieved 2013-5-31. to hunt fur seals; their descendants live on the two islands today. In 1870, the now-American owned Alaska Commercial Company (formerly the Russian-American Company) was awarded a 20-year sealing lease by the U.S. Government, and provided housing, food and medical care to the Aleuts in exchange for seal harvesting. In 1890, a second 20-year lease was awarded to the North American Commercial Company, however, the fur seals had been severely over-harvested and only an estimated 200,000 fur seals remained. The 1910 Fur Seal Treaty ended private sealing on the islands and placed the community and fur seals under the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. Food and clothing were scarce, social and racial segregation were practiced, and working conditions were poor. During World War II, as the Imperial Japanese Army threatened the Aleutians; the 881 Aleuts on the Pribilof islands were forcibly removed, with no more than several hours' notice, to internment in abandoned salmon canneries and mines in Southeast Alaska until May 1944. The Aleut men were brought back to the islands temporarily in the summer of 1943 to conduct the fur seal harvest for the federal government, seal oil being used in the war effort. Most Aleuts from the Pribilofs were imprisoned at Funter Bay on Admiralty Island in Southeast Alaska. In 1979, the Aleut people from the Pribilof islands received $8.5 million in partial compensation for the unfair and unjust treatment they were subject to under federal administration between 1870 and 1946. In 1983, Congress passed the Fur Seal Act Amendments, which ended government control of the commercial seal harvest and most of the federal presence on the island. Responsibility for providing community services and management of the fur seals was left to local entities. USD$20 million was provided to help develop and diversify the Island economy--USD$12 million to St. Paul and USD$8 million to St. George. Commercial harvesting on St. Paul ceased in 1985. Ownership of fur seal pelts is now prohibited except for subsistence purposes. Nature and wildlife =Birds= No fewer than 287 species of birds have been recorded on the island. In spring (May through mid-June) and fall (August through October), many rare birds, including Siberian vagrants, may be spotted on the island. The cliffs of Saint Paul, Saint George and Otter Island support large numbers of breeding seabirds, including critical nesting habitat for the very range-restricted red-legged kittiwake. The auk family is well represented here, with horned and tufted puffin, thick-billed and common murre, parakeet, crested and least auklets and ancient murrelet occurring as breeders, and several other species occurring as vagrants or seasonal visitors. Breeding ducks include long-tailed duck, northern pintail, and green-winged teal. Breeding shorebirds include semipalmated plover, the Pribilof subspecies of rock sandpiper, least sandpiper and red-necked phalarope. Breeding landbirds are few, but include insular subspecies of gray-crowned rosy finch and Pacific wren, snow bunting, Lapland longspur, and the occasional hoary or common redpoll, or common raven. Saint Paul Island Tours (part of the TDX Corp.) runs a natural history tourist program to the island of Saint Paul from May through early October, offering interested visitors the chance to explore the avifauna of the island. =Northern fur seals= One of the most notable sights on the island are the northern fur seal rookeries. The Pribilof Islands support about half of the global population, with some of the individual rookeries on Saint Paul Island containing over 100,000 seals. In late May, the male seals begin to arrive and stake out their territories in preparation for the arrival of the females, who typically arrive during the third week of June. The females give birth soon after making landfall, and by mid-July there will be hundreds of young pups around the island. On June 1, the rookeries are closed and remain off limits until mid-October. During the summer these marine mammals may be viewed, by permit, from blinds at two rookeries. =Harbor seals, sea lions, walrus, whales= Harbor seals breed on Otter Island, several miles southwest of St. Paul Island, but nonetheless are often seen off St. Paul shores. Occasionally, Steller sea lions haul out on St. Paul, but usually take refuge in the rookery at Walrus Island, some 10 miles northeast of St. Paul. On extremely rare occasions, grey whales, orcas, and walrus are observed offshore. =Blue fox= The Blue fox is a subspecies of the Arctic fox. Endemic to the island, the fox can be found roaming the hills and climbing the cliffs as it scavenges for food. Though clearly able to capture the occasional gull, foxes near the town prefer to scavenge garbage and explore the fishing docks and Processing Plant. Kits hide under storage containers and gobble a fisherman's offered scraps. Some kits shed their dark color much faster than their siblings and adopt a fluffy white/grey coat by mid-September. Foxes inhabiting areas farther from the human dwellings boast a more aggressive and territorial manner. Edging the fur seal rookeries, the two species cohabit easily. =Reindeer= A large herd of reindeer roam the island. Of domesticated Russian stock, 25 reindeer were introduced to the island in the fall of 1911, but, after a peak of 2,046 organisms in 1938, the number decreased to 8. =Wildflowers= In spring, with the greening of the island, wildflowers begin to decorate the maritime tundra landscape. There are more than 100 species of wildflowers, from the Arctic lupine, with its bluish- purple blossoms, to the glowing yellow Alaska poppy, that can be viewed. Climate The climate of St. Paul is Arctic maritime. The Bering Sea location results in cool weather year-round and a narrow range of mean temperatures varying from 19 to 51 degrees Fahrenheit. Average precipitation is 25 inches, with snowfall of 56 inches. Heavy fog is common during summer months. Lightning and thunder are virtually unheard of.

History  Shoreline of the Kuskokwim River at Aniak Aniak is the Central Alaskan Yup'ik name for the area around present-day Aniak. The word means \\"the place where it comes out\\"; that is, where the Aniak River flows into the Kuskokwim. The local Yup'ik people had deserted the original village at Aniak by the early 19th century, when Russian explorers first arrived in the area. 20th-century prospectors believed that the early Russian traders discovered gold in a tributary to the Kuskokwim called \\"Yellow River\\" in 1832. Many think that the Yellow River these traders referred to is the Aniak River.Brown, Charles M. Alaska's Kuskokwim River Region. Bureau of Land Management. Anchorage, Alaska: Bureau of Land Management, State Office, 1983. 101. A mercury deposit was discovered by Russian traders near the trading post called Kolmakov Redoubt east of Aniak in 1838.Spurr, J.E., 1900, A reconnaissance in southwestern Alaska in 1898: U.S. Geological Survey 20th Annual Report, Part 7, p. 31-264. Placer gold was found by Russian traders in New York Creek east of Aniak in 1844.Berry, M.J., 1973, A history of mining on the Kenai Peninsula: Seattle, Washington, Alaska Northwest Publishing Company, 214 p. The Russians, however, did not engage in any significant mining activities, and it wasn't until after the purchase of Alaska in 1867 that the American prospectors began seriously investigating the potential for prospecting along the Kuskokwim river. A handful of prospecting parties began venturing into the area, however they had to travel great distances to an area where trading posts were few and far between, so the activity was limited especially given the exposure of other late 19th century strikes in Alaska which were better served by existing infrastructure. The euphoria caused by the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897-98 would set the stage for a change however with thousands of prospectors across the territory poised to make a rush upon rumor of each potential new strike. One such rush was the Yellow River Stampede of 1900 in which many prospectors left Nome to venture into the Kuskokwim basin upon rumors that someone had found the Yellow River strike despite the fact that the location of that strike was unknown. Finding precious little gold and experiencing substantial hardship, many of these folks would return to Nome following the difficult winter of 1901, but some stayed behind to continue their search. A 1906 gold discovery at the head of the Innoko River, a tributary of the Yukon River, caused another gold rush in 1907 with many of the prospectors choosing to access the site via the Kuskokwim River instead and trading posts were established at the Takotna River which required riverboat service to travel the Kuskokwim river. With riverboat service now available on the Kuskokwim River, prospecting activity picked up and some strikes were starting to occur in the Kuskokwim basin. Strikes were made at Crooked Creek, George River, New York Creek, and Aniak River among others. Most strikes were short lived. However, the Kuskokwim River was now seeing an increase in river traffic that needed servicing. In 1910, a lone prospector named \\"Old Man\\" Keeler reportedly found placer gold in the Aniak River basin. In 1911, three prospectors, Harry Buhro, E. W. \\"Kid\\" Fisher, and Fred Labelle, who had been working the George River area decided to give the Aniak River basin area a try and discovered gold at Marvel, Fisher, and Dome creeks.Maddren, A.G., Iditarod Pioneer. US Geological Survey Bulletin 622. 1911. p. 301. These creeks feed into the Aniak River about south of Aniak. Initially prospectors would reach this site by poling up the river in boats, however that was a difficult journey due to the nature of the river. The trip would take 15 to 20 days from the Kuskokwim river. By 1913, a hydraulic plant had been installed at Marvel Creek and in 1914 construction of a cat trail began starting south of Aniak on the mouth of the Aniak Slough and proceeding to the diggings at Marvel Creek. The cat trail was last used in the spring of 2006 by miners still working claims. This same year, Tom L. Johnson homesteaded the site of the long-abandoned Yup'ik village in the Aniak area and opened a store and post office there to service prospectors and miners in the vicinity. Willie Pete and Sam Simeon brought their Yup'ik families from Ohagamiut to Aniak. In 1936 a territorial school was opened. In anticipation of the Lend-Lease program to help supply Russia with war materials, construction of an airfield began in 1939. With the airfield in place, Aniak became the transportation hub for villages in the area including Chuathbaluk, Anvik, Kalskag, Crooked Creek, Holy Cross and others. In 1956 during the Cold War, construction of a White Alice Relay Station began bringing money, jobs, and communication capability to the area. The impact to the community from the relay station was immediate as the first telephone capable of long distance phone calls was installed at the Aniak Lodge in 1957 and Aniak's population more than doubled from 142 in 1950 to 308 in 1960. The 2000 census places Aniak's population at 572.

The missionaries moved Bethel from Mamterillermiut to its present location on the west side of the Kuskokwim River. A United States post office was opened in 1905. Alaska Natives in this area have had a long Christian history, in part from Russian Orthodox, Catholic and Moravian influence. As in many Alaska Native villages, Christian tradition has become interwoven with the people's original culture. Development came to the area during and after World War II, causing a great social disruption among the Alaska Natives. In 1971, Bethel established a community radio station KYUK, which has been a strong influence in the redevelopment and revival of Yup'ik culture and self-definition. It was the first Native-owned and operated radio station in the US. Similar stations were soon started in Kotzebue, and by 1990, there were 10 stations in communities of fewer than 3,500 people. On February 19, 1997, a school shooting attracted widespread media attention to Bethel when 16-year-old Evan Ramsey, a student at Bethel Regional High School, shot and killed his principal and one student and wounded two others, for which he later received a 210-year prison sentence.Avila, Jim; Holding, Reynolds; Whitcraft, Teri; Tribolet, Beth. \\"School Shooter: 'I Didn't Realize' They Would Die\\".

Once established, village has been called Chukbak, St. Sergius Mission, Kuskokwim Russian Mission, and Little Russian Mission. The village was often confused with Russian Mission on the Yukon, so in the 1960s the name was changed to Chuathbaluk, which is derived from the Yup'ik word Curapalek, meaning \\"the hills where the big blueberries grow.\\" Much of the village was lost in an influenza epidemic in 1900. By 1929, the site was deserted, although Russian Orthodox members continued to hold services at the mission. In 1954, the Crow Village Sam Phillips family from Crow Village resettled the mission, and later residents of Aniak and Crooked Creek joined their settlement. The church was rebuilt in the late 1950s, and a state school opened in the 1960s. The city was incorporated in 1975.
