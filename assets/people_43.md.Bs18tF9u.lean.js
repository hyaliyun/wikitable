After fighting as an ordinary soldier in the Russian Civil War, Sakhnov graduated from an officer training school and served there during the 1920s before rising to division command in the late 1930s. He was commanding the 56th Rifle Division in Belarus when Operation Barbarossa was launched. Stationed close to the border, his unit was destroyed in the first days of the war. After more than two months behind German lines, Sakhnov reached the Soviet lines with a small group of other officers, but was expelled from the Communist Party for burying his documents when he was encircled by German units. As a result of this censure, he never held a combat command again and spent the rest of the war in command of a training unit.  Early life and Russian Civil War  The son of Ukrainian peasants, Semyon Pavlovich Sakhnov was born on 15 February 1900 in Samoylovka in the Saratov Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Saratov Oblast, Russia). He graduated from the village primary school. Drafted into the Red Army on 20 July 1919 during the Russian Civil War, he was sent to serve with a cavalry battalion of the 23rd Rifle Division on the Southern Front. With the latter, Sakhnov fought as a Red Army man in the suppression of revolts in the rear of the 9th Army, and in battles against the Armed Forces of South Russia in the advance on Novocherkassk, on the Manych River, and at Yekaterinodar. He was transferred to the 99th Railroad Detachment at Balashov in February 1920 and later that year became a cadet of the 34th Machine Gun Commanders' Courses at Saratov, which became the Saratov Infantry School in May 1921. With a cadet detachment from the school, Sakhnov fought in the suppression of peasant revolts in Saratov Governorate.  Interwar period  After graduating from the school in September 1922, Sakhnov remained there as a platoon commander. From October 1927 he was a class commander, and later became an assistant company commander at the school. After completing the Leningrad Armored Courses for the Improvement of Command Cadre in 1931, Sakhnov became a company commander at the tank school reorganized from the Saratov Infantry School, in April 1931. He transferred to the 245th Rifle Regiment of the 82nd Rifle Division at Sverdlovsk, east of the Ural Mountains, in February 1932, serving with it as a battalion commander and assistant regimental commander. He became commander of the 245th before being sent to the Vystrel course for advanced training in November 1937. After completing the course in August 1938, Sakhnov, by then a colonel, was appointed commander of the 71st Rifle Division at Kemerovo in October of that year. The division was disbanded to form an officer cadet school and training courses for commanders within a few months, and in January 1940 Sakhnov became commander of the 23rd Reserve Rifle Brigade, a training unit in the district. He became a major general on 4 June of that year when the Red Army introduced general officer ranks. Appointed commander of the 201st Rifle Division at Tyumen in March 1941, Sakhnov was quickly sent to the Western Special Military District in Belarus, where he took command of the 56th Rifle Division, part of the 4th Rifle Corps of the 3rd Army, on 12 June.  World War II  The Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk, 22‚Äì25 June 1941 When Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June, the 56th came under attack from three divisions of the German VIII Army Corps in what became known as the Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk. Spread out over an area of in camps near Grodno in Polish territory annexed by the Soviet Union, close to the border of German-occupied Poland, the division suffered heavy losses and by 10:00 its remnants began retreating to the east and southeast, although one regiment was surrounded defending the August√≥w Canal. Sakhnov's communications with his units relied on telephone lines, which were soon cut, preventing him from controlling his forces. German tanks broke through to his command post by 09:00 and he began evacuating to the rear. In the chaos, the headquarters was scattered, and by 14:00 Sakhnov, with the guard platoon, the division's political commissar and chief of artillery, and other headquarters officers, made his way eastward, deep in the German rear. To cross the Neman, the group split up and Sakhnov, with five other officers and six enlisted men, crossed at Grandichi, north of Grodno on the night of 22‚Äì23 June. He proceeded to the Ozyory area on the next day, bringing his group to 25 people by collecting retreating troops. The fighting around Grodno, 24‚Äì25 June 1941 Sakhnov led his group to the Ozyory area on 24 June, having heard from another officer that Soviet troops were attempting to make a stand at Skidel. They arrived there in the afternoon, finding that the head of the operational department of the neighbouring 85th Rifle Division's staff had organized a defense from remnants of two regiments of the 56th and 85th with roughly 350 personnel. Skidel was surrounded by German tanks and infantry by the end of the day and Sakhnov, who had taken command, withdrew the troops across the Neman to the area of Most under the cover of darkness. On 25 June he and the staff officers went to Shchuchyn by staff car to retrieve rear units of the division there and shifted them and the remnants that could be collected to the area of Lida that night. Seeking the 3rd Army headquarters, supposedly at Lunno, Sakhnov and the division rear units met the commander of the 56th's 184th Rifle Regiment with 700 of his men while en route to Most and headed for Lunno on the morning of 27 June. German defenses in the area of Most on 27 June were porous and the 184th managed to overwhelm them at Rozhanka, capturing several prisoners who were shot, according to Sakhnov's postwar recollections. Later that day they slipped through the German lines to reach the south bank of the Neman at Most, but in the fighting Sakhnov and a group of around 50 people were separated from the regiment. After this engagement, Sakhnov's group gradually split into ever smaller groups that continued to move east over the next few days. Having to detour around German-occupied locations, Sakhnov and four other officers from his unit and the 3rd Army staff slowly made their way northeast on foot. He and the other officers reached Soviet lines on 6 September north of Andreapol in the sector of the 133rd Rifle Division of the 22nd Army, unarmed and dressed in civilian clothes, without his identity papers. For burying his party card with his papers while behind German lines, he was expelled from the Communist Party ten days later, a disgrace that ensured that he could not return to the front. After spending three months under NKVD investigation, Sakhnov was briefly assigned to the Vystrel course in October before being sent to the Siberian Military District under the direction of Lieutenant General Stepan Kalinin to work on raising new units in the district. In December he was appointed commander of the 23rd Reserve Rifle Brigade, a training unit, which was reorganized as a division with the same number in July 1944. Sakhnov spent the rest of the war in Siberia. In this capacity, he was responsible for the formation of new units and the dispatch of march battalions to provide replacements for the army.  Postwar  After the end of the war, Sakhnov continued to command the division. In October 1945 he became chief of the department of combat and physical training of the staff of the Western Siberian Military District. He was dismissed from the army and became chief of the military department of the Bashkir Agricultural Institute at Ufa in June 1948. Sakhnov died in Moscow on 8 March 1950, and was buried at the Vvedenskoye Cemetery. He was survived by a son, Vyacheslav, who coached basketball at Bashkir State University.  Awards and honors  Sakhnov was a recipient of the following decorations: * Order of Lenin (21 February 1945) * Order of the Red Banner (3 November 1944) Both awards were made as a reward for the length of his service in the Red Army.

Biography  Jan Frederik K√∂nig was born in Langelsheim in the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. K√∂nig made a career in the colonial administration of the Dutch Gold Coast, being appointed on 12 May 1801 as resident of Fort Amsterdam at Kormantin. On 13 December 1803 he became commandant of Fort Saint Anthony at Axim. When the acting governor-general Isaac de Roever repatriated to the Batavian Republic to recover from illness on 16 June 1805, K√∂nig as the most senior resident on the Gold Coast was the logical successor. Instead, Pieter Linthorst was appointed by the Small Council, of which K√∂nig was not a member. K√∂nig protested the procedure, but nevertheless accepted the decision made. After acting governor Johannes Petrus Hoogenboom died on 4 August 1808, K√∂nig became acting governor-general. During K√∂nig's time in office, Elmina was attacked by the Fante during the Ga‚ÄìFante War. One of the reasons given by the Fante for their attack of Elmina was the activity of Jan Nieser, a Euro-African merchant based in Elmina, whom they accused of inciting the Asante to invade Fante during the Ashanti‚ÄìFante War of 1806‚Äì1807. The siege was still ongoing when the recently arrived Abraham de Veer was installed as commandant-general on 5 March 1810 to succeed K√∂nig. De Veer's appointment referred specifically to the disputes among the colonial administrators on the Gold Coast, and it was De Veer's first and foremost task to put an end to these disputes by putting a \\"new order of business\\" in place. K√∂nig died soon after, on 17 April 1810.

The approximately double-track deviation was constructed from 1911 to 1913 and replaced the single-track first Glenbrook deviation and the first Glenbrook Tunnel.  History  In 1890 it was proposed to bypass the troublesome Lapstone Zig Zag by using a tunnel. This proposal was approved and in March 1891 tenders were called for its construction. The line left Bottom Points and continued into a gully before entering the tunnel, on a continuous 1-in-33 gradient. After emerging just below the original alignment, the line curved to the left and ascended slightly before rejoining the original line at Glenbrook. The site of the original Glenbrook Station now lies to the right of the Great Western Highway, near the skate park. However, the deviation soon proved to be somewhat of a disaster. Even if it did eliminate the Zig Zag which restricted train length, the problem was the design of the tunnel. The first problem was the climb, the tunnel being on a steep, continuous 1-in-33 gradient. The second and main problem was ventilation. The tunnel was single- track, which made the dimensions tight, and towards one end was a curve, which made the ventilation even worse. Passengers found themselves fighting off smoke and fumes from the locomotive. Trains would begin slipping halfway through the tunnel, forcing engine crews to retreat for air. In one incident of 1908, a retreating train met with another down goods train in a collision at the tunnel mouth. In 1910, work started on a new deviation when the Main Western Line over the Blue Mountains was being duplicated at the time. The second Glenbrook deviation replaced the 1-in-33 deviation with a more gentle 1-in-60 ruling grade across Glenbrook Gorge. This deviation remains in current use.

Early life He was born in what was then Manchuria on 12 February 1912, to a Russian mother and Dutch-born British father of Polish heritage who imported Willys-Overland vehicles into the country. His love of photography started when he received a camera for his 10th birthday, shortly before the family moved back to Britain for his secondary education and to escape the plague which was spreading in Harbin. He graduated from King's College in London, however his love of photography and cars combined when he started racing single seater sports cars around nearby racing circuits such as Brooklands. He befriended many drivers, and after retiring from racing following a motorcycle crash in 1933, began taking action shots and selling the resulting photos to the drivers. Career During the war, he joined the Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development where he photographed new weapons being deployed as part of their assessment. Most famously, he photographed Barnes Wallis' Bouncing Bombs to record their size, trajectory and speed. Whilst he photographed and published books on several marques, he is most closely associated with Aston Martin. He was asked to take pictures of the new Lagonda in 1947, and when David Brown bought that company the same year to merge with Aston Martin, Klemantaski came too. He then did most of the advertising photography for the next 10 years and more, and followed the racing team during a golden period which peaked with the triumph at Le Mans in 1959 and victory in the world sportscar championship. As well as being beside the circuit during races such as Le Mans and the Spa 24, he also sat in the passenger seat during 3 Monte Carlo rallies and 5 Mille Miglias, documenting the exploits of those in the driving seat. These included acting as navigator/photographer for his great friends Reg Parnell (1954 Mille Miglia in an Aston DB3S), Paul Frere (1955 Mille Miglia in an Aston DB2) and Peter Collins (1956 Mille Miglia in a Ferrari 860 Monza). Peter Collins and Louis Klemantaski in a Ferrari 860 Monza at the Mille Miglia, 29th April 1956 In one of his most famous photos he was there to capture the moment that Carroll Shelby crossed the line to take the 1959 Le Mans victory in an Aston DBR1/300. With Aston Martin achieving their ambition, they decided to quit sportscar racing, and Klemantaski decided this was his moment to retire from woking with Aston Martin, frustrated by new safety regulations which forced him further from the action and saddened by the death of his friend Peter Collins. He then devoted his time to portrait photography, though he continued to attend and photograph at sportscar events until his permanent retirement in 1974. He published many collections of his photographs during his life, including limited editions such as 'Klemantaski & Aston Martin' with Chris Nixon in 1998, the last one before his death aged 89 in 2001.Klemantaski & Aston Martin, published by Automobilia in 1998 ISBN 88-7960-08903 In 1989, he sold his entire library to Peter Sachs, who established the Klemantaski collection, combining Louis' work with a dozen other car photographers in an archive which lists in excess of 50,000 motor sport images.

During the battle, the \\"Righteous army\\" (a civilian militia) led by Jeong Mun- bu executed rebels and repelled the Japanese army. Battle of Bukgwan at Doosan Encyclopedia Background The Japanese 2nd Army, led by Kat≈ç Kiyomasa, captured Hanyang in May 1592. The 2nd Army then marched on Hamgyong province. At the time, the residents of Hamgyong were discriminated against by the Joseon government leading to wide spread opposition . The hostility they felt escalated when Prince Imhae and Sunhwa plundered the province of clothes, foods, and other necessities. Guk Gyeong-in and his uncle Guk Se-pil handed the two princes over to the Japanese. Guk Gyeong-in at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture There was a rise in civil unrest due to Japanese exploitation of the residents Ji Dal-won sensed the change of popular opinion and asked Jeong Mun- bu, who had been hiding, to form and lead a righteous army. Jeong Mun-bu accepted the proposal and raised an army. The army went on to take and hold Kyongsong where Guk Se-pil was stationed. Mun-bu then issued a declaration calling for all to join the army. Jeong Hyeon-ryong, Oh Eung-tae, and other soldiers joined the newly formed army. Veritable Records of Seonjo (revision) 25th September BattleExecution of Rebels= In response to the occupation of Kyongsong by the righteous army the Japanese detached 100 scout forces to survey the situation. Thereupon, Kang Mun-woo and his cavalry repelled them. Jeong Mun-bu executed Guk Se-pil before the planned retaking of Kilju. Mun-bu posted a notice stating a righteous army had been raised and called for the execution of rebels including Guk Gyeong-in and Jeong Mal-su. Shin Se-jun, a student of Confucianism living in Hoeryong, set fire to the house of Guk Gyeong-in and killed him. Shin Se-jun at Doosan Encyclopedia Veritable Records of Seonjo (revision) 25th October During a peasant revolt Jeong Mal-su was killed. Jeong Mun-bu then ordered Gu Hwang and Kang Mun-woo to recapture Myongchon, which they did. Jeong Mun-bu at Doosan Encyclopedia =Battle of Kilju= Jeong Mun-bu besieged Kilju splitting his troops into groups of three. In late October 1592, Jeong Mun-bu ambushed the Japanese army who were returning from a nearby town that they had looted and slaughtered its residents. The Japanese in Kilju closed the fortress and reinforced their defence. Jeong Mun-bu surrounded them and prevented them from getting firewood. Around December, Jeong Mun-bu defeated the Japanese reinforcements in Ssangpo. On 19 January 1593, the isolated Japanese force tried to escape but their attempt failed when they were ambushed. On 22 January, Jeong Mun-bu and his 200 cavalry troops attacked and delivered a devastating blow to the Japanese army in Tanchon, south of Kilju. Kato Kiyomasa received a report that Kilju was in danger and marched north, leading over 20,000 soldiers. Jeong Mun-bu withdrew his forces from Tanchon after Kiyomasa crossed Macheollyeong.Veritable Records of Seonjo (revision) 26th January - 5 Jeong Mun-bu ambushed Kato and his troops in Immyong but failed and withdrew. Kato met the isolated army and retreated to Anbyon that night.

On 29 February, Kato arrived at Hanyang and saw they lost 8,864 of 22,000 soldiers and decided to retreat. After the retreat of the Japanese, the righteous army disbanded and Yoon Tak-yeon took command. There was friction between Jeong Mun-bu and Yoon Tak-yeon, who took undue credit for the victory.

Carpenter won in the general election on November 6, 2018, took office on January 16, 2019, and his term will end on January 24, 2021. Life Carpenter graduated from Nikiski High School in 1993. After graduation, he joined the United States Army, serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in Turkey and Kuwait with the United States Air Force. Afterward, Carpenter joined the Alaska Army National Guard, in which he was a special staff officer in the commanding general‚Äôs office. He later retired from the National Guard. Carpenter grows peonies and was president of the Alaska Peony Market Cooperative. Career in office In 2018, Carpenter won election against independent candidate Shawn Butler by a significant margin, winning a 68.8% majority, despite his opponent raising and spending a much larger amount of campaign funds. Carpenter is a member of the Alaska House Finance Committee. In 2019 Carpenter introduced a bill to stop the state of Alaska from reimbursing local municipalities for school bond debt, effectively reducing state funding of public schools by $139 million. In March 2020, Carpenter joined other Republicans of the Alaska House in unsuccessfully opposing Alaska House Bill 221, which would officially recognize the 229 tribes in Alaska that are already recognized at the federal level. In February 2020, during a budget vote in which fellow Republican David Eastman tried to add amendments eliminating a $5000 line item to be paid to Planned Parenthood to reimburse it for court fees for an earlier lawsuit against the state of Alaska, Carpenter stood by the award. While noting that he didn't like where the money was going, he asserted the state had lost a case in court which by law required it to make the payment. Like other Republicans in the Alaska House, Carpenter opposes abortion. On all other matters of the day, Carpenter stood with Eastman. Comparison of COVID-19 public health measures to Nazi Germany Carpenter believes people are \\"overreacting\\" to the coronavirus pandemic, and that this is unacceptably curtailing people's liberties. In 2020, Carpenter attracted significant criticism when he sent a mass email to all of his colleagues, comparing health screening stickers to the yellow badges that Jews were forced to wear during the Holocaust. Carpenter objected to a new requirement in his workplace that required wearing a sticker to indicate one has been screened for COVID-19 in order to be permitted to enter the Capitol building, saying, \\"If my sticker falls off, do I get a new one or do I get public shaming too? Are the stickers available as a yellow Star of David?\\" The House had been in recess since March due to COVID-19 concerns, and the new protocols were part of a plan to insure safety as the House was planning to re-convene the week of May 18, 2020 to settle matters relating to a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the distribution of federal COVID-19 relief funds. Carpenter's colleague Grier Hopkins, who is Jewish, immediately wrote back to say, \\"Ben, this is disgusting. Keep your Holocaust jokes to yourself.\\" Carpenter was called on to apologize by several colleagues both within and without the Republican party‚Äîthough several Republican colleagues, like Sarah Vance, supported his statements. Carpenter at first refused to apologize and instead continued to justify his remarks. In a later interview he said, \\"Can we even say it is totally out of the realm of possibility that COVID-19 patients will be rounded up and taken somewhere?\\" In the same interview he claimed that Adolf Hitler was not a white supremacist, and that Hitler was just \\"fearful of the Jewish nation\\". Later he said, \\"If there were more people standing up for the loss of liberties prior to World War II, maybe we wouldn‚Äôt have had the Holocaust.\\" After attracting a fresh round of criticism from these subsequent comments, Carpenter continued to justify them, sending text messages to the interviewer, saying: \\"The point was that it was fear that drove him. The attention of his fear was undesirables, including Jews. And the larger point is that PEOPLE FOLLOWED HIM.\\" A few days later, Carpenter wrote an apology by way of an op-ed in Must Read Alaska, a publication funded in part by the Alaska GOP. Carpenter wrote, \\"My email comments have been perceived by many to be offensive. For any offense taken, I apologize because my words are my responsibility.\\" At the time Carpenter wrote the original email, 10 Alaskans had died from COVID-19.

It is based on a figurative interpretation of the prophecy of Revelation 20:1-4 about the millennial reign of Christ together with the righteous.Valeriy Sterkh, \\"Apocalypse. Millennium: Chiliasm and Chillegorism\\" (Ekaterinburg, 2020), Section 1. Definition Chillegorism does not fall under one general definition acceptable to its adepts, and it is difficult to come up with a summary of this doctrine. To understand the diversity of chillegorical approaches, it makes sense to consider the classification of Chillegorism in its main forms.\\"Anthology of Chiliasm and Chillegorism\\" (Compiler V. Sterkh), Section 7. The two types of Chillegorism are Postmillennialism and Amillennialism. Postmillennialism, or Postmillenarism, is a type of Chillegorism which teaches that the Second Coming of Christ will occur after the millennial reign of the righteous; the reign here is understood as something already happening or something that will happen in the future. In Postmillenarism, the Millennium is seen as not exactly a 1,000 years but as an extended period of some limited duration. Amillennialism is a type of Chillegorism which teaches that there will be no millennial reign of the righteous on earth. Amillennarists interpret the thousand years symbolically to refer either to a temporary bliss of souls in heaven before the general resurrection, or to the infinite bliss of the righteous after the general resurrection. Some researchers see no fundamental difference between Postmillennialism and Amillennialism, i.e. adhere to Chillegorism.Nikolay Kim, \\"The Millennial Kingdom.

He oversaw the dismantling of the Church's presence there with the end of French colonial rule in Tunisia. He then worked in Iraq as both archbishop and diplomat from 1965 to 1970 and ended his career as the Holy See's representative in Ethiopia from 1970 to 1972. Biography Maurice Perrin was born on 30 June 1904 in Grenoble, France. He moved to Tunisia as a child and studied there and in Beirut before earning an engineering degree in France in 1927. He worked as an engineer in northern France for three years before returning to Tunis and entering the seminary. He was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Carthage, Tunisia, on 29 June 1936. On 7 June 1947, Pope Pius XII appointed him titular archbishop of Utica and auxiliary bishop of Carthage. He received his episcopal consecration on 28 October 1947 from Charles-Albert Gounot, Archbishop of Carthage. On 29 October 1953, Pope Pius named him Archbishop of Carthage. Perrin became Archbishop as Tunisia was struggling to establish its independence from France. Having achieved its independence on 20 March 1956, Tunisia then asserted its national aspirations against the Europeans, including restrictions on Christian worship. After years of negotiations, the Holy See and Tunisia signed an agreement called a modus vivendi that ceded all but a few Church properties to the government. On 9 July 1964, the Archdiocese of Carthage was reorganized as the Territorial Prelature of Tunis. Perrin became the Territorial Prelate and titular archbishop of Nova. He held that post of territorial prelate for exactly six months before leaving Tunisia \\"at the request of the government\\" and receiving from Pope Paul the honorific title of Assistant to the Papal throne on 4 January 1965. Pope Paul VI named Perrin Apostolic Delegate to Iraq on 31 July 1965 and Archbishop of Baghdad on 2 August. He was the first representative of the Holy See given diplomatic status by the Iraqi Republic. His pastoral role was minimal. On 14 October 1966 his title changed to Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Iraq. On 16 January 1970, Pope Paul appointed him Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Ethiopia and titular archbishop of Gurza. He retired at age 68 as he was replaced in Ethiopia in November 1972 by Ippolito Rotoli.

As a two-year-old in 2003 she showed great promise by winning her first race and then taking the Group 3 Prix de Cond√© against male opposition. In the following spring she won the Prix Vanteaux before recording her biggest victory in the Prix de Diane but was unplaced in three subsequent starts that year. In 2005 she was campaigned in North Anerica where she won the Waya Stakes and running second in the E. P. Taylor Stakes. She won one minor race in 2006 before being retired from racing at the end of the year. As a broodmare she had some success as a dam of winners. Background Latice is a chestnut mare with white blaze bred in Ireland by Petra Bloodstock. As a yearling in August 2002 she was offered for sale at Deauville but failed to reach her reserve price. She was subsequently acquired by Enrico Camici and sent into training with Jean-Marie B√©guign√© at Chantilly in France. As a daughter of the Hungerford Stakes winner Inchinor, Latice was a product of the Byerley Turk sire line, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who descend directly from the Darley Arabian. Inchinor, who died in 2003, sired over five hundred other winners including Notnowcato, Summoner and Cape of Good Hope. Latice's dam Laramie showed no racing ability in a brief track career, finishing unplaced in both of her starts, but did much better as a broodmare, producing Lawman and the Prix du Palais Royal winner Satri. She was descended from Picture Play who won the 1000 Guineas in 1944 and was the female-line ancestor of numerous major winners. Racing career2003: two-year-old season= Latice made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over 1600 metres on good-to-soft ground at Fontainebleau Racecourse on 8 September in which she started the 2.3/1 favourite in a four-runner field. Ridden by Ioritz Mendizabal she looked unlikely to obtain a clear run before breaking through along the rail in the last 150 metres to win by three quarters of a length from Siberian Highness. On 19 October the filly was moved up in class and matched against male opposition in the Group 3 Prix de Cond√© over 1800 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Starting a 12.5/1 outsider she was settled towards the rear of the six-runner field by Christophe Lemaire before producing a strong late run to overtake Voix du Nord 50 metres from the finish and win by half a length. The form of the race was boosted when Voix du Nord won the Group 1 Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud in November. =2004: three-year-old season= On her first run as a three-year-old Latice was ridden by Christophe Soumillon when she started the 0.7/1 favourite for the Group 3 Prix Vanteaux over 1800 metres on very soft ground at Longchamp on 2 May. After tracking the leaders she took the lead approaching the last 200 metres and kept on well to win by a length from Asti with Green Swallow in third. Soumillon was again in the saddle when the filly started the 2.75/1 favourite for the Group 1 Prix de Diane over 2100 meters at Chantilly Racecourse on 13 June. Her sixteen opponents included Torrestrella (winner of the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches), Asti, Alexander Goldrun, Ask For the Moon (Prix Saint-Alary), Grey Lilas (Prix de la Grotte), Colony Band (Prix Melisande), Menhoubah (Oaks d'Italia) and Steel Princess (Prix Cl√©op√¢tre). Latice was restrained at the rear of the field until turning into the straight when she began to make rapid progress on the outside. Despite drifting to the right she overtook Grey Lilas 150 metres from the finish and won by three quarters of a length from Millionaia. After the race B√©guign√© said: \\"That was fantastic and Latice is an exceptional filly. She has an amazing ability to accelerate and stays. I was feeling confident all through the race. For a long time I knew that I had a Prix de Diane winner in my stable. Latice will now have a rest and we will bring her back for the autumn with the Arc de Triomphe in mind.\\" After a break of almost three months Latice returned in the Prix Vermeille on 12 September over 2400 metres at Longchamp when she was matched against older fillies and mares. Starting the 1.1/1 favourite she took the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the last 100 metres and finished eighth in a blanket finish, beaten less than two lengths by the four-year-old winner Sweet Stream. On 3 October the filly started a 28/1 outsider for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over the same course and distance. Ridden by Mick Kinane she raced in mid- division before staying on well in the straight to come home seventh of the nineteen runners behind Bago. For her final run of the year Latice was sent to Sha Tin Racecourse to contest the Hong Kong Cup on 12 December but made little impact and finished tenth behind Alexander Goldrun. In the 2004 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Latice was given a rating of 117, making her the fifty-seventh best racehorse in the world and the third best three-year- old filly behind Ouija Board and Attraction. In December Latice was scheduled to be auctioned at Tattersalls but was acquired privately by George W. Strawbridge Jr.. =2005: four-year-old season= For the 2005 season, Latice was transferred to race in the United States where she was trained by Jonathan Sheppard and raced in the clours of Strawbridge's Augustin Stable. On her North American debut the filly started favourite for the Waya Stakes over one and a half miles at Saratoga Race Course in August and won by one and three quarter lengths having taken the lead on the far turn. After running third behind Spotlight and With Affection when carrying top weight of 123 pounds in the Cicada Stakes at Delaware Park Racetrack Latice was stepped up in class for the E. P. Taylor Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack on 23 October. Ridden by Jos√© Santos she took the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten half a length by Honey Ryder. On her final race of the year Latice started favourite for the Long Island Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack on 5 November but came home fifth behind Olaya. =2006: five-year-old season= Latice began her fourth campaign in an allowance race on 15 April over one mile at Keeneland in which she was ridden by John Velasquez and won by half a length from Rich In Spirit. She then finished sixth to Honey Ryder in the Sheepshead Bay Handicap at Belmont Park in May, second to Film Maker in the All Along Stakes at Colonial Downs in June and third to Honey Ryder in the Robert G. Dick Memorial Stakes at Delaware Park in July. On 4 September Latice finished second to Noble Stella in the Glens Falls Stakes at Saratoga and then contested her second E. P. Taylor Stakes in which she came home fifth of the ten runners behind Arravale. After coming home ninth in the April Run Stakes at Laurel Park on 25 November Latice was retired from racing. Sheppard commented \\"She came out of her last race bleeding from the sole of one of her feet and was lame. With what she accomplished, it was best to send her home to be a broodmare.\\" Breeding record At the end of her racing career Latice was retired to become a broodmare. She produced at least seven foals and four winners: *Love of Flying, a bay colt (later gelded), foaled in 2008, sired by Forestry. Won three races. *Fencing, bay colt (gelded), 2009, by Street Cry. Won two races, namely the Washington Singer Stakes and the Paradise Stakes. *Obsidian, bay colt (gelded), 2011, by Street Cry.

Bush on December 20, 2006. The bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Tom Davis, a Republican from Virginia, and cosponsored by Republican John M. McHugh of New York and Democrats Henry Waxman of California and Danny K. Davis of Illinois. As the chair of the Senate Oversight committee, Senator Susan Collins of Maine shepherded the bill's passage through the Senate. The bill was approved during the lame duck session of the 109th Congress, and approved without objection via voice vote. PAEA was the first major overhaul of the United States Postal Service (USPS) since 1970. It reorganized the Postal Rate Commission, compelled the USPS to pay in advance for the health and retirement benefits of all of its employees for at least 50 years, and stipulated that the price of postage could not increase faster than the rate of inflation. It also mandated the USPS to deliver six days of the week. According to Tom Davis, the Bush administration threatened to veto the legislation unless they added the provision regarding funding the employee benefits in advance with the objective of using that money to reduce the federal deficit. When he signed the bill on December 20, 2006, Bush issued a signing statement that says that the government can open mail under emergency conditions, though Waxman asserted that the government cannot do this without a search warrant. Between 2007 and 2016, the USPS lost $62.4 billion; the inspector general of the USPS estimated that $54.8 billion of that was due to prefunding retiree benefits. By the end of 2019, the USPS had $160.9 billion in debt, due to growth of the Internet, the Great Recession, and prepaying for employee benefits as stipulated in PAEA. Mail volume decreased from 97 billion to 68 billion items from 2006 to 2012. The employee benefits cost the USPS about $5.5 billion per year; USPS began defaulting on this payment in 2012. The COVID-19 pandemic further reduced income due to decreased demand in 2020. The latest quarterly financials of the USPS do not suggest the COVID-19 pandemic further reduced income due to decreased demand in 2020. According to Bloomberg, prefunding the health benefits of retirees \\"is a requirement that no other entity, private or public, has to make\\". Columnist Dan Casey wrote in a July 2014 op- ed in The Roanoke Times that the PAEA is \\"one of the most insane laws Congress ever enacted\\". Bill Pascrell, a Democratic House member from New Jersey, said in 2019 that it was rushed through Congress without due consideration, and referred to it as \\"one of the worst pieces of legislation Congress has passed in a generation\\". In May 2020, a segment on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver examined the law and its impact on the USPS, demonstrating that it has contributed to its debt. It has been alleged that this legislation contributed to the 2020 United States Postal Service crisis. References Category:Presidency of George W.

The series premiered on August 23, 2020 on HBO. In October 2020, the series was renewed for a second season. Premise The Vow follows members who joined the self-improvement group NXIVMwhose leader, Keith Raniere, was convicted of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, among other crimesand reveals the emotional toll of unfolding events. Former members Sarah Edmondson, Mark Vicente, Bonnie Piesse, Anthony Ames, Barbara Bouchey, Susan Dones, Toni Natalie, and Toni Zarattini appear in the series, alongside journalists Frank Parlato who helped start initial reporting on the criminal activity of NXIVM, and Barry Meier. Catherine Oxenberg appears in the series as she attempts to rescue her daughter, India. The second season of the series will feature Raniere and co-founder of NXIVM, Nancy Salzman. Clare Bronfman's sentencing was taped for the second season. EpisodesProduction Production on the series began in 2017, initially focusing on Sarah Edmondson, Mark Vicente, Bonnie Piesse, Anthony Ames, and Catherine Oxenberg as a way to document their escape from NXIVM as they were fearful of being sued by Clare Bronfman, and wanted to protect themselves by having it taped. Despite a significant storyline focusing on Oxenberg attempting to rescue her daughter India from the cult, Oxenberg chose not to have their reunion filmed. India Oxenberg decided not to participate in the series as she was not ready at the time of production to share her story. Jehane Noujaim and Karim Amer initially didn't set out to make a documentary series on the show, but after Noujaim took NXIVM courses after being recruited by Sara Bronfman, they had begun to hear about abuse within the organization and began documenting. In April 2019, it was announced the series had been greenlit by HBO, with HBO Documentary Films producing. In September 2020, in an interview with Variety Noujaim stated \\"We reached out to everybody involved ‚Äî many people, on all sides of the story ‚Äî and we are continuing to film.\\" On October 16, 2020, HBO renewed the series for a second season.

It was initially launched on lightweight front-engined chassis, but it was latterly built on mid-engined and heavyweight chassis as well. A variant of the Viceroy was the Duple Viceroy Express, which had a bus-type entrance door making it suitable for stage carriage work. History In 1966 Duple's standard 'Bella' family of coach bodies for full-sized front-engined chassis was sold under a variety of model names specific to the chassis: Bella Venture (Bedford VAM), Empress (Ford R192), Mariner (Ford R226) and Vega Major (Bedford VAL), all of which were built at Duple's original Hendon factory in North London. For heavyweight and other mid-engined chassis the larger- windowed Commander body was built at the Duple (Northern) factory in Blackpool, and the similar Viscount was also built in Blackpool as an alternative, premium body for the VAM and R192. Duple's coach designs were usually updated every two or three years, and for the 1967 season the range was due a major re-design. Duple had been losing sales to its main rival Plaxton, whose large-windowed Panorama model was making Duple's Bella range look dated. The new Viceroy model announced in August 1966 sought to address this and to outdo Plaxton by not only making the windows longer, but also providing large quarterlight windows above the cantrail level. Although quarterlights had long been available as an option on many coach bodies these were usually small curved glass or perspex windows which tended to look like an afterthought on large-windowed coaches like the Commander and Panorama, whereas those on the Viceroy were much longer and were made of flat glass angled slightly inwards towards the roof. The effect was to make the upper half of the coach aft of the angled window pillar appear to be entirely glazed when viewed from the side. The preceding Bella family had as its distinctive styling feature one window pillar over the rear axle raked sharply back, and the Viceroy achieved similar distinctiveness by having the pillar behind the front axle raked forward. The original Viceroy was deliberately angular in its styling, with its chrome trim laid out to accentuate the raked window pillar and the stepped window line at the cantrail. Production of the new Viceroy range began at Hendon in late 1966 for the 1967 sales season, on Bedford VAL/VAM and Ford R192/R226 chassis. Bodies on the 32-foot VAM and R192 could seat up to 45 passengers, whereas the longer 36-foot Viceroy 36 on the VAL and R226 seated up to 52. Initially the Viscount body remained in production at Blackpool, but it was soon eclipsed by the Viceroy and was dropped after the 1967 season, by which time production of the Viceroy 36 on the three-axle Bedford VAL chassis had already been transferred to Blackpool. For the 1968 and 1969 seasons Blackpool also built Viceroy 36/37 bodies on the R226, leaving the Hendon factory with the shorter VAM and R192 Viceroys and the smaller Duple models until its closure in early 1970, whereupon all manufacture was transferred to Blackpool. One of the last chassis to be bodied at Hendon was a pre-production Bedford YRQ, the first mid-engined chassis to receive a Viceroy body. A facelift for the Viceroy range was announced at the 1968 Commercial Motor Show for the 1969 season. The angular styling of the original Viceroy was toned down and the facelift sought instead to emphasise the horizontal lines of the body with a new chromework layout, a wider front grille and revised headlamp and front bumper designs. By this time the maximum length for UK buses and coaches had been increased to 12 metres (39' 4\\") and the facelift also included a slight increase in length for the VAL and R226 bodies, henceforth known as the Viceroy 37 and seating up to 53. Despite the facelifts for the Viceroy and Commander, rivals Plaxton had again stolen the march on Duple with the launch of their own new model at the same show. With its even larger curved-glass windows, the Plaxton Panorama Elite made the Viceroy and (especially) the Commander look dated and Duple fell behind Plaxton in sales for the first time during the 1969 season. Faced with the need to design a completely new model to challenge the Panorama Elite while at the same time transferring production from Hendon to Blackpool, Duple had no immediate answer to this problem, and the Viceroy range did not receive any major styling changes for the remainder of its production life. In its final years the Viceroy became available on a wider range of chassis. The Commander body had been dropped in 1970, so for the 1971 and 1972 seasons the Viceroy and Viceroy 37 were made available on heavyweight mid-engined AEC Reliance and Leyland Leopard chassis, although production of these totalled only 66 because the increasingly dated Viceroy was no match for the Panorama Elite at the premium end of the coach market. Much more significant in sales terms was the Bedford YRQ which replaced the VAM in late 1970. For the final 1972 season the Viceroy was also built on the front-engined Seddon Pennine 6 in 10-, 11- and 12-metre lengths, the latter being the first 12m coaches built by Duple and seating 57. During 1972 the three-axle Bedford VAL model was replaced by the more conventional mid-engined Bedford YRT, and although Duple had not initially intended to offer the outgoing Viceroy range on the new chassis one batch of five Viceroy 37s was built to a special order for Edinburgh Corporation Transport, which needed the vehicles before the new Dominant body would be available. The British Government's \\"Bus Grant\\" provided a 50% subsidy towards the cost of new service buses, but did not apply to coaches. However, many operators used their coaches on local bus services as well as coaching, particularly in the winter months when coach business was quieter. For the 1972 season the Viceroy Express body was built on YRQ and R192 chassis, this having bus-type doors and other modifications to make them suitable for OMO (one-man operation) stage carriage services. Provided such vehicles spent a specified proportion of their annual mileage working bus services they qualified for the subsidy. Despite being increasingly outmoded the Viceroy, along with the smaller Vista and Vega, continued to sell well on lightweight chassis until the end of production. For the 1972 season Duple's total output was 1,034 bodies, its highest for several years and only 251 below that of market leader Plaxton. Replacement At the end of 1972 the all new Duple Dominant was launched to replace the Viceroy. The Dominant was heavily influenced by the styling of the Plaxton Panorama Elite, with the same large curved windows and the added advantage of being of all-metal construction. Viceroy bodies remained a common sight on Britain's roads well into the 1980s, but their timber-framed construction and the fact that they were almost all built on less durable lightweight chassis meant that by the end of the decade very few were still in use as coaches. Accidents and Incidents A Duple Viceroy was involved in the Dibbles Bridge coach crash in 1975, Britain's worst ever road accident. After the brakes on a 1967 Bedford VAM5 failed it ran out of control down a steep gradient and rolled over on the curve at the bottom, falling over the side of a bridge and landing on and crushing its roof. The coach had carried a full load of 45 passengers plus the driver, of whom only 13 passengers survived. The accident led to tougher structural standards for coach bodywork, although by that time Duple and other manufacturers had already switched from wooden frames to stronger all-metal bodies.

High school career Along with Shellie McMillon and Paxton Lumpkin, Brown was a part of a nucleus of players that formed a formidable DuSable team that won Chicago Public League championships in the 1952‚Äì53 and 1953‚Äì54 seasons. In 1954, the team advanced to the Illinois state finals as the first all-black team to compete ‚Äúdownstate.‚Äú Locally dubbed the ‚ÄúWonder Five,‚Äù the team lost the championship game 72‚Äì70 to Mt. Vernon. Brown was named to the all-tournament team and in 2006 was named one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament in celebration of the Illinois High School Association's 100th season. College career Brown started his college career at Indiana, enrolling along with high school teammate Lumpkin in Fall 1954 as a part of a recruiting class that also included future National Basketball Association (NBA) player Archie Dees. Freshmen were not eligible to play varsity sports per NCAA rules of the time, but the heralded freshmen narrowly lost to the defending national champion varsity team in a preseason game - partly due to intervention by the coaching staff, including benching the sweet-shooting Brown once the freshmen had built a sizable lead. Brown prepared to join the varsity for the 1955‚Äì56 season, but there was controversy as Brown and Lumpkin played with their former DuSable teammates in an amateur AAU tournament in April. This violated a Big Ten Conference rule that athletes could not compete as a representative of anyone other than their schools without forfeiting a year of eligibility. However, Hoosiers coach Branch McCracken successfully appealed the decision as the players had sought guidance prior to appearing in the event. Brown joined the Hoosiers for the season and quickly established himself as a scoring threat, averaging 14.8 points in the team's first 12 games and leading the team in scoring in Big Ten contests. His Hoosier career came to an end on January 31, 1956, when it was announced that Brown would be academically ineligible for the second semester. Brown left Indiana after this decision. Brown chose Seattle to compete his college career, sitting out he 1956‚Äì57 season as a transfer and joining the team and its star Elgin Baylor for the 1957‚Äì58 campaign. Brown, with his strong outside shooting, rebounding and defense, proved to be a good complement to the All-American Baylor. He averaged 10.6 points on the year, good for second on the team. During the 1958 NCAA Tournament, Brown hit two clutch shots in the Chieftains' West Regional Final against California in San Francisco. He first hit a mid-range jump shot with ten seconds remaining to send the game into overtime. He then hit a 25-foot shot with ten seconds left in overtime to seal the 66‚Äì62 win and a spot in the school's first Final Four. In the Final Four, the Chieftains upset favored Kansas State, but lost the championship game to Kentucky. With the departure of Baylor to the NBA, the Chieftains did not make the NCAA Tournament the next season, though they did achieve a season record of 23‚Äì6. Brown did enjoy a larger role with the team, settling into his role as the top scoring option. At the close of the season, Brown was named a third-team All-American by United Press International (UPI) after averaging 18 points and 11 rebounds per game. Post-college career After the close of his college career, Brown was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals in the 11th round (72nd pick overall) of the 1959 NBA draft. However, he did not play in the NBA, instead joining the Army and then playing Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball in Seattle and Chicago. He then settled into a career as a social worker in Chicago, but remained active in basketball as a high school referee and an organizer of local tournaments and leagues.

This concept is of considerable importance in functional analysis and the famous open mapping theorem gives a sufficient condition for a continuous linear map between Fr√©chet spaces to be a topological homorphism.  Definitions  :Definition: A TVS embedding or a topological monomorphism is an injective topological homomorphism. Equivalently, a TVS-embedding is a linear map that is also a topological embedding.  Characterizations  Suppose that u : X ‚Üí Y is a linear map between TVSs and note that u can be decomposed into the composition of the following canonical linear maps: :X \\\\overset{\\\\pi}{\\\\to} X / \\\\operatorname{ker} u \\\\overset{u_0}{\\\\to} \\\\operatorname{Im} u \\\\overset{\\\\operatorname{In}}{\\\\to} Y where \\\\pi : X \\\\to X / \\\\operatorname{ker} u is the canonical quotient map and \\\\operatorname{In} : \\\\operatorname{Im} u \\\\to Y is the natural inclusion. The following are equivalent: 1. u is a topological homomorphism; 2. for every neighborhood base \\\\mathcal{U} of the origin in X, u\\\\left( \\\\mathcal{U} \\\\right) is a neighborhood base of the origin in Y; 3. the induced map u_0 : X / \\\\operatorname{ker} u \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Im} u is an isomorphism of TVSs.

The tourist navigation service of the Naviglio Grande is active for it The hydrography of Milan and the area of the neighboring municipalities is particularly complex, both for natural causes, given the conspicuous presence of rivers, streams and fountains that form a real water tangle, and for issues related to the work of canalization and diversion of waterways made by man, having their beginning during the Roman era, which led to the creation of numerous irrigation ditches, canals and lakes. The territory of Milan is very rich in water, given that the city is on the \\"fontanili line\\", where there is an encounter, underground, between geological layers with different permeability, a situation that allows deep waters to resurface , especially in the south-west area of Milan, where the composition of the ground together with the groundwater level allows it to rise. The first description of the hydrography of Milan was made by Bonvesin de la Riva, an Italian writer and poet who lived between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The most important waterways affecting Milan and its metropolitan area are the Lambro, Olona and Seveso rivers, the Bozzente, Garbogera, Lura, Merlata and Pudiga rivers, the navigable canals Naviglio della Martesana, Naviglio Grande, Naviglio Pavese, Naviglio di Bereguardo, Naviglio di Paderno and Vettabbia, and the artificial waterways Canale Ticinello, Canale Vetra, Cavo Redefossi, Cavo Ticinello and Southern Lambro. In Milan there are also two important artificial basins, the Darsena di Porta Ticinese and the Idroscalo of Milan. Among the noteworthy architectures connected to them, there are several navigation basins (including the Conca dell'Incoronata, the Conca di Viarenna, the Conca Fallata and the Conchetta), some water mills (including Molino Dorino and Mulino Vettabbia ) and the Gabelle bridge.  Territory  Panorama of Milan and the Sempione Park in October. Milan rests on a single type of soil of fluvio-glacial origin with carbonate cement, common to the whole Po Valley. The main characteristic is that of being easily karst. This rock is covered by Quaternary river sediments and is visible along the main rivers, forming conglomerates which in Lombardy are known as \\"strains\\".  Generality  The rivers belonging to the Milanese hydrography (starting from the east and going counterclockwise) are the Lambro, the Naviglio della Martesana, the Seveso, the Olona-Lambro Meridionale axis, the Naviglio Grande and the Naviglio Pavese: together the five streams form the backbone of the entire water system that flows south-east. To the south of Milan are the three city treatment plants (from east to west: Peschiera Borromeo, Milan Nosedo and Milan San Rocco) which treat the wastewater of the Lombard metropolis, and the different canals whose waters, after having irrigated the plain, have final delivery the Po. To the north, to cut the Upper Milanese horizontally intersecting the Ticino and the Adda, the Villoresi Canal flows. On the municipal territory of Milan there is also an extensive network of natural and artificial waterways that have been inherited from the past, whose overall development is 370 kilometers. Most of these small streams flow into covered riverbeds. Of these, about 200 kilometers, concern the network of main or secondary waterways; the smaller ones measure a total of about 170 km, which are often fed directly or indirectly from the aquifer of Milan.

It has a characteristic heart shape. It is the southernmost of the Pontine lakes. At the time of the Latins it was known as Literna Palus and the city of Liternum extended on the south bank. In ancient times, especially before the hydraulic works of the 17th century, it extended further north, with a large marshy area. In fact, the Clanis, which in ancient times flowed into Lake Patria, was artificially irregular and led to flow 9 km further north, to Pinetamare. Today it is fed by modest freshwater streams and some springs, but also by a canal, now cemented, which connects it to the sea and allows the entry of salt water. The surface is located about 4 m above sea level. View of the shore of Lake Patria Lake Patria can be considered a coastal lake due to its position close to the sea, the modest depth (on average 1.5 m) and the salinity of the waters.

She is credited with building the bridge over the Um ar-Rabii'a River. She also provided administrative counsel to her son Ahmad al-Mansur. She recommended, for example, that he seek help from the Ottoman sultan, Selim I. She supported impoverished communities in rural areas through economic assistance and support for small businesses. She also facilitated the marriage of young people to strengthen those communities. She helped these young people exercise the right to marriage and family life by helping them secure dowries, marriage costs, and other financial burdens preventing them from getting married.

He served in the War of American Independence, earning membership in the Society of the Cincinnati. He was also a member and director of the Acad√©mie de Marine.  Biography  Monteil joined the Navy as a Garde- Marine in 1741. He took part in the Battle of Cape Sici√© on 22 February 1744, and was promoted to Ensign in 1746. That year, he served on the 24-gun frigate Volage, on which he was in combat against the 70-gun HMS Stirling Castle on 15 April. Volage was captured, but Oriflamme retook her the day after. In 1747, he served on the frigate Flore on convoy duty. Flore fought and captured a British ship during the mission. In 1755, Monteil was given command of the 12-gun corvette An√©mone at Cayenne. He was promoted to Lieutenant the year after, and served as Major for the squadron under admiral d'Ach√©, on Zodiaque, taking part in the Battle of Cuddalore on 29 April 1758 and in the Battle of Negapatam on 3 August. Monteil was given command of the frigate Sylphide, and took part in the Battle of Pondicherry on 10 September 1759. On 30 mars 1759, he was made a Knight in the Order of Saint Louis for his conduct in the battle. In 1762, Monteil was promoted to Captain, and given command of the 64-gun √âveill√© in Newfoundland. On 13 April 1771, Monteil departed Port-Louis, commanding the ship Actionnaire bound for Isle de France (Mauritius). In 1774, Monteil captained Z√©phir. In 1776, he captained the 32-gun frigate Renomm√©e, part of the Escadre d'√©volution under Du Chaffault. On 20 April 1776, she touched a reef while departing Brest, and Monteil was unable to immediately refloat Renomm√©e. Du Chaffault defended Monteil, writing to the Navy Minister that \\"only those who command ships run the risk of losing them\\". In 1778, Monteil commanded the 74-gun Conqu√©rant, part of the Third division in the Blue squadron of the fleet under Orvilliers. He took part in the Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778, where he was wounded. Monteil was promoted to Chef d'Escadre in 1779. In 1780, he was given command of the squadron of the Caribbean, comprising five 74-gun ships, four 64-gun ships and 6 smaller units, with his flag on the 74-gun Palmier, although he remained largely idle. He took part in the Siege of Pensacola in May 1781. He then returned at Cap- Fran√ßais, arriving on 10 July. On 17 July 1781, transferred to command of the Blue squadron (rear) in De Grasse's fleet, with his flag on the 80-gun Languedoc. Before his squadron departed, an accidental fire destroyed the 74-gun Intr√©pide, which exploded. Monteil took part in the Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September 1781. On 25 November 1782, he became an Ordinary member of the Acad√©mie de Marine. Monteil was promoted to Lieutenant g√©n√©ral des arm√©es navales on 8 February 1783.

They are the ultimate epistemic authority or m≈´la pramƒÅ·πáa (or prathama pramƒÅ·πáa). Manusmriti states that ≈örutistu vedo vigneyah (Sanskrit: ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Å‡§§‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•Å ‡§µ‡•á‡§¶‡•ã ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡•á‡§Ø:, lit. means \\"Know that Vedas are ≈öruti\\").

Vedic Sages such as Baudhayana, ParƒÅ≈õara, VedavyƒÅsa, Gautama, Va≈õi·π£·π≠ha, ƒÄpastamba, Manu, and YƒÅj√±avalkya have adhered this view in their works. The main schools of Indian philosophy that reject the (espistemic authority of) Vedas were regarded as NƒÅstika, i.e. heterodox in the tradition. Smriti Smriti (, IAST: ') is considered as the penultimate epistemic authority or dvitƒ´ya pramƒÅ·πáa. Smriti literally means \\"that which is remembered\\" and it a body of Hindu texts usually attributed to an author, traditionally written down, in contrast to ≈örutis (the Vedic literature) considered authorless, that were transmitted verbally across the generations and fixed.Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1988), Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism, Manchester University Press, , pages 2-3 Smriti is a derivative secondary work and is considered less authoritative than Sruti in Hinduism, except in the Mimamsa school of Hindu philosophy.James Lochtefeld (2002), \\"Smrti\\", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N‚ÄìZ, Rosen Publishing, , page 656-657; Quote: \\"smriti is classified as being based on (and therefore less authoritative than) the directly revealed, shruti, literature.\\"; ; The authority of smriti accepted by orthodox schools, is derived from that of shruti, on which it is based. The Smrti literature is a corpus of diverse varied texts. This corpus includes, but is not limited to the six VedƒÅngas (the auxiliary sciences in the Vedas), the epics (the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata and RƒÅmƒÅyana), the Dharmas≈´tras and Dharma≈õƒÅstras (or Smriti≈õƒÅstras), the Arthasa≈õƒÅstras, the PurƒÅnas, the KƒÅvya or poetical literature, extensive Bhasyas (reviews and commentaries on Shrutis and non-Shruti texts), and numerous Nibandhas (digests) covering politics, ethics (Nitisastras),smRti Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany culture, arts and society.Purushottama Bilimoria (2011), The idea of Hindu law, Journal of Oriental Society of Australia, Vol. 43, pages 103-130Roy Perrett (1998), Hindu Ethics: A Philosophical Study, University of Hawaii Press, , pages 16-18 Each Smriti text exists in many versions, with many different readings. Smritis were considered fluid and freely rewritten by anyone in ancient and medieval Hindu tradition.Sheldon Pollock (2011), Boundaries, Dynamics and Construction of Traditions in South Asia (Editor: Federico Squarcini), Anthem, , pages 41-58 The authors of 18 smritis are namely, Atri, Vi·π£·πáu, HƒÅrƒ´ta, Au≈õanasƒ´, ƒÄngirasa, Yama, ƒÄpastamba, Samvartta, KƒÅtyƒÅyana, B·πõhaspati, ParƒÅ≈õara, VyƒÅsa, ≈öa·πÖkha, Likhita, Dak·π£a, Gautama, ≈öƒÅtƒÅtapa and Va≈õi·π£·π≠ha. YƒÅj√±avalkya gives the list of total 20 by adding two more Smritis, namely, YƒÅj√±avalkya and Manu. ParƒÅ≈õara whose name appears in this list, enumerates also twenty authors, but instead of Samvartta, B·πõhaspati, and VyƒÅsa, he gives the names of Ka≈õyapa, Bh·πõgu and Prachetas. =PurƒÅ·πáas= ƒÄpastamba and Vyasa considers the purƒÅ·πáas as antepenultimate epistemic authority or t·πõtƒ´ya pramƒÅ·πáa. In ƒÄpastambasm·πõti, it has been mentioned as VyƒÅsasm·πõti (verse 1.5) state that ƒÄcƒÅra ƒÄcƒÅra (), also si·π£·π≠ƒÅchƒÅra or sadƒÅchara, is a concept used in the context of Classical Hindu law that refers to the customary laws or community norms of a particular social group.Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter One. These community norms are delineated and put into practice by people who have earned the respect of those within each individual group, such as a community leader or elder. Although in Dharma≈õƒÅstra the ideal person who defines the ƒÅcƒÅra of a particular place is dictated as one who knows the Vedas or is ‚Äúlearned‚Äù, in actual practice this role is often deferred to group leaders along with Vedic scholars.Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter Seven ƒÄcƒÅra is theologically important in classical Hindu law because it is considered, along with the Vedas (≈öruti), and Smriti (traditional texts such as the Dharma≈õƒÅstra literature), to be one of the sources of dharma.Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter One Particular regional ƒÅcƒÅra is believed to be canonized in Dharma≈õƒÅstra texts; however scholars differ on the source for the actual accounts found within these texts.Lariviere, Richard W. 1997. pp. 612. The Anu≈õƒÅsana-parva of the Mahabharatastates: To ParƒÅ≈õara, Manu, YƒÅj√±avalkya, Va≈õi·π£·π≠ha and Baudhayana, the virtuous conduct of ≈öi·π£·π≠as (virtous learned men) and practice of good men, SadƒÅchara is the antepenultimate epistemic authority or t·πõtƒ´ya pramƒÅ·πáa after ≈örutis and Sm·πõtis. Va≈õi·π£·π≠hasm·πõti verse 1.4 quotes, tadalabhe ≈õi·π£·π≠ƒÅchƒÅrah pramƒÅ·πáam, i.e. only if the relevant references are absent in those both, then ≈öi·π£·π≠a ƒÄchƒÅra can be considered as Antepenultimate pramƒÅ·πáa. According to the sage Va≈õi·π£·π≠ha, ≈öruti and Sm·πõti are more important sources than others. The Padma Purana also prescribes as similar view. While citing ≈öi·π£·π≠ƒÅgama (lit. that which has come down from ≈öi·π£·π≠as) as the antepenultimate authority after Vedas and smirtis by Baudhayana in his smriti (verse 1.5), the ≈öi·π£·π≠as are defined thus:-Sistas (indeed are those) who are free from envy (vigatamatsarƒÅ·∏•), free from pride (nirahankƒÅrƒÅ·∏•), contented with a store of grain sufficient for ten days (kumbhƒ´dhƒÅnyƒÅ·∏•), free from covetousness (alolupƒÅ·∏•), and free from hypocrisy (damba), arrogance (darpa), greed (lobha), perplexity (confusion) and anger (krodha).https://www.astrojyoti.com/pdfs/DevanagariFiles/baudhayana_smriti.pdf Kumarila Bhatta, prominent Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ scholar from early medieval India states in his Tantravartika:  Atmatusti  Atmatusti is usually translated into English as being \\"what is pleasing to oneself.\\"Olivelle, Patrick. 2004. The Law Code of Manu. 2.6. The first three sources of law are rooted in the vedas, whereas atmatusti is not. It is because of this that atmatusti, as a fourth source (i.e. caturtha pramƒÅ·πáa), is not recognized by most scholars due to the lack of legitimacy. Only Manu and YƒÅj√±avalkya refer to atmatusti as the fourth source of dharma within the Hindu Law tradition. Textual accounts of Manu's and Yajnavalkya's placement of atmatusti as a fourth source of dharma can be found in The Law Code of Manu 2.6 and The Law Code of Yajnavalkya 1.7. Also, atmatusti does not share the same authority as sruti, smriti, and acara. Atmatusti differs significantly from the other three sources of dharma in that it is not based on an \\"authority exterior to man\\"; in other words, an individual is able to create their own authority for any issue not covered under sruti, smriti, and acara. ƒÄtmatu·π£·π≠i is also known as H·πõdayƒÅnuj√±a (free will) is mentioned also by Manu, YƒÅj√±avalkya and Vishnu distinctly mention this as a or source of moral and religion knowledge. YƒÅj√±avalkya goes further step adding good intent (samyaksa·πÉkalpa) as additional fifth source of Dharma: Later, samyaksa·πÉkalpa (Pali: sammƒÅ sa·πÖkappa) was included among the Noble Eightfold Path (ƒÅryƒÅ·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖgamƒÅrga) putforth by Gautama Buddha. Instances of conflict Conflict between different epistemic sources, generally termed as virodha. When there is an instance of conflict between the smriti and the ≈õruti, the ≈õruti shall prevail. Similarly, Whenever there is conflict between different epistemic sources in general, then as per ƒÄpastamba, it is advised to refer more preceding epistemic sources as they hold more authority. In ƒÄpastambasm·πõti, it is mentioned as Vedavyasa also holds a similar view in his vyƒÅsasm·πõti, verse 1.4 Prasthanatrayi The Prasthanatrayi (Sanskrit: ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§®‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ø‡•Ä, IAST: PrasthƒÅnatrayƒ´) are the three canonical texts of Hindu theology having epistemic authority, especially of the Vedanta schools, namely the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras, and the Bhagavad Gita. Prasthanatrayi can viewed as subset of Hindu epistemic sources. Vedanta is also known as Uttara Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ is one of the six (ƒÅstika) schools of Hindu philosophy. These six schools are traditionally referred as shad-dar≈õanas as they give their own points of view on the Hindu scriptures. VedƒÅnta school is based on Brahma S≈´tras (Sanskrit: ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞) of BƒÅdarƒÅyana. Adi Sankara who propagated Advaita has established the concept of Prasthanatrayi, the epistemic references based on ≈öƒÅstra pramƒÅ·πáam in Hinduism. Along with Brahma sutras, upanishads are considered from Vedas and Bhagavad gita is chosen from Mahabharata, which is Itihasa (i.e. part of smriti).Vepa, Kosla. The Dhaarmik Traditions. Indic Studies Foundation. The same has been accepted by all other acharyas of other vedanta schools such as Ramanuja, Madhwa, etc. Modern usage and criticism ≈öƒÅstra pramƒÅ·πáam has been used by social reformers for 19th century from Bengal such as Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. He was the most prominent campaigner for widow remarriage and was supported in this by many wise and elite gentlemen of the society and the first signatory on his application to the then Governor General was Shri Kasinath Dutta, belonging to the Hatkhola Dutta lineage. He petitioned in legislative council and was responsible for Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856. In the same century, Similar effort from south India was carried by social reformers such as Kandukuri Veeresalingam pantulu and Gurazada Apparao to eradicate social evils in Hinduism. Baba Saheb Ambedkar has criticized the rigidity of ≈õƒÅstra pramƒÅ·πáam in Hinduism in his work Annihilation of Caste by attacking especially on Manusmriti. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, 1936. Anhilation of Caste. p. 54 In order to prevent child marriages among Hindus, The Child Marriage Restraint Act was passed in 1929. ≈öƒÅstra pramƒÅ·πáam was considered by Hindu pandits appointed by the age of consent committee to fix the age of marriage of girl child and then it was fixed to be 14 later by Sarda Act.

Maritime Venice (, , ) or Byzantine Venice refers to a territory of the Byzantine Empire framed in the Exarchate of Italy and corresponding to the coastal belt of ancient Venetia, on the coast of present-day Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia.Ravegnani, Bisanzio e Venezia, p. 7. This is distinct from the hinterland of the Euganean Venice which passed from the end of the sixth century under the control of the Lombards. The territory was a vast peripheral area of the Byzantine domains in Italy, characterized by scattered settlements without major urban centers. The precarious geographical conditions favored new social and economic models, stemming from the traditional Roman lagoon activities such as fishing, glass processing, and salt extraction. Having escaped the Barbarian Invasions, the local population also developed commerce considerably. This occurred thanks to the protection guaranteed by the complex system of canals and islands, as well as the tax privileges enjoyed by the Byzantine provinces in Italy. The distance from Byzantium and political controversies due to the Tricapitolino schism initially caused the emergence of two competing factions, broadly aligned to the Lombards and the Byzantines, until the autonomy granted by Byzantine emperors was consolidated. The Ducatus Venetiae was formed between the end of the seventh century and the beginnings of the eighth.  Territory and settlements  The martyrium of Santa Fosca in Torcello: dating back to the twelfth century, the building exhibits marked Byzantine influences. Ancient columns belonging to the early Christian sanctuary of the Madonna di Barbana, in Grado, dating back to the sixth century. Venetia Maritima emerged as a result of the Lombard occupation of a large part of the current Veneto region and the progressive migration of Roman populations. These Romans came from the fall of Aquileia, leading to new coastal settlements, protected by the lagoons and the imperial fleet. The Romans who migrated from mainland Venetia to build new settlements in the islands of the Adriatic coast did not abandon their region, thinking one day they'd be able to return to regain their lost cities. A similar process took place in Istria and, a few decades later, in Dalmatia following the invasion of the Avars and part of the Veneto hinterland between the rivers Adige and Brenta.Atlante Storico Mondiale, Istituto Geografico De Agostini, Novara 1995. Giovanni Diacono, writing shortly after the year 1000, described the province:  Economy  Data on the economic situation of Venetia Maritima were collected thanks to a series of studies carried out on the archaeological excavations of Torcello in the mid-1950s. From the Roman age to the early Middle Ages the territory of the lagoon was used mainly, if not exclusively, for the production of salt or for other minor activities related to fishing and dredging of the coast.Cassiodoro, Variae, XII n. 24 Navigation was already important at the time of the reign of the Gothic Vitige, whose minister Cassiodorus thus addressed the Venetians:Romanin, Samuele : Storia documentata di Venezia, Libro I, Capitolo V. The Roman economic system held up until the beginning of Byzantine rule, and until then the unity of the province was maintained. At the time of Narsete, the various arts already met in guilds, called scholae, protected by a patron: this included the arts of blacksmiths, centonars, fulli, merchants, shopkeepers, stonemasons, potters, painters, etc. Venetic merchants steal the body of San Marco from Alexandria in Egypt: from the mosaics of the basilica of San Marco in Venice. The forced increase of the population due to the migrations from Veneto led to a radical change in the economic production of the area, which from the periphery became a real market. Since the Lombard invasion, a fairly substantial agricultural production was activated, including export products such as pine nuts, walnuts, hazelnuts, peaches and plums, as well as vines and cucumbers, in a local variety still present in Torcello. The growth of the population then led to a second transformation of the territory which, becoming a city area, saw the demand for artisanal products grow. This caused the development of the ceramic industry and finally the glass art (as early as 639 in the church of Torcello the first mosaics appeared with glass tesserae). Torcello was about to become a real commercial center, a ¬´ŒºŒ≠Œ≥Œ±ŒΩ ·ºêŒºœÄœåœÅŒπŒøŒΩ¬ª (megan emporion, \\"large market\\") already in the time of Costantino Porfirogenito. Only the building technique remained the same as the mainland, both in construction materials and in the most common artisan productions, which also felt the influence of the Lombard models.Leiciesjewicz L., Tabaczinska E., Tanacziski S., Torcello. Svavi 1961‚Äì1962, Istituto nazionale d'archeologia e storia dell'arte, Roma 1977, pp. 103, 195, 244, 288, 291‚Äì292. = The development of mercantilism = Venetian commercial activities had always naturally taken place between the Po-Veneto plain and the vast stretch of coast that reaches Ravenna from Trieste (in a broader sense also Istria). In fact, these areas were crossed by the Annia and Postumia streets and by the network of rivers and navigable canals guaranteed by the lagoon system. This merchant bond, despite various conflicts, continued uninterrupted until the eighth century. This ended when Adriano I confiscated the Venetian possessions in the territories of the archdiocese of Ravenna, after political conflicts in Italy, and banished the lagoon merchants of the Exarchate, the Venetian economy that until then had been controlled by the landowners and directed by their financial needs. The Exarchate was forced to radically renew its productive system, witnessing the intervention of new members of society or old agrarians who became shipowners, aimed mainly at maritime trade. The privileged political relations with the east also allowed the local population to gain monopoly areas, such as the trade of the so-called Tyrian purples, leather or Asian fabrics, as well as the slave market which was conducted for several centuries by the Venetians between the Slavic world and Islamic Africa. The military fleet was greatly encouraged, both by private individuals and by the local government, already from the early days of patrolling the whole Adriatic from Istria to Otranto, against piracy, reinforced by powerful ships built on the model of the Byzantine imperial dromon, called zalandriae.Giovanni diacono, Cronaca.Thietmari Merseburgensis, Chronicon, in Monumenta Germaniae historica.

The Twitter account @BTSMchat hosts monthly tweet chats for the #BTSM community (the Twitter equivalent of a cancer support group) and consistently trends among the top 15 of disease-related tweet chats. A study published in 2020 revealed the hashtag was most commonly used by brain tumor patients (33.13%), along with patient advocacy organizations (7.01%), care partners (4.63%), and clinicians (3.63%) and researchers (3.37%) specializing in brain tumors and brain cancers. The Brain Tumor Social Media hashtag‚Äî#BTSM‚Äîwas introduced to the medical community in \\"Disease-Specific Hashtags for Online Communication About Cancer Care\\" published in JAMA Oncology, and later covered as a case study in maintaining a successful online health-oriented community (published in JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics). Guidelines for neuro-oncology professionals interacting with patients on social media were introduced in the journal Neuro-Oncology. The #BTSM hashtag represents benign and malignant brain tumors. In a 2016 interview for CURE magazine, #BTSM organizer @TheLizArmy said, ‚ÄúThere are over 120 different brain tumors‚Ä¶ I liked the idea of an inclusive group for everyone with brain tumors where we can all share our experiences.‚Äù  Background  Brain Tumor Social Media (#BTSM) is a grassroots Twitter community founded by brain tumor patients who were inspired by a breast cancer community tweeting with the hashtag #BCSM (Breast Cancer Social Media). The #BTSM hashtag community is not owned or affiliated with any organization or nonprofit, and is organized by volunteers who are brain tumor patients, care partners, and neuro-oncology professionals. = History = In a 2012 post on her blog, Twitter user @TheLizArmy said she had the idea to start a brain tumor-specific hashtag after observing a Breast Cancer Social Media (#BCSM) tweet chat, writing, ‚ÄúA new hashtag has been established tonight #btsm, for Brain Tumor Social Media-- a spin-off of the popular #bcsm used by breast cancer peeps.\\" Brain tumor patient @cblotner_ tweeted at @TheLizArmy by using the hashtag #BTSM from his hospital room after awake craniotomy.

Typical #BTSM tweet chat participants are Twitter users who are interested in brain tumors, including people who have been diagnosed with a brain tumor (patients), care partners of brain tumor patients, medical professionals, researchers, advocates, and community healthcare organization members.  Research with #BTSM  Academic clinicians and researchers have partnered with #BTSM patients and care partners to better understand brain tumor stakeholder needs and publish these findings in academic and medical journals. = Twitter analytics = A study published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research analyzed the use of the #BTSM hashed from its inception in 2012 through 2018 and tracked its usage and adoption by various stakeholders (e.g., patients, care partners, clinicians, researchers, advocacy organizations). This study described the adoption of the #BTSM hashtag increasing by clinicians over time, but decreasing among care partners. = Quality of life, advance care planning, and palliative care = A paper published in the Journal of Palliative Medicine analyzed the transcript of a #BTSM chat in January 2018 to better understand brain tumor stakeholder perspectives on advance care planning; one of the key themes that emerged from the analysis was related to concerns about discussing advance care planning too early or too late in a brain tumor diagnosis.

W. Douglas, was a Canadian librarian, bibliophile, editor, literary agent, author, and public speaker who served as Vancouver, British Columbia's chief librarian from 1911 to 1924 and as the first president of the British Columbia Library Association. Under his direction, the Vancouver Public Library grew greatly in size, its circulation increased and a number of rare books were added to its collection as he worked to make the Vancouver Library one of the \\"finest libraries on the continent.\\" Early Life Douglas was born in 1854 in New Durham, Ontario, the son of Alex and Elizabeth Douglas. He developed a love for reading at a young age. After he had consumed the available reading material at his family‚Äôs home, he spent his spare time hunting muskrats for pelts which he sold to buy books. He received a high school education in nearby Brant, Ontario. Intending to matriculate at the University of Toronto, Douglas pursued further coursework under private tutors. In 1874, Douglas married Williamina Whyman, whose family had recently emigrated from Kent, England. Williamina died 2 years later, leaving Douglas with 2 young daughters to care for. In 1877, Douglas married Williamina‚Äôs half-sister, Eleanor Sara Follett. Together, they had 4 more daughters and 1 son. CareerBookseller= Instead of continuing his education at the University of Toronto as planned, Douglas took a position with a bookseller in Toronto, Ontario. Alfred Piddington, owner of one of the largest book establishments in Toronto, hired Douglas to manage his bookstore. In 1883, Piddington sold his business to Douglas, who created the company R. W. Douglas and Co. Douglas became a noted bookseller in Toronto. Specializing in ‚Äúrare and curious books, stationery, fancy goods, and toys,‚Äù his inventory included approximately 75,000 books including works in \\"every department of literature.\\" His bibliography of Canadian books, Bibliotheca Canadensis, which was circulated in the United States, was used by dealers in old and rare books. Around 1889, Douglas sold his business to Risser & Company. Following an extended trip to England, Douglas moved to New York City to join Brentano‚Äôs bookshop. As a Brentano‚Äôs representative, he travelled extensively and visited hundreds of libraries in the United States and Canada. =Author= While in Toronto, Douglas began contributing stories to magazines and papers, such as The Canadian Monthly. He was awarded a prize for the best short story submission to Truth magazine. In 1921, Douglas wrote to author L. M. Montgomery, commending her for ‚Äúvisualizing the soul of the Canadian people in the war‚Äù and for accurately portraying the ‚Äústorm and stress of home life during those anxious days‚Äù in her recent book, Rilla of Ingleside. Montgomery noted in her journal that Douglas‚Äô comments pleased her and were the ‚Äúfirst competent testimony‚Äù that she had been successful in capturing the essence of that time period in her book. A member of the British Columbia section of the Canadian Authors Association, Douglas served as Vice-Chairman. Investigations and Studies in Jade =Editor= Douglas became a literary adviser to the New Amsterdam Book Company, a large New York publishing house. He was appointed editor of their series of books published under the name Commonwealth Library and he contributed an introduction to each volume. The Commonwealth Library books were offered at a low price and were designed to be carried \\"in the pocket.\\" In 1901, Douglas' Love Songs of Scotland was published. Designed as a companion volume to Albert Lamartine's Love Songs from France, it contained works selected and edited by Douglas from Burns, Tannahil, Scott, Ramsay and others. After the death of Heber R. Bishop in 1902, Douglas assisted in editing Bishop‚Äôs partially completed Investigations and Studies in Jade, a two-volume set which documented Bishop‚Äôs extensive jade collection that had been donated to New York‚Äôs Metropolitan Museum of Art. Douglas spent 3 years completing the work. Of the 100 copies printed, Douglas helped secure 3 copies for Canadian institutions: the Toronto Public Library, the University of Toronto, and McGill University in Montreal. = Literary Agent= Douglas later became an agent for E.P. Dutton & Company and Little, Brown & Company, American publishing firms. =Librarian= In 1911, Douglas accepted the position of City Librarian at the Vancouver Public Library (then Carnegie Library) in Vancouver, British Columbia. Shortly after his arrival, he established a children's reading room and initiated Saturday readings in the park for children. Four branch libraries were opened in June 1912. By 1914, an additional five branches had been opened. With the approval of the library‚Äôs board, Douglas returned to the East Coast in 1913 to purchase several thousand rare, ‚Äúunusual,‚Äù and valuable books as well as artwork for the library. Douglas also donated 250 books from his personal collection. Under his direction, the library grew in size and its circulation continued to increase. Toward the end of his career, Douglas faced criticism from the board for his management of the library. Douglas contended that American libraries received more funds per capita than were allocated by the board to the Vancouver Public Library. Douglas submitted his letter of resignation in 1924. Public Speaker As chief librarian, Douglas was a frequent lecturer on literary topics. In 1911, Douglas addressed the convention of the Pacific Northwest Library Association on the topic of \\"Book Selection for Public Libraries.\\" In 1913, Douglas delivered an address, which was subsequently published, to benefit St. Paul's Hospital, entitled \\"How Books May Help You.\\" To foster the love of good literature within the Vancouver community and to help provide a means to enjoy it, Douglas offered free weekly lectures at the library on a wide range of poets and writers. British Columbia Library Association In September 1911, the British Columbia Library Association was founded by Douglas and several of his colleagues. The association's purpose was to advocate for the passage of public library legislation and the extension of library services throughout the province. Douglas served as its first president. The British Columbia Library Association was the driving force behind the passage of British Columbia's 1919 Act for the Establishment and Maintenance of Public Libraries. Death Douglas died in Los Angeles, California on 9 Jan 1931 and is buried with his wife, Eleanor, at San Gabriel Cemetery, in San Gabriel, California.

The spiritualism influenced art, having a pervasive influence on artistic consciousness, with spiritual art having a huge impact on what became modernism and therefore art today. Famous spiritual artists include Georgiana Houghton and Piet Mondrian. The spiritualism also inspired the pioneering abstract art of Vasily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, Kasimir Malevich and Frantisek Kupka.

Maffei, a spiritualist, claimed that he received messages on how to build Rosazza from the spirits, including Saint Augustine.

He mainly wrote poetry in Sranan Tongo, and is considered one of the most important poets in Sranan Tongo.. He also published in Dutch, and Spanish Biography In 1947, Slory moved to Paramaribo from his birth place Totness, and went to the Algemene Middelbare School which is comparable to high school, but does not qualify for university. His teacher encouraged him to write not only to in Dutch, but also Sranan Tongo and Spanish. While in high school, he published his first three Dutch poems in the magazine Tongoni. In 1958, Slory moved to Amsterdam to study a course in Spanish at a private school. After graduating, he enrolled in the University of Amsterdam where he joined Vereniging Ons Suriname. His poetry can be found in the yearbooks of the time. Ons Suriname was during that period, the centre for the Surinamese nationalist movement. Slory also gained access to the Dutch literary world, and befriended authors like Harry Mulisch and Hugo Claus. In 1961, he published his first work Sarka / Bittere strijd under the pseudonym Asjantenoe Sangodare, with the communist publisher Pegasus. Sarka / Bittere strijd was bilingual with the poems printed both in Dutch and Sranan Tongo, and expressed his sympathy for Fidel Castro. The work is dedicated to Patrice Lumumba, and introduced by Theun de Vries. His scholarship was revoked in 1966, and Slory decided to focus on writing. He published Brieven aan de Guerrilla (1968), and Brieven aan Ho Tsji Minh (1968). In 1970, Slory returned to Suriname and only wanted to write in Sranan Tongo. Slory started with Fraga mi wortoe (1970), and 20 more publications followed. His style started to change as well. The major themes are no longer nationalism and social equality, but love started to become a major theme in his poetry. Slory started to become disenchanted with the events after the independence of Suriname. In 1982, Slory had another change of mind, and started to write in Dutch and Spanish. He released Poemas contra la agon√≠a (1988), Een andere weg (1991) among others. During his lifetime, he published more than 30 works, and several thousand poems. In 1985, Slory was awarded the Suriname State Price for Literature for his love poem Fresko en Efu na Kodyo. In 1993, his poem Sarka was set to music by Gerda Geertens. In 1995, NPS created a television program about Micha√´l Slory En nu de droom over is.. de Surinaamse dichter Michael Slory. Even though Slory was lauded by literary critics, he always remained well below the poverty line,, and often sold his books in the street.

Design and development thumb The Mac Airliner was designed as a fast carrier of mail and passengers, its cost lowered by the use of the old but readily available Liberty L-12 engine, produced in large numbers late in World War I. It was a shoulder wing, strut braced monoplane based on steel tube structures. Its wings used a M-6 airfoil combining high lift and low drag. They were braced from the lower fuselage by pairs of parallel struts to the wing-spars at about 60% span, encased in airfoil section fairings and adding to the wings' lift. Its ailerons were beyond the bracing struts. The Mac's upright Liberty engine was nose-mounted with its radiator below it. From nose to tail the fuselage was flat-sided apart from rounded decking. The pilot's enclosed cabin was at the leading edge with windowed access doors below. Separate rectangular windows under the wing lit the passengers' cabin. The fuselage tapered to the rear, where the tailplane was mounted on top and braced to a cropped triangular fin that carried a rounded balanced rudder. The Mac had conventional, fixed landing gear, with separate, cranked axles from the lower fuselage providing a track of . Its oleo strut legs were mounted on the forward wing struts at points strengthened by struts to the upper fuselage. Its tail wheel was hydraulically damped. The date of the Mac's first flight is not known but by mid-April 1929 it was being prepared for a flight to an airshow in Chicago.

However, it is also possible for placebo analgesia to be mediated by non-opioid mechanisms, in which case it would not be affected by naloxone.

Last mission On 17 December 1915, captained by Dr. Lempertz, LZ 39 was hit by shrapnel during an attack on Rovno. All rear gas cells were punctured and the front engine car was hit and later fell off. The crew abandoned the now- overstressed control cabin, dropped ballast and shifted loads to rebalance the ship and used an emergency control station in the rear to limp back to Germany.

Radiometric dating constrains its age to between 5 and 2 million years, corresponding to the Pliocene epoch. Description The Puye Formation is a fanglomerate containing 25 pyroclastic flows, including pumicious ignimbrites and block-and-ash flows, erupted by vents of the Tschicoma Formation.Turbeville et al. 1989 It is exposed from the mouth of Ancho Canyon in White Rock Canyon north to Santa Clara Peak, and generally underlies the Bandelier Tuff north and east of the city of Los Alamos, covering an area of 518 square kilometers. It is best exposed in Guaje Canyon and on the southern end of the Puye Escarpment where it is a cliff-forming formation. It is 71 meters thick at the type section but thickens westward towards the Sierra de los Valles, west of Los Alamos. Drilling has found that the formation is up to 221 meters thick. The formation was deposited between 7 and 4 million years ago, based on radiometric dating of an ash bed in the upper part of the formation and the absence of Bearhead Rhyolite ash in the formation.Heiken et al. 1990, p.32 The Totavi Lentil is the lowest part of the formation, some 24 meters thick, which consists of pebbles, cobbles, and small boulders of quartzite and granite with only limited volcanic debris, contrasting with the remainder of the formation. This is separated by a significant unconformity from the underlying Chamita Formation.Kelley et al. 2013 The main body of the Puye Formation consists of fanglomerates in which most of the detritus is volcanic rock of dacitic composition. There are also dacitic tephra beds and some basalt. The formation shows cyclicity on the scale of 5 to 30 meters representing individual eruptive pulses in the northeastern Jemez highlands. Each sequence shows marked facies changes with increased distance from the eruptive center. Deposition ceased with reduction in Tschicoma volcanism and basinwide pedimentation due to downcutting of the Rio Grande.

Griggs assigned the formation to the Santa Fe Group.Griggs 1964, pp.28-37 Because of its diverse lithology, the formation was renamed the Puye Formation by Bailey, Smith, and Ross in 1969 as part of their work establishing the stratigraphy of the Jemez Mountains.Smith et al. 1969, p.12  Footnotes  References  * Griggs, R.

In a review on The Rumpus, torrin a. greathouse said of the specimen's apology: \\"The works contained within the specimen‚Äôs apology are a lush and sprawling series of overlapping parallel universes in which Abraham is constantly innovating and abandoning forms.

This creates within the chapbook a shifting, fractious landscape where its author‚Äôs interdisciplinary work as a PhD in bioengineering shines through...While, in the hands of a different poet, this could all prove extremely daunting to the reader, Abraham wields these high concepts with incredible grace and trust in their audience.\\" The Michigan Quarterly Review said, \\"In some ways, to be Palestinian is to inhabit this bracketed body deemed imaginary and to queer it through language, imagination, and memory.

Sa‚Äôed Atshan, author of Queer Palestine and the Empire of Critique, said: \\"Birthright captures how politics penetrates our psyche and consciousness, but as the poems triumph through anguish, we are able to hold onto life. The journey of reading these words is also a universal one, bringing together conceptions of faith, love, family, settler-colonialism, violence, queerness, and the search for home.\\"  Science  Abraham is a Bioengineering PhD candidate at Harvard University in the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He's said, \\"Both poetry and science, at their essence, try to give a language to that which we don‚Äôt understand.

It is the second largest theater in South America, after the Teatro Col√≥n of Buenos Aires, Argentina.left  Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's Birthplace Home  Skyscrapers may loom overhead, but there is more than a hint of original colonial flavor in this neatly proportioned reconstruction of the house where Sim√≥n Bol√≠var was born on 24 July 1783. The museum's exhibits include period weapons, banners and uniforms. Much of the original colonial interior has been replaced by monumental paintings of battle scenes, but more personal relics can be seen in the nearby Bolivarian museum. The pride of the place goes to the coffin in which Bol√≠var's remains were brought from Colombia; his ashes now rest in the National Pantheon. National Pantheon Venezuela's most venerated building is five blocks north of Plaza Bol√≠var, on the northern edge of the old town. Formerly a church, the building was given its new purpose as the final resting place for eminent Venezuelans by Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco in 1874. Parque Central Complex At a short distance east of Plaza Bol√≠var is Parque Central, a concrete complex of five high-rise residential slabs of somewhat apocalyptic-appearing architecture, crowned by two 56-storey octagonal towers, one of them is under repair due to the fire which burnt the building on 17 October 2004. Parque Central is Caracas' art and culture hub, with museums, cinemas and the Teresa Carre√±o Cultural Complex. The West Tower balcony, on the 52nd floor, gives a 360¬∞ bird's-eye view of Caracas. Public squares *Plaza Bol√≠var is the focus of the old town with the monument to El Libertador, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, at its heart. Modern high-rise buildings have overpowered much of the colonial flavor of Caracas' founding neighbourhood. *Plaza Venezuela is the geographic center of Caracas. It is a large urban plaza at the entrance of the Central University of Venezuela. Kinetic artists have displayed their works there, including Carlos Cruz-Diez, Alejandro Otero and Jesus Soto.

Cerro El √Åvila Cerro El √Åvila (El √Åvila mountain) (Indigenous name: Waraira Repano), is a mountain bordering Caracas. It rises next to Caracas, separating the city from the Caribbean Sea. The area's highest elevation is Pico Naiguat√°, at above sea level. It is considered the lungs of Caracas due to the amount of vegetation on the mountain.

Religious buildings  La Pastora, ca. 1845 by Ferdinand Bellermann. Berlin State Museums. The Iglesia de San Francisco is of historical value. Bol√≠var's funeral was held here twelve years after his death. Here he was proclaimed Libertador in 1813 by the people of Caracas. The church has gilded baroque altarpieces, and retains much of its original colonial interior, despite being given a treatment in the 19th century under the auspices of Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco, which was intended to be modernizing. It contains some 17th-century masterpieces of art, carvings, sculptures and oil paintings.

The pyramidal green roof denotes the mausoleum. The Zawiya of Sidi Abd el-Aziz (alternate spellings include Zaouia of Sidi Abdelaziz) is an Islamic religious complex (zawiya) in Marrakesh, Morocco. It is centered around the tomb of the Muslim scholar and Sufi saint Sidi Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz Abd al- Haq at-Tabba', who died in Marrakesh in 1508. Sidi Abd el-Aziz is considered one of the Seven Saints of Marrakesh, and his tomb was a prominent stop for pilgrims to Marrakesh. The zawiya is located on Rue Mouassine (Mouassine Street) at its intersection with Rue Amesfah.  Historical background  Sidi Abd al-Aziz at-Tabbaa' was the most important disciple of the Sufi master al- Jazuli, who died in 1465 and whose mausoleum is also found in Marrakesh (after his body was moved there by the Saadians in 1523-24). At-Tabba', a native of Marrakesh, gained his reputation while teaching at the al-'Attarine Madrasa in Fes and came to be seen as al-Jazuli's spiritual successor. Along with al- Jazuli and five others, he also came to be considered one of the Seven Saints of Marrakesh (a religious institution officially established by Sultan Moulay Ismai'l), and was considered the patron saint of the city's tanners in particular. Among these Seven Saints was also Sidi Abdallah al-Ghaswani who himself was a disciple and successor of Sidi Abdelaziz and was later buried in another zawiya further south. The zawiya complex presents a mix of Saadian and later Alaouite architecture. The mausoleum first took shape under the Saadians in the early 16th-century. However, according to Gaston Deverdun (French scholar whose work on Marrakesh is heavily cited), the current building dates largely from the time of Moulay Muhammad ibn Abdallah (governor of Marrakesh after 1746 and sultan from 1757-1790), who is responsible for building and restoring many monuments in the city.

Her research resulted in the development and deployment of a systematic screening programme.  Research and career  In 2004 Adab was appointed a lecturer at the University of Birmingham, where she was promoted to professor in 2013. Her early research considered the impact cervical cancer screening and passive smoking on public health. Smoking and passive smoking are the leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In 2007 she estimated that 2 million people living in China at the time will die from passive smoking. Adab has investigated the epidemiology of COPD in the United Kingdom. She has studied the impact of diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in primary care. Whilst COPD is common, it is frequently undiagnosed, and Adab has argued that both clinicians and patients need access to more information. The World Health Organization have recognised that obesity is one of the most serious but preventable public health challenges. Adab has worked on obesity prevention programmes since the early 2000s. She has said that childhood obesity is particularly difficult to manage as parents often do not ‚Äúthink children can be overweight,‚Äù. In 2016 Adab investigated the diets of primary school students, and found that they were consuming four times the daily recommended sugar levels; and that 40% of their sugar intake came from sugary drinks. Adab studied the effectiveness of public health interventions to prevent childhood obesity in China, where the prevalence of childhood obesity has increased rapidly, from 1% for boys and girls in 1985 to 28.2% for boys and 16.4% for girls in 2015. She used Medical Research Council guidelines to conduct the Chinese Primary School Children Physical Activity and Dietary Behaviour Changes Intervention (CHIRPY DRAGON) study, which found that the body mass index was lower and the proportion of children who consumed 5 A Day was significantly greater in the cohorts who underwent an evidence-based prevention programme. The year-long, multi-component CHIRPY DRAGON intervention made use of behavioural-change approaches and family engagement, with a focus on improving grandparents' knowledge of childcare. Adab showed that Chinese children who get less sleep are more likely to have high body mass indexes. In 2020 Adab was one of a team of researchers who studied the impact of The Daily Mile, a physical education intervention for school children, on childhood obesity. The Daily Mile encourages school students to do 15 minutes of exercise during the school day, and despite there being no evidence of its benefits, has been adopted by 10,500 schools and nurseries around the United Kingdom. The body mass index of participating students was measured at the start, after 4 and then again after 12 months. She found that The Daily Mile had a small positive impact on the body mass index of children who took part, and was particularly cost-effective for girls. Adab analysed the demographics of people infected by SARS-CoV-2, looking to better understand who becomes most ill with coronavirus disease. She combined two large studies; one looking at the first people in the United Kingdom who tested positive, and another of seventeen million patients in UK primary care. Both studies found that women, white people and normal-weight people were less likely to become infected by coronavirus disease. Adab called for more exploration into how coronavirus disease exacerbated socioeconomic inequalities in the United Kingdom.

Family origins The Poet's great-great-great grandfather and namesake, Duncan Livingstone, fought under the command of Allan Maclean of Torloisk at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. With Duncan also fought his brothers, brother- in-law, and his father, who was killed there. According to the local oral tradition, Duncan Livingstone eloped with Anne MacLean, whose father Hector was the disinherited eldest son of Donald, 10th Chief of Clan MacLean of Coll and whose mother was Isobel, the only daughter of Ruairi Mear, 17th Chief of Clan MacLeod of Dunvegan. After the elopement, Duncan and Anne were granted the mill at Ensay by MacLean of Torloisk. Duncan is said also to have composed the song Mo R√πn Geal D√¨leas in honor of his wife.Ronald Black (1999), An Tuil: Anthology of 20th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse, p. 726. The poet's grandfather, Alexander Livingstone, was further said to have been the uncle of the African explorer and missionary David Livingstone.Ronald Black (1999), An Tuil: Anthology of 20th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse, p. 726. Life Duncan Livingstone was born in his grandfather's Croft at Reudle, near Torloisk on the Isle of Mull. His father, Donald Livingstone (D√≤mhnall Mac Alasdair 'ic Iain 'ic Dh√≤mhnall 'ic Dhonnchaidh) (1843‚Äì1924) was a joiner and stone-mason. The Poet's mother was Jane MacIntyre (Sine nighean Donnchaidh mhic Iain) (1845-1938), a native of Ballachulish who was said to be the grandniece of the Gaelic poet Duncan Ban MacIntyre (1724-1812). The Bard was the third of seven children and the outlines of the house where he was born may still be seen today.Ronald Black (1999), An Tuil: Anthology of 20th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse, p. 726. Duncan's parents had married in Glasgow in 1872. His mother had worked as a domestic servant. His father had lived in Canada and worked in the construction of timber houses. When Duncan was 18-months old, his family moved to Tobermory, where he was educated. He later recalled, however, \\"The scholars of my day were thrashed if they spoke Gaelic in the school or it's environs.\\"Ronald Black (1999), An Tuil: Anthology of 20th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse, pp. 726‚Äì727. When Livingstone was 16, his family moved to 126 Talisman Road in Glasgow. Duncan first became a clerk and then a stonemason's apprentice. When the Second Boer War broke out, he learned that the Laird of Torloisk was raising a cavalry regiment and immediately enlisted.Ronald Black (1999), An Tuil: Anthology of 20th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse, p. 727. During combat against the Boer Commandos, Duncan Livingstone was shot through the ankle and returned, lamed, to Glasgow. At this time, he carved the inscription Tigh Mo Chridhe, Tigh Mo Gr√†idh (\\"House of My Heart, House of My Love\\") on the lintel of the main door of Saint Columba Church of Scotland on St. Vincent Street in Glasgow.Ronald Black (1999), An Tuil: Anthology of 20th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse, p. 727. On 3 March 1903, the poet left Southampton on the S.S. Staffordshire on a voyage back to South Africa. He never returned to Scotland and was soon joined in South Africa by his brothers John and Alex. The three brothers briefly owned a house building company in Johannesburg, but disbanded their partnership and the poet joined the Public Works Department. His brother John went on to prosper through gold mining, while Alex became a sugar cane farmer in Natal. Ronald Black (1999), An Tuil: Anthology of 20th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse, page 727.Ronald Black (1999), An Tuil: Anthology of 20th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse, p. 727. In 1911, Catriona (Katie) MacDonald of Pennyghael in Mull, came to South Africa and became the Poet's wife. They were never to have children, however.Ronald Black (1999), An Tuil: Anthology of 20th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse, p. 727. There was a lively community of Scottish Gaels in Pretoria when the poet first settled there and he, his wife, and both of his brothers were very active in both Scottish and Gaelic circles. Duncan and Alex Lingstone edited a Gaelic page in the Caledonian Society's journal. Duncan also founded the Celtic Society of Pretoria, which was a literary association consisting of forty members with Scottish, Irish, and Welsh origins. Also Duncan established a Celtic section in the State Library, Pretoria, which consisted by 1954 of almost a thousand books.Ronald Black (1999), An Tuil: Anthology of 20th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse, p. 727. According to literary historian Ronald Black, Duncan Livingstone's poetry was doubtlessly assisted by the Gaelic broadcasts which he began making from South Africa for the BBC during the early 1930s. His first poem to be published was A f√†gail Aifric in 1939. He published three other poems in Gaelic about the war and also wrote a lament, in imitation of S√¨leas na Ceapaich's Lament for Alasdair of Glengarry, for his nephew Pilot Officer Alasdair Ferguson Bruce of the RAF, who was shot down and killed during a mission over Germany in 1941.Ronald Black (1999), An Tuil: Anthology of 20th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse, p. 727. Catriona died in September 1951 and Duncan, who adored her, never recovered from the blow. He spent his retirement both writing and playing bowls.Ronald Black (1999), An Tuil: Anthology of 20th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse, p. 727. Livingstone contemptuously mocked the collapse of the British Empire after World War II with the satirical Gaelic poem, Feasgar an Duine Ghil (\\"The Evening of the White Man\\").Ronald Black (1999), An Tuil: Anthology of 20th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse, pp. 72‚Äì75. The rise of the National Party and its policy of Apartheid troubled Livingstone deeply. The Poet's nephew, Prof. Ian Livingstone, recalls, \\"I visited Duncan (from Uganda) at his hotel (the Union Hotel, Pretoria) in 1959. He was resident there. Later, when I was back in Uganda, he sent me a long poem, in English (10 pages) on Sharpeville, where some 77 Africans had been shot dead by police (mostly in the back). This had obviously affected him greatly. Unfortunately, I don't have the copy anymore.\\"Ronald Black (1999), An Tuil: Anthology of 20th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse, pp. 728‚Äì729. The Sharpeville massacre also inspired Livingstone to write the Gaelic poem Bean Dubha' Caoidh a Fir a Chaidh a Marbhadh leis a' Phoiles (\\"A Black Woman Mourns her Husband Killed by the Police\\").Ronald Black (1999), An Tuil: Anthology of 20th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse, pp. 74‚Äì79, 728. He died in Pretoria on 25 May 1964 and lies buried in Rosetta Street Cemetery.Ronald Black (1999), An Tuil: Anthology of 20th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse, p. 727. Legacy In a paper about The Gaelic Literature of Argyll, Donald E. Meek describes Livingstone as a, \\"very fine modern Gaelic poet\\", who, \\"wrote some splendidly prophetic verse on the twentieth-century challenges which were to confront white rule in South Africa. He thus has a claim to be included in any forthcoming survey of the Gaelic literature of Africa!\\" The Gaelic Literature of Argyll by Donald E. Meek. In an essay, Scottish professor Wilson MacLeod described Duncan Livingstone as a \\"poet of significance\\", and one who became a perspective critic of the British Empire, which was best illustrated by his indifferent attitude towards its collapse in Feasgar an Duine Ghil. Macleod notes, however, that such an attitude was rare among Gaelic poets, the vast majority of whom were supportive of continued existence of the empire, including poets such as Aonghas Moireasdan and D√≤mhnall MacAoidh. According to him, the ideas espoused by Livingstone went into decline after the Battle of Culloden and the defeat of the Rising of '45.

Physical Description The measurement scale spans 82 inches and is subdivided to tenths of inches. It is marked on a silver inlay in a brass bar; the bar itself is about 86 inches long. History The scale was prepared for the Office of Coast Survey by Troughton of London and was brought to the United States in 1815 by F. R. Hassler, who a year later became first Superintendent of the Survey of the Coast and, in 1832, first Superintendent of Weights and Measures. At the time, the United States Government was principally financed by duties on imports and exports (the federal income tax did not become a permanent feature of the US system until 1913). The appropriate import and export taxes on commercial items were determined at customhouses maintained by the federal government at various ports of entry. A reliable and uniform system of weights and measure was necessary for this system to work, as well as for settling commercial disputes. In 1830, the US Senate requested the Secretary of the Treasury to ‚Äòcause a comparison to be made of the standards of weight and measure now used at the principal custom houses in the United States, and report to the Senate at the next session of Congress.‚Äô To carry out this mandate, the Treasury Secretary appointed Hassler, who found that (as was suspected) large discrepancies existed among the weights and measures in use at the principal customhouses at different US ports. The Treasury Department immediately started constructing new necessary weights and measures for the customs service. For this purpose, the Treasury Department had to choose standards, and the standard yard adopted was the 36 inches comprised between the 27th and the 63rd inches of the Troughton scale. This 36-inch space was supposed to be identical with the English standard at , though it had never been directly compared with that standard. The original English standard, in turn, was made in 1758, but was then damaged beyond the point of usability in a great fire of 1834. In 1856, the US received two copies of the new British standard yard after Britain completed the manufacture of new imperial standards to replace those lost in 1834. As standards of length, the new yards, especially bronze No. 11, were far superior to the Troughton scale. They were therefore accepted by the Office of Weights and Measures (a predecessor of NIST) as length standards of the United States. Later developments The new standards were twice taken to England and recompared with the imperial yard, in 1876 and in 1888. Measurable discrepancies were found ‚Äòwhich could not reasonably be said to be entirely due to changes in No. 11. Suspicion as to the constancy of the length of the British standard was therefore aroused.' In 1890, as a signatory of the Metre Convention, the US received two copies of the International Prototype Metre, the construction of which represented the most advanced ideas of standards of the time. Therefore it seemed that US measures would have greater stability and higher accuracy by accepting the international meter as fundamental standard, with the yard defined in terms of the meter. This was formalized in 1893 by the with the conversion in accordance with the Metric Act of 1866 (as 1 meter = 39.37 inches, which corresponds to 1 inch = 2.5400051‚Ä¶ centimeters). This value was adjusted in 1959 to its present value of 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters (or, 1 yard = meters), exactly.

It is centered around the tomb of the 15th-century Muslim scholar and Sufi saint Muhammad al- Jazuli (also known as Imam al-Jazuli, full name: Ab≈´ 'Abdullah Mu·∏•ammad ibn SulaymƒÅn ibn Ab≈´ Bakr al-Jaz≈´li al-SimlƒÅlƒ´), who is one of the Seven Saints of Marrakesh.  Historical background  Al-Jazuli was a major figure in the history of Moroccan Sufism. He lived at a time when local Sufi movements were also filling a void of political leadership against the encroachment of Portuguese and Spanish forces into the country. Originating from the Sous region in southern Morocco, he spent much time in Fes where he wrote his most famous work, the Dala'il al-Khayrat, and gained enormous influence over zawiyas and followers across the country. He subsequently moved around the coast of Morocco until he died near Essaouira in 1465 and was buried in the village of Afoughal. Later on, the early Saadians, who were also from the Sous region, associated themselves with al-Jazuli's followers as they established their own political power in southern Morocco. Thus, when Ahmad al-'Araj (the effective founder of the Saadian dynasty) moved to Marrakesh in 1521 he quickly arranged for the transfer of al-Jazuli's body here in 1523-24 along with that of his own father (who had been buried near al-Jazuli in 1517). The Saadians built a religious complex and mosque around the new mausoleum. After the reign of Muhammad al-Sheikh (Ahmad's brother, who had managed to dethrone him), the dynasty distanced itself from al-Jazuli's disciples. Nonetheless, al-Jazuli came to be considered one of the Seven Saints of Marrakesh and his tomb was a prominent stop for pilgrims to the city. While the mosque of the complex may still date from the Saadian period, the rest of the zawiya was frequently modified and restored over the years, particularly in the 18th century. The Alaouite sultan Moulay Isma'il was responsible for building the current mausoleum chamber with its large pyramidal cupola as well as for expanding the attached mosque and converting it to a Friday mosque. The zawiya was significantly restored or modified under Moulay Muhammad ibn Abdallah (who was made governor of Marrakesh in 1746 and ruled as sultan from 1757-1790) and was repaired in 1867-68 under Moulay Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman.  Architecture and layout  One of the main entrances (left) of the zawiya and, next to it (right), the zawiya's street fountain. The decoration includes carved stucco, a carved wooden canopy, and zellij tilework. = The mosque and mausoleum complex = The zawiya is a complex of structures and facilities which provide for a number of services and functions. Their architecture is similar to that of other Saadian religious complexes in the late 16th century such as the Mouassine Mosque and Bab Doukkala Mosque. The center of the complex is occupied by a mosque with a rectangular floor plan consisting of a nearly square courtyard (sahn) and an interior prayer hall divided into five naves by rows of arches. The interior of the mosque is not heavily decorated. North of the sahn is another courtyard which leads to the mausoleum chamber of al-Jazuli: a large square chamber higher than the surrounding structures and covered by a wood-frame cupola and, from the exterior, a pyramidal roof with green tiles, visible from the street and typical of Moroccan royal and religious structures. Immediately on the east side of the mausoleum are two of the zawiya's main entrances, alongside a decorated street fountain. Behind these is a small chamber which served as a madrasa or school. The rest of the complex, on its eastern side, is occupied by the house of the muqaddam, a hospice for pilgrims, and a large midha (ablutions house) with a central water basin and 14 latrines. = The cemetery and the Saadian mausoleum = The establishment of the zawiya also led to the development of a small cemetery along its western flank (separate from al-Jazuli's actual mausoleum chamber) which also served as the very first burial site of the Saadian dynasty in Marrakesh (before the later Saadian Tombs in the Kasbah). Soon after Muhammad al-Sheikh was assassinated by the Ottomans in 1557, Ahmad al-'Araj (his brother) was put to death, along with all his possible male heirs, allowing Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib to accede to power unchallenged. After a time, Ahmad and his sons were buried near al-Jazuli's mausoleum on the initiative of the local scholar Abu 'Amru al-Qastali al-Murrakshi. According to his tombstone's inscription, his daughter 'Aysha was responsible for erecting the domed mausoleum, known as the Qubba al-Ashraf, over his tomb. His tombstone, carved in black marble, disappeared sometime after 1946. Another tombstone within the mausoleum is believed to be for Ahmad's father, Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Rahman (also known as al-Qa'im bi-'Amrillah), though this is not confirmed by any inscription. The mausoleum structure is a simple chamber made in brick with a dome on an octagonal base. Inside, the upper walls of the chamber are decorated with arabesque and epigraphic motifs carved in plaster.

The first depression and first named storm of the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Arthur marked the record sixth consecutive year in the Atlantic basin with an early start before June. It was one of two off-season storms in the season, alongside short-lived Tropical Storm Bertha. Originating from a broad trough that formed on May 14 near Cuba, the early system slowly drifted south of Florida through the Florida Strait for two days, before becoming a depression on May 16 north of The Bahamas, starting the Atlantic season. A day later, the system would be named Arthur and slowly drift north towards the Outer Banks of North Carolina, before skirting the same area and weakening as it moved towards Bermuda. In its formative stages, Arthur delivered heavy rainfall to the Florida Keys and South Florida, and also caused rough surf off the majority off the east coast of Florida. The system's outer bands would also begin to cause significant rainfall and gusty winds off the Outer Banks of North Carolina, as well as rip currents along the majority of the Southeastern Coast.  Meteorological history  On May 12, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first discussed the possibility of subtropical development north of the Bahamas in the proceeding days related to a broad low pressure system that was expected to form near Cuba. By May 13, thunderstorm activity began to increase in association with a developing trough near the western tip of Cuba, and the NHC considered the developing system to have a 70% chance of subtropical formation in the next five days, although the associated shower and thunderstorm activity was not well organized. Convection began to slowly build around the center by early May 16, and a well-defined low-level circulation (LLC) began to form displaced just slightly east of the main thunderstorms. Based on this, the NHC upgraded the low to Tropical Depression One on the evening of May 16. The system was considered tropical instead of subtropical in nature due to persisting central deep convection and a tight radius of winds. Based on reports from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft of tropical-storm force winds, the NHC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Arthur at 03:00 UTC on May 17. Being steered generally north-northeast for the next several hours, Arthur stayed well offshore of the coasts of Florida and Georgia. However, a mid-level trough centered over the United States caused Arthur to slowly be pushed northeastwards over a section of relatively cool waters and as a result most of the storm's convection became limited to the east of the circulation. Despite these unfavorable conditions, reconnaissance aircraft found Arthur slightly stronger, despite its appearance on satellite degrading significantly throughout the past few hours. Deep convection began to swiftly re-develop over the center as the storm began to move over warmer waters of the Gulf Stream, resulting in strengthening. As Arthur intensified, its center skirted the coast of the Outer Banks in North Carolina, passing a mere southeast from Cape Hatteras. As a ridge strengthened to the north, Arthur began to be shoved away from the North Carolina coast and an increase in southwesterly shear as well as the beginning of extratropical transition began to separate the storm's main convective activity away from the LLC. However, the storm was still intensifying and at 06:00 UTC on May 19, Arthur obtained its minimum central pressure of and its peak intensity of 60 mph (95 km/h). Six hours later, the storm completed it transition to an extratropical cyclone as a trailing warm front developed behind the now almost fully exposed LLC.  Preparations and impact Caribbean= The precursor to Arthur dropped heavy rainfall in Granma Province in Cuba on May 15, including 78 mm (3.07 in) of rainfall in Bayamo in only four hours. These rains resulted in flooded streets and significant damage to homes. In the Bahamas, squalls occurred on Grand Bahama island, where many were still recovering from the adverse effects of Hurricane Dorian. Gusty winds damaged tents and other temporary shelters across the island, and heavy rainfall caused some minimal flooding. However, since the strongest winds of the disturbance were located to the east of the center, damage was limited. =United States= alt=Radar mosaic of Arthur Although Arthur never directly impacted Florida as a tropical system, the precursor system to Arthur caused heavy rainfall and gusty winds in the Florida Keys and South Florida throughout May 13-14. Over 4 in (101.6 mm) of rain fell in many sections of the Middle Keys and a peak rainfall total of 5.35 in (135.8 mm) fell in Marathon on May 14, where it was the tenth highest rainfall amount for the city on record and second most for May. Flash flood warnings were issued for large portions of Miami-Dade County on May 14, where street flooding was reported. Tropical storm-force wind gusts as well as waterspouts prompted the issuance of gale warnings and special marine warnings across the majority of South Florida. Rip currents in Florida led to the water rescues of 70 people in Volusia County, 3 of whom were hospitalized. Purple and red flags were raised along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina to alert the public for rip currents. Offshore Georgia, 3-6 ft (0.9-1.8 m) waves were reported. Damage across Florida reached $112,000. On May 16, tropical storm watches were issued from Surf City to Duck and Pamlico Sound to Albemarle Sound. A day later, these watches were upgraded to tropical storm warnings as Arthur moved closer towards the Outer Banks. By late May 17, rough surf conditions were already being experienced on the southern portion of the Outer Banks. Torrential rainfall occurred as Arthur's outer rainbands scraped eastern North Carolina, with of rain falling in Newport within 6 hours, and many other locations recording at least of rain from the storm. Tropical storm-force wind gusts in Cape Hatteras were also recorded, although the lopsided nature of the storm kept the strongest winds offshore. Wave heights as high as 12.5 ft (3.8 m) were recorded from buoys along the coast of the Outer Banks from Arthur. Due to flooding from Arthur, many highways in the Outer Banks and into mainland North Carolina were closed. SpaceX was also forced to delay the launch of several Starlink internet satellites due to adverse weather from Arthur affecting the recovery fleet. As Arthur moved away from the coast, tropical storm warnings were lifted as conditions gradually improved later in the evening.

Early career Sheila Dowling was born Sheila Bowen around 1896. She worked as a stenographer in D√°il courts in north Dublin city during the War of Independence, working for the republican solicitor Michael Noyk. During a raid on an IRA depot in Blackhall Place, Dowling was arrested and taken to Dublin Castle. She successfully disposed of important papers by eating them. She was opposed to the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and was arrested leaving Dublin on her way to speak in Glasgow for Sinn F√©in during the Civil War. Dowling was one of the group of 81 republican women prisoners in Kilmainham Gaol who resisted their transfer to the North Dublin Union as they did not want to be separated from two of their colleagues who were on hunger strike. The group was forcibly moved with marked violence by male prison officers in May 1923. She was on the executive of Cumann na mBan by the late 1920s. Dowling was active in the labour movement, working as the personal secretary to the general secretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, William X. O'Brien, working as an organiser for the Irish Women Workers' Union (IWWU), representing the Union on the Dublin trades' council and representing Irish Trade Union Congress the at the international labour conferences in Prague and Geneva. Around 1930, she married Frank Dowling. He later worked as the manager of Dublin's Metropole cinema. They had one daughter. Career post Irish independence Within the IWWU Dowling was a close associate of the militant socialist and pro- republican Helena Molony, which brought her into conflict with the more moderate Louie Bennett and Helen Chenevix. The tensions between the two groups in the early 1930s were focused on Dowling's and Molony's pro-Soviet sympathies and associations with Irish communists. She was an active member in the Irish section of Friends of Soviet Russia, visiting the USSR in the summer of 1930 with a delegation with Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington and Charlotte Despard. Impressed by the apparent promise of gender equality in the USSR, Dowling lectured on life there, generating more controversy. In September 1931, Dowling was one of the four women on the founding executive of Saor √âire. When the group was banned by the Free State government, Dowling withdrew from the executive. After the legal re-interpretation of union rules on members receiving marriage benefit, Dowling was forced to resign as IWWU president and trustee in March 1932. This highlighted the contradiction between IWWU's support for gender equality with its reluctance to facilitate married women entering the workforce. It has been speculated that it was Bennett who exploited the issue to force Dowling out. She continued to work with other groups, such as the British Boycott Committee, and opposed the ratification of the 1937 Irish constitution on the grounds of how it would affect women and their role in society. She campaigned with the Labour Party in Dublin when it opposed the 1939 Offences Against the State Act. Dowling lived at 8 Belgrave Road, Rathmines, Dublin from the early 1940s. She died from breast cancer at Hume Street hospital on 26 June 1957, and is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery. Senator Frank Purcell remembered Dowling as \\"the nicest and most sincere little woman I ever met‚Ä¶a grand character\\".

Geography Higbee Beach features a mile and a half of pristine shoreline from New England Road to Sunset Boulevard. There are six locales at the Wildlife Management Area: Signal Hill, Davey‚Äôs Lake, Pond Creek, Sassafras Island, Hidden Valley, and the Magnesite Plant. The Hidden Valley farm was a 92-acre farm that was sold to New Jersey in 1986 and incorporated in Higbee Beach. Part of the farm is used for equestrian activities. Davey's Lake, which is 300 yards long, 90 yards wide, and 12 feet deep, was dug in 1910 by the Cape May Sand Company. History In 1807, a tavern was constructed at the mouth of the New England Creek and Delaware Bay, at the present-day location of the Cape May Canal. It was run by Thomas and Rhoda Forrest until 1823, when pilot Joseph S. Higbee purchased the land. By 1830, he had come to own a large plantation. Higbee used the spot as a landing location for passengers from Philadelphia. When he died in 1872, his brother Thomas Higbee inherited the land and operated a small hotel. He intended that the property remain in the family as long as possible, so after he died his niece Etta inherited it. When she died seven years after him, his body was dug up from the property and reinterred at Cold Spring Presbyterian Church, and the property was sold out of the family. In the early 1900s, railroad tracks were built along the beach to support sand mining. After falling into disuse, it remained buried by the tides until reappearing in 2014 and have reappeared several time since then. With the outbreak of World War I, Bethlehem Steel president Eugene C. Grace purchased a tract along Higbee Beach in 1915 to serve as a \\"proving grounds\\" for munitions testing of artillery shells. The facility shut down shortly after the war ended. Higbee Beach was the site of a bootlegging operation during Prohibition. The large dune known as Signal Hill was named due to being a lookout point for bootleggers. In 1940, the hotel was demolished. A magnesite plant was constructed in 1941 by Dresser Industries and operated until it was demolished in 1989. During the 1960s, Higbee Beach became known as a nude beach. For several decades naturists shared the beach with tourists and birdwatchers. In 1986, Lower Township passed an ordinance prohibiting nudity. The battle was fought in the courts, which ruled in the naturists' favor since the beach was owned by the state, Lower Township did not have the authority to ban nudity. In 1999, New Jersey passed a law against nudity due to reports of illicit sexual activity. The state legislature gave local police a $120,000 grant for enforcement, which largely curtailed nude behavior at Higbee Beach. In 2006, Lower Township police issued 20 citations for nudity at the beach. Higbee Beach is said to be haunted by a phantom black dog, or \\"hell hound\\", that is said to be cursed by Native Americans. A strange man with a coat and hat, thought to be the ghost of Thomas Higbee, has also been spotted. Flora and fauna Higbee Beach experiences one of the world's largest migrations of birds in North America. The Endangered and Nongame Species Program manages raptors and songbirds. The beach is also home to dragonflies and butterflies. During the spring and summer, several species of birds including Blue Grosbeak, Indigo Bunting, Yellow-breasted Chat, and Prairie Warbler breed at the beach. A forest comprising holly, red cedar, sassafras, persimmon, northern bayberry, scrub oak, wild black cherry, common wax myrtle and beach plum is responsible for stabilizing the dunes. The rare orchid Spiranthes odorata can be found growing at Higbee Beach. Recreation The beach at the WMA Higbee Beach features roughly 2 miles of trails. In 1999, the Bureau of Land Management added a dune trail. Hunting is permitted starting Monday after the Six-day Firearm Deer Season every year. Higbee Beach is a popular place to find Cape May diamonds, quartz crystals rounded and polished by the sea. While swimming is officially prohibited, this is rarely enforced as there are frequently swimmers in the bay.

Tesla subsequently chose to construct Giga Nevada (formerly Gigafactory 1) in Nevada in 2014. By June of 2020, a different location near Austin was being considered. It is a site () bordering Harold Green Road and Texas State Highway 130. On June 16, 2020 the Commissioners' court of Travis County discussed a possible incentives package for Tesla. In July 2020, the Del Valle Independent School District approved a tax incentives package worth $68 million, should the Tesla Gigafactory be built. On July 22, 2020, during a 2Q2020 earnings call, Tesla announced that Austin, Texas had been selected for Gigafactory 5. By the end of July, construction had begun.

Jones is an American historian and legal scholar. She is the Society of Black Alumni Presidential Professor and Professor of History at The Johns Hopkins University. She studies the legal and cultural history of the United States, with a particular focus on how Black Americans have shaped the history of American democracy. She has published books on the voting rights of African American women, the debates about women's rights among Black Americans in the early United States, and the development of birthright citizenship in the United States as promoted by African Americans in Baltimore before the Civil War. Education and academic career Jones attended Hunter College, where she graduated with a BA degree in 1984. She then attended law school at the City University of New York, earning a JD in 1987. From 1987 to 1994, Jones was a public interest lawyer with MFY Legal Services and the HIV Law Project. In 1994, she was awarded a Charles H. Revson Fellowship on the Future of the City of New York at Columbia University. Jones then became a graduate student at Columbia University, and obtained an MA in history in 1997, an MPhil in history in 1998, and a PhD in history in 2001. During her graduate studies, Jones was an adjunct lecturer at Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts at The New School, and a visiting professor of history at Barnard College. In 2001, she joined the faculty of History and Afroamerican and African Studies at the University of Michigan, where she was an Arthur F. Thurnau Professor from 2013 to 2017, and a Presidential Bicentennial Professor from 2016 to 2017. From 2004 to 2017 she was also affiliated with the University of Michigan Law School. In 2017 Jones joined the faculty at The Johns Hopkins University, becoming the Society of Black Alumni Presidential Professor and Professor of History. Jones has held visiting positions, including at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School. She has held fellowships from the American Council of Learned Societies, the National Humanities Center, Library Company of Philadelphia, and the National Constitution Center. She is a distinguished lecturer of the Organization of American Historians. In 2018 Jones was elected a Fellow of the American Antiquarian Society. In 2017, she became a co- president of the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians, and serves on the board of governors for the William L. Clements Library. Research In 2007, Jones published the book All Bound Up Together: The Woman Question in African American Public Culture, 1830‚Äì1900. In All Bound Up Together, Jones studies the woman question as it pertained specifically to African American women, by studying the debate over women's rights in African American public culture during the early 1800s. Jones presents evidence that contradicts the dominant narrative that the women's rights movement in America began with the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, instead showing that African American women like Maria W. Stewart successfully contested the right to speak before a mixed- gender audience as early as the 1830s. Jones also discusses the backlash against these activists, and the trajectory of the following generations of activists up to 1900. Jones shows that the American Civil War provided black women the opportunity to expand their involvement in public service activities like teaching and charity work, and that despite the constraints of the Reconstruction era and Jim Crow laws, many black women were able to further their position in social and religious institutions and thereby accrue public authority. Jones is also the author of the 2018 book Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America. Jones explains the development of Birthright citizenship in the United States using both legal and extra-legal claims by African Americans in the city of Baltimore. She argues that the development of birthright citizenship for African Americans was not an automatic consequence of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or intellectual activity and activism that followed the Dred Scott v. Sandford decision, but was mainly developed through claims that arose from everyday activity. Rather than focusing primarily on Congressional debates or judicial decisions, Jones traces how free black people in Baltimore gradually inhabited the role of citizens by engaging with the legal system to claim opportunities like travel permits, debt relief, gun licenses, control over property, lawsuits, and contract-making. Jones uses evidence mainly from the 1790s through the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, and although she focuses primarily on Baltimore, she also incorporates evidence from throughout the United States during that period. Jones also studies the activities of the Legal Rights Association, the politics of colonization and how state-level petitions and legislative activism by African Americans rendered the Dred Scott decision less effective over time. In the same year that Birthright Citizens was published, Donald Trump suggested that he would end birthright citizenship in the United States by executive order, so the book was noted for studying a timely subject with particular implications for the status of unauthorized immigrants to the United States. In addition to publishing books and academic articles, Jones also co-edited the 2015 volume Toward an Intellectual History of Black Women. She is also the author of the 2020 book Vanguard: How Black Women Broke Barriers, Won the Vote, and Insisted on Equality for All.

It was published in 1830 and is one of the Sc√®nes de la vie militaire of La Com√©die humaine. Plot summary The story is told in the first person by an unnamed narrator. In the frame story, the narrator tells his companion, after attending a show in a menagerie, a story he heard from a former French soldier. The soldier had been captured during Napoleon's campaign in Egypt. He escaped from his captors with a horse, food and weapons. After the horse dies he finds refuge in a cave and manages to tame a panther with which he is somehow in love. He calls her \\"Mignonne\\", in memory of his former lover, and projects a number of feminine qualities on the beast. He sets off walking through the desert towards the Nile to be rescued, and is followed by the panther. He stabs the animal to death when he mistakely thinks she is attacking him. He is rescued by soldiers who find him in tears. The story finishes with the soldier telling the narrator of his regrets and of his experience of the desert. Adaptation The story was the basis for an American film version in 1997, called Passion in the Desert. Themes Balzac had planned to write a number of stories in the Sc√®nes de la vie militaire section of La Comedie Humaine, but Une passion dans le d√©sert was one of only completed two that were completed, the other being Les Chouans.

The building was constructed in 1892, designed in the Romanesque Revival style by John Flynn. The station was decommissioned in 1966, and served as an electronics store from 1975 to 2014. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016, accompanying planned renovations. The station is one of two remaining Columbus fire stations designed by Flynn, and one of seven 1890s fire stations remaining in the city. Design West side and hose tower The building, completed in 1892, was designed by John Flynn with Romanesque Revival architecture. The two-story building utilizes brick and limestone, and is approximately 44 feet wide and 64 feet long. The area in which it was built was primarily residential from the late 1800s to the middle of the 20th century, but most of the area was converted to commercial, primarily industrial uses beginning in the 1950s. The building remains largely intact, although some of its front-facing windows and doors have been filled in. The building's primary facade featured a row of windows above two large doorways for horse-drawn firefighting equipment. The doors and many of the windows have been infilled, though the facade's brick and limestone features remain largely intact. The building's 60-foot-tall hose tower stands out in its design and historical function for drying out hoses following use. The station also features stables and a feed loft, a remnant from when the station housed its equipment-bearing horses.

It was originally scheduled to premiere on 30 March 2020, however due to the COVID-19 pandemic the premiere was postponed and filming was suspended. The telenovela is written by Thereza Falc√£o and Alessandro Marson, with the collaboration of Duba Elia, J√∫lio Fischer, Lalo Homrich, M√¥nica Sanches and Wendell Bendelack. It stars Selton Mello, Mariana Ximenes, Gabriela Medvedovski, Michel Gomes, Alexandre Nero, Heslaine Vieira, Daphne Bozaski and Let√≠cia Sabatella in the main roles.  Plot  In 1856, the emperor Dom Pedro II (Selton Mello) lives a marriage of appearances with Teresa Cristina (Let√≠cia Sabatella), with whom he was forced to marry at a young age by their parents' political alliance, having with her two daughters: Isabel (Giulia Gayoso) and Leopoldina (Bruna Griphao). Dom Pedro is in love with Countess Lu√≠sa (Mariana Ximenes), an educated woman, who fights for the abolitionist cause and for the rights of women, married to Eug√™nio (Thierry Tremouroux), the emperor's cousin. At the same time there are sisters Pilar (Gabriela Medvedovski) and Dolores (Daphne Bozaski): the first went to a convent after her mother's death in childhood, growing up among books and dreaming of studying medicine, while the second stayed at home to take care of her father, Colonel Eudoro (Jos√© Dumont), growing repressed and illiterate. Upon returning home and discovering that she was promised in marriage to Tonico (Alexandre Nero), a bad-tempered politician and twice her age, Pilar flees and, on her way, falls in love with the fugitive slave Jorge (Michel Gomes), who doesn't even imagine being the illegitimate son of Colonel Ambr√≥sio (Roberto Bonfim) and Tonico's half brother. With the escape, Dolores is given in marriage to Tonico in the place of Pilar, suffering several mistreatments for being considered \\"ugly\\" by him, who does not give up obsessively pursuing Pilar and punishing Samuel, in addition to plotting a coup d'√©tat against Dom Pedro II in a dirty political game. Pilar and Samuel still have as an obstacle Zayla (Heslaine Vieira), who also likes Samuel and is willing to do anything to harm her rival, being the daughter of C√¢ndida (Dani Ornellas) and Olu (Hoji Fortuna), who founded the Little Africa neighborhood, which welcomes freed blacks to give it the opportunity for growth. The coffee growers Lota (Vera Holtz) and Batista (Lu√≠s Melo) dream of moving up in life and to achieve this they use their sons: the ambitious N√©lio (Jo√£o Pedro Zappa), who is Tonico's henchman and gets advantages from it, and the sweet Bernardo (Gabriel Fuentes), whose parents want to force to seduce Isabel or Leopoldina to enter royalty, although he loves Lupita (Roberta Rodrigues), without imagining that she is his father's lover.

In December of that year it was revealed that the new telenovela would be a continuation of the previous plot and that it would continue to be centered in Imperialist Brazil, but taking place 40 years after the closure of Novo Mundo, addressing the period when Dom Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil was in power. The synopsis was approved in May 2018. Initially Nos Tempos do Imperador would debut in September 2019, replacing √ìrf√£os da Terra. In January of that year, however, it was announced that production had switched places with √âramos Seis, who would be its replacement, and would now premiere in the first half of 2020, since production faced difficulties in adapting the historical facts to the plot. Filming began in January 2020, using Chapada Diamantina, in Bahia, and cities in the interior of Rio de Janeiro, Barra do Pira√≠, Rio das Flores and Petr√≥polis, known as \\"City of Dom Pedro II\\", because it is one of the cities where the emperor had lived, including the former Imperial Palace. The city scenery was designed by scenographers Paula Salles and Paulo Renato and built in an area of 8,200 square meters, reproducing places in Rio de Janeiro such as Valongo Wharf, Rua do Ouvidor, Passeio P√∫blico and the old neighborhood of Pequena √Åfrica, beyond the interior of the palace and houses. Most sets were reused from Novo Mundo. Among the historical themes chosen to address in the telenovela, the abolitionist struggle, the first acts of women's rights and the causes that led to the Paraguayan War were selected.. On 16 March 2020, it was announced that filming of the telenovela was suspended indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. = Casting = Emilio Dantas was the first name confirmed as the protagonist Dom Pedro II, but he was replaced by Selton Mello, who accepted the invitation to join the plot, as the network tried to convince him to return to telenovelas after two decades ago. Although he claimed that he would never return to telenovelas and focused on his career in cinema, Selton decided to accept the invitation because he was interested in the imperialist theme, this being his first telenovela in twenty-one years, since For√ßa de um Desejo in 1999. Andreia Horta would play Empress Teresa Cristina, and even went so far as to give details about the character, however, with the postponement of the telenovela, the actress decided to accept the invitation to star in another telenovela and was replaced by Renata Gaspar. Renata, however, was considered very inexperienced in the area of drama after the first readings of the script and the role went to Let√≠cia Sabatella. As Nos Tempos do Imperador is a continuation of Novo Mundo, the writers chose five characters to bring back from the previous telenovela. Quinzinho and Vit√≥ria, who were the babies of the protagonist couple in the first plot, are now portrayed by Augusto Madeira and Maria Clara Gueiros, while the governess of the palace Lurdes, which was played by Bia Guedes, now returns to the age of 60 to be played by Lu Grimaldi. Vivianne Pasmanter and Guilherme Piva return with their original characters Germana and Licurgo, however, now 80 years old. For that to happen, the two received special effects makeup.

In total, 54 were built. The E 162 proved to be an unreliable combine, and it was soon replaced by the Fortschritt E 170 series.  Description  The E 162 is a tractor- drawn combine harvester. It has a backbone tube chassis, a single axle, two wheels, and a body made of sheet metal panels. As it does not have an engine, it is solely driven by a tractor's 540 min‚àí1 PTO. When used for combine harvesting, it requires a tractor with an engine power output of approximately 29‚Ä¶44 kW. The power requirement for stationary threshing is lower, according to the manual, it is approximately 15 kW. All the E 162's systems are driven from the input shaft by chains, and belts. The E 162's header is not designed to be detachable quickly, but it can be folded. Its cutting width is 2100 mm (7 ft). The header mowing height, and reel height can be adjusted with hand cranks. Both the cutting speed and reel speed are fixed. The material passes through the E 162 from the header, which is mounted on the E 162's right hand side, to the longitudinally installed threshing drum inside the combine's body. The threshing drum has a length of 1250 mm and a width of 500 mm; it has 7 rasp bars. Its speed is adjustable between 850 and 1500 min‚àí1 by altering the drive belt pulley distance with the adjusting screws and a jaw spanner. The concave has a 130¬∞ angle, and 12 steel bars. The distance between threshing drum and concave can be finely adjusted using levers. The E 162 does not have secondary material processing systems such as rotors or straw walkers. Instead, the straw, which makes a 90¬∞ turn after it comes out of the threshing drum, falls on two finely perforated conveyor belts, that transport the straw away from the threshing drum to the straw baler, which is installed in the E 162's rear compartment. Corn, that has not yet been threshed out of the straw, can fall through the conveyor belts onto the pan. The corn cleaning system works with two sieves, and a fan. Chaff is sucked out of the combine and collected in a separate chaff waggon. An auger transports the corn to the combine's roof, where the secondary sorting system is installed. It consists of rotating sorting cylinders. From these cylinders, the corn is filled into jute sacks, according to the corn size. Up to 600 kg of corn can be stored on the E 162's roof.

She and four similar ferries, Lady Chelmsford (1910), Lady Denman (1912), Lady Edeline (1913), and Lady Ferguson (1914), were a new series of \\"Lady-class\\", designed by renowned naval architect, Walter Reeks. Lady Scott and her four sisters survived the 1932 opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and were converted to diesel power that decade. They also survived the 1951 NSW State Government takeover of the ailing ferry fleet. Lady Scott was sold out of ferry service in 1969 for use as a cruise boat. A 1972 fire destroyed her superstructure and she was re- built and successfully run as the John Cadman cruising restaurant. She was sold to new owners, renamed Harbour Queen and enjoyed limited subsequent success. She sank in 2014 in Blackwattle Bay where she was broken up. Design and construction In common with most Sydney Harbour ferries at the time, Lady Scott and her four sisters were wooden double-ended screw steamers. The five ferries had only a single propeller at one end that pushed the vessels in one direction and pulled them in the other. This feature was introduced by the ferry's designer, Walter Reeks, on a previous Balmain company ferry, Lady Rawson of 1906. The configuration contrasted with the double-ended vessels of Sydney Ferries Limited (the K-class ferries) which had a continuous propeller shaft and a screw at each end. A single propeller and one shaft simplified the internal arrangements and put less stress on the timber hulls compared to shafts running a propeller at either end. Apart from some unusual handling characteristics, the single-propeller configuration was a success and Reeks unsuccessfully tried to patent it. Along with Lady Denman (1912), Lady Scott hull was built by J Dent of Jervis Bay from local timbers. Lady Scott was launched on 4 November at Huskisson and christened by Miss Roderick, daughter of one of the Directors of the Balmain New Ferry Co. The vessel was towed to Sydney to receive her machinery supplied by McKie & Baxter of Glasgow. The engines were compound 2-cylinder (12\\" and 24\\" x 18\\"), 24 hp (nominal), 160 hp (indicated). She had one boiler of 12 lb pressure and a 7-ton bunker capacity. Her maximum speed was 11.5 knots. Other finishing works was also carried out in Sydney. Lady Chelmsford was built by Brisbane Waters shipbuilder Rock Davis, Lady Edeline by G A Washington of Annandale, and Lady Ferguson by David Drake of Balmain With construction of a Sydney Harbour Bridge seeming likely, she and her four sisters were designed for a maximum of fifteen years of life. Instead, the five would serve on the harbour for at least 60 years, with Lady Scott operating as a ferry until 1969 then as a cruise boat being broken up in 2014. Because they were intended to have a limited life-span, they were lightly built and almost austere in their fittings, such as roofs of galvanised iron. The five were relatively small and had a veed shape and shallow draft to navigate the muddy and silted upper reaches of their upstream runs.Ferries of Sydney Service history From 1900, the Balmain New Ferry Company began a period of expansion to keep up and compete with the tram network expanding into what is now referred to as Sydney's Inner West. Older ferries were sold off including several series of \\"Lady-class\\" class ferries were introduced. Lady Scott was the fourth of five in the Balmain company's final series of \\"Lady-class\\" ferries, the others being Ladies Chelmsford (1910), Denman (1912), Edeline (1913), and Ferguson (1914). This series was introduced to replace the single-ended ferries on the Lane Cove River service. They also worked on the run from Balmain to Erskine Street wharf (at site of current Barangaroo). Lady Scott, and the rest of the Balmain fleet, were bought by Sydney Ferries Limited as part of its take over of the Balmain company on 1 March 1918. The five operated the Lane Cove River services to Fig Tree until 12 November 1931 when weekday services were suspended. They ran weekend services to Fig Tree on weekends until 2 September 1945. Lane Cove River services were discontinued altogether on 10 November 1950, after which the five saw them work the Parramatta River and across other routes. Sydney Ferries ran a service to Balmain until it was taken over in 1939 by Nicholson Brothers Harbour Transport Company with their own ferries. The five \\"Lady class\\" ferries were run on other routes across the Harbour. In 1932, the Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened, and Sydney Ferries Ltd's annual patronage dropped from 40 million to about 15 million. As part of economy measures, almost older and/or larger steamers were put up for sale, and the five \\"Lady- class\\" ferries were converted to diesel power in the 1930s with Lady Chelmsford first. Their tall black smoke stacks were replaced with short funnels. Facing uncertain post-Bridge times, Sydney Ferries Ltd sought a refreshed look for their ferries, covering the original livery of varnished timber and white trim with yellow and green paint and red trim. On 17 December 1937, Lady Scott re-entered service with a six-cylinder 190 hp Gardner diesel that pushed her to 9 knots. The five \\"Lady\\" ferries continued to run the Hunters Hill and Balmain services. The post-Bridge drop in demand for the ferry fleet was somewhat mitigated as many could not afford their own transport in the Great Depression of the 1930s and rationing of fuel during World War 2 made the coal required for the steam ferries relatively cheap.Kirawa on ferriesofsydney.com However, the post World War II years saw the drop in demand pick up pace. In 1951, with annual patronage down to 9 million, the NSW State Government took over Sydney Ferries Limited and its remaining fleet and assets. The Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Company, which ran the Manly service, was paid to run the services. The services and fleet were quickly rationalised with most of the larger remaining timber K-class steamers being decommissioned, however, the five relatively small and economical \\"Lady-class\\" ferries were retained. Throughout the remainder of the 1950s and into the 1960s, they became the back-bone of Sydney Harbour's non- Manly ferry fleet, along with Karginal and Karrabee the smallest of the K-class ferries. Their routes were expanded to all inner-harbour (ie, non- Manly) services including Taronga Park Zoo, Milsons Point, Cremorne and Hunters Hill. The five sister ferries (except Lady Scott) were re-engined again in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the 1960s the Board updated all their ferries' 1930s green and gold livery to a more muted cream and khaki scheme. Lady Scott, like most ferries on Sydney Harbour, had her share of incidents:Jervis Bay Maritime Museum * In 1925, her propellar shaft broke disabling the ferry off Balls Head. She drifted for half an hour before assistance. * In 1931, she crashed into Longnose Point wharf developing a leak. * In 1943, she collided with Lady Ferguson at Circular Quay today with considerable damage done to the Lady Ferguson. * In 1952, she overshot Cremorne wharf and ran aground with about 40 people on board, mostly children. Although no-one was injured, the ferry broke a propeller shaft when she hit the rocks.

Post ferry career In 1969, Lady Scott suffered major engine troubles on a Mosman to Circular Quay run after which she was laid up at the Balmain ferry base. With her hull also in need of refastening, the State Government put her up for sale. Her buyers intended to use her as a cruise ferry on the Hawkesbury River north of Sydney, however, her draught was too deep for that area. She was converted to a cruise vessel, painted blue and white, fitted with a small high-revving diesel engine, and her aft wheelhouse turned into galley. She cruised around Sydney Harbour with little commercial success. While tied up for the weekend at Rodd Island, she caught fire and burnt to the waterline on 6 November 1972. With her hull relatively undamaged, her superstructure was rebuilt over two years with a new modern appearance. Her part owner, Geoff D'Albora, had planned to call her Aqua Queen in line with his smaller boat Aqua Princess, however, she was re-commissioned as John Cadman. Following a considerable commercial success, she was sold in the 2000s and renamed Harbour Queen, however, this cruising venture was not as successful. She sank at Blackwattle Bay in 2014 and was broken up. Lady Chelmsford, the first built of the five, was sold in 1969 and rebuilt as a show boat in Adelaide. She was sold to Melbourne interests in 1985 where she was used as a cruise boat. She sank at her moorings in 2008 and was broken up in 2011. By the 1970s, Lady Ferguson was being used as a spare ferry on Sydney Harbour. She was towed to Hobart with Kosciusko in 1975 to assist following the collapse of the Tasman Bridge however she was found to be in too poor condition and was scrapped. Lady Denman was pulled from ferry service in 1979 following the introduction that year of the new Lady Street. She is now on permanent land display at Huskisson on the New South Wales south coast. Lady Edeline was the longest serving as a Sydney ferry being decommissioned in 1984 with the remaining wooden K-class ferries following the Karrabee's sinking earlier that year. She was laid up on the Parramatta River and sank into the mud in 1988. Of the five, only Lady Denman is still extant.

In 1872 she married the merchant Eugen Rautenstrauch (1842-1900), who continued her father's import business of animal skins. The Rautenstrauch couple collected antique and ethnological exhibits. Adele Rautenstrauch's younger brother Wilhelm undertook numerous trips around the world and thus built up an extensive ethnological collection. After his death in Ureparapara in 1898, his sister inherited her brother's extraordinary collection, which she had brought to Cologne.Ulrich S.

Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum on Ubierring, 1910 After Eugen Rautenstrauch had died on 18 May 1900, she donated the capital for the construction of a new ethnological museum in memory of her husband on 1 August 1900 in the amount of 250,000 Reichsmark with the condition that the new museum should bear the name Rautenstrauch- Joest-Museum. At the same time, she created the financial conditions for the employment of a renowned museum director. She donated the salary for the first museum director Willy Foy for ten years. Shortly before her sudden death in December 1903, Adele Rautenstrauch announced that she would have the new museum building on the Ubierring built at her expense using the building fund. She died a few days later in Neustrelitz. Tomb of the Rautenstrauch family at the Melaten cemetery After her death in Mecklenburg, Adele Rautenstrauch was transferred to Cologne and buried at Melaten Cemetery on the so-called Millionenallee (between HWG and Lit.

Discovery His remains were found on 9 April 2020 on a tree-lined common area close to apartments in the Lissenfield development off Lower Rathmines Road. No clothing remained on the skeletal remains and there was no apparent attempt to bury them. Investigation A forensic anthropologist and members of the Garda Technical Bureau examined the remains and the site. The remains were moved to Dublin City Mortuary for forensic examination. A postmortem examination was completed on the remains on 21 April 2020 and it did not point towards homicide. As the remains are partial a definitive cause of death could not be determined. DNA tests were performed and cross-referenced with missing persons, but as of 27 April 2020 there had been no matches. The remains were to remain at Dublin City Mortuary until identified. Identification On 22 June 2020 a Garda Press spokeswoman said that the remains had been positively identified and that the Garda√≠ were continuing to try to contact family members. On 7 July 2020 it was announced that the remains were positively identified as those of Stephen Corrigan, a man who had been missing since November 2011. Following the nationwide appeal to find family of the late Stephen Corrigan, Finders International successfully traced living relatives. Father Brendan Corrigan, a first cousin of the deceased man's motherhas been located in County Westmeath. Although he had met Stephen‚Äôs grandfather, George, many years previously he had not met Stephen himself. Stephen was born in 1963 to a single mother, Hanna (o/w Anna) Corrigan. Hanna died in 2015 aged 81 and Stephen‚Äôs only sibling, Edward, who was six years younger than Stephen, died in 2016 aged 46. Hanna, born in 1934, was an only child of George Corrigan and Johanna Newman. George and Johanna married in Dublin in 1932. George Corrigan, Stephen‚Äôs grandfather, was one of 12 siblings - John, Mary, Sarah, Thomas, Joseph, Anne, Norah, Nicholas, Michael, Hubert and Francis. Francis Corrigan, Stephen‚Äôs granduncle married Kathleen O‚ÄôBrien and they had five children, all of whom would be cousins of Stephen‚Äôs mother. Brendan is one of these children. Brendan studied in Maynooth and is now the parish priest in Kilbreggan. Brendan, a first cousin of Stephen‚Äôs mother, Hanna, is Stephen‚Äôs first cousin once removed. Hayley Seager of Finders International, Dublin, said: ‚ÄúThe relatives we found immediately are mostly on Stephen‚Äôs maternal grandfather‚Äôs side of the family. The Corrigan family tree is pretty extensive. We also know that most of the Stephen‚Äôs grandfather‚Äôs family emigrated to the UK, with grandfather George and granduncle Michael Corrigan both working for Ford in Dagenham.‚Äù Background Stephen Corrigan was born on 8 June 1963 and was missing since 22 November 2011. He had been living in the Cork Street area of Dublin when he was last seen alive. He had been a patient at the Weir Home on Cork Street, where nursing and psychiatric care are provided for men. Residents can come and go and he failed to return there on the day he went missing. He suffered from mental health issues and tended to withdraw from society. At these times he was known to live on the streets around Saint Anne's Park, Palmerston Park, Mulhuddart and Glasnevin. His mother kept in contact with Garda√≠ and provided a blood sample for identification. Crimecall broadcast appeals for information on his whereabouts on three occasions. His remains were identified DNA comparison with the blood sample given by his mother. His mother had died before his remains were found as had his only other known blood relative. Garda√≠ believe that he died not long after he was last seen alive. Garda√≠ appealed in July 2020 for any other relatives or anyone with information on his family to contact Rathmines Garda station.

They Were Her Property is \\"the first extensive study of the role of Southern white women in the plantation economy and slave-market system\\" and disputes conventional wisdom that white women played a passive or minimal role in slaveholding. It was published by Yale University Press and released on February 19, 2019. For the book Jones-Rogers received the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the Merle Curti Social History Award from the Organization of American Historians. Synopsis They Were Her Property disputes the idea that white women did not play a significant role in slaveholding in the American south. Jones-Rogers uses primary source documents to illustrate the scope and conduct of white women slaveholders, including testimonials of formerly enslaved people archived by the Federal Writers' Project, and bills of sales for enslaved people bought and sold by white women. The author stated that around 40% of bills of sales from South Carolina in the 18th century included either a female buyer or seller. Jones-Rogers argues that white women were groomed to become plantation mistresses from girlhood through various social norms and often exacted cruelty and sexual violence onto enslaved people. The book addresses the widely-held belief that white women were gentler to enslaved people than white men, and dispels the notion of the \\"Jealous Mistress\\" who is angry that her husband has sex with enslaved women. Jones-Rogers contends that slaveholding was a key mechanism for white women to build wealth and maintain financial independence from their future husbands, and they skirted losing enslaved people to their husbands through various legal tools. Awards and nominations * Los Angeles Times Book Prize, Los Angeles Times (2019) * Merle Curti Social History Award, Organization of American Historians (2020) * Lincoln Prize finalist, Gettysburg College and the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History (2020) Critical reception The book received positive critical reception. In a review for The Washington Post, Elizabeth R. Varon wrote, \\"In holding slave-owning women to account, Jones-Rogers has provided a brilliant, innovative analysis of American slavery, one that sets a new standard for scholarship on the subject.\\" Parul Seghal stated for The New York Times, \\"Jones-Rogers is a crisp and focused writer. She trains her gaze on the history and rarely considers slavery‚Äôs reverberations. They are felt on every page, however.\\" Jeff Forret said in his review for Southwestern Historical Quarterly: \\"Jones-Rogers offers a bold reinterpretation of the relationship between slavery and slave-owning women in the nineteenth-century South.

Early life He was born in Garston, Liverpool on 29 Jun 1741; the son of William Atherton (1717-1746) and Ann Tatlock. Atherton married Bridget Foster at St Peter's Church, Liverpool on 29 November 1759. Career Atherton was a successful instrument and engine maker, and made textile machinery during the eighteenth century. Manufacturing enterprises The first spinning mill to rely solely on steam power were not a commercial success. The first successful designs have been attributed to Atherton, who was a Warrington machine builder, and who helped Sir Richard Arkwright during his early years. Atherton‚Äôs mills had 3000 spindles and were powered by 30 horse power rotary engines. Like most entrepreneurs, he experienced early difficulties in recruiting capital. Initially he enlisted the help of William Harrison, a Manchester manufacturer, and later a J&T; Hodgson, Liverpool merchants. Atherton & Co was a leading manufacturer of cotton spinners, with locations in Warrington, Manchester and Liverpool. He was a proprietor of the Salford Engine Twist Company, in partnership with George Augustus Lee. Atherton owned a cotton mill in Chipping, Lancashire and had part ownership of another mill in Warrington, Cheshire. =Relationship with Richard Arkwright= To put this into historical context; the spinning frame was an Industrial Revolution invention for spinning thread or yarn from fibres such as wool or cotton in a mechanized way. It was developed in 18th-century Britain by Richard Arkwright and John Kay (a clockmaker). Atherton was approached in January 1768 by John Kay and Richard Arkwright (who at the time was an entrepreneur) for both financial, and technical assistance in creating a model of a spinning machine. Atherton at first refused to conduct business with them, owing to Arkwright's poverty stricken appearance, however he later relented and loaned two workmen to make the heavier parts of the machine. A working model was successfully produced and was patented in 1769 by Richard Arkwright. =Machinery patents= In July 1792, Atherton of Hunter Street, Liverpool registered a patent for a machine for twisting, winding and doubling silk, cotton and wool. This patent, # 1896, was issued just one month before Arkwright‚Äôs death. The original duration of the patent was for 14 years. However it is unknown as to whether it was renewed, by his estate since it was listed as an extant parent in 1856. Patent # 2036 was also for a machine for winding wool and cotton and was issued on 29 January 1795. Atherton‚Äôs Liverpool tax records from 1798 also record him trading from Hunter Street. Death Atherton continued working until his death. He died in Harrogate, on 16 August 1799, aged 60 years. He was buried at Christ Church, Harrogate on 20 Aug 1799. A few months after Atherton‚Äôs death, his cotton mills and machinery were advertised for sale.

He was the director of multiple academic libraries, including the libraries of Lincoln University and Eastern Michigan University. Marshall was an active participant in the civil rights movement, serving in a leadership role in a Missouri chapter of the NAACP. He worked to fight discrimination against African-Americans in librarianship and held several leadership roles in the profession, including as vice president of the American Library Association. Later in his life Marshall focused on documenting the history of Ypsilanti, Michigan's black community members, earning him the nickname \\"Mr. Ypsilanti\\". Early life and education Albert Prince Marshall was born September 5, 1914, in Texarkana, Texas. Marshall's father was a carpenter and railroad worker who died when A. P. was young, and his family moved to Kansas City, Missouri. He received a bachelor's degree from Lincoln University in 1938, and went on to earn a second bachelor's degree in library science from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1939. In 1950 he earned a master's degree in intellectual history, and in 1953 he earned another master's degree in history from the University of Illinois. Career as librarian Marshall created A Guide to Negro Periodical Literature by using three-by-five index cards to index scholarly and popular publications, as well as serial publications from fraternal organizations, professional societies, and colleges and universities. He began working on the project while working as a library assistant at Lincoln University in 1939, and it was published in four volumes from 1941 through 1946, pausing during the year and a half he served in the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II. The guide gives a \\"unique snapshot of African American culture and politics before World War II\\" and is now known as The Marshall Index. Marshall took a job at Winston-Salem Teacher's College, working as the director of the school's library from 1941 to 1948. In 1950 he returned to his alma mater, Lincoln University, to serve as the director of libraries. While at Lincoln, Marshall worked to increase the size of the library's collection (nearly tripling in size in less than two decades) and to providing more training opportunities for the library's staff. In 1966 he wrote a book about the university's history, Soldiers' Dream: A Centennial History of Lincoln University in Missouri. In 1969 Marshall moved to Ypsilanti, Michigan to take a job as director of libraries at Eastern Michigan University. He went on to serve as EMU's dean of academic services from 1972 to 1978, and taught as a professor until his retirement in 1980. Service to librarianship Marshall helped found the North Carolina Negro Library Association, the first black library association in the United States, and served as its vice president. He served as the first African-American president of the Missouri Library Association in the early 1960s, as well as serving as the editor of the association's journal. Marshall was an active participant in librarianship through the American Library Association, working to fight discrimination and segregation within the organization. At the first ALA conference he attended in 1940 in Cincinnati, the handful of black attendees were not allowed to stay in the conference hotel or attend meal events; Marshall was asked to use the freight elevator but rode the passenger elevator even after being accosted by another attendee. He served as an councilor on the ALA Council from 1963 to 1976, and in 1965 became the first African-American to serve as chair of the Nominating Committee for ALA president. In 1970 was nominated to serve as the organization's president but lost the election by a slim margin. He also served as one of the eight appointed members of the U.S. Office of Education's National Advisory Council on Library Resources. NAACP leadership In the early 1950s Marshall served as the president of the Jefferson City, Missouri NAACP branch and was the vice president while that branch brought a lawsuit against the Jefferson City school board for forcing black junior high school students to attend the elementary school. Work as historian After his retirement from Eastern Michigan University in 1980, Marshall devoted his energy to historical research, especially the black history of Ypsilanti. The Ypsilanti Library describes his work as \\"pioneering,\\" saying his research \\"helped transform Ypsilanti's sense of itself\\"; Marshall was referred to as \\"Mr. Ypsilanti\\" and \\"the caretaker of black history for the city\\". Marshall wrote about Ypsilanti engineer and inventor Elijah McCoy in his 1989 book The \\"real McCoy\\" of Ypsilanti. Marshall's other books included: * Unconquered Souls: The History of the African American in Ypsilanti (1993) * Helen Walker McAndrew, Ypsilanti's Lady Frontier Doctor (1996), and * The Legendary 4 Horsemen of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (1996). He also wrote a regular column in the Ypsilanti Courier. Personal life Marshall married Ruthe Langley in 1941. They had one child, Satia Marshall Orange, who went on to become the first director of ALA's Office for Literacy and Outreach. Legacy Marshall died March 9, 2001. Throughout his career, Marshall worked to preserve the histories of the African-American experience, beginning with indexing black periodicals and culminating in local histories and interviews sharing the lives of black people who lived through tumultuous times. The interviews he recorded in the 1980s now make up the A.P. Marshall African American Oral History Archive. He received a wide variety of awards and recognition in his lifetime, including: * Distinguished Service to Librarianship award from the Black Caucus of the American Library Association (1978) * Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Award from the Ann Arbor Public Schools (1985) * Distinguished Career Citation from the Association of College and Research Libraries (1989) In 2018, Marshall was listed as one of the four most prominent librarians who stood to oppose racial segregation in the library profession in an ALA Council \\"Resolution to Honor Those Who Fought Segregation\\".

Early life  Quamino was born to a wealthy family near Anomabu in Ghana, perhaps in 1744 or 1745. In the 1750s, when he was a small child, his father made arrangements for him to travel and receive a Western education. However, the captain who was meant to transport Quamino instead sold him into slavery. By the 1760s, Quamino was in Newport, Rhode Island, the property of Captain Benjamin Church, the father of Dr. Benjamin Church. Quamino's duties in the Church household are not clear. Quamino converted to Christianity shortly after arriving in Newport, where he was a member of the First Congregational Church under Samuel Hopkins. In 1769, Quamino married Duchess, a chef enslaved in the household of William and Lucy Channing (parents of Unitarian minister William Ellery Channing). During their marriage, they had a number of children. Charles was born in 1772, Violet in 1776, and Katharine Church in 1779. They also had a daughter named Cynthia. Three of their daughters died young: one at birth, one at age fifteen, and Violet at age 18 in 1792. The couple do not appear to have lived together. Their children lived with Duchess at the Channings' household.  Freedom  In 1773, Quamino and his friend Bristol Yamma won a local lottery. Quamino purchased his freedom with his share of the winnings. It is not clear whether he remained at the Church household, joined his wife at the Channings', or rented a place of his own. Shortly after buying his freedom, however, he became a central member of a plan organized by Samuel Hopkins and Ezra Stiles to send black missionaries to Africa. Although Hopkins and Stiles hoped to eventually send thirty or forty missionaries, the plan began with just Quamino and Yamma as candidates. Both Quamino and Yamma knew African dialects in addition to English, an important asset to make them more effective missionaries than many white academics and divines, and their fundraising letters emphasized the sincerity and strength of their conversions to Christianity. In addition to what were likely sincere religious motivations on Quamino's part, the missionary trip would also enable him to see his mother, with whom he had been able to communicate by letter. The group's fundraising was successful, attracting support from religious figures in America, England, and Africa, including the famous poet Phyllis Wheatley. In 1774, Quamino and Yamma left Newport for the College of New Jersey, now known as Princeton University. They did not enroll and students or officially graduate, but studied directly with the college President John Witherspoon. They are therefore sometimes described as the first Africans educated at an American college. However, the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775 disrupted their studies, and their missionary plan was abandoned. During the war, Quamino served as a privateer, a potentially lucrative position, through which he hoped to buy the freedom of his wife and children. He died in battle in August 1779. In 2018, Quamino was depicted in a dance and multimedia work by Andr√© Daughtry, \\"Spiritual Secularism.\\"  References  Category:18th-century births Category:1779 deaths Category:18th- century American slaves ","title":"John Quamino"},{"id":"63989245","text":"Hayden Building may refer to: * Hayden Building (Boston) * Hayden Building (Columbus, Ohio) ","title":"Hayden Building"},{"id":"63989266","text":"Jeonathan Prato (February 16, 1913, Florence, Italy - January 5, 2006 Jerusalem) was a lawyer and diplomat in the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1949-1978).

It covered the southern parts of Russian Poland. On October 10, 1916, the German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg demanded the eviction of the Austrian General Government of Lublin and the creation of a joint administration with the German General Government of Warsaw.

The group is also considered a pioneer to the Latin pop movement of the 1980s and 1990s. Biography In 1970, four Garcia sisters started a music project originally called \\"Las Incognitas\\" (The Unknowns), due to the group being relatively unknown at the time. With their father as a manager, they performed at schools and festivals throughout the provinces of Chile. With the help of Paco Mairena, the girls received dance lessons and began performing songs from the New York disco wave. Just as the group was about to reach their successful breakthrough, their father and manager passed away. After this, the group dared to explore feminine sensuality and unequivocal sexual intention with their daring outfits, songs, and performances. The group gradually became more known in Chile and South America. In 1978, the group was chosen to perform at the Vi√±a del Mar International Song Festival, the largest music festival of its kind in Latin America. They were also invited to perform at the 1978 Yamaha Popular Song Contest. Soon after, they were discovered by RCA label Victor, which financed their move to Germany, where they were renamed as \\"Super\\". The group experienced a transformation while in Europe, with an attempt to merge Spanish-American music and folklore with the euro disco sound popular at the time. They worked closely with Rolf Soja and Frank Dostal, the same producers for the Baccara duo. Frecuencia Mod even appeared as backing singers on certain Baccara songs. Later that year, the group was invited to perform on Musikladen with their hit song, \\"Gigol√≥\\", which went on to be very successful worldwide. In 1979, the group traveled back to their native Chile to perform in shows, such as in S√°bado Gigante and . This would be one of the last times they would appear back in Chile. Soon afterward, in Germany, the sisters married German citizens, decided to settle in Europe, and slow down on their musical activity.

His work has garnered several prizes and honors, including the Tchernichovski Prize for Translation (2008) and the French Chevalier dans l'ordre des Arts et des Lettres (2018). As of 2020, Manor published five books of poetry, dozens of literary translations ‚Äì especially from French (Baudelaire, Mallarm√©, Val√©ry, Rimbaud, Hugo) ‚Äì and is the founding editor of the Hebrew literary journal Ho! (since 2005). He also edits books of poetry by other Hebrew poets.  Early life and education  Manor was born in Tel Aviv to a Jewish Israeli family. During his high school studies, he developed an interest in the French language and in French literature. As a teenager, Manor discovered he was attracted to men, and experienced loneliness and fear, in what he later described as an atmosphere of intolerance of homosexuality in Israel at the time, and a lack of inspiring, visible homosexuals in the Israeli public sphere.Stated in an interview, He remained closeted until his early twenties, and came out some time after returning from New York City and encountering the poetry of Allen Ginsberg.Stated in interview to Yoni Livneh, published in Yedioth Ahronoth, 16.03.2012. Reproduced online in He published his first translations into Hebrew, of poems from Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal, when he was 18 and serving in the Israeli Defense Force (as a producer and broadcast editor at the army radio station), in the literary supplement of Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz. In 1995 he moved to Paris to study French and literature at the Paris Diderot University. He completed a Dipl√¥me d'√âtudes Sup√©rieur Appliqu√© degree in the University of Paris 8 Vincennes-Saint-Denis in 2000, and a doctorate with honors from the Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales (INALCO) in 2017. His doctoral dissertation topic was \\"Baudelaire in Hebrew (1890-present): his reception, influence, and translations\\". During his time at INALCO, Manor also taught Hebrew literature. Literary workHebrew poetry= Manor has published five volumes of original poetry so far. The first, titled Minority (Hebrew: ◊û◊ô◊¢◊ï◊ò), published in 2000, contains original poetry as well as several classic French poems in translation. It was shortly followed, in 2001, by the standalone publication of a libretto Manor co-wrote with poet Anna Herman for an opera named Alpha and Omega (music by Gil Shohat), based on a series of lithographs by Edvard Munch. In 2005, Manor published another volume of original Hebrew poetry and translations from the French, titled Baritone (Hebrew: ◊ë◊ê◊®◊ô◊ò◊ï◊ü). In 2012, a comprehensive collection of Manor's poetic work was published under the title The Center of the Flesh (Hebrew: ◊ê◊û◊¶◊¢ ◊î◊ë◊©◊®), edited and with a scholarly essay by Hebrew literature professor Dan Miron. As of 2020, Manor's latest book of original poetry is 2019's One Soul Away (Hebrew: ◊†◊§◊© ◊ê◊ó◊™ ◊ê◊ó◊®◊ô◊ö).  Poetics  Manor is a poet with a distinct style, emphasizing musicality, meter, rhyme, and classical structures (such as sonnets, a form that waned in popularity in the latter third of the 20th century in Hebrew). Manor does not reject free verse, noting that: Of the craft of poetry, Manor said: Nonetheless, Manor regards himself as a non-prolific poet, remarking:  Early reception and the meter-and-rhyme controversy  In 2001, following the publication of Manor's first two books ‚Äì Minority and Alpha and Omega ‚Äì Benny Ziffer, longtime editor of the literary supplement of Ha'aretz, who had previously published Manor's early translations of Baudelaire, sparked a lively debate on poetic form when he wrote a glowing review of the two books, noting that \\"forty years after [the music of poetry] was trampled by an avantgarde aspiring to plain speech\\", Manor's poetry is \\"a watershed moment for Hebrew poetry\\" and praising the \\"welcome nerve to go back to basics in poetry, as though [Hebrew free verse poets] Amichai, Wollach, and Wieseltier never existed\\". This unusually warm reception by the editor of a prestigious Hebrew literary periodical led to a number of responses, and started a public controversy, mostly published in later issues of the same literary supplement of Ha'aretz. The most influential dissent was by veteran Hebrew poet Nathan Zach, whose poetic \\"rebellion\\" against the then-regnant poetics of Nathan Alterman in the mid-1950s was so impactful it led to a wide rejection of meter and rhyme in almost all Hebrew poetry written after Zach's early books. In the article Zach submitted to Ziffer as a response to Ziffer's praise, he rejected Manor's poetics as \\"regressive\\", \\"epigonic\\" (e.g. of Manor's admired Baudelaire), as well as mocked Manor's poetic exaggeration, in the titular poem \\"Minority\\": \\"O, country all of whose poets are straight!\\". Zach did acknowledge that his own epigones have often failed to apply \\"a sufficiently- musical ear\\", as free verse requires \\"even more than the tam-tam trance of metered verse\\", but asserted that \\"the solution cannot be to return to Alterman and Baudelaire\\". Manor responded to Zach's attack, in an article also published in Ha'aretz, defending his poetics and denying the allegation he rejects all free verse or the entire poetic generations from Zach onwards. He also compared his own poetic exaggeration to Russian poet Marina Tsvetaeva's similar exaggeration in her line \\"All poets are Jews\\". Yoram Bronowski, another critic writing in Ha'aretz's literary supplement, also praised Manor's Minority, calling Manor \\"a master of the [Hebrew] language, a virtuoso with few peers in the history of Hebrew poetry, perhaps comparable to Ephraim Luzzatto\\". Bronowski also appreciated Manor's included translation of Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud's co-written \\"Sonnet to an ass-hole\\", judging it \\"a translation of genius, like (almost) all of Manor's translations\\", and that Manor recreated the French poem as \\"an original, witty, surprising Hebrew poem\\". Bronowski notes Manor excels at translating \\"the poets considered 'untranslatable', like Baudelaire and Mallarm√©\\", and that Manor's rendition of two verse fables by La Fontaine are \\"among the peaks of the art of translation, a marvel of wit and elegance\\", but that with \\"a somewhat 'simpler' poet such as Auden, he is somewhat less successful, though still employing his fantastic language gift.\\"  Later reception  Israeli historian, essayist, and translator Amotz Giladi wrote of Manor's third book, Baritone, that in it Manor \\"opens a window to the laboratory where the miracle of the alchemy of the word takes place\\", citing several examples of what he considers particularly poems executed in a form particularly well-suited to their semantic content. In general, Giladi cautioned against \\"rejecting classical forms a priori, with no regard to how they are used and how well they work with the content\\". He identified the polarity between childhood and adulthood as a key to the book. Fellow poet and translator Rafi Weichert, on the other hand, rejected the book entirely, accusing Manor of a \\"calculated attempt to distance himself from Nathan Zach\\", and asserting that Manor's poetry is insincere and uninspired. At the same time, he also complains that Manor chose to publish only 28 original poems in Baritone (the other half of the book being Manor's translations of French poetry), interpreting it as further evidence supporting his aesthetic judgment. Nonetheless, Weichert allows that some of Manor's poems are \\"excellent\\", singling out \\"◊§◊®◊ô◊û◊î\\" (\\"unraveling\\").An English translation of this poem, by Ronen Sonis, is available in Manor's site near the bottom of the main page. Poet and translator Amir Beker reviewed the book, writing that \\"Manor's work is vibrant with [a mixture of] contemporary Hebrew and admirably literary language, slang and foreign terms with genuine richness; this is much more than reclaiming words from oblivion and reintroducing them into circulation\\". He, too, identifies a focus on time and personal memory in the book's themes. \\"Manor is a total poet.\\", he adds, \\"He treats his work and its themes with gravity, and even when he writes about his loves, his poetry is never cloying. The hints of humor here and there, too, elicit laughter in the reader that isn't only amused.\\" Tel Aviv University professor of literature Ziva Shamir praised the book, and Manor's poetics in general, noting that \\"the regnant free verse imported into Hebrew literature 50 years ago is today the epigone's refuge\\", and \\"Manor's revolution is welcome and necessary\\". She accuses the \\"old guard\\" of unjustifiably resisting change, and observes that \\"it is no accident that poetry lost its appeal to the general public\\", expressing the hope Manor's poetics are the beginning of a change that would restore poetry's central position in Hebrew culture. She worries, however, that Manor's \\"aestheticist\\", \\"art for art's sake\\" poetics would not be sufficient to usher in a new era in Hebrew poetry. In The Center of the Flesh, Manor's fourth book, Hebrew literature scholar and novelist Lilach Netanel found \\"the beautiful poet; the sensual, erotic poet\\", as well as \\"the dead poet\\", considering this book's retrospective quality to be Manor's contemplation of his own future demise. Classics scholar and Hebrew poet Reviel Netz praised Manor for his words \\"having a tactile quality, words-as-sculpture\\", as well as for the \\"musical perfection\\" of his lines. Netz notes Manor's use of longer lines than is common in Hebrew or English metered poetry. He observes that \\"for 20 years now, Manor has been working to create both the sound and the audience\\" for the music of his poetry. Poet, novelist, translator, and literary editor Yehuda Vizan, on the other hand, reviewing this volume, forcefully rejected Manor's entire corpus of original poetry, going so far as to declare \\"Manor is not a poet\\". Vizan regards Manor's poetry as \\"subservient to his politics\\", and mocks the praise by Dan Miron in the comprehensive essay accompanying the volume. Poet, critic, and literary editor Eli Hirsh interpreted this volume's inclusion of lyrics Manor wrote to music by Israeli composer Sasha Argov as \\"testimony to the centrality of music to Manor's poetics\\". He identifies \\"fertility and barrenness\\" as a key polarity in Manor's symbolic vocabulary, and writes that Manor regards poetry as \\"an avenue of fertility\\" for homosexuals, and a way to \\"exist beyond death\\". Of Manor's fifth book, One Soul Away, critic and poet Eli Hirsh wrote: \\"fascinating and diverse, full of beauty and vitality\\". Hirsh maintains that in this book, Manor has matured and is expressing key events in his life in \\"open, sharp, revealing, and occasionally cruel words\\", having given up on his youthful revolutionary ideas. Hirsh asserts that despite Manor's early success at a young age, Manor should be considered a \\"slow-maturing poet\\", and considers this book to be Manor's mature work. =Translation into Hebrew= Even before publishing his own original poetry, Manor began submitting translations into Hebrew of 19th- century French poetry to the literary supplement of Ha'aretz, beginning with poems by Baudelaire. These translations were very well received, and led to Manor's publishing several volumes of translations between 1997 and 2017. Manor mainly translates verse, and publishes verse translations regularly in literary supplements (primarily Ha'aretz) and in the literary journal he is founding editor of, Ho!. As separate books, Manor published two volumes of poetry by Baudelaire ‚Äì a selection from Les Fleurs du Mal (1997), Le Spleen de Paris: Petits Po√®mes en prose (1997); a collection of Paul Val√©ry's poetry named le Cimeti√®re marin (2011); a collection of poems by Mallarm√© named le tonnerre muet (2012) ‚Äì all from French. In 2017, Manor published a volume of selected poems by Greek poet Cavafy, which he jointly translated with Israela Azulay, naming it Remember, Body. In prose, Manor translated Jean Echenoz's novel Je m'en vais (2001), Jules Verne's Le docteur Ox (2004), Voltaire's Candide (2006), Fran√ßoise Sagan's Bonjour Tristesse (2009), and Moli√®re's play l'Avare. Earlier on, Manor translated several non-fiction books, including Flaubert's Letters to Louise Colet (1999), Descartes's Meditations on First Philosophy (2001), Baudelaire's Les Paradis Artificiels (2003), and Raymond Aron's La Trag√©die alg√©rienne (2005).  Reception =Literary editing= In 1993, Manor founded, with fellow young poets Ori Pekelman and Gal Kober, a literary journal named Ev (Hebrew: ◊ê÷µ◊ë; a literary Hebrew word meaning a young plant's shoot), where they published original and translated poetry, as well as literary essays. The journal featured a distinct poetics favoring highly musical verse, and published mostly younger authors, including Shimon Adaf, Anna Herman, Eli Bar-Yahalom, Benny Mer, and Ayana Erdal. Three issues were published between 1993 and 1996, and the journal was discontinued when Pekelman and Manor moved to Paris to attend university. Despite its short life, its poetics were influential on a generation of poets. Literary scholar and critic Nissim Calderon credits Manor and Ev with directing his attention to musicality as the primary dimension of the changes of poetics in Hebrew poetry in the latter half of the 20th century. = Publishing and series editing = Between 2006 and 2012, Manor served as editor-in-chief of the book publishing department of Sal Tarbut Artsi, an Israeli state-funded art support program. Of his work as the person selecting titles for publication by the department, and working with the authors, he remarked in an interview: Music and radio Manor frequently collaborates with musicians, either in the context of setting his own poetry to music, or as a translator of lyrics, especially from French, to be performed in Hebrew. Notably, Manor worked with Israeli musician Shlomi Shaban, translating into Hebrew lyrics by Jacques Brel and Georges Brassens, as well as with musicians Yoni Rechter, Ninet Tayeb, Maor Cohen, and Rona Kenan. Between 2010 and 2015, Manor (with Shlomzion Kenan, and later with Rona Kenan) broadcast a weekly late-night radio program on the Israeli Galey Tzahal radio channel, called Tsipporey Layla Mitpaytot, a variant of the longstanding program Tsipporey Layla. The program featured songs, poems, and short passages around a theme, and was edited by Manor and his co-broadcasters.

They are one of the first trans women known to the general public in Tunisia.  Biography  Private life = Khookha comes from a conservative Tunisian family. After going through a severe depression, they left university and started their LGBT+ activism. They came out twice: once in regards to their sexual orientation, as a gay guy, before having their transition, and the second in 2015 in regards to their identity as a trans non-binary woman; thus starting to use the English pronouns They and Them and the feminine pronouns for French and Arabic, as well as their chosen name, Khookha McQueer. For them, although they identify as non binary and not as a woman, they still prefer using the feminine pronouns in french and arabic to express that part of their identity that was oppressed during a large part of their life. = Artistic work = They started their professional career as a graphic designer.. All of their work is shared on their official Instagram account. Their works deal with the question of identity and non-binarity. The artist also aims to show the challenges the Tunisian LGBT community face in a normative heterosexual and homophobic society according to what them. They accept that we qualify the work they produce as drag, but they consider themselves and their art work as a living experience whose parameter that changes with each product is the gender and its esthetic expression. They get a lot of their artistic inspiration from the Tunisian heritage, but their main muses remain the 1980s and 1990s divas from the Middle-East and Latin America such as Sherihan, Thal√≠a and Nawal Al Zoghbi. = Activism = In collaboration with Damj and Avocats Sans Fronti√®res organisations, Khookha participated in the creation of the first terminology guide on gender adapted to the Tunisian context. It gathers a large number of terms related to sexual orientation, identity and behavior, in the Tunisian dialect and in standard Arabic, including the different interpretations of each word in the local culture and context. Moreover, the activist wants to change the binary and patriarchal culture at the level of the language within the Tunisian community and the Arabic-speaking one in general, by proposing a sort of an alternative inclusive language that includes both of the female and masculine forms, and which she uses in all of their academic publications or on their social media through their columns and feminist narratives. They're known for their publications on the Arabic platform Jeem. For three years, Khookha was a member of a couple of LGBT+ organisations, like Mawjoudin, as a consultant for the trans members, before resigning. According to them, they were unable to stay with the rest of the community because of their political views that are seen as a bit avant- gardist.

Although overlapping considerably, landlessness is not a necessary condition of poverty. In modern capitalist societies, individuals may not necessarily privately own land yet still possess the capital to obtain an excess of what is necessary to sustain themselves, such as wealthy who live in expensive high-rise apartments in major urban centers. As such, landlessness may not exist as an immediate threat to their survival or quality of life. This minority of landless individuals have sometimes been referred to as the \\"landless rich.\\" However, for the majority of landless people, including the urban poor and those displaced into conditions of rural to urban migration, their condition of landlessness is also one of impoverishment, being without the capital to meet their basic necessities nor the land to grow their own food, keep animals, or sustain themselves. During times of economic prosperity in modern capitalist societies, the liabilities of landlessness may not be noticeable, especially to the wealthy, but during times of economic failure and rising unemployment, the liabilities of landlessness become more visible. Landlessness has since been identified as \\"one of the main causes of poverty amongst Indigenous peoples, particularly Indigenous women, making land rights critical to the alleviation of Indigenous poverty.\\" Indigenous people throughout the world have been displaced from their traditional lands as a result of settler colonialism, corporate imperialism, war, logging and mining, and even land conservation efforts, which has increased their social marginalization, lack of access to basic social services, and chronic poverty. According to colonial logics, Indigenous people were not able to exercise their territorial sovereignty. Indigenous peoples in the United States without a territory or a reservation, such as the Oklahoma Choctaws and the Winnemem Wintu, are nations without a land base, which affects their ability to assert sovereignty and self-determination while also leading directly to the loss of language, culture, and traditions.

It prefers to grow in relatively warmer, shadier, and wetter areas alongside streams, in openings in forests, or on rock piles, between 350 and 2,500m above sea level. It has been introduced to New England and can be found growing as a garden escapee elsewhere. Botanical illustration Description Rosa pendulina is a climbing (or rambling) shrub between 0.5 and 2m, rarely 3m tall. The flowers are typically semi-doubled and deep pink to fuchsia, brightening towards the center. It can be distinguished from other members of its genus by its relative lack of thorns (prickles), especially higher up on the plant, its oblong fruits (hips) which hang downwards (are pendulous, hence the specific epithet), its hispid peduncles and petioles, and its smooth stems and branches. The chromosome number is 2n = 28. Ripe hips Cultivation Often called by its synonym Rosa alpina, the Alpine rose has been in cultivation for hundreds of years (c.1683), with many varieties that are practically forgotten today. It has contributed genetically to an unknown, but large, number of extant rose cultivars. It flowers early, has a pleasing, strong fragrance, and is nearly thornless, all desirable traits for rose breeders. An undesirable trait is that it has weak pedicels supporting the flowers, which leads to the pendulous habit of the fruits. It is hardy to USDA Zone 4a. Varieties Numerous varieties (and even subspecies) were described for R. pendulina and R. alpina (see list of synonyms), but these have all been collapsed into R. pendulina. Hybrids Rosa pendulina is said to be the parent of a number of hybrids. *Rosa √ó anachoretica Schmidely (R. montana √ó R. pendulina)Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Botanique de Gen√®ve 7: 147. 1894 *Rosa √ó buseri Rouy (R. pendulina √ó R. sherardii)Fl.

A patch box is a patch storage compartment on muzzleloader guns, usually built into the stock or butt of a rifle.

Patches were usually pre-cut and pre- lubricated, with grease, tallow, or something similar, so they were ready when needed. The patch box kept the patches handy for loading. The lubricant allowed relatively easy and rapid ramming of the ball into the muzzle, while still transferring the twist from the rifling to the projectile.

Etymology The term \\"guariroba\\" originates from the Tupi word gwarai-rob, which means \\"the bitter one\\". Other common names include gueiroba, gueroba, gariroba, gairoba, palmito-amargoso, catol√©, coco-bab√£o, pati- amargoso, coco-amargoso, and coqueiro-amargoso. Description This elegant species has a tall, slender trunk and arched, feathery leaves. In Brazil, this is a very popular ornamental plant, and it is also cultivated to obtain its apical bud, with a somewhat bitter taste, and for its large fruits. The solitary, columnar tree reaches up to in height. It has large leaves up to long and flowers that appear in clusters during the spring until the autumn. Its slightly elliptical fruit, yellowish-green in color, whose mesocarp and oilseed kernel are edible, occurs in clusters between October and February. This palm is cultivated by seeds, although it grows spontaneously in the forests of the Midwest and Southeast of Brazil. It prefers warm weather and well-drained soil. Occurrence It is distributed throughout the semi- deciduous forests and the Cerrado of Brazil, and also found in the Caatinga biome. It has also been reported in Paraguay and Bolivia. Uses Among its products, the palm heart or terminal bud stands out. Considered by many as a bitter-flavored vegetable ‚Äî which in fact is when compared to sweet hearts of Atlantic Forest species ‚Äî the guariroba heart of palm is a delicacy of wide culinary use in some states, including some regions of Goi√°s and Minas Gerais. In the good recipes of empad√£o goiano, for example, it is essential to include good pieces of guariroba bitter heart of palm. Substantial food and very strong seasoning, the filling of this pie, together with guariroba, must contain pieces of chicken, preferably thighs, sausages, potatoes and whole boiled eggs or just broken in half and ripe tomatoes. It can also be used as a salad: with cherry tomatoes and plenty of seasoning. Edible oil is extracted from the seed. The plant is also widely used in landscaping in squares and mainly in central flowerbeds of streets and avenues in cities in the interior of Goi√°s, as an example in the city of Jata√≠ that over the years has been planting thousands of seedlings throughout the city.

The order topology is an important topology that is used frequently in the theory of ordered topological vector spaces because the topology stems directly from the algebraic and order theoretic properties of (X, ‚â§), rather than from some topology that X starts out having. This allows for establishing intimate connections between this topology and the algebraic and order theoretic properties of (X, ‚â§). For many ordered topological vector spaces that occur in analysis, their topologies are identical to the order topology.  Definitions  The family of all locally convex topologies on X for which every order interval is bounded is non-empty (since it contains the coarsest possible topology on X) and the order topology is the upper bound of this family. A subset of X is a neighborhood of 0 in the order topology if and only if it is convex and absorbs every order interval in X. Note that a neighborhood of 0 in the order topology is necessarily absorbing since [x, x] = { x } for all x in X. For every a ‚â• 0, let X_a = \\\\cup_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} n [-a, a] and endow Xa with its order topology (which makes it into a normable space). The set of all Xa's is directed under inclusion and if Xa ‚äÜ Xb then the natural inclusion of Xa into Xb is continuous. If X is a regularly ordered vector space over the reals and if H is any subset of the positive cone C of X that is cofinal in C (e.g. H could be C), then X with its order topology is the inductive limit of \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ X_a : a \\\\geq 0 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} (where the bonding maps are the natural inclusions). The lattice structure can compensate in part for any lack of an order unit: :Theorem: Let X be a vector lattice with a regular order and let C denote its positive cone. Then the order topology on X is the finest locally convex topology on X for which C is a normal cone; it is also the same as the Mackey topology induced on X with respect to the duality \\\\left\\\\langle X, X^{+} \\\\right\\\\rangle. In particular, if (X, \\\\tau) is an ordered Fr√©chet lattice over the real numbers then \\\\tau is the ordered topology on X if and only if the positive cone of X is a normal cone in (X, \\\\tau). If X is a regularly ordered vector lattice then the ordered topology is the finest locally convex TVS topology on X making X into a locally convex vector lattice. If in addition X is order complete then X with the order topology is a barreled space and every band decomposition of X is a topological direct sum for this topology.

Properties  Throughout we let (X, ‚â§) be an ordered vector space and we let ùúè‚â§ denote the order topology on X. * The dual of (X, ùúè‚â§) is the order bound dual Xb of X. * If Xb separates points in X (such as if (X, ‚â§) is regular) then (X, ùúè‚â§) is a bornological locally convex TVS. * Each positive linear operator between two ordered vector spaces is continuous for the respective order topologies. * Each order unit of an ordered TVS is interior to the positive cone for the order topology. * If the order of an ordered vector space X is a regular order and if each positive sequence of type l^1 in X is order summable, then X endowed with its order topology is a barreled space. * If the order of an ordered vector space X is a regular order and if for all x ‚â• 0 and y ‚â• 0 we have [0, x] + [0, y] = [0, x + y] then the positive cone of X is a normal cone in X when X is endowed with the order topology. ** In particular, the continuous dual space of X with the order topology will be the order dual X+. * If (X, ‚â§) is an Archimedean ordered vector space over the real numbers having an order unit and let ùúè‚â§ denote the order topology on X. Then (X, ùúè‚â§) is an ordered TVS that is normable, ùúè‚â§ is the finest locally convex TVS topology on X such that the positive cone is normal, and the following are equivalent: 1. (X, ùúè‚â§) is complete. 2.

Common examples of electronic monitoring of individuals under pre-trial or immigrant detention, house arrest, on probation or parole include: GPS wrist and ankle monitors, cellphones with biometric security systems, ignition interlock devices and automated probation check-in centers or kiosks.  Overview  GPS-based tracking system used for some individuals released from prison, jail or immigrant detention. According to a survey distributed by The Pew Charitable Trusts in December 2015, \\"the number of accused and convicted criminal offenders in the United States who are supervised with ankle monitors and other GPS-system electronic tracking devices rose nearly 140 percent over 10 years,\\" resulting in more than 125,000 people under electronic supervision in 2015, an increase from 53,000 in 2005. The federal government, the District of Columbia and all 50 states employ electronic devices to track and constrain the movements of pretrial defendants and convicts on probation or parole. GPS monitoring devices are most commonly used by law enforcement in Florida, Texas, California, Massachusetts, and Michigan. In 2020, approximately 4.5 million adults, twice the inmate population, were on probation or parole in what is commonly referred to as \\"community supervision,\\" although only two percent were electronically supervised as recently as 2015. Decarceration to E-Carceration  Shift in state budget priorities = Prison overcrowding in CA led to a 2011 court order to reduce the state prison population by 30,000 inmates. In the aftermath of decades-long tough on crime legislation that increased the US inmate population from 200,000 in 1973 to over two million in 2009, financially strapped states and cities turned to technology‚Äîwrist and ankle monitors‚Äîto reduce inmate populations as courts mandated inmate reductions in overcrowded prisons, and states realigned their budgets to address other priorities in education, housing and infrastructure. = Community control versus prison outsourcing = Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow. In response to the shift from brick and mortar carceral institutions to what law enforcement termed \\"community control\\" under electronic monitoring, an oppositional movement pushed back, describing a widening net of \\"mass incarceration to mass surveillance\\" that threatened privacy and individual freedom while reinforcing social stratification, disrupting an individual's connections to the community and resulting in a subgroup of second-class citizens in the U.S., where African Americans are imprisoned at nearly six times the rate of white people. Michelle Alexander, author and civil rights advocate, refers to electronic ankle monitoring practices as the ‚ÄúNewest Jim Crow,‚Äù increasingly segregating people of color under bail reform laws that \\"look good on paper\\" but are based on a presumption of guilt and replace bail with shackles as pre-trial detainees consent to electronic monitoring in order to be released from jail. \\"Entire communities could ‚Äúbecome trapped in digital prisons that keep them locked out of neighborhoods where jobs and opportunity can be found,\\" says Alexander, who advocates re-integration of individuals into the community via quality schools, jobs, drug treatment and mental health services as opposed to \\"high- tech management and control.\\" On the other hand, advocates of \\"community control\\" argue electronic monitoring is humane‚Äîsometimes allowing pretrial detainees, who have not been convicted yet but make up most of the local jail population, as well as offenders on probation and parole, an opportunity to live at home with their families, enjoying freedom to move from one room to the next rather than confined in a six-by-eight foot cell. Electronic monitoring, they argue, saves cash poor state valuable resources while benefitting offenders who can become productive. Says Ann Toyer of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, \\"We get them back into the community where they can work, they pay taxes, they have access to community services ... If we can get them back into the community, get them working, they can pay for those services.\\" In addition, proponents of electronic monitoring say the technology can be used to incapacitate violent criminals and reduce recidivism, though studies on the use of electronic monitors to reduce repeat offenses have produced mixed results.  EM as a Predictive Tool  Researchers anticipate electronic monitoring will be used to predict criminal behavior through software that tracks offenders' movements in a 24-hour period, tracing patterns to detect suspicious movements such as a convicted burglar driving around a neighborhood at the same time every day.  Types of Electronic Monitors  A GPS tracking device fastened to a person under house arrest. = Ankle and wrist monitors = Radio frequency (RF) ankle monitors are often used for curfew compliance with juveniles or individuals considered low risk for criminal behavior. In addition to wearing an ankle monitor, the individual sets up a separate home monitoring unit in his place of residence. The unit can be programmed to detect an ankle or wrist monitor within a short range of 50 to 150 feet in order to send a message to a staffed monitoring station. The supervising officer can establish a person's schedule, requiring the individual to follow a daily routine, and ensuring that alerts are sent when the individual veers from the schedule or tampers with the ankle monitor. Proponents of EM call this an \\"ankle bracelet,\\" while opponents refer to it as an \\"ankle shackle.\\" Higher risk offenders, such as sex offenders and domestic abusers, are more likely to wear a water and impact-resistant electronic monitoring (EM) device using global positioning satellites (GPS) for minute by minute tracking purposes. The GPS system triangulates communication between the individual user, the software and a supervising officer checking a monitor. The ankle device runs on batteries to be charged once or twice a day and utilizes commercial cellular networks to transmit data points and location information anywhere in the world. Probation officers can program and map exclusion zones, where individuals are prohibited from entering, lest they set off an alert to their probation officer and risk a technical violation of their probation. Exclusion zones for sex offenders may be day care centers or schools. Supervising officers can also program buffer zones within a certain radius of a prohibited area, so that if the monitored individual approaches an exclusion zone an alert sounds. Some ankle monitors are equipped to call and record people without warning. Others have microphones and speakers to record conversations that could be used in criminal cases, depending on state law. While active GPS tracking allows for triangulation in transmittal of information, passive GPS tracking stores data that can be downloaded for a future time. According to a study conducted by the East Bay Community Law Center of juveniles subjected to electronic monitoring in 58 California counties, any deviation from a daily schedule of school and work required the electronically monitored juvenile to seek permission from a supervising officer 24 hours to a week in advance of the schedule change. For adults under house arrest or other geographical restrictions, they may be prohibited from going grocery shopping, attending a child's school event, going to a beauty salon or washing clothes at a laundromat. African Americans are more likely than whites to choose prison over electronic monitoring, though reasons for the preference are unclear. Probation officers report African Americans view electronic monitoring as more restrictive than white people perceive it. Should an individual try to remove or succeed in removing an electronic device, consequences could include jail, prison time, fines or a tightening of the ankle monitor. A male going only by the name of Christopher told the Marshall Project, a non-profit news service focused on criminal justice, that he had to wear an ankle monitor from the time he was 13‚Äîwhen he grabbed a girl's behind in the hallway‚Äîuntil he was 18, after having committed violations of his probation. In describing the monitor, Christopher said,\\"It was a black box with thick straps, and it weighed 3 pounds, which made walking kind of hard. At first, they put it on me loose, not skin-tight, which meant it would slam around whenever I exercised. But then some kids, apparently, started slipping the thing off, and so they brought us all in for tightening; they cinched it up right against my skin. I couldn‚Äôt wear high-top shoes anymore. It dug into me. I still have the scar.\\" = Smartphones with biometric security systems = Proponents of using smartphones to track and constrain an individual through fingerprints, facial recognition and voice verification tout the cell phone's capability to integrate several features: Internet access; touchscreen interface; camera and video recording; location mapping and other applications. The tracking applications known as Smart-LINK and Shadowtrack may be installed on the individual's personal cellphone, referred to as a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), or integrated into a cell phone law enforcement buys or leases from a vendor and then assigns to an individual upon their release into the community. The American Probation and Parole Association (APPA) supports the use of smart phones for surveillance because the organization believes the cell phone, with its calendar feature, cuts down on technical violations in which an offender misses an appointment with a probation officer. Automobile ignition interlock device = Automobile ignition interlock device = The California Department of Motor Vehicles describes an automobile ignition interlock device (IID) as a device the size of a cell phone that is wired to your car or truck's' ignition to require an individual to offer a breath sample before the engine will start. If the sample is not satisfactory or indicates alcohol consumption, the engine will not ignite. Periodic breath samples are required during a driver's route to ensure the driver is not stopping to drink along the way. = SCRAM = Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitoring (SCRAM) in the form of a wrist band or hand-held device may be used to sample a client's breath and perspiration every 30 minutes to report blood alcohol level to a supervising officer. One SCRAM vendor advertises a \\"wireless, portable breath alcohol device with automated facial recognition and GPS with every single test.\\" = Automated Parole or probation check-in platforms = In the early 1990s, New York City piloted 16 automated probation check-in machines, also known as probation kiosks, with each $750,000 kiosk featuring a video screen, keypad and infrared scanner for low-risk offenders to answer questions as to whether they had been re-arrested, obtained a job or needed counseling. By 2004, after a budget- strained NYC deemed the kiosk program a success, reducing costs while freeing probation officers to meet personally with priority high-risk offenders, the automated check-in centers were instituted for 30,000 offenders. By 2015, 70% of the city's probation population was expected to use the automated kiosks.  Lists of arguments for and against EM  **Proponents of the use of electronic monitors to control individuals outside of carceral institutions argue the devices:< 1) are more cost-effective for states that can ill afford the high price of brick and mortar prisons and jails. 2) reduce recidivism. 3) allow individuals to maintain a family life and participate in treatment 4) can avert further victimization of innocent people. 5) ease prison overcrowding, improving the lives of inmates inside carceral institutions. 6) punish offenders without being too harsh 7) improve the lives of individuals who might otherwise languish in prison or jail **Opponents of the use of technology to control individuals outside of carceral institutions argue the devices: 1) fail to reduce recidivism and undermine rehabilitation by severing a person's ties to the community 2) result in frequent technical failures and false alarms that undermine the productivity of law enforcement 3) make it difficult for a person to hold a job and earn enough income to pay for a lawyer to obtain due process 4) worsen racial disparities, further marginalizing people of color who are disproportionately stigmatized 5) invade one's privacy 6) can harm a person's health, causing infections and irritations along with headaches and menstrual disruption 7) come with user fees that drain poor people of limited funds, sending an individual into spiraling debt  Evaluations: mixed  National Institute of Justice evaluation: Florida = A 2001 National Institute of Justice study of 5,000 medium- and high-risk offenders in Florida who were placed under electronic supervision found a 31% decrease in the recidivism rate over a six-year period when compared with 266,000 offenders under other types of community supervision. Researchers from Florida State University's Center on Criminology and Public Policy Research also concluded that electronic monitoring based on Global Positioning Systems (GPS) produced better results than radio frequency (RF) systems, but that electronic monitoring, regardless of type, had less of an impact on violent offenders than others. Researchers worked with the Florida Department of Corrections to interview local probation officers and over a hundred offenders. A majority of offenders said they felt ashamed to wear an electronic monitoring device and complained of stigmatization in a society in which ankle monitors are associated with sex criminals. Researchers interviewed one offender who described the electronic monitoring device as a \\"scarlet letter\\" of public humiliation, while another confided that each time the device's alarm went off, the offender thought the police were en route to make an arrest; still another worried about the message the ankle monitor sent to his child. \\"I‚Äôve got a child who straps a watch on his ankle to be like daddy.‚Äù = Center of Juvenile and Criminal Justice: Indiana = In a 2006-2009 Indiana study of 293 subjects from 18‚Äì71 years, divided into two groups, those who had completed the Electronic Monitoring House Detention (EMHD) program and those who had not, researchers found the \\"odds of one recidivating after their release were two times higher for those who had successfully completed the EMHD program compared to the subjects who hadn't completed the program. The study also showed, however, that older and more educated offenders had a lower recidivism rate. = National Institute of Justice evaluation: California = Background: Jessica's Law  In November 2006, California voters passed Proposition 83, a ballot initiative colloquially known as Jessica's Law, prohibiting sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of a school, day care center or park, as well as requiring all sex offenders to wear a GPS monitoring device for life. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) was responsible for program implementation: distribution and assignment of monitors. = Studies of sex offenders and gang members = In the mid to late 2000's, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) launched two pilot programs, one with sex offenders, the other with gang offenders, to evaluate the effectiveness of electronic monitors to reduce recidivism and encourage compliance with parole appointments. In the sex-offender study involving 516 offenders divided evenly into a treatment and control group, researchers concluded the GPS monitors worked: offenders under GPS supervision were three times less likely to commit a sex crime violation as those who were not electronically monitored but met with parole officers. In contrast, the gang study involving 392 offenders in a treatment group and 392 offenders in a control group concluded the odds of a technical violation were 36 percent greater among the gang offenders on electronic monitoring, though the GPS group was 26% less likely to be re-arrested than the group supervised by in- person parole officers. = Jefferson County, Kentucky = In 2000, researchers Robert Stanz and Richard Tewksbury studied a cohort of offenders sentenced to house arrest in Jefferson County, KY. A majority who completed the electronic monitoring program were also rearrested within 5 years after house arrest ended. Of the 85% of offenders who completed the program, 69% of them were rearrested relatively shortly after they were released. = Alcohol Ignition Interlock Devices = Researcher Beirness and Marques (2004) summarized evaluations of the effectiveness of AUD programs for those arrested for driving under the influence in the United States and Canada. The effectiveness of AUD's was temporary, lasting for the duration of the AUD installation. While interlocks during their installation reduced alcohol- impaired driving recidivism in half when compared to similar offenders without the interlocks, recidivism increased once the AUD's were removed, resulting in similar recidivism rates between those who did and those who did not have AUD's installed.  Electronically monitored immigrants  On July 18, 2018, in the middle of controversy over the Trump administration's family separation policy, National Public Radio (NPR) reported that during the Obama and Trump administrations Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had previously released 84,000 immigrants from detention centers to comply with a court order limiting family detention to three weeks. The released detainees were required to wear electronic ankle monitors or use smart phone check-in devices. The report compared the $320 per night cost of detaining an immigrant family in a detention center to the $14 per day cost of leasing an ankle monitor from the same company, GEO Group, that operates many of the detention centers. NPR reported that in an email exchange with ICE, a spokesperson for the federal agency said \\"alternatives to detention\\" (ATD's) had a near 100% percent chance success rate, though the news outlet qualified the success rate to apply to appearances for immigration hearings, as opposed to deportation orders which could be delayed for years due to court backlogs. Under the Trump administration, ICE cancelled another ATD, Family Case Management, a $36 dollar a day pilot project in which case workers in five cities steered approximately 1,000 migrants, often pregnant women or mothers, none of them electronically monitored, through the immigration court system, as well as schools, transportation and safe repatriation to their home country. The Inspector General reported a 99 percent compliance rate for ICE check-ins and appointments, and 100 percent success rate for court appearances. In 2018, a year that saw 400,000 migrants cycle through detention centers, ICE canceled the Family Case Management program, citing expense and failure to deport enough asylum seekers. That same year the Trump administration budgeted $57 million for electronic monitoring of migrants in what it called \\"intensive supervision programs.\\" In response to complaints about ankle monitors inflicting leg pain and stigmatizing immigrants, ICE Spokesman Bryan Cox told the Miami Herald, ‚Äúno one in ICE custody is required to wear an ankle monitor; however, when a custody determination is made based on the totality of the circumstances in any specific case, GPS monitoring may be required as a condition of release from custody.‚Äù = GPS and workplace raids = On August 24, 2019, the Miami Herald reported ICE‚Äîin a departure from the past‚Äîhad gathered data from immigrants' GPS ankle monitors to locate workplaces employing migrant labor and then raid those workplaces, arresting nearly 700 employees earlier that month at seven Mississippi food processing plants in what was described as the \\"biggest single-day, one-state sweep in U.S. history.\\" = COVID-19 EM releases = During the COVID-19 pandemic, ICE released more detainees, many with electronic ankle monitors, to avoid further outbreaks in crowded detention facilities where to \\"increase social distancing, detainees are locked in their cells for as long as 23 hours a day.\\" In April 2020, the inmate population at ICE detention centers dropped from a daily average of 50,000 to 32,300 people, the lowest number of detainees during the Trump administration.  Economics  Individual fees = The U.S government assumes the cost of electronic monitors for some federal prisoners and detainees, though states and cities often require an individual wearing an electronic monitor to pay rental and battery fees, which for James Brooks, an Alameda County, CA. resident arrested for driving under the influence, led him to file a class action lawsuit against the county and its private electronic monitoring contractor. Brooks sued them for allegedly extorting him, threatening to send him back to jail if he didn't pay his electronic monitoring fees, which ran as high as $13 a day or $400 per month with an enrollment fee of $150.00 and a default charge of $25.50 per day. Rental fees for ankle monitoring can range from $5 to $25 per day. In Kentucky, law enforcement can put an individual back in jail after missing three payments. While some probation offices and county law enforcers operate their own electronic monitoring programs ‚Äî renting the ankle monitors from manufacturers, hiring employees and collecting money from the person monitored, others, like Alameda County, have outsourced oversight of defendants, parolees and probationers to private for-profit companies. One suburb north of Seattle, MountLake Terrace, reportedly profits off ankle monitoring, charging the individual monitored far more than the cost of the private contract fees, netting the suburb an extra $50,000 per year. = Federal, state and local savings = In 2012 the Urban Institute of the District of Columbia Crime Policy Institute compared the costs of incarcerating an individual in a brick and mortar institution with electronic monitoring. The Institute found that EM reduced costs to local agencies‚Äîcounties, law enforcement‚Äîby an average of $580 per individual, while saving the federal government $920 per individual. In 2014, the American Correctional Association estimated the cost of EM was $35.96 per day compared to $129 per night in a prison or jail. = EM as a business = According to the Center for Media Justice, a few large corporations ‚Äî among them the GEO Group, one of the largest for-profit detention center operators ‚Äî generate annual revenue of $200 million providing electronic monitoring devices for people on parole or probation in 30 states. Another company, Libre by Nexus, will post a cash bond to release an immigrant from detention, and then upon release charge the individual a daily fee to wear the company's electronic device, the price of which does not defray the cost of the bond. Securus, the country's largest prison telephone service, sold for $1.5 billion in 2017 to Platinum Equity, operates several electronic monitoring companies.  History time-line  Harvard University, site of early experiments with electronic monitoring of juveniles. 1960s: Harvard University conducts a volunteer experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of GPS tracking devices to encourage \\"pro-social non-criminal\\" behavior among juveniles. Motivated by behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner's experiments on the power of positive reinforcement with rats, graduate student researchers, mounting a main base- station atop the roof of Old Cambridge Baptist Church, apply a portable electronic tag or behavior transmitter-reinforcer to send data two-ways between a base station and volunteer young adult offenders. To evaluate the rehabilitative efficacy of wearing a monitoring device on the wearer's belt, messages were relayed to the subject's electronic tag as positive reinforcement when an acting young offender arrived on time to a specified place‚Äîschool, workplace, drug treatment center. Reinforcement, designed to improve the odds of rehabilitation, came in the form of rewards, such as free haircuts, slices of pizza and tickets to concerts ‚Äî all to motivate the \\"offenders\\" to comply with expected norms of behavior. Critics of the use of technology to track offenders charged it would make \\"automatons out of our parolees\\" and in the words of a newspaper editor, \\"the parole officer of the future will be an expert in telemetry, sitting at his large computer, receiving calls day and night, and telling his parolees what to do in all situations and circumstances [...] Perhaps we should also be thinking about using electronic devices to rear our children.\\" In his defense, Robert Gable, one of the designers of the experiment, writes, \\"... the original goal of electronic monitoring was not to punish offenders but to provide a means of rewarding prosocial, noncriminal behavior.\\" 1973: The military launches the first GPS project to improve existing navigation systems. In a Spiderman cartoon, a villain slaps a \\"radar wrist\\" on the superhero. 1980s: Following a tragic airline accident, the Reagan administration announces GPS will also be available for civilian use. Meanwhile, Jack Love, a New Mexico State judge embraces EM technology after viewing a Spiderman cartoon in which the antagonist slaps a \\"radar device\\" on Spiderman. Love pitches EM to technology companies, leading to the production of the first transmitter unit, the size of a cigarette package, to be attached to an ankle. 1990: All 50 states employ radio-frequency (RF) technologies to varying degrees to monitor and track individuals, such as sex offenders. New York City pilots automated probation check-in centers. 2009: An estimated 44,000 tracking monitors are deployed in the United States. California electronically monitors high-risk gang members' violations of exclusion zones to reveal previously unknown gang networks. Michigan and Massachusetts use EM to track domestic abusers, and at least two companies introduce systems allowing the victim's location to constitute a mobile exclusion zone off limits to offenders. 2010: 33 states pass legislation mandating released sex offenders wear electronic monitoring devices. Some states and counties also employ EM to track domestic abusers or inform former victims when offenders are released from prison. 2012: U.S. Supreme Court rules in United States v. Jones, law enforcement must obtain a probable-cause warrant to place a GPS tracker on a car. 2018: Parents worried about their teens running away or taking drugs turn to a Florida company to attach ankle monitors to their children. The U.S. Supreme Court rules in Carpenter versus the United States \\"police must obtain a warrant to access cell site location data from a cell phone company, 2019: North Carolina Supreme Court rules in State of North Carolina v. Torrey Grady that states cannot subject convicted sex offenders to lifetime electronic monitoring because the surveillance violates the individual's Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search. 2020: A Kentucky judge orders house arrest and ankle monitors for Louisville residents who refuse to quarantine after COVID-19 exposure.

Then the topological vector lattice's positive cone C is a strict \\\\mathcal{B}-cone, where C is a strict \\\\mathcal{B}-cone means that \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left[ B \\\\right]_{C} : B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} is a fundamental subfamily of \\\\mathcal{B} (i.e. every B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B} is contained as a subset of some element of \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left[ B \\\\right]_{C} : B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}). If a topological vector lattice X is order complete then every band is closed in X.  Examples  The Banach spaces L^p\\\\left( \\\\mu \\\\right) (1 \\\\leq p \\\\leq \\\\infty) are Banach lattices under their canonical orderings. These spaces are order complete for p < \\\\infty.

He then studied with L√©on Bonnat in Paris, and worked in the studios of Eug√®ne Carri√®re. He also collaborated with L√©on Carr√©, Charles Dufresne and L√©on Cauvy. In 1909, he was awarded the Abd-el-Tif prize. From 1909 to 1911, and again from 1912 to 1924, he travelled throughout Algeria; being best remembered for his scenes portraying the people and places of Kabylie and his studies of Moorish culture. His work was interrupted from 1914 to 1918, when he served in the French Army, and there is a distinct difference in his pre- and post-war styles; the latter being more subtle. After 1925, his health began to decline, and he became increasingly dissatisfied with his work. He committed suicide in 1929; leaving a note that said \\"J'ai tout sacrifi√© √† l'art, il me tue\\" (I sacrificed everything to art, it has killed me\\").

She is best known for her autobiographical novel Looking Like the Enemy: My Story of Imprisonment in Japanese American Internment Camps, which details her own experiences as a Japanese American in World War II internment camps. BiographyEarly life= Gruenewald was born in 1925 in Washington to Heisuke and Mitsuno Matsuda, Japanese immigrants and farmers. She and her brother grew up in the small community of Vashon Island under idyllic circumstances. Her family owned a strawberry farm and attended a local Methodist congregation. =Internment experience= Upon learning about the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, her family destroyed their Japanese possessions. In May 1942, she and her family left their home and were placed in a series of camps, starting with Pinedale Assembly Center and progressing through Tule Lake and Heart Mountain. She graduated from high school during camp. In September 1944, after transferring her parents to Minidoka to be closer to friends from Washington state, she left to join the Cadet Nurse Corps in Clinton, Iowa. =Postwar life= After the war, Gruenewald lived in Seattle and worked in the nursing field. She met and married Charles Gruenewald, a minister. During the post-war years, she was reticent to discuss or write stories about her wartime experiences. However, in 1999, she decided to write down her experiences, primarily so that her children would know the details of her experience. These were published in 2005 as Looking Like the Enemy: My Story of Imprisonment in Japanese American Internment Camps. Gruenewald was 80 years old at the time.

The tramp steamer Alum Chine exploded while loading dynamite, killing 33 and injuring 60. Incident The 1767-ton freighter Alum Chine was built in 1905. On March 7, 1913 it was loading of dynamite bound for the Panama Canal near Fort Carroll in the outer portion of Baltimore Harbor, when, at about 10:00 in the morning. smoke appeared from the ship's hold. The crew and stevedores who had been loading from a barge attempted to flee, assisted by the tug Atlantic, but the Alum Chine exploded at 10:30. The explosion of the ship and the dynamite remaining on the barge killed 33 near and aboard the Alum Chine, including several aboard the Atlantic and the nearby U.S. Navy collier Jason. Debris was found over a radius. The Baltimore Quarantine Hospital at Wagner's Point lost all of its windows, and the concussion was said to have been felt in Philadelphia and Atlantic City. Aftermath At the inquest into the incident, suspicion fell on the assistant foreman of the stevedores loading the ship, William J. Bomhardt, who was arrested on suspicion that he had struck a box of dynamite with a bale hook, causing the box to explode and leading to the eventual larger explosion. A theory was advanced during the inquest that the dynamite, which had been frozen for loading, was starting to thaw and form blisters of nitroglycerine. Despite testimony from an explosives expert that such an action would not cause an explosion, and that the more likely cause was fire in the ship's coal bunker, the jury found Bomhardt responsible for the explosion. Debris attributed to the Alum Chine was found during construction of the Fort McHenry Tunnel under Baltimore Harbor.

In 1906, he served as Secretary of the Minister of Finance of the Dominican Republic and joined the government of American-occupied Cuba. He was appointed to the Advisory Law Commission, selected to design the new Cuban legal code. In 1909, Schoenrich returned to Puerto Rico, where he assumed the office of District Judge of Mayag√ºez. In 1911, he became president of the Managua-based Nicaraguan Mixed Claims Commission. After working for one year as a district judge in Humacao, Puerto Rico, he moved to New York City in 1916, where he joined the law firm Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle as a partner. Schoenrich acted as an intermediary between the American and Greek governments in 1929 and 1934. = Memberships = Schoenrich was a staunch supporter of the Republican Party and held memberships in the American Society of International Law, the American Academy of Political and Social Science, the American Foreign Law Association, the Peruvian American Association, and the Pan American Society of the United States. = Honors = * Order of the Southern Cross * National Order of Honor and Merit, the highest order of the state of Haiti * Honorary Professor of Law, Universidad Aut√≥noma de Santo Domingo * Honorary Doctorate in Social Sciences and Public Law, University of Havana  Writings  * \\"Former Senator Burton's trip to South America, 1915\\",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26289733-former-senator-burton-s- trip-to-south-america-1915 in Publication (Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

The team competes in the three major annual inter-county competitions; the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, the Munster Senior Hurling Championship and the National Hurling League. Waterford's home grounds are Walsh Park, Waterford, and Fraher Field, Dungarvan. The team's manager is Derek McGrath. The team last won the Munster Senior Championship in 2010, the All-Ireland Senior Championship in 1959 and the National League in 2015. HistoryEarly Days (1886‚Äì1935)= The Waterford County Board was established in 1886 in Kilmacthomas and played in the Munster Championship for the first time in 1888, losing to Cork on a score of 2‚Äì8 to 0-0. The next fourteen years would consist of walkovers, first round defeats and not entering the competition at all. Waterford would finally win a championship match for the first time in 1903, defeating Kerry by 5‚Äì6 to 2‚Äì9. In their first Munster final, which did not take place until 1904, Waterford would lose to Cork. The following years led to another series of opening Munster championship match defeats and the occasional walkover, and Waterford would not win another senior championship match until 1925 when Clare were defeated, only for Tipperary to beat them in only their second Munster final. Despite its present reputation as a hurling stronghold, football was initially the preferred Gaelic sport in Waterford: the county was one of only nine to compete in the inaugural All-Ireland football championship in 1887. At this stage, Waterford was still the only county in Munster not to have won the provincial or All-Ireland hurling title, but there were signs of improvement. The minor hurlers reached the first ever Munster final in 1928, losing to Cork. They would make up for this defeat the following year against Tipperary and would defeat Meath in the All-Ireland final. The junior hurlers secured the county's first ever adult silverware in 1931, winning both the Munster and All-Ireland titles. They would repeat this feat in 1934. At senior level, the county was edging ever closer to Munster success, with the 1931 team drawing with Cork in the final only to lose the replay by 15 points. A fifth Munster final appearance ended when the match against Limerick was abandoned due to crowd encroachment late on with Limerick leading by 11 points. The title was awarded to Limerick, who would defeat Waterford again in the 1934 decider. =Golden Age (1936‚Äì1963)= The junior hurlers won the county's third Munster and All-Ireland double at that level in 1936, and the senior hurlers, after those near misses at the start of the decade, were ready to secure the Munster title. An 11-point win over Cork in the 1938 Munster semi-final saw Waterford into their seventh Munster final, where they defeated Clare by 3‚Äì5 to 2‚Äì5. They reached the county's first ever All-Ireland final after an easy win over Galway, where they went down to Dublin in Croke Park by 2-5 (11) to 1-6 (9). The following year, Waterford played in their first National Hurling League final, losing to Dublin by 1-8 (11) to 1-4 (7). If Limerick had proven to be Waterford's nemesis in the 1930s, defeating Waterford again in 1940 on their way to another All-Ireland, the 1940s belonged to Cork who would win the All- Ireland four years running from 1941 to 1944 and again in 1946, defeating Waterford in 1943, 1946 and 1947. By 1948 though, Waterford's time had finally come. Defeating Clare by two points in the Munster semi-final, the margin was even narrower in the Munster final against Cork, Waterford prevailing by a score of 4-7 (19) to 3-9 (18). Galway were overcome in the All-Ireland semi- final, and Dublin ‚Äì containing RT√â broadcaster Se√°n √ìg √ì Ceallach√°in in the half-forward line ‚Äì were well beaten, on a score of 6-7 (25) to 4-2 (14). Waterford had won the Liam MacCarthy Cup at last. To add to the joy of 1948, the Minor team would win the county's second Munster and All-Ireland titles, defeating Tipperary (3-6 to 0-3) and Kilkenny (3-8 to 4-2) respectively. Limerick relieved Waterford of their titles in the first defence in 1949, defeating them by five points in the Munster semi-final. The early 1950s saw Waterford come up against Tipperary and Cork teams at the peak of their powers, and Waterford would not reach another Munster final until 1957. By this time, Waterford had the nucleus of a team that would contest hurling's major prizes with Tipperary and Kilkenny for the next six years. A close fought victory over Limerick in the semi-final (4-12 to 5-5) saw Waterford into the Munster final where they defeated a Cork team shorn of Christy Ring due to injury on a score of 1-11 (14) to 1-6 (9). Galway were once again defeated in the semi-final, and Kilkenny waited in the final. The game had a few unusual events. Kilkenny paraded around the pitch with sixteen players as British actor John Gregson was being recorded for his role in the film Rooney. The game saw Amhr√°n na bhFiann being played at the start of the second half as the referee threw the ball in to start the game before the Artane Boys Band had started the anthem. Waterford led the match 1‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì5 at half-time and had extended that lead to six points with ten minutes to go, but Kilkenny overtook Waterford with two goals and a point to leave them winners on a score of 4-10 (22) to 3-12 (21). 1958 was the first year Waterford won through to the Munster final having won it the previous year, a win over Kerry setting up the shot at a repeat victory. However, Tipperary were convincing winners on a score of 4-12 (24) to 1-5 (8). Tipperary would also defeat Waterford in the county's second National Hurling League final appearance in 1959 by seven points. Galway were the first opponents in that year's Munster championship, and the Tribesmen were well beaten, 7-11 (32) to 0‚Äì8. Tipperary were waiting in the semi-final, where they choose to play against a stiff first-half breeze. Waterford took full advantage of this, scoring 8‚Äì2 in the first half without reply, and eventually winning 9-3 (30) to 3-4 (13). The county's fourth Munster title was secured with a three-point win over Cork in Thurles. In the All-Ireland final, Kilkenny would make life difficult for Waterford with a string of goals, and with minutes remaining Waterford found themselves in the incredible position of having outscored Kilkenny by seven yet still being three points behind. But Seamus Power's late goal ensured a draw, 1‚Äì17 to 5-5. Waterford did not repeat those mistakes in the replay, securing the county's second All-Ireland title, 3-12 (21) to 1-10 (13). Tipperary got their revenge in the 1960 Munster semi-final for the remarkable scoreline the previous year, and they continued to make life hard for Waterford in 1961, beating Waterford in that year's League final by 6-6 (24) to 4-9 (21). Cork defeated Waterford in the 1961 Munster championship, and while wins over Clare and Cork saw Waterford into the 1962 final, Tipperary hammered Waterford by 20 points to secure a third successive Munster title. The 1963 League final against Tipperary ‚Äì the 'Home' final as the winners were due to meet New York for the title proper ‚Äì was much closer, with Waterford winning an eventful match by 2-15 (21) to 4‚Äì7. There was to be no such free-scoring the 1963 Munster final though (reached after a six-point in over Limerick in the semi- final), Waterford edging a tense affair by 0‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì8, a result that would be Tipperary's only senior championship defeat between 1961 and 1965, effectively denying them a 'five-in-a-row'. In the All-Ireland final, Kilkenny were inspired by a 14-point haul from Eddie Keher to a 4-17 (29) to 6-8 (26) victory. There was some consolation for Waterford in the National Hurling League final 'proper', where after a scare in a drawn first game (3-6 to 3-6) Waterford won the replay against New York by 3-10 (19) to 1-10 (13). =Dark Times (1964‚Äì1997)= It would not have seemed likely in 1964 that Waterford would not win another senior title for nearly fifty years. The county remained competitive in the mid 1960s, narrowly losing out to Cork in 1964 and only losing to the same opposition in 1965 after a replay. But a young Cork team, containing several of the team that would win that year's Under-21 hurling championship, defeated Waterford in the 1966 Munster final. Despite gaining their revenge in the first round of the 1967 Munster championship, Waterford were beginning to struggle. Defeat followed in the Munster semi-final to Tipperary, and Waterford would not win another championship match until 1974. 1974 was a brighter year for Waterford, as the seniors shocked Cork in the first round of the Munster championship, and were only beaten by one point by defending All-Ireland champions Limerick in the semi-final. John Galvin won the county's first All Star award. The county also secured its first ever victory in the Munster Under-21 championship, defeating Clare by 2-5 (11) to 1-3 (6) in the final. Antrim were well beaten in the semi-final to set up another All-Ireland final against Kilkenny, only to see Kilkenny come out winners by a narrow margin once again, 3-8 (17) to 3-7 (16). However, 1974 was a brief respite on a downward slide for Waterford hurling. A Cork team about to embark on a three-in-a-row of All-Ireland success hammered Waterford by 22 points in the first round in 1975, and the only county Waterford would beat in the Munster championship over the following six years was Kerry. The only bright spot at senior inter-county level would be Mossy Walsh's All Star award in 1980. Mount Sion would also win the county's first Munster club title, defeating South Liberties of Limerick in the final. James Stephens of Kilkenny would defeat Mount Sion by 3-13 (22) to 3-8 (17) in the All-Ireland final. 1982 was the beginning of one of the blackest periods in Waterford's hurling history. An unbeaten run in the league stage of the National League was ended only after a replay in the semi-final by Kilkenny, and a one-point over defending Munster champions Limerick in the semi-final raised hopes that a 23-year wait for Munster success was about to come to an end. But in their first Munster final appearance since 1966, Waterford were humiliated by Cork, losing by 5-31 (46) to 3-6 (15). There was individual reward in the form of All Star awards for Jim Greene and John Galvin (his second), but the disappointment of that year was compounded in 1983. Having overcome a young Tipperary side seeking their county's first championship win in eight years, Waterford were back in the Munster final only to be crushed by Cork again, 3-22 (31) to 0-12. The Centenary year saw relegation to Division Two of the National Hurling League, a quarter-final defeat by Galway in the Centenary Cup and a one-point defeat by Clare in the Munster championship. Waterford would have to wait until 1989 to win another championship match, a period which would see them relegated to Division Three of the National Hurling League. Waterford would return immediately to Division Two and reach successive League semi-finals in 1987 and 1988, where they were heavily defeated by Galway and Tipperary respectively. 1989 would see a revival in Waterford's fortunes as Clare were beaten by 15 points in the Munster first round then Cork were overcome in the semi-final after two eventful matches. Having let a lead slip in the first game to draw 0-18 each, Waterford reached the Munster final with a two-point win. However, the final was a reminder of those grim days in the early 1980s. Waterford had two players sent off as they slumped to a 0‚Äì26 to 2-8 (14) defeat in the 100th Munster final against Tipperary. Cork would end Waterford's interest in the next two championships by a large margin (17 points in 1990) and a small margin (three points in 1991). =Modern Revival (1992‚Äì2001)= The 1992 Munster Senior Hurling Championship was a relatively good one for the seniors, defeating Clare after a replay and only losing by three points to Limerick in the semi-final. It was the underage sides though that would provide Waterford with its best year in nearly three decades. The minor hurlers, playing in their first Munster final since 1968, needed a last minute Paul Flynn goal to secure a draw, Waterford's 4‚Äì7 to Tipperary's 3-10. Between that drawn game and the replay, the Under-21s defeated a Ger Loughnane-managed Clare team by 0‚Äì17 to 1-12 (15). The jubilation had barely subsided from that win before the Minors defeated Tipperary in the replay, 2‚Äì10 to 0-14. With victories in each grade over Antrim in the semi-finals, a new generation of Waterford fans got to visit Croke Park for the first time. The Minor final ended in a disappointing defeat by Galway, 1-13 (16) to 2-4 (10). The Under-21 final against Offaly was staged a few weeks later in Nowlan Park, Kilkenny. 0‚Äì9 to 0-4 down at half-time, a second half hat-trick of goals from Se√°n Daly kept Waterford in touch before a late goal from Paul Flynn looked to have secured victory for Waterford. Two late Offaly points ensured a replay on a final score of 4‚Äì4 to 0-16. The replay once again had Offaly in front at half-time, 2-3 (9) to 0‚Äì6. Waterford held their opponents scoreless in the second half and a late flurry of points secured a 0‚Äì12 to 2-3 (9) victory and a first ever All-Ireland Under-21 hurling championship title. The progress represented by these underage successes was interrupted in the first round of the Munster championship in 1993 as Kerry won in Walsh Park by 4-13 (25) to 3-13 (22), the Kingdom's first senior hurling championship win since 1926. The next few years would be frustratingly unfulfilling for a county expecting great things after the events of 1992. A narrow defeat by Limerick in 1994 was followed by a big defeat in 1995 to Tipperary, a year which saw another heavy National League semi-final defeat by a Clare team on its way to a first All-Ireland success in 81 years with much of the team beaten by the Under-21s in 1992. The Under 21s had also beaten Clare in the 1994 Munster final, before losing by 2-21 (27) to 3-6 (15) in an unusual Munster-Leinster all-Ireland semi-final pairing. The minors reached three finals in a row between 1994 and 1996, but were well beaten in each one. A close loss to Tipperary in Walsh Park in the 1996 Munster semi-final suggested there might be life in the 1992 generation. The appointment of former Cork All-Ireland winning trainer Gerald McCarthy as Waterford manager was seen as a statement of intent on the part of the County Board. A poor first half performance cost them dear in the first round against Limerick in 1997, but the introduction of the hurling ‚Äòback door‚Äô gave Waterford extra incentive to perform well in the 1998 championship, especially with a relatively kind draw in Munster. An excellent run in the National League saw Waterford reach their first final since 1963, laying the semi-final hoodoo with a five-point win over Limerick. A tight match in the final saw Cork pull away for a flattering win by 2-14 (20) to 0-13. The morale that had been raised on the back of that run in the League was nearly squandered as Waterford needed a late flurry of point to secure an even more flattering eight points win against Kerry. Despite this, confidence was high going into a semi-final that, due to the Munster finalists being guaranteed a place in the All-Ireland series, had an extra frisson of tension. The Waterford hurlers did not disappoint, securing a 0‚Äì21 to 2-12 (18) win over Tipperary. Waterford were back in the Munster final and heading for Croke Park. The 1998 Munster final was memorable on many levels. On a windy day in Thurles, Waterford struggled to keep in touch with Clare, All- Ireland champions for two of the previous three years, but when Paul Flynn fired a free to the net with the match entering injury time to level the scores, Waterford had a golden opportunity to win it from a 100-metre free. Flynn's effort drifted wide but the replay was much anticipated by a crowd enthralled by the draw. The replay was an unpleasant affair, a chaotic throw- in eventually leading to the suspension of Clare hurler Colin Lynch, a decision that would leave much bad feeling between the two counties, and the sending off of Brian Lohan and Micheal White early in the game set the tone for the match itself. Clare would eventually run out comprehensive 2-16 (22) to 0-10 winners, and Waterford had to play Galway in the All-Ireland quarter- finals a week later. On the back of two hard matches on the previous Sundays, Waterford were underdogs against Galway. But Waterford dominated from start to finish, ending up easy winners by 1-20 (23) to 1-10 (13). This set up a first championship meeting with Kilkenny in 35 years, and a low-scoring game saw Waterford battle back from being six points down midway through the second half to only lose by a point. Incredibly, Waterford had scored five more points over the course of their four championship ties with Kilkenny, yet the record was 3‚Äì1 to the Cats. The season ended with Tony Browne winning his first All Star and also the Hurler of the Year award. Expectations were once again high in Waterford in 1999. They seemed to be justified when they secured a narrow one-point win over Limerick, their first win over Limerick since 1982. Waterford found themselves in the unusual position of being favourites against Cork, but a poor Waterford effort and a spectacular eight points from play from Michael O'Connell in the Cork midfield left Waterford losers on a score of 0‚Äì24 to 1-15 (18). Another good run in the 2000 National Hurling League ended once again in the semi-finals, this time to Galway, and Waterford went out of the Munster championship with a whimper, beaten 0‚Äì17 to 0-14 by Tipperary. The Gerald McCarthy era, which had promised so much, ended in a cruel manner against Limerick in 2001. Waterford raced into a 2-6 (12) to 0‚Äì1 lead after 15 minutes, but Limerick hung in and scored three goals in the last ten minutes to break Waterford's resistance, winning in the end by 4-11 (23) to 2-14 (20). =Munster breakthrough (2002‚Äìpresent)=2002 It was with this unpromising setup that another former All-Ireland winner with Cork, Justin McCarthy became manager. An unremarkable League performance did not suggest Waterford were ready to topple Cork, but despite having a five-point second half lead eroded to nothing late in the game, Waterford held their nerve to score a late point from Ken McGrath and a 1-16 (19) to 1-15 (18) victory. The reigning Munster and All-Ireland champions Tipperary were warm favourites in the Munster final that followed. A spectacular display of shooting from Waterford gave the D√©ise a 2-23 (29) to 3-12 (21) victory that was more impressive than the final margin of eight points suggested. Waterford were confident of adding the All-Ireland crown to this first Munster title in 39 years. Despite a flying start in the semi-final against Clare, they eventually faded to lose by three points. The season was still a success from a Waterford perspective, and Fergal Hartley, Eoin Kelly and Ken McGrath were selected for All Star awards. 2003 Waterford began the defence of their sixth Munster title with an easy win over Kerry before meeting Limerick a match where, unusually among modern GAA championship matches, no cameras were present due to a fire safety issue at Thurles, thus ensuring only those who were there got to enjoy a thrilling tie, with Waterford as in 2001 racing into an early lead only to be hauled back by Limerick. The match ended level, 4-13 (25) each, but the televised replay was an anti-climax, with Waterford hanging on for a 1-13 (16) to 0‚Äì14 victory. The Munster final against Cork featured a hat-trick of goals from a player on the losing team, in this case John Mullane of Waterford. They had failed to make a first half breeze count and, despite the heroics from Mullane, Cork won by four points, 3-16 (25) to 3-12 (21). John Mullane's performance would be pivotal in him securing Waterford's sole All Star for the year, as the season petered out in the All- Ireland series with a disappointing 1-20 (23) to 0‚Äì18 defeat in Waterford's first ever championship match with Wexford. 2004 The 2004 National League saw Waterford reach their seventh final, secured by finishing top of a second phase of group games thanks to a late equalising point from Paul Flynn against Tipperary. There was more disappointment though as Galway were convincing 2-15 (21) to 1-13 (16) winners. To regain the Munster title, Waterford were going to have to do it the hard way by beating Clare and Tipperary just to reach the final. A measure of revenge for 1998 was secured against Clare as Waterford sensationally trounced the Banner County by 3-21 (30) to 1-8 (11), a performance illuminated by a hat-trick of goals from Dan Shanahan. The semi-final was a much tighter affair, with a late goal from sub Paul O'Brien needed to beat Tipperary by 4-10 (22) to 3-12 (21). The final against Cork was hailed to be one of the best Munster finals with a match that ebbed and flowed turned on an audacious dipping medium range free from Paul Flynn that surprised the Cork backs for a goal. Waterford secured their seventh Munster title with one point, 1-21 (24) to 3-16 (25), win. The All- Ireland semi-final saw another clash with Kilkenny and another three-point defeat, a first-half salvo of three goals giving Waterford a mountain that proved too difficult to climb. Gallingly for Waterford, Kilkenny had come through the All-Ireland series, and would lose out in the final to Cork who themselves had come through the 'back door'. Paul Flynn's tally of 0‚Äì13 against Kilkenny would copperfasten his first All Star award, with Dan Shanahan getting his first and Ken McGrath winning his second, only the second Waterford man after John Galvin to win multiple All Stars. 2005‚Äì06 For the most part, 2005 and 2006 saw Waterford go backwards under Justin McCarthy. A narrow defeat by Cork in the Munster semi-final left Waterford in a round robin group in the All-Ireland qualifiers, where facile wins over Dublin and Offaly were rendered moot by a 4-14 (26) to 0‚Äì21 defeat by Clare in the final group match in Ennis. This left Waterford with a more difficult quarter-final against Cork, in which stout Waterford resistance was ended five minutes from the end by a Brian Corcoran goal, Cork eventually winning by 1-18 (21) to 1-13 (16). An eight-point defeat by Tipperary in the 2006 Munster championship, Waterford's largest championship defeat in eight years, suggested Waterford were in decline, but a 1-25 (28) to 2-20 (26) win over Galway in the qualifiers, allied with comfortable wins over Westmeath and Laois, gave Waterford another shot at Tipperary in the quarter-finals. This time they took their second chance, surviving a late Tipperary rally to win by 1-22 (25) to 3-13 (22). Cork stood between Waterford and the final, and another tension- filled match saw Cork overhaul Waterford in the last ten minutes. Waterford kept in touch to the point where a late Ken McGrath free from his own half could have given Waterford a draw, but Cork goalkeeper Donal √ìg Cusack took the risk of blocking the ball from going over the bar and Cork held on for a one-point win. Eoin Murphy won his first All Star award, while Dan Shanahan and Tony Browne both won their second award, Browne his first in eight years. 2007 Justin McCarthy secured another year in charge on the back of the performance in 2006, and after an indifferent run in the group stages of the 2007 National League which saw Waterford just qualify for the quarter-finals, there was little to suggest a successful year. But tight wins over Tipperary and Cork saw Waterford into another League final, and with the scores level going into injury time in the final against Kilkenny, two late points gave Waterford a 0‚Äì20 to 0‚Äì18 victory and only their second National League title. Waterford's winning ways continued with a three-point win over Cork in the Munster semi-final in a game overshadowed by the suspension of three Cork players in a brawl that took place before their first round win over Clare. In the final against Limerick, Dan Shanahan scored three second-half goals as Waterford won the Munster title for the eighth time. The Intermediate hurling team also won the Munster title for the very first time, although they would eventually lose to Wexford in the All-Ireland final. A shock loss by Cork at the hands of Tipperary in the qualifiers meant Waterford had to face a full- strength Cork in the quarter-finals. Ahead for most of the game, Waterford once again found themselves behind as the match entered injury time, but a Stephen Molumphy goal and a controversial pointed free from Eoin Kelly, after Donal √ìg Cusack was penalised for lying on the ball in the small square gave Waterford a second chance. A week later, two Dan Shanahan goals proved instrumental in giving Waterford a 2-17 (23) to 0‚Äì20 win. Waterford had only one week to prepare for an All-Ireland semi-final rematch with Limerick and this time it was Limerick who got off to a flying start, leading by ten points inside the first ten minutes. Waterford would cut the gap to a point late in the second half but frailties in the full back line were punished by Limerick with late goals to give them a 5-11 (26) to 2-15 (21) win, condemning Waterford to their fifth All-Ireland semi-final loss in ten years. The season ended on an upbeat note with a record five All Star awards, Tony Browne and Ken McGrath winning their third awards, Dan Shanahan his third also, and Stephen Molumphy and Michael Walsh their first. Shanahan was further rewarded by being named undisputed Hurler of the Year. 2008 Waterford started off the year with a Munster Championship first round clash with Clare at the Gaelic Grounds, Limerick on 1 June 2008. Waterford, missing a number of first team regulars such as Ken McGrath, Eoin Kelly and Eoin Murphy succumbed to a youthful Clare team on a scoreline of Waterford 0-23 Clare 2-26. Soon after the game, manager, Justin McCarthy was fired from his position by the Waterford County Board. It was rumoured at the time that player unrest had a lot to do with the decision. The Waterford County Board acted quickly and appointed former Clare goalkeeper Davy Fitzgerald as new Waterford manager on 10 June 2008. The loss to Clare sent Waterford into the All-Ireland Qualifier Series. The first round match against Antrim saw the return of both Ken McGrath and Eoin Kelly. Davy Fitzgerald started his Waterford managerial career with the unusual decision of placing Ken McGrath at full back in order to strengthen the full back line. The decision paid off and the match turned out to be a complete mismatch, with Waterford running out winners on a scoreline of Waterford 6-18 Antrim 0-15. Waterford were then pitted against Offaly in their Phase 4 Qualifier on 19 July 2008 at Semple Stadium, Thurles. After a stern test in the first 60 minutes, Waterford eventually pulled away towards the end winning on a scoreline of Waterford 2-18 Offaly 0-18. This resulted in Waterford reaching the All-Ireland Quarter Finals and a match-up against Leinster runners-up Wexford. This was a competitive match which tooed and froed from one side to the other. However, a late barrage of points saw Waterford over the line by 2‚Äì19 to 3-15. The win against Wexford led Waterford to their sixth All-Ireland Semi-Final since 1998. The opponents would be a highly fancied Tipperary, who were reigning National Hurling League and Munster champions. Waterford started a blistering page, going six points to nil up after only 10 minutes. However, Tipperary were level going in at half- time. Both teams scored goals in rapid succession in the second half. Waterford's nerve held and they managed to win by two points on a scoreline of Waterford 1-20 Tipperary 1-18. It was Waterford's first semi-final win since 1963 and brought to an end a run of five consecutive semi-final defeats. They met an inspired Kilkenny team in the All-Ireland final, who ran out 3‚Äì30 to 1-13 winners, which saw them complete the three-in-a-row. The inter-county year ended with Eoin Kelly being named as the D√©ise's only All Star. 2009 Waterford played Limerick in the Semi Final of the Munster Championship in Thurles on 14 June. The game was not a good game with players referring to the sliotar as being like a bar of soap. The match ended in a draw 1‚Äì8 to 0-11 and is said to be the worst Munster Championship game in modern times. The replay took place the following Saturday evening. Waterford were comfortable winners on a scoreline of 0‚Äì25 to 0-17. Waterford played Tipperary in the Munster Final on 12 July in Thurles, having agreed to play the game there to mark the 125th anniversary of the foundation of the GAA in the town. Waterford never looked like they were going to win and lost by four points on a scoreline of 4‚Äì14 to 2-16. A positive result on the day was the Waterford minor hurlers' victory over Tipperary, the county's first Munster championship success in the grade since 1992. Waterford went into the All- Ireland Quarter-Final again Galway as outsiders. Having struggled throughout the game, with John Mullane not scoring until the last minute, Waterford eventually emerged one-point winners in an eventful finish. Dan Shanahan came on as a sub with 4 minutes to go and proved to be Waterford's saviour, setting up fellow substitute Shane Walsh to score the only goal of the game before winning a vital free for Eoin Kelly to convert. Mullane's point set up a semi- final clash with reigning three-time champions Kilkenny. Despite two goals from Shane Walsh, Kilkenny led for most of the game and eventually won by five points before going on to win their fourth consecutive title. 2010 Waterford started out by winning the Waterford Crystal Cup, their first since 1998. They defeated Clare in the Munster Semi-Final and won their ninth Munster title when they defeated Cork after extra time with a cracking goal from Dan Shanahan in a replay in Thurles. The All-Ireland semi-final saw them lose at that stage for the seventh time in thirteen years, beaten by seven points by Tipperary. 2015 In May, Waterford in Derek McGrath's second year as manager won their first league title since 2007 after a 1‚Äì24 to 0‚Äì17 win against Cork in the final. Waterford beat Cork to make the Munster Final, but lost to Tipperary by five points. 2017 In 2017, Waterford suffered defeat in the All Ireland Senior Hurling Championship against Galway with a final score of 0‚Äì26 to 2‚Äì17.

The team competes in the three major annual inter-county competitions; the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship and the National Hurling League. Wexford's home ground is Wexford Park, Wexford. The team's manager is Davy Fitzgerald. The team last won the Leinster Senior Championship in 2019, the All-Ireland Senior Championship in 1996 and the National League in 1973. History Hurling is one of the most prominent sports in Wexford. This is in evidence in several one-sided results over the years: Kildare were beaten by 14‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì1 in an 1897 Croke Cup match. The Antrim team were beaten by 12‚Äì17 to 2‚Äì3 in a 1954 All-Ireland semi-final. Nicky Rackard, who scored 7‚Äì7 at that day, was Wexford's greatest hurler. He starred in two clashes with Cork in 1954 and 1956. Wexford lost the first after having a goal disallowed, but won the second with the combination of an Art Foley save and Nicky Rackard goal in the closing minutes. In the 1970s, the distinctive red-haired Tony Doran was the star as Kilkenny and Wexford played ten Leinster finals in succession. In 1984 they claimed that the final whistle was blown prematurely when they were beaten by a single point in the Leinster final. In 1996 Wexford, led by Liam Griffin and captained by Martin Storey, brought the Liam MacCarthy Cup back to Slaneyside for the first time since 1968; they were waiting 28 years. Cork, Kilkenny and Tipperary have dominated the honours in recent years. Davy Fitzgerald took over as manager of the team for 2017, and made progress by reaching the Leinster Final for the first time in nine years. In the final they played Galway. Fitzgerald was appointed after the departure of Liam Dunne, who also played a huge part in their recent success. They have lost only one game so far this year, which was in the Walsh Cup Semi Final by a single point against Kilkenny. So far this year, they have won promotion to division 1A, have gone unbeaten in the Allianz League: they beaten Limerick, Galway, Laois, Offaly and Kerry, and beat Kilkenny in Nowlan Park on a scoreline of 2-18 0‚Äì19 in the league quarter final. They faced All Ireland Champions Tipperary in the league semi final, which they lost after goals from Tipperary in the closing minutes. Recently they beat Laois 3‚Äì25 to 1‚Äì19 in Portlaoise in the Leinster quarter final, and beat Kilkenny at Innovate Wexford Park. This brought them to Croke Park for the Leinster final, but they lost 1-17 0‚Äì29 to Galway, who were All Ireland Champions that year. They played Waterford in P√°irc U√≠ Chao√≠mh in the All Ireland quarter final,but lost by a mere three points. Wexford's most recent hurling success was in the Leinster Final of 2019 when they defeated Kilkenny. In the Leinster semi-final, a draw in Wexford Park between Wexford and Kilkenny made it a rematch for the final. However, hurling in Wexford has been on the slide since 1996, their last All-Ireland success, and the Leinster title in 2004 simply papered over the cracks. =2009= In 2009, Wexford took part in Division 2 of the Allianz National Hurling League. After their shock defeat by Antrim, in which the Saffrons made a memorable comeback, Wexford improved to take a place in the division 2 final against Offaly. The yellowbellies were favourites, having beaten them earlier in the league, however Colm Bonnar's men did not perform on the day. It was a massive disappointment, meaning Wexford will be outside of hurling's top tier for the second year running. The Leinster championship arrived and Wexford had a chance for redemption with an opening round clash against Offaly. They gained revenge with Stephen Banville starring in a comfortable victory, with the aid of home advantage. Up next was Dublin and a younger more talented city side prevailed. This was followed up by defeat in the qualifiers against Limerick. =2010= In 2010 Wexford took part in Division 2 of the Allianz National Hurling League once again playing this time against Clare. The Model men were once again the favourites, having such a good league experience. Despite a disappointing performance Wexford still ran out winners at the end only to be promoted back to Division 1 of the Allianz National Hurling League after waiting three years. Wexford began the Leinster Championship 2010 with a defeat to Galway in Nowlan Park despite having a good second half. =2011= In 2011, Wexford took part in the Division 1 Allianz National Hurling League. Throughout the league campaign, it seemed the standard of The Model County was poor, but when it mattered in the last two games to stay up, they beat Offaly and Cork. They defeated Cork by 1‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì15 before drawing level with champions Tipperary. The championship began with the opening against Antrim which proved too easy for Wexford. The second game saw The Model County with home advantage against old rivals Kilkenny however it was Kilkenny's evening. Wexford exited in the qualifiers, for the second year in three, against Limerick which led to the resignation of Colm Bonnar as manager. He was replaced by Oulart the Ballagh manager Liam Dunne. =2013= In 2013, Wexford missed out promotion to Division 1A despite making progress. The Leinster Championship saw The 'Slaneysiders' take on Dublin at a very sunny soaked Wexford Park on Saturday 8 June with both sides starting very poorly despite Dublin racing into an early lead 0‚Äì4 to 0‚Äì1 before Wexford rallied back and brought the game level before Jack Guiney hit a rocket of a goal to restore the lead for the home side only for the Dubs to outscore with points from Joey Boland,Shane Durkan & Michael Carton. The 2nd half proved to be a real contest as Wexford looked like causing a real upset only for Eamon Dillion to score a late goal to secure Dublin's lead before a last minute free from Jack Guiney forced a replay with it ending 1‚Äì17 apiece. The replay took place in Parnell Park on 15 June which proved to be quite a disaster for Wexford as Andrew Shore was sent off after 5 minutes before Dublin rallied on to win 1‚Äì17 to 0‚Äì12 to advance to the Semi-final. Wexford had a good run through the qualifiers thrasing Antrim 3‚Äì18 to 0‚Äì17 before getting the better of Carlow 2‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì20 before eventually losing to eventual 'All Ireland Champions' Clare at a very sunny scorched Semple Stadium despite dragging the game to extra-time 3‚Äì24 to 1‚Äì20 the final result. =2014= In 2014, Wexford advanced to the League Quarter Final only to lose to Leinster rivals Kilkenny. The Leinster opener saw Wexford trash Antrim 5‚Äì19 to 0‚Äì21 at O'Moore Park on 1 June to advance the semi-final only to lose to reigning Leinster champions Dublin. The run through the qualifiers proved to be a real surprise as they looked like dethroning the reigning All Ireland Champions Clare at Cusack Park on 5 July only to end in a draw despite going to extra-time ending 2‚Äì25 apiece. The replay took place the following week 12 July at Wexford Park with Clare looking like they were going through only Wexford rallying back to bring the match level & extra-time once again before Wexford eventually ran out winners 2‚Äì25 to 2‚Äì22. They played Munster rivals Waterford the following Saturday with Wexford getting a decent lead during the first with rocket of goals ending the match 3‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì15. The Quarter Final saw Munster finalists Limerick hammer a very exhausted Wexford side 4‚Äì26 to 1‚Äì11.

History Liam Rushe in action for the Dublin hurlers against Galway in the Allianz Hurling League In the 2005 league Dublin were relegated to Division Two in the National Hurling League, while the minor side won the Leinster Championship for the first time since 1983. In 2006 Dublin gained promotion to Division One after victory over Kerry in the Division Two final. Following some indifferent displays in the 2006 All- Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, they still managed to save their status in the top flight of hurling counties and again contested the McCarthy Cup in 2007. In the 2007 National Hurling League, meanwhile, despite being favourites to go down in 2007, Dublin managed to avoid relegation by finishing in fourth position. In 2009, former Clare manager, Anthony Daly was appointed manager of Dublin. Under his management, Dublin contested the Leinster Final, but lost by 2 goals to Kilkenny. Dublin won the National Hurling League in May 2011 after a 12-point win over Kilkenny, their first national title since they won the All Ireland in 1938. The hurlers have a very fervent following who travel in significant numbers to matches in the provinces. There has been a revival in the fortunes and popularity of Dublin hurling in recent years, and Dublin underage teams have had much success. On 7 July 2013, they won the Leinster Final against Galway on a 2‚Äì25 to 2‚Äì13 scoreline, scoring 2‚Äì21 from play. This was the first time they had won this important competition since 1961. In a nice touch, the Goalkeeper from the 1961 team, presented Dublin Captain, Johnny McCaffrey with the Bob O'Keefe trophy.

In terms of All-Ireland titles, they are significantly behind hurling's big three of Kilkenny, Cork and Tipperary. Their six titles do however place them fifth in the overall winners list, jointly tied with Wexford. Dublin have won the Leinster Championship on 24 occasions, the second most Leinster titles of any side, although they remain well behind Kilkenny, who have won the Leinster Championship 70 times. Dublin have won the National Hurling League three times: in 1929, 1939 and 2011. This places them joint seventh (with Clare) on the overall winners list, having won 16 fewer titles than top-ranked Tipperary.http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/gaa/ Fingal In 2007, the GAA announced that a hurling team from Fingal (north county Dublin) would compete in parallel to the main Dublin team, to encourage hurling in an area of growing population where the game has not been strong. While players from Fingal are eligible for the main Dublin team, non-Fingal players cannot play for Fingal. The new team competed in the Nicky Rackard Cup in 2008, and the Kehoe Cup in 2009. They played in the National Hurling League up until 2016 when the Fingal Hurling project was disbanded.

The team competes in the Joe McDonagh Cup and the National Hurling League. Westmeath's home ground is Cusack Park, Mullingar. The team's manager is Michael Ryan. The team has never won the Leinster Senior Championship, the All-Ireland Senior Championship or the National League. History The Westmeath hurlers experienced a successful period in the mid 1930s, when they won the Leinster League twice in succession, the Junior Championship in 1936, and beat Laois to qualify for the 1937 Leinster Senior final. Rickardstown's John 'Jobber' McGrath, who played for the county in the 1950s and 1960s, is regarded as Westmeath's greatest hurler, and as one of the greatest players never to have won an All-Ireland senior hurling title. Westmeath played in the first division of the National Hurling League in 1985‚Äì86, and were the only team to beat Galway in an 18-month period. This team included the three Kilcoyne brothers and produced an All Star award for David, who was the team's free taker and top scorer in 1986. The first All Star award for any Westmeath player in hurling or football. In 2005, the county won the first Christy Ring Cup and thereby gained promotion to the 2006 Liam McCarthy Championship. In 2006, they beat Dublin in the first round of the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship before losing the semi final to Kilkenny in Mullingar by 14 points. They then lost to Waterford, Galway and, disappointingly, Laois before tamely losing a relegation playoff against Dublin on a scorching July day in Tullamore. Despite progress made in 2006, the GAA condemned the county's hurlers to the Christy Ring Cup - this time without the prospect of promotion. Further rule changes and a Christy Ring win in 2010 allowed Westmeath back into the 2011 Liam McCarthy. Further progress came on 20 April 2008 with victory in the NHL (Division 2), winning the final against Carlow. That day also saw their footballing counterparts move into Division 1 of the NFL also, with a win over Dublin. In 2015, the Westmeath minor hurlers surprised heavy favourites Wexford by two points in the Leinster quarter-final, the win has been regarded by the manager as the 'biggest result in history of Westmeath hurling'. The senior hurlers beat Carlow by two points in the Leinster Qualifier group and extended their winning run beating favourites, Antrim 1‚Äì21 to 0‚Äì7. A famous victory over near rivals Offaly was achieved in May 2016 in the Leinster Championship. Westmeath led by some distance for the entire game before winning 2‚Äì21 to 1‚Äì10.

The team competes in the three major annual inter-county competitions; the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship and the National Hurling League. It formerly competed in the abolished Connacht Senior Hurling Championship, winning the last title in 1999. Galway's home ground is Pearse Stadium, Salthill. The team's manager is Shane O'Neill. The team last won the Leinster Senior Championship in 2018, the All-Ireland Senior Championship in 2017 and the National League in 2017. History All-Ireland Champions Kilkenny in the 2015 Allianz Hurling League. =Early years and 'curse'= Galway were runners up in the very first All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, losing to Tipperary in the 1887 final. The team did not reach another final in the competition until the 1923 Championship. In the 1923 final, Galway defeated Limerick, to become champions for the first time in their history. The team made it to the final four more times in that decade, appearing in 1924, 1925, 1928 and 1929 deciders, but lost on each occasion. Galway continued to come up short in the Championship, and by the time the team lost three finals in a decade being runners up in 1953, 1955 and again in 1958, it had been 35 years since their only triumph. Like many counties that had previously experienced success before enduring a lengthy spell without titles, Galway became the subject of rumours of a curse, as has also happened to Mayo in football and Clare in hurling. In 1969 Connacht reached the final of the interprovincial Railway Cup for the first time in ten years with a team drawn primarily from Galway, and held Munster to a draw before being beaten in the replay, and this boosted the game in the county. However, a disastrous All-Ireland campaign followed for Galway, with the team losing to London in the 1969 championship and the following year Connacht lost at home to Ulster in the preliminary round of the 1970 Railway Cup, running up 20 wides. By the time the Galway hurlers were heavily beaten in 1975 and 1979 finals the curse was part of folklore. =1980s success= In 1980 Castlegar won the All- Ireland Club Championship, while Connacht beat Munster in that year's Railway Cup final, bringing a measure of success back to Galway. In the 1980 championship, the team was managed by Cyril Farrell. Due to the lack of competition for Galway in Connacht, the team's first match of the season came against Kildare in the quarter-final round, a game which Galway won comfortably on a score of 5‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì11. From there the team faced Offaly, the Leinster champions, in the semi-final. Galway overcame Offaly by two points on a scoreline of 4‚Äì9 to 3‚Äì10 to qualify for the decider. Galway faced Limerick in the final. Galway came out on top in a close game that saw five goals scored to win the All-Ireland by 2-15 to 3-9. Captain Joe Connolly became the first Galway man to lift the Liam MacCarthy since Mick Kenny in 1923. Galway entered the 1981 championship as champions, and played their first game on 19 July against Antrim in the quarter-final, winning by 6-23 to 3-11. Galway progressed to the semi-finals where they met their opponents from the previous year's final, Limerick. A hard fought game between the two finished level at 1-08 to 0-11, with Galway the goal-scoring team. The replay saw Galway come out as five point winners, qualifying for the decider on a final score of 4-16 to 2-17. In the final, Galway met Leinster champions Offaly. Despite having beaten the Faithful County in the previous year's semi-final, Galway failed to retain their title, being three point losers on a score of 2-12 to 0-15. Galway returned to the final in the 1985 championship, beating Cork to qualify. In the final, the team again met Offaly, and were beaten by their eastern neighbors by 2-11 to 1-12. Galway were again runners up in the 1986 final, when they were beaten by Cork. The 1987 championship saw Galway qualify for their third final in a row. Still managed by Farrell, Galway overcame Tipperary by 3-20 to 2-17 to make it to the decider. Captained by Conor Hayes and inspired by the young Joe Cooney, who scored five points on the day, Galway defeated Kilkenny by 1-12 to 0-09 in the final. Cooney was named Hurler of the Year for his performances at the age of just 22. In 1988, Galway opened the defence of their title against London on 16 July, beating the Exiles comfortably by 4-30 to 2-08 in the quarter-finals. In the semi-finals they came up against Offaly, a team that had repeatedly stumbled against during the decade, but came out as winners by 3-18 to 3-11. The win over Offaly set up a meeting with Tipperary in the 1988 final. Galway beat the Premier County by 1-15 to 0-14 to win their fourth ever All-Ireland. This was also the first time Galway had managed to retain their title. =Post-1980s struggles= The youth and skill of the team which won All-Ireland Championships in 1987 and 1988 was suggestive of more to come. John Commins penalty and race back to the line was one of the great images indicating the spirit of the team. Galway were narrowly beaten by Tipperary in a controversial 1989 semi-final and Cork in the final of 1990, while the brilliance of the 1993 final defeat by Kilkenny is sometimes forgotten because of the drama that ensued in the following years. For the 2009 Hurling Championship, Galway played in the Leinster Championship, starting a trial period of three years there. In May 2010, Galway won their ninth National Hurling League with a 2‚Äì22 to 1‚Äì17 win against Cork at Semple Stadium. Galway opened their 2010 Championship campaign against Wexford. Despite a second half surge by Wexford, Galway still won by 11 points. Galway then went on to play Offaly. The Faithful county gave Galway a strong scare in the Semi-Final. On 20 June, Offaly and Galway drew 3-16 to 2-19. Six days later, the Tribesman beat Offaly in the replay to propel them into their first Leinster Final ever. In the final, Kilkenny won their 20th Championship game in a row, beating Galway by a scoreline of 1-19 to 1-12. Even though they lost, Galway were given an automatic All-Ireland Quarterfinal birth. In that All-Ireland Quarterfinal match, the Tribesman squared up against Tipperary. In a closely contested match all the way through, Galway fell short of the semi-finals again, losing 3-17 to 3-16. Tipperary went on to upset Kilkenny, who were looking for their fifth championship in a row, in the 2010 All-Ireland Final. Expectations were high in 2011, as many thought that Galway were ready to take the next step and possibly participate in an All- Ireland Final. The League started with great success as Galway won 4 of the first 5 matches including a victory over Kilkenny. But, they dropped the last two giving everyone a sour taste. The Championship brought new life and hope to the supporters of Galway who saw the opportunity at hand for the season. After a Leinster Quarter-final win over Westmeath, Galway took on Dublin and played one of their worst games in recent memory. Besides an early goal by Joe Canning, Galway never seemed to be in the game at all. A decent Dublin team rolled through them. But, Galway erased the bad feelings from Leinster Semi- final exit over the next month. In two qualifying matches, Galway knocked out Clare and Cork handily, propelling them into the quarter-finals of the All- Ireland and a match with Munster runners up, Waterford. Waterford had two weeks earlier been beaten by Tipperary by seven goals. It wasn't known whether Galway would be in the All-Ireland, but coming up against Waterford, at such a low ebb, seemed to be at least a ticket to the semi-final, but, that wasn't the case. Waterford absolutely hammered Galway 2-23 to 2-13. Serious questions were being raised about the coaching, selection, squad of players, and overall mindset of Galway hurling. =New hope in the Cunningham era= Anthony Cunningham, who had just recently led to Galway U-21s to an All-Ireland, was brought up to manage the Senior team. Mattie Coleman and Tom Helebert were picked to help Cunningham. Many expected 2012 to be a rebuilding year for Galway hurling. Many thought that the team was a few years away from contention yet and needed to do a lot of growing. The League was not kind to Galway. They barely saved their status in Division One by having to go a replay in a relegation play-off match with Dublin. Galway reached a Leinster Final against Kilkenny after wins over Westmeath and Offaly. Still, many felt that Kilkenny would easily beat Galway. But, it wasn't to be. Galway produced a massive upset, beating Galway lifted their first Bob O'Keefe Cup ever. The road didn't stop there. After a slow first half, Galway held off a strong Cork team in the All-Ireland Semi-final. Galway were matched with Kilkenny again for the All-Ireland final. Joe Canning's 10th-minute goal got Galway rolling and they led by 5 at half time: 1-9 to 0-7. Kilkenny, however, were able to fight back. A Henry Shefflin point taken from the penalty spot separated the sides late in the game but, with 30 seconds left, Davy Glennon was fouled and Joe Canning scored from the free putting the All-Ireland Hurling Final to a replay for the first time in 53 years. In the replay however, Kilkenny overpowered Galway, with a final score of 3-22 to 3-11. A 2012 Leinster Senior Hurling Championship winners' medal was later sold on eBay for ‚Ç¨570.

Built at the same time as SNCF BB 9001-9002, these four units were used to evaluate locomotives with total adhesion in the course of normal operation. They also served as prototypes that helped define the mechanical and electrical characteristics of future locomotives to be ordered in greater quantities. The Jaquemin trucks were later used in BB 9200-9300-9700, 12000-13000, 16000-16100, 20100, 25100-25150-25200 series locomotives, the body design (with common aesthetics) would be used in BB 9200-9300-9700, 9400, 16000-16100, 20100, 25100-25150-25200, 30000 series locomotives and traction equipment (JH servomotors) would be used in the BB 9200-9300-9700 series. Design and Operation History BB 9003 was the first French locomotive to be remote- controlled from the exterior of its train. BB 9004 broke a rail speed record of 331 km / h on March 29, 1955 on the Landes line between Facture and Morcenx, France , a day after SNCF 7107 did not exceed the actual speed of 325 km / h , but the railway gave the speed record of 331 km / h to the credit of the both machines in order to protect the commercial interests of the manufacturers. The event was widely broadcast in France and in other countries; an American television news crew sent an airplane to overfly the attempt and they were certain the train would derail before reaching 330 km/h. In fact, the airplane had trouble keeping up with the train. SNCF engineers were delighted at the performance; this attempt represented a beginning into the study of using electricity as the means of propulsion for high speed rail. When leaving the factory, BB 9001 and 9002 wore a two-color livery (dark bluish green and light bluish green) with aluminum stripes down the centerline, similar to the 2D2 9100s released shortly before them. 9001 and 9002 were later repainted in a uniform dark bluish green paint scheme.

He was one of the most skilled engravers of the seventeenth century and a member of the Acad√©mie.  About  Gilles Rousselet, born in 1610 in Paris, France. His father was a bookseller and possibly a printmaker. It is unknown with whom he studied engraving under, but his work was inspired by Abraham Bloemaert. Gilles Rousselet married in 1645 to Judith Le Goux in the Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs church, and together they had fourteen children. He was the father of sculptor, Jean Rousselet (1656‚Äì1693). A lot of Rousselet's engraving work was a reproduction of works by other artists. During his career he reproduced work by artists, including Gr√©goire Huret, Claude Vignon, Jacques Stella, Laurent de La Hyre, Raphael, Pietro da Cortona, Guido Reni, Valentin de Boulogne, Nicolas Poussin, and his friend Charles Le Brun. Unlike Rousselet, many of the known engravers of the 17th century created their own original artworks and were held at higher esteem, such as Jacques Callot, Claude Mellan, Robert Nanteuil, and Israel Silvestre. The Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture had always considered printmakers and engravers inferior to painters, and starting in 1663, the first engravers were admitted, starting in April with Fran√ßois Chauveau. On August 7, 1663, Rousselet was the second engraver to enter the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture. Charles LeBrun had supported Rousselet's entrance to the Acad√©mie. He exhibited his works at the Salons exhibition of 1664 and of 1673.  Death and legacy  On 1678, Rousselet went blind and was no longer able to work. He died July 15, 1686 in Paris, France and buried eleven days later. On July 22nd, 1686 an inventory was made of his belongings, which included all of his prints and engraving plates. He was related to engraver Marie-Anne Rousselet.  Collections  His work is included in the public museum collections at Harvard Art Museums, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the National Portrait Gallery, London, Rijksmuseum, National Gallery of Art, the National Gallery of Victoria, Minneapolis Institute of Art, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Victoria and Albert Museum, Philadelphia Museum of Art, National Gallery of Ireland, among others.

It was built in the late 18th century by the Alaouite sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah.  Historical background  Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah did not choose a capital for his reign but in practice he based himself in Marrakesh more than any other city. As a result, he carried a number of renovations and constructions within the royal citadel (the Kasbah and Dar al-Makhzen) of the city, including the restoration of the main Kasbah Mosque. However, reportedly because his son Maymun wanted a mosque that was closer to the palace itself, he commissioned another mosque, the Barrima Mosque. This mosque is located on the eastern edge of the Royal Palace grounds and the western edge of the old Mellah (Jewish quarter), near the city gate of the same name, Bab Berrima. The mosque acted as an official royal mosque much like the Lalla Aouda Mosque did for Moulay Isma'il's kasbah and palace in Meknes.  Architecture  Compared to other Moroccan mosques, the Barrima Mosque's form and layout are unusual. Rather than a sahn, the mosque's large square courtyard (measuring 35 by 35 meters) was referred to as a mechouar (an official royal square). Between this and the prayer hall was a vestibule alongside two waiting rooms for the sultan and government officials. The prayer hall, measuring 15 by 25 metres, is smaller than the courtyard and does not follow the usual form of prayer halls in Moroccan mosques: instead of a hypostyle space with rows of arches, it is composed of a large square chamber covered by a cupola resting on 12 columns and of another rectangular space in front of the mihrab (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer). The wooden ceilings of the prayer hall are the most beautifully decorated aspect of the mosque. The mosque had three entrances, of which only the northern one was accessible to the common inhabitants outside the palace. The sultan had his own private entrance, accessible from the palace, which opened next to the mihrab inside the mosque. Its minaret is merely a small tower which does not surpass the height of the nearby walls of the palace (possibly an intentional design to avoid providing a view into the restricted grounds of the palace). The mosque was originally provided with an adjoining madrasa and an ablutions chamber (midha), but these were in ruins by the mid-20th century.

It is the season finale and debuted on Fox on May 17, 2020. In this episode, Santa's Little Helper bites matriarch Marge, causing the family to reflect on the difficult life that the dog led prior to being adopted by the family and they end up reuniting him with his mother to avoid having to euthanize him. The episode is dedicated in memory of Little Richard, who previously appeared in the episode \\"Special Edna\\" and had died on May 9, 2020. The episode has received positive reception from critics. Plot Santa's Little Helper is agitated by the sights, sounds, and smells of the Simpsons' Christmas celebration: he refuses to be affectionate, tears apart the couch, and stares idly at a smudge on the cabinet. Lisa suggests attending a seminar from dog psychologist Elaine Wolff. Wolff mostly berates dog owners and her talk is not helpful, but when Lisa tries to ask her to help the Simpsons to empathize with Santa's Little Helper, she explains that they are underestimating how his sense of smell is strongly tied to memory and it brings back memories of when he was an abused racing dog. When Marge reaches for a Santa Claus hat that the dog has been keeping next to him, he nips at her. Bart insists on sleeping outside with the dog overnight. The next day, they take him to an incompetent vet who wants to euthanize him. He calls the police and Chief Wiggum comes to their house with a dog exterminator close behind. Moments before animal control is set to arrive, Wolff appears at the door saying that she has had a revelation and wants to save him. She runs off with Santa's Little Helper and they go to her therapy institute where she has an opportunity to communicate with him. She determines that the event causing his post-traumatic stress disorder goes back to his childhood and she sets out to find his origin. At the No Kill Kennel, dog trainer Les Moore explains how he took Santa's Little Helper from his mother She-Biscuit because he ran to her so quickly. The family is outraged, but their hearts are quickly warmed when the mother and son are reunited in Moore's yard. The Simpsons adopt She-Biscuit and give her a happy home. Reception Writing for The A.V.

LCVLs are important in the theory of topological vector lattices.  Lattice semi-norms  The Minkowski functional of a convex, absorbing, and solid set is a called a lattice semi-norm. Equivalently, it is a semi-norm p such that \\\\left y \\\\right \\\\leq \\\\left x \\\\right implies p(y) \\\\leq p(x). The topology of a locally convex vector lattice is generated by the family of all continuous lattice semi-norms.  Properties  Every locally convex vector lattice possesses a neighborhood base at the origin consisting of convex balanced solid absorbing sets. The strong dual of a locally convex vector lattice X is an order complete locally convex vector lattice (under its canonical order) and it is a solid subspace of the order dual of X; moreover, if X is a barreled space then the continuous dual space of X is a band in the order dual of X and the strong dual of X is a complete locally convex TVS. If a locally convex vector lattice is barreled then its strong dual space is complete (this is not necessarily true if the space is merely a locally convex barreled space but not a locally convex vector lattice). If a locally convex vector lattice X is semi-reflexive then it is order complete and X_b (i.e. \\\\left( X, b\\\\left(X, X^{\\\\prime}\\\\right) \\\\right)) is a complete TVS; moreover, if in addition every positive linear functional on X is continuous then X is of X is of minimal type, the order topology \\\\tau_{\\\\operatorname{O}} on X is equal to the Mackey topology \\\\tau\\\\left( X, X^{\\\\prime} \\\\right), and \\\\left( X, \\\\tau_{\\\\operatorname{O}} \\\\right) is reflexive. Every reflexive locally convex vector lattice is order complete and a complete locally convex TVS whose strong dual is a barreled reflexive locally convex TVS that can be identified under the canonical evaluation map with the strong bidual (i.e. the strong dual of the strong dual). If a locally convex vector lattice X is an infrabarreled TVS then it can be identified under the evaluation map with a topological vector sublattice of its strong bidual, which is an order complete locally convex vector lattice under its canonical order. If X is a separable metrizable locally convex ordered topological vector space whose positive cone C is a complete and total subset of X, then the set of quasi-interior points of C is dense in C. Theorem: Suppose that X is an order complete locally convex vector lattice with topology ùúè and endow the bidual X^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} of X with its natural topology (i.e. the topology of uniform convergence on equicontinuous subsets of X^{\\\\prime}) and canonical order (under which it becomes an order complete locally convex vector lattice). The following are equivalent: 1. The evaluation map X \\\\to X^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} induces an isomorphism of X with an order complete sublattice of X^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}. 2. For every majorized and directed subset S of X, the section filter of S converges in (X, ùúè) (in which case it necessarily converges to \\\\sup S). 3. Every order convergent filter in X converges in (X, ùúè) (in which case it necessarily converges to its order limit). Corollary: Let X be an order complete vector lattice with a regular order. The following are equivalent: 1. X is of minimal type. 2. For every majorized and direct subset S of X, the section filter of S converges in X when X is endowed with the order topology. 3. Every order convergent filter in X converges in X when X is endowed with the order topology. Moreover, if X is of minimal type then the order topology on X is the finest locally convex topology on X for which every order convergent filter converges. If (X, ùúè) is a locally convex vector lattice that is bornological and sequentially complete, then there exists a family of compact spaces \\\\left( X_{\\\\alpha} \\\\right)_{\\\\alpha \\\\in A} and a family of A-indexed vector lattice embeddings f_{\\\\alpha} : C_{\\\\mathbb{R}}\\\\left( K_{\\\\alpha} \\\\right) \\\\to X such that ùúè is the finest locally convex topology on X making each f_{\\\\alpha} continuous.

The square includes the Ohio Statehouse, its Capitol Grounds, as well as the buildings and features surrounding the square. The Capitol Grounds are surrounded on the north and west by Broad and High Streets, the main thoroughfares of the city since its founding, along with 3rd Street on the east and State Street the south. The oldest building on Capitol Square, the Ohio Statehouse, is the center of the state government, and in the rough geographic center of Capitol Square, Columbus, and Ohio. History The statehouse grounds were donated by four prominent Franklinton landholders to form the new state capitol. As the city's downtown began to empty in the mid-20th century, several buildings on the square were demolished. A construction boom downtown in the 1970s and 80s led to nearly all spaces being occupied again. The last large empty parcels, on 3rd Street, are aimed to be developed in the 2020s.

He developed two medications, Kemron and Pearl Omega, to cure HIV/AIDS. It was later discovered that neither Kemron nor Pearl Omega were affective medications against the retrovirus.  Education, Career, and Honoraries  Education = Professor Arthur Obel received his PhD in Therapeutics from the London University in 1978. He then received his M.D. in Clinical Medicine from the University of Nairobi in 1987. = Career = Dr. Obel was head of the Public Administration of the Kenya Institute of Administration in 1990. He also had the position of Chief Research Officer of the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) from 1989 to 1991. Obel later became the Chief Scientist of the Office of the President of Kenya from 1995 to 1999. This high position in government allowed him to attain many funds for his research. Being in a respectable position also allowed him to have many close friends that were high ranking government officials, such as Philip Mbithi, the former Chief Secretary in the Office of the President of Kenya. = Honoraries = Professor Obel received many honoraries. He was a member of the Global Epidemiology Society in 1983 and the Achievers Society in 1983. Obel did a fellowship with numerous institutions including the Jewish Chemists Federation in 1986, the International Diabetes Federation in 1986, and the Global Pharmaceutical Federation in 1987. He was also a Project Management Profesional (PMP) with the Centre for Finance and Project Management in 2004.  Kemron  Dr. Arthur Obel claimed that Kemron and Pearl Omega were the cures to HIV/AIDS. Professor Obel joined KEMRI, the Kenya Medical Research Institute, and they aimed to find an effective treatment to eradicate HIV/AIDS. KEMRI and Obel picked up a medication that was developed but denied approval for testing in the United States and lowered the concentration before testing. This medication was Kemron. The medication was tested in other areas, such as the University of Makerere. It was then discovered that Kemron did nothing much to help the disease. Kemron only reversed the symptoms of the HIV disease for a short period of time. Because of this, people were quick to purchase the expensive medication. Dr. Obel received much backlash because of this and resigned from KEMRI in January 1991.  Pearl Omega  Pearl Omega, an herb, was found to have very few positive outcomes when combatting HIV. Obel claimed that Pearl Omega was a protease inhibitor and sold the drug at a very expensive price. One bottle of Pearl Omega was 30,000 Kenyan shillings, the equivalence of 350 pounds. Human trials of this medication started in 1991 and Obel claimed that the medication restored the health of seven AIDS patients. However, there was no scientific data to back up his claims. People were much less inclined to purchase the second drug produced by Obel after Kemron. The Health Minister disowned the drug and many institutions banned the use of the drug after the discreditation of Obel. Pearl Omega was later found to be sold in the black market illegally as it is illegal for any medication to be sold before it is approved by the Health Minister in Kenya.  Aftermath of Kemron and Pearl Omega  Professor Obel was sued by many patients because of Kemron and Pearl Omega's ineffectiveness and he later had a court case versus the Kenya AIDS Society in 1998. This court case against Obel was because he manufactured, distributed, and sold Pearl Omega without the approval of the Health Minister of Kenya. Obel won the case and gained a reputation of falsifying information and fraud. Professor Arthur Obel continued his work on HIV/AIDS even after the discreditation of the Kemron and Pearl Omega medications. In 2011, he published work on the correlation of WHO clinical staging with CD4 cell count in adult HIV positive patients at the Kenyatta National Hospital. Obel wrote a book called \\"Curbing the HIV/AIDS Menace Effectively\\" in 1995.  Work not Relating to HIV/AIDS  Although Obel is most known for his work on Kemron and Pearl Omega, a big part of Dr. Obel's research consisted of practical therapeutics. He has numerous published works including practical therapeutics on antibiotic therapy, the use of insulin, the use of anti-diabetic agents, the treatment of gout, the treatment of peptic ulcers, anxiolytic drugs, and the therapy of diarrhoeal diseases. Professor Obel also has written, and self- published, numerous books such as \\"Power and Intrigue,\\" a book relating to one's power, whether it be associative, personal, professional, or reward power, \\"Kenya's Industrialization Strategy,\\" and \\"Resilient Manhood Dynamism: The Basis of a Rapid Take-off.\\"  References  Category:Kenyan scientists Category:HIV/AIDS researchers Category:University of Nairobi alumni Category:African scientists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Arthur Obel"},{"id":"63990774","text":"Ted Damata (died May 23, 1988) was an American sports journalist for the Chicago Tribune.

Life and work  Davis started playing banjo during his senior year in high school to play Dixieland with a college band called The Salty Dogs. The Purdue-based group played across the Midwestern United States and had pre- appearances of greats like The Four Freshmen and The Kingston Trio. He moved to Purdue for a year, then to Chicago. There, he became an integral part of the jazz scene at venues such as the \\"Gaslight Club\\" and Bourbon Street and often worked for variety or comedy acts, among others. with actor David Huddleston. He also appeared on a Dixieland revue in Disneyland and served as musical director for a tour resumption of the musical Whoopee! In 1966, he recorded his debut album \\"Live! At the Old Town Gate\\", with a group that from then on operated as \\"Eddy Davis Dixie Jazzmen\\". The next albums under the Davis name included \\"Whiz Bang\\" (1973), a satirical production with flute and tuba and \\"Plays and Sings Just For Fun\\" (1974, mainly devoted to Jelly Roll Morton). Davis went to New York and received recognition from the jazz traditionalists there: he played drums in the earliest edition of Vince Giordano's \\"Nighthawks\\". In 1976, he performed in Germany with his European colleagues Herbert Christ, Jean-Pierre Mulot and Ren√© Franc in the \\"Hot Jazz Orchestra of Europe\\". In the American edition of this \\"Hot Jazz Orchestra\\" he played in 1979 with Max Kaminsky, Vince Giordano, Bobby Gordon and Dill Jones; In 1983, the clarinetist Jack Maheu and the pianist Don Ewell were part of \\"Eddy Davis and The Hot Jazz Orchestra\\". With \\"Stanley‚Äôs Washboard Kings\\" around Stan King, Davis went on a Japanese tour in the same year. He also orchestrated and conducted a musical by Terry Waldo, with whose \\"Waldo‚Äôs Gutbucket Syncopators\\", he recorded several albums. When the conductor performed Maurice Peress Paul Whiteman's \\"Aeolian Hall Concert\\" from 1924 on its 60th anniversary, he hired Davis as a banjoist. At that time he performed regularly in the club Red Blazer Too in a trio with his banjo colleague Cynthia Sayer and the bassist Pete Compo. With Sayer, Davis also founded the \\"New York Banjo Ensemble\\", which recorded an album with compositions by George Gershwin in 1984 and an album with Rags in 2005. Davis's connection with Woody Allen was established in Chicago in the 1960s when Davis was headlining a club on Rush Street and Allen was a comedian at that club, but also played in his band. Allen played in Eddy Davis's \\"New Orleans Jazz Band\\", with which Allen - otherwise known as a filmmaker - held the court as a clarinetist in New York for around 35 years. The band has played in the \\"Caf√© Carlyle\\"' every Monday evening since 1997 (when it wasn't on an international tour); before that she had appeared in \\"Michael‚Äôs Pub\\" every week since 1985.

He was the Chief Executive Officer of Hoffmann-La Roche from 1978 to 1998. From 1977 to 1991, he was also the CEO of Zurich Insurance Group. Under his management, Roche expanded to become a significant player in biotechnology and diagnostics. Biography Fritz Gerber was born on 22 March 1929 in Huttwil, a municipality in the Canton of Bern. After completing his law degree at the University of Bern, he found work as a trade negotiator for the Swiss government. In 1958, he started his career at Zurich Insurance, performing legal work in a number of locations. He rose through the ranks quickly. In 1965, he became a director of the insurance company at the age of 36 and in 1974 was named as the president of the management board. In 1977, he was appointed as CEO of Zurich Insurance. One year later, Hoffman-La Roche named him as its CEO, but retained his position at Zurich. From 1978 to 1991, he ran both companies. At the time of his appointment, Roche was struggling from reputational fallout after the 1976 Seveso disaster in which an explosion at a facility operated by a Roche subsidiary in Italy sickened people and livestock in the surrounding area. In 1990, Gerber moved into the biotechnology field with the acquisition of a 60% stake in Genentech for $2.1 billion. With the acquisition, the company gained access to breakthrough cancer drugs such as Herceptin and Avastin. In 1991, Roche acquired the patent rights to polymerase chain reaction technology from Cetus Corporation. The acquisition of Boehringer Mannheim, now Roche Diagnostics, for $11 billion made Roche the largest diagnostic products company in the world and the sixth-largest pharmaceuticals firm in the world at the time. Gerber stepped down as the CEO or Zurich Insurance in 1991, but remained as the chairman of the board of directors until 1995. In 1997, he stepped down as CEO of Roche and stayed on as chairman until 2001. In 2004, he surrendered his seat on the board and took an honorary title with Roche. Gerber was active in charitable work. He was involved in efforts to establish the Museum Tinguely in Basel. He also had a personal charitable foundation for talented youths.

It is estimated to be between 1 and 3 million years in age, corresponding to the late Pliocene and Pleistocene.Koning et al. 2002 The formation is one of the youngest of the Santa Fe Group formations deposited in the Rio Grande rift. It is an important local aquifer. Description The Ancha Formation is mostly granitic gravel and sand with some mudstone, derived from the southwestern flank of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. It is interpreted as a streamflow-dominated piedmont unit. The formation is estimated to be thick based on seismic refraction studies.Koning et al. 2002, p.80 The age is constrained by an ash bed from the Jemez Mountains near the top of the formation, dated via argon-argon dating to 1.48 ¬± 0.02 Ma, and an inset fluvial deposit dated to 1.25 ¬± 0.06 Ma. Some portions of the formation may have continued accumulating sediments from mountain front canyons east of Santa Fe into the late Pleistocene. The base of the formation is thought to vary in age from ~2.7‚Äì3.5(?) Ma in the western Santa Fe embayment to ~1.6 Ma near the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The formation correlates with Pliocene‚Äìearly Pleistocene aggradation in the Espa√±ola and Albuquerque Basins, suggesting a regional climate influence on deposition in the uppermost Santa Fe Group. The good preservation of the Ancha Formation relative to piedmont regions to the south and eroded upland regions to the north suggests that late Pliocene volcanism and tectonism may have provided accommodation space. The Ancha Formation was likely deposited in the Santa Fe Area by the Santa Fe River and other large streams. However, it contains clasts of rock unlike that of the southwestern Sangre de Cristo Mountains, suggesting that the Pecos River originally drained into the Santa Fe River watershed.Smith 2004, p.346 File:Ancha Formation.jpgAncha Formation at reference section south-southeast of Santa Fe. File:Ancha Formation close.jpgClose view of Ancha Formation at reference section. File:Ancha Galisteo contact.jpgHorizontal Ancha Formation beds resting on nearly vertical Galisteo Formation beds. Natural resources The Ancha Formation is a thin (less than saturated thickness) but locally important aquifer for domestic wells south of Santa Fe. Its porosity is much greater than the underlying beds of the Tesuque Formation. History of investigation Spiegel and Baldwin formally named the formation and designated a type section in 1963,Spiegel and Baldwin 1963, pp.45-50 but the name seems to have been used informally as early as 1952.Baltz et al. 1952 The formation is named for exposures around Canada Ancha (), a drainage that follows the northwest escarpment of the Cerros del Rio to the Rio Grande. Koning et al. redefined the formation in 2002 and designated four additional reference sections to supplement the poorly exposed type section. Their definition removed the lower beds at the type section from the formation and reassigned them to the underlying Tesuque Formation.Koning et al. 2002  References  Bibliography =  * Category:Neogene formations of New Mexico ","title":"Ancha Formation"},{"id":"63990996","text":"List of Ambassadors *Shmuel (Sammy) Revel (2017-) *Yael Ravia-Zadok 2015 - 2017 *Michael Harari (diplomat) 2010 - 2015 *Avraham Haddad 2006 - 2010 *Zvi Cohen-Litant 2004 - 2006 *Michael Eligal 2000 - 2004 *Shemi Tzur 1993 - 2000 *David Granit 1992 - 1993 *Aharon Lopez 1987 - 1992 *Amos Shtibel 1986 - 1987 *Meir Gavish 1984 - 1986 *Zeev Dover 1981 - 1983 *Avraham Giladi 1979 - 1981 *Nissim Yosha 1974 - 1977 *Charge d'Affaires a.i.

Both versions were published by Sierra On-Line in 1986. Many reviewers noted similarities in themes and game mechanics to the Ultima series. Plot Title screen The land of Deledain was once ruled peacefully by four Lords, but war has ravaged their lands, and the evil wizard Denethenor now rules. The player takes on the role of a rogue who starts the game wanting to burglarize local farms and villages. However, solving puzzles and successfully fighting evil hordes leads the character to the ultimate confrontation with Denethenor in the land of Mystenor in order to restore peace to Deledain. Gameplay The only user input for character creation is the character's name. The character starts with 5 Strength, 5 Intelligence, 1000 hit points, 600 Stamina, 300 gold, and no items. There are a limited number of spells. The character learns about them by talking to non-player characters. There are eight grades of weapons to use, and four grades of armor. To attack an opponent, the player hits the TAB key (Apple II) or CTRL key (C64), then specifies the direction to attack, and whether to strike high, medium or low. Killing the opponent results in loot, both gold and items. The player must look for food to replenish Stamina, since all actions and spells deplete it. Food cannot be found, it must be purchased. Small amounts of gold are gained by defeating opponents. Larger amounts can be found in dungeon treasure chests. Characters can find an ongoing supply of money via burglary, an idea borrowed from Ultima III. Development Christopher Crim, in his final year of high school in Bishop, California in 1984, was already an experienced programmer, having designed and sold a customer database system written in BASIC to a local newspaper for $100. Crim was a big fan of Ultima II and Ultima III, and decided to create a similar style of game for the Apple II using 6502 assembly language. His high-school friend Kevin Christiansen built the graphic routines. The result was a top- down fantasy game called Wrath of Denethenor. After having his friends playtest it, Crim sold the game to Sierra On-Line, who asked him to also port it to the Commodore 64. The resulting game was published in 1986. Crim requested that Sierra reduce the price from the then-usual $50 to only $20, and also asked them to forgo any copy-protection. Reception In the May 1987 edition of Computer Gaming World, Scorpia called the game \\"well-crafted\\", but criticized it because \\"it offers nothing fresh (except perhaps in the way it handles hit points) to the RPG genre. It's just another hackneyed 'kill the evil wizard' game, with old Ultima-style playing and graphics, but little in the way of originality or ground-breaking design characteristics.\\" In the April 1987 edition of InterAction (Issue #2), the reviewer found to it be in \\"a quality program\\" despite its low price. The reviewer's biggest complaint was the \\"day-night cycle\\" used in the game where everything is closed at night, so the player is forced to wait until the sun rises to resume action ‚Äî the reviewer called it \\"an interesting idea, but can get irritating fast.\\" The reviewer also thought the game dragged in the middle stages, but called the grand finale \\"a masterpiece of programming\\" and gave the game an excellent rating of 10 out of 10. The retrospective website My Abandonware called the game \\"an above average fantasy title of its time.\\" Writing 30 years after its publication, retrospective game reviewer Chester Bolingbroke called the game \\"the most competent Ultima clone that we've seen... Difficult and complicated, it sometimes exceeds Ultima I‚ÄìII.\\" However, he found the game overly long and not overly original. Bolingbroke gave the game an average rating of 31 out of 50, saying \\"There was some really good work here, marred primarily by size, length, and inability to shortcut certain areas.\\" References Category:1986 video games Category:Apple II games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Wrath of Denethenor"},{"id":"63991113","text":"A Base 50 engine is a generic term for engines that are reverse-engineered from the Honda air-cooled four-stroke single cylinder engine.

The mountain is situated in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, on land managed by the Wenatchee National Forest. Its nearest higher neighbor is Buck Mountain, to the north. Brahma and Buck are set on Chiwawa Ridge, and other notable peaks on this ridge include Fortress Mountain, Cirque Mountain, Napeequa Peak, Mount Berge, Bandit Peak, and Chiwawa Mountain. Precipitation runoff from Brahma and meltwater from its glacier remnants drains into Chiwawa River and Napeequa River, both tributaries of the Wenatchee River. Topographic relief is significant since the southwest lavender-colored schist cliffs of this peak rise nearly 4,000 feet above the Napeequa River Valley in approximately one mile. Geology The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Brahma Peak centered The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is west- northwest of Brahma Peak, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Several glaciers lie on the slopes of Buck Mountain. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Climate Brahma Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

It was later revealed that the season would involve aliens. Regarding the decision to make aliens the villains of the season, Klemmer said this was to differentiate them from previous villains. He added, \\"To think about little green men with laser guns who just want to rule the world, you know, Marvin the Martian kinda shape, you're like, \\"Yes, that's what we need!\\" Not having to understand who our villains are on any kind of emotional scale means we can focus on the emotional stories of our characters\\".

The establishment describes Alpha as \\"the smallest village in America with a brewery\\". In 2019, the brewery ran out of beer after above-normal sales during the US Independence Day holiday. The brewery's beer names are all related to Alpha, its former Porter school, nearby Mastodon Township, or Iron County, the county of Alpha and Mastodon Township. Its business is also heavily locally focused. Its barley, oats, and some of its hops come from local farms, at least one of which is less than away, and , it donates US$1 of each beer sold to local initiatives and organizations. For example, during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the brewery donated US$200 plus 20% of their Saturday beer sales to three nearby St. Vincent de Paul locations.  Location  The brewery is at 303 E. Center St. in a former bus garage that is attached to Alpha's long-closed George F. Porter Public School. The school building is listed on the US National Register of Historic Places as part of the Alpha Public Buildings Historic Complex, all on a single block. The Porter School was last used as a school in 1967 and was sold by the village in 2005.

It compares the sexuality manifested by Germans during the period being divided into a Western and an Eastern part. The hypothesis manifested by scholars, interviews and footage is that sex was more free and women had more sexual pleasure in East Germany. The film discusses the possible reasons, considering the differences between the ideology and practical politics of a capitalist and a self-proclaimed communist regime. The film was produced by Ma.ja.de in association with television and radio broadcasters from different countries. Broadcast first on German television ARD in 2006, it was exhibited at the 2007 Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival and released on DVD in the United States and Japan in 2007 and 2008. The work has received a divided response; praised for its positive image of East Germany and for being humorous and informative simultaneously, it was criticized for its animation usage, not providing in-depth analyzes, and a lack of comprehensiveness for not treating non-heterosexual relationships. Content The documentary depicts and compares the sexual lives of people from West and East Germany during the period from the division in 1949 to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The comparison uses statistical data collected in the months following the fall of the wall on sex practice, age of start, partner numbers and orgasm achievement, and through opinions on abortion, dating, divorce, marriage, the pill, pornography and sex education. The main theories advanced are that sex in the East was \\"earlier, better, [and] more often\\" than in the West, and that women had more pleasure in the communist state, as evidenced by the fact that East German women reported having twice as many orgasms as their West counterparts. Among the reasons presented by the documentary is different attitudes towards sex caused by ideological reasons and practical politics. The West is described as under greater influence of traditional gender roles (i.e. women as housewives having certain duties to their husbands), the concept of family, a Church-driven morality, a taboo on discussing sex publicly or with children, a commercialization of sex (especially through pornography), and the idea of sex as a form of prestige. The East is characterized as more sexually liberal because of its disregard of gendered expectations of womanhood, its public sex education, desexualized practices of nudism adopted by 90% of the population, and women's independence. This independence is attributed to their high level of employment and the public child-care system, and its consequent higher level of gender equality in economic terms, but also to easier divorce processes and easier access to contraception and abortion. The documentary uses footage from the analyzed period and interviews conducted by the filmmakers with specialists in German history, culture and sexology: historians like Dagmar Herzog and Gisela Staupe, sex researcher and cultural studies researcher . The footage includes newsreel clips of sex education films and television programs, scenes of the everyday body, daily activities such as factory workers, people going to strip clubs, and DIY and amateur soft-core pornography. Interviews and footage are intertwined with sequences of square-headed cartoons. Production The documentary was written and directed by Andr√© Meier, an East German art historian with background as editor of art. Meier directed works about historical figures such as politician Walter Ulbricht and alchemist Johann Friedrich B√∂ttger for the public broadcaster Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR). It was produced by the film company Ma.ja.de in association with television and radio broadcasters from different countries: MDR (Germany), Arte (France), T√©l√©vision Suisse Romande (Switzerland), and SBS (Australia). The individual producers of the film were Heino Deckert, Ir√®ne Challand and Gaspard Lamuni√®re. The music was composed by Mario Krau√ü, photography was done by Andr√© B√∂hm, and Thomas Kleinw√§chter was its editor. The animation sequences were provided by Motionworks. Release and response The documentary was originally broadcast on German TV channel ARD on 27 November 2006. It was shown at the 2007 Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival as part of the program \\"Reconsidering the Postwar History of East and West Germany\\". The documentary was released in the United States in 2007 on DVD and VHS formats by Brooklyn-based distribution company First Run/Icarus Films. The original title, Liebte der Osten anders? Sex im geteilten Deutschland (translated as \\"Do Easterners love differently?\\" or \\"Did the East love differently? Sex in divided Germany\\"), was changed for the American distribution. In February 2008, it was broadcast nationwide in Australia by SBS. The film was released in Japan by Pandora on DVD on 21 June 2008. While films such as The Lives of Others and Good Bye, Lenin! were criticized for depicting a distorted picture of everyday life in East Germany, the documentary was noted for providing a positive image of the Eastern part. It won the Video Editing Award of the 2007 Prix CIRCOM Regional Programme Award given by the European Association of Regional Television. The jury report considered it to be \\"witty, funny and at the same time full of new information\\", and praised how the editing ensured a good pace and flow to the mix of archive footage, animation and interviews. David S. Hall, in a review for the Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality, called it \\"entertaining and informative\\" and said it is \\"a valuable addition to the history of sexuality\\", especially for the post-World War II period and because of its comparative nature. Jessica Schomberg, writing for Educational Media Reviews Online, commented it \\"provide[s] an often humorous, always informative comparison of Western and Communist sexual mores\\" and that it is useful for people studying sexual politics and sex education. Clare Morgan of The Sydney Morning Herald called it \\"frequently amusing\\". Kristen Ghodsee, in her book Red Hangover: Legacies of Twentieth-Century Communism, deemed it as a \\"wonderful reflection\\" on how capitalism and communism affected intimacy. Sophie Lewis, writing for The New Inquiry, called it \\"sharp and entertaining\\". Charles Mudede of The Stranger liked it, saying \\"The only thing bad\\" was the animation usage. Both Benita Blessing on H-Net and Anik√≥ Sz√ªcs, writing for Women & Performance, criticized the animation bits; the former commented that they did not provide any dramaturgical function being mere repetition of what is commented by interviewers, the latter said it occupied space that could be used to provide \\"in-depth analyses of the private and public topic of sexuality and sexual mores\\" but instead offered \\"facile stereotypes that all too often leave one cringing in embarrassment\\". Sz√ªcs was critical of it, saying \\"it falls short of its comprehensive promise\\", exhibits propagandistic and manipulative aspects and lacks any discussion on homosexual relationships. The focus on heterosexual and monogamous relationships was also highlighted by Blessing and SBS's Jim Poe. Blessing considered it to be \\"a welcome addition\\" to discussions on the topic and said it \\"belongs in any university library\\" but she noted it focused too much on women and did not approach men's relation to sex, while criticizing the usage of images without context to clarify whether they were Eastern or Western, without dates and source: \\"without explanation, they are at best mildly humorous windows into two societies, and at worst, they are unkind cheap shots of the most egregious kind\\". Leonardo Reviews Michael R. Mosher criticized how it ends \\"irresolutely, too quickly\\" without a final summary that clarifies its intentions.

Trajan replies that it is not fitting for him to grant Alexandrian citizenship, but inform Trajan of which part of Egypt the physician came from, so he can refer the matter to Planta, who was the current prefect of Egypt. Pliny mentions Planta in a letter to one Maximus, who had delivered several speeches against Planta.Epistulae IX.1 Pliny is concerned that now that Planta has died, he should hurry to publication those speeches so to avoid the appearance that he was attacking the man when he could defend himself.

A member of the ruling ZANU‚ÄìPF party, he also served as a Harare city councillor for Ward 31. In addition to his political career, he ran a private medical practice and lectured at the University of Zimbabwe.  Early life and education  Gwata was born in March 1943. Sources give his birth place as the Buhera/Chivhu area, in eastern Southern Rhodesia, and the southern area of Sengwe, near the border with South Africa. He attended Goromonzi High School from 1958 to 1963, before matriculating at the University of Rhodesia. Gwata had to leave mid- term in 1966 when the university closed temporarily due to political demonstrations on campus. In 1967, he began studying at Makerere University in Uganda on a World Health Organization scholarship. There, he was a research fellow in cardiology and graduated with a Master of Medicine degree in 1974.  Career  Medicine = After earning his degree, Gwata returned to Rhodesia where he worked as a government medical officer at Gatooma General Hospital in Gatooma from 1974 to 1976. In 1976, he became the first black full-time lecturer in medicine at the University of Rhodesia. He continued lecturing until his election as city councillor in 1981. In addition to teaching, Gwata operated his own private practice, Medical Polyclinic and Surgimed Pvt Ltd. = Politics = In late March 1981, Gwata was elected to the Salisbury City Council for Ward 31, which covered the township of Harare (renamed Mbare in 1982). Representing ZANU‚ÄìPF, he defeated two other candidates with a margin of over 1,000 votes. Gwata was one of 23 blacks elected to Salisbury's first multiracial city council, with the remaining 13 seats held by whites. In a city council vote held on 3 April 1981, he was unanimously elected mayor. He was sworn in on 7 April, becoming Salisbury's first black mayor. He succeeded Jack Whiting, the last white mayor, who said he was confident the white councillors would cooperate with their new black colleagues. Simplisius Chihambakwe was initially Gwata's deputy mayor, before being succeeded by Solomon Tawengwa in 1983. At his mayoral inauguration, a televised event attended by deputy prime minister Simon Muzenda, seven cabinet ministers, and several government officials, Gwata gave a speech in which he outlined a ten-point plan for his term as mayor. Most notably, he announced plans to change the capital city's name from Salisbury, which he described as \\"foreign\\", to Harare, after the African chief who ruled the area when the first white settlers arrived in 1890. The city was officially renamed in 1982, after working with the national government to resolve the issue of who would pay for associated costs, like changes in signage. As mayor, Gwata had to contend with an exodus of white municipal employees, which was particularly impactful where vacancies for skilled technical and administrative posts could not be immediately filled. On 12 October 1982, Gwata was criticized by the opposition ZAPU party after being quoted in The Herald as saying that members of the ruling ZANU‚ÄìPF party would be given hiring preference for municipal jobs. In response, Gwata made a statement affirming that municipal employees in Harare are selected without racial or political considerations. As mayor, Gwata addressed Harare's inconsistent water supply with the construction of a pipeline from Lake Chivero that more than doubled the size of the city's Morton Jaffray Water Works reservoir. During his term, the city's sewage system was also modernized, with the construction of two new large treatment facilities that transformed the city's waste into clean water. The treated refuse was then directed back into the rivers flowing into Lake Chivero, augmenting the city's water supply. Gwata was succeeded as mayor by Oliver Chidawu on 15 October 1984. He continued to serve on the city council representing Ward 31 as late as the 1990s. On 13 April 1991, he became an alderman, an honorary title awarded to councillors who have served ten years or more. As city councillor, Gwata chaired the health, housing, and community service committee. On behalf of the council, he served as the city representative on the board of the University of Zimbabwe, the city building committee, and other organizations. In 1994, Gwata was inaccurately reported as having received a farm from a scheme in which the Zimbabwean government seized 20 white-owned farms and distributed them to high-ranking government officials.. This was later refuted as inaccurate reporting as Gwata was found to have owned his farm from the 1980's.  Personal life  Gwata had five children with his wife Rosemary. The politician Charles Utete is Gwata's brother-in-law. He is Catholic.

He later was appointed Chair of the University's Chemistry Department. Early life and family John Carson was born in Philadelphia, the son of William Carson and Mary Hamilton, who had both emigrated earlier from Antrim in Northern Ireland. In Philadelphia, William was innkeeper of the \\"Harp and Crown,\\" a trustee of the Second Presbyterian Church, and a Committee of Safety and militia member during the American Revolutionary War. John was an early student at the Academy and College of Philadelphia, which had been founded in 1751 by several prominent local citizens, including Benjamin Franklin. He later graduated from the College of Philadelphia in 1771. Both institutions were precursors for what would become the University of Pennsylvania. Carson then attended the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, earning his M.D. in 1776 before later returning to Philadelphia to practice medicine. One of six children, John's sister, Elizabeth Carson, married the noted Revolutionary War hero Colonel Christian Febiger. Christian and Elizabeth had no children of their own, and adopted John's son by his Scottish wife, Agnes Hunter (Christian Carson, later changed his name to Christian Carson Febiger, father of Admiral John Carson Febiger). His other sister, Mary Carson, married another military hero, General James O'Hara (quartermaster), who later served as Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army. Both Febiger and O'Hara met their future wives at William Carson's \\"Harp & Crown\\" tavern. Career Following his medical school graduation, Dr. Carson remained in Edinburgh for some time and married. He later returned to his native Philadelphia, where he ran a sizable private practice and also assisted in setting up the Philadelphia Dispensary. In 1787, Dr. Carson was an original incorporator and Fellow of The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, where he was a contemporary of, and frequent correspondent with, the famed Dr. Benjamin Rush. In that same year, he was also named Surgeon of the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry. Dr. Carson was also elected a member of the American Philosophical Society, the Hibernian Society of Philadelphia, and Deputy Grand Master of the Masonic Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. In 1791, he was named to the Board of Trustees of his alma mater, the College of Philadelphia. In this role, he helped oversee the merger of the College with the University of the State of Pennsylvania, which created the University of Pennsylvania. Following the creation of the new University, Dr. Carson was chosen to stay on as a Trustee, a service he performed until 1794. That year he resigned to take the Chair of Chemistry in the University's Medical School, which had been left vacant by the death of his renowned predecessor, Dr. James Hutchinson. Unfortunately, Professor Carson was never able to formally assume these duties, having died from a peritonsillar abscess on October 26, 1794 at the age of 41. Dr. Carson was originally buried at the Arch Street Second Presbyterian Church Cemetery, but his remains were removed to Mount Vernon Cemetery in 1864 when the Arch Street Cemetery closed. His wife, Agnes, returned to Scotland following his death. Dr. Carson had been the father to ten children. Several of Carson's later relatives would go on to have long- standing affiliations with the University of Pennsylvania, including physician and botanist Dr. Joseph Carson (pharmacist), attorney Hampton L. Carson (lawyer), and evolutionary biologist Dr. Hampton L. Carson (biologist).

Stringer uses machine learning and deep neural networks to visualize large scale neural recordings and then probe the neural computations that give rise to visual processing in mice. Stringer has also developed several novel software packages that enable cell segmentation and robust analyses of neural recordings and mouse behavior.  Early life and education  In 2009, Stringer pursued her undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics and Physics at the University of Pittsburgh. She worked under the mentorship of Jonathan Rubin to design prostheses based on passive dynamic walking. She also learned to apply mathematical principles to model biological equilibrium dynamics. Stringer then moved to the United Kingdom in 2013 to conduct her graduate studies at the University College London. At UCL, Stringer in the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit under the mentorship of Kenneth D. Harris. Stringer combined her experience in mathematical modelling with her skills and knowledge in neuroscience to explore how multi-neuron recordings can be used to understand the population dynamics that reflect internal state and representations of external stimuli in the brain. Her recordings were performed in the rodent visual cortex and she used a variety of machine learning and dimensionality reduction techniques to explore the network level mechanisms that give rise to neural dynamics. Stringer also helped to develop the Suite2p software which has revolutionized the ability to process videos and computationally analyze the video recordings from in vivo calcium imaging.  Career and research  Following her PhD in 2018, Stringer began her postdoctoral work at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelia Research Campus. She worked under the mentorship of Marius Pachitariu and Karel Svboda to innovate novel ways to apply deep learning tools for object segmentation, image analyses, and extracting computational principles from large scale neural recordings. Stringer is now a Group Leader at Janelia and leads the Stringer Lab. Her team develops machine learning tools for neuroscientists and Stringer educates fellow scientists, through frequent workshops, on how to apply these tools in their own labs. The Stringer Lab also aims to fit biologically inspired deep network models to neural activity data gathered from the visual cortex to gain a better understanding of stimulus encoding in the visual cortex. Through large scale neural recordings, they have found that the neural responses to visual stimuli are high dimensional, and they are constantly innovating new ways to extract structure and understanding from this data through improved visualization software. One goal of the Stringer Lab is to understand how complex behaviors and sensory information are coded in the brain to drive decision making. = Principles of sensory encoding = During her graduate work, Stringer used large-scale neural recordings to explore the network-level mechanisms that govern intrinsic cortical dynamics. Since sensory coding in the cortex can be affected by noise correlations from intrinsic population dynamics, Stringer created a model that generated intrinsic correlated variability to probe what might underlie the variability in these cortical dynamics. She found that the strength of feedback inhibition in the model seemed to underlie the variability and in the neural data, putative inhibitory neurons seemed to be more active during times with weak noise correlations. Stringer‚Äôs results verified her network model for intrinsically generated variability and it emphasized the impact of inhibition in the modulation of noise correlations. = Data analysis tools = In 2017, Stringer and her colleagues developed Suite2p, a calcium imaging analysis pipeline that registers movies, detects active cells, extracts calcium traces, and infers spike times. It has a low computational load and can be run in Python and Matlab to allow detection of over 10,000 cells. This tool is now widely used in neuroscience for analysis of calcium imaging data. Another software program that Stringer and her colleagues built is Cellpose, a deep learning-based segmentation method that enables researchers to segment and identify cell bodies, membranes, and nuclei in microscopy images. Stringer and her team frequently retrain the model with user-provided images which constantly improves the tool allowing for unbiased and efficient detection of cellular objects. Stringer has also recently developed and implemented a behavioral analysis software called Facemap, which is essentially a toolbox with a graphical user interface that allows for automated extraction of orofacial behaviors in mice. Through this tool, Stringer explored whether neural ‚Äúnoise‚Äù previously reported during stimulus presentation is actually behaviorally driven as opposed to coding for previous sensory experiences. By monitoring facial expressions in mice and extracting them using Facemap, Stringer found that one third of population activity in the visual cortex could be predicted by a multidimensional model of the mouse‚Äôs facial patterns. Overall her experiments showed that behavioral state is widely encoded across nearly all neural populations in the forebrain and highlights the fact that neural activity that was once considered noise might be behavioral-state information. Stringer has also developed a non-linear embedding algorithm for high-dimensional data called Rastermap. This tool enables visualization of high-dimensional data. It sorts neural spikes or calcium signals and ranks them by similarity to enable visualization in a graphical user interface. = Optimization of calcium imaging analyses = Calcium imaging is a powerful tool in neuroscience and Stringer has been committed to exploring ways to improve its utility through analysis pipeline optimization. Stringer has provided the field with critical knowledge to improve the utility and power of calcium imaging data. She helped to elucidate that non-negative deconvolution (NND) was the best approach when inferring spike times from calcium imaging. Further, the NND method proved to be faster and less biased than alternative supervised methods. Stringer took a deeper dive into all of the computational weaknesses along the data processing pipeline for calcium imaging (motion registration, ROI extraction, spike deconvolution, and quality control) and she proposed computational solutions to these unique problems that arise in calcium imaging analysis. Her work is critical as it shines a light on the many ways that calcium imaging analyses can produce biases that lead to inaccurate scientific interpretations.

He also played football as an amateur for the Royal Engineers, appearing in the 1878 FA Cup Final. Family and education Morris was born on 12 February 1847 at Malagaum Camp, near Kumta in the Bombay Presidency, India where his father, William John Morris (1809‚Äì1870) was a lieutenant-colonel in the Bombay Army. His mother was Georgiana n√©e Cunningham (1824‚Äì1900). Morris was educated at Cheltenham College, before joining the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Football career Morris played football for both Cheltenham College and the Royal Military Academy, before joining the Royal Engineers in 1867. Although Morris is mentioned in a report on a match in December 1868 (\\"Lieut. Morris got off and dribbling the ball quite round his opponents, brought it in front of the goal and a kick from Lieut Dorward scored the first goal for the Royal Engineers\\" and \\"for the Engineers Lieut Morris ...(was) particularly conspicuous\\"), he was not a member of any of the regiment's teams which reached the FA Cup Finals in 1872 and 1874 and won the trophy in 1875. By the time of the 1878 FA Cup Final, Morris was \\"approaching the veteran stage\\", being aged 31. The cup final was played at Kennington Oval on 23 March 1878, against the Wanderers, who had won the cup in the two previous seasons, with Morris selected at full-back. The Wanderers took an early lead through Jarvis Kenrick, before the Engineers gradually came back into the match. In the 20th minute, the ball went out of play close to the Wanderers' goal-line. Morris took the ensuing throw-in, delivering the ball into the goalmouth, from where it was bundled across the line for an equalising goal. Some modern sources state that Morris actually scored the goal, although contemporary newspaper reports in The Field, The Sporting Life and Bell's Life in London all state that Morris took the throw-in which led to a \\"scrimmage\\" or \\"bully\\" in front of the Wanderers' goal. Although the \\"Sappers\\" continued to put up a hard fight, they were unable to prevent the Wanderers scoring twice more, thus winning their third consecutive FA Cup with a final score of 3‚Äì1. Military career Morris was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 10 July 1867, spending his early years training at Chatham and Aldershot. On 21 October 1871, he was sent to Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean, remaining there until 9 January 1874, during which time he met Lord Lindsay and David Gill who were preparing to observed the transit of Venus later that year, in order to obtain new data to measure the distance between the earth and the sun. During their brief encounter, Morris was able to build a relationship with Gill, such that he and Gill collaborated on the next mission to observe the transit eight years later, and subsequently in the survey of South Africa. On returning to England in 1874, he entered the Staff College, graduating with honours at the beginning of 1876. In July 1877, he was appointed Assistant Instructor in Surveying at the Royal School of Military Engineering at Chatham, Kent, where he remained for five years. He was promoted to captain on 29 October 1879. In 1882‚Äì83, he was in charge of the British expedition based in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia to study the Transit of Venus, under the overall command of David Gill. In Queensland, Morris was accompanied by Lieutenant Leonard Darwin (the son of Charles Darwin) and Cuthbert Peek (later 2nd Baronet) and Peek's assistant, Charles Grover. The party were based at Jimbour, 150 miles north-west of Brisbane, where they spent six weeks in November/December 1882. Despite observing a large number of double stars and clusters, the party failed in their mission to observe the actual transit of Venus on 7 December because of cloud cover. On his return to London in 1883, Morris worked for two months on special duty under the Colonial Office, before being directed to lead a party to South Africa to carry out a geodetic survey (calculating the dimensions and shape of the Earth) of the Cape Colony and Natal, under the overall direction of David Gill, who was now H.M. Astronomer at the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope. Morris and his team of 15, including Lieut. Henry Laffan, the son of the late Sir Robert Laffan, arrived in Durban in June 1883, and commenced the survey by measuring a 3 km. baseline near the Umgeni River, between Pietermaritzburg and Greytown. By the end of 1883, the party had surveyed a chain of points between Newcastle and Kokstad, a distance of approximately . Through 1884 and early 1885, the team continued their survey, connecting the chain to Pietermaritzburg and Durban, before the Natal government became concerned about the cost and slow progress of the survey. As a result Laffan and four NCOs were transferred to undertake a less costly and less accurate mapping survey, leaving Morris to continue the geodetic survey with a reduced party of assistants. By March 1886, Morris had extended his survey through the Transkei to King William's Town, where they linked up with the survey undertaken by Captain William Bailey in 1859. During late 1886, the party was again reduced for financial reasons, leaving Morris with only five NCOs to continue the survey. By November 1887, the reduced party had managed to re-survey Bailey's chain as far as Port Elizabeth, and on to Caledon where in June 1890 they connected to the arc of the meridian surveyed by Sir Thomas Maclear in the 1840s. Morris continued the survey until field work was halted in September 1892, after which he returned to Cape Town, to write up his report, before returning to England in October 1893. During his time in South Africa, Morris was promoted major on 31 December 1886 and to lieutenant colonel on 14 July 1893. On 3 June 1893, Morris was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) \\"for services connected with the Geodetic Survey of the Colonies of the Cape of Good Hope and Natal\\". In his 1896 report of the survey, David Gill included Morris's work, with this praise for Morris: > Colonel Morris' services have been such as very few men have the combined > physique and capacity to render; these services have been given by him with > unstinted disregard of his own comfort, and with a thoroughness and > heartiness which only love of the work and a high sense of duty could > inspire. On his return to England, Morris was placed in command of the Training Battalion at Chatham, becoming assistant commander of the entire school from 1895 to July 1898. On 22 June 1897, Morris was in command of the battalion of Royal Engineers present at the procession to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee for which he received the Queen Victoria Diamond Jubilee Medal. Morris was promoted to brevet colonel on 14 July 1897. On 22 July 1898, Morris was appointed colonel on the staff of the Royal Engineers and returned to South Africa, acting as district inspector based at Cape Town during the Second Boer War. According to his obituary in The Times, Morris was frustrated during this period that \\"no use whatever was made of his unique knowledge of the topography of Cape Colony\\". Despite this, he was twice mentioned in dispatches for \\"special and meritorious service\\". During his time in Cape Town, Morris and his staff arranged for the construction of lines of blockhouses across the war zone. For his services in South Africa during the Boer war, Morris was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) from 29 November 1900. After the war, in November 1902 Morris again linked up with David Gill, when he was appointed Superintendent of the Ordnance Survey of Transvaal and Orange River Colony, with Gill acting as scientific adviser. Morris supervised the measurement of five baselines and eight geodetic chains, comprising 178 triangles. Morris retired from the army on half-pay in February 1904, continuing in his post as a civilian. The fieldwork was completed in July 1906, following which Morris wrote up his reports before returning to England in early 1907. According to the Biographical Database of Southern African Science, Morris's \\"contribution to surveying in South Africa was extensive and of lasting value, and carried out with enthusiasm and devotion to duty\\". After his death, one of Morris's assistants in South Africa, Victor Lowinger wrote: > Morris was devoted to his work and inspired all who worked under him with > the values of thoroughness and accuracy. He chose his men carefully and > trusted them to get on with the job, while at the same time he was always > ready to resolve any difficulties that arose. He was of a very reserved > nature and, though a little intolerant of human weaknesses, very just in his > judgements‚Äîa man with whom one has been proud to have been associated in one > of his great practical contributions to geodesy. In the 1907 Birthday Honours, Morris was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) \\"in recognition of services as Superintendent of the Trigonometrical Survey of the Transvaal and Orange River Colonies\\". Marriage and children On 27 April 1871, Morris married Edith Sophia Tireman (1849‚Äì1917) at St Margaret's Church at Bowers Gifford in Essex, where the bride's father, the Revd. William Tireman was the parish priest. The wedding ceremony was conducted by The Right Reverend Thomas Claughton, Bishop of Rochester, a friend of the bride's father. The couple had four children: * Guy Brooke Morris (1874‚Äì1904) * Winifred Morris (1875‚Äì1962) * Lionel Tireman Morris (1876‚Äì1920) * Hugh Cunningham Morris (1878‚Äì1972) Winifred was first married to Colonel Alfred Digby Legard (1878‚Äì1939) and then to Lieut.-Colonel George Henry Addison (1876‚Äì1964), whose father, George William Addison had played football for the Royal Engineers in the 1872 and 1874 FA Cup Finals. Following Edith's death on 7 January 1917, William Morris married Ethel Joan Warren (1866‚Äì1956), daughter of the late Mr. Robert Warren of Gosford Pines near Ottery St. Mary in Devon, at St. Gabriel's Church in Warwick Square, London on 4 July 1917. Retirement and death On returning to the United Kingdom in 1907, Morris retired to Betws-y-Coed in North Wales, living firstly at \\"Fron Heulog\\" before settling at \\"Islwyn\\". He died at \\"Islwyn\\" on 26 February 1935, aged 88, and was buried at St Michael's Church at Betws-y-Coed .

This article covers the many design types, most notably the articulated, double-decker, drop-centre, low-floor, single ended, double-ended, rubber -tired, and tram-train; and the various uses of trams, both historical and current, most notably cargo trams, a dog car, hearse tram, maintenance trams, a mobile library service, a nursery tram, a restaurant tram, a tourist tram, and as mobile offices.  Types of Tram Designs Articulated= joints, as seen in Toronto. Articulated trams, invented and first used by the Boston Elevated Railway in 1912‚Äì13 at a total length of about twelve meters long (40 ft) for each pioneering example of twin-section articulated tram car, have two or more body sections, connected by flexible joints and a round platform at their pivoting midsection(s). Like articulated buses, they have increased passenger capacity. In practice, these trams can be up to long (such as CAF Urbos 3 in Budapest, Hungary), while a regular tram must be much shorter. With this type, the articulation is normally suspended between carbody sections. In the ≈†koda ForCity, which is the world's first 100% low floor tram with pivoting bogies, a Jacobs bogie supports the articulation between the two or more carbody sections. An articulated tram may be low-floor variety or high (regular) floor variety. Newer model trams may be up to long and carry 510 passengers at a comfortable . At crush loadings this would be even higher. =Double Decker= Hong Kong Tramways fleet is entirely made up of double-decker trams. A double- decker tram is a tram that has two levels. Some double-decker trams have open tops. The earliest double-deck trams were horse drawn. The first electric double-deck trams were those built for the Blackpool Tramway in 1885, one of which survives at the National Tramway Museum. Double decker trams were commonplace in Great Britain and Dublin in Ireland before most tramways were torn up in the 1950s and 1960s. New York City's New York Railways experimented in 1912 with a Brill double deck Hedley-Doyle stepless centre entrance car, nicknamed the \\"Broadway Battleship\\", a term that spread to other large streetcars. Hobart, Tasmania, Australia made extensive use of double decker trams. The most unusual double-decker tram used to run between the isolated Western Australian outback town of Leonora and the nearby settlement of Gwalia. Double decker trams still operate in Alexandria, Blackpool, Hong Kong, Dubai and Oranjestad. =Drop-Centre (lowered central section)= Many early 20th century trams used a lowered central section between the bogies (trucks). This made passenger access easier, reducing the number of steps required to reach the inside of the vehicle. These cars were frequently referred to as \\"drop-centres\\". It is believed that the design first originated in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1906 when Boon & Co Ltd. built twenty-six such trams in three series. A number of these trams have been preserved. They were a favored design in Australia and New Zealand, with at least 780 such tramcars being built for use in Melbourne alone. Trams built since the 1970s have had conventional high or low floors. =Low floor= The low-floor ≈†koda 15 T use a pivoting bogie in order to help the tram pivot on curved tracks. From around the 1990s, light rail vehicles not made for the occasional high platform light rail system have usually been of partial or fully low-floor design, with the floor above top of rail, a capability not found in older vehicles. This allows them to load passengers, including those in wheelchairs or with perambulators directly from low-rise platforms that are not much more than raised footpaths/sidewalks. This satisfies requirements to provide access to disabled passengers without using expensive wheelchair lifts, while at the same time making boarding faster and easier for other passengers. Passengers appreciate the ease of boarding and alighting from low-floor trams and moving about inside one hundred per cent low-floor trams. Passenger satisfaction with low- floor trams is high. In some jurisdictions this has even been made mandatory since the 1990s, for example by Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate in Britain and the Disability Discrimination Act in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries. Various companies have developed low-floor designs, varying from part-low-floor (with internal steps between the low-floor section and the high-floor sections over the bogies), e.g. Citytram and Siemens S70, to one hundred per cent low-floor, where the floor passes through a corridor between the drive wheels, thus maintaining a constant (stepless) level from end to end of the tram. Prior to the introduction of the ≈†koda ForCity,, that carried the mechanical penalty of requiring bogies to be fixed and unable to pivot (except for less than 5 degrees in some trams) and thus reducing curve negotiation. This creates undue wear on the tracks and wheels. Low-floor trams are now running in many cities around the world, including Adelaide, Amsterdam, Bratislava, Dublin, Gold Coast, Helsinki, Hiroshima, Houston, Istanbul, Melbourne, Milan, Prague, Sydney, Lviv and many others. The Ultra- Low Floor or (ULF) tram is a type of low-floor tram operating in Vienna, Austria, as of 1997 and in Oradea, Romania, with the lowest floor-height of any such vehicle. In contrast to other low-floor trams, the floor in the interior of ULF is at sidewalk height (about 18 cm or 7 inches above the road surface), which makes access to trams easy for passengers in wheelchairs or with baby carriages. This configuration required a new undercarriage. The axles had to be replaced by a complicated electronic steering of the traction motors. Auxiliary devices are installed under the car's roof. Most low-floor trams carry the mechanical penalty of requiring bogies to be fixed and unable to pivot. This creates undue wear on the tracks and wheels and reduces the speed at which a tram can drive through a curve. Some manufacturers such as Alstom deal with the issue by introducing partially high floor trams. Others, such as ≈†koda, developed pivoting bogies at the ends and with jacobs bogies between the articulations for the ≈†koda 15 T, but this solution proved expensive. =Single-ended and Double-ended Trams= A double-ended tram has an operator's cab and controls at each end of the vehicle, which allows it to easily be driven at full speed in either direction on a continuous segment of track. Typically, at the end of a run, the tram's operator will walk from one end of the tram to the other, and then commence the tram route in the other direction. The tram is usually switched to another track by use of crossover points or Y-points. Conversely, a single-ended vehicle needs a method of turning at termini so that the operator's cab is in the front of the tram for the reverse journey. This usually necessitates a turning loop or triangle. On the other hand, the single cab and controls and fewer door spaces make the tram lighter, increases passenger accommodation (including many more seats) and effects reductions in equipment, weight, first-cost, maintenance cost, and operating expense. A single-ended tram has operator's controls at only one end, and can safely be driven at speed in the forward direction but is also capable of reverse movement, typically at slower speed, using a small set of controls at the rear. The configuration of the doors is usually asymmetrical, favouring the side expected to be closest to the street kerb and footpath. At the end of a run, the tram must be turned around via a balloon loop or some other method, to face in the opposite direction for a return trip. In addition, if overhead electrical power is fed from a trolley pole, the direction of the trolley pole must be reversed at the end of the run, to ensure that the pole is \\"pulled\\" behind or \\"trailing\\" the vehicle, to avoid 'dewiring'. This was achieved by a member of the crew swinging the pole through 180 degrees (if there was only one pole) or lowering one pole and raising the other if there were two. More commonly nowadays, a bidirectional pantograph may be used to feed power, eliminating the need for an extra procedure when reversing direction. Two single-ended trams with doors on both sides may be coupled into a (semi-)permanently coupled married pair or twinset, with operator's controls at each end of the combination. Such a setup is operated as if it were a double-ended tram, except that the operator must exit one vehicle and enter the other, when reversing at the end of the run. =Rubber-tyred tram= Rubber tyres used for the Translohr rubber-tyred trams. Rubber-tyred trams are trams that are guided by fixed rail, but also make use of rubber tyres. A rubber-tyred tram is a guided bus which is guided by a fixed rail on the ground and uses overhead cables like a conventional tram. This can allow the vehicles to match the capacity of conventional trams and cope with gradients up to 13% due to the rubber tyres. There are two systems which use this technology: the Guided Light Transit (GLT) and Translohr. The GLT \\"trams\\" are legally considered buses as they have steering wheels and can leave the fixed rail when requirements dictate e.g. when journeying to a depot while a Translohr \\"tram\\" cannot operate without a guidance rail and are generally not considered buses. With the development of technologies for self-guided vehicles, it is now possible to dispense with the guide rail. The Autonomous Rail Rapid Transit system planned for Zouzhou in China follows a virtual track. =Other designs=Modern styling The Socimi Eurotram series was developed by Socimi of Italy. It is used by Strasbourg, Milan, and Porto. The Eurotram has a modern design that makes it look as much like a train as a tram and has large windows along its entire length.Porto:Metro from NYCsubway.org. Retrieved 15 February 2009. Modular design The Alstom Citadis tram, flagship of the French manufacturer Alstom, enjoys an innovative design combining lighter bogies with a modular concept for carriages providing more choices in the types of windows and the number of cars and doors.Georges Dobias, \\"Urban Transport in France\\" Japan Railway & Transport Review, 16 June 1998.

Retrieved 15 February 2009.  Uses of Trams Cargo Tram= Since the 19th century, goods have been carried on rail vehicles through the streets, often near docks and steelworks, for example the Weymouth Harbour Tramway in Weymouth, Dorset. Belgian vicinal tramway routes were used to haul agricultural produce, timber, and coal from Bl√©gny colliery while several of the US interurbans carried freight. In Australia, three different \\"Freight Cars\\" operated in Melbourne between 1927 and 1977\\"Destination City. Electric Rolling Stock of the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board\\", various editions, Australian Electric Traction Association, Melbourne. and the city of Kislovodsk in Russia had a freight-only tram system consisting of one line which was used exclusively to deliver bottled Narzan mineral water to the railway station. CarGoTram run by Volkswagen in Dresden. Trams operated by the service are used to carry freight, as opposed to passengers. Today, the German city of Dresden has a regular CarGoTram service, run by the world's longest tram trainsets (), carrying car parts across the city centre to its Volkswagen factory. In addition to Dresden, the cities of Vienna and Z√ºrich currently use trams as mobile recycling depots. At the turn of the 21st century, a new interest has arisen in using urban tramway systems to transport goods. The motivation now is to reduce air pollution, traffic congestion and damage to road surfaces in city centres. One recent proposal to bring cargo tramways back into wider use was the plan by City Cargo Amsterdam to reintroduce them into the city of Amsterdam. In the spring of 2007 the city piloted this cargo tram operation, which among its aims aimed to reduce particulate pollution in the city by 20% by halving the number of lorries (5,000) unloading in the inner city during the permitted timeframe from 07:00 till 10:30. The pilot involved two cargo trams, operating from a distribution centre and delivering to a \\"hub\\" where special electric trucks delivered the trams' small containers to their final destination. The trial was successful, releasing an intended investment of ‚Ç¨100 million in a fleet of fifty-two cargo trams distributing from four peripheral \\"cross docks\\" to fifteen inner-city hubs by 2012. These specially built vehicles would be long with twelve axles and a payload of . On weekdays, trams are planned to make 4 deliveries per hour between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. and two per hour between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. With each unloading operation taking on average 10 minutes, this means that each site would be active for 40 minutes out of each hour during the morning rush hour. In early 2009 the scheme was suspended owing to the financial crisis impeding fund- raising.\\"Samenwest\\" 5 December 2006, NOS3 television news 7 March 2007, Amsterdams Stadblad 4 June 2008 =Dog Car= In 1937, Melbourne passenger tramcar C class number 30 was converted for transporting dogs and their owners to the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds. It was known as the \\"dog car\\" and was scrapped in 1955.Kings, Keith S. \\"Transcriptions of Preston Workshops Tramcar Record Cards\\", various pp. =Hearse tram= Hearse trams in Paris. Trams were used as hearses in the late 19th and early 20th century. Specially appointed hearse trams, or funeral trolley cars, were used for funeral processions in many cities in the late 19th and early 20th century, particularly cities with large tram systems. The earliest known example in North America was Mexico City, which was already operating twenty-six funeral cars in 1886.Middleton, William D. (1967). The Time of the Trolley, pp. 93‚Äì97. Milwaukee: Kalmbach Publishing. . In the United States, funeral cars were often given names. At the turn of the century, \\"almost every major city [in the US] had one or more\\" such cars in operation. In Milan, Italy, hearse trams were used from the 1880s (initially horse-drawn) to the 1920s. The main cemeteries, Cimitero Monumentale and Cimitero Maggiore, included funeral tram stations. Additional funeral stations were located at Piazza Firenze and at Porta Romana.Giornale della Reale societ√† italiana d'igiene, Seduta del 5 febbrajo 1882, Archive.org In the mid-1940s at least one special hearse tram was used in Turin, Italy. It was introduced due to the wartime shortage of automotive fuel. Newcastle, Australia also operated two hearse trams between 1896 and 1948. =Maintenance tram= A custom-built snow removal tram in Bucharest. It uses a rotating brush to push the snow aside from the tracks. Most systems had cars that were converted to specific uses on the system, other than simply the carriage of passengers. As just one example of a system, Melbourne used or uses the following \\"technical\\" cars: a ballast motor, ballast trailers, blow-down cars, breakdown cars, conductors' or drivers' instruction cars, a laboratory testing car, a line marking car, a pantograph testing car, per way locomotives, a rail hardener locomotive, a scrapper car, scrubbers, sleeper carriers, track cleaners, a welding car, and a wheel transport car. Some were built new for specific purposes, including: rail grinders, scrubbers/track cleaners, and a workshops locomotive. =Mobile library service= Munich tram No.24, delivered in 1912, was refurbished as a mobile library in 1928. Known as \\"St√§dtische Wanderb√ºcherei M√ºnchen\\", it was in public service until 1970. It was preserved and is now on public display in a railway museum in Hanover.Munich tramway, Retrieved 2012-02-11 Edmonton, Alberta, used a streetcar bookmobile from 1941 to 1956. =Nursery tram= After World War II, in both Warsaw and Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, so-called \\"tram-nurseries\\" were in operation, collecting children from the workplaces of their parents (often tram employees). These mobile nurseries either carried the children around the system or delivered them to the nursery school run by the transport company. =Restaurant tram= Interior of the Colonial Tramcar Restaurant. The company uses three converted trams as restaurant trams. A number of systems have introduced restaurant trams, particularly as a tourist attraction. This is specifically a modern trend. Systems which have or have had restaurant trams include Adelaide, Bendigo and Melbourne, in Australia; Brussels in Belgium; The Hague in the Netherlands; Christchurch in New Zealand;The service is operating again after being suspended for a few years following Christchurch's 2010 earthquake Milan, Rome and Turin in Italy; Moscow, Russia; Almaty, Kazakhstan and Z√ºrich, Switzerland. Restaurant trams are particularly popular in Melbourne where they operate as the Colonial Tramcar Restaurant. Three of the iconic W class trams were converted to restaurant tram since 1983. All three often run in tandem and there are usually multiple meal sittings. Bookings often close months in advance. As from mid-October 2018, Melbourne's restaurant trams were temporarily taken off the road after failing a Yarra Trams' safety assessment due to badly weathered underlying structures. Until the trams again meet safety standards, the trams are offering stationary dining.Colonial Tramcar Restaurant services halted Railway Digest December 2018 page 54 As at October 2019, they were still not running.Melbourne's famous tram restaurant sues Yarra Trams The Age 15 October 2019 Bistro trams with buffets operated on ordinary services between 1924 and 2014 on the U76 Rheinbahn route between Krefeld and D√ºsseldorf in Germany, and for a brief period in 1911 on the Amsterdam-Zandvoort line. =Tourist tram= heritage tram operated by Tranv√≠a de S√≥ller. Heritage trams are operated to draw tourists and tram enthusiasts. Many systems have retained historical trams which will often run over parts of the system for tourists and tram enthusiasts. In Melbourne, Australia, several iconic W class trams run throughout the city in a set route which circles the Central Business District. They are primarily for the use of tourists, although often also used by regular commuters. =Tram-train= A tram-train is a light-rail public transport system where trams run through from an urban tramway network to main-line railway lines which are shared with conventional trains. This allows passengers to travel from suburban areas into city-centre destinations without having to change from a train to a tram. Tram-train operation uses vehicles such as the Flexity Link and Regio-Alstom Citadis, which are suited for use on urban tram lines and also meet the necessary indication, power, and strength requirements for operation on main-line railways. It has been primarily developed in Germanic countries, in particular Germany and Switzerland. Karlsruhe is a notable pioneer of the tram-train. =Contractors' mobile office= Two former passenger cars from the Melbourne system were converted and used as mobile offices within the Preston Workshops between 1969 and 1974, by personnel from Commonwealth Engineering and ASEA who were connected with the construction of Melbourne's Z Class cars.

It depicts the Greek Titan Prometheus stealing fire from the heavens to give to humans. It was commissioned for Pomona College's Frary Dining Hall and completed in June 1930, becoming the first modern fresco in the United States. It has received widespread critical acclaim. Description The mural is above a fireplace at the north end of Frary's refectory. It consists of four panels: a main one facing the open eating area of the dining hall, two side ones, and an overhead one. The Greek mythology Titan Prometheus dominates the main panel, reaching for fire to give to humans, an act for which he would later be punished by Zeus. Surrounding his muscular, contorted figure is a crowd of people reacting to the gift, with some welcoming it and others scorning it. The color palette features heavy use of reds, blues, and black. Production The mural was commissioned for Pomona College's newly built neo-Gothic men's dining hall by its architect, Sumner Spaulding, and professor of art history and Hispanic studies . Students helped to raise $300 of Orozco's artist fee of $2500 (). Orozco stayed on campus for three months to complete the mural, living in a Clark dormitory, eating meals at Frary, and using students as models. He was assisted in the painting by Jorge Juan Crespo de la Serna, particularly with the side panels. Interpretation Art historians generally interpret the mural to be a metaphor for the challenges often faced by those seeking to expand the realm of knowledge, particularly from conservative authority figures. The varying reactions of the crowd around Prometheus depicts that human development comes with both costs and benefits. This theme connects to the mural's collegiate setting. It also had personal resonance for Orozco, who faced resistance throughout his life from those opposed to his leftist political views. The subject of fire was of interest to him because of a fireworks mishap in which he lost his left hand when he was 21. Reception and influence Prometheus received immediate critical acclaim upon completion. It was the first major work by a Mexican muralist in the United States, and helped Orozco, who was relatively unknown at the time, to subsequently land two other U.S. commissions, a mural room at The New School in New York City and The Epic of American Civilization at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. He would later become known as one of the \\"big three\\" of the Mexican Mural Renaissance. It heavily influenced abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock, who called it \\"the greatest painting in North America\\". Spaulding, Frary's architect, said \\"I feel as though the building would fall down if the fresco were removed.\\" Among contemporary students, it is often noted for its conspicuous lack of a penis; Orozco likely omitted it to avoid offending puritanical sensibilities. Preservation and restoration Pomona has undertaken various preservation and restoration efforts over the years. In 1980, a protective varnish was applied over the mural. In 1982, structural damage was discovered in the wall behind the mural; it was subsequently reinforced. In 1995, it was restored after being damaged by vandals. In 2000, the college acquired preparatory drawings for the work from Orozco's relatives.

It was arranged by Hockey Canada in co-operation with the National Hockey League and the Canadian Hockey League, in response to Canadian national ice hockey teams struggling and a general panic in Canada. The summit's primary focus was player development in Canada, and was targeted at league executives, parents, coaches and hockey associations. Discussions produced a list of 11 recommendations to improve hockey in Canada, which included a campaign aimed at Canadian parents on why players needed more practices than games. The summit's recommendations ultimately led to fundamental changes in how Canadian players were trained. Background Canadian national ice hockey teams had struggled leading up to 1999, and there was a general panic in Canada. The Canada men's national ice hockey team placed fourth at the 1998 Winter Olympics and sixth at the 1998 IIHF World Championship. The Canada women's national ice hockey team lost the gold medal game at the 1998 Winter Olympics, and the Canada men's national junior ice hockey team placed eighth in at the 1998 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Women's national team player Cassie Campbell felt there too much panic after 1998 Winter Olympics, since it was only one game that was lost. Men's national team player Trevor Linden felt there was no reason to panic, but it would be good to find ways to improve minor ice hockey, and that Canadians thought no other country should have players as good as Canada. Planning Hockey Hall of Fame The Open Ice Summit was scheduled for August 25 to 27, 1999, in Toronto, and arranged by Hockey Canada in co-operation with the National Hockey League (NHL) and the Canadian Hockey League (CHL). Molson Brewery was the title sponsor for the summit, and Bob Nicholson was the lead administrator behind the summit. Delegates to the event included the Hockey Canada and CHL membership in addition to representatives from the NHL and the National Hockey League Players' Association. The summit's primary focus was to discuss player development in Canada, and was targeted at league executives, parents, coaches and hockey associations.

He felt that skill was more important to develop than talent, and that Canada had the potential to be world leaders in skill development. A theme of the summit was that more practices would be better than playing games, and it would be difficult to convince Canadian parents who want to see their child play. Canada men's national team head coach Dave King advocated for more time to practice skills compared to playing time. He compared the Canadian system which looked for physical size first and introduced body contact at a young age, where as the European system looked for skills first, practiced three times as much as the Canadian model, and did not have body contact in youth hockey. Detroit Red Wings head coach Scotty Bowman noted that European players on his team looked forward to practices and were better prepared. Journalist Pierre LeBrun criticized the Canadian system for playing too many games and children not practicing enough to develop skill, and that junior ice hockey was overseen by the CHL, which was a profit-driven business. Bob Nicholson felt it necessary to find a balance since both practice and business were important. Writer Michael McKinley stated that delegates generally wanted to see a less rigid structure at younger age groups, and to let kids have fun and try new things without repercussions for mistakes. Toronto Maple Leafs president Ken Dryden wanted delegates to accept that progress made at the lower levels and off the ice was important in achieving international results. Recommendations alt=Photo of Ken Dryden The summit produced 11 recommendations to improve Canadian hockey. Ken Dryden and Bob Nicholson were cautious that change would come slowly and be costly, but felt the summit was an important step in making progress. The 11 recommendations were: #System of mentor coaches for minor ice hockey associations, with one professional coach per twenty amateur coaches #Number of games should not be greater than the number of practices #Adjust age limits so the same players are not always the oldest in each group #Educate importance of skills development and give recognition for skills #Expand marketing and education aimed at first-time players #Provide more coaching education including online modules #Examine raising the age for draft eligible players #Educate public on having respect for all participants, the rules and the sport #Educate all hockey participants on the recommendations resulting from the Open Ice Summit #Co-operation between hockey associations, school boards, and sponsors to improve sports in school #Improve communication between hockey partners on program developments Subsequent events alt=Players celebrating on ice Hockey Canada and the Ontario Hockey Federation planned meetings to follow-up on the recommendations, and to brainstorm methods of implementation. Ontario Hockey League executive Sherwood Bassin wanted to see more education aimed at parents for the rationale behind more practices than games. Hockey Canada distributed bulletins to its members on the summit's recommendations, and held discussion forums on them. Nicholson encouraged players, parents coaches to provide feedback and participate online. Dryden believed that in 20 years, privately run sports schools would be teaching the game. The summit's recommendations ultimately led to fundamental changes in how players were trained. Dryden urged for the end to persistent abuse of on-ice officials, or Canada would lose 10,000 referees each year. Hockey Canada started to educate on respect for game officials as a result of the summit. The NHL was also concerned that referee abuse led to decreasing numbers, and deterred those from becoming higher-level referees. Nicholson contemplated arranging a summit every four years after the Olympics. The next summit arranged by Hockey Canada was the World Hockey Summit in 2010. In the eleven years from 1999 to 2010, Canada national teams had won five of six gold medals in ice hockey at Winter Olympics, and five of six World Juniors championships.

The company own prestigious trademark Bohemia Crystal. The main production plant is in Nov√Ω Bor, the second is in Karolinka. Original Karolinka plant was built in the 19th century, when the greatest development of glass production took place. History Crystalex in Nov√Ω Bor In 1948, the national enterprise Borocrystal was established, uniting 55 original small establishments and glassworks. In 1953, by joining Umƒõleck√° sklo was established even larger national company Borsk√© sklo. In 1967, the construction of a new production facility in Nov√Ω Bor was completed, the construction was carried out by an association of Yugoslav companies. In 1974, the company changed its name to Crystalex. At that time, Crystalex united most of the Czech glassworks producing utility glass. After 1989, a number of state-owned enterprises became independent and were privatized. The company in Nov√Ω Bor was transformed into a joint-stock company. In 2008, Crystalex had four production plants: Nov√Ω Bor, Karolinka, Hostomice nad B√≠linou and Vrbno pod Pradƒõdem and had a turnover of about CZK 1.5 billion. Then, however, during the financial crisis it went bankrupt. In August 2009, the CBC Invest glass group, backed by Russian and Slovak capital, represented by the Czech businessman Ji≈ô√≠ Hudera, bought production plants in Nov√Ω Bor and Karolinka for CZK 362.7 million and transformed it into a private limited company. Since then, the new owners have invested another roughly 200 million crowns not only in the renewal of production and technology, but also in the modernization of the complex. Audition insolvency proceedings at the Crystalex ended after ten years. The company regularly reported a profit and sales were around one billion CZK.
