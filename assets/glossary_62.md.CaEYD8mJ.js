Biography  The family was native to Daylam. During their early period, the family held much influence over the districts of Shukur, Ranikuh and Ashkawar in Tabaristan. The first member of the family was a certain Nu'man, who had two sons named Kaki and Fairuzan, whom both served the Alid dynasties of northern Iran. In 902, both of them were killed during a Samanid invasion of Tabaristan. Both of the slain brothers had a son; Kaki had a son named Makan ibn Kaki, while Fairuzan had a son named Al-Hasan ibn al- Fairuzan. Both of these sons would later play an important role in the politics of northern Iran. Makan later managed to make the Alid ruler his puppet, and make Tabaristan part of his domains. However, other Daylamites such as Asfar ibn Shiruya, including the Daylamite Buyids and Ziyarids, and the Persian Samanid dynasty, claimed suzerainty over Tabaristan, which in the end resulted in Makan getting killed in 940 by a Samanid army. Makan had a son named Ibn Makan, who later tried to seize Isfahan from the Buyids, but was defeated, and thereafter disappears from history chronicles. Al-Hasan managed to survive the struggle, and had two sons named Firuzan ibn al-Hasan and Nasr ibn al-Hasan. According to the historian Ibn Isfandiyar, Firuzan ruled Daylam, while Nasr ruled Qumis. Nasr is said to have built the Shahdiz in ca. 970, which would later become an important Ismaili fortress. Nasr later fell out of favor from the Ziyarid ruler Qabus, and was imprisoned. The fate of his brother is unknown. Nasr had a son named Hazarasp ibn Nasr, who served as a Buyid military officer. After this, the family disappears from history chronicles.

He was briefly a Whig Member of Parliament for County Carlow. Early life The second son of Nicholas Milley Doyle, Church of Ireland Rector of Newcastle, County Tipperary, and the grandson of Charles Doyle of Bramblestown, County Kilkenny, Doyle was a nephew of General Sir John Doyle and General Welbore Ellis Doyle (1758-1797), Military Governor of British Ceylon, and a cousin of Lieutenant-General Sir Charles William Doyle. On 31 May 1794, aged thirteen, he was commissioned as an ensign into the newly raised 107th Regiment of Foot.Henry Morse Stephens, Doyle, John Milley from Dictionary of National Biography at Wikisource Doyle was a brother of the campaigner for women's rights Anna Wheeler. Career On 21 June 1794 Doyle was promoted Lieutenant into the newly raised 108th Regiment of Foot, the Earl of Granard's.108th Regiment of Foot at regiments.org, accessed 11 March 2014 He saw active service in the suppression of the Irish rebellion of 1798. The next year he went to Gibraltar as aide-de-camp to his uncle, then Brigadier-General John Doyle. He remained with the older Doyle throughout the British expedition to Egypt and was at the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro and the storming of Ciudad Rodrigo. On 26 September 1811 Doyle was promoted lieutenant-colonel in the British Army. On 1 January 1812 he transferred as a full colonel to the 19th Portuguese Infantry Regiment, part of Le Cor's Portuguese brigade, attached to Dalhousie's division of the Anglo-Portuguese Army, commanding this regiment at the Battle of Vittoria and the Battle of the Pyrenees. In October 1812 he was made a Knight of the Order of the Tower and Sword. In the winter of 1813 Dalhousie went home to England on leave, and with General Le Cor taking command of the 7th Division, Doyle succeeded Le Cor at the head of the Portuguese 6th Brigade. He led it at the Battle of the Nivelle and at Orthes and then in the march on Bordeaux. At the end of the War with the defeat of Napoleon, Doyle left the Anglo-Portuguese Army, was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, and was appointed as inspecting officer of militia in Guernsey. Still in contact with the Portuguese, in June 1823 he chartered a steamer at his own expense and used it to take despatches for Dom Pedro to Cadiz. He was arrested by Dom Miguel, imprisoned for months in Lisbon, and not released until after the British minister, Sir Frederick Lamb, took up his case. In 1831 Doyle was elected as one of the Members of Parliament for County Carlow and retained the seat in the House of Commons until 1832. However, he went on helping Dom Pedro with money and served as major-general and aide-de- camp to Pedro in the Siege of Porto of 1832. When the Liberal Wars ended, Doyle was persuaded to resign his commission in return for being paid for his past services and being refunded the money of his own he had laid out, but the Portuguese never paid him. By petitions, Doyle succeeded in getting a mixed commission appointed to deal with the debts owed to the British and Irish officers, but this subsequently paid out every one of those officers except himself. For many years he pursued legal actions to get what he was owed, but never succeeded. Finally giving up, in July 1853 he accepted an appointment as a Military Knight of Windsor and as a sergeant-at-arms to Queen Victoria. Doyle died at Windsor Castle on 9 August 1856 and was buried with military honours near the south side of St George's Chapel.

History left Guanacaste Waldorf School was founded in 2011 by three families, who were immersed in Waldorf education in different ways. These families started a Waldorf homeschool in Guanacaste, offering this education and way of living to a small group of children. \\"Centro Bilingüe Waldorf - Escuela Naturaleza y Pura Vida\\" was then founded. In 2013, the name was changed to Guanacaste Waldorf School and its location moved from the original Avellanas & Hernandez locations to the town of Cañafistula.

Outdoor play in rope swings, see-saw or hammocks, baking, puppetry, story-telling, finger knitting, sewing, watercolor painting, wool felting, songs and poems are part of the daily curriculum. Students assist with all tasks at school, developing self- confidence, a sense of responsibility and teamwork. Grades left GWS now offers grades 1-8. The main lesson, occupying the first two hours of each school day, is designed to immerse students in a subject over a period of two to four weeks. A four-week block of form drawing, for example, becomes a learning process supported by activities such as the recitation of poetry, singing, drama, drawing, and writing, all integrated with the theme, as well as the daily recalling and developing of the content explored in the lesson of the previous day.

It was released on March 11, 2014. A promotional single, \\"Feed\\", was released a week prior on March 5, 2014, while \\"End Over End\\" was later released as the EPs first and only official single. Background =Writing and recording= The EP's earlier origin tracks back to guitarist Chris Shy, the prior guitarist of band Aurora Sky, who envisioned doing a project with Pete Murray of Lo-Pro. He contacted Murray after the release of Lo-Pro's third album, Disintegration Effect, in June 2013. The two communicated vaguely about working together through email, which eventually led to sending song ideas back and forth. Upon completion of their first complete song, \\"Feed\\", the two decided to start work on writing songs for an EP, and the two were tasked with forming a real band. Murray recruited John Fahnestock, whom he had worked with on Lo-Pro's first album Lo-Pro prior to Fahnestock leaving during the six-year gap to their second album, The Beautiful Sounds of Revenge, as a bass player. Shy had always envisioned Will Hunt, prior drummer for Evanescence, Device and Dark New Day, as a member, and proceeded to recruit him for the project. The entire recruitment process had been done entirely over phone and Internet; the band had not ever all been together in person until the start of the recording sessions. Recording started at the end of 2013 and early 2014, with music producer Ben Grosse, who had previously worked with Breaking Benjamin, Disturbed, and Filter. Grosse was chosen because Murray had desired to work with him since the recording of Lo-Pro's debut album, due to his involvement in producing Title of Record. The album was recorded in East West Studios. =Concept and sound= Murray stated that the band was meant to sound like an evolution and maturation from the music he had previously done with Ultraspank and Lo-Pro. Murray states that while \\"anger\\" had been an inspiration for his music in the past, he feels he has \\"mellowed out\\" over the years, now being inspired by practicing yoga, which led to a theme of \\"the power of a quiet mind\\" for the EP. Murray explained the album title, stating: > \\"Until We Meet Again acts in the same way that “Sincerely” is the closing of > a personal piece of correspondence. It was our way of authoring our name to > the songs as a whole and the experience in general.\\" Both Murray and Shy felt that they were able to make the music the way they truly desired, without any external pressures such as a record label, since it was released independently, or fear of having to conform to \\"pay the bills\\", since it was not the only band or source of income for any members. The lyrics for \\"Bomber\\" were inspired by Murrays thoughts of likening the aggressive nature of people who \\"only thrive with drama\\" with World War II bomber plane attacks. \\"End Over End\\" was inspired by Murray's \\"here we go again\\"-type feelings upon starting up another band. The specific line \\"it was anarchy in the streets of my thoughts\\" refers to the chaotic nature of his own mind prior to finding peace in later years. \\"Breathe\\" is about keeping life's trouble's in perspective, with Murray stating \\"Bottom line is we really don’t have much to complain about. There are people in this world who have it so much worse. If you’re breathing, you’re winning. It’s that simple. I don’t need to throw a wedding at Versailles to feel like I’ve accomplished something\\" Release and promotion A minute-long teaser clip was released in December 2013, with the band aiming for a \\"Spring 2014\\" release timeframe. A second teaser clip was released a month later in mid-January. The release date for Until We Meet Again was later narrowed down to March 11, 2014, with the band's first single, \\"Feed\\", was released as a promotional single a week prior on March 5, 2014, while \\"End Over End\\" was later released as the EP's first and only single. Reception The New Zealand Herald gave the album a 4 out of 5 star review, comparing it favorably to the work of Filter and Seether, and concluding that \\"In five songs that will leave you breathless, White Noise Owl has harked back to the past three decades of rock to provide a glimpse of what could be the future sound of hard rock.

Some of the local names include: katık in Turkey, qatıq in Azerbaijan, qatiq in Uzbekistan, ҡатыҡ in Bashkortostan, қатық in Kazakhstan, айран in Kyrgyzstan, катык in Tatarstan, gatyk in Turkmenistan. It is known as къатыкъ among the Crimean Tatars and as қатиқ among the Uyghurs. In Bulgaria, катък is a spread that has the consistency of mayonnaise. In order to obtain qatiq, boiled milk is fermented for 6–10 hours in a warm place. Sometimes red beets or cherries are used for coloring. The product may be kept in a cool place for two or three days. If stored longer, it will turn sour; it may still be added to high-fat soups, though. The chalop soup is made from qatiq in Uzbekistan. When sour milk is strained in a canvas bag, the resulting product is called suzma. Dried suzma, or kurut, is often rolled into marble-size balls.

The map encompasses the eastern coast of North America, the entire Central and South America and parts of the western coasts of Europe and Africa. Americae Sive Quartae Orbis Partis Nova Et Exactissima Descriptio is the earliest scale wall map of the New World and the first to use the name \\"California\\". The map consists of six neatly-joined engraved sheets. Measuring 93×86 cm, it remained the largest map of America for a century. It has a longitude grid, the equator, the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, but no latitude grid. The map also lacks the Tordesillas meridian, demarcating the Spanish and Portuguese possessions in the New World. Along with mermaids and other sea creatures, the map features objects that had been popularized in Europe after the first voyage of Christopher Columbus, such as parrots, cannibals, Patagonian giants and an erupting volcano in central Mexico. One of the depicted Patagonian giants is handing a bow to a conquistador. The top left corner features the goddess Victoria behind the arms of Spain and France, which are carried by three putti. It is believed that the alliance between the two kingdoms, forged by the marriage of Philip II and Elisabeth of Valois, is the reason why two arms are positioned close to each other. The map uses the Classical Latin letter \\"V\\" instead of \\"U\\". There are two extant copies of the map, one in the Library of Congress (Washington, D.C.) and the other in the British Library (London). The actual total number of copies is not known. The Library of Congress's copy was formerly in the collection of the Duke of Gotha until its sale at a 1932 auction in Munich. It was then acquired by an American book dealer who in turn sold it to Lessing J. Rosenwald. In 1949 Rosenwald gave the map to the Library of Congress.

The village is centered at the junction of Tarkin Hill Road, River Road, and Mill Road in New Bedford, and Main Street in Acushnet. The area went through two significant periods of development: the first was in the late 18th and early 19th century, and the second was in the early 20th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Description and history The Head of the River Historic District is centered on the Acushnet River's head of navigation, a short way north of its mouth into New Bedford Harbor. The river is spanned by a bridge whose oldest portion is a stone-arch span that predates 1850, and was widened with steel spans in 1959. The bridge carries Main Street in Acushnet on the east side, and becomes Tarkin Hill Road on the west side. The border between Acushnet and New Bedford comes up the river from the south, follows the bridge west, and then runs north on Mill Road, just west of the river. The oldest buildings of the district are clustered close to the bridge, while later development extends eastward along Main Street in Acushnet. The district contains only a few buildings in New Bedford on Tarkin Hill Road and Mill Road, with most of the remaining properties in Acushnet fronting those roads and Main Street. Head of the River was one of the principal points of early development by colonial settlers in what is now Acushnet, and saw its first significant period of growth after the American Revolutionary War. Acushnet was originally part of Dartmouth, then New Bedford and Fairhaven, before incorporating in 1860. The oldest surviving buildings in Head of the River date to the 1780s, including the 1-1/2 story Swift House (10 Mill Road) and the Dillingham House (19 Main Street) as examples of this early period. The building at 17 Tarkin Hill Road, built c. 1800, is a rare commercial building from this period. The finest house from the period is the c. 1817 Hawes House at 17 Main Street. There are also several Greek Revival houses, but development languished in the area until the 20th century, when the Queen Anne house at 28 Main Street was built (c. 1900), along with a number of Craftsman and Dutch Colonial houses between then and about 1935.

The art historian Cesare Brandi interpreted in 1935 the inscription as the signature of its author: ................CAROLLU DA CAMERINO PINXIT From that moment the hypothesis of the existence of a painter of the Marche region by the name Carlo da Camerino was formed and subsequently many works were attributed to this artist including a Madonna with Child in Mondavio, dating from the year 1400. In 2002, on the occasion of an exhibition on the Quattrocento in Camerino, the art historian Matteo Mazzalupi re-interpreted the inscription as: ALVUCCIU DE CICCARELLU DA CAMERINO PINXIT thus assigning the painting to Olivuccio di Ciccarello of Camerino. As a result, in 2002, all works attributed formerly to Carlo da Camerino have been re-attributed to the artist Olivuccio di Ciccarello, an artist of Camerino (in Italian: 'da Camerino'), which suggests a unanimous agreement among art historians regarding the re-interpretation and attribution.MAZZALUPI, Matteo: «Carlo da Camerino, il pittore inesistente», L’Appennino camerte, LXXXII, n.20, 18 de mayo de 2002, p. 5.

It was established in 1936. The school is located at the heart of Rangia at Mahatma Gandhi road. The current student strength is 1286 with 67 faculty members. It is an Assamese medium school. The students of 10th standard appear in HSLC examination under SEBA and the students of 12th standard appear in HSSLC examination under Assam Higher Secondary Education Council. History =Laghunram minor school= In 5 January 1917, some donation from the public were raised with the effort of some persons to establish a minor school named as Laghanuram Minor School, in the memory of Lt. Laghanuram Choudhury. It is stated that Lt. Laghanuram Choudhury donated a Thousand rupees for the establishment of the school and he was the Secretary of the managing committee too. Lt. Bibhav Chandra Mazumdar was enrolled as the Head Master of the school. But as he had to transfer himself to another place for higher studies, Lt. Santiram Lahkar was given the responsibility as the new Head Master. As Santiram Lahkar was condemned to prison in the Freedom Movement, the post of the Head Master was again enrolled for Lt. Gopikanta Kalita.In 1925, Mohan Chandra Choudhury took the responsibility and served the post of the Head Master till it succeeded from a Minor school to High school. =Rangia High school= In accordance to a general meeting, a decision was taken to change the Minor school to a High school and a High madrasa separately in 1936. Mohan Chandra Choudhury, Lakshiram Choudhury and Siddhinath Sarma were among the names who contributed in this field. The class of the High school was started on 3 March 1936 with Muktaram Kalita as the Head Master; on the same day, the first class of High Madrasa was also taken in the leadership of Nuruddin Ahmed. The classes of High Madrasa were going on at the same place as present and that of the High school were going on in the Balika school belonging to that time. In 1937, when the two schools were united, the classes were shifted to the Primary Moktab of Rangia. The classes were also taken in the house of Lt. Chidananda Bhatacharya temporarily. Although the son of Lt.Laghunram Choudhury, Lt.Lakshiram Choudhury donated 2500 rupees, his brothers unable to donate those money when Lakshiram Choudhury unfortunately went mentally imbalanced which resulted the name of Laghunram High School replaced by Rangia High School. =Separation of high school and high madrasa= Dhaka Board of Intermediate And Secondary Education said that it would de-recognize the High Madrasa Section if the school authorities fail to manage separate managing committees, teaching stuffs and funds for the High School and the High Madrasa. This resulted in foundation of a managing committee separately for High Madrasa on 12 July 1945 and the High Madrasa was also established separately in 1947. On the other hand, in May, 1948 the chief minister of Assam Gopinath Bordoloi inaugurated the High School officially. =Addition of higher secondary sections= In 1978, after many fights with the Government, the then Head Master Jogendranath Kalita with two former presidents of the Rangia Municipality Durgadutta Agarwala and Nikunjalal Choudhury respectively were able to add the Higher Secondary Science stream in the High school. In 1982, the Art stream was also added. Presently, in addition to Art and Science stream, the Commerce stream is also unfastened for the students. Present Presently High School Section of Rangia Higher Secondary School consists of five classes starting from Sixth to Tenth standard and each having two sections. On the other hand, the Higher Secondary section consists of the three streams-Science, Arts and Commerce. One of the busy roads of Rangia, M.G.

It was expected to cost $450 million and consist of two 36 floor buildings History In the post-war period, the Sri Lankan government under Mahinda Rajapaksa actively pursued new ventures to attract tourism and boost the country's economy, intending to take advantage of the island's close proximity to India. In this context, it intended to encourage the growth of a gaming industry, hoping to divert Indian and Chinese travelers from more established centers such as Singapore or Macau. Crown Sri Lanka was one of three integrated resorts planned in Sri Lanka, located in the capital city Colombo. This was a joint partnership between Ravi Wijeratne (head of the Rank Holdings group) and Crown Limited, who each held a 45% stake. The project was criticized by civil society groups (on the grounds of being contrary to the country's conservative principles), and by opposition parties, which alleged that the tax incentives given to the project were disproportionate and an unfair burden to the taxpayer. The project was slated to be completed by 2015, but a change in government led to the cancellation of all three casino licenses awarded by the previous administration- among them, that of the Crown Resorts project.

In fact it is a double J stent on which a balloon is mounted. It is connected to a delivery device (pusher) to introduce it from the bladder into the ureter. The system comprises a non-return valve device, and a pusher with a stylet and two ports. The side port is for injecting contrast agent to inflate the balloon, while the straight port is for the guidewire. The catheter has a relatively large-diameter central lumen and a shaft of 2 mm (6 Fr.). The balloon is in two sections: a long narrow section or shaft and a larger cranial bulb. The larger cranial bulb prevents distal migration, while the longer narrow section maintains the increased diameter of a predilated stricture in the ureter section. Stent placement and removal A guide wire has to be placed in the ureter. After dilatation of the ureteric stricture with a high pressure dilatation balloon the guidewire remains in place to bring in the ureteric balloon catheter. The balloon is inflated by an injection of contrast medium via side port of the pusher and remains in situ while the expanded urothelium heals. The stylet is used to detach the balloon catheter from the pusher. During the healing process urine drains through the wide central lumen while the balloon remains inflated. The ureteric balloon catheter may be used in conjunction with a double J stent for additional drainage. To remove the catheter after several weeks the balloon is deflated by snipping the distal end of the catheter. The catheter can then safely be pulled out. Indications The ureteric balloon catheter is intended to cure two major types of diseases: :* Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (also called UPJ obstruction or Pelvic-ureteric junction obstruction PUJO) caused by intrinsic wall factors as fibrosis and / or hypertrophic wall problems. : :::and :* Brickers bladder (also called Ileal conduit) problems. Up to 10% of patients who undergo ileal conduit urinary diversion may go on to develop ureteroileal anastomotic stenosis. This can lead to obstructive symptoms as side pain, infection and finally deterioration in renal function which can be relieved by the treatment with this balloon catheter. An intervention according to this Overtoom procedure is significantly less invasive than the alternative treatments. The balloon is not intended to be used in case of obstructions by stones or malignancies. References Further reading  * Having a Ureteric Stent - What to Expect and How to Manage. Authors: Mr. H. B.

Beale was convicted of felony theft of government property after it came to light in 2013 that he had defrauded the government out of $886,186 starting in 2000, primarily by pretending to be an agent for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Early life Beale was born in 1948 in St. Louis County, Minnesota to C. Gordon Beale, a minister of the United Church of Christ, and Marcella Beale, a nurse. He served in the United States Army as a medic in the early 1970s and was honorably discharged. Beale attended the University of California, Riverside, earning a bachelor's degree in political science in 1975, using resources provided by the G.I. Bill. Beale interned for Democrat US Senator John V. Tunney while in college, assisting in the negotiation of the Bilingual Courts Act. He later simultaneously earned a Master of Public Administration from Princeton University and a law degree from New York University. Beale was employed with a law firm consisting of three partners in Lake City, Minnesota for four years prior to his work with the EPA. During his time with this law firm, he primarily dealt with the Federal Election Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Beale is married to Nancy Kete, another former EPA employee. Kete is also a former managing director of the Rockefeller Foundation. EPA work  In 1987, Beale began working as a part- time consultant for the EPA, becoming full-time in 1988. In 1989, Beale was hired as a full-time EPA employee in the position of Senior Policy Advisor, at a pay grade of GS-15. He was brought on with the EPA primarily through his relationship with Robert Brenner, who was then deputy director of the Office of Air and Radiation at the EPA. Brenner and Beale had been classmates together at Princeton. Previously, Beale had no experience dealing with environmental issues, but was seen as a good negotiator and had some experience dealing with Congress from his internship during college. He also expressed that he \\"always had an interest in environmental issues.\\" Beale worked on amendments to the Clean Air Act,Brenner, Rob, and Beale, John, \\"Pizza at Midnight,\\" EPA Journal, 17, p. 54 (1991), EPA, NW. Washington, DC 20036. First page at heineonline (accessed 3 Jan. 2015). and was widely lauded for his efforts. In 1989, Beale was a member of a 24-person teamExcellence In EPA FY 1989 Awards Report, p. 8, Report EPA 210-R-89-001, Office of Human Resource Management, Environmental Protection Agency, Washington DC; OCLC Number 23131813 (1989), accessed 5 January 2015 that was awarded the EPA Gold Medal for Exceptional Service, its highest honor, \\"In recognition of outstanding contributions to the development of the 1989 Clean Air Act Amendments.\\" Twenty-year veteran of the EPA Aron Anthony Golberg noted that Beale was \\"one of the most capable people whom [he] knew during [his] career\\". In 1991 and again in 2000,The EPA OIG’s Investigation of John C. Beale, Statement of Patrick Sullivan, Assistant Inspector General for Investigations Before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, U.S. House of Representatives, October 1, 2013 (accessed 5 January 2015) Beale was given a retention bonus, consisting of 25% of his annual salary. (Although the retention bonus is an award to be paid out for no more than three years, in Beale's case the awards were paid for a total of 12 years). In 2005, Beale also received a Meritorious Executive Rank Award, a category of the Presidential Rank Award, which carried a $28,201 payment. Prior to his arrest, he was assigned to the Office of Air and Radiation, the division responsible for the development of national programs, policies and regulations designed to control air pollution and radiation exposure. Fraud The headquarters for the CIA in Langley, Virginia, where Beale reported to spend time. Given Beale's degree of travel in his work for the EPA, there were rumors that he was a \\"secret agent\\". Beginning in 2000, Beale began skipping work on occasional Wednesdays with \\"D.O. Oversight\\" noted on his calendar on nine days throughout 2000, and continuing many times until his retirement in 2011. In his 2013 deposition, Beale recalled the first time speaking with someone about these skipped days. Beale said that he told Jeffrey Holmstead, then assistant administrator at the Office of Air and Radiation, that he was working for the CIA, and that these days were spent working for the CIA’s Directorate of Operations (now the National Clandestine Service). Beale would later admit that during these days he was at home reading or exercising. In 2002, Beale was given a subsidized parking space because he had led his coworkers to believe that he had contracted malaria during the Vietnam War. Beale held the space until June 2005, costing a total of $8,000. He in fact never had malaria, and did not serve in Vietnam. Beale was familiar with the symptoms of the disease from his time as a medic in the army, treating soldiers in the United States. From 2005 to 2007, Beale claimed to be working on an EPA research project and drew $57,235 in travel expenses to Los Angeles, where he was in fact visiting family in nearby Bakersfield. The travel expenses covered first-class flights and stays in high-end hotels. For a period of six months in 2008, Beale did not report to work for the EPA under the guise of his CIA work, but continued to draw his salary from the EPA. In 2011 Beale told his colleagues that he was retiring from the EPA, throwing a boat party on the Potomac River in September that was attended by his boss, Gina McCarthy, who later became the administrator of the EPA. Despite the purported retirement, Beale continued to draw his salary, and the temporary bonus that was supposed to cease in 2003 continued to be paid through 2013. By the time of his retirement, Beale was the highest paid employee in the EPA, making more than administrator McCarthy. =Discovery and conviction= In November 2012, an EPA HR employee discovered that Beale was still drawing his salary and temporary bonus following his retirement, and brought the issue to the attention of McCarthy. McCarthy exchanged several emails with Beale about the issue, to which he responded that he was still engaged in work with the CIA. In late December 2012, a Homeland Security employee who worked as the liaison for the EPA to the intelligence community made contact with Beale, saying that they had no record of Beale ever having worked for the CIA. On January 7, 2013, McCarthy met with Beale at her office, detailing that the EPA would require documentation of Beale's work with the CIA. Beale reported that he would work on it, but a month later reported that the CIA would not acknowledge his work with them. McCarthy responded \\"that puts you in a really bad position, doesn’t it?\\" Mark Kaminsky, an investigator for the Office of the Inspector General, began to look into the case in February 2013. Beale initially refused to answer questions, and his colleagues at the EPA only had glowing reviews of his work there. Kaminsky noted that Beale was atypical in that \\"he lied across all aspects of his life,\\" even finding emails with his wife that kept up the lie. Kaminsky ultimately proved that Beale was lying by showing that at times he reported to be overseas engaged in CIA operations, he was in fact making domestic cell phone calls. He was also able to confirm with the CIA that Beale never did any work there. In a subsequent meeting, Beale admitted to his crimes. Kaminsky and Beale counted up a total of nearly two and a half years of work that he had missed under the ruse of working for the CIA. He entered a guilty plea on September 27, 2013 to felony theft of government property, and submitted a check to the court for $886,186. The amount included $437,901 in fraudulent retention bonuses and $58,127 for the \\"D.O. Oversight\\" days, among other fraudulent earnings. Beale also agreed to a punitive criminal forfeiture of $507,207 for a total payment of $1,393,393. On December 18, 2013, Beale was sentenced to 32 months in prison, two years of supervised release, and 100 hours of community service for each of those two years. Many of Beale's former colleagues at the EPA were incredulous regarding the revelations of his falsehoods. Some colleagues even asserted that he was \\"taking one for the team\\" so as not to reveal the nature of his supposed CIA work. During his December 2013 deposition, Beale said that his relationship with his wife had been \\"profoundly affected\\" following the revelations. Beale was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution, Cumberland and was released on June 1, 2016.

Snow shovels come in several different designs, each of which is designed to move snow in a different way. Removing snow with a snow shovel has health risks, but can also have significant health benefits when the snow shovel is used correctly, especially when a modern kind of snow shovel is used that lets one remove snow without lifting it. These include snow sled shovels, also called snow scoops and sleigh shovels, which are large and deep hopper-like implements fitted with a wide handle and designed to scoop up a load of snow and slide it to another location without lifting. History The earliest known snow shovel was found in a bog in Russia. Estimated to be 6,000 years old, its blade was made from a carved elk antler section. According to archaeologists, the antler piece was tied to a wood or bone handle. Features Throwing snow to clear a driveway All snow shovels consist of a handle and a scoop. Sometimes there may be a shaft connecting handle and scoop, while in other snow shovels, the handle is extended and attaches directly to the scoop. Most snow shovels are designed for either pushing snow or lifting snow, although some are crossovers which can do either job. Some snow shovel scoops have sharpened blades which can chip away and lever up slabs of ice. Handles may be straight or bent. Straight handles make the pushing angle easier to adjust and snow throwing easier compared to a bent handle. Long handles enable the user to leverage their weight for pushing snow, but shorter handles make tossing snow easier. Plastic and fiberglass handles are lightweight, while wood handles are heavy. Metal handles conduct heat away from the hands more readily than other kinds of handles, so they feel colder. Some handles include a D-shaped grip or padded grip at the end of the handle. There may also be extra grips in the middle of the handle to assist with the snow shovel's lever action when lifting snow. Snow shovels designed for lifting snow generally have smaller scoops than snow shovels designed for throwing snow. A typical push-type shovel scoop would be about 24 inches across with a wide, blunt blade, while a lift-type shovel scoop may be half that size. A narrower scoop makes the removal of deep, wet, or heavy snow easier. Scoops with a large curve can carry more snow, while those with a shallow curve are intended to push snow rather than carry it. Metal scoops are studier than plastic but heavier, and they also require more maintenance. Steel and steel-edged scoops are heavier than aluminum or plastic, but are also more durable. Although they are very good for dealing with ice, they can also damage delicate outdoor home surfaces. Many homeowners who deal with large amounts of snow have multiple snow shovels for different types of snow. If lifting is a concern, then they may choose separate shovels for lifting versus pushing. Otherwise, users may wish to have a shovel for fresh light snow and another one to manage icy hard snow. Safe usage A child in appropriate clothing, moving a shovelful of fresh snow alt=A sidewalk, covered with thin snow in many areas, with deep snow on the sides gouged irregularly. A stop sign is visible in the rear Shoveling snow is hard work. In a single winter, shoveling a typical driveway can involve moving more than 25 tons of snow. Health risks associated with shoveling snow include heart attacks (myocardial infarction), worsening of existing breathing issues, sprains and strains, slips and falls, back injuries, hypothermia and frostbite, and accidents involving road traffic. Persons doing snow shoveling can reduce their risk of injury by shoveling snow when it is fresh and light. Slip- resistant boots protect against user falls. Appropriate clothing prevents hypothermia and frostbite. Ideal snow shoveling clothing for the rest of the body is lightweight, layered, and water-repellent to increase ventilation while maintaining insulation. Proper snow throwing technique minimizes strains and back injuries. Recommended technique is that when lifting snow, the user bends their knees to collect the snow while maintaining a straight back, then straightening the legs to stand and lift. It is best to lift snow by using the shovel as a lever. Never lift snow with a side-twisting motion, as that can lead to injury. Shoveling snow is a known trigger for myocardial infarction among people at risk for heart problems and who do not regularly engage in strenuous physical activity. People who suffer from pre-existing heart or breathing problems should consult their doctor before shoveling snow. When done correctly, snow shoveling can provide good exercise. One hour of shoveling snow can burn 600 calories. Shoveling snow also builds bone and muscle mass and is a good form of aerobic exercise. In popular culture In Advance of the Broken Arm, a 1915 readymade sculpture from Marcel Duchamp, consisted of a regular snow shovel with \\"from Marcel Duchamp 1915\\" painted on the handle. The artwork, which used to hang in Duchamp's studio, is now lost.

The mural originally occupied two exterior walls of two four-story commercial buildings at this site. The mural was commissioned by the City of Indianapolis for the Indianapolis Urban Walls Project in 1973.Lennis, Susan. “Hey brother, can you spare a wall?”, “Indianapolis Star Magazine”, Indianapolis, 23 May 1976. Fabrication of the mural began in September 1973 and finished by the end of the year.  Description  When the mural was completed, Marion Simon Garmel described Untitled (Urban Wall) as “a complex puzzle of rectangles, pie-shaped wedges, quarter arcs and S curves in bold but earthy colors”. \\"Urban Wall\\" in Untitled refers to the Indianapolis Urban Walls Project, a region wide call to artists by the Indianapolis Department of Parks and Recreation to develop outdoor mural designs toward the beautification of downtown Indianapolis in hopes of drawing interest back downtown during the 1970s suburban flight.“Choose two buildings”, “The Indianapolis Star”, Indianapolis, 1 September 1973. Hobart's graphic mural is composed of bold geometric shapes of bright colors; mostly reds, yellows, and oranges with pops of blue, black, and white intermixed.Garmel, Marion Simon.”Urban wall dedication tomorrow”, “The Indianapolis News”, n.d. Curved rectangular forms morph together to create color-blocked waves that cross the wall. Each larger curved shape is made from smaller rectangles, triangles and trapezoids.  Historical information  The City of Indianapolis and the American Fletcher National Bank sponsored the development of Untitled (Urban Wall) as part of the 1973 Urban Walls Project. The National Endowment for the Arts matched a $3,500 contribution from the American Fletcher National Bank, all together providing $7,000 to fund the installation of the winning mural.”Urban walls to show artist’s winning entry”, “The Indianapolis Star”, 1 September 1973.“First wall design winner”, “The Indianapolis News”, 31 August 1973. Deputy Mayor Michael DeFabis named Hobart’s mural the winner over four other finalists. Hobart received $700 for his winning design. His piece was the first of what was expected to be multiyear “Urban Walls Project\\" with many future installations. During the fabrication of Untitled (Urban Wall), which was completed by Naegele Outdoor Advertising under Hobart's supervision, Indianapolis was home to multiple other exterior murals, but Untitled (Urban Wall) was the first to be sponsored by the city. The Urban Walls Project utilized painting services of the city's unemployed and youth to complete the selected murals. The mural was dedicated in the fall of 1973 by Richard Lugar and attended by Hobart and other city officials. Recently the mural has been getting more attention from Indianapolis residents and has begun to spark interest in having the work restored. In a 2016 interview Hobart responded to this interest by saying \\"I think today it would be even more appreciated, people are more cultured.\\" The cost of the project was about $10,000 and was intended to be part of an ongoing effort to produce Urban Walls throughout the city.  Ownership history  Untitled (Urban Wall) was installed at its current location in 1973 and has been there since. During time of installation, Steven R. Skirvin and Thomas A. Moyahan owned the two buildings on which the mural was installed. Skirvin owned the Indiana Parking Company garage, which sits at 145. E. Market Street. and Moynahan the Union Title Building, which sits at 155 E. Market Street. Both company owners agreed to fund the preparation of the area for mural painting and installation and as well as any future maintenance. Currently, the Indiana Parking Garage Association owns Skirvin's old Indiana Parking Company building.“Property Assessment Viewer”, “Marion County Assessors Office”, 16 April 2014. http://maps.indy.gov/PropertyAssessmentViewer/ Moyahan's Union Title Building is now owned by Crown Barrister, LLC. The parking lot which fills the space between the two buildings is owned by Richard L. Brown, Jr.  Condition  Since it was created in 1973, the mural has never been repainted and the north section has been completely painted over. By 1977 the north wall of the mural had suffered damage from a water leak in the building which resulted in a call for its restoration, which never occurred. Visible on the remaining section are concrete patches in the brick wall. Also visible at the bottom are parking signs and a large section of white paint.

They are usually made of \\"zisha\\" or Yixing clay, from the region near Yixing in Jiangsu province, China. Just like Yixing teapots made of the same clay, tea pets are unglazed, so that they are mostly monochromatic with a rough surface.Pan, Chunfang (2004). Yixing Pottery: The World of Chinese Tea Culture. San Francisco: Long River Press. pp. 41–49 Tea lovers in China raise a tea pet by placing it on the tea tray during tea time and pouring out the tea over it. One of the most popular models for the tea pet is the \\"pee-pee boy\\" which when first soaked in cold water and then showered with hot water will squirt out the water it previously absorbed. Tea pets are also molded into zodiac animals or Chinese mythical creatures such as dragons, Pixiu, Qilin, etc., to symbolize good luck, fortune and happiness, as well as historical or mythical characters such as Guanyin, Maitreya and Zhuge Liang.  History  Hot water poured on the head of the pee-pee boy triggers a water jet indicating the water temperature. The birthplace of tea pets, Yixing, was first famous as the birthplace of \\"Yixing clay\\" in Song dynasty (960–1279).Lo, Kuei-hsiang (1986). The stonewares of Yixing: From the Ming period to the present day. London: Sotheby's Publications. With the popularity of the Yixing clay teapot, Yixing became a production center for teaware since then. Teapot artisans started to mold Yixing clay into various mythical creatures or animals as mascots for tea lovers. However, probably because the ancient Chinese scholars believe in a saying that \\"excessive attention to trivia saps the will\\", there is very limited literature on the development of tea pets in Chinese history. Nowadays, even with the development of the technology—it is not hard to find alternatives to Yixing clay as the material to make tea pets—the production is still concentrated in Yixing region.  Types  A tea pet is handmade using Zisha (Yixing clay) and unglazed, so it is usually in the natural color of Yixing clay. There are three kinds of Yixing clay: purple, red, and green clay. A tea pet can be made of either of one of these Yixing clays, or a mixture of two to produce different colors. * Purple clay is the principal clay, which turns red-brown or dark-brown after firing. The artisan often adds iron clay to achieve a better color effect. * Red clay, also known as \\"Stock Yellow\\", has a much higher contraction percentage than purple clay, and shows a vermillion color after firing. Because of its high contraction percentage, red clay is more suitable for making small-sized objects like tea pets and teapots. * Green clay has a color similar to duck egg shell, and appears off- white after firing. It is rarer than purple clay, and more expensive on the market.  Maintenance  The way that tea lovers raise a tea pet is quite similar to the way that they maintain a Yixing clay teapot. They often pour leftover tea or leaf-rinsing water over their tea pets, and use a tea brush to wipe the surface of the tea pet to help it absorb the tea evenly. Tea pets should be only rinsed with water, without using soap or any dish-washing liquid, to ensure a progressive increase in the color of the tea. After prolonged maintenance, over months or years, the tea pet will absorb the tea, and its appearance will become glossier. Typical pee pee boy (tea pet)  Pee- pee boy  Pee-pee boy is the most representative and popular figure among tea pets. It is about 3 inch tall with a red-brown color. Its main feature is the ability to squirt water when hot water is poured onto it. To do this, a tea lover immerses it in cold water until it is filled up and shakes it to make sure it is filled at least 50 percent with water; after that, hot water poured over the pee-pee boy will make it \\"pee\\" if the water is hot enough. The hotter the water, the further it pees. The principle behind the pee-pee boy is thermal expansion of air. It is designed to be hollow with only one tiny opening, so that water can flow into pee-pee boy at a slow pace and will not drip out until sufficient hot water is poured on its head. When hot water is poured over its head, the air in the pee-pee boy expands, resulting in the water being squeezed out through the tiny opening. Experimental and simulation results based on thermodynamics and fluid mechanics principles have verified the capability of such device to measure temperature. With this feature, the pee-pee boy soon became the most popular figure in tea pets. And recently, more and more artisans also utilize this technology on other tea pets, such as water-breathing dragons or a water-spraying longevity tortoises, to provide more choices for tea lovers. In popular culture Tea Pets (simplified Chinese: ) is a 2017 Chinese 3D computer animated film about the adventures of a group of tea pet clay figurines.

Description Gastrosaccus spinifer is a slender opossum shrimp, somewhat laterally compressed, and growing to a length of about . It is transparent with tinges of yellow, or brownish pink around the mouthparts, by the edges of the segments and on the telson (tail-like projection from the last abdominal segment). The carapace has a short fringe round its margin. As in other female opossum shrimps, the biramous (branching) pereopods (limbs on the thorax) form a marsupium or brood pouch. In this species there are two plate-like appendages attached to the front abdominal segment which fold under the brood pouch to protect it. This gives the female a rhomboidal shape when viewed from the side. The chief distinguishing factor for this species is the fact that the fifth abdominal segment is slender and has a long spine on its dorsal surface. Distribution and habitat Gastrosaccus spinifer is native to shallow water in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Its range extends from Norway to northern and western Africa as far south as Sierra Leone. It is found at depths down to about on soft sediments and in seagrass meadows and often buries itself in the sand or mud. In the North Sea, it often forms swarms and has sometimes been found at densities exceeding 1000 individuals per square metre (11 sq ft). Ecology Prodajus ostendensis is a parasitic isopod found living on Gastrosaccus spinifer. It clings to the opossum shrimp's carapace near the junction of the cephalothorax and abdomen and resembles a fleshy growth or may occupy the host's brood chamber.

The main settlement in the town of Clarecastle. Location Clareabbey lies in the barony of Islands. It is south of Ennis, and contains the town of Clarecastle (or simply Clare). The parish lies on the River Fergus, on the road from Ennis to Limerick. The parish in 1637 covered , mostly used for pasturage. It is long and up to wide. The Fergus bisects the parish, and is bridged at Clare. The land is generally very fertile, part alluvial and part limestone.

When Knight was one year old, she contracted an illness, diagnosed at age three, which resulted in the loss of most of her vision by the age of six. She joined the Great Britain paralympic skiing team in 2012, and progressed to compete at international-level events. Knight was the flagbearer at the 2014 Winter Paralympics opening ceremony, her debut Paralympics, in Sochi where, at the age of 15, she was the youngest person ever to compete for ParalympicsGB at the Winter Paralympic games. In 2017, Knight and Wild became Great Britain’s first World Champions in a snow sport. In the same year Knight also became an Honorary Doctor of the University of Kent. Early life and education Knight was born on 15 January 1999 in Canterbury, Kent. She was six when she lost much of her vision; in her left eye she has 5–10% peripheral vision, and in her right eye she has 5%. Knight was studying for her GCSEs in tandem with her sporting career. She was enrolled at King's School in Canterbury; her first year studying there was 2012. As of 2016, Knight continued to study for her A-Levels in which she obtained 3 As, securing her a place at Loughborough university, Stirling University and Kent University to study psychology starting in 2019 She is now studying at Kent University. Skiing career In 2006 at the age of seven, shortly before Knight lost the majority of her sight, she had been to France on a skiing holiday and was encouraged to try the sport by her mother. Knight was inspired to take up the sport competitively when she met sit-skier Sean Rose, shortly after he had competed at the 2010 Winter Paralympics. Her mother was Knight's first sighted guide until late January 2013 for financial reasons. The pair competed together in visually impaired (VI) races. In November 2012, at age 13, Knight began training with Great Britain's Paralympic development squad. She raced at the Europa Cup in slalom and giant slalom. in spring 2013. Her stand in, temporary sighted guide at the Games, Rachael Ferrier, briefly joined Knight at the end of 2013. Knight competes in class B2 due to her lack of complete vision, a classification between being blind and visually impaired. =2014 Paralympics= Knight's debut Paralympics was the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi; competing at the age of 15 made her the youngest ParalympicsGB competitor at any Winter Paralympics. She was the flag bearer at the opening ceremony for ParalympicsGB, carrying the flag at the Fisht Olympic Stadium, an honour Knight described as \\"a surprise\\". She competed for ParalympicsGB in the slalom on 14 March, completing both of her runs, and finishing fifth, and competed in the giant slalom on 16 March, again finishing fifth. There was not any significant expectation on Knight at the 2014 Paralympics, as her target is the 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang. =Post-Sochi= Following the Sochi games, it was announced in April 2014 that Knight would participate in the Queen's Baton Relay on 5 June 2014, carrying the Baton in Kent. Knight immediately parted company with Ferrier after the 2014 Paralympics: as a result Knight competed in the 2014-15 season with a series of stand-in guides. That season she travelled to Canada to compete at the 2015 IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships in Panorama Mountain Village in British Columbia.> Prior to the Championships Knight had won two gold medals on the World Cup tour and hopes were high that she may medal. At Panorama Knight took part in the two technical events, the slalom and giant slalom, as she was still too young to compete in the speed events. In her first event, the giant slalom, Knight took the lead in the first run with a time of 1:12.90, but despite bettering this time in her second run with 1:11.49, she was beaten into silver medal place by a third of a second by Russia's Aleksandra Frantseva.> Two days later Knight took part in the slalom, winning bronze, Britain's only two medals of the games.> The following season Knight teamed up with guide Brett Wild, who had previously raced with Knight's coach Euan Bennet on the Scottish ski team. After initially meeting at a training camp in December 2015, the pair competed together at the World Cup finals in Aspen, Colorado, where they took two wins in the downhill and super-G and a third place in the giant slalom: this success convinced the pair to focus on the speed disciplines, which they felt were their strength. In the run-up to the 2017 World Para Alpine Skiing Championships in Tarvisio, Italy, Knight enjoyed a great deal of success on the World Cup circuit, taking 11 medals including seven golds in the months leading up to the championships. At the Championships themselves, Knight and guide Brett Wild took gold in the downhill with a time of 1:13.42, beating five-time Paralympic champion Henrieta Farkašová by 1.2 seconds. Team GB officials stated that this was the first world championship title for a British paraskier. Knight and Wild subsequently took a silver behind Farkašová in the Super Combined and a second silver in the Giant Slalom. Since the World Championships in February, Knight sustained concussion though a crash at the World Cup Finals in March in South Korea. The crash took her out of action for several months. However she was still crowned World Cup downhill champion for the season. In July 2017, Knight became an Honorary Doctor of The University of Kent. =2018 Paralympics= At the 2018 Paralympics in Pyongchang, South Korea, Knight took two silver medals on the opening weekend of the Games in the downhill and super-G, before taking the bronze in the slalom on the final day of the Paralympics.

Biography Map of northern Iran Al-Hasan was the son of Fairuzan, a Daylamite soldier, who along with his brother Kaki served the Alid dynasties of northern Iran.Nazim (1987), p. 164 In 902, both of them were killed during a Samanid invasion of Tabaristan. Kaki had a son named Makan ibn Kaki, who together with al-Hasan served the Alids. Makan had established family ties through marriage with the Alids, as Ja'far, the son of imam Hasan ibn Ali al-Utrush (r. 914–917), was his son-in-law. The latter was engaged in a complex struggle against al-Utrush's designated successor Abu Muhammad Hasan ibn Qasim, known as the Da'i ila'l-Haqq (r. 917–928), and it was not until 923 that Ja'far and his brother Ahmad succeeded in ousting the Da'i and forcing him to exile.Madelung (1975), pp. 210–211 When Ja'far died in 924, he left the throne to Ahmad's son Abu Ali Muhammad, but al-Hasan and Makan deposed Muhammad and installed al-Hasan's half-brother Ismail, a son of Ja'far and the mother of al-Hasan, in his place.Madelung (1975), p. 211 Muhammad, however, managed to escape from his captors and with the aid of the Gilaki military chief Asfar ibn Shiruya, who had seized control of Gurgan, defeated the two brothers and retook his throne. In 930, Makan managed to recover Tabaristan, and appointed al-Hasan as the governor of the region. Makan also made Abu Muhammad Hasan ibn Qasim the imam of the Alids. A fake rumor later spread about the death of Makan,Ibn Isfandiyar (1905), pp. 204-270 which made al- Hasan, who wanted to install his half-brother Ismail as the imam, rise into rebellion. However, the rebellion failed after Ismail was poisoned at the instigation of Abu Ja'far Husayn's mother.Madelung (1975), p. 212 Al-Hasan was shortly driven out from Amol by two officers of Makan named Abu Ali and Abu Musa. Al-Hasan then fled to Daylam. Makan was himself shortly driven out from Tabaristan by the Ziyarid ruler Mardavij. In 935, Mardavij was assassinated and succeeded by his brother Vushmgir. Makan was appointed by his new overlords, the Samanids, as the governor of Gurgan. Vushmgir himself shortly recognized Samanid suzerainty, and Al-Hasan was appointed as the governor of Sari. Relations between Makan and Vushmgir improved to the point where the former felt secure enough to drop his dependence on the Samanids. As a result, in 939 a Samanid army under Abu 'Ali Chaghani attacked him at Gurgan. Following a seven-month siege of his capital, Makan was forced to flee to Rayy. The Samanid army pursued him, and in a battle fought on 25 December 940 at Iskhabad near Rayy, the Samanid forces were victorious. Makan himself was killed by an arrow, and then beheaded by the victors, who sent his head to the Samanid court in Bukhara.Madelung (1975), p. 213Nazim (1987), p. 165 Persia in the mid-10th century Vushmgir, after the disastrous defeat , fled back to Tabaristan, but al-Hasan, who blamed Vushmgir for the death of his cousin, shortly rebelled against him. Vushmgir managed to defeat him, but al-Hasan convinced Abu 'Ali Chaghani to invade Tabaristan. Vushmgir was forced to recognize Samanid authority again. When Abu 'Ali Chaghani left for Samanid Khurasan, Vushmgir retook control of Ray. He then lost it for good in 943, to the Buyid ruler Hasan. Returning to Tabaristan, he was defeated there by al- Hasan, who had previously occupied Gurgan. Vushmgir fled to the court of the Bavandid Shahriyar II, and then to the court of the Samanid Nuh I. Al-Hasan meanwhile allied with Hasan, but when Abu 'Ali Chaghani took Ray from the Buyids in 945, he recognized Samanid authority. Still, in 945 Vushmgir captured Gurgan with Samanid support, but did not manage to retain his rule there. It was only in 947 when he was able to take Gurgan and Tabaristan from al-Hasan with the help of a large Samanid army. In 948, the Buyid ruler Hasan (who since the Buyids' entrance into Baghdad in 945 had used the title Rukn al-Dawla) invaded Tabaristan and Gurgan and took them from Vushmgir. While al- Hasan supported the Buyids, Vushmgir relied on his Samanid allies.

Life He is first heard of at the theatre in Leman Street, Goodman's Fields, London where he played, on 13 November 1745, Sir Charles Freeman in The Beaux' Stratagem. His name appears, 14 November 1747, at Drury Lane under Garrick, as the Bastard (i.e. Edmund) in King Lear, and 3 December as Myrtle in The Conscious Lovers. Breaking his engagement with Garrick he made his first appearance at Covent Garden, 23 October 1749, as Ranger in The Suspicious Husband by Benjamin Hoadly. The beginning of the next season saw him still at Covent Garden, where he played, 31 October 1750, Granger in The Refusal by Colley Cibber. Garrick, however, compelled Lee to return to Drury Lane, where he reappeared, 27 December 1750, as George Barnwell in The London Merchant. Here he remained during this and the following season, playing secondary characters, except when he was allowed for his benefit on one occasion to enact Hamlet and Poet in Lethe, and on another, Lear and Don Quixote. On 23 February 1751, he was the original Earl of Devon in Mallet's Alfred. A man of extreme and aggressive vanity and of quarrelsome disposition, he fumed under the management of Garrick, who seems to have enjoyed keeping in the background an actor who was always disputing his supremacy. In 1752, Lee went accordingly to Edinburgh for the purpose of purchasing and managing the Canongate Concert Hall. Through the interest of Lord Elibank and other patrons, he obtained the house on exceptionally easy terms. He proved himself a good manager, reformed many abuses, and is said to have been the first to raise the status and morale of the Edinburgh stage. He set his face against gentlemen occupying seats on the stage or being admitted behind the scenes, and made improvements in decorations and scenery. Romeo and Juliet was played in December 1752, and is held by Mr. Dibdin, the historian of the Edinburgh stage, to have probably been the unprinted version with which the memory of Lee is discredited. In the summer Lee travelled with his company, and lost, he says, £500. Unable to pay the third instalment of the purchase-money for the theatre, he applied to Lord Elibank, who, with some friends, advanced money upon an assignment of the theatre, which Lee was reluctantly compelled to grant. In February a disagreement arose between Lee and the 'gentlemen' who had advanced him money, and the theatre was seized by the creditors, who, waiting for an excuse to quarrel with Lee, had already engaged West Digges as manager. Lee was thrown into prison and his furniture sold. He lost an action which he brought against Lord Elibank, Andrew Pringle, John Dalrymple, and others, and quit Edinburgh for Dublin, where he was engaged by Thomas Sheridan for £400 for the season. He now swallowed his pride, and once more enlisted under Garrick at Drury Lane, making, as Pierre in Venice Preserv'd 'his first appearance for ten years.' He competed, unsuccessfully, in 1766-67 for the patent of the Edinburgh Theatre. In 1769, and probably in subsequent years, he was at Bath. In 1778-89, he managed the theatre at Bath. In 1780 he was too ill to act, and he died in 1781. Family Lee's wife died early. By her he had five daughters, two of whom, Harriet Lee and Sophia Lee. His only son, George Augustus Lee (1761–1826), was a partner in a well-known firm of Manchester cotton-spinners (Phillips & Lee).

The son of the renowned Maltese architect Girolamo Cassar, he was admitted as a knight within the Order of St. John in 1587. He became the Order's resident engineer in the early 17th century, and he directed the upgrading of the Cittadella of Gozo between 1600 and 1603. Many details about his life are uncertain, including the dates of his birth and death. He is claimed to have designed some of the Wignacourt towers and several churches, but there is no evidence of these attributions. Biography Vittorio Cassar was probably the firstborn son of Girolamo Cassar and his wife Mattea, and he was his father's favourite and principal heir. He is said to have been born in around 1550, but this date is mainly based on speculation. The Cassar family, probably originating from Sicily, had been established in Malta since at least the year 1440. Cassar was admitted as a knight within the Order of St. John on 9 April 1587, joining the Langue of Castille, Léon and Portugal (there was no langue for Maltese knights). On 18 May of the same year, he was created serjeant-at-arms at the Church of St. Paul's Shipwreck in Valletta. In around 1594, the Order sent Cassar to tour various towns in Italy in order to study the latest architectural styles and meet famous engineers. Cassar directed the upgrading of the Cittadella between 1600 and 1603 In around 1600, Cassar was appointed as the Order's resident engineer, a post which had been previously held by his father. In September 1600, Cassar was assigned to direct the upgrading of the fortifications of the Cittadella on Gozo. During his stay on Gozo, he also produced designs for the Garzes Tower, but the tower was eventually built after Cassar left the island. Cassar developed an uneasy relationship with the island's governor, Fra Ferdinando de Rosolmini, which led to him being recalled back to Malta in August 1603 after being repeatedly reprimand due to the slow progress of the works. The date and circumstances of Cassar's death are unknown. It has been traditionally held that he died in 1607, when he erected a slab commemorating himself within the Chapel of St. Barbara in the Cittadella. However, military historian Stephen C. Spiteri states that he died in around mid-June 1609, and some records suggest that he was buried in Valletta. He was definitely dead by 14 May 1615, when his mother Mattea made her will and referred to masses for the repose of Vittorio's soul. Buildings attributed to Cassar Saint Mary's Tower, which was attributed to Cassar by Giovanni Francesco Abela. This claim is unlikely since Cassar was already dead when work on the tower began. There is very little documentary evidence about Cassar's work as an architect or military engineer. The only evidence of his work as a military engineer are documents relating to his directing the rebuilding of the Cittadella between 1600 and 1603, and mentions of preliminary sketches of the Garzes Tower dated 1601–02. Many other buildings have been attributed to Cassar, but these claims are dubious and unlikely, since there is no evidence supporting them. As early as 1647, Giovanni Francesco Abela attributed the design of the Saint Mary's Tower on Comino (built 1618) to Cassar. In 1703, Bartolomeo dal Pozzo attributed both the Comino tower and Santa Maria delle Grazie Tower (built 1620) to him, and the claim was later extended to include three other Wignacourt towers – St. Paul (1610), St. Lucian (1610–11) and St. Thomas (1614) towers. However, Cassar is believed to have died in 1609, before work on the first Wignacourt tower had begun. Parish Church of St. Mary in Birkirkara, one of several churches attributed to Cassar without any evidence supporting the claim The following churches are attributed to Cassar, but once again there is no documentary evidence supporting any of these attributions. *Our Lady of Victories Parish Church in Senglea ( 1580) *Church of St. George in Qormi ( 1584) *Church of St. Philip of Agira in Żebbuġ ( 1599) *Church of St. Mary in Attard ( 1600) *Parish Church of St. Mary in Birkirkara ( 1615) *Church of Our Lady of Victory in Naxxar ( 1610) *St. Ubaldesca Church in Paola (1630) Personal life Vittorio Cassar was short tempered and was often involved in quarrels and criminal offences. He was imprisoned for six months in Fort St. Angelo after harassing another knight and beating his servant. In 1604, he and his brother Gabriele were involved in a fight with some \\"secular persons\\". The circumstances of this incident are unknown, but it was regarded as a serious offence. Between the 1590s and 1606, the Inquisition accused and sentenced Cassar for practicing fortune-telling, and he was said to be able to relieve people and read their future. He is said to have had a relationship with Gioanna La Siracusana, a magician and prostitute. It is now believed that Cassar's \\"sins\\" included possession of banned manuscripts about magic which he had obtained in Messina.

He was the founder of the Ontario Skeptics and a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI). Early life Gordon according to his wife Zita was a self-taught mechanic and very interested in radio repair. In 1940 when he was twenty, while walking down the street in Montreal Gordon spotted an advertisement for radio operators for the Royal Canadian Air Force. He enlisted and helped start an air training camp in western Canada. He was discharged from the service in December 1941 and opened up what might have been the first public recording studio in Montreal. In the 1960s Gordon opened up what was the first party supply store in Montreal. Henry Gordon's Party Centre whose motto was \\"Everything for enjoyment under one roof\\". The store was open for nineteen years. Magic career Gordon's interest in magic came because he wandered into a bookstore in Winnipeg in 1940. Bored, he picked up a book on coin magic, he later said it was,\\"a terrible book ... but it passed the time\\"'. By the 1950s Gordon was performing at banquets and for servicemen. He said he performed for '\\"every hospital and old folks home in Montreal\\"'. He joined the International Brotherhood of Magicians soon after. Gordon penned a column called \\"It's Magic\\" for Starship, the children's page of the Toronto Star, in which he explained the secrets of stage tricks. \\"He knew his magic so well, and was such a capable writer, that kids could actually do the tricks.\\" former Starship editor John Robinson said. The phrase \\"Kemo Kimo Merinickel Pumpernickel\\" was created by Gordon as an incantation for his magic. According to his wife Zita, Gordon fell in love with the \\"art and psychology\\" of magic, and found it relaxing. In the 1950s Gordon opened up a party store which for nineteen years included a school for magic. He \\"always referred to magic as a fine art and to himself as an honest fraud\\". Gordon felt that scientists were the easiest to fool '\\"because scientists work by rational, logical rules and the use of deception breaks all the rules - it's as simple as that\\"'. By 1965 Gordon began to move toward mentalism. At first he did not use a disclaimer and allowed his audience to decide if he was psychic or not. But over time he started to see that people were taking his act seriously and this concerned him as at this same time he discovered some magicians were using old vaudeville tricks and passing themselves off as psychic. Even after telling people that he was using tricks, some people still thought Gordon was a psychic but hiding his true abilities. This was frustrating for Gordon as he felt he was in a dilemma. In the 1970s Gordon and his wife were booked as a magician act for the Holland America Lines cruise ships, he said of this time '\\"It proved to be very successful, particularly when sailing through the Bermuda Triangle\\"' especially when he was able to do lectures on debunking pseudoscience. Upon Gordon's death, a broken wand ceremony was carried out by Ron Guttman, past president of the Sid Lorraine Hat and Rabbit Club, the Toronto branch of the International Brotherhood of Magicians (IBM). The broken wand symbolizes broken hearts at Henry's absence. It also represents the fact that a wand without its magician is of no use. \\"We send Henry into the mystery of all mysteries\\", said Guttman, concluding the ceremony. The Club had awarded Henry an Order of Merlin, which recognizes a member's service of over twenty-five years to IBM. Henry Gordon (yellow shirt) with wife Zita, Eli Shneour (striped shirt), astronomer James McGaha and Neil deGrasse Tyson at 1996 CSICOP conference Skeptic Gordon had been interested in claims of the paranormal since the late 1940s and read every book he could find on ghosts, ESP, UFO's and astrology. Gordon wasn't so sure about UFO's and thought maybe there was some possibility they existed, but then in 1952 he read Martin Gardner's book In the Name of Science later to be published as Fads and Fallacies. The next influential book sealed Gordon's fate as a skeptic was D.H. Rawcliffe's The Psychology of the Occult. His first experience speaking as a debunker on mainstream media was an interview on the evening news for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) on November 1, 1960. He was interviewed by a young Peter Jennings. Gordon explains that he was given this opportunity because he had done a thirteen-week series on magic for the CBC and had all the necessary paperwork in order. In 1966 he was interviewed by the CBC show Seven on Six and given seven minutes. Finally in 1969, the media was beginning to become very interested in the paranormal which meant Gordon was receiving more appearances, he was interviewed on the CBC show The Occult and in 1975, on the CTV network for Canada AM. In 1977 he was given a thirteen week program on the CBC called Morningside. Gordon says that up until 1978 he felt like the lone skeptic, he was unaware of other like-minded people who shared his passion for debunking the paranormal. In 1978 he was asked to be a speaker at a symposium at Concordia University where he met fellow speakers Paul Kurtz and Ray Hyman. Gordon says that CSICOP \\"opened new worlds for me\\". He was first appointed a Scientific and Technical Consultant and they set up CSICOP Canada. The group existed for two years before smaller skeptical groups started springing up around the world. Gordon became the founder and first chair of the Ontario Skeptics, a precursor to Skeptics Canada. He was also a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), and was well known for his debunking of the claims of self-proclaimed psychics such as Peter Hurkos Gordon also participated as a debunker on numerous radio and television shows in both Canada and the United States, including The Great Debate, People Are Talking, Larry King Live and The Oprah Winfrey Show, and taught a course called \\"An Objective Inquiry into Psychic Phenomena\\" at McGill University from 1979–1981. Paranormal propondent Allen Spraggett offered Gordon $100 on CBC's Morningside if he could do a trick that he (Spraggett) could not explain. Gordon pulled out three small sponge balls from his pocket and turned them into 16 balls. Spraggett could not figure out the trick, and Gordon replied that he invents his own tricks, and that \\"Just because something can't be explained doesn't mean there's some psychic gobbledygook at work\\". Gordon's first debunking column appeared in the weekly Montreal newspaper The Suburban (the first such column of its kind in North America), and then, after moving to Toronto, Gordon wrote the debunking column \\"Extrasensory Deception\\" for two years for the Toronto Sun, and wrote the regular column \\"Debunking\\" for the Toronto Star's Sunday paper for more than twenty years. According to the Toronto Star editor, Gerry Hall, \\"Henry turned his critical eye to everything from UFO sightings to psychic detectives and chiropractors\\". Many of Gordon's columns were published in his book Extrasensory Deception: ESP, Psychics, Shirley MacLaine, Ghosts, UFOs (Macmillan of Canada, 1988). In 1992 the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP) presented Gordon with the Responsibility in Journalism Award. The challenge of teaching the public to think critically was a subject Gordon talked about often. In a 1990 article for The Journal Times he told the interviewer that it felt like it was a losing battle at times, '\\"We're trying to combat the wave of irrationalism that is actually sweeping the continent and the world\\"'. He understood the need to want to believe in the paranormal, felt that people had a strong desire to want to think that there is something after death. He had investigated ghosts, psychics and other paranormal claims and always found a natural explanation. \\"... as long as there is doubt, people will believe the books, call the 900 numbers and watch the television specials\\". Uri Geller In a 1975 article for The Gazette, Gordon challenged Uri Geller to a \\"sleight-of-hand duel\\". Gordon said of Geller '\\"The bending- of-objects act is a lot of bunk that Geller's made a big name of ... he has never tried any of his feats when magicians are present. After all, I can bend keys too\\". In 1987 Gordon was asked to appear on WBZ-TV Boston with Uri Geller. Gordon warned the station that Geller would cancel if he found out that a magician was also appearing, so the station called Gordon a colominist. Geller and Gordon sat side by side on a couch with a small table in front of them. As Gordon describes it in the book Skeptical Odysseys, Geller was doing his moving the compass needle act. Geller \\"bent over the compass, grunting and waving his hands over it. But the needle stayed motionless. He expressed some surprise, then tried again. ... (Geller) had someone in his retinue bring in another compass ... no luck ... I suggested, '\\"Uri, maybe your magnet isn't strong enough.\\" Magnet, what magnet?\\"' he exploded, then returned to the watches. No success there either. When we were about to go off the air he insisted on getting back to the compass. No luck ... '\\"I've been blocked!\\"' He was. The powerful magnet I had strapped above my knee under my slacks, was much stronger than his, and had already locked in the needle\\". Psychics In 1977 for the radio morning show for CJAD Gordon was asked to appear at a recording held at one of the local Montreal downtown restaurants as a psychic. The host Andy Barrie was himself a skeptic and magician, and between the two men they worked out that Gordon would appear in disguise as the psychic Elchonen, and Barrie would pretend Elchonen could perform miracles. Elchonen/Gordon shattered a wing glass just using psychokinesis, and the restaurant audience applauded vigorously. At the end of the show Barrie revealed that Elchonen was actually '\\"Henry Gordon, our well-known Montreal magician, who makes the point that you can all be taken in by this type of fakery\\"'. On the CBC show As It Happens, Gordon told the story of how he visited a Ottawa psychic named Ian Bortz who was charging $75 an hour. Gordon asked Bortz to help him find his dead sister, '\\"It took him all of 15 seconds to make contact. He told me that she was in Belgium helping deprived children and that she was happy. The only catch is I've never had a sister\\"'. On CKO radio, Gordon called out Yogi Narayana who was a psychic business advisor. Narayana had predicted a local election result, Gordon told the audience '\\"So did my barber\\"'. On a People Are Talking episode in 1988, Gordon was introduced as a psychic by the host who was \\"in on it\\". Gordon did his bit, fooled the audience and just before the \\"reveal\\" Gordon asked if he could do a reading of the host. Gordon, (still in character as a psychic) proceeded to tell the host very personal information, \\"one of his eyes had been affected because he had been a forceps delivery when born\\". The host's \\"jaw dropped\\". Gordon eventually explained to the host and the audience that he had questioned one of the assistants before coming on the show who had known the host for years personally. A common psychic technique known as Hot reading. \\"Of such miracles do psychics make their reputations\\" Gordon claimed. Concerning psychic detectives, Gordon contacted police departments around North America and found no one who said that they had ever had a psychic solve a case. Psychic Earl Carley had claimed to have solved an Atlanta child murder case, and Gordon contacted the FBI to verify this, but was told that Carley had '\\"no impact on the case\\"'. =Elchonen= In 1977, Gordon managed to convince the manager of the Saidye Bronfman Theatre to book him as a psychic, saying that they would have a \\"packed house\\". The idea was that Gordon would be wearing a mask and when onstage use lowlights an accent and use the name Elchonen. He claimed that he needed conceal his real identity because his testing had been done under \\"strict secrecy\\" and he had to '\\"protect my reputation as a scientist\\"'. The theatre received a lot of interview requests from the media, but they knew Gordon would be recognized so they were all turned down. The theatre claimed that Elchonen had been tested in by University parapsychology labs in America and Europe and this would be his first stage performance. There were over 200 in attendance, having had to add chairs for extra attendees. Elchonen/Gordon gave a lecture and then performed \\"miracles\\" which were actually all magic tricks. One was that he made a rocking chair move from standing 10 feet away. He caused a light to blink on a potted plant proving plants had a psychic connection. He saw into sealed envelopes describing the lives of the people in the audience. According to Gordon's account, \\"the audience was overwhelmed. Remember, it consisted of a majority of believers who had attended the performance to reinforce their own belief systems\\". Elchonen walked off stage as a psychic and a few minutes later reemerged as Gordon the local magician (and psychic debunker). When Gordon went up to the microphone he asked the audience '\\"How many of you people believed the fraud who was just here?\\"' When over a third of the audience raised their hands, Gordon said '\\"Hundreds of thousands of people are being taken in by fakes - that's why I pulled this hoax ... I'm a magician ... and so are the psychics\\"'. The results from the audience were mixed, many people recognized him, some were \\"indignant at being taken in - others accepted it good-naturally\\", and others walked out. Gordon finished off the show with an ESP demonstration. Some in attendance demanded their $3 back claiming they came to see a psychic demonstration not a lecture. Gordon conceded but also said \\"'I'm a magician, and so are they (psychics)\\"'. Shirley MacLaine Gordon began getting interested in the paranormal \\"side career\\" of Shirley MacLaine in the mid 1980s. He began by reading every one of her books \\"from cover to cover - not an easy thing to do. The reading, that is, not the buying\\". he also recorded audio and video for all the programs he could find her on. Once he had gathered all this research he wrote to Paul Kurtz who ran Prometheus Books and in 1988 was able to publish Channeling into the New Age: The \\"Teachings\\" of Shirley MacLaine and Other Such Gurus. Gordon writes that MacLaine wasn't his biggest fan and during an interview in Australia while she was on tour, she was asked about Gordon's book. She responded that he was \\"making a living out of criticizing her\\". Gordon conceded defeat after seeing her books continued to be on the New York Times best-seller list. In an interview with The Vancouver Sun, Gordon said that he had been able to interview MacLaine once, it was \\"like nailing Jello to the wall\\". Personal life In 1941, Henry Gordon married Zita, who was then working as his magician's assistant, and the two remained married for 68 years. Henry and Zita had two children, Laura and Sandra, and several grandchildren. According to his obituary, Gordon was a \\"Royal Canadian Air Force Veteran and radio instructor for the British Commonwealth\\". He was also a member of Mensa. When in 1988 Gordon was asked about his religious beliefs he stated that he is Jewish, but non-practicing. \\"I believe in upholding the ethical values of Judaism\\". He said he does not believe in a personal God that can be prayed to, he stated that he is agnostic. Publications *Extrasensory Deception: ESP, Psychics, Shirley MacLaine, Ghosts, UFOs. (1988).

History Simms migrated to South Australia from England, arriving in December 1845. The ship on which he arrived remains a mystery. He formed a partnership with John Hayter and in 1852 purchased the Pirie Street Brewery from its founder James Walsh. In 1853 Simms & Hayter took over the mail business of John and James Chambers, which proved highly profitable. Hayter left in 1855, then was proved insolvent in 1859. From 1856 the firm of W. K. Simms & Co. ran the Halifax Street Brewery, then in 1861 took over the famous West End Brewery, off Hindley Street near West Terrace, and built it up into a highly profitable business; from 1866 to 1879 with partner Edgar Chapman. In 1874 they sent senior employee Charles Mallen Mallen left their employ when he was refused a share in the business. to New South Wales to found what became the \\"Adelaide Brewery\\" in Waverley, SydneyG. L. Fischer, 'Chapman, Edgar (1831–1886)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published in hardcopy 1969, accessed online 8 March 2014 with Hampton Carroll Gleeson. In 1888 the West End Brewery was taken over by the South Australian Brewing and Malting Company. That business later amalgamated with Edwin Smith's Kent Town Brewing Company, whose malt towers remain a prominent East Adelaide landmark. Simms remained a director of the company until his death, but his duties were not onerous, and his dividends immense. Other activities Broken Hill mine He was a director of Equitable Fire Insurance Co. Politics In 1867 he was elected to the Adelaide City Council for the Gawler ward. He proved to be a popular representative and was elected to the House of Assembly in 1868 for the West Adelaide district, with H. R. Fuller as his colleague. The fifth Parliament was dissolved on 2 March 1870 and Simms did not stand for the ensuing election, but was again elected on 14 December 1871, with Judah Moss Solomon as colleague. On 10 February 1875 Simms was again elected, with Thomas Johnson filling the other seat. He resigned in June 1876, thus allowing John Darling, Sr., to take his place, but he won again in April 1878 in conjunction with Hugh Fraser. He finally retired from the Assembly in March 1881, when he was succeeded by C. C. Kingston. Simms remained out of Parliament until 28 February 1884, when he was a candidate at the first election for the Central district of the Legislative Council, his opponent being Philip Santo. Previously the Council had been chosen by the whole colony voting in one electorate, but by the Constitution Act of 1881 its strength was increased from 18 to 24 members, and it was divided into four electoral districts. The first vacancy under the new system was caused by the death of Sir William Morgan, and Simms won in a close and hard-fought contest. He resigned from the Council on 14 April 1891. During his long period in politics he never sought a Cabinet position or personal gain, never engaged in party politics, and retained a high popularity with fellow members and electors alike. Racing He was a keen race-goer and supported the Totalizator Bill, steering it through to its second reading, but never owned a thoroughbred. He was present at the meeting held at the John Bull Hotel, Adelaide, in October 1861, for the purpose of putting racing in the colony on a more satisfactory footing, and was elected a member of the club then established, known as the Second South Australian Jockey Club, and was elected to its committee, along with E. M. Bagot, P. B. Coglin, G. Bennett, and W. Blackler. Simms resigned on 11 January 1864, but on the 20th of the same month he was elected to fill the vacancy caused by the retirement of Coglin, and continued to hold the office for several years. In 1864, at his instigation, it was decided to dispense with sweepstakes and substitute fixed sums as prizes. In those days the Adelaide Cup was worth £500 with a sweepstake of 50 sovereigns added. In 1866 when the S.A.J.C. became financially embarrassed, Simms was one of the guarantors for the payment of the overdraft at the National Bank. C. B. Fisher resigned his membership of the committee in 1867, and Simms was appointed chairman. In that year P. B. Coglin proposed the handing over of the lease of tho Old Course to the Jockey Club on the club accepting the liabilities, but the proposition was not entertained. Mr. Simms took an active part in promoting the race meeting held on the Old Course in 1869 in honour of the visit of Prince Alfred, the Duke of Edinburgh. He was one of those who met at the Old Stock Exchange on 19 September 1888 to re-form the South Australian Jockey Club. Family life Simms married Jane Faulkner (c. 1829 – 28 August 1905). They had four sons (one, William, died aged three) and three daughters: *Alfred Simms (c. 1853 – 30 May 1901) married Priscilla Chambers (ca.1854 – 17 November 1924), daughter of John Chambers, on 17 June 1874. He was a member of the Adelaide Stock Exchange, and in 1887 with partner W. B. Rounsevell took over Johnston & Furniss, the Grenfell Street wine and spirit merchants, to form Rounsevell & Simms, which in February 1888 joined with the Kent Town Brewery and the West End Brewery to form The South Australian Brewing, Malting, and Wine and Spirit Company. Substantial additions (reredos, lady chapel, vestries, arches and apse) were made to St. Peter's Cathedral, North Adelaide in memory of Alfred Simms by his wife. *Harry Simms was a member of the Melbourne Stock Exchange. Around 1900 he left Australia to live in Hampstead, England. *Clara Jane Simms (1855 – ) married solicitor Paul Frederick \\"Fred\\" Bonnin (died 14 September 1901) on 25 December 1876. :She married again, to Whitmore Blake Carr (died August 1943), on 2 June 1904. *Elinor/Eleanor Ann Simms (1857 – 2 February 1900) married Alexander Frederick Fisher of Croydon on 25 November 1879. She divorced him in 1887. She married again, to solicitor Charles Grant Varley on 5 May 1888. *Louisa Simms (c. 1857 – 24 April 1910) married Cavendish Lister Colley (c. 1848 – 14 April 1906), son of R. B. Colley on 12 December 1883. *Edward \\"Ned\\" Simms (c. 1864 – 1 September 1909) married Emma Louise \\"Louie\\" Noltenius, daughter of Henry Noltenius on 8 May 1890. They lived at Victoria Place, Glenelg, overlooking Colley Reserve. Simms suffered greatly from rheumatism in later life and made trips to the spas of Germany and New Zealand seeking relief. His end though, was swift and he was buried in St Jude's Church cemetery , Brighton. A stained glass window (depicting St Mark, the Evangelist) in St. Peter's Church, Glenelg, is dedicated to his memory. Estate His estate at death was valued at £345,000 (more than AUD 500,000,000 today). A legal dispute arose as to whether gifts he made by deed poll to his family were an attempt to evade succession duty, and therefore liable for double taxation.

The assaillants were able to take control of the southern part of the city. Reinforcements sent by the opponent included an infantry regiment two battalions and batteries. A stormy weather prevented the soviet to get back up. They battled during 3 days against superior forces. Meanwhile, in the city occurred an uprising which participants along with local partisans joined the fight alongside the soviet troopers. Among 700 assaillants remained alive a mere hundred by the time the battle ended. The operation succeeded in distracting German forces from Sevastopol as well as allowing for troops on the Kerch peninsula more to prepare to withstand German assaults. The marines taken prisoners along with some 3000 civilians were shot later on the Red Hill part of the 10,400 people shot here during the war.

Players are tasked with constructing an efficient rail transit network for a rapidly growing city. Stations are represented by differently shaped nodes and players can build tracks to connect them by drawing lines. Levels are based on real cities and the appearance of stations and passengers is procedurally generated. The game's visual style makes use of bold colours and simple geometry to replicate the appearance of modern transit maps. The game uses a procedural audio system to generate sounds based on the player actions and transit network. The rhythms and sounds created took inspiration from works of minimal music. Mini Metro was conceived in April 2013 for a video game development competition, with a prototype version being released freely for web browsers. During the game's conception phase, the developers imposed a set of constraints to limit its scope and ensure the project could reach a finished state. Production of the game continued following the event and an in-development version was released commercially on Linux, OS X, and Windows in August 2014. Mini Metro received its full release on PC platforms in November 2015, on Android and iOS platforms in October 2016, plus Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 ports in 2018 and 2019 respectively. The game received a positive reception, with praise for its intuitive interface, simple gameplay, and minimalist approach. Gameplay Mini Metro is a puzzle strategy video game, in which players are tasked with building an efficient rail transit network for a rapidly growing city. Each level is a flat depiction of a real city and begins with three train stations. Train stations are represented by different shaped nodes. Players can construct routes to link stations by drawing lines between them; each route has a different colour. Passengers appear at stations, each denoted by a shape that identifies which station they want to travel to. Trains travel along routes taking passengers to their desired stations. Rivers, intersecting train lines and the appearance of more stations and passengers over time causes the transit network to become more complex and difficult to manage. Common-shaped stations can also change their node shape into rarer ones. The game's visual style is minimalist, employing straight lines and bold colours, similar to modern transit maps. In the \\"Normal\\" game mode, each station can accommodate a limited capacity of waiting passengers; if the stations become too congested and the threshold is reached, the level ends. Upon failing, players can continue to build their network in the \\"Endless\\" game mode where stations do not have a limited capacity. To alleviate the network's growth, players earn upgrades each week of in-game time. At each upgrade, the player receives a new train car and a choice among two other random options such as an extra rail line, an extra train carriage, extra tunnels, or an interchange (which increases a station's capacity and allows trains to instantly load/unload passengers). In addition, the transit simulation can be paused at any point to allow for reconstruction and adjustments to train routes. In \\"Extreme\\" mode lines between stations cannot be adjusted once their position is set. In 2018 a \\"Creative\\" gamemode was added, which allows players to create, adjust and add stations in the game. This game mode is grid-based gives the player almost unlimited train cars, train carriages, tunnels or interchanges. Development and release Mini Metro was developed by Dinosaur Polo Club, a two-man independent video game development studio based in New Zealand. It is the first game from the studio, which was founded in 2013 by brothers Peter and Robert Curry. They had previously worked at video game developer Sidhe, but left in 2006 to pursue a career in developing indie games. Following a series of abandoned projects, Peter Curry recognised that he would have to restrict the scope of his projects in order to complete them, and with hopes of releasing a finished product, the brothers set a number of constraints while proposing ideas for a prototype game. Minimising the amount of production art was a necessary restriction, as they had little experience in creating art assets. Likewise, they did not want the game's concept to rely on audio content, due to lack of skills in producing music. They also did not want to hand-build each level in the game. Imposing these constraints meant that they could discard most of their potential game ideas immediately, and led to them concentrating on concepts that involved procedurally generated levels and abstract visual styles. Development of Mini Metro began in April 2013, under the title Mind the Gap. Robert Curry suggested building a mass transit navigation game after visiting London and using its Underground system. The concept was to let the player build a transit system that navigates intelligent agents around, with nodes and lines representing train stations and tracks respectively. It was prototyped over a weekend, and entered in the Ludum Dare 26 video game development competition. They chose to develop the game using the Unity game engine. The Unity Web Player allowed them to release a freely playable web browser version of the prototype during the competition, so more people would have access to play it. Mind the Gap was ranked number 1 in the \\"Innovation\\" category and number 7 in the \\"Overall\\" category during the competition. Part-time development on the game continued after the event concluded. The members of the original Mini Metro development team In September 2013, the first playable alpha version of Mini Metro was released. They decided to keep the web version of the game freely available, at least until the release of the final game. They also submitted Mini Metro on Steam Greenlight, a community voting system that allows games to be released on digital distribution service Steam. Initially, they intended on releasing the final version of the game by the end of 2013, however despite the game's limited scope, development took far longer than they had expected. A graphical overhaul, issues within the game's balance, and scheduling someone to work on the game's audio contributed to its delay. In August 2014, they decided to release an in-development version of the game commercially through Steam Early Access. They felt that the early access model was suitable for Mini Metro because the game was designed to have replay value and there was no fixed narrative to be spoiled. They continually released new builds of the game based on the community's feedback. The early access release provided them with funds to work full-time on the game. Peter Curry had been working on Mini Metro full-time since March 2014, and his brother Robert started working full- time in November 2014. Originally Mini Metro was being built for mobile platforms, however they shifted their focus to desktop PCs because of the ability to release their game in the early access state. The brothers hired external help to address two of their initial issues: art and audio. Jamie Churchman, a former colleague at Sidhe, oversaw the visual design for Mini Metro and also contributed to the game design. They approached American composer Disasterpeace to work on the game's audio. He developed a procedural audio system that would generate sounds based on events in the game. Each level in the game has a corresponding set of rhythms and sounds; the harmonic structure of these elements changes based on the size and shape of the player's subways system. The audio was inspired by minimalism and the works of Philip Glass and Steve Reich. On 6 November 2015, Mini Metro was released out of early access for Linux, OS X, and Windows. Dinosaur Polo Club partnered with Playism and Plug In Digital to release the game on digital storefronts, and Koch Media to distribute the game in retail stores in Europe. A version for Android (published by PlaydigiousDinosaur Polo Club on Twitter, \\"We’re stoked to be working with Playdigious on Mini Metro! They’re working to make sure we have the best possible Android release.\\", 28 September 2016.) and for iOS were released on 18 October 2016. The game's release on 30 August 2018 for the Nintendo Switch also added a multiplayer mode exclusive to the platform. A PlayStation 4 port was released on 10 September 2019. Reception Mini Metro received \\"generally favourable\\" reception from critics according to aggregate review website Metacritic. Technology Tell writer, Jenni Lada described Mini Metro as \\"aesthetically pleasing\\" and found playing the game an oddly relaxing experience, despite the game's attempt to put the player under pressure. Lena LeRay, of IndieGames.com, also felt that Mini Metro had a relaxing tone and complimented its intuitive interface. LeRay appreciated changes that were made during the early access phase, noting that audio and the Daily Challenge mode were welcome additions, and the interface improvements had diminished her initial complaints about the game. Reviewing the PC version, GamesTM thought that the depth of Mini Metros gameplay along with the difficulty scaling kept the game interesting. However, they did question why the game hadn't been released for smartphones yet, pointing out that such devices would be suited for the game's simple interface. Kill Screen editor, Ethan Gach commended the game for its simplicity and elegance, having combined interactive aesthetics with a robust simulation. Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun praised the game for being a \\"mesmerising challenge of logic and aesthetics\\". He particularly enjoyed how beautifully the gameplay descended into chaos as the difficulty gradually increased, calling it \\"elegant even in disaster\\". He also thought that Mini Metro was a good example of how to release game in early access. Reviewing the mobile version, Gamezebo writer Rob Rich commended the visual design and intuitive touch controls. He thought that the use of geometric shapes to represent commuters and stations helped simplify the complicated tasks, resulting in an accessible game. Pocket Gamer reviewer Christian Valentin remarked that the game felt confusing early on but became \\"surprisingly engaging\\". At the 2016 Independent Games Festival, Mini Metro won an award for \\"Excellence in Audio\\", and was nominated for awards in three other categories: \\"Excellence in Visual Art\\", \\"Excellence in Design\\", and the \\"Seumas McNally Grand Prize\\". Mini Metro also received a nomination for \\"Debut Game\\" at the 12th British Academy Games Awards, and received an honourable mention for \\"Best Debut\\" at the 16th Annual Game Developers Choice Awards. GameSpot listed Mini Metro in their best five mobile games of 2016.

It is presented as found footage of a documentary crew's experience exploring the Catacombs of Paris and was loosely based on the seven layers of Hell. The film was produced by Legendary Pictures and distributed by Universal Pictures, making it the first film in Legendary's deal with Universal. The film was released on August 29, 2014, and stars Perdita Weeks, Ben Feldman, Edwin Hodge, François Civil, Marion Lambert, and Ali Marhyar. Plot Scarlett Marlowe illegally enters Iran to explore a historical cave system before the regime demolishes it. Minutes before the destruction of the caves, she finds a legendary statue within known as the \\"Rose Key,\\" bearing ancient engravings in the Aramaic language. Scarlett successfully records the Rose Key inscriptions on video and flees, but when a strange man appears to call for her from the caves, she is caught in the collapse of the cave and just narrowly escapes. Before she gets out, however, she sees a vision of her father's suicide - a moment from her past that she will have to confront later on. Months later, Scarlett is filming a documentary with her cameraman Benji. The introduction reveals she is a young but accomplished professor of archaeology and an alchemy scholar with multiple Doctor of Philosophy degrees (Phds) and fluency in four languages. Scarlett is interested in continuing her father's hunt for the philosopher's stone after his suicide. The stone is a legendary alchemical substance capable of turning base metals into gold or silver and of granting eternal life, said to have been discovered by Nicolas Flamel. Scarlett travels to Paris to find George, her former lover and an Aramaic translator, so that she can decipher the Rose Key. She finds him repairing a centuries-old church bell tower. With the Rose Key's translated text and information from Flamel's headstone, Scarlett deciphers the philosopher's stone is 370 meters below- ground in the Catacombs of Paris. The trio attend an official tour of the catacombs, but the section thought to contain the stone is off-limits. A stranger in the catacombs suggests that a man named Papillon can help and that he spends time in a certain club. When their backs are turned, the man disappears and they are forced to rejoin the tour. Scarlett convinces Papillon that they will find treasure in the catacombs. Papillon, his girlfriend Souxie, and friend Zed take Scarlett, George, and Benji to an entrance for the off-limits section of the catacombs hidden inside a train tunnel. George refuses to go because his brother drowned in a cave, but he is forced to come with the group when a policeman attempts to stop them. Zed throws flashbangs through the hole to discourage pursuit. Upon entering, Papillon immediately shows the group some female cultists singing in the tunnels. As they continue deciphering riddles to proceed, they find a blocked tunnel and another barely passable tunnel strewn with bones. Scarlett believes breaching the first tunnel would cut hours from their travel time. However, Papillion refuses to go that way, as anyone who has gone through was never seen again. Papillion explains that his friend La Taupe (\\"The Mole\\") lived in the caves for years, but still disappeared after he decided to explore the blocked tunnel. After Benji gets stuck in the tunnel filled with bones, it collapses behind them, and the group somehow finds themselves at the blocked tunnel again with no other way forward. They breach the blockage and find Papillon's graffiti tag on the wall, even though he insists he has never been there. Suddenly, the group hears a telephone ringing in the abandoned caves. When Scarlett finds and answers the phone, a man (who is later revealed to be her father) asks why she won't answer his calls. Scarlett hangs up, rattled. The crew come across a piano at the site where more than a hundred people fell to their deaths when the building above collapsed over a century ago, a piano that George believes is the same one he played on as a child with his younger brother. Shortly after La Taupe appears before them alive, but dazed and blank-faced. La Taupe agrees to guide them out and informs them the only way out is down. They eventually find a tomb with a well-preserved Templar Knight, a mound of treasure, and what Scarlett believes to be Flamel's Stone embedded in a mural depicting an ancient legend. Removing the stone, Scarlett realizes too late that the treasure is a trap, and the room collapses. La Taupe is lost under the rubble along with their supplies, and Souxie is seriously injured. Using the Flamel Stone, Scarlett magically heals Souxie's injuries. They find a drawing of a door on the ceiling along with a Gnostic Star of David, symbolizing \\"As above, so below\\", revealing a door hidden in the floor. Going through the opening, they find a passage marked with the phrase \\"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here\\" in Greek, identical to the entrance to Hell in Dante's Inferno. Despite Papillon's reluctance, Scarlett crawls through the tunnel and leads the group into a dark reflection of the room they left, which somehow seals behind them, effectively trapping them. Here they find a living La Taupe, whom the group presumed to be dead. When Souxie reaches out to touch La Taupe, he brutally kills her before disappearing in the narrow tunnels. Scarlett attempts to revive her but quickly realizes the stone cannot bring back the dead. The survivors realize they must continue and go even deeper to escape. At this point they are now one thousand meters underground, passing through what George calls \\"mirror images\\" of areas they have already been earlier. Along the way, while the group rappels down a hole, Benji catches a glimpse of a female cultist holding a baby before falling to his death. George finds his deceased brother under a pile of bones, but Scarlett convinces him it is an illusion before he can dig it up. Next, the group encounters a burning car. Inside is a man who looks similar to the stranger that directed Scarlett to Papillon. Papillon recognizes the car and the man from an incident in his past. When he cries out that the incident was not his fault, Papillion is sucked into the car, which then crumples and merges into the ground so that only Papillon's legs can be seen sticking out of the floor. The remaining crew flee. George confesses to Scarlett that whatever should happen to them down here, their previous trip to Turkey was the best time of his life, and Scarlett agrees. As the trio continue on, the walls become visibly imprinted with tortured faces and disembodied screams shatter their nerves. They come across a demonic, humanoid abomination sitting in a chair. When it rises, the group runs and hides, but a face in the wall breaks out and tears open George's throat with its teeth. While Scarlett and Zed drag George to relative safety, they discover the stone will not heal his injuries. George murmurs the acronym \\"Vitriol\\", which in Latin refers to the philosopher's stone being discovered by rectification, (as in correction). Scarlett realizes the Flamel Stone itself is yet another riddle, and only by returning it to its original spot will she find the real stone. Scarlett, now alone, races back to the crypt where she found the Flamel Stone. Along the way, she finds a hanged man, whom she recognizes as her father. After nearly being drowned in a river of blood by an unseen force, she makes her way to the crypt and returns the Flamel Stone to its place in the mural. Underneath the stone's setting she notices a polished mirror surface, and realizes she has the magical abilities of the stone within herself now. On her way back to George and Zed, Scarlett passes her father's apparition on her way and apologizes for her failure to answer his phone calls when he was struggling with suicidal thoughts. She returns to her friends, kisses George, and lays her hands on his neck, healing him. Echoing sounds continue to heighten as Scarlett, George, and Zed press on to find a way out. They reach a dead end only to find a seemingly bottomless hole. George and Zed are convinced that it's impossible to rope their way down the hole. Scarlett explains that they must confront what torments them to escape the reflected reality. George reflects on how his brother drowned because he got lost when going for help, and Zed confesses he has been denying responsibility for a bastard child. Hooded demons chase them, and the group jumps down the hole. Though the fall should be too deep to survive, they reach the bottom alive. Eventually, Scarlett, George, and Zed find a manhole on the floor, which when pushed down and climbed through delivers them right-side up onto the surface, on a street overlooking the Notre Dame. After a group hug, Scarlett and George embrace each other while Zed wanders away, finally safe. In a past log, Scarlett states that her mission is to find the truth.

There was very little use of props, as the actors had to use the environment around them. Production in the actual catacombs was difficult for the cast and especially the crew as there was no electricity or cell phone service in the centuries-old tunnels. As Ben Feldman suffered from claustrophobia, he had to keep taking breaks to cope. Distribution =Marketing= The first trailer of the film was revealed on April 24, 2014. YouTuber PewDiePie and his wife Marzia Bisognin promoted the film by embarking on a quest into the catacombs, where they would be scared in a variety of ways. As Above, So Below was released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 2, 2014. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 26% based on 77 reviews and an average rating of 4.42/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"After an intriguing setup that threatens to claw its way out of found-footage overkill, As Above, So Below plummets into clichéd mediocrity.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 38 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews.\\" Peter Debruge gave the film a mixed review in Variety, writing, \\"It all makes for clumsy-fun escapism, not bad as end-of-summer chillers go, but small-time compared with other Legendary releases.\\" Debruge also called the ending \\"unspeakably corny.\\" Kyle Anderson's review in Entertainment Weekly stated, \\"As Above has some genuine scares. The stakes begin as gut-wrenchingly real with the team feeling disoriented hundreds of meters beneath the streets, but the film gets downright silly once the caverns become malevolently sentient. Bruce Demara wrote in The Toronto Star, \\"As Above, So Below has some good scares and a decent cast. But it's yet another found footage thriller, so jittery camera sequences may induce nausea.\\" Peter Bradshaw stated in The Guardian. \\"There are some interestingly contrived moments of claustrophobia and surreal lunacy, but this clichéd and slightly hand-me-down script neither scares nor amuses very satisfyingly. Drew Hunt expressed similar sentiments in The Chicago Reader, writing \\"An intriguing and intensely creepy premise is squandered on this rudimentary found-footage horror film.\\" Terry Staunton gave the film a mildly positive review in Radio Times, stating, \\"It's a perfectly serviceable addition to the 'found footage' genre of chillers from director/co-writer John Erick Dowdle (Devil), who puts cameras in each character's helmet, allowing quick cuts from one scene to another. But despite the claustrophobia of the setting, he never quite racks up enough tension for a full-on fright-fest.\\" The entertainment oriented website JoBlo wrote, \\"Not the worst example of found footage by a long shot, and it moves a decent pace with a couple of good scares. However, this could have been a far more frightening feature if only it had expanded on its scary premise.\\" =Box office= The film grossed $8.3 million its opening weekend, finishing in 3rd place. As of November 4, 2014, the film had grossed $21.2 million in North America and $18.9 million in other territories, for a total gross of $40.1 million.

It is named after an aristocratic family that used to be the most important in the region, the House of Leiningen.  Geography  A loess wall, a natural monument and biotope The Leiningerland lies in northeast Palatinate, mostly in the county of Bad Dürkheim. Its area coincides with large parts of the collective municipalities of Hettenleidelheim and Grünstadt-Land as well as the town of Grünstadt. Also a part of the historic Leiningerland is the region around the town of Eisenberg, which is in the county of Donnersbergkreis today. Its total area is just under 200 km². The region does not have a uniform topography, but shares in three geological features: the Central Uplands, the Rhine Rift Valley and the Rhine Plain. the Leiningerland extends from the northeastern foothills of the Palatine Forest in the west across the northern part of the German Wine Road near Grünstadt to Dirmstein in the east, where the vineyards spread out into the Upper Rhine Plain. The village of Dirmstein itself, which is today included in the Leinigerland, was never owned by the House of Leiningen, however. Depending on altitude - about 400 metres in the west to about 100 metres to the east - the climate of the different areas also varies. The soils in the area of the fault scarp benefit from fertile loess deposits whilst, in places, there are steep rock faces on the scarp slopes which are a result of erosion and which are now classified as natural monuments and biotopes. The Leinigerland is drained by two, orographically left-hand tributaries of the Rhine: the Eckbach and den Eisbach.  History  Leiningen coat of arms according to the GHdA Hour column from the time of Bavarian rule In the Middle Ages, the Eckbach stream was called the Leinbach, which referred to the so-called Leinbaum or Norway maple. At that time, both the maple and the large-leaved lime occurred locally, especially on the banks of the Eckbach. The old name of the stream may have been the origin of the name given to the castle seat of the House of Leiningen, probably Frankish nobles who came from the area of the upper Eckbach and whose coat of arms bore a lime tree. The castle was called the Leiningen, but is known today as Altleiningen Castle. Records of its occupation go back at least to the early 12th century - to Count Emich II (died before 1138). Not certain, but probable, is that his predecessor, Emich I, was also his father. Many communities, both locally and further afield, bearn the silver eagle of the Leiningens in their municipal coat of arms. The most important lords in the area until the Early Modern Era, apart from the Leiningens, were the electors of the Palatinate and the prince-bishops of Worms. French troops caused great destruction under General Mélac during the War of the Palatine Succession (1689–1697). The Leiningerland was also heavily influenced by Bavarian rule of the Palatinate, which lasted from 1816 to the end of the Second World War.  Sights  Altleiningen Castle \\"above\\" the eponymous village recalls the Leiningen lords, as does Neuleiningen Castle, 5 kilometres to the northeast in the centre of the village of the same name. Both castles have been partially restored. Today, Altleiningen Castle is home to a youth hostel, an open-air swimming pool in the old castle moat and the \\"professional amateur theatre\\" of the Altleiningen Castle Players (Burgspiele Altleiningen). The remains of other Leiningen castles are in Battenberg, where there was once a castle of the same name, and in Bockenheim where Emichsburg Castle stands.

Near Neuleiningen Castle lies the Alte Pfarrey (\\"Old Vicarage\\"), in which one of the leading restaurants in the Palatinate is housed.

It was built from 1742 to 1746 by Franz Rothermel to modified plans from the famous church architect, Balthasar Neumann, as a simultaneum. Nearby, in the historic centre, are three restored palace-like manor houses: the Sturmfedersches Schloss, the Koeth-Wanscheidsches Schloss and the Quadtsches Schloss, as well as two English gardens in the schloss park and the cellar garden. The town of Grünstadt and the municipalities of Großkarlbach and Neuleiningen have picturesque centres with numerous timber-framed buildings.

In 2007 in the Großkarlbach village mill the Leiningerland Mill Museum (Mühlenmuseum Leiningerland) was opened. From a hydro-engineering perspective the 20-Pipe Well of Altleiningen is important; it is fed from a mine gallery which was driven deep into the rock around 1600 in order to supply the castle. Today, the well delivers most of the water for the Eckbach.

Its main attractions are the 6 hectare reservoir of the Eiswoog, the bridges of the regional Eis Valley Railway, the local Stumpfwald Railway, which is a narrow gauge, heritage line that carries tourists through the forest, and, near Eisenberg, archaeological site of a Roman vicus and the protected landscape of Erdekaut. There are several old churches dating to Romanesque and Gothic periods, especially on the middle course of the Eisbach.

Events  The Leiningerland is heavily dependent on viticulture; its vineyards being part of the Palatinate wine region. During the warmer months, a festival takes place almost every weekend somewhere - be it a fair, kermesse or wine festival. The best known nationally is probably the Kändelgassenfest in Großkarlbach. Every year, the Wine Countess of the Leiningerland is selected, who then represents the region at events and festivals in the next twelve months. One of the wine countesses, Sylvia Benzinger, later also became the Palatine Wine Queen and German Wine Queen. Every year in early October - usually on German Unity Day - the \\"Car-Free Eis Valley Day of Action\\" attracts many visitors to the region. The L 395 road, which runs from Asselheim through the Eise valley to Enkenbach, is closed to motor vehicles for the whole of one Sunday and the valley is open exclusively to pedestrians, usually hikers, and to cyclists. Every October since 1953 there has been a Palatine language poetry competition at Bockenheim. The Kirchheim Winter Concert was established in 1990 and takes place in St Andrew's Church in Kirchheim. Its founder and artistic director is the bass- baritone and International Bach Prizewinner, Dominik Wörner. The focus of the concert series is on early music.

The hall was built in 1573 but has been extended since. It is constructed to an E-shaped plan in dressed stone with ashlar dressings in three storeys, with a frontage of five gabled bays. The 2nd and 4th bays project but the 1st and 5th bays project even further and are wider. Despite interior damage caused by fire, the hall remains one of the most complete examples of 16th century architecture in the historic county of Lancashire. The surrounding park, at one time much larger than the 60 acre estate which exists today, had extensive woodlands which contain an 1815 monument to the Duke of Wellington and a smaller monument to either a horse or dog called Dash. Bispham Hall was named after the Bispham family who acquired the estate by marriage in 1346 and held it until 1730. It then passed to the Leigh family of Whitley Hall, Wigan. In 1825 the property had descended to John Holt, who had inherited it in 1816 from his unmarried brother Robert. In 1841 John Holt left the property to William Mills, a distant relative of Cheshire, on condition that the latter adopted the surname of Holt. On William's death the estate passed to his son William Thomas, who died in 1857, leaving it to be divided between his six sisters, whereby it was sold in 1871 to coal-producer Meyrick Holmes Bankes of Winstanley Hall. The Bispham estate was acquired by the Boy Scout Association in 1948 as an activity centre. The hall itself was gutted by a fire in 1977 or 1978, but has been since restored by the Vivat Trust and is now privately owned. The Scout activity centre provides, in addition to indoor accommodation facilities, field camping areas for large groups and smaller woodland clearings for smaller groups. Varied outdoor facilities are organised, including climbing, orienteering, canoeing and team sports. Local legend tells how the ghost of Nellie Bispham haunts the woods around Bispham Hall.

Kock (January 29, 1924 – August 24, 2011) was a Professor of Surgery who taught and practiced at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. Kock was noted for his research, experimentation, and colorectal surgical techniques. These led to his breakthrough development of the Kock pouch, used for people who require excretory stomas. Personal life and education Kock was born in Jakobstad, Finland in 1924. Following military service in the Finnish Army during World War II, he attended the University of Helsinki Medical School, and graduated in 1951.Nils G.

He immediately began his surgical residency there.Colon and Rectal Surgery; Corman, Marvin L.; 2005; Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; Pp. 1424. Later, Kock spent five years in surgical training at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, an institution he remained affiliated with for the rest of his professional career. While there, in 1959, Kock obtained his PhD and subsequently assumed the position of Assistant Professor of Surgery.A Tribute to Nils G.

In 1974, Kock became a full professor at Gothenburg.Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England; PDF format; Harding Rains, A.J.; 1979; [accessed online]; Dorriston Ltd.; London; accessed March 2014. Career In the course of his medical career, Kock published over 300 papers. In the 1960s, Kock experimented on cats and dogs in an effort to develop an internal \\"continent bladder\\" which used a reservoir created from the small intestine of candidates receiving ileostomy surgery. In 1969, he published his manuscript detailing a technique he had established of creating an intra-abdominal reservoir, offering an alternative to conventional ileostomy which required the use of external appliances to collect waste. Ileostomy is the procedure whereby individuals suffering from a number of intestinal malfunctions (such as those arising from ulcerative colitis, familial polyposis, late-stage Crohn's disease, and others), are equipped with stomas for excretory purposes.Ileostomy: A Guide; Index and pages; American Cancer Society on line; (PDF available for download); retrieved March 2014. His work culminated with the initial development of the continent ileostomy procedure, which became known as the Kock pouch. The first Kock pouch continent ileostomy procedure was executed in 1969.Kock Pouch Procedure Revisited at the Quality of Life Association Symposium; September 23, 2009; PR Web; Los Angeles, CA; Quote: \\"This year, 2009, is an anniversary celebration – the 40th anniversary of Dr. Nils Kock performing the first Kock pouch continent ileostomy in 1969...\\"; retrieved March 2014.Fecal & Urinary Diversions: Management Principles; Colwell, Janice; 2004; Elsevier Health Sciences; pp. 9–10.

The technique, however, was not without some drawbacks. Pouchitis, a term coined by Kock to describe the reservoir ileitis seen in recipients of any pouch procedure, is a common one. Also, the first Kock pouches were not created with any type of valve mechanism. The procedure required additional development, work which Kock continued to advance through further experimentation into the 1970s and 1980s. Early experience showed that 50% of those receiving the procedure would not stay continent afterward. Kock developed what he termed a \\"nipple valve\\" in 1972 to help eliminate a portion of these problems. The nipple valve was created from intestinal tissue itself.The Kock Pouch Complication: The Slipped Valve; Kock Pouch website; retrieved March 2014. An ongoing problem with the Kock procedure had been its inability to maintain the drainage valve (or stoma) in the proper position, even with the inclusion of the nipple. The failure rateNote: Failure is defined as a loss of continence due to stomatic-nipple slippage, making the successful (non-leaking) insertion of the drainage catheter impossible or difficult. was 25-40%. Much of Kock's work in the 1970s concentrated on ways to stabilize the valve. The problem was eventually solved by Dr. William O. Barnett's development of the Barnett continent intestinal reservoir (or J-pouch) modification of Kock's procedure. Later career, and death Kock's work after 1985 was mainly on the development of continent urostomies, which gave rise to the development of the \\"Urethral-Kock pouch after Cystoprostatectomy\\" technique.Ghoneim MA, Adhmallah AK, Awaad HK, et al.; \\"Cystectomy & Diversion for Carcinoma of the Bilharzial Bladder;\\" 1988; Progressive Clinic Biological Research; 260:315–9; [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]. Later in his career, Kock became a visiting lecturer worldwide in order to educate and advance the use of his urostomy surgical technique into Third World nations where bilharzial disease was prevalent. He collaborated for years with Egyptian Professor of Urology, Mohamed Ghoneim,Note: Professor M. Ghoneim is the namesake of the Mohamed Ghoneim Urology and Nephrology Center of Mansoura University.Mohamed Ahmed Ghoneim; Medical Fact page; Mansoura University website; accessed March 2014. from the medical department of the University of Mansoura (which at the time was a branch of Cairo University). He focused on perfecting his procedure and educating others in the use of his life-improving surgical techniques. Kock retired from the University hospital in 1990. Still traveling to lecture, he was the recipient of the Société Internationale d’Urologie—Alstellas European Foundation Award in 1997.\\"European Urology Today;\\" Vol. 23, No. 5; October/November 2011; p.5; col 3-4; retrieved March 2014.

This dish is a common soup made in the winter but is especially important for Tibetan New Year. On Nyi-Shu-Gu, the eve of Losar (Tibetan New Year), the common Tibetan soup, Thukpa bhatuk is made with special ingredients to form Guthuk. Guthuk is then eaten on Losar to symbolise getting rid of negativities of the past year and invite positives into the new year. Soup In the Thukpa bhatuk soup, the main components are the handmade bhatsa noodles, which are similar to the Italian gnocchi. Some bhatsa noodles used for this soup are called gutsi rithuk and another noodle, called bhatuk. Both of these noodles are referred to as bhatuk in Central Tibet. Meat is usually a main ingredient in this soup, commonly mutton, beef or yak however, this soup can also be made vegetarian with a vegetable bouillon. Customs =Guthuk= At the time of Tibetan New Year the common soup, Thukpa bhatuk, is transformed into Guthuk. Guthuk is only eaten at this time of the year on the eve of Losar(Tibetan New Year). This dish is part of the ritual to dispel any negativities of the old year, to make way for a better positive new year. There are three main differences that make thukpa bhatuk into guthuk: ::# Thukpa bhatuk is a common soup while guthuk is only eaten on Nyi-Shu-Gu (Tibetan New Year's Eve) ::# Guthuk specifically has nine main ingredients. For example, a traditional guthuk would include meat (mutton, beef, or yak) and dried cheese. A Vegetarian guthuk, would include mushrooms, celery, labu (radish), peas, tomato, onion, ginger, garlic, and spinach. ::# To satisfy rituals, with the guthuk, each person gets a large dough ball with a symbol inside revealing a trait of the person who gets it. :Traditional guthuk ::Thukpa barthuk noodle soup with yak and dried cheese and oracle dough-ball of your choice :Vegetarian guthuk ::Thukpa bhatuk noodle soup with mushrooms, labu (radish) and peas and oracle dough-ball =Losar:Tibetan New Year= Losar literally meaning lo (year) and sar (new) is the Tibetan New Year and is celebrated both in Tibet and Nepal. Losar begins on the first day of the first month of the Tibetan calendar and Nepali calendar and is celebrated on a different day each year. On the eve of Losar, which is called Nyi-Shu-Gu, the old year is expelled along with all its negativities. It is custom for homes and bodies to be purified and cleaned to invite positives for the New Year. The New Year is then brought in with specific ceremonial rituals including the specially made Thukpa batuk called Guthuk. This soup is made on Nyi-Shu-Gu and is specific to the celebration of Losar. =Nyi-Shu-Gu= As explained, Nyi- Shu-Gu is the Tibetan New Year's Eve, which is the 29th day of the last month of the year, according to the Tibetan calendar and Nepali calendar. Nyi-Shu-Gu is a day to dismiss negativities from homes and bodies and to make the Guthuk soup. A traditional custom in Central Tibet is to heat water over a fire for everyone to bathe and wash their hair. Normally, people don’t bathe everyday, but everyone takes care to be thoroughly clean in preparation for Losar. Once everything is purified, the Guthuk soup is eaten and the negativities are expelled.

Life Walter, the son of a doctor, was born in Odessa, Ukraine. He studied plant biology at the University of Odessa from 1915 to 1917. In 1918 he moved to the University of Dorpat, where he studied under Peter Claussen. In 1919 he studied at the University of Jena with Christian Ernst Stahl and Wilhelm Detmer, where he completed his Ph.D. In 1920, he worked at the Agricultural Research Institute in Halle, and then as a research assistant of Ludwig Jost at the University of Heidelberg. In 1923, Walter worked as a lecturer at the university and he became an Associate Professor of Botany in 1927. In 1924, he married the daughter of the botanist Heinrich Schenck, Erna Walter, who also earned her doctorate in botany from the University of Heidelberg (in 1918) and was a research assistant of Ludwig Jost. In the following years, Walter received a Rockefeller Fellowship (1929-1930) for the exploration of desert plants in with American botanist Forrest Shreve in Tucson, Arizona as well as with John Ernest Weaver, a plant ecologist in Lincoln, Nebraska. In 1939, Walter became Director of the Botanical Institute of the Institute of Technology (now University) in Stuttgart. From 1933 to 1934, and again from 1937 to 1938, Walter made research trips to East and West Africa. In 1941, he became a tenured professor at the State University of Poznan, and in 1945 he worked at the Department of Botany at the Agricultural University of Stuttgart-Hohenheim, where Walter eventually retired and became an emeritus professor in 1966. From 1951 to 1955 he was a visiting professor of botany at the University of Ankara in Turkey. He died in Stuttgart in 1989. Law of relative constancy of habitat In 1953, Walter and Erna formulated the Law of relative constancy of habitat, which states that: If the climate within the residential district or area of a plant species is changing in a particular direction, this species moves into a habitat or biotope that compensates for the climate change.Deutsche Gesellschaft für Geschichte und Theorie der Biologie: Annals of the History and Philosophy of Biology. Volume 12. 2007, S. 164. (online; PDF; 4,3 MB) Research achievements Walter went on numerous research trips, on which he was most often accompanied by his wife, to almost all vegetation zones on the earth. He recorded his experiences and summarized his findings in many books. The sometimes very extensive works are often published in several editions, have been translated in part, and belong almost exclusively to the standard works of Geobotany and Ecology (review in his memoirs). Walter acquired extraordinary merits through the collaboration with Helmut Lieth in the published work \\"Climate Chart World Atlas\\" (1960-1967). This work was a clear form of climate representation and received the highest international recognition. The memoirs of Walter (Confessions of an Environmentalist, 1980) is an impressive document of the times and at the same time an informative source for the history of science. In the final chapter of this book, he also deals with the relationship of science and art and provides an opinion on the basic questions of scientific work. Staff and students During his time as a professor, Walter had numerous employees and students who themselves became professors later. Among others, some noteworthy scientists were: Hans Haas, Maximilian Steiner, Erich Oberdorfer, Karl Hans Divine, Heinz Ellenberg, Karlheinz Kreeb, Helmut Lieth, Wolfgang Haber, Helmut Freitag and Sigmar Breckle.H.

Hanson was born on January 16, 1876 in Barnesville, Georgia to Henry Clay Hanson and Anna O. (Bloodworth) Hanson. His father was a newspaperman who for years he owned and edited The Macon Telegraph and The Columbus Enquirer-Sun. Hanson attended public schools in Macon and Columbus, Georgia and for a short while attended the Gordon Institute in Barnesville, Georgia. When he was in primary school, Hanson founded a Saturday paper called The City Item. It was first a single-page paper, and he produced the entire paper, from typesetting to delivery. When Hanson moved from Macon to Columbus, he enlarged the paper to many times its original size, changed its name to The Columbus Times, and built up a circulation of 2,500 subscribers. Hanson employed a printer in his father's office to set the type, but solicited the advertisements, wrote the news stories, and made deliveries on horseback. When he was 15 years old, he sold his paper and its equipment for more than . In 1892, at the age of 16, he became advertising solicitor for Nichols & Holliday, the advertising managers for the Atlanta Constitution; he continued to work there until 1895 when he went to work for the Baltimore World as a solicitor in the classified advertising department. In June 1896 he went to work for The Montgomery Advertiser as a solicitor in the circulation department. Within three months, he was transferred to the advertising department as a solicitor, and in less than six months was in charge of the department, and by the end of the year was advertising manager in of both local and foreign advertising. Hanson was employed continuously The Montgomery Advertiser until February 15, 1909, when he moved to Birmingham, the advertising receipts of that paper having increased through his efforts 500 percent. Upon going to Birmingham he purchased a third interest in The Birmingham News from the owner and editor, Rufus N. Rhodes, becoming with his newly acquired interests, vice-president and general manager of the paper. On March 1, 1910, shortly after Rhodes' death, Hanson purchased from his widow a majority of the interest in the paper and became its president and publisher. On September 12, 1912, a Sunday edition was launched. Soon after his move to Birmingham, Hanson was joined by his former employer, Frank P. Glass, who purchased stock in The News and became its editor, retaining for a while his interest in The Montgomery Advertiser. This partnership was severed in 1920, when Hanson purchased Glass's interest in The News. Shortly thereafter negotiations were undertaken for the purchase of The Birmingham Ledger, which, on April 19, was formally absorbed by The News. On January 4, 1920, Hanson announced that The Birmingham News would give a $500 loving cup each year, beginning with 1920, to that citizen of Birmingham who had during the year best served his city. In February 1921, the coal operators and striking miners composed their differences, Hanson securing from each an agreement to abide by a decision to be made by Governor Kilby. Hanson was a Democrat but never sought office. He was a member and deacon in the Independent Presbyterian church of Birmingham, a Mason, and a Shriner. Hanson married Weenona W. Hanson on 1897 in Uniontown. They resided in Birmingham. Hanson died on March 7, 1945 in Birmingham, Alabama.

It had two wings; the Farmers wing led by M Gailītis and the Landowners wing led by Ādolfs Bļodnieks. History The party was established in 1925 as a breakaway from the Latvian Farmers' Union, and had its roots in the Agrarian Union of the Landless (BAS). The BAS had been absorbed into the Farmers' Union following the 1920 Constitutional Assembly elections, but had remained a separate faction within it.Vincent E McHale (1983) Political parties of Europe, Greenwood Press, p456 In the 1925 elections the new party won three seats. In 1928 it was joined by the more radical members of the BAS, who had remained in the Farmers' Union. The elections that year saw the party win four seats in the 3rd Saeima. However, the radical members split from the party in 1931 to establish the New Farmers' Association. In the elections later that year the New Farmers-Small Landowners Party managed to win seven seats in the 4th Saeima, whilst the New Farmers' Association won two. Ideology The party was established to represent farmers and smallholders who had gained land under the 1920 land reform programme that had seen 1,300 landowners dispossessed and 3.7 million hectares of land redistributed. It supported the concept of a Baltic Entente, but took an anti-Polish stance in foreign policy.

He made his MLB debut for the New York Yankees on April 2, 2014, and has also played for the San Diego Padres, Toronto Blue Jays, and San Francisco Giants, and the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). Professional career Solarte with the Fort Myers Miracle in =Minnesota Twins= Solarte signed with the Minnesota Twins in 2005, a few weeks before his 18th birthday. Working his way through the lower levels of the Twins organization, he reached Double-A in 2009, but underwent surgery on his right shoulder and only played 16 games that season. In 2010, he split time between the High-A Florida State League and the Double-A Eastern League. Playing the full season with New Britain of the Eastern League in 2011, he recorded a batting line of .329/.367/.466 in 121 games, most of them at second base. =Texas Rangers= In December 2011, Solarte signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers, which included an invitation to spring training. Solarte played both the 2012 and 2013 seasons with the Rangers' Triple-A affiliate, the Round Rock Express, where he made starts at second, third, shortstop, left field, and first base. Between the two seasons, he had a .282/.331/.404 batting line and 23 home runs in 263 games. =New York Yankees= Following the 2013 season, Solarte became a free agent, and his agent, Chris Leible, helped convince him that his best opportunity to play regularly in the majors would be as a utility infielder. Three scouts had endorsed him, including Jay Darnell, David Keith and Don Wakamatsu. Solarte signed a minor league deal with the New York Yankees in January 2014, who had passed on resigning free agent second baseman Robinson Canó. In spring training in 2014, Solarte competed with Eduardo Núñez, Zelous Wheeler, Dean Anna, and Scott Sizemore for a reserve infielder role with the Yankees, making the team out of spring training. New York Yankees in 2014 Solarte's time with the Yankees started with collecting nine hits in his first 20 at bats, including four doubles and six RBI. On April 8, 2014, Solarte hit two doubles, and became the first player in the Modern Era (since 1900) to hit six doubles in his first seven games in the Major Leagues. On April 17, 2014 Solarte started a 5-4-3 triple play against the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field. He hit his first big league home run later that same game off of Rays pitcher Grant Balfour. He then hit his second home run, a three-run shot, against the Milwaukee Brewers, which eventually drove them to win the game. Early the next month, Solarte at one point held the highest batting average in the American League. On July 3, 2014 Solarte was optioned back down to AAA while INF Zelous Wheeler was called up to the main roster. On July 10, 2014 Solarte was called back up to the Yankees in place of the injured Carlos Beltrán. Over 75 games with the Yankees in 2014, Solarte batted .254/.337/.381 with 6 home runs, making multiple starts at third and second base and one at shortstop. =San Diego Padres= On July 22, 2014, the Yankees traded Solarte and Rafael De Paula to the San Diego Padres in exchange for Chase Headley. One day later, Solarte made his Padres debut on the road against the Chicago Cubs. Solarte spent most of his time at third base in place of the departed Headley, but also made starts at second, shortstop, and in left field. With the Padres in 2014, he batted .267/.336/.355 with 4 home runs in 56 games. In 2015, Solarte and Will Middlebrooks competed for the third base job in spring training. Solarte ended up taking on a super-utility role to begin the season, making 60 starts in the first half around the infield, including a run of 17 starts at first base while Yonder Alonso was on the disabled list with a shoulder injury. In the second half, Solarte became the everyday third basemen as Middlebrooks was demoted to Triple-A in July. On the season, Solarte batted .270/.320/.428 with 14 home runs in 152 games, including 85 starts at third base. Solarte came into the 2016 season as the Padres starting third baseman. Solarte suffered a strained hamstring early on and missed 38 games in April and May. During the season, Solarte's wife developed complications from cancer, and he left the team for four days in July to attend to her. He again left the team in September when her condition worsened, and she passed on September 17. On December 15, 2016, it was announced that Solarte was the recipient of the Tony Conigliaro Award for his on-field achievements while overcoming personal tragedy. Solarte batted .286/.341/.467 on the season, with 15 home runs in 109 games. In January 2017, the Padres signed Solarte to a two-year contract with a club option for two additional years. Coming into the season, manager Andy Green decided to have Solarte spend more time at second base and give playing time at third to Ryan Schimpf or Cory Spangenberg. Solarte was the regular second-baseman until June 20, when the Padres placed him on the 10-day disabled list with an oblique injury. Solarte didn't return until July 30, and the Padres prepared him for a role at shortstop, as Carlos Asuaje had played well at second base in his absence and Spangenberg had taken over third. Solarte moved around the infield after his return, including 24 starts at shortstop. For the season, he batted .255/.314/.416 with 18 home runs in 128 games. He made 74 starts at second base, 24 at short, 18 at third, and 4 at first. =Toronto Blue Jays= On January 6, 2018, the Padres traded Solarte to the Toronto Blue Jays for minor leaguers Edward Olivares and Jared Carkuff. Due to injuries to Josh Donaldson, Solarte became the Blue Jays' everyday third baseman for most of April 2018. On May 3, 2018, during the first game of a doubleheader against the Cleveland Indians, Solarte hit his first career grand slam, in the eleventh inning, as part of a 5-for-6, 6 RBI game, helping his Blue Jays to a 13–11 win. Later that day, he went 3-for-4 in the second game of the doubleheader, ending the day having gone 8-for-10 throughout the two games and setting a Blue Jays record for most hits in a doubleheader, with 8. Solarte quickly became a fan favorite in Toronto, but a tendency to not run out ground balls hurt his popularity as the season progressed. In the first half of the season, Solarte hit 16 home runs with 48 RBI's. In the second half, Solarte struggled through inconsistency and injury, hitting under .180 with only 1 home run in 30 games. On November 30, Solarte was non-tendered by the Blue Jays and became a free agent. =San Francisco Giants= On February 15, 2019, Solarte signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants that included an invitation to spring training. He was designated for assignment on May 7, 2019 after a poor performance through 28 games. He elected free agency on May 10, 2019. =Miami Marlins= On June 7, 2019, Solarte signed a minor league deal with the Miami Marlins. He was released on July 6, 2019. =Hanshin Tigers= On July 7, 2019, Solarte signed with the Hanshin Tigers of the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). On July 26, 2019, Solarte made his NPB debut against Yomiuri Giants, and hit his first NPB home run.

They are sometimes referred to as Jan van Beers the elder and Jan van Beers the younger. In 1884, Jan Van Beers produced the pen-and-ink sketches for the edition de luxe of his father's poetry. Early life Van Beers studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp. Soon afterwards, he became the leader of a group of young artists, the \\"Van Beers clique.\\" This group included the artists Piet Verhaert (1852–1908), Alexander Struys (1852–1941), and Jef Lambeaux (1852–1908). They were well known for their mischievous and eccentric behaviour, including walking around Antwerp dressed in historic costumes. Van Beers began his career as a history painter, producing works relating to the Renaissance. These included Funeral of Charles the Good, which was so large and contained so many figures that van Beers said he only recouped the costs of production, despite selling it for 12,000 Francs. Ladies of Paris In 1880 he moved to Paris and immediately abandoned historical pictures, producing instead genre and portrait works of the middle classes and developing a successful line in attractive draped young ladies reading a letter or a book or day-dreaming about a lover. Van Beers said that he wanted to paint what he saw and what were the best and most interesting things that one saw in Paris but her women? He explained in an 1893 interview for the Westminster Budget that \\"all my pictures are from models, and I know where to find them whenever I want them. It requires a good deal of diplomacy to get them to pose. One has to pet and coax them, and even then they often leave you in the lurch.\\"Westminster Budget 31 March 1893, p. 22. Retrieved 8 March 2014. Vanity Fair showed him with a typical subject in their 1891 caricature titled \\"The Modern Wiertz\\" (Antoine Wiertz, 1806–65). Van Beers' work was often compared to that of his Belgian predecessor, particularly the more macabre and grotesque elements. In his novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy mentions \\"the staring and ghastly attitudes of a Wiertz Museum and with the leer of a study by Van Beers\\".

In 1879, Huysmans described Van Beers' submission to that year's Salon as \\"demented colours, absurd and crazy notions, a hotch-potch of ancient and modern mixed up on a single canvas\\".Quoted in \\"Beers, Jan Marie Constantin van\\", Benezit Dictionary of Artists. Oxford Art Online, Oxford University Press, 8 March 2014. In 1881, van Beers exhibited two works at the Brussels Salon, both painted in his new hyperrealistic miniature style. One, a painting of the yacht \\"Sirene\\", was suspected by the critics Max Sülzberger, Georges De Mons and Lucien Solvay of being a \\"photo-peinture\\", a painting created over a photograph. The Review de l’Art Moderne defended van Beers, suggesting that the critics and other artists were jealous of his commercial success. Van Beers suggested that experts could scrape off the paint to determine the truth of the allegations. A semi-official investigation followed, and eventually van Beers started legal proceedings. \\"L'affaire Van Beers\\" gave him Europe-wide attention. The eventual report found in his favour and that he was \\"an honest man\\". Previously a largely unknown artist, van Beers was able to use his new found fame to sell his work for large sums.

He has been a member, on keyboards, synthesisers or electronics, for various groups, including Whirlywirld, Models and Absent Friends. Duffield has also been a backing musician for other artists both on tours and for studio sessions. Biography Andrew Peter Duffield, studied electronic music with Felix Werder, classical music composer and critic, in Melbourne. In June 1978 Duffield played synthesiser for The Boys Next Door's debut album, Door, Door (1979). In August 1978 Duffield on electronics, was a founding member of Whirlywirld with John Murphy on drums and electronics (ex- News); Ian \\"Ollie\\" Olsen on lead vocals, electronics, and saxophone (The Reals, The Young Charlatans); Dean Richards on guitar; and Simon Smith on electronics. This line-up issued a three-track self-titled extended play in April the following year. However, in January, Duffield had been replaced in Whirlywirld by Philip Jackson. Early in 1979 Duffield joined Bohdan and The Instigators alongside Bohdan X (aka Bohdan Kubiakowski) on lead vocals and guitar; together with ex-The Chosen Few bandmates: Iain Weaver on lead vocals; Bruce Friday on lead guitar; Cal McAlpine on drums; and Ian Cunningham on bass guitar. Also that year Duffield scored music and provided arrangements for Film Work, a movie which compiled excerpts from four documentaries originally made by Waterside Workers Federation Film Unit between 1953 and 1958; and interviews with its members. By August Duffield had joined Models and Bohdan and The Instigators soon disbanded. Models had formed in 1978, by the time Duffield joined on keyboards, the other members were Mark Ferrie on bass guitar; Janis Friedenfelds (aka Johnny Crash) on drums and percussion; and Sean Kelly on lead vocals and lead guitar. In October 1979 Models first release was a give-away, shared single, \\"Early Morning Brain (It's Not Quite the Same as Sobriety)\\" backed with The Boys Next Door's \\"Scatterbrain\\". In July 1980 Models line-up of Duffield with Crash, Ferrie, and Kelly, supported a gig by Ramones in Canberra. Besides keyboards, including EMS Synthi AKS, Duffield also provided songwriting for six tracks on Models' debut album, Alphabravocharliedeltaechofoxtrotgolf (November 1980). The Canberra Times Jonathan Green praised Duffields' \\"swelling, ricocheting keyboards\\". The group's second album, Local and/or General, appeared in October 1981 with Duffield co-writing five tracks. In May the following year Duffield quit Models but by December he had rejoined. During his absence from the group he scored the soundtrack for the 1982 Ian Pringle feature film, The Plains of Heaven (aka Panic Station). He appeared on Models' next album, The Pleasure of Your Company (October 1983), co-writing all ten tracks. By late 1984, Models relocated to Sydney. They performed at a 1985 New Year's Day early morning gig with a line-up of Duffield, Kelly, James Freud (ex-Teenage Radio Stars, James Freud & Berlin) on bass guitar and vocals; Barton Price (ex-Crocodiles, Sardine v) on drums; and James Valentine on saxophone. Rachael Warren of The Canberra Times caught the show and felt \\"[a]nother interesting song of the night was Andrew Duffield's 'Beyond Rap'. He said how unhappy he is, that happiness is a bore, and you can forget all the 'Real Lifes' and 'Pseudo Echos'\\". However, despite Duffield's crucial influence on the band's sound, he was forced out of Models by their recently appointed manager, Chris Murphy (INXS), under acrimonious circumstances: Murphy wanted the group to have a more commercial pop sound but Duffield felt this would be a \\"sell-out\\". He was replaced by Roger Mason (ex-James Freud & Berlin) on keyboards. Duffield had already co-written \\"Barbados\\" with Freud, which was issued in March 1985 as Models' second single from their next album, Out of Mind, Out of Sight, which appeared in August. During 1985 Duffield and Phil Kenihan produced a three- track extended play, Over the Ropes – A Tribute to Jack Little by The Forearm Jolt, which used a compilation of commentaries by GTV 9 presenters, Jack Little and Paul Jennings, from their program, World Championship Wrestling. Little's catchphrases included \\"Wham! Bam! Thank you Mam!\\", \\"All I can say is – Wow!\\", \\"Be There!\\" and \\"That's all there is, there isn't any more!\\" The EP was released as a tribute to the ailing Little, who died in early January the following year. The Forearm Jolt were a studio ensemble with Duffield on keyboards; Ferrie on bass guitar; Valentine on saxophone; twins sisters Sherine and Zan Abeyratne on vocals; Rozzi Bazzani on vocals; John Fielding on trumpet; Noel Crombie on thumps and bumps; and Andrew Pendlebury on lead guitar. Lyrics were co-written by Duffield, Kenihan and James Cockington. In 1988 Duffield released his debut solo album, Ten Happy Fingers on his own Retrograde Records label. It was produced by Duffield and Kenihan, all nine tracks were written by Duffield. In the studio Duffield used a variety of musicians including Ferrie on gated bass guitar; Pendlebury on guitar and loops; Maurice Frawley on guitar; Gordon Pitts on Fairlight brass sound; Ron Strykert on guitar; and Wilbur Wilde on saxophone. Duffield wrote the theme song for TV series, Round the Twist. Lead vocals for \\"Round the Twist\\" were sung by Tamsin West, who portrayed lead character, Linda Twist, in series 1 (1989). He also composed the music for series 1 and 2 (1992). In May 1989 Duffield, on keyboards, joined Absent Friends, with former Models bandmates: Kelly on vocals and guitar; and Valentine on saxophone; they were joined by Wendy Matthews on lead vocals (latter day member of Models and Kelly's then- domestic partner); Nicole Ainslie on keyboards and backing vocals; Garry Gary Beers on bass guitar (on loan from INXS); Michael King (ex-Jimmy Barnes Band) on guitar; and John MacKay (Machinations) on drums. By mid-December Absent Friends issued their debut single, \\"Hallelujah\\", which Canberra Times Penelope Layland dismissed as \\"could quite easily have remained a figment of someone's imagination. It sounds as though they all had fun making it, but that's about it. The flip is a different mix of the same song\\". Absent Friends' debut album, Here's Looking Up Your Address, followed in April the next year and peaked at No. 7 on the ARIA Albums Chart. By late 1990 the group toured Europe supporting INXS but Duffield had been replaced by Geoffrey Stapleton (GANGgajang on hiatus) on keyboards. Duffield and Kenihan continued their work as a production duo and expanded into TV advertising. Duffield participated in subsequent reformations of Models including in August 2010 for two concerts in Sydney and Melbourne. On 27 October that year, Models were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame by Matthews. The line-up of Duffield, Ferrie, Kelly, Mason, Price and Valentine performed \\"I Hear Motion\\" and \\"Evolution\\".

Goethe Oak (or Goethes Oak), is a name given to a number of oak trees in Germany that are referred to in this way because they allegedly bear some sort of connection to the poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. History Perhaps the most famous one is the oak tree near Weimar, Germany, on the Ettersberg, at the foot of which was the castle of Charlotte von Stein. The oak, in the middle of a beech forest, is named thus because it is supposedly the tree under which Goethe wrote \\"Wanderer's Nightsong\\", or, alternatively, the location where he composed the Walpurgisnacht passages of his Faust. The fate of the oak became in due course associated with the fate of Germany: if the one were to fall, so would the other. According to the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation, the name 'Goethe Oak' was simply an epithet made up by the inmates of Buchenwald camp in commemoration of the walks Goethe was known to have made in the area. The large, old tree had previously been labeled the Dicke Eiche (English:\\"thick oak\\") on maps of the area.Goethe Oak. Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation. Retrieved 6 August 2017. The end of the Buchenwald oak  The remains of the Goethe Oak in the former Buchenwald concentration camp The beech forest was cleared in 1937 to make way for the Buchenwald concentration camp. Originally the camp was to be called KL Ettersberg (\\"KL\\" for Konzentrationslager), but this was abandoned because the Ettersberg name was so closely connected to the life of Goethe. The tree stood in the center of the camp, and is reputed to have served also for the hanging and torture of prisoners. The tree was hit by an Allied incendiary bomb on 24 August 1944 and burned all night long. It is preserved (being cast in concrete under the auspices of the DDR government, which also laid a plaque saying \\"Goethe Eiche\\") and is part of the Buchenwald memorial. For the SS guards and the prisoners, the tree held two completely different meanings: for the SS it was a link to the Germany they thought they represented, but for the prisoners the tree pointed to a different Germany from the one they experienced in the camp. According to Amos Oz, the incorporation of the oak in the camp and its subsequent destruction are evidence that the Nazis destroyed their own heritage,. In Der Totenwald, camp survivor Ernst Wiechert recalls standing under the oak and reflecting on the two Germanies it represented -- what later scholars would call the \\"Januskopf Deutschlands\\", the Weimar-Buchenwald dichotomy. The tree gave its name to another book by a survivor, Pierre Julitte's L'Arbre de Goethe (1965). The oak was sketched by Léon Delarbre, who used to sit under its \\"charred limbs\\" and compose poetry.

In the wake of the breakup of the State of the Teutonic Order, the Baltic German local aristocracy in the areas of Harrien (Harjumaa) and Wierland (Virumaa), as well as the city of Reval (Tallinn) in June 1561 (and somewhat later Jerwen (Järvamaa)) asked for and were granted protection by the Swedish king Eric XIV, leading to Swedish involvement in the Livonian War. At the conclusion of hostilities in 1583, Sweden was in control of the northern parts of modern Estonia and Hiiumaa island; this territory was created the Duchy of Estonia. Following renewed wars between Poland and Sweden, the southern parts of present-day Estonia (then Livonia) were incorporated into Sweden by the Treaty of Altmark in 1629. In 1645, Denmark also ceded the island of Ösel (Saaremaa) to Sweden, and the latter was in control of all of present-day Estonia. The time of Swedish rule came to an effective end in 1710, when all the Swedish Baltic provinces capitulated to Russian troops during the end-stages of the Great Northern War. Russian hegemony was formalized in 1721. The reasons for Swedish involvement in Estonia were economic as well as political and military. The Swedish Crown was not least interested in getting a share of the profits from the rich trade with Russia. At the same time, assertions in Estonia can also been seen as a way of preventing Russia and Denmark from gaining potentially dangerous footholds close to Swedish-controlled Finland. The time of Swedish rule is sometimes colloquially referred to as the \\"good old Swedish times\\" ().Baltic Postcolonialism By Violeta Kelertas, p. 397 However, it remains unclear whether the contemporaneous Estonian-speaking population generally used this expression or whether they considered the time of Swedish rule significantly better than that of earlier foreign rulers. Especially during the later part of the Swedish rule of Estonia, Swedish authorities did however enact a number of reforms which were aimed at lessening the influence of the local German- speaking aristocracy, to the benefit of the local Estonian-speaking peasantry. In the light of this, there is some evidence to suggest that the Estonian- speaking population considered Swedish rule as characterised by the rule of law, and it has been recorded that in later, harsh times the lower classes have expressed a wish for a return to Swedish rule. Swedish reforms, some of lasting influence, also included the establishment of the University of Tartu (as well as other educational institutions, e.g. the Gustav Adolf Grammar School); staunchly promoting Lutheranism and providing translations of the Bible into Estonian; and creating a court of appeal in Tartu. Coat of arms of Swedish Estonia (1660) Earliest years The era of Swedish rule in Estonia started under the rule of King Eric XIV Koluvere Castle, the site of the Battle of Lode between Russian and Swedish troops during the Livonian War. The war ended with the confirmation of Swedish overlord-ship of northern Estonia. At least since the Viking Age there have been contacts between the inhabitants of present-day Sweden and Estonia. For example, a runestone in Roslags-Bro Church in Sweden commemorates a man who was killed in Estonia during the 11th century. There has been a Swedish minority in Estonia at least since the Middle Ages. During the Northern Crusades, Swedish crusaders made a failed attempt to conquer Estonia. Instead, mainly German crusading knights conquered the area and established the State of the Teutonic Order there and in most parts of the Baltic states. With the decline of the Teutonic Order and its state, Swedish political ambitions returned to Estonia. The future King John III had already as Grand Duke of Finland in the 1550s ambitions to establish Swedish rule in Estonia, but was held back by his father, Gustav Vasa. It was not until 1561 that the local nobility asked the new king, Eric XIV, to intervene in the ongoing Livonian War and protect the lands of Harjumaa, Virumaa and the city of Tallinn in exchange for overlord-ship. The Livonian War, in which Sweden now became involved, would last to 1583 (concluded by the Treaty of Plussa). For Sweden, it resulted in Sweden keeping the territory that had in 1561 sought Swedish protection, and additionally in the capture of the city of Narva. The name of Livonia, formerly denoting all of present-day Estonia and Latvia, was now applied to Polish-controlled south Estonia and Latvia; while \\"Estonia\\" began to denote the Swedish controlled areas of north and west Estonia. It was not until the early 20th century that the term \\"Estonia\\" began to be used to signify all the lands where Estonian-speaking people lived. Sweden started to reorganise the government in the new duchy only after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Russia in 1583. Like the Livonian estates, Estonian aristocracy and towns had surrendered on condition that their privileges be retained. Unlike in Livonia, where Poland soon violated the agreement, Swedish kings kept their promises to the city of Tallinn and the local nobility. The landlords of north and west Estonia who formed the Estonian nobility were represented by its general assembly, convened regularly every third year (Landtag), and its executive body — the college of magistrates (Landratscollegium). The Swedish monarchy was represented by the lord lieutenant, later governor, and the area was governed with the help of the nobility. Crown properties consisted of the lands formerly owned by the Livonian Order, monasteries and bishops, and deserted manorial estates; part of the lands that had been deserted in the war came under the control of the local aristocracy. For administration, these lands were divided into fiefdoms, subdivided into crown manors headed by bailiffs. The Swedish kings generously gave lands into private possession — in reward both for merit and for service. For that reason most of Estonian lands were in private ownership by the end of the 16th century, and the owners were mostly Baltic Germans. The Baltic German nobility gained extensive power in both the economic and political spheres, and later attempts of the crown to curb this power met with strong resistance. That central authority complied for such a long time was due to the continuous wars, which made it important to preserve the loyalty of the local aristocracy. Expansion Baltic provinces of Swedish Empire in the 17th century. Present-day Estonia consists of the Duchy of Estonia and parts of Swedish Livonia. The conquest of the Duchy of Estonia was the starting point of a policy of expansion for Sweden, which would lead to the period in its history sometimes referred to as the Swedish Empire. During the 17th century, Sweden attained large areas around the Baltic Sea. In 1629, Polish-controlled Livonia, including the southern parts of present-day Estonia, was conquered by Swedish forces, and in 1645 the island of Saaremaa (Ösel) was ceded by Denmark to Sweden as a part of the Peace Treaty of Brömsebro. While the surrender of northern Estonia to Sweden was seen as voluntary, Livonia was regarded as an occupied territory. King Gustavus II Adolphus (1611–1632) consequently only partly restored the privileges of the Livonian aristocracy, lost during the Polish years. Led by the governor- general, a strong central authority was developed and Swedish laws instituted. Much of the local aristocracy had also fled during the war, and instead members of the Swedish nobility moved to seize possession of many of the Livonian estates. The Swedish authorities exercised a strict control over religious and intellectual life, arranging regular inspections, the so-called visitations, from the end of the 16th century and throughout the 17th century. The higher clergy — bishops or superintendents — visited congregation after congregation to inspect the religious beliefs of peasants and to root out the remnants of paganism or Catholicism. The first large scale visitation was carried out by Johannes Rudbeckius. Gustavus II Adolphus also, through the aid of governor Johan Skytte, instituted the court of appeal in Tartu and the University of Tartu. However, the successors to Gustavus II Adolphus ceded more rights to the Livonian aristocracy. This was partly caused by the fact that the state had surrendered its economic and political power by transferring most crown properties to private hands (mostly Swedish high aristocracy for their merits). The Livonian nobility had won recognition by 1647: it too was now represented in a regional Landtag and an executive Landratscollegium. The Landtag was convened every three years and the policies discussed with the central authority. The aristocracy of Estonia, Livonia and Ösel (Saaremaa) had no representation in the Swedish Diet (Riksdag). During Charles XI The manor of Palms was built during the reign of Charles XI Charles XI initiated several reforms in Swedish-controlled Estonia The reign of King Charles XI (1672–1697) brought drastic changes to Sweden’s policy in its overseas provinces. As a result of the continuous warfare and the transfer of the crown properties into private possession, the revenues of the Swedish state had diminished. To increase its revenues, the so-called reduction of the possessions of the nobility was carried out. The reduction of manorial lands was linked to another radical change — the formation of absolutist monarchy under Charles XI, which sought to strengthen central authority in all parts of the empire and promoted strong links between the mainland and the overseas provinces. In 1680, the Swedish Riksdag declared the so-called Great Reduction. While former reductions had not spread to Estonia and Livonia, this decision extended to these areas as well. All holdings which had gone into private possession since the beginning of Swedish rule were to be reduced. This requirement met with fierce opposition from the local nobility. The local upper classes saw this decision by the Swedish Riksdag — taken without the approval of the local Landtags — as a violation of their rights, as the dual government of state and aristocracy which had functioned so far; in the understanding of the Livonian nobility the overseas provinces were linked to Sweden through a union. In the Duchy of Estonia, where land ownership was more clearly determined and there were more manors passed on according to an ancient inheritance law, the 1680 reduction went quite peacefully. The reduction was also followed by other reforms. The tenants of manors were no longer allowed to beat farmers; peasants could sue the tenants, even appeal to the king himself. It was forbidden to sell peasants without land, to send them away from their lands or to take over their lands. The status of Estonian peasants on crown manors was not yet comparable to free peasants in Sweden, but it was much better than the status of peasants on private lands. Charles XI announced his intention to abolish serfdom in Estonian crown manors when the reduction started, as serfdom was peculiar to the Baltic provinces. Great Northern War and the end of Swedish rule in Estonia The reforms carried out in Estonia under Charles XI did not have a long-lasting effect; in reality only Swedish church law was put into practice. In 1697 Charles XI died of cancer and his son Charles XII acceded to the throne and in 1700 the Great Northern War broke out. By 1699 an anti-Swedish alliance had been formed by Poland, Denmark and Russia. The war, which lasted to 1721 and in which one of the major Swedish victories was fought in Estonia, the Battle of Narva, ultimately proved disastrous to Sweden. In 1709, Russian forces had begun to lay siege to Riga, the centre of Livonia; after the capture of Riga in 1710 the Livonian and Estonian cities surrendered one after another. The war on Estonian territory ended with the capitulation of Tallinn in September 1710. As Russia considered the support of the local nobility to be essential in consolidating its power, the towns and the aristocrats achieved favourable terms of capitulation. The incorporation of Estonia and Livonia into Russia was stated in the Peace of Nystad in 1721, ending the warfare which had continued for ten more years outside Estonia.

(1875) The Three Fates (date unknown) Friedrich Paul Thumann (5 October 1834, Groß Schacksdorf-Simmersdorf – 19 February 1908, Berlin) was a German illustrator and painter.  Life  He was the son of a teacher. Originally, he intended to take up a career in science and attended the engineering school in Glogau.Intermedia: Excerpt from book: \\"Famous Paintings by Renowned Artists\\" His interests soon turned to art and, from 1854 to 1856, he attended the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. Until 1860, he worked in the studios of Julius Hübner in Dresden. After two years in Leipzig, he entered the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School, where he studied under Ferdinand Pauwels. He became a professor there in 1866. During the Franco-Prussian War, he was a draftsman at the Prussian Third Army's headquarters. In 1875, he was appointed Professor at the Academy of Arts, Berlin and held that position until 1887. He travelled extensively throughout his life; visiting Hungary and Transylvania and spending some time studying in England, in addition to the usual art-related tours of Italy and France. From 1887 to 1891, he lived in Italy. He took over the Master Studio of Professor Julius Schrader in 1892. He primarily worked as an illustrator, producing plates for books by Goethe, Tennyson, Chamisso, Heine and many others. The elegance of his illustrations attracted many admirers but, as time went by, his work became increasingly facile. He married a woman from the English nobility. One of his daughters married a brother of the poet Algernon Swinburne. In 1893, Thumann exhibited his work Psyche at Nature's Mirror at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where it got the interest of the management of the White Rock Mineral Water who then purchased the reproduction rights from Thumann to use the image as part of the logo for their mineral water.

The SMODIM is the primary component of the Longbow Apache Tactical Engagement Simulation System (LBA TESS) that provides weapons systems training and collective Force-on-Force live training participation. TESS is an advanced weapons training system developed for the AH-64 Apache to support force-on- force and force-on-target live training at U.S. Army Combat Training Centers (CTCs), Aviation Home Stations, and deployed locations. TESS integrates with aircraft and ground vehicles to provide collective opposing force participation in live training. The Aerial Weapons Scoring System (AWSS) integration with LBA TESS provides the ability to conduct force-on-target engagements using live ammunition for 30 mm gun, rockets, and simulated Hellfire missiles. Gunnery scoring is supported by the SMODIM, which transmits aviation data from the LBA to the Exercise Control (EXCON). AWSS scores the pilot's live-fire gunnery performance and provides constructive After Action Review (AAR) feedback. Designed and manufactured by Inter-Coastal Electronics, Inc (ICE), \\"The SMODIM is fully compatible with the multiple integrated laser engagement system (MILES) and laser-based direct fire weapons. Additionally, it eliminates the requirement for MILES-type lasers by providing the capability to geometrically pair weapon engagements\\". SMODIM  Background  In 1992, Inter-Coastal Electronics was selected by U.S. Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM) to provide the real-time casualty assessment (RTCA) interface for the AH-64 Apache Attack Helicopter. This component was called the onboard data interface module (ODIM). As the Army incorporated new technologies, the SMODIM added GPS and telemetry and became the core component of live helicopter training systems at all U.S. Army Combat Training Centers (CTCs) with a fielding of over 240 systems. In 1997, the SMODIM was modified to provide a proof of concept for the upgraded AH-64 (D model) Longbow Apache. In 1998 the \\"Modular\\" SMODIM and the longbow tactical engagement simulation system (TESS) training system was fielded to all three CTCs and Aviation Home Stations, and became the U.S. Army's first fully integrated live aviation training system. Over the following 15 years, the SMODIM has deployed in multiple systems and platforms with over one thousand SMODIMs fielded in the U.S. and abroad. An \\"Advanced\\" SMODIM or \\"ASMODIM\\" is currently in development due to parts obsolescence and will provide an 80% increased processing performance. Security encryption is in accordance with FIPS 140-2 level 2. Advanced weapon simulation is augmented by digital terrain elevation data (DTED) and geometric ranging. Data communication and data transmission upgrades utilize RS-422 and RS-485 full duplex channels, and ARINC 429 technical standards.  Overview  The SMODIM includes a built-in GPS receiver, telemetry radio, data recorder, and MIL-STD-1553 mux bus processors. The SMODIM interfaces with the weapons systems and actively tracks, records and transmits data to the ground station or exercise control (EXCON). RTCA feedback is passed directly to the weapons processor and the ground station through the onboard telemetry radio. The SMODIM processes area weapons effects (AWE) data received from the EXCON and computes geometric pairing solutions for weapon engagements using the RF Hellfire, semi-automated laser (SAL) Hellfire, 30 mm chain gun, and rockets. It selects a target from its onboard player/position database in the appropriate weapons impact footprint, then uses the probability-of-hit (Ph) factor to determine the assessment (i.e., ‘hit’/‘miss’). Via the data link, it then informs the target it has been selected for assessment. The SMODIM maintains a dynamic position database through player-to-player network communications. The onboard telemetry radio supports simultaneous distribution to multiple locations. The radio acts as a message repeater to overcome line of sight (LOS) interruptions. The SMODIM interfaces with distributed interactive simulation (DIS) networks using SMODIM tracking analysis and recording (SMOTAR), an advanced software suite that provides visual display and tracking of SMODIM instrumented players. GPS provides real-time position data as players are dynamically simulated, tracked and recorded over tactical maps and aerial photos for after-action review (AAR). The TESS Aircraft System consists of an “A” kit that becomes part of the aircraft, and a “B” kit that is added to the aircraft for training exercises. The “A” kit includes the SMODIM Tray Assembly, modified software in the weapons display and systems processors, with cable connection provisions.

It is owned by the City of Glendale, administered by the GWP Commission, and governed by the Glendale City Council. Glendale Water & Power is a Reliable Public Power Provider (RP3). The RP3 designation is awarded to those public power utilities that provide customers with the highest degree of reliable and safe electric service. For the second year in a row GWP has earned the RP3 designation from the American Public Power Association. GWP is one of 176 public power utilities out of 2,000 nationwide to earn this designation. GWP is constantly modernizing its electric grid and water system through upgrades and improvements which strengthens its ability to meet demand, maintain reliability and efficiency, save water, and increase the amount of renewable energy. These improvements will also reduce costs for GWP, help customers lower their bills and help the environment. Renewable energy GWP has a long history of supporting renewable energy. In 1937, Glendale became one of the first California cities to contract with the Federal Government to purchase hydropower from Hoover Dam, and has been generating electricity using landfill gas from Scholl Canyon since 1994. More recently, GWP has made long term investments in wind, small hydroelectric and geothermal generation resources. In addition, GWP built a 261 KW solar photovoltaic generating system on top of the parking garage at Glendale Community College. GWP adopted a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) in 2004, which is being updated to comply with recent changes in California law. The GWP RPS recognizes the intent of the Californian Legislature to encourage renewable resources, while taking into consideration the effect on rates, reliability, financial resources, and the goal of environmental improvement. The current GWP RPS sets an initial goal of 20% of its annual energy requirements from renewable energy sources through 2015, with a step-up to 25% in 2016 and another step-up to 33% in 2020. Today, GWP proudly provides well over 20% of its energy requirements from renewable resources. History =Electricity= Three years after Glendale was incorporated, the city took interest in municipal ownership of its own “light and power” system. In early 1909 Glendale needed street lighting and the cost quoted by electric service companies was expensive. Glendale held a $60,000 bond issue election to acquire and construct an electric works system for the city. It paid $23,000 for the privately owned Glendale Light and Power Company, located within corporate limits. The rest of the money was spent on improvement of the distribution system and expanded to provide power to residences not previously served by the system. Until 1937, the city purchased all of its power from the Southern California Edison Company, the successor to the Pacific Light and Power Company that initially sold the young Glendale utility its electricity. That year, the city entered into contracts to meet growing demand by receiving power from Hoover Dam. However, studies conducted in 1938 showed that this additional power would not be enough after 1942, so the city established its own steam-electric generating plant, Grayson Power Plant (GPP). It was named after the first Chief Engineer and General Manager Loren Grayson, who received his appointment on April 1, 1951. The first unit, with a capacity of 20,000 kilowatts, entered service in 1941. Over the years, GWP added several units to its Grayson Power Plant, the latest a 50-megawatt unit added in 2003 provides enough electricity to serve 10,000 homes. =Water Supply= In 1906 there were at least 14 private water companies operating in Glendale. By 1913, Glendale placed a $248,000 bond issue before voters to provide funds to purchase and improve the water system to serve a city of 14,000 residents. In 1914 the bond measure passed and the municipal water system began its operation. As city grew, other water companies were purchased and added to the system. During the first five years of operation, the municipal water system relied almost entirely upon water flowing by gravity from Verdugo Canyon; however, as the city expanded, the utility turned to local groundwater wells to meet additional needs. In November 1928, the electorates of Glendale and 12 other Southern California cities voted to form the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and build the Colorado River Aqueduct, due to the challenges of water supply. The aqueduct was completed in 1941, and in 1946 Glendale first tapped into its Metropolitan source. The amount of water purchased from Metropolitan increased over the years, and today accounts for almost two-thirds of the supply. Additional supplies come from local sources, including groundwater. Glendale also uses treated, recycled water for irrigation and street cleaning.

Purpose and Uses  The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve’s primary function is to host the National Boy Scout Scout Jamboree every 4 years. The climbing walls at The Summit Bechtel Reserve make up the largest outdoor climbing facility in the world. The rock climbing structure was built to be a key part of the programming for the National Jamboree in 2013, keeping in mind that it would also be used in a larger event in 2019, the World Scout Jamboree.  Size and Features  The rock climbing area features over 60,000 square feet of climbing terrain, and enough designated climbing lanes to accommodate over 200 climbers at any given time. The area is split into two parts, The Rocks and Boulder Cove.  The Rocks  The Rocks has 36 rappelling stations, six free- standing boulders, and over 150 different climbing stations between the six boulders and the six climbing fins. On these climbing fins, there are over 30 TRUEBLUE automatic belay devices. These devices were chosen because they allow single climbers to climb without the need for a belayer and they provide a safer experience for climbers. The auto belays are also used in a feature called the “Leap of Faith” that can be done between the two rappelling towers located in the climbing facility.  The Boulder Cove  The Boulder Cove features top rope climbing, rappelling, and bouldering features. The top-rope climbing structures range in height from 19 to 36 feet. There are 25 lanes that can accommodate a single climber at any given time. These structures also have designated lanes for rappelling. Along with the 12 rappel stations on the climbing walls, there is a 72-foot platform where patrons can rappel as well. Lastly, there are three climbing boulders with an average height of 13 feet.  How The Rocks and Boulder Cove Came to be the World's Largest Climbing Facility  Initially, the outdoor climbing facility at the Summit Bechtel National Scout Reserve was not purposely intended to be the largest in the world. The required function, however, determined the necessary form. The Summit Bechtel National Scout Reserve was to be the site of the 2013 National Boy Scout Jamboree, an event that brings over 40,000 Scouts nationwide to one location for a week of camping and adventuring. In order to accommodate the necessary throughput, Eldorado Climbing Walls, the climbing wall manufacturer responsible for the design and construction of the structures, had to create the world’s largest man made outdoor climbing facility. In an interview, the lead designer on the project, Jason Thomas, said that, “the largest driving factor of our design was the fact that we had to move 30,000 to 40,000 Scouts through these walls and create a lasting experience for each and every one of them. A 30,000 square foot climbing gym might take two, three months to design. These walls are small climbing gyms put together.” The final design was determined by a number of requirements. The walls not only had to host 40,000 Scouts over a week’s period, but they also had to blend seamlessly into the surrounding New River Gorge. On top of that, the walls needed to provide terrain appropriate for all skill levels, from beginners to seasoned climbers. Finally, the walls needed to allow for smooth traffic flow in a high volume situation.  Construction  The walls were constructed by Eldorado Climbing Walls from a rock-realistic product called SHOTRock, a Glass Fiber Reinforced Concrete that mimics the look and feel of real rock. This product was chosen for its durability in outdoor applications, which was especially important in West Virginia, where the structures would be subject to rain, snow, and sunlight as the seasons shifted. West Virginia’s weather patterns impacted the construction process as well as the product chosen. During the winter of 2012-2013, there were many days and nights of heavy snow, which posed challenges on the construction crews. Concrete blankets, heaters, and various other methods were employed to help the product cure and set properly. Construction began in late 2012 and was completed just a few weeks before the Summit Bechtel National Scout Reserve was to open its grounds to the National Boy Scouts Jamboree on July 15, 2013.

Naipaul, first published by Andre Deutsch in the UK in 1967. Introduction Not long after finishing A Flag on the Island, Naipaul began work on the novel The Mimic Men, though for almost a year he did not make significant progress. At the end of this period, he was offered a Writer-in-Residence fellowship at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. There, in early 1966, Naipaul began to rewrite his material, and went on to complete the novel quickly. The finished novel broke new ground for him. Unlike his earlier fiction, it is not comic. It does not unfold chronologically. Its language is allusive and ironic, and its overall structure is whimsical. It has strands of both fiction and non-fiction, a precursor of Naipaul's approach in later novels. It is intermittently dense, even obscure, but it also has beautiful passages, especially in the descriptions of the fictional tropical island of Isabella. The subject of sex appears explicitly for the first time in Naipaul's work. Plot summary The plot, to the extent that there is one, is centred on Ralph Singh, an Indo- Caribbean politician from Isabella who narrates in the first person. Singh is in exile in London and attempting to write his political memoirs. Earlier, in the immediate aftermath of decolonisation in a number of British colonies in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Singh shared political power with a more powerful Afro-Caribbean politician. Soon the memoirs take on a more personal aspect. There are flashbacks to the formative and defining periods of Singh's life. In many of these, during crucial moments, whether during his childhood, his married life, or his political career, he appears to abandon engagement and enterprise. He rationalises later that these belong only to fully made societies.

The stagecoach station provided food and shelter to travelers along the stagecoach line. After the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad extended its line further into central Wyoming in the early 20th century, the stagecoach line became obsolete and the station closed.

Designed by Győr-based Rába Magyar Vagon- és Gépgyár works, it was extensively used by the Royal Hungarian Army during World War II. The truck was based on a successful Raba AFi truck chassis, but was built in a relatively rare configuration of 6x4. This 1.5 ton lorry was used to ferry both cargo and personnel. There is only one surviving truck, currently in the Transport Museum of Budapest.  Design and development  Development of the new vehicle for the Royal Hungarian Army started in 1937, when Dezső Winkler was ordered by the Ministry of Defence to create a project of a 1.5-ton lorry to be used as personnel carrier. In order to have the ability for higher cross-country mobility but also keep the costs down, the truck received the 6x4 configuration. To aid in difficult terrain, the construction received a number of innovative mechanisms. One was the second axle, raised above the ground level and in contact only at the peak of a summit. Another innovation was a set of two rollers mounted at the front bumper that were intended to aid in crossing of ditches. The latter feature was a copy of a similar mechanism used in the 31M H-2 lorry designed by Zsigmond Hollós of the Manfred Weiss Steel and Metal Works (HMW). Two prototypes were built and were well received by the Ministry of Defence. The initial configuration allowed for 14 people to be transported in an open cargo compartment and the cab. The lorry was designed to be able to tow up to 2000 kilograms in a trailer, it was also equipped with a factory-installed winch.  Production and variants  As no factory in Hungary could cope with such a massive government order, the 38M Botond was built by a consortium of six companies, with HMW and Mavag as the main contractors and Láng, Ganz Works and HSCS works producing various parts. Between 1938 and 1941 the consortium built 1443 38M Botond trucks. When Hungary joined World War II, a new version (dubbed 38M Botond B) entered serial production. Only minor changes to the design were introduced: some steel parts were replaced with cheaper and easier to obtain materials, the engine power was increased from 70 to 72 Horsepower. The ministry ordered 1400 more vehicles in 1942 and an additional order for 657 vehicles followed in 1943 (all Botond B variant). However, some completed and half-completed lorries were destroyed by Allied bombers during bombing raids on MW works and MAVAG. As the design proved adequate, it was often field-converted to various roles, including radio cars, command vehicles, artillery trailers and tank tows. Although some of the factories were destroyed, the production continued well into 1944, with 882 out of 2098 trucks ordered for that year delivered to the armed forces. After the Soviet take-over of Hungary several trucks were completed out of spare parts and delivered to the Ministry of Defence in 1948. In 1943 an upgraded version, the 38M Botond C was designed. It featured a 100 HP six-cylinder engine. However, the sole prototype was destroyed in an Allied air raid. After the war the works on the C version briefly resumed, but were abandoned as a D-350 Steyr truck license-built by Csepel was found to be a much superior design. The remaining pieces were gradually withdrawn from military units in favour of the D-350.

The script was written by Akira Kurosawa. Plot Mataemon Araki (Toshiro Mifune), a renowned swordsman, helps a young man find vengeance. The opening scene has Araki sternly accosting Jinza with a formal proclamation of vengeance for the killing of his family member. Jinza (Takashi Shimura) cackles villainously and an epic fight commences. Just then a narrator breaks in to explain that this is a traditional version of the showdown at Kagiya Corner that has been told through the centuries which happened at the start of the 17th century. It is about a vendetta because of the killing of a family member, and the samurai connected with the family want revenge and Araki is one of the samurai who go looking for a showdown. The facts surrounding the vendetta have been expanded and distorted through the telling, and the villain Jinza was actually a noble man and the close friend of Mataemon Araki, whom he faces off against at Kagiya corner. The narrative returns to November 7, 1634, and Mataemon's party arrives at an inn on the site one hour before the fight will take place.

The game was released for the PlayStation 4 in December 2016, and in Japan in February 2017. It was released free-to-play for Windows in September 2018. Gameplay Under the supervision of a skateboarding grim reaper called Uncle Death, players fight through a treacherous tower, obtaining various types of weapons and armor while finding creatures and mushrooms to eat in order to stay alive. Upon death, a player’s “death data” is then circulated among other player’s games where they will appear as formidable opponents. The sharing of “death data” is one of the various asynchronous multiplayer elements that can be found in the game. Development Let It Die was originally known as \\"'Lily Bergamo\\". Its initial plot focused on a female protagonist called Tae Ioroi and was set in the year 2026. The game's world drew from both Japanese and Western cultures. It was described as a \\"super action game\\" or an \\"extreme action game\\". The game was supposed to feature an \\"element of growth\\", in that by gradually accumulating experience, the player's data is updated more and more rapidly. Lily Bergamo would have featured online play and features, though details were currently still unknown. In addition to the game, Lily Bergamo would feature a \\"companion app\\", which would be playable on smartphones. The game would feature online play, and according to GungHo Online Entertainment’s CEO Kazuki Morishita, would allow \\"both smartphone and PlayStation gamers to be in the same world”. According to Morishita, Grasshopper Manufacture \\"wants to make the most out of the strengths of online play, and the idea of using smartphones to play has been a big deal”, with the goal of the app being the ability for players \\"to completely rely on their smartphones to play\\". Although Lily Bergamo changed to Let It Die during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014, the concept of an \\"extreme action game\\" remained. The change commenced around the end of 2013. Executive director Goichi Suda explained that the concept of death is relevant throughout the game, and that if one player dies in a game, they will appear in another player's game, making the deaths of players important in the experience of the game, hence the title. The game will have normal AI enemies and dead player characters' avatars, and will also be free-to-play. The game represents a huge departure from Suda's past video games in terms of creative philosophy. 250px Lily Bergamo was to be the first game to be developed by Grasshopper Manufacture after it was acquired by GungHo Online Entertainment. Suda stated that Lily Bergamo was conceived after GungHo CEO Kazuki Morishita expressed his desire to \\"make a game that leverages the inherent flavor of both companies.” The game was revealed in April 2013, and in Sony Computer Entertainment Japan Asia's Press Conference on September 9, 2013, the release date was set to sometime in 2014. Additional information was shown at the 2013 Tokyo Game Show, including the name of the protagonist, the ability to play on smartphones and the game's setting. At the game show, a special stage event was held for Lily Bergamo, including a cosplay model dressed up as the game's protagonist Tae Ioroi, and specially-made Lily Bergamo stickers were distributed. Although the game was not playable then, Suda promised that it would be at the 2014 Tokyo Game Show instead. Yusuke Kozaki was the head of character design in Lily Bergamo, along with direction by Nobutaka Ichiki and game design by Yusuke Kozaki. A trademark for Lily Bergamo has been filed in North America, which hinted at a soon-to-be confirmed release in that region and globally. On June 11, 2014 at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014, Lily Bergamo was transformed into Let It Die. GungHo Online Entertainment had trademarked Lily Bergamo in the United States, hinting at a possible global release, with the reveal of Let It Die confirming it. On October 29, 2015, GungHo Online Entertainment announced that Let It Die had been delayed, and that it would now launch in 2016 instead of its originally planned 2015 release window. On December 3, 2016, Let It Die was released for free on PlayStation Network in North America and Europe. Let It Die featured 100 Japanese artists in the rock and metal music genres curated by Silent Hill series game music composer Akira Yamaoka, who described the work as a \\"one-of- a-kind musical experience\\". Reception Let It Die received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

The FSG was created to serve as a stateside replacement for the Florida National Guard while the National Guard was deployed abroad. Unlike the Florida National Guard, the Florida State Guard was trained and funded by the state and therefore could not be federalized and was available to the governor of Florida whenever needed. Although the force was disbanded, Florida law allows the governor of Florida to create and maintain a Florida state defense force should he or she decide to do so. Creation Before the United States entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt instituted a peacetime draft, and federalized various National Guard units, including Florida's National Guard. As a result, states which had previously counted on their National Guard to maintain peace, quell riots, protect against sabotage, or repel a potential invasion were given the alternative of creating their own state-level military forces under the State Guard Act signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on October 21, 1940. In 1941, the Florida Legislature and Governor Holland created Florida Defense Force, later to be rebranded as the Florida State Guard. Membership Membership was open to all men in Florida aged 18 to 63. The commitment lasted for three years, although members who were eligible could be drafted into the federal military at any time. Most of the members were veterans of World War I. Members of the Florida Defense Force's air wing, the First Air Squadron, were required to either have a private pilot's license or have served in the military at least one year. By 1943, the Florida State Guard numbered 2,100 men in 36 units. Duties The purpose of the state defense forces, including the FSG, was to fulfil the National Guard's state obligations. This included guarding infrastructure, protecting against sabotage, calming riots, or aiding law enforcement. Although the mainland United States was never invaded during World War II, state defenses would have shared responsibility with the federal military and National Guard in defending American territory had an invasion occurred. During the war, the First Air Squadron of the FSG regularly patrolled the coast of Florida, searching for German U-boats. The squadron was also used to assist in search-and-rescue missions. Organization Each county was able to organize its own unit so long as it could recruit at minimum fifty men who met the qualifications required by the state. By 1943, there were 63 separate units of state guardsmen organized. The FSG also maintained a separate air squadron, known as the First Air Squadron Equipment Uniforms, surplus weapons, and other equipment were provided by the state of Florida. Florida law also permitted the FSG to use National Guard armories and receive any surplus weapons and equipment offered by the Department of Defense. The approximately 27 airplanes used by the First Air Squadron were privately owned by the fifteen individuals who piloted them; however, they were allowed to have \\"1st Air Squadron, Florida Defense Force\\" painted on both sides of the nose of each plane. Disbandment The Florida State Guard was disbanded in 1947 after the Florida Army National Guard was released from Federal Active Duty. Legal status State defense forces are authorized by the federal government under Title 32, Section 109 of the United States Code. Twenty-three states, as well as the territory of Puerto Rico, actively maintain these forces. Florida law also allows the creation of a state defense force, either as a full-sized force when any part of the National Guard is federally deployed, or as a reserve cadre of officers and non-commissioned officers regardless of National Guard deployment. Reactivation efforts As of April 2018, a renewed effort is underway to explore the viability of restarting an official Florida State Guard or State Defense Force. The Florida State Defense Force Reactivation Project maintains the Facebook group and a sister website set up for this purpose.

It opened with a rhythmic dance featuring 126 performers dressed in the colors of the Russian flag. Russian dance and music were featured throughout, as performances were interspersed with animated segments featuring drawings of the firebird, a staple of Russian mythology, by Alexander Petrov. Tchaikovsky's \\"Sugar Plum Fairy\\" and an homage to ice fishing were among the performances. Many of the show's 2500 performers were disabled, including singer Yuliya Samoylova who led the choir in a performance of \\"Together\\". During the March of Nations, athletes entered from a central ramp, just as in the opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Soviet-era rock music played as the nations alphabetically (in the Russian alphabet) paraded through a \\"forest\\" of 204 light poles. Ukraine was represented by a single athlete carrying their flag to represent the 23-person team in an apparent protest to the situation in Crimea, Ukraine. Carrying the flag, biathlete Mykhaylo Tkachenko drew a loud applause as he entered the stadium. As the host nation, Russia entered last to the tune of the 1988 song \\"The Last Letter\\" by the famous rock band Nautilus Pompilius. The song is better known as \\"Goodbye America\\" in Russia, reflecting a famous line from the song: \\"Good- bye, America that I will never see. Will I hear your song that I will always remember?\\" The final segment of the performance featured a number based on the plays of Anton Chekhov and stage singer Maria Guleghina singing a song based on the poetry of Mikhail Lermontov while riding an ice-breaking ship named Mir (Peace). During his speech at the opening ceremony International Paralympic Committee president Philip Craven noted that Russia had declined to host the 1980 Paralympics in conjunction with the 1980 Summer Olympics, making this the first time Russia has hosted the games. He called on spectators to have \\"barrier-free mind\\" just as \\"the city of Sochi has built a barrier-free environment for athletes and officials to enjoy\\". Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the games open, drawing loud cheers. Russian Paralympians Olesya Vladykina and Sergey Shilov shared the honor of lighting the Paralympic torch.

The car was built on a Dino 206 S chassis and used a unique 2-litre, 48-valve, flat-12 engine, a development of the 1512 1.5-litre Formula One engine. Driven by Peter Schetty, the car dominated the 1969 European Hill Climb Championship, placing first in every race it entered and setting many course records. Development history In 1964, Ferrari developed a 1.5- litre flat-12 engine for its 1512 F1 car. This basic design by Mauro Forghieri was modified by Stefano Jacoponi to create the Tipo 232 2-litre version used in the 212 E. Overall capacity of this engine was 1990.08cc, bore and stroke was 65mm X 50mm and the compression ratio was 11:1. Initially, the engine produced approximately 280-290 bhp at 11,500 rpm. Two units of the Tipo 232 motor were produced, with the first scrapped following initial development and dyno testing. The second Tipo 232 engine was installed in the 1967 Sport 2000, a testbed car based on a 206 S Dino chassis (number 020). This car was tested in late 1967 by Chris Amon at Modena and announced as a contender in the 1968 European Hill Climb Championship, but did not compete that season. Instead, this chassis was subsequently used (with a different Ferrari V12 drivetrain) in the Pininfarina 250 P5 show car, displayed at the Geneva, Los Angeles and Turin auto shows in 1968. Dino chassis 020 and the Tipo 232 motor were reunited in late 1968, when Scuderia Ferrari decided to develop the Sport 2000 into the 212 E, under the supervision of Forghieri. The car was not considered reliable enough to compete in endurance events and was instead optimized to race the short, winding courses of the European Hill Climb Championship. Peter Schetty was chosen to test and race the 212 E. Schetty was an experienced hill climb racer and test driver who would later become Scuderia Ferrari team manager. Following testing at Modena and Vallelunga, the 212 E was modified from its Sport 2000 specification. Headlights were removed, fuel capacity was reduced and the car's plastic body was modified to optimize aerodynamics and weight for hillclimbs. Engine output and cooling systems were also improved. Power output at the start of the 1969 racing season varied from 300 to 320 bhp depending on tune. The 212 E was also equipped with inboard rear disc brakes, in order to reduce unsprung mass. Overall weight was 500 kg. As the 212 E, the car was given serial number 0862. The numerical designation \\"212\\" refers to the 2-liter 12-cylinder engine, with the \\"E Montagna\\" designating its role as a racer in the \\"Europeo Montagna\\" Championship. The name is similar, but not a direct reference, to that of the 1950s Ferrari 212 Export. Racing history Scuderia Ferrari entered the 212 E in the 1969 European Hillclimb Championship with Peter Schetty driving, supported by Ferrari engineer Gianni Marelli and two mechanics. Racing in the sport class, the car dominated the competition, winning every race in which it was entered. Minor modifications of gearing, aerodynamics and suspension setup were made during the season to adapt the car for each course. After seven victories, including six absolute course records, the team withdrew from the final race of the season as they had already clinched the championship. The 212 E's dominance in 1969 was ensured by the lack of any viable rival, with the nearest competition the Abarth 2000 driven by Arturo Merzario with 50 fewer horsepower. However, the car's overall speed was undeniable, evidenced by the course record Schetty set at Côte de Cesana- Sestrière, which remained unbroken for 13 years. The car did not compete in 1970, although there was tremendous interest during this time from various drivers who wished to purchase the car from the factory. Ferrari eventually sold the car in late 1970 to Edoardo Lualdi-Gabardi, who commissioned the factory to fit a new body designed by Piero Lardi Ferrari. The original 212 E bodywork was subsequently fitted to a Dino 206 S, with which it still remains. Lualdi-Gabardi successfully raced the 212 E in hill climbs during the 1971 season. Significance The 212 E Montagna is historically significant due to its competition success and unique engine, as well as the chassis' use in the Pininfarina 250 P5 show car. Forghieri considered the 212 E and its Tipo 232 engine as a test platform and important developmental step towards the 1970s 312B F1 cars and 312PB sports racers, which used a newly designed 3.0-litre flat-12 engine. The 212 E Montagna sold to a private buyer at RM's 2006 Scottsdale auction for $1,650,000.

The main settlement is the town of Killaloe. Location The parish is in the barony of Tulla. It is from Ennis and from Dublin. The name is said to be a corrupt form of Kill- da-Lua, and to be derived from the foundation of an abbey by St. Lua or Molua in the 6th century. The town is on the west bank of the Shannon near the falls of Killaloe, about a mile from Lough Derg. In 1837 an old bridge with 19 arches crossed the river at this point. The parish in 1837 covered 13,045 statute acres, most of which were farmed. History The town became head of a diocese founded about 639 by Pope John IV. The first bishop was Saint Flannan. Turlogh O’Brien built a bridge over the River Shannon at Killaloe in 1054. Hugh O’Connor destroyed the castle of Killaloe in 1061 and burned the town. It was burned again in 1080 and 1084. Moriertach, King of Ireland was buried in Killaloe in 1120 in a great ceremony. In 1177 the town was the scene of a ceremony in which Raymond Le Gros received the hostages of Roderic, King of Connaught, and O’Brien, Prince of Thomond, who took the oath of fealty to the King of England. The church became a pilgrim destination. Donald, King of Limerick, erected the cathedral in 1160. The town was destroyed in 1367 by Murrogh-na-Ranagh. In 1831 there were 8,887 inhabitants of the parish, of whom 1,411 lived in the town.

Photograph about the Weiss Manfréd Works in Csepel Island in 1901. The industrial complex consisted more than 32 factories. During WW1, it became the largest company of baron Manfred Weiss with more than 30,000 workers, and the only company which bore his name. However, the total number of workers in all companies owned by Weiss Manfred exceeded the 200,000, making the baron the biggest industrial employer of Europe. The Weiss Manfréd Acél- és Fémművek (\\"Manfréd Weiss Steel and Metal Works\\"), or colloquially Csepel Művek (\\"Csepel Works\\") was one of the largest machine factories in Hungary, located on Csepel island in the southern part of Budapest. It was the second largest industrial enterprise in the Austro- Hungarian Monarchy, and the biggest industrial enterprise in the Hungarian half of the Empire. It played an integral role in the heavy industry and military production of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Founded by Baron Manfréd Weiss of Csepel, a Jewish origin industrialist, by the time of World War I the company was one of largest defense contractors in Austria-Hungary, producing all types of equipment, from airplanes and munitions to automotive engines, bicycles Csepel bicycle and cars. Badly damaged by Allied air raids and eventually pillaged during World War II, the company continued in existence until 1950, when it was nationalised and renamed to Rákosi Mátyás Vas- és Fémművek (\\"Mátyás Rákosi Iron and Metal Works NV\\", where \\"NV\\" means Nemzeti Vállalat, \\"National Company\\").  History  In the late 19th century, the company, then owned exclusively by Manfréd Weiss, expanded into production of ammunition for the Austro-Hungarian Army and Navy. The new factory produced all types, from small arms to artillery shells. Thus, Manfréd Weiss became one of the principal defence contractors for the Hungarian part of the empire, his main competitor being the state-owned steel mill in Diósgyőr, the Diósgyőr- Vasgyár. In 1906, the company was supported by Hungarian Society of Industrialists, who lobbied for a new law that would allow state-owned companies to produce only products unobtainable from private companies. With such support, the Manfréd Weiss Works soon emerged as the largest firm on the market. Another boost in company's history came in 1911, when Austria-Hungary significantly expanded its military budget. The public orders allowed the company to quickly expand ammunition production and establish additional factories: new steel and iron furnaces, and new copper, nickel, and aluminium installations. Production capacity was growing and soon the firm became one of the principal sources of ammunition for the armies of the Kingdom of Serbia, Kingdom of Bulgaria, Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and the Russian Empire. By 1913, the Manfréd Weiss Works employed over 5000 workers. During World War I, the workforce exceeded 30,000. For his services to the Austro-Hungarian state, Weiss was ennobled, becoming Manfréd, Baron Weiss de Csepel, after the main seat of operations of his company. In the beginning of the WW1, the WM complex had 250 hectare territory with 216 factory buildings. By the outbreak of World War II, the company had become a modern industrial conglomerate, with over 40,000 employees; its management remained largely composed of Hungarian Jews. When Nazi Germany overran Hungary in 1944, the majority were arrested by the Gestapo. The Weiss family was allowed to emigrate to Portugal and escape the horrors of the Holocaust, but their large art collection, along with the entire industrial complex bearing their name, was taken over by Germany. However, as Germany insisted Hungary was still a sovereign nation, the owners of the company received large compensation and remained official owners, with the German-imposed management merely a trusteeship for a period of 25 years. Eventually, control over the company was given to the Nazi SS, with a completely new holding company's management, with officers including Erhard Milch, Kurt Baron von Schröder, and Hans Jüttner.

He led volunteer forces from Oregon in the Cayuse War and the Modoc War, prospected for gold in the California Gold Rush, and represented Jackson County, Oregon in the Oregon Territorial Legislature and Oregon State Senate.  Biography  John E. Ross moved with his father, Angus Ross, to Fountain County, Indiana, when he was ten years old; and to Cook County, Illinois, in 1833. In 1840, he married the daughter of Alexander Robinson, of Chicago. She died about eight months later. In 1847, Ross came to Oregon as captain of a 40-wagon train. Ross, Joseph Kline, and an Englishman, left the company at Grand Ronde, with the intention of coming on through ahead of them. On the road beyond Rock Creek, they found a train that had been attacked by the Indians. They overtook the emigrants after crossing John Day River, who proved to be the Warren party. They had been robbed of all they possessed, including their clothing. Ross traded his clothes to the Indians for provisions for the destitute band, and remained with them until his own train arrived, all coming to Oregon together. General Ross landed at The Dalles without a dollar, and went to work on a boat which brought down emigrants to the falls, at one dollar per day. About the first of November 1847, he went to Oregon City and opened a butcher shop, which he operated for about a month. When the Cayuse War broke out, Ross enlisted in the first volunteer company, known as the \\"Oregon Rifles\\" with H. A. G. Lee, captain, and Joseph Magone, first lieutenant. Ross, as second lieutenant, went with the company to the mission station at The Dalles, on the Columbia River. When Lee and Magone were promoted, Ross was commissioned as Captain of the company, a position he held throughout the war. In 1848, after the Cayuse War, he returned to Oregon City. He was running a threshing machine when he heard about the California Gold Rush. He left his machine standing in the field, and went to the mines on Feather River, where he engaged in mining until the fall of 1849. He then returned to Oregon but in the spring of 1850, he returned to the mines in California, which made him party to those who found gold on the Scott River. In 1851, he came to Yreka, California, before going on to Josephine Creek in Oregon; at the latter he was part of those people who found gold on Canyon Creek, in Josephine County, Oregon. He also found \\"several rich placers\\", including Yankee Jim's (Placer County, California), Wambo Bar (Yuba River), and Jacksonville (now fully submerged under Don Pedro Reservoir).California Historical Landmarks Farm residence of Colonel John E. Ross, 3 miles northeast of Jacksonville, Oregon Ross returned to the Willamette Valley in the winter of 1851 and purchased a herd of cattle, driving the cattle to the Rogue River Valley in January 1852, and opened a butcher's shop at Jacksonville, Oregon. In the fall of 1852, General Ross raised a company of thirty men and went to rescue immigrants who were attacked at Bloody Point on Tule Lake. They joined Benjamin Wright's company at Clear Lake, and with them met a party of immigrants between Clear and Goose Lakes, returning with them. On the road they buried about fourteen of the immigrants, who had been killed by Indians. Ross and his company paid their own expenses on this trip, and for pay they received the thanks of the Oregon Legislature. In January 1853, he married Elizabeth Hopwood. This was the first marriage performed in Jacksonville. A Methodist preacher by the name of Gilbert officiated at the ceremony. Ross settled on a farm in December 1853. The couple had nine children, five girls and four boys. In August 1853, an Indian war broke out, and Ross became a colonel in command of two battalions of mounted volunteers. After operating a few days in conjunction with Colonel Alden, of the U.S. Army, and having only a few skirmishes with the Indians, General Lane arrived and took command. After a hard-fought battle on the headwaters of Evans Creek, in which General Lane and Colonel Alden were wounded, and Pleasant Armstrong and several others killed, Colonel Ross was part of the group assisting General Lane in negotiating a treaty at the Council of Table Rock. The negotiations were held near Lower Table Rock, with Takelma leader Apserkahar (\\"Chief Joe\\") and representatives of the Shasta and Dakubetede Indians of the Rogue River Valley. According to another source, Ross acted as interpreter, both at the preliminary arrangements for the treaty, and at the treaty itself, although James W. Nesmith was the appointed interpreter by General Lane. The Indians, however, did not know Nesmith, and were acquainted with General Ross, and it was only through him that they would communicate what they had to say in relation to the treaty. In 1854, Ross was ordered by the Governor to organize a company and sent them out to protect the immigrants on the southern route, which was done, Captain Walker commanding. On June 5 of that year he was commissioned colonel of the 9th Regiment by Governor John W. Davis. In the fall of 1855, a breakout of the Indians, not only in his county but in the northern part of the Oregon as well, resulted in a general war. Colonel Ross took the field as commander of the 9th Regiment, fought several severe battles, and was at length superseded in command by Col. J. K. Lamerick. A detailed description of Ross and his regiment at the October 31, 1855 defeat at the Battle of Hungry Hill appeared in the New York Herald. At a special election held December 15, 1855, Ross was elected to represent Jackson County in the Oregon Territorial Council, to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of Dr. E. H. Cleaveland. In the general election in June 1866, he was elected to the Oregon Legislative Assembly. In 1866-7 the California and Oregon Railroad Company was formed. Colonel Ross was elected one of its directors, and the directors transferred the franchise to Ben Holladay. Ross was appointed Brigadier-General of the First Brigade of the Oregon Militia by Governor La Fayette Grover on December 2, 1872, as the Modoc War began. Ross took the field, commanding throughout the war. He participated in the principal engagements of the Modoc War, including the First Battle of the Stronghold. In 1878, he represented Jackson County in the State Senate, and was honored by being appointed Chairman of the Military Committee. He was appointed one of the investigating committee to report upon the acts of the preceding administration. Hubert Howe Bancroft, in his Oregon Biographical Sketches, remarked: > One whole night I spent with Ross at Jacksonville, writing down his > experiences; and when at early dawn my driver summoned me, I resumed my > journey under a sickening sensation from the tales of bloody butcheries in > which the gallant colonel had so gloriously participated.

He briefly served as a member of the Virginia Senate (switching allegiances from the Democratic to the Republican Party and was defeated when he ran as an Independent for the Petersburg, Virginia seat; he resigned as a result of that switch). In 1941 Muse, running as the Republican candidate for Governor of Virginia, lost overwhelmingly to Democrat Colgate Darden, a member of the state's Byrd Organization. Later, Muse lived in Manassas, Virginia, from where he opposed and chronicled the Massive Resistance crisis fostered by U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd and Richmond newspaperman James J. Kilpatrick as they fomented opposition to the United States Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education which overturned racial segregation in public schools.http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Muse_Benjamin_1898-1986J.Y. Smith, Benjamin Muse Dies at 87in Washington Post obituary, May 6, 1986 at p. B6 Early and family life Muse was born in Durham, North Carolina, on April 17, 1898. He was raised in Petersburg, Virginia and attended Trinity College (now Duke University). After his wartime service discussed below, Muse attended graduate school at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. While serving in Mexico in 1925, Muse married Beatriz de Regil (1901-1983) from Merida, Mexico in the Yucatan Peninsula. Beatriz was the daughter of Katherine Baker and Pedro de Regil, and was raised in Hacienda Uayalceh.https://benmuse.typepad.com/beatriz_de_regil_muse/katherine-baker/ They had two sons—Benjamin Muse Jr. (1927-2012) (born during his father's posting in Paris, France) and Paul Muse (of Suffolk, Virginia)--as well as daughters Katherine Furcron of Cuernavaca, Mexico, Phillipa Millard of Gainesville, Virginia and St. Augustine, Florida and Carlota Rokita of Vienna, Austria.

Military and diplomatic careers As World War I began, Muse volunteered in 1914 and served in the British Army with the King's Royal Rifle Corps. Germans captured him in 1916, but he was ultimately freed. Upon returning to the U.S., Muse studied in Washington D.C. until joining the State Department in 1920. He held various diplomatic posts in Europe and Latin America. The culmination of his fourteen years of service may have been his term as counselor to the U.S. delegation to the Seventh International Conference of American States in 1933, at which President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull declared the Good Neighbor policy and which led to the Montevideo Convention.UVA library bio After selling shoes near Petersburg and the part-time political career discussed below, in 1939, the elder Muse enlisted in the U.S. Army as World War II began. He served in the Adjutant General Corps, assigned to Washington, D.C. until 1945, and retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel. His son and namesake enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1944, and served in the Pacific, including patrols on the Yangtze River in China.http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity- memorial/obituary.aspx?n=Benjamin-Muse&lc;=7887&pid;=158593010∣=5172126 Political career Upon resigning from the Foreign Service and returning to the United States in 1934, Muse settled in Petersburg and began farming. The following year, Muse won election as a Democrat to represent the state's 8th district. However, he switched parties nine months into his term, and resigned after heavy criticism, then ran for his former seat as an independent and lost. Muse changed parties because he came to oppose President Roosevelt's New Deal. In 1941, Muse became the Republican Party's nominee for Governor of Virginia. He campaigned for repeal of the poll tax and other liberal reforms, and lost overwhelmingly in the general election (winning just 17.6% of the votes) to Colgate Darden, who had the support of the Byrd Organization and won 80.6% of the votes cast.http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:1941/year_to:1941/office_id:3 Darden later became a good friend, as well as led the University of Virginia through the Massive Resistance crisis discussed below. Writer, publisher and opponent of Massive Resistance During his World War II service in the U.S. Army, Muse, assigned to Washington, D.C., bought a farm in Manassas, Virginia (then a distant suburb). He founded and published a local newspaper, the Manassas Messenger, selling it in 1950 (it later became the Journal-Messenger) but continuing a related printing business until 1966. During the 1950s and early 1960s, Muse wrote a weekly \\"Virginia Affairs\\" column for The Washington Post. It chronicled problems resulting from racial segregation and policies of the Byrd Organization. He also criticized the NAACP for pushing for rapid school desegregation, especially in Prince Edward County. Muse also wrote about Southern affairs in The Nation and The New Republic. After both a three- judge federal panel and the Virginia Supreme Court declared most of the Stanley Plan (a package of laws designed to support Massive Resistance) unconstitutional on January 19, 1959 (birthday of Robert E. Lee and a Virginia state holiday), Muse (who considered himself a \\"fighting moderate\\" rather than a liberal) directed the Southern Leadership Project of the Southern Regional Council, an early private civil rights organization. For four years Muse toured the South urging voluntary compliance with court desegregation orders. President John F. Kennedy also appointed him to a commission to monitor racial equality in the armed forces.Washington Post obituary Muse published his first book, Virginia's Massive ResistanceBenjamin Muse, Virginia's Massive Resistance (1961) available at https://archive.org/stream/virginiasmassive013514mbp#page/n0/mode/2up in 1961, and Ten Years of Prelude (also about Massive Resistance) in 1964.

SR 142 (1923–1926) SR 142 was a state route in southeastern Ohio that existed from 1923 until 1926. The route ran from Kerr, just outside Gallipolis to Hamden. After 1926, the entire route was replaced by SR 160, a route that exists today. SR 153 (1923–1931) SR 153 was a route in Columbiana County, Ohio. The route existed from 1923 until 1931 when it became an extension of SR 45. The route ran from SR 7 in Wellsville to US 30 in West Point. SR 155 (1923–1926) SR 155 was a state route in Ohio between Sandyville and Minerva. The route was in existence from 1923 until 1926 when it was replaced by SR 80 which had been extended south. Today, SR 183 follows the entire route of the former SR 155. SR 156 SR 156 was a state highway in Muskingum County, Ohio. The route's eastern terminus had always been in Muskingum Township at SR 77 (now SR 60). At the time of its first designation in 1923, the route began east of Hanover in Licking County at SR 16. By 1930, SR 146 was extended from its former end in Zanesville to SR 16 leaving SR 156 to begin near Nashport. After being fully paved in 1946, the route would not experience any other changes until the route was deleted after 1962. Today, the road exists as Creamery Road, also known as Muskingum County Road 500. SR 157 SR 157 was a state route in the vicinity of Buckeye Lake. First designated in 1923, the route ran from the point at which SR 79 currently ends at SR 37 on the Licking–Fairfield County line west of Buckeye Lake to US 40 (originally SR 1) near Hebron. No major changes would occur to the routing until the entire designation was removed around 1959. Most of the former route within Buckeye Lake and west of the village became (and still is) SR 79 while the balance of the route outside of the village is today known as Licking County Road 489. SR 160 (1923–1926) SR 160 was a route in central Ohio that followed what is now US 42 between the cities of London and Delaware. The route existed from 1923 until 1926 when it was replaced in whole by US 42. SR 177 (1923–1926) SR 177 was a route that briefly existed in Wayne County from 1923 until 1925. The route served as a shortcut to and from Orrville and Wooster. After its deletion by 1926, the route was replaced by county roads. SR 177 (1926) SR 177 was a short-lived state route in a now former section Washington Township, Lucas County. The route started at SR 6 (Detroit Avenue) north of the Toledo city limits and traveled due north along Crabb Road and Telegraph Road to the Michigan state line. The route only existed in 1926 before it was replaced by US 24. SR 177 (1927–1932) SR 177 was a route Tuscarawas County that existed from 1927 until 1932. The began in Goshen Township at SR 259 and headed north west towards New Philadelphia. By 1933, SR 16 took over the entire length of the route and today it is designated SR 416. SR 178 SR 178 was a state highway in Richland County connecting Franklin Township at SR 13 and Plymouth at SR 61 and SR 98. First designated in 1923, the route traveled north-northwest from its southern terminus towards Ganges and Shiloh. In the area of Shiloh, the route headed in a more northwesterly direction towards Plymouth. In the center of the town, the route ended. Throughout its history, no major changes occurred to its routing. After 1959, the segment between SR 13 and Shiloh was removed from the state highway system while SR 603, which originally had its western terminus at SR 178 near Shiloh, was extended over the remainder of the route to Plymouth. The former state-maintained section of the route is now known as Richland County Road 207 (Ganges-Five Points Road). SR 180 (1923–1926) SR 180 was a short north-south state highway in Ohio that was in existence from 1923 until 1926. The route's southern terminus was in the village of Savannah at SR 60 and its northern terminus was at SR 30 (now SR 13) in Fitchville. In 1927, SR 180 was deleted when SR 6 was extended north. Today, the route is a part of US 250. SR 182 SR 182 was a state highway that existed from 1923 until about 2005. The route served as an alternate route of US 30 between Upper Sandusky and Bucyrus. From 1923 until 1969, the route stretched between Upper Sandusky at US 30N (originally SR 5) to US 30N at a point between Oceola and Bucyrus. By 1971, the route's eastern terminus was moved to SR 231 in the village of Nevada. SR 182 was removed from the state highway system between 2005 and 2007, around the time the nearby US 30 expressway was completed between Upper Sandusky and Bucyrus. SR 183 (1923–1951) SR 183 was a state route in Lucas County, at the time northwest of the city limits of Toledo. For most of its history, the route began at SR 246 (Dorr Street) near Ottawa Hills and headed due north along Secor Road. Near the Michigan state line, the route made a turn to the left onto Whiteford Center Road before ending at the border. At the time of its first designation in 1923 and 1924, SR 183 started in western Toledo, headed west on Dorr Street and then turned north onto its routing as previously described. For the next two years, the route started near Maumee and traveled north along Byrne Road to the point of its long-time southern terminus. By 1947, most of the route became co-signed with Bypass US 23-24-25. After 1951, SR 183 was deleted and most of the route became signed solely as the bypass route. Today, most of the road exists as a municipally- maintained road as Toledo annexed the surrounding land including all of the areas through which the former SR 183 ran. SR 184 (1923–1941) SR 184 was a state highway in western Wood County. The route, which existed from 1923 until 1941, was an east-west road that started at SR 65 (originally SR 110) near Grand Rapids to SR 64 east of Tontogany. After 1941, the entire route became an extension of SR 110 to Bowling Green. However, after the road of the former SR 183 was downgraded to a county highway, the road today exists as Wood County Road 184 (Kellogg Road). SR 185 (1923–1926) SR 185 was a short state route in northern Henry County that existed from 1923 until 1926. For the first three years of the route, SR 185 started just north of McClure at SR 34 and SR 65 and had its northern terminus at SR 110 near the banks of the Maumee River. For the last year of its existence, the southern terminus was moved to the center of McClure when SR 34 and SR 65 were moved to a different alignment through northern Henry County. Within one year, the route was deleted and the road SR 185 occupied became a new alignment of SR 65. SR 185 (1927–1937) SR 185 was a state route that existed from 1927 until 1937. For most of its history, the route was a connector between SR 101 south of Clyde to US 20 west of Bellevue. In 1937, SR 185 was extended west along previously unnumbered highways through Green Springs to end at SR 53 near Old Fort. This extension was short-lived as within the year, an extended SR 113 was routed over the entire route of SR 185. SR 187 (1923–1930) SR 187 was a state highway that served as a connector between Leipsic and McComb. The route existed from 1923 until 1930 when it was replaced by SR 113 as it was being extended east through the state. SR 188 (1923–1926) SR 188 was a state route in Putnam and Henry Counties in northwestern Ohio. First designated in 1923, the route started at SR 22 (now SR 15) in Greensburg Township, traveled north through Miller City and ended in downtown Holgate. This would be the routing of SR 188 throughout its three-year history, but after 1926, the entire route became a part of SR 33. Today, all of former SR 188 is the southernmost part of SR 108. SR 192 SR 192 was an route in Williams County, located in the northwest corner of Ohio. The route was designated in 1923 along the route of the former SR 456, a route first signed in 1914. SR 192 started in Bryan, traveled east southeast through Pulaski Township before turning to due east and ending at SR 191 in Springfield Township. After 1953, the route was deleted from the state highway system. When SR 192 was deleted, the road outside of the Bryan city limits became Williams County Road 456, an ode to the route number from the 1910s. SR 193 (1923–1938) SR 193 was a short connector in and around Hicksville created in 1923. The route began at the Indiana state line where the road continues west as SR 8 and traveled southeast for about to end in downtown Hicksville at SR 2 and SR 18. After 1937, the entire route became a part of SR 18 when it was moved off of the SR 2 concurrency west of the village. SR 194 (1923–1926) SR 194 was a short state highway connecting the villages of Payne and Paulding from 1923 until 1926. The route had always been an unpaved dirt road throughout its short history. After 1926, the road was demoted to a county road but in 1937, the former SR 194 became a part of the state highway system again as a part of SR 500. SR 194 (1927–1969) SR 194 was a state highway in Huron County in the vicinity of Willard. Created in 1927, it ran east from the intersection of SR 99 and Tiffin Street east of Willard through New Haven Township to end at SR 61. Around 1933, the route was extended slightly to the west to head through downtown Willard on Tiffin Street and south along Main Street to end at SR 17 (later US 224) bringing the total length of the highway to . By 1969, SR 194 (and SR 298 which itself ended at SR 194's western terminus) would be replaced by an extension of SR 103. SR 199 (1923) SR 199 was the short-lived designation for what is now SR 242 in Darke County. Numbered SR 199 in 1923 after being designated SR 464 for about nine years, the route was renumbered to SR 242 within one year of SR 199's designation. SR 200 (1923–1931) SR 200 was a state highway entirely in Darke County and in existence from 1923 until 1931. The route started at the Indiana state line in Liberty Township and traveled east through Palestine before ending at SR 121 in Neave Township. In 1932, US 36 was designated in Ohio and replaced the entire route of SR 200. SR 200 (1932–1936) SR 200 was a short spur connecting the village of Lagrange to SR 57 in the community of Belden. The route was designated in 1932 along county roads and replaced in 1936 by an extension of SR 303. SR 200 (1938) SR 200 was a short-lived alternate route of SR 3 between Medina and Parma that existed in 1938. SR 200 followed what had been SR 3 prior to 1938 while SR 3 was routed along US 42. Within one year, SR 3 moved back to its original alignment and SR 200 was therefore deleted. SR 207 (1923–1937) SR 207 was a state route in eastern Licking County. The route was created in 1923 and followed the same alignment throughout its history. SR 207 began along SR 16 just west of Hanover and traveled northeast until reaching Perryton. At that point, the route turned in a more northerly direction and ended at SR 79 in Fallsbury Township. After 1937, the entire route became a northern extension of SR 668 and remained a part of that route until 1959. Today, all of the former SR 207 outside of the Hanover village limits is a part of Licking County Road 668. SR 210 (1923–1953) SR 210 was a bypass of SR 16 in the vicinity of Coshocton. While SR 16 crossed the Muskingum River into downtown Coshocton, SR 210 traveled along the west bank of the river to end at SR 271 (now SR 541) in the community of Roscoe. The route was in existence from 1923 until 1953 when SR 16 was rerouted onto the entire length of SR 210. SR 214 SR 214 was a route in northeastern Belmont County that existed from 1923 until 1978. The route started at an intersection with US 40 in Richland Township and headed southeast. After the completion of I-70, there was an interchange with SR 214 (exit 221) within intersection with US 40. SR 214 followed the top of a ridge while traveling through Richland and Pultney Townships before starting its descent into Bellaire. Instead of taking the direct route into downtown Bellaire on Central Street, SR 214 took a more winding route in order to have an easier descent into the village. The route ended at the intersection of Central Street and Noble Street in Bellaire. At the time, SR 7 was routed along Noble north of here and Central for one block east of this point. The route had not changed its alignment during the time it was a state route. After the route was deleted from the state highway system, most of the route outside of Bellaire became Belmont County Road 214. Parts of SR 214 within downtown Bellaire became a part of the 1979 extension of SR 149 into Bellaire though SR 149 has since moved to a different alignment south of the village. Since the redesignation of the road to CR 241, an interchange with I-470 (exit 3) opened. SR 219 (1923–1924) SR 219 was a short-lived alternate route to SR 7 in southern Rome Township, Lawrence County. The route existed from 1923 until 1924 before being replaced by an eastern extension of SR 243. Today, the route is no longer a part of the state highway system; SR 243 was truncated its intersection with SR 7 between Chesapeake and Proctorville and SR 7 was moved onto a bypass of the area.

Myrmecia pyriformis belongs to the genus Myrmecia. It is abundant in many major cities of Australia, but mostly spotted in the eastern states. The species is of a similar appearance to the Myrmecia forficata. Sizes of the Myrmecia pyriformis range around long. Female workers can grow as large as while males only grow to long. Mandibles and most other features are dark red. Thoraxes are sometimes blackish-brown. Myrmecia pryformis is known to survive without a queen.Dietemann V., Peeters, C, & Hölldobler, B. 2004 \\"Gamergates in the Australian ant subfamily Myrmeciinae\\" Naturwissenschaften 91(9):432-435 While some species of Myrmecia possess the gamergates, the female workers of Myrmecia pyriformis are also able to reproduce. A colony of the genus was collected in 1998 without a queen, but the colony continued producing workers for the next three years. Guinness World Records listed Myrmecia pyriformis as the world's most dangerous ant. Taxonomy Myrmecia pyriformis was first described by British entomologist Frederick Smith in his 1858 publication Catalogue of hymenopterous insects in the collection of the British Museum part VI, based on a syntype worker, queen and male collected from Melbourne and the Hunter River. The specimens are currently housed in Natural History Museum in London. Smith notes that M. pyriformis is very similar in appearance to M. forficata, though he comments all sexes are larger, the male is strikingly distinct and the head is more square shaped and not narrowed from the back end. Smith also described M. sanguinea from Tasmania in the same publication he described M. pyriformis, now treated as a junior synonym. Prior to this, however, M. sanguinea was thought to be a synonym of M. vindex. Due to its similar appearance to M. forficata, Auguste Forel believed M. pyriformis was a subspecies, rather than a full species. M. pyriformis was never reassigned as a subspecies; instead, it is still regarded as a full species in the genus Myrmecia. In 1911, Carlo Emery established seven species groups, placing M. pyriformis in the M. forficata species group. This placement was long accepted until a 1991 review of the species groups was published and moved the species to the M. cephalotes species group instead. This placement, however, was short lived and the ant was placed in the M. gulosa species group one month after it was placed in the M. cephalotes species group. M. pyriformis is commonly known as the black bull-ant, brown bulldog ant or the inch ant, which references the colour and notably large size of the ant. Description M. pyriformis is similar to M. forficata, but there are several characteristics that can distinguish the two species from each other. M. pyriformis is typically larger, the colour is darker and the head and alitrunk (a segment of the body where the wings are attached) are either dark reddish-brown or blackish-brown. The mandibles are broader, the clypeus is covered in hair and the postpetiole bears very short hair that are either greyish or brown.

The road begins southeast from US 90 in Argyle in concurrency with CR 183 from US 90 which curves to the northeast. This segment of CR 10A is named Old Highway 90, and at first runs along the north side of the CSX P&A; Subdivision. This alignment is short- lived though as it approaches a fork in the road where CR 183 heads to the southeast and has its own fork in the road with Railroad Avenue before crossing the tracks, while CR 10A curves to the northeast. The first intersection it encounters along this trajectory is Fire Department Avenue, which as appropriately named leads to the Argyle Volunteer Fire Department. A second intersection with another local street was eliminated when the fire house on the previous street was expanded. CR 10A does not terminate at US 90, although the intersection with the road is split into a pair of 90 degree intersections, the second of which removes the name \\"Old Spanish Trail\\" from US 90 as it continues northeast before both the old and \\"new\\" versions of US 90 cross the Walton-Holmes County Line. The road maintains the name \\"Old Spanish Trail\\" as it enters Holmes County from the Walton-Holmes County Line, briefly turning north and south on the east side of that border only to curve briefly to the east after one power line right-of-way where it then crosses a second power line right-of-way before turning northeast, and winding through the woods of southwestern Holmes County. Just after a bridge over Bridge Creek, the road curves towards the east before the intersection of County Road 183A, where it encounters a private home that was a former gas station. From there, the road turns southeast, then it crosses over Bridge Creek again, and later over another bridge over Hog Creek, just northwest of the intersection with County Road 81A, which is not a suffixed route of SR 81. Continuing southeast, the road runs through more woods interrupted by two parcels of farmland on the south side, obstructed by a line of trees with a grass road between the two farms, then crosses the first power line right-of-way the it went under when it entered Holmes County. After both intersections with the two legs of Holly Road, the road briefly turns straight east and then curves back to the southeast. Avoiding a fork in the road, CR 10A makes a sharp right turn to end at US 90 and the Baker Manning Loop. The second segment begins in eastern Ponce De Leon at US 90 east of Main Street. The first name of this segment is Old US 90, and runs northeast of US 90 from there until it reaches Oak Grove Church Road, then turns southwest until it terminates at US 90 in rural western Holmes County. FDOT maps, however suggest that the route extends past Oak Grove Church Road, and runs along the P&A; Subdivision until that railroad line runs parallel to the north side of US 90 more than halfway between Oak Grove Church Road and Valee Road. It's possible that this is an abandoned segment of the road. =Jackson County= County Road 10A also exists in two different segments in Jackson County, one in the Marianna area and the other in Sneads. The first one is Old Cottondale Road which begins at US 90 west of Marianna, beginning southeast from US 90, and then curving straight east and west just before the intersection with Heritage Road, only to curve southeast again at a power sub-station just before the intersection with Moneyham Road. CR 10A doesn't truly enter the city limits until it approaches the headquarters of Jackson County Transportation on the northwest corner of Sunrise Drive. After this intersection, the road passes by the Apostolic Life United United Pentecostal Church turns straight east and west again. A few blocks after this it encounters its one major intersection other than its termini, State Road 276(Pennsylvania Avenue) at a blinker light intersection. East of there, the road takes a dip into the woods and has one intersection with Edenfield Street before a fork in the road for a former segment named Milton Avenue, and then a connecting spur named Hanson Street. Four blocks after this, it encounters a three-way stop intersection with Orange Street and then one intersection with a residential street before it crosses the P&A; Subdivision next to a dry river bed and ends at US 90. The second segment begins on US 90 at the western edge of Sneads as Keevers Road. It runs southeast and has intersections with two dirt roads, one of which has an actual name (Gay Avenue) before moving onto the Old Spanish Trail, which was a separate local street since the intersection with State Road 71 east of Marianna. Five blocks after this it intersects a street named River Road, which leads to CR 271 and almost several blocks later intersects CR 286(Gloster Avenue). After CR 286, the road runs along the north side of the P&A; Subdivision, across from Sneads High School. The road moves away from the tracks after the intersection with Third Avenue. At Legion Road, the road becomes a one-way street that ends just west of a dirt road named Pete's Way. Both segments serve as the east end of County Road 10A. The former right-of- way for the Old Spanish Trail runs along the south side of US 90 as it crosses Pete's Way and then Barannie Lane just before it ends. =Suwannee County= County Road 10A exists in two segments in Suwannee County as well. The first is in Live Oak and the second is in Wellborn. The Live Oak segment begins as Helvenston Street Southeast at US 129 rather than at US 90. Within the city, most of the area surrounding the route is purely residential, except on the northwest and northeast corners of White Avenue, and other random locations. Drivers know that they're about to leave the city when they see a storage facility on the southwest corner of Railroad Avenue, and the route veers slightly to the left. The railroad for which the cross street was named can be found east of the street at an abandoned Atlantic Coast Line Railroad crossing that's closer to a dirt road named 109th Street. A dirt road and former segment of the road named 103rd Drive veers off to the right at an at-grade interchange where this segment of County Road 10A ends at US 90 just west of the intersection of County Road 49. 103rd Drive runs south of CR 10A and then south of US 90 for one block. The Wellborn segment begins on the north side of US 90. Much of the road is a block south of the CSX Tallahassee Subdivision (Eighth Avenue is directly on the south side of those tracks). Aside from Low Lake Road at the Wellborn Baptist Church property, most intersections along the road are paper roads and dirt roads leading to Eighth Avenue until it reaches County Road 137, a south-to-north county road spanning from US 27 in Hildreth through I-10 at Exit 292 to SR 136 in Poucher's Corner. The road continues for five more blocks along the same trajectory, and after Third Avenue, the road begins to curve southeast, primarily east of Wellborn Lake. By the time it reaches the intersection of 31st Road, CR 10A gains the name Odigo Road, momentarily running south then curves more easterly again at 29th Road before finally ends at US 90 just west of the Suwannee-Columbia County Line. State Road 13 Before 1945, State Road 13 was posted from Cedar Key to Fernandina Beach via State Road 24 (Cedar Key to Waldo), U. S. Route 301 (Waldo to Callahan) and State Road 200 (Callahan to Fernandina Beach). In the early 1950s, the State Road Department acquired part of the Kissimmee Valley Line of the Florida East Coast Railway in Orange and Seminole Counties for highway purposes. The proposed state road was numbered as an extension of the existing State Road 13. Most of the road was never built, but a piece through Bithlo was given to Orange County and is now County Road 13. The designation does not appear on county road shields, but is the only street name for the road. State Road 14 Before 1945, Florida State Road 14 was posted between U. S. Route 19 in Wilcox and U. S. Route 1 in St. Augustine via State Road 26 (Wilcox to Gainesville), State Road 20 (Gainesville to East Palatka) and State Road 207 (East Palatka to St. Augustine). State Road 32 State Road 32 was a short northerly bypass of Bronson, linking US 27 Alt. to SR 24 at the north city limits. State Road 32B ran south to SR 24 in Bronson along Marshburn Drive. Both routes are now county roads with the same numbers. State Road 42 State Road 42, now County Road 42, connected Pedro to Crows Bluff via Weirsdale and Altoona. The road is considered by some to be a popular motorcycling tourist drive.County Route 42 - Florida (MotorcycleRoads.US) State Road 48 State Road 67 Junction FL-67 sign remaining on FH-13. State Road 67, now County Road 67, crossed the Apalachicola National Forest on its way from US 98 in Carrabelle to Telogia and SR 12 (now CR 12) south of Bristol. Two segments of State Road 67A are now County Road 67A. One is located on Ryan Drive and Three Rivers Road in Carrabelle, connecting US 98 and CR 67 west of downtown. No signs are posted. The other is in Liberty County and bypasses Telogia to the northeast, shortening the distance between CR 67 and SR 65 south of Hosford. Several other pieces in and near Bristol no longer carry the 67A designation. State Road 74 State Road 74 existed in several sections. The most important one connected US 17 northeast of Punta Gorda with SR 29 south of Palmdale. Another stretched west from SR 78 in Lakeport, and was planned to continue to US 27 north of Palmdale.FDOT right of way map, section 05503-2601 These two segments are now County Road 74. A third piece of State Road 74 in Palm Beach County was renumbered State Road 786. State Road 92 State Road 92, now County Road 92, spurred southwest from US 41 (Tamiami Trail) at Royal Palm Hammock to Marco Island. A short branch to Goodland was originally numbered State Road 92A,General Highway Map, Collier County, April 1966, reprinted January 1973/July 1975: sheet 1, sheet 2 but became SR 892 in the mid-1970sGeneral Highway Map, Collier County, April 1966, reprinted January 1976 and now has become County Road 892.

The southern terminus is at the intersection with Mobile Highway (US 90/SR 10A) and Belulah Avenue (CR 99 south), while the northern terminus is at the intersection of Isaacs Lane and Belulah Avenue (CR 99 north). History SR 99 was originally one continuous route, defined from US 90 Alt. north to Walnut Hill, then west on current SR 99A to Pineville and back north to the Alabama state line near Nokomis. It was later cut back to run only from Barrineau Park to Walnut Hill, and was subsequently extended north to Alabama, replacing State Road 380. The original alignment south of Muscogee was restored at some point, while Muscogee to Barrineau Park (with a different alignment at the Muscogee end) became a second segment of SR 97 (now CR 97), and Walnut Hill to Pineville became part of SR 99A. The road from Pineville north never received a number after SR 99 was removed from it. In 2019, the Florida Department of Transportation and Escambia County signed a road swap agreement that would return State Road 99 to the state highway system, bringing back the portion running on Beulah Road from US 90 to Isaacs Lane, with plans to study a new corridor to extend SR 99 to US 29.

Career After winning a contest in 1942 on CX 36 Radio Centenario, she received a three-month contract. She then joined a women's orchestra, “Las Golondrinas”, led by Teresita Añón, which featured tangos, milongas and waltzes in its songbook. They toured the south of Brazil, up to Porto Alegre. A subsequent tour took the orchestra to a nightclub in São Paulo named Okey. Back in Montevideo, they performed at the Palacio Salvo's Café Palace. Miranda performed with Francisco Reinares, Emilio Pellejero, Roberto Luratti before making her first recording, which was with Juan Cao. Thereafter, she sang as a duo with Alberto Bianchi. By 1948, she appeared at the Hotel Rambla with the Emilio Pellejero Orchestra. In 1952, she recorded the song Maula which became a hit, and was aired daily on the radio stations. In August 1955, she arrived in Buenos Aires to expand her artistic opportunities, aided by the journalist Augusto Bonardo, director of Montevideo's Radio El Espectador. At Radio Centenario, she recorded with the Donato Racciati orchestra for Sondor and with Graciano Gómez for Odeon Records. Initially, she recorded fourteen songs.

A gift for Findlay City School District from Otto D. Donnell, Donnell Stadium was the original dream of J.C. Donnell, president of the Ohio Oil Company. His presentation of the site where the J.C. Donnell Middle School now stands was the first step in his dream. On October 27, 1928, Donnell Stadium was dedicated and the deed to the stadium handed over to the Findlay Board of Education. Stadium named in honor of J.C. Donnell, with a plaque in memoriam. Over 80 years ago, James C. Donnell's dream of providing a place in Findlay where ‘games of youth’ could be conducted was realized by the citizens of Findlay. Donnell, son of James C. Donnell, and then president of The Ohio Oil Company, the forerunner of today's Marathon Oil Company stood before a crowd of over 2,000 people and said, “We have endeavored to the best of our ability to carry out the plans in accordance with the wishes of the originator of this idea, and our only regret is that he was not spared to be present at the dedication and to share the happiness of this occasion.” Donnell's, untimely death in 1927, one year prior to the completion and dedication, prevented him from being a part of these ceremonies. Years earlier, however, Donnell resolved to give the public schools in Findlay an athletic field. His gift of the site where Donnell Middle School currently sits was his first step toward his goal. Donnell's son, Otto and grandsons James C. (II), John R., and Otto D. (Jr.), carried his goal to completion after his death. A graduate of Case Institute of Technology (now part of Case Western Reserve University), O.D. Donnell called on former classmates to serve as architects for the stadium project and drive it through execution. It attracted attention statewide, partly because of its unique physical structure for the times. And the fact it was constructed and given to the Findlay City Schools at no cost was quite unusual in that era. Findlay embarked in 1928 on a growing athletic program with no expense to the taxpayer, an envy of many communities throughout the state of Ohio. O.D. Donnell continued his guidance and financial support for improvements to the stadium from 1928 to 1936, donating tennis courts to the schools in 1928, followed by the combination wading pool and skating rink in 1930. The largest electronic scoreboard in Ohio was also installed in 1930, along with a public address system. Lights were added and the first night game was played in 1930 with the Trojans defeating Bowling Green, 13–0. In 1936 O.D. Donnell established the “Donnell Foundation” to provide ongoing financial support for maintenance and improvements to the stadium and adjacent recreational areas. Donnell Stadium is still operational where it continues to host football games and other events. Currently, the venue holds numerous attendance records at OHSAA sponsored playoff games. FieldTurf renovation FieldTurf was added in 2007. The millions of fibers on the field utilize a silica sand/cryogenic- rubber infill over 9 lbs per square foot (720,000 pounds across the field), creating an even more natural surface. Numerous ridges run from top to bottom alongside each face of the fiber to eliminate breaking points in each artificial grass blade, holding fibers in their place, eliminating wrinkles, and maintaining the integrity of the turf. The resiliency of the fiber cross creates a more durable fiber while on a vertical access so they stay upright. The artificial playing surface is coated with an advanced hydrological system to combat head on the synthetic surface. Slow released evaporative cooling reduces the temperature not he blades while the ridges on the artificial blades of grass refract sunlight (heat). Radiation from the infill evaporates the moisture creating a cooling effect Completing the installation of the surface was a drainage system. Since installation, rain outs at Donnell Stadium have not occurred. As opposed to traditional hole punctured artificial playing surface drainage systems, custom rows are integrated to allow 40% more drainage which is certified to drain 40.14 inches of water per hour. Scoreboard & Video Board renovation For the 2012 season, a new scoreboard by Fair Play Scoreboards and video board by Trans-Lux were added. It is capable of displaying a host of multimedia from the internet, including live TV, and is able to display over 280 million colors. New Scoring & Video Super- system at Donnell Stadium Ribbon Board Installed Summer 2012 The largest video board for a high school stadium in the state is equipped with a video room onsite to cut to multiple game camera angles, and instant replays (with multiple angles); in addition, a ribbon full matrix board (the first for a high school facility in the nation) lines the press box separating the two levels capable of showing game, player, and statistical information. FieldTurf renovation In 2007, Donnell Stadium's Kentucky Bluegrass playing surface was removed for installation of an artificial playing surface: FieldTurf. The color palette of the turf was a nod toward Findlay High School compared to the stadium's secondary tenant, the University of Findlay. A block 'F' at the fifty-yard line, in shaded white with a yellow and blue outline sat at the midpoint of the surface. The end zones both read 'Findlay' in white lettering with a yellow and blue shadow. After eight years of use, the FieldTurf surface was removed to begin the installation of a newer, more updated version of the FieldTurf product. The synthetic playing field uses FieldTurf's top end Classic HD technology, the same playing surface used by the majority of NFL stadiums. The three layer infill system allows for optimal player safety, while delivering a softer touch and reduced heat mapping. Using polymer process geometry, the turf is 14% less abrasive, reduces water splash by 62%, and is a 130 micron improvement over the previous surface's depth. The top layer consists of cryogenic rubber with the middle being a combination of cryogenic rubber and a silica sand mix. Silica sand fills the third layer which gives added grip to cleats as they dig into the surface. New with the revised version on the field, each ten-yard line stripe alternates between a light shade of green and a dark shade of green. Before each game a specifically designed tractor 'pushes' the blades one way or another to allow the sunlight to amplify the difference in shading. The 50-yard line graphic and end zone art remain constant with the 2007 installation. Donnell Stadium is the only high school in the nation to replace its surface in just seven years despite having no issues with the prior surface; this was strictly an upgrade that focused on enhanced player safety, cosmetic differentiation, and upgraded playing surface technology. The Foundation continues to provide support for these facilities.

He was an officer of the Italian Royal Navy, but retired to dedicate himself to painting.La rivoluzione napoletana del 1799: illustrata con ritratti, vedute, autografi, ed altro documenti. album curated by B. Croce, G. Ceci, M. D'Ayala, and S. Di Giacomo, 1899, page 59. Life and career Cercone was born in Messina on 21 November, 1850. He was the son of Francesco Cercone and his wife, Celeste Irene. He joined the navy at a very young age and rose to the level of lieutenant in 1878. While at sea, during the Battle of Lissa (1866), he painted the Governolo. His career took him to the West Indies where he began collecting specimens of marine flora and fauna for the \\"Aquarium\\" station in Naples. He worked as a researcher at the \\"Aquarium\\" 1883 and 1884 where he found that he could devote himself more fully to painting. He left active service in the Navy in 1888 but went into the Naval Reserve, where he was promoted to a rocket captain two years later.

Almost all of his paintings remain in Naples and the region. His paintings have clear references to the Neapolitan artistic culture of the late nineteenth century, and in particular to Domenico Morelli, which whom he perhaps also had a more direct relationship. In 1880, he produced nine paintings with Arabic figures. Following that, he concentrated on Oriental themes which were very popular with the bourgeois society of the time. Cercone's works are difficult to locate since most of them are in private collections. Cercone died at Sorrento on 12 September, 1896.

Serving as a lower priced version of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, the Note 3 Neo was designed to have the same lighter, more upscale design than previous iterations of the Galaxy series (with a plastic leather backing and faux metallic bezel) first supported by its bigger sibling, and to expand upon the stylus and multi- tasking oriented functionality in its software, which includes the new navigation wheel for pen-enabled apps, along with pop-up apps and expanded multi-window functionality.  Specifications  = Hardware = The Galaxy Note 3 Neo's design was intended to carry the same upscale, \\"premium\\" look with the new generation of Samsung devices. Although it carries a similarly polycarbonate-oriented design to other recent Samsung devices, the Galaxy Note 3 Neo has a faux metallic bezel and a rear cover made of plastic leather with faux stitching. With a thickness of , it is slightly thinner than the Galaxy Note II, and is also slightly lighter. Two LTE versions of the Galaxy Note 3 Neo (including one Duos 3G model) uses a 1.6 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 400 chip, i.e., the SM-N7509V, SM-N7506V and SM-N7502 (Duos 3G). Several Korean versions use 2.26 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 chip called SM-N750K, SM-N750L and SM-N750S. The other versions, including the international 3G models and some 4G LTE models, use a hexa-core Exynos 5260, consisting of two 1.7 GHz Cortex-A15 cores and four 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7 cores, i.e., SM-N7507, SM-N7500Q, SM-N7505L, SM-N7505, SM-N750.

It is one of a number of New Zealand Metrosideros species which live out their lives as vines, unlike the northern rata (M.robusta), which generally begins as a hemi-epiphyte before growing into a huge tree. It grows to around 6 metres in height and bears clusters of pink or white flowers. It is unusual amongst New Zealand's metrosideros species in that its branches display a weeping habit, forming a 'hanging curtain' appearance. This behaviour is uncommon in New Zealand native plants. The name commemorates William Colenso, an early Cornish Christian missionary who was one of the great characters of New Zealand botany. Description The flowers of Colenso's rātā are either white or pale pink, and flowering is usually from November until January. Foliage is a dark green colour, with new years growth appearing in a contrasting lighter green. It is usual to find the vine form of rātā climbing up other forest trees, however Colenso's rātā is also partial to limestone cliff faces where it can climb cliffs relatively undisturbed. It is found within lowland forest as far south as Greymouth and Kaikoura.  Conservation As of 2012, Metrosideros colensoi is not regarded as threatened.  Cultivation Metrosideros colensoi is a notable plant in cultivation, but considerably undervalued. However, it is in several ways superior to more commonly grown species, such as Metrosideros carminea, on account of the ordered appearance of its growth form, and the 'movement' conveyed by its downward arching branches.

Its history can be traced back to 1887. The Mimico Correctional Centre is one of several facilities operated by the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services and was located at 130 Horner Avenue in the district of Etobicoke which is now a part of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The facility was closed in 2011 and demolished to make room for the new Toronto South Detention Centre which opened in 2014. Image:Mimico - NW perimeter looking SE.jpgNW perimeter looking SE Image:Mimico - SW perimeter looking NE.jpgSW perimeter looking NE Image:Industrial Buildings as seen from South Perimeter.jpgIndustrial buildings prior to being demolished to make way for the new detention centre  History  ;1887 The Mimico Correctional Centre began its history as the Victoria Industrial School for Boys, which opened on May 16 in the town of Mimico, Ontario (just west of Toronto). Headed by Superintendent W.J. Hendrie. The school (essentially a juvenile reformatory) emphasized child rescue, reform through character development, moral and academic education, and vocational training. The opening ceremonies were officiated by Lord Lansdowne, the Governor General of Canada. The first boy was registered at the school on June 14. At its peak, the school consisted of the following: > * Six 'Cottages' (3 or 4 storey Victorian houses) * Hospital * Skating rink > * Farm with greenhouses * School with assembly hall * Gymnasium with indoor > swimming pool * Workshops * Administration building The school received 'students', aged from under 10 through 14 years, through the Toronto School Board Truancy Department. Funding was provided by the province, municipality, and parental-fees (contributed \\"in proportion to their means\\"). The daily routine at the school consisted of 4.5 hours of work and 3.5 hours of school/drill. The typical daily routine was as follows: > 06:30 Rise and Wash > 07:00 Morning Prayers > 07:30 Breakfast > 08:00 Playground > 08:30 Work > 10:30 Playground > 11:00 Work > 12:00 Cottage > 12:30 Dinner > 13:00 Playground > 13:30 Work > 15:00 Playground > 15:30 School > 18:30 Tea > 19:00 Cottage (Winter) > 20:45 Bed (Winter) > 19:00 Playground (Summer) > 20:00 Cottage (Summer) > 21:00 Bed (Summer) The school was based on 'the family plan' where boys lived in 'cottages' with a matron, who acted as mother, and a guard, who acted as father. The guards were actually skilled tradesmen who also supervised the boys at work. Some of the trades taught to the boys included carpentry, tailoring, printing, mechanics, and husbandry. The boys also performed work in the kitchen, laundry, and assisted the matrons with the housekeeping. The following is an excerpt from Superintendent Hendrie's first annual report: > It seemed a curious undertaking to erect a school for these waifs without > bar or cell or hardly a whip, but the lads appear to have dropped into the > groove at once, there having been but three attempts to escape. This school > differs from a reformatory in that it is in no sense a prison, and the boys > are not sent down as criminals, neither are they turned loose upon the world > at the expiration of a fixed term, but are apprenticed to some trusty farmer > or mechanic... Poor 'bags of bones', found in a deplorable state, have > acquired the home feeling and habits of industry and obedience in the kindly > atmosphere of the School. Violence was regularly used to discipline boys at the school. This included striking boys with straps, handcuffing, and bread-and-water diets. This may have been partly influenced by the fact that the school was governed by a private board of governors instead of the directly by the Board of Education for Toronto. ;1913 The Ontario Government found clay and shale deposits on land it owned in Mimico providing a natural source of building materials for the Government's own needs, it was quickly exploited, and the Toronto Brick and Tile Company was built. This brickyard was a satellite camp run by the Toronto Central Prison (built in 1874), an adult-male institution located at King Street and Strachan Avenue in Parkdale, a section of Toronto. The plant could produce over two million bricks a year for government use. ;1915 The Toronto Central Prison closed and the newly built Ontario Reformatory-Guelph - known today as the Guelph Correctional Centre - assumed responsibility for the brickyard. ;1927 The Victoria Industrial School became known as the Mimico Reform School. ;1928 The site of the Toronto Central Prison brickyard became a reformatory. ;1935 The Mimico Reform School was closed. Following the closing of Penetang (another reform school), the school had become a dumping ground for more \\"hardened boys\\", and with the increase in population, the rehabilitative success decreased sharply. In December 1934, the Ontario public secretary ordered it closed amid sensational public accusations that the school was a \\"barbarous and antiquated\\" institution. Remaining students were transferred to the Bowmanville Training School. The Reform School and adjacent property were merged with the Mimico out-camp for the Ontario Reformatory-Guelph. The Toronto Brick & Tile Company became known as the Ontario Brick & Tile Company and redesignated as the Ontario Reformatory-Mimico. ;1936 The Ontario Reformatory-Mimico became autonomous from the Guelph reformatory. ;World War II The site was used as a POW camp (known as Camp 22) for German prisoners, many of whom were Merchant-marines and U-boat crewmen. Mimico was just one of many such camps spread across Ontario and Canada. The prisoners at Mimico were housed in huts and fed in the main dormitory building. ;1946 The Province of Ontario formed the Department of Reform Institutions overseeing about 10 institutions. ;1951 The Alex G. Brown Memorial Clinic opened on site in the old 'Beverly Jones Cottage' (left over from the Victoria Industrial School). The clinic provided treatment for drug and alcohol addiction. Ontario Reformatory-Mimico occupied . On the property were 51 dairy cows, 362 pigs and poultry. ;1952 Buildings 1, 2, 3, and 4 were built (construction began 1948). The buildings were connected with canopied walkways that extended south to the dining-hall/old administration building. Steam-pipes ran under the walkways from the boiler-house to heat the four new buildings and as a result, the walkways were almost always clear of ice and snow in the winter. Building 2, as an annex of the Alex G. Brown Clinic, was used to house sexual deviates, screened at the Ontario Reformatory-Millbrook. ;1961 New boiler- house built (now used by maintenance as workshops). ;1962 New administration building added. ;1967 was sold to the Borough of Etobicoke and rezoned for industrial use. ;1968 (January) The Department of Reform Institutions became known as the Department of Correctional Services and the provincial government took over control of the more than 50 county and district jails. The treatment of sex offenders was moved from the Alex G. Brown Clinic to the Ontario Hospital. Industry at Mimico showed an annual output of 275,000 bricks; 12 tons of tile; 4829 slippers; 700 boot/shoe repairs; 662 picnic tables; 449 rolls of snow fence; as well as a number of fireplace grills and flag-poles. The inmate capacity was 350 in the reformatory, 108 in the Alex G. Brown Clinic and 30 at Camp Hillsdale (a minimum-security forestry camp). ;1969 Ontario Brick and Tile Company was closed following pressure from outside labour unions that argued that the plant was taking jobs from their members. 1972 Department of Correctional Services became known as the Ministry of Correctional Services. For the first time, females were allowed to work as Correctional Officers; They had previously been known as Matrons and restricted to working with female inmates or juvenile offenders. Ontario Reformatory-Mimico became the Mimico Correctional Centre. 1973 The Alex G. Brown Clinic was moved to the Ontario Correctional Institute. The part of the property that was formally the Victoria Industrial School for Boys was sold to the Borough of Etobicoke (currently the site of former Toronto Police 21 Division and Ourland Park). 1975 Mimico Correctional Centre was 'closed' with plans to move all staff and inmates to the Maplehurst Correctional Centre. The institution was cleared of inmates and only a handful of staff remained when it was decided that Mimico should be 're-opened'. The following is an excerpt from an article in the Correctional Update, an internal periodical. The article, written in February 1975, reported on the impending closure of Mimico: > One man who remembers some of the by-gone days at Mimico is Harry Woollcombe > who, at 78, works as a delivery man for a flower shop. He has also been a > taxi driver since leaving the Ministry in 1956 after 35 years service, 29 of > them at Mimico. The first six years he worked at Burwash where his annual > salary was $1,125 for an 11-hour day shift and 13 hours on night duty, with > no overtime. > > In 1927, he went to Mimico in response to an urgent request from > Superintendent Jim Elliott, a friend who needed a records clerk and wanted > Harry for the job. He was delighted with his starting salary of $1,400 at > Mimico. \\"I thought it was great to be making that much money,\\" he recalls. > > Even though he didn't particularly like the job - \\"I wasn't cut out to be a > clerk\\" - Harry stuck with it for several years before transferring to the > custodial staff. > > When the Second World War began, Harry joined a Toronto militia unit so he > could stay at Mimico, which was being turned into an internment camp for > German prisoners. He was assigned to a special train unit that travelled > around the country and picked up prisoners for Mimico. > > \\"The German prisoners would question us extensively about the towns we > passed and our destination. They recorded everything in notebooks, I > suspect, so they could later make maps.\\" > > After the war, Harry was promoted to Sergeant at Mimico and was paid > $1,800. One of his most vivid memories is of a dramatic and fatal escape > attempt. Two inmates overpowered several staff members and got possession of > a set of keys. > > The Day Sergeant, who lived in a nearby room where guns were also stored, > heard the scuffle and entered the hall carrying a pistol. He ordered the men > to stop, but when he was attacked, he fired, killing one of them. > > Harry also recalls being involved in a riot at the institution one > Christmas Eve when some inmate horseplay resulted in chairs and tables being > thrown. > > \\"Being the senior officer on duty, I went into the rest area, pulled out a > pad and began to record the names of all inmates I recognized. Soon the > fighting stopped and the inmates turned to watch me. I simply turned and > left; there was no more trouble.\\" > > The death knell for Mimico as a large farming operation was sounded in 1967 > when were sold to the Borough of Etobicoke for an industrial park. And the > rest of the property is expected to go for similar use when the Ministry > moves out this summer. The dining hall (formerly the main dormitory building prior to 1948) behind the administration building was torn down and replaced with a dining hall in the basement of Building 2. 1976 Buildings 5 and 6 were built but remained closed. 1981 Buildings 5 and 6 were opened and used to house Intermittent Temporary Absence (day-pass) and intermittent (sentence served on weekends) inmates. 1982 Mimico Correctional Centre was reclassified from minimum- security to medium-security and the perimeter fencing increased from ten feet to twenty-one feet. 1986 Payphones were installed in the inmate dormitories, allowing inmates to place collect-calls. 1988 Building 2 was converted to a 136-bed, medium-security remand unit. 1989 Segregation cells (4) in the basement of Building 1 were closed and replaced with a ten-cell unit at the rear of the building. 1991 The inmate dining hall and kitchen in the basement of Building 2 were closed and replaced with the newly completed 320-seat dining hall. I.T.A. program was moved completely out of the institution to Community Resource Centres (Halfway-houses). 1993 Ministry of Correctional Services became the Ministry of the Solicitor General and Correctional Services. Five new cells were opened in the basement of Building 1 in place of the Immigration Dorm (formerly used as a medical isolation dorm when AIDS began to show up in the inmate population). 1994 Mimico Detention Centre was opened for maximum-security remand inmates and Building 2 was closed for renovations. Mimico Correctional Centre became the Mimico Correctional Complex. 1996 The I.T.A. program was moved back into Mimico after the Ministry closed all C.R.C.'s. (February) Correctional Officers and support staff went on strike for 5 weeks in a bid to improve job security and increase wages that had not kept pace with inflation in over 12 years. 1997 Renovations and staff training began for the conversion of the detention centre (Buildings 2 and 7) into the Toronto Youth Assessment Centre (TYAC). 1998 (January) The Toronto Youth Assessment Centre opened as a separate institution. Mimico Correctional Complex was once again the Mimico Correctional Centre. 1999 (June) The Ministry of the Solicitor General and Correctional Services was divided again into two separate ministries; The Ministry of the Solicitor General and the Ministry of Correctional Services. 2002 The Ministry of the Solicitor General and the Ministry of Correctional Services merged again to become the Ministry of Public Safety and Security. 2003 (January) All but a few regular inmates were transferred out to other correctional centres and Mimico became an Intermittent Inmate facility. Intermittent inmates serve their sentences in instalments, typically on weekends and remain at large in the community the remainder of the time. Initially, the facility was to become a branch of the Toronto Jail and renamed the Toronto Jail Intermittent Facility, but the staff at Mimico rallied successfully to maintain autonomy. (November) The Ministry of Public Safety and Security was renamed to the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services. 2004 The Toronto Youth Assessment Centre was shut down amidst controversy surrounding the conditions of the facility. The Ontario Government issued this press release: > March 8, 2004 > > McGuinty Government Closing Toronto Youth Assessment Centre > > Queen's Park — The McGuinty government today announced plans to close the > Toronto Youth Assessment Centre by a target date of June 30. > > \\"I've visited the facility and it is totally unsuitable for youth in > conflict with the law,\\" said Monte Kwinter, Minister of Community Safety and > Correctional Services. \\"Since then, I have made it a priority to close the > centre. We are now following through on that commitment.\\" > > During the past few months, the Ministry of Community Safety and > Correctional Services has taken a number of steps to reduce the number of > youth at the facility, as part of its commitment to closing the centre. > Approximately 50 youth are currently at the secure-detention centre. They > will be relocated to other youth facilities that are appropriate to their > program needs, as an interim measure. > > \\"This government will continue to work to ensure that youth in the > province's custody are treated in a humane, safe and secure way,\\" Kwinter > added. \\"By making the decision to close the centre, we are bringing real, > positive change to Ontario's youth.\\" > > \\"Youth in conflict with the law must be held accountable for their actions > and be dealt with firmly, with a rehabilitative focus,\\" said Dr. Marie > Bountrogianni, Minister of Children's Services. > > Since 1998, the centre, which is located at the Mimico Correctional Centre > in Etobicoke, has been used as a temporary location to hold youth, age 16 or > 17 at the time of their offence, either in detention or serving custodial > sentences. The McGuinty government is committed to meaningful rehabilitation > for youth in conflict with the law, to help build strong, safe and vital > communities in Ontario. 2008 On May 9, the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services announces plans to build a new, larger correctional centre on the site of the Mimico Correctional Centre which will replace Mimico, the Toronto Jail, and the Toronto West Detention Centre. 2011 Mimico Correctional Centre closed on December 5, 2011. Phase 1 of the new facility, the 320 bed Toronto Intermittent Centre is completed and beings accepting prisoners on December 9, 2011. 2012 Mimico Correctional Centre demolished to make room for Phase 2 of the Toronto South Detention Centre which is completed in November. 2014 Toronto South Detention Centre (Phase 2) officially opens on January 29, 2014.

Trained as a lawyer at Harvard College, Loud worked at the Union National Bank in Weymouth, Massachusetts as a cashier. He was also active in his community as a member of his church, a trustee of many local organizations, and as a member of local historical societies. Loud invented and obtained a patent for what is considered to be the first ballpoint pen in 1888; however his invention was not commercialized and the patent would eventually lapse. The modern ballpoint pen would be patented later in 1938 by László Bíró, 22 years after Loud's death. Early life and career Loud was born in Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1844, the son of John White Loud and Sarah Humphrey Blanchard. He attended school in Weymouth, graduating from Weymouth High School, and later attended Harvard College, graduating from the latter in law in the class of 1866. Appointed to the Suffolk County Bar on February 2, 1872, he later furthered his studies in law in the office of Jewell, Gaston & Field, but later opted to join his father in the banking profession. In 1871 he joined his father in working for the Union National Bank as an assistant cashier. Upon his father's death in 1874, Loud assumed his position as cashier, and remained in that post until his resignation in 1895 for health reasons. Inventions Loud's patent of the ballpoint pen, 1888 Keenly interested in inventing, on October 30, 1888, Loud obtained the first patent (US #392,046) for a ballpoint penCollingridge, M. R. et al. (2007) \\"Ink Reservoir Writing Instruments 1905–20\\" Transactions of the Newcomen Society 77(1): pp. 69–100, page 69 when attempting to make a writing instrument that would be able to write on leather products, which then-common fountain pens could not. Loud's pen had a small rotating steel ball, held in place by a socket. In the patent, he noted: Although his invention could be used to mark rough surfaces such as leather, as he had originally intended, it proved to be too coarse for letter-writing. With no commercial viability, its potential went unexploited and the patent eventually lapsed. Loud had also registered patents for a firecracker cannon (1888) and a \\"toy cannon\\" (1887). Personal life, death Residing in Weymouth, Loud was a member of the Union Congregational Church. He was an active genealogist, and an active member of the Maine Genealogical Society, New Hampshire Genealogical Society, New England Historic Genealogical Society, and Weymouth Historical Society (of which he was a founding member). He was a descendant of Francis Loud, originally of Ipswich, Massachusetts, and Mayflower passengers William Brewster and John Alden. Loud also was a trustee of the Weymouth Savings Banks, Tufts University Library and the Derby Academy, and a conductor of the Union Religious Society choir at Weymouth and in Braintree. A noted orator, he spoke at many local events, including delivering an address upon the building of the first warship at the Fore River Shipyard in 1900. He also wrote poetry and songs in his spare time. One of his sisters, Annie Frances Loud, was a locally noted composer of \\"sacred music\\". He was married to Emily Keith Vickery from November 7, 1872 until her death in November 1911. The couple had eight children. He died at his home in Weymouth on August 10, 1916, and was buried at Village Cemetery in Weymouth.

It is held in the month of February or March, the date being determined according to the Malayalam Calendar. Chettikulangara Bharani in the Bharani nakshatra in the Malayalam month of Kumbha and hence the name Kumbha Bharani. Kuthiyottam and Kettukazhcha are the highlights of the festival. The festival is under consideration to be bestowed with the Intangible Cultural Heritage status by UNESCO. Origins According to a legend, a group of Village chieftains and their workers went to construct the Kollam – Chavara canal, acting on the decision of their King. They were stranded due to an inordinate delay in construction. Authorities turned down their plea to return. During the period they visited the temple festivities of Kollam Mulangakam temple. Attracted by the Kettukazhcha there they vowed to their local deity Chettikulangara Bhagavathy, that they would construct similar Kettukazhchas for her every year, if they were allowed to leave for Chetitkulangara immediately. To their surprise, they were allowed to return to Chettikulangara the very next day, and as promised, they made huge Kettukazhchas and took them to their Bhagavathy's premises. Kuthiyottam Kuthiyottam is performed as the most important offering to the deity. It is a symbolic human sacrifice to appease goddess Kali. It is believed that the origin of kuthiyottam is from blood sacrifice to please the ferocious Goddess Kali and the ritual has moderated over time, possibly under the influence of Buddhism. The person who vow to offer Kuthiyottam, adopt two or four pre-pubescent boys who are symbolically sacrificed. They are adopted on the day of shivaratri and brought to the sponsors house where a canopy is erected and a shrine of Kali is constructed. They are taught basic kuthiyottam steps by trained performers. On the day of Bharani the boys are bathed and dressed up as kings with paper crown, bangles, fac. Their abdominal skin is pierced with silver or golden thread. The ritual is known as Chooral Muriyal the name comes from Chooral (cane), as cane threads were used earlier and muri (cut). They are then taken to the temple, accompanied by pompous procession. In the front of the sanctum sanctorum they perform the steps taught to them to four songs praising the goddess and thread is then removed and offered to the goddess. These boys are now ritually dead and may not take part in kuthiyottam again. Kuthiyottam is a blend of dance, music and ritual. The boys perform folk dance to Kuthiyottam folk song. In every house vowed to offer kuthiyottam, performance by trained artist will also be hosted alongside teaching the boys Kuthiyottam. Kuthiyottam folk song has tanavattam tala. Kuthiyottam used to be done only in houses in the 13 Karas of the Chettikulangara Temple but after a recent Deva Prashnam it was allowed to conduct Kuthiyottam in the houses outside of the 13 Karas. Kettukazhcha Kettukazhcha is an offering of people of the 13 provinces to their deity to thank for favors received as well as to seek her blessings. Chettikulangara kettukazhcha consists of 13 provincial floats including six huge and heavily decorated temple cars known as Kuthira (Horses), five smaller temple cars known Theru (Chariots) and effigies of Bhima, Hanuman and Panchali. =Kuthira= Although Kuthira means horse, the temple cars have no resemblance to horses and the origin of the name is still unknown. Kuthiras are the bigger of the temple cars and have a height of about 70 to 75 feet. The bottom most part of the Kuthira is called Adikkottu or Vandikkoottu. It is the basic foundation on which the rest of the parts rests on. It is a platform having four big wooden wheels, interconnected by wooden beams. Attached to the platform are two huge wooden poles (Achuthandu), used to steer the Kuthira. Above the Adikkottu there is Kathirukal with a height of 35 feet, consists of four long poles. They are interconnected with arecanut poles (Alaku) and further strengthened with crisscross formation of Alakus (Kuthukathrika) fastened by coir and Panavalli knots. Bottom part of the Kathirukal, called Adikoodaram consist of four to five extended layers of slanting box pyramids (Thattu & Charippu), then decorated with white cloth (Vella), colourful glittering clothes and embellishments (Thookku). Above the Adikoodaram there is Prabhada. Prabhada is the most magnificent part of the Kuthira. It consist of carved wooden sculptors narrating tales like Krishnaleela, Gajendra Moksham, etc... in the middle of there is elephant caparisons (Nettipattom). Although the Prabhada gives the impression that it is carved on a single wood, is actually composed of small carefully assembled fragments. Positioned above the Prabhada, Edakoodaram is almost half the size of Kathirukal with four to five Charippu made as in the lower portion, comes above the Kathirukal. It also has glittering different clothes and Vella, interlaced with colourful Thookku embellishments. On top of the Kuthira there is Melkkoodaram, pyramidal in shape, Melkkoodaram of Chettikulangara Kuthira is four faced Kumbhathoppi, not the three face Pallimukham. A white wooden pole (Nambu) extends from the top of the Melkkoodaram. In Kuthira the size from top to bottom is almost same except for the Prabhada in between. =Theru= Theru means chariot but they resemble pagodas rather than chariots. Theru is smaller than Kuthiras they do not have Prabhada and Edakkoodaram. They have bigger Charippu and prominent Illithattu in between Charippu. They diminish in size upwards. =Hanuman= Mattom South brings wooden effigy of Hanuman. Human effigy depicts Hanuman in the court of Ravana. Kadalipazham garland is the offering for Hanuman. =Panchali= Panchali effigy is also brought by Mattom South. The effigy depicts Panchali, clad in ornaments, waiting for Bhima who went to gather Kalyanasougandikam flower. Silk is the offering to Panchali. =Bhima= Mattom North bring a massive three and half tonne wooden effigy of Bhima. The effigy depicts Bhima riding bullock cart en route to kill demon Bakasuran. =Gallery= =Buddhist connection= There are speculations that kettukazhcha is of Buddhist origins because of the Buddhist history of the region. There are no Hindu festival elsewhere, other than in the nearby region, similar to Kettukazhcha moreover a few Buddhist festivals and Pagoda's sport a striking similarity.

He designed churches throughout the country, particularly in Victoria, primarily Anglican but also Methodists, Presbyterians, Lutherans and Christian Scientists. He himself regarded St Andrew's Anglican Church, Brighton in Melbourne, as his greatest work. Williams was probably the major church architect in Australia in the Arts and Crafts tradition from the 1920s to the 1970s.Gladys Marie Moore, \\"Louis Reginald Williams\\", Masters thesis, Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning, The University of Melbourne, 2001, Abstract. Early life and training Williams was born in Hobart, Tasmania and attended school at Queen's College. His father was a furniture manufacturer, and the family was very religious. Williams's interest in churches led to his choosing a career in architecture, and he was trained by Alexander North, then architect to the Diocese of Tasmania. Williams and North eventually became partners and moved to Melbourne, where they started a joint practice. Career Williams executed some domestic and commercial commissions, but specialised in churches. His primary client was the Anglican Church; for many years he was diocesan architect for both Bathurst, where he enlarged the cathedral,Journal and Proceedings - Royal Australian Historical Society 32 (1947) p. 149. and Grafton; he was advisory architect to the Chapter of Goulburn Cathedral, and designed buildings for every diocese in Victoria and also for the dioceses of Adelaide, North Queensland, Perth, Bunbury and for Devonport and Railton. He also worked for Methodists, Presbyterians, Lutherans and Christian Scientists. Churches designed by him exist throughout Australia and include concrete and timber bush buildings, suburban brick buildings, and three cathedrals, two of which he completed and one of which he designed in its entirety. He himself regarded as his best work St Andrew's Church in the Melbourne seaside suburb of Brighton, where he lived. Williams was usually commissioned to design a church of a specified capacity within a specified budget. At a time when other architects were experimenting with new styles, he preferred to work within the traditional Arts and Crafts, Gothic style. Concerned about quality, craftsmanship and architectural integrity, he insisted on also designing furniture and fittings to harmonise with the building. He advised on lighting, stained glass, metalwork, altar furnishings, plate, carved ornamentation, murals, opus sectile mosaics, and floor coverings. He gathered a group of trusted craftsmen with whom he usually worked. He introduced innovations that increase the sense of space in his churches and make them more comfortable in the hot climate. His career lasted for more than 65 years, until he was 86. In World War II, when most building was suspended, he moved his practice from Queen Street in Melbourne City Centre to his home in Brighton. Personal life Williams was married to Mary Tasker, the sister of Senator Burford Sampson.\\"Family Notices: Deaths\\", The Advocate, 15 September 1943, p. 2. Later in life, years after Mary died, he married Frances Joyce McDougall (Mason), a widow of 30 plus years. They were old family friends from Brighton and Aireys Inlet. Their children were friends from very young.

Initially Toodyay was located in what is now West Toodyay before repeated flooding caused the town centre to migrate to the area around the Newcastle convict depot creating the town of Newcastle. After approximately 50 years of confusion the name of Newcastle was changed to Toodyay and the original Toodyay became known as West Toodyay. Toodyay locations The original townsite of Toodyay was determined in 1836. Following serious flooding in 1857 and 1859, the decision was made to transfer the town to the site of the Toodyay Convict Depot located approximately upstream. The new township, to be known as Newcastle, was gazetted on 1 October 1860. The name \\"Newcastle\\" was derived from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Duke of Newcastle. The township of \\"Old\\" Toodyay continued to exist, although it ceased to expand. In August 1909, the Federal authorities urged the town of Newcastle to change its name. The towns of Newcastle in New South Wales and Newcastle in Western Australia were being confused. All too often the problem of duplicated place names was causing mail to go astray. One instance of mail going astray concerned an item discovered by Sir John Forrest. A beautiful French ormolu clock had been delivered mistakenly to Newcastle, New South Wales, where it had sat unclaimed. Forrest recognised that the clock belonged to William Demasson of Newcastle, Western Australia, and arranged for it to be restored to its rightful owner. This incident is known to have contributed to the call for change. In February 1910, the Municipal Council held a referendum and, by a slim majority, it was decided to change the name of the town to Toodyay. On 6 May 1910, it was declared that the town of Newcastle would henceforth be known as Toodyay and the old town of Toodyay would henceforth be known as West Toodyay. The French Ormolu clock, long held by the Demasson family, was purchased by the National Trust of Western Australia in 1987. In turn, the clock, together with its documents was offered to the Toodyay Historical Society. On 21 October 2007, the clock was welcomed back to the town of Toodyay. Meaning of the name 'Toodyay' There are no records for the meaning or the origin of the name Toodyay, which derives from ' or ' in the Noongar language. In 1929 during Western Australia's centennial year, Victor Riseley published an article in The Sunday Times in response to other publications during the year that had tried to define its origins. Riseley contended that the definition of \\"beautiful\\", while the perfect description of the region, was not a descriptive for which the Ballardong people had any use, as their place names were related to the necessities of daily life. Riseley concluded that Toodyay was derived from , the name of the wife of one of the trackers who accompanied George Fletcher Moore in 1836 to the valley known as Gabbia-Yandirt. Another possible origin is that toodyay is derived from an account written by James Drummond of a party taking up land grants in the region in 1836. As they proceeded onto Drummond's grant, and finding an area of good land and water, their guide Babbing said the area was known as '. This area was said to be a favourite of the Ballardong people because of the abundance of reed mace, whose thick roots are a good source of starch and mucilage. Note: Drummond's writings do not mention any meaning for the word ' although other words were defined in this work. In recent years, other origins for the name have been proposed by anthropologists. Professor Len Collard's Noongar language project provides the meaning as \\"today it is misty and foggy\\". Another proposal was that the name is derived from the song of a bird such as the restless flycatcher (Myiagra inquieta) which is said to sound like ' or '. This bird is found commonly in the region as well as the Canning region where Babbing grew up. Anthropologists Ken Macintyre and Barb Dobson speculate that Babbing was describing the sound of a bird. Drummond didn't enquire into the meaning of the word, as he did for other words during his account of the 1836 journey. Macintyre and Dobson note that Toodyeep was from the area but that Aboriginal people were named after the place where they were born or raised rather than the place being named after them and therefore dismiss this as a possible origin for the name Toodyay. By 1842 Drummond in his correspondence was referring to the area as Toodyay while referring to Duidgee Catta as the name of a pool on his estate.

It is based on the novel with the same name written by Gianrico Carofiglio, who also collaborated to the screenplay. It entered the competition at the 2008 Rome International Film Festival, in which Michele Riondino was awarded best actor. Plot  Bari: Giorgio, a classic good guy and a law graduate, feels a bit out of place in circles he frequented with his girlfriend. During an elegant Christmas party he defends a stranger, Francesco, with whom he forms a solid friendship that introduces him to a world totally unknown to him, that of gambling - poker, in this case -, in which the two play couple cheating. The new experiences inebriate Giorgio and drag him into situations much greater than him. The boy is progressively engulfed by a whirlwind of illegality and immorality: he regularly visits the house of a married woman, buys a luxurious car with the proceeds of poker and reacts violently to the questions of his parents, who worry more and more. One day Francesco informs him of his imminent departure for Spain; Giorgio decides to follow him despite discovering, with an initial repulsion soon overwhelmed by excitement, that his friend intends to devote himself to the cocaine trade. In Barcelona, the two come to live increasingly wild experiences, leading to sexual violence against a young bartender. After returning to Bari, Francesco becomes nowhere to be found. One night Giorgio tracks him down as he leaves a club; shortly after Francesco chases the bartender who works there, Antonia, and attacks her. The friend intervenes, a fight arises and the carabinieri arrive. After being beaten to death, Giorgio is released because the girl testified on his behalf. He also claims to the commander that he only vaguely knows Francesco, with whom the young man catches a last glance through a window - he too was beaten to death by the carabinieri -, leaving the barracks. Some time later, Giorgio is an established lawyer; after an audience Antonia approaches him to thank him for having saved her the night of the attempted violence. Without speaking, Giorgio watches her go.

This festival is an ancient tradition and the most important celebrated in the city, attracting people from all over the world. It is held every four years, the last one being held between June 29 to July 8, 2019. The local population parades in pairs with the girls carrying tabuleiros on their heads. The tabuleiro is made of 30 stacked pieces of bread, either in 6 rows of 5 or 5 rows of 6, decorated with flowers. At the top of the tabuleiro is a crown which normally contains either a white dove, symbolising the Holy Spirit, or the esfera armilar (armillary sphere), a symbol of the historical Portuguese maritime expansion, and over the sphere, the cross of the Order of Christ. The festival also includes various traditional ceremonies like the \\"Procession of the Crowns\\", the \\"Procession of the Boys\\", the \\"Procession of the Mordomo\\" and the \\"Arrival of the Bulls of the Holy Spirit\\", as well as partial parades and popular games. The Pêza, or sharing of bread and meat by the population, is celebrated on the day after the processions. Although the festival originated in ancient Portuguese millenarian rituals dating to the 13th century, specifically the Culto do Império do Divino Espírito Santo (Cult of the Empire of the Holy Spirit) celebrated on the feast day of the Pentecost, and has gradually evolved since then, the form of the festival as currently celebrated was standardized in 1950. In this context, \\"cult\\" refers to accepted religious practice, rather than the modern negative connotations of the word. In some localities around the town of Tomar, as at Carregueiros, the complete ceremony of the ancient cult of the Empire of the Holy Spirit is still practiced, including the \\"Coronation of the Emperor\\", symbolizing the future Emperor of the Age of the Holy Spirit, and the Bodo (Feast). According to the traditional doctrines of the cult, in this Third Age the world would be governed by the Empire of Holy Spirit under monastic or fraternal rule, in which the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, its intermediaries in the clergy, and organized churches would be unnecessary, and \\"infidels\\" would unite with Christians by their own free will. The Tabuleiros were identified as an offering by each family for the symbolic building of the Temple of Jerusalem, that is, as the supporting columns of the Temple of the Heavenly Jerusalem and of the Temple of Solomon.

The yellow prune tree sawfly (Hoplocampa flava) is very common.Maurice Coutanceau, Encyclopédie des Jardins, Librairie Larousse, Paris, 1957, 544 p.  Treatments  At the start of vegetation (10 to 15 days before flowering), install white glued bands on the trees at a height of about 0.70 to 1 meter. When the adults get active, they mistake them for flowers and get stuck on them. Idem for the cherry sawfly but with yellow bands.

It is characterised by its late Brabantine Gothic exterior and rich interior decoration including two Baroque chapels. History =Origins= The history of the church goes back to the early 13th century when Henry I (1165–1235), the Duke of Brabant, recognised the Noble Serment of Crossbowmen as a guild and granted them certain privileges, including the right to use a plot at the Sablon/Zavel (a piece of sandy clay land outside the city walls) as an exercise ground. Nearly a century later, in 1304, the Guild of the brothers and sisters of Saint John's Hospital (, ) ceded to the Crossbowmen's Guild an area adjacent to the Sablon where the Guild proceeded to build a modest chapel dedicated to Our Lady. This chapel became the chapel of the Crossbowmen's Guild.Rudi Schrever, Onze-Lieve-Vrouw- ter-Zavelkerk in Brussel'' Legend has is that the chapel became famous after a local devout woman named Beatrijs Soetkens had a vision in which the Virgin Mary instructed her to steal the miraculous statue of Onze-Lieve-Vrouw op ‘t Stocxken (\\"Our Lady on the little stick\\") in Antwerp, bring it to Brussels, and place it in the chapel of the Crossbowmen's Guild. The woman stole the statue, and through a series of miraculous events, was able to transport it to Brussels by boat in 1348. It was then solemnly placed in the chapel and venerated as the patron of the Guild. The Guild also promised to hold an annual procession, called an Ommegang, in which the statue was carried through Brussels. This Ommegang developed into an important religious and civil event in Brussels' annual calendar. =Construction= The construction of the church, which replaced the chapel, is generally believed to have started around 1400. The whole construction process took about a century. The choir was finished in 1435, as testified by mural paintings of that date. The works were interrupted because of the troubles after the death of Charles the Bold in 1477, but restarted by the end of the century. The nave was built with seven bays, the last two of which should have been surmounted by a tower that was never completed. The sacrarium built behind the choir dates from 1549. At the end of the 16th century, the church was sacked by Calvinists and the statue of the Virgin, which Beatrijs Soetkens had brought, was destroyed.Collectif, Le Sablon. Le quartier et l'église, Ville d'Art et d'Histoire. n° 9, Éditions Solibel & Région de Bruxelles-Capitale, 1994, p. 16 The church in 1612, as drawn by Remigio Cantagallina In the 17th century, the prominent family of Thurn und Taxis, whose residence was located almost opposite the southern entrance of the church, had two chapels built inside it: the Chapel of St. Ursula (1651–1676), situated north of the choir, started by the sculptor-architect Lucas Faydherbe from Mechelen and completed by Vincent Anthony; and the Chapel of Saint Marcouf (1690), situated south of the choir. At the beginning of the French occupation in 1795, the church was saved from the anti-religious zeal of the occupiers and their supporters thanks to the priest swearing allegiance to the Republic. The church remained closed for a few years and was returned to religious service under Napoleon, as a subsidiary of the Chapel Church. =Renovation= King Albert I and Queen Elisabeth praying to Our lady of the Sablon Soon after the completion of the final section of / in 1872, the buildings that had been built against the church were removed. The church appeared so dilapidated after this removal that restoration works were launched immediately. The first works were entrusted, in 1870, to the local architect Auguste Schoy. He proposed a restoration project that was so radical that the Commission of Monuments at first refused to endorse it because it was considered too fanciful.Collectif, Le Sablon. Le quartier et l'église, Ville d'Art et d'Histoire. n° 9, Éditions Solibel & Région de Bruxelles-Capitale, 1994, p. 34 Schoy’s intervention was restricted to rather modest works: rehabilitation of the side aisles on Rue de la Régence; reopening of the pointed arch windows on the side of /, which had been walled up in the 18th century for the installation of organs; and replacing the rose window of the north portal with a pointed arch window. The site was then entrusted to the Belgian architect Jules-Jacques Van Ysendijck and then to his son Maurice. Jules-Jacques van Ysendijck was a disciple of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc and led the work in accordance with the principle of unity of style of the latter. From 1895 to 1912, he and his son implemented six construction phases by which they created a monument that had never existed. They added turrets, pinnacles and openwork balustrades, covered the aisles with perpendicular gables instead of the continuous gables parallel to the nave, and built buttresses with pinnacles. From 1917 to 1937, the architect François Malfait directed the placement of 57 statues from 27 different sculptors. More recently, the City of Brussels undertook a global restoration to bring back the church to its former glory. The entire restoration lasted fourteen years. Features 269x269px Striking features of the nave are the pillars that have no capital, contributing to the verticalising effect. The columns of the nave hold twelve statues of apostles, dating from the mid 17th century, which were sculpted by some of the leading Baroque sculptors of that time. The triforium is remarkable for its rhythmic vesica piscis motifs. The polychrome murals in the choir date from the first half of the 15th century.Kirsten De Man, Henri Vandekerckhove, Bieke Verhelst, Taakkerkaf, 19/12/2012 There is a magnificent triptych of the Flemish painter Michiel Coxie (1499–1592) on The Resurrection of Christ, as well as a Beheading of Barbara, formerly attributed to Erasmus Quellinus (1607–1678), but now attributed to Gaspar de Crayer.Gaspar de Crayer, De onthoofding van de H.

The Baroque pulpit is a work of Marc de Vos, executed in 1697 for the Temple of the Augustinians in Brussels, which no longer exists. It is decorated with medallions of St. Thomas Aquinas, the Virgin and St. Thomas of Villanova. The base on which the pulpit rests is formed by four sculptures symbolising the Evangelists: the angel, the eagle, the lion and the ox. The church houses several Baroque tomb monuments. The church holds other treasures such as the reliquary with the bones of St. Wivina. File:BRUXELLES Eglise Notre-Dame du Sablon (1).jpgExternal view of the sacrarium File:Chaire de vérité.JPGDetail of the pulpit by Marc de Vos Baroque chapels 270x270px The church is best known for its two magnificent Baroque chapels, which the Thurn und Taxis family had built on both sides of the choir in the second half of the 17th century. One chapel is dedicated to St. Ursula and was designed by Lucas Faydherbe (1617–1697) and contains ornate sculptures by Gabriël Grupello (1644–1730), Mattheus van Beveren (–after 21 January 1696), Jerôme Duquesnoy (II) (1602–1654) and Jan van Delen (–1703).Helena Bussers, De baroksculptuur en het barok at Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen The other chapel is dedicated to Saint Marcouf, who is, amongst others, the patron saint of the pharmacists and drapers. The two chapels are excellent examples of the high baroque sculpture and architecture developed in the Southern Netherlands. Directly opposite the church, there is a memorial plaque on the location where the Thurn und Taxis family had their residence, and as imperial postmasters, founded the first international postal service in 1516.

It depicts a sermon on political matters by the Jesuit priest Piotr Skarga, a chief figure of the Counter Reformation in Poland, where he rebukes the Polish elite for neglecting the national interest. Skarga's Sermon is among Matejko's most famous works, and like other historical paintings by Matejko includes several portraits of identifiable historical figures of the period depicted, as well as in this case a self-portrait of the artist in the figure of Skarga. History Matejko finished the painting in May 1864. It was the first \\"large\\" painting of Matejko (the canvas had the size of over , several times larger than any of his prior work). It was displayed in the gallery of the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Art (Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Sztuk Pięknych w Krakowie). Painting's premiere drew crowds and reviews comparable with modern movie premieres. Soon afterwards Count Maurycy Potocki bought it for 10,000 guldens. Composition and significance The painting shows Poland of the early 17th century, a country torn between the magnates and elected kings of the House of Vasa, with a proud and egotistical nobility, beginning a slide into an ungovernable anarchy. In that context, little heed was paid to the calls of many individuals (such as Skarga) for reform. Matejko's work became one of the major elements of the \\"legend of Piotr Skarga\\", helping the Jesuit achieve a lasting fame in Poland. Although Matejko's work fits within the genre of historical painting, with the Sermon... he departed from strict adherence to historical accuracy, focusing more on the message; thus this painting, like many of his subsequent works, included characters or items that could not have been present at the depicted scene. The painting portrays Piotr Skarga, a Jesuit, giving a sermon in the presbytery of the Wawel Cathedral. He is visible at the top right, clad in black, with his hands raised, paused in the middle of the speech. His face is that of Matejko himself, if significantly aged (another source, however, suggests that Matejko asked Michał Szweycer to pose for Skarga instead). Skarga is the only animated character in the composition, all other individuals are shown as immobile, standing or sitting. The title of the painting suggests that the theme of Skarga's speech is his famous critique of the Polish government and a prophecy of its destruction. In reality, however, there is no proof that Skarga's work was ever delivered in the form of a real sermon. Various historical figures, listening to the sermon, react to it through posture and facial expressions in a manner that suggest Matejko's view of their historical role. In the center, magnates Janusz Radziwiłł (1579-1620) (in a golden robe), Stanisław Stadnicki, Mikołaj Zebrzydowski, stand together, arrogant and unfazed. Jerzy Mniszech, Jan Piotr Sapieha and Janusz Zbaraski to their right seem to be listening, but an older nobleman is dozing nearby as a reminder that most nobility did not care either way about the issues Skarga is discussing. To their left, the king, Sigismund III Vasa, seems not to be paying too much attention to the preacher. His foreign garb stresses his unwillingness to integrate with his subjects; he always considered himself more of a Swede than a Pole, and would have preferred to be a king of Sweden instead. Sigismund is portrayed by Matejko as the second most important character in the painting, as he is also illuminated by light, albeit immobile, compared to Skarga. Sigismund's son, prince and future king Władysław IV Waza, stands above and to the left of the king. To his right, two women - Queen Anna Jagiellonka and Halszka Ostrogska are present. A glove on the floor between the king and the magnates is a sign of the upcoming civil war. At the top left, chancellor Jan Zamoyski listens, tired. This ambitious and successful politician and military commander seems to understand the gravity of Skarga's words, but he is near the end of his life. Mikołaj Wolski is visible between the prince and the chancellor. Underneath Zamoyski, archbishop Stanisław Karnkowski in purple is praying, and between these two the metropolitan of the Unites, Hipacy Pociej, is visibly not taken by the Jesuit's oratory. The Papal nuncio Germanicus Malaspina, bishop of San Severo, is visible at Skarga's bottom right. Cardinal Enrico Caetani (in red) is shown below Skarga, and Spanish and Austrian envoys, bored and distanced, are behind him. =Praise= On 5 November 1864, in recognition for his contributions to recreating historical themes as exemplified in this painting, Matejko was elected a member of the Kraków Scientific Society (Towarzystwo Naukowe Krakowskie). This painting was the one that made Matejko famous not only in (partitioned) Poland, but beyond, in Europe. In 1865 the painting was awarded a gold medal at the annual Paris salon. Parisian critics reviewed the work of 26-year-old Matejko very positively, comparing it favorably to the work of Paul Delaroche and Louis Gallait, although many considered the theme of Polish history rather obscure, and some argued that the painting was too dark (too much blacks and violets). The painting has been compared to Jan August Hendrik Leys's Restoration of the Catholic rite in the Holiest Virgin Mary Church in Antwerp in 1566, as regards its composition and Counter Reformation theme.

Serpentine House () is a modernist apartment building complex on Mäkelänkatu in the Käpylä district of Helsinki, Finland. The complex was designed by Yrjö Lindegren and opened in 1952. It is owned by the City of Helsinki apartments company and comprises 189 rental apartments in two four-storey buildings. A two-storey service building houses a day-care center and a swimming hall. The apartment buildings also include some commercial space. The complex gets its name from the twisty form of the buildings. The yard was designed by landscape architect Elisabeth Koch in 1953. It was last renovated in the 1980s preserving the essential characteristics of the original garden design. The City of Helsinki is in the process of protecting Serpentine House as of March 2014. Once the zoning changes with the protection details have been approved, the badly deteriorated buildings will undergo extensive renovations. The apartments still include original furnishings (for instance in the kitchens) which will also be repaired. The renovation is expected to cost 28 million euros. The renovation of the first building was finished in May 2018 and it is now a lighter color closer to the original 1950s look. The renovation of the second building starts in the Fall 2018. Serpentine House is listed by Docomomo as a significant example of modern architecture in Finland.

The hull, sails, rig and foils are a strict one design to control costs. However, considerable freedom is allowed in the placement of fittings to allow boats to be tailored to personal preference. The mast is a sealed section with a halyard running inside the track to help prevent inversion on capsize. The mast has single spreaders and lower shrouds to allow adjustment for different helms and conditions. The forestay is adjustable to allow depowering in conjunction with a cascade style kicker.

The vernacular building has a wood frame plan and limestone walls and used local materials in its construction, which cost $3,855.55. Reverend Robert Ross led the congregation when it built the 1854 church; Ross was one of the founders of Monmouth College and served on its first Board of Trustees.

Their three silvers and a bronze at the Winter Paralympics made them the most successful female British Winter Paralympians of all time, and the first Britons to win four medals at one Paralympics. Because of her success at the 2014 Paralympics, Etherington was the British flagbearer at the 2014 Winter Paralympics closing ceremony. Etherington has only five percent vision in both eyes and competes in the visually impaired category. Because of her impairment she requires a sighted guide, Caroline Powell. The pair have competed together since August 2013. After asking for a new guide through Facebook and after two other applicants pulled out, Etherington and Powell combined in April 2013. Personal history Etherington was born in Chelmsford on 9 March 1991, to Amber, a Braintree District Council employee, and Andrew, a stockbroker. They lived in The Causeway, Maldon, but when Jade was seven they moved to Lincolnshire. She was born with glaucoma and Axenfeld syndrome, a visual impairment which can lead to blindness. She inherited it from her mother, Amber, who lost her sight at 14. Her three younger sisters also have the condition. Despite undergoing multiple surgeries as a child, by the age of 17 she began to lose her sight. She describes her vision as \\"very blurry with little focus\\", and she has a recorded five percent vision in both eyes, which puts her in the B2 classification. Etherington was educated at The Deepings School in Lincolnshire before matriculating to Bishop Grosseteste University where she was awarded a degree in education and geography. Etherington studied to become a geography teacher with The Open University, undertaking a PGCE, but placed her career on hold to concentrate on the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games. In 2014, she was awarded doctorate of science honoris causa by Anglia Ruskin University.http://www.chelmsfordweeklynews.co.uk/news/11519829.Chelmsford_born_Paralympian_accepts_honorary_degree_from_university/ Skiing career Etherington began skiing while still sighted at the age of eight, being taught by her father Andrew and her sisters. She continued skiing recreationally for the next ten years. In 2009, she joined the British Disabled Ski Team (BDST) at development level, and began racing internationally in 2011. The following year she carried the Olympic torch through Lincoln, and was inspired to compete at a higher level after watching the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in London. La Molina Etherington's at Europa cup and International Paralympic Committee (IPC) alpine skiing events was achieved with her sighted guide Fiona Gingell, but Etherington was forced to appeal for a new guide on her Facebook page after Gingell married and moved to America. After two applicants pulled out, she was left without a guide at the beginning of 2013, but Heather Mills, who had not qualified for the World Championships, offered her coach, John Clark. The pair qualified for the 2013 IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships in La Molina, representing Great Britain. At La Molina, Etherington came fourth in the women's slalom and came third in the women's super-G, taking bronze. The runs ensured her place at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi. Etherington teamed up with Caroline Powell in April, allowing her to compete that season. Etherington and Powell began skiing together in August 2013. =Paralympics= The 2014 Winter Paralympics was Etherington's debut Paralympics, competing for ParalympicsGB. She competed in the downhill, winning a silver medal with Powell on 8 March 2014. Slovakian Henrieta Farkasova came 2.73 seconds ahead. This was the first time a British woman had won a Winter Paralympic medal on snow, and ParalympicsGB's first medal of the 2014 Paralympics. Etherington then won a bronze medal in the women's downhill skiing, and silver in the slalom and the super combined. After winning a silver medal in the super-G visually impaired event on 14 March 2014, she and Powell became Great Britain's most successful female Winter Paralympians, and the first Britons to win four medals at one Paralympics. However, they pulled out of the giant slalom, which was on the day of the Sochi 2014 Closing Ceremony. The four medals she won at the 2014 Winter Paralympics were part of a total of six for ParalympicsGB, 66% of the total British medals at the games. Etherington was the flag bearer for Great Britain at the closing ceremony, despite rupturing an ovarian cyst, which left her in a wheelchair for much of the day of the ceremony; she was able to walk and carry the flag having taken painkillers. After the end of the 2014 Winter Paralympics, she was unsure if she would continue competing at international level, saying \\"I don't really know what I want right now\\". In November 2014, Etherington announced her retirement from the Paralympic Alpine Skiing programme, aged 23.

Originating from Chicago, the three-hour-long program utilizes the journalistic resources of the 110 television news operations throughout the United States that are operated under WGN America corporate parent Nexstar Media Group. The broadcast is designed as an alternative to the opinion-based programs on CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News Channel during the 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time slot. (As with those programs, NewsNation offers a same-night rebroadcast from 11:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. ET, in order to align the program with the prime time period in the Pacific Time Zone.) The program combines reporting from five national correspondents and repackaged content from local Nexstar stations.  History  The genesis of the project was in October 2019, when Nexstar management commissioned viewer research that showed that people were dissatisfied with opinion-based programming on the cable news channels. CNN, which had previously shown straight news programming during the evening, moved into personality-based left wing programming under the leadership of Jeff Zucker, while MSNBC (which gravitated toward liberal opinion/talk programs beginning in 2008), Fox News, and One America News Network (the latter two networks have both used conservative talk shows) to anchor their prime time shows since the May 2004 cancellation of The News with Brian Williams and the Fox Report relegation to a weekend-only telecast in October 2013. Originally codenamed Project Neutral, on January 15, 2020, Nexstar announced the program, four months after the company closed on an acquisition of Tribune Media that encompassed much of the latter's broadcast and digital assets (including WGN America, which was the lone wholly owned property among Tribune's cable television assets and remains so as a Nexstar property), and greatly expanded Nexstar's broadcasting portfolio in the 50 largest U.S. television markets (adding stations in such major cities as Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and Houston). The program was developed under management of Jennifer Lyons, who was reassigned by Nexstar from her role as news director at its Chicago station WGN-TV to serve as WGN America's vice president of news, with the assistance of WGN America Executive Vice President Sean Compton. NewsNation is the first national news effort to use WGN America as a platform since the channel—then operating as WGN-TV's superstation feed under the ownership of former parent Tribune—carried the similarly formatted Independent Network News from its premiere in June 1980 until the Tribune- distributed syndicated newscast ended in June 1990. Upon its September 2020 premiere, NewsNation replaced acquired entertainment programming and movies that WGN America used to occupy prime time and early late-night timeslots. Because the program replaced syndicated programming that was scheduled to have their contracts expire or have their allotted timeslots reduced within the WGN America schedule, the cost of developing NewsNation and hiring personnel for the program is neutral to Nexstar. The program was developed amid the COVID-19 pandemic and launched just before the 2020 United States presidential election. Nexstar hired \\"rhetoricians\\" to monitor the language used to describe events for neutrality, and is also providing significant weather coverage, which is, for the most part, not currently readily available on cable television (except for hurricanes and other major severe weather events, particularly as The Weather Channel currently shows weather-related entertainment and documentary programs in prime time, and all-weather-focused WeatherNation TV and AccuWeather Network have relatively limited pay television distribution). Nexstar spent $20 million to build the operation, including a renovation of the WGN-TV studio facility in Chicago's North Center community. NewsNation studio was built inside Studio 3, which was previously occupied by defunct regional cable news channel Chicagoland Television; the program's newsroom was built above WGN-TV's local newsroom, in space formerly occupied by sister AM radio station WGN. The company also spent $100 million in advertising for the September 2020 launch, including a 28-minute behind- the-scenes program which was uploaded on WGN America's YouTube and Facebook platforms on August 17, 2020, and aired commercial-free on WGN America and on Nexstar stations during the weekend of August 29. To prevent preconceived viewer impressions based on their past work, Compton and Lyons hired journalists with experience rooted mainly in local television news to be part of the program's in-house staff of anchors, correspondents and meteorologists. Compton told the Los Angeles Times in June 2020, “We just hired local journalists who have not been at opinionated networks because let’s face it, the big three news channels are all opinionated — two on the left, one on the right. We want them to come from local stations which tend to report facts and let you come to your own opinion.” By its launch, NewsNation hired 150 people in Chicago and bureaus in Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Washington, D.C. and Dallas. The program also uses reporting from local Nexstar stations. Nexstar required that its local stations withhold breaking news footage from competing networks in order to give NewsNation right of first coverage; the move led CNN to terminate a video sharing agreement that granted Nexstar’s 197 stations access to content from its CNN Newsource video wire service. Over the first month, ratings reached approximately 100,000 viewers per night, approximately in line with the viewership of syndicated reruns and first-run programming that had previously occupied the timeslot. However, average ratings—factoring drop-offs from first-week sampling—fell below 100,000 viewers for its second and third hours following its premiere week. The program saw a ratings high for anchor Joe Donlon's September 22, 2020, interview with President Donald Trump, which peaked at 218,000 viewers for the 8:00 p.m. ET hour, before falling to 54,000 viewers for that night's third hour.  Digital content  NewsNation Now app The digital platform, which provides supplemental content to that which is featured on the television broadcast, is branded as NewsNation Now. The platform's app includes audio updates—consisting of news summaries (similar to the top-of-the-hour national summaries played on affiliates of syndicated radio news providers) and single- story segments—produced by Nexstar-owned news/talk radio station WGN in Chicago, which dropped its decades-long ABC News Radio affiliation amid NewsNation launch. To promote the newscast, WGN America offered viewers unrestricted access to the livestream of the program's live broadcast and rebroadcast in the lead-up to the 2020 United States presidential election; following the promotional period, the livestream will only be accessible via provider login to subscribers who receive WGN America through cable, satellite and wireline-style IPTV providers. (With the exception of AT&T; TV Now, WGN America remains unavailable on most virtual MVPD services, including YouTube TV, Sling TV and Hulu, effectively restricting their subscribers for being able to watch NewsNation in any capacity after the promotional period ends.) On October 5, 2020, select Nexstar-run MyNetworkTV and independent stations—such as WMYT-TV/Charlotte and KAUT-TV/Oklahoma City—began offering preview simulcasts of the first hour of NewsNation.

When she returned to The Hague she continued her drawing lessons with the painter Albert Roelofs and became a member of the Pulchri Studio.Charlotte van Pallandt in the RKD On 18 September 1919 she married Joachim Adolph Zeyger, count of Regteren Limpurg and settled with him in Bern, though they divorced in 1924. After her divorce she moved to Lausanne and travelled with a friend to Paris, where she became a pupil of André Lhote in 1926 and was heavily influenced by his Cubism. During a break from school, she worked with Toon Dupuis in his workshop in the Hague and began sculpting. In 1928 she travelled around Italy and met the sculptors Albert Termote, Charles Despiau and Charles Malfray. From 1929 she stopped painting and took up sculpting as her main form of expression, working mostly in Amsterdam except for a year at the Académie Ranson as a pupil of Malfray in Paris in 1935. She won second prize at the Paris Exposition of 1937 for a portrait of her nephew Serge. When World War II began she moved back north and settled in Amsterdam in 1941 where she met the sculptors Piet Esser, Paul Grégoire, Cor Hund and Fred Carasso. Like them, she was a member of Arti et Amicitiae, and the NKVB (Dutch circle of sculptors). Through Carasso she met Truus Trompert, a nude model that served to inspire a series of \\"Truus-beeldjes\\". In 1948 she had her first exhibition at the gallery of Santee Landweer in Amsterdam, and thus experienced her break- through at age 50. She was a founding member of \\"De Zeester\\", a circle of women artists that included Jeanne Bieruma Oosting, Maaike Braat, Jeanne van Hall, Fri Heil, Ro Mogendorff and Liesbeth Dobbelmann. Career She is known for her portraits, which are mostly busts. In 1958 she was one of the Dutch representatives to the Venice Biennale and a year later she won the Prix de la Critique. When the Haarlem sculptor Mari Andriessen introduced her to the Haarlem painter Kees Verwey they became friends and the bust portrait she made of him in 1961 is in the collection of the Frans Hals museum. He also made a portrait of her in 1963.Charlotte van Pallandt and Kees Verwey: from one country estate to another on Codart She also made portraits of Queen Juliana, Peter Scharoff, Adriaan Roland Holst, Fred Carasso, Ro Mogendorff and Albert Termote.

It is estimated that there are more than 600,000 street children living in Bangladesh, 75% of them live in the nation's capital, Dhaka. In a country ranked 138th on the Human Development Index and where 50% of the population is living below the poverty line, these children represent the absolute lowest level in the social hierarchy, in the world's most densely populated nation. Nowadays the population in this country increased, and the number of street children has also increased to an estimated 4 million. Characteristics =Number= There is currently no official statistic of the number of street children in Bangladesh. It is nearly impossible to count their numbers as they increase by years. =Age= There is not any specific age of street children in Bangladesh. Some are 6–12 who sell things and some are 13–15 who do other jobs. Children under 5 can sometimes sell things or just roam around the streets. =Gender= Most of the female street children are married from the age of 10, which leads them into a very difficult life. Other male children have to work hard to run their families. Causes Homeless children left unattended The causes, are not hard to identify, but would be good to have studies and accurate information cited. The causes are lack of contraception, extreme poverty and how poverty transforms people and the child's meaning in parents' lives. Still greater cause of 'street children' is government neglect, dysfunction, and corruption. The street children have no particular living or sleeping place. They can sometimes be seen selling flowers on the street. Many of the street children in Bangladesh die young as they are not properly cared for. 110,000 children die of water-borne diseases annually each year. They are incapable of buying healthy foods. They sometimes eat foods which are not hygienic. Sometimes they will starve looking for food. Organized crime Street children often have to work. Some do so within the lower echelons of organized crime groups. Organized crime is prevalent in Dhaka. The bosses are called mastaans, and their groups operate in slums across the country and particularly in the capital. Criminologist, strategist and international consultant Sally Atkinson-Sheppard conducted an in-depth study about the involvement of street children in organized crime. Organizations for street children Street Children often do not have the means to earn money as they are not educated. Government organizations sometimes help them. Most often it is a non-government organization such as The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) that helps them. There are also some small non-government organizations such as Bangladesh Street Child Foundation, Street Children Activist Network, Ahsania Mission Children City, Children's Heaven, JAAGO Foundation, Bangladesh Street Child Organisation, Mojar School, Obhizatrik Foundation, SOMBHABONA, etc. in Bangladesh. Some organizations also requests other people to donate for the street children. INCIDIN Bangladesh has been working for the development of street children, especially those groups who are abused and exploited sexually. Along with the regular activities, the organization is happy to celebrate the International Street Children Day 2012 with the support of SCI. The International Day for Street Children was launched in 2011 by the Consortium for Street Children (CSC), the leading international network dedicated to realizing the rights of street children worldwide. The day is celebrated by street children, NGOs, policy makers, celebrities, corporate and individuals across the globe. Education The street children in Bangladesh are unable to go to school and as a result, they do not get proper education. It is very important for them to study as they will find themselves spending the rest of their lives miserably. The non-government organizations help them to be educated.

The IWA started at the Student’s International Union (SIU) in Geneva. The SIU had been established at the League of Nations during its 5th assembly, and the creation of the SIU was at the bequest of students at the nearby university of Geneva and an idea by Gilbert Murray. The IWA, in time, would grow to not only have the office in Geneva, but also have offices in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Salisbury, Connecticut. In 1941, due to the outbreak of World War II, the IWA was moved to the United States because of security concerns. The website for the IWA states as its mission statement that “IWA is a not-for-profit, non- governmental organization working across cultural and political boundaries to advance creative approaches to conflict analysis, conflict management, and post-conflict peace-building.” Foundation Maude and Alexander, met when the two of them founded the institution. Alexander was son to a well off family, whose father did not wish for him to go to college. Alexander did end up going to college, funded his education at Columbia University by “saving his allowance and depriving himself of luxuries.” Alexander had met Maude through his social work. Maude and Alexander had met two university students who were also interested in world affairs. The students were very interested in world peace and security, but they had no structure to understand the very issues they were so interested in. At this point the Hadden’s ended their honeymoon, and they returned to New York and began working on creating an International organization for students. The organization would become the IWA, and it would set out to give students experience and understanding of world politics. The IWA would end up becoming part of the Hadden’s legacy after their deaths in the early and mid-1900s, and in 1994 the IWA merged, in- part, with the Institute of Current World Affairs (ICWA). In-line with the mission of the IWA the ICWA site, “fostering understanding of the world by immersing promising individuals in the study of a country, region, or globally important issue and by sharing the benefits of their knowledge with society”, as their mission statement. Goals The school of thought of both the IWA and ICWA are mirrored. Although the IWA was geared more towards conflict resolution, conflict management, and post-conflict peacebuilding and the ICWA is more non-conflict oriented –as they do not send fellows to war zones or places where security is a concern--, both are designed to give real world knowledge to the students. The IWA seemed to be very conflict resolution and analysis oriented, whereas the ICWA seemed to be much more set-up for non- conflict everyday issues ranging from water sanitation to environmental issues. Supporting government agencies The governmental agencies which fund them in part. The list includes U.S. Joint Forces Command, Canadian Department of National Defence, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Federal Department of Foreign Affairs - Government of Switzerland, U.S. Agency for International Development, National Endowment for Democracy, and the U.S. Institute of Peace.

The route is also sometimes called Trans-Arctic Route. In contrast to the Northeast Passage (including the Northern Sea Route) and the Northwest Passage it largely avoids the territorial waters of Arctic states and lies in international high seas. The route is currently only navigable by heavy icebreakers. However, due to the increasing decline of Arctic sea ice extent, the route is slated to emerge as the predominant Arctic shipping route by 2030. The TSR is about long and offers significant distance savings between Europe and Asia. It is the shortest of the Arctic shipping routes. In contrast to the Northern Sea Route and the North-West Passage, which are both coastal routes, the TSR is a mid- ocean route and passes close to the North Pole. Due to high seasonal variability of ice conditions throughout the entire Arctic basin, the TSR will not exist as one fixed shipping lane, but will follow a number of navigational routes. The TSR passes outside the exclusive economic zones of Arctic coastal states making it of special geopolitical importance to countries looking towards the Arctic as a future trade route. While a number of legal disagreement and uncertainties revolve around both the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route, the TSR lies outside the territorial jurisdiction of any state. The Chinese icebreaker Snow Dragon was one of the first major vessels to utilize the route during its 2012 journey through the Arctic Ocean.

There are conflicting stories about how this happened. An official inquiry concluded he had shot himself in the heart three times at the end of a police chase. According to Ukrainian MP Oles Doniy, a group of unknown armed people arrived in three Volkswagen minivans and kidnapped Muzychko and five other people from a café near Rivne. They murdered Muzychko behind the café with two gunshots to the heart. In another telling of Doniy's account, a group of attackers forced Muzychko to halt his car, pulled him out of the vehicle, handcuffed him and shot him. According to the interior ministry of Ukraine, Muzychko died in a shoot-out with police in a café in Rivne. According to the ministry, the police raided the café to arrest Muzychko, but he opened fire while he tried to flee. He was shot when the police returned fire. The police were able to capture him and three others, but by the time the paramedics had arrived at the scene, he had died. On 25 March, police stated that Muzychko had shot himself. This was confirmed by an inquiry by the interior ministry, who concluded he had shot himself in the heart as police tried to bring him to the ground after a chase. The inquiry also concluded he had fired previously, resulting in a scratch on his skin, and that the police had acted lawfully. Reacting to the news about shooting Dmytro Yarosh leader of Right Sector, called for resignation of Interior Minister Arsen Avakov and the arrest of the police officers who came after Muzychko.

Anna was a daughter of the ruler of Epirus, Michael II Komnenos Doukas, and his wife, Theodora. In 1258, she was married to the Prince of Achaea, William II of Villehardouin, at Patras, while her sister Helena was married to Manfred of Hohenstaufen, King of Sicily. These marriages were part of a web of alliances directed against the Empire of Nicaea, whose expansion threatened both the interests of the Epirote ruler, who claimed the Byzantine imperial heritage for himself, and the very existence of the Latin states of Greece. The diplomatic and military manoeuvring that followed led to the eventual defeat of the Epirote–Latin alliance in the Battle of Pelagonia in 1259. Anna, after the imprisonment of William by the Roman Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos, assumed the regency of the Principality of Achaea and tried to organise the resistance of Frankish Greece against the onslaught of the victorious eastern Roman troops. She also called all the noble ladies of Morea, at the absence of their husbands, to a convent in her palaces at Nikli, urging them to find a common solution for the future of Morea, with her presiding over the discussion. This event is known as \\"the Parliament of the Ladies\\" (Παλαρμάς των Κυράδων). Anna was William's third wife. William was childless with his first two wives, but Anna bore him two daughters, Isabella and Margaret. After William II's death in 1278, per the Treaty of Viterbo, the princely title passed to the King of Sicily, Charles of Anjou. Anna inherited the Villehardouins' patrimonial domain, the Barony of Kalamata, and the fortress of Chlemoutsi, which she had received as a dowry from William. She also became guardian of her youngest daughter Margaret, while Isabella had been married to Charles' son Philip and had gone to Italy, where she remained even after her husband died in 1277. In 1280, Anna married a second time, to the rich lord of one half of Thebes, Nicholas II of Saint Omer. This worried King Charles, who was uneasy to see Chlemoutsi, the strongest castle in Achaea, and Kalamata, which comprised some of the principality's most fertile lands, in the hands of an already powerful vassal. Thus, after negotiations, in 1282 Anna exchanged her possessions with lands elsewhere in Messenia.

It was directed by Klaus Härö and written by Anna Heinämaa. Filming began in Estonia in late February 2014. The film was selected as the Finnish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards, making the December shortlist of nine films, but it was not nominated. The Fencer was also nominated for the Golden Globe award in the Best Foreign Language Film category as a Finnish/German/Estonian co-production. The Fencer was released in the U.S. by CFI Releasing in 2017. Plot The introductory screens set the background of the film: during the Second World War, Estonia was occupied by Nazi Germany, who drafted most of the men into the German army, and then occupied by the Soviet Union, who considered soldiers of the German army criminals. Following the war, the Soviets incorporated Estonia into the USSR. A young man, Endel Nelis, arrives in Haapsalu, Estonia (then part of the Soviet Union) in the early 1950s, having left Leningrad to escape the secret police. He finds work as a teacher and founds a sports club for his students, where he starts teaching them his great passion – fencing. Disapproving, the school's principal starts investigating Endel’s background. Meanwhile, Endel's friend (and coach) Aleksei warns him not to return to Leningrad under any circumstances. Fencing becomes a form of self-expression for the children, and Endel becomes a role model and father figure. He learns to love the children, many of whom have been orphaned. When the children want to participate in a national fencing tournament in Leningrad, Endel must make a choice; risk everything to take the children to Leningrad or put his safety first and disappoint them.

She has written for Time Out, The New Statesman, The Independent and The Independent on Sunday. Her poems have been read on BBC Radio 3 and BBC Radio 4 and recorded for The Poetry Sound Archive. The Poetry Society's only official Public Art Poet, her poem 'Eurydice' was commissioned by the Arts Council and the British Film Institute for the walls of the underpass that leads to the IMAX cinema. This formed part of the regeneration of the South Bank designed by architect Bryan Avery. In 2009 the poem was painted over and then a campaign was launched to restore the poem on the walls of the underpass. Hubbard's novel Rainsongs was published in 2018 Duckworth London and Overlook NY. Hubbard has described it as 'a novel about my abiding themes: love, loss and redemption'.  Background and career  Hubbard was born in London and grew up in Surrey, the eldest of three children, where she attended Claremont School and then Queen’s College, Harley Street, London. Her first job was as a publishing assistant at Pergamon Press Oxford, after which she worked for the National Book League in Albemarle Street, leaving to start her own antique business specialising in 18th and 19th century jewellery. In 1984, Hubbard moved back to London where she started her career as an art critic writing, first for Time Out, then for The Independent and The New Statesman. In 1994 she published her first poetry collection and completed her Masters of Arts in Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia. Hubbard's poetry collection The Forgetting and Remembering of Air was described by Ellen Bell in the New Welsh Review as 'a stunning piece of work – an achingly moving narrative of love for a child, parent, sibling, lover or icon' Hubbard has appeared on BBC Radio’s Kaleidoscope, Front Row, The Verb and Poetry Please, and regularly appears on Sky News as an art critic. She has twice been a Hawthornden Fellow.  Reception for Rainsongs  Hubbard's third novel was described as an 'elegiac story of loss and valediction' by The Guardian. Martina Evans of the Irish Times said 'Hubbard’s precise descriptions of the physical landscape are tremendous and moving.' A review in the London Magazine describes the novel as having 'a unique and beautiful emotive quality that shines through its delicately constructed prose.'

It is a remake of the 2012 Dutch film Achtste Groepers Huilen Niet, which was based on the book Achtste-groepers huilen niet by Jacques Vriens. English translation by Google Translate The movie stars Mia Helene Solberg Brekke, who portrays Anja, a teen with cancer. Plot Anja (Mia Helene Solberg Brekke) is an energetic young girl that absolutely adores soccer, despite her classmate Jonas bullying her and telling her that it's not a girl's sport. She continues on unabated, unaware that this is just his way of trying to express his feelings of love for her. However things take a tragic turn when Anja discovers that she has leukemia, which requires treatment and hospitalization that will keep her from entering a school soccer tournament. This devastates her, and it's up to Jonas and Anja's friends Lars and Lisa to come up with a way to allow Anja to play. Cast * Mia Helene Solberg Brekke as Anja * Victor Papadopoulos Jacobsen as Jonas * Jeppe Beck Laursen Doctor Bart Soundtrack #In Your Arms by Nico & Vinz #Younger by Julie Bergan #Midnattssol by Shaun Bartlett Development and filming The film received subsidy of 6,800,000 Norwegian kroner in 2013 from the Norwegian Film Institute. Reception Critical reception for Kule kidz gråter ikke has been mostly positive and much of the praise centered upon Launing's directing and how the film approached the subject of cancer as it applies to children. The NRK and Verdens Gang marked this as a highlight of the film, and Verdens Gang further noted that the movie did not suffer from the stiffness or awkwardness that typically accompanied remakes of popular films. The paper later went on to remark that the movie had been very popular in Norway and by early April, had sold over 100,000 tickets, which they credited to the film's delivery of the subject matter. Bergens Tidende commented that one of the film's strong points was that it told the story from the perspective of children as opposed to adults and that it tried to approach the film's subject in a realistic manner, which meant that things would not end with everything solved neatly. =Awards= *ECFA Award at BUFF International Film Festival in Malmö (2014, won) *Honorable mention at TIFF Kids (2014) *Starboy Prize at Oulu International Children's and Youth Film Festival (2014) References External links * Category:2014 films Category:2010s comedy-drama films Category:Norwegian films Category:Norwegian drama films Category:Norwegian-language films Category:Norwegian children's films Category:Films set in Norway Category:Films based on Dutch novels Category:2014 comedy films Category:2014 drama films ","title":"Kule kidz gråter ikke"},{"id":"42146076","text":"The Karama Armoured Warfare Training School (KAWATS), is an Armoured Warfare Training School in Uganda, East Africa.

In that same session, Davis voted to table Amendment 4 on HB1 - meaning that the public education budget would be cut by $800,000,000. = Crime = Davis authored and passed a bill which strengthened the ability of prosecutors to pursue child pornography cases. = Health care = Davis is the only pro-choice Republican in the Texas legislature and has earned the endorsement of Planned Parenthood in previous races. In 2011, Davis voted against a bill to require physicians to conduct intra-vaginal sonograms, prior to even pharmaceutically induced abortions, citing her opposition to legislative interference in the doctor-patient relationship. Davis likened this legislation to the government takeover of the doctor-patient relationship by ObamaCare, and as a Republican who believes in limited government, personal freedom and individual responsibility, Davis said the government should not practice medicine. Davis voted for a bill that prohibits the state from funding facilities that perform abortions. In 2013, she voted against a bill that increases abortion facility requirements, regulates the administration of abortion inducing drugs, and prohibits abortions after 20 weeks of gestation. Davis stated at the time that the bill constituted a de facto ban on abortions and would not withstand constitutional scrutiny. During the 2013 debate on the abortion restriction bill, Davis offered an amendment to the abortion bill which retained the 20-week ban, but which deleted the unconstitutional facility restrictions, and instead incorporated exceptions for cases of rape, incest, danger to the mother's life and severe fetal abnormalities. The facility restrictions in the bill were found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. = Other = Davis has been named a \\"Fighter for Free Enterprise\\" by the Texas Association of Business. She voted to permanently exempt small businesses from paying the state margins tax. Davis voted to require drug screening of those seeking unemployment benefits. She voted to require photo identification to vote, voted to end sanctuary cities and she voted to fund increased border security. = Gubernatorial dispute = After Davis clashed with Governor Greg Abbott in the 2017 summer special session, Governor Abbott gave his first endorsement of the 2018 election cycle to her primary opponent Susanna Dokupil. Abbott has been an active and vocal opponent of Davis' campaign, even saying that Davis \\"completely disregards her very own constituents and puts her own personal, petty politics ahead of the greater good for the people of the state of Texas.\\" Political group ratings In 2017, the interest group Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, founded by Michael Quinn Sullivan, scored her at 32 percent and rated her as one of the top 10 Worst Legislators of 2017.

In the Upanishads this word is used to mean 'subtle connections' or 'canals of subtle energies', or particular 'nerves' or 'veins'. The journey to the heart is said to be through seventy-two thousand subtle channels called Hitā; they are the beneficent active veins (filled with different types of serums). Dilemma of Balaki Proud Balaki skilled in expounding, eloquent, went to Ajatsatru, the King of Benares, to impart superior wisdom to him which he knew only as the conditioned Brahman; he knew about the physical and physiological categories and therefore, the king soon realized that Balaki did not know about Brahman. Balaki was not aware of the fact that whatever he knew was the result of ignorance, that the results of ignorance, being finite things, are separated from him. Ajatsatru then tells Balaki Gargya that reality is to be found in the deep-sleep-consciousness. Pippalada, the sage of the Prashna Upanishad, holds that sleep is caused by the senses being absorbed in that highest 'sensorium' the mind, which is why in deep sleep man is not able to hear, not to see, nor to smell because the mind is then merged into an ocean of light. Doctrine of deep-sleep-consciousness Sankara explains that Balaki knew only about those phases of Brahman that consist of name, form and action which have to be known in the sphere of ignorance. Therefore, in the context of deep-sleep-consciousness, Ajatsatru reiterates that the being full of consciousness in sleep absorbs the functions of the organs through its own consciousness and lies in Akasha that is in the heart. The heart is the seat of the intellect, the internal organ, and the other or external organs are subject to that intellect abiding in the heart. What is seen in a dream are not the attributes of the self. That conscious being, who has identified itself with action, its factors and its results due to the limitations of name and form and is superimposed by ignorance, virtually comes back to the body in the manner described in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad:- :अथ यदा सुषुप्तो भवति, यदा न कस्यचन वेद, हिता नाडयो द्वासप्ततिः सहस्त्राणि ह्र्द्यत्पुरिततमभिप्रतिष्ठन्ते, :ताभिः प्रत्यवसृप्य पुरीतति शेते; स यथा कुमारो वा महाराजो वा महाब्राह्मणो वाति ध्नीमानन्दस्य गत्वा शयीत, एवमेवैष एतच्छेते २.१.१९ :\\"Again when it becomes fast asleep – when it does not know anything – it comes back along the seventy-two thousand nerves called Hitā, which extend from the heart to the pericardium (the whole body), and remains in the body. As a baby, or an emperor, or a noble Brahmana lives, having attained the acme of bliss, so does it remain.\\" – (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad II.i.19) :…अस्यैता हिता नाम नाडयोऽन्तर्ह्रदये प्रतिष्ठिता भवन्ति, एताभिर्वा एतदास्त्रवतिः तस्मादेष प्रविविक्ताहारतर इवैव भवत्यस्माच्छारिरादत्मनः ४.२.३ :\\".. In this body there are nerves called Hitā, which are placed in the heart. Through these the essence of our food passes at it moves on. Therefore the subtle body has finer food than the gross body.\\" – (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad II.i.19) :ता व अस्यैता हिता नाम नाडयो यथा केशः सहस्त्रधा भिन्नस्तावताणिम्ना तिष्ठन्ति, शुक्लस्य नीलस्य पिङ्गलस्य हरितस्य लोहितस्य पूर्णा;....४.३.२० :\\"In him are those nerves called Hitā, which are as fine as a hair split into a thousand parts, and filled with white, blue, brown, green and red (serums). (They are the seat of the subtle body in which impressions are stored)…\\" – (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad II.i.19) The experience of the waking state is seen in dreams. The Taijasa is nourished by finer food than the Vaisvanara. And, ignorance is not the natural characteristic of the self. All impressions due to the experience of high and low attributes of the relative universe are centred in the subtle body where they are stored. Implication Swami Nikhilananda explains that the self that functions in the 'waking state' is Vaisvanara, which in the 'dream state' is Taijasa and in the 'dreamless-sleep state', Prajna; Viraj (matter) unites with this self identified with Indra in dreams when there is no distinction between the experiencer and the object of experience. In deep sleep the Atman, limited by Prana or vital breath, is called Prajna. The subtle body in which the impressions that are stored in the body owing to the contact with the serums filled in the Hitā undergoes modifications under the influence of past merit and demerit, and in dreams falsely manifests itself as impressions in a variety of forms. When ignorance is eliminated and knowledge reaches its perfection, the state of identity with all ('liberation') is attained.

The creek is designated as an impaired waterbody, with the cause of the impairment being siltation and the source being agriculture. It has a daily sediment load of . The main surficial rock types in the creek's watershed include shale, carbonate, and sandstone. The creek is in the ridge and valley physiographic province. The main land uses in the watershed of Turtle Creek are forested land and agriculture. However, low- intensity development, wetlands, and grass/turf also occur within the watershed. The area in the creek's vicinity was settled as early as the late 1760s and various mills were built along it in the late 18th century. A number of bridges have been constructed across it. The drainage basin of the creek is designated as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Its riparian buffer is absent in some reaches. Course Turtle Creek looking upstream Turtle Creek begins in a shallow valley in Limestone Township. It flows east for several tenths of a mile, almost immediately entering Buffalo Township. The creek then turns north for several tenths of a mile and enters a much broader valley and receiving an unnamed tributary from the left. At this point, it turns east-northeast for several miles, entering East Buffalo Township and receiving three unnamed tributaries from the right. The creek then turns east- southeast and its valley becomes narrower. Over the next few miles, it receives one unnamed tributary from the left and three more from the right. It eventually crosses US Route 15 and turns northeast. A short distance further downstream, it reaches its confluence with the West Branch Susquehanna River. Turtle Creek joins the West Branch Susquehanna River upriver of its mouth. Hydrology and climate Various stream reaches in the watershed of Turtle Creek are designated as impaired. The cause of the impairment is siltation and the source of the impairment is agriculture. A total of of streams in the watershed are impaired. Most of these are in the middle reaches of the watershed. The daily load of sediment in Turtle Creek is . This equates to an annual sediment load of . The total maximum daily load for the creek requires a 37.2 percent reduction in the sediment load. A total of of sediment per year comes from croplands and another per year comes from streambanks. A total of per year comes from forested land, comes from hay and pastures, comes from transitional land, and comes from low-intensity development. No sediment comes from The average annual rate of rainfall in the watershed of Turtle Creek over a 23-year period was found to be . The average annual rate of runoff was . The runoff curve number in the watershed of Turtle Creek is 87 for transitional lands and wetlands, 83 for low-intensity development, 82 for croplands, 75 for hay and pastures, 73 for forests, and 71 for grassy land. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Turtle Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The elevations in the watershed range from approximately above sea level. The watershed of Turtle Creek is in the ridge and valley physiographic province. The creek's valley is in the lowlands of Union County. Erosion occurs along certain streambanks in the creek's watershed. A total of 55 percent of the surface geology in the watershed of Turtle Creek is shale. A total of 30 percent is carbonate and the remaining 15 percent is sandstone. The most prevalent hydrologic soil groups are C (80 percent) and B (20 percent). The K factor, a measure of the erodability of soil, is 0.249 in the forested land of the creek's watershed, 0.272 in the watershed's wetlands, 0.275 in hay or pastures and land classified by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection as \\"low-intensity development\\", 0.277 in transitional land, 0.28 in grassy areas, and 0.292 in agricultural lands. Groundwater from a ridge known as Shamokin Mountain contributes to Turtle Creek. Iron ore was observed on the creek by the 1800s. This ore was pinkish and has been described as \\"compact, coarse, siliceous\\". It resembled ores from near Danville. A soil known as the Crestmore silt loam occurs in small areas near the creek.

However, its source is in the quadrangle of Lewisburg. There are of streams in the watershed Agriculture is the most common land use in the watershed of Turtle Creek, making up 47.1 percent of its area. Forested land is a close second, making up 45.6 percent of the watershed's area. Less common land uses include low-intensity development (6.9 percent), wetlands (0.3 percent), and turf/grass (0.1 percent). The watershed of Turtle Creek is longer along the east-west axis than the north-south axis. It is entirely within Union County, though it occupies a fairly small portion of the county. Adjacent major watersheds include those of Buffalo Creek, Penns Creek, Limestone Run, and the West Branch Susquehanna River. History Turtle Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1189973. The creek received its name some time before 1769. Samuel Maclay carried out a survey in the vicinity of Turtle Creek in early March 1769. Several more surveys were done near the creek in that year. John Wilson had settled near the mouth of the creek by the fall of that year. In 1770, William Speddy settled approximately of its mouth. Some kind of mill on the creek was owned by a member of the Wilson family as early as 1771. In 1772, John Aurand settled at the mouth of the creek and constructed a gristmill and a sawmill there in the same year. The mill eventually came to be known as Jenkins Mill. Christopher Weiser's fulling mill was constructed on Turtle Creek in 1792. It later came to be owned by Peter Wolfe. In 1795, Anna M. Smith left 30 pounds in her will to the construction of a school for poor children at the mouth of the creek. In 1842, iron ore was discovered downstream of its mouth. In 1853, several people from Lewisburg purchased of land to the south of the mouth of Turtle Creek and set up the Union Furnace. Thomas Follmer, Henry Follmer, and William Gundy drowned at the mouth of the creek in 1846. A concrete tee beam bridge carrying US Route 15 was constructed over Turtle Creek in 1930 and repaired in 1962. It is long and is situated north of Winfield. A prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying T-432/Stein Lane over the creek was built in 1932 and repaired in 1984. It is south of Linntown and is long. A bridge of a similar type was constructed over the creek for US Route 15 in 1962 and repaired in 2005. This bridge is long and is situated north of Winfield. In 1983, a concrete culvert bridge was constructed over the creek east of Mifflinburg. It is long and carries State Route 2004. A prestressed box beam or girders bridge known as County Bridge #10 was built across the creek south- southeast of Linntown in 1989. with a length of . A bridge of the same type was constructed over the creek southwest of Linntown in 2000, with a length of . Turtle Creek was described as a \\"[stream] of major concern\\" in the Union County Open Space and Recreation Plan in 1973. In late 20th century, the Union County: A Plan for Development recommended the creation of a greenway along the floodplain of Turtle Creek, running westward from the West Branch Susquehanna River. Biology Path in Turtle Creek Park The drainage basin of Turtle Creek is designated as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. In the 1930s, the creek was noted in the Pennsylvania Angler to be a viable spot for sucker fishing. The riparian buffers of Turtle Creek are diminished or completely absent in the areas where the creek flows through agricultural land. Cattle are also allowed access to the creek in some places. A park known as the Turtle Creek Park is located in the vicinity of Turtle Creek. It is a popular destination for local walkers. Numerous successional habitats occur within the park.

The hospital is named after Mazhar Osman, who is also considered as the founder of modern psychiatry in Turkey. History It was established with the initiative of Dr. Mazhar Osman (1884–1951) and approval of Minister of Health Refik Saydam (1881–1942) in the premises of Reşadiye Barracks at Bakırköy, Istanbul on October 15, 1924. It was an extension of Toptaşı Asylum, which was situated inside the Atik Valide Complex in Üsküdar on the Asian side of the city. After the completion of the mental hospital in Bakırköy on June 15, 1927 and transfer of all the inpatients, Toptaşı Asylum closed. The facility in Bakırköy was initially named Istanbul Hospital of Mental Disorders and Neurology (). The hospital was further developed by Fahrettin Kerim Gökay (1900–1987), Şükrü Hazım Tiner, Ahmet Şükrü Emed and İhsan Şükrü Aksel (1899–1987), who all were students of Mazhar Osman. Main departments of the hospital was psychiatry, neurology and neurosurgery. Mazhar Osman, who served as the hospital's chief physician until 1940, is the first in Turkey to apply brain surgery. With worsening of the economic situation in Turkey during the 1940s, the number of patients rose from 3,000 up to 5,000. Due to insufficient state budget, no other institutions could be established. These conditions led to the circumstance that many inpatients had to share the same beds. As a result, the mortality in the hospital increased. The hospital complex underwent structural improvements such as in landscaping and renovation of the buildings. The inner courtyard was encircled by a –long wall. A copy of Auguste Rodin's famous statue The Thinker was placed inside the courtyard, which became a symbol of psychiatry in Turkey. A second storey was added to some of wards. In the 1960s, modern psychiatry methods were put into service. Inpatients were inspired to join newly established various workshops for handcraft and outdoor sporting activities. Three types of treatment conditions were formed as open door, semi-open door and closed door services. As a remedy to the existing problem of overcapacity bedding, a mental health dispensary was opened in Istanbul, which was followed by more units throughout the city in later years. In the 1980s, emphasis was placed on outpatient services by founding an outpatient psychiatric therapy unit as a countermeasure to the increasing number of patients. The number of inpatients could be held limited through shortened bedding time by speedy examination and effective treatment, as well as discharge of patients with better conditions outside. Efforts of the Chief physician Yıldırım Aktuna (1930–2007) in fundraising played a major role in the improvement of the hospital's treatment and healthcare facilities. In addition, scientific activities were initiated also in the hospital. In the 1990s, the scientific work, which began in the former decade, continued when new services and equipment were introduced diversifying the specialization areas in psychiatry, neurology and neurosurgery. The \\"International Bakırköy Days\\" were organized and brought to international level up. Today The 2000s saw the establishment of many new units such as the centers for mood disorder, drug addiction therapy, sleep and epilepsy research and psychotic disorder as well as therapy and training centers for children and adolescents, for adolescents and young adults. Currently, the Bakırköy Psychiatric Hospital is the country's largest and most developed health facility for mental disorders and neurology. It is also an important scientific institution in clinic research. Physician assistants are educated in the neurology clinic since the department's foundation in 1927. Ten academic staff personnel serve in the neurology clinic. Museum The hospital hosts a museum opened in 2008. It offers the history of the hospital with documents and photographs in chronological order. Personal belongings of Mazhar Osman, his books and a surgery logbook of him from 1934 are on display. Among other exhibits are a straitjacket, used to restrain a patient from causing harm to himself or others, an electroshock device used in electroconvulsive therapy and drug bottles used in early years. The museum is open to public on weekdays between 10:00 and 15:30 hours local time, and admission is free of charge.

This policy arose from a two-year enquiry that had begun in 1836 and included Macaulay among its members. As another strand of the policy, these new prisons were governed by police inspectors rather than, as previously, being under the control of district collectors. It was deemed that the collectors' many and varied other responsibilities caused them to have little time to oversee matters relating to the prison system but in due course it was also found that the police officers were similarly affected and thus dedicated prison superintendents were introduced. The change in responsibility caused members of the Indian Medical Service to take over from those of the Indian Civil Service and reflected the enquiry's concern regarding prison conditions, which it had considered to be chaotic, arbitrary, unsanitary and disease-ridden and the cause of high death rates. Despite these progressive conclusions, which also created a two-tier designation of \\"simple imprisonment\\" and \\"rigorous imprisonment\\", the principal purpose of the central prisons remained that of punishment rather than rehabilitation, with prisoners kept occupied in the performance of dull, repetitive tasks and with no provision for education or reward for good behaviour. An outbreak of anthrax in December 1905 among people working with wool at the jail caused seven deaths. Bareilly Central Jail housed various political prisoners during the British Raj era, including Yashpal, whose marriage on 7 August 1936 while imprisoned there was the first such ceremony in an Indian jail. The perceived humanising touch to the strictures of imprisonment led to a change in prison manuals, effectively preventing any further such events. An early study of homosexuality among male prisoners in India, published by S. P. Srivastava in 1974, indicated that 10–15 percent of inmates at Bareilly were situational and habitual homosexuals and 3 per cent were \\"committed\\" thus.

Who's Who in Egyptology. London: Egypt Exploration Society Biography Bradbury was born in Ashton- under-Lyne, near Manchester, UK, to Elizabeth Ann Tomlins and businessman Charles Timothy Bradbury. Bradbury was among the early supporters of the Egypt Exploration Fund (EEF), founded in 1882 to support British excavations in Egypt. Her friend, the journalist and traveller Amelia Edwards, was a founder member of the EEF, and in 1890 Bradbury accompanied her on a lecture tour of America, where Edwards was promoting and fundraising for the EEF. She was a Committee member and one of the Fund's local secretaries, helping to gather subscriptions in Britain on the Fund's behalf.Petrie, W. M. F. 1901-1902. Archaeological Report (Egypt Exploration Fund), p. 37 When Edwards died in 1892, Bradbury became her executrix. In her will Edwards gave her collection of Egyptian antiquities to University College London. She had also provided the funding for the Edwards Professor of Egyptian Archaeology and Philology to be established. The archaeologist William Matthew Flinders Petrie was the first postholder.Janssen, R. 1992. The First Hundred Years: Egyptology at University College London. London: University College London A former student of Petrie's, Francis Llewellyn Griffith came to UCL to teach ancient Egyptian language.Simpson, R. S. 2004-2014. Griffith, Francis Llewellyn (1862-1934). Oxford Dictionary of National Biography [Online edn] Kate Bradbury continued to contribute to Egyptology. She provided additional display cases to house the Edwards Collection at UCL, and coordinated unpacking the antiquities and placing them in the cases. She married Griffith in 1896, and collaborated with him in translations of ancient Egyptian texts, which were published in the multi-volume work A Library of the World's Great Literature (Vol 9, 1896). She also translated Dr Alfred Wiedemann's Egyptian Doctrine of Immortality (1895) and Religion of the Ancient Egyptians (1897) into English from German. Bradbury Griffith helped Norman de Garis Davies to become a copyist on Petrie's excavation at Dendera for the 1897/1898 season.Strudwick, N. 2004. Nina M. Davies: A Biographical Sketch. Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, 90 p 195 The Griffiths lived together in the home of Kate's father, near Manchester. Griffith was appointed to the post of Honorary Professor of Egyptology at Manchester University. However, Bradbury Griffith continued her relationship with UCL, providing funding for the Edwards Library, which held a growing collection of Egyptology books. She died in March, 1902.
