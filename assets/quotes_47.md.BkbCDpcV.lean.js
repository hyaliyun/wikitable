She studied art in New York under Harry Siddons Mowbray and in Paris at Acad√©mie Julian under Jules Joseph Lefebvre and Lucien Simon. After that, she established studios in New York and Connecticut, where she worked as a portrait painter and children's book illustrator. She married Hyozo Omori, a Japanese exchange student, in 1907 and moved with him to Japan, where they established the Yurin En settlement house to provide educational and recreational opportunities to the poor in Tokyo. They were leaders in the Japanese playground movement. Hyozo Omori died in 1913, and Shepley continued running the center. She also translated Diaries of Court Ladies of Old Japan with Kochi Doi in 1920. Artist Shepley studied art under Harry Siddons Mowbray in New York. In Paris, she studied at Acad√©mie Julian under Jules Joseph Lefebvre and Lucien Simon. She established a studio in New York and later in Connecticut, where she painted portraits and illustrated children's books. Shepley exhibited her painting Work and Play at the Palace of Fine Arts and The Wonderful Story at the Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Other paintings that were representative of her work were Portrait of Artist's Niece (Rosamund Sargeant) and Portrait of a Young Woman. Portrait and Study of a Head were exhibited at the annual Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts exhibition held from December 1896 through February 1897. At that time, she lived at 96 Fifth Avenue in New York City. She exhibited a painting entitled Echo in 1897 at the Art Club of Philadelphia. About a dozen of her works were shown in a New York gallery owned by William Clausen in 1905.

He came to the US as a YMCA exchange student who studied in Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1908, after his return to Japan, he introduced basketball to the country. Hyozo Omori became dedicated to welfare work and Shepley was described as someone \\"with delicate refinement, high idealism, and scholarly outlook, she found all the elements of happiness.\\" In Tokyo, they established a community center, Yurin En (House of the Friendly Neighbor) which offered drama lessons and a playground for children. It also offered courses in sewing, flower arranging, cooking, and crafts as well as mother's meetings and opportunities for people to speak English. Initially, they met resistance because of their co-educational programs, the fact that the Omoris were Christian, and that they broke down well-established class barriers. In 1913, after her husband's death Shepley continued running Yurin En, becoming a leader in the Japanese playground movement. She translated Diaries of Court Ladies of Old Japan in 1920. The book, published with Kochi Doi, combined a translation of The Diary of Lady Murasaki with that of Izumi Shikibu (The Izumi Shikibu nikki) and of the Sarashina nikki. Their translation had an introduction by Amy Lowell. A more recent English translation was published by Richard Bowring in 1982.

Women in Early Christianity : Translations from Greek Texts. Washington, DC, USA: Catholic University of America Press, 2012. Pg. 117. ProQuest ebrary. More often than not, the woman would move into the house of the man, and they would live as brother and sister, both committed to the continuation of their vows of chastity. The women who entered into a spiritual marriage were known as subintroductae (\\"those brought in covertly\\"), agapetae (\\"beloved ones\\"), and syneisaktoi (\\"those brought into the house together\\").Miller, Women in Early Christianity. 117-118 This practice emerged around the 2nd century CE, and survived into the Middle Ages, despite being condemned by numerous church leaders, writers, and councils. Emergence The practice of asceticism grew in the early years of Christianity due to the teachings of both Paul the Apostle and Jesus Christ, who suggested that a celibate life was the best way to prepare for life in the Kingdom of God.Castelli, Elizabeth. \\"Virginity and Its Meaning for Women's Sexuality in Early Christianity.\\" Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion 2, no. 1 (Spring, 1986): 65. Accessed March 6, 2015. https://www.jstor.org/stable/25002030. It may have also emerged as an alternative to martyrdom, so that the faithful could reach the Kingdom of Heaven and receive their rewards in the afterlife without giving their lives. It became more and more popular as Christianity became accepted and legalized in the Roman Empire and martyrdoms became less frequent.Castelli. \\"Virginity and Its Meaning for Women's Sexuality in Early Christianity.\\" 67. Virginity became a favoured alternative to earthly marriage, promoted by writers such as Eusebius of Emesa and Jerome, all of whom saw marriage as promoting evil, quarrels, and the road to sin and suffering.Castelli. \\"Virginity and Its Meaning for Women's Sexuality in Early Christianity.\\" 69. Virginity emerged as a popular practice for women around the 2nd century CE, although it became more fully developed during the next couple of centuries, and it became \\"constructed as a form of liberation not only from the strictures of marriage and childbearing, but also from physical passion and materiality\\",Miller, Women in Early Christianity. 78 which were considered sinful and dangerous to the soul. One issue that many ascetic virgins, especially women, came across was how they were to live once they denounced marriage and earthly pleasures. Some independently wealthy women were able to seclude themselves on their estates, others were supported by family, but many had no means with which to support themselves. Monasteries for women were a later development; in the 2nd century CE there would have been very few in existence. Thus, spiritual marriage may have emerged as a solution to this problem. An ascetic woman would have gone to live with an ascetic man in his house, living as brother and sister in a sort of unofficial marriage.Miller, Women in Early Christianity. 118 Spiritual marriages would have also offered a rare opportunity for a man and a woman to engage in an emotionally and spiritually intimate friendship, something that was next to unheard of in the ancient world, in which it was believed that men and women could never be friends, as friendship implied parity, and the sexes were not considered equal.Clark, Elizabeth A. \\"John Chrysostom and the \\"Subintroductae\\"\\" Church History 46, no. 2 (1977): 183. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3165004. Thus, spiritual marriages would have been a desirable option for both ascetic men and women. Condemnation Despite the appeal of spiritual marriages, subintroductae and the practice itself were continuously condemned by various councils, writers, and theologians. John 20:17 was one New Testament verse that was used as evidence that spiritual marriage was not endorsed by Christ, as Jesus pushes away Mary Magdelene with the command \\"touch me not\\".Clark. \\"John Chrysostom and the \\"Subintroductae\\"\\"172. Various other authorities and texts were used, with writers building upon earlier arguments in response to the flourishing practice. =Councils= The earliest council to condemn the virgines subintroductae and the practice of spiritual marriage was the Council of Antioch (268), and this stance was reiterated at the Synod of Elvira in 300 (Canon 27: \\"a bishop or any other clergy may have living with him only a sister or a virgin daughter dedicated to God; by no means shall he keep any woman unrelated to him\\".Hefele, Karl Joseph von, Joseph Hergenr√∂ther, Alois Kn√∂pfler, and Henri Leclercq. 1907. Histoire des conciles d'apr√®s les documents originaux. 236. Paris: Letouzey et An√©. http://www.llmcdigital.org/default.aspx?redir=87181.), at Ancyra in 317, and at the First Council of Nicaea in 325. Nicaea denounces spiritual marriage in its third canon, which forbids any clergy member from living with a woman unless she is a relative.Jurgens, W.A. \\"First Council of Nicaea.\\" In The Faith of the Early Fathers: Pre-Nicene and Nicene Eras, 283. Liturgical Press, 1970. Decrees against spiritual marriage and the subintroductae continued to be issued by various authorities all over Europe until the Middle Ages Clark. \\"John Chrysostom and the \\"Subintroductae\\"\\". 173. =Writers= Church writers and theologians also spoke out against the practice of spiritual marriage, more often than not condemning it. Those who wrote about this subject include Athanasius of Alexandria, Jerome, Eusebius of Emesa, Gregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom, among others. =Athanasius of Alexandria= Athanasius of Alexandria was a fourth century writer who wrote two letters on the subject of virginity. The second letter is addressed to a group of virgins newly returned from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He gives advice on how to continue their ascetic lives properly, including a section on spiritual marriage. Here, he condemns the practice of spiritual marriage and of the subintroductae, suggesting that it is a betrayal of the Bridegroom Christ to whom all virgins devote their life to when they take their vows of chastity. He mentions those virgins who \\"dare[d] even to live and mix with men, not considering such a great danger or how easy it is to fall in this life\\" Miller, Patricia Cox. \\"Athanasius of Alexandria: Second Letter to Virgins (selections).\\" In Women in Early Christianity: Translations from Greek Texts, 118-123. Washington, DC.: Catholic University of America Press, 2012. and goes on to call on women to abandon their practice of spiritual marriage, \\"lest you break your covenant with the heavenly bridegroom\\".\\"Athanasius of Alexandria: Second Letter to Virgins (selections).\\" in Women in Early Christianity. 120. =John Chrysostom= John Chrysostom, another fourth-century writer, wrote two treatises on the subject of spiritual marriage, both condemning the practice. He suggests that living together chastely will only intensify lust for one another, as it is never satisfied by sexual intercourse (\\"sexual desire...serves to still passion and often leads the man to satiation... But with a virgin, nothing of this sort happens...the men who live with them are stirred by a double desire\\"\\"John Chrysostom: Instruction and Refutation Against Those Men Living With Virgins.\\" Translated by Patricia Cox Miller. Women in Early Christianity: Translations from Greek Texts, 124-125. Washington, DC.: Catholic University of America Press, 2012.), and that it was not spiritual love but lust that drew these couples together; \\"John Chrysostom: Instruction and Refutation Against Those Men Living With Virgins\\" Women in Early Christianity. 129 like Athanasius, he sees spiritual marriage as a betrayal of Christ the Bridegroom as well.\\"John Chrysostom: On the Necessity of Guarding Virginity.\\" Translated by Patricia Cox Miller. Women in Early Christianity: Translations from Greek Texts,149. Washington, DC.: Catholic University of America Press, 2012. His protests also show the prevailing views of men and women that existed during this time, as his writing suggests that spiritual marriage goes against traditional views of men and women occupying separate spheres.Clark. \\"John Chrysostom and the \\"Subintroductae\\"\\"183.

Species There are four species in this genus: * Nannophryne apolobambica (De la Riva, R√≠os, and Aparicio, 2005) * Nannophryne cophotis (Boulenger, 1900) * Nannophryne corynetes (Duellman and Ochoa-M., 1991) * Nannophryne variegata G√ºnther, 1870 References Category:Amphibian genera Category:Amphibians of South America ","title":"Nannophryne"},{"id":"45602092","text":"The 1981 SANFL Grand Final was an Australian rules football competition.

It is a common tree along river banks or around swamps in the tropics. It has papery bark and weeping foliage and has been the subject of important scientific research. Description Melaleuca argentea is a tree usually to but sometimes to . The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are elliptic, straight or sickle-shaped, long, about wide and have 5 to 9 longitudinal veins. Mature leaves are pale, silvery green and the young growth is soft, silvery and covered with silky soft hairs. The leaves are aromatic when crushed. The flowers are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering, sometimes also in the upper leaf axils. The spikes contain 5 to 20 groups of flowers in threes and are up to in diameter. The petals are about long and fall off as the flower ages. The stamens are in 5 bundles around the flower with 7 to 9 stamens per bundle. Flowering occurs in most months of the year and is followed by fruit which are woody, cup-shaped to cylindrical capsules, in diameter and loosely spaced along the branches. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca argentea was first formally described in 1918 by William Fitzgerald in \\"Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Western Australia\\" from specimens he collected from the \\"Isdell, Charnley, Fitzroy, Ord, Denham Rivers, etc.\\" The specific epithet (argentea) is from the Latin argenteus, meaning \\"silvery\\". Distribution and habitat Silver cajuput occurs in the Kimberley district of Western Australia, the Top End of the Northern Territory and north Queensland. Forests of M. argentea occur along swampy drainage lines in similar niches to Melaleuca quinquenervia which they displace in the far northern coastal portions of the wet tropics bioregion. Ecology The life span of this species has been determined to be greater than 20 years. It first forms seeds at the age of 6‚Äì10 years and recovers from fire by regrowing from a lignotuber. Conservation status Melaleuca argentea is classified as \\"not threatened\\" in Western Australia by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Uses =Horticulture= This tree described as a \\"handsome, weeping, silver-leaved tree\\" is suitable for tropical and sub-tropical areas. It is used as an ornamental tree in Brisbane. =Scientific research= Research has been undertaken to determine the water use characteristics of Melaleuca argentea in the Pilbara region of Western Australia so that its response to changes in water levels over time can be predicted. Daily and seasonal water use patterns of this species have also been determined. The information is important because vegetation along riverbanks protects water quality, regulating stream temperature (through shading), water turbidity and river bank stability. Riparian communities are important wildlife corridors and often have higher biodiversity than surrounding ecosystems.

Lovett previously played for the Leigh Centurions in the Betfred Championship. He previously played for the Wests Tigers in the National Rugby League. He primarily plays as a , but can also fill in as a . Background Born in Leichhardt, New South Wales, Lovett played his junior football for Leichhardt Wanderers Five Dock RSL and the Leichhardt Juniors before being signed by the Wests Tigers. Playing career In 2012, and 2013, Lovett played for the Wests Tigers' NYC team. He was named the team's Player of the Year for both seasons and captained the side as they won the grand final in 2012. In April 2013, he played for the New South Wales Under-20s team. On 18 July 2013, Lovett re-signed with the Tigers on a 1-year contract. In 2014, Lovett moved on to the Tigers' New South Wales Cup team, and was again named that team's Player of the Year. In Round 1 of the 2015 NRL season, Lovett made his NRL debut for the Tigers against the Gold Coast Titans. Lovett played in the centres, coming into the side as a late replacement for Chris Lawrence. The Tigers won the game with a late field goal, and Lovett said, \\"I could never ask for a better round one debut. To win by a field goal. It's the best feeling I've ever had.\\" After an injury to Dene Halatau, Lovett returned to first grade in round 4, playing in the second row. He scored his first NRL try early in the game, running onto a Luke Brooks pass near the try-line. On 20 August 2015, Lovett re-signed with the Tigers on a 2-year contract. He made 21 appearances during the season, mostly playing second-row or starting from the bench. Making 663 tackles, he was second only to Robbie Farah at Wests Tigers. He was named the team's NRL Rookie of the Year. He said, \\"I just feel really honoured to not only have this award, but also to have been given the opportunity to play as many games and minutes as I did this season. I‚Äôve talked to a few of the older boys and I think the best part about it is getting so much experience under my belt in one year.\\" With Robbie Farah unavailable for the first game of 2016, Lovett played some time at hooker and scored a try. In May he made his representative debut with City, and scored a try as he, \\"ran the perfect line to stroll over from close range.\\". On 23 December 2016, Lovett was pulled over by NSW Police who were conducting random breath testing in The Sydney suburb of Pyrmont. Officers noticed that Lovett was sweating profusely and he was questioned if there was anything in the vehicle. After searching the vehicle, officers found white powder near the drivers seat and they performed a search on Lovett. Lovett admitted he was carrying drugs and pulled out a bag of cocaine from his underpants. Police also discovered an MDMA tablet in the vehicle but Lovett denied that this belonged to him. Lovett was then issued a field notice to attend court over the matter. On 1 February 2017, Lovett pleaded guilty at Downing Centre Local Court and was given a 6-month good behaviour bond by the magistrate. Lovett was stood down by The Wests Tigers and missed The Auckland Nines tournament as a result.http://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/nrl-player-kyle-lovett-hid-drugs-in- his-underwear/news-story/af896cfe424ab791fc2101cc350def65 On 17 November 2017, Lovett signed a 2-year contract with English side Leigh Centurions after being told his contract would not be renewed by The Wests Tigers.http://www.leighjournal.co.uk/sport/leighcenturions/15667631.Leigh_Centurions_sign_Kyle_Lovett_from_Wests_Tigers/http://www.weststigers.com.au/news/2017/09/06/nine_players_to_depa.html In 2019, Lovett joined Ron Massey Cup side the Concord-Burwood-Glebe Wolves.

Pupil of Kano Eisen'in Michinobu (Áã©Èáé Ê†ÑÂ∑ùÈô¢ ÂÖ∏‰ø°). Born as the first son of direct vassal of the Shogunate, a well- off samurai family that was part of the Fujiwara clan. Eishi was a vassal of the Shogunate with a generous stipend of 500 'koku' (90,000 litres) of rice. Eishi left his employ with the Sh≈çgun Ieharu to pursue art. His early works were prints, mostly Bijin-ga portraits of tall, thin, graceful beauties in the original style established by himself akin to Kiyonaga and Utamaro. He established his own school and was a rival to Utamaro. He was a prolific painter, and from 1801 gave up print designing to devote himself to painting. Life and career Eishi was born Hosoda Tokitomi () in 1756 to a well- provided samurai family that was part of the prestigious Fujiwara clan. His grandfather Hosoda Tokitoshi (Á¥∞Áî∞ ÊôÇÊïè) had held an influential position in the shogunate as Treasury Minister. In 1772 he came to head his family when his father Hosoda Tokiyuki () died. From 1781 he held a position in the palace of the sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Ieharu. How Eishi took to art is unknown. He appears to have studied under Kan≈ç Michinobu of the Kan≈ç school of painting, from whom he likely was given the art name Eishi‚Äîthough tradition holds he received the name from Sh≈çgun Ieharu. About 1784 he left the official service of the Sh≈çgun and began to train under Torii Bunry≈´sai, an ukiyo-e artist about whom almost nothing is known. Eishi's earliest known work dates to the following year. He remained unofficially in the Sh≈çgun's service until 1789, and thereafter left his family in the hands of his adopted son Tokitoyo (), thereby giving up his samurai rank; he reasoned that his ill health did not permit him to continue with such duties. Eishi's earliest works were colour ' prints. The subjects are such literary fare as The Tale of Genji and are in subdued tones, as required by contemporary laws against ostentation. He went on to specialize in ' portraits of beautiful women, of which he produced a number of series. His most prominent rival at first was Kiyonaga; later his work competed against that of Utamaro. His manner of depicting women went through stages: the earliest were of courtesans much in the manner of Kiyonaga; then seated women performing daily activities such as reading or writing, set against bright backgrounds; later, slender women standing against minimal, subdued backgrounds. Eishi depicted gradually taller and more slender women until, in the latest prints, their heads were one-twelfth the height of the figures; more so even than Kiyonaga, whose reputation is for tall, slender beauties. Eishi made occasional illustrations for books of ' erotica. He was a prolific painter of such standing that in 1800 a painting of his entered the collection of the cloistered Empress Go-Sakuramachi and he was granted the honorary title Jibuky≈ç (). Eishi abandoned print designing for painting after 1801. He died in the seventh month of 1829 and was buried at Rengeji Temple. His Buddhist posthumous name is K≈çsetsuin Denkaishin Eishi Nichizui Koji (). He also used the personal names Min'noj≈ç () and Yasabur≈ç ().

After doing his schooling in Dungannon he attended Trinity College, Dublin but left after a short time. Having a boyish passion for the sea, he found work as a Mercantile Marine with the East India Company, which disappointed his father, who had wanted him to become a solicitor. While working for the company he made a trip to Sydney and back on board a merchantman before the company's charter expired. Thornton returned to Ireland for a short time before once again setting out for Sydney. After working as a public servant for the New South Wales Government, he joined his cousin who was taking stock to South Australia with the journey taking four months. After returning to New South Wales, Thornton became a squatter in the Wellington area. In 1853 he returned to Ireland only to be back in Australia two years later. Back in Australia, Thornton resumed work as a public servant and was transferred to Moreton Bay as a Collector of Customs for the New South Wales Government. Upon Queensland's separation in 1859, he was Collector of Customs for the Queensland Government and worked in this role till 1882.

He was part of the school of garden and landscape architects. Life Horst Baeseler was born in Dresden in the southern part of what was then central Germany. His father was a pharmacist. He attended school at the city's prestigious King George Gymnasium, but his school days were prematurely terminated in February 1945 when the school was destroyed. The war ended in May 1945 and Dresden found itself in the Soviet occupation zone of what remained of Germany, controlled by the Soviet military. Four years later the entire \\"zone\\" was subsequently relaunched as a stand-alone East German state under Soviet sponsorship, the German Democratic Republic formally founded in October 1949. Baeseler trained between 1945 and 1948 as a gardener at the Paul Hauber Tree School in Dresden-Tolkewitz. He then started work as a gardener, focusing on herbaceous shrubs and trees. He also continued to train, now with Johann Greiner at the Horticultural Academy in Pillnitz. In 1951 he took a part in a machinery training course for gardeners in Quedlinburg. Between 1951 and 1991, at the behest of Johann Greiner, Horst Baeseler was an employee of the National Building Academy. Here, until 1955, he was working with Reinhold Lingner, the country's leading garden and landscape architect. The two of them worked on the landscaping for the Wilhelm Pieck Pioneers' Republic in Altenhof, north of Berlin: this was to become the principal recreational and training/indoctrination camp for selected Young Pioneers. Greiner and Baseler later worked together on the Stalinstadt Arts and Sports centre in Eisenh√ºttenstadt. Between 1952 and 1955 Baeseler studied at the Humboldt University of Berlin, emerging with an engineering degree in Landscape planning. For the next three decades he was involved in a series of high- profile East German construction projects. In 1981 Baeseler was involved in an East German Development Support project in Mozambique. His contribution involved garden and landscape construction projects. Between 1991 and 1996 he worked at the Institute for Regional Development and Structural Planning.

Biography Alving was born in Yttersel√∂, a parish on the island Sela√∂n in S√∂dermanland on 23 October 1874. Her parents were August L√∂nn (1837‚Äì1920), captain of a steamship on lake M√§laren, and Erika Charlotta Persdotter Jonsson. She was educated at Palmgrenska Samskolan in Stockholm, the first co-educational school in Scandinavia, where she matriculated in 1893. From 1898 to 1905 she was married to the statistician Sven Norrman and from 1906 to the linguist and educator Hjalmar Alving. She had three children: Anders Norrman from her first marriage, and Beat-Sofi Alving and journalist Barbro Alving from her marriage with Hjalmar Alving. Alving travelled to Norway, Denmark and other European countries. She was a correspondent at the Greek consulate in Malm√∂ from 1894 to 1898. Thereafter she worked for the journal Strix in Stockholm until 1901, signing her articles Maja X. Albert Engstr√∂m, the founder and editor of Strix, initially refused to believe that Maja X was a woman, reportedly saying that \\"no woman could be that funny\\". As a novelist, she used the pen name Ulrik Uhland but also used Fanny Norrman and Fanny Alving. Alving was one of the few Swedes of the day who introduced ordinary local people into her stories. She often used characters she had met on Sela√∂n, a place she returned to frequently. Her crime novel Josefssons p√• Drottninggatan (The Josefssons on Queen's Street) not only includes people from Stockholm but features Sweden's first woman detective, Jullan Eriksson. Barbro Alving has described her parents Fanny and Hjalmar as being very happy and her childhood as full of laughter. However, Fanny Alving also suffered from severe depressions, and in 1936 she had a psychotic episode which led to her being hospitalised for some time. She spent much time in her childhood home at Sela√∂n which she found very peaceful. She died in 1955 and is buried in the churchyard at Yttersel√∂ Church, where Hjalmar Alving and both their daughters are also buried.

It was released as the first track of his 1987 album Tomorrow. It was recorded in 1986 when Masekela was in exile from the apartheid regime of South Africa. The melody of the song is buoyant, containing a number of powerful chords and trumpet riffs. The lyrics of the song demand the release of Black South African leader Nelson Mandela, who had been imprisoned by the white South African government on Robben Island since 1962. The song became enormously popular, and turned into an unofficial anthem of the anti-apartheid movement. It became one of Masekela's most performed live songs. It was later used as a part of the official soundtrack to the documentary film Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony. The song was included in the 1994 live album Hope and in the 2001 collection Grazing in the Grass: The Best of Hugh Masekela, released by Columbia Records. Writing Musician Hugh Masekela, who composed the song after receiving a letter from Nelson Mandela Black South African leader Nelson Mandela was imprisoned on Robben Island in 1962. He was a great fan of Hugh Masekela's music, and on Masekela's birthday in 1985, smuggled out a letter to him expressing his good wishes. Masekela was inspired to write \\"Bring Him Back Home\\" in response. In interviews, Masekela has expressed admiration for Mandela, saying \\"Mandela was the symbol. He was the voice of all [the] people.\\" Sam Raditlhalo writes that the reception of Mandela's letter, and the writing of Bring Him Back Home, marked Masekela's evolution into an anti-apartheid activist. Lyrics The lyrics of the song visualize Nelson Mandela \\"walking freely down the streets of South Africa,\\" thus articulating a demand for his release from prison. The lyrics also mention Mandela \\"walking hand in hand with Winnie Mandela,\\" then his wife. Mandela was in fact released in 1990 and went on a post-freedom tour of North America with Winnie. In Boston, he danced as this song was played after his speech. Music The melody used in the song is upbeat and anthem-like. It employs a series of trumpet riffs by Masekela, supported by grand series of chords. Music review website AllMusic describes the music as \\"filled with the sense of camaraderie and celebration that are referred to in the lyrics. The vocal choir during the joyous chorus is extremely moving and life affirming\\". Reception and censorship The song was banned in South Africa by the government upon its release. Nonetheless, it became a part of the number of musical voices protesting the apartheid regime, and became an important song for the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1980s. It was declared to be \\"clean\\" by the South African government following Mandela's release from prison in 1990. It became one of Masekela's most popular pieces, and one of his most performed live songs. AllMusic described it as a \\"truly classic modern day folk song\\". It was later used as a part of the official soundtrack to the documentary film Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony. The song was included in the 1994 live album Hope and in the 2001 collection Grazing in the Grass: The Best of Hugh Masekela, released by Columbia records. It was also covered by several other artists, and included on other collections of Masekela's music.

Her work includes series of photographs examining Antarctica, her own daughter's mouth, and our relationship with nature. Education Born in Whanganui in 1954, Noble attended high school at the Roman Catholic girls' college, Erskine College, in Island Bay, Wellington, and Wanganui Girls' College. She completed a MFA Honours (1st class) at the Elam School of Fine Arts in 1983. Work Noble's approach to her work involves \\"prolonged observation and attentive watching\\". She is known for working in photographic series. Her first major exhibition, The Wanganui, opened at the Sarjeant Gallery in 1982 and toured to the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Auckland, Hamilton and Te Manawa in Palmerston North. Writer Sheridan Keith described these works as \\"a series of images of immense spirituality, serenity and intensity of feeling\\". In the presence of angels ‚Äì photographs of the contemplative life (1988‚Äì1990) is a series of photographs documenting life inside a London convent. Noble lived with the Benedictine nuns in the silent order for an extended period. In My Father‚Äôs Garden is a series of photographs that follow the artist's father's death, while the Hidden Lives series capture the lives of elderly intellectually disabled people and their carers. The series Ruby‚Äôs Room (1998‚Äì2007) features close-up images of the photographer's daughter's mouth. The artist says that many of the best childhood moments go unrecorded, and that many of these \\"relate to pleasures and play around the mouth, moments of defiance and triumph, like managing to blow a really good bubble with bubble gum ... I wanted to magnify the colour, the spontaneity, the life, the fun and play, and all the things that I enjoyed as a mother.\\" In 2010 the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa acquired 30 of the works from the series as a boxed portfolio, describing them as \\"standing alongside her Antarctic work [as] Anne Noble's major body of photography from the 2000s\\". In 2001 the Dunedin Public Art Gallery staged a major retrospective of Noble's work, Anne Noble: States of Grace, which toured to City Gallery Wellington and the Auckland Art Gallery. Since 2001, Noble has been researching and visiting the Antarctic, and has produced several series of works on this subject, including Antarctica Iceblink and Antarctica Whiteout. These works are often concerned with how Antarctica has been portrayed in popular perceptions, exploring how we have come to see Antarctica as \\"a glistening white world where penguins frolic and snowflakes fall\\". Recently, Noble's work has investigated the honeybee and its place in our world, research instigated by her time on a Fulbright fellowship based at Columbia College in Chicago as their international artist in residence. Her first exhibition on this subject, Nature Study, was held at Bartley+Company in Wellington in 2015. Writing about these new works, art historian Priscilla Pitts noted: > For several years Noble has focused her camera on Antarctica, 'the last > great wilderness on earth', intractable despite our efforts to document and > understand it, yet fragile and susceptible to our actions elsewhere on the > planet. Noble's attention to the plight of bees arises from the same concern > for the natural environment and what we are doing to it. In these new works > there is a shift from the ostensibly documentary mode of the Antarctic > images towards a more overtly poetic exploration of her subject, something > that is familiar from much of her earlier work. Awards and recognitions Noble has held several artist residencies, including the Tylee Cottage Residency in 1990, Artist in Residence at the University of Canterbury in 1993, and the Antarctic Arts Fellowship in 2001 and 2009. She was awarded the US National Science Foundation Artists and Writers Award in 2008 and a Massey University Research Medal in 2009. In 2015 Noble won the 31st Higashikawa Overseas Photographer Award. In the 2003 Queen's Birthday Honours, Noble was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to photography. In 2009 she received an Arts Foundation of New Zealand Laureate award. In 2013 Massey University awarded Noble the title of Distinguished Professor. Publications * Noble, Anne (1982).

Location and surrounding area  The Widderstein is a massif in the mountains around the valley of Kleinwalsertal, which runs past it to the north. To the northeast of the Gro√üer Widderstein, separated by the Karlstor (2,100 m), is the Kleiner Widderstein (2,236 m). To the east the valley of Gemsteltal divides the flanks of the Widderstein from the massif around the Elferkopf (2,387 m) and the Walser Gei√ühorn (2,366 m). To the south is the Hochtannberg Pass (1,676 m), where the Allg√§u Alps give way to the Lechquellen Mountains. To the west lies the valley of B√§rgunttal and the massif around the Heiterberg (2,188 m). In a hollow to the northwest below the side of the summit lies the lake of Hochalpsee (1,970 m). The boundary between the municipalities of Warth and Mittelberg runs over the mountain.  Geology  The summit block of the Gro√üer Widderstein consists of main dolomite of the Lech valley formation (Lechtaldecke), which here has been pushed up over the Allg√§u formation (Allg√§udecke). To the northwest in the area of the Hochalpsees there are K√∂ssen beds (K√∂ssener Schichten).Herbert Scholz: Bau und Werden der Allg√§uer Landschaft. E.

In 1908, when he had returned to Japan, he introduced volleyball and basketball to the country and became known as the \\"Father of Japanese Basketball\\". In Tokyo, the Omoris established a settlement house, Yurin En (House of the Friendly Neighbor) which offered dramatic classes and a playground for children. It also offered courses in sewing, flower arranging, cooking, and crafts as well as mother's meetings and opportunities for people to speak English. Initially, they met resistance because of their co-educational programs, the fact that the Omoris were Christian, and that they broke down well-establish class barriers. The Yurin En was at the forefront of the Japanese playground movement. In 1909, Omori was the Physical Director for the Japanese Association.

The single-span King Post covered bridge structure was built by Joseph A. Britton in 1908 and destroyed by flood in 1957. History =Construction= Joseph A. Britton built this bridge the same year that he also built the nearby Zacke Cox Covered Bridge and Harry Evans Covered Bridges. It would hold the title as the shortest covered bridge in Parke County until a year later when the Phillips Covered Bridge would tie it for the title. During construction, teams of horses and wagons would bog down in quicksand that lay along the creek bed. To fix this, small herds of cattle were led back and forth across these areas to pack the sand down and make it firm enough to support the horses and wagons. =Destruction= On June 27 and 28, 1957, the remnants of Hurricane Audrey met up with a front that laid across central Indiana. The resulting rain, 6 to 10 inches, produces record floods across central Indiana and east-central Illinois. Rockville reported 10.15 inches. Big Raccoon Creek report the highest levels since the floods of 1875. Across the area six people were drowned, 1,282 dwellings damaged, 125 businesses were flooded, dozens of highway and railroad bridges were washed out and a million acres of crops were flooded, with thousands of acres of already cultivated land flooded to a depth of 6 feet or more. The Weisner Covered Bridge was washed away when a small dam above the bridge gave way in this massive rainstorm. This quickly filled the Weisner Creek valley with flood water, washing the bridge away and threatening the residents of a nearby house that feared the flood waters would sweep it away also. Since then a larger flood control dam, constructed by the Corps of Engineers, has been constructed upstream from the former site of the Weisner Covered Bridge. However, a study of the new dam reports that if it were to fail and collapse the resulting flood waters would sweep down the Little Raccoon Creek valley and damage houses in Jessup.

Munyan (who constructed various buildings in the area) as a four-room house. In 1866 it was sold to J. N. Thompsons, who sold it to J. R. Routt in 1898. Routt made significant changes to the plot, contracting J. W. Heartfield to move the cottage to the rear of the plot and build it in to a much larger Late Victorian house. The house has had various modifications since and has been kept in good repair. The current plot is believed to be worthy of archaeological investigation to find out more about the original outbuildings. It is also thought that there may have been a cistern associated with the dwelling historically. The home was inherited by Routt's daughter Thelma Crockett in 1962.

A mob of about 7000‚Äì8000 people broke into a prison, dragged a man detained under suspicion of rape out of the Dimapur Central Jail, paraded him naked and beat him to death in a case of vigilante justice. The incident took place in the backdrop of widespread public anger over rising sexual violence against women in India and a controversy over a ban on the documentary India's Daughter, based on the 2012 Delhi gang rape, and concerns in Nagaland over illegal immigration from Bangladesh. Events =Alleged rape= According to the first information report (FIR) filed by the victim, a 20-year-old student of Shri Digamber Jain Girls' College, was raped in Hotel De Oriental Dream in Dimapur on 23 February 2015. The accused Farid Khan and his accomplice Nikavi, alias Ngukav forcibly assaulted her and intoxicated her. Then Farid Khan had allegedly raped her multiple times. The accused and his accomplice were arrested on 25 February 2015 for rape and assault, and were lodged in Dimapur Central Jail. They had been charged under Indian Penal Code sections 476, 344 and 363. The rape victim later in an interview claimed that she had been given by the accused to remain silent about the incident. She said that the man was known to her as her neighbor and his wife belonged to the same village as her. She also said that she was lured into a car by a friend, who then left. The man then intoxicated her and raped her several times. She later reported it to the police and handed over the money. The accused Farid Khan told Nagaland Police in his interrogation that he had consensual sex with her for which he had given her money. =Identity of the man= Initially, the man was thought to be an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh. The accused was later named as Syed Farid Khan, a 35-year-old used car businessman. Originally from, Karimganj district of Assam, he had been living in Nagaland for 8 years. He was married to a Naga lady for 4 years and had a three-year-old daughter. Two of his brothers were in the Indian Army. Another brother had died in service during the Kargil War. His father had retired from the Military Engineering Service (MES) of the army. The family of the accused claimed that he was framed. One of his brothers, who also lived in Dimapur and ran a business said the woman who had filed the case was close to the accused's family and was well- acquainted with his wife. He claims that the woman had invited Farid to a hotel with some other persons on 23 February, and that she forced him to drink and demanded from him. He asserts that on being refused, she filed a case the next day. =Mob attack= On 5 March, about 7000-8000 people broke into the Dimapur Central Jail. They dragged the accused out, while parading him naked, pelted him with stones and beat him. They dragged the accused to a clock tower about 7 km away, by tying a rope to his waist from a motorcycle. The accused died on the way. The body was displayed from the clock tower's railings, until the police came and took it down. The Superintendent of Police Meren Jamir later said that the mob was led by a group of a few hundred school and college girls in uniforms, which prevented the police from using more force. Jamir said that the initial crowd was small and they had been repelled by baton charges. But, later the mob returned with larger numbers. Even though 8 companies of security forces were present at the jail, they failed to stop the mob. The police later said that there was at least one former inmate of the prison, who knew the interior layout of the jail. The police had fired blanks and tear gas at the crowd but had failed to disperse them. One member of the mob was killed and 52 members of the police were injured in the clashes. The mob also burnt 10 police vehicles. Initially, it was reported that the man was an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh. There had been calls from local organisations to expel outsiders. The incident was also attributed to the faulty justice system of the state, which had obtained few convictions in various cases of rape. The man's local accomplice who was lodged in same jail was left alone by the mob. =Aftermath= In the home state of the accused, Assam, All Assam Minority Students' Union burnt an effigy of the Nagaland government in Nagaon, accusing the government of discriminating against minorities living in the state, and demanded an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on 6 March. On 6 March, Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi condemned the attack and discussed the matter with Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Nagaland Chief Minister T. R. Zeliang. Dimapur Deputy Police Commissioner Wezope Kenye and Superintendent of Police Meren Jamir were suspended on the evening of 6 March. The Central Jail Chief was also suspended. Residents of Nagaland were asked to avoid traveling into Assam. Shops and commercial established remained closed on 6 March in Dimapur under a curfew. On 7 March, truckers from Assam stopped moving goods into Nagaland in protest of the incident. They also alleged they are harassed in Nagaland and asked to pay illegal tolls. Amnesty International India on 7 March demanded an investigation into the incident, calling it a serious lapse of the justice system. The curfew continued in Dimapur. Chief Minister Zeliang said that there had been administrative lapses and that relaxing the Section 177 of the CrPC, which prohibits unlawful assembly, in Nagaland was a mistake. He also said that the social media was responsible for inciting the incident. Later, Nagaland government restricted telecom services in the region. Internet was blocked for 48 hours in the state starting on the night of 7 March. SMS and MMS services were also blocked. Also on 7 March, Chief Minister Gogoi blamed the security force of the central government for failing to protect the jail. Gogoi also claimed that the medical report had not confirmed rape. The brother of the dead also repeated the claim. The body was airlifted to the dead's hometown in Bosla village in Karimganj district. On 8 March, the body of the man was buried in his village. About, 4000 Bengali Muslims had left Nagaland by then, fearing attacks. On 10 March 2015, the protesters agitated against the 5 March 2015, incident at Hojai. The protesters blocked the railway tracks near the Hojai railway station. Therefore, the lone train service the Nagaland Express originating from Dimapur to Guwahati was made to halt for nearly an hour at Lanka Railway Station. =Investigation= On 6 March, it was reported that the police were examining the CCTV footage from the Dimapur hotel where the rape had allegedly taken place. The Superintendent of Police, Meren Jamir said that the footage showed the girl entering and leaving the room with the accused. On the same day, it was announced that Zeilang's state cabinet had appointed Veprasa Nyekha, a retired district and sessions judge, to head a judicial inquiry commission. On 8 March, Inspector-General of Police Wabang Jamir said from initial medical report it appeared the girl was raped and that the samples had been sent to a forensic lab. By 8 March, 22 people had been arrested in connection to the lynching. The arrests were made after the police analysed the video clips of the incidents. By 9 March, 43 people had been arrested in connection to the lynching. Of those arrested, 25 were identified as the \\"core mob\\" group. The police found that most those who had joined the mob, had come in response to comments on two blogs: The Naga Blog and Naga Spear. The protest march was initially intended to condemn the rape, but it became politically motivated. Soon afterwards, the district collector was asked to handover the accused but he refused. The mob kept vandalising sites and photographs were uploaded to the blogs. After the administrator of Naga Blog began deleting posts, the people moved to Naga Spear. Instant messaging apps were also used to increase the size of the mob. The mob believed that they were lynching a Bangladeshi. On 11 March, it was reported that the Nagaland state government informed the Ministry of Home Affairs that the alleged rapist had claimed in the interrogation after his arrest that he had never raped the victim and that it was consensual sex for which he gave her . But, Nagaland Chief Minister T. R. Zeliang later told The Times of India that the Ministry of Home Affairs had been misquoted by the media. Nagaland Government denied that it has stated that no rape had taken place and preliminary medical reports indicated rape and it had sent samples to the Central Forensic Laboratory in Guwahati. On 19 March 2015, after a cabinet meeting the Nagaland government recommended a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry for the case. By then, the police had arrested 55 people and issued photos of 34 wanted suspects. On 18 May 2015, a judicial commission, headed by retired Gauhati High Court judge B. D. Agarwal, began its investigation. The commission in a public notice asked local newspapers, associations, unions, blogs including Naga Blog and Naga Spear, principals of schools and colleges, and family members of the victims to submit written statements regarding the lynching. On 18 June 2015, it was reported that only three persons had submitted the requested statements. On 7 September 2015, the Gauhati High Court directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to start a probe and submit a report within 6 months. The Court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by one Rajeeb Kalita of Guwahati. By then, 58 people had been arrested and 32 persons had lookout notices on them.

Khanna, during the Annual Commanders‚Äô Conference of Training Command, at Bangalore on 15 May 2014. Air Force Station, Bidar is one of the Premier Flying Training establishments of the Indian Air Force. It was established during World War II, has been a training centre for budding pilots of the IAF since 1963. The air base had trainer aircraft like HT2 and various variants of Kiran aircraft for nearly four decades. Now it has been remodelled and refurbished for the arrival of the Hawks. The runway has been extended to 9,000 feet and new facilities for aircraft and engine maintenance and testing are built. It is home for the second biggest training centre in the country. Graduates from the Air Force Academy come here to learn the skills and techniques to become a next generation fighter pilot before being assigned to one of the combat units of the world's fourth-largest air force. Around 60-90 sorties per day are flown from the base thereby generating the highest amount of single-engine flying hours in the country from this air base. Once the home base for 52nd Squadron, the station now houses the three Hawk Operational Training Squadrons (HOTS-A Aggressors, HOTS-B Bravehearts and HOTS-C Cheetahs). In addition the Weapon System Operators' School also functions here. A fourth Squadron is ready to be raised shortly. In a phased manner, 66 Hawk aircraft are to be added to the AFS Bidar. Location Hawk Operational Training Squadron, Air Force Station Bidar Bidar is located in Karnataka, India, away from the bigger hubs and is excellent for airspace and weather. Being located on the Deccan Plateau provides protection from the tropical conditions that are experienced on the coast. Flying conditions are invariably good all year round and the climate is relatively mild ‚Äì except from mid-March to mid-May ‚Äì so the training base don't lose many sorties to bad weather which is important as the trainees aren't instrument rated so they cannot fly in poor conditions. Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team The Suryakiran Aerobatic Team (SKAT) flew its first 6 aircraft formation sortie on 27 May 96 at AFS Bidar. Unlike most teams, which fly either frontline fighter aircraft or advanced jet trainers, SKAT flies an indigenous basic jet trainer, the Kiran MK II. The team was suspended in February 2011 and was re-established with Hawk Mk-132 aircraft in 2017.Surya Kiran Surya Kirans in display for the last time in Aero India 2011 =Overview= The Station was also the home of the Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team. The team was a true ambassador of IAF. However, after their dazzling display during Aero India 2011, to meet its increasing training requirements, the IAF took decision to disband the team on 30 June 2011. =History= Aerobatic Team is associated with Bidar AFS since 1990 with arrival of four- aircraft team called the Formation Aerobatic Team from Thunderbolt which were set up on Kiran trainers. The SKAT was born in 1996 and developed over time. It was conferred with Squadron status in 2006. =Training= Pilots serving as Qualified Flying Instructors (QFIs) with approximately 1000 hours of experience on fighter aircraft can volunteer to be a part of the SKAT. Volunteers are invited to fly with the team, where their performance and personality traits are evaluated. Over the next six months or so, selected pilots then fly 70-75 sorties practising various manoeuvres before they get into the formation flying team. The average tenure of a SKAT pilot is about three years. Two new pilots join the team every six months. Starting at high altitude with a single aircraft sortie, with the team leader or the deputy team leader in the Kiran's left-hand seat, the trainee moves on to two- aircraft and then three-aircraft formation flying. After mastering the skill of flying with two aircraft on either side, the trainee then goes in for four- aircraft and six-aircraft sorties before finally graduating on to nine- aircraft sorties. All types of rolls, loops, dives and formations are flown at various training stages. =Composition= The team is led by a Commanding Officer who is also the leader of the formation during display sorties. The squad has 13 pilots out of whom nine perform at any given time. These display aircraft have enthralled audiences with their manoeuvres, since their inception in 1996. Senior and experienced fighter pilots are chosen to be part of the prestigious SKAT, which used the IAF's basic HJT-16 Kiran Mk-2 trainer aircraft. It now uses the Hawk Mk-132 aircraft since 2017. =Formations and Manoeuvres= To perform the manoeuvres, a pilot requires tremendous concentration, grit and determination to take the aircraft to the extremes of its envelope. *The most popular and also the most dangerous formation of the SKAT has been of the nine aircraft taking off in a V-shaped formation of three and joining up in close formation, manoeuvring between speeds of 150 and 650 km per hour with their wing tips a mere 5 metres apart. *Six Kiran trainer jets streak barely 50 metres above the ground in an arrowhead formation. With their wingtips separated by just five metres, they move into a diamond formation and roll towards their left to form a \\"card\\" formation with three aircraft flying abreast and another three trailing just behind. *Reforming again after \\"synchro head-on cross\\", where two aircraft on the same level cross each other at a relative speed of 1100 km/h with a separation of just five metres, the brightly painted red and white aircraft, with their exhausts trailing smoke, dive vertically and then pull up again in different directions to simulate a bomb burst. Kiran Mk II In July, 2012, the final Kiran Mk II aircraft flew out of Bidar to Tambaram. This aircraft was in Bidar for almost three decades. Hawk Mk 132 Hawk Induction Ceremony at AFS Bidar =Overview= Flying training at AFS Bidar is now done on the Hawk Mk 132 aircraft. With the arrival of enhanced number of trainees and full complement of Hawk aircraft, the training academy is abuzz with activity. The station roars with engine noises throughout the day. The Hawk brings a huge step-up in capability as a training aircraft, bridging the gap between the basic piston- engined trainer and the high performance flying of an advanced fighter aircraft. It is aerodynamically much more forgiving and is a great introduction for trainee pilots to familiarise on before they go into fighters. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha in a HAWK MK 132 simulator at Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd., during the Aero India-2015, in Bangalore on 19 February 2015. The stage-III training, ahead of the pilots graduating to the supersonic jets such as MiG-21s, Jaguars, Mirages and Sukhoi SU-30MKIs. is carried out as the Station is the mother base for Hawk Mk 132 aircraft. Modern servicing facilities have been created which bench-mark the maintenance philosophy of IAF. The average airmen earlier worked with basic tools for servicing the aircraft. He has now become tech savvy in tune with the requirements of modern aircraft. The Hawk Mk 132 is a variant of the highly successful BAE Systems. It incorporates an open architecture mission computer, glass cockpit and a state of the art avionics suite including a new generation Inertial Navigation System with GPS (INGPS). It is also equipped with several Indian made components such as the communication sets, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system and the radio altimeter. In addition to being an advanced jet trainer, Hawk Mk 132 is fully combat capable and can carry air to air missile and air to ground armament. It could also be used as a lightweight fighter. Hawk can also be flown at night and perform a wide range of aerobatic manoeuvres. =History= The need for an AJT was first articulated by the IAF in 1982 and ever since has remained high on IAF's agenda for procurement. The IAF felt that there existed a quantum difference in the skill and judgement levels required of a young fighter pilot as he transited to state of the art fighters such as the Su-30 MKI, Mirage 2000 and MiG-29. The Hawk 132 would adequately serve as lead in trainer for these advanced aircraft. The first flypast of Hawk aircraft after induction into the Indian Air Force at Air Force Station, Bidar Two Hawk Mk 132 advanced jet trainer (AJT) aircraft that departed BAE Systems', Warton airfield in UK on 8 November 2007, reached Air Force Station Bidar on 12 November 2007. The Hawk pair flown by a mix crew of BAE Systems and IAF pilots, Wing Commander Pankaj Jain and Squadron Leader Tarun Hindwani, first landed in India at the Jamnagar airbase while ferrying from Muscat, their previous stopover, on their way to Bidar. The AJT pair was escorted into Bidar airspace by the Suryakirans streaming national colours. Air Marshal GS Chaudhry, Air Officer Commanding- in-Chief, Training Command and Air Commodore Ramesh Rai, AOC, AFS Bidar, oversaw the first arrival of the aircraft. This heralded yet another saga towards meeting the training requirements of the IAF pilots. Of the 66 aircraft being purchased, 24 were developed, built and supplied by BAE Systems, UK; while Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Bengaluru is to manufacture the remaining 42 aircraft under licence in India. Bidar airfield, located in the North West of Karnataka, approx 150 km from Hyderabad, was chosen as the main operating base for the Hawk. This base has been a training establishment for budding fighter pilots of the IAF since 1963. To ensure the smooth induction of the Hawk, the Air Warriors under the command of Air Commodore Ramesh Rai have worked tirelessly to put the required infrastructure in place. They were, at all stages, assisted by the local civil authorities and population. The work services included extension of the two runways, improvement in landing facilities and creation of servicing facilities for the technology intensive Hawk aircraft. =Training= Hawk Operational Training Squadron Bidar base has a classroom and fully computer-aided learning system for instruction of pilots and maintenance personnel. Hawk Mk 132 Simulator Significance The induction of Hawk aircraft in the IAF has not only brought in a modern trainer into the IAF, but an entire Hawk culture. This culture focuses on honesty, discipline in air and ground and steadfast adherence to SOPs. The modern training philosophy is in tune with the IAF watch word ‚ÄúPeople First Mission Always‚Äù. At the end of the one-year training, the Station produces a fine fighter pilot, a humane gentleman and an honest officer. For its excellence in all spheres, especially in training of pilots, the Station was adjudged as the Best Flying Training Establishment in 2011 and 2014. The Station is also the proud winner of many other trophies for excellence in various other activities. The Station and the Air Force is looking forward to the formation of a new aerobatic team with Hawk Mk 132 aircraft. Efforts for this are in progress at Air HQ. Before the team is formed, the Station aims to improve its infrastructure to train many more IAF and Indian Navy pilots. The Station also aims to provide best professionals to the Operational Squadrons. This will bring in the Hawk culture of dedication, discipline and honesty in its truest sense all over the Air Force. Accidents *On 18 March 2006, Wing Commander Dheeraj Bhatia and Squadron Leader Shailendra Singh lost their lives while flying the Kiran aircraft. This was the first-ever crash involving a Surya Kiran team. It seems neither man nor machine was at fault. Aerobatics is a risky business. The reaction time is a fraction of a second. In all probability, therefore, it was an accident - This was how senior IAF officials described the crash. However, later, the cause of accident was established as human error (aircrew).A continuous and multi-faceted effort is always underway in the IAF to enhance and upgrade flight safety. *A Kiran aircraft of the Indian Air Force (IAF) crashed near Air Force Station, Bidar on 21 January 2009 kiling Wing Commander Daliwal. The incident occurred during a routine practice session by IAF's aerobatics team. This was the second fatal Surya Kiran air mishap.

They were presided over by consular officers. Extraterritoriality Constantinople, 1922 Western powers when establishing diplomatic relations with countries they considered to have underdeveloped legal systems would demand extraterritorial rights. Treaty provisions provided that the laws of the local country did not apply to citizens of the treaty powers and that local courts did not have jurisdiction over them. Consular courts were established to handle civil and criminal cases against citizens and subjects of the subjects of the country.C Lobingier, Extraterritorial Cases, Vol I, pp. 1‚Äì5 The British had the widest system of consular courts run by the Foreign Office. British consular courts could be found in Africa, the Ottoman Empire, Egypt, China, Japan, Korea and Siam.Turan Kayaoƒülu, Legal Imperialism, Sovereignty and Extraterritoriality in Japan, the Ottoman Empire, and China China and Japan In China and Japan under the \\"unequal treaties\\" signed in the mid-19th century many countries established consular courts in cities open to foreign trade (called treaty ports). Britain established a fully fledged court system in China and Japan. In 1865, the British Supreme Court for China and Japan was established in Shanghai, China as a first instance consular court for cases in the Shanghai region as well as an appellate court for cases heard by consular courts in the rest of China, Japan and, from the 1880s Korea. In 1879, a British Court for Japan was established in Yokohama to replace the Kanagawa Consular Court to hear first instance cases for Yokohama region as well as to act as an appellate court for cases from consular courts in other Japanese cities. In Japan extraterritoriality came to an end on 4 August 1899 and the British Court for Japan and other consular courts closed soon after that after finalising pending cases. In 1906, the United States established the United States Court for China modelled on the British Supreme Court for China and Japan. In China, consular courts operated up until the 1940s when extraterritoriality for most nations came to an end then.

All soil samples are to be tested in various soil testing labs across the country. Thereafter the experts will analyse the strength and weaknesses (micro-nutrients deficiency) of the soil and suggest measures to deal with it. The result and suggestion will be displayed in the cards. The government plans to issue the cards to 14 crore farmers. Scheme The scheme aims at promoting soil test based and balanced use of fertilisers to enable farmers to realise higher yields at lower cost. also the main objective is to aware growers about the appropriate amount of nutrients for the concerned crop depending on the quality of soil.

Considered to be one of his masterpieces, the painting has elicited varied interpretations of this portrait of Picasso's lover and her reflection. Background Marie-Th√©r√®se Walter, one of Picasso's muses and paramours, is the subject of the painting. During the 1930s, she became his favorite subject and in this painting he used colors and symbols to which suggest different ways to view her. The mirror and the reflected subject suggest one possibility for her own view of herself. Description The painting depicts a woman looking into a mirror, with a familiar yet contrasting mirror-image looking back at her. While the woman is painted with brighter colors and exhibits a more beautiful face, the figure in the mirror is darker and more grotesque. On top of this duality of imagery, the faces of both the woman and the reflection are bifurcated into different colorations, which suggests a duality of nature within both the girl and her reflected image. The painting features a very colorful palette, with bright pinks, yellows, and greens contrasting with vibrant reds and dark blacks. The skin and face of the girl is delicately beautiful in contrast with the rest of the painting, and is unlike many of Picasso's other Cubist faces of the time period. In contrast, the reflected face is much more grotesque and darkly colored, and the features are much less traditionally beautiful. Interpretations Pablo Picasso presents a divergent view of his subject, with a brighter figure standing before a mirror which reflects a darker mirror image. While the face of the woman herself is split into both yellow and more naturalistic colors, they contrast in their application of make-up or natural skin, suggesting a two-fold nature of beauty. The reflection in the mirror is distorted and discolored, possibly representing the woman's dislike for herself. The colors used here are dark and make her look very old. Instead of the happiness reflected in the real girl, the reflected girl seems distraught. The woman, happily gravid, is concerned that she might not be attractive any more.

He scored touchdowns on a 26-yard run in the first, a 15-yard reception from Hulet Whitaker in the second, and on a pair of runs in the third and one in the fourth. In the tie against Sewanee, Bartlett threw a 60-yard touchdown pass to Allen MacCartee. The upset of Penn 9‚Äì7 on November 4 was the highlight of the year. Alabama's own website has this account of the winning drive: \\"Alabama came back strong in the second quarter on the back of leader Charles Bartlett. Bartlett drove the team down the field on most notably a 22 yard run from the 27 that put the ball on the Penn 4 yard line. Pooley Hubert went in the rest of the way but fumbled the ball in the endzone. Shorty Propst recovered the ball and gave Alabama the 9-7 lead that they would never give up.\\" The next week Alabama beat LSU 47-3 in what was then the largest crowd ever to witness a game at Denny Field.

He is a professor at the Institute of Chemistry, CAS; Deputy Director of Key Laboratory of Photochemistry; Deputy Director of Science Committee of Molecular Sciences Centre, CAS. His research mainly focuses on the photocatalytic degradation of toxic and persistent organic pollutants. Zhao introduced -based photocatalyst under visible light, and discovered a new way for oxygen atom transfer during photocatalytic reactions. Research In the early 2000s, Zhao's group reported that visible light can accelerate the degradation of organic pollutants with aqueous solutions of iron tetrasulfophthalocyanine ([Fe(PcS)]) and . They also found out FeBR (Fe2+ complex of 2,2‚Ä≤-bipyridine) is efficient in eliminating organic pollutants such as rhodamine B (RhB), malachite green (MG) and N, N-dimethylaniline (DMA). They did several control experiments, in the dark or under irradiation, with or without irradiation. They proposed that when light is introduced, excitation of [FeIII(PcS)] can result in electron transfer from ligand(L) to Fe3+, then Fe3+ can be reduced to Fe2+. The Fe2+-L complex can react with to produce HO., leading to the degradation of pollutants.Tao, X., Ma, W., Zhang, T. and Zhao, J.

The novel follows the fictional experiences of three generations of women within one family, and contains several elements that are loosely based on Drabble's own biographical experience. The novel received mixed reviews, with some authors noting the relative weakness of Drabble's blending of fictional and biographical elements. Background Drabble, in the afterword for the novel, describes it as a loose adaptation of her mother's life. Publisher's Weekly described the fictional representation of her mother, the protagonist Bessie Bawtry, as very unsympathetic and \\"thinly veiled\\". When discussing the investigation of matrilineal traits in the novel, critic Yi-Lin Yu describes the relationship between Drabble and the fictional representation of her mother as fraught. In part, the poor representation has a lot to do with the difficulty Drabble had in evoking her mother: she originally wrote the novel, upon urging of friends after her mother's death and in the afterword, she writes that her mother \\"was a highly intelligent, angry, deeply disappointed and manipulative woman. I am not sure if I have been able to find a tone in which to create or describe her.\\" When reviewing the book, critic Nora Foster Stovel, questioned whether Drabble successfully created fiction, or whether the novel is more biography; she highlights Drabble's own doubts: \\"Maybe I should have tried to write a factual memoir of her life, but I have written this instead.\\" Stovel also notes that A.S. Byatt was not very happy with her sister's representation of their mother. Other characters bear significant relationship to parts of Drabble's life: for instance, Drabble described the scientist that opens the prologue, Dr. Robert Hawthorn, as modelled after an encounter with genetics research, Bryan Sykes at Oxford. However, Drabble was careful to emphasise that, other than her mother, none of the character's family members were based on her real family (for example, sister A.S. Byatt or daughter Rebecca Swift). Style The novel frequently juxtaposes fictional and historical narrative styles. However, this approach isn't always regarded as very successful; as critic Kelly McWilliam describes in M/C Reviews, \\"the segments recreated through various family histories (in photographs and letters, for example) and fiction, are somewhat maladroit and conspicuous.\\" Themes One of the central concerns in the novel is an exploration of the transmission of knowledge, genetics, and emotions through matrilineality. In particular, by focusing on mitochondrial DNA both in the prologue and the subsequent discussion of scientific and archaeological topics throughout the novel, Drabble deliberately excludes the fatherly line from the narrative. Biological connection through this DNA, becomes a symbolic stand in for the \\"transmission of female behavioral patterns from one generation to the next\\". The women in the novels try to break away from such cycles, such as those found in romantic relationships; but each woman becomes caught in this biological deterministic pattern. Reviewer Nora Foster Stovel notes that this focus on inherited traits along family lines grows out of an earlier desire to explore \\"inherited depression in a Midlands family\\" that Drabble expressed after writing The Radiant Way. Reception Reviews of the novel tend to emphasise the relative value of the novel, but its failure to fully execute the concepts within the novel. Publisher's Weekly noted that \\"One scarcely recognises Drabble's (The Witch of Exmoor, etc.) customary satirical verve\\". Similarly, the M/C Review, noted the relative ineffectiveness of the novels execution: \\"Overall, The Peppered Moth is a fascinating mixture of personal history threaded through a fictional narrative. While it is not, however, always a successful blend, it is inarguably an interesting one.\\" References Further reading * * Category:2000 British novels Category:Novels by Margaret Drabble ","title":"The Peppered Moth"},{"id":"45603392","text":"NGC 108 is a lenticular galaxy that is located at approximately 220 million light-years away in the constellation of Andromeda.

Extensions arise in several ways. There is the trivial extension obtained by taking a direct sum of two Lie algebras. Other types are the split extension and the central extension. Extensions may arise naturally, for instance, when forming a Lie algebra from projective group representations. Such a Lie algebra will contain central charges. Starting with a polynomial loop algebra over finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra and performing two extensions, a central extension and an extension by a derivation, one obtains a Lie algebra which is isomorphic with an untwisted affine Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra. Using the centrally extended loop algebra one may construct a current algebra in two spacetime dimensions. The Virasoro algebra is the universal central extension of the Witt algebra. Central extensions are needed in physics, because the symmetry group of a quantized system usually is a central extension of the classical symmetry group, and in the same way the corresponding symmetry Lie algebra of the quantum system is, in general, a central extension of the classical symmetry algebra. Kac‚ÄìMoody algebras have been conjectured to be symmetry groups of a unified superstring theory. The Beacon of Kac‚ÄìMoody Symmetry for Physics. (free access) The centrally extended Lie algebras play a dominant role in quantum field theory, particularly in conformal field theory, string theory and in M-theory. A large portion towards the end is devoted to background material for applications of Lie algebra extensions, both in mathematics and in physics, in areas where they are actually useful. A parenthetical link, (background material), is provided where it might be beneficial. History Due to the Lie correspondence, the theory, and consequently the history of Lie algebra extensions, is tightly linked to the theory and history of group extensions. A systematic study of group extensions was performed by the Austrian mathematician Otto Schreier in 1923 in his PhD thesis and later published. Otto Schreier (1901 - 1929) was a pioneer in the theory of extension of groups. Along with his rich research papers, his lecture notes were posthumously published (edited by Emanuel Sperner) under the name Einf√ºhrung in die analytische Geometrie und Algebra (Vol I 1931, Vol II 1935), later in 1951 translated to English in Introduction to Modern Algebra and Matrix Theory. See for further reference. The problem posed for his thesis by Otto H√∂lder was \\"given two groups and , find all groups having a normal subgroup isomorphic to such that the factor group is isomorphic to \\". Lie algebra extensions are most interesting and useful for infinite-dimensional Lie algebras. In 1967, Victor Kac and Robert Moody independently generalized the notion of classical Lie algebras, resulting in a new theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, now called Kac‚ÄìMoody algebras. They generalize the finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras and can often concretely be constructed as extensions. Notation and proofs Notational abuse to be found below includes for the exponential map given an argument, writing for the element in a direct product ( is the identity in ), and analogously for Lie algebra direct sums (where also and are used interchangeably). Likewise for semidirect products and semidirect sums. Canonical injections (both for groups and Lie algebras) are used for implicit identifications. Furthermore, if , , ..., are groups, then the default names for elements of , , ..., are , , ..., and their Lie algebras are , , ... . The default names for elements of , , ..., are , , ... (just like for the groups!), partly to save scarce alphabetical resources but mostly to have a uniform notation. Lie algebras that are ingredients in an extension will, without comment, be taken to be over the same field. The summation convention applies, including sometimes when the indices involved are both upstairs or both downstairs. Caveat: Not all proofs and proof outlines below have universal validity. The main reason is that the Lie algebras are often infinite-dimensional, and then there may or may not be a Lie group corresponding to the Lie algebra. Moreover, even if such a group exists, it may not have the \\"usual\\" properties, e.g. the exponential map might not exist, and if it does, it might not have all the \\"usual\\" properties. In such cases, it is questionable whether the group should be endowed with the \\"Lie\\" qualifier. The literature is not uniform. For the explicit examples, the relevant structures are supposedly in place. Definition Lie algebra extensions are formalized in terms of short exact sequences. A short exact sequence is an exact sequence of length three, such that is a monomorphism, is an epimorphism, and . From these properties of exact sequences, it follows that (the image of) is an ideal in . Moreover, : \\\\mathfrak g \\\\cong \\\\mathfrak e/\\\\operatorname{Im} i = \\\\mathfrak e/ \\\\operatorname{Ker} s, but it is not necessarily the case that is isomorphic to a subalgebra of . This construction mirrors the analogous constructions in the closely related concept of group extensions. If the situation in prevails, non-trivially and for Lie algebras over the same field, then one says that is an extension of by . Properties The defining property may be reformulated. The Lie algebra is an extension of by if is exact. Here the zeros on the ends represent the zero Lie algebra (containing the null vector only) and the maps are the obvious ones; maps to and maps all elements of to . With this definition, it follows automatically that is a monomorphism and is an epimorphism. An extension of by is not necessarily unique. Let denote two extensions and let the primes below have the obvious interpretation. Then, if there exists a Lie algebra isomorphism such that :f \\\\circ i = i', \\\\quad s' \\\\circ f = s, 200px then the extensions and are said to be equivalent extensions. Equivalence of extensions is an equivalence relation. Extension types =Trivial= A Lie algebra extension : \\\\mathfrak h \\\\; \\\\overset i \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\; \\\\mathfrak t \\\\; \\\\overset s \\\\twoheadrightarrow \\\\; \\\\mathfrak g, is trivial if there is a subspace such that and is an ideal in . =Split= A Lie algebra extension : \\\\mathfrak h \\\\; \\\\overset i \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\; \\\\mathfrak s \\\\; \\\\overset s \\\\twoheadrightarrow \\\\; \\\\mathfrak g, is split if there is a subspace such that as a vector space and is a subalgebra in . An ideal is a subalgebra, but a subalgebra is not necessarily an ideal. A trivial extension is thus a split extension. =Central= Central extensions of a Lie algebra by an abelian Lie algebra can be obtained with the help of a so-called (nontrivial) 2-cocycle (background) on . Non-trivial 2-cocycles occur in the context of projective representations (background) of Lie groups. This is alluded to further down. A Lie algebra extension : \\\\mathfrak h \\\\; \\\\overset i \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\; \\\\mathfrak c \\\\; \\\\overset s \\\\twoheadrightarrow \\\\; \\\\mathfrak g, is a central extension if is contained in the center of . Properties *Since the center commutes with everything, in this case is abelian. *Given a central extension of , one may construct a 2-cocycle on . Suppose is a central extension of by . Let be a linear map from to with the property that , i.e. is a section of . Use this section to define by : \\\\epsilon(G_1, G_2) = l([G_1, G_2]) - [l(G_1), l(G_2)], \\\\quad G_1, G_2 \\\\in \\\\mathfrak g. 200px The map satisfies : \\\\epsilon(G_1, [G_2, G_3]) + \\\\epsilon(G_2, [G_3, G_1]) + \\\\epsilon(G_3, [G_1, G_2]) = 0 \\\\in \\\\mathfrak e. To see this, use the definition of on the left hand side, then use the linearity of . Use Jacobi identity on to get rid of half of the six terms. Use the definition of again on terms sitting inside three Lie brackets, bilinearity of Lie brackets, and the Jacobi identity on , and then finally use on the three remaining terms that and that so that brackets to zero with everything. It then follows that satisfies the corresponding relation, and if in addition is one-dimensional, then is a 2-cocycle on (via a trivial correspondence of with the underlying field). A central extension : 0 \\\\; \\\\overset \\\\iota \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\mathfrak h \\\\; \\\\overset i \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\; \\\\mathfrak e \\\\; \\\\overset s \\\\twoheadrightarrow \\\\; \\\\mathfrak g \\\\; \\\\overset \\\\sigma \\\\twoheadrightarrow \\\\; 0 is universal if for every other central extension : 0 \\\\; \\\\overset \\\\iota \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\mathfrak h' \\\\; \\\\overset {i'} \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\; \\\\mathfrak e' \\\\; \\\\overset {s'} \\\\twoheadrightarrow \\\\; \\\\mathfrak g \\\\; \\\\overset \\\\sigma \\\\twoheadrightarrow \\\\; 0 there exist unique homomorphisms \\\\Phi : \\\\mathfrak e \\\\to \\\\mathfrak e' and \\\\Psi : \\\\mathfrak h \\\\to \\\\mathfrak h' such that the diagram 400px commutes, i.e. and . By universality, it is easy to conclude that such universal central extensions are unique up to isomorphism. Construction =By direct sum= Let be Lie algebras over the same field . Define :\\\\mathfrak e = \\\\mathfrak h \\\\times \\\\mathfrak g, and define addition pointwise on . Scalar multiplication is defined by :\\\\alpha(H, G) = (\\\\alpha H, \\\\alpha G), \\\\alpha \\\\in F, H \\\\in \\\\mathfrak h, G \\\\in \\\\mathfrak g. With these definitions, is a vector space over . With the Lie bracket is a Lie algebra. Define further :i:\\\\mathfrak h \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\mathfrak e; H \\\\mapsto (H, 0), \\\\quad s:\\\\mathfrak e \\\\twoheadrightarrow \\\\mathfrak g; (H, G) \\\\mapsto G. It is clear that holds as an exact sequence. This extension of by is called a trivial extension. It is, of course, nothing else than the Lie algebra direct sum. By symmetry of definitions, is an extension of by as well, but . It is clear from that the subalgebra is an ideal (Lie algebra). This property of the direct sum of Lie algebras is promoted to the definition of a trivial extension. =By semidirect sum= Inspired by the construction of a semidirect product (background) of groups using a homomorphism , one can make the corresponding construct for Lie algebras. If is a Lie algebra homomorphism, then define a Lie bracket on by With this Lie bracket, the Lie algebra so obtained is denoted and is called the semidirect sum of and . By inspection of one sees that is a subalgebra of and is an ideal in . Define by and by . It is clear that . Thus is a Lie algebra extension of by . As with the trivial extension, this property generalizes to the definition of a split extension. Example Let be the Lorentz group and let denote the translation group in 4 dimensions, isomorphic to , and consider the multiplication rule of the Poincar√© group :(a_2, \\\\Lambda_2)(a_1, \\\\Lambda_1) = (a_2 + \\\\Lambda_2a_1, \\\\Lambda_2\\\\Lambda_1), \\\\quad a_1, a_2 \\\\in \\\\mathrm T \\\\subset P, \\\\Lambda_1, \\\\Lambda_2 \\\\in \\\\mathrm O(3,1) \\\\subset \\\\mathrm P, (where and are identified with their images in ). From it follows immediately that, in the Poincar√© group, . Thus every Lorentz transformation corresponds to an automorphism of with inverse and is clearly a homomorphism. Now define :\\\\overline \\\\mathrm P = \\\\mathrm T \\\\otimes_S \\\\mathrm O(3, 1), endowed with multiplication given by . Unwinding the definitions one finds that the multiplication is the same as the multiplication one started with and it follows that . From follows that and then from it follows that . =By derivation= Let be a derivation (background) of and denote by the one- dimensional Lie algebra spanned by . Define the Lie bracket on byTo show that the Jacobi identity holds, one writes everything out, uses the fact that the underlying Lie algebras have a Lie product satisfying the Jacobi identity, and that . :[G_1 + H_1, G_2 + H_2] = [\\\\lambda\\\\delta + H_1, \\\\mu\\\\delta + H_2] = [H_1, H_2] + \\\\lambda \\\\delta(H_1) - \\\\mu \\\\delta(H_2). It is obvious from the definition of the bracket that is and ideal in in and that is a subalgebra of . Furthermore, is complementary to in . Let be given by and by . It is clear that . Thus is a split extension of by . Such an extension is called extension by a derivation. If is defined by , then is a Lie algebra homomorphism into . Hence this construction is a special case of a semidirect sum, for when starting from and using the construction in the preceding section, the same Lie brackets result. =By 2-cocycle= If is a 2-cocycle (background) on a Lie algebra and is any one-dimensional vector space, let (vector space direct sum) and define a Lie bracket on by : [\\\\mu H + G_1, u H + G_2] = [G_1, G_2] + \\\\epsilon(G1, G2)H, \\\\quad \\\\mu, u \\\\in F. Here is an arbitrary but fixed element of . Antisymmetry follows from antisymmetry of the Lie bracket on and antisymmetry of the 2-cocycle. The Jacobi identity follows from the corresponding properties of and of . Thus is a Lie algebra. Put and it follows that . Also, it follows with and that . Hence is a central extension of by . It is called extension by a 2-cocycle. Theorems Below follows some results regarding central extensions and 2-cocycles. Theorem Let and be cohomologous 2-cocycles on a Lie algebra and let and be respectively the central extensions constructed with these 2-cocycles. Then the central extensions and are equivalent extensions. Proof By definition, . Define : \\\\psi: G + \\\\mu c \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{e}_1 \\\\mapsto G + \\\\mu c + f(G)c \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{e}_2. It follows from the definitions that is a Lie algebra isomorphism and holds. Corollary A cohomology class defines a central extension of which is unique up to isomorphism. The trivial 2-cocycle gives the trivial extension, and since a 2-coboundary is cohomologous with the trivial 2-cocycle, one has Corollary A central extension defined by a coboundary is equivalent with a trivial central extension. Theorem A finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra has only trivial central extensions. Proof Since every central extension comes from a 2-cocycle , it suffices to show that every 2-cocycle is a coboundary. Suppose is a 2-cocycle on . The task is to use this 2-cocycle to manufacture a 1-cochain such that . The first step is to for each use to define a linear map . But the linear maps are elements of . This suffices to express in terms of , using the isomorphism . Next, a linear map is defined that turns out to be a derivation. Since all derivations are inner, one has for some . An expression for in terms of and is obtained. Thus set, trusting that is a derivation, :\\\\varphi(G_1, G_2) \\\\equiv \\\\rho_{G_1}(G_2) = K( u^{-1}(\\\\rho_{G_1}), G_2) \\\\equiv K(d(G_1), G_2) = K(\\\\mathrm{ad}_{G_d}(G_1), G_2) = K([G_d, G_1], G_2) = K(G_d, [G_1, G_2]). Let be the 1-cochain defined by :f(G) = K(G_d,G). Then :\\\\delta f(G_1, G_2) = f([G_1, G_2]) = K(G_d,[G_1, G_2]) = \\\\varphi(G_1, G_2), showing that is a coboundary. By the previous results, any central extension is trivial. To verify that actually is a derivation, first note that it is linear since is, then compute :\\\\begin{align}K(d([G_1, G_2]), G_3)) &= \\\\varphi([G_1, G_2]), G_3)) = \\\\varphi(G_1,[G_2, G_3]) + \\\\varphi(G_2, [G_3, G_1]) &= K(d(G_1),[G_2, G_3]) + K(d(G_1), (G_3, G_1)) = K([d(G_1),G_2], G_3) + K([G_1, d(G_2)], G_3)) &= K([d(G_1), G_2] + [G_1, d(G_2)], G_3).\\\\end{align} By appeal to the non-degeneracy of , the left arguments of are equal on the far left and far right. The observation that one can define a derivation , given a symmetric non-degenerate associative form and a 2-cocycle , by :K( u^{-1}(\\\\rho_{G_1}), G_2) \\\\equiv K(d(G_1), G_2), or using the symmetry of and the antisymmetry of , :K(d(G_1), G_2) = -K(G_1, d(G_2)), leads to a corollary. Corollary Let be a non-degenerate symmetric associative bilinear form and let be a derivation satisfying :L(d(G_1), G_2) = -L(G_1, d(G_2)), then defined by :\\\\varphi(G_1, G_2) = L(d(G_1), G_2) is a 2-cocycle. Proof The condition on ensures the antisymmetry of . The Jacobi identity for 2-cocycles follows starting with :\\\\varphi([G1, G_2], G_3) = L(d[G1, G_2], G_3) = L([d(G1), G_2], G_3) + L([G1, d(G_2)], G_3), using symmetry of the form, the antisymmetry of the bracket, and once again the definition of in terms of . If is the Lie algebra of a Lie group and is a central extension of , one may ask whether there is a Lie group with Lie algebra . The answer is, by Lie's third theorem affirmative. But is there a central extension of with Lie algebra ? The answer to this question requires some machinery, and can be found in . Applications The \\"negative\\" result of the preceding theorem indicates that one must, at least for semisimple Lie algebras, go to infinite-dimensional Lie algebras to find useful applications of central extensions. There are indeed such. Here will be presented affine Kac‚ÄìMoody algebras and Virasoro algebras. These are extensions of polynomial loop-algebras and the Witt algebra respectively. =Polynomial loop-algebra= Let be a polynomial loop algebra (background), :\\\\mathfrak g = C[\\\\lambda, \\\\lambda^{-1}] \\\\otimes \\\\mathfrak g_0, where is a complex finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra. The goal is to find a central extension of this algebra. Two of the theorems apply. On the one hand, if there is a 2-cocycle on , then a central extension may be defined. On the other hand, if this 2-cocycle is acting on the part (only), then the resulting extension is trivial. Moreover, derivations acting on (only) cannot be used for definition of a 2-cocycle either because these derivations are all inner and the same problem results. One therefore looks for derivations on . One such set of derivations is :d_k \\\\equiv \\\\lambda^{k+1}\\\\frac{d}{d\\\\lambda}, \\\\quad k \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z. In order to manufacture a non-degenerate bilinear associative antisymmetric form on , attention is focused first on restrictions on the arguments, with fixed. It is a theorem that every form satisfying the requirements is a multiple of the Killing form on . Corollary 22.2.9. This requires :L(\\\\lambda^l \\\\otimes G_1, \\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_2) = \\\\gamma_{lm}K(G_1, G_2). Symmetry of implies :\\\\gamma_{mn}=\\\\gamma_{nm}, and associativity yields :\\\\gamma_{k+l,m}=\\\\gamma_{k,l+m}. With one sees that . This last condition implies the former. Using this fact, define . The defining equation then becomes :L(\\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_1, \\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_2) = f(l+m)K(G_1, G_2). For every the definition :f(n) = \\\\delta_{ni} \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\gamma_{lm}=\\\\delta_{l+m, i} does define a symmetric associative bilinear form :L_i(\\\\lambda^l \\\\otimes G_1, \\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_2) = \\\\delta_{l+m,i}K(G_1, G_2). But these forms the basis of a vector space in which every form has the right properties. Returning to the derivations at hand and the condition :L_i(d_k(\\\\lambda^l \\\\otimes G_1), \\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_2) = -L_i(\\\\lambda^l \\\\otimes G_1, d_k(\\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_2)), one sees, using the definitions, that :l\\\\delta_{k+l+m,i} = -m\\\\delta_{k+l+m,i}, or, with , :n\\\\delta_{k+n,i} = 0. This (and the antisymmetry condition) holds if , in particular it holds when . Thus chose and . With these choices, the premises in the corollary are satisfied. The 2-cocycle defined by :\\\\varphi(P(\\\\lambda) \\\\otimes G_1), Q(\\\\lambda) \\\\otimes G_2)) = L(\\\\lambda\\\\frac{dP}{d\\\\lambda} \\\\otimes G_1, Q(\\\\lambda) \\\\otimes G_2) is finally employed to define a central extension of , :\\\\mathfrak e = \\\\mathfrak g \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb CC, with Lie bracket :[P(\\\\lambda) \\\\otimes G_1 + \\\\mu C, Q(\\\\lambda) \\\\otimes G_2 + u C] = P(\\\\lambda)Q(\\\\lambda)\\\\otimes[G_1, G_2] + \\\\varphi(P(\\\\lambda) \\\\otimes G_1,Q(\\\\lambda) \\\\otimes G_2)C. For basis elements, suitably normalized and with antisymmetric structure constants, one has :\\\\begin{align}{}[\\\\lambda^l \\\\otimes G_i + \\\\mu C, \\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_j + u C] &= \\\\lambda^{l+m}\\\\otimes[G_i, G_j] + \\\\varphi(\\\\lambda^l \\\\otimes G_i,\\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_j)C &= \\\\lambda^{l+m}\\\\otimes {C_{ij}}^kG_k + L(\\\\lambda \\\\frac{d\\\\lambda^l}{d\\\\lambda} \\\\otimes G_i, \\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_j)C &=\\\\lambda^{l+m}\\\\otimes {C_{ij}}^kG_k + lL(\\\\lambda^l \\\\otimes G_i, \\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_j)C &=\\\\lambda^{l+m}\\\\otimes {C_{ij}}^kG_k + l\\\\delta_{l+m, 0}K(G_i, G_j)C &=\\\\lambda^{l+m}\\\\otimes {C_{ij}}^kG_k + l\\\\delta_{l+m, 0}{C_{ik}}^m{C_{jm}}^kC = \\\\lambda^{l+m}\\\\otimes {C_{ij}}^kG_k + l\\\\delta_{l+m, 0}\\\\delta^{ij}C. \\\\end{align} This is a universal central extension of the polynomial loop algebra. Exercise 7.8. ;A note on terminology In physics terminology, the algebra of above might pass for a Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra, whilst it will probably not in mathematics terminology. An additional dimension, an extension by a derivation is required for this. Nonetheless, if, in a physical application, the eigenvalues of or its representative are interpreted as (ordinary) quantum numbers, the additional superscript on the generators is referred to as the level. It is an additional quantum number. An additional operator whose eigenvalues are precisely the levels is introduced further below. =Current algebra= Murray Gell-Mann, 1969 Nobel Laureate in physics, initiated the field of current algebra in the 1960s. It exploits known local symmetries even without knowledge of the underlying dynamics to extract predictions, e.g. the Adler‚ÄìWeisberger sum rule. As an application of a central extension of polynomial loop algebra, a current algebra of a quantum field theory is considered (background). Suppose one has a current algebra, with the interesting commutator being ^cJ_c^i(t, \\\\mathbf x)\\\\delta(\\\\mathbf x - \\\\mathbf y) + S_{ab}^{ij}\\\\partial_j\\\\delta(\\\\mathbf x - \\\\mathbf y) + ... ,}} with a Schwinger term. To construct this algebra mathematically, let be the centrally extended polynomial loop algebra of the previous section with :[\\\\lambda^l \\\\otimes G_i + \\\\mu C, \\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_j + u C] = \\\\lambda^{l+m}\\\\otimes {C_{ij}}^kG_k + l\\\\delta_{l+m, 0}\\\\delta_{ij}C as one of the commutation relations, or, with a switch of notation () with a factor of under the physics convention, :[T^m_a, T^n_b] = i{C_{ab}}^cT^{m+n}_c + m\\\\delta_{m+n, 0}\\\\delta_{ab}C. Define using elements of , :J_a(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{L}\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}e^{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi inx}{L}}T_a^{-n}, x \\\\in \\\\mathbb R. One notes that :J_a(x+L) = J_a(x) so that it is defined on a circle. Now compute the commutator, :\\\\begin{align}[] [J_a(x),J_b(y)]&= \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{L}\\\\right)^2\\\\left[\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}e^{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi inx}{L}}T_a^{-n}, \\\\sum_{m=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}e^{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi imy}{L}}T_b^{-m}\\\\right] &=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{L}\\\\right)^2 \\\\sum_{m,n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi inx}{L}} e^{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi imy}{L}} [T_a^{-n},T_b^{-m}].\\\\end{align} For simplicity, switch coordinates so that and use the commutation relations, :\\\\begin{align}[] [J_a(z),J_b(0)] &= \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{L}\\\\right)^2\\\\sum_{m,n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi inz}{L}}[i{C_{ab}}^cT^{-m-n}_c + m\\\\delta_{m+n, 0}\\\\delta_{ab}C] &=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{L}\\\\right)^2\\\\sum_{m=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i(-m)z}{L}}\\\\sum_{l=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty ie^{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i(l)z}{L}}{C_{ab}}^cT^{-l}_c + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{L}\\\\right)^2\\\\sum_{m,n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}e^{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi inz}{L}}m\\\\delta_{m+n, 0}\\\\delta_{ab}C &=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{L}\\\\right)\\\\sum_{m=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi imz}{L}}i{C_{ab}}^cJ_c(z) - \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{L}\\\\right)^2\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}e^{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi inz}{L}}n\\\\delta_{ab}C\\\\end{align} Now employ the Poisson summation formula, :\\\\frac{1}{L}\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{\\\\frac{-2\\\\pi inz}{L}} = \\\\frac{1}{L}\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\delta(z + nL) = \\\\delta(z) for in the interval and differentiate it to yield :-\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{L^2}\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty ne^{\\\\frac{-2\\\\pi inz}{L}} = \\\\delta'(z), and finally :[J_a(x-y),J_b(0)] = i\\\\hbar {C_{ab}}^cJ_c(x-y)\\\\delta(x-y) + \\\\frac{i\\\\hbar^2}{2\\\\pi}\\\\delta_{ab}C\\\\delta'(x-y), or :[J_a(x),J_b(y)] = i\\\\hbar {C_{ab}}^cJ_c(x)\\\\delta(x-y) + \\\\frac{i\\\\hbar^2}{2\\\\pi}\\\\delta_{ab}C\\\\delta'(x-y), since the delta functions arguments only ensure that the arguments of the left and right arguments of the commutator are equal (formally ). By comparison with , this is a current algebra in two spacetime dimensions, including a Schwinger term, with the space dimension curled up into a circle. In the classical setting of quantum field theory, this is perhaps of little use, but with the advent of string theory where fields live on world sheets of strings, and spatial dimensions are curled up, there may be relevant applications. =Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra= Robert Moody (left), Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, is a Canadian mathematician at University of Alberta. He is co- discoverer of the Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra together with Victor Kac, Fellow of the American Mathematical Society, a Russian mathematician working at MIT. The derivation used in the construction of the 2-cocycle in the previous section can be extended to a derivation on the centrally extended polynomial loop algebra, here denoted by in order to realize a Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra (background). Simply set :D(P(\\\\lambda) \\\\otimes G + \\\\mu C) = \\\\lambda \\\\frac{dP(\\\\lambda)}{d\\\\lambda} \\\\otimes G. Next, define as a vector space :\\\\mathfrak e = \\\\mathbb Cd + \\\\mathfrak g. The Lie bracket on is, according to the standard construction with a derivation, given on a basis by :\\\\begin{align}{}[\\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_1 + \\\\mu C + u D, \\\\lambda^n \\\\otimes G_2 + \\\\mu' C + u' D] &= \\\\lambda^{m+n} \\\\otimes [G_1, G_2] + m\\\\delta_{m+n,0}K(G_1, G_2)C + u D(\\\\lambda^n \\\\otimes G_1) - u'D(\\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_2) &= \\\\lambda^{m+n} \\\\otimes [G_1, G_2] + m\\\\delta_{m+n,0}K(G_1, G_2)C + u n\\\\lambda^n \\\\otimes G_1 - u'm \\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_2.\\\\end{align} For convenience, define :G_i^m \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_i. In addition, assume the basis on the underlying finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra has been chosen so that the structure coefficients are antisymmetric in all indices and that the basis is appropriately normalized. Then one immediately through the definitions verifies the following commutation relations. :\\\\begin{align}{}[G_i^m,G_j^n] &= {C_{ij}}^kG_k^{m+n} + m\\\\delta_{ij}\\\\delta^{m+n,0}C, {}[C,G_i^m] &= 0, \\\\quad 1 \\\\le i, j, N,\\\\quad m,n \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z {}[D, G_i^m] &= mG_i^m {}[D,C] &= 0.\\\\end{align} These are precisely the short-hand description of an untwisted affine Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra. To recapitulate, begin with a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra. Define a space of formal Laurent polynomials with coefficients in the finite- dimensional simple Lie algebra. With the support of a symmetric non-degenerate alternating bilinear form and a derivation, a 2-cocycle is defined, subsequently used in the standard prescription for a central extension by a 2-cocycle. Extend the derivation to this new space, use the standard prescription for a split extension by a derivation and an untwisted affine Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra obtains. =Virasoro algebra= The purpose is to construct the Virasoro algebra, due to Miguel Angel Virasoro,Miguel Angel Virasoro, born 1940 is an Argentine physicist. The Virasoro algebra, named after him, was first published in as a central extension by a 2-cocycle of the Witt algebra (background). The Jacobi identity for 2-cocycles yields Letting and using antisymmetry of one obtains :(m+p)\\\\eta_{mp}=(m-p)\\\\eta_{m+p,0}. In the extension, the commutation relations for the element are :[d_0 + \\\\mu C, d_m + u C]_\\\\varphi = -md_m + \\\\eta_{0m}C = -m(d_m - \\\\frac{\\\\eta_{0m}}{m}C). It is desirable to get rid of the central charge on the right hand side. To do this define :f:W \\\\to \\\\mathbb C; d_m \\\\to \\\\frac{\\\\varphi(d_0,d_m)}{m} = \\\\frac{\\\\eta_{0m}}{m}. Then, using as a 1-cochain, :\\\\eta'_{0n} = \\\\varphi'(d_0, d_n) = \\\\varphi(d_0, d_n) + \\\\delta f([d_0, d_n]) = \\\\varphi(d_0, d_n) -n \\\\frac{\\\\eta^{0n}}{n}= 0, so with this 2-cocycle, equivalent to the previous one, one hasThe same effect can be obtained by a change of basis in . :[d_0 + \\\\mu C, d_m + u C]_{\\\\varphi'} = -md_m. With this new 2-cocycle (skip the prime) the condition becomes :(n+p)\\\\eta_{mp} = (n-p)\\\\eta_{m+p,0}=0, and thus :\\\\eta_{mp}=a(m)\\\\delta_{m. -p}, \\\\quad a(-m) = -a(m), where the last condition is due to the antisymmetry of the Lie bracket. With this, and with (cutting out a \\"plane\\" in ), yields :(2m+p)a(p) + (m-p)a(m+p) + (m+2p)a(m) = 0, that with (cutting out a \\"line\\" in ) becomes :(m-1)a(m+1) - (m+2)a(m) + (2m+1)a(1) = 0. This is a difference equation generally solved by :a(m) = \\\\alpha m + \\\\beta m^3. The commutator in the extension on elements of is then :[d_l, d_m] = (l-m)d_{l+m} + (\\\\alpha m + \\\\beta m^3)\\\\delta_{l,-m}C. With it is possible to change basis (or modify the 2-cocycle by a 2-coboundary) so that :[d'_l, d'_m] = (l-m)d_{l+m}, with the central charge absent altogether, and the extension is hence trivial. (This was not (generally) the case with the previous modification, where only obtained the original relations.) With the following change of basis, :d'_l = d_l + \\\\delta_{0l}\\\\frac{\\\\alpha+\\\\gamma}{2}C, the commutation relations take the form :[d'_l, d'_m] = (l-m)d'_{l+m} + (\\\\gamma m + \\\\beta m^3)\\\\delta_{l,-m}C, showing that the part linear in is trivial. It also shows that is one-dimensional (corresponding to the choice of ). The conventional choice is to take and still retaining freedom by absorbing an arbitrary factor in the arbitrary object . The Virasoro algebra is then :\\\\mathcal V = \\\\mathcal W + \\\\mathbb C C, with commutation relations Bosonic open strings The relativistic classical open string (background) is subject to quantization. This roughly amounts to taking the position and the momentum of the string and promoting them to operators on the space of states of open strings. Since strings are extended objects, this results in a continuum of operators depending on the parameter . The following commutation relations are postulated in the Heisenberg picture. :\\\\begin{align}{}[X^I(\\\\tau, \\\\sigma), \\\\mathcal P^{\\\\tau J}(\\\\tau, \\\\sigma)] &= i\\\\eta^{IJ}\\\\delta(\\\\sigma-\\\\sigma'), {}[x_0^-(\\\\tau),p^+(\\\\tau)] &= -i.\\\\end{align} All other commutators vanish. Because of the continuum of operators, and because of the delta functions, it is desirable to express these relations instead in terms of the quantized versions of the Virasoro modes, the Virasoro operators. These are calculated to satisfy :[\\\\alpha_m^I, \\\\alpha_n^J] = m\\\\eta^{IJ}\\\\delta_{m+n,0} They are interpreted as creation and annihilation operators acting on Hilbert space, increasing or decreasing the quantum of their respective modes. If the index is negative, the operator is a creation operator, otherwise it is an annihilation operator. (If it is zero, it is proportional to the total momentum operator.) In view of the fact that the light cone plus and minus modes were expressed in terms of the transverse Virasoro modes, one must consider the commutation relations between the Virasoro operators. These were classically defined (then modes) as :L_n = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{p \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z}\\\\alpha_{n-p}^I\\\\alpha_p^I. Since, in the quantized theory, the alphas are operators, the ordering of the factors matter. In view of the commutation relation between the mode operators, it will only matter for the operator (for which ). is chosen normal ordered, :L_0 = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\alpha_0^I\\\\alpha_0^I + \\\\sum_{p=1}^\\\\infty \\\\alpha_{-p}^I\\\\alpha_p^I, = \\\\alpha' p^Ip^I + \\\\sum_{p=1}^\\\\infty p \\\\alpha_{p}^{I\\\\dagger}\\\\alpha_p^I + c where is a possible ordering constant. One obtains after a somewhat lengthy calculation the relations :[L_m, L_n] = (m-n)L_{m+n}, \\\\quad m+n e 0. If one would allow for above, then one has precisely the commutation relations of the Witt algebra. Instead one has :[L_m, L_n] = (m-n)L_{m+n} + \\\\frac{D-2}{12}(m^3-m)\\\\delta_{m+n,0},\\\\quad \\\\forall m,n \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z. upon identification of the generic central term as times the identity operator, this is the Virasoro algebra, the universal central extension of the Witt algebra. The operator enters the theory as the Hamiltonian, modulo an additive constant. Moreover, the Virasoro operators enter into the definition of the Lorentz generators of the theory. It is perhaps the most important algebra in string theory. The consistency of the Lorentz generators, by the way, fixes the spacetime dimensionality to 26. While this theory presented here (for relative simplicity of exposition) is unphysical, or at the very least incomplete (it has, for instance, no fermions) the Virasoro algebra arises in the same way in the more viable superstring theory and M-theory. =Group extension= A projective representation of a Lie group (background) can be used to define a so-called group extension . In quantum mechanics, Wigner's theorem asserts that if is a symmetry group, then it will be represented projectively on Hilbert space by unitary or antiunitary operators. This is often dealt with by passing to the universal covering group of and take it as the symmetry group. This works nicely for the rotation group and the Lorentz group , but it does not work when the symmetry group is the Galilean group. In this case one has to pass to its central extension, the Bargmann group, which is the symmetry group of the Schr√∂dinger equation. Likewise, if , the group of translations in position and momentum space, one has to pass to its central extension, the Heisenberg group. Let be the 2-cocycle on induced by . DefineIf the 2-cocycle takes its values in the abelian group , i. e. it is a phase factor, which will always be the case in the contezt of Wigner's theorem, then may be replaced with in the construction. :G_{\\\\mathrm {ex}} = \\\\mathbb C^* \\\\times G = \\\\\\\\{(\\\\lambda,g)\\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathbb C, g \\\\in G\\\\\\\\} as a set and let the multiplication be defined by :(\\\\lambda_1,g_1)(\\\\lambda_2,g_2) = (\\\\lambda_1\\\\lambda_2\\\\omega(g_1,g_2),g_1g_2). Associativity holds since is a 2-cocycle on . One has for the unit element :(1,e)(\\\\lambda,g) = (\\\\lambda\\\\omega(e,g),g) = (\\\\lambda,g) = (\\\\lambda,g)(1,e), and for the inverse :(\\\\lambda,g)^{-1} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda \\\\omega(g, g^{-1})}, g^{-1}\\\\right). The set is an abelian subgroup of . This means that is not semisimple. The center of , includes this subgroup. The center may be larger. At the level of Lie algebras it can be shown that the Lie algebra of is given by :\\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\mathrm{ex}} = \\\\mathbb CC \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak g, as a vector space and endowed with the Lie bracket :[\\\\mu C + G_1, u C + G_2] = [G_1, G_2] + \\\\eta(G_1, G_2)C. Here is a 2-cocycle on . This 2-cocycle can be obtained from albeit in a highly nontrivial way. The reference states the fact and that it is difficult to show. No further references are given. Expressions on a slightly different form can be found though in and . Now by using the projective representation one may define a map by :\\\\Pi_{\\\\mathrm{ex}}((\\\\lambda,g)) = \\\\lambda\\\\Pi(g). It has the properties :\\\\Pi_{\\\\mathrm{ex}}((\\\\lambda_1,g_1))\\\\Pi_{\\\\mathrm{ex}}((\\\\lambda_2,g_2))=\\\\lambda_1\\\\lambda_2\\\\Pi(g_1)\\\\Pi(g_2)=\\\\lambda_1\\\\lambda_2\\\\omega(g_1,g_2)\\\\Pi(g_1g_2)=\\\\Pi_{\\\\mathrm{ex}}(\\\\lambda_1\\\\lambda_2\\\\omega(g_1,g_2),g_1g_2) = \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathrm{ex}}((\\\\lambda_1, g_1)(\\\\lambda_2,g_2)), so is a bona fide representation of . In the context of Wigner's theorem, the situation may be depicted as such (replace by ); let denote the unit sphere in Hilbert space , and let be its inner product. Let denote ray space and the ray product. Let moreover a wiggly arrow denote a group action. Then the diagram center commutes, i.e. :\\\\pi_2 \\\\circ \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathrm{ex}}((\\\\lambda, g))(\\\\psi) = \\\\Pi \\\\circ \\\\pi(g)(\\\\pi_1(\\\\psi)), \\\\quad \\\\psi \\\\in S\\\\mathcal H. Moreover, in the same way that is a symmetry of preserving , is a symmetry of preserving . The fibers of are all circles. These circles are left invariant under the action of . The action of on these fibers is transitive with no fixed point. The conclusion is that is a principal fiber bundle over with structure group . Background material In order to adequately discuss extensions, structure that goes beyond the defining properties of a Lie algebra is needed. Rudimentary facts about these are collected here for quick reference. =Derivations= A derivation on a Lie algebra is a map :\\\\delta: \\\\mathfrak g \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathfrak g such that the Leibniz rule :\\\\delta[G_1, G_2] = [\\\\delta G_1, G_2] + [G_1, \\\\delta G_2] holds. The set of derivations on a Lie algebra is denoted . It is itself a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket :[\\\\delta_1, \\\\delta_2] = \\\\delta_1 \\\\circ \\\\delta_2 - \\\\delta_2 \\\\circ \\\\delta_1. It is the Lie algebra of the group of automorphisms of . One has to show :\\\\delta[G_1, G_1] = [\\\\delta G_1, G_2] + [G_1, \\\\delta G_2] \\\\Leftrightarrow e^{t\\\\delta}[G_1,G_2] = [e^{t\\\\delta}G_1, e^{t\\\\delta}G_2], \\\\quad \\\\forall t \\\\in \\\\mathbb R. If the rhs holds, differentiate and set implying that the lhs holds. If the lhs holds , write the rhs as :[G_1,G_2]\\\\; \\\\overset{?}{=}\\\\; e^{-t\\\\delta}[e^{t\\\\delta}G_1, e^{t\\\\delta}G_2], and differentiate the rhs of this expression. It is, using , identically zero. Hence the rhs of this expression is independent of and equals its value for , which is the lhs of this expression. If , then , acting by , is a derivation. The set is the set of inner derivations on . For finite- dimensional simple Lie algebras all derivations are inner derivations. =Semidirect product (groups)= Consider two Lie groups and and , the automorphism group of . The latter is the group of isomorphisms of . If there is a Lie group homomorphism , then for each there is a with the property . Denote with the set and define multiplication by Then is a group with identity and the inverse is given by . Using the expression for the inverse and equation it is seen that is normal in . Denote the group with this semidirect product as . Conversely, if is a given semidirect product expression of the group , then by definition is normal in and for each where and the map is a homomorphism. Now make use of the Lie correspondence. The maps each induce, at the level of Lie algebras, a map . This map is computed by For instance, if and are both subgroups of a larger group and , then and one recognizes as the adjoint action of on restricted to . Now [ if is finite-dimensional] is a homomorphism,To see this, apply formula to , recall that is a homomorphism, and use a couple of times. and appealing once more to the Lie correspondence, there is a unique Lie algebra homomorphism .The fact that the Lie algebra of is , the set of all derivations of (itself being a Lie algebra under the obvious bracket), can be found in This map is (formally) given by \\\\right_{t=0},\\\\quad G \\\\in \\\\mathfrak g}} for example, if , then (formally) \\\\right_{t=0} = \\\\left .\\\\frac{d}{dt}e^{\\\\mathrm{ad}_{tG}}\\\\right_{t=0} = \\\\mathrm{ad}_G,}} where a relationship between and the adjoint action rigorously proved in here is used. Lie algebra The Lie algebra is, as a vector space, . This is clear since generates and . The Lie bracket is given by :[H_1 + G_1,H_2 + G_2]_\\\\mathfrak e = [H_1, H_2]_\\\\mathfrak h + \\\\psi_{G_1}(H_2) -\\\\psi_{G_2}(H_1) + [G_1, G_2]_\\\\mathfrak g. To compute the Lie bracket, begin with a surface in parametrized by and . Elements of in are decorated with a bar, and likewise for . : \\\\begin{align} e^{e^{t\\\\overline{G}}s\\\\overline{H}e^{-t\\\\overline{G}}} &= e^{t\\\\overline{G}}e^{s\\\\overline{H}}e^{-t\\\\overline{G}}=(1,e^{tG})(e^{sH},1)(1,e^{-tG}) &=(\\\\phi_{e^{tG}}(e^{sH}), e^{tG})(1,e^{-tG}) = (\\\\phi_{e^{tG}}(e^{sH})\\\\phi_{e^{tG}}(1),1) &= (\\\\phi_{e^{tG}}(e^{sH}),1) \\\\end{align} One has : \\\\frac{d}{ds} \\\\left. e^{Ad_{e^{t\\\\overline{G}}}s\\\\overline{H}}\\\\right_{s=0} = Ad_{e^{t\\\\overline{G}}}\\\\overline{H} and : \\\\frac{d}{ds} \\\\left. (\\\\phi_{e^{tG}}(e^{sH}),1)\\\\right_{s = 0} = (\\\\Psi_{e^{tG}}(H), 0) by and thus : Ad_{e^{t\\\\overline{G}}}\\\\overline{H} = (\\\\Psi_{e^{tG}}(H), 0). Now differentiate this relationship with respect to and evaluate at $: : \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left .e^{t\\\\overline{G}}\\\\overline{H}e^{-t\\\\overline{G}}\\\\right_{t=0} = [\\\\overline{G}, \\\\overline{H}] and : \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left .(\\\\Psi_{e^{tG}}(H), 0)\\\\right_{t=0} = (\\\\psi_G(H), 0) by and thus :[H_1 + G_1,H_2 + G_2]_\\\\mathfrak e = [H_1, H_2]_\\\\mathfrak h + [G_1, H_2] + [H_1, G_2] + [G_1, G_2]_\\\\mathfrak g = [H_1, H_2]_\\\\mathfrak h + \\\\psi_{G_1}(H_2) -\\\\psi_{G_2}(H_1) + [G_1, G_2]_\\\\mathfrak g. =Cohomology= For the present purposes, consideration of a limited portion of the theory Lie algebra cohomology suffices. The definitions are not the most general possible, or even the most common ones, but the objects they refer to are authentic instances of more the general definitions. 2-cocycles The objects of primary interest are the 2-cocycles on , defined as bilinear alternating functions, : \\\\phi:\\\\mathfrak g \\\\times \\\\mathfrak g \\\\rightarrow F, that are alternating, : \\\\phi(G_1, G_2) = -\\\\phi(G_2, G_1), and having a property resembling the Jacobi identity called the Jacobi identity for 2-cycles, : \\\\phi(G_1, [G_2, G_3]) + \\\\phi(G_2, [G_3, G_1]) + \\\\phi(G_3, [G_1, G_2]) = 0. The set of all 2-cocycles on is denoted . 2-cocycles from 1-cochains Some 2-cocycles can be obtained from 1-cochains. A 1-cochain on is simply a linear map, : f:\\\\mathfrak g \\\\rightarrow F The set of all such maps is denoted and, of course (in at least the finite-dimensional case) . Using a 1-cochain , a 2-cocycle may be defined by : \\\\delta f(G_1, G_2) = f([G_1, G_2]). The alternating property is immediate and the Jacobi identity for 2-cocycles is (as usual) shown by writing it out and using the definition and properties of the ingredients (here the Jacobi identity on and the linearity of ). The linear map is called the coboundary operator (here restricted to ). The second cohomology group Denote the image of of by . The quotient : H^2(\\\\mathfrak g, \\\\mathbb F) = Z^2(\\\\mathfrak g, \\\\mathbb F)/B^2(\\\\mathfrak g, \\\\mathbb F) is called the second cohomology group of . Elements of are equivalence classes of 2-cocycles and two 2-cocycles and are called equivalent cocycles if they differ by a 2-coboundary, i.e. if for some . Equivalent 2-cocycles are called cohomologous. The equivalence class of is denoted . These notions generalize in several directions. For this, see the main articles. =Structure constants= Let be a Hamel basis for . Then each has a unique expression as :G = \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha \\\\in A}c_\\\\alpha G_\\\\alpha, \\\\quad c_\\\\alpha \\\\in F, G_\\\\alpha \\\\in B for some indexing set of suitable size. In this expansion, only finitely many are nonzero. In the sequel it is (for simplicity) assumed that the basis is countable, and Latin letters are used for the indices and the indexing set can be taken to be . One immediately has :[G_i, G_j] = {C_{ij}}^k G_k for the basis elements, where the summation symbol has been rationalized away, the summation convention applies. The placement of the indices in the structure constants (up or down) is immaterial. The following theorem is useful: Theorem:There is a basis such that the structure constants are antisymmetric in all indices if and only if the Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple compact Lie algebras and Lie algebras. This is the case if and only if there is a real positive definite metric on satisfying the invariance condition :g_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}{C^\\\\beta}_{\\\\gamma\\\\delta}=-g_{\\\\gamma\\\\beta}{C^\\\\beta}_{\\\\alpha\\\\delta}. in any basis. This last condition is necessary on physical grounds for non- Abelian gauge theories in quantum field theory. Thus one can produce an infinite list of possible gauge theories using the Cartan catalog of simple Lie algebras on their compact form (i.e., , etc. One such gauge theory is the gauge theory of the standard model with Lie algebra . =Killing form= The Killing form is a symmetric bilinear form on defined by :K(G_1, G_2) = \\\\mathrm{trace} (\\\\mathrm{ad}_{G_1}\\\\mathrm{ad}_{G_2}). Here is viewed as a matrix operating on the vector space . The key fact needed is that if is semisimple, then, by Cartan's criterion, is non-degenerate. In such a case may be used to identify and . If , then there is a such that :\\\\langle \\\\lambda, G \\\\rangle = K(G_\\\\lambda, G) \\\\quad \\\\forall G \\\\in \\\\mathfrak g. This is resembling Riesz representation theorem and the proof is virtually the same. The Killing form has the property :K([G_1, G_2], G_3) = K(G_1, [G_2, G_3]), which is referred to as associativity. By defining and expanding the inner brackets in terms of structure constants, one finds that the Killing form satisfies the invariance condition of above. =Loop algebra= A loop group is taken as a group of smooth maps from the unit circle into a Lie group with the group structure defined by the group structure on . The Lie algebra of a loop group is then a vector space of mappings from into the Lie algebra of . Any subalgebra of such a Lie algebra is referred to as a loop algebra. Attention here is focused on polynomial loop algebras of the form :\\\\\\\\{h: S^1 \\\\to \\\\mathfrak gh(\\\\lambda) = \\\\sum \\\\lambda^n G_n, n \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z, \\\\lambda = e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\in S^1, G_n \\\\in \\\\mathfrak g\\\\\\\\}. To see this, consider elements near the identity in for in the loop group, expressed in a basis for : H(\\\\lambda) = e^{h^k(\\\\lambda)G_k} = e_G + h^k(\\\\lambda)G_k + \\\\ldots , where the are real and small and the implicit sum is over the dimension of . Now write : h^k(\\\\lambda) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\theta^k_{-n}\\\\lambda^n to obtain : e^{h^k(\\\\lambda)G_k} = 1_G + \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\theta^k_{-n}\\\\lambda^nG_k + \\\\ldots . Thus the functions : h:S^1 \\\\to \\\\mathfrak g; h(\\\\lambda) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{k=1}^K\\\\theta^k_{-n}\\\\lambda^nG_k \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\lambda^nG_n constitute the Lie algebra. A little thought confirms that these are loops in as goes from to . The operations are the ones defined pointwise by the operations in . This algebra is isomorphic with the algebra :C[\\\\lambda, \\\\lambda^{-1}] \\\\otimes \\\\mathfrak g, where is the algebra of Laurent polynomials, :\\\\sum \\\\lambda^k G_k \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sum \\\\lambda^k \\\\otimes G_k. The Lie bracket is :[P(\\\\lambda) \\\\otimes G_1, Q(\\\\lambda) \\\\otimes G_2] = P(\\\\lambda)Q(\\\\lambda) \\\\otimes [G_1, G_2]. In this latter view the elements can be considered as polynomials with (constant!) coefficients in . In terms of a basis and structure constants, :[\\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_i, \\\\lambda^n \\\\otimes G_j] = {C_{ij}}^k\\\\lambda^{m+n} \\\\otimes G_k. It is also common to have a different notation, :\\\\lambda^m \\\\otimes G_i \\\\cong \\\\lambda^mG_i \\\\leftrightarrow T^m_i(\\\\lambda) \\\\equiv T^m_i, where the omission of should be kept in mind to avoid confusion; the elements really are functions . The Lie bracket is then ^kT^{m+n}_k, cellpadding= 6 border border colour = #0073CF bgcolor=#F9FFF7}} which is recognizable as one of the commutation relations in an untwisted affine Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra, to be introduced later, without the central term. With , a subalgebra isomorphic to is obtained. It generates (as seen by tracing backwards in the definitions) the set of constant maps from into , which is obviously isomorphic with when is onto (which is the case when is compact. If is compact, then a basis for may be chosen such that the are skew-Hermitian. As a consequence, :T_i^{n\\\\dagger} = (\\\\lambda^nG_i)^{\\\\dagger} = -\\\\lambda^{-n}G_i = -T_i^{-n}. Such a representation is called unitary because the representatives :H(\\\\lambda) = e^{\\\\theta_{n}^k T_k^{-n}} \\\\in G are unitary. Here, the minus on the lower index of is conventional, the summation convention applies, and the is (by the definition) buried in the s in the right hand side. =Current algebra (physics)= Current algebras arise in quantum field theories as a consequence of global gauge symmetry. Conserved currents occur in classical field theories whenever the Lagrangian respects a continuous symmetry. This is the content of Noether's theorem. Most (perhaps all) modern quantum field theories can be formulated in terms of classical Lagrangians (prior to quantization), so Noether's theorem applies in the quantum case as well. Upon quantization, the conserved currents are promoted to position dependent operators on Hilbert space. These operators are subject to commutation relations, generally forming an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra. A model illustrating this is presented below. To enhance the flavor of physics, factors of will appear here and there as opposed to in the mathematical conventions.Roughly, the whole Lie algebra is multiplied by , there is an occurring in the definition of the structure constants and the exponent in the exponential map (Lie theory) acquires a factor of (minus) . the main reason for this convention is that physicists like their Lie algebra elements to be Hermitian (as opposed to skew-Hermitian) in order for them to have real eigenvalues and hence be candidates for observables. Consider a column vector of scalar fields . Let the Lagrangian density be :\\\\mathcal L = \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi^\\\\dagger\\\\partial^\\\\mu\\\\phi - m^2\\\\phi^\\\\dagger\\\\phi. This Lagrangian is invariant under the transformationSince and are constant, they may be pulled out of partial derivatives. The and then combine in by unitarity. :\\\\phi \\\\mapsto e^{-i\\\\sum_{a=1}^r\\\\alpha^aF_a}\\\\phi, where are generators of either or a closed subgroup thereof, satisfying :[F_a, F_b] = i{C_{ab}}^cF_c. Noether's theorem asserts the existence of conserved currents, :J_a^\\\\mu = -\\\\pi^\\\\mu iF_a\\\\phi, \\\\quad \\\\pi^{k\\\\mu} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal L}{\\\\partial (\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi_k)}, where is the momentum canonically conjugate to . The reason these currents are said to be conserved is because :\\\\partial_\\\\mu J^\\\\mu_a = 0, and consequently :Q_a(t) = \\\\int J^0_a d^3x = \\\\mathrm{const} \\\\equiv Q_a, the charge associated to the charge density is constant in time.This follows from Gauss law is based on the assumption of a sufficiently rapid fall-off of the fields at infinity. This (so far classical) theory is quantized promoting the fields and their conjugates to operators on Hilbert space and by postulating (bosonic quantization) the commutation relationsThere are alternative routes to quantization, e.g. one postulates the existence of creation and annihilation operators for all particle types with certain exchange symmetries based on which statistics, Bose‚ÄìEinstein or Fermi‚ÄìDirac, the particles obey, in which case the above are derived for scalar bosonic fields using mostly Lorentz invariance and the demand for the unitarity of the S-matrix. In fact, all operators on Hilbert space can be built out of creation and annihilation operators. See e.g. , chapters 2‚Äì5. :\\\\begin{align}{}[\\\\phi_k(t, x), \\\\pi^l(t, x)] &= i\\\\delta(x-y)\\\\delta_k^l, {}[\\\\phi_k(t, x), \\\\phi_l(t, x)]&= [\\\\pi^k(t, x), \\\\pi^l(t, x)] = 0.\\\\end{align} The currents accordingly become operatorsThis step is ambiguous, since the classical fields commute whereas the operators don't. Here it is pretended that this problem doesn't exist. In reality, it is never serious as long as one is consistent. They satisfy, using the above postulated relations, the definitions and integration over space, the commutation relations :\\\\begin{align}{}[J_a^0(t, \\\\mathbf x),J_b^0(t, \\\\mathbf y)] &= i\\\\delta(\\\\mathbf x - \\\\mathbf y){C_{ab}}^cJ_c^0(ct, \\\\mathbf x) {}[Q_a, Q_b] &= i{Q_{ab}}^cQ_c {}[Q_a, J_b^\\\\mu(t, \\\\mathbf x)] &= i{C_{ab}}^cJ_c^\\\\mu(t, \\\\mathbf x),\\\\end{align} where the speed of light and the reduced Planck's constant have been set to unity. The last commutation relation does not follow from the postulated commutation relations (these are fixed only for , not for ), except for For the Lorentz transformation behavior is used to deduce the conclusion. The next commutator to consider is :[J_a^0(t, \\\\mathbf x), J_b^i(t, \\\\mathbf y)] = i{C_{ab}}^cJ_c^i(t, \\\\mathbf x)\\\\delta(\\\\mathbf x - \\\\mathbf y) + S_{ab}^{ij}\\\\partial_j\\\\delta(\\\\mathbf x - \\\\mathbf y) + ... . The presence of the delta functions and their derivatives is explained by the requirement of microcausality that implies that the commutator vanishes when . Thus the commutator must be a distribution supported at . Section 17.5. The first term is fixed due to the requirement that the equation should, when integrated over , reduce to the last equation before it. The following terms are the Schwinger terms. They integrate to zero, but it can be shown quite generally that they must be nonzero. Consider a conserved current with a generic Schwinger term :[J^0(t,\\\\mathbf x),J^i(t,\\\\mathbf y)] = i\\\\delta(\\\\mathbf x - \\\\mathbf y)J^i(t,\\\\mathbf x) + C^i(\\\\mathbf x, \\\\mathbf y). By taking the vacuum expectation value (VEV), :\\\\langle 0C^i(\\\\mathbf x, \\\\mathbf y)0\\\\rangle = \\\\langle 0[J^0(t,\\\\mathbf x),J^i(t,\\\\mathbf y)]0\\\\rangle, one finds :\\\\begin{align}\\\\langle 0\\\\frac{\\\\partial C^i(\\\\mathbf x, \\\\mathbf y)}{\\\\partial_{y^i}}0\\\\rangle &= \\\\langle 0[J^0(t,\\\\mathbf x),\\\\frac{\\\\partial J^i(t,\\\\mathbf y)}{\\\\partial_{y^i}}]0\\\\rangle &= -\\\\langle 0[J^0(t,\\\\mathbf x),\\\\frac{\\\\partial J^0(t,\\\\mathbf y)}{\\\\partial_{t}}]0\\\\rangle = i\\\\langle 0[J^0(t,\\\\mathbf x),[J^0(t,\\\\mathbf y),H 0\\\\rangle &= -i\\\\langle 0J^0(t,\\\\mathbf x)HJ^0(t,\\\\mathbf y)+J^0(t,\\\\mathbf x)HJ^0(t,\\\\mathbf x)0\\\\rangle,\\\\end{align} where and Heisenberg's equation of motion have been used as well as and its conjugate. Multiply this equation by and integrate with respect to and over all space, using integration by parts, and one finds :-i\\\\int\\\\int d\\\\mathbf x d\\\\mathbf y\\\\langle 0C^i(\\\\mathbf x, \\\\mathbf y)0\\\\rangle f(\\\\mathbf x)\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y^i}f(\\\\mathbf x) = 2\\\\langle 0FHF\\\\rangle, \\\\quad F = \\\\int J^0(\\\\mathbf x)f(\\\\mathbf x). Now insert a complete set of states, :\\\\langle 0FHF\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{mn}\\\\langle 0Fm\\\\rangle\\\\langle mHn\\\\rangle\\\\langle nF0\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_{mn}\\\\langle 0Fm\\\\rangle E_n\\\\delta_{mn}\\\\langle nF0\\\\rangle ) \\\\sum_{n e 0}\\\\langle 0Fn\\\\rangle^2E_n > 0 \\\\Rightarrow C^i(\\\\mathbf x, \\\\mathbf y) e 0. Here hermiticity of and the fact that not all matrix elements of between the vacuum state and the states from a complete set can be zero. =Affine Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra= Let be an -dimensional complex simple Lie algebra with a dedicated suitable normalized basis such that the structure constants are antisymmetric in all indices with commutation relations :[G_i,G_j] = {C_{ij}}^kG_k, \\\\quad 1 \\\\le i, j, N. An untwisted affine Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra is obtained by copying the basis for each (regarding the copies as distinct), setting :\\\\overline{\\\\mathfrak g} = FC \\\\oplus FD \\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus_{1 \\\\le i \\\\le \\\\N,m \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z} FG^i_m as a vector space and assigning the commutation relations :\\\\begin{align}{}[G_i^m,G_j^n] &= {C_{ij}}^kG_k^{m+n} + m\\\\delta_{ij}\\\\delta^{m+n,0}C, {}[C,G_i^m] &= 0, \\\\quad 1 \\\\le i, j, N,\\\\quad m,n \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z {}[D, G_i^m] &= mG_i^m {}[D,C] &= 0.\\\\end{align} If , then the subalgebra spanned by the is obviously identical to the polynomial loop algebra of above. =Witt algebra= Ernst Witt (1911‚Äì1991), German mathematician. The Witt algebras, studied by him over finite fields in the 1930s, were first examined in the complex case by Cartan in 1909. The Witt algebra, named after Ernst Witt, is the complexification of the Lie algebra of smooth vector fields on the circle . In coordinates, such vector fields may be written :X = f(\\\\varphi)\\\\frac{d}{d\\\\varphi}, and the Lie bracket is the Lie bracket of vector fields, on simply given by :[X, Y] = \\\\left[f\\\\frac{d}{d\\\\varphi}, g\\\\frac{d}{d\\\\varphi}\\\\right] = \\\\left(f\\\\frac{dg}{d\\\\varphi} - g\\\\frac{df}{d\\\\varphi}\\\\right)\\\\frac{d}{d\\\\varphi}. The algebra is denoted . A basis for is given by the set :\\\\\\\\{d_n, n \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z\\\\\\\\} = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\left .ie^{in\\\\varphi}\\\\frac{d}{d\\\\varphi} = -z^{n+1}\\\\frac{d}{dz}\\\\rightn \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. This basis satisfies ^nd_n = (l-m)\\\\delta_{l+m}^nd_n,\\\\quad l,m,n \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z. cellpadding= 6 border border colour = #0073CF bgcolor=#F9FFF7}} This Lie algebra has a useful central extension, the Virasoro algebra. It has dimensional subalgebras isomorphic with and . For each , the set spans a subalgebra isomorphic to . For one has :[d_0, d_{-1}] = d_{-1}, \\\\quad [d_0, d_{1}] = -d_{1},\\\\quad [d_1, d_{-1}] = 2d_0. These are the commutation relations of with :d_0 \\\\leftrightarrow H = \\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 0 0 & -1\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right), \\\\quad d_{-1} \\\\leftrightarrow X = \\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 1 0 & 0\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right), \\\\quad d_1 \\\\leftrightarrow Y = \\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 0 1 & 0\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right), \\\\quad H, X, Y \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{sl}(2, \\\\mathbb R). The groups and are isomorphic under the map :SU(1,1) = \\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & -i 1 & i\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right)SL(2, \\\\mathbb R)\\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & -i 1 & i\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right)^{-1}, and the same map holds at the level of Lie algebras due to the properties of the exponential map. A basis for is given, see classical group, by :U_0 = \\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 1 1 & 0\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right), \\\\quad U_1 = \\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & -i i & 0\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right), \\\\quad U_2 = \\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} i & 0 0 & -i\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right) Now compute :\\\\begin{align}H_{\\\\mathfrak{su}(1,1)} &= \\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & -i 1 & i\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right)H\\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & -i 1 & i\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right)^{-1} =\\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 1 1 & 0\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right) = U_0, X_{\\\\mathfrak{su}(1,1)} &= \\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & -i 1 & i\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right)X\\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & -i 1 & i\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right)^{-1} =\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} i & -i i & -i\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{2}(U_1+U_2), Y_{\\\\mathfrak{su}(1,1)} &= \\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & -i 1 & i\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right)Y\\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & -i 1 & i\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right)^{-1} =\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} -i & -i i & i\\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{2}(U_1-U_2). \\\\end{align} The map preserves brackets and there are thus Lie algebra isomorphisms between the subalgebra of spanned by with real coefficients, and . The same holds for any subalgebra spanned by , this follows from a simple rescaling of the elements (on either side of the isomorphisms). =Projective representation= If is a matrix Lie group, then elements of its Lie algebra m can be given by :G = \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\left .(g(t))\\\\right_{t=0}, where is a differentiable path in that goes through the identity element at . Commutators of elements of the Lie algebra can be computed using two paths, and the group commutator, :[G_1, G_2] = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left .g_1(t)g_2(t)g_1(t)^{-1}g_2(t)^{-1}\\\\right_{t = 0}, \\\\quad G_1 = g_1'(0), G_2 = g_2'(0). Likewise, given a group representation , its Lie algebra is computed by :\\\\begin{align}[] [U_1, U_2] &= \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left .U(g_1(t))U(g_2(t))U(g_1(t))^{-1}U(g_2(t))^{-1}\\\\right_{t = 0} &= \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left .U(g_1(t)g_2(t)g_1(t)^{-1}g_2(t)^{-1})\\\\right_{t = 0}, \\\\quad G_1 = g_1'(0), G_2 = g_2'(0).\\\\end{align} Then there is a Lie algebra isomorphism between and sending bases to bases, so that is a faithful representation of . If however is a projective representation, i.e. a representation up to a phase factor,then the Lie algebra, as computed from the group representation, is not isomorphic to . In a projective representation the multiplication rule reads :U(g_1)U(g_2) = \\\\omega(g_1, g_2)U(g_1g_2) = e^{i\\\\xi(g_1, g_2)}U(g_1g_2). The function ,often required to be smooth, satisfies :\\\\begin{align}\\\\omega(g,e)&=\\\\omega(e,g) = 1, \\\\omega(g_1, g_2g_3)\\\\omega(g_2,g_3) &= \\\\omega(g_1,g_2)\\\\omega(g_1g_2,g_3) \\\\omega(g,g^{-1})&=\\\\omega(g^{-1},g).\\\\end{align} It is called a 2-cocycle on . One has :\\\\begin{align}[] [U_1, U_2] &= \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left .U(g_1(t))U(g_2(t))U(g_1(t))^{-1}U(g_2(t))^{-1}\\\\right_{t = 0} &= \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left .e^{i\\\\xi(g_1,g_2)\\\\xi(g_1^{-1}, g_2^{-1})\\\\xi(g_1g_2, g_1^{-1}g_2^{-1})}U(g_1(t)g_2(t)g_1(t)^{-1}g_2(t)^{-1})\\\\right_{t = 0} &\\\\equiv \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left .\\\\Omega(g_1,g_2)U(g_1(t)g_2(t)g_1(t)^{-1}g_2(t)^{-1})\\\\right_{t = 0} &= \\\\left .\\\\frac{dU(g_1(t)g_2(t)g_1(t)^{-1}g_2(t)^{-1})}{dt}\\\\right_{t = 0} + \\\\left .\\\\frac{d\\\\Omega(g_1,g_2)}{dt}\\\\right_{t=0}I, \\\\quad G_1 = g_1'(0), G_2 = g_2'(0),\\\\end{align} because both and evaluate to the identity at . For an explanation of the phase factors , see Wigner's theorem. The commutation relations in for a basis, :[G_i,G_j] = {C_{ij}^k}G_k become in :[U_i,U_j] = {C_{ij}^k}U_k + D_{ij}I, so in order for to be closed under the bracket (and hence have a chance of actually being a Lie algebra) a central charge must be included. =Relativistic classical string theory= A classical relativistic string traces out a world sheet in spacetime, just like a point particle traces out a world line. This world sheet can locally be parametrized using two parameters and . Points in spacetime can, in the range of the parametrization, be written . One uses a capital to denote points in spacetime actually being on the world sheet of the string. Thus the string parametrization is given by . The inverse of the parametrization provides a local coordinate system on the world sheet in the sense of manifolds. The equations of motion of a classical relativistic string derived in the Lagrangian formalism from the Nambu‚ÄìGoto action are Equation 6.53 (supported by 6.49, 6.50). :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal P_\\\\mu^\\\\tau}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal P_\\\\mu^\\\\sigma}{\\\\partial \\\\sigma} = 0, \\\\quad \\\\mathcal P_\\\\mu^\\\\tau = -\\\\frac{T_0}{c}\\\\frac{(\\\\dot X \\\\cdot X')X'_\\\\mu - (X')^2\\\\dot X_\\\\mu}{\\\\sqrt{(\\\\dot X \\\\cdot X')^2 - (\\\\dot X)^2(X')^2}},\\\\quad \\\\mathcal P_\\\\mu^\\\\sigma = -\\\\frac{T_0}{c}\\\\frac{(\\\\dot X \\\\cdot X')X'_\\\\mu - (\\\\dot X)^2 X'_\\\\mu}{\\\\sqrt{(\\\\dot X \\\\cdot X')^2 - (\\\\dot X)^2(X')^2}}. A dot over a quantity denotes differentiation with respect to and a prime differentiation with respect to . A dot between quantities denotes the relativistic inner product. These rather formidable equations simplify considerably with a clever choice of parametrization called the light cone gauge. In this gauge, the equations of motion become :\\\\ddot X^\\\\mu - {X^\\\\mu} = 0, the ordinary wave equation. The price to be paid is that the light cone gauge imposes constraints, :\\\\dot X^\\\\mu \\\\cdot {X^\\\\mu}' = 0, \\\\quad (\\\\dot X)^2 + (X')^2 = 0, so that one cannot simply take arbitrary solutions of the wave equation to represent the strings. The strings considered here are open strings, i.e. they don't close up on themselves. This means that the Neumann boundary conditions have to be imposed on the endpoints. With this, the general solution of the wave equation (excluding constraints) is given by : X^\\\\mu(\\\\sigma, \\\\tau) = x_0^\\\\mu + 2\\\\alpha'p_0^\\\\mu\\\\tau - i\\\\sqrt{2\\\\alpha'}\\\\sum_{n=1}\\\\left( a_n^{\\\\mu*}e^{in\\\\tau} - a_n^{\\\\mu}e^{-in\\\\tau}\\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\cos n\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt n}, where is the slope parameter of the string (related to the string tension).

Location  The building stands on the western side of Gda≈Ñska street at the intersection with ≈öwiƒôtoja≈Ñska Street. It stands close to remarkable tenements in the same street: * Tenement at Gdanska street 71; * Tenement at Gdanska street 75; * Ernst Bartsch tenement at N¬∞79; * Paul Storz Tenement at N¬∞81; * Rudolf Kern Tenement. History The house was built in 1911‚Äì1912 for the baker () Otto Riedel, according to a design by the architect Paul Sellner. Paul Sellner has been a student of the architect Karl Bergner. In 1904, he opened his own architectural study office in Bromberg, where he stayed at least until 1922. In Bydgoszcz Paul Sellner also designed, the building at Gdanska Street 95 in 1912‚Äì1913. Otto Riedel moved to ≈öwiƒôtoja≈Ñska Street 2, then Danzigerstrasse 48, in 1891 to establish his bakery. He had the house rebuilt in 1911‚Äì1912 and kept his business running in the new building. The edifice also housed a hardware store, since 1915. Otto Riedel lived there until at least 1933. There is still today a hardware store (\\"Drogeria Aster\\") at this address. Vincent Bigo≈Ñski established here his bakery in 1924. After his death, his son and now his grand-niece are still running the shop at Gda≈Ñska Street. Architecture The house reflects the architectural characteristic of years 1900‚Äì1910, as far as early Modern architecture is concerned. The building block is massive, in that way it balances the symmetry with the opposite building. Both facades have a modest decoration but it is underlined by various components (pilasters, balconies).

The Re_Search Lab continues to support interdisciplinary projects and research involving smell, odor, and fragrance. It establishes communication among experts in different fields dealing with olfaction Her project Sweat Fear  Fear Sweat from 2005 examines the body odors of twenty men, all of whom have a severe phobia of other bodies. Their smells were collected and chemically reproduced. http://mono-kultur.com/issues/23 The simulated sweat molecules were painted onto the gallery walls using a micro-encapsulation process, where they became activated by touch. From her artist's statement about the installation the Fear of smell ‚Äî the smell of Fear at the 2005 Tirana Biennale, Tolaas explains: > \\"In the modern West, we tend to think of smell in purely aesthetic terms, > pleasant or unpleasant. In many other cultures however, smells have provided > and still provide a basic means of defining the and interacting with the > world. This is particularly the case in so far as odours are closely > associated with personal and group identity. The study of the history, > anthropology, and sociology of smells is, in a very real sense, an > investigation into the ‚Äòessence‚Äô of human culture itself.\\" Topics and applications Some of the topics of concern in Tolaas‚Äôs work are: *Can one learn and make systems of smells the way one learn other systems i.e. ABCs and 123s? *Can an abstract smell molecule portray or convey a specific learned meaning by itself? *Can one get rid of prejudices towards certain smells, and how? *How can one describe and remember smells? *Can smells be measured? *How can one make tools to trigger smell memory? *How can one use the information in smells? *How smell can have a better and bigger impact on life and living? *How to better interact with smells and through smells. *Can smell as an information unit be combined with other sensory information in communication systems? *Can smell per se as an information unit be used for the purposes of communication, tolerance and navigation? *Can smell be used to defend, protect, concentrate, attract? *Can smell molecules have a function, i.e. sleep; learn; memory; navigation. Applications for and projects on: *The use of smell per se conveying information purpose i.e. preservation, archiving, researching. *The use of learned smell codes to convey information. *The use of smell to convey information. *The use of smell in education i.e. to aid in memorizing information. *The use of smell to convey information in combination with other sensory information. *The uses of smell to convey information; how this could be applied in language. *The use of smell to train tolerance.

Biography  Billeter was the second of ten children and eldest son of Julius Billeter Sr. (1842‚Äì1922) and Barbara Billeter nee Zweifel (1843‚Äì1930). Barbara Zweifel Billeter had joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) early on. = Immigration to the United States = Some six weeks before her husband joined the church in 1882, 12-year-old Julius immigrated to Utah under the care of returning Mormon missionary Ulrich Stauffer (1838‚Äì1905). Upon arriving in Utah, Billeter lived with the Stauffer family in the town of Willard, where he helped out on the farm. In 1883, he moved to Salt Lake City, where he learned to be a carpenter. Billeter‚Äôs parents and siblings arrived in Utah in 1884. Julius Billeter Jr. and Marie Emilie Wilker (1873‚Äì1951) were married on June 24, 1891 in the Logan Utah temple of the LDS Church. They had become acquainted with each other on the ship upon emigrating from Switzerland. They became the parents of two daughters and three sons. = Return to Switzerland = Less than four weeks after the birth of his first daughter in 1892, Billeter returned to Switzerland and proselyted for two years as a missionary in the Swiss-German Mission of the LDS Church. His wife and infant daughter moved to Paris, Bear Lake County, Idaho, where she lived with Billeter‚Äòs widowed mother-in-law, Maria Emilie Wilker nee Kuenzlin (1842‚Äì1930). In the spring of 1894, Billeter started doing intensive genealogical research in order to take the many lists of names with him upon his return to the United States. His defined goal was to compile genealogies for his fellow believers. The LDS Church builds temples in which worthy members receive sacred ordinances. In order to enable deceased family members to receive such ordinances, it is necessary to genealogically identify the dead which is the reason the Mormons so actively pursue genealogy. = Back in the United States = When Billeter returned to Utah in July 1894, the Salt Lake Temple ‚Äì built in neo-Gothic style according to plans of church architect Truman Osborn Angell (1810‚Äì1887) and dedicated in April 1893 ‚Äì was in full operations. Emily Wilker Billeter, who had worked independently as a seamstress in Paris, Idaho, moved back to Salt Lake City with her daughter and the Billeter family was reunited. In November 1894, the ‚ÄúGenealogical Society of Utah‚Äú was organized by the LDS Church as an impetus to help church members obtain the names of their deceased relatives from records of their native countries. Billeter was among the first to join with a life membership. Billeter considered his membership in the Genealogical Society of Utah as helping him to achieve his goal. His basic suggestion was that genealogy should be pursued as field research in Switzerland and southern Germany. Professor Richard Theodor Haag (1867‚Äì1947) of the Latter-day Saints‚Äò College in Salt Lake City and a native of Stuttgart, Germany, supported Billeter‚Äôs recommendation. Gradually, other church leaders expressed their support and finally, the First Presidency of the church gave their full approval. On January 24, 1896, the ‚ÄúSalt Lake Beobachter,‚Äú a weekly, German-language newspaper published in Salt Lake City at that time, reported: ‚ÄúAccording to the carefully developed plans of these brethren supported by the Authorities ‚Äì a qualified representative will leave in the near future for Germany and Switzerland to help those who are sufficiently interested to make a prepayment of Five Dollars for each record.‚Äú For some two weeks shortly thereafter, Billeter traveled to a number of communities south of the capital city to organize additional commissions. = Second Mission in Switzerland = In April 1896, Billeter departed Salt Lake City to fulfill a second mission in Switzerland and southern Germany. This time, however, his main goal was to conduct genealogical research in order to produce family genealogy records. He found living quarters with another missionary in the city of Burgdorf, but he decided to do his initial research in the Bernese Oberland. From day to day he copied names and dates from old church records and citizens‚Äò registers; whenever possible he remained in a village or town for three or four days. Various place names are mentioned in his letters: Lauterbrunnen, Zweiluetschinen, Luetschental, Burglauenen, Grindelwald, Interlaken and Unterseen, as well as Zweisimmen and Erlenbach im Simmental, along with Rueegsau, Huttwil, Kallnach, Bruettelen, Erlach, Biel, etc. = Back in Utah = Billeter returned to Salt Lake City in May 1897. The ‚ÄúDeseret Evening News‚Äú reported on his success: he had copied more than 100,000 names from old registers for his family genealogy records. His wife returned from Paris, Idaho, a second time, but with two daughters. During Billeter‚Äôs absence, Haag had accepted a position at the ‚ÄúWeber Stake Academy‚Äú in Ogden, Utah, and therefore moved away from the Mormon capital. In order to better coordinate his work with Haag, Billeter moved his family to Ogden, where his wife opened a dressmaking shop on the city‚Äôs main street. During the transitional period of getting settled, the Billeter daughters were with their maternal grandmother in Paris, Idaho. While playing there on a stack of piled logs, the younger daughter ‚Äì not yet two years old ‚Äì fell. She died in December 1898 from what the doctors concluded to be injuries from her lung having been pierced. Billeter worked devotedly on compiling family records. In early 1898, the division of the ‚ÄúSwiss-German Mission‚Äú was announced by church authorities. Hamburg became headquarters of the new ‚ÄúGerman Mission‚Äú and the publication of ‚ÄúDer Stern‚Äú ‚Äì the German-language publication ‚Äì was also transferred to Hamburg. Bern remained as headquarters of the ‚ÄúSwiss Mission.‚Äú In mid-February 1898, the ‚ÄúDeseret Semi-weekly News‚Äú published a statement from the president of the Genealogical Society of Utah ‚Äì LDS apostle Franklin D. Richards (1821-1899) ‚Äì that a tentative agreement had been made with Julius Billeter to go on another genealogy mission to Switzerland and southern Germany. A month later, church officials announced that Haag had been called on a mission to Hamburg as a translator; he left Utah a few weeks later. A few days after his departure, the Billeter family moved back to Salt Lake City from Ogden. = The Third Mission in Switzerland = The local newspaper reported in June that in the fall of 1898 Billeter was planning on returning to German-speaking Europe on a new mission. For unknown reasons, his departure was delayed for several months. It was July 1899 when Billeter bid his family farewell for a third time to go on a mission. ‚ÄúThe Millennial Star,‚Äú the British publication of the church, reported in the August 10 issue, that ‚Äú... Elder Julius Billeter Jr. of Salt Lake City, who is going to the German- speaking countries as an agent of the Genealogical Society of Utah,‚Äú had arrived safely, and would be doing ‚Äú...as much work in this line [of genealogical research] as his other duties will allow.‚Äú Billeter settled in Veltheim near the city of Winterthur. His wife and elder surviving daughter joined him there in late November 1900. At the latest, he began working as a genealogist at the beginning of the 20th century (rather than merely between 1910 and 1950). Around 1903/04, Susanna Klossner Herzog (1834-1906) commissioned Billeter to compile records of her Klossner and Wampfler ancestors from Diemtigen. Shortly after receiving the lists of relatives from those two families, she submitted the first names to the Logan Utah temple for ordinance processing.Ordinance work for those names was completed some years before 1910 ‚Äì i.e., not ‚Äûsince 1910‚Äú ‚Äì in Logan (). Between July 1903 and April 1909, three sons were born to the Billeter family. Immediately prior to being released as a Mormon missionary, Ezra Louie Kunz (1887-1985) noted the following in his diary on 7 June 1909: ‚ÄúI spent the day mostely at Billeters talking over geneology [sic].‚ÄúMission diary of Ezra Louie Kunz, in private possession. His great-grandmother, Rosina Katharina Klossner Kunz (1802‚Äì1883), was a first cousin of Susanna Klossner Herzog. When the Kunz Family Organization was founded on September 5th, 1909, in Bern, Bear Lake County, Idaho, Kunz was appointed as secretary and treasurer of the organization. It was resolved in that first meeting that Billeter be commissioned to compile genealogy records of the Kunz, Knutti and Mani families from Diemtigen. (Minutes of the first meeting of the Kunz Family Organization,‚Äú in private possession. Billeter dated the completed record of those three families in February 1912 (Family History Library, Salt Lake City, microfilm no. 127997). Billeter was very successful in the following years. His work enabled significantly more ordinances to be completed in Mormon temples.One of Billeter‚Äòs sons visited all of the temple presidents, ‚Äú...from Cardston [Canada] on the north to Mesa [Arizona] on the south.‚Äú All of them confirmed that without his father‚Äôs work, ‚Äú...their temples would have had to close on more than one occasion due to lack of names.‚Äú (Billeter, ‚ÄúPioneer Swiss Genealogist‚Äú, 31) = Return to Salt Lake City = Communication, however, became extremely difficult and finally impossible during the war years. With church assistance, the six members of the Billeter family were able to become passengers on one of the first ships to sail from France after the Armistice of Compi√®gne was signed on November 11, 1918, and return to their home in Utah. Not long thereafter, the descendants of numerous earlier Mormon immigrants from Switzerland realized that as a result of Billeter‚Äôs return they were no longer enabled to obtain genealogy records. Numerous people offered Billeter substantial prepayments if he would consider going back to Europe. = Another Mission in Switzerland = In November 1921, Billeter and his wife accepted a church call to go on another ‚Äúgenealogical mission.‚ÄúBilleter, ‚ÄúPioneer Swiss Genealogist‚Äú, 30. The newspaper report ‚Äì ‚ÄúGold Wedding To Be Noted ‚Äì Julius Billeter Couple Will BeFelicitated‚Äú, The Deseret News, Salt Lake City, June 23, 1941 ‚Äì erroneously stated the year to be 1922. They returned to Switzerland and settled in the city of St. Gallen. When the Swiss Society for Genealogical Studies was founded in September 1933, Julius Billeter was one of the founding members. In the first general meeting, Billeter, nearly 64 years of age, encouraged his younger colleagues in their undertaking. The Billeters returned to Salt Lake City in 1945 after World War II. However, Emilie Billeter had difficulty in adjusting to postwar America and became homesick for the Swiss mountains and the ‚ÄúSwiss way of life.‚Äú In 1946, 78-year-old Julius Billeter and his wife went back to Switzerland and he again began doing genealogical research. In September 1951, Emilie Wilker Billeter died in St. Gallen. With the assistance of Rosa Holzer (1897-1979), who worked as his secretary for over 25 years, Julius Billeter continued his genealogy work. A stroke handicapped his capacity to work and he died in July 1957 in St. Gallen. Other Mormon genealogists continued working for their fellow believers in Billeter‚Äôs tradition, including Ernst Arm (1909-1982), Alfred Friedrich Reichen (1897-1985) and Friedrich Julius Wysard (1896-1973). Despite the sympathetic obituary written by Robert Oehler ‚Äì the former Latin teacher and as of 1932 a staff member at the Swiss National Library, who was responsible for the two volume, first edition of ‚ÄúFamiliennamenbuch der Schweiz‚Äú [‚ÄúSwiss Family Surname Book‚Äú] ‚Äì the results of Julius Billeter‚Äôs genealogical research are to be used very cautiously with constructive criticism.

Comfort women She wrote a book titled The Comfort Women: Sexual Violence and Postcolonial Memory in Korea and Japan. In the book, she provocatively disputes the simplistic view that comfort women were victims of a war crime were solely the fault of Imperial Japan. Instead, she argues that both the Japanese military and the Korean patriarchy are at fault. She asserts that because of the patriarchy that dominated Korea at the time, homes were unstable and thus young girls were more likely to leave, a situation which allowed comfort station owners to recruit them into brothels. Additionally, she argues South Korean nationalist politics and the international women's human rights movement have contributed to the incomplete view of the tragedy that still dominates today.

She is generally perceived as the first Arab artist to have done this. Therefore, she is seen as the precursor to the Hurufiyya movement. Also, Umar was the first female to receive a scholarship from the Iraqi government to study in Europe. Today her grandson Dara Kittani manages her Estate Collection. To see more about Madiha Umar go to her official website www.madihaumar.com Life and career Madiha Umar was born in Aleppo, Ottoman Empire, now Syria. Her father was Circassian and her mother was Syrian; mixed parentage was typical in the multicultural Turkish Empire. However, the family moved to Iraqi when she was a young girl. Umar attended the Sultaniyya School in Istanbul, where she drew praise from Ali Riza for her painting skills. She then trained as a teacher at the Maria Grey Training College in London in the 1930s, graduating with First class honours in Arts and Crafts in 1933. She then taught painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Baghdad, becoming head of department before leaving in 1942.Treichl, C., Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture, Kassel University Press, 2017, p.

In 1942 she moved to Washington, to accompany her husband, whose appointment as a member of the Iraqi Commission took him to the capital. In the US, she came across a book on Arabic calligraphy by Islamic scholar, Nabia Abbott and this inspired her to explore the possibilities of incorporating letters into her artwork.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 117 She first began to explore the idea of integrating Arabic letters into painting in the 1940s and in 1949, with the encouragement of art historian, Richard Ettinghausen, she exhibited a series of 22 hurufist- inspired paintings at Georgetown Public Library in Washington. For this, she generally earns the reputation as the first Arab artist of the modern era to have incorporated Arabic letters into her art, and the first artist to have exhibited such works.Treichl, C., Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture, Kassel University Press, 2017, pp. 115-119. Later in the same year, she wrote the book, Arabic Calligraphy: An Element of Inspiration in Abstract Art. In 1952, Umar participated in the Ibn Sina exhibition, held at the Art Institute in Baghdad with 48 paintings, all of which employed Arabic letters in a modern, secular artwork. This event brought her work to the attention of Middle-Eastern artists.

The work, which measures in height by wide, was undertaken in 1880 and depicts Jane Morris posed in a seated position on the bough of a sycamore tree. A small stem of honeysuckle is in her hand, a token of love in the Victorian era, that may be an indication of the secret affair the artist was immersed in with her at the time. The artwork was left to the Victoria and Albert Museum by Constantine Alexander Ionides in 1900. Background During 1878 Rossetti completed a chalk sketch of Morris, his secret lover, whom he had met at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in 1857. She was the model for several of his well-known paintings, including Proserpine. The drawing was displayed above the mantlepiece in Rossetti's studio. Initially the painting was to be called Monna Primavera, or Vanna Primavera, possibly inspired by La Vita Nuova, a narrative that captivated Rossetti and was the basis for earlier pieces of his works of art. Rossetti was also a poet and penned sonnets to accompany several of his paintings; the last composition in his series entitled Sonnets for Pictures is associated with this painting. The sonnet reads: Rossetti had not initially been fully satisfied with the painting and he made several revisions to it. He wrote to Morris apologising for copying the feet of another woman to the picture. An earlier painting of Morris, entitled The Salutation of Beatrice, had similarly used a different model's hands in the final version. Description The chalk sketch that The Day Dream was based on is held by the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. Morris is posed in seated position on the bough of a sycamore tree. A small stem of honeysuckle is in her hand, a token of love in the Victorian era and may be an indication of the secret affair the artist was immersed in with her at the time. Unusually for Rossetti work during this time ‚Äì this is one of his last paintings ‚Äì the model is pictured full length. The painting is signed \\"D. Rossetti 1880\\" on the lower right. The scene is a representation of a young woman in a green silk dress, shaded by the arabesque of the winged sycamore tree's leaves. Above her head and around her the tree branches are depicted almost embracing her, or as if she was emerging from the tree itself, almost as a dryad, or tree nymph. She is portrayed clad all in green, her dress is a romantic wide and loose silk robe, flowing in graceful folds down, blending in with the tree's leaves, that connects the subject and its surroundings visually. She is immersed in her day dreams, turning her gaze downwards, away, towards something unseen or perhaps only perceived by her. The depiction of the young, elegant woman in her shelter surrounded by the branches, is adding to the secretive feeling of the painting, maybe indicating the furtiveness of the affair or a clandestine meeting place. In the shelter it is dark, but around her shoulder there is light, light blue compartments against a dark green background, signalling that it is daytime. Exhibitions and provenance It was left to the Victoria and Albert Museum by Constantine Alexander Ionides in 1900. Ionides had commissioned Rossetti to undertake the work in 1879 for seven hundred guineas. Rossetti and Ionides corresponded throughout the duration of the work being undertaken on the painting; when it was almost completed on 18 March 1880 Rossetti wrote saying: \\"[it] will be beyond question as good a thing as I ever did.\\" He also gave explicit instructions as to where the picture was to be positioned, including details as to the height from the floor and the direction from which the light should hit it.

Women were not permitted to be fighter pilots during the war, but they were allowed to deliver aircraft to replace those lost during either training or combat missions. Kerly had been photographed as a member of the Royal Aero Club in 1938, but although the ATA were desperate for pilots she was the 130th employed in 1943.Helen Kerly, A Fleeting Peace, retrieved 6 March 2015 Kerly's certificate of commendation Kerly was one of only two women to be commended as pilots during the war. Her commendation was given for landing a Spitfire that had technical difficulties on 25 June 1944. She was in the Air Transport Auxiliary and it was her job to deliver aircraft from various factories including the Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory which was one of the main factories for assembling the aircraft.

Career Patrizia Deitos is a former supermodel http://www.intervisteromane.net/Interviste%20pronte%201/patrizia_deitos.htm https://www.inmagazine.it/tag/patrizia-deitos/ from Rimini, Italy, who has walked on some of the most renowned international catwalks. Her campaigns include Krizia, Ferr√©, Missoni, Mila Schon, Raffaella Curiel, La Perla, Parah. Giovanni Cabassi photographed Deitos for Harley-Davidson campaign. She has also appeared in 1996's campaign for Wonderbra. Her entrance into the world of modelling was not only due to her (182 cm) height, but to the lucky coincidence of being at The Embassy club in Rimini, where, at 17, she was invited to participate in the Miss Cinema Contest, which she won. This would have allowed her to take part in the Miss Italia Contest, but, because of her reserved character, she renounced. She was eventually persuaded to participate in the Miss Romagna Contest which she won and which lead her among the contestants for the final of Miss Italia: she achieved third place and won the Miss Smile International Contest. Despite this, Patrizia went on to finish the last two years of high school and obtained her diploma, accepting only photo shoots. For a period she alternated studies and fashion shows, obtaining a degree with honours at the University of Bologna in Medieval History. Her real passion, however, has always been singing, which she began studying at the age of 14. When she was very young, she has been a finalist in the Concorso di Castrocaro and in the Song Academy of Sanremo. Thanks to her contacts in the fashion world she performs mostly abroad, not being interested in the Italian market which she has often declared to be provincial and not based on merit. She has performed with the Demo Morselli Orchestra, The Platters and Gipsy Kings. She has opened some concerts for Dionne Warwick and performed at the Cannes Publicity Festival. She continues to alternate singing and modelling preferring to work abroad. She has been asked to present famous events abroad thanks to her excellent knowledge of English. For some years now Patrizia has returned to jazz, her old passion, collaborating with Simone Giannotti Jazz Septet https://www.lapiazzarimini.it/2019/rimini-musica-patrizia-deitos-col- disco-ho-incontrato-greta-garbo/ https://www.ilrestodelcarlino.it/rimini/spettacoli/patrizia-deitos- garbo-1.5053703/ and performing in a Duo with the same Giannotti.

Gardens (1907-1929) Jay's first commission was a \\"plaisance\\" or pleasure garden in 1907 for the home of her sister Laura Jay Wells in the Round Hill neighborhood of Greenwich, Connecticut. \\"From this modest but well-measured beginning, her portfolio grew to more than 50 articulated projects for private residences all along the East Coast. Her projects varied widely in composition and plant material and demonstrated a comprehensive knowledge of English, French, Dutch, Indian, Italian, Turkish and Japanese design. With great facility, she learned the horticultural and architectural vocabulary of the grand estates of Europe and Asia - pleached allees of trees, plaisances, pergolas, moongates, parterres, rock gardens, pools and teahouses - and adapted these distinctive landscape elements to American gardens and soil conditions.\\" An avid student of the French planner of Versailles, Andre Le Notre, Jay called herself a \\"garden architect.\\" She shared her knowledge freely with others as a lecturer in people's homes and as a contributor to magazines with large circulations such as House Beautiful and House & Garden as well as smaller niche journals such as The Touchstone.Jay, Mary Rutherfurd, \\"The Old Fashion Garden of Adolphe Borie Esq. at Hacklebarney Corners, Chester, N.J., The Touchstone: The Creative Literary Monthly, Mary Fanton Roberts, Inc., New York, Volume 4, 1919. Her plans were created for friends and clients as notable as New York architect, historian and social reformer Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes, author of the monumental series The Iconography of Manhattan Island; the families of financiers William Avery Rockefeller and William Goodsell Rockefeller of Greenwich, Connecticut; Remington Arms President Samuel F. Pryor; and yachtsmen C. Oliver Iselin and Henry R. Mallory.Jay, Mary Rutherfurd, \\"The Garden Handbook,\\" Harper and Brothers Publishers, New York and London, 1931. By 1926, with one of the very few offices leased by women in the Architects Building at 101 Park Avenue in Manhattan (the others being Marian Cruger Coffin and Ruth Dean) Phillips' Business Directory of New York (1926). her private practice had transformed properties as far south as Palm Beach, Florida and as far north as Manchester- by-the-Sea, Massachusetts. Her colleagues included notable architects such as Addison Mizner, J. Alden Twachtman and Francis Keally; she collaborated with peers like Martha Brookes Hutcheson. Philanthropy and volunteer activities (1918‚Äì1919) The Garden Club of America was formed in 1913 and many of its members sought out Jay's expertise as a judge for flower show competitions, an experienced speaker on visiting world gardens and as a personal design consultant for their own estates. As an advocate for women's education on a larger scale, Jay was an early member of the Women's Agricultural and Horticultural Association formed in 1914 to nurture and mentor women interested in pursuing her field as a career; this later became the Woman's National Farm and Garden Association (WNFGA). Jay also served on the board of the nascent Pennsylvania Horticulture School for Women, the precursor of today's Temple University Ambler, volunteering as Field Secretary to interest more people in the school and raise much needed funds.\\"The Fascination of Gardening - Women Who have Taken Up the Science of Flower Culture as a Pleasing Hobby,\\" The Fort Wayne Sentinel, Fort Wayne, Indiana, May 16, 1914. The Jay Estate in Rye, NY today As World War I came to a close, Jay shared and applied all that she had learned about the restorative power of gardens by working with the American Red Cross and the American Committee for Devastated France, a battalion of female volunteers organized by her friend Anne Morgan (1873‚Äì1952), daughter of banker and philanthropist John Pierpont Morgan. Jay's original mission was to supervise an agricultural unit to help residents of villages like Soissons in Aisne recover from the destruction of the Great War, but because of hostile activity in the area she was sent to Versailles instead to work with wounded and shell-shocked soldiers in the Garden Army Service.\\"Women Who Speak French and Who Are Able to Pay Own Expenses Wanted to Help Rebuild Devastated France\\", New York Sun, December 22, 1918. Author, lecturer and genealogist  The majority of Jay's landscape projects were completed between 1907 and the late 1920s. \\"The deaths of her brother John and mother Julia Post in 1928 and 1929 respectively seemed pivotal in changing the focus of her career to more writing.\\" \\"In 1931 she completed The Garden Handbook, a small volume intended for use outside in the smallest to grandest of green spaces; it included descriptions and photos of historic gardens for reference as well as lists of blooming times for various species of flowers, shrubs and trees. Jay was a frequent and very popular speaker to many chapters of the Garden Club of America as well as horticultural societies around the country. She used over 100 luminous lantern slides per program to illustrate the beauty of gardens she had seen in the course of her journeys around the globe. With an evident passion for culture and history, her talks highlighted what had been lost in foreign countries during wartime but also emphasized the resilience of landscapes and the potential for what could be restored through design.\\" During this same period, she recorded the genealogical history of The Jay Family (1935) noting the family's origins in La Rochelle, France and visually illustrating their connections to other early New York families through marriage. Legacy Jay died in New York in 1953. Her collection of slides was donated posthumously to her distant cousin and fellow landscape architect Beatrix Jones Farrand and the Reef Point Library in Maine.McGuire, Diane Kostial (ed.), \\"Beatrix Jones Farrand (1872- 1859): Fifty Years of American Landscape, Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University, Washington, D. C., 1982. The Jay collection was subsequently moved to the Archives of University of California, Berkeley where they are available for study. The family gardens that inspired her to become a landscape architect are now being restored for public use. The site is the centerpiece of the Boston Post Road Historic District and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993. The Jay Estate, including its gardens, is a member of the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area. It was added to New York State's Path Through History in 2013. An exhibit of Jay's work opened at the Jay Estate in 2015 and ran through 2016.

The GE CM20EMPs are multipurpose locomotives, not only for hauling passenger trains (i.e. executive class, business class, or economy class), but also freight trains. The locomotives' operation have started in 2013, and become Indonesian Railway's main workhorses for hauling trains. These locomotives are operated along the Java main line for hauling freight and passenger train, and along South-Sumatra and Lampung Line for hauling freights. They are double-cabin, and the most active double-cabin locomotives in Indonesia.  History  The first double cabin locomotives were the GE CM20EMP's predecessors, such as CC200s (Alco-GE UM 106T), BB301s and BB304s (Krupp M1500BB), and BB305s (built by CFD). While they were once used for express passenger train duty, they are now mostly operated as switchers and haulers of local trains, or have been withdrawn. Between 2000 and 2010 the Indonesian Railways Co. decided to buy more powerful, computerized diesel- electric locomotives such as previously owned CC204s (C20EMP locomotives). But, with the increasing cost of maintenance, parts, fuel and workers, caused by aging and inefficient locomotives, in 2010, the company decided to buy new diesel-electric locomotives to be added to its rolling stock and replace some aging locomotives. But, due to the latest rule from Indonesia Government's Ministry of Transportation, every new locomotive should have no 'long-hood' position, to decrease the number of accidents. This is related to limit sight of the engineer when the locomotives move on long-hood position. By September 2012 the company had bought 100 locomotives of the CM20EMP type and these have been operated since 2013. The locomotives were supplied without bogies and the bogies were assembled by Barata Indonesia. When the ship that carried the locomotives arrived in Tanjung Priok Port, the locomotives were brought to Indonesian Railways Locomotive Workshop in Pengok, Yogyakarta, to be assembled with bogies from barata, and complete their dynamics and statics test. Additional 50 locomotives were ordered in 2014, with the first-39-locos arriving on 14 August 2015, and directly be brought to Pengok, Yogyakarta. After test, 28 locomotives numbered from CC 206 112 (CC 206 15 12) till CC 206 139 (CC 206 15 39) were transferred to Kertapati, South Sumatra by Panjang port, to haul coal trains in south Sumatra. The last-11-locos arrived in Tanjung Priok Port on 14 July 2016. Same as before, the locomotives were brought to Pengok, Yogyakarta, and start the same process as before. after test, the locomotives were transferred to south Sumatra again, to fulfill the lack of locomotives' need for coal trains.  Features  = Body = The CM20EMPs were made when Indonesian Railways Co. needed a double-cab locomotive. The cab and body are similar to the British Rail Class 70 (GE PowerHaul series), but the front windows are like the Indonesian GE U20Cs of class CC203. The headlights and cab doors are like another (unspecified) Indonesian U20C. = Engines, specifications, and electronic devices = These locomotives use a new version of the GE 7FDL-8 engine that meets the same emission standards as the GE Dash 9 Series locomotives. The power output of CM20EMPs is 2,250 horsepower, equal to that of EMD G26, and 100 hp more than the 2,150 hp CC203s/GE U20C. Meanwhile, the tractive effort of these locomotives is as much as 248 kN (starting) and 207 kN (continuous). These locomotives are equipped with GE BrightStar‚Ñ¢ computer systems, integrated with the GE Integrated Function Display‚Ñ¢. The CC206s have different horns from the previous GE locos in Indonesia. While its predecessors use Wabco AA2, the CC206 locomotives use Nathan P3. One unit of CC206 locomotive could haul up to 16 passenger cars or 30 freight cars.  Allocations  Some of CC206s are operated in Java and are allocated to all motive power depots (dipo induk in bahasa) except Madiun and Jember.. CC 206 numbered from 01 (CC 206 15 01) till 11 (CC 206 15 11) are operated in Java, While the rest of CC 206 which arrived in 2015 ( from CC206 15 12 till CC 206 15 39) and which were arrived in 2016 (from CC 206 16 01 till CC 206 16 11) are now operated in South Sumatra, and allocated to motive power depot (dipo induk) Kertapati, Palembang.  Accidents  * On 12 September 2013, a conflagration destroyed a residence settlement, at Malang. As a consequence, the locomotive numbered CC206 13 16 was burnt. The witness said that the fire started in a house, where someone was cooking and spread from there. After that, the fire flamed and licked a Honda Supra motorcycle parked 2 metres from the stove. Then, the fire burnt all of the kitchen. Because the kitchen's distance was just 2 metres from the rail that headed to Pertamina depot, the fire also burnt the CC206 13 16 that was shunting an oil train. The locomotive (CC206 13 16) was heavily damaged on its A-side. All the victims were injured on their feet and faces. * On 4 April 2014, at 18:30 West Indonesian Time, the Malabar train was derailed at Tasikmalaya, West Java due to a landslide. Finally, the two executive class coaches numbered K1 0 67 27 and K1 0 67 22 and the locomotive numbered CC206 13 55 jumped off completely from the rail. Because of heavy mountainous terrain and inaccessible location, the evacuation of CC206 13 55 was obstructed. * On 4 May 2014, the locomotive numbered CC206 13 69 and a power car (P 0 08 01) that hauled Bogowonto train was derailed after crashing into a modified container truck at Cirebon, West Java. There were no fatalities, but the locomotive driver and a number of passengers were injured. The incident caused interruption of timetables, and the evacuation ran with difficulties because of the heavy weight of the CC206.

Normally, PI3K-delta signaling assists B cells and T cells to mature; however, overactive PI3K-delta has an effect on the B and T cell differentiation (the process by which cells eventually are different from one another). Consequently, there is an inability to confront an infection, as well as early cell death. Furthermore, overproduction of said signal can cause lymphadenopathy (which is an enlargement of lymph nodes) due to excess white blood cells. Diagnosis In order to ascertain if an individual has activated PI3K delta syndrome, usually one finds atypical levels of immunoglobulins. Methods to determine the condition are the following: * Genetic testing * Laboratory findings * Symptoms exhibited Treatment Amoxicillin(antibiotic) Infections for this condition, are treated or prevented in the following general ways: * Bacterial infection should be treated rapidly (with antibiotics) * Antiviral therapy * Modify lifestyle (exposure to pathogens need to be minimized) See also * Primary immunodeficiency References Further reading * *  External links  Category:Combined T and B‚Äìcell immunodeficiencies ","title":"Activated PI3K delta syndrome"},{"id":"45603910","text":"Robert Mignat (29 June 1921 - 16 August 2007) was a French racing cyclist.

History The history of Singapore's urban renewal goes back to the time period surrounding the Second World War, when it was still a dependency of England. Before the war, Singapore's housing environment had already been a problem. The tension of both infrastructure and housing conditions were worsened by the rapidly increasing number of the Singapore population in the 1930s. As a consequence of the war and the lack of economic development, between the 1940s to the 1950s, the previous evil of housing conditions continued to happen. As much as 240,000 squatters were placed in the Singapore during the 1950s. It was caused by the movement of migrants, especially from peninsular Malaysia and the baby boom.Dale, O.J., Urban Planning in Singapore: The Transformation of a City. 1999, New York: Oxford University Press. In mid 1959, overcrowded slums were inhabited by a big number of squatter populations, whereas these areas lacked the existence of service facilities such as sanitation.Lim, W.S.W., Cities for People: Reflections of a Southeast Asian Architect. 1990, Singapore: Select Books Pte Ltd. 1960s Since the Singapore government had been in charge, urban renewal included in the part of the national improvement policy that was urgently put in action. Before that, the 1958 master plan had already been designed to solve the city problems. However, due to the lack of urban planning experts caused by the deficiency of professional staff, criticism came from many urban practitioners. The professional team recommended by the United Nations then was asked by the government to cope with the urban renewal matters and its redevelopment plan in 1961. Based on the UN assistance report, two pilot developments were initiated in the end of 1964 by the government. These redevelopments then led to the success of Singapore's urban renewal because the government could provide sufficient amount of public housing and business areas. =Reactions= In the establishment of urban renewal programmes, some difficulties were experienced by the PAP government. The obstacles came from the resistance of people who used to live in the slums and squatters. It was reported by Singapore newspapers that those people were reluctant to be replaced. This became the major problems of 1960s redevelopment schemes.Bishop, R., J. Phillips, and W.-W. Yeo, eds. Beyond Description: Singapore Space Historicity. 2004, Routledge: New York. Affordable land value also became one of its reasons. Another problem was that the government had to purchase the private land owned by the middle and upper society to make the land vacant and be used for redevelopment. The State and City Planning Project =The Central Area= Business and residential districts were planned for the Central Area by the UN Main Project (SCP) and Subproject. The combination of development public accommodation and infrastructure and private development was visualised in the Central Area redevelopment plan. During 1970 to 1995, four major actions were implemented in the Central Area: public housing and service facilities such as stores and marketplaces; the same standards of URA sales programmes with the private developers in constructing the relocation centres and commercial building; the preservation of shopping areas such as Chinatown, Little India and Bussorah Street areas in URA 1988 master plan for conservation; and letting the private sector own the land, especially along Orchard Road. =Orchard Road= There were few changes made to Orchard Road where it was a residential area and then slightly altered by the business area development. In 1949, the McDonald House office was built. In the 1950s, Orchard Road was turned into a central car distribution centre. In addition, the construction of high-rise apartments began in the early 1960s. Ngee Ann City, Emerald Hill, and Cairnhill Mansion were such cases even if these buildings did not succeed in attracting people's attention. Various other alterations followed, such as the emergence of hotel expansion in mid 1960s, and Orchard Road grew to be the most important shopping districts in Singapore by the mid 1980s. However, in the early 1980s, the government occupied the remaining areas to create an efficient city by recovering a wide range of infrastructures such as road improvement, sewer drainage and telecommunications. =Precinct NI= This estate has 32 ha of area covered and 2.4 km from the business district centres of Raffles Place and Singapore River. In 1964, redeveloping started, finishing in 1982, except the sites in the Beach Road and the MRT station in Crawford (Lavender MRT station) reserved for upcoming development. The government demolished the old buildings in the Precincts NI and left only Masjid Hajjah Fatimah as a national monument of historical conservation. It constructed the new Precincts NI, based on the plan. Today, it is known as Kampong Glam.

It was now renamed as the Association for Humanistic Psychology. Key players in this event was James Bugental, the first president of the association, and Gordon Allport, who arranged a grant to help with the founding. In 1964 the association sponsored the \\"First Invitational Conference on Humanistic Psychology\\", also called the \\"Old Saybrook Conference\\", in order to develop the field of humanistic psychology. The conference was held in Connecticut and was visited by academic profiles in the field of humanistic psychology, Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers and Rollo May, who presented papers.Clay, R.A. A renaissance for humanistic psychology. American Psychological Association Monitor, September 2002, Vol 33, No. 8, page 42 The men and women meeting at Old Saybrook in 1964 wanted to change the direction of psychology by introducing a more complete image of the human being than the image presented by Behaviorism or Freudianism. Their purpose was to restore the \\"whole person\\". They also wanted to develop research methods for this purpose. The \\"Association for Humanistic Psychology\\" was the primary forum for the humanistic movement in the USA during the 1960s. In 1970 The New York Times reported from the eight annual meeting of the association, which was held in Miami Beach, Florida. The meeting was dedicated to the late Abraham Maslow, and vas visited by Rollo May, who gave a speech. By this time Floyd Matson had taken over as president of the association.Reinhold, R.

Biography  Born in 1915 in Nuremberg to Jewish parents, Buhrich began her architecture studies in 1933 at a university in Munich. Difficulties with the Nazi regime forced her relocation to Berlin, where she continued to study under modernist expressionist architect Hans Poelzig, and then to Zurich, where she completed her diploma in 1937 at the technical university, under Otto Salvisberg. Although she had been awarded a postgraduate scholarship to carry out research into schools, the impending threat of World War II resulted in Buhrich emigrating to Australia in 1939 with her husband, Hugh Buhrich, whom she had met in Munich while they were both architecture students and married in 1938. Despite having studied at esteemed European universities, Buhrich's qualifications were not recognised in Australia. Professor Alfred Hook of the University of Sydney helped both Buhrich and her husband to secure work at an architecture practice run by Heather Sutherland and Malcom Moir in Canberra. In 1940, not long before the family moved to Sydney, Eva Buhrich gave birth to twins Neil and Clive. This was a period when many women encountered both subtle and direct forms of discrimination in the workforce, such as lower wages. After periods working as an architect for the Commonwealth Experimental Building Station and in partnership with her husband, Eva Buhrich had established herself as a writer and editor by the 1950s. Between the 1940s and 1950s, her writing appeared in The Australian Women's Weekly, Woman, Walkabout and House and Garden, among other publications, at times under assumed (male) names. Notably, Buhrich penned a column in the Sydney Morning Herald from 1957 through to the late 1960s and published the book Patios and Outdoor Living Areas in 1973. With her husband, Buhrich played a key role in advocating for preventing the demolition of the Walter Burley Griffin-designed Willoughby Incinerator in 1975. Meetings to establish the Walter Burley Griffin Trust (NSW) took place at their home. Buhrich was the face of the campaign, which succeeded in mobilising support and ultimately saved the incinerator. Eva Buhrich died in March 1976 after suffering from cancer.

The construction of arpilleras became popular in Chile during the military dictatorship (1973‚Äì90) of Augusto Pinochet. Arpilleras were made in workshops organized by a committee of the Chilean Catholic Church and then secretly distributed abroad through the church's human rights group, the Vicariate of Solidarity. The production of arpilleras provided a vital source of income for the arpilleristas, many of whom had been left in a state of financial insecurity due to widespread unemployment and forced disappearances of their husbands and children, who became known as desaparecidos. Arpilleras are typically constructed from simple materials such as burlap and scraps of cloth. Arpilleras usually depicted expressly political themes through the demonstration scenes of impoverished living conditions and government repression. These scenes served to denounce the human rights violations of the Pinochet regime. In response, the Chilean government sought to punish those who created arpilleras and those who supported the creation of arpilleras. Arpilleras are currently recognized as an example of subversive women's art in an authoritarian political context. However, contemporary arpilleras reflect less political themes, such as idealized rural life. Historical background = Pinochet regime = In September 1973, following months of political tensions and social unrest in Chile, the democratically elected socialist government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in a US-backed coup d'etat. The coup d'etat was carried out by the Chilean military forces under Augusto Pinochet in response to Allende's leftist reforms and the perceived threat of communism. From its first days in power, the Pinochet regime was characterized by widespread human rights violations. In the period immediately following the coup, the junta declared a state of emergency and engaged in arbitrary arrests and abolished all political parties and unions, with tens of thousands of people facing torture, interrogation, and execution in the following years. There is some debate about exactly how many people were killed or \\"disappeared\\" into the regime's prisons, torture chambers and unmarked graves for suspected political reasons over Pinochet's 16 years in power. In 1991 the National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation Report found that the Pinochet Regime killed over 2000 people, and the 2005 Valech Report which focused on detentions reported that 38,254 people had been imprisoned for political reasons and that most of those detained had been tortured. Additionally, the rapid shift from Allende's socialist policies to Pinochet's neoliberal reforms entailed a \\"shock treatment\\" on the Chilean economy, which saw a rapid decline in social spending and substantial layoffs in the civil service, resulting in an 18.7 percent unemployment rate by 1975. As a result, Chileans became further impoverished and suffered from food shortages. Additionally, Chileans with little or no income could not pay for utilities previously granted by the government, such as water and electricity. These utilities were transformed by the government into sources of profit to fund the military. In regards to the Pinochet regime's treatment of Chilean women, restrictive doctrines more oppressively promoted the Allende regime's perspective that women should maintain silent and politically inactive roles as wives and mothers.  Impact on women  Especially affected by the implementation of neoliberal policies were women from poor and working-class households. Many of these women were left without a source of income due to widespread unemployment and political disappearances. Therefore, these women were forced to seek work outside the home for the first time. Additionally, Pinochet's ascent to power affected opportunities for women's organization and visibility in politics, both among supporters and opponents of the regime. Upper-class women, especially those with ties to the military, were upheld by the government as examples of moral virtue and were incorporated into efforts to praise female domesticity and the patriarchal family model through participation in pro-government organizations such as the Centros de Madres and the Secretar√≠a Nacional de Mujeres. Conversely, numerous groups with substantial women's participation emerged both out of opposition to the Pinochet government's repressive tactics and the need for economic subsistence. These groups included explicitly political groups that advocated for human rights and justice for the desaparecidos, mutual aid organizations that provided meals and taught practical skills, and communal workshops organized by the Catholic Church designed to provide employment opportunities.  Origins of the arpillera workshops  = Isla Negra = Before, arpillera workshops became more popular during Pinochet's regime, the philanthropist Sra. Leonora Soberino de Vera created a workshop in the rural area of Isla Negra. The women who worked in this workshop struggled with issues of poverty, unemployment, and alcoholism. The arpilleras in this workshop, which were inspired by folklore and arpilleristas' memories, portrayed themes on the joys of life and the desire to live a pastoral life. The women gained customers from a global market through the support of the government and museums. However, a great increase in demand for these arpilleras, which occurred through the support of Pablo Neruda and Violetta Parra, burdened the women as well. Regardless, through the continued support of Sra. Leonora, the women continued to gather at the workshops to create arpilleras. = Santiago = Shortly after the 1973 coup d'etat, various Catholic Church groups, inspired by liberation theology, began to organize in opposition to the military regime. One such group, which also helped develop the first arpillera workshops in Santiago, was the Committee of Cooperation for Peace in Chile (). When the first arpillera workshops were developed in Santiago, the arpilleristas in these workshops gained inspiration from the work developed in the Isla Negra workshops. However, the Isla Negra women's wool embroidery methods were viewed as too expensive and time-consuming, so the Santiago women developed their own methods. Regardless, in 1975, this church was forced to dissolve. The Vicariate of Solidarity was set up under the auspices of the Chilean Catholic Church, and took up the struggle for human rights in Chile where the Committee of Cooperation left off. It was a vocal opponent of the military regime and a voice for human rights, and worked to provide assistance to Chilean citizens in the form of legal aid, health care, food, and employment. In March 1974, under the leadership of Valentina Bonne, a church official, the first arpillera workshops held by the Vicariate of Solidarity were established to provide unemployed women with a modest income, create a community for emotional support, and draw international attention to the repressive political situation through the sale of denunciatory artwork. The Vicariate also provided supplies for women to craft arpilleras. Women would meet in discreet locations such as church basements in order to evade government detection. Although arpilleras were mainly crafted in workshops, there are some instances where arpilleras were made from prison as well. An estimated 14 women, many of whom hailed from the shantytowns of Santiago, participated in the initial workshops. There were ten workshops in Santiago by 1975. At the height of the arpillera movement, approximately 200 workshops were held in Santiago, each with roughly 20 participants and three meetings per week. At these workshops, women would gather together and stitch arpilleras in exchange for funds. Also, when the arpilleristas gathered, they would talk about the use of proper skill, design, and themes for arpilleras to ensure proper management of the quality and quantity of arpilleras produced. At the end of each gathering, a treasurer would collect the arpilleras for sale overseas to human rights organizations, NGOs, and groups of Chilean exiles. Usually, unless an arpillerista was undergoing dire economic struggle, she was only allowed to make and offer one arpillera per week. In cases of urgent economic need, women were allowed to make and offer two arpilleras per week. If a committee of six arpilleristas from the workshop determined that any of the group's arpilleras met quality requirements, the approved arpilleras were collected and sold once a month for $15 each after being brought to the Vicariate. During the dictatorship, arpilleras gained international attention through their distribution by the Catholic Church and organizations such as Amnesty International and Oxfam UK. The primary purchasers of arpilleras were North American and European human-rights activists who wished to express their solidarity with victims of the regime, as well as Chilean exiles living abroad who hoped to raise international opposition to poverty and political repression in Chile. After receiving compensation for her arpilleras, each woman would contribute 10% of her payment to a collective fund to ensure the workshop's survival.  Form and thematic content  =Form= Rules on the amount of figures permitted in an arpillera and the required sizes, composition, proportion, colors, and themes were decided by the Committee and afterward by the Vicariate. Arpilleras were intended to be formally simple and accessible to everyday women with no artistic training. Given the scant resources of the Vicariate of Solidarity and the individual workshop participants, arpilleras were made from the cheapest available materials. Materials used to make arpilleras included flour sacks or wheat sacks typically made of jute, flax, or hemp fibers, scraps of cloth, used thread, and discarded objects. Most arpilleras were constructed from thick hessian canvasses, with colorful pieces of fabric stitched and embroidered together in appliqu√© style to form flat images of people, buildings, city streets, and landscapes. Many also included three-dimensional elements, such as small dolls stitched atop the fabric. These dolls are meant to represent the unique qualities of the individuals they are inspired by. Arpilleristas also included more three-dimensional elements by using pieces of tin to serve as pots and pans, matchsticks and broom handles, and parts of plastic pill casings as bowls. Also, arpilleristas sometimes chose to elaborate on the meaning of their arpillera by placing a paper written description into a small pocket sewn onto the back of the arpillera. Generally, these descriptions expressed desires for solidarity and detailed the infringement of human rights in Chlie. The paper sometimes also included the arpillerista's name, but arpilleristas usually did not write their names to remain safe. There are currently three different types of styles used to create an arpillera: # The Flat of Planar Method: Embroidery stitches from the surrounding area of the arpillera are used to fasten fabric materials to the surface. # The Raised or Relief Method: Dolls and objects in the arpillera are slightly lifted from the surface through embroidery stitches. # The Glue Method: Contrasting wool that has been glued is used to border the fabric materials that have been glued to the surface. When an arpillera is finished, it is framed by a wool crocheted border and varies in size from 9\\" x 12\\" to 12\\" x 18\\" inches. = Thematic content = Although arpilleras sometimes depicted scenes of joyful memories, they mostly demonstrated scenes of oppression. Because workshop attendants encouraged discussion about political repression and economic injustice, and at times explicitly stated their goal of generating sufficient international outrage to necessitate a return to democratic rule, the arpilleristas often depicted expressly political themes that may have been chosen by the group. Sometimes, murals were formed by sewing arpilleras together with common themes. Arpilleras were often characterized by the tension between the vibrant, colorful imagery created by the woven pieces of fabric and their serious imagery and somber political messages. For example, colorful scraps of material were usually cut into triangular pieces and placed along the horizon of an arpillera to represent the wealth and beauty of Chile through various regions and seasons. However, somber messages of injustice in living conditions, lifestyle, or economic opportunities and messages depicting a change in a situation were portrayed through a separating figure, such as a building, street, river, or fence. Therefore, in addition to everyday scenes of Santiago's shantytowns and the Andean landscape, the arpilleras often referenced human rights violations and state violence, poverty, and the lack of women's political rights. For example, some arpilleras portrayed bones, body bags, and individuals being interrogated by the military police. Also, some arpilleras would depict scenes of village children eating from large soup pots in communal kitchens or individuals attempting to obtain food by waiting in a line. Other arpilleras also showed women outside the prisons where their friends and family were imprisoned and depict these women chaining themselves to the prison fence. Arpilleras also commonly bore the faces of the arpilleristas' disappeared family members. Marjorie Agos√≠n, a Chilean-American writer and arpilleras scholar, has compared the visual language with which the arpilleristas demanded justice for the desaparecidos with that of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo in Argentina, who wore photographs of their disappeared children during the Dirty War. Many arpilleras also included text stitched into the fabric, with short political messages that demanded to know the fate of the desaparecidos and decried the lack of women's political and economic rights. Sociologist Jacqueline Adams has noted that in the early 1980s, the Catholic Church grew less vocally critical of the Pinochet regime and dismissed the Vicariate's more radical staff members, which she contends led to a shift in the content of the arpilleras. She argues that the arpilleristas grew less denunciatory in their work and shifted focus from political themes to tranquil images of everyday life, knowing that the Vicariate would reject any work deemed too subversive. Regardless, the images in these arpilleras, such as of individuals diverting power lines to obtain electricity and individuals obtaining water from a pump, still demonstrate the effects of political and economic oppression. Impact = Women = While an estimated 80 percent of the arpilleristas came from poor or working-class households, the remaining 20 percent came from upper-middle-class households. The upper-middle-class women were primarily motivated by the disappearances of family members and the desire to show solidarity with the victims of political violence. While some of the participants arrived at the workshops with preexisting political inclinations, a number having been supporters of Salvador Allende, the majority had been previously uninvolved in politics and subsequently developed leftist and pro-democracy leanings through the political atmosphere fostered by the workshops and conversation about the shared experience of having lost family members to the regime. As women continued to engage in conversations about the regime, they learned more about the systems of power that control Chile. As a result, women would learn more about their rights by going to lectures and would then protest through hunger strikes, marches, and other means. Regarding domestic matters, the funds that women earned from selling arpilleras allowed women to increase their families' educational opportunities, health, and well-being. However, the work women performed in arpillera workshops contradicted the societal notion that women were only supposed to be involved in domestic affairs. As a result, women suffered verbal and physical abuse from their husbands. However, there were some cases were arpillera crafting was performed by women's children and husbands to allow women more leisure time. = Government response = The Pinochet government maintained widespread censorship policies over artistic expression. During the early days of the workshops, Chilean police forces confiscated numerous arpilleras, while members of the military denounced them as defamatory 'tapestries of infamy' after discovering a parcel of arpilleras en route to Europe at Santiago's airport. Due to the threat of censorship and government repression, most arpilleras were made anonymously, representing a collective voice of female suffering. Women sought to prevent themselves from being caught by the military police by crafting arpilleras under candlelight behind thickly draped windows. Also, in case the police ever searched their homes, women attempted to avoid arrest or punishment by hiding arpilleras in the lining of their bedspreads. Additionally, when women brought their arpilleras to the Vicariate, they sought to avoid being caught by hiding the arpilleras in their coats and skirts. Arpilleras faced censorship for the portrayal of subversive themes and were thus rarely sold locally or displayed in domestic galleries. They were eventually outlawed entirely, though the workshops continued through the end of Pinochet's rule. Eventually, the government decided to manufacture its own arpilleras because the current arpillera workshops would not cease production and international demand was difficult to meet for current arpilleristas. Scenes of the Chilean flag, historical sites, and nature were all crafted into government-sponsored arpilleras by individual artists. The government claimed these arpilleras were \\"official\\" and also used these arpilleras to create posters. = Legacy = Since the transition to democracy, arpilleras have been shown internationally in the United States and throughout Europe. Capital cities around the world, such as Washington D.C., and Chilean government-sponsored curio shops also currently possess arpilleras manufactured by Pinochet's regime. The arpillera movement has been lauded for its visual representation of life under the Pinochet regime and its subversive treatment of human rights and gender issues, having been displayed in the Victoria and Albert Museum's 2014 Disobedient Objects exhibit. Also, about 500 arpilleras were repatriated to Chile to create an exhibit in The Museum of Memory and Human Rights. Chilean novelist Isabel Allende has remarked of the arpilleras, \\"With leftovers of fabric and simple stitches, the women embroidered what could not be told in words, and thus the arpilleras became powerful forms of political resistance... the arpilleras flourished in the midst of a silent nation, and from the inner patios of churches and poor neighborhoods, stories made of cloth and yarn narrated what was forbidden.\\" While the formal workshops ceased in 1989 with the reestablishment of Chilean democracy, the tradition continued through the work of independent arpilleristas. Modern arpilleras mostly depict an idealized version of Chilean rural life. These modern arpilleras are also produced by machines and sold as wall hangings, cards, coin purses, table runners, bibs, and other types of souvenirs in street markets and tourist shops like the Chile Crafts Foundation (Fundaci√≥n Artesan√≠a de Chile). The foundation established stores in downtown Santiago and the airport to expose tourists to Chilean culture and to provide arpilleristas with the opportunity to sell their work for income. Nonetheless, modern arpilleras have also received criticism because they are believed to depict a generic portrayal of Chile and disregard the political history of arpilleras. However, arpilleras in Chile in 2011 did express political themes that condemned the treatment of the indigenous Mapuche people by the Chilean government. Arpilleras have also inspired stylistically and thematically similar works of art in other countries that have faced state violence, such as Colombia, Peru, Zimbabwe, and Northern Ireland.

History The dynasty traces its main line back to one knight Godofridus de Bulowe, mentioned in a 1229 deed. He was named after the village of B√ºlow near K√∂nigsfeld, then part of the Bishopric of Ratzeburg. The family made great donations to nearby Rehna Abbey. As B√ºlow was also a word for oriole in the local dialect based on Wendish roots, the bird is depicted as a crest in the family's coat of arms. In Mecklenburg the family acquired around 110 estates, castles or villages from 1229 onwards, nine of which remained in its possession until the confiscations in communist East Germany in 1945. From 1470 to this day the family holds the manor of Gudow in Saxe-Lauenburg (today part of the former West-German state of Schleswig-Holstein), and in the 19th century it acquired three more estates nearby, also still owned by family members. In the 14th century, four members officiated as Bishops of Schwerin; one Dietrich von B√ºlow was Bishop of Lebus from 1490 onwards. Numerous female members joined the convent of Dobbertin Abbey. In 1383 the Mecklenburg knight Heinrich von B√ºlow burnt down the village and church of Wilsnack, whereafter the rebuilt Church of the Holy Blood of Wilsnack became the destination of medieval religious pilgrimages.

Biography Vice Governor Jos√© Neder, President Cristina Kirchner, Governor Claudia Ledesma Abdala, and her husband and predecessor Gerardo Zamora shortly after Ledesma's election in 2013. Ledesma was born in La Banda. Her father, Oscar Ledesma, was active in local politics as a supporter of Governor Carlos Ju√°rez. She graduated as a lawyer and notary from the Catholic University of Santiago del Estero. Ledesma entered public service in 2003 when she was elected Citizen Ombudsman for La Banda on the UCR ticket, and in 2005 she was appointed local infractions judge. Ledesma and her first husband, Jorge Amerio, were divorced, and in 2005 she met her future husband, Governor Gerardo Zamora. She was later appointed by her husband as Director of the Provincial Motor Vehicle Registry. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Governor Zamora nominated his wife for the governor's race held in 2013, while he himself ran for Senator. Both won their respective races on the Civic Front for Santiago ticket, and Ledesma was elected governor with nearly 65% of the vote. Zamora had presided over an ambitious public works agenda in historically underdeveloped Santiago del Estero, 90% of whose US$1.8 billion budget was financed by the federal government in 2013. Ledesma continued this policy and initiated or inaugurated numerous significant projects as governor. These included among others a new building for the Provincial Legislature; the Juan Felipe Ibarra provincial office building (the first LEED certified government building in Argentina); increases in the educational budget for 1,100 new teachers and 10,000 new desks; and improvements in sewer systems and other public services. Some of the most notable health and social care improvements during her tenure include expansion works in 14 hospitals and a new, 150,000 ft¬≤ hospital in La Banda; a driver safety education and enforcement program that led to a 40% reduction in motor vehicle accidents; a new child nutrition program that provides probiotic yogurt to over 47,000 poor children; and housing programs that included public housing, as well as the promotion of both cooperative housing and of self-building programs that financed over 3,000 such homes in 2015.

It was re-started in 1819, and decided in 1820 to build a building. This was designed probably by North Carolina's state architect William Nichols. It came to serve as the town's lecture hall, opera house, Civil War hospital, and other functions. It was also known as the King Street Opera House. It was deemed architecturally significant \\"as an interesting example of the adaptive usage of early Greek Revival motifs in a building constructed specifically as a Masonic lodge.\\" It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. It is located in the Hillsborough Historic District.

Two single-span dual lane Lattice Truss covered bridges were located at the site, one of which replaced the other. Salmon Lusk constructed the first bridge in 1840, and after its destruction by flood in 1847, Lusk constructed the second. Both bridges were located on private land; the only other such covered bridges in Parke County were the State Sanitorium Covered Bridge, the JH Russell Covered Bridge, and the Clinton Toll Bridge. First bridge Vermont native, Captain Salmon Lusk, had been part of General William Henry Harrison's expedition in 1811. Being sent out to scout a Route to Prophet's Town he traveled up the east side of the Wabash River to the mouth of Sugar Creek, which he followed to the Narrows. Eleven years later, his military service complete, he moved to this area with his wife Polly Beard Lusk. In 1825 he would use the one thousand acre grant that he had received for his military service to claim the land around the Narrows. In 1826 Lusk built a grist mill at the Narrows, where a small community would soon pop up. By 1840 a sturdy bridge was needed to cross Sugar Creek. At least two open bridges had already been built in the area. Records show that Salmon Lusk probably built a two lane covered bridge just upstream from the current bridge. The materials for the bridge would have probably came from his land. On New Years Day, 1847, the Lusk Bridge, Lusk Mill, Prior Wright's Store and other buildings associated with these were washed away by a freshet on Sugar Creek. Second bridge With the destruction of his first covered bridge at this spot on New Year's Day, 1847, Salmon Lusk would go on to rebuild the bridge that same year. This would be the fourth bridge built at this spot. The mill would not be rebuilt though and Prior Wright moved his business to Rockport, future site of the Jackson Covered Bridge. Record for Parke County show that William Blacklege was hired to conduct repairs on the bridge in 1866 for $800. These were the same flooding waters that also damaged the Harrison Covered Bridge. Little is known of its destruction; the only surviving details are the year (1875) and the time elapsed before its replacement. No bridge spanned Sugar Creek at the site until the Narrows Covered Bridge was built in 1882.

The palace is adjacent to the taller Palazzo Marsili with a crenellated roofline and mullioned second and third story windows, and which stands at the corner of Via di Citt√† and Via del Castoro. History The palace was made of brick in Gothic style in the mid-15th century, when other palaces were already beginning to show the influence of Florentine Renaissance as evidenced, for example, in Siena by the Palazzo Piccolomini. The origins of the Piccolomini family were linked this house as is evidenced by the coat of arms of Pope Pius II placed over the central entry portal, sculpted by Urbano da Cortona. The coat of arms has two cherubs lofting a papal tiara above a shield held by struggling angels. The shield has five crescents on a cross (argent on a cross azure 5 crescents or). The palace was owned after the Piccolomini by the Libelli (also known as Loli) family, then in 1730 by the Marsili Family. The pointed arches at street level with internal rounding are characteristic of Sienese Gothic. It is likely the windows in the higher floors were at one time not rectangular. The interior has a loggia-courtyard with columns. The second floor has a small chapel with a 17th-century altar with a painting attributed to Dionisio Montorselli.

Sentenced to life imprisonment, Yanikian was released on parole in January 1984. It is widely believed that Yanikian's act was the inspiration for the founding of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia, the Armenian militant organization of the 1970s and 1980s which staged attacks on Turkish diplomats in retaliation for the Armenian Genocide. Biography =Early life= Yanikian was born in Erzurum in 1895, at the height of the anti-Armenian massacres that had taken hold of the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire. His family was able to flee to a safer location, but when they returned to Erzurum eight years later to retrieve personal possessions they had hidden in a barn, his elder brother Hagop was killed by two Turkish men.Bobelian, Michael. Children of Armenia: A Forgotten Genocide and the Century-long Struggle for Justice. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2009, pp. 3-4. Yanikian was studying to be an engineer at the University of Moscow when World War I broke out. After learning of the Turkish persecution of Armenians during the genocide of 1915-23, he traveled to the Caucasus in the spring of 1915 and joined a volunteer regiment of the Russian Army to find out the fate of his family members, whom he had not heard from since the outbreak of the war and who were living in the Ottoman Empire. He was assigned to an engineering unit that was tasked with mapping out the geography of the terrain ahead of the regular troops. As the Russian army advanced, Yanikian witnessed first hand the destruction wrought against the Armenians. Upon his arrival in Erzurum, he found his father's business in ruins and recognized the bodies of two of his relatives. In the course of the genocide he lost twenty-six members of his extended family.Bobelian. Children of Armenia, pp. 4-6.. =Later life= Yanikian went on to complete his education in Russia and in 1930 moved to Iran together with his wife Suzanna. They settled in Tehran where Suzanna opened a gynecological clinic while Yanikian set up a civil engineering company called RAHSAZ.Kalaydjian, Tigran. Sentinel of Truth: Gourgen Yanikian and the Struggle Against the Denial of the Armenian Genocide. SBPRA (2012). p. 25. Amongst other construction projects, he oversaw the building of a railroad across Iran during the Second World War, as part of Allied efforts there, and became quite affluent.. He emigrated to the United States in 1946, via France. He and his wife arrived in New York and moved to Beverly Hills where he opened the Yanikian Theater. The theater did not do well. The couple moved to Fresno, CA, where there was a large Armenian community. He claims he was a radio host in Fresno. After some years, he and his wife moved to Santa Barbara, CA. He began developing properties, using his substantial savings. Things did not go well however, and he lost most of his money in the project. All the while, he had been writing and publishing several novels including , Harem Cross (1953) and The Voice of an American (1960). By the late 1960s, Yanikian had lost most of his money, was living on welfare and his wife was in a care home with dementia unable to recognize him, even though he visited nearly every day and brought her chocolates. Her medical care became a factor in his insolvency and his dependency. A final straw came for him late in 1972 when the U.S. State Department wrote him a letter that he should make no more attempts to communicate with their office. Yanikian had been attempting to collect money owed him from Iran for projects he had done during World War II. Yanikian had exhausted every legal channel and hoped the State Department could evoke pressure for payment Trial Transcripts Yanikian's testimony of $1.5 million he claimed he was owed for the construction work he had overseen there. As a matter of fact, in 1944 the Iranian court issued an award in favor of Yanikian against Iran's Ministry of Roads, which stipulated that the Ministry was to compensate Yanikian for the implemented construction works by 26 November 1944, but the Ministry failed to pay the award until 15 August 1948, and Yanikian sought to recover the damages for the delay in payment. The Iranian government stated that Yanikian was paid in full, and the Iran‚ÄìUnited States Claims Tribunal dismissed in 1985 the claims of Yanikian's attorneys citing the lack of jurisdiction over items of the claim.J. C. Adlam, M. E. MacGlashan. Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal Reports, Volume 8. Cambridge University Press, 1987. , 9780521464420, pp 290-297 His despondency about the general state of his life has been thought to be a major factor in his act of planning and killing the Consul General and the Vice Consul General.Trial Transcripts Yanikian testimonyLetters of Psychiatric Evaluations of YanikianBobelian. Children of Armenia, pp. 141-44. Memories of the genocide lingered in his mind and visions of his dead brother haunted him for years. The Republic of Turkey's continual denial of the genocide remained a source of anguish and pain. Eventually, Yanikian, believing he had little left to live for, resolved to avenge the deaths of his family members and bring greater awareness to the genocide by organizing the assassination of the perpetrator country's agents, an act that took its cue from the example set by Soghomon Tehlirian fifty years earlier.Bobelian. Children of Armenia, pp. 143-45. =Assassination of Turkish consuls= On January 27, 1973, the 77-year-old Yanikian lured the Turkish consul general Mehmet Baydar, 47, and vice-consul Bahadƒ±r Demir, 30, to a cottage at the Biltmore Hotel in Santa Barbara, promising to make a gift to Turkey of a bank note and a painting stolen from the Ottoman sultan's palace more than a century earlier.\\"UPI. Author Yanikian Refuses To Plea.\\" Beaver County Times. Feb. 27, 1973. Yanikian had contacted the consul general three months before, and insisted that the consul general personally accept the painting, and since Baydar did not drive, Demir was asked to accompany him to provide transportation.\\"Return of Painting Used as Lure in Consuls' Slayings, Police Say.\\" Los Angeles Times. January 29, 1973. Baydar, married and the father of two daughters, was a career diplomat who had previously served in Paris and Washington. Demir was on his first foreign assignment. That neither man was alive during the genocide \\"mattered little to Yanikian,\\" according to journalist Michael Bobelian: \\"Just as Ottoman dehumanization of the Armenians a half century earlier opened the door for so many ordinary citizens to participate in the Genocide, Yanikian came to view the men not as human beings, but as symbols of decades of injustice.\\"Bobelian. Children of Armenia, p. 146. Yanikian handed them the bank note, for which he was given a receipt, and the three men began to converse over lunch.Bobelian. Children of Armenia, p. 147. During this time, Yanikian revealed to them that he was not Iranian, as he had told the consulate when he first contacted them, but Armenian. Baydar dropped the bank note in anger and a heated exchange took place. At this point, Yanikian yelled \\"I will kill you,\\" pulled a Luger pistol from a hollowed-out book and emptied nine rounds, hitting the Turkish diplomats in the shoulders and chest, though none of the wounds were lethal. As Baydar and Demir lay on the ground, Yanikian took a Browning pistol from a drawer and fired two rounds into the head of each man, \\"what he considered mercy shots.\\"Bobelian. Children of Armenia, pp. 147-48. He phoned the front desk of the hotel from his room and requested that the sheriff be contacted, because \\"I have just killed two men.\\" Before meeting the Turkish diplomats, Yanikian had sent a letter to an Armenian language newspaper, urging Armenians to \\"wage a war on Turkish diplomats.\\"West, Richard. \\"Armenian Held in 2 Slayings Urged 'War' on Turk Envoys.\\" Los Angeles Times. January 30, 1973 The Turkish Embassy reacted to the killings by calling on the United States to take action to protect its nationals, and the American Ambassador in Ankara condemned the killings, stating he and all Americans were \\"shocked at this senseless act of violence.\\" Fifty FBI agents were assigned to investigate Yanikian's background, including exploring possible (though ultimately non-existent) ties to the Soviets or to a well-organized \\"Armenian gang.\\"See Bobelian, Children of Armenia, pp. 153-54. =Trial and sentencing= Yanikian pleaded not guilty to two charges of first degree murder. Although over the course of the trial he openly conceded that he had caused the deaths of the men, he insisted that he was \\"not guilty\\" of any crime. Yanikian insisted that what he did was \\"destroy two evils,\\" as the victims were \\"not human\\" for him.People v. Yanikian 39 Cal. App. 3d 366. Yanikian admitted that he conceived the assassination plan in April 1972, and meticulously implemented it over the intervening months between that time and the date of the actual homicides on January 27, 1973. He had originally planned to carry out the homicides in the consular offices, but changed his mind upon visiting the offices where he observed the presence of numerous employees who \\"might try to be heroes and get hurt.\\" In an interview with reporters in a court anteroom he slammed his hands down on the table and declared that other people \\"have had their Nuremberg but we have not.\\" Yanikian's defense counsel, headed by defense attorney James T. Lindsey, attempted to bring in survivors of the Armenian Genocide to testify as to the trauma of the experiences, as part of a defense strategy of depicting Yanikian as having \\"diminished mental capacity,\\" but these motions were denied in court. After Yanikian's death, District Attorney David D. Minier wrote, \\"Looking back, I regret that I did not allow the genocide to be proven. Not because Yanikian should have gone free, but because history's darkest chapters ‚Äî its genocides ‚Äî should be exposed, so their horrors are less likely to be repeated.\\" Armenians hoped Yanikian's trial would provide a vehicle for proving the massacres in a court of law, while there were still surviving witnesses, but District Attorney Minier didn't agree. Only Yanikian took the Armenian Genocide witness stand, accompanied by his friend and interpreter, Santa Barbaran Aram Saroyan, the uncle of famous author William Saroyan. Bobelian. Children of Armenia, p. 156. He concluded by saying that he killed the Turkish diplomats as representatives of the \\"government that had massacred his people.\\". Yanikian's defense was based entirely on his claim of \\"diminished capacity\\". However, the jury did not find this to be convincing, because it was clear from his testimony that he understood he was taking the lives of two human beings and that he did so because he considered it justified. Yanikian was sentenced to life in prison on July 2, 1973.Bobelian, Children of Armenia, p. 158. A California Court of Appeal declined his appeal and ruled that his \\"ability to deliberate and to premeditate his crime was demonstrated by his own testimony of the elaborate preparations pursuant to a plan which was executed with logic and precision. Defendant's testimony showed the plan was initiated many months prior to its execution and involved the use of a bait to lure the consular officials to the place chosen by defendant.\\" Despite objections from the Turkish government, Yanikian was paroled on January 31, 1984, because of poor health, and transferred to a Montebello convalescent hospital. He died of a heart attack one month later at the age of 88.\\"Paroled Assassin of Two Turkish Diplomats Dies.\\" Los Angeles Times, February 29, 1984. In 2019 the remains of Gourgen Yanikian have been moved from the US to Armenia, and buried at Yerablur Pantheon in Yerevan on Sunday, May 5.Gourgen Yanikian‚Äôs Remains to be Re-buried in Yerevan, Massis Post, 2019 Legacy Yanikian is known to have remarked, \\"I‚Äôm not Gourgen Yanikian but unacknowledged history coming back for the 1,500,000 Armenians whose bones desecrate my invisible existence.\\"Der Mugurdechian, Barlow. \\"Across the Chasm: From Catastrophe to Creativity\\" in The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies, ed. Richard G. Hovannisian. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2007, p. 72. In death, he became a symbol for many Armenians of their resentment toward the Turkish government for refusing to acknowledge the Armenian genocide. Upon his death, one of his attorneys, Bill Paparian, remarked that Yanikian \\"is now a piece of Armenian history.\\" It is believed that Yanikian's act set off the string of assassinations and targeted attacks against Turkish diplomats by ASALA and JCAG in the 1970s and 1980s. Yanikian would later be appropriated by ASALA as an iconic figure.. At the beginning, it bore the name of \\"The Prisoner Kurken Yanikian Group\\".. Because of this association, Yanikian's slayings have been characterized as \\"the opening salvo\\" of the armed attacks against the Turkish government and its agents.. According to Khachig T√∂l√∂lyan, \\"[Yanikian is] not understood in the context of his life, of his real biography, or even in the context of the brief autobiography we can glean from his utterances. He is assigned a regulative biography, and understood through it... enlisted in a resonating roll-call that blurs history, context, and nuance.\\" Cultural references There is a conversation between the Brano and Gavra from Olen Steinhauer's Liberation Movements dedicated to Yanikian's person: ‚Äî\\"Who's Gourgen Yanikian?\\" Gavra asked. ‚Äî\\"American citizen, Armenian descent. Two years ago he invited the Turkish consul general and the consul to lunch at the Baltimore Hotel in Santa Barbara, California. He shot them both with a Luger. Killed them.\\". In April 2009, In My Defense play was staged in Glendale, California. Dedicated to Yanikian's life and struggle, the play is written by Jack Emery for the BBC.

The series starred burlesque and vaudeville veteran entertainer Jimmy Durante and radio personality Garry Moore. The series was sponsored by Camel cigarettes and the Rexall Drug Corporation. The show also coined the famous catchphrase \\"Dat's my boy dat said dat!\\" which was said by Durante, often speaking of something that Moore said. That catchphrase would later inspire the legendary cartoon Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy. Background The origins of The Durante-Moore Show can probably be traced back to several radio stints that Jimmy Durante had in the 1930s. On September 10, 1933, Durante appeared on NBC radio's The Chase and Sanborn Hour which, at that time starred Eddie Cantor. He continued to make recurring appearances on the program until November 12 of that year. When Cantor left the show, Durante took over as the host from April 22 to September 30, 1934. Durante then became a regular on NBC's Camel Caravan. It was in 1943 when Caravan producer Phil Cohan decided to pair Durante with a young Garry Moore. Moore was an announcer on the radio at the time. After that episode aired, Cohan decided to create a radio series for the two. The series was to be a summer replacement series for The Abbott and Costello Show. Lou Costello, however, suffered a heart attack which put The Abbott and Costello Show on a short hiatus and, looking for a quick replacement, NBC put Durante and Moore on the air. On March 25, 1943, The Durante-Moore Show premiered on NBC under the name The Camel Comedy Caravan. The series was sponsored originally by Camel cigarettes. This sponsorship concluded after Camel refused to renew the series after the end of its third season. The March 30, 1945 broadcast was the last show sponsored by Camel. The show continued on April 6, 1945 with Rexall as its sponsor. The series had moved to CBS in October 1943. Moore's departure In the spring of 1947, Moore departed from the show. The reason why Moore left was to pursue a career in comedy. Another reason to Moore's departure was because CBS Television offered Moore his own daytime variety show The Garry Moore Show which started in 1949.\\"The Jimmy Durante And Garry Moore Show\\", NBC (1943), CBS (1943-1947): The Jimmy Durante Show The Jimmy Durante Show was an American old-time radio show. It aired on NBC with episodes running from October 1, 1947-June 30, 1950. It was a continuation of the NBC/CBS radio series The Durante-Moore Show after Garry Moore left when he was offered his own show on CBS Television. In mid-1947, Moore decided to leave the series after he was offered his own show on CBS Television. The last episode Moore appeared in and the last episode of the series under the name The Durante-Moore Show aired on June 27, 1947. The series then went under a short hiatus and then, on October 1, 1947, the series went back on the air this time on NBC under a new name The Jimmy Durante Show. The series originally starred Jimmy Durante with recurring guest stars Peggy Lee and Florence Halop. In its last season, actor and personality Alan Young was brought in as Durante's straight man. Ratings for the show were good. At the end of the 1947-48 season, The Jimmy Durante Show was tied for the number 7 show on the air along with Philco Radio Time on ABC and Dr. Christian on CBS. The show managed to stay in the top ten throughout its entire run. The series ended in June 1950 after Durante made a move to television with a starring role on NBC's Four Star Revue.

Along with Elsie Inglis she was instrumental in setting up the Muir Hall of Residence for Women Students in Edinburgh, and the Hospice, a nursing home and maternity hospital for poor women. Early life and education Jessie MacLaren MacGregor was born 7 May 1863. She was a student of Sophia Jex-Blake at the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women, and was one of the first women to take a medical degree at the University of Edinburgh, after the barriers to women qualifying as doctors were removed by the University. Having qualified initially with the Triple Qualification (LRCPE, LRCSE, LRFPSG), she took her MBChB (Bachelor of Medicine) degree in 1896, achieving first-class honours in every subject in the curriculum, passing all her professional examinations in the shortest time possible, and being awarded the Arthur Scholarship. Three years later, she took her MD (Doctor of Medicine), winning a gold medal for her thesis on the comparative anatomy of the auditory nerve. Career In 1894, she set up a medical practice in Edinburgh with Elsie Inglis at 8 Walker Street. After passing her MD in 1899 she was appointed as Junior Physician to the Edinburgh Hospital for Women and Children, and was also a Registrar and Assistant to the Extra Physicians at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh. In 1901 along with Elsie Inglis she was involved in setting up The Hospice on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh, a maternity hospital specifically for the care of working class women. She was also elected as a member of the Edinburgh Obstetrical Society in 1901, and was an active member, presenting samples and reading papers at meetings. In 1905, for family reasons, she left her practice in Edinburgh and emigrated to Denver, Colorado in the United States. Death and legacy She died of acute cerebral meningitis on 22 March 1906, in Denver, and is buried in that city's Fairmount Cemetery. In 1908, the Dr Jessie MacGregor Prize in Medical Science was set up as a memorial to her, with a value of ¬£75.

At the 2014 election the leader of the Conservative group on the council, David Monk, stood down as a councillor, along with a Liberal Democrat former mayor Neil Taylor and Labour councillor Carole Gill. However the former Labour leader of the council, Marie Rimmer did defend her seat in West Park at the election, despite being selected as the Labour candidate for St Helens South and Whiston at the 2015 general election. 16 seats were contested in 2014, with candidates from 7 political parties standing for election. The candidates included the Liberal Democrat group leader Stephanie Topping in Sutton, while a former Liberal Democrat mayor John Beirne stood for the UK Independence Party in Town Centre ward. Election result Labour gained 2 seats from the Liberal Democrats in Newton and Sutton to have 42 of the 48 councillors on St Helens council. The Liberal Democrat group leader Stephanie Topping was defeated in Sutton, coming third behind the UK Independence Party in the ward, but the Liberal Democrats did hold Eccleston to have 3 councillors after the election. Most of the 13 UK Independence Party candidates came second in the wards they stood in, but the party failed to win any seats on the council, with for instance John Beirne taking 667 votes for the party in Town Centre ward, compared to 1,470 for Labour candidate Lisa Preston.

In 2004, he participated in the foundation of Students for a Critical Economy, an association of which he was president until 2008, and that was in the same line as the Post-autistic economics movement born in France a few years earlier. The purpose of that group was academic and militant, since it denounced \\"the unique thinking and the intellectual emptiness that reigns in the teaching of economics\\" at the same time as it participated in social movements such like the Social Forum Another Malaga of 2004. The association would incorporate first as \\"Left-wing Students\\", a university association of a left-wing and anticapitalist nature, and later, in the platform of \\"Critical Students\\", a union of many progressive groups.

It is located above the village of Sant‚ÄôArcangelo, which is part of the commune of Magione, on the south-eastern shore of lake Trasimeno in the Italian region of Umbria.  The building  The site on a hill on the slope of an oak wood-covered mountain, surrounded by olive groves, offers a stunning view over lake Trasimeno. The powerful architecture shows traces of many changes and conversions undertaken by a succession of owners. Its original creation as a religious building remains obvious, in conjunction with elements of a strong fortress. The fa√ßade of the Romanesque church as part of the abbey call attention, as do the massive foundations with narrow slits typical for fortresses. Over time, a tower, battlements and loopholes ‚Äì still visible at the top of the tower ‚Äì accentuated the character of the abbey as a stronghold, also recognizable through external walls that are now enclosed, and openings now facing inward. The plant forms an irregular rectangle around a patio with a deep well. The church with its campanile, consecrated to Saint Michael, forms its north flank and a fortress tower with battlements the south-eastern angle.  History  The monastery-cum-fortress was built as part of a defensive chain of ramparts on the Eastern shore of lake Trasimeno around the year 1000, formed by the fortified settlements of San Feliciano, Monte del Lago, Zocco and San Savino. At that time, the village beneath Sant‚ÄôArcangelo was called Aiola, whereas the mountain above was and still is called Marzolano. In the year 1014 the monastery was one of the many properties the Emperor Henry II granted to the Abbey of Farneta in the Diocese of Arezzo; the crypt of the church dates from that period. A year after, however, in 1115, Pope Pascal II attributed it to the monastery of San Pietro in Perugia. Both attributions were confirmed by succession of Popes, which led to a conflict of interests between the two monasteries of Arezzo and Perugia.maginoecultura (it.) In 1206, for instance, Pope Innocent III counts Sant‚ÄôArcangelo \\"with all its properties\\" among the churches owing allegiance to the bishop of Perugia. In 1238, on the other hand, Pope Gregory IX confirmed the affiliation of the monastery to Santa Maria of Farneta. Every Ascension day, it had to pay a tribute of two measures of oil, ten measures of wheat and 20 measures of wine. This dependency of Farneta ended towards 1420; in 1332 an independent abbot presided over Sant‚ÄôArcangelo. Ties to Farneta ‚Äì and San Pietro - remained close, however, for which frequent commissions by the abbots of these monasteries to the abbot of Sant‚ÄôArcangelo testify. In 1361 the church of Sant‚ÄôArcangelo figured in the property register of Perugia with a modest value of two \\"heavy lira\\" and ten \\"pennies\\". This value rose with time, especially due to the addition of the properties of Santa Maria di Ancaelle, which were wholesale added to Sant‚ÄôArcangelo. Later, 1712 \\"heavy lira\\" were registered as its highest value. tower In 1376, Perugia enlarged its chain of ramparts especially on the traditionally vulnerable points on lake Trasimeno and the lake of Chiusi. The abbey of Sant‚ÄôArcangelo was strengthened in the manner of a fortress and received a consignment of weapons and ammunition. Towards the end of the 14th century, the monastery was barely inhabited anymore. It is not known whether causes other than the prevalence of malaria ‚Äì whose vectors, mosquitoes, bred in the swamps ‚Äì may have contributed to this. Around 1420 Monsignore Benedetto Guidalotti, bishop of Recenati and founder of the Faculty of New Sciences of Perugia, became interested in the now empty building. On 19 December 1426 he received from Pope Martin V the eternal property rights over the monastery and the surrounding land.siusa archivi beniculturali (it.) A second papal bull of 20 April 1426 specified that the mentioned land were to remain eternally the Faculty‚Äôs property ‚Äì a decision confirmed in 1429 and 1430. These papal decisions were again confirmed in 1488 in the property register of Perugia, which listed the monastery as part of the properties of the Faculty of New Sciences. The property registers of 1605 and 1786 confirm the ownership; the Faculty remained the owner of Sant‚ÄôArcangelo well into the 19th century. No one, however, seemed to be eager to cultivate the land around Sant‚ÄôArcangelo, which therefore offered it for \\"eternal settlement\\". In the end, a community of settling gypsies reclaimed it through draining the swamps at the bottom of the hill. In 1763 still, bishop Amadei commented after a visit to the church: \\"it is situated above a slope with an unhealthy climate\\". Over time, the system of ‚Äòeternal settlement‚Äô led to litigations and drained the finances of the Faculty to the point that it decided to lease the whole property at first for a period of three, then for six and finally nine years. patio The lease contract of 1779 lists a \\"cellar, oil mill, wheat and oil deposit, and household utensils for wine and oil in the mansions\\". The cultivation of mulberry trees in the middle of the 18th century produced significant profit. Throughout the 19th century, the Faculty‚Äôs accounts listed expenses for maintenance and repair for the buildings of Sant‚ÄôArcangelo. In 1858 it was deemed necessary to \\"build a kiln in order to produce the tiles necessary for restoration\\". At that time, the building was used for a diversity of purposes, which entailed a number of structural adaptations. The innermost of the monastery, probably once surrounded by arcades, was transformed into a patio with a deep well, whose inner shape has remained almost unchanged.  Modern period  winter 1995 As from 1901 the Faculty of New Sciences abandoned its educational vocation, following years burdened with troubles. Its properties continued to be managed by an administrative council for a number of years, until the nomination of a royal commissioner in 1913. Just before this, the decision was taken to sell the property of Sant‚ÄôArcangelo. On 31 March 1913, the notary Gianbattista Brizi authenticated the sale by the Faculty of the abbey and its rural properties to Count Grafen Massimiliano Goutry, with exception of the church, the rectory and a small garden. The receipts tell that the Faculty continued to administrate these remnants. On 16 April 1921 a couple from Rome, Gastone Cerulli Irelli und Elena Vitali acquired the property ‚Äì authenticated by a notary ‚Äì and remained its owners until 1935. On 9 January 1935 the notary Filippo Biarati certified the sale of the property to Carlo Bona und Valeria Delleani from Turin, who were its last private owners. From them it passed on first to the real estate company ‚ÄòSant‚ÄôArcangelo‚Äô of Lorenzo Bona, then successively to the companies ‚ÄòLa Badia‚Äô and ‚ÄòTarga Verde‚Äô. In 1986/7 the architect Nicola De Menna bought the property, renovated it completely dividing it into a good dozen apartments, while respecting the stringent conditions applying to historic monuments. The building is surrounded by an olive grove with centenary-old trees; a swimming pool and a tennis court are part of today‚Äôs property.  The church  Olive grove, apsis on the right The date of its construction is unknown; in 1565 it was mentioned that it featured a baptism font and a bell tower. In 1788 the decision was taken to rebuild the old bell tower of the 15th century. The frescoes of the church stem from the same period; a crucifixion with angels and seraphim is still visible today. Earlier, a Saint Girolamo and an Archangel Michael were depicted on the side of the main altar. On another wall of the church, remnants of older frescoes are visible. One of the two side altars ‚Äì which were initially shaded by canopies ‚Äì was completely rebuilt in 1817 after lightning damaged it. The apsis was walled in at an unknown date; it shape is recognizable in the outer wall from the outside and from the inside in the apartment above the church. Nowadays, a wooden life-size statue of Saint Anthony the Great stands on the left wall, and a statue of Saint Rita of Cascia on the right wall. The church is still consecrated and at times used for weddings. Once a year, on St Michael‚Äôs day, the priest of Sant‚ÄôArcangelo holds mass for the local population.

Its main house built in 1818 and repeatedly enlarged and renovated, the Lucerne Inn has served travelers for nearly 200 years. In the 1920s it was the centerpiece of an ultimately unsuccessful effort to develop a resort catering to the wealthy on nearby Phillips Lake. The inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Lucerne Inn is set on the west side of Route 1A, roughly midway between Bangor and Ellsworth. Its main building is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, six bays wide, with a hip roof, clapboard siding, and a brick and granite foundation. A porch extends across the east-facing front, supported by paired Tuscan columns. To either side of this main block there are three bay extensions with front-gable roof, that on the left side further extended by an enclosed porch area. One of Dedham's early settlers, Nathan Phillips, established a traveler's accommodation near this site in 1810. Under the auspices of his son the property grew to assume its present dimensions, and was known as the \\"Lake House\\". In 1925 this property, as well as all of the land surrounding Phillips Lake, was acquired by New York investor Harold M. Saddlemire, who proposed to a major resort development called \\"Lucerne-in-Maine\\". The Lake House was moved a short way to its present location and given a then-modern Colonial Revival restyling, with the intent that it would serve as a clubhouse for the facilities. A series of roads and house lots were laid out, the golf club (now the Lucerne-in-Maine Golf Club) was established, and a log lodge was built for the exclusive use of resort members. The resort had the support of a significant portion of the state's political and business elite. However, mismanagement of its funds, combined with the effects of the Great Depression, spelled the failure of the enterprise. Today The inn today offers rooms and suites, and has a dining room with a view overlooking the lake. Other amenities include a swimming pool, indoor and outdoor seating areas, and gazebos.

Some of her major works include Portraits of the Children of Marshall Duke d'Enghien (1810), Portrait of Queen Hortense with her Children (1812), the Royal Princes, Portrait of the Princesses Louise and Marie d'Orl√©ans, and Portrait of the Prince de Joinville. Godefroid is best known as a portrait painter. Biography Godefroid was born in Paris and was trained in the Davidian style of painting. She first studied art under her father, the royally-appointed art restorer Ferdinand-Joseph Godefroid. She would go on to become an instructor of arts and music at the Institute of Saint-Germain-en- Laye de Jeanne Campan, where young elite women of the Napoleonic period were trained. In 1795, she quit her post, however, to dedicate herself completely to painting. Around 1805, she joined the atelier of Baron Fran√ßois G√©rard, with whom she would latter collaborate. She joined his household by 1812 as an assistant in his office and studio, as well as a companion for him, his wife, and their nephews. Godefroid was also a student of Jean-Baptiste Isabey who worked in oil, aquarelle, and pastels. Between 1800 and 1847, she exhibited portraits in nineteen exhibitions at the Paris Salon, winning medals in 1812 and 1824. Notably, in 1810, she exhibited the celebrated Portraits of the Children of Marshall Duke d'Enghien (Portrait en pied des enfans de M.gr le mar√©chal duc d'Elchingen), a full-length portrait of the children of Marshal Ney. The work depicts Ney's eight-year-old son Joseph Napol√©on, second-oldest son Michel Louis, and two-year-old son Eug√®ne in fancy dress. Some of her other exhibited works included portraits of the children of the Duke of Rovigo and Queen Hortense in 1812, portraits of the children of the Duke of Orleans in 1819 and 1822, and portraits of the Duke of Orleans and Monsieur and Madame de Guiche in 1827. She also portrayed other notable figures including Abd el- Kader, the painter Jacques-Louis David, Jeanne Campan, Germaine de Stael, Talleyrand and Marshal Lauriston, among others. She also created several portraits that were not exhibited: the portraits of Mrs. Oudenarde, the Latour Maubourg Countess, violinist Pierre Rode, and Camille Jordan, whose portrait was engraved by Mullier. Godefroid was one of the many women artists that Empress Jos√©phine de Beauharnais patronized. She also worked as a copyist and reproduced several works for the French government, including the portraits of Louis XVIII and Charles X.

It features material from the original line-up of Cockney Rebel, the Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel line-up, and two tracks from Harley's solo career. Background Following the disappointing sales of his second solo album The Candidate in 1979, EMI Records dropped Harley from their label. A year later, EMI decided to release a compilation album of Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel's work. The compilation producer Colin Miles was selected to compile the album, and The Best of Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel was released in November 1980. It was the band's first compilation to be released in the UK. The compilation features twelve tracks spanning from 1973 to 1978. Six are Cockney Rebel tracks from 1973-74, four are Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel tracks from 1975-76, and two are from Harley's solo career, which were 1974's \\"Big Big Deal\\" and 1978's \\"Riding the Waves (For Virginia Woolf)\\". Of the chosen inclusions, \\"Cavaliers\\" and \\"Riding the Waves (For Virginia Woolf)\\" were never released as singles. In effort to promote the compilation, EMI re-issued the band's 1975 UK number one hit \\"Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)\\". It was released as a 7\\" vinyl single on 3 October 1980. The chosen B-Side was the band's 1973 European hit \\"Sebastian\\". The single came with a full picture sleeve, which featured the same photographs of Cockney Rebel, on both the front and back of the sleeve, as would appear on the sleeve of the compilation album. The single did not make a chart appearance in the UK, and when the compilation was released a month later, it also failed to chart. After the release of the compilation, Harley and a new line-up of Cockney Rebel embarked on a UK Christmas tour. During this tour, Harley introduced three new songs; \\"Warm My Cold Heart\\", \\"I Can Be Anyone\\" and \\"Such is Life\\", as well as a reggae-version of \\"Mr. Soft\\". Release The album was released by EMI on vinyl and cassette in the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Portugal, and Australia.

Like similar names (e.g., Podgorje), this describes the physical location of the settlement. In the local dialect, the settlement is known as Podgarca.

Originally published in Spanish, it was later translated to English by Lucia Graves. This is the third novel in the series \\"The Cemetery of Forgotten Books\\" written by the author. The book begins one year after the wedding of Daniel Sempere and Beatriz Aguliar. This is a direct sequel to Zafon's first novel in the series The Shadow of the Wind. Plot summary Daniel Sempere has settled into married life well and his son is shortly turning one year old. He is living above the family bookshop, Sempere & Sons with his elderly father, his wife Beatriz and son Julian. Though business has declined further in recent years, his friend Ferm√≠n Romero de Torres still finds a place at the bookshop and continues to source rare books while bringing a smile to the faces of the customers. One day a mysterious man arrives and asks about a rare and expensive copy of The Count of Monte Cristo that's kept in a display case behind the counter. He purchases the book from Don Sempere Snr and writes an inscription on the cover page: \\"For Ferm√≠n Romero de Torres, who came back from among the dead and holds the key to the future.\\" The book is left as a gift for Ferm√≠n. When he returns to the bookshop later he is upset by the gift. It's revealed that Ferm√≠n was in prison 20 years earlier with the mysterious stranger as well as David Martin (the protagonist of Zaf√≥n's second novel The Angel's Game). While in prison Ferm√≠n, inspired by the story of The Count of Monte Cristo, escaped by taking the place of a dead cell mate, stealing a key from the stranger. Knowing the stranger has finally tracked him down, Ferm√≠n, with the help of Daniel, attempts to locate the man and come to an arrangement before he's required to pay the ultimate price. Themes The morality of men's action during war is explored throughout the book and it's contrasted against acceptable behaviour post-war. Deception plays a large role in how the characters interact with each other and the influence their lies have on their future (e.g. Ferm√≠n's explanation of his past to the Sempere's, Daniel's avoidance of his marital problems). Impact on The Angel's Game The Prisoner of Heaven highlights the unreliability of the narrator in The Angel's Game and sheds light on the mental instability of David Martin who has fallen further into insanity in the flashbacks from Ferm√≠n's time in prison. As a result, major aspects of The Angel's Game are called into question including whether David was ever truly healed of his brain tumour. Structure and style Like Zafon's earlier novels, The Prisoner of Heaven follows a non- linear structure. The core of the book is written in the first person from Daniel's point of view; however, the plot relies on flashbacks in the third person.

On March 8, 2015, the death toll increased to 58, according to Nigerian police.

The church now serves as the Oratory for the Contrada of Pantera. Across the street from the belltower is the Palazzo Celsi Pollini. North along Pian dei Mantellini, toward the Arco delle Due Porte, and on the same side of the street are a number of palaces built around what was once the Monastery of the Derelict Women: in order they are the Neoclassical Palazzo Incontri, the Palazzo Ravissa and the Palazzo Segardi. Church of San Niccol√≤ al Carmine. History Tradition holds that some hermits lived at the site in 770; the site then acquired an aedicule with the icon of the Mantellini. A church and convent of the Carmelites developed at the site and was documented since about 1265.La chiesa di S. Niccol√≤ del Carmine in Siena, by Vittorio Lusini, 1907, page 7. At this time, the church was outside the walls of the medieval city, outside the Porta de Due Porte, also called the Gate of Stalloregi and the Arco di Santa Lucia. In the 14th-century, the convent was engrossed by the Walls of Siena.V. Lusini, page 8. The church and bell-tower as we see it today was designed by Baldassare Peruzzi in 1517; work continued on the church until the 17th century. Later it became a military barrack. To the sides of the entry is an Anunciation by Dionisio Montorselli. A fresco in the second altar on the right depicts a 14th-century Assumption of the Virgin. An Adoration of the Shepherds on the right was begun by Riccio, and completed by 1571 by Arcangelo Salimbeni, Another painting here is by Stefano Volpi. St Michael defeats the Rebel Angels A canvas depicts the Blessed Franco da Grotti, painted by Rutilio Manetti; St Bartholomew in the Counterfacade altar is a masterwork (1604) by Alessandro Casolani. The Vision of St Teresa of Avila, was painted by Giuseppe Colignon; an Ascent of Christ by Giacomo Pacchiarotti is on a sepulchral monument with relics of the blessed Giovanni Colombini. The St Michael defeats the Rebel Angels is a masterwork by Domenico Beccafumi in the altar near the lateral door. An altar on the right houses an ancient and revered icon of the Virgin, the Madonna dei Mantellini (circa 1240). The Byzantine style image had popular devotion as the focus for prayers for infants and newborns (who were swaddled in \\"Mantellini\\") and this gave name to the area and street. Around the painting are depictions of saints by Francesco Vanni. The Chapel of the Holiest Sacrament at the right end of the nave, was once kept by the wool-workers. The marble altar was created by Lorenzo di Mariano and it has a Nativity of Mary by Sodoma. The Mannerist painter Girolamo del Pacchia also decorated this chapel in 1512. Next to the Main Altar is a canvas depicting the Blessed Franco by Rutilio Manetti and a St Teresa of Avila by Stefano Volpi. The main altar with polychrome marble was designed by Tommaso Redi. The Sacristy (1512) was designed by Vannoccio Biringucci, and has a St Sigismondo in terra cotta by Giacomo Cozzarelli (1515). The cloister was completed in the 16th century and was frescoed by Giuseppe Nasini.Guida di Siena e dei suoi dintorni, Enrico Torrini, editor; Siena, (1907); page 77-78.

Born Edna Jeanette MacDougall, her father, a violinist in vaudeville theaters, died when she was six years old. As a result, her mother gave her up for adoption to a widow, Mrs. Jane MacFarlane, of Goderich, Ontario. Ta√ßon was trained as a violinist and moved with her adopted mother to Toronto in 1924 to pursue a degree in music. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in Music from the University of Toronto in 1927. Marrying Percy Henry Ta√ßon in April 1929, Edna Ta√ßon continued to perform and study the violin in New York and Europe, notably in Switzerland with Oscar Studer during the summer of 1935. Her husband's career as a painter and instructor of art and modern languages may have influenced her decision to pursue painting and, particularly, abstraction. Art historians Joyce Zemans, Elizabeth Burrell, and Elizabeth Hunter have written that \\"Ta√ßon would later tell an interviewer that it was her husband who encouraged her to investigate abstraction,\\" after he began drawing abstractly in 1937. Yet it was Edna Jeannette Ta√ßon who would become known internationally for her abstract painting. Ta√ßon was influenced by Kandinsky's theories on abstraction and color and saw the relationship between abstract painting and music as similarly intuitive and creative. She wrote: \\"Many people will say that painting cannot reach the sublime summit that music has attained as an abstract art. But there is an analogy between music and painting when both are nonrepresentational ... It is the ambitious aim of our modern artist to exploit...all the ramifications of such an analogy.\\" Ta√ßon used collage in her early years, employing the term \\"paper plastics,\\" to describe these works. She may have come across this term through the writing Hilla Rebay, curator of the Museum of Non-Objective Painting in New York, who used it in a catalog as early as 1939. She became involved with the Museum of Non-Objective Painting in 1941 when she took some of her paper plastics to be critiqued. As a result, Ta√ßon was awarded a scholarship by the Foundation and three works by Ta√ßon were exhibited in March 1941 as part of the exhibit Ten American Non-Objective Painters. Ta√ßon was to spend a number of years moving back and forth between Hamilton and New York City. In the fall of 1941 she had her first solo shows in New York at Studio 83 and in Toronto at the Eaton's Fine Arts Galleries. She was at this time working in oils, gouache, and ink, as well as in paper plastics. Starting in 1942, Ta√ßon's work was included in a series of group shows by the Guggenheim Foundation and in 1943 she joined the museum as a hostess and guide. She was increasingly exhibited in Canada as well. The Art Gallery of Ontario included her in the exhibition Four Canadian Artists, also featuring Jessie Faunt, Michael Forster, and Gordon Webber. She had seven solo shows between 1941-1947 at the Eaton's Fine Arts Galleries and was shown in the Hamilton Women's Art Association's annual Spring show in 1942 and 1943. In 1945, Ta√ßon was included for the first time in the Ontario Society of Artists annual exhibition. The Canadian Group of Painters invited her to exhibit as a non-member in their 1945-46 show. In January 1946, she was elected to the membership of the group. Writing on the 1945-46 Group show, Graham Innes commented that the Group was \\"in a rut\\" and that the most interesting work was in the field of reportage and abstraction. Ta√ßon's Tonal Poem illustrated the article. In 1945, the Ta√ßons moved to Toronto when Percy Ta√ßon was appointed as Head of the Art Department of the Ontario College of Education. Edna Ta√ßon had her first solo exhibition in New York in October 1946. According to Zemans, Burrell, and Hunter, this exhibit marked a change in direction in her work towards a more expressionistic approach. Her paintings nevertheless remained indebted to Kandinsky's \\"theory of the spiritual nature of art.\\" During her time in Toronto, Ta√ßon taught design and art history at Toronto Western Technical School. Divorcing Percy Ta√ßon, remarrying Paul Arnold, and divorcing again, after 1949 Ta√ßon did not exhibit publicly again although she continued to paint. Her work can be found in the collection of the Guggenheim, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the Robert McLaughlin Gallery, Oshawa. Edna Jeanette Ta√ßon died in New York in 1980.

As a poet, she employs a variety of genres, using humor and irony to criticize prevailing attitudes towards women and to mock the politics of her times. She is the first Italian woman writer to use humor and satire in her published works. Some of her poems are partially autobiographical for they include allusions to events in her life and complaints about her lack of fortune and literary recognition. Her poetry stresses the obstacles she faced as a woman and the difficult life of women in general. Costa was a prolific writer, publishing two books of prose, six volumes of poetry, three plays, two narrative poems and an allegorical pageantry, in verse, for knights on horseback. (See \\"Introduction\\" to Margherita Costa, *, p. 19). Biography Frontis illustration of a production of Costa's play Li buffuni: comedia ridicola in a 1641 printed edition of the play. Costa was born in Rome, Italy. She and her sister, Anna Francesca, began their careers as singers and perhaps courtesans in Rome, where they received the patronage of families such as the Aldobrandini. In 1628, Costa moved to Florence, where she began her literary career. At the ducal court, she obtained the protection of Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, Vittoria della Rovere, and other members of the Medici family. She may have also married the court buffoon Bernardino Ricci, known as \\"Tedeschino\\" (as well as the \\"Cavalier of Pleasure\\"), to whom she dedicated a 1641 comedy entitled The Buffoons. During this period, Costa also published several volumes of poetry, a drama, and a collection of love letters. Also printed under her name was a historical account of Ferdinando's 1627 voyage to Germany, but because Costa acknowledged that she received her information from a member of the ducal court, her detractors accused her of not having composed the work herself. In 1644, Costa left Florence and returned to Rome under the protection of Cardinal Francesco Barberini, to whom she dedicated a sacred poem about the Roman Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of music. Costa briefly left the city the following year in order to assume a post as a singer at the court of Duchess Christine of Savoy. Costa would later portray the Turin court in a collection of poems dedicated to the duchess and published in 1647, at which time she had been invited to travel from Rome to Paris with the group of musicians of the composer Luigi Rossi, to sing in his opera , which was performed to glorify the court of the young Louis XIV of France. Over the course of that year, under the patronage of Cardinal Mazarin, she published a volume of poetry in honor of the king's mother and regent, Anne of Austria, and the text for an equestrian ballet dedicated to the cardinal, as well as the volume for Christine of Savoy. Little is known about the latter part of her life. She was in Venice in August 1650 and from there she most likely traveled to Germany. In the dedication to the dukes of Brunswick-L√ºneburg of her play, *, (The Loves of the Moon Goddess), she claims that she lived for four years under a foreign sky. The play was published in Venice in 1654 on her way back to Rome. The last preserved document by Margherita is a letter written on May 4, 1657, to Mario Chigi, commander-in-chief of the papal armies and brother to Pope Alexander VII, imploring assistance. In this letter, she describes herself as a widow with two daughters. The date of her death is unknown.

Besides essays on feminism and academic works on poets such as Giorgio Caproni, Franco Fortini, Amelia Rosselli, she has written plays, radio-dramas, a television show on Petrarch and a novel.Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies (Routledge: New York, 2007) pp. 770-772 She teaches Modern Italian Literature at the University of Rome La Sapienza, where she got her Laurea degree.  Life and career =Early life= Frabotta was born in Rome, in the same month of the proclamation of democracy in Italy.Giovanna De Luca, \\"Biancamaria Frabotta\\", in Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies, ed. Gaetana Marrone Puglia (Routledge: New York, 2007), 772. As a child, she grew up in the capital, with frequent sojourns in the port-city of Civitavecchia which will later appear in her poetry.In particular in B. Frabotta, La viandanza, Mondadori: Milan 1995 After graduating at the Liceo Classico, she started studying Literature at the University of Rome La Sapienza. Her Laurea dissertation is dedicated to the writings of Carlo Cattaneo and won the Carlo Cattaneo prize of the Fondazione Ticino Nostro in Switzerland. In Rome, Frabotta also studied modern poetry (especially Eugenio Montale's work) with Walter Binni. As a university student, she took part in the protests of the 1968, becoming a relevant figure in the students' movement and showing a specific engagement (both as a writer and as an activist) for women's issues and gender theory.See her book B. Frabotta, Femminismo e lotta di classe, Savelli: Rome, 1973. See also the page of the Venice Municipality on Feminist Italian movements, which references Frabotta's work. During the late Sixties and the Seventies, she developed strong personal and intellectual connections with artists and writers based in Rome such as Alberto Moravia, Dacia Maraini,Who was part of the feminist movement as well, and recently mentioned Frabotta as one of the best Italian poets in her personal website Amelia Rosselli For Rosselli, in 1996, she wrote an eulogy that was read during the poet's funeral in Rome, Elogio del fuoco (now in B. Frabotta, Quartetto per masse e voce sola, pp. 65-68 and Dario Bellezza. In 1972 she dubbed one of the characters in the much discussed Italian version of Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris. After publishing her Laurea dissertation as a book in 1971, she wrote an essay on Feminism and Class struggle (1973) and edited the first anthology of modern Italian women poets (Donne in poesia) which has been later translated in English. In the same year, 1976, she published her first poetry book, Affeminata, with the independent avantgarde press Geiger ‚Äî founded by Adriano Spatola and Giulia Niccolai. The preface was written by Antonio Porta, an eminent figure in the Gruppo 63. =Academic and Literary Career= A contributor and cultural journalist for many Italian newspapers and journals over the years (Poesia, Alfabeta, Il Manifesto, Orsa minore), Frabotta is also an academic critic and a professor at the University of Rome La Sapienza, where she mainly teaches contemporary Italian poetry.See her page on the University website. See also her biography in Giovanna De Luca, \\"Biancamaria Frabotta\\", in Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies, ed. Gaetana Marrone Puglia (Routledge: New York, 2007), 770-772. Her main poetic publications are usually preceded by thematic plaquettes that, combined and made interacting with each other, eventually form the body of her books.As it is evident from her bibliography, see Marco Corsi, Biancamaria Frabotta: i nodi violati del verso (Florence: Clueb, 2010). The progression of themes and questions throughout the different plaquettes is described as a \\"novel\\" in Italian Women Poets, ed. by Catherine O'Brien (Irish Academic Press: Dublin, 1996), 235. After publishing the first major book, Il Rumore Bianco, with Feltrinelli in 1982, she started an editorial collaboration with Mondadori, publishing three books (La Viandanza, La Pianta del Pane, and Da Mani Mortali) in the prestigious collection Lo Specchio, which had previously published protagonists of the Italian Modernism such as Eugenio Montale, Giuseppe Ungaretti, and Umberto Saba. Frabotta has received numerous literary prizes, including Premio Tropea (1989), Premio Montale (1995),\\"Premio montale: a biancamaria frabotta con 76 voti\\" from the Archive of the Italian Association of Journalists Premio Dess√¨ (2003),Site of the prize, palmares. Premio L'Olio della Poesia (2015) http://www.salentonline.it/eventi/dettagli.php?id_elemento=7357 Critics such as Stefano Giovanardi argue that Frabotta's poetic language has evolved from an initial experimentalism to a more cohesive, recognizable voice developed towards the end of the millennium. Such a transition, in opposition with the mainstream tendencies of European postmodernism, led her poetry to a style that is, at the same time, harmonically classical and yet marked by sudden stridencies, rhythmic gaps, and unexpected turns of the imagery.See S. Giovanardi, \\"Biancamaria Frabotta\\", in Poeti Italiani del Secondo Novecento, eds. M. Cucchi - S. Giovanardi, Mondadori: Milan 2004, pp. 907-908. However, Frabotta's work as a writer, an particularly as a poet, remains interdigitated with her political and academic experiences.

The School's administration was required by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, to develop a School Improvement Plan to address the low student achievement. Under the Pennsylvania Accountability System, the school district must pay for additional tutoring for struggling students. The High School is eligible for special, extra funding under School Improvement Grants which the school must apply for each year.

The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education. In 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1.

She was born in Gambell, Alaska. Silook works primarily with walrus tusk ivory and whalebone, and selects for her subject matter images of women, including violence against Native women, rather than the more common depictions of animal motifs. She explores the realm of the fantastic in Yupik culture, working with ancestral ivory doll forms from her tribe on St. Lawrence Island. She is an activist for Indigenous women and artists, building awareness around the cultural, legal use of walrus ivory and other media from the food sources of her people, which are slowly being banned in the United States due to President Obama's order banning elephant ivory in America. Highlighting the overreach of colonialist conservation in this disenfranchisement of the one of few resources available to communities still living harmoniously with their natural environment, she advocates for the rights of Indigenous People in conservation movements. Silook's sculptures are in the Anchorage Museum, the Alaska Native Heritage Center, de Young Museum, and the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art.

West-East Bag formed towards the beginning of the feminist art movement in the United States. Sources differ as to the exact origin of WEB. In one account, artists Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro formed the idea with art critic Lucy R. Lippard in April 1971 after visiting the exhibition 26 Women Artists. A second account places New York Times art writer Grace Glueck at the formation and a third has Chicago and Schapiro meeting Lippard, Marcia Tucker and Ellen Lanyon during a lecture trip. Lippard recalls mentioning East Coast Bag while talking to Chicago, who replied \\"ah ha, if you're going to say East Coast Bag then we're going to call it West East Bag instead of East West Bag, because the west coast came first.\\" In 1971, West-East Bag published the first issue of their newsletter W.E.B. to link efforts in their home cities. The inaugural issue made mention of tactics used against museums to protest the lack of women artists in their collections and exhibitions. Schapiro (Los Angeles), Lippard (New York), and Ellen Lanyon (Chicago) tooks turns producing the then-monthly newsletter. Like the Ad Hoc Women Artists' Committee before them, the group encouraged chapters to set up slide registries of women artists. WEB slide registries were created in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and Seattle. WEB members also held consciousness raising sessions and organized protests of their local art institutions. Local chapters such as Boston and Chicago published their own WEB newsletters, sponsored conferences, and organized monthly meetings. By April 1972, Chicago's WEB chapter had sponsored a series of conferences that led to the formation of feminist arts organizations across the Midwest. WEB members in Chicago organized the first women artists' conference there, Artists Meet in Spring 1973. West-East Bag laid the foundation for a series of cooperatively run women's galleries, starting with A.I.R. Gallery in 1972. West-East Bag grew to include representatives from 52 cities and eight countries. By 1973, WEB ceased being active on a national level.

Each time the weaver moved the sley to beat-up the weft, a rachet and pawl mechanism advanced the cloth roller. In 1802 William Ratcliffe of Stockport patented a Dandy loom with a cast-iron frame. It was this type of Dandy loom that was used in the small dandy loom shops. Economics In the mid 1830s, there were about twice as many weavers operating a variety of different handlooms as there were power-looms. The dandy loom increased the productivity of a hand-loom weaver by 50%. The dandy-loom weaver would work in a small workshop and would rent the loom for 10¬Ωd a week and in 1825 could expect to earn 5s a week. Timmins has tried to assess the relative importance of the hand-powered branch of the industry on the one hand and of the water- or steam-powered branches on the other. It is difficult: the output of power looms was certainly greater than that of the handlooms, but the handloom weavers produced higher quality cloths with greater profit margins. The weaving trade was only partially mechanised before about 1830, and that even so late as 1850, handloom weavers made up a sizeable minority of the total workforce as late as 1850.

Description Located adjacent to Washington Street, the bridge is constructed out of triangular concrete piers, metal cables thick, with wooden planking supported by runner borders bolted to the cables. The bridge is long, its piers set apart. At its highest point, the bridge is about above the ground. The bridge is one of a small number of suspension bridges in the state, and one of its most distinctive. History The bridge was built in 1927 during the local rebuilding effort following the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. The bridge was built by miners who were out of work due to the floods, and it replaced an earlier bridge which had been washed out by those floods that year. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 24, 2007 (as \\"Zinc Swinging Bridge-BO0162\\", reflecting the inclusion of its state cultural survey identifier). In June 2014, The swinging bridge partially collapsed due to the failure of its mostly shale western pier during repair work that was being done on it due to cracking which had first developed several years prior. Local government and residents endeavored to rebuild it without a grant as they felt that would take too long to be approved, and they needed it in place before heavy spring rainstorms which often render Sugar Orchard Creek impassable. The rebuilt bridge was completed in 2015 and followed the original structural design. The incident did not affect its listing on the NRHP.

She is best known for her project \\"CLITERACY,\\" which addresses citizenship and body sovereignty through the medium of text-based objects, unauthorized street installation, performance and sculptural forms.  Early life  Wallace was born in Seattle, Washington. She holds a BA in Government/Political Science from Smith College and a Master of Arts in Photography from New York University and the International Center of Photography. In 1998, Wallace did coursework in a study abroad program in Political Theory at the University of Ghana.  Career  = Conceptual framework = Wallace incorporates the use of images, video, and mixed media in her work in an effort to explore alterity, the study of otherness and the focus on dismantling the concept of sameness. Wallace‚Äôs focus is to deconstruct how this concept of the other is represented within a visual framework. She examines how the visual affects gender and sexuality. The focus is on the idea of what she calls the \\"racialized body.\\" Wallace is trying to explore in her work the relinquishment of gender norms and stereotypes‚Äîthrough images she examines and moves these issue to the forefront looking at the norms of gender.  Modern Dandy  In 2011, Wallace worked in the mediums of photography and portraiture in order to examine assumptions about gender, race, and heteronormativity. She photographed professional male models who were what she called \\"living representations of idealized masculinity\\" and examine the male models in a comparative way that women are traditionally photographed. It is an examination of what is typically viewed as a passive view of women through a photographic view. Exploring the origin of the concept of dandy from the 19th century thinkers Oscar Wilde and Charles Baudelaire, the works call into question gender norms. Installation view of ŒÜŒ¥Œ¨ŒºŒ±œÇ (Unconquerable), 2013, by Sophia Wallace  CLITERACY  In 2012, Wallace has received international critical acclaim and viral exposure for CLITERACY: 100 NATURAL LAWS. The project aims to \\"dismantle the taboos associated with female and feminized genitals.\\" Using text as form, CLITERACY \\"explores the construction of female sexual bodies as passive vehicles of reception defined by lack. It confronts a false body of knowledge by scientists who have resisted the idea of a unique, autonomous female body and rather studied what confirmed their assumption that women‚Äôs anatomy was the inverse of male anatomy, and that reproduction was worthy of study, while female sexuality was most certainly not.\\" Wallace has also created sculptural forms such as ŒÜŒ¥Œ¨ŒºŒ±œÇ (unconquerable)', the first anatomically correct sculpture of the clitoris, and Invisible Sculpture, which \\"addresses negation and omnipresence by denying access to the form while reinforcing its presence.\\" = Exhibitions = Wallace has presented her work in exhibitions in the U.S. and abroad, including Kunsthalle Wien Museum, Art Basel Miami, Scope NY, Taschen Gallery and Aperture Gallery among others.

It is situated in the southern constellation of Sculptor. Visually, it appears to be an irregular galaxy, as the ESO image to the right shows. H11 is named after Guillermo Haro, a Mexican astronomer who first included it in a study published in 1956 about blue galaxies. H11 is a starburst galaxy that has 'super star clusters' within it and is one of nine galaxies in the local universe known to emit Lyman Continuum photons (LyC). Background The Schmidt Camera at the Tonantzintla Observatory. Guillermo Haro first described H11 in a study published in 1956 listing 44 galaxies that were blue. The observations had been carried out at the Tonantzintla Observatory in Mexico using the Schmidt Camera. Since then, The NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) gives 123 citations for H11. The first study showing the possible escape of Lyman Continuum Photons was published in 2006, using data from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). The study's aim was to select \\"an extreme starburst dwarf, the Blue Compact Galaxy Haro 11, with the aim of determining the Lyman continuum escape fraction from UV spectroscopy.\\" The image in the information box above right was made combining data from ESO's Very Large Telescope and the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. A team of astronomers Stockholm University, Sweden, and the Geneva Observatory, Switzerland, identified 200 separate clusters of very young, massive stars, many of which are less than 10 million years old. The observations have led the astronomers to conclude that H11 is most likely the result of a merger between a galaxy that is rich in stars and a younger, gas-rich galaxy. Lyman Continuum Photons Haro 11 is one of nine galaxies in the local universe that have been identified as leaking Lyman Continuum photons. LyC leakage is crucial to the process known as Reionization which is theorised to have occurred between redshift z=11 and z=7, that is to say within the first 10% of the age of the Universe. Reionization, or The Epoch of Reionization (EofR), is the period during which the gas in the early Universe went from being almost completely neutral to a state in which it became almost completely ionized. The EofR is intimately linked to many fundamental questions in cosmology, structure formation and evolution. The Kinematics of Haro 11 In November 2015, a study was published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics by Goran Ostlin et al. which examined the kinematics of H11 using observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile. The study also compared H11 to The Antennae Galaxies (NGC 4038), a pair of interacting galaxies. The abstract states: \\"In this work, we investigate the kinematics of stars and ionised gas in Haro 11, one of the most luminous blue compact galaxies in the local Universe. Previous works have indicated that many of these galaxies may be triggered by galaxy mergers.\\" Further on, the abstract states: \\"We find that to first order, the velocity field and velocity dispersions derived from stars and ionised gas agree. Hence the complexities reveal real dynamical disturbances providing further evidence for a merger in Haro 11. Through decomposition of emission lines, we find evidence for kinematically distinct components, for instance, a tidal arm.\\" The abstract finishes with: \\"Haro 11 shows many resemblances with the famous Antennae galaxies both morphologically and kinematically, but it is much denser, which is the likely explanation for the higher star formation efficiency in Haro 11.\\" Further Studies A picture of Haro 11 taken in 2002 by Daniel Kunth and team with the HST ACS as part of program 9470. In September 2003, as a result of Program 9470, Daniel Kunth and team published the first images of Haro 11 using the then newly installed ACS on the HST (specifically the Solar Blind Channel) in a study titled: \\"The First Deep Advanced Camera for Surveys Lyalpha Images of Local Starburst Galaxies\\". The abstract for Kunth et al. states: \\"The ACS imaging reveals a complex Lyalpha morphology, with sometimes strong offsets between the emission of Lyalpha and the location of stellar light, ionized gas traced by Halpha, and the neutral gas. Overall, more Lyalpha photons escape from the more metal- and dust-rich galaxy ESO 350-IG038 [Haro 11].\\" See also *Lyman continuum photons *Lyman series *Lyman-alpha forest *Pea galaxy *Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization *Tololo 1247-232 References External links *Simulation of the Reionization of the Universe ‚Äì A video showing the gradual reionization of a typical patch of the universe (links to YouTube).

Plot summary  The narrator, who has a habit of taking late-night walks and patronizing movie theaters, takes a stroll into a part of town that he had never visited before. During his wandering, he comes across a strange theater advertising a single feature known as \\"The Glamour\\". His curiosity piqued, he approaches the theater and learns from the man at the ticket window that admission is free. Upon entering the theater, he realizes that the building is quite odd. The entire place radiates with a sinister glow of purples and pinks, eerily reminding the narrator of human organs. Another patron approaches him and informs that the theater is under new management. In the auditorium where The Glamour is to be shown, the place is covered with cobwebs reminiscent of human hair, including the projection screen. The place is nearly empty except for a few other patrons who gleefully make odd and cryptic remarks when asked about the supposed feature. When it finally begins, instead of a movie being shown, the screen displays silent scenes depicting some nightmarish other world, and the projection screen appears as disembodied eyes which are guiding the viewers, including the narrator, on a tour of this strange world. The images on screen then shift to depict the man he had met in the lobby earlier, now naked and uttering a silent scream surrounded by a purple glow, as if he has been \\"taken\\" by the strange being who seems to control the theater. Soon after, the naked man appears to undergo some kind of surgery with his organs completely exposed while being operated on. The narrator attempts to leaves just as the hair-like cobwebs come to life and restrain him to his seat. He breaks free from the hair-like restraints while the other patrons are consumed and as he is leaving he sees in the projection room the visage of an evil old woman with glowing eyes and monstrous hair, apparently the new \\"management\\" spoken of earlier who controls everything within the theater, and is the source of the nightmarish images displayed on screen during \\"The Glamour.‚Äù Having exited the building, the narrator notices the lights of the theater have shut off and the marquee outside has been taken down, signaling that it was the final performance. As he leaves the neighborhood, passing by the closed shops that were open when he arrived, the narrator can feel the presence of the old woman staring at him from behind their darkened windows.

Biography =Origins and early career= Born in Coste»ôti, Boto»ôani County, his family were peasants of Armenian origin who had arrived in the Moldavia region over a century earlier. His parents Melcon and Roza were poor, which meant that their son struggled materially as he passed through A. T. Laurian High School in Boto»ôani and the University of Bucharest's medical faculty. He graduated from the latter institution in 1905 with a thesis on fetal arteriology that he defended before professors Paul Petrini, Thoma Ionescu, Dimitrie Gerota, Anastasie Obregia and Dimitrie DrƒÉghicescu. The work earned him a magna cum laude degree and a letter of commendation from Wilhelm von Waldeyer. While a student, he became an extern in 1901, an intern at Spitalul Br√¢ncovenesc in 1902, and an assistant in the anatomy department the same year.S√¢rbu, p. 423 In 1907, Iacobovici won a competition to become assistant to Ionescu at Col»õea Hospital. In 1912, he became consulting physician at the same institution, as well as librarian of the medical faculty. He remained in Bucharest until 1919, taking part as a combat medic in the Second Balkan War and World War I. He wrote numerous scientific publications and proposed several new surgical techniques. In October 1919, following the union of Transylvania with Romania and the establishment of a medical faculty within the new Cluj University, he was named head of the surgical clinic at Cluj, with the rank of full professor. =At Cluj and return to Bucharest= The clinic Iacobovici set up included laboratories for biochemistry, urology, endoscopy, morphology and dissection, as well as ambulatory and emergency departments and sections for trauma, orthopedics, urology and chest surgery. In 1922, he edited a textbook on upper abdominal surgery. In 1926, together with several collaborators, he published a propaedeutics of surgery, the first of its kind in Romania. He served as university rector in 1922‚Äì1923, and during his term established Cluj University Press, the country's first university press. In May 1923, as he was walking from his bedroom to his dining room one evening, an assailant fired four shots at him from the street, but missed. The police were convinced the deed was the work of a disgruntled anti-Semitic student.NastasƒÉ, p. 212 When Iacobovici arrived in Transylvania, there were almost no Romanian surgeons in the province, methods of surgery were obsolete and Romanian-language teaching materials were scarce. Starting under these conditions, he managed to train surgeons who developed departments throughout Transylvania and even in the former Old Kingdom. In 1929, when he had Alexandru Pop appointed lecturer and, implicitly, his successor as clinic head, nearly all the senior physicians quit and went to other cities. In ten years, Iacobovici trained some forty surgeons, who later became department heads and, in some cases, university professors.S√¢rbu, p. 424 Among the types of operations in which he innovated were surgery for gastric ulcer, biliary bypass, tuberculosis, lumbar region, neurovegetative features and war wounds; as well as working on thyroid pathology, pulmonary exeresis and renal tumors. Following the accidental death in 1933 of Ernest Juvara, head of the surgery clinic at Spitalul Br√¢ncovenesc, Iacobovici was named as his replacement. At Bucharest, he continued working for a further fifteen years. He created yet another school of surgeons, founded the country's first emergency hospital in 1934, and in 1935 was a founding member of the Romanian Medical Academy. Taken together, around twenty professors emerged from under his tutelage at Cluj and Bucharest. During the National Legionary State, he was temporarily removed from his post of clinic director. After World War II, he showed increasing signs of Parkinson's disease and cardiac sclerosis. He asked to retire in 1947, and left the clinic for good in 1949. He died in 1959 and, in accordance with his last will, was immediately incinerated at Cenu»ôa Crematorium in a simple ceremony. He donated three buildings in Bucharest and his villa at T√¢rgu Ocna to what was now the Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy.S√¢rbu, p. 425 Notes References *Lucian NastasƒÉ, Antisemitismul universitar √Æn Rom√¢nia (1919-1939), Editura Institutului pentru Studierea Problemelor MinoritƒÉ»õilor Na»õionale, Cluj-Napoca, 2011, *V.

Smit was born on 22 October 1960 in Amersfoort. She was educated at the AKV St. Joost in Breda from 1979 to 1984, studying graphics and lithography. She holds her own website where you can see her art works. Career Smit is known for figurative \\"enigmatic sculptures\\" depicting ceramic animals like dogs, hares or rats. Her sculptures satirically play with the emotions such as hate, love, exuberance, alienation and unresolved emotions, using highly imaginative representations of skeletons, cats or babies. She creates characters with over active sentiment, inspired by themes from classic mythology and biblical tales, such as greed, power and impotence, perishability and death. Her sculptures are rich in symbolism and she often uses elements familiar to vanities, such as skulls, skeletons, small bones of animals. Much like in the 16th and 17th century Dutch Golden Age Vanitas paintings, that were a type of symbolic artwork especially associated with still life painting in Flanders and the Netherlands, her work is meant to symbolise temporary presence but with a touch of irony. Three of Smit's works are in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the world's largest museum of the decorative arts. In 2003, she had a solo exhibition at the Keramion, the renowned ceramics museum and center in Frechen, Germany. In 2010, over 60 of her sculptures were on display in a solo exhibition at the Kunsthal museum in Rotterdam. The exhibition lasted over three months and was the first major retrospective of her work.

She hasn't let the dialogue overpower the narrative. It helps that the drama's production values are excellent as is the visual story telling with hints at the character's inner lives. She lauded Maya Alli, Imran Abbas Naqvi and Hina Khawaja Bayat's role by saying Maya Ali‚Äôs restrained performance as Zulekha proves she's a director‚Äôs actor and so far Mehreen Jabbar has guided her well. Imran Abbas, who seems perennially youthful, also, pardon the pun, strikes a chord as the dreamer Yousuf. But if there was an actor who stole the spotlight today, it has to be Hina Khwaja Bayat. Siddiqui, on her other issue praised the shows plot and melodrama stating \\"TV drama Mera Naam Yousuf Hai plays the filmi card and wins\\". She further added that \\"It isn't merely filmi in the sense that it features over- the-top melodrama; there are also a fair number of larger-than-life events to contend with. These events aren't just plot points pushing the story forward, they're like cogs in a vast machine that represent the characters' interconnected, messy lives.\\" She commented on Khalil-Ur-Rehman Qamar's screenplay stating that \\"Khalil sahib's script brings into question society‚Äôs hypocrisies and double standards, as well as the different roles, expectations and allowances for men and women.\\" She also praised Mehreen Jabbar's directory saying \\"It is quite commendable that despite all these filmi touches and a tendency to go over the top, Mehreen Jabbar's directorial hand is very much in control.\\" In an issue of Dawn 6 April 2015, Sadaf Siddiqui stated that \\"Mera Naam Yousuf Hai is a One sided Love story so far\\" she comments not the plot stating \\"What does one do when one‚Äôs own parents are engaged in a game of one- upmanship, placing one‚Äôs freedom and right to choose in jeopardy?\\". For the current episode arc Sadaf once again praised Qamar's classic storyline stating \\"Khalilur Rehman Qamar‚Äôs writing sparkles with wit and clearly unke kamaan pe bahut se teer hai. The way the story and each of the characters is revealed adds something new to the plot progression and builds on each characters back stories.\\" On 29 July 2015, Sadaf Siddui's praised the show's screenplay and storyline commenting \\"Do class concerns trump love? Mera Naam Yousuf Hai asks big questions\\". In her article she said that \\"Writer creates chemistry and romantic tension between the leads despite them not sharing much screen time. It is sheer mastery that makes allowance for conservatism and added that he carefully tends to family relationships and friendships.\\" After summing up the entire show and story line, Siddiqui said that \\"The drama makes important observations about power: in our patriarchal society and its lopsided and unfair ways, people use power to perpetuate their own interests and maintain the status quo.\\" She also praised the series conclusion where she added that \\"The biggest surprise perhaps was that Khalil sahib allowed the lovers to reunite, however not without a near death experience\\", the series was one of Qamar's screen play where the protagonist were united and not deceased, this point attracted several viewers to it. It is the only drama to air on the famous Indian channel Star Plus.

Work  Shaffer's first experiments were with plate glass slumped over metal bars that were originally intended to be a canvas for painting. During her time in Providence, RI, Shaffer experimented further to test glass' reaction under various conditions, and how it could be manipulated and combined with other materials. The early metal forms used were predominately made using found objects such as discarded nails, spikes, brick, pulleys and wire. Instead of manipulating the glass herself, Shaffer used gravity creating natural shapes made as a result of heat being applied to glass.

Chambers, A History of Louisiana, (vol. 2) (Chicago and New York City: The American Historical Society, Inc., 1925), pp. 378-379 Pavy was born in Grand Coteau in St. Landry Parish. He attended the former St. Charles College in Grand Coteau, Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, and Tulane University School of Medicine, from which he received his M.D. degree in 1904. He practiced medicine first for many years in rural Leonville in St. Landry Parish; in 1947, he moved to Opelousas, where he remained until his death in the spring of 1962 of a two- month illness. Pavy was a past president of the St. Landry Parish School Board. A long-term member of the St. Landry Parish Police Jury, he was for seventeen years the president of that body.

History  Smyrna and its surrounding region did not come under permanent Ottoman control until 1425. The area became a sanjak within the Anatolia Eyalet until 1533, when it was transferred to the newly created Eyalet of the Archipelago. The sanjak seems not to have existed ca. 1520, however. Furthermore, Leunclavius in 1588 does not mention it, and Ayni Ali still records Suƒüla as part of the Anatolia Eyalet ca. 1600, as does Hezarfen Huseyn Efendi ca. 1680. In the 17th century, the capital of the sanjak was at S√∂ke, before being moved to Smyrna in the 18th. According to the 17th-century traveller Evliya √áelebi, it was subdivided into 13 districts (kazas): Izmir (Smyrna), Karaburun, Urla, √áesme, Sƒ±ƒüacƒ±k, Sivrihisar, Aynaabad, ƒûumaabad, Kƒ±zƒ±lhisar, Ayasluƒü, Ku≈üadasƒ±, Balat, and S√∂ke. The entire sanjak was sometimes called after Sƒ±ƒüacƒ±k, but according to Hezarfen Huseyn Efendi, it formed a separate sanjak under the Anatolia Eyalet. As part of the Tanzimat reforms, Suƒüla was transferred to the short-lived Saruhan Eyalet when it was founded (probably in 1841, certainly by 1846), and was moved to the Aydin Eyalet when Saruhan was abolished in 1847. In 1850, it was united with the capital sub-province (pasha-sanjak) of Izmir.

The mission was contracted by NASA as part of its Commercial Resupply Services program and was launched by SpaceX aboard the 30th flight of the Falcon 9 rocket. The mission ended on 19 March 2017 when the Dragon spacecraft left the ISS and safely returned to Earth. Operations history CRS-10 is part of the original order of twelve missions awarded to SpaceX under the Commercial Resupply Services contract. , a NASA Inspector General report had this mission manifested for November 2016. The launch was put on hold pending investigation of the pad explosion in September 2016, with a tentative date no earlier than January 2017, subsequently set for 18 February. Launch of CRS-10 from LC-39A On 12 February 2017, SpaceX successfully completed a static fire test of the Falcon 9 engines on Pad 39A. An initial launch attempt on 18 February 2017 was scrubbed 13 seconds before its 15:01:32 UTC launch due to a thrust vector control system issue in the rocket's second stage, resulting in a 24-hour hold for launch no earlier than 19 February at 14:39 UTC. The faulty actuator was repaired at the launch pad overnight, and the rocket was returned to vertical approximately six hours before the scheduled launch time. CRS-10 was launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 Pad A on 19 February 2017 at 14:39 UTC, the first launch from the complex since STS-135 on 8 July 2011, the last flight of the Space Shuttle program, and the first uncrewed mission from the site since the launch of the Skylab space station on 14 May 1973; this complex is also where the Apollo missions were launched. Following the successful launch, the first stage proceeded through a three-burn flyback and landed safely in Landing Zone 1, the first daytime landing of a Falcon rocket on land. The Dragon spacecraft rendezvoused with the International Space Station on 22 February, but its approach was automatically aborted by an on-board computer at 08:25 UTC when a data error was reported in its navigation system. This is the first rendezvous abort by a Dragon spacecraft. The problem was traced to an incorrect data value in the spacecraft's Global Positioning System, critical to operations as this data informs the vehicle of its relative position to the space station. The abort resulted in a 24-hour hold on its approach. The error was corrected in this time, during which the spacecraft entered a \\"racetrack\\" trajectory around the station to reset its approach. An error-free second attempt resulted in Dragon being captured by the station's Canadarm2 on 23 February at 10:44 UTC, with berthing to the Harmony module taking place a few hours later at 13:12 UTC. This abort was later revealed in a NASA Inspector General audit to have resulted from incompatibilities between NASA's and SpaceX's software development processes. The CRS-10 mission ended on 19 March 2017. The Dragon spacecraft was detached from the International Space Station by Canadarm2 on 18 March 2017 at 21:20 UTC, moved to a stow position below the station where it stayed overnight, and was released at 09:11 UTC. Dragon performed three departure burns to move it away from the station before conducting a final de-orbit burn at around 14:00 UTC. The spacecraft splashed down in the Pacific Ocean at 14:46 UTC, about southwest from Long Beach, California. Dragon returned of material from the ISS, including research samples, science and crew equipment, and spacewalking hardware. Also removed from the station was of external payload‚Äîincluding a MISSE module, the OPALS experiment, and Robotic Refueling Mission demonstration equipment‚Äîwhich was placed in Dragon's unpressurized trunk and disposed of when the trunk section burned up on re-entry. Primary payload NASA contracted the CRS-10 mission from SpaceX and therefore determined the primary payload, date/time of launch, and orbital parameters for the Dragon space capsule. CRS-10 carried a total of of cargo to the International Space Station, including of pressurized cargo including packaging and of unpressurized cargo. External payloads on the CRS-10 spacecraft are the SAGE III Earth observation experiment and its Nadir Viewing Platform (NVP), and the U.S. Department of Defense's Space Test Program Houston 5 (STP-H5) package including the Raven navigation investigation and the Lightning Imaging Sensor. Some science payloads include ACME, LMM Biophysics, ZBOT, and CIR/Cool Flames.

Count Michael Szil√°gyi in 17th century hussar uniform, The uncle of Matthias Corvinus History John Hunyadi died on 11 August 1456, less than three weeks after his greatest victory over the Ottomans in Belgrade. John's elder sonMatthias's brotherLadislaus became the head of the House of Hunyadi. John's conflict with Ulrich II, Count of Celje ended with Ulrich's capture and assassination on 9 November. Under duress, the King promised he would never take his revenge against the Hunyadis for Ulrich's killing. However, the murder turned most baronsincluding Palatine Ladislaus Garai, Judge royal Ladislaus P√°l√≥ci, and Nicholas √öjlaki, Voivode of Transylvaniaagainst Ladislaus Hunyadi. Taking advantage of their resentment, the King had the Hunyadi brothers imprisoned in Buda on 14 March 1457. The royal council condemned them to death for high treason and Ladislaus Hunyadi was beheaded on 16 March. Matthias Corvinus was held in captivity in a small house in Buda. His mother Erzs√©bet Szil√°gyi and her brother Michael Szil√°gyi founded Szil√°gyi ‚Äì Hunyadi League, and staged a rebellion against the King and occupied large territories in the regions to the east of the river Tisza. King Ladislaus fled to Vienna in mid-1457, and from Vienna to Prague in September, taking Matthias with him. The civil war between the Szil√°gyi ‚Äì Hunyadi League and the barons loyal to the monarch continued until the sudden death of the young King Ladislaus on 23 November 1457. Hereafter the Hussite Regent of BohemiaGeorge of Podƒõbradyheld Matthias captive. Ladislaus V died childless in 1457. His elder sister Anna and her husband, William III, Landgrave of Thuringia laid claim to his inheritance but received no support from the Estates. The Diet of Hungary was convoked to Pest to elect a new king in January 1458. Pope Calixtus III's legate Cardinal Juan Carvajal, who had been John Hunyadi's admirer, began openly campaigning for Matthias. The election of Matthias Corvinus as king was the only way of avoiding a protracted civil war. Ladislaus Garai was the first baron to yield. At a meeting with Michael Szil√°gyi and Erzs√©bet Szil√°gyi, he promised that he and his allies would promote Matthias's election, and Michael Szil√°gyi promised that his nephew would never seek vengeance for Ladislaus Hunyadi's execution. They also agreed that Matthias would marry the Palatine's daughter Annahis executed brother's bride. Michael Szil√°gyi arrived at the Diet with 15.000 troops, intimidating the barons who assembled in Buda. Stirred up by Szil√°gyi, the noblemen gathered on the frozen River Danube and unanimously proclaimed the 14-year-old Matthias King on 24 January. At the same time, the Diet elected Michael Szil√°gyi as Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary.

The mission was contracted by NASA and was flown by SpaceX. The mission utilized a Falcon 9 launch vehicle and was the first reuse of C106, a CRS Dragon cargo vessel that was previously flown on the CRS-4 mission. CRS-11 was the penultimate of the first twelve missions awarded to SpaceX under the Commercial Resupply Services contract to resupply the International Space Station. Rocket and spacecraft Launch of the CRS-11 mission The CRS-11 mission was the first time that a Dragon spacecraft has been reused, helping SpaceX to scale back its production line and shift focus to Dragon 2. CRS-11 launched aboard a Falcon 9 rocket on 3 June 2017 at 21:07 UTC from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A. The spacecraft rendezvoused with the station on 5 June and conducted a series of orbit adjustment burns to match speed, altitude, and orientation with the ISS. After arriving at the capture point at 13:37 UTC, the vehicle was snared at 13:52 UTC by the Canadarm2, operated by Peggy Whitson and Jack Fischer. It was berthed to the Harmony module at 16:07 UTC. The Falcon 9 first stage landed successfully on Landing Zone 1, making it the fifth successful touch down on land and the 11th overall. The CRS-11 Dragon remained attached to the ISS for just over 27 days. Having been filled with around of cargo, Dragon was unberthed from the station on 2 July 2017 at approximately 18:00 UTC. It was moved to its release position by Canadarm2, but poor sea conditions forced a delay to the following day. On 3 July at 06:41 UTC, crew members commanded Canadarm2 to release Dragon, and soon after the spacecraft began a series of thruster firings to move it away from the station. About five hours after departing from ISS, Dragon closed its GNC bay door and conducted a 10-minute deorbit burn. Immediately after, the spacecraft jettisoned its cargo trunk and oriented itself for reentry. Dragon splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off Baja California at 12:12 UTC. Payload NASA has contracted for the CRS-11 mission from SpaceX and therefore determines the primary payload, date/time of launch, and orbital parameters for the Dragon space capsule. CRS-11 carried a total of of material into orbit. This included of pressurised cargo with packaging bound for the International Space Station, and of unpressurised cargo composed of three external station experiments: NICER, MUSES and ROSA. The following is a breakdown of cargo bound for the ISS: * Science investigations: ** Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) - a NASA- and ORBITEC-developed payload built in Madison, Wisconsin. APH is a fully automated facility that is used to conduct plant bioscience research on the ISS. * Crew supplies: * Vehicle hardware: * Spacewalk equipment: * Computer resources: * External payloads: ** Roll Out Solar Array (ROSA): ** Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER): ** Multiple User System for Earth Sensing (MUSES): A constellation of five CubeSats was also carried on the mission as part of Birds-1, one each from the countries of Japan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Ghana, and Mongolia. The satellites from Bangladesh (BRAC ONNESHA), Ghana (GhanaSat-1), and Mongolia (Mazaalai) were those countries' first satellites in space.

The name of Brianda Pereira was mythologized by the Romantic movement at the end of the 19th century, who was elevated to the status of heroine by the Estado Novo regime, affirming Portuguese nationalism. She became a popular figure and used as a protagonist of various theatre folk plays, songs and dances/marches during Carnaval, in addition to being adopted as a matron of various institutions. Biography The monument to the Battle of Salga Brianda Pereira was born in the municipality of Angra do Hero√≠smo (although there is debate as to whether specifically the city, Porto Judeu and S√£o Sebasti√£o), daughter of √Ålvaro Anes de Alenquer and Maria Pereira de Sousa. Her father was a simple judge in the C√¢mara de Angra in 1553 and, a descendant of Pero Anes de Alenquer and his wife, one of the first colonists and nobles to the island of Terceira. She married Bartolomeu Louren√ßo, and began living in the valley of Salga, along the coastal area in the village of S√£o Sebasti√£o, where the couple had lands and agricultural estate. They resided there when on 25 July 1581, supporters of Phillip II and D. Ant√≥nio I battled along the Bay of Salga, where they had their home. =Battle of Salga= The battle began when Spanish forces landed on the beach, and immediately began burning crops and local homes, likely including the residence of Bartolomeu Louren√ßo and Brianda Pereira. Her husband was injured in the attack and made prisoner. Little is written of the role of Brianda Pereira, except by √Çngela Pereira (Brianda had a sister who had this name), an anonymous author who wrote: :There lived there one Bartolomeu Louren√ßo with wife and children; a woman walked in body, being noble woman and girl, and her husband, rich farmer among the people of the land, who had escaped the hands of them [the Spanish soldiers] looking after her husband...The poor woman was crazy, and armed soldiers had taken possession of her home and all their possessions. Having seen her house burnt down and husband imprisoned and hurt, and her factory in the hands of soldiers, she escaped. She began encouraging the Portuguese to war, and as a young, noblewoman and honourable, she did not want to gather with other women in the Church of S√£o Jo√£o. It was from this description, even as the accounts of Friar Pedro de Frias did not mention them, that the mythification of the heroine began. The construction of the myth was attributed to Francisco Ferreira Drummond, whose Anais da Ilha Terceira reinforced the oral tradition of his native home: :...where it was found, and still exists, the estate, or house, of Bartolomeu Louren√ßo, landed gentry, where he lived with his wife Brianda Pereira, noblewoman and beautiful girl, with whom he had children. It seems her beauty in the early years was a curiosity to the Castilians, because hers was the first prey that they wanted to sack from her house. Happily, this new Lucrecia escaped the hands of the proud Tarquins that intended to take her, her son and husband as prisoners (who was seriously injured). ; Finding themselves already masters of the house, and all that was therein, they pillaged, destroyed and convulsed to their will the furniture, finally setting the wheat in the thrashing circle. It is believed that Brianda Pereira was the author of the strategy to send a stampede of cattle towards Castilian troops. Jos√© Joaquim Pinheiro, in his √âpocas Memor√°veis da Ilha Terceira, referred to Brianda Pereira: :...showed her manly spirit, she armed the women who had gone to war with their husbands and children, persuading them with arguments of a virtuous wife and mother unveiled the Terceira people, took their gender to carry on against their enemy with such boldness that would attain salvation of their elder prisoner and son, both quite wounded. But, this heroic Spartan could not avoid the fire that was raging in the house and in the floor... The final act of the glorification of Brianda Pereira came from the writer Gerv√°sio Lima, who in his inflamed prose stocked the fires of virtude and heroic nationalism. Lima's writings, which were popular in the 20th century, was used heavily in the machinations of the Estado Novo regime, to amplify the heroicness of its inhabitants and neighbour sentiments.

The medium from which a given phenomenon originated is either irrelevant or impossible to determine; it is not an adaptation of a phenomenon from one medium to another.Wolf, Werner (2015). ‚ÄúLiterature and Music: Theory.‚Äù In: Gabriele Rippl, ed. Handbook of Intermediality. Literature ‚Äì Image ‚Äì Sound ‚Äì Music. Berlin: De Gruyter. 459-474. Thon, Jan-No√´l (2015). ‚ÄùNarratives across Media and the Outlines of a Media-Conscious Narratology.‚Äù In: Gabriele Rippl, ed. Handbook of Intermediality. Literature ‚Äì Image ‚Äì Sound ‚Äì Music. Berlin: De Gruyter. 439-456.  History of the term  The term transmediality was first used in this sense by Irina O. Rajewsky in her publication Intermedialit√§t (2002) and defined as \\"medienunspezifische Ph√§nomene, die in verschiedenen Medien mit den dem jeweiligen Medium eigenen Mitteln ausgetragen werden k√∂nnen, ohne dass hierbei die Annahme eines kontaktgebenden Ursprungsmediums wichtig oder m√∂glich ist.\\" In her theory, the concept of transmediality is differentiated from the two opposing concepts of intramediality and intermediality. She defines intramediality as the quality of phenomena which occur only within one medium, while intermediality describes the quality of phenomena which can move in between two or more media, that is, which transgress media boundaries. The important distinction between intermedial and transmedial phenomena is that an intermedial phenomenon has a clear origin medium, while a transmedial phenomenon does not, it is non-media specific. Werner Wolf adopted Rajewsky‚Äôs term transmediality in his intermediality theory and defined it similarly, saying that transmediality ‚Äúconcerns phenomena that appear in more than one medium without being (viewed as) specific to, or having an origin in, any of them.\\"Wolf, Werner (2015). ‚ÄúLiterature and Music: Theory.‚Äù In: Gabriele Rippl, ed. Handbook of Intermediality. Literature ‚Äì Image ‚Äì Sound ‚Äì Music. Berlin: De Gruyter. 461. The difference is that in his approach, transmediality is defined as a subcategory of intermediality, next to intermedial transposition (e.g. film adaptation of a novel), intermedial reference (e.g. imitating film in a novel) and plurimediality (e.g. graphic novels). It is therefore not a separate and opposing concept, but a kind of extracompositional intermediality, that is, relations between media that involve more than one work or composition.Wolf, Werner (2015). ‚ÄúLiterature and Music: Theory.‚Äù In: Gabriele Rippl, ed. Handbook of Intermediality. Literature ‚Äì Image ‚Äì Sound ‚Äì Music. Berlin: De Gruyter. 459-474.  Examples  The quality of transmediality applies to a great variety of different phenomena. Transmedial phenomena can occur on the content level, for instance in the form of myths or legends that have become part of a culture and lost their connection to any specific medium. They can also be formal devices that are present in various media, or characteristic aesthetics and traits of a given historical period.Wolf, Werner (2011). ‚Äù(Inter)mediality and the Study of Literature.‚Äù CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture, Vol. 13, No. 3. = Vampires = The vampire is a mythical creature that frequently appears in many different media nowadays, such as literature (e.g. Interview With the Vampire), film (e.g. Dark Shadows), TV series (e.g. Buffy the Vampire Slayer), or comic books (e.g. American Vampire). The vampires in these stories are not adapted from one story in a specific medium; the vampire myth has become common cultural knowledge. Although the vampire myth can be traced back to south-eastern European legends, and Bram Stoker‚Äôs Dracula has greatly influenced the modern idea of the vampire, the vampire myth is not connected to or adapted from one specific source medium anymore and can therefore be considered transmedial. = Narrativity = A basic formal device and mode of representation which is clearly transmedial is narrativity.Wolf, Werner (2011). ‚Äù(Inter)mediality and the Study of Literature.‚Äù CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture, Vol. 13, No. 3. Humans permanently use narratives to express themselves, and therefore, narratives can not only be found in obviously narrative media such as literature or film, but also, to a certain extent, in paintings or even music. = Characteristic traits of eighteenth- century sensibility = The culture of sensibility had a great impact on Western Europe in the eighteenth century, and its characteristic traits, most importantly the celebration and expression of emotions such as love, care, and pity, can be seen in different kinds of media and are not connected to any specific medium.Wolf, Werner (2011). ‚Äù(Inter)mediality and the Study of Literature.‚Äù CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture, Vol. 13, No. 3. Some examples are fiction (e.g. Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded by Samuel Richardson), drama (e.g. The Conscious Lovers by Richard Steele), painting (e.g. Le Fils Ingrat by Jean-Baptiste Greuze) or music (e.g. Carl Philip Emanuel Bach).  Other uses of the term  In narratology and new media studies, the term transmediality is frequently used to refer to the concept of transmedia storytelling, which was coined by Henry Jenkins in 2006. Transmedia storytelling is the technique of unfolding a story across multiple media platforms, ‚Äúwith each new text making a distinctive and valuable contribution to the whole.‚ÄùJenkins, Henry (2006). Convergence Culture. New York, London: New York University Press. This is often done, for instance, by extending the story of a film in a computer game or TV series. Less frequently, the term transmediality is also simply defined as ‚Äùthe state of being represented in multiple media.‚ÄùWolf, Mark J. P. (2012). Building Imaginary Worlds: The Theory and History of Subcreation. New York: Routledge. By this definition, any content which occurs in more than one medium is transmedial, which includes adaptations. For some scholars, the term expresses the process of the transfer of content from an origin medium to a target medium, the transition from one media specific expression to another.Simanowski, Roberto (2006). ‚ÄúTransmedialit√§t als Kennzeichen moderner Kunst.‚Äú In: Urs Meyer, Roberto Simanowski and Christoph Zeller, eds.

This enabled her to study with Frank Brangwyn, a figure painter in London, for a year, and to travel to Holland, France, and Italy. Other teachers included Elliott Daingerfield and Henry B. Snell. In November 1910, she married John Reagan Cartwright in El Paso, Texas. They moved to Terrell, Texas until her husband's death in 1917. She went on to have one-woman art shows in San Antonio and Fort Worth, Texas. After her Texas period, Isabel Cartwright returned to Philadelphia where she joined the Philadelphia Ten. Considered one of the mainstays of the group, she exhibited in all sixty-five shows that it held, over a twenty-eight year span from 1917 to 1945. Cartwright had a house in the 1940s on Monhegan Island, off the coast of Maine, where she liked to paint. She exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1921-1943), and at the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors.

Working predominantly in drawing, performance, and video, Kim's practice considers how sound operates in society. Musical notation, written language, American Sign Language (ASL), and the use of the body are all recurring elements in her work. Her work has been exhibited in major cultural institutions internationally, including in the Museum of Modern Art's first exhibition about sound in 2013 and the Whitney Biennial in 2019. She was named a TED Fellow in both 2013 and 2015 and a Director's Fellow at MIT Media Lab in 2015. Background and education Christine Sun Kim was born in 1980 and raised in Southern California with hearing parents and a deaf sister. She has been profoundly deaf since birth. She attended University High School in Irvine, California and graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology in 2002 with a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. She has a Master of Fine Arts in Visual Art from the School of Visual Arts in New York, and another in Sound and Music from Bard College.  Art  Kim investigates the operations of sound and various aspects of Deaf culture in her performances, videos, and drawings. In developing her personal visual language, Kim draws from a variety of information systems. She uses elements from these systems such as body language, American Sign Language (ASL), musical and graphic notation, and language interpretation, inventing new structures for her compositions and extending each source's scope of communication. She further uses sound to explore her own relationship to verbal languages and her environment. Through her work, she gains control of voice and sound, seeking to release them from social conventions. In 2020, she performed at Super Bowl LIV, representing the non-hearing community in what has become an annual partnership between the National Football League (NFL) and the National Association of the Deaf (NAD). She later penned an op-ed in The New York Times criticizing Fox Sports for cutting away during her American Sign Language performances of \\"America the Beautiful\\" and the national anthem.  Artworks  Kim uses sound to explore her feelings in a unique way, as writer Molly Hannon addresses. Kim‚Äôs series of drawing, ‚ÄúThe Sound of, ‚Äù was exhibited at Rubin Museum of Art. ‚ÄúIt all goes back to my experience watching the film, Kumiko, The Treasure Hunter.‚Äù said Kim. Even though there was not much dialogue, she was fascinated by how detailed and descriptive the captions of the movie were. She started to wonder if she was able to portray the sound of intangible objects like emotions or senses. This has become the essential reason she created this series. She takes traditional music dynamics and refashions them into music notes. In one of her drawings, The Sound of Obsessing, Kim uses the symbol ‚Äúp‚Äù to represent the sound of piano and indicate the note is played quietly. As more ‚Äúp‚Äù appears, the notes are played more quietly. Kim concretizes abstract ideas. She believes that obsession has a repetitive pattern and can take up a person‚Äôs mind. She illustrates this pattern with the ‚Äúp‚Äùs. ‚ÄúAs time goes on, the obsession quickens, represented by the shrinking distance of p‚Äôs. Finally, at the end, the p‚Äôs are crowded and your mind is racing non-stop. You become totally engrossed with your obsession.‚Äù  Solo exhibitions, performances and projects  * Calibration Room and Bounce House, University of Texas at Austin Visual Arts Center, March‚ÄìApril 2015. * Nap Disturbance, performance, Frieze London, October 6‚Äì9, 2016.

It was founded on 2011, admitting 80 students from all over the province who passed the Quezon Science High School Admission Test (QSHSAT) provided with complete scholarship offering free tuition fees, board and lodging, foods, uniforms, and other miscellaneous school fees.  History  The building of the Quezon Science High School, which was constructed during Quezon Governor Rafael Nantes' administration, was originally intended to be a science museum but according to Governor David Suarez such plans were dropped due to fiercer competition from other museums based in Metro Manila. In 2010, Gloria Potes, Division of Quezon's then School Division Superintendent, made a suggestion to Suarez to convert the building to a science high school. The building was also planned to be converted to a call center facility but the plan likewise didn't push through due to lack of local manpower. The proposal was accepted since Quezon was the only province in the Calabarzon region not to have a science high school at that time. The school was inaugurated in August 17, 2011. QSHS held its first commencement ceremony last March 2015, having 71 students graduating. The first moving-up ceremony (having been influenced with the K-12 Educational Curriculum Program, which induces the Senior High School program  Sections  As the 80 students are divided into two for each class to have 40 students each, they will be assigned to a section according to how well they did at the QSHAT (homogeneous, former way used) or they will be assigned randomly (heterogenous, current). In addition to the school's science relation where the education uses STEM‚Äìbased curriculum (Science, Technology, English and Mathematics), the school uses stars as the name of the sections. * Grade 7 - Pollux & Vega * Grade 8 - Rigel & Altair * Grade 9 - Polaris & Sirius * Grade 10 - Betelgeuse & Antares * Grade 11 - Andromeda & Pegasus * Grade 12 - Perseus  Facilities  The school has facilities such as an E-library, two computer laboratories, a chemistry laboratory and a speech laboratory. It has six main classrooms, four on the second floor and the rest on the third. The first floor consists of the director's and secretary's offices, the chemistry lab, one of the two computer labs, the cafeteria, the activity area and the main faculty office (there are two more faculty offices, one in each of the higher floors). The second consists of the library, the speech lab and the other computer lab and the clinic. The third floor was a makeshift dormitory before the other one was erected, it has a wide space and is sometimes considered another activity area.  Dormitory  The dormitory It now has its own three-story dormitory, a project of Governor Suarez, boarding all the priority students from all over the province. The former dormitory is located at the third floor of the main building. It was officially opened in November 2014.  The Garden of Knowledge  On August 10, 2015, the Garden of Knowledge was inaugurated and blessed. It features plants, some only found in Quezon Province, essential for the students knowledge in Agricultural Science. It was a project by Governor Suarez once again, alongside his wife.  Senior High School  Senior High in Quezon Science High School is closed to outsiders; meaning only students who passed the QSHSAT and studied in QSHS starting Grade 7 are allowed to take SHS in QSHS. In the beginning of SY 2016-2017, QSHS formally implemented Senior High School with the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) Academic Strand for its first batch of Grade 11 students.

Kolbowski works primarily with video and installation formats, as well as photography, often using historical figures and events to analyze cultural phenomena and power imbalances. Her project \\"an inadequate history of conceptual art,\\" (2000) presents anonymous recollections of unnamed conceptual artworks spoken by 22 artists. Her video projects on Ulrike Meinhof and Rosa Luxemburg reanimate historical figures who speak to contemporary issues of violence and political resistance. Her works are also informed by aspects of feminist and psychoanalytic theory. For example, in an early series, Model Pleasure (1982), Kolbowski appropriates images of women from mass-media sources to create grids of images that make allusions to the ways that women are defined by media.Whitney, Chadwick, Women, Art, and Society, fourth edition, p401 Her work has been exhibited in The Tapei Biennial, the Villa Arson (Nice), the Whitney Biennial, and the Hammer Museum, and others. She has had solo exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art (Ljubljana), the Center for Contemporary Art (Warsaw), The Secession (Vienna), LAX<>ART (Los Angeles), and the Bina Ellen Gallery (Montreal).

Covering an area of 35 acres it is one of the largest urban public parks in Ireland. It is located in the heart of Tralee off Denny Street and adjacent to the Kerry County Museum. It is also the home of Ireland's National Folk Theatre Siamsa T√≠re. History The park is situated on the site of the old castle demesne which was built by the Denny family in the 17th and 18th Century. In 1826 the castle was demolished to make way for the construction of Denny Street. Edward Denny subsequently landscaped the area remaining from the castle by planting trees, laying down gravel paths and constructing an ornamental grotto. A gatekeeper‚Äôs lodge was also built on \\"The Green\\". In 1889 Edward died and the Denny family sold \\"The Green\\" to Henry Clements-Finnerty. Around this time \\"The Green\\" was offered to the Town Commissioners but they refused to purchase the park. Subsequently fencing and gates were erected around the park's perimeter (still seen to this day) and a charge to the public for admission into the park was introduced. In 1922 \\"The Green\\" was sold to Tralee Urban District Council and it officially became Tralee Town Park. Layout The park is famous for its Rose Garden and Garden of the Senses which have won numerous awards. The Rose Garden has been a feature of the park since 1987 and contains 35 varieties of roses over a 3 acre site. The Rose Wall contains the names of every Rose who has contested the Rose of Tralee Festival since 1959.http://blog.roseoftralee.ie/rose-wall- of-honour/ The Garden of the Senses was designed to appeal to the five senses and to be inviting to all members of society. The project was inspired by Soroptimist International Tralee & District, under its then President Maura Baily, in 2000. The garden places strong emphasis on ancient Hanley history of Ireland.http://www.discoverireland.ie/Arts-Culture-Heritage/garden-of-the- senses/70956 Monuments A statue commemorating the original Rose of Tralee Mary O'Connor who was immortalised in the famous ballad by William Pembroke Mulchinock, was unveiled in August 2009. The life size bronze statue, commissioned by Tralee Town Council as part of the 50th anniversary of the Rose of Tralee Festival and sculpted by renowned Irish sculptor Jeanne Rynhart is located in the park's famous Rose Garden.

The remembrance stone was unveiled by her daughter, Jean Kennedy Smith, United States Ambassador to Ireland in August 1995. The old lady, who died at the age of 105, left behind a message of fortitude which is recorded on the plinth: \\"I find it interesting to reflect on what has made my life, even with its moments of pain, an essentially happy one.

She later studied for a year at Mary Baldwin Seminary, the National Academy of Design Antique School, and the New York School of Fine and Applied Art. Saussy's work includes landscapes and portraiture. It can be found in several Southeastern museums such as the Columbus Museum, the High Museum of Art, the Telfair Museum, the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, and the Spartanburg Art Museum.  Early life  Saussy was born to Rachel Louise Shivers and Joachim Radcliffe Saussy III on March 17, 1890 and was their only child to live to advanced age. She was introduced to art and painting in her fifth grade public school, and went on to take private lessons. Saussy left Savannah after high school for college at the Mary Baldwin College in Virginia. This is where her passion for art really took off. Saussy left Baldwin after one year and moved to New York with her mother.

She is known as the \\"Weld Angel\\" for her protests on behalf of old growth forest in the Weld Valley. Early life Beltran grew up on the Central Coast of New South Wales and completed her degree in Contemporary Fine Art at Sydney College of the Arts. She specialised in Sculpture, Performance and Installation Art.  Work  Beltran has worked with community groups to create art which raises environmental awareness. The Chain Valley Bay Eco-Arts garden was a community artwork coordinated by the Wyong Neighbourhood Centre Creative Connections project. Beltran has produced two documentary films, Whatever you love you are and Since the Weld was Flooded, about activists in Tasmania's Southern Forests. Weld Angel incident In November 2006, Beltran participated in a long-term protest against logging of old growth forest in the Weld Valley Activists had for some time accused Forestry Tasmania of allowing illegal logging practices to occur in World Heritage-valued forests. By March, most of her fellow protesters had been arrested. On March 29, Beltran, dressed as an angel and suspended off the ground on a tripod, blocked an entrance to the forest. Her protest was considered peaceful. Though ordered down by police, Beltran blocked the loggers' advance for over nine hours before her eventual arrest. Due to the widespread use of her image in regional media coverage of old growth logging, she has been described as \\"the face of forestry protests in 2008\\". As a piece of performance art, the protest has been held up as an early example of the participatory culture of social media. Beltran has continued to use the image of the angel to try to influence politicians in the Parliament to pay more attention to environmental issues. In 2007, Beltran was sued for police wage costs of $2870, and $6198 in lost revenue for the state timber agency. Police and foresters ultimately failed in their suit, and no damages were awarded. Green politicians supported Beltran, citing that the police and forestry action was \\"interfering in the political process\\" in which protests are a \\"legitimate form of activity in a free country.\\"  Further reading  References  External links  * Official Website * Weld Angel (video) Category:Living people Category:Australian environmentalists Category:Australian women environmentalists Category:Australian performance artists Category:Australian contemporary artists Category:Australian women artists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Allana Beltran"},{"id":"45605620","text":"The Assam Chronicle is an English language newspaper published from Guwahati, Assam, India.

According to John Mugubi of Kenyatta University, \\"The uniqueness and power of Rebeka‚Äôs style cannot be understated.

She published her first work, the book Le Pavillon des enfants fous, in 1978 after spending four months confined to a psychiatric hospital for anorexia nervosa. The book is an autobiographical account covering her relationship with her abusive parents, experiences as a child in French society, and in particular her institutionalized years. Critics praised her style of writing and her expressive, philosophically sophisticated articulations of systemic mistreatment and misunderstanding. Scholar Richard A. Mazzara likens her work to Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Hermann Hesse, Andr√© Gide, and Virginia Woolf. Life Val√©rie Samama was born in the 15th arrondissement of Paris to a family of Tunisian origin. At age 13, after a family shock, she was committed to a psychiatric hospital for anorexia nervosa.

Premature heart beats come in two different types, premature atrial contractions and premature ventricular contractions. Often they cause no symptoms but may present with fluttering in the chest or a skipped beat. Typically have no long term complications. They most often happen naturally but may be associated with caffeine, nicotine, or stress. Usually no treatment is needed. They are the most common arrhythmia. Physiopathology The normal heart contraction comes from a cyclic membrane depolarization (reversal of the electrical polarity of the cell membrane) of a group of cells located on the upper part of the right atrium, the sinoatrial node. This depolarization spreads to the whole heart and causes muscle cells to contract. It is followed by a \\"refractory period\\", a short time when the cells are no longer stimulable. The heart rate is controlled by this node.  Diagnosis  Premature heart beat revealed by laser Doppler imaging by digital holography of the eye fundus Premature heart beat revealed by blood flow pulse wave in the central retinal artery (red) and vein (blue) by laser Doppler imaging. Premature heart beats can be asymptomatic (the patient does not complain about anything). The subject may experience palpitations, a feeling of cardiac \\"pause\\". Taking (prolonged) pulse may result in a rhythm that seems irregular. Electrocardiography and laser Doppler imaging allow to visualize Premature heart beats. From their appearance, their location can be assessed. The Holter monitor allows to quantify them, to specify their characteristics and their repetition.

Lindstrom (born March 23, 1981) is a politician from the state of Nebraska in the Midwestern United States. In 2012, he unsuccessfully ran for a Nebraska seat in the U.S. Congress, losing to incumbent Lee Terry in the Republican primary election. In 2014, he was elected to the Nebraska Legislature, representing an Omaha district. Personal life and professional career Lindstrom was born March 23, 1981, in Lincoln, Nebraska. He was raised in Omaha, where he graduated from Millard West High School in 1999. He attended the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln, graduating in 2004 with a B.S. in history. At the university, he joined the Nebraska Cornhuskers football team as a walk-on, playing in five games as a back-up quarterback. Lindstrom returned to Omaha, where he worked with his father, Dan Lindstrom, as a financial advisor. In 2007, he married Leigh Ancona; the couple produced three children. 2012 Congressional election In 2012, Lindstrom made his first bid for elective office, running for Nebraska's 2nd District seat in the U.S. Congress. He was one of four Republicans challenging the incumbent, Republican Lee Terry; the others were railroad worker Paul Anderson; Glenn Freeman, a onetime Douglas County Republican chairman; and Jack Heidel, chairman of the mathematics department at the University of Nebraska Omaha. In his campaign, Lindstrom accused Terry of lacking commitment to conservative principles. He took Terry to task for voting for an increase in the United States debt ceiling without demanding a balanced budget amendment in return; and he condemned Terry's efforts to speed approval of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, calling Terry \\"unequivocally beholden to corporate lobbyists and special interests\\" and accusing him of defending \\"corporate special interests over the Nebraska taxpayer\\" In debate, Terry counterattacked, declaring that a Lindstrom press release on the pipeline \\"sounded like it came from the Democratic Party\\". Lindstrom led the challengers in fundraising, although his receipts were an order of magnitude less than Terry's. Terry won the Republican primary election with 60.0% of the vote; Lindstrom came in second, with 22.8%, trailed by Heidel with 11.0%, Freeman with 3.9%, and Anderson with 2.2%. Terry went on to win the general election, defeating the Democrats' candidate, Douglas County treasurer John Ewing, by a margin of 50.8%‚Äì49.2%. Nebraska legislature =2014 election= In 2014, Lindstrom ran for the Nebraska Legislature from the 18th District in northwestern Omaha. Incumbent Scott Lautenbaugh, a Republican, was ineligible to seek re-election under Nebraska's term-limits law. Four candidates sought the position. Lindstrom, a Republican, described himself as a fiscal conservative. Chad Adams, a carpenter, called himself a \\"blue-collar, small-government Republican with libertarian leanings\\". Mike Tesar, a retired Omaha chief deputy prosecutor, had been a Democrat for most of his life, but had re-registered as an independent in 2013; he condemned the Legislature's recent decision not to expand Medicaid under the provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Joe Vaughn, a chef, stated that he was running as an independent to allow voters to choose someone who was not a member of one of the two major parties, declaring that both were corrupt and represented \\"the special interests and wealthy donors\\"; he had unsuccessfully attempted to gather enough signatures to run as an independent in the 2012 2nd District congressional election. In the nonpartisan primary election, Lindstrom placed first, with 1689 votes, or 45.8% of the total. Tesar came in second, with 1301 votes (35.2%). Vaughn and Adams trailed, with 449 votes (12.2%) and 252 votes (6.8%) respectively. As the top two vote-getters, Lindstrom and Tesar moved on to the general election, in which taxes figured as a major issue. Lindstrom, calling himself \\"a committed fiscal conservative\\", stated that he would work to eliminate the state's income tax, particularly the tax on income from Social Security, and the state's inheritance tax. Tesar called the elimination of many of these taxes impractical, stating that a certain level of taxation was necessary to maintain essential services, among which he included medical care and health insurance for all, an educational system that would enable graduates to obtain good jobs, adequate law enforcement, and alcohol- and drug-treatment programs in prisons. In the course of the campaign, the Lindstrom organization received about $70,000 in cash and in-kind contributions, and spent about $81,000. Major donors to his campaign included groups representing Nebraska bankers and members of the National Association of Realtors. He received endorsements from Nebraska governor Dave Heineman, from Omaha mayor Jean Stothert, and from incumbent Lautenbaugh. Tesar received about $71,000, and spent the same amount; this included over $32,000 from the Nebraska State Education Association and $6,000 from the Nebraska Association of Trial Attorneys. When the election was held, Lindstrom won the seat, with 4907 votes, or 54.9% of the total; Tesar garnered 4031 votes, or 45.1%. =Legislative tenure= 2015 session In the 2015 session of the Legislature, Lindstrom was appointed to the Banking, Commerce, and Insurance Committee, and to the Natural Resources Committee. He ran for the chair of the Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee, in defiance of an unwritten rule under which freshman legislators did not run for leadership posts, losing by a 24‚Äì25 vote to incumbent Jeremy Nordquist. The closeness of the vote was attributed in part to the influx of conservative senators after the 2014 election; Nordquist, a Democrat, had supported the Affordable Care Act and the proposal to expand Medicaid in Nebraska thereunder, and a 2014 referendum that increased the state's minimum wage. Among the \\"most significant\\" actions taken by the Legislature in its 2015 session were three bills that passed over vetoes by governor Pete Ricketts. LB268 repealed the state's death penalty; LB623 reversed the state's previous policy of denying driver's licenses to people who were living illegally in the United States after being brought to the country as children, and who had been granted exemption from deportation under the Barack Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program; and LB610 increased the tax on gasoline to pay for repairs to roads and bridges. Lindstrom voted in favor of the death-penalty repeal, and to override Ricketts's veto of the measure; he voted against passage of LB623, and to sustain the gubernatorial veto; and voted in favor of the gas-tax increase, and to override the veto. 2016 session In its 2016 session, the Nebraska legislature passed three bills that Ricketts then vetoed. LB580 would have created an independent commission of citizens to draw new district maps following censuses; supporters described it as an attempt to de- politicize the redistricting process, while Ricketts maintained that the bill delegated the legislature's constitutional duty of redistricting to \\"an unelected and unaccountable board\\". Lindstrom voted against the bill in its 29-15 passage. Sponsor John Murante opted not to seek an override of the governor's veto. A second vetoed bill, LB935, would have changed state audit procedures. The bill passed by a margin of 37-8, with 4 present and not voting; Lindstrom was among those voting in favor. The bill was withdrawn without an attempt to override the veto; the state auditor agreed to work with the governor on a new version for the next year's session. A third bill passed over Ricketts's veto. LB947 made DACA beneficiaries eligible for commercial and professional licenses in Nebraska. The bill passed the Legislature on a vote of 33-11-5; the veto override passed 31-13-5\\\\. Lindstrom voted for the bill, and for the override of Ricketts's veto. The legislature failed to pass LB10, greatly desired by the Republican Party, which would have restored Nebraska to a winner-take-all scheme of allocating its electoral votes in U.S. presidential elections, rather than continuing its practice of awarding the electoral vote for each congressional district to the candidate who received the most votes in that district. Supporters were unable to break a filibuster; in the 32-17 cloture motion, Lindstrom was among those who voted in favor of the bill.

She is one of a small group of groundbreaking women, including Alice Aycock, Jackie Ferrara and Mary Miss, who pushed sculpture toward the domain of architecture in the early 1970s. ‚ÄúWhen Donna Dennis created her earnest, plain-spoken Tourist Cabins at the outset of her career,‚Äù writes Deborah Everett in Sculpture Magazine, ‚Äúthey had the impact of cultural icons.‚Äù Drawing from overlooked fragments of rural and urban vernacular American architecture‚Äîtourist cabins, hotels, subway stations, roller coasters‚ÄîDennis represents stopping places on the journey through life. Dennis lived and worked in Manhattan in a Tribeca loft from 1973-2019. She now lives and works in Germantown, New York. Early life Dennis went to public school in Ohio and Washington D.C. before her family moved to Rye, New York in 1949. From a young age, Dennis loved drawing. She remembers drawing half a house in the first grade and insisting to her teacher that the other half was invisible. Her childhood experience making tree houses and forts also informed her later work. She went to Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, where she majored in studio art and focused on painting. After college, Dennis went to Paris with friend and classmate Martha Diamond to study at Roger Barr's program at the American Center in Paris. During her time in Paris, which was not yet fully rebuilt after WWII, Dennis came to appreciate the ways a building could tell a story through layers of paint and centuries-old alterations revealed. When she moved back to New York in the late 1960s, Dennis worked at the Whitney Museum as a secretary in the fundraising department. By night, Dennis attended classes at the Art Students League. Through Peter Schjeldahl, a Carleton classmate, she met poet Ted Berrigan, who became her mentor and romantic interest. In the late 1960s, she turned from painting to three-dimensional work. 1970s Dennis began making painted hotel facades, which she thought of as shaped canvases, in the early 1970s. In 1973, she had her first solo show, Hotels, at West Broadway Gallery in New York. Inspired by painters such as Hopper, De Chirico, Matisse, Magritte, Burchfield, and Dine, and photographers such as Eugene Atget, Walker Evans, Berenice Abbott, and Wright Morris, these three-dimensional, false-front works were a stepping point beyond Dennis‚Äôs earlier paintings. Dennis placed the hotels so they all faced forward and installed theatrical lighting and summer night sounds to create a tropical setting, making this an early example of installation art. \\"So much has been lost to the world in dismissing the gifts of, and the voices of, women. I wanted to be a part of discovering and bringing that voice to the fore and making sure it would never again be lost or silenced .... My work is a lot about getting people to find beauty in places they might have overlooked or dismissed, just as women's lives have been overlooked and dismissed.\\" Dennis's first subway work, 'Station Hotel', 1973-4 was included with the hotel works. Dennis recalls being on a subway platform when she noticed a door, For Dennis, descending into the subway opened up an underground world of travel, infinite possibilities, and unknown, distant destinations. 'Station Hotel' features tile-patterned painted walls and two light sources: a fluorescent tube outside the doorway and an incandescent light inside. Dennis submitted 'Station Hotel' for a New York Creative Artists Public Service grant and won in the category of painting. 'Subway with Lighted Interior', completed in 1975, was Dennis's first freestanding sculpture. Moving away from the false front hotels, Dennis began making work with interior space, reflecting not only her own growing sense of empowerment, but that of women more broadly. 'Subway with Lighted Interior' features a small doorway over three steps, one with a vent embedded into it, implying a tunnel below. 'Subway with Lighted Interior' was also Dennis's first work that included elements that resembled rivets and steel columns, though the work is made of wood and masonite. She carried the subway‚Äôs industrial architecture into some later works as well. Dennis's 'Subway with Yellow and Blue' (1975) was also a freestanding, three-dimensional structure. According to Dennis: Building these new more complex structural works presented its challenges to Dennis, yet she was resourceful in finding materials and teaching herself carpentry skills. At this time, Dennis began turning to her own experiences as a source for her work. She remembered family road trips and the nightly ritual of looking for a place to stay. She was also looking closely at Walker Evans photographs, including ‚ÄúCottage at Ossining Camp.‚Äù Dennis traveled to Maine to photograph tourist cabins, which inspired 'Tourist Cabin Porch (Maine)'. The work features a small porch, standing only tall. Inside the porch, which glows softly from within, a door and window are visible, with light softly glowing from within. There is no door from the porch to the outside, which is not immediately noticeable. This type of tourist cabin is reminiscent of a time when automobile ownership became common for middle class families. Taking to the roads, they sought overnight accommodations along the way. In 1975, the prominent art collector Holly Solomon, introduced to Dennis by Denise Green, opened her gallery at 392 West Broadway in Soho and invited Dennis to show her work there. Dennis exhibited Tourist Cabins and Subway Stations at Holly Solomon Gallery in 1976, including 'Tourist Cabin Porch (Maine)' and 'Tourist Cabin Pensacola'. 'Two Stories with Porch (for Robert Cobuzio)' was inspired by a small building, built as a toll booth, which stood at the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, and a rowhouse in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, photographed by George A. Tice. The work is dedicated to Dennis‚Äôs friend, Robert Cobuzio, who died while she was making the work. The piece was exhibited at the Whitney Biennial in 1979 and at Holly Solomon Gallery in 1980, alongside 'Tunnel Tower' (1979-80), which combined vernacular architecture such as that of a White Castle hamburger stand and the fantasy of a tower or fortress. 1980s In 'Subway with Silver Girders' (1981-82), Dennis expanded her exploration of subways to incorporate the train track. Dennis created an opposition between the platform, which she thought of as public and male, and the private or female track, representing infinitely expanding possibilities as it moved away from the platform. The work was exhibited at Holly Solomon gallery in 1983 alongside 'Skowhegan Stairway' (1982-83), which was inspired by a covered stairway on the side of a two-story frame building in downtown Skowhegan, Maine. 'Deep Station' (1981-85), exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum in 1987, is the last in Dennis‚Äôs series of subway sculptures. Inspired by a number of subway stations in New York as well as the Roman Forum, the subway provided a metaphorical space to explore aspects of human experience and the subconscious. Deeply affected by the second-wave feminist movement, Dennis imagined 'Deep Station' to be a place in the center of the earth where the tectonic plates were realigning, representing a shift of consciousness on a large scale. 'Moccasin Creek Cabins' (1983) was a temporary outdoor installation in Aberdeen, South Dakota, where Dennis‚Äôs tourist-cabin inspired sculptures were afloat on the Moccasin Creek. 1990s 'BLUE BRIDGE/red shift' (1991-93), exhibited at the Sculpture Center in 1993, was inspired by three lift bridges that run side by side over New Jersey‚Äôs Hackensack River. The work is dedicated to Dennis‚Äôs mother, who died while Dennis was completing the work. 'Cataract Cabin' (1994) takes its title from Jane Bowles‚Äôs short story, ‚ÄúCamp Cataract,‚Äù set on a precipice above a roaring waterfall. The piece was inspired by a tourist cabin in New Hampshire perched on a giant rock and configured to accommodate its unlikely pedestal. 2000s 'Coney Night Maze' (1996-2013) is Dennis's largest piece to date, at 12¬Ω by 27 by 19 feet. Inspired by the maze-like entrance to the Coney Island Cyclone roller coaster, the piece took viewers visually through a turnstile and along several sets of steps and walkways to a set of wooden tracks and red metal rails. Built of wood, acrylic, paint, glass, metal, and light fixtures, the work also incorporated a looped audio track of a rollercoaster to enhance the experience. As with all of her larger works, the viewers moves around the perimeter of the piece looking in. Dennis has said that although the pieces cannot be entered physically, she wishes the viewers to enter them through the use of their imaginations. 'Coney Night Maze' represents thirteen years of labor under the shadow of 9/11 and in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, which washed away the portion of the Cyclone that inspired the work. The piece continues Dennis‚Äôs exploration of the underworld, creating an initial sense of dislocation or confusion. The work suggests surprising routes of discovery and escape from the maze, into a space transcendent and eternal. Recent Work 'Studies for Little Tube House and the Night Sky' (2015), exhibited at Mixed Greens gallery in 2015, combined gouache paintings, dioramas, and architectural sculpture to transform the gallery into a poetic contemplation of friendship, death, and connection. Inspired by a structure on the shores of Lake Superior, the work incorporates gouache paintings and small-scale dioramas of a small, pale house with pipes and cables reaching out into a large and formidable darkness. Dedicated to the artist‚Äôs young friend who passed away suddenly, the piece references her friend‚Äôs connection to the Universe as well as a collective journey into the unknown. 'Ship and Dock/Nights and Days or The Gazer' (2018), exhibited at Lesley Heller Gallery in 2018, marks the first time Dennis married her paintings on paper with a three-dimensional installation and the first time she incorporated video projection into her work. The work places the viewer in a darkened gallery under a night sky, near what appears to be a giant ore dock, a familiar site on the shores of Lake Superior. Two small houses are perched within the dock‚Äôs columns, beams, ramps, and stairways. One house faces the viewer; the other faces away. This house, ‚ÄúThe Gazer,‚Äù looks toward a view of water, ship, and sky, as starry night changes to dawn and back to night again. The work builds on Dennis‚Äôs earlier explorations of industrial architecture and her interest in metaphorical stopping places on the journey through life. Dennis expanded on many of the themes in Coney Night Maze in a series of dioramas (2001-05) that incorporate constellations, rocks, and houses, exhibited at FiveMyles Gallery in 2005. Public Art Dennis has received commissions for a number of permanent public artworks, including fences in Boston, MA, P.S. 234 in Tribeca, JFK International Airport, and I.S. 5, in Queens, NY, as well temporary such as Tourist Cabins on Park Avenue, presented by New York City Parks & Recreation and the Park Avenue Sculpture Committee in 2007. Awards, grants and fellowships Dennis is the recipient of the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant (2016, 2009, 2005, 2001), the Harpo Foundation Grant (2013), the National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in Sculpture (1994, 1986, 1980) the New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship in Painting (1992), the New York Creative Artists Public Service Grant (1981, 1975) and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship in Sculpture (1979), among others. In 2015 she was awarded the Anonymous Was A Woman Award, in 2014 she received the Award of Merit Medal for Sculpture from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and in 2008, the Malvina Hoffman Artist Fund Prize and Daniel Chester French Award for Sculpture from the National Academy Museum and School. Her public art designs have earned her several awards including the Bard Award of Merit in Architecture and Urban Design from The City Club of New York (1989), the Community Service Award for Excellence in Urban Design from the Parks Council of New York (1989) and the Award for Excellence in Design from The Art Commission of the City of New York (1987). In 2010, Dennis was elected to the National Academy and currently serves on its Board of Directors.

Similar to their role in programming languages, metaclasses in Semantic Web languages can have properties otherwise applicable only to individuals, while retaining the same class's ability to be classified in a concept hierarchy. This enables knowledge about instances of those metaclasses to be inferred by semantic reasoners using statements made in the metaclass. Metaclasses thus enhance the expressivity of knowledge representations in a way that can be intuitive for users. While classes are suitable to represent a population of individuals, metaclasses can, as one of their feature, be used to represent the conceptual dimension of an ontology. Metaclasses are supported in the ontology language OWL and the data-modeling vocabulary RDFS. Metaclasses are often modeled by setting them as the object of claims involving rdf:type and rdfs:subClassOf‚Äîbuilt-in properties commonly referred to as instance of and subclass of. Instance of entails that the subject of the claim is an instance, i.e. an individual that is a member of a class. Subclass of entails that the subject is a class. In the context of instance of and subclass of, ordinary can be are the object of instance of claims used on a class, but ordinary classes are not. (where in a claim \`Bob instance of Human\`, Bob is the subject, and Human the object). OWL 2 DL supports metaclasses by a feature called punning, in which one entity is interpreted as two different types of thing‚Äîa class and an individual‚Äîdepending on its syntactic context. For example, through punning, an ontology could have a concept hierarchy such as \`Harry the eagle instance of golden eagle\`, \`golden eagle subclass of bird\`, and \`golden eagle instance of species\`. In this case, the punned entity would be golden eagle, because it is represented as a class (second claim) and an instance (third claim); whereas the metaclass would be species, as it has an instance that is a class. Punning also enables other properties that would otherwise be applicable only to ordinary instances to be used directly on classes, for example \\"golden eagle conservation status least concern.\\" Having arisen from the fields of knowledge representation, description logic and formal ontology, Semantic Web languages have a closer relationship to philosophical ontology than do conventional programming languages such as Java or Python. Accordingly, the nature of metaclasses is informed by philosophical notions such as abstract objects, the abstract and concrete, and type-token distinction. Metaclasses permit concepts to be construed as tokens of other concepts while retaining their ontological status as types. This enables types to be enumerated over, while preserving the ability to inherit from types. For example, metaclasses could allow a machine reasoner to infer from a human-friendly ontology how many elements are in the periodic table, or, given that number of protons is a property of chemical element and isotopes are a subclass of elements, how many protons exist in the isotope hydrogen-2. Metaclasses are sometime organized by levels, in a similar way to the simple Theory of types where classes that are not metaclasses are assigned the first level, classes of classes in the first level are in the second level, classes of classes in the second level on the next and so on.  Examples  Following the type-token distinction, real world objects such as Abraham Lincoln or the planet Mars are regrouped into classes of similar objects. Abraham Lincoln is said to be an instance of human, and Mars is an instance of planet. This is a kind of is-a relationship. Metaclasses are class of classes, such as for example the nuclide concept. In chemistry, atoms are often classified as elements and, more specifically, isotopes. The glass of water one last drank has many hydrogen atoms, each of which is an instance of hydrogen. Hydrogen itself, a class of atoms, is an instance of nuclide. Nuclide is a class of classes, hence a metaclass.  Implementations  = RDF and RDFS = In RDF, the property is used to state that a resource is an instance of a class. This enables metaclasses to be easily created by using in a chain-like fashion. For example, in the two triples Harry the eagle rdf:type golden eagle golden eagle rdf:type species the resource is a metaclass, because is used as a class in the first statement and the class is said to be an instance of the class in the second statement. RDF also provides as a way to create properties beyond those defined in the built-in vocabulary. Properties can be used directly on metaclasses, for example \\"\\", where is a property defined via and is a metaclass per the preceding example above. RDFS, an extension of RDF, introduced and and enriched how vocabularies can classify concepts. Whereas enables vocabularies to represent instantiation, the property enables vocabularies to represent subsumption. RDFS thus makes it possible for vocabularies to represent taxonomies, also known as subsumption hierarchies or concept hierarchies, which is an important addition to the type‚Äìtoken distinction made possible by RDF. Notably, the resource is an instance of itself, demonstrating both the use of metaclasses in the language's internal implementation and a reflexive usage of . RDFS is its own metamodel = OWL = In some OWL flavors like OWL1-DL, entities can be either classes or instances, but cannot be both. This limitations forbids metaclasses and metamodeling. This is not the case in the OWL1 full flavor, but this allows the model to be computationally undecidable. In OWL2, metaclasses can implemented with punning, that is a way to treat classes as if they were individuals. Other approaches have also been proposed and used to check the properties of ontologies at a meta level.  Punning  OWL 2 supports metaclasses through a feature called punning. In metaclasses implemented by punning, the same subject is interpreted as two fundamentally different types of thing‚Äîa class and an individual‚Äîdepending on its syntactic context. This is similar to a pun in natural language, where different senses of the same word are emphasized to illustrate a point. Unlike in natural language, where puns are typically used for comedic or rhetorical effect, the main goal of punning in Semantic Web technologies is to make concepts easier to represent, closer to how they are discussed in everyday speech or academic literature. = Prot√©g√© = In the ontology editor Prot√©g√©, metaclasses are templates for other classes who are their instances. ¬ß6.1 summary of the RDFS model  Metaclass classification  an example of ontology with a first metaclass order: the classification of some chemical atoms Some ontologies like the Cyc AI project ontology classifies classes and meta-classes themselves in their ontologies. Classes are divided into \\"fixed order classes\\" and \\"variable order classes\\". In the case of the former, an order is attributed for metaclasses by measuring the distance to individuals with respect to the number of \\"instance of\\" triples that are necessary to find an individual. Classes that are not metaclasses are classes of individuals, so their order is \\"1\\". Metaclasses that are classes of first order classes' order is \\"2\\", and so on. Variable order metaclasses, on the other hand, can have instances, one example of variable order metaclass is the class of all fixed order classes.

Frontman Zach Rogue, feeling exhausted after the tour and recording and release of the album, took time off from Rogue Wave to work on other projects. Says Rogue: \\"I didn't want to do Rogue Wave unless I felt really excited again, like it was when we were starting out.

She spent most of her life making art prevalent and important to the Duxbury, Massachusetts community. Moving from Boston in the 1950s, where she had attended school at the Museum of Fine Arts, Youse was influenced by Austrian expressionist Oskar Kokoschka who gave a talk at her school and was exhibited in the Boston museum. Youse painted portraits and still lifes but was mainly known for landscapes. From 1958 to 1968 Youse taught classes at the Duxbury Art Association to all ages. She continued to teach out of her studio on Church Street but Gay's attention was drawn to the Helen Bumpus Gallery in 1968 where she became the gallery director for 20 years. She exhibited artists like Alice Neel, Harold Tovish, Mariana Pineda, Louis Tarlow, Jack Wolfe, Penelope Lencks, David Aronson, and Karl Zerbe. To stimulate students in the local high school, Duxbury High School, Youse showed the students works in the gallery. Many of her students went on to becoming artists in their own right or art educators. The high school created a perpetual scholarship in her name for Duxbury graduates.

He launched his rebellion with an attack on the garrison town of Derry, which was taken thanks to the element of surprise. The town was then almost entirely destroyed by fire. Background O'Doherty was the Gaelic Lord of Inishowen. He had been allied with the government during the Nine Years' War (1594-1603), and has been described as \\"a youthful war hero on the side of the crown\\".McCavitt p.115 During the conflict, he fought alongside Sir Henry Docwra's troops from the key base of Derry. O'Doherty, along with other pro- English Irish lords, was unhappy when the Treaty of Mellifont restored the leading rebels, Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone and Rory O'Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, to land which had been promised to them. O'Doherty was further unsettled when his friend and ally Docwra was replaced as Governor of Derry by Sir George Paulet. In the years following the war Paulet continually confronted and antagonized O'Doherty, who appealed to the Dublin government which generally sided with Paulet. O'Doherty attempted to use his contacts in London to secure himself a role as a courtier which would have given him much greater influence, and sought a position in the household of Henry, Prince of Wales.McCavitt p.118 Continued disputes with Paulet pushed O'Doherty to finally undertake a rebellion, which he seems to have begun on the spur of the moment. Unknown to him, the very day that he began his rising the London government had approved his request to join the Prince of Wales, and had generally sided with him against the Dublin administration.McCavitt p.136-37 Seizure After tricking his friend Captain Henry Hart, by inviting him to dinner and then taking him prisoner, O'Doherty was able to take control of Culmore Fort, the post that Hart commanded. This was a major arsenal, which he used to arm his supporters.Bardon p.102 At 2, O'Doherty led around seventy to a hundred followers against the nearby town of Derry. Although the garrison numbered somewhere as high as a hundred soldiers, with many other men among the civilian population who could bear arms, they were completely taken by surprise as no sentries had been posted. O'Doherty was able to take the lower fort without bloodshed, but his deputy Phelim MacDavitt had harder work in the higher fort. Some resistance was led by a Lieutenant Gordon, but was quickly overwhelmed and killed.Bardon p.102-3 Around half a dozen men were killed on each side during the brief fighting at Derry Fort.McCavitt p.139 In the town itself O'Doherty and his men hunted down his enemies. The Governor George Paulet was reportedly killed by Phelim MacDavitt near his house, while O'Doherty targeted a sheriff named Harrison. However, several other officials sought by O'Doherty were absent. The remaining settlers took shelter in the residence of Bishop George Montgomery, who was also absent at the time. They surrendered to O'Doherty who assured them that \\"it was not blood that he sought for\\".McCavitt p.139-41 O'Doherty's actions suggest that he was principally targeting those he personally considered his enemies, rather than contemplating a wholesale massacre. Burning The \\"infant city\\" of Derry was destroyed, with all of its eighty five houses burnt including the Bishop's residence.Bardon p.103 Montgomery was a friend of O'Doherty's and had sided with him in his dispute with Paulet, whom he had himself had difficulties with. Nonetheless the insurgents set fire to Montgomery's house and library, despite being offered ¬£100 to spare the two thousand books there. The destruction of the books was because they were considered heretical by the Catholic rebels, rather than \\"an act of mindless, wanton destruction\\"McCavitt p.141 Some prisoners were released shortly afterwards, but more important figures including the wife and sister of Bishop Montgomery were detained as hostages. These prisoners were taken away to O'Doherty's residence at Burt Castle in Donegal. For their participation in the burning, the MacDavitts became known by their Protestant neighbours as the \\"Burn-Derrys\\"McCavitt p.141 although this name is sometimes also applied to O'Doherty himself. News of the fall of Derry caused alarm in Dublin, partly because the Irish Army was very small at the time and it was not prepared to respond to the northern uprising. Paulet was widely blamed for the defeat as he was disliked by his soldiers and settlers, had antagonized local inhabitants such as O'Doherty and had not taken basic military preparations such as posting a night watch. He had ignored warnings sent to him by Richard Hansard, the commander at Lifford, about suspicious activities in the area just days earlier.McCavitt p.140 It was observed that had \\"not the rebels taken away his life, it could not in justice have been left him by the state\\".McCavitt p.140 Aftermath O'Doherty gathered support following his victory at Derry, and his forces ranged across Ulster burning several other settlements. O'Doherty possibly hoped that he would be offered a settlement by the government, as had happened during rebellions over previous decades, rather than risking a long and expensive war. This prospect was dashed by the quick response of Sir Arthur Chichester in Dublin who oversaw the dispatch of what reinforcements he could spare northwards and the raising of loyal Gaelic forces. They soon recaptured the burnt-out ruins of Derry. The main force of rebels were defeated at the Battle of Kilmacrennan, where O'Doherty was killed. A group of remaining rebels made a final stand at the Siege of Tory Island, but the rising had been overcome quickly.McCavitt p.141-48 One consequence of the rising was a major change in the planned Ulster Plantation, which had previously been intended to involve a few limited settlements, alongside a re-sharing of the lands among the loyalist Gaelic leaders. However, after O'Doherty's attack on Derry, the government no longer trusted many of the Gaelic leaders, even those who had not risen in revolt, and brought in a more ambitious scheme of importing large numbers of English and Scottish settlers. Gaelic leaders therefore got a smaller share of the land division than had been earlier planned. Derry was rebuilt following its destruction and was renamed 'Londonderry', becoming an integral part of the new plantation and the last walled city to be built in western Europe. Its important strategic location made Derry the site of several further military actions throughout the Seventeenth Century during the Irish Confederate Wars and the Williamite War, most notably the 1689 Siege of Derry.

She is notable as an experimental artist combining movement, props, environments, and interactive video. She is a professor emeritus in the Studio for Interrelated Media at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. She inspired generations of interdisciplinary artists with her classes, particularly the course \\"On The Spot\\", which many remember as transformative. Currently, Dawn creates & performs in site-specific videos, and travels extensively. Biography In 2012, the Massachusetts Cultural Council awarded Dawn Kramer an Artist Fellowship in Choreography. This is the sixth fellowship that the Commonwealth has awarded her since she established her career base in Boston. The grant enabled Kramer and Stephen Buck to create seven site-specific performance videos in Ireland, France, and Sicily during a sabbatical semester. These seven short videos were shown in the Paine Gallery in Boston in 2013. Kramer's live choreography has appeared on 15' high scaffolding (Pipe Dream) and vast rope nets (After Ever), in sites as varied as the Back Bay Train Station and the stairway of the Boston Public Library. Her work has been performed at Jacob's Pillow, Dance Theatre Workshop in NYC, and in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and France as well as throughout New England. Since 2007, Kramer and Stephen Buck have been collaborating on pieces involving live performance and video projections on the performers. Body of Water premiered June, 2011 in the Pozen Center and Godine gallery at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. The work included installation of six silent video/movement poems, two videos by Buck and live performance by Kramer in a video projection environment. Cracking premiered April 12, 2008 at the Pozen Center at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. It was later performed at Boston University and Jordan Hall. Katarina Miljkovic created the music, with performance by Kramer and video and lighting by Stephen Buck. This trio's second collaboration, Entanglement, was presented by the Cambridge Science Festival and Cyberarts in April and May, 2009. Kramer's current choreography uses video projections on the performer(s) to reflect on the nature of choice, the relationship of body to self, age and gender, and to question the idea of the self as a solid, separate reality. In 2010, Kramer was awarded the Marilyn Pappas faculty grant from the MassArt Foundation to assist her visit to Kyoto where she made three silent video/movement poems in temple gardens. The Bogliasco Foundation assisted her creation of Body of Water with a residency in Italy in fall, 2010. All these pieces envision the human being as a small, non-dominant, or integrated element of Nature. Kramer received several grants and awards from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Massachusetts Cultural Council and Artists Foundation, the LEF Foundation, among others. A grant from the French Ministry of Culture enabled a three- month residency at the La Napoule Art Foundation in France. There she collaborated with international artists and created an evening of solo work called, Vous Etes Ici! Ms. Kramer had the pleasure of performing in Meredith Monk's Celebration Service in Cambridge and in From the Horse's Mouth at Jacob's Pillow and Brandeis University. In 2007-2008, Kramer appeared as \\"Ishtar\\" in John Holland's Lament for a Dead Companion in Boston and New York performances. Early life Dawn started dancing in the basement with her mother, to the radio, when she was four. She choreographed her first dance at five and performed for anyone who would watch. Admitted to her first formal dance class in kindergarten, because she knew her right from her left, her first \\"starring\\" role at six was as \\"the Princess Who Didn't Know How to Dance.\\" Kramer graduated from White Plains High School with highest honors in 1963. She was a scholarship student at the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance in New York City in the early 60's. Kramer attended Wellesley College from 1963‚Äì65, transferred to Sarah Lawrence College and earned a BA in dance/performing arts from Sarah Lawrence in 1967 where she studied with the late, renowned Bessie Schonberg. She performed with Liz Keen's company at the Judson Church and with Muriel Manings in the late 60's, both in New York. After a year in San Francisco, Kramer moved to Boston in 1970 with her then husband and young son. In 1973, she co-founded Dance Collective and gave birth to her daughter in 1974. Dance Collective Dawn Kramer is a founder of Dance Collective which she co-directed for thirty years, creating and/or performing in approximately seventy works. In addition to Kramer, the significant forces in the company were Martha Armstrong Gary, Susan Dowling, Ruth Wheeler, Judith Chaffee, and Micki Taylor-Pinney. Dance Collective's mission was to bring quality contemporary dance to a wide variety of audiences in various settings and to provide educational programs to people of all ages and abilities. The Summer Outreach Program and Intergenerational Company gave urban teens the chance to work alongside professional dancers, creating a program that toured the summer camps of Boston, performing for and teaching thousands of youngsters each summer. That program has morphed into the Reach! program at Boston University, spearheaded by Micki Taylor-Pinney. In addition to programs of works by several Dance Collective choreographers, the company assisted full-evening works by individual artistic directors. Kramer's first full-evening, site specific piece, Point of View, moved up the stairway and into the windowsills of the old ICA building in Boston. Her other full-evening works involved large interactive sets designed by Dutch designer, Pieter Smit. In Foreign Fling, she climbed a mountain of defunct TV's and electronics. In One False Move, she and Smit \\"built\\" a roller coaster of a path to a height of 12' above the stage, singing, speaking several languages, and moving all the while. In After Ever, the dancers climbed, rolled, and flung themselves onto and through a hand-knotted rope net (18'x22') which dropped into the Cyclorama, bisecting the circular performance space. Artistic philosophy Kramer's current work envisions the human being as a small, non-dominant, integrated part of the natural environment. In videos as well as in live performances in projection environments, she explores the porous boundaries of \\"self.\\"(See descriptions of specific pieces.) During the 70's and 80's, Kramer's work often used ordinary objects from everyday life as physical, metaphorical, and expressive extensions of the performers. Works like Rag, Blue Cheer, Housewares, Conversation Piece, Pressed for Time, and Bits & Pieces reflected aspects of her life as a mother of young children, in often humorous and fractured ways. Works such as Rest Area, Intervals of Heavy Rain, Cameo, the videodance \\"My Place/or Yours?\\" and \\"What We Here Possess\\" looked at love relationships in various forms and stages. Many of Kramer's large scale works in the late 80's and 90's were presented by Dance Umbrella, in particular Pipe Dream and After Ever which were designed specifically for the huge round Cyclorama building at the Boston Center for the Arts. Choreography such as Raw Stuff (1985), Reach (1993), and Shout! (2000) explored pure movement, each in a distinct way. =Collaboration= Dawn has prioritized collaboration as a mainstay of her artistic practice. Over the years, she has collaborated with the following artists: Choreographers * Judith Chaffee, Martha Armstrong Gray, and Micki Taylor-Pinney of Dance Collective * Se√°n Curran * Peter DiMuro Composers * Antony Flackett * Fast Forward * John Holland (composer) * Katarina Miljkovic * David Moss * Kevin Pelrine * Yuval Ron * Caleb Sampson * Laetitia Sonami * Stan Strickland * Jeff Talman * Patino Vasquez Musicians * Melanie Almiron * John Clark * Jeff Davis * Bridget Fitzgerald * Evan Harlan * Ron Heifitz * Randall Hodgkinson * Wanetta Jackson * Christopher O'Reilly * Merle Perkins * Annie Silberman * Sid Smart Visual Artists/Designers * Carol Anthony * Bebe Beard * Kate Blacker * Stephen Buck * Candace Fleming * Sara Marhamo * Carol Ramsey * Pieter Smit Video Artists * Stephen Buck * Joe Briganti * Robin Doty * Antony Flackett * Corey Smithson * Noah Stout Poets * Malek Alloula * Steven Ratiner Notable Performances = Body of Water (2011) = Body of Water is a two part video installation. It begins with single channel projections on three screens showing several silent video-movement poems made in different parts of the world, including the coast of Maine, Kyoto, Japan, Westwood, Massachusetts and the Ligurean coast of Italy. These short site-specific videos envision the human figure at a small scale or more embedded in our marine/terrestrial environment, thus imagining a better balance between the two. It is followed by a performance by Dawn Kramer in a video projection environment. Body of Water explores the delicate relationship between human beings and the sea. The earth's surface is covered with about 71% water, with less than 1% of it available to support all living things. The human body is filled with 55%-78% water that is remarkably similar to seawater in its chemical composition. Humans and the sea are deeply connected, yet the negative human impact on our oceans has been vast. The work also continues exploring the mysteries of Buddhist philosophy, questioning the boundaries of \\"self.\\" Stephen Buck manipulated video imagery through Isadora software and composer Antony Flackett aka DJ Flack added some music for the piece. Sara Marhamo (Industrial Stitchers Guild) created the costumes. Body of Water was started in a residency at the Liguria Study Center where Kramer was a Fellow of the Bogliasco Foundation in the Fall of 2010 and continued with the support of the Studio for Interrelated Media at Massachusetts College of Art and Design and the MassArt Foundation. = Mercy (1993) = The most compelling work on the program was \\"Mercy,\\" a new solo for Kramer that examined - with both humor and poignancy - the increasing violence against women. Kramer began the dance dressed in only a bra and pantyhose, and in a reverse striptease, slowly added other undergarments, some clutched between her teeth, others wrapped around her head and legs . Women, Kramer appeared to say, are trapped in a web of society's own images and expectations. As the dance ended and the mournful score grew in intensity, Kramer appeared visibly moved by her own performance. It was a powerful and intimate moment.\\" --Andrew Dreyfus, The Boston Herald, June 2, 1993. Mercy references the title of Andrea Dworkin's controversial book. The dance is a reverse striptease to Hungarian folk music. It uses the layering and binding of underwear worn in odd ways as a metaphor for restrictions and violence against women. It is a challenging piece to perform, both physically and emotionally. Mercy makes some audience members uncomfortable as it is a somewhat graphic look at the often hidden problem of domestic violence. = Imaginary Crossing (1980)= \\"Body movements and camera movements are marvelously harmonious...the dancer appears to work within the dimension of a video-space (and not a theatrical space)... Through a combination of pacing, eye contacts, close-up camera work, compelling rhythms, mystery and power, the work inexorably draws the viewer under its own mantle. Sensual appeal, symbolic suggestion and metaphor are employed in ways to suggest many layers of meaning, and, most importantly, convey the feeling of a probing intellect, a joint exploration, a meld of perception and body movement...It is this sense of thoughtful inquiry into both the form and content of television that is most provocative and challenging -- Kramer- Doty's joint effort to find a \\"perfect\\" and true visual syntax for the natural properties of the television medium.\\" --David H. Katzive (former) Director, DeCordova and Dana Museum and Park, January 25, 1982.

It was translated by Aslƒ± Bi√ßen into her native language Turkish under the title Baba ve Pi√ß in March 2006, and became a bestseller. Summary The story is centered around the characters of Asya Kazancƒ± and Armanoush Tchakhmakhchian. It is set in Tucson, Arizona; San Francisco, California; and Istanbul, Turkey. The novel deals with their families and how they are connected through the events of the 1915 Armenian Genocide. At age nineteen, Armanoush travels secretly to Istanbul to search for her Armenian roots. Theatre adaptation The novel was adapted into a theatre play in Italian language by Angelo Savelli titled La Bastarda Di Istanbul, and was staged by Teatro di Rifredi in Florence, Italy. Its premiere took place on March 3, 2015 starring Turkish actress Serra Yƒ±lmaz. Trial against the author In June 2006, Kemal Kerin√ßsiz, a nationalist lawyer, sued Elif Shafak for allegedly \\"insulting Turkishness\\" in her novel by dealing with the Armenian Genocide in the last years of the Ottoman Empire. The lawsuit was opened at Istanbul's Beyoƒülu district court in accordance with Article 301 of the Turkish Criminal Code. After the prosecutor dropped the charges due to lack of insult, the lawyer refiled his complaint at a higher court, the Beyoglu 2nd Court of First Instance, in July 2006. Shafak faced a sentence of up to three years in prison for the remarks made in her novel. In September 2006, the court, attended also by Joost Lagendijk, co-chair of the delegation to the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, acquitted her of criminal charges due to lack of legal grounds for the crime in question and insufficient evidence in the controversial trial.

Arcand (born 1982) is a nehiyaw photo-based artist from Muskeg Lake Cree Nation, Saskatchewan, who currently resides in Ottawa, Ontario. In addition to art, Arcand focuses on publishing, art books, zines, collage and accessibility to art.  Early life and education  Arcand was born in 1982 in Hafford, Saskatchewan. She grew up on Muskeg Lake Cree Nation in central Saskatchewan. She spent many summers working in the Muskeg Lake Archives which gave Arcand her love of old photographs and history. Arcand later attended the University of Saskatchewan where she received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree with Great Distinction in 2005. She began making artwork that addressed her identity in the second year of her studies at the University, at which point she decided to focus on photography and printmaking. Her first photography projects were in direct response to the images of photographer Edward S. Curtis, who was working in the early 1900s.  Work  Arcand has served as chair of the board of directors for Paved Art and New Media in Saskatoon, and along with Felicia Gay was the co-founder of the Red Shift Gallery, a contemporary Aboriginal art gallery also in Saskatoon that was in operation from 2006 to 2010. She was the founder of Kimiwan, a 'zine for Indigenous artists and writers that published eight issues from 2012 to 2014. Arcand curated the zine with her cousin Mika Lafond as a way to showcase Aboriginal- inspired visual art and writings. The magazine focused on decolonization, healing and family. Arcand took inspiration from her involvement in the R.A.I.N. (radical art in nature) collective in Vancouver in order to found Kimiwan. She has also been published in BlackFlash Magazine. Arcand was the Nigig Visiting Artist in Residence in Indigenous Visual Culture with the Faculty of Design at OCAD University from 15 October ‚Äì 11 November 2017. Her work has been exhibited at Gallery 101 (Ottawa), York Quay Gallery (Toronto), Mendel Art Gallery and Paved Arts (Saskatoon), and Grunt Gallery (Vancouver). Arcand's work explores personal and political experiences through the lens of her mixed-race identity. Arcand explores the revitalization of the Cree language through her art and has studied the language her whole life. She said that \\"Language is culture. There are far too many Indigenous languages that are either extinct or endangered. Cree has been named one of the three languages that remain 'viable' by Statistics Canada; the number of speakers varies from 12,000-75,000. However, I realized that my own inability to speak the language means that in my family, the language is extinct. This realization triggered urgency in me that the time is now to start revitalizing our indigenous languages.\\" Some of her past work depicts a world where English and French signage is replaced with the Cree language. Arcand appeared as an extra on the set of the Portlandia TV series in 2015. Arcand was the curator of a collective mural project in Ottawa from 21 June 2018 to October 2019 titled nƒÅkatƒìyimisowin - Taking Care of Oneself. This project was funded and organized by Heritage Canada and was launched on the National Indigenous Peoples Day on 21 June 2018. Four Indigenous artists created the murals; Cedar Eve Peters, who is Anishinaabe, Ojibwe (Shifting of Energies), Glenn Gear, who is Inuk (Ommatik ‚Äì Heart), Michelle Sound, who is a member of the Swan River First Nation and Red River M√©tis (Kahkiyaw acƒÅhkosak ‚Äì All the Stars), and Tara-Lynn Kozma-Perrin, who is Cree (We Are Resilient). These murals are located in the pedestrian tunnel under Wellington Street at the Portage bridge. Arcand explained that she \\"wanted to address self-care from an Indigenous perspective. Indigenous peoples are always sort of required to resist. We have peoples, we have activists, we have artists who are constantly pushing back against colonialism and all the struggles that come with that. I wanted to take a step back and think about like what happens when we stop resisting and just take care of each other. Each of the artists had their own interpretation of what that meant and what I've found interesting as a curator, even though the theme was center around the self, really the self in the community are inseparable, and I like that you come across it without expecting it.\\" She designs jewelry featuring Indigenous languages in a recent project titled Mad Aunty. Arcand currently acts as the Director of the Nordic Lab - a new space dedicated to artists from the circumpolar region - at artist-run-centre SAW Gallery in Ottawa.

An accomplished watercolorist, she was a member of the Cleveland School of artists, and served as The Plain Dealer's principal art critic from 1926 to 1949. Biography Kelly was born in Cleveland. Her parents were Thomas and Mary Hart Kelly, Irish immigrants. At age 15, she entered the Cleveland School of Art, studying under painter Henry Keller. After graduating, she served as an instructor there until 1904, when she left to begin work as a commercial artist. She helped found the Cleveland Women's Art Club in 1912, and exhibited there throughout her career. In 1926, her writing gained the attention of Plain Dealer editor Erie C. Hopwood, who invited her to become the newspaper's art critic. Her stories on the Guelph Treasure in 1931 helped the Cleveland Museum of Art draw record crowds to view the objects. An avid traveler, she visited Ireland and Guatemala, painting those areas in addition to her Northeast Ohio home. Kelly suffered a stroke in November 1949 and died the following January at the age of 73. The Plain Dealer's editorial page wrote that her colleagues would \\"long cherish the memory of an artist and writer who enriched their lives with Irish wit and points of view that opened up picturesque vistas that otherwise would have been missed.\\" She never married, and was survived by her brother, John, and three sisters, Mary, Julia, and Maria.

It is sometimes referred to as What I Saw in the Water. Frida Kahlo‚Äôs What the Water Gave Me has been called her biography. As the scholar Natascha Steed points out, \\"her paintings were all very honest and she never portrayed herself as being more or less beautiful than she actually was.\\" With this piece she reflected on her life. Kahlo released her unconscious mind through the use of what seems to be an irrational juxtaposition of images in her bathwater. In this painting, Frida paints herself, precisely her legs and feet, lying in a bath of grey water. The painting was included in Kahlo's first solo exhibit at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York City in November 1938. It is now part of the private collection of Surrealist art collector Daniel Filipacchi. Description Kahlo's toes point up from the water in a bathtub and are reflected back into the water. They dominate the painting, and, along with an underwater view of her thighs, are all that can be seen of her in this self-portrait. In the water float remnants of Kahlo's life. There is an island which holds a volcano erupting a skyscraper, a dead woodpecker perched upon a tree, and a small skeleton resting upon a hill. From this island a tight rope begins which creates a diamond-like shape within the center of the tub, and eventually wraps around the neck of a naked female figure, who floats Ophelia-like. From this female figure, who may represent Kahlo herself, the rope returns into the hand of a faceless man lounging on the edge of the island, who seems to be watching the woman that he is distantly strangling. Also floating in the bathtub are an empty Mexican dress, a seashell full of bullet-holes, a couple that resemble Kahlo's parents from her earlier painting My Grandparents My Parents and I, and two female lovers who later reappear in her 1939 painting Two Nudes in a Forest.  Interpretations  The painting references traditional and ancient iconography, mythology and symbolism, eroticism and botany all mapped out onto a scene depicting the legs of the artist herself (as signified by her wounded right foot) submerged in bath water. References to Kahlo's earlier works and influences have been noted. These include themes from her painting My Parents, My Grandparents and I (1936), allusions to fifteenth-century painter Hieronymus Bosch's The Garden of Earthly Delights in her attention to flora and fauna, and a reference to her political position by documenting the clash of the old and the new in the dramatic detail of a skyscraper burning inside a volcano. Among the various elements of macabre that are visible, a skeleton and a nude bather choked by a rope stand out. What the Water Gave Me was Frida's memoir of her life, depicting life and death and comfort and loss. In the midst of her vision lies the way in which Frida found herself submerged by her life. Frida is quoted saying \\"I drank to drown my pain, but the damned pain learned how to swim, and now I am overwhelmed by this decent and good behavior.\\" Scholar Graham Watt stated that a common feature of Kahlo's paintings is duality, as Kahlo painted \\"the body she lost and the body she had, her heterosexual and lesbian affairs, traditional and modern ways, Mexican and European, the closeness and treachery of those she loved, sadness and joy as well as the community of her world view and the loneliness of her position.\\" Frida found only her hardships in her bath. In this portrait Kahlo appears lifeless as she lies in a bathtub submerged in water, her legs barely visible but her feet emerge from the water. Her right foot is bleeding and deformed, reflecting what was happening to her body while she suffered in pain. Of the 30-plus operations she endured, most were on her back, right leg and right foot. Hence the wreckage in the painting over her right leg; between the toes of her right foot is a bleeding crack. Along with Kahlo‚Äòs childhood polio that caused more than a slight deformity in her right leg. The spina bifida Kahlo suffered from is a congenital deformity, which results from incomplete closure of neural tube and a partially fused spinal cord. This decreased circulation to her limbs, together with polio and the 1925 streetcar accident, was the root of Kahlo‚Äôs chronic battle with neuropathic pain. Like What the Water Gave Me, Frida‚Äôs paintings were very personal. It is written by Leticia P√©rez Alonso that ‚Äúin Kahlo‚Äôs painting the viewer ends up identifying with the represented object, and thus the distance between both of them is dissolved.‚Äù In order to bring her viewers as deep into her life as possible, the strong details in her painting made it so that the distance between the self and the other is obliterated so that they are to share in the same experience. Kahlo returned to the same symbols and figures that can be seen in her other paintings. The Volcano itself is the cornerstone of this painting as it is a strong symbol of her no longer suppressing her feelings about her body, her relationship to her husband, Diego Rivera; the source of most of her passion pain, and her self- worth. In her diary, Kahlo described herself as ‚Äúthe one who gave birth to herself.‚Äù A scholar concluded that she was starting to discover and experience both her own self and the world about her at a new more conscious level.‚Äù The eruption of the volcano mirrors her inevitable eruption. What the Water Gave Me is a symbol of its own; a symbol of self-discovery. With this painting Frida Kahlo demonstrated her ability as a surreal artist who through her method of aggressive visual imagery, rather than verbal language, can convey the trauma of her own existence by putting herself on trial all while simultaneously creating art. According to the critic Bertram Wolfe, Kahlo's paintings appeared to bring together surrealism and a \\"deep-rooted Mexican tradition\\". On the basis of this painting, Kahlo was labeled a surrealist. Before this she never considered herself a ‚Äúsurrealist‚Äù she just utilized this portrait as her platform to express her hurt and expel her demons. Andr√© Breton saw Kahlo's art as Surrealist, saying of her work, \\"The promises of fantasy are filled with greater splendor by reality itself!\\" For Breton, this work was exemplary of her Surrealism.  Namesakes  * What the Water Gave Me: Poems after Frida Kahlo is a collection of poems by Pascale Petit released in 2010 that were inspired by and reference Kahlo's work. With regards to the present painting, Petit makes Kahlo say that it reveals \\"my half-drowned thoughts bobbing around my legs\\". Other descriptions of various elements seen in the painting include \\"The Empire State Building spewing gangrene / over my shin\\" and a \\"giant / one-legged quetzal pierced by a tree\\". * \\"What the Water Gave Me\\" is a song by Florence and the Machine, and the first song released from their second studio album, Ceremonials (2011). It was written by Florence Welch with Francis White and produced by Paul Epworth. Welch decided to give the name to the song after viewing a Frida Kahlo work.

She uses everyday materials in her painting and sculpture to reflect on space, time, rhythm and form.  Early life and education  Onur was born in Kuzguncuk, Istanbul. She attended the Department of Sculpture at the Istanbul Academy of Fine Arts, where she was a student of Ali Hadi Bara. Rewarded a Fulbright scholarship, she continued her master's degree in sculpture at Maryland College of Art, Department of Sculpture where she graduates in 1967.  Works  Onur's early works come in the form of abstract geometric sculptures. However, starting from 1971 she used found objects and light, transparent or reflective materials to create rhythmic compositions that examine space and time. Having lived and worked in the same house on the Bosphorus where she was born, her childhood memories and objects (clothes, toys, furniture, photographs) as well as found objects collected from its vicinity are materials she often rearranges in her works . In response to a series of open air exhibitions in Istanbul, such as in the gardens of the Museum of Archeology (1976 and 1977) and Dolmabahce Palace (1977), her work developed towards site-specificity and gradually embraced the installation form. Expanding the boundaries of both sculpture and painting, works such as Floral Counterpoint (1982) and Third Dimension in Painting (1982) create immersive spatial experiences. In parallel, her interest in the language of musical composition took center stage starting from Cadence (1995) and Prelude (2001) in Istanbul's Ma√ßka Sanat Galerisi, and became a prominent feature of some of her works in the 2000s such as Opus II - Fantasia (2001, Kunsthalle Baden- Baden).  Exhibitions  Her work has been shown in solo and group exhibitions at Ma√ßka Sanat Galerisi (1987, 1991, 1995, 2000, 2012), Istanbul Modern (2011), Augarten Contemporary, Vienna (2010), Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven (2005), ZKM, Karlsruhe (2004), Lunds Konsthal (2003), and the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden (2001). She has participated in documenta (13), the Istanbul Biennial (2011, 1999, 1995, 1987), the Moscow Biennale (2007) and an unofficial collateral exhibition for the 58th Venice Biennale (2019).Ruya Foundation, Heartbreak Exhibition ARTER in Istanbul hosted her first comprehensive survey exhibition entitled Through the Looking Glass in 2014. Curated by ARTER's Exhibitions Director Emre Baykal, the exhibition brought together more than forty works, ranging from early abstract geometric drawings to installations that employ daily objects such as toys, textiles, and furniture.  Writings  Onur often accompanied her exhibitions with artistic statements addressing the public directly rather than relying on critics' views. In a 1987 artist talk at Ma√ßka Sanat Galerisi, she said, ‚ÄúThe artwork ends with the explanation of the artist.‚Äù According to Beral Madra, rather than imposing a meaning, this was intended as an invitation for the viewer to engage freely with the works to arrive at their own interpretations and narratives. The artist also wrote texts on exhibitions at Taksim Art Gallery. In her writing on a 1976 artwork by Cengiz √áekil, Onur also criticizes critics for their \\"irresponsible, effortless, arbitrary habit of appreciation or lack thereof.\\"  Collections and documentation  Onur's work has been part of public collections, including Tate Modern in London, MAK in Vienna, and Van Abbemuseum, among others. In a conversation with curator √ñzge Ersoy, collector Agah Uƒüur states that Musical Chair, a 1976 work by Onur is the pivotal work for his collection. Emblematic of the artist's intention to challenge traditional sculpting materials in the 1970s, the work consists of a wooden box with a tiny red chair on top. Uƒüur says that the work's exhibition history is crucial, as the work was rejected from the State Art and Sculpture Exhibition in 1976, with an Academy painting department tutor calling it ‚Äúa child‚Äôs toy.‚Äù In a conversation with curators Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev and Hans Ulrich Obrist, published in conjunction with documenta (13), Onur states, ‚ÄúI forget, ƒ∞lhan [her sister] remembers and asks.‚Äù Onur's sister Ilhan plays a major role in the preservation of her artworks, \\"If Ilhan was not involved, there would not even be the photographs. There would be nothing.\\" References  Further reading  * F√ºsun Onur, documenta (13), BUCHHANDLUNG Walther K√∂nig, Cologne, 2012. * F√ºsun Onur: Aynadan ƒ∞√ßeri, ARTER, ƒ∞stanbul, 2014.

They opened the Canadian School of Ballet on Portage Avenue and shortly afterwards founded the Winnipeg Ballet Club, that in 1953 became the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. The first performance of the Winnipeg Ballet Club was part of a production in Montreal, celebrating the visit of Princess Elizabeth (not yet Queen) and her husband Prince Philip to Canada in May, 1939 (followed by a visit to Winnipeg). Lloyd also founded the dance program at the Banff School of Fine Arts (now The Banff Centre) in 1948. She choreographed 36 works between 1939 and 1952. Her choreographic notes were destroyed in a fire at the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1954. Although she received the appointment as Director of Ballet, she left Winnipeg in 1950 to move to Toronto, where she established another branch of the Canadian School of Ballet, formed the short-lived Toronto Festival Dancers, and continued her choreography. Her work Shadow on the Prairie was filmed by the National Film Board in 1954. Anna Blewchamp successfully enacted a stage reconstruction of Lloyd's The Wise Virgins with help from former dancers in 1992 and the performance was video-recorded.

She returned in 1880 when Alleb√© became director. She remained on friendly terms with him and they continued correspondence after she graduated. In the summer of 1880 Moes met the portrait painter Th√©r√®se Schwartze who introduced her to her network of friends and patrons. After a short stay in Germany she returned to Amsterdam and graduated officially in 1884. That January she travelled with Schwartze to Paris where they worked on their submissions for the Paris Salon. Only one of her paintings was accepted and it was hung very high up on a wall. In May the painters returned to Amsterdam and Moes began her own workshop in the home of her mother on the P.C. Hooftstraat. That same summer she went to the art colony Laren for the first time where she met the painters Anton Mauve, Max Liebermann and Jan Veth. Though she was not an etcher, she received an invitation in 1885 to make a submission for the newly formed Dutch Etcher's Club and submitted an etching for several years after that to their yearly magazine. In this period she became a member of Arti et Amicitiae and sold a painting to Museum Boijmans van Beuningen. Moes exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. In 1898 she moved to Laren where she lived in Hotel Hamdorff, a meeting place for artists. In 1908 she had to move out due to arthritis and gave up painting and began to write stories, living in a converted home that Veth had helped her to set up in Laren. Her decades of work specializing in everyday scenes of Laren's people earned her a place in the town's history: A local prize for volunteer work is named after her.

Although the self-taught artisan had little commercial success during her lifetime, she became famous after designing a jewelry collection for actress Maude Adams to wear in a stage production of As You Like It. Sir Caspar Purdon Clarke and J. P. Morgan commissioned Payne Bowles to make severals pieces of metalwork and jewelry for their collections. She also regularly exhibited her art in the United States and Europe and taught art classes at Shortridge High School in Indianapolis from 1912 until her retirement in 1942. Examples of Payne Bowles's work are included in the collections of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. She also wrote book reviews for Modern Art in the early years of her career and contributed articles to The Craftsman in 1904, Handicraft in 1909 and in 1910, and Jewelers' Circular Weekly in 1911. In addition, Payne Bowles provided illumination paintings for limited-edition books such as The Second Epistle of John (1901). Her novel, Gossamer to Steel, was published in 1917. Early life and education Goblet, 1907-28 ca. Janet Payne, the daughter of John Godman Payne (c. 1847 ‚Äì c. 1889) and Mary Byfield (born c. 1846),\\"Biographical Sketch\\" in was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on June 29, 1872 or 1873.Newton and Weiss, p. 256. Janet trained as a pianist for much of her youth, studying under Clarence Forsyth, the founder of the Indianapolis School of Music. As a student at Indianapolis High School (later renamed Shortridge High School), she studied art under Roda E. Selleck, who was influential in the Arts and Crafts movement in the Indianapolis area. After graduating from Indianapolis High School in 1890, Payne became active in the city's art community but had no further formal art training. In 1895, she joined the Portfolio Club, which was an association of area artists, writers, architects, teachers, and musicians who gathered regularly for exhibitions, lectures, and social events. Marriage and family On October 22, 1895, Payne married Joseph Moore Bowles (1866‚Äì1934). The copule moved to Boston, Massachusetts, soon after their wedding. Joseph Bowles was an Arts and Crafts movement artist in the Indianapolis area who helped to found the Portfolio Club in 1890. He also established Modern Art, a quarterly art journal in Indianapolis in 1893. The publication was later described as \\"one of the most influential art journals to spread the Arts and Crafts message.\\" Bowles sold his interest in the publication after moving to Boston, but remained as its editor until the last issue was published in 1897. In their early years together, Janet and Joseph Bowles moved several times, including a move in 1902 to Rye, New York, where Joseph managed the art department at McClure's Magazine. The first of the couple's two children, a daughter, Mira, was born on July 8, 1902. A son, Jan, was born on November 2, 1904.Newton and Weiss, p. 16. In November 1906, the Bowles family moved to Helicon Hall, part of novelist Upton Sinclair's experimental community on the outskirts of Englewood, New Jersey. After the building where they were living burned in March 1907, the family relocated to New York City. Payne Bowles separated from her husband in 1912, but they were never legally divorced. She moved with her children to her hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana, in the spring of 1912 and found work as an art teacher at her alma mater, which by that time had been renamed Shortridge High School.Shifman, \\"Truth to Material,\\" p. 15. Career =Early years= After Payne Bowles's piano was ruined in a housemoving accident during a move to Boston in 1895, she decided to give up a potential career in music to pursue other interests. Payne Bowles began her literary and artistic career by writing book reviews for Modern Art, the quarterly magazine her husband edited, and providing illumination paintings for limited-edition books that he published. The Second Epistle of John (1901) \\"is her earliest surviving work.\\" Payne Bowles found this type of work unfulfilling and began to attended seminars in psychology and philosophy at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. =Metalsmith and jeweler= While exploring Boston in the late 1890s, Payne Bowles was drawn to the sound of a ringing anvil. She later said, \\"It was such a beautiful tone that it attracted me irresistibly.\\" Payne Bowles sought out the source of the sound and met a young Russian metalsmith who agreed to let her help him in his shop. He was soon arrested and jailed for a plot to overthrow the U.S. government, but Payne Bowles's training in his shop led to her decision to become a metalsmith and jeweler.Shifman, \\"Truth to Material,\\" p. 12. She regularly visited the anarchist in prison and he encouraged her to use his now abandoned equipment to set up a metalwork studio in her home. While continuing to write, Payne Bowles also began to study metalworking more intentionally. She apprenticed as a metalworker, a jeweler, and a stonecutter, as well as studying the work of various artisans, but had no additional formal art training. After Payne Bowles and her family settled in New York City in 1907, she established a small metalworking shop to make jewelry and other objects. She also studied the ancient metalwork used in objects at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and learned from the Japanese metalsmiths who cleaned and worked with the collection. While continuing to experiment with metalwork and jewelry making at her studio, Payne Bowles also attended lectures in psychology at Columbia University.Newton and Weiss, pp. 16‚Äì17. In 1909, Payne Bowles earned a commission from painter and theatrical designer John Alexander to design a jewelry collection for Maude Adams to wear on stage for her role as \\"Rosalind\\" in William Shakespeare's As You Like It. The work increased awareness of Payne Bowles's work and launched her career as a metalsmith and jewelry designer. As her reputation grew, she began to accept commissions from notable people in the city. After a chance meeting with Sir Caspar Purdon Clarke, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1905 to 1910, he commissioned several pieces of her metalwork. Introductions from Clark led her to work for financier J. Pierpont Morgan, who was impressed with Payne Bowles's creations. She later claimed to have spent all of her time from 1909 until Morgan's death in 1913 fashioning numerous commissioned pieces for his flatware and jewelry collection from the gold and jewels that he provided.Newton and Weiss, pp. 18‚Äì19. =Art educator= After separating from her husband and returning to Indianapolis with her two children in 1912, Payne Bowles took a position teaching craftwork courses at her alma mater, now called Shortridge High School. She taught alongside Roda Selleck, her former teacher, until Sellick's retirement in 1924, as well as with artist and educator, Arthur Wesley Dow. In addition to her metalwork and jewelry courses at Shortridge, Payne Bowles introduced a pre-dental course. Beginning in 1929 she also taught pottery. Payne Bowels continued to teach art at Shortridge until her retirement in June 1942. Payne Bowles believed in \\"learning by doing\\" and championed a spontaneous, rhythmic approach to art that \\"stressed balance, proportion, rhythm, and function.\\" Her metalworking program at Shortridge became a popular one.Enrollment in metalworking classes tripled within a year of her arrival. Payne Bowles's students regularly won competitions and learned skills not usually studied by students so young. She also sent some of her advanced students' work to New York City for exhibition at R. L. Gorham's gallery, where it appeared with contributions from students attending Pratt Institute, Columbia University, Cooper Union, Rhode Island School of Design, and the Art Institute of Chicago. =Writer= In addition to writing book reviews for Modern Art in the early years of her career, Payne Bowles wrote articles for Gustav Stickley's Arts and Crafts journal, The Craftsman, in 1904. Other articles by Payne Bowles were published in Handicraft in 1909 and 1910, and in Jewelers' Circular Weekly in 1911. In 1907, a fire in the Bowles's New Jersey apartment building destroyed a manuscript that Payne Bowles had worked on for seven years and had been accepted by a publisher. After reconstructing a new version from her notes, Payne Bowles's novel, Gossamer to Steel, was published in 1917. =Other activities= Payne Bowles regularly exhibited her work in the United States and in Europe. Venues included the second exhibition of the Society of Arts and Crafts in 1899 and the annual exhibition of the National Society of Craftsmen in New York City in 1909 and in 1910. Following her return to Indianapolis in 1912, she exhibited her art at annual exhibitions of the John Herron Art Institute (later renamed the Indianapolis Museum of Art), at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915, and at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Indiana State Fair. She also had several solo shows at the Genthe Studio in New York (1921), Shortridge High School (1924 and 1934), and the Art Center in New York City (1924 and 1929‚Äì30). ArtNews described Payne Bowles in 1925 as \\"one of the most creative designers working in America\\" at that time. She opposed to art that is too imitative or structure-based, preferring instead to make free-form pieces in the Arts-and- Crafts-style that were well-proportioned, harmonious, and balanced.Newton and Weiss, pp. 21‚Äì22. In the 1920s, Payne Bowles entered a gold chalice in an art competition sponsored by Italian art patron J. Bossilini and won first place. Her notoriety from winning the competition led to commissions several Catholic churches in Italy.Newton and Weiss, p. 18. In addition, Payne Bowles visited Paris, France, in 1925 as a delegate to the International Exhibit of Decorative Arts. She also took classes at the Sorbonne and worked with metalsmiths at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. Other trips included visits to Russia and South America.Newton and Weiss, pp. 21‚Äì22. Later years In her later years in Indianapolis, Payne Bowles served as vice president of the Portfolio Club, which she joined in 1894, and was a member of the city's Woman's Poetry Club and Woman's Rotary Club. She also formed the Art Appreciation Club in 1920 and founded the Workmanship Guild in 1927 at Shortridge High School before retiring from teaching in June 1942 due to ill health. Death and legacy Payne Bowles died on July 18, 1948, in Indianapolis, Indiana. She was active contributor to the art community in Indianapolis through her own metalwork and jewelry creations, as well as her three decades of teaching art courses at Shortridge High School. Although Payne Bowles had little commercial success, she continued to create, exhibit, and sell her work and remained active in the Arts and Crafts movement in the United States.Newton and Weiss, p. 21. Payne Bowles's unique metalwork and jewelry have been described as \\"bizarre but compelling,\\" as well as \\"decidedly unconventional.\\"Newton and Weiss, p. 20. She avoided preparatory sketches in her work, preferring to form the metalwork as she proceeded, and encouraged her art students to do the same. Art historians Judith Vale Newton and Carol Ann Weiss commented in their book, Skirting the Issue: Stories of Indiana's Historical Women Artists, that her free-form pieces also showed \\"a controlled engagement with her medium\\" Janet Zapata remarked in an American Crafts article published in 1994 that Payne Bowles's work showed \\"a command of proportion, harmony and balance.\\"Newton and Weiss, p. 21, note 36. In 1968 Payne Bowles's two children donated more than 120 pieces of her metalwork, which were part of Payne Bowles's estate, to the present-day Indianapolis Museum of Art. Payne Bowles's work was included in the exhibition, \\"Independent Spirit: Art by Indiana Women, 1890‚Äì1950\\" at the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 1991‚Äì92. In addition, a retrospective exhibition of her work, \\"The Arts and Crafts Metalwork of Jante Payne Bowles\\" was hosted at the Munson-Williams-Proctor Institute Museum of Art in Utica, New York, in 1993‚Äì94 and at the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 1994.

In these paintings, the heads and bodies of nude female figures have been replaced by architectural forms such as buildings and houses. Femme Maison translates from the French as ‚Äòhousewife‚Äô: literally, ‚Äòwoman house‚Äô. In 1984 Bourgeois produced a small series of Femme Maison prints based on the works of 1947 . Interpretations Bourgeois said the Femme Maison \\"does not know that she is half naked, and she does not know that she is trying to hide. That is to say, she is totally self-defeating because she shows herself at the very moment that she thinks she is hiding.\\" Throughout Femme Maison, Bourgeois shows the home as an essentially female place, in which she can explore ideas about female identity. These paintings are frequently read by feminists as a representation of the abolition of identify for women in home and family, alluding to the \\"problem with no name\\" that Betty Friedan identified in the 60s as the dissatisfaction and the lack of fulfilment of women who embarked on careers as housewives and mothers in suburban America. Another interpretation notes that for Bourgeois, architecture symbolizes the social world that attempts to define the individual, in contrast to the inner world of emotion. The tension between figure and architecture mirrors the dichotomy between mind and body. Use in media The most familiar work from this series was used for the cover of critic Lucy Lippard's influential 1976 collection of feminist essays on art, From The Center. The image of the female nude with the head of a home is also present in the film The Skin I Live In by director Pedro Almod√≥var, who develops a relationship between the main character, Vera, and the works of Louise Bourgeois. Vera paints, amongst various images inspired by Bourgeois, this figure on the wall of her room where she lives in captivity. Sculptures The ideas involved in the Femme Maison paintings were also translated into sculptural forms, in a range of abstraction and figuration using steel and fabric as well as marble, up through 2001. The sculpture titled Femme Maison (2001) is encased in a metal framed glass box called a \\"cell.\\" In one sense, the cell encases and protects the artwork; however, Louise Bourgeois‚Äô intention was to use the cell also as a way of containing the memory held within the work.

The villa was built by an architect Ignatius Stebelski in the years 1903‚Äì1904 at then Placowa Street. The building was designed according to German and English examples of \\"irregular architecture\\" for Reinhold Richter. His brother, Joseph Richter, had built his villa in the vicinity a few years earlier, so the park joined both buildings. After the death of Reinhold Richter in 1930, his wife Matilda, and their five children co-owned the villa. After the death of Matilda there was a further division of the property. Jadwiga Scheibler n√©e Richter was the last inhabitant till the Second World War. After the war, the villa was taken over by the Association of Workers‚Äô Universities. From 1951 to 1956 it housed the Preparatory Centre for Higher Schools. On 23 November 1954 a document transferring the ownership of the building to Lodz University of Technology was drawn up, but the transfer finally took place in the first half of 1956, when it became the seat of the newly created Faculty of Civil Engineering. From 1969 to 1976 the villa housed the Publications Department of TUL. In 1977 it was decided that the building will be used as the Rector‚Äôs main office. One year later the repair and maintenance work started which lasted, with a few years break, until April 1985.

In 2005, Jane's work began to focus itself around the Vietnam War when she became interested in a 1970 anti-war march from Morristown, N.J., to Valley Forge. This led her to organize an exhibition called \\"Operation Rapid American Withdrawal, 1970/2005\\" with over 75 artists participating at the Crane Arts Ice Box Gallery in Philadelphia. In 2012, Jane participated in a multi-venue exhibition at La Salle University which was featured simultaneously at the La Salle University Art Museum and the Connelly Library.

Her work is focused on gender construction, ludic activism, situationist theory, political power struggles, experimental gaming design theory, urban play, the United States Military, avatar gender reification, the global south, and feminist film theory. Schleiner's work is influenced by contemporary art, dada, 1970s performance art, net art, and conceptual art. Early life and education Schleiner was born in 1970 in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1992, Schleiner received her B.A. in studio arts at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She continued her education by receiving her MFA in computers in fine art from the CADRE Program at San Jose State University Her dissertation, \\"Ludic Mutation: The Player's Power to Change the Game\\" was written under the supervision of Professor Dr. Mireille D. Rosello at the Amsterdam School for Cultural Analysis at the University of Amsterdam and submitted in 2012. Career Many of Schleiner's works are examples of video game art. Velvet- Strike, completed in 2002, is a modification to the military simulation game Counter-Strike. This work was created with Brody Condon and Joan Leandre. They invited other gamers to create patches, known as sprays, visual cyber graffiti that users would download, install, and use by shooting the sprays instead of bullets and the protest would then appear in the game. Velvet-Strike was featured in the 2004 Whitney Biennial. Another example of video game art, Operation Urban Terrain (OUT): A Live Action Wireless Gaming Urban Intervention mixes alternate reality gaming with public performance. Using a portable internet connection, a projector and a team of technicians, the artist critiqued the Military Operations in Urban Territory (MOUT) military policies by playing and projecting America's Army at several places within New York City during the ongoing Republican National Convention of 2004. In 2003, her work H711 was included in an exhibition at the New Museum. Schleiner is credited with originating the concept of 'Ludic Mutation', which addresses the role that players of videogames take in changing a game. This happens in two registers, both in the design of the game itself, which is acknowledged as changed through the player's production and most especially in the reception of a game, which may mutate meaning away from the game author's original intent. As such it can be read as a challenge to the theory of procedural rhetoric, and as a contribution to the activist game and newsgame strands of so-called 'Games for Change'. Ludic Mutation also forms the sub-heading of her 2017 book 'The Player's Power to Change the Game: Ludic Mutation.' =Teaching= Schleiner currently teaches at the Department of Design, University of California, Davis.

The wharf, marked I, served both sets of warehouses Cox & Hammond's Quay was a wharf located in the City of London, on the north bank of the River Thames a short distance downstream from London Bridge. It was originally two separate quays, Cox's Quay (also known as Cox's Key or Cock's Key) and Hammond's Quay, separated by Gaunt's Quay. On the landward side, the wharf was accessed via Lower Thames Street just behind the site of the church of St Botolph Billingsgate. Origins The wharf encompassed three of the twenty Legal Quays of the City of London, designated in the Act of Frauds of 1559. They were given state authorisation to serve as official landing and loading points for traders. Cox's Quay was designated as being \\"altogether for foreigners' goods who had merchandizes and lodgings\\" and Gaunt's Quay was \\"for landing of barrell fyshe and suche like havinge no crane\\". The three quays already existed at that time, though the date of their establishments is not known. They were among the smallest of the legal quays and had a combined frontage of only ‚Äì for Cox's Quay, for Gaunt's Quay and for Hammond's Quay. All three quays appear to have been named after owners; during the reign of Elizabeth I of England, Cox's Quay was recorded as having been demised from Richard Coke to Anne Cooke, either of which could have been the source of the quay's name. Gaunt's Quay was at some point absorbed into Hammond's Quay, and Cox and Hammond's Quays were both subsequently united.Henry A Harben, 'Cousen's Lane ‚Äì Crachemilles', in A Dictionary of London (London, 1918), https://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/dictionary-of-london/cousens-lane- crachemilles#h2-0017 (accessed 16 March 2015).Henry A Harben, 'Garlickhithe ‚Äì George (St.) in Pudding Lane', in A Dictionary of London (London, 1918), https://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/dictionary-of-london/garlickhithe- george-in-pudding-lane#h2-0013 (accessed 16 March 2015).Henry A Harben, 'Hall's Rents, St. Katherine's ‚Äì Hand Alley', in A Dictionary of London (London, 1918), https://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/dictionary-of- london/halls-rents-st-katherines-hand-alley#h2-0012 (accessed 16 March 2015). The 18th century ownership of Gaunt's and Cox's Quays was somewhat unusual in that they were both owned and managed by a professional lighterman. Hammond's Quay was owned for several centuries by the Vintners' Company, to which it had been bequeathed in 1439 by Thomas Crofton. He transferred his responsibilities as a trustee to the Company in exchange for an agreement that it would celebrate a service for the dead or dirige annually on 3 May at St Botolph Billingsgate. In 1792 the Company attempted to offer the lease to the East India Company, which declined. Another man obtained the lease but in turn reassigned it to the East India Company in 1796.Crawford, p. 176 19th and 20th centuries The two quays were bought out by the Treasury in 1805 for a cost of nearly ¬£43,000 (equivalent to ¬£ today). In 1836 the wharfinger John Knill, who owned Fresh Wharf immediately to the north, took over Cox's and Hammond's Quay as a tenant. He had a new warehouse constructed over Cox's Quay in 1842. Knill occupied five of the warehouses at Cox & Hammond's Quay in 1857, using them for fruit and non-hazardous goods, with eight more warehouses occupied by other tenants. They were described as all being of brick and in good repair, \\"age considered\\". In 1869 it was reported that the wharf was to undergo rebuilding and unification with the neighbouring Botolph Wharf. John Knill & Company (subsequently the Fresh Wharf Company) purchased the wharf outright in 1876. In the 1930s, the Fresh Wharf Company leased the whole of the river frontage from Cox and Hammond's Quay to London Bridge Wharf. The warehouses of Fresh Wharf and Cox and Hammond's Quay were damaged during the Second World War by a V-1 flying bomb strike that demolished the nearby Nicholson's Wharf. They were replaced in 1953 with a ten-storey warehouse constructed as part of the expanded New Fresh Wharf, with four million cubic feet of storage space. This only lasted twenty years; with the collapse in traffic to the London docks that followed the advent of containerization the wharf was made redundant and was demolished in 1973. It was eventually replaced by St Magnus House, an office building designed by Richard Seifert that was constructed in 1978. The site of the old quayside is now part of the Thames Path.

Chef JJ is the founder of Ingrained Hospitality Concepts LLC, a collaboration of industry professionals dedicated to creating great restaurants while sharing international cuisine with amazing hospitality. The group recently opened FIELDTRIP a study of rice and grains. The quick-casual rice bowl shop in Harlem highlights rice traditions from around the world with globally-inspired flavors and techniques. Chef JJ‚Äôs signature style was inspired by the Caribbean tastes he grew up with, inspiration from his travels and his signature R+B and hip-hop playlist. Chef JJ published his first cookbook in 2018, ‚ÄúBetween Harlem and Heaven: Afro-Asian-American Cooking for Big Nights, Weeknights, and Every Day‚Äù. He serves on the James Beard Impact Programs Advisory Committee and sits on the junior board of Food Bank for New York City, taking action to end hunger. Early life and education Johnson was born in 1984 in Long Island, New York, but spent his youth in the Poconos, where at the age of seven he was inspired to become a chef. After seeing a commercial for the Culinary Institute of America, Johnson told his mother that he wanted to become a chef. But, it was only after watching his Puerto Rican grandmother serve up butternut squash soup and other ethnic dishes, that he knew he had to. Career After graduating from the Culinary Institute of America, Johnson spent time in Ghana studying West African cuisine, before returning to cook at several New York City restaurants, including Tropico, Jane, Tribeca Grill, and Centro Vinoteca. In 2011, Johnson (26) competed and won Bravo's Rocco's Dinner Party cooking competition, quickly catching the eye of restaurateur Alexander Smalls. Smalls invited Johnson to breakfast to introduce the concept of Afro-Asian cooking to him. A year later, Johnson joined Smalls on an extended trip to Ghana, where they prepared a series of American-themed dinners. Upon their return, Smalls and Johnson developed 36 different menus that would ultimately be narrowed down to one Afro-Asian inspired menu for The Cecil in 2013. Since its opening, the restaurant has garnered several awards including \\"Best New Restaurant in America (Esquire). Johnson himself was ranked among Forbes‚Äô 30 Under 30 in the Food & Wine category (2014), Zagat‚Äôs 30 Under 30 (2014) and Eater's Young Guns (2014). Johnson and Smalls also co-authored the Afro-Asian inspired cookbook, Between Harlem and Heaven. In 2018, Johnson became the chef at The Henry at Life Hotel in Manhattan, with a menu that focuses on African diaspora cuisine. In 2019, Chef JJ and Ingrained Hospitality opened FIELDTRIP, a quick casual rice bowl shop in Harlem. FieldTrip is a celebration of rice and culture showcasing global flavors through bowls of freshly milled, unbleached, and un-enriched rices. They are the ‚Äúgranddaddy‚Äù heirloom grains of rices we commonly know today and each has its own history. FieldTrip‚Äôs mantra, Rice is Culture, was born out of a realization that rice can be found at the center of tables of so many cultures around the world. Rice connects people. The cuisine is influenced by global flavors from Asia to Africa to America and the Caribbean.

Her style is characterized by the simplification of forms, rhythmic designs, and use of vibrant colors. Biography Nell Choate Jones was born in Hawkinsville in Pulaski County, Georgia. Her birth name was Nell Hinton Choate, and she was the daughter of Sarah Cornelia Roquemore and James Dearborn Choate, who served in the Confederate army as Captain during the Civil War (1861‚Äì65). Her cousin was Macon architect Ellamae Ellis League, and she was also a distant relative of Nell Choate Shute, the first wife of artist Ben Shute. Nell's father died when she was four, and the family moved to Brooklyn, New York. She lived much of her life in Brooklyn until her death at the age of 101. Jones taught preschool and elementary school for many years. It wasn't until the 1920s that she began to study art at the encouragement of her husband Eugene A. Jones, a painter and etcher. She studied with Fred J. Boston, John Carlson, and Ralph Johonnot. She exhibited jointly with her husband in 1927 at Holt Gallery in New York City. Her impressionist scenes received considerable acclaim. In 1929, she attended the art school at Fontainebleau School of Fine Arts in Fontainebleau, France on scholarship and later studied in England.James, A. E., Reed, D. V., Adelman, E.

Her artwork often makes use of an architectural vocabulary to explore psychological space, depicting vaults, stairs, and ziggurats in her paintings and drawings. Mitchell works abstractly in drawing and painting in various media, and has exhibited in museums and galleries, both nationally and abroad, including The American Academy and Institute of Arts & Letters in New York, 1979, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D. C., 1996.askART, Katherine Mitchell  Personal life  Mitchell married Edward Ross, a fellow painter, who also served as Mitchell's teacher. Ross died in 1976.

Life  Amalia Ulman was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1989 and was raised in Gij√≥n, in the Spanish province of Asturias, after emigrating with her family. In 2009, she left Spain to study at Central Saint Martins in London, where she graduated in 2011. In 2013, she was in a serious Greyhound bus accident that left her with a permanent disability. As of 2020, Ulman lives and works in New York City. Work Her work deals with issues of class, gender, and sexuality. Ulman is particularly interested in middlebrow aesthetics. In 2012, Ulman presented Profit  Decay, a show held with Katja Novitskova at the gallery Arcadia Missa in London. In April 2013, she presented her first video essay Buyer, Walker, Rover as a Skype lecture at the Regional State Archives in Gothenburg. In 2014, she presented two solo shows in LA, CA, Used & New at ltd Los Angeles and Delicious Works at Smart Objects, also in LA. She also presented a solo show, Baby Footprints Crow‚Äôs Feet, at Ellis King, in Dublin.Ulman's cv. The same year Ulman started \\"Excellences & Perfections\\", a four-month performance on her Instagram account. Through her posts, Ulman fabricated a fictional character whose story unfolded in three different episodes presenting her acting as three different personas: a 'cute girl', then a 'sugar babe' and finally a 'life goddess'. \\"The idea was to bring fiction to a platform that has been designed for supposedly \\"authentic\\" behavior, interactions and content. The intention was to prove how easy an audience can be manipulated through the use of mainstream archetypes and characters they've seen before.\\"Francesca Gavin, Kaleidoscope#23, Winter 2015. Ulman's Instagram selfies were mainly taken sneaking into hotels and restaurants in Los Angeles and posted as if they documented her real life.Emilie Friedlander The Fader, November 2014 Ulman‚Äôs exhibition \\"Excellences and Perfections,\\" throughout the process was met with dissatisfied feedback. Ulman's exhibition which was meant to show the presence of gender and sex politics on social media, caused outcries with many critics saying that Ulman was throwing her career away. It was not until after the exhibition was over, signaled with an Instagram post of a black and white image of a rose captioned \\"the end,\\" that Ulman began receiving positive feedback on her work in this exhibition. Excellences and Perfections was later chosen to be a part of the Electronic Superhighway Exhibition at Whitechapel Gallery in 2016. In October 2014, during Frieze Art Fair, Ulman presented a solo show The Destruction of Experience at Evelyn Yard in London. For the show Ulman made \\"The Future Ahead\\", a video essay about Justin Bieber's \\"growth from angelic teenager to hetero-normative white male\\". In January 2015, she presented Stock Images of War, her first solo show in New York City at James Fuentes Gallery. It consisted of an immersive installation composed of twelve simple wire-frame sculptures, each one being after a different month of the year ‚Äì i.e. \\"War in January\\", \\"War in February\\", etc. Towards the end of the same year, Ulman started Privilege, her second Instagram performance, which would last until over a year until shortly after the 2016 U.S. presidential election. As opposed to Excellences & Perfections, where Ulman enacted an entirely fictitious character, Privilege saw the artist become an exaggerated version of herself and the multiplicities of her real identity, enacted mostly in the setting of a corporate office. Throughout the performance, Ulman created a diverse array of visual materials from New Yorker-style cartoons exploring ideas of class and taste to short memetic videos and images derived from office culture and the cultural climate of the time. Central to the performance were notions of ambiguity and expectations, primarily exemplified by the build-up of Ulman's fictional pregnancy as well as the introduction of an enigmatic pigeon named \\"Bob\\", who veered between real and fake animal, hobby and obsession of the artist, and between performance companion and protagonist to sidekick. In 2016 \\"Excellences and Perfections\\" was selected to be included in the group exhibition Performing for the Camera at Tate Modern, London (18 February ‚Äî 12 June 2016). The exhibition, which examined the relationship between photography and performance, brought together over 500 works spanning 150 years from the invention of photography in the 19th century to the selfie-culture of today. Through Ulman's Instagram-based project, social media was examined in the historical context of photographic performances. The installation was also part of the exhibition Electronic Highway at Whitechapel Gallery in London. Ulman has thus been described as the first social network-based artist to enter top institutional galleries. In 2018, Excellences & Perfections was published as a book by Prestel. It includes the Instagram posts that she used for the project and essays by German artist Hito Steyerl, editor Rob Horning and others.

Origin of the name  The naming of the mountains as Die Wilden, \\"the Wild Ones\\" probably comes from the valley of Kleinwalsertal to the north, because they do not appear to be of agricultural value from that side. They were first mentioned in 1783 as the Wilden K√∂pf in Blasius Hueber's Vorarlberg map. The name of \\"Schafalpenk√∂pfe\\" comes from the south and refers to the rocky summits (Felsk√∂pfe) above the alpine sheep pastures (Sch√§falpen) of the Taufersbergalpe, an alpine meadow. The name first appears as Sch√§falpenkopf and Sch√§falpenk√∂pfl in 1819 in an old survey sheet of the Bavarian State Office for Survey and Geoinformation in Munich. An 1844 description of the border includes the words: √ºber den ersten Schafalpenkopf, √ºber den zweiten Schafalpenkopf, bis zu dem dritten Schafalpenkopf (\\"over the first Schafalpenkopf, over the second Schafalpenkopf to the third Schafalpenkopf\\").

Her work is characterized by its psychedelic colors, such as pink, purple, blue, and especially red. Jin uses the image of the banana plant in her work to explore beauty, fertility, and sexuality. While she has primarily produced oils on canvas, Cai has painted on such materials as mattresses, silk quilts, cushions, women‚Äôs shoes, bicycle seats, and bath tubs. Her paintings explore vitality and beauty. In 2008, Cai deviated from her focus on the banana plant and began work on a series of landscape paintings.

He served as the rabbi of Temple Beth Emet in Burbank, California from 1965 to 1996.Temple Beth Emet: History When he stepped down, he was replaced by Rabbi Mark H. Sobel. According to Rabbi Sobel, \\"Probably some 80 percent of the Jews in the San Fernando Valley had a relative or friend who was married, buried or bar mitzvahed by Rabbi Bill.\\" He conducted over 10,000 weddings, including many interfaith weddings. In the latter instance, he insisted that children be raised in the Jewish faith. During his rabbinate at Temple Beth Emet, he also conducted a weekly minyan, or prayer, at Congregation Adat Shalom in Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles. He also led a \\"cyberspace\\" named B'nai Bill. Academic career He was an associate professor of religious studies at the California State University, Northridge for two decades, where he established the Jewish Studies program. He also taught classes at the University of Judaism in Bel Air, the University of Southern California, the University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles City College.

Stone's work explores how technology changes the relationship between humans and our surroundings, and how those relationships have the potential to shape our future. She fuses the concepts of performance art, made popular in the 1960s, with digital imaging and other modern forms of expression. As one of the first women to be involved in the new media arts in Canada, her large- scale projects influenced many artists she mentored.  Early career  Stone graduated from the University of Manitoba in 1985. In art school, she originally began as a painter, \\"but that didn't last long\\" (according to Stone). Many middle and late 20th century philosophers and artists whose work centers around the collision of art, science, and humanity inspired Stone. She began working on interactive pieces in 1989, after encouragement from Richard Dyck, a fellow Winnipeg, technologically-focused artist, and the piece Legacy was born. Legacy, finished in 1993, is a child's room, one wall representing a stereotypical girl and the other representing a stereotypical boy, exploring gender roles of young children. The viewer can interact with the installation through a computer game that cries out \\"Come play with me,\\" begging for human interaction.  Work  Since the early 1990s, Stone has focused almost exclusively on interactive, technologically based art forms, using technology to isolate and explore specific properties of the human experience. Notably, she has done work with \\"the misogynistic world of video games, the disciplinary effects of medical science, the stimulation of human intelligence and affect in robotics, and the visual modeling of protein molecules.\\" Her \\"most ambitious piece\\" (according to Robert Enright) is Imaginal Expression, which appeared in a featured exhibition at the Winnipeg Art Gallery in 2004. In this piece, she shaped parts of her own body (hair, skin, fingers) into protein molecules projected as moving images on a 9' x 48' screen. Stone sees Imaginal Expression as a visual form of potential for \\"genetic re-mapping and re-engineering.\\" Carnevale 3.0, finished 2002, mirrors human consciousness by taking pictures of viewers in the gallery that are either stored or \\"forgotten\\" as a way to simulate human memory. The robot figure is inspired by a picture of Stone, herself, as a young girl. This choice was very intentional, according to Stone, and attempts to works against the \\"image of women in cyber culture.\\" sentientBody, 1998, uses Stone's own disembodied breathing matched with images of water and sand \\"to both realize and dematerialize the existence of the body\\" (according to Enright). Stone has been featured in numerous solo exhibitions as well many group exhibitions. She is also featured in six public collections in Canada and private collections throughout Canada and the United States. Awards and recognitions Stone was inducted into the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 2007. Carnevale 3.0 was recognized by Life 5.0, Art & Artificial Life International Competition, Fundaci√≥n Telef√≥nica in Madrid, Spain with an honorable mention. In 2015, she received a Governor General's Awards in Visual and Media Arts.

Israel and the PLO began to engage in the late 1980s and early 1990s in what became the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process, culminated with the Oslo Accords in 1993. Shortly after, the Palestinian National Authority was established and during the next 6 years formed a network of economic and security connections with Israel, being referred to as a fully autonomous region with self-administration. In the year 2000, the relations severely deteriorated with the eruption of the Al-Aqsa Intifada ‚Äì a rapid escalation of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. The events calmed down in 2005, with reconciliation and cease fire. The situation became more complicated with the split of the Palestinian Authority in 2007, the violent split of Fatah and Hamas factions, and Hamas' takeover of the Gaza Strip. The Hamas takeover resulted in a complete rift between Israel and the Palestinian faction in the Gaza Strip, cancelling all relations except limited humanitarian supply. Background =Economy= As of 2015. Israel's GDP per capita is more than $35,000, and the unemployment rate is at 5%. Israel maintains a strong currency and has the best protection of property rights of all the economic systems in the Middle East. Israel is a member of the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), and is also known as the \\"entrepreneurship country\\". Due to historical reasons, Palestine has not been able to form a completely independent economic system. Foreign direct investment is almost non-existent. Israel is ranked 22 on the UN's Human Development Index ranking of 177 countries, while Palestine is ranked 119. In addition to agriculture, Palestine's main economic income is aid from the international community and Palestinian labor in Israel or other places. Joint economic cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians officials has experienced growth over the past years. Starting in 2008, Cisco Systems began a concerted effort to jump-start the nascent Palestinian IT sector with a holistic ecosystem approach, encompassing venture capital, private equity, capacity building and direct outsourcing to Palestinian companies. The company invested $15 million toward that end and drew in other major international investors and donors, including Microsoft, HP and Google. The Palestinian IT sector has since grown from 0.8% of GDP in 2008 to 5% in 2010.Cisco Pioneers Market Development Approach in Palestine, Mission Measurement, June 2012 Olives of Peace is a joint Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian business venture to sell olive oil. Through this project, Israelis and Palestinians have carried out joint training sessions and planning.‚ÄúIsrael-Palestinian cooperation a decision that makes sense from the economic point of view‚Äù, Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (KAS) a political foundations in germany for Mideast dialogue and cooperation, 26 October 2008. The oil is sold under the brand name \\"Olives of Peace.\\"New joint Israeli-Palestinian olive oil brand launched, Ynet news, 20 March 2007 In October 2009, a new government-funded project launched promoting tourism and travel between the two areas. New business efforts and tourist attractions have been initiated in Jenin. The two regions are planning a joint industrial zone which would bridge the border. Palestinians would produce locally-made handicrafts and sell them through Gilboa to other regions of the world. Another possible project is a joint language center, where Israelis and Palestinians would teach each other Arabic and Hebrew, as well as aspects of their cultural heritage. Since 2010, Israeli high-tech companies have employed Palestinian engineers. To date, the majority of them are outsourced workers, but Mellanox, a computer hardware firm, plans to hire 15‚Äì20 Palestinian engineers as regular employees. In 2011, bilateral trade between Israel and the Palestinian-ruled areas reached $4.3 billion, with Israeli exports to the PA amounting to $3.5 billion and Palestinian exports to Israel amounting to $816 million. According to Nader Tamimi, chair of the Association of Traditional Industries in the PA, there are regular interactions between Palestinian and Israeli businessmen. At a conference hosted by the Faculty of Business and Management at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in 2012, Israeli and Palestinian trade experts met to discuss ways of promoting cross-border business interactions. = Politics = The political relationship is rooted in conflict between Israel and Palestine. The conflict is over whether or not Palestinians should be able to form its own separate country in government within a part of the land that is currently controlled by Israel. Palestine, in the years before 1948, was a piece of land surrounded by the Jordan River, Egypt, the Mediterranean Sea, Syria and Lebanon. The battle over this specific area of land has arisen due to contrasting views on who has a valid claim to the land. According to Jews, the Hebrew Bible states that Palestine has been promised to them by God. Modern day Palestine was ancient Israel. Thus, Jews have an ancient claim to the land. However, Palestinian Arabs are unwilling and unable to acknowledge their claim of Israel. Palestinians believe that because they were in most recent control of the land, it should stay in their possession. The continual conflict between Israel and Palestine regarding their inability to acknowledge the other's claims to territory has resulted in many years of violence and instability in the region. The area of land that has caused political conflict between Israel and Palestinian also affects international relations. Israel/Palestine is strategically located at the crossroads of Asia, Europe and Africa. This has caused the United States and other nations to come together in the hopes of finding a solution to the conflict. However, a solution to the conflict is currently still evasive. Israel and the United States perceive the military actions of Hamas as terrorist aggression, and cite Israeli national defense as the rationale for Israel's aggressive military response. On the other hand, Palestinians view the actions of the Israeli military as state-sponsored terrorism. Both sides continue to suffer casualties as the impasse over territorial rights in the region continues. This conflict spills over into the regional and international communities, with both sides drawing support and military aide. Current status =Economic relations= Israel desires a strong economic system for Palestine. The Israeli government has created and distributed areas to expand Palestine's trade system, which includes import/export passages, information, specific economic sectors and transportation. Israel also encourages Palestinian investment in Israel. The Israeli government has promised to provide risk insurance and long term visiting permits to the Palestinian investors. As of 2015, Israel and Palestinian administration in the West Bank continue in partial economic relations, including limited bilateral trade, transfer of goods from and to Palestine via Israel (in which Israel collects the imports taxes and transfers to Palestinians), limited electricity and water sales from Israel to Palestinians and admission of Palestinian workers from the West Bank to work in Israel on daily basis. In 2013, commercial trade between Israel and the Palestinian Authority were valued at US$20 billion annually. The continuously increasing transactions led to the creation of the joint Palestinian and Israeli initiative, the Jerusalem Arbitration Center (JAC). The center will specialize as an independent institution focusing on business arbitration between Israelis and Palestinians. Before the most recent conflict, many Palestinians were unemployed, resulting in a struggling Palestinian economy. As of 2014, this has only worsened, with 1 out 6 Palestinians left jobless. The World Bank Country Director for West Bank and Gaza Steen Lau Jorgensen has stated, \\"Without immediate action by the Palestinian Authority, donors and the Government of Israel to re-vitalize the economy and improve the business climate, a return to violence as we have seen in recent years will remain a clear and present danger.\\" In January 2015, Israel withheld tax transfers to the Palestinians in response to the Palestinian membership application to the International Criminal Court. Activists in Abbas' Fatah movement countered it by enforcing a boycott of goods made by Israeli food companies. = Security coordination = Palestinian security forces in the West Bank have retained limited security relations with the Israeli counterparts in the IDF and Shin Bet since re-establishment of relations in 2005. The parties cooperate on prevention of Hamas and Islamic Jihad activity in the West Bank, which is considered a threat by both parties. In March 2015, the PLO Central Council adopted a resolution calling the Palestinian President to cease cooperation of Palestinian security forces with Israel in light of severing economic and political relations. In October 2015, tensions rose, resulting in thirty-two Palestinians and seven Israelis being killed in two weeks. The unrest was a result of Palestinians‚Äô resentment over heightened Israeli intrusion on the al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem. A UN spokesman denounced Israel's actions on the matter, and stated that UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \\"would find that the apparent excessive use of force by Israeli security forces is also troubling and demands serious review, as it only serves to exacerbate the situation, leading to a vicious cycle of needless bloodshed.\\" =Water resources= The history of international water relations in the Middle East dates back to 2500 BCE, when two Sumerian city-states solved a dispute over water along the Tigris River.\\"Transboundary Waters\\", \\"UNDESA\\", 2004-2006. Since then, negotiations have come a long way. In the last century, the focus of treaty-making over water has shifted towards the use, development and conservation of resources. The Mountain Aquifer constitutes one of Israeli and Palestinian chief water sources.Jad Isaac, \\"Core Issues of the Palestinian Israeli Water Dispute\\" , ARIJ The Mountain Aquifer begins in the North of Israel and flows from the West Bank to the Mediterranean. The aquifer is composed of three groundwater basins: the western basin, the eastern basin and the northern basin. The replenishment zones for these aquifers are majoritarily located east of the green line; most of the aquifers themselves as well as the storage zones are located in Israeli territory. \\"The Issue of Water Between Israel and Palestinians\\", World Bank, March 2009. The western basin, also known as the Yarkon-Taninim, is the most valuable to Israel as it has the highest storage capacity, the largest installed pumping rate, and constitutes the most of Israel's total water production from the three basins. The Jordan River is the second of Israeli and Palestinian chief water sources. The waters of this river also serve as a main water source for the surrounding Arab nations of Syria and Jordan. In 1953, in response to Arab construction of the Yarmouk dam, Israel began to construct its National Water Carrier as a means to divert the waters of the Jordan River to irrigate the coastal Sharon Plain and eventually the Negev Desert. The Arab Nations interpreted this as a threat to their stakes in the usage of the water and responded with their own plan to divert water from the Jordan River to the Yarmouk river.Avi Shlaim, The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World. \\"Penguin Books.\\" pp. 229, 230. Israel eventually backed off and moved its diversion plan elsewhere. Today each of the nations continue to draw water from the Jordan River basin. The National Water Carrier was completed by Mekorot in 1964.Zafrir Rinat, \\"Eco- logic  Israel's National Water Carrier: both boom and bane\\", Haaretz, 26 June 2014. It consists of around 134 km of large pipes, tunnels, and reservoirs and around 34 km of open canals. The water carrier channels an average of 380 MCM of water a year from the Kinneret. Water from the Jordan River flows into the Kinneret, which is how Israel uses the water carrier to divert 75% of the water from the Jordan River to Israel. The amount of fresh water that flows in the Jordan River as well as the Dead Sea has significantly declined as a result of this diversion. The Red Sea‚ÄìDead Sea Canal has been proposed as a way to remedy the shrinking, though right now it is only a proposal. After the 1967 War, Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and began to regulate water usage in the area. It set pumping quotas and made it so that wells could not be dug without a permit.LAW [\\"An Overview of the consequences of Israeli Occupation on the environment in the West Bank and Gaza‚Äù], 2000. Since 1967, permits have been granted for only 23 new wells. Since then, efforts have been made toward fulfilling the rights of Palestinians to self-determination. One such effort is called the Oslo Process, which began in 1993. A segment of this deals with water rights. The Oslo II agreement, also known as the Interim Agreement, was established in 1995. Under Oslo II, a Palestinian Water Authority was set up to manage and allocate the water supply allotted to Palestine by Israel. Oslo II also included estimations of future Palestinian water usage in an effort to come to a concrete agreement for future allocations. The Oslo treaty created a Joint Water Committee in order that the needs of both sides be represented. The committee outlined guidelines for the protection of both Israeli and Palestinian water supplies from contamination and pollution. The treaty was not meant to set permanent precedent; rather it was made as an interim period so that by its end, more concrete measures could be taken. The interim period ended in May 1999. And yet, many of the policies in place today are the same as what was outlined in the Oslo II Accords which was meant to be temporary. Current water use In 2006, fresh water consumption in Israel was equivalent to 170 cubic meters per capita per year. In the same year, Palestinian water consumption in the West Bank was measured at 100 cubic meters per capita per year. The averages in both areas as well as in surrounding Arab countries have steadily declined since 1967 due to the effects of climate change. Today, Israeli daily per capita consumption is estimated at 275 liters, while Palestinian consumption is estimated at 75 liters.\\"The Right to Water in Palestine: A Background\\" , \\"Center for Economic and Social Rights, 13 May 2015. The gap in consumption between the two groups has widened considerably in the last nine-ten years. Part of that statistic comes from the fact that 1.2 million Gazans have limited or no access to water.Elizabeth Ferris \\"Gaza: No Safe Place for Civilians\\", \\"Brookings\\" 12 July 2014 Israeli policy does not deal directly with Gaza in terms of water allocation and distribution. This is because the Gaza Aquifer, supplemented by water desalination processes, is alleged to be able to satisfy the water needs of the area. In 2010, Hamas, the current governing authority in Gaza, embarked on an infrastructure development program in order to make Gaza more self- sufficient in terms of water supply.Salman Shaikh \\"Don't Forget Gaza\\", \\"Brookings\\" 24 January 2011 The plan was not completed. Israel imposed on the plan because of suspicions that the tunnels and other infrastructure were going to be used for terrorist purposes.Shlomo Eldar \\"Israel still refuses to run water to Rawabi , \\"Al-Monitor\\" 27 October 2013 Despite the presence of the Gaza Aquifer, 90% of potentially potable water in Gaza is currently undrinkable.Amira Hass \\"The Israeli 'watergate' scandal: The facts about Palestinian water\\", \\"Haaretz\\", 16 February 2014. Overpumping is a large cause of this, as Gazans do not have the correct tools and infrastructure to utilize their water source. Israel does supply water, however, to the West Bank. Israel sells water to the West Bank at a rate of 53 MCM (million cubic meters) of water per year.\\"Discriminatory Water Supply, \\"B'Tselem - The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories\\" Palestinians in the West Bank purchase about one third of their total water supply from Mekorot, Israel's national water agency. As is also true for Israel, most water is consumed in the Agricultural sector of the West Bank.Joe Stork \\"Water and Israel's Occupation Strategy, \\"Middle East Research and Information Project\\" Only about 5% of the West Bank is agricultural land. Under the Oslo II Accord, 80% of water from the above named sources goes to Israel, and 20% to the Palestinians living in the West Bank. Some argue that one reason Israel is so strict and careful with its water policy is because of how vulnerable the water supply naturally is. According to an Israeli Water Commission memorandum, \\"incorrect application of drilling on the West Bank could salinize the water reservoirs of the State of Israel.\\" International law Since 1955, Jordan and Israel have held regular talks over the sharing of the Jordan River. International law considers states and institutions created by states as the only legitimate actors, which explains why Palestinians have not been as much a part of the conversation as some might argue they should be.David B. Brooks and Julie Trottier, \\"An Agreement to Share Water Between Israelis and Palestinians: the FoEME proposal\\", \\"FoEME\\", March 2012 The ambiguity of international law tends to unintentionally favor Israel in this way: it is an established state while Palestinians are not yet united as a sovereign, internationally recognized entity. Experts have argued that water laws ought to be more concrete though this seems difficult because of the variation in each geographic space and each political situation. There is no formula for exactly how to divide up the waters. Some guidelines do exist, however, as a frame of reference . Many rules of law pertaining to shared water resources follow the precedent of The Helsinki Rules, an international guideline on the regulation of transnational rivers and their groundwaters. These rules rely on five principles: \\"reasonable and equitable utilization, avoidance of significant harm to other users or states, advance notification, consultation and negotiation,exchange of information, peaceful settlements of disputes.\\" These principles are largely seen as soft or customary law. After the Helsinki Rules were published, the U.N. began to research the topic of international water law which culminated in the formulation of the 1997 UN Convention on the NonNavigational Uses of International Watercourses. This convention, like the Helsinki Rules, is also largely considered customary law. The aquifers under dispute in Israel-Palestine are transboundary aquifers: in which a political boundary is between the outflow and recharge areas. The international laws can be used toward policy making, though nothing concrete has yet been ratified. =Healthcare coordination= During Coronavirus crisis On 11 March, Israel delivered 20 tons of disinfectant to the West Bank. On 17 March, the Defense Ministry tightened restrictions on Palestinian workers, limiting entry to those working in essential sectors, and requiring that they remain in Israel instead of commuting. Also, Israel and the Palestinian Authority set up a joint operations room to coordinate response to the virus. On 25 March, the Palestinian Authority urged all Palestinians working in Israel to return to the West Bank. All those returning were requested to self-isolate.

It was created as part of a campaign by Ceracchi to build a larger monument to Washington. The bust was thought by many to be one of the most lifelike. It was later used as a model of Washington for works by other sculptors and engravers. History In the spring of 1791, Ceracchi came to Philadelphia, then the seat of the United States government, in an attempt to get a commission from Congress for a \\"Monument designed to perpetuate the Memory of American Liberty\\" featuring an equestrian statue of Washington. While waiting for congressional action, he made bust portrait models of several of the founding fathers, such as John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton. Initially, Washington did not want to pose for the sculptor, but eventually did so in late 1791, early 1792. Ceracchi left for Europe in 1792, and then returned to Philadelphia in 1794. He then had Washington sit for him again in 1795 to finish the marble bust he sculpted while in Italy, copied from the earlier plaster portrait bust he sculpted from life late 1791, early 1792. Description Ceracchi portrayed Washington in the style of a Roman emperor, with short wavy hair, wearing a toga, which is pinned by a rosette brooch. Inscription The original work is inscribed on the back in Latin, \\"CERACCHI FACIEBAT PHILADELPHIAE, 1795\\" (\\"Ceracchi made this in Philadelphia, 1795\\"). Legacy Washington refused to accept the gift of this bust from Ceracchi in 1795, though it was displayed in the president's residence until the sculptor presented him with a bill of $1,500 for it that spring, at which point the bust was sent back to Ceracchi. However, the bust was then bought by the Spanish minister, Josef de Jaudenes y Nebot, and shipped to Spain. It was next bought by Richard W. Meade, an art collector, who brought it back to Philadelphia. After his death, it was acquired by Gouverneur Kemble of Cold Spring, New York. Subsequently it was in the collection of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. In 1904, it was purchased by John Lambert Cadwalader. After his death in 1914, it was bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where it is now displayed in the American Wing. In 1809, Thomas Appleton, an American consul in Italy, acquired the original plaster portrait bust. Later, this was used by the Italian sculptor Massimiliano Ravenna to create several marble copies. About 1816, one of these was bought by the White House for $80 and is now located there. In December 1815, North Carolina commissioned a statue of Washington by Antonio Canova. Thomas Jefferson recommended that he use this bust by Ceracchi as a model for the head. The statue was delivered in 1821 and displayed in the rotunda of the North Carolina State House, but both were destroyed by fire in 1831. The bust was also used as a model for engravings of Washington. One such engraving was included in the Life of George Washington by Washington Irving.

Biography Ze'eva Cohen grew up in Tel Aviv, the daughter of Yemenite immigrants. She traveled to New York City in 1963 to study at the Juilliard School and perform with the Anna Sokolow Dance Company. She danced with the company for ten years. Dance career Cohen was a founding member of Dance Theater Workshop, where she worked as a choreographer and dancer from the mid-sixties to the early seventies. She has created a body of choreographic work which links her background in American modern dance with her Yemenite Jewish heritage. In 1971, she initiated her solo dance repertory program, which toured throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and Israel for twelve years under the auspices of the National Endowment for the Arts Residency Touring Dance Program. Her solo repertory included commissioned works, reconstructions, and her original choreography comprising twenty-eight solos by twenty-three choreographers, among them Viola Farber, Elizabeth Keen, Phyllis Lahmut, Daniel Nagrin, Margalit Oved, Anna Sokolow, and James Waring. In 1983, she founded Ze‚Äôeva Cohen and Dancers, a dance company for which she developed a group repertory. The group performed in New York and on national tours of the U.S., and premiered such works by Cohen as Rainwood, Walkman Variations, and Shifting Ground. Cohen has also choreographed commissioned works for the Boston Ballet, Munich Tanzproject, Batsheva Dance Company, Inbal Dance Theater of Israel, The Alvin Ailey Repertory Dance Company, North Carolina Dance Theater, and other national dance companies. Since 1996, she has been choreographing, producing, and performing programs dealing with cultural, political, and social issues, and focusing on women‚Äôs myths and lives. These programs include Negotiations and Female Mythologies performed at theaters such as Danspace Project. In this period she created such works as Negotiations and Jeptha's Daughter. In 1969, when Princeton University first admitted women undergraduates and Michael Mao pushed for dance to be accepted as a physical education credit, Cohen was asked to teach and build a dance program in the context of the Princeton Program in Theater and Dance. Academic credit for dance classes began in 1972. She served as Head of Dance until June 2008, and was joined on the faculty by colleagues such as modern dance choreographers Sally Hess, Elizabeth Keen, Jim May, and Mark Taylor. In 1971, Cohen was recruited by the International Baccalaureate Organization to assemble a committee of international artists and educators to create curriculum and assessment criteria for Dance. This has become an ongoing activity involving international teacher training workshops and overseeing the application of the assessment criteria and standards in final examinations. Awards and recognition Cohen is the subject of a documentary film Ze‚Äôeva Cohen: Creating A Life In Dance directed by Sharon Kaufman, which premiered at the Dance on Camera Festival at Lincoln Center in February 2015. The film presents a model of how an artist can survive in the dance world by carving an independent path as a dancer, choreographer, and educator.

They also took in Doris, After kissing his deathly ill father, Edwin Harleston died of pneumonia in 1931. Elise closed her studio and remarried within a year, to schoolteacher John J. Wheeler. She moved to Baltimore, then to Chicago, and then to Southern California, where she remained until her death from a brain aneurysm in 1970. According to her great-niece, Edwina's daughter Mae Whitlock Gentry, she never spoke of her relationship with Edwin or her work as a photographer. After Harleston's death in 1970, her family found Edwin's letters and a cache of almost two dozen glass plate negatives that she had saved. Many of her papers are now held by Emory University's Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library. References Further reading * Ball, Edward.

She was best known for her illustrations of children's books as well as designs of book covers and plates. Education 1902 book binding designed by Amy Sacker; original held by the University of North Carolina Greensboro Library, Special Collections and Archives Sacker was born in Boston on July 17, 1872. As a student at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in Boston from 1889 to 1894, Sacker studied under well-known architect, designer, and instructor Charles Howard Walker as well as Joseph DeCamp and Joseph Lindon Smith. In 1892 she won a scholarship for her exemplary work and in 1893 she won a prize for the highest average. Upon graduation, Sacker began teaching decorative design at the Cowles Art School. In 1901, Sacker founded her own school named the Sacker School of Design and Interior Decoration, where she taught for over 40 years. Work Amy Sacker looking at her art show Her designs were used on book covers (which sometimes showed up as designs on book jackets) and bookplates, which were also sometimes reused as magazine covers. She designed book covers for several local publishers including Joseph Knight, Estes & Lauriat, L.C. Page & Co, Houghton Mifflin, and Little, Brown. She developed a style that distinguished her from other female contemporaries, such as Sarah Wyman Whitman and Margaret Neilson Armstrong. She illustrated books with figurative compositions that occupied the entire front instead of typical ornamental patterns. Domestic publishers used her designs several times for different books. Sacker won a bronze medal in 1901 for her book covers at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo and a medal in 1930 for her book plates at the Boston Tercentenary Fine Arts and Crafts Exhibition. Beyond book design Sacker applied her artistic skills to a wide range of other arts, including, illustrations, paintings, jewelry, basketry, leatherworking, portraiture, and greeting cards. In 1899, Sacker was elected a master craftsman as a designer, illustrator, and leather worker in the Society of Arts and Crafts. Through her work in this institution, Sacker met several of the leading women artists of the day, including Sarah Wyman Whitman and Marion Peabody. She gave instruction at Simmons College, made study tours to Europe and took part in several exhibitions across the USA. Together with her former teachers Walker and Smith Sacker served on the jury for a Boston exhibition in 1912. Sacker ended finally in the mid-1940s her work with her namesake school to focus on projects for the Red Cross.

It was fought between the Ulster Army under Owen Roe O'Neill and a largely Protestant government force from Dublin under Lord Moore, with both sides proclaiming their basic loyalty to Charles I. In the battle the two armies exchanged artillery fire, during which Moore was killed and his army driven off, giving the Confederates victory. Background Following their rebellion in 1641 Irish Catholics had formed a confederation declaring their support for the King in his Civil War with the London Parliament, claiming that the authorities in Dublin had sided with the Roundheads against the King's interest in both Ireland and England. The Confederates aimed to secure concessions for the Catholic church, while many Protestant royalists regarded the Confederates as rebels who had committed a series of massacres, and at the time were as opposed to them as to the Roundheads. During summer 1643 O'Neill's Ulster Army had moved south into Leinster following their defeat at the Battle of Clones. Alongside local Confederate forces they captured a series of Protestant-garrisoned towns notably Ballybeg where they seized a large quantity of supplies and Protestant hostages.Casway, p. 85. O'Neill force was reinforced with troops from Longford under Richard O'Farell. The plundering of the area by O'Neill's forces led to intense hostility from local Catholic inhabitants against the Ulster Army which was to become a recurring feature during the war.Casway, p. 86. Portlester was a small settlement in Meath, east of Ballivor and southwest of Trim, which was held by royalist Protestant forces. O'Neill's troops besieged Portlester Castle, bringing up artillery to pound the defences. The defenders eventually decided to abandon their position by escaping to safety across the nearby river.Casway, p. 87. Battle O'Neill then received intelligence that a Protestant force under Lord Moore was approaching from Athboy. Moore had recently been reinforced and was eager to test the strength of O'Neill's army.Casway, pp. 76-86. Moore wished to prevent the Ulster Army from capturing more of the government's strongholds and stop further damage being done to the countryside. O'Neill's forces took up defensive positions near a ford across the river and at a nearby mill. O'Neill led some of his troops forwards until they made contact with the enemy, then withdrew hastily in an effort to draw Moore's army onto unfavourable ground. As they advanced in pursuit, the Protestant troops were raked with crossfire particularly from the mill where O'Neill had stationed musketeers. Faced with heavy fire, Moore's men withdrew. They regrouped and assaulted O'Neill's forces two additional times, but were driven back.Casway, p. 87. Moore then sent a large force to attack the mill. Heavy hand-to-hand combat took place around the position, while Moore launched further attacks on the ford. O'Neill sent in a relief column to the mill whose defenders accepted fresh ammunition but rejected the need for reinforcements and pledged to hold the position at all costs.Casway, pp. 87-88. While Moore was surveying the nearby fighting at the mill, he was struck by an artillery shot that killed him. Following their commander's death the government forces broke and fled. Some of O'Neill's troops wanted to follow them, but O'Neill rejected this as he feared that the withdrawal was a ruse and wanted to conserve his forces.Casway, p. 88. Aftermath The following morning the Protestant army retreated towards Athboy. Although there were other government troops nearby under George Monck, they were short of numbers and marched towards Trim. O'Neill rewarded the mill's defenders with gold coins for their bravery. Although the victory brought an end the series of defeats that the Ulster Army had suffered over the previous two years, the defensive battle at Portlester gave little advantage to the Confederates as they lacked the resources to attempt a further advance eastwards towards Dublin. Shortly afterwards a cessation of arms was agreed between the Dublin government of Ormond and the Irish Confederates as a first step towards negotiating a peace treaty and alliance against their mutual enemies the Roundhead forces in England. The death of Moore was likely an inspiration for the part of Tyragnes in the 1645 play Cola's Furie by Henry Burkhead which portrayed contemporary events in Ireland.Randall, p. 92.

She was known for her na√Øve art paintings, depicting Brazilian common people, religious themes and landscapes. Biography Djanira was born in Avar√©, daughter of Oscar de Paiva Pia Job Paiva was initially registered. At 23, she was hospitalized with tuberculosis in a hospital, in S√£o Jos√© dos Campos where she made her first drawing: a Christ on Golgotha. As her health improved, she continued treatment in Rio de Janeiro, residing in Santa Teresa, because of its clean air. In 1930, she rented a small house in the neighborhood and installs a family pension. One of his guests, the painter Emeric Mercier, encourages her and gives her painting lessons. Djanira also attended a night drawing course at the Liceu de Artes e Of√≠cios;, in this period she kept in touch with the couple Arpad Szenes and Maria Helena Vieira da Silva, with Milton Dacosta, Carlos Scliar, and others living in Santa Teresa and attending the art world. In the late 1930s, in the state capital, she had her first drawing evening classes in art instruction in the School of Arts and Crafts and the painter Emeric Mercier, a tenant Djanira hosts in Santa Teresa. She had contact with the artists Carlos Scliar, Milton Dacosta, √Årp√°d Szenes, Maria Helena Vieira da Silva and Jean-Pierre Chabloz, regulars of the pension, provide a stimulating environment that leads to exhibit at the 48th National Salon of Fine Arts in 1942. In following year, she held her first solo show in the Brazilian Press Association (ABI). In 1945, she traveled to New York where she meets the work of Pieter Bruegel and comes into contact with Fernand L√©ger, Joan Mir√≥ and Marc Chagall. Back in Brazil, performs the Candombl√© mural to the residence of the writer Jorge Amado, in Salvador, and a panel to the Liceu Municipal de Petropolis. Between 1953 and 1954, she study travels to the Soviet Union. Her paintings of the 40s are usually dark, using subdued tones, such as gray, brown and black, but already has a taste for geometric forms of discipline. In the following decade, her palette gets diversified, with use of vibrant colors, and some works deal with tonal gradations ranging from white to light gray. She presents in her human types an expression of solemn dignity. The artist always looks closer to the themes of his works: at the end of the 1950s, after living six months, paints Canela Indians of Maranh√£o. In 1950 during his stay in Salvador she meets Jos√© Shaw da Motta e Silva, the Motinha, civil servant, born in Salvador on January 29, 1920. She got married in Rio de Janeiro on May 15, 1952, and changes name for Djanira da Motta e Silva. Back to Rio de Janeiro, she was one of the movement's leaders of the Sal√£o Preto e Branco, an artists' protest against the high prices of the painting material. Held in 1963, the tile panel Santa Barbara, for the tunnel chapel Santa Barbara, Orange, Rio de Janeiro. In the year 1966, Cultrix company publishes an album of poems and silkscreen prints of his own. In 1977, the National Museum of Fine Arts, held a major retrospective of his work. In the 1970s, she went to the Santa Catarina coal mines to experience closely the miners' lives, and travelled to Itabira to see the iron extraction service. In 1972, she became a nun of the Carmelite Order. Djanira still worked with woodcut, engraving, and made drawings for tapestries and tiles. In production, there is the monumental tile panel for tunnel Santa Barbara chapel (1958) in Rio de Janeiro. Initially named as \\"primitive\\", gradually her work achieves greater critical acclaim. As pointed out by the art critic M√°rio Pedrosa (1900-1981), Djanira is an artist who does not improvise, do not let snatch, and, although they have a naive and instinctive appearance, her works are the result of careful preparation to reach the final solution.

In 1952, she was awarded a Yale University Norfolk Fellowship in Printmaking. In both 1960 and 1962 she received fellowship awards from the Huntington Hartford Foundation. In 1986 she was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts grant for artists' bookmaking. Career Neaderland began using the photocopier for making art during a residency at Women's Studio Workshop, WSW, in 1972 and received a residency grant from WSW in 1982. By the 1980s she had gained international recognition in the field of xerography. In 1982, Neaderland founded the International Society of Copier Artists in New York City[]. She is the author/artist of many xerographic limited edition books, some of which are still available to private collectors. Later books by Neaderland include Where Could the Dark Matter Be? and a compilation, Original Contributions, of her original pages contributed to the International Society of Copier Artists ISCA portfolios. =Collections= Neaderland's art is represented in Special Collections of MOMA, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Getty Center, Brooklyn Museum of Art, Sackner Archive of Concrete and Visual Poetry in Miami, Florida, and Jaffee Center of Art Book Art.

The Quarterly is thought to be the longest running international art assemblage project in the history of such collaborative projects. Examples of her book art and that of other collaborators in the I.S.C.A. Quarterlies book art editions are in the Special Collections and Archives of the James Branch Cabell Library on the Monroe Campus of Virginia Commonwealth University. Neaderland donated a complete set of I.S.C.A. Quarterlies to Bard College at Simon's Rock in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, along with copies of all of her books, 62 in all. The Special Collections department at the University of Iowa in Iowa City has an archive of I.S.C.A. xerographic art. Neaderland continues to make books, and she has created a book which is a catalog of her books. For thirty-five years she has used the photocopy machine as a creative tool, editioning prints and artists' books under the imprint (also known as the imprimatur) of Bone Hollow Arts, located in Brooklyn, New York. Some of Neaderland's works include Pandora's Box: 12 artists' books, The Nuclear Fan, and Force Grim Force: Violence is Legitimate Politics. Force Grim Force shows a picture of a Peruvian woman passing a Peruvian government soldier who is on patrol in Ayachucho, Peru. =Critical reception= Joanna Scott, a writer for Afterimage, discussed the \\"idiosyncratic appearances of artists' books,\\" which she thought might confound a reader/viewer unfamiliar with the content of two of the ISCA quarterlies, ISCA Quarterly: First Annual Bookworks Edition and ISCA Quarterly: Second Annual Bookworks Edition.

Leona Anderson (April 3, 1885 ‚Äì December 25, 1973) was an American silent film actress who is possibly best remembered for her 1957 shrill music album Music to Suffer By. Biography Born Leona Aronson on April 3, 1885 in St. Louis, Missouri, she was the younger sister of Broncho Billy Anderson, who co-founded Essanay Studios in Chicago in 1907. She appeared in several films for Essanay Studios without much success beginning in 1914. In 1915, she appeared with Charlie Chaplin in the Essanay Studios comedy In the Park. In 1953, Anderson revived her career in music, billing herself as \\"the world's most horrible singer\\" and becoming a favorite of comedian Ernie Kovacs and appearing several times on The Ernie Kovacs Show. Kovacs' widow, Edie Adams, later recalled that \\"She (Anderson) knew she was camp, but she was very funny, and very sweet.\\" Music critic Ned Raggett asserts \\"hearing her crack, strain, burble, and otherwise demonstrate that her singing voice is completely surplus to any requirements might either be seizure-inducing or seizure-removing, depending on how you place your speakers.\\" In 1953, Anderson recorded a single, \\"Fish,\\" for a small New York City record label. (The song would later appear on the 1997 CD collection The Ernie Kovacs Record Collection.) This led to Columbia Records to issue a 2 singles by Anderson in 1954/55.http://www.45cat.com/record/440459 This was followed by the comedic album Music to Suffer By on Unique Records in 1957, later reissued in 2011 on Trunk Records. Music to Suffer By featured Anderson slaughtering several classics and standards, such as Georges Bizet's \\"Habanera\\" from Carmen and Cole Porter's \\"I Love Paris\\", as well as new material such as \\"Rats in My Room\\" (which earned enough notoriety to be covered by Danny Neaverth and Joey Reynolds a few years later) and \\"Limburger Lover.\\" By the late 1950s, she had become widely known for her bad singing, which was apparently an act she created to mock the pompous style of serious opera singers; \\"Opera singers just can't kid themselves properly ... they can never let their voices go,\\" Anderson was quoted as saying. Anderson's final film appearance was in the 1959 William Castle-directed horror film House on Haunted Hill, starring Vincent Price. She died on December 25, 1973, aged 88, in Fremont, California.

Inspired by the Aids Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) and Women's Health Action and Mobilization (WHAM), WAC conducted protests, sit-ins, and educational campaigns and viewed civil disobedience as a mode of direct action.Women's Action Coalition--Chicago Records The mission of the group was is to make a change and take action against the barriers restraining the rights of women. There are Women's Action Coalition groups located all over the world, although many are located in the United States in the cities of Boston, San Francisco, Houston, and Los Angeles. There are also groups located in Europe and Canada.  New York  On January 28, 1992 a group of 75 to 150 women came together in New York City to talk about their frustration with their issues concerning the rights of women. They named this meeting \\"Women Strategizing in the 90's.\\" The immediate reason for the meeting was to discuss their anger that Clarence Thomas was named Supreme Court Justice even after Anita Hill's testimony that Thomas had assaulted her. The women decided to start a feminist activist group called The Women's Action Coalition.\\" They planned on modeling their group after the AID activist group ACT-UP and the Women's Health Action Coalition.\\" Their first action took place six days after that meeting at a sexual assault trial involving students from St. John's University.\\" Their Logo was a Blue Dot after the blue dot the media would put over the rape victims face when displayed on television\\" Their members founded the Drum Core which performed at all of their action movements. They also came up with the slogan \\"Let women define rape!\\" \\" By the second meeting they had 300 members. \\" They demonstrated at many other rape trials.\\"  Chicago  A WAC group was founded in Chicago, but did not last for a great deal of time. It was founded in 1992 and had fallen apart by 1994. Men were not allowed to attend the meetings but were allowed to participate all other WAC actions. Although the group was in commission for only two years the impact that they left was great. They took action by handing out free condoms and also pamphlets on how to have safe sex. They placed coffins in the streets which held the stories of women who had been murdered, and used a billboard and signed postcards to express the effects domestic violence and breast cancer have on women. Each of the WAC's all over the world included a Drum Core, which is considered an important part of the WAC. The Drum Core participates in WAC actions and all other activities.  San Francisco  The Women's Action Coalition of San Francisco was founded in August 1992. By 1992 there were about five hundred members, meeting at the Southern Exposure Gallery and speak about future creative ways they could implement their actions towards the importance of the rights of women. They started a marathon run in favor of the rights of women, and letter writing campaigns, rallies, marches, guerrilla postering, spray-painting, and contributing to the defense of abortion clinics. Their stamina of direct-action lasted for about a year. Their actions saved the community from Governor Pete Wilson's plan to cut aid to families who had dependent children. After the first year the number of members began to decline, falling to about 50 members.They were forced to move their meeting location to a small office space that was shared by another feminist group. Nonetheless, after a few months the WAC of San Francisco was unable to pay the rent and became non-existent by 1994s.  Records  The rise and fall of The Women's Action Coalitions is considered part of the third wave of feminism. Most of the records are from the first WAC, WAC of New York. The files of the WAC from other cities are scattered. Most of the records date from 1992 through 1993. The coalition's records contain their action, administrative, and subject files. They also contain T-shirts and stickers that they created and used. There are also video recordings of the actions that took place.

She has had a number of solo exhibitions, and has recently received considerable attention for her White Trash Family series, which includes over 600 miniatures painted on discarded trash.

In Charleston, she worked in historic restoration; she is currently the owner of Luxe Painting & Historic Restoration in Philadelphia. =White Trash Series= Alsbrook's White Trash series challenges perceptions of the history of the American Civil War and associated class distinctions, by creating miniature portraits of 18th century historical figures in graphite and oil paints on a base of discarded pieces of trash. Her work was sparked in part by an interest in the tradition of miniature paintings on ivory, and also by the commentary about the historical biases in art by a friend who is a women's history professor. She began developing the series in 2004, while living in Charleston, South Carolina, producing over 600 paintings in the course of ten years. So far, her work has been featured in publications such as the Huffington Post Arts, Art Nerd, and Hi Fructose and is displayed in galleries around the United States. Alsbrooks creates miniature portraits by creating an oval shape that is coated with gesso on trash. Then, she draws the image on the gesso in graphite and paints it in oils before varnishing it. She says of the process of finding materials, \\"The trash is found flat, on the street. One cannot flatten the trash. It just doesn't work. It must be found so that there are no wrinkles in the middle and the graphic should be well centered. Then, the portraits are found that are to the particular trash.\\" One of her favorite times to pick up trash is after the yearly Philadelphia Mummers Parade. =Exhibitions= *2015-16 Lost and Found: Kim Alsbrooks and Nikki Couppee, Racine Art Museum, Racine, WI. *2015 The Bigger Picture with Mary Dewitt, Jim Doherty, and Elise Dodeles, Paul Robeson Center for the Arts, Princeton *2014 Last Memories: The End of My White Trash Paintings, Snyderman-Works Gallery, Philadelphia, PA *2013 Portraying Kinship: Work by Kim Alsbrooks and Helen Mirkil, Painted Bride At Center, Philadelphia, PA *2012 Recovered Delights: The Inventive World of Found Object Sculpture, group exhibition, Snyderman- Works Gallery, Philadelphia, PA *2010 White Trash, Bambi Gallery, Philadelphia, PA *2010 About Face, with Tilo Uischer (Germany) and Elisabeth Belliveau (Canada) at Two Window Project, Berlin, Germany *2008 Kim Alsbrooks, with Patrick Farell, Third Boat Gallery, Philadelphia, PA *2005 Splendour and Elegance, Lime Blue, Charleston, SC =Fairmount Park Map = In 2014, Kim published a small artisan map of Philadelphia's Fairmount Park, reflecting her own years of exploring the park on foot and by bicycle.

She earned a B.A. degree in psychology from Wellesley College (1998) and an M.S. degree in visual studies from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2006). Infinity Burial Project According to Lee, human bodies accumulate a large amount of toxins during their lifetime. Upon death, whether the body is cremated or buried, these toxins are released back into the environment. The fungi have been chosen for their potential to utilize the nutrients in human tissue and to remediate industrial toxins in soil. Once realized, the \\"Infinity Mushroom\\" will be applied to the other components of the project. The mushrooms can be adapted to grow on the artist's own collected hair, nails and skin.

Life  Schmidt was born in Nagybecskerek, Hungary (later Yugoslavia) in 1918. Her early life was disrupted by war and the loss of her entire family. She spent years as a displaced person in Europe before arriving in Canada in 1953.Dates and details of her life are not consistent across sources. A Dictionary of Canadian Artists gives her birthplace as Yugoslavia and the date of her arrival in Canada as 1957. She graduated in Printmaking from the Vancouver School of Art in 1965. She Emigrated to Canada in the late fifties. Having trained as a hospital laboratory technician, she worked in Vancouver from 1956 until her retirement in 1983 as well as maintaining her artistic career. Once retired, she devoted herself full-time to her art-making.  Collections  Schmidt's work is held in numerous Canadian public collections including the Vancouver Art Gallery, the Burnaby Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, the Winnipeg Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of Alberta, the National Gallery of Canada, the Canada Council Art Bank, the National Gallery of Australia, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Lima, Peru, the Museum of Fine Arts, Caracas, Venezuela, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Seattle Art Museum, and the Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst in Ghent, Belgium.  Education and work  Schmidt's artistic practice included painting, drawing, printmaking, and collage as well as \\"etching, lithography, computer art, plastic sculpture, and photography.\\" At age 42, Schmidt entered the Vancouver School of Art (later Emily Carr Institute of Art & Design, and now Emily Carr University) where she studied from 1960 until 1965. Schmidt was the oldest in her class that included Ann Kipling, Richard Turner, Irene Whittome and Anna Wong. Influential instructors included Orville Fisher and Jack Shadbolt. An early history of dislocation underpins Schmidt's work. The tone of her work ranges from distraught and angst-ridden to whimsical. \\"[A]ll Schmidt's art manifests her paradoxical sense of whimsy and brutality, humour and despair, anxiety and fierce conviction.\\" She was \\"encouraged by postwar abstractionism surrealist juxtapositions and the general freeing up of aesthetic restraints.\\" In the later part of the 1960s, she focused on the expression of eccentric figuration. She moved from etching to lithography, screen printing and even a number of sculptures during the 1970s. She exhibited widely and received numerous accolades. Her printmaking was recognized internationally. In 1997 she was among 96 artists invited to participate in the 10th International Biennial Exhibition of Prints in Tokyo.

Whether depicted in prints, drawing, painting or collages, her twisted, distorted and fragmented figures are often stranded against featureless grounds, huddled in inhospitable rooms or suspended above place maps and generic landscapes. Still, humor, irony, pathos, celebration, and a keen interest in the human circus also find expression in Marianna Schmidt's art.

It was one in a series of battles initiated by the native Irish to attempt to drive the Vikings of the U√≠ √çmair from Ireland. The battle was a decisive victory for Sitric C√°ech and the U√≠ √çmair, with Niall Gl√∫ndub and five other Irish kings dying in the battle. Background The ruling Vikings of Dublin, the U√≠ √çmair, had been expelled from the city in 902 by a joint force led by M√°el Finnia mac Flannac√°n, overking of Brega and Cerball mac Muirec√°in, overking of Leinster.Downham, p. 26 However, this expulsion was temporary and Viking raids continued on Irish settlements. In 914 a large Viking fleet sailed to the previously Viking-controlled city of Waterford, and the following year more Vikings settled in Limerick, though Dublin itself remained outside U√≠ √çmair control.Downham, p. 31 In 917 two prominent members of the U√≠ √çmair, Ragnall and Sitric C√°ech, grandsons of √çmar, sailed separate fleets to Ireland, Ragnall landing at Waterford and Sitric C√°ech landing at Cenn Fuait in Leinster.Downham, pp. 31, 273-274 Several native Irish kings gathered forces to try to drive off the Vikings once more, including Niall Gl√∫ndub, over-king of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill and High King of Ireland, and Augaire mac Ailella, over-king of Leinster. The Vikings fought and won a victory against Niall Gl√∫ndub and the men of the U√≠ N√©ill at the Battle of Mag Femen in Brega, and then won another victory against Augaire mac Ailella and the men of Leinster at Cenn Fuait.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 917; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 917 Sitric led his men on a triumphant return to Dublin, re-establishing Viking rule and installing himself as king, while Ragnall returned to England. Battle In 919 a number of Irish kings banded together to try to expel the Vikings from Dublin once more. The known kings who took part in this coalition were Niall Gl√∫ndub of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill, √Åed mac Eochoc√°in of Ulster, M√°el Mithig mac Flannacain of Brega, Mael Craibe mac Duibsinig of Airg√≠alla, Conchobar mac Flainn of Mide, and Cellach mac Fogartaig of South Brega.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 919; Annals of Clonmacnoise, s.a. 919; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 919; Chronicon Scotorum, s.a. 919 The historian Clare Downham has suggested that Niall Glundub and the other kings were emboldened by the departure of Ragnall from Ireland to try again to force out the U√≠ √çmair.Downham, p. 32 The forces of Sitric and Niall met near Islandbridge in modern day County Dublin on the fourteenth of September. The Annals of the Four Masters describe Niall's words before the battle: The battle was an overwhelming victory for the Vikings; Niall and five of his ally kings died in the battle alongside many other Irish nobles.Forte, Oram and Pedersen, p. 103; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 919 The six slain kings were Niall Gl√∫ndub of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill, √Åed mac Eochoc√°in of Ulster, M√°el Mithig mac Flannacain of Brega, Mael Craibe mac Duibsinig of Airg√≠alla, Conchobar mac Flainn of Mide, and Cellach mac Fogartaig of South Brega. Other notable casualties include one of Niall Gl√∫ndub's kinsmen, a member of the ruling dynasty of the Southern U√≠ N√©ill, and Eirem√≥n mac Cenn√©tig, Chief of the Cen√©l Maine.Downham, p. 32; Chronicon Scotorum, s.a. 919 The failure of this coalition to drive out the Vikings ensured the hold of the U√≠ √çmair on Dublin remained strong. Nevertheless, war between the Vikings and the native Irish continued, and the following year there was a battle between the Vikings of Dublin and Donnchad Donn, the brother of the slain king Conchobar mac Flainn and the new High King of Ireland.

One of Burnett's longer and more complicated books for adults, it deals with themes of intermarriages between wealthy American heiresses and impoverished British nobles. Plot summary Sir Nigel Anstruthers comes to New York in search of an heiress, as he no longer has enough money to keep up his estate, Stornham Court. He marries the pretty and cosseted Rosalie Vanderpoel, the daughter of an American millionaire. But on their return to England, Nigel and his mother control and isolate Rosalie from her family. Many years later, Rosalie's now- grown up sister Bettina, who has spent a decade wondering why Rosy has lost contact with the family, arrives at Stornham Court to investigate. She discovers Rosalie and her son Ughtred, physically and emotionally fragile, living in the ruined estate. Bettina, who is both beautiful and made of considerably stronger stuff than her sister, begins to restore both Rosalie's health and spirits and the building and grounds of Stornham Court in Nigel's absence. Bettina, as an attractive heiress, attracts the attention of the local gentry and re-integrates her sister into society, while also gaining the respect of the villagers by her insistence that repairs be done by local workers. Bettina also makes the acquaintance of another impoverished English nobleman, Lord Mount Dunstan, who has considerably more pride and spirit than Sir Nigel and has no intention of marrying an American heiress to restore his estate, but who is not well-respected in the neighbourhood due to his disreputable late father and brother. Mount Dunstan regains the respect of the neighbourhood due to a chance encounter with an American typewriter salesman on holiday, G. Seldon, and because he opens his estate to workers afflicted by typhoid fever. When Sir Nigel returns home to discover Rosalie and Ughtred in improved health and spirits, the estate nearly restored, and Betty responsible for it all, he tries to conceal his ill-will but has never been particularly good at self-control. In a final confrontation, Nigel attempts to bully Bettina into leaving Rosalie at Stornham Court, this time with more of her father's money, but she hides from him and eventually returns with Mount Dunstan, who she had believed dead of typhus. Mount Dunstan whips Sir Nigel \\"like a dog,\\" and the latter eventually suffers a fit and dies, while Bettina and Mount Dunstan overcome their pride and confess their love for each other. Major Themes The title of the book refers to ships passing back and forth across the Atlantic and creating alliances between England and America like the weaving of a shuttle: \\"As Americans discovered Europe, that continent discovered America. American beauties began to appear in English drawing-rooms and Continental salons... What could be more a matter of course than that American women, being aided by adoring fathers sumptuously to ship themselves to other lands, should begin to rule these lands also?\\" Burnett made the transatlantic voyage thirty-three times, which was a lot for the era. Marriages between English aristocrats and American heiresses were common and of considerable public interest at the time. Some of the best known of these alliances was between Jennie Jerome and Lord Randolph Churchill, who were the parents of Winston Churchill, and between Consuelo Vanderbilt and the 9th Duke of Marlborough in 1895. Burnett would have read the gossip around the marriage of the Marlboroughs and other sources, such as Titled Americans: A list of American ladies who have married foreigners of rank, which included: ‚ÄòA carefully compiled List of Peers Who are Supposed to be eager to lay their coronets, and incidentally their hearts, at the feet of the all-conquering American Girl.‚Äô The building and grounds of ‚ÄòStornham Court‚Äô were modelled after Great Maytham Hall, near Rolvenden in Kent, which had a beautiful garden that Bettina starts restoring in The Shuttle and which also inspired the titular garden of The Secret Garden. Angelica Shirley Carpenter writes in In the Garden, Essays in Honor of Frances Hodgson Burnett that Burnett's depiction of Sir Nigel's abuse of Rosalie mirrors the abuse that Burnett herself suffered at the hands of her second husband Stephen: \\"All the classic signs of abuse, which were not so well-known in Frances's lifetime, are catalogued in The Shuttle. Sir Nigel isolates Rosalie from her family and friends, refusing to let her parents see her when they visit England. Stephen tried this with Frances too.\\" Publication History Burnett began writing The Shuttle in 1900, but did not finish it until several years later. In the meantime, she wrote several other books, including The Making of a Marchioness and its sequel The Methods of Lady Walderhurst. Both The Shuttle and The Making of a Marchioness were republished in 2007 by Persephone Books. The Shuttle is on the Publishers Weekly list of bestselling novels in the United States for 1907 and 1908. The Shuttle was made into a silent film of the same title in 1918 by Margaret Turnbull and Harvey Thew, and featured Constance Talmadge as Bettina Vanderpoel, Edith Johnson as Rosalie Vanderpoel, E. B. Tilton as Reuben Vanderpoel, Helen Dunbar as Mrs. Vanderpoel, George McDaniel as Sir Nigel Anstruthers, Albert Roscoe as Lord Mount Dunstan, Thomas Persse as Penzance, Edward Peil as Ughtred Anstruthers, and Casson Ferguson as G.

Buck needs cash and tells Hopalong to bring some cattle to Fort Hastings. They must arrive there in 10 days to fulfill contract terms. In order to get them there on time, the cattle have to be driven through the Black Butte area where the previous year rustlers stampeded the Bar 20 cattle leading to the loss of many cattle and the death of several of Hopalong's men. Nora Blake lives in the Black Butte area and Hopalong is smitten by her. It turns out that Nora's brother, Professor Hepburne, is the ruthless leader of the rustlers. Before the cattle drive Hopalong meets the Professor when he stops by the Bar 20 to get his horse reshod. Windy notices that the Professor is carrying a load of dynamite. The cattle drive begins. Buck's nephew pleads with his uncle to go on the drive. Buck relents and Artie rides after the cattle drive. Hopalong assigns him to the chuck wagon with Windy. As the drive is going through the Black Butte area, Hepburne sets off the dynamite. The cattle stampede. 200 are picked off by the rustlers. Windy and Artie are right under the area that was dynamited and save themselves by getting under the chuck wagon. But Artie is hurt. In the explosion a piece of the dynamite case lands near Windy. Hopalong then knows that Hepburne is the rustler chief. He lays a trap. He puts Lucky in charge of the drive. He is to take the cattle to Fort Hasting and come back to the Butte with the cash. Meanwhile, Hopalong goes to visit Nora. He lets Hepburne overhear that Lucky will be coming through the Butte with the cash. Windy who is taking care of Artie goes to get water and discovers the rustlers and the cattle. When he comes back to Artie, Artie has tried to get up and hurt himself again. So Windy can't go as Hopalong wished to get Buck to bring the ranch people back to fight the rustlers. But when Windy is not looking, Artie gets on his horse and goes back to the ranch to bring the reinforcements. Between Hopalong, Lucky, Windy and the ranch hands the rustlers are defeated. Hepburne was angered when one of his men talked back. Hepburne shoots the talker back. Hepburne carries a box of dynamite up one of the hills but the fellow he shot shoots Hepburne. The shot sets off the dynamite. So that is the end of Hepburne. Hopalong believes Nora will never know her brother was a villain. Good triumphs over evil.
