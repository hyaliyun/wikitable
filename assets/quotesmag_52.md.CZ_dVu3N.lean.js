The park was formerly the site of an artist colony and is notable for its collection of relics saved from the demolition of buildings primarily in downtown Toronto arranged akin to ancient ruins. Located on the Scarborough Bluffs, Guild Park and Gardens has an outdoor Greek stage and a 19th-century log cabin among the oldest in Toronto. The principal building in the park is the Guild Inn, a former inn and estate mansion. The park is located on Guildwood Parkway, east of Eglinton Avenue East and Kingston Road. Its is accessed from the Guild Inn's own parking lots and from a parking lot for the Lake Ontario access trail, just to the east. The park is mostly forested. South of the Inn is a large area of grassy, open space. To the east, a ravine leads down from Guildwood Parkway to Lake Ontario. Along the bluffs, an east–west trail connects to Livingston Road to the west, with several points for viewing the lake. The edges of the bluffs are roped off for safety, as the bluffs are tall and composed of soft, sandy, unstable material. History The park is managed by Toronto Parks, on land that is the property of the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority. It was formerly known as Guildwood Park. It became a park after the Guild Inn and its property was bought by Metropolitan Toronto and the Government of Ontario in 1978 from Rosa Hewetson Clark and Spencer Clark. The Inn continued to operate until it closed in 2001. It was managed by various hotel management companies, including Delta Hotels, Canadian National Railway and others. It was first the \\"Ranelagh Park\\" estate of Col. Harold Bickford, then it became the China Mission Seminary, and the \\"Cliff Acres\\" estate of Richard Look, before it was bought in 1932 by Rosa Hewetson, who, along with her husband Spencer Clark converted it to \\"The Guild of all Arts\\" artists' colony and inn. During World War II and for a period afterward, it was used by the Government of Canada. From the 1990s onwards, the property was the subject of several redevelopment proposals, which failed or were rejected. The City of Toronto government developed a management plan in 2014 for the park and gardens. The plan intends to preserve the park, protect the forest, bluffs and lakeshore, and maintain the heritage buildings (inn and cabin). The inn was restored, part of a new facility for weddings, meetings and gatherings. One new wing is a banquet hall. Another new wing includes meeting rooms. Relics In the late 1950s and later, older buildings in downtown Toronto were being torn down and replaced. Many of these had been standing for many decades and had been well-constructed, with stonework of a high quality and were considered historic to many. A movement to support the preservation of older buildings began in response to the amount of demolition, but it would not be until the 1970s that governments would pass laws that protected buildings considered to have 'heritage' status. Rosa and Spencer Clark responded to this wholesale demolition by taking away remnants of the buildings from the demolition sites. They enlisted engineers, architects and hired stonemason Arthur Hibberd, and erected the remnants in the Guild gardens. Remnants of over 60 buildings from Toronto and elsewhere in Ontario exist in the Guild gardens, the front gate of the Guild Inn, and the front gate of the Guildwood Village neighbourhood. =The \\"Greek\\" Theatre= The Greek Theatre is an open-air theatre, built from the remnants of a Bank of Toronto. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Guild Inn, the Clarks built an open-air theatre from remnants of the Bank of Toronto building, at a cost of to Spencer Clark. The Bank of Toronto building had stood at Bay and King Streets in downtown Toronto since 1912, until 1966, when the Toronto- Dominion Centre was built. Eight marble columns, plus Corinthian capitals and arches were repurposed along with a concrete stage and steps to form an open- air theatre under the supervision of Hibberd. There were also plans to build an amphitheatre in front of the stage, but it has not been built. Seating is either on the grass or using chairs. The theatre hosted its first performance in 1984 of folk music by the Good Time Rolling Folk Music Medicine Show. From 1998 to 2003, The Gardens and Greek Theatre at The Guild Inn was home to Cliffhanger Productions theatre company, which specialized in adaptations of world mythology for family audiences. The Greek Stage at Guild Park hosts Guild Festival Theatre's annual productions of classic stage plays. =List of relics= Stonework from the William H.

To the west of the Guild Inn property exists an 1800s-era log cabin, known as the Osterhout Log Cabin. The actual date of its construction is unknown. In 1795, surveyor Augustus Jones and his surveying team camped in the area and could have built a log cabin on the property while he surveyed Scarborough. However, Jones' accounts stated that they stayed in tents. In 1805, the property was granted to William Osterhout, but there is no record of a log cabin during the time Osterhout lived on the property. The property was later owned by Alexander McDonnell, Duncan Cameron, and John Ewart. James Humphreys bought the property in 1845, and his son and family are the first recorded residents in the cabin, in 1861. The property was bought by the Clarks in 1934. As part of the 1978 sale of the Guild property, the land around the cabin came under the administration of the Conservation Authority. In 1980, Scarborough designated the cabin as the Osterhout Cabin, and granted it protected heritage status. Some test pits were dug around the cabin in 1994 to determine its age. Artist Elizabeth Fraser Williamson used the cabin as a studio from 1970 to 1995. =Other structures= The following structures are also situated at Guild Park and Gardens: * Guild Office Building * Pottery Kiln * Sculpture Studio * Wishing Well * Smokehouse * Stone Cutting Machine (donated by Arthur Hibberd) Source: Lidgold In addition, the park previously held three cottages, as well as two other buildings, Corycliff, and The Studio. In popular culture The park has been used in recent pop culture pieces. Martha and the Muffins filmed the video for \\"Danseparc\\" here. The Guild Inn and surrounding area were used in the filming of The Skulls, the Warehouse 13 pilot and \\"Endless Terror\\" episodes. It was also one of the main back settings for Canadian rapper Drake's music video for. \\"Headlines\\"in 2011. The 1972 television series The Whiteoaks of Jalna was filmed at the cabin, and appeared in the 1975 film It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time. It has also been used for other television projects.

John MacCormac was also the founder of the first Free Will Baptist church in Sierra Leone and served as a member of His Majesty's Colonial Council and was styled with the title of 'Honorable'. MacCormac was the grandfather and namesake of Dr John Farrell Easmon, the Chief Medical Officer of the Gold Coast Colony who coined the term 'Blackwater Fever' and wrote the first English-based clinical diagnosis of Blackwater fever. Background John MacCormac was born on 24 March 1791 in Lurgan, County Armagh in Northern Ireland to John MacCormac, a wealthy linen merchant and Ann MacCormac, née Hall, a daughter of Colonel or General Joseph Hall Jr., a wealthy distiller and proprietor of Hall Place, in Lurgan, Northern Ireland. MacCormac was the paternal grandson of Cornelius MacCormac, a high-ranking British naval officer who died in England during the process of trying to recover his gold-laced hat. John MacCormac was born to the MacCormac family of County, Armagh and was the elder brother of Henry MacCormac, a lecturer at Queen's University, Belfast. MacCormac was the paternal uncle of Sir William MacCormac, a lecturer at St Thomas Hospital and a senior physician to King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. Business MacCormac first arrived in West Africa by the age of eighteen and originally settled in the Gold Coast. MacCormac settled permanently in Sierra Leone in 1814 and by 1816 he introduced the timber trade to Sierra Leone by shipping a type of timber called African Teak, which was really African Oak, from the estuary of the Rokel River to England. He built himself a home and a timber yard on Timbo Island. He contracted a workforce of Temne labourers as well as Black colonists from the Sierra Leone some of whom also acted as overseers of the timber production process. He also built a large stone house in the Sierra Leone hinterland and a spacious mansion worth £10,000 on the corner of Rawdon and Oxford Streets. MacCormac was financially ruined by the late 1830s and he retired to Liverpool, England alongside his brother and business partner, Hamilton Edmund MacCormac. MacCormac returned to Sierra Leone after declaring bankruptcy but was allowed to keep his commodious mansion by his creditors. He subsequently undertook a number of government appointments. Political career and colonial appointments MacCormac was one of the wealthiest merchants in Sierra Leone and he was appointed by His Majesty's Colonial Council of Sierra Leone in the 1820s. MacCormac was a contemporary of Honorable Kenneth Macaulay, a Scottish merchant and colonial official in Sierra Leone, who served on the Colonial Council of Sierra Leone. MacCormac also served on the Colonial Council alongside Benjamin Campbell, a British merchant of Scottish descent who served as the first Consul-General to the Lagos Colony. MacCormac and Campbell entered into a treaty with the Koya Temne on behalf of Governor Alexander Findlay the representative of the Crown colonial government. MacCormac served in various positions of responsibility within the colonial government and civil service.Sibthorpe, Aaron Belisarius Cosimo, The History of Sierra Leone, (1868. 1906. Reprint: United Kingdom: Taylor & Francis, 1970) MacCormac served as a Justice of Peace and was subsequently appointed as an Assistant Police Magistrate for the Colony of Sierra Leone. MacCormac was eventually appointed as the Police Magistrate of the Colony of Sierra Leone in the mid-nineteenth century. MacCormac's former extensive business interests with the Koya Temne allowed the colonial council to appoint MacCormac as an unofficial envoy or ambassador for the Colony of Sierra Leone and the neighbouring indigenous ethnic groups. MacCormac undertook trade missions and engaged treaties on behalf of the colonial government of Sierra Leone. MacCormac was eager for the Temne to reject Islam and accept Christianity and some historians have stated that this bias is reflected in MacCormac's decisions as a representative of the Crown Colonial Government of Sierra Leone. Ministry After suffering financial ruin, MacCormac became a pious convert to Christianity and became a Free Will Baptist. MacCormac was the founder and first pastor of Church of God, Regent Road, which was initially located at MacCormac's mansion at the corner of Rawdon and Oxford Streets. MacCormac left an endowment for the church in his will and the church was subsequently established at Regent Road, Freetown and has an active congregation in Freetown, Sierra Leone.http://www.regentroadbaptistchurch.org/history.htm MacCormac was succeeded as the first pastor of the Church of God by his adopted son or ward, Thomas George Lawson, a Popo prince who served in the senior civil service of Sierra Leone. Parliamentary testimony John MacCormac was one of several European residents called to testify before the British Parliament in 1830 regarding the governance of Sierra Leone and the effectiveness of maintaining the Colony. MacCormac attributed his longevity to eating the local diet of rice, fish, and other African-based foods. Death After suffering from a bout of illness, John MacCormac left Sierra Leone permanently on 21 June 1864 and settled in Barnsbury in Islington, London. He died in Barsnbury on 20 March 1865 and his obituary was recorded in the Law Magazine and Law Review and the Solicitors' Journal & Reporter. MacCormac was one of the oldest and longest European residents of Sierra Leone and he lived in West Africa for over fifty years. He left a fortune of £4,000 to his grandchildren and other benefactors. MacCormac's grandson and namesake, John Farrell Easmon, received a £400 inheritance at the age of eighteen or nineteen years old and used the inheritance from his grandfather's estate to fund his medical studies. Descendants John MacCormac possibly had a relationship with Hannah Cuthbert, a daughter of African American immigrants from Savannah, Georgia to Freetown and had at least one daughter, Catherine MacCormac, who regularly visited her uncle, Dr Henry MacCormac in Belfast, Northern Ireland. John MacCormac was the maternal grandfather of Dr John Farrell Easmon and the paternal great grandfather of Dr McCormack Easmon. Charles Odamtten Easmon, a Ghanaian surgical consultant, was a great-great grandson of John MacCormac.

It depicts an inside view of an open attic window as the wind blows the thin and tattered curtains into the room. The painting is housed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. but is not on view. Creation The house belonged to Wyeth's friends Christina and Alvaro Olson who lived on the coast of Maine. The window was located in an abandoned room on the third floor. Christina Olson was a frequent model for Wyeth, and would famously appear in the painting Christina's World about a year later. After opening a dormer window to cool down the attic he was working in, Wyeth was inspired by the way the incoming breeze brought life to the tattered curtains. In an attempt to capture the moment, he made a sketch on the same sheet of paper he had been using to draw Olson. Following the initial sketch, Wyeth spent months making studies of the window in various materials. Images of the sketch overlapping Olson and other studies in various materials are present in Anderson and Brock's Andrew Wyeth: looking out, looking in that show Wyeth's exploration of the drapery and composition.  Symbolism  Wyeth believed in the ability of ordinary things to carry symbolism, \\"profound meaning,\\" and rich emotion. The same is true for Wind from the Sea. Comparing the rigid window frame to Christina's resiliency, the decaying curtains to her disability, and the crocheted birds to her delicate and surviving femininity, Wyeth considered the painting to be a symbolic portrait of her. The decaying interior, muted colors, and view of the cemetery that Christina, Alvaro Olson, and Wyeth himself would be buried in is typical of the somber style Wyeth adopted following his father's death. Provenance Clay Bartlett in Manchester, Vermont bought the painting from the artist in January 1947. It was sold to Charles Hill Morgan in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1952. In accordance with Morgan's will, it was on loan to the Mead Art Museum of Amherst College for 25 years following his death in 1984, after which it was donated it to the National Gallery of Art in 2009.

The characters of the plot are: *Augustus, 1670-1733, (king of Poland as Augustus II the Strong, Elector of Saxony as Friedrich Augustus I, Grand Duke of Lithuania as Augustas II), who is desperate for a way to finance his spending, and has hopes on the wonders of alchemy. *Johann Friedrich Böttger, 1682-1719, the teenage alchemist who gets imprisoned and forced, given the materials required, to come up with a reliable way to produce gold and who tries hard but ends up changing direction toward the search to find a commercially viable formula for porcelain, which in this period was more valuable than gold.

The first match took place on 17 June, 1954; and the second on 17 September, 1954. The first fight went the distance with Marciano winning on points through a unanimous decision. In the second bout Marciano knocked out Charles in the eighth round. Marciano was 30 years old at the time of the first Marciano–Charles fight and Charles 33. Marciano–Charles I =Rounds 1–4= The first four rounds of the first Marciano–Charles bout revealed Charles's superior technical expertise. Marciano was outfought and outmaneuvered in these early rounds. Charles threw body shots at Marciano with great success; he also opened a two inch long and one inch deep cut over Marciano's left eye. Marciano's cut man Freddie Brown, who later worked for Roberto Durán, would comment that he could not remember treating a cut worse than this one. =Rounds 5–9= In the fifth round, Charles surprisingly became defensive and stopped dictating the pace of the fight. In the early rounds, Charles had thrown body punches at Marciano with great success; by the fifth round Charles was no longer throwing these punches. Without making any effort to protect his eye, Marciano carried the fight to Charles, went on the offensive, found his rhythm, and seized the initiative in the fight. By the end of round 9, Marciano's face was a crimson mask, and yet he had managed to land so many punches on Charles that he was ahead in the scoring. =Rounds 10–15= By the 10th round, Marciano was clearly ahead and yet he kept fighting as if the decision was in doubt, and kept trying for a knockout. Charles managed to stay on his feet while withstanding Marciano's punches, but his face gradually started changing for the worse. His right eye closed, his lower lip was split and swollen, and a blood clot appeared on his left jaw. At the end Marciano won the fight with a unanimous decision. Ruby Goldstein, who refereed this fight, commented: Marciano–Charles II The second Marciano–Charles bout proved to be surprisingly dramatic with both the fighters exerting dominance in different stages of the fight. Charles had put on weight for this fight, and his strategy seemed to be to go for a swift knockout. =Early rounds= Charles won the first round by landing some clean punches on Marciano's jaw. In the second round, Marciano hit Charles with a body blow, and then knocked Charles down on the canvas. Marciano now went for the kill, but Charles proved too slippery and survived the round. The fight then became an offensive–defensive affair with Marciano constantly on the attack and Charles content to do defensive boxing while throwing only occasional punches. The fight became dull and insipid with about the only excitement coming from Marciano's usage of roughhouse tactics like throwing low blows and hitting after the bell. The fouls did not affect the judges who had Marciano well ahead after the fifth round. =A twist in the tale= Something strange happened in the sixth round because of which Ezzard Charles almost won the fight. As Charles and Marciano emerged from a clinch towards the end of the round, Marciano was seen sporting a deep wound on his left nostril. It was unclear how Marciano got hurt with some claiming it was due to Charles's punches, and Marciano laying the blame on Charles's elbow. Marciano now started bleeding profusely from the wound; he would later observe: \\"I knew something was wrong because the blood was running like from a faucet. \\"Meanwhile, Charles's corner was feeling triumphant after the sixth round; Charles was advised by them to keep throwing punches at Marciano's nose. =Seventh round= In the seventh round, Marciano went out with a makeshift patch over his nose; the device was quickly knocked off by Charles's punches as Charles went after Marciano's nose. Remarkably enough, Marciano won the seventh round by landing more blows than Charles who was left staggered at the end of the round. Even so it was Marciano who was in danger because of the nose wound which continued to gush blood. The word was out that the fight would only be allowed to continue for one or two more rounds. =Eighth round= In the interval before the eighth round, Marciano's corner advised him to go after Charles's body. Instead, he decided to ignore the advice and went after his opponent's head. As Marciano later explained: With 24 seconds left for the end of the eighth round, Ezzard Charles was knocked out by Marciano. It was later suggested that the extra weight Charles had put on for this fight resulted in him providing a slower target for Marciano. Aftermath Many critics regard the first Marciano–Charles fight to be among the greatest heavyweight boxing bouts. The second Marciano–Charles fight is considered by some critics to be among Marciano's finest performances in his boxing career with a few claiming it was his best fight.

It consisted of a series of incidents along the then-disputed border; including the Eritrean–Ethiopian War of 1998–2000 and the subsequent Second Afar insurgency. The border conflict was a continuation of the Eritrean–Ethiopian War of 1998–2000. It included multiple clashes with numerous casualties, including the Battle of Tsorona in 2016. Ethiopia stated in 2018 that it would cede Badme to Eritrea. This led to the Eritrea–Ethiopia summit on 9July 2018, where an agreement was signed which demarcated the border and agreed a resumption of diplomatic relations. Background =Colonisation and border conflict= In March 1870, an Italian shipping company become a claimant to the territory at the northern end of Assab Bay, a deserted but spacious bay about half-way between Annesley Bay to the north and Obock to the south. The area —which had long been dominated by the Ottoman Empire and Egypt was not settled by the Italians until 1880. In 1884, the Hewett Treaty was signed between the British Empire and Ethiopia, reigned by Emperor Yohannes IV (r. 1871–1889). The British Empire promised the highlands of modern Eritrea—and free access to the Massawan coast to Ethiopia in exchange for its help evacuating garrisons from the Sudan, in the then-ongoing Mahdist War. In 1889, the disorder that followed the death of Yohannes IV, Italian General Oreste Baratieri occupied the highlands along the Eritrean coast and Italy proclaimed the establishment of a new colony of \\"Eritrea\\", (from the Latin name for the Red Sea), with its capital at Asmara in substitution foe Massawa. On 2May 1889, the peace and friendship Treaty of Wuchale was signed between Italy and Ethiopia, under which Italian Eritrea was officially recognised by Ethiopia as part of Italy. However, Article 17 of the treaty was disputed as the Italian version stated that Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs through Italian authorities, in effect making Ethiopia an Italian protectorate, while the Amharic version gave Ethiopia considerable autonomy, with the option of communicating with third powers through the Italians. This resulted in the First Italo-Ethiopian War, which the Ethiopians won, resulting in the Treaty of Addis Ababa in October 1896. Italy paid reparations of ten million Italian lira. Unusually, the Italians retained most, if not all, of the territories beyond the Mareb-Belessa and May/Muni rivers that they had taken; Emperor Menelik II () gave away part of Tigray which had been treated as Ethiopian since time immemorial. On 2August 1928, Ethiopia and Italy signed a new friendship treaty. =Ethiopia under Italian rule= Abyssinian soldiers in 1936 during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. On 22November 1934, Italy claimed that three senior Ethiopian military-political commanders with a force of 1,000 Ethiopian militia arrived near Walwal and formally requested the garrison stationed there, comprising about 60 Somali soldiers, known as dubats, to withdraw. The Somali NCO leading the garrison refused and alerted Captain Cimmaruta, commander of the garrison of Uarder, away, what had happened. Italian artillery in Tembien, Ethiopia (1936). Between 5 and 7December 1934, for reasons which have never been clearly determined, a skirmish broke out between the garrison and the Ethiopian militia. According to the Italians, the Ethiopians attacked the Somalis with rifle and machine- gun fire. According to the Ethiopians, the Italians attacked them, supported by two tanks and three aircraft. According to historian Anthony Mockler 107 Ethiopians were killed. By 3October 1935, the Italian Army led by General Emilio De Bono launched an invasion of Ethiopia, without a declaration of war. This was the start of a new war called the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. In May 1936, the Italian Army occupied the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. The occupied country was annexed into the Italian East African colony together with the other Italian east African colonies. On 10June 1940, Italy declared war on Britain and France; in March 1941 Britain began a campaign to capture the Italian-held territory in the region. By November, the British had occupied the whole Italian East African colony. However thousands of Italian soldiers began conducting a guerrilla war within their former colony which lasted until October 1943. After the end of WWII, Ethiopia regained her independence, and Eritrea was placed under Britain military administration. Prelude =Eritrea as part of Ethiopia= The situation during the Ethiopian Civil War. After the war there was a debate as to what would happen to Eritrea. After the Italian communists' victory in the 1946 Italian general election they supported returning Eritrea to Italy under a trusteeship or as a colony. The Soviet Union similarly wished to make it their trustee; and tried to achieve this by diplomatic means, but they failed. Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I () also claimed Eritrea. In 1952 the United Nations decided that Eritrea would become part of the Ethiopian Empire. Eritrea became a special autonomous region within a federated Eithiopia. In 1958, a group of Eritreans founded the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF). The organisation mainly consisted of Eritrean students, professionals and intellectuals. It engaged in clandestine political activities intended to cultivate resistance to the centralising policies of the imperial Ethiopian state. During the following decade the Emperor decided to dissolve the federation between Ethiopia and Eritrea, annexing the special region and bringing it under direct rule. This resulted in an almost thirty-year long armed struggle known as the Eritrean War of Independence. The ELF engaged in armed conflict against the Ethiopian Government from 1September 1961. In 1970 a group called the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) broke off from the ELF. They were fierce rivals and in February 1972, the First Eritrean Civil War broke out between them. Their rivalry paused in 1974, and calls for the conflict to stop were finally heeded. These calls for peace came from local villagers at a time when the independence movement was close to victory over Ethiopia. On 12September 1974, a successful coup d'état was carried out against the Emperor led by Lieutenant General Aman Andom. The (junta) government was led by members of the pro- Soviet Ethiopian military, which established an almost seven-year long (reign). military junta. The ELF-EPLF's peace lasted only six years; in February 1980 the EPLF declared war on the ELF, after which the ELF and the Soviet Union started secret negotiations. The Second Eritrean Civil War lasted until 1981, and the EPLF emerged victorious, with help from the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The ELF was driven out of Eritrea into Sudan. On 27May 1991 the new Ethiopian Transitional Government was formed after the fall of the pro-Soviet government. The Ethiopian Transitional Government promised to hold a referendum, within two years in the region. The referendum was held between 23–25April 1993 with 99.81% voting in favour of independence. On 4May 1993 the official independence of Eritrea was established. However, the border between Ethiopia and newly independent Eritrea was not clearly defined. After border skirmishes in late 1997, the two countries attempted to negotiate their boundary. In October 1997, Ethiopia presented the Eritrean Government a map showing Eritrean-claimed areas as part of Ethiopia. History =War era= On 8May 1998, border clashes erupted between Ethiopia and Eritrea, killing several Eritrean officials near the then-disputed town of Badme. A large Eritrean mechanised force entered the town, and a firefight broke out between the Eritrean soldiers and the Tigrayan militia and security police they encountered. On 13May, Eritrean radio described the incidents as a \\"total war\\" policy from Ethiopia, and claimed that the Ethiopian Army was mobilising for a full assault against Eritrea. The organisation Claims Commission found that this was in essence an affirmation of the existence of a state of war between belligerents, not a declaration of war, and that Ethiopia also notified the United Nations Security Council, as required under Article 51 of the UN Charter. On 1March 1999 Ethiopia declares victory over Eritea by recapturing the Badme region on the Eritea side it denies its defeat. By the time Ethiopian forces had broken through Eritrea's fortified front and was deep into Eritrean territory, Eritrea accepted the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) peace plan on 27February 1999. The \\"proximity talks\\" broke down in early May 2000 \\"with Ethiopia accusing Eritrea of imposing unacceptable conditions\\". On12 May the Ethiopians launched an offensive that broke through the Eritrean lines between Shambuko and Mendefera, crossed the Mareb River, and cut the road between Barentu and Mendefera, the main supply line for Eritrean troops on the western front of the fighting. Ethiopia declared the war was over at 25May 2000. At the end of May 2000, Ethiopia occupied about a quarter of Eritrea's territory. =Post- war era= Conflict on the border United Nations soldiers, part of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, monitoring Eritrea–Ethiopia boundary (2005). After a cease-fire was established on 18June 2000, both parties agreed to have a demilitarised zone called the Temporary Security Zone (TSZ). It was patrolled by the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) an organisation for the border stabilisation and the prevention of future conflicts between the countries. On 31July 2000, the UNMEE was officially launched and started patrolling the border. On 12December 2000, a peace agreement was signed in Algiers. In August 2002 Eritrea released all the Ethiopian POWs. In September 2007, Kjell Bondevik, a United Nations' official, warned that the border conflict could cause a new war. On 16January 2008, the Eritrean Government give up all of its claims in Ethiopia. In February, the UNMEE commenced pulling its peacekeepers out of Eritrea due to Eritrean Government restrictions on its fuel supplies. On 30July 2008, the Security Council held a vote which ended the UN mission the next day. In June 2009 a rebel group called Democratic Movement for the Liberation of the Eritrean Kunama (DMLEK) joined the fight against the Eritrean Government with the pro- Ethiopian Red Sea Afar Democratic Organisation (RSADO). On 23April 2010, RSADO and the Eritrean National Salvation Front (ENSF) attacked an Eritrean Army's base, they also took it over for 3 hours until 6 a.m. They killed At least 11 Eriteans soldiers and wounded more than 20 others. The conflict deepened in March 2012, when Ethiopia launched an offensive into Eritrean-held territory. Three Eritrean military camps were attacked, and a number of people were killed or captured. Several weeks prior to the offensive, Ethiopia blamed Eritrea for supporting the Ethiopian rebels who had staged the Afar region tourist attack in northern Eithiopia, in which five Western tourists were killed. On 7September 2013, two Ethiopian-supported Eritrean rebel groups RSADO and the Saho People's Democratic Movement (SPDM) agreed to fight together against the Eritrean Government. In December 2013 the Ethiopian Army, crossed the border to attack some rebel camps in Eritrea. In June 2016, Eritrea claimed that 200 Ethiopian soldiers were killed and 300 wounded in a battle at Tsorona. On 22June 2016 Eritrea warned the UN Human Rights Council that a new war between Ethiopia and the country can restart as Ethiopia was planning for a new attack. On 2April 2018 former Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned due to the unrest and a new Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, was appointed. On 5June 2018 Ahmed announced that Ethiopia relinquished its claims on the disputed areas and that the conflict with Eritrea was at an end. He arrived on 8July 2018 in Asmara, Eritrea. Where his counterpart, President Isaias Afwerki, greeted him at Asmara International Airport. The next day both leaders signed a five-point Joint Declaration of Peace and Friendship, which declared that \\"the state of war between Ethiopia and Eritrea has come to an end; a new era of peace and friendship has been opened\\" and ceded Badme to Eritrea. Proxy conflict Since the cease- fire was established both countries claimed to backing each other's rebels. In 2006 the Ethiopian Government deployed its forces in its neighbour country Somalia, backing the government by fighting against the Islamists. The Ethiopian and Somali governments, accuses Eritrea for backing the Islamists in the region, in reaction of the Somali Government it started backing the Eritrean rebels. In April 2007 Ethiopia accuses also Eritrea for supporting the rebel groups like the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) and the Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front (ARDUF). In April 2011 Ethiopia openly declared its support for Eritrean rebel groups. According to the Global Security in 2014 the rebel group Tigray People’s Democratic Movement ([TPDM] which is active in the Tigray Region) was the most important rebel group in Eritrea fighting against the Ethiopian Government, Eritrea also financed and train the group. In January 2015, the pro-Eritrean rebel groups, the Ginbot 7 and the Ethiopian People's Patriotic Front (EPPF) merged to fight against the Ethiopian Government, and called itself the Arbegnoch – Ginbot 7 for Unity and Democracy Movement (AGUDM). On 25July 2015, Ginbot 7 decided to go in an armed resistance and goes into exile in Eritea. On 10October 2016, the Ethiopian Government claimed that Eritrea (was also helping Oromo Liberation Front [OLF]) and Egypt were behind the Oromo protests in Ethiopia. =Aftermath= After the Eritrea–Ethiopia peace summit, Ethiopian Prime Minister Ahmed requested that United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres lift the United Nations' sanctions on Eritrea, imposed largely due to the efforts of Ethiopian diplomacy. Ethiopian Airlines announced that it would resume flights to Asmara on 16July. Between 14–16July President Isaias visited Ethiopia and its president, Mulatu Teshome. Isaias affirmed the unity of Eritrea and Ethiopia, saying \\"henceforth, anyone who says Eritreans and Ethiopians are two different peoples is one that doesn't know the truth\\". He visited an industrial park in Awasa and presided over the reopening of the Eritrean Embassy. On 6September, the Ethiopian Embassy was reopened in the Eritrean capital Asmara. On 11September, for the first time in twenty years, an Eritrea–Ethiopia border crossing was reopened. Five days later, both leaders signed a new peace agreement in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Soon after the peace summit many Ethiopian rebels returned to Ethiopia including TPDM, OLF and Ginbot 7 all those groups were demobilised and unbanded as terrorists. On 10 October, the last 2,000 of TPDM members returned to Ethiopia. The UN lifted its sanctions on14 November 2018 after nine years against Eritrea. Eritrea made also a joint agreement with Somalia and Ethiopia to co-operate with each other. Later on 13 December 2018 President Afwerki went to Somalia for the first time in two decades. During only the war, between 70,000 and 98,217 people were killed and 650,000 displaced, of whom 19,000–67,000 were Eritrean soldiers and between 34,000–60,000 were Ethiopian soldiers. The casualties after the war there were between 523–530 dead in the Second Afar insurgency alone. On the Eritrean side the casualties of the conflict were between 427–434 Eritreans killed, 30 pro-Eritrean rebels killed, 88 Eritrean soldiers wounded and 2 Eritreans captured. The Ethiopian side were 49 Ethiopian soldiers (claimed by rebels), and five civilians were killed, also, 23 civilians were kidnapped and three others were wounded. On the both countries border, the casualties of both countries were according to Eritrea at least 18 Eritreans and over 200 Ethiopians.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history The Ira Hill House stands in the village center of Isle La Motte, on the west side of Main Street north of its junction with School Street, and just south of the town hall. It consists of a stone main block, 2-1/2 stories in height with a gabled roof, and a long wood- frame and stone ell extending southward from its left. The main block is fashioned out of quarry-cut limestone, some of it exhibiting fossils found in the island community's limestone outcrops. It is fronted by a two-story shed- roof porch, a late 20th-century recreation of an earlier Victorian porch with turned posts and scrolled brackets. The ell has two parts: the outer end is a stone barn whose first floor was built contemporaneously to the house, and whose second floor was added about 1840. The joining section consists of a rear stone wall and a front wood frame wall. with The house was built in 1822 by James Ritchie, a regionally prominent Scottish immigrant stonemason who is credited with building nine buildings in Isle La Motte, including the Methodist Church which stands a short way to the east. Ritchie built the house for Ira Hill, a prominent local businessman and son of one of the island's major landowners.

Toolkit genes are central to the synthesis of molecular genetics, palaeontology, evolution and developmental biology in the science of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). Toolkit Toolkit genes are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient, dating back to the last common ancestor of bilaterian animals. For example, that ancestor had at least 7 Pax genes for transcription factors. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. The majority of toolkit genes are components of signaling pathways, and encode for the production of transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins (and signalling ligands that bind to them), and secreted morphogens, all of these participate in defining the fate of undifferentiated cells, generating spatial and temporal patterns, which in turn form the body plan of the organism. Among the most important of the toolkit genes are those of the Hox gene cluster, or complex. Hox genes, transcription factors containing the more broadly distributed homeobox protein-binding DNA motif, function in patterning the body axis. Thus, by combinatorially specifying the identity of particular body regions, Hox genes determine where limbs and other body segments will grow in a developing embryo or larva. A paradigmatic toolkit gene is Pax6/eyeless, which controls eye formation in all animals. It has been found to produce eyes in mice and Drosophila, even if mouse Pax6/eyeless was expressed in Drosophila. This means that a big part of the morphological evolution undergone by organisms is a product of variation in the genetic toolkit, either by the genes changing their expression pattern or acquiring new functions. A good example of the first is the enlargement of the beak in Darwin's large ground-finch (Geospiza magnirostris), in which the gene BMP is responsible for the larger beak of this bird, relative to the other finches. The loss of legs in snakes and other squamates is another good example of genes changing their expression pattern. In this case the gene Distal-less is very under-expressed, or not expressed at all, in the regions where limbs would form in other tetrapods. In 1994, Sean B. Carroll's team made the \\"groundbreaking\\" discovery that this same gene determines the eyespot pattern in butterfly wings, showing that toolbox genes can change their function. Toolkit genes, as well as being highly conserved, also tend to evolve the same function convergently or in parallel. Classic examples of this are the already mentioned Distal-less gene, which is responsible for appendage formation in both tetrapods and insects, or, at a finer scale, the generation of wing patterns in the butterflies Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics whose coloration pattern arose in different evolutionary events, but is controlled by the same genes. This supports Marc Kirschner and John C. Gerhart's theory of Facilitated Variation, which states that morphological evolutionary novelty is generated by regulatory changes in various members of a large set of conserved mechanisms of development and physiology.

Christian Combaz is a French writer and columnist who was born on September 21, 1954 into a middle-class family in Algiers (his father worked for a French petroleum company). Biography Christian Combaz spent his early years in Bordeaux. His family moved to Paris in 1968 where he attended college at the fashionable lycée Saint-Louis-de- Gonzague, a Jesuit-run school in the Trocadero district. He graduated at the Sainte-Croix de Neuilly college among the French aristocracy. Some of his early works have been influenced by this education among the privileged. His novels show a typical French narrative touch that the critics called \\"balzacian\\", referring to his obsession with social recognition. His first novel, Messieurs, published in 1979 (and 30 years later Votre serviteur in 2015) included a vivid description of the French high-society . While attending the Sciences-Po in Paris in 1977, he registered a few blocks away at the Beaux-Arts school in sculpture and in the studio run by . Though socially involved in Paris, Rome and Venice (Montefalco, 1980), he still managed to write a daily column in Le Figaro and published a novel every year, often depicting father/son ambiguous relationships with older churchmen, writers, veterans, war pilots, later portrayed in his autobiographical novel Votre Serviteur. His literary works in this period included a road-book about Florida, Lettres de Floride. A licensed pilot, he was consider making this his career. He pretended to start a career as a reporter/explorer but soon went back to literature and, this time, got instant recognition. \\"This is real art!\\", wrote the very influential Angelo Rinaldi in L'Express. Though often nominated for the annual literary French awards, he kept living in a secluded village and showed no further interest in Parisian circles . Later he referred to these 10 years of exile in his book Gens de Campagnol. Invited to speak in the praised radio show of Alain Finkielkraut, he said that he preferred to devote his art to \\"those we may call simple but are, finally, as complex as everyone\\". Long after (2016) he broadcast a daily TV chronicle about \\"la France de Campagnol\\" in the same spirit. He still claims to be the voice of \\"those who are never listened to\\" . His various columns and chronicles have included throughout the years J'informe, Le Figaro, L'Express, Jeune Afrique, Le Quotidien de Paris, Grands Reportages (1976-1987) and Valeurs actuelles (1995). He has also translated in French various novels and essays such as Wonder Boys by Michael Chabon or The Face of Battle by John Keegan. He has often stayed in New York City, where his brother was running a business. A few months before September 11, he wrote a futuristic novel, Une heure avant l'éternité, the paperback cover of which prophetically showed the twin towers hacked by a bayonet, picture shot from a New Jersey war monument facing Manhattan. No longer able to afford the cost of his flying licence, he took up hang-gliding and paragliding. After adopting the latter in its very first years (1987) he published, along with his friend Jacques Ségura, a flight manual, Parapente translated in several countries. At age 62 he is still flying his paraglider on a regular basis. As an academic sculptor, he started, in 2000, studying and practicing digital 3D, modelling, rendering, animation. It led him to foresee, in his novels, a future world where 3D immersion and entertainment would dominate every aspect of our lives. Because of an early passion for Hungary (his father had a Hungarian friend), he befriended the famous Hungarian art dealer Tibor de Nagy that he met in New York in 1980 ( who had never returned in Hungary since he fled Budapest in 1947), and he finally convinced him to travel back to his country before his death. This is part of the plot of the \\"Roman de Budapest\\", a novelized history of Budapest at the end of which Tibor de Nagy plays his own role, visiting the remains of a lost world. Settling in Budapest for a few months, Combaz wrote Franz (1994) a novel that takes place in the heart the Danubian city, and De l'Est de la Peste et du reste, a plea for a \\"cultural European parliament\\", that would be able to defend the core values of European civilization against \\"violence made commonplace, american taste applied to everything and everyone\\". In this essay he predicts that Europe will have to protect its values against the mandatory \\"diversity\\". In 2016, he tries to start a movement by founding an association, Europe is proud of Hungary, to resist the negative campaign initiated by most liberal newspapers who blame Hungary's rigid policy towards unwanted immigration. Combaz stresses that Hungary endured over 100 years of Islamic rule before the industrial revolution (Ottoman invasion, end of the 17th century), and says that the rest of Europe should bear this in mind. After having declined the French literary award ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1992 because he resented the policy of the minister of culture Jack Lang he finally accepted it from his opponent and successor Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres in 2004. He has also been awarded the annual Académie française prize \\"Eve Delacroix\\" in recognition for his fiction works. In 2006, he became director of the French Institute of Milan, (2006-2009). After two further years (2009-2011) spent at the head of another cultural delegation in Zaragoza (Spain) he got back to the Figaro and published various essays including in 2015 a literary document with the help of a world-famous Belgian endocrinologist Pr Balthazart, Les Âmes douces. In this book he abruptly, scientifically, questioned the religious notion of \\"against-nature\\" when it comes to homosexuality, a theme that is present in many of his novels, such as La Compagnie des ombres and La Barque de nuit.

A characteristic element of the Madagascan flora, it occurs in the central highlands, where it dominates a type of sclerophyllous forest or woodland. Tapia forest has a high ecological value due to the fauna and flora it harbours, and is of economic interest to the local population, e.g. for collection of tapia fruits, firewood, mushrooms or wild silkworms, and hunting. Local impact through fire and cutting is seen as a form of sustainable use however tapia woodlands are now found only in scattered, isolated stands totaling at most 132,255 ha. Native woody vegetation of the central highlands is increasingly replaced by grasslands, primarily due to increased fire frequency as areas are burned annually. Description Tapia is a tree that can grow high, but usually stays at . Leaves are alternate and sclerophyllous. The bark is thick and furrowed. The tree is monoecious; its flowers appear from March to September. Male flowers have five stamens and five tepals, and are clustered in dense balls with an involucre of 7–8 bracts. Female inflorescences are reduced to one flower with a trilocular ovary, surrounded by bracts. Fruits are drupes in diameter, green to yellow, and brown when ripe. They contain a sweet, sticky mesocarp and three seeds. Etymology The common name \\"tapia\\" is pronounced ta-pee in Malagasy. Tapia fruits are known as voan'tapia. The species epithet of the scientific name, \\"bojeri\\", refers to the type specimen's collector, Wenceslas Bojer. Distribution and habitat Tapia is endemic to the central highlands of Madagascar, in the Madagascar subhumid forests ecoregion, at altitudes ranging from . The main areas of occurrence are the Imamo zone west of the capital Antananarivo, the Col des Tapia (\\"saddle of the tapia\\") between Antsirabe and Ambositra, the Itremo massif, and Isalo National Park. Within a broader sub- arid to sub-humid region, tapia woodland is found in drier, rain-shadow microclimates, mainly on acidic soil on sandstone, quartzite and schist. Ecology In a vegetation type classified as \\"tapia forest\\" in the Atlas of the Vegetation of Madagascar, tapia is the dominant and character species. This forest has a high canopy, with other trees including several Anacardiaceae, Asteraceae, Asteropeiaceae, Rubiaceae, and Sarcolaenaceae. Trees are pyrophytes with a thick, fire-resistant bark. The understory is composed of ericoid shrubs, grasses, and frequently lianas. Degraded tapia forest has a more open canopy and is less diverse, with Sarcolaena oblongifolia and Pentachlaena latifolia dominating alongside tapia. A root- symbiotic tree, tapia forms both arbuscular mycorrhiza and ectomycorrhiza. Associated ectomycorrhizal fungi include the genera Afroboletus, Amanita, Boletus, Cantharellus, Gyroporus, Lactarius, Leccinum, Rubinoboletus, Russula, Scleroderma, Suillus, Tricholoma and Xerocomus. Among them are edible mushrooms such as the chanterelle species Cantharellus platyphyllus ssp. bojeriensis, only found under tapia. Regeneration of tapia mainly occurs through resprouting after coppicing and through root sprouts, similar to miombo woodlands in Eastern Africa. Seeds have only limited ability for dispersal and dormancy. Uses Tapia trees and the forests they form are used for several purposes by local communities. The edible fruits are collected once fallen, while a taboo (fady) prohibits plucking them directly from the tree. Fruits are not only consumed in local households but also marketed. The cocoons of the tapia silkworm Borocera madagascariensis (in Malagasy landibe) are also collected and used for the production of silk, traditionally used for burial shrouds. This wild silk equally has a local market importance. Other uses include the collection of fuelwood, mushrooms, berries, edible insects, herbal medicines, and hunting (including two species of tenrec). Conservation Tapia forest is valuable due to its endemic fauna and flora and its uses for local communities. Humans impact tapia forests mainly through collection of wood for fuel or timber, grazing, and fire. , tapia has not been assessed for the IUCN red list. The Atlas of the Vegetation of Madagascar estimated tapia forest loss at around 43% since the 1970s, but admits that tapia cover is likely overestimated with satellite imagery. The geographer Christian A. Kull argues that human interventions in tapia forests, including fire-setting and removal of dead wood, actually favour the growth of tapia trees and the associated silkworms. Rather than \\"forest\\", he uses the term \\"woodland\\" or \\"wooded savannas\\", implying a more open-canopy vegetation type. He suggests that tapia woodland has changed little in extent over the last century, and considers human impact a landscape \\"transformation\\" and form of sustainable use rather than a \\"degradation\\". Local legislation and traditions often ban the cutting of tapia trees. As main threat to tapia woodlands he sees the invasion by exotic trees, namely Eucalyptus and pines (Pinus khasya and P. patula).

Built about 1888, it is a good local example of vernacular Queen Anne Victorian architecture, built as worker housing in the growing city. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Description and history 22-26 Johnson Street is a 2-1/2 story wood frame building, set on the east side of Johnson Street a short way south of its junction with Peru Street. The Old North End neighborhood it stands in is just north of Burlington's central business district, and is densely built with residential buildings. The building is basically rectangular in shape, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Small porches project from near the rear of either side. The building's style is vernacular, with simple window surrounds and corner boards, and square columns supporting the hip- roofed porches. The building interiors retain only original floor layouts; the building houses two side-by-side two-story units. Eli Johnson built this house as part of his development of Johnson Street, begun in 1888. Johnson was a prominent local businessman, with a partnership interest in a printing firm and also in a retail pharmacy on College Street. He began the development during a period when the city's economic growth had led to housing shortages for working-class families. Although some of his buildings exhibit touches of Italianate and Queen Anne styling, this one is devoid of such more elaborate touches. Early residents of Johnson Street were typically of English or Irish extraction.

Jacques, Joseph Campau, and Barnabé Campau are among the Barons of Detroit, according to Richard R. Elliott, because they had \\"ancestral virtues most worthily perpetuated.\\" Chicago Roadalt= Map Joseph; Louis, Sr.; Louis, Jr.; and Barnabas Campau were fur traders, first selling their furs in Canada and then New York. Joseph was a merchant in Detroit and several trading posts and the others operated a number of trading posts in \\"Indian country\\". They were also involved in treaties between the Native Americans and the federal government, which were very lucrative endeavors. Joseph made millions as real estate promoter and was a civil servant for Detroit. Other family members established trading posts in places that came to be known as Manlius (1825),Township home page Eaton Rapids, Muskegon, Manistee, Lowell, and Hastings. George established a trading post at Maple Rapids. Louis Campau, Jr. established trading posts at Saginaw (1816) and Grand Rapids (1826). The descendants of Jacques and Michel, the 18th-century settlers of Detroit, were located in three cities: Detroit, Grand Rapids, and Chicago by the 20th- century. The coat of arms for the Campau family shows that they descended from a Baron of the Middle Ages. The surname is sometimes spelled \\"Campeau\\". First generation =Michel and Jacques Campau= The 1796 map illustrates ribbon farms flanking Fort Detroit (center, above Detroit River) and across the river at what is now Windsor, Canada. The ribbon farm concept originated with Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac's founding of the fort, first called Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit, in July 1701. (See also the original map that covers a wider area, including Belle Isle Park) Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit in 1701 and sold 68 land grants between 1707 and 1710, two of which were sold to the Campau brothers. Michel Chapau left Montreal and settled at Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit on August 3, 1707. He lived at the settlement with his wife, Jeanne Maas, and worked as a farmer. The couple had daughters named Jeanne and Marguerite (b. 1708) and a son, Paul Alexander (b. 1709). Michel died before 1740. On September 3, 1708, Jacques Campau (1677-1751) settled in Detroit. He was a blacksmith. Jacques and his wife Cecile Catlin has a son, Louis. Jacques was buried on May 14, 1751. Many of their descendants are buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit. The brothers parents were Etienne Campau and Catherine Paulo of Montreal. Their descendants were located by the 20th century in three cities: Detroit, Grand Rapids, and Chicago. Third generation =Joseph Campau= Joseph Campau (1769-1863) was the grandson of one of the original settlers to Fort Detroit and became the state's first millionaire through his real estate endeavors Jacques grandson, Joseph Campau (February 2, 1769 – July 23, 1863) was among Detroit's leading citizens and wealthiest landowners at the dawn of the 19th century. Joseph was the state's first millionaire. He made millions in the real estate industry and served in several public offices for the city. Campau held multiple public office positions in Detroit. He was City Trustee in 1802, City Treasurer, City Inspector of water barrels and City Assessor, appraiser, and over-seer of the poor. In 1802, he was an original trustee of Detroit and its incorporation. His daughter Catherine married Francis Palms, the largest landowner in Michigan during the mid-1850s. =Cecile Campeau= John R. Williams (May 4, 1782 - October 20, 1854), son of Cecile Campeau and Thomas Williams, was an American soldier, merchant, and politician who is most well known for serving as the first mayor of Detroit, Michigan. He also was a brigadier general in the United States Army during the Black Hawk War. Jacques granddaughter and Joseph's sister, Marie Cecile (Cecile) Campeau, was married to Thomas Williams by A.S. DePeyster, commandant of Fort Detroit on May 7, 1781. It was one of Detroit's early Protestant marriages. Her father was Jacques Chapeau and her brothers were Barnabas, Denis, Joseph, Louis, Nicolas and Toussaint Chapeau. Williams was a trader and licensed merchant, justice of the peace, and notary. Cecile and Thomas had three children: Catherine, Elizabeth, and John R. Elizabeth taught in a Catholic school that she co- founded under the auspices of Gabriel Richard, a Detroit priest. John R. Williams was the first mayor of Detroit. The Williams family remained in Detroit from that time. Thomas Williams died on November 30, 1785 and in July 1790, Cecile married Jaques Leson (also spelled Loson and Lauson) and they lived in what is now St. Clair County, Michigan. They had a daughter, Angelique. Cecile died on June 24, 1805 and was buried in the St. Anne's church cemetery. Third and/or fourth generation =Pierre Michel Campau= Pierre Michel Campau was the first white settler in Southgate, Michigan. He moved into the area in 1795, which subsequently became a farming community. Other people from the Detroit area at the Rouge and Detroit Rivers followed him to Southgate. =Louis Campau= Louis Campau established the first trading posts in Saginaw, Michigan and Grand Rapids, Michigan, which he is considered the \\"father\\" of the town. Louis Campau (August 11, 1791 – April 13, 1871), sometimes spelled Campeau, was son of Louis Campau, Sr. He began working the fur trade as a boy for his father and his uncle, Joseph Campau. During the War of 1812, he served under the United States Army. Campau was an important figure in the early settlement of two important Michigan cities. He established the first trading post at what is today Saginaw, Michigan, as early as 1815. He played a key role in negotiating the Treaty of Saginaw in 1819 between Gen. Lewis Cass and Native American tribes of the Great Lakes region in which Native Americans ceded more than six million acres (24,000 km²) in the central portion of the Lower Peninsula of the state. In 1826, Campau moved westward and established a trading post in what is today Grand Rapids. In 1831, he bought land for what is now the downtown business district of that city from the federal government for $90. Along with fellow pioneer Lucius Lyon, Campau is remembered as one of the founding fathers of Grand Rapids. =Antoine Campau= Antoine Campau, like his brother of Lewis, was a fur trader. Between 1815 and 1816, he was at the Saginaw trading post. According to James M. McClurken, Antoine has been believed to be the father of Odawa chief Cobmoosa, who first lived near Grand Rapids, Michigan. Cobmoosa led the Ojibwe, of a band of the Ottawa people, in Ionia, Michigan and sold their crops to the initial settlers of Ionia in 1833. He was also among those who went with Rix Robinson to negotiate a treaty for removal to Indian Territory, but he like other Ojibwe resisted that removal. In 1855 he signed a treaty with the federal government to relocate to Oceana County, Michigan in exchange for $540,000 in cash and goods. The government built a log cabin for him in Cobmoosa, Michigan and he along with 1300 others were located by 1858.

It aired in the United States on Fox on October 9, 2016. In the episode, Bart enrages Homer by becoming a fan of the Boston Americans (a parody of the New England Patriots). Homer takes the family on a \\"hate-cation\\" to Boston to show Bart how bad the city is, but the family fall in love with the city and move there. However, Bart soon discovers that Boston is not how he imagined it, and wants to go home. \\"The Town\\" received positive reviews and was the most watched show on Fox that night, with an audience of 3.22 million. It was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program. Plot Homer goes to Moe's Tavern to watch a football game between the Springfield Atoms and the Boston Americans, but they end up bitterly arguing with a group of Boston fans, calling their team cheaters and losers. Homer and the rest become enraged when the Americans win the game by throwing to their mascot, who was activated for the 53-man roster and reported in as an eligible receiver. Homer then says that he will lose his temper if he sees a Boston fan, but seconds later, he is surprised by a gleeful Bart wearing a Boston Americans cap as his son makes it plain he hates the hometown Atoms and loves Boston. Homer gets angry at Bart, but he decides to take him around Springfield to encourage him to cheer for the home team. Bart refuses and admits that people from Boston, specifically Southies, are his people. Homer gets so traumatized that he decides to take the family on a \\"hate-cation\\" to Boston to show Bart what a terrible place it actually is. During a visit to Faneuil Hall Marketplace, Homer unsuccessfully attempts to provoke the Bostonians, when a cart full of bobbleheads fall on him. When he is helped by doctors, Marge is impressed with the Massachusetts health-care system, as much as Lisa is impressed by the MIT campus. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart go candlepin bowling, and when Homer learns that the player gets a third ball in this version of the sport, he falls in love with both it and the city. Homer gives up on the hate-cation and decides to enjoy Boston with Bart. Back at the hotel, Marge and Homer talk about their experience in Boston and decide to move to the town, declaring the move to be their \\"third ball\\". The Simpsons rent an apartment and move all their possessions to Boston. Homer finds a job at the NEKCO candy factory and Lisa enjoys attending the Combat Zone Charter School. However, Bart realizes that he can no longer keep his reputation as a bad boy in school, as the children in detention focused their energy into a cappella singing, and that most of the town is made for intellectuals like Lisa. He decides to find a way to make the family move back to Springfield. Bart takes the family to the latest championship parade for the Americans, who used questionable tactics to win the crown. Homer tries to control his anger, but he gets enraged when asked to put on a Boston Americans' cap, ripping it into two and yelling that they are cheaters. The Simpsons then have to move back to Springfield, where Marge gets mad at Homer for making them lose that opportunity, but concludes that it would not have worked out for the family in Boston. Bart is now wearing a Springfield Atoms cap and Lisa is hallucinating about Boston. Production The episode was originally titled \\"Patriot Games\\", as seen in the script cover. However, the title was changed in January 2016 to \\"The Town\\". On Twitter, producer Matt Selman posted a still image from a deleted scene, in which Bart rides a city bike. \\"The Town\\" was rerun by Fox on February 12, 2017, a week after Super Bowl LI, where the New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–28 in the first ever Super Bowl game to enter overtime. As an easter egg, the final score of the Boston vs. Springfield football game was changed to reference the real-life result of Super Bowl LI. Selman explained that his team had proposed the idea whilst watching the game, having realized that \\"The Town\\" had been scheduled for a rerun the following week. Although the idea was a joke, Al Jean took it seriously. He added that \\"jamming the Super Bowl teams and score into one shot makes no sense in the show, but we couldn't resist.\\" The edit was exclusive to this airing. Reception \\"The Town\\" scored a 1.5 rating and was watched by 3.22 million viewers, making it the most watched show on Fox that night. \\"The Town\\" received positive reviews from critics. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B.\\" He recognized writer Dave King's experiences from Harvard University and the sports blog Fire Joe Morgan, and praised the cutting of the opening titles to fill the story. Screen Rant called it the best episode of the 28th season. The episode was nominated for Outstanding Animated Program at the 69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, losing to the Bob's Burgers episode \\"Bob Actually\\".

She was bred and owned by Khalid Abdullah and trained by Criquette Head-Maarek. As a juvenile in 2007 she showed very promising form, winning one minor race and being placed in the Prix Yacowlef, Prix d'Aumale and Prix des Réservoirs. In 2008 she won the Listed Prix du Pont-Neuf and then showed improved form when dropped to sprint distances, finishing second in the Prix Maurice de Gheest before recording her biggest win in the Group One Ladbroke Sprint Cup. She remained in training in 2009 but failed to reproduce her best form and was well beaten in three races. After her retirement from racing she became a broodmare and has had some success as a dam of winners. Background African Rose is a chestnut mare with a white blaze and four white socks bred in England by her owner Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms. Her sire Observatory was a top-class miler best known for an upset victory over Giant's Causeway in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 2000. As a breeding stallion he was best known as the sire of Twice Over. African Rose's dam New Orchid (a half-sister to Distant Music) showed some ability in a brief racing career, winning one minor race and finishing third in the Lancashire Oaks. She was a granddaughter of Populi, who was a half-sister to Temperence Hill and the dam of Vanlandingham. The filly was sent into training with Criquette Head-Maarek in France and was ridden in all but one of her races by Stéphane Pasquier. Racing career =2007: two- year-old season= On her racecourse debut African Rose was matched against colts in the Prix Yacowlef over 1000 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 3 July. Ridden by Christophe Soumillon she finished second of the eight runners, two and a half lengths behind the winner Stern Opinion. The filly was the moved up in distance for the Prix Vale over 1400 metres at Clairefontaine in August and recorded her first success, beating Aurore by three lengths. African Rose was then moved up in class and distance for the Group Three Prix d'Aumale over 1600 metres at Chantilly Racecourse in September ad finished third behind Top Toss and Mousse Au Chocolat. On her final appearance of the season African Rose finished third behind Gagnoa and Gipson Dessert in the Prix des Réservoirs at Deauville in October. =2008: three-year-old season= African Rose began her second season in the Prix Perruche Bleue over 1400 metres on heavy ground at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 22 April and finished third behind Destare and Belle Et Celebre. A month later the filly contested the Listed Prix du Pont-Neuf over the same distance at Longchamp Racecourse. Starting at odds of 2.6/1 she took the lead 200 metres from the finish and \\"ran on strongly\\" to win by one and a half lengths from Salut L'Africain with the favourite Gipson Dessert in fourth. In June over the same course and distance she finished fourth behind Vertigineux, Chantra and Snow Key in the Group Three Prix de la Porte Maillot. African Rose was then dropped back in distance for the Group One Prix Maurice de Gheest over 1300 metres at Deauville in August. Starting a 17/1 outsider she took the lead 200 metres from the finish but was overtaken in the final strides and beaten into second place by the favourite Marchand d'Or. African Rose was then sent to England for the Group One Ladbroke Sprint Cup. After the meeting at Haydock Park was abandoned the race was rescheduled and run at Doncaster Racecourse over six furlongs on 13 September. African Rose had spent a week in quarantine in the interim but appeared to suffer no ill effects. She was made the 7/2 favourite ahead of the Aidan O'Brien-trained US Ranger, whilst the other thirteen runners included Reverence, Utmost Respect (Chipchase Stakes), Corrybrough (Scurry Stakes), Balthazaar's Gift (Critérium de Maisons-Laffitte), Astronomer Royal (Poule d'Essai des Poulains), Diabolical (Alfred G Vanderbilt Handicap), Ancien Regime (Sprint Stakes), Assertive (Duke of York Stakes) and Wi Dud (Flying Childers Stakes). Pasquier restrained the filly towards the rear of the field on the stands-side (the right-hand side from the jockey's viewpoint) before making a forward move in the last quarter mile. She accelerated into the lead inside the final furlong and held off a strong late challenge from Assertive to win by a neck. Criquette Head said \\"It is fantastic. Doing what she has done, she has proved she is a good filly. She's tough and she can go anywhere now.\\" whilst Pasquier commented \\"I am very happy. She's a good filly and although she was a bit excited before the race she showed a wonderful turn of foot\\". On her final appearance of the season she finished seventh of the eight runners behind Paco Boy in the Prix de la Forêt over 1400 metres at Longchamp in October, fading badly in the closing stages. =2009: four-year-old season= African Rose remained in training as a four-year-old in 2009 but made little impact in three races. She finished fourth to Tax Free in the Prix du Gros Chêne over 1000 metres at Chantilly in May, sixth behind Fleeting Spirit in the July Cup and eleventh to King's Apostle in the Prix Maurice de Gheest. African Rose bled after the race and Criquette Head immediately announced the filly's retirement. Breeding record African Rose was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Juddmonte Farms. She has produced four foals and two winners: *African Plains, a bay filly, foaled in 2011, sired by Oasis Dream. Failed to win in five races. *Hakka, bay colt, 2012, by Dansili. Won two races. *Cosmos Pink, bay filly, 2013, by Dansili. Unplaced in her only start. *Fair Eva, chestnut filly, 2014, by Frankel. Won two races including Princess Margaret Stakes. Pedigree *African Rose was inbred 4 × 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

Bulgaria was given control of the islands of Thasos and Samothrace as well as a zone between the Strymon and Nestos rivers that later extended to Alexandroupolis. The Germans kept two thirds of Evros, central and western Macedonia, some islands in the Aegean, Attica and most of Crete. The remaining Greek territories were in Italian hands. Bulgaria officially annexed the occupied territories, which had long been a target of Bulgarian irredentism, on 14 May 1941.Mazower (2000), p. 276 A massive campaign of Bulgarisation was launched, which saw all Greek officials (mayors, school-teachers, judges, lawyers, priests, gendarmes) deported. A ban was placed on the use of the Greek language, and the names of towns and places changed to Bulgarian. In addition, the Bulgarian government tried to alter the ethnic composition of the region, by expropriating land and houses from Greeks in favour of Bulgarian settlers, and by the introduction of forced labour and of economic restrictions for the Greeks in an effort to force them to migrate. Protest and aftermath Communist Greek graphic with motive of the demonstration During the summer of 1943, the imminent Italian exit from the war and the consequent withdrawal of Italian troops from the Balkans would force the Germans to engage more Axis troops in garrison duties replacing the Italians. Thus, early in July 1943, Adolf Hitler asked the Bulgarian government to extend its occupation zone to encompass additional territory in Serbia and Macedonia. Upon receiving these news, Greeks became infuriated. A protest strike was called on July 13 in Athens and proved highly successful, paralyzing the city almost completely for 24 hours. Similar protests were organized in Thessaloniki and smaller cities in northern Greece. A second general strike was organized by EAM on July 22, which rallied between 100,000 and 300,000 (or even 400,000 according to some sources) people in central Athens. A massive crowd attempted to march from Omonoia Square towards Syntagma Square along Panepistimiou Street, but came across a barricade put up by mechanized German army forces, Italian cavalry and Greek collaborationist police. The protesters were fired upon during their attempt to breach the barricade and were forced to withdraw, leaving behind 22 dead and several hundred wounded. Workers and university students participated in large numbers in the protest. Several of them were killed, being either run over by armoured vehicles or fired upon. Among them, Panagiota Stathopoulou () and Koula Lili () are two of the most remembered today. Soon after the protest, the plans to extend the Bulgarian occupation zone were postponed indefinitely and never materialized.

Koreans created a unique and distinct pagoda tradition using stone. History Pagodas were created in India using earth, then in China using wood, which spread to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, and then Japan; however, the pagoda tradition of East Asia diverged, with China creating pagodas using bricks, Korea creating pagodas using stone, and Japan continuing to use wood. Korean stone pagodas were first created in Baekje during the early 7th century and then inherited by Later Silla; 90% of the pagodas in Later Silla were made of stone. The stone pagoda tradition was propagated by the great abundance of high quality granite in Korea, which also led to other granite creations such as the Seokguram and Cheomseongdae. Goryeo, a devoutly Buddhist state, also inherited the stone pagoda tradition. Examples of Korean wood pagodas are the Hwangnyongsa Pagoda and Palsangjeon of Silla.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description Panulirus polyphagus grows to a length of about . The antennal plate bears two large spines and there are no transverse grooves on the abdominal segments. Distinctive colour features by which this species can be distinguished from other spiny lobsters include a greenish-grey background colour and a thin white band near the hind edge of each segment. In Europe, the otherwise similar native species, the north eastern Atlantic spiny crawfish (Panulirus regius), has four large spines on the antennal plate, and smooth grooves on the abdominal segments. Distribution and habitat Panulirus polyphagus has a wide distribution in the tropical Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from India and Pakistan, through the Philippines and Indonesia to northwestern Australia and southeastern New Guinea. It is usually found on rocky reefs or on muddy seabeds, often at the mouths of rivers, at depths down to and exceptionally to more than double this depth. This spiny lobster is sometimes imported into Europe and may be found at markets in continental Europe and the United Kingdom. Status This species is caught for human consumption. It is harvested in India in the Mumbai region and the northwest between November and March, but seems to be overexploited as catches are declining in size. It is also caught in Indian waters as bycatch, especially on muddy substrates. In Thailand there is a commercial fishery with the spiny lobsters being sold in local markets.

Although born and educated in England, he moved to America in 1873 with his father and step-mother. After inheriting his father's title, he moved back to England, where he lived the rest of his life. Life and career Charles Pellew was born on 11 March 1863 in London, England.U.S. Passport application, 1922. His father, Henry Pellew, was the grandson of Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth, a British admiral who saw action in the American War of Independence and the Napoleonic Wars. Charles was Henry Pellew's second son, his older brother being the writer George Pellew. His mother was Eliza Jay, the daughter of a judge from New York and a descendant of John Jay, the Van Cortlandt family, the Livingston family, and the Schuyler family. His step-mother was Augusta Jay – his mother's sister. The family came to the United States in 1873, and Charles Pellew, being a minor at the time of his father's naturalisation in 1877, then automatically became a United States citizen upon attaining the age of 21.Duplicate copy of the U.S. Naturalization Certificate of Henry Pellew, 1877. He married Miss Margaret W. Chandler, who was the daughter of Dr. Charles T. Chandler, a Dean of Columbia College, on 29 April 1886 at St Thomas's Church, New York. On 18 February 1892, his older brother, George Pellew, died from a concussion when he fell down a flight of stone stairs while walking in New York City. An inflammation of the eyes had temporarily caused him to be partially blind. Pellew graduated from the Columbia School of Mines in 1884. From 1886 until 1897, he was a professor at the College of Physicians and Surgeons. His appointment to this post, by his father-in-law, Dr. Charles Chandler, who was the Dean of the College of Mines, was not without some controversy.Robert McCaughey, A Lever Long Enough, (2014), p. 62. During the same time period, he became the president of the Berkshire Industrial Farm in Canaan Four Corners, New York, but he resigned this position shortly after being appointed a chemistry professor at Columbia College, where he remained until 1911. His father had previously been president of the farm. Advertisement for the New York Society of Craftsmen courses during the summer of 1920. In addition to being a professor at Columbia College, Pellew wrote at least one chemistry book, and he was a frequent public lecturer on many topic topics including alcoholism, dyes and dyeing of fabrics, and chemistry. He served as the president of the New York Society of Craftsmen at the Art Centre in New York City, and his professional memberships included the American Federation of Arts as well as the American Chemical Society. He was a Fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences. When Dr. Chandler, his father-in-law, resigned as the Chairman of the Chemistry Department at Columbia College, Pellew, along with the rest of the department faculty as a matter of formality, also resigned. Pellew was surprised though when his resignation was accepted. He then became a consulting chemist. Pellew had been consulting on projects for many years. One notable example was his appointment, along with a commission of 16 other men, by the President of the United States, Grover Cleveland, \\"...to examine and test the fineness and weight of coins...\\" for the US Mint. These tests, known as the \\"Annual Trial of Coins,\\" were conducted on 8 February 1888 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They examined coins produced in 1887 from each of the different US Mint branches. All coins were found to be within the tolerances allowed by federal laws.Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury, State of the Finances, Year of 1888, U.S. GPO, Washington, D.C., 1888, pp. 134–135. Peerage When Henry Pellew, Charles' father, inherited the viscountcy from the fifth Viscount Exmouth on 17 August 1922 at the age of 94, Henry tried to prevent himself from being elevated to the peerage. The British Embassy in Washington informed him that whether or not he ever went to London and sat in the House of Lords, the titles belonged to him. His father also found out that he could not directly pass the titles on to his son Charles. Because of the advanced age of his father, Charles Pellew was the person who went to England to settle the estate of the fifth Viscount Exmouth. His father, Henry Pellew, died on 4 February 1923, less than six months after inheriting the title of Viscount Exmouth. Charles Pellew, being the only surviving son of Henry Pellew, then became the seventh Viscount Exmouth. Charles Pellew's wife had died of pneumonia less than a year earlier. He married Miss Mabel Gray on 12 May 1923, in the St. Ambrose Chapel of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. Upon their marriage she became Mabel, Viscountess Exmouth. The couple sailed to England on 22 August 1923 so that Pellew could claim his seat in the House of Lords. Upon arriving in England, he notified the English authorities that he intended to become a British subject again and take his seat in the Lords. News accounts in 1923 stated it was necessary for him to reside in England for five years to become a British subject before he could take his seat with the rest of the Lords; however, it was not until 1931 that he was finally able to sit in that chamber. In April 1931, Pellew finally provided a statement as to why he became a British subject. He stated that before his father's death, he asked, \\"'. . . me to come to England and be of some service to the family and the country of my birth,' Lord Exmouth said. 'His dying wish was that I spend my life here [in England], and I am doing my best to gratify it.'\\" The Honourable Anne Pellew, the only child of Charles and Margaret Pellew, died in Paris, France, on 11 January 1928 while recovering from an operation. Services for her were held at the American Church in Paris on 14 January 1928. Charles Pellew did not have any children with his second wife. When he died on 7 June 1945 at Hindhead, Surrey, England, he was 82 years old. He was buried in the family vault at St. James's Parish Church (Saint James Churchyard) in Christow, Devon, England. His wife, Mabel, Viscountess Exmouth, died on 28 March 1949, at the age of 77, also at Hindhead. Upon his death, the title of Viscount Exmouth went to Edward Irving Pownoll Pellew, his 77-year- old cousin, who was living in Pau, France. He became the eighth Viscount Exmouth. Military service Pellew served on active duty with the US Army and later with the New York National Guard. On 2 May 1898, Charles Pellew enlisted as a sergeant in Troop A, New York Volunteer Cavalry, and he was mustered into this unit on 20 May 1898. He travelled with this unit to Falls Church, Virginia, where he was discharged on 6 June 1898 to accept appointment as a first lieutenant in the US Army Signal Corps.Headquarters of the Army, Special Orders, No 131, 4 June 1898Headquarters of the Army, Special Orders, No 132, 6 June 1898 Pellew was then sent to Tampa, Florida where he was assigned to the 15th Company, Signal Corps, US Volunteers for duty. One of his duties was to assist in the experiments being made with observation balloons. He was then appointed a captain on 1 August 1898,New York, Spanish–American War Military and Naval Service Records, 1898–1902.Register of General Officers and Officers of the General Staff, U.S. Volunteers, Adjutant General's Office, War Department, 1 March 1899, p. 12. transferred to Camp Wikoff at Montauk Point, Long Island, New York, and honourably discharged from the service on 10 September 1898. He later served as a member of the New York 12th Infantry during 1915 – 1916. Public service Pellew served on the Board of Managers of the Burnham Industrial Farm, later called the Berkshire Industrial Farm, which was an institution devoted to the reformation of boys, eight to sixteen years of age, that tended toward the criminal life. The school provided strict discipline and work to encourage them to lead a more productive life. Pellew served on the Committee for the Promotion of Agriculture helping to find a location for a new agricultural school in the New York area. The committee chose the Briarcliff Farm, on 67 acres of land, 27 miles from New York near Sing Sing. This later became the School of Practical Agriculture which moved to 415 acres of land near Poughkeepsie, New York. Pellew remained with the new organisation as a trustee. Pellew served as a founding member and director of the Arts Center, Inc. which brought seven organisations together to promote the arts and make them available to everyone. Pellew helped organise the Washington (D.C.) Handicraft Guild in May 1921, and he assisted in providing artwork for the Guild's first exhibition in May 1922.

She is well known for her poetry which was published in Umteteli wa Bantu, a multilingual weekly Johannesburg newspaper, from 23 October 1920 until 5 January 1929. The poet's body of work from this period has cemented her place as one of the greatest literary artists ever to write in isiXhosa. Her poetry has been described as swaggering, urgent, confrontational and said to reveal more about the identity and struggles of an urban Christian black woman from the 19th century than other texts of that era. Personal life Not much is known of Nontsizi's Mgwetho's personal life. Traces of her origins come from her poetry as it was published on Umteteli wa Bantu. Mgqwetho referred to herself as \\"Imbongi uChizama\\" (poet from the Chizama clan) and later as \\"Yimbongikazi uChizama\\"- meaning female poet from the Chizama clan. Chizama was her father's clan name. Mgqwetho reveals her mother's identity as Emmah Jane Mgqwetho, the daughter of Zingelwa, of the Cwerha clan, and she associates her with the Hewu district near Queenstown in a poem lamenting her death, which was published on 2 December 1922 in Umteteli Wabantu. In another poem that appeared on 18 December 1920, she criticizes L. T. Mvabaza, the editor of Abantu Batho, for bragging that he had brought her from Peddie to Johannesburg, so she seems to have lived near Peddie, possibly at Tamara, before moving to the former Transvaal. Mgqwetho is likely to have penned two prose contributions to the King William's Town newspaper Imvo zabantsundu on 20 May and 14 October 1897, both signed Cizama (coming from Tamara near Mount Coke between King William's Town and Peddie ). Professor in African Languages Abner Nyamende, recognizes in Mgqwetho's poetry quotations from the Moravian liturgy, which suggests that she may well have been educated in the Eastern Cape by the Moravians, probably at Shiloh in the Hewu district. It is unclear what Mgqwetho had come to Johannesburg for but her first poem was sent to the publications from the Crown Mines. Mgqwetho and her sister, Mary, may have stayed in the Rand to organise dances, with dance being a recurrent theme in her poetry. Mgqwetho and her sister Mary may have remained unmarried as a 1949 newspaper article refers to them as Miss Nontsizi and Mary Mgqwetho. Mgqwetho, in one of her poems, also describes herself as physically awkward and unmarried: Taru'. Dadakazi lendaba zaseAfrika Ubh'ibh'inxa lwentombi esinqe simbi Awu!Nontsizi bulembu eAfrika Akusoze wende nezinto ezigoso (Mercy, duck of African thickets ungainly girl of ill-shaped frame Awu! Nontsizi, African moss with bow-legs like yours you'll never marry!) Poetry Nontsizi Mgqwethu burst onto the scene when her first poem (signed \\"Imbongi uChizama\\"), which was published on Umteteli wa Bantu on 23 October 1920. She soon changed the name to \\"Yimbongikazi Nontsizi Mgqwetho uChizama\\" (Female poet Chizama) on her second until the eight poem. On her ninth poem published in December 1920 she was using Imbongikazi uNontsizi Mgqwetho. In 1921 and 1922 she was published three times on Umteteli wa Bantu. She returned in December 1923 and was published every week until September 1926. Between 23 October 1920 and 4 September 1926 Umteleli published 95 poems and three articles by Mgqwetho. She then took a two-year break before returning to have two final poems published in Umteteli wa Bantu on 22 December 1928 and 5 January 1929. Mgqwetho disappeared into obscurity and was never heard of again. Mgqwetho's poetry was always in opposition to male dominance. Her insistence on the use of Imbongikazi, the feminine form of imbongi(praise poet) signals her stance as a woman. During Mgqwetho's time, the rural praise poet, imbongi, was always a male, so she would have been barred from public performances in honour of the chief. This dominance by male poets is exhibited by the fact that isiXhosa poet SEK Mqhayi who was a frequent contributor to Umteteli wa Bantu at the same time as Mgwetho received national recognition, while she did not. In this poem below Mgqwetha shows opposition to male dominance in poetry. Kuba tina simadoda nje asizange Siyibone kowetu imbongokazi Yenkazana kuba imbongi inyuka Nenkundla ituke inkosi (We as men have never encountered these female poets in our homes Because a poet—a male— rouses the court and censures the king) A Christian, Mgqwetho supported \\"manyanos\\" (church groups for women) as they were the only space in which Christian women could speak freely. However, in her poetry Mgqwetho reveals her opposition to Christianity, which she deems the tool of oppression. Zay'konxa! Afrika ngamakandela NangeBhayibhile, nemipu, zayikahlela (They clapped shackles on you, hurled you down with a bible and musket) One of her most powerful poems \\"Mayibuye Afrika\\" (Come back Africa) displays her political stance. In the poem, Mgqwetho laments the loss and exploitation of African land and resources. She further displays her position by adopting a critical stance of the African National Congress and its leaders, whom she castigates for fragmenting rather than unifying black opposition, and she constantly appeals for black unity in the face of white oppression. The title of the poem published on 19 July 1924 is 'Strangers strip people selfishly squabbling.' She defends Marshall Maxeke, the first editor of Umteteli, and celebrates his wife, the civil rights activist Charlotte Maxeke. A prose contribution published on 13 December 1924 records her own involvement in the April 1919 mass demonstration against passes in Johannesburg. Legacy Nontsizi Mgqwetho's poetry was compiled into a book titled The Nation’s Bounty: The Xhosa Poetry of Nontsizi Mgqwetho by Jeff Opland, Visiting Professor of African Language and Literatures at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, and Research Fellow in the Department of African Languages, University of South Africa, Pretoria. It was published in 2007. Mgqwetho has often been described as one of the early black urban feminist voices in the 20th century.

History A church at the site dedicated to St George Martyr had been present since the 14th century. The church had a single nave and one chapel. It was enlarged over the next centuries, but completely rebuilt over the ruins of the earlier church in 1752 to 1755, and rededicated to San Giorgio martire and the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception, whose veneration was growing by this period. The belltower was added in 1932, to replace once erected in 1891, which itself replaced the 14th-century tower that had been razed in the 1750s enlargement of the church. The interior now contains a number of canvases, including a major work of Stefano Maria Legnani, depicting St Joseph and the Child Jesus with attendant angels (1693). This work was originally painted for the former church of San Marcellino in Milan, but came into the possession of the Brera Academy, and was place at Carimate in 1815 upon request of the parish priest for four works to embellish the church. The church has a chapel dedicated to St Carlo Borromeo (died 1610), with an altarpiece depicting the then-recently canonized bishop of Milan by Giovanni Battista Crespi (1575-1632). Finally, up high in the choir and organ loft, near the organ, is a canvas depicting St Elizabeth in Ecstasy. This painting was moved to Carimate in 1815 from the Brera Academy, who had obtained the painting from the suppressed church of the Capuchin order of Forlì. The work is attributed to a Giuseppe Maria Galeppini. The organ was built in 1761 by Antonio Fontana of Milan. In 1837, the instrument was refurbished by the brothers Prestinari of Magenta.Comune of Carimate, entry on the church derived from “Carimate tra la storia e la cronaca”; various authors; ed.

Morphology  Salamandra atra pasubiensis differs from all other subspecies of S. atra in the individual variability of the body colour. The body surface is mainly uniformly black, with a variable number and extent of yellow and brown patches on the dorsal surface of the head, the trunk, the limbs and the tail. The patches are very similar to those found in 'S. atra aurorae', however much smaller and covering only a minor part of the dorsal surface. Extent and arrangement of the patches are highly variable between individuals, some of which are even entirely black, like in S. atra atra and S. a. prenjensis. The colour pattern is established at birth and it is assumed to change only slightly with growth, like in S. atra aurorae. The sexual dimorphism is very slight. Like in other subspecies of S. atra, the cloacal region is usually swollen in the adult males.  Distribution  Salamandra atra pasubiensis lives only on the Pasubio massif, in the Venetian Prealps, Northeast Italy. All documented and reliable records are from two adjacent small valleys on the southern slope of the massif, and refer most probably to a single population. The known area of occupancy is less than 2 km2 and the altitudinal range is 1450–1800 m. There are a few other reports of alpine salamanders from other parts on the Pasubio massif and from the nearby Carega massif, but all these records are unconfirmed.  Threats, conservation status and management  Salamandra atra pasubiensis, Monte Pasubio, July 2016 The rocky, steep valleys inhabited by S. atra pasubiensis are only marginally exploited for wood harvesting and cattle pasture, and are visited almost only by hikers and hunters. Therefore, S. atra pasubiensis is not threatened directly by human activities, but the narrow extent and the isolation of the suitable habitat increases vulnerability in the face of the general climatic trend. According to regional assessments following IUCN criteria, S. atra pasubiensis has been considered as Endangered (EN), under criterion D1, because it seems to be present in a single site, the population size could be less than 250 individuals and it is threatened by the general climatic trend. The single known population of S. atra pasubiensis is in the Veneto Region, specifically in the Province of Vicenza. It is entirely in the Natura 2000 site IT3210040 “Monti Lessini - Pasubio - Piccole Dolomiti Vicentine”. Salamandra atra pasubiensis is not considered in the EU Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC because it was unknown at the time.  Taxonomy  270x270px After a few uncertain or undocumented reports, the presence of a differentiated population of S. atra on the Pasubio massif was eventually confirmed in 1999. This population has been named as a distinct subspecies in 2005, because it is chromatically and genetically differentiated from both S. atra atra and S. atra aurorae, and geographically separated from the remaining species range. The type locality is “Val Fontana d'Oro” and the holotype has been deposited in the Zoological Museum La Specola in Florence.

He recorded only one solo album, but he played the harmonica on recordings by J. B. Hutto and Eddie Taylor. AllMusic commented that his album Whup It! Whup It! was \\"an admirable shot at recreating the '50s Chicago harp sound\\". Life and career George Mayweather Jr. was born in Montgomery County, Alabama. He learned to play the harmonica after receiving the instrument as a Christmas present at the age of six. Inspired by the playing of Sonny Boy Williamson I, Mayweather mainly taught himself the rudiments of the instrument. Upon his relocation to Chicago, Illinois, in September 1949, he befriended Little Walter, who taught him techniques of harmonica playing. He lived in Chicago, next door to J. B. Hutto, and in 1951 he teamed up with Hutto and the percussionist Eddie \\"Porkchop\\" Hines to form the Hawks, a trio performing on weekends at the Maxwell Street market. With few opportunities for steady work, Mayweather alternately performed with Hutto and in Bo Diddley's backing ensemble. In 1952, when Little Walter left Muddy Waters's touring band, Montgomery was offered a job as his replacement, but Mayweather declined the potentially lucrative position. By 1954, Mayweather recorded with Hutto in sessions for Chance Records, which produced \\"Dim Lights\\", \\"Things Are So Slow\\", \\"Combination Boogie\\", and \\"Pet Cream Man\\". He later teamed up Eddie Taylor, and together they recorded a number of tracks, including \\"You’ll Always Have a Home\\" and \\"Don’t Knock at My Door\\". Several of these were released as singles, but they were not commercial successes. Mayweather continued working in Chicago during the 1950s and was given the nickname \\"Earring\\" by Big Bill Hill, a Chicago disc jockey. In the late 1980s, Mayweather relocated to Boston, Massachusetts, and gained regular employment at the 1369 Jazz Club. In 1992, Mayweather recorded his first solo album, ‘Whup It! Whup It!’, using musicians from the Magic Rockers band, which backed Luther \\"Guitar Junior\\" Johnson, the album comprised mostly Chicago blues standards, made notable by Howlin' Wolf (\\"Forty Four\\"), Ray Charles (\\"What'd I Say\\"), Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers and Little Walter. There was one original track, \\"Cheatin' on Me\\", written by Mayweather. The AllMusic music journalist Bill Dahl noted that the album was \\"an admirable shot at recreating the '50s Chicago harp sound\\". Mayweather died of liver cancer in Boston, in February 1995, at the age of 67. Discography { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - !

Action as a literary mode  \\"Action is the mode [that] fiction writers use to show what is happening at any given moment in the story,\\" states Evan Marshall, who identifies five fiction-writing modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background. Jessica Page Morrell lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition. Peter Selgin refers to methods, including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description. While dialogue is the element that brings a story and its characters to life on the page, and narrative gives the story its depth and substance, action creates the movement within a story. Writing a story means weaving all of the elements of fiction together. When it is done right, weaving dialogue, narrative, and action can create a beautiful tapestry. A scene top-heavy with action can feel unreal because it is likely that characters doing something—anything at all—would be talking during the activity.

At an early stage, east and west aisles were added as transepts, giving the church its cruciform plan. Over time, the town of Greenock grew around the church, which was enlarged and had galleries added to accommodate the congregation. From 1761 other churches were built to serve the growing population, and in 1841 the Old West Kirk was closed when the congregation moved to a new West Kirk. The old kirk gradually became derelict, then it was heavily restored and reopened on Christmas Day 1864. The architect James Salmon supervised the works and added a tower, and the church subsequently incorporated a major collection of Pre-Raphaelite stained glass windows. Shipyards developed between the churchyard and the Clyde, and in 1917 Harland and Wolff began negotiations to enlarge their yard over the churchyard. They provided a site further along the coast, and built the Pirrie Hall on the new site as a church hall which was used as temporary accommodation for the congregation from February 1925, while the kirk was rebuilt. In January 1928 the Old West Kirk opened in its new location on the Esplanade of Greenock. In 2011 it was amalgamated with two other churches into the Lyle Kirk, Greenock. It is opened to the public on days when cruise ships call at Greenock, and Inverclyde Tourist Group provide guided visits with a talk on the history of the kirk. Context The Schaw Aisle, and the Sailor's Loft over the nave The feudal barony of Greenock lay along the southern shore of the River Clyde estuary, where it opens out into the Firth of Clyde, between the Devol Burn at its eastern boundary to the Barony of Finlaystone in the parish of Kilmacolm, and the West Burn at the boundary to Finnart. Around 1400 Malcolm Galbraith died with no sons, and Greenock was divided between his daughters to become two baronies: the eldest married Crawfurd of Kilbirnie and inherited Easter Greenock Castle, while Wester Greenock went to the younger daughter who married Schaw of Sauchie. Around 1540 the adjoining area of Finnart passed to the Schaw family, extending their holdings westward to the boundary of Gourock, and in 1542 John Schaw founded Wester Greenock castle. At this time there is no record of any village; retainers and servants lived at the castles, while most of the inhabitants were fishing families in temporary huts in small straggling groups on the coast. There were a few chapels: one at Chapelton overlooking the Devol Burn, and St. Lawrence near Wester Greenock castle (at what later became the south-east corner of Virginia and Rue-end Streets). Near the West Burn, the name Kilblain suggests a cell or chapel of Saint Blane. Foundation The Scottish Reformation of 1560 closed the Greenock chapels, and the parish church was set up around distant at Inverkip, a return journey of over difficult terrain., the modern road distance from the Wester Greenock Castle site at PA15 4AA to the original location of Inverkip kirk at PA16 0BJ is 5.7 miles An early Church Commission later cited authorities including \\"Johne Craufurd of Kilburnie Johne Schawe of Greenok\\" and \\"Patrick Rae in Chapeltone\\" to support their assessment (in Scots miles) of the distance as \\"four large myles vith dyveris great burnes and watteris in the way quhill in the vinter sessone are vnpassable and the number of people many.\\" Schaw used his influence at court to overcome this problem, and on 18 November 1589 James VI of Scotland granted a charter, signed at \\"Halyruid- hous\\", authorising Schaw to build a church and a manse, and set out a graveyard. King James was \\"movit with the ernest zeill and grite affection our lovit Johnne schaw of grenok hes ay had to goddis glorie and propagatioun of the trew religioun\\", and approved the aim that the \\"puir pepill\\" dwelling upon his lands and heritage, who were \\"all fischers and of a ressounable nowmer, duelland four myles fra their parroche kirk, and having ane greit river to pas over to the samyn, May haif ane ease in winter seasoun\\". Sketch of the kirk as it was from around 1700 to 1841. The church was then built at a cost of 3,000 merks Scots, or £166 133. 4d. sterling, and was opened on 4 October 1591. This was the first Presbyterian church built in Scotland following the Scottish Reformation. In 1592 the Parliament of Scotland passed an act \\"For appreving of the kirk biggit be Johnne Schaw of Grenok\\", making it the first presbyterian church confirmed by the parliament. The Act reiterated the original charter., Act For appreving of the kirk biggit be Johnne Schaw of Grenok (3 April 1592), The Records of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707, K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2016), date accessed: 24 September 2016 Another act of parliament in 1594 disjoined Schaw's lands of Greenock, Finnart, and Spangock from Inverkip, and assigned them to the new parish of Greenock, but it was not until 1636 that the lords commissioners for the plantation of churches decreed that the parish should also cover Easter Greenock and various other lands, with Shaw of Greenock as the patron of the enlarged parish. Johnne Schawe died in 1593, he may have been buried under the east aisle. Original location and layout Entrance to the Schaw Aisle The church stood in its Kirkyard towards the east end of its glebe of green fields at the seaside coast of the River Clyde, adjacent to the west bank of the West Burn estuary. The manse was to the north of the kirkyard, near the sea. The kirk's rectangular nave was oriented roughly north–south, with the entrance at the south gable. Inside, paving just over wide ran from there to the north wall, and formed a passageway. A communion table in the style of the time ran the full length of the passageway, with seats on each side and a recess at about the middle of the table for the minister to take the communion service. Except on Sacrament Sundays, these seats were reserved for the poor as a place of honour. The main part of the floor was earthen, at some stage covered by open timber slats. The earth could still be seen between the slats, and over the years a number of coins fell through. The church windows were fitted with clear glass in small square panes, the walls were whitewashed inside, and it had a flat plaster ceiling. Aisles added to the east and west formed transepts which gave the church a cruciform plan. A later claim that the east wing had been in possession of the Schaws from the outset suggests that this aisle was built in 1591, the west wing may have been built at the same time. =Development= View from the nave, with the Cartsburn Aisle on the left, looking towards the Farmer's Loft. A fishing community settled near the kirk, with Rue End to the east referring to the \\"row end\\" of an early row of cottages: the 1654 Blaeu Atlas of Scotland shows \\"Grinok toune\\". Around this time, a curved dyke near the Crawfurd house at Cartsburn formed the first harbour in the area, and from 1671 the village of Cartsdyke developed at this pier., Blaeu Atlas of Scotland, 1654, John Ainslie, 1800 (National Library of Scotland website) Congregations began to exceed the capacity of the kirk. In 1635, when the parish was extended to include the Easter Greenock lands of Crawfurd of Kilbirnie, the \\"Laird of Kilburnie\\" offered to enlarge the south aisle by . This had still not been done when a Presbytery meeting in 1657 proposed extending the church to the east, but the Schaw Laird of Greenock objected as the east aisle was \\"appointed for him, and whereof he had been in continual possession since the erection of the kirk\\", and protested at the proposed expense to his tenants. In 1674 Craufurd of Cartsburn offered to bear a proportion of the costs of enlarging the church with sufficient seats for his family and tenants, a new manse, and a school for \\"training up the young ones\\". In 1677 there was agreement for the Lairds of Greenock to fund expanding the north and south aisles, while Thomas Craufurd was to fund extending the west aisle; \\"the side walls and gavels to be the height and breadth of the auld building. The pulpit to be placed in the west corner of the south aisle.\\" About 1696 the west (Carts-burn) aisle and north gable were extended by , and the south gable by , so the cruciform church was now overall about from north to south, and over the transepts. A new two storey extension was built at north side of the Schaw aisle, with Sir John Schaw's retiring room on the first floor. The ground floor, with open arches supported on a pillar, was used as a mortuary. Scale model of a 20-gun frigate suspended above the Sailor's loft. Lofts (or galleries) with nearly level floors were added above the main ground floor; permission was given on 9 December 1697 to build the Sailors' Loft above the south aisle, which then had the only stair inside the church. The Farmer's Loft was built above the north aisle, and the west gallery was the Cartsburn Loft. Adjacent to it, a gallery forming the family seat of the Crawfurds of Cartsburn was built against the north wall of their aisle, appearing rather like a four-poster bed. The family seat of James Watt's parents and grandparents was below this gallery. The Schaw east aisle was fully taken up by Sir Michael's gallery which projected out from the wall and had two oak pillars and two pilasters holding up a canopy over something like three private boxes. A sixth small gallery containing three pews extended from this gallery to the Farmer's Loft. At this time the church had seven doors, including gallery doors which led to external stairs. When Schaw's retiring room was converted into the vestry, it still had access only through the east aisle gallery, so the minister had to go outside, down the external stair and round to a ground floor door near the pulpit. Greenock was boosted by the construction of its harbour in 1710, and the growth of shipbuilding began when John Scott's started building fishing boats on the east bank of the West Burn a year later. By 1729 there were proposals to build a second church for the increasing population: from 1741 services were held in a large loft in the Royal Close, near Rue-End street. In 1758 work began in Cathcart Square on the Mid Kirk, which opened in 1761. At this time, the original church became known as the Old Parish Church, and later the West Parish Church. From 1774, more churches followed. The walls of the West church were raised by about in 1767, prior to renewal of the roof. A new Manse to the west was feued in 1787. In the 1790s the pews were square. =Decay, closure in 1841= 1786 grave of Highland Mary, marked by 1842 monument. The Kirkyard was expanded in 1657 and 1721 to provide increased graveyard space, but in 1773 a request for further extension was resisted due to pressure of demand for land in the town. After prolonged litigation, the Inverkip Street cemetery on the south side of the town was opened in 1786. This is the burial place of John Galt. Mary Campbell (Highland Mary), a love of Robert Burns, was on a visit to her brother Robert, who was in Greenock to become an apprentice at Scott's Shipyard, when he fell ill. She nursed him, but fell ill herself, and died around October 1786, probably from typhus. She was buried in the old West Kirk churchyard, in a plot owned by her relative Peter McPherson. Further expansion of the church was restricted by the full graveyard, which was about higher than the sparred earthen church floor. The kirk became damp and insanitary: for ventilation in summer, the doors had to be kept open. In 1835 the Presbytery was petitioned for improvements, but after investigation they concluded that it would be cheaper to build a new church on a different site. A site was chosen in 1838, then in 1841 the old church was closed and the congregation moved to the new West Church in Nelson Street. During the Disruption of 1843 the minister and most of the congregation of the Gaelic Parish joined the Free Church and were granted temporary use of the old kirk for a year and a half while their new church was built in Jamaica Street. After that the old kirk again stood empty, and increasingly fell into disrepair. Restored in 1864 View from the Sailor's Loft to the Farmer's Loft, with the steeply raked Schaw Aisle on the right Proposals to restore the old kirk were at first \\"laughed at as a Utopian idea\\", but subscriptions were raised and extensive restoration work was carried out in 1864 under the supervision of the architect James Salmon. The interior was gutted, and the old earthen floor dug out to lay an asphalt damp- proof layer: over 70 copper coins and two silver coins were found, the earliest from 1634; a silver shilling was dated 1824. The exterior walls were rebuilt in places and faced ashlar, and a church tower designed by Salmon was built at this time, incorporated stairs serving the Cartsburn Loft and the Farmer's Loft in place of the old external stairs. The walls were lined with lath and plaster painted a warm cream colour, and dark stained timber linings to the roof formed the ceiling. The church re-opened on Christmas Day, 1864. In 1872 the kirk was officially named the North Parish Church, but remained generally known as the Old West Kirk. The galleries were now more steeply sloped. The Cartsburn gallery was rebuilt in 1873, and an organ fitted there in 1874. Across the nave, the Schaw aisle, then called the Sir Michael's gallery, was built with its front now a low wall in line with the nave, about high, and was steeply raked with four pews rising up to the level of the door leading to its external stairway. There were now only two other outside doors to the church: one was added to the old mortuary which became a porch, and the main entrance door was now in the centre of the gable to the Cartsburn Aisle. The Cartsburn gable, Lamb window over the main entrance =Stained glass windows= The kirk obtained a major collection of Pre-Raphaelite stained glass windows through the efforts of Allan Park Paton, librarian of the Greenock Library, who consulted Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and received a response from William Morris in February 1865. The largest window in the church, at the Cartsburn gable, was supplied by Morris & Co. and is by Edward Burne-Jones on the topic of \\"Adoration of the Lamb\\". It includes nearly thirty figures, with 16 biblical characters in four lights, under angels giving praise, and at the top of the arch the Lamb at the centre of emblems of the Four Evangelists. Morris & Co. also supplied two smaller windows by Burne- Jones on the subjects of Faith and Music, and a window by Rossetti on Charity (or Caritas), which was installed in 1868. A window by Daniel Cottier on the subject of Hope with her Anchor was added by Cottier in 1884 in \\"memory of his grandfather Archibald M'Lean master mariner of this port.\\" Other windows in the church were provided by Ballantine & Co., of Edinburgh.

Caird & Company took over two shipyard berths close to the church in 1871, and photographs show ships under construction looming high above the kirk.Cairds, Inverclyde Shipbuilding & Engineering, shows a ship being built close to the Schaw Aisle (east wing), see also photo in In 1917 Caird & Co. were taken over by Harland and Wolff, which proposed huge expansion of the shipyard, taking over several properties including the original harbour, the kirk and the kirkyard. They offered generous compensation, including a new site about further west along the coast at the east end of Greenock's Esplanade, and agreed to have the kirk carefully taken down and re-erected. This was done under the supervision of the architect James Miller. A new tower was built to Miller's design, and the church was reoriented, so that the Cartsburn Aisle and the main entrance, which had originally faced west, now faced north-east. The kirkyard had been in use as a cemetery from 1592 until it closed in 1857. Remains of the burials were re-interred in a mass grave in Greenock's central Cemetery, save for the grave of Mary Campbell (Highland Mary). The 1842 monument to her, designed by John Mossman, was moved from the old Kirkyard to Greenock Cemetery, and Mary's remains were re-interred under it on 13 November 1920 in a solemn ceremony. The Pirrie Hall to the south of the church Harland and Wolff's contribution was organised by Lord Pirrie, and included provision of a new church hall on the new site, which would take the congregation during the works. He died before this happened. Five days after the church was closed for work to start, the Pirrie Hall named after him opened on 19 February 1925 and provided a temporary place of worship giving churchgoers the opportunity to watch progress on the replacement. The stones of the old kirk were numbered, cleaned and moved to the new site at the Esplanade: there had been no decoration in the original Presbyterian church, but as well as mason's marks on the stones, there were hidden carvings of birds, fish and animals. Work on rebuilding began in March 1926, and finished in January 1928. The kirk continued in full use until 2011, when it was amalgamated with two other churches into the Lyle Kirk, Greenock, Church of Scotland.

Initially as a teacher preparatory college there was no formal mascot until the 1920s when the nickname the \\"peds\\" was used to refer to the pedagogues an informal reference to teachers. In the 1950s the mascot the Indians were adopted, but this was dropped in 1976 due to the fact that Native American groups saw this as not representative of their culture. During 1977 there was a competition to come up with a new mascot. During the same time then Mankato State University was transitioning to a new athletic conference, the North Central Conference. The winning suggestion was from Professor Roy Cook, a native of Minnesota, who suggested the Maverick. The Maverick is a wild powerful steer, unbranded and unyielding.

He authored numerous books and was known for his creation of security theory, a precursor to attachment theory. Blatz's theory posited that in infancy and early childhood, the child needs to create a secure base with its caregivers in order to gain the courage necessary to brave the insecurity implicit in exploring the world, and argued that a lack of psychological resilience and self-confidence in adulthood are born out of a failure to develop a secure base in childhood. Biography William Emet Blatz was born in Hamilton, Ontario on June 30, 1895 to German parents. His father, Leo Victor Blatz, had moved to Canada from Würzburg in 1868, while his mother, Victoria Mary Mesmer—a relation to Franz Mesmer, arrived from Mainz in 1870. They married in Hamilton, Ontario in 1871, and William Emet was the youngest of nine children in the family. Victoria was driven and intelligent, put an emphasis on academic endeavor and \\"assumed all her children would do well in school.\\" Blatz did do well in school, and received his BA in physiology in 1916 from the University of Toronto. He earned his MA the following year, then attempted to join the Canadian Armed Forces but was rejected due to his German lineage and instead returned to the University of Toronto to treat shell shocked veterans along with Dr. Edward A. Bott. After the war, he began studying medicine, and graduated in 1921 with a BM from the University of Toronto. He then received a scholarship at the University of Chicago, where he met his first wife Margery Rowland and received his Ph.D in psychology under the tutelage of Harvey A. Carr in 1924. While in Chicago, he designed an electrically-operated collapsible chair with which he attempted to measure human emotions. He would attach electrodes, connected to an electrocardiograph, to an unsuspecting volunteer and then seat them in the chair. In the course of a polite conversation, Blatz would press a button causing the chair to collapse and the volunteer would fall to the floor onto the base of their spine. The electrocardiograph then measured the volunteer's emotions through the change in heartbeat and other physical reactions. On several occasions, Blatz had been forced to flee the room when his subjects lost their tempers. Blatz was then recalled to the University of Toronto by Dr. Edward A. Bott and Dr. Clarence M. Hincks to head the university's Institute of Child Study, and became assistant professor of the university's psychology department. He also traveled throughout the United States, visiting nurseries, and became research director of the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene. In 1927, he was appointed consultant psychologist to the Toronto Juvenile Court. In 1935, he was appointed educational consultant to the Dionne quintuplets, and supervised their development until 1938. In 1941, he was in England with Clarence M. Hincks to survey the need for child welfare in war-time. As a result of a discussion with the British Ministry of Health, Blatz returned to England in 1942 with five staff psychologists to set up the Garrison Lane Nursery Training Centre in Birmingham, which served as a model nursery school for the training of day care workers. In 1946, he advised the Canadian Government to set standards and regulations for nurseries, and married his second wife, Annie Louisa Barnard Harris. In 1960, Blatz retired as director of the Institute of Child Study and in 1963 retired as professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. In 1964, he completed a draft of Human Security: Some Reflections and on November 1, died in Toronto at the age of 69. He was survived by his wife, Annie, his daughter, Margery Elsie Blatz, and his grandchildren, Jeffrey and James. Works Blatz rejected Freudian theories of psychology; he asserted that \\"it is not necessary to postulate an unconscious.\\" During his academic career, he also stated that some children might be better educated by studying music rather than reading, writing and arithmetic and defended the practice of teaching children to believe in Santa Claus. Security theory Blatz postulated security as the primary goal of the human being, but conceptualized security not as safety—a static state that is subject to crisis and hence an insecure state—but as a dynamic state. Security was for him a state of mind, characterized by serenity, which grew out of trust in one's ability to deal with the future. He stated it was a state of mind that accompanies a willingness to accept the consequences of one's decisions, and argued that security was acquired through early experience. According to Blatz's security theory, children initially need to develop a feeling of complete trust in their caregivers—dependent security. This secure base gives them the courage to explore, take risks, learn and eventually develop trust in themselves—independent security. Thus, Blatz's security theory was aimed at emancipation and the development of responsibility; it emphasized the importance of gradually increasing the child's freedom to make decisions independently, to experience consequences—both successes and failures, and to acquire effective ways of coping with those consequences. Due to the general similarities between the theories in addition to Blatz's role as Mary Ainsworth's doctoral advisor, security theory can be seen as a precursor to attachment theory.

Susceptibility to these effects varies depending on the stability of one's beliefs. Those without a strong attitude on an issue, for instance, would more be more prone to survey response effects than those strongly for or against the issue.Zaller, J., & Feldman, S. (1992). A simple theory of survey response: Answering questions versus revealing preferences. American Journal of Political Science, 36(3), 579 These effects can be broadly grouped as consistency or contrast effects. Consistency effects are effects that lead to survey responses that agree, not to be confused with the identically-named term used to refer to the phenomenon in which respondents intentionally try to get their survey responses to agree one another. Contrast effects on the other hand, lead to opposing responses.Moy, P., Scheufele, D. A., Eveland, W. P. and McLeod, J. M. (2001), Support for the Death Penalty and Rehabilitation: Question Order or Communication Effect?1. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 31: 2230–2255. Common survey response effects *Endorsement effects occur when reference to a political figure or group changes how people respond to questions on a policy issue. *Race of interviewer effects occur when the race of an interview influences survey responses. *Reference group effects occur when respondents are asked about their affiliation with a particular group and thereafter report attitudes that comport with that group's ideals. For example, a Republican might respond with more conservative responsive if first asked about the which political party she identifies with. A similar phenomenon, stereotype threat, has been described by Claude Steele written about in an Malcolm Gladwell’s essay The Art of Failure.Gladwell, M. (2001). The Art of Failure. The New Yorker, 84-92. *Priming effects of the news occur when news coverage suggests that the public should use certain issues to gauge their evaluation of other issues, which might be assessed in survey questions. Priming is an extension of agenda setting, the process by which new organizations increase salience of particular ideas, making them more likely to be recalled later. These effects, are at play during campaigns when candidates reiterate several key ideas that represent them to the media, priming the electorate to readily recall those ideas over others when stepping into voting booth.Scheufele, D. A., & Tewksbury, D. (2007). Framing, agenda setting, and priming: The evolution of three media effects models. Journal of Communication, 57(1), 9-20. *Question order effects occur when the wording or ideas provoked by a survey question linger in the mind and affect the response to subsequent questions. For example, questions about personal finance status might affect the response of questions that evaluate incumbent politicians. *Affective priming occurs when respondents who are asked a question about attitude before being asked to provide arguments about a position provide more affective arguments, that is arguments relating to mood and feeling, than rational arguments. *Haptic metaphor effects occur when physical touch sensations affect responses in a survey or experiment. For example, reviewing job application materials on a heavier clipboard can cause job candidates to seem more important,Ackerman, Joshua M., Christopher C. Nocera, and John A. Bargh. \\"Incidental haptic sensations influence social judgments and decisions.\\" Science 328.5986 (2010): 1712-1715. and briefly holding a warm beverage before an interpersonal interaction can create the perception of others having a warmer personality than briefly holding a cold beverage before an interaction.Williams, Lawrence E., and John A. Bargh. \\"Experiencing physical warmth promotes interpersonal warmth.\\" Science 322.5901 (2008): 606-607. Significance In general, people answer survey questions with remarkable inconsistency, that is their responses are unstable. Response instability is when people are asked the same questions in repeated surveys and respond with conflicting answers. To explain this instability, John Zaller and Stanley Feldman argue that how people respond to surveys depends on which schemas, or considerations, are most readily available in the mind. They claim that an attitude about a given issue, at a given time, is a reflection of an average of the considerations in the mind at that time. To apply a metaphor, attitude is climate; considerations are weather features. And since the pool of considerations in one's mind is constantly changing, attitudes are largely unstable over time. Due to this instability, survey response effects can significantly influence the outcome of surveys and should be considered when using surveys to inform policy making. Contradictory theories of survey response instability Philip Converse has attributed survey response instability to respondents lacking meaningful beliefs,Philip E. Converse (2006) The nature of belief systems in mass publics (1964), Critical Review, 18:1-3, 1-74. while others have chalked it up to measurement errors and vague language in surveys.Achen, C.

From his perspective, \\"An artist can't do anything if he doesn't watch, observe, and participate in what's going on.\\" \\"My work is to record.\\"The artist cited in Charlotte Townsend-Gault's \\"The Salvation Art of Yuxweluptun,\\" page 12. Yuxweluptun also maintained a close relationship with Coast Salish cultural traditions. At fourteen he was given the right to dance with the X̱wáýx̱way mask and at seventeen was initiated as a Black Face dancer.Charlotte Townsend-Gault's \\"The Salvation Art of Yuxweluptun,\\" page 8. His name means \\"man of many masks\\" and was given to him in his adolescence by the Sxwaixwe Society. Yuxweluptun attended the Emily Carr College of Art and Design (now University) in the late 1970s and early 1980s and graduated in 1983 with an honours degree in painting.  Symbolism and technique  Yuxweluptun works primarily in painting but has also created multimedia and sculptural works. Many of his pieces show elements of Surrealism, including similarities to the melting objects in Salvador Dalí's paintings. His work incorporates traditional elements from Northwest First Nations art, as well as evocations of the Canadian landscape painting tradition, such as the Group of Seven. Environmental issues are often central themes in Yuxweluptun's work. His paintings have overtly political statements and titles, and often highlight land use and land ownership issues. Generally, Yuxweluptun's paintings are described as \\"provocative;\\" for example, his multimedia piece Residential School Dirty Laundry illustrates a cross made out of children's underwear with red paint to represent blood, and references the treatment of First Nations children in the Canadian Indian residential school system. Yuxweluptun is among the most overtly critical artists practicing in Canada today; he doesn't shy away from depicting the devastating realities that face many Native people and does so through a unique hybridization of Northwest Coast aesthetics—ovoids and stylized formlines—with the dream-like aesthetics of Surrealism. Yuxweluptun's wry appropriation of Surrealism is a reminder of the formative influence of Aboriginal artifacts, including Northwest coast masks, on this movement.See, for example, the Vancouver Art Gallery's exhibition The Colour of My Dreams: The Surrealist Revolution in Art (May 28 to October 2, 2011) which paired Northwest coast works with the Surrealist works they inspired. Many artists involved with Surrealism were avid collectors of so-called \\"primitive art,\\" believing that this work demonstrated a direct link to the unconscious real. He developed this signature style while a student at Emily Carr University. This “deliberate act of reciprocal appropriation”Townsend-Gault, “The Salvation Art of Yuxweluptun,” 15 broke with many conventions of Aboriginal art and was initially contentious among both Native and non-Native art communities.Townsend-Gault, “The Salvation Art of Yuxweluptun,” 12-13 Although the ovoid is used in Coast Salish art, formlines which are identifiably Haida and Kwakwaka'wakw also figure prominently in the artist's paintings and drawings. This perceived lack of authenticity with regards to his artistic and cultural heritage is of little concern to Yuxweluptun. In a recent telephone conversation he stated that painting in a more generic Northwest Coast style enables him to more accurately represent what he terms “the imaginary Indian” or “the symbolic Native.” The figures in his paintings then are not necessarily representations of real people—or specific Northwest coast beings or ceremonies—but instead comment on the way in which Native identity has been constructed from outside perspectives.This idea is well articulated in Marcia Crosby’s essay “The Construction of the Imaginary Indian,” originally published in Stan Douglas ed., The Vancouver Anthology (Vancouver: Or Gallery and Talon Books, 1991), 267-291. Perhaps the most important achievement of Yuxweluptun's paintings within the context of Canadian landscape painting is his introduction of the politicized landscape. The harsh “toxicological” realities shown in Yuxweluptun's paintings—forests ravaged by clear cuts, water filled with toxic pollution, the figures of bureaucracy (Native and non-Native alike), the abject poverty and abuse on Vancouver's downtown east side—are allegorical and rendered like stunning nightmares with smouldering technicolour palettes that are hard to overlook. As curator Scott Watson observes, his works invert the subservient role of Native arts and crafts within the development of Canadian Modernism.Here Watson cites the National Gallery of Canada’s 1927 exhibition Canadian West Coast Art: Native and Modern in stating that, “The exhibition argued that Canadian Modernism must appropriate the legacy of native art in order to have an authentic relation to the land.” Scott Watson, “The Modernist Past of Lawrence Paul Yuxweluptun’s Modernist Allegories,” in Born to Live and Die on Your Colonialist Reservations (Vancouver: Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, 1995), 62  Artwork  = Inherent Rights, Vision Rights = Inherent Rights, Vision Rights was one of the first Virtual Reality (VR) artworks ever made in Canada and was produced between 1991 and 1993 at the Banff Centre for the Arts for the Art and Virtual Environments Project. The work's components included Macintosh and PC computers, a sampler, spatialized sound, custom-made controls and stereoscopic display. It was also the first VR piece to be exhibited by the National Gallery of Canada. It was exhibited at the National Gallery of Canada in 1992 in the exhibition Land, Spirit, Power: First Nations at the National Gallery of Canada. / Terre, esprit, pouvoir. Les Premières Nations au Musée des beaux-arts du Canada (Fall,1992). Inherent Rights, Vision Rights pioneered new techniques for the exhibition of VR pieces by blending computer-generated 3D sound with figures derived from Yuxweluptun's paintings. The viewer does not wear a helmet to experience the work. Instead, the viewer enters a kiosk similar to an old-fashioned stereoscope, and experiences spatialized sound and computer graphics. The kiosk represents a Longhouse, described in a 1993 edition of Canadian Art as a \\"simulated cartoon longhouse inhabited by a variety of Yuxweluptun's typical animal spirits and ghosts.\\" = Haida Hot Dog = One of Yuxweluptun's earlier pieces, the 1984 work Haida Hot Dog, comments in pop-art style on the commodification of First Nations, and particularly Haida, artwork. = Scorched Earth, Clear-cut Logging on Native Sovereign Land = This piece, created in 1991, was among the first works acquired for the National Gallery of Canada's collection from the exhibition Land, Spirit, Power: First Nations at the National Gallery of Canada. This overtly political painting combines a broad range of influences drawn from the contemporary history of Indigenous peoples, Coast Salish cosmology, Northwest Coast formal design elements, and Western landscape traditions. Yuxweluptun wrote in 1992, \\"My work is very different from traditional art work. How do you paint a land claim? You can't carve a totem pole that has a beer bottle on it ... I paint this for what it is – a very toxic land base. This is what my ancestral motherland is becoming. Painting is a form of political activism, a way to exercise my inherent right, my right to authority, my freedom ... I can speak out in my paintings even without the recognition of self-government.\\"  Awards and honors  Yuxweluptun was the recipient of the Vancouver Institute for the Visual Arts (VIVA) award in 1998. In 2013, Yuxweluptun received a fellowship at the Eitelijorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art in Indianapolis.  Exhibitions  Yuxweluptun's work has been included in numerous international group and solo exhibitions, such as INDIGENA: Contemporary Native Perspectives in 1992 and 1993. INDIGENA was a major touring exhibition of Indigenous art curated by Gerald MacMaster and Lee-Ann Martin. Yuxweluptun was the only artist to be included in both INDIGENA and Land, Spirit, Power: First Nations at the National Gallery of Canada. These two exhibitions are now recognized as pivotal moments in the national recognition of Aboriginal art and which aided in introducing a new generation of Aboriginal artists to the fore. In 1993, the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery in Vancouver opened their new space with Yuxweluptun's work. This exhibition, Lawrence Paul Yuxweluptun: Born to Live and Die on Your Colonialist Reservations, remains the artist's first and only career survey to date and served to underscore the importance of his work within the Canadian landscape painting tradition for its role in actively challenging many of the genre's conventions. Yuxweluptun's work appeared in 75 Years of Collecting, the Vancouver Art Gallery's 75th anniversary commemorative exhibition. The exhibition took place throughout 2006 with a four-part series highlighting the history and diversity of the gallery's permanent collection of nearly 9,000 works. Western Front presented Lawrence Paul Yuxweluptun from March 7 to April 4, 2009. Curated by Candice Hopkins and Mark Soo, the exhibition consisted of a single painting, Guardian Spirits on the Land: Ceremony of Sovereignty (2000) alongside a selection of pulp science fiction novels. The exhibition was held in conjunction with a series of talks by writers that explore Yuxweluptun's work in relation to the genre of science fiction. Lawrence Paul Yuxweluptun: Neo-Native Drawings and Other Works appeared from March 19 to May 16, 2010 at the Contemporary Art Gallery in Vancouver. This exhibit featured three decades of drawings extending from 1980 to 2009 including works such as tree studies, ovoid portraits, figurative works, etchings, and sketchbooks. Many of the drawings were untitled. Shore, Forest and Beyond: Art From the Audain Collection, organized by the Vancouver Art Gallery and curated by Ian Thom and Grant Arnold, presented from October 29, 2011 to January 29, 2012. Shore, Forest and Beyond was an exhibition of 100 works gathered from the collection assembled by Michael Audain. Yuxweluptun's work was exhibited in Sakahàn: International Indigenous Art, the National Gallery of Canada’s special exhibition. It ran from May 17 to September 2, 2013 and was deemed the largest-ever global survey of contemporary Indigenous art in 2013. Unceded Territories, a solo exhibition, was co-curated by Karen Duffek, (MOA Curator, Contemporary Visual Arts & Pacific Northwest) and Tania Willard (artist and independent curator, Secwepemc Nation) at the Museum of Anthropology (MOA), University of British Columbia, in 2016. Other exhibitions include Colour Zone, Plug In ICA, Winnipeg, Manitoba, 2009; An Indian Act: Shooting the Indian Act, Locus+, Newcastle, UK, 1997; Inherent Rights, Vision Rights: Virtual Reality Paintings and Drawings, Canadian Embassy, Paris, 1993; True North: The Landscape Tradition in Contemporary Canadian Art, Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts, Taipei, Taiwan; New Territories: 350/500 Years After, Montreal, Quebec (touring); In the Shadow of the Sun, Canadian Museum of Civilization, Hull, Quebec, 1988; and The Warehouse Show, Vancouver, British Columbia, 1983.

Design Guillemin JG.10 with sport cockpit photo from NACA aircraft Circular No.153 The Guillemin JG.10 was a cantilever low wing monoplane with foldable wings and side-by-side seats in an open cockpit which could be rapidly transformed into an enclosed cabin. It was built at the Blériot factory and was often referred to as the Blériot-Guillemin JG.10. Beyond a metal framed centre- section the wings were all wood, built around twin box spars and plywood covered. They were trapezoidal in plan out to rounded tips, with long, narrow- chord ailerons each divided into two sections. The wings had about 3.5° of dihedral, partly achieved by airfoil section thinning outboard. The wing centre-section was widest from leading edge to around the forward spar, then angled inwards in plan until it almost reached the fuselage edge, following it to the trailing edge. The outer wings were folded in two stages, first rotating them around a pivot on the forward spar until the trailing edge was upright, then hinging the wings back along the side of the fuselage. The JG.10 was powered by a four-cylinder, upright, air-cooled inline Renault 4P engine, largely exposed, in the nose. Though a Salmson 7A radial engine of the same power was an alternative, there is no evidence that it was fitted. Behind the rubber-mounted engine frame, the fuselage had rectangular sections, widest in the cockpit area. It was built around a frame of square section tubes, with a light metal skin; the tubes had the same outer dimensions everywhere but their wall thicknesses increased where greater strength was required. The cockpit located the two seats over mid-chord. In sports mode the JG.10 was flown from an open cockpit with a triplex windscreen for each occupant but it could also be configured as a tourer by attaching a glazed and streamlined, rectangular section top. Access to the latter was from above. There were removable dual controls and each seat could be folded down to provide a clear surface for an air bed. Luggage could be stored behind the seats in a netted-off space. Each occupant was provided with a parachute stored in cockpit side-pockets and which exited through the sides, pulled by a static line attached to the wearer's harness. All the tail surfaces of the JG.10 were straight tapered with rounded tips and carried unbalanced control surfaces. The tailplane, which had a wooden structure and was ply covered, was built into the fuselage and strut-braced to the fin. The elevators were fabric covered. The high aspect ratio vertical tail comprised a fin, constructed like the tailplane and an all-metal rudder which ended above the elevators. The JG.10 had fixed, conventional landing gear, its mainwheels on bent axles with rearward drag struts, all hinged to the central fuselage underside. Vertical oleo struts from the ends of the axles were attached to the forward wing spars; the track was . A vertical tube extending from the extreme rear of the fuselage carried a small castering tailwheel below a shock-absorbing spring. The end of the extension was supported by a small V-strut to the lower fuselage. Development The first flight of the Guillemin JG.10 was on 1 June 1931. In August it was being developed at Villacoublay whilst also serving as Louis Blériot's transport in the neighbourhood of Paris. In October it took part in the Concours National d'Avions de Tourisme (National touring aircraft competition), which began at Orly in late September, but had to retire with fuel flow problems. The sole JG.10 remained active for six years. It was demonstrated at a civilian pilots' reunion festival at Orly in May 1932 and was back at Villacoublay (with the STIAé) in December, where it remained until at least May 1934. In August 1935 it was there once again, test-flying at the Centre d'Essais de Matériels Aériens, Villacoublay. It was destroyed in a fatal accident at Villacoublay on 16 June 1937; both crew died. The cause was inflight structural failure which was ascribed to weathering in an aircraft that had been housed for two years at Buc in a hangar partially open to the elements.

They came to prominence when weavers from Flanders settled in the area, having been displaced by what came to be known as 'the hundred years war'. Up to that time the English wool trade with the rest of Europe was mostly in the form of the export of raw wool. However, exports of woven cloth quickly replaced the export of raw wool (the latter being heavily taxed by Edward III to help finance the war) and those engaged in the trade began to amass great wealth.John H Munro ‘Medieval Woollens, Textiles. Textile Technology and Industrial Organisation. C800 -1500, in The Cambridge History of Western textiles Volume 1, ed. by D.T. Jenkins Cambridge, Cambridge University Press 2003) pp. 181-227 (at 181) This wealth in Suffolk wool towns is marked by the beauty of large churches known as wool churches built from the prosperity of the wool trade: Long Melford’s Holy Trinity “is one of the most moving parish churches in England, large, proud and noble”, “so many thin, wiry perpendiculars”.The Buildings of England, Suffolk: West, James Bettley & Nikolaus Pevsner, Yale 2015, , pp 381, 385 Lavenham’s St Peter & St Paul “is a match for Long Melford, “a perfect picture”.Ibid.

The Market Hall….the church…the Deanery Tower.”Ibid. Op.cit. p276 Several of the towns in East Anglia that were prosperous during the peak of the English wool trade have retained many of their medieval buildings: Clare “now an exceptionally attractive small town”,Ibid Op.cit. p188 Long Melford “a rich legacy” with “two fine Tudor mansions”;Ibid Op.cit. p311 Lavenham “rightly celebrated”,Ibid Op.cit. p350 “There is nothing in Suffolk to compete with the timber-framed houses of Lavenham”,Ibid Op.cit. p355 Hadleigh’s “High Street is remarkable for having retained nearly all of its oldest buildings unspoilt while remaining busy and commercial”.Ibid Op.cit. p279 The term has also been used to refer to other towns involved in the wool trade. The English Wool Market, c.1230–1327 includes York, Boston, Winchester and Hull in the group, and it has also been applied to towns in the Cotswolds and Yorkshire.

RhTx binds to the outer pore region of the temperature regulated TRPV1 ion channel, preferably in activated state, causing a downwards shift in the activation threshold temperature, which leads to the immediate onset of heat pain. Yang, S., Yang, F., Wei, N., Hong, J., Li, B., Luo, L., ... & Lai, R. (2015). A pain-inducing centipede toxin targets the heat activation machinery of nociceptor TRPV1. Nature Communications, 6. .  Sources  RhTx is a component of the venom of the S. subspinipes mutilans, also called the Chinese red-headed centipede.  Chemistry  RhTx is a small peptide toxin, with a compact 3D-structure. The gene encoding for RhTx translates into a 69 amino acid peptide that shows no homology to any known animal toxin. This peptide, after post- translational modifications, yields a mature toxin of 27 amino acids. RhTx has two pairs of disulfide bonds. While the N-terminus of the peptide contains no charged amino acids, the C-terminus of the peptide is rich in charged amino acids. In the folded peptide, these charged amino acids are all located on the same side of the peptide, making RhTx a polar molecule.  Target  RhTx binds to the outer pore region of the polymodal TRPV1 ion channel. The toxin preferably binds to TRPV1 in the activated state of the channel. RhTx has a high affinity for the TRPV1 ion channel, which results in very rapid binding and slow unbinding. The TRPV1 channel is a non-selective cation channel, with a high permeability to Ca2+.Caterina, M. J., & Julius, D. (2001). The vanilloid receptor: a molecular gateway to the pain pathway. Annual review of neuroscience, 24(1), 487-517. TRPV1 is mainly expressed in sensory neurons and can be activated by different stimuli, including high temperatures (heat), acids, pollutants with negative electric charge and endogenous metabolites such as anandamide.Cortright, D.

Mode of action  After binding to the outer pore region of the TRPV1, RhTx can interact with both the turret and the pore helix through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. RhTx binding is expected to induce conformational changes to the outer pore, which are thought to be the cause of the drop of the activation threshold for the TRPV1 channel. These changes strongly promote the opening of the TRPV1 channel at the normal body temperature of the organism, resulting in intense burning pain. It is hypothesized that RhTx binding might also interfere with ion permeation due to its interaction with the pore helix.  Toxicity  In mice, injections of RhTx induced pain behavior, which was distinct from pain behavior mediated by inflammation, but similar to the behavior elicited by capsaicin injection. Injections in mice also caused a rapid drop of core body temperature at normal conditions, by less than 1 degree Celsius. The EC50 in mice is estimated to be 500 nM. While the effect of isolated RhTx administration is not known in humans, bites of the S. subspinipes mutilans species generally cause immediate localized burning pain, followed by edema, erythema and other localized symptoms.Fenderson, J.

Some of Johnson's cartoons were also reprinted in volumes of Meatmen in the 1980s, as well as in historical overviews such as No Straight Lines published by Fantagraphics in 2012. Johnson also produced explicit erotic illustrations for sale. Cartoonist Donelan was inspired by Johnson's work to begin his series \\"It's a Gay Life\\", which appeared in The Advocate after \\"Miss Thing\\" and \\"Big Dick\\" ended. Howard Cruse cited Johnson's \\"brazenly gay\\" cartooning as an inspiration.

She is a friend and confidante of David (the narrator and protagonist of this semi-autobiography) since his childhood and at the end of the novel, his second wife. In Dickens' language, she is the \\"real heroine\\" of the novel. Role in the novel Agnes Wickfield is introduced in chapter 15 of the novel; when David, with his great-aunt Betsey Trotwood, goes to her father Mr. Wickfield's house in Canterbury, in search of a good school. Agnes, whose mother is dead, takes care of her alcoholic yet affectionate father and of the house, as the \\"little housekeeper\\". David takes residence in the house for his school-years. David and Agnes, being of same age; become friends very quickly. Throughout his boyhood, David, in many ways, becomes dependent on Agnes. Agnes becomes his friend and confidante, and David regards her as a sister. Though Agnes loves him, she never tells him, knowing he doesn't have the same feelings for her. After leaving the house when he passes school, David maintains close contact with Agnes. She warns him against his friend James Steerforth, as his \\"bad angel\\", which later proves true. Her father's villainous clerk, Uriah Heep, taking advantage of Mr. Wickfield's alcoholism and his affection for his daughter, becomes powerful. He becomes a partner in the law firm by devious means and wants Agnes's hand in marriage. Agnes, refusing, resists Heep throughout the years. Hiding her true feelings for David, she helps and advises him in his infatuation with and marriage to Dora Spenlow. Later, when Wilkins Micawber is recruited as a clerk by Heep, she urges him to gather evidence against Heep; this, ultimately, leads to Heep's downfall. After Dora's death, Agnes consoles and encourages David to return to his normal life and the profession of writing. While living in Switzerland, David realizes he loves Agnes. After returning to England he tries hard to conceal his feelings, but realizing Agnes loves him as well, he proposes to her; she accepts. They marry quickly and take residence in London. Agnes bears David at least five children. Character Analysis Like typical Dickensian heroines, Agnes is mainly a passive character, an ideal Victorian lady. Her characterization is often criticized as \\"too perfect\\". David often describes her as an angel. Recent researches have been more favorable to her. Cultural historian Peter Gay in an article titled \\"The Legless Angel of 'David Copperfield': There's More to Her Than Victorian Piety\\" stated that, she shows the effects of parentification. The death of her mother and alcoholism and weak-mindedness of her father makes her more matured for her age, along with gifts of intelligence and presence of mind. One significant feature of Agnes' character is her calm, quiet and tranquil nature. David's first impression about her is comparing her to a \\"stained glass window\\" of a church. David often compares Agnes with the tranquil brightness of the church-window. Agnes' character was based on Dickens' sisters-in-law Mary and Georgina Hogarth, both of whom were very close to Dickens. Mary died in 1837 at the age of 17, and Georgina, from 1842, lived with the Dickens family. Dickens referred to her affectionately as his \\"little housekeeper\\". After Dickens' separation from his wife Catherine, Georgina stayed with him for the rest of his life and took complete responsibility for managing his household.

She became a privateer in the Indian Ocean that the British captured in 1801 in a notable single-ship action and named HMS Trincomalee, but then sold in 1803. The French recaptured her in 1803 and recommissioned her as the privateer Émilien, but the British recaptured her in 1807 and recommissioned her as HMS Emilien, before selling her in 1808. Gloire Was a three-masted corvette-like ship built in Bayonne and commissioned in Bordeaux in 1799 under Captain Emit as an armed merchantman. After her arrival at Île de France (Mauritius) in May she was recommissioned as a privateer under Captain Étienne Bourgoin. Gloire sailed from Île de France on the evening of 25 August 1800, in company with the privateer Adèle. On 23 March 1801 , Captain William Waller captured Gloire, Étienne Bourgoin, master, at . Albatross had chased Gloire and had finally caught up with her around noon. After a close and severe action that lasted about 20 minutes Bourgoin struck. Gloire had lost five men killed and 12 wounded, Bourgoin and some of his officers being among the wounded; Albatross had no casualties. At the time of her capture Gloire was armed with 10 guns, though she was pierced for 18, and had a crew of 111 men. She had left Mauritius with 183 men, but had taken six prizes requiring prize crews; she had also sunk several other prizes that were not worth putting a prize crew aboard. After his capture Bourgoin stated that Gloire could have escaped, but that his men had insisted on fighting. He also reported that some time earlier he had encountered the British East India Company's 24-gun cruizer Mornington. She had chased Gloire for some three days, and Bourgoin praised Lieutenant Henry Frost, Morningtons captain, for his seamanship. Waller and Albatross had on 23 November 1800 captured Adèle. Shortly after Albatross arrived at Madras Roads, the New Madras Insurance Company presented Waller with an honour sword, and the Old Madras Insurance Company presented him with a piece of plate, each worth £200, as a reward for the service he had rendered by this capture and that of Gloire.\\"Chronicle for April 1801\\", Asiatic Annual Review, Vol. 3, pp.62-63.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, pp.328-9.

Commander Peter Heywood took command of Trincomalee in June. In December she was off Cheduba Island. Heywood noted that provisions could be gotten there at reasonable prices. Commander T. Pulham replaced Heywood. The Royal Navy sold Trincomalee in January 1802. Merchantman She became a merchantman, probably under her existing name. In late 1803 the French recaptured her and recommissioned her as the privateer Émilien. Émilien A notice in the Gazette de l'Isle de France on 9 July 1806 stated that Émilien would leave on a cruise in a few days. , Captain Christopher Cole, captured Émilien on 26 September 1806 after a chase that lasted two days and a night. He described her as a ship corvette of 18 guns and 150 men. When the British took possession of Emilien at 2a.m. on the 25th, close off the shoals of Point Guadaveri they found out that they had driven her ashore the night before. She had had to jettison 12 guns, her anchors, and her boats, to enable her to be refloated. Cole noted that Emilien was \\"formerly His Majesty's Sloop Trincomalee\\". He further noted that she was copper fastened, and that under the name of Gloire had \\"annoyed our Trade\\". However, on this cruise she was two months out of Île de France without having made any captures. HMS Emilien The Royal Navy took Émilien into service as HMS Emilien.

Her research focuses on philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, epistemology, and metaethics. She previously held positions at the University of Rochester and UNC-Chapel Hill, where she was the Zachary Smith Distinguished Term Professor of Research and Undergraduate Education from 2014-2015.  Education and career  Bar-On earned a BA (summa cum laude) at Tel Aviv University in Philosophy & Linguistics before earning her MA and PhD in Philosophy at UCLA. Her dissertation, Indeterminacy of Translation: Theory and Practice, was written under the supervision of Tyler Burge, Rogers Albritton, Keith Donnellan, David Kaplan, and David Pears. Bar-On has also written Hebrew translations of poetry, fiction, and philosophy, including three anthologies in modern philosophy, writings by Iris Murdoch, Kurt Vonnegut, Dos Passos, Dorothy Richardson, E. E. Cummings, Robert Louis Stevenson, Walter Scott, and, in collaboration with Marcia Falk, a collection of poems by Zelda Schneerson Mishkovsky and The Book of Blessings. Her other professional experience includes being a radio producer, editor and broadcaster for the Israel IDF radio station, a television writer and host in Israel, and a Hebrew television newscaster and interviewer for Channel 18 in Los Angeles. Bar-On also formerly served as the President of MYCO@UNC, a youth chamber organization, from 2009 to 2012.  Research  In Speaking My Mind: Expression and Self-Knowledge, published by Oxford University Press, Bar-On investigates the problem of self-knowledge (how, if at all, we are each in a privileged position to know own mental states) in relation to questions of expression and expressive behavior.Reviewed in She draws on historical figures including Wittgenstein and Darwin to develop a neo-expressivist view of first-personal expressive utterances (such as, \\"I am in pain\\") which explains how these utterances differ epistemically from non-expressive utterances while sharing the same semantic structure. Speaking My Mind has been praised as \\"a rich book; rich in topics, in argumentation, and in philosophical imagination and insight. It deserves the attention of all who work in mind and language.\\" In subsequent work, Bar-On has applied this neo- expressivist framework to additional problems in the philosophy of language, metaethics, and epistemology. More recently, Bar-On has sought to illuminate the nature of human communication by situating it in relation to animal expressive communication more broadly, and thereby to show how human linguistic meaning can be understood consistently with a naturalistic theory of the world.

No Wonder was originally built in 1877 as Wonder, which was dismantled in 1888, with components being shifted over to a new hull, which when launched in late 1889 was called No Wonder. No Wonder served almost entirely in the logging and towing trade until it was abandoned in 1930. No Wonder was sometimes referred to as the Wonder during its operational career. Construction No Wonder was built in East Portland, Oregon, in 1889, just above the landing of the Jefferson Street ferry. The original owner was the Willamette Steam Mills & Lumbering Company. Construction was supervised by Capt. Frank B. Turner (b.1859). David Stephenson (b.1835), a native of Saint John, New Brunswick, was the actual builder. =Design= No Wonder was built as a replacement boat by Captain Turner for the steamer Wonder. Wonder had been built in 1877 by George Washington Weidler (commonly known as “Old Man Weidler”) as the first log-towing steamer on the Willamette River. Components of Wonder were salvaged and installed on the new hull, which was named No Wonder. The new steamer was fitted with special equipment for handling log tows. =Nomenclature= The joke circulating about the old Wonder was that it had received that have because everyone was wondering where Captain Turner had obtained the money to build the boat. The name No Wonder was chosen apparently as a response. =Engineering= No Wonder was driven by a stern-wheel, which was turned by twin steam engines, horizontally mounted, each with bore of and stroke of , generating 17 nominal horsepower. No Wonder was equipped with steam steering gear, an invention which Captain Turner had patented in 1888. No Wonder was reported to be the best equipped logging towboat on the Columbia River. The boiler, as of 1910, was reported to carry 100 pounds of steam pressure. As built, No Wonder had a wood-fired boiler. No Wonder required a crew of 13 to run the boat. =Dimensions= No Wonder was over hull (exclusive of fantail), with a beam of over hull (exclusive of guards and depth of hold of . The overall size of the vessel was 269.66 gross tons and 235.30 registered tons. The official merchant vessel registry number was 130458. Operations under original owners In April 1890, one J. Ordway was reported to be the principal owner of No Wonder. Capt Frank Turner remained in charge of No Wonder until 1893, with W.H. Marshall (b.1853) as chief engineer. After 1893, and up to at least 1895, Capt. Charles Spinner (b.1849) was in command. =Logging work= In February 1890, a flood washed away 4,000,000 board feet of logs belong to the Willamette Steam Mills. About 3,000,000 board feet of these logs were recovered. In two days in late February, No Wonder, under Captain Turner, working as far downriver as Clifton, recovered 1,900 logs, paying one dollar apiece for them. On June 29, 1890, No Wonder, under Capt. James Whitcomb, master, departed up the Columbia River with a tow of logs from the Lewis and Clark River, comprising over one-half million board feet of lumber. =Mate injury= On February 20, 1890, the mate of No Wonder, Kane Olney, was seriously injured in a towing accident. The accident occurred on the Columbia River, about a mile upriver from Cathlamet, Washington. Captain Turner was in command at that time. The steamer was using its donkey steam engine to haul logs out of the water onto the bank. The mate was out of boat on the bank when one of the irons used to secure the pulling chain to the logs snapped loose from the log, striking the mate in the left temple, breaking his skull and exposing his brain. Olney was taken on board No Wonder, and the steamer proceeded downstream as fast as possible, reaching Astoria two hours later, where the mate was taken to the hospital. As of midnight, he was still alive, but it was reported that “two spoonfuls of the brain matter exuded” from his skull. Olney survived however, and lived to command other river steamers before his death in September 1936. =Complaint= On April 24, 1890, F.B. Jones, owner of the sternwheeler Maria, filed an affidavit with the U.S. Steamboat Inspector’s office, alleging that the day before, No Wonder, while towing logs on the Columbia River, had crowded the Maria, also towing logs, into a dangerous position from which it took three hours time to extricate the steamer. Operations with Shaver Transportation Company Wauna, No Wonder, Sarah Dixon, Henderson, and Cascades. In October 1897, No Wonder was sold to the Shaver Transportation Company. No Wonder had been lying idle since the Willamette Steam Mills had burned. Shaver Transportation intended for No Wonder to take the place of Sarah Dixon. Sarah Dixon had been built primarily for passenger work, but was being employed as a towboat by Shaver. With the acquisition of No Wonder, Shaver intended to return the Sarah Dixon to passenger work on the run from Portland to The Dalles, Oregon, but only after a haul-out and some extensive repairs. =Struck snag and sunk= On October 11, 1902, on the Cowlitz River, No Wonder ran upon a snag while towing a raft of cottonwood logs. This tore a hole in the hull about 6 to 8 inches wide and 6 to 8 feet long. The captain immediately cast off the tow, and headed to the opposite side of the Columbia River, where he beached the vessel at Rainier, Oregon. On the night of Saturday, October 11, 1902, Captain Shaver departed Portland on the Sarah Dixon to investigate the damage. He was expected to return on Sunday, gather up a salvage crew and equipment, and return on the Dixon that Monday. =Collision with T.J. Potter= On the afternoon of Tuesday, January 26, 1909, No Wonder sank as a result of a collision with the large side-wheel steamer T.J. Potter. The incident occurred near the mouth of the Willamette River, near Gillihan, in a thick fog. Running under Capt. Fred Stimson, No Wonder was towing a raft of boom logs, and, upon approaching the Potter, gave two blasts of the steam whistle. Stimson heard no reply from the Potter. The two steamers collided, and the hull of No Wonder, which sustained heavy damage in the forward part, began to fill with water. Captain Stimson immediately headed No Wonder in towards the river bank, where he grounded the vessel, after which the crew of 13 escaped unharmed. The after part of No Wonder sank below the surface of the water. The collision was investigated on February 1, 1909 by the U.S. Steamboat Inspection Service. There was no damage to the T.J. Potter. Damage to No Wonder was estimated at $300. As a result of the investigation, the license of Harry Haslam, acting pilot on the Potter, was suspended for 30 days. Captain Stimson, of No Wonder, was exonerated. =Reconstruction= In October 1910, the boiler of the Dixon, which generated steam at 160 pounds pressure (or 200 pounds according to another source) was installed into No Wonder, replacing the old boiler, which produced only 100 pounds of steam pressure. (The Dixon received a new boiler.) At the same time, the hull of the No Wonder was substantially rebuilt from amidships back to the stern, where new cylinder timbers were installed. The stern-wheel had to be lifted out of place for this work to be done. On the morning of December 10, 1910, No Wonder was back in the water following reconstruction. That day, crewmen heard the cries of an inebriated man, who had fallen off the dock at the foot of Everett Street into the Willamette River. Frank Watts and Burle Campbell launched a rowboat from No Wonder, and found Norman clinging to a piling, where they were able to rescue him. =Grounding in the Columbia Gorge= On Wednesday, October 25, 1911, No Wonder went aground on the middle Columbia river at Prindle’s Landing, near Cape Horn, where the steamer had stopped to pick up a log tow. The Shaver stern-wheeler Wauna was initially sent to the scene to assist No Wonder, and later, on Saturday, October 28, Capt. “Dell” Shaver went himself with Sarah Dixon to assist Wauna. The wind was blowing hard from the east, which seemed to be pushing the water away from the area where No Wonder was stranded, making it harder to refloat the vessel. A report was that the east wind was blowing so hard that it was almost impossible to stand on the forward deck of Wauna approaching Cape Horn. Wauna was able to extricate No Wonder that Saturday night, by backing towards the stranded boat, while spinning the stern-wheel at full speed, and thereby making a channel deep enough for No Wonder to pass through. Later years From September 1916 to April 1917, No Wonder was out of service (except for two days) due to a decline in the need for transport of logs. =Charter to Hosfords= In 1917, the Hosford Transportation Company needed another steamer to handle a surfeit of logs, so they chartered No Wonder from Shaver Transportation. In early November 1917 the Hosfords returned No Wonder to Shaver Transportation. =Loss of a watchman= Watchman D.W. Fairclaugh went missing from No Wonder in on the night of Tuesday, December 7, 1920. The steamer was then in the vicinity of St. Helens, Oregon. Fairclaugh had been feeling ill, and been placed in his bunk by the crew. The next morning his bunk was empty and he was not found on the boat. The surmise was that he had fallen overboard during the night and drowned. Fairclaugh was 55 years old and a resident of Portland, Oregon. On the afternoon of December 18, 1920, a body was found by the Coast Guard crew on the sand spit near Fort Canby. The body was believed to be that of Fairclaugh. Disposition No Wonder was abandoned, either in 1930 or 1933.

The park has a little over twenty acres of trees, meadows, a playground, and spring-fed stream. The park also has a 1500 square foot covered picnic pavilion with a full kitchen and restroom facilities, and is used to host family events and corporate functions. The main features of the park include playground equipment, soccer fields, sand volleyball, horseshoe pits, and a 3/4 mile walking or running trail. History The park itself shares history that can be traced back to Morgan's Spring. The park goes back to July 16, 1775 when Captain Hugh Stephenson and his company began the famous \\"Bee Line March to Cambridge.\\" This march lasted for roughly 24 days to meet up with George Washington's Continental Army that was roughly 600 miles away in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Morgan's Grove Park was the starting point of the historic journey, is currently listed in the National Register of Historic Places, and in 1989 was officially designated by the Secretary of the Army as the birthplace of the United States Army. The picture of the Springhouse is the only remaining structure of Fountain Rock. This is not by coincidence; the Springhouse is the last remaining artifact of Alexander Boteler's family mansion, which was destroyed in 1864 by Union forces. Boteler was elected to the Confederate Congress and served as an aide to General Stonewall Jackson.

Etchplanation is the process forming etchplains. Contrary to what the name might suggest, etchplains are seldom completely flat and usually display some relief, as weathering of the bedrock does not advance uniformly. This means that weathering is unrelated to the flatness which might be derivative of various other processes of planation including peneplanation and pediplanation. Erosion of etchplains can result in the exposure of inselbergs such as bornhardt and tors. Generally the topography exposed at a stripped etchplain, that is an etch surface, after erosion of regolith is one with many irregularities as result of structurally defined areas of rock strength. A distinction can be made between etchplains and etch surfaces as the later may or may not be flat and can represent the landform arising from the stripping of an etchplain. As climate changes arid and semi-arid periods of pediplanation may alternate with more humid periods of etchplanation resulting in the formation of flattish surfaces (peneplains) of mixed origin (polygenetic). During wet seasons deep weathering is more pronounced producing regolith which is then stripped away by erosion during subsequent dry seasons.Inselberg Formation Theories, The Geo Room The rate of stripping must exceed that of regolith production by deep weathering otherwise deep-seated basal surfaces are not revealed to the surface. The African Surface formed 70–40 million years ago is an example of an etchplain. History of the concept The term 'etchplain' or 'etched peneplain' was originally coined to describe surfaces in East Africa by E.J. Wayland in 1933 and Bailey Willis in 1936. This last geologist applied the term etched peneplain to the Tanganyika Plateau. Julius Büdel developed the concept further in the second half of the 20th century, but never did use the term 'etchplain'.

The fungus is symbiotic with the ryegrass; it doesn't harm the plant, and the toxins it produces kill insects that feed on ryegrass. Lolitrem B is one of these toxins, but it is also harmful to mammals. The shoots and flowers of infected ryegrass have especially high concentrations of lolitrem B, and when livestock eat too much of them, they get perennial ryegrass staggers. At low doses the animals have tremors, and at higher doses they stagger, and at higher yet doses the animals become paralyzed and die. The blood pressure of the animals also goes up. The effect of the lolitrem B comes on slowly and fades out slowly, as it is stored in fat after the ryegrass is eaten. The condition is especially common in New Zealand and Australia, and plant breeders there have been trying to develop strains of fungus that produce toxins only harmful to pests, and not to mammals. Lolitrem B affects a kind of ion channel called BK channels. These channels normally open temporarily to allow neurons and other electrically- sensitive cells, like some heart cells, to \\"reset\\" after they fire; lolitrem B blocks them, preventing the neuron or heart cell from firing again. This affects nerve and heart function. The channel is also involved in blood vessel relaxation, and blocking the channel causes blood vessels to constrict, raising blood pressure.  Etymology  The Lolitrem B toxin derives the first part of its name ('Loli') from the source of the fungus (perennial ryegrass, also known as Lolium perenne), the middle part ('trem') due to the tremors the toxin is known to cause, and the last part of its name ('B') as part of a way to distinguish between different Lolitrems, based on their difference in chemical structure (see 'Chemistry').  Sources  Lolitrem B is found in perennial ryegrass that has been infected with the fungus Epichloë festucae (var. lolii).Note: This fungus was formerly called Neotyphodium lolii. See This fungus is an endophyte; for part of its lifecycle it lives inside plants, growing between the plant cells; it is most prevalent in the ryegrass stem. The fungus produces lolitrem B, one of several mycotoxins that kill pests but which also can be neurotoxins for mammals.  Toxicity  When animals eat ryegrass stems infected with Epichloë festucae (var. lolii) they get a condition called perennial ryegrass staggers; in cases of mild poisoning the animals get tremors, and in severe poisoning they stagger and collapse. In horses, tremors of the eyeball muscles are seen which are more severe during eating and exercise. Lolitrem B can also increase the heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate and disrupt the digestion process. Lolitrems distinguish themselves among tremorgenic neurotoxins because they induce a long lasting effect on motor function and heart rate. The tremors can last for hours and at high concentrations they can cause death. In animals, lolitrem B more often causes death related to unfortunate accidents such as falling in a pond. The neurotoxic effects can be completely reversed. The threshold for toxicity varies between species of animals: for sheep a threshold value of 1.8 - 2.0 mg/kg was found, and for cattle 1.55 mg/kg. Measuring the lolitrem B concentration in fat tissue can be used to estimate the amount of lolitrem B consumed, and is used to determine the cause of death for cattle that presenting with neurological symptoms. Lolitrem B likely acts synergistically with ergotamine to increase smooth muscle contraction. Epidemiology Epichloë festucae (var. lolii) infects ryegrass worldwide, but cases of perennial ryegrass staggers are rare outside of Australia and New Zealand; the reasons for this are unclear but may have to do with the purposeful selection of endophyte-infected ryegrass by plant breeders, who prize its resistance to pests which are more prevalent in Australia and New Zealand than elsewhere, and the practice of monoculture by farmers in those countries.  Prevention  Plant breeders have been working with mycologists in Australia and New Zealand to develop strains of fungus that produce mycotoxins that are toxic to pests but not to mammals. Until those become commercially established the best prevention is avoiding grazing livestock on ryegrass when the stems are emerging and while the plant is flowering (concentrations are highest in the mature inflorescence and in the base of the plant), and avoiding overgrazing; once the exposure to lolitrem B ends the symptoms gradually decrease. Pharmacology Lolitrem B is rapidly eliminated from serum and has a half- life of 14 minutes. Lolitrem B is not very soluble, and is generally stored in fat after ingestion and slowly released; this is likely why its effects come on slowly and linger after ingestion has stopped. The more that is ingested, the more is stored in fat. Lolitrem B targets the large conductance calcium- activated potassium channels (BK channels) and in particular the α subunit (hSlo) of the BK channels. These channels open temporarily to allow neurons to \\"reset\\" after they fire; lolitrem B blocks them, preventing the neuron from firing again after it depolarizes, which at low doses leads to tremors and at high doses to paralysis and death. The binding site of lolitrem B is likely to be located in this α subunit. When lolitrem B is added, the potassium current quickly gets abolished and this inhibition cannot be reversed by washout (this reversal is possible for paxilline). However, over time lolitrem B slowly dissociates from the binding site. The inhibition by lolitrem B is calcium concentration-dependent. The concentration with half of the maximal inhibition (IC50) for hSlo was found to be 3.7 ± 0.4 nM. Lolitrem B is a more potent neurotoxin in vitro compared to paxilline. Lolitrem B preferably blocks the open configuration of BK channels, as under high calcium concentrations promoting the opening of BK channels, the apparent affinity increases three- fold. The inhibition by lolitrem B and its affinity differs with the calcium concentration. Lolitrem B has the highest affinity for BK channels when there is a high probability of an open conformation thus when the calcium binds to the high affinity sites. The inhibition occurs when the channels are in an open state. BK channels oppose vasoconstriction in blood vessels resulting in vasorelaxation. Blocking the channels leads to vasoconstriction and to an increase in blood pressure. The BK channel α subunit is expressed in muscle and nerve tissue and the BK channels are abundant in the brain. The BK channels modulate neurotransmitter release, the form of the action potential and repetitive firing. Inhibition of the channels can explain why there would be an increased release in excitatory neurotransmitters resulting in tremors, ataxia, hypersensitivity, increased smooth muscle contraction in the colon and an increased heart rate.  Chemistry  Lolitrem B is the most potent member of the lolitrem family. It possesses an indole-diterpene unit as well as a reactive epoxide group. It structurally looks like paxilline which is a related tremor inducer. There are multiple lolitrems which are labelled by a letter. The difference between them is the position and number of aryl and hydroxyl substituents plus the absence or presence of an I ring. The I ring seems to be necessary for prolonged tremors to occur. Intermediate metabolites such as terpendoles and paspaline can become lolitrems by addition of two rings (A and B) at the C20-C21 position to the indole moiety of the molecule. Biosynthesis The production of lolitrem B requires 10 different genes on a locus (the LTM locus) which is organized in three clusters. These clusters are separated by large AT-rich sequences. Cluster 1 contains the genes ltmG, ltmK and ltmM. Cluster 2 contains ltmP, ltmF, ltmB, ltmQ and ltmC and cluster 3 ltmE and ltmJ Four genes from cluster 2 are orthologues of functional characterized paxilline genes, meaning that the genes show homologous sequences. The genes in cluster 3 appear to be unique to the Epichloë genus.

Great Square) is a public square located in the Indre By neighborhood in Aarhus, Denmark. It is situated between Lille Torv and Aarhus Cathedral, shaped as an elongated triangle. It is the largest public square in Aarhus and one of the oldest venues for markets in the city. The square is home to many notable buildings including the dominating cathedral and is frequently host to cultural events. Store Torv is part of the pedestrian zone in the inner city and connects directly to the squares of Lille Torv, Skt. Clemens Torv, Bispetorv and Domkirketorvet.  History  The central parts of the square with the historic pharmacy of Løveapoteket Store Torv emerged in about year 1200 in connection with the construction of the cathedral. In the first centuries the street was known as Torvegaden (The Square-street) and functioned as a connection between Immervad and the cathedral through Lille Torv. At the time Lille Torv was called Torvet (The Square) and later Gammeltorv (Old Square) and functioned as the center of the town. The square evolved with the city and it was originally formed very differently. The city gate Borgporten (Castle Gate) separated Store Torv from Lille Torv. The gate had a medieval tower and was used by the watchmen of the city at night. In 1685, the gate was torn down because it was an obstacle to traffic, thus removing the barrier between the two squares. In medieval times, Storv Torv was home to both the cathedral of the Diocese of Aarhus and the City Hall of Aarhus. The square was used for markets, public punishments and official celebrations. Punishments involved whipping or the stocks, but also executions by hanging. The location was convenient due to its proximity to the jailhouse beneath the city hall. In about 1600, executions were relocated to Galgebakken (Gallows-hill) outside the town. The most common use for the square was markets. After the Danish king established rules for when and how markets could be held, it became one of the largest in the town. The market was primarily for vegetables, fruit, horses and cattle. Store Torv was also used for official celebrations such as the king's birthday or New Year's Eve.  Notable buildings  Store Torv is dominated by Aarhus Cathedral from around 1300. The Hotel Royal from 1838 is one of the oldest and most storied hotels in the town. The pharmacy Løveapoteket has been situated at its present location since 1710. Store Torv was previously home to the city hall.

It was the worst attack suffered by the British security forces during The Troubles from 1969 to 1998 on mainland Europe. Background 1988 was one of the worst years of the Troubles conflict in terms of violence during the 1980s. It saw an increase in IRA activity, a new campaign of sectarian killings by loyalist paramilitaries, and a heavy response by the British Army to IRA attacks. On 6 March the SAS shot dead 3 IRA members in Gibraltar. On 16 March at the funerals of the IRA volunteers shot in Gibraltar, a loyalist UDA volunteer killed an IRA member, Kevin Brady, as well as 2 civilians and injured dozens of other people in a grenade and gun attack at Milltown cemetery in Belfast. At Brady's funeral, two plain clothed, off-duty, British Army corporals were cornered by an angry crowd who assumed they were under attack and the IRA killed both of them. In May, the UVF killed 3 Catholic civilians and injured 9 in a gun attack in a Belfast pub. On 15 June, 7 people were killed, first 6 British soldiers were killed in the Lisburn van bombing and then the IRA shot dead a UVF member. On 7 July, an IRA member and 2 civilians were killed in a premature bomb explosion. Later that month on 23 July the IRA killed a family of three in a botched operation in Armagh. On 20 August the IRA killed 8 British soldiers and injured a further 28 in the Ballygawley bus bombing, this was the worst attack suffered from the British army since 1982. Ten days later on 30 August the SAS shot dead 3 more IRA Volunteers at Drumnakilly. One day later 3 civilians were killed when somebody triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb by mistake. Twenty-nine people were killed in the month of August alone. 104 people died in 1988 compared to 61 in 1986 and 57 in 1985. It was the worst year since 1982 when 110 people were killed. = Previous attacks in mainland Europe = The IRA and other Republican paramilitaries such as the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) had been carrying out attacks against British military personnel and British diplomats on mainland Europe since the mid 1970s. Prominent attacks included: *January 1973: A car bomb exploded in the Globe cinema carpark of JHQ Rheindahlen. The bomb was timed to go off when British military personnel were leaving the carpark.

The attacks The first attack of 1 May 1988 took place in the market of Roermond city, a popular social centre for British military personnel in the southeastern part of the Netherlands on the West German border. Two enlisted Royal Air Force members from the RAF Regiment based at RAF Wildenrath in Germany were sitting in a parked car near their base at around 01:00 am when IRA members fired shots from an automatic rifle into their car, killing one of the airmen (SAC Ian Shinner, 20) and badly injuring his companion. Police on the scene said that at least 23 bullets were fired into the vehicle. Half an hour later in Nieuw-Bergen, about 30 miles north of Roermond, a booby-trap bomb that was placed under the car of four other RAF airmen exploded while they were parked outside a discotheque. The bombing killed two more RAF airmen (John Miller Reid and John Baxter) and injured two others. \\"The bodies were in such a condition that they could not immediately be identified,\\" police spokesman Louis Steens told The Associated Press in Nieuw Bergen. The airmen were based at RAF Laarbruch, about 3 miles away across the border in West Germany. The IRA were able to identify the British military personnel due to the number plates on the cars. In both attacks, the cars being driven by the RAF members had British military licence plates. The IRA issued a statement from Belfast in relation to the attacks saying: \\"We have a simple message for [Prime Minister Margaret] Thatcher. Disengage from Ireland and there will be peace. If not, there will be no haven for your military personnel and you will regularly be at airports awaiting your dead.\\" Both the British and Irish governments condemned the attacks. Many Irish Republicans saw the attacks as revenge for the killings of the three IRA volunteers in Gibraltar two months before (see Operation Flavius). In 1990, two Australian tourists were shot dead by the IRA in Roermond.

It is based on a fairy tale by Czech writer Jan Drda. The film was shot in castles in Bohemia and Moravia. It has been screened at film festivals and is considered a classic by the Czech national broadcaster TV Nova. Plot The beautiful Princess Jasněnka runs afoul of a powerful evil witch. Her father, the king, imprisons her in a tower. Jíra, a shoemaker, designs leather wings that allow him to fly, and comes across the tower where Jasněnka is trapped. The two fall in love, and Jíra returns to the tower to take Jasněnka away, to the horror of the castle staff who believe Jíra is Lucifer. Jasněnka and Jíra marry, but her two enemy witches are determined to shatter their happiness. They force Jasněnka to make a mess in the couple's kitchen, expecting Jíra will beat her, but when he arrives he finds it funny. The witches also concoct a potion to erase memory that Jíra falls victim to, but he succeeds in remembering his identity.

Director Zdeněk Troška made several fairy tale films, often following patterns where a young man ventures from a rural area to find love and defeat corrupt enemies. His other films in this vein include The Loveliest Riddle, Princess from the Mill and its sequel. For Princess Jasnenka and the Flying Shoemaker, Troška and screenwriter Karel Steigerwald adapted a fairy story by Czech writer and Communist Party member Jan Drda. It was produced by Barrandov Studios, based in Prague. Some of the film was shot in the castles Bouzov and Vítkovec, the latter of which is close to Holany. For the scene where Jira rescues Jasnenka from the tower, an explosion and fire occurred during filming, frightening the lead actors. Troška noted Michaela Kuklová, who was 17 at the time, wept in fear. Jira's wings were based on a 15th-century drawing by artist Leonardo da Vinci. Release The film was released in theatres in Czechoslovakia on 1 December 1987. Its English language titles include Princess Jasnenka and the Flying Shoemaker, and Princess Jasna and the Flying Cobbler. In September 2002, it was screened in a series called the Week of Czech and Slovak Films in Pretoria, South Africa.Report on the Foreign Policy of the Czech Republic, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, Prague 2003, p. 211.

He entered the Franciscan seminary in 1938 while remaining there until 1948 when the Communist regime of Enver Hoxha closed the college in a wave of anti- religious sentiment and persecution. He was ordained to the priesthood on 7 April 1956. On 24 December 1963 he was imprisoned by the Communist authorities because he celebrated a Mass in memory of assassinated President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was converted into a prison term and he spent 28 years at penal labour, first in a mine and then in a sewage canal. He celebrated Mass using smuggled bread and grapes. By the late 1990s, he exercised his ministry in several Albanian villages. On 21 September 2014 he met Pope Francis during his apostolic visit to Albania and provided the pope with his own testimony on his experiences under the Communist regime.

She served as Ober-Hofmeisterin (Mistress of the Robes) to empress Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse) from 1894 until 1910. Life She was the daughter of general lieutenant Michail Vasiljevitj Pashkov and Maria Baranova Trofimovna. In 1857, she married prince Vladimir Dmitrievich Golitsyn (1815-1888). She had one child, Maria Vladimirovna Golitsyna (1860-1933), who at one point served as maid of honour. Golitzyna was made a dame of the Order of Saint Catherine in 1879. She served as deputy chair of the prestigious Patriotic Society (Russia) in 1896-1910. Maria Golitzyna is described by contemporaries as an imposing character and as an extreme reactionary conservative, opponent to all forms of liberal reforms of the autocratic monarchy.Е. А. Нарышкина. Мои воспоминания. Под властью трех царей. — М.: Новое литературное обозрение, 2014. — 688 с. In 1894 she was appointed to the post of senior lady-in-waiting to the new empress, with the responsibility of all the female employees of the empress' court, which had been selected by the dowager empress Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark). According to general A. A. Mosolov, no one was better suited to supervise the ladies-in-waiting: \\"it would be hard to find a lady better suited than the princess Golitsyna to personify the high rank of mistress of the robes... She had a well developed feeling for anything not belonging to etiquette.\\"А. А. Мосолов. При дворе последнего императора.— СПб., 1992.— С. 200.

She was a grande dame of the old school, and even her outward appearance was typical of a bygone age. [...] Princess Galitzin, notwithstanding her overawing manner - she struck terror into the hearts of all the debutantes, at whom she glared through her horn glasses-was kind and straightforward. She was courteous in spite of her brusque manner, but was no diplomat and could not do much to help the young Empress, to whom she became deeply attached. Although the Empress was rather afraid of her to begin with, she afterwards loved her dearly. When Princess Galitzin died in 1910 the Empress felt her loss greatly, and said to Princess E. N. Obolensky : \\"J'ai perdu la plus grande amie que famis en Russie.

Etymology Rose is named after Field marshal Hugh Rose. History The lighthouse is situated on a hillock. There are 70 masonry steps to reach the tower. The Lighthouse is an unattended station. A rainwater tank and a restroom have been provided for the maintenance staff. A third order revolving optic, on a mercury trough with DA (dissolved acetylene) gas burner and gas motor to revolve the optic, all supplied by M/s BBT, Paris were installed inside the lantern house over the CI tower . The light was commissioned on 14 April 1969. Due to frequent failures of the rotation system, the revolving optic assembly was removed and a cut-and-polished drum optic was placed in position in 1978. The DA gas burner was replaced by a DA gas flasher with a sun valve. This reduced the consumption of DA gas but the intensity of the light went down. With the shortage in the supply of DA gas, it became essential to change over to solar energy. Accordingly, the light source was replaced by 12V 100W Halogen lamp inside the same optic and on the same pedestal. The system became operational on 18 October 1993.

Life Heinrich Brockhaus was born into a protestant family in Amsterdam, a principal commercial centre in the Batavian Republic (today the Netherlands) where his father had set up his business in 1802 after falling out with a business partner in the family's former home city, Dortmund. Heinrich's father was the German publisher Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus (1772-1823). His mother, born Sophie Wilhelmine Arnoldine Beurhaus, was the daughter of a Dortmund senator (leading politician), Johann Friedrich Beurhaus. Heinrich and his younger brother, Hermann Brockhaus (1806-1877) were pupils at the prestigious boys' school run by Carl Lang at Schloss Wackerbarth (Wackerbath castle/manor). Heinrich never received any higher education. Nevertheless, he displayed very early an uncommon interest in literature and oratory. At the age of fifteen he was already working in his father's publishing business. He was not yet twenty when his father died suddenly, and he found himself responsible for running his father's business, which by now had become established in Leipzig. Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus (1772-1823), in his will, had given effect to a determination that the business should be run for the benefit of all his heirs, and Heinrich ran it, initially, with his elder brother, Friedrich Brockhaus (1800-1865). Later on the brothers agreed that Heinrich should run the business on his own: Friedrich retired from it and moved away to Dresden. Under Heinrich's direction, the business flourished. In 1831 he purchased the publishing house J.F. Gledisch, a firm which could trace its origins back to the seventeenth century. In 1837 he launched the \\"Leipziger Allgemeine Zeitung\\" (subsequently expanded and later relaunched as the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung), a newspaper which under his proprietorship had a reputation as a middle-class liberal publication. A notable autodidact, Brockhaus traveled widely across Europe, also visiting the near-east and North Africa and always, when travelling, on the look-out for new business opportunities. In the words of one source, he was able to understand seven modern languages, and was at home with literature and the fine arts. The publishing house also expanded internationally, with subsidiaries in Paris, Vienna and beyond. He also took a close interest in authors' rights, a subject in which his involvement continued when he entered into the world of politics. For many years Brockhaus sat as a member of the Leipzig city parliament. He was also a member of the regional parliament (Landtag) for Saxony in the 1840s. In 1848 he was a member of the Frankfurt \\"pre-parliament\\" (\\"Vorparlament \\") which planned the elections to the Frankfurt Parliament. A decade later he was a co-founder of the German National Association (\\"Deutscher Nationalverein\\"). Personal Heinrich Brockhaus married Pauline Campe (1808–86) in Leipzig in 1827. Their five recorded children included Eduard Brockhaus and Rudolf Brockhaus, who between them took over the publishing house after their father's death, and Helene who in 1855 married , another publisher. Wagner connections In 1828 his elder brother, Friedrich Brockhaus married Luise Wagner (1805-1872). His younger brother, Hermann Brockhaus, married Ottilie Wagner (1811-1883) in 1836. The second of these marriages placed Heinrich Brockhaus in the unique and sometimes uncomfortable position of being the brother-in-law to the impecunious composer, Richard Wagner twice over.

Her research focuses on epistemology, philosophy of mind, and metacognition. She has also written on 17th century (Western) philosophy, especially John Locke and René Descartes.  Education and career  After a B.A. in Philosophy at the University of Toronto, Nagel earned her M.A. (1994) and Ph.D. (2000) in Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh. Her dissertation, The Role of Necessity in Empirical Knowledge, was written under the supervision of John McDowell. In September 2015, Nagel founded a group called Room for More, a Toronto-based group sponsoring Syrian Refugees coming to Canada, in partnership with Humanity First. Nagel was President of the Central Division of the American Philosophical Association in 2018-19.https://individual.utoronto.ca/jnagel/CV.html  Philosophical work  Much of Nagel's research draws on empirical developments from the cognitive sciences and experimental philosophy in order to address longstanding questions in epistemology and philosophy of mind. For example, Nagel is well- known for defending the value of intuitions in philosophical methodology. While the emergence of experimental philosophy in the 21st century has often cast doubt on the reliability of intuitions, Nagel argues that intuitions about particular cases and thought experiments are a legitimate source of knowledge and justification. Nagel also argues, building on suggestions made by Timothy Williamson, that knowledge is a mental state. Whereas knowledge is traditionally thought to be reducible to a form of belief, i.e., a justified and true belief, Nagel argues that knowledge should itself be counted among the fundamental types of mental state, on a par with beliefs, desires, intentions, and so on. Nagel is the author of Knowledge: A Very Short Introduction, which has been praised as an \\"admirably clear and engaging\\" introduction to epistemology. Nagel considers classic questions, including about skepticism, rationalism, and empiricism, as well as more contemporary concerns, such as whether Wikipedia, \\"where most articles have multiple and anonymous authors\\", can be a reliable source of knowledge.

She has been called the Céline Dion of Turkey, and composer Atilla Özdemiroğlu likened her to a modern-day bard. Her songs are known for their ability to express common people's troubles, and Neslihan has stated that her goal is to help humanity through her music.  Biography  Neslihan was born in Malatya, Turkey, in 1983. When she was in second grade, her family moved to Mersin, Turkey, a city whose vibrant musical culture she credits with deepening her interest in music, particularly the guitar. Neslihan started writing lyrics for her songs when she was in middle school. She composed her first song when she was 14 years old. In high school, she sold her university exam preparation books in order to buy her first guitar. She taught herself to play the guitar by practicing five hours a day. After living in Mersin for ten years, Neslihan and her family moved to Istanbul, Turkey. She completed her last year of high school there and started studying for a degree in business.  Career  In 2005, Neslihan rose to national prominence in Turkey when her father encouraged her to upload two demo songs, \\"Hiç Sevmedim\\" and \\"Sen,\\" onto VazgectimSenden.com, a website popular with the younger generation in Turkey that had more than 150,000 members at the time. Thousands of people listened to her songs, and Arma Müzik offered her a record deal shortly thereafter. Neslihan made her mark in Turkey by being one of the first artists to rapidly reach success online, a feat made possible by her popularity among university students. Neslihan's first album, Karalarda Beyazlar [\\"Whites in Blacks\\"], was released in April 2006 by Arma Müzik, and it was produced by Ömer Aydın. Neslihan composed the lyrics and music for all ten of the songs in this album, which featured traditional instruments like the ney (end-blown flute), bağlama (special stringed instrument), and Qanun (zither) that shaped the album's \\"unique pop\\" style. In December 2006, she gave her first concert at Gazi University in Ankara, Turkey. Even though the venue only allowed for a capacity of 1,000 seats, more than 3,000 people attended. In March 2007, Neslihan was nominated for Best Female Breakout Artist of 2006 in the 13th Kral TV Video Music Awards. In 2009, Neslihan released her second album, Pollyanna, for which she once again composed all of the lyrics and music. Pollyanna was released by Su Müzik Productions and the Raks Müzik label, and it was distributed by Maksimum Müzik. It was produced by Serdar Uygun and Aslı Hünel, arranged and managed by Erhan Doğancıoğlu, and recorded by Uluberk Hekimoğlu. Mehmet Ali Nalbant filmed the first music video for this album based on the song, \\"Vurgun Yedim.\\" While composing the songs for this album, Neslihan worked by candlelight in her music studio because that atmosphere inspired her. In 2012, Neslihan released her third album, Masal Gibi. The album included a new arrangement of Neslihan's first hit song, \\"Hiç Sevmedim,\\" alongside ten other new songs. Mehmethan Dişbudak arranged the songs and also contributed to the lyrics in one song. Neslihan's mother, Selma Zafer, contributed to the lyrics of another song. The lyrics and music of all other songs were composed by Neslihan. Neslihan also hosted music-related radio programs for five years: three years on Dünya Radyo, one year on the Turkish national radio channel TRT FM, and one year on Radyo 7. Neslihan is known for spontaneously writing and performing songs based on one-word prompts from audience members during live performances. She says she values her listeners' feedback and tries to incorporate their suggestions into later songs and music videos. Neslihan has been influenced by listening to Barış Manço, Leman Sam, Sezen Aksu, Zeki Müren, and Belkıs Özener, as well as Göksel Baktagir and Müzeyyen Senar. Discography  Personal life  Neslihan responded to criticisms of her lack of revealing her body by stating that she wants people to take an interest in her for her skills as a musician, not for her choice of clothing.

The Nollendorf-Theater opened 20 March 1913. Described as \\"historically, [...] the most important cinema in Berlin\\", it incorporated a number of technical innovations such as an opening roof and a daylight projection screen, and opened as the Nollendorf-Theater in March 1913. The cinema was built by a group of US investors allied with the Italian film company CinesPronounced Chee-néss which included the American millionaire Joe Goldsoll (a high-class swindler and con-man); Albert H.

The Nollendorf-Theater was rumoured to have been \\"paid for by the Pope's money.\\" \\"The manager [of the Nollendorf] confided to me that the company was backed by an important bank at Rome and added, as he showed off to me the marvels of his establishment: \\"All this kind of thing is paid for by the Pope's money.

It became the Cines Nollendorf-Theater in 1914, but Cines collapsed in late 1915 after the Banco di Roma, one of its main investors, fell into financial difficulties. The building was acquired by the Union-Theater Lichtspiele (U.-T.) chain of cinemas, part of Paul Davidson's PAGU company. Although PAGU was bought in late 1917 by Universum-Film AG (Ufa), the cinema continued to be known as the Union-Theater Nollendorfplatz until 1923. It was renamed as Ufa-Theater Nollendorfplatz in 1924 and finally as the Ufa-Pavillon in 1927. It was badly damaged during World War 2 in an RAF bombing raid in late 1943. Design The façade of the Nollendorf-Theater cinema. 1913 drawing by August Unger, who also designed the internal décor and the curtain in the auditorium. Poster for a Deutsche Werkbund exhibition in Cologne from May to October 1914, after a design by Peter Behrens The Cines Nollendorf Theater was one of a number of buildings constructed during a brief period in Berlin's industrial and public architecture from around 1900 where Historicism (represented by the Gründerzeit and the highly decorative Jugendstil movements) came to an end, to be replaced by Modern Architecture from the early 1920s onwards. The architect was Oskar Kaufmann, one of the proponents of the so-called 'Neuberliner' architectural style, largely influenced by the work of Alfred Messel who had died in 1909: : \\"In our new Berlin style—which has been cultivated by a majority of the exuberant upcoming students of Messel—the pillar that we have been lacking for so long (particularly the elongated Doric architecture) is once more finally drawn into the light of day.\\" The seated figure over the entrance and the bas-reliefs of the external frieze were by sculptor Franz Metzner,\\"Im Jahre 1912 folgte ein größerer Relieffries für das von Oskar Kaufmann errichtete Cines-Theater am Nollendorfplatz.\\" Franz Metzner Also worked with Kaufmann on the Volksbühne, and with Patriz Huber on decorating Ibach pianos. Source: Alexander Koch und die Darmstädter Mathildenhöhe and was responsible for the internal decoration. The stained glass windows in the foyer were executed by from Unger's designs: says the windows were done by Gottfried Heinersdorff's father, Paul Gerhard Heinersdorff: but his dates (1844–1900) make it somewhat likely that Gottfried (1883–1941) was responsible. and and created the ceiling lights with their figurines in the auditorium.They also worked on the Stadttheater Bremerhaven (bas-reliefs capitals of the Four Humours on the harbour side of the theatre). (see also Wikimedia category:Hermann Feuerhahn. The Nollendorf-Theater can be seen as an example of architectural 'Gesamtkunstwerk', a work created by a typical assemblage of masters of their craft found particularly in Germany (and less so in the United States). The films made by Ufa and other companies shown in the cinema during the 20s and 30s were also informed by this idea of an artistic guild of equals. This collective approach resulted in a flexible, dynamic and fluid group of artistically minded, highly creative and even visionary film-makers which produced many of the classic films which are still discussed and referenced in the 21st century. The architecture of the Nollendorf-Theater is plainer and more severe than the Gründerzeit and Jugendstil styles, and embodies distinctly 'modern' sculptural and artistic motifs. The overall approach seems to have some stylistic connections with and the Deutscher Werkbund, a \\"cultural-economic association of artists, architects, entrepreneurs/businessmen and experts\\", founded in 1907.'als wirtschaftskulturelle \\"Vereinigung von Künstlern, Architekten, Unternehmern und Sachverständigen\\"...gegründet' Other contemporary developments in search of \\"a more modern and useful architecture\\" for Berlin include: the AEG turbine plant by Peter Behrens (1909); Kaufmann's Volksbühne and the introduced new trends in theatre construction (in addition to the Ufa-Pavillon and his 1914 conversion of the Groß-Berlin Theater, later the Ufa-Palast am Zoo; the Pergamon Museum and the capital's first department stores were drafted by Alfred Messel; and Hermann Muthesius designed a new and modern Country House style for Berlin's newly developing suburbs. Description Edward B. Kinsila in his book Modern Theater Construction gives a (fulsome, bordering on purple prose) description of the interior of the Nollendorf. Also, from an article in the contemporary trade journal Kinotheater: :\\"Opposite the 'Mozartsaal' a curious building has arisen, and the gazes of the passers-by are already steered towards the exterior, with its windowless and thus distinguished, seemingly inventive, façade. The glass paintings (illuminated from the inside) which constitute a unique decoration of the entrance, bespeak—through their symbolic figures—the building's purpose: a cinema. :At first glance the auditorium comes across as almost overwhelming. If you didn't know that it has been decked out after the American paradigm, you might suppose that you were being confronted with an entirely new style. This is something genuinely new for Berlin, and one must give Oskar Kaufmann his due, for he has understood how to bring to fruition something outstanding and appropriate to its purpose. The room, decorated in ivory colours, is completely carpeted in grey plush, against which the lilac folding seats are advantageously silhouetted. The ceiling gravitates downwards towards sumptuous, multi-coloured relief arabesques, and the light fixtures are of outstanding beauty. :The theatre contains 650 places,The online source says 850, probably a mis-transcription somewhere. A study of the architectural plan shows that there were approximately 643 seats: c500 in the stalls, c100 in the circle, and c43 in the boxes. whose prices between 1 and 3 marks are allotted to stalls, circle and boxes. The staircase does not lead separately – like in German theatres in general – to the auditorium, but from both sides of the stalls; and (through the continuous curved arc of the balcony) generates a wholly idiosyncratic embellishment of the house. Everything is austerely modern, plain, and elegant.\\" The film critic of the Berlin daily ' was much taken with the auditorium on the opening night: :\\"First, a word about the interior of the theatre: Adorable. Damped, effective light falls down through splendid bronze balls. The whole plain, sober and simple interior is delicately mauve -white; even the numerous ushers (Platzanweiser) are exceptional in their new violet tailcoat livery. All in all, a jewellery box of the very best kind.\\"\\"Wort über das Innere des Theaters: Entzückend. Gedämpftes, wirkungsvolles Licht fällt durch prächtige Bronzekugeln verteilt hernieder. Das ganze schlicht vornehm und einfach gehaltene Innere ist in zartes violett-weiss gehalten; selbst die zahlreichen \\"Platzanweiser\\" gefallen sich ausnehmend in ihren neuen violetten Frack-Livreen. Alles in allem ein Schmuckkästchen eigenster Art.\\" It was not as big as the Ufa-Palast am Zoo, which soon become Berlin's premier cinema. The Ufa-Palast was also owned/leased by Goldsoll and Woods and converted in 1913 from a stage theatre by Oskar Kaufmann. The Ufa-Pavillon was seems to have been used more for press showings. ;Not so Oriental Somewhat confusingly, 'Cines' is also a native adjective in the German language, meaning 'Chinese'. However, the Cines-Theater was not a 'Chinese theatre', as at least two writers seem to believe., citing Edwin Heathcote (2001). Cinema Builders. West Sussex: Wiley-Academy, p. 16: \\"European architects were the first to adopt Asian influences in theater design. Oskar Kaufmann designed the Cines-Theater in Berlin's Nollendorfplatz in 1911.\\" Critical reception Seated figure by Franz Metzner above the main entrance of the Cines Nollendorf-Theater, c.1913. In later years it was usually hidden behind a large advertising poster. According to one contemporary critic, the building exhibited \\"the gracefully ironic pathos, the erotically overloaded sacrilege, the rhythmical dissonance of solemnity and dance\\", which became the key formal elements of the 'Ufa style.', citing Brennicke & Hembus, Klassiker des deutschen Stummfilms, 1910–1930 (Munich, 1983), p. 241, possibly citing Die Schaubühne, 2 October 1913. \\"Cinema buildings are not, at any rate, slow in arriving, and take interesting forms of great experimental significance, as is the case of Oskar Kaufmann's Cines Theater, inaugurated in 1913.\\" Before World War 1, \\"Germany had led the world in the development of serious, modern cinema architecture. Oskar Kauffmann's [...] Cines-Theater in Berlin's Nollendorfplatz was one of the first significant free-standing purpose-built cinema structures. It was among the first attempts at a sober, modern language of cinema architecture, presenting an austere picture to the world with three looming blank walls \\". With its somewhat detached, intellectual, high-cultural prose, Berliner Architekturwelt briefly referred to the new cinemas in Berlin, singling out the building on the Nollendorfplatz: :\\"We lack the space to completely register the 'cinemas'; it should at least be mentioned that the first of this type, namely the edifice built by Oscar Kaufmann on the Nollendorfplatz has been inaugurated, and the newest scintillating Muse (albeit 'Piccadillyfied' by the imbecile name of Cines),This may refer to the 'Lichtspieltheater im Piccadillyhaus' cinema within the Haus Potsdam (1911–1912). Coincidentally, this building housed the headquarters of Ufa from c1917 to 1927. Alternatively, it may refer to the illuminated signs which had recently begun to invade London's Piccadilly Circus: the words 'Cines Nollendorf Theater' appeared above the statue over the entrance. genuinely offers an artistic home which we also think to publicise. The same artist, as is generally known, is now finishing the Theater der neuen freien Volksbühne – whose future is now assuredThere had been some delay in financing the theatre. – in the Bülowplatz in Scheunenviertel, which thereby perhaps gets away from his past.Translated from \\"Vollends die Vermehrung der „Kientöppe\\" zu vermerken, fehlt es uns an Raum; erwähnt soll immerhin aber sein, daß das erste nur diesem Zweck, und zwar von Oskar Kaufmann errichtete Gebäude am Nollendorfplatz eröffnet worden ist, und der neuesten flimmernden Muse ein ernst künstlerisch gemeintes, wenn auch durch den blöden Namen Cines „verpiccadillytes\\" Heim bietet, das auch wir zu veröffentlichen denken. \\"Der gleiche Künstler schafft bekanntlich auch das nun gesicherte Theatre der neuen freien Volksbühne am Bülowplatz im Scheunenviertel, das damit vielleicht endlich von seiner Vergangenheit loskommt.\\"See also lengthy description (in German) in Berliner Architekturwelt. \\"An early high point of the grounding phase of the film palaces was the Cines-Theater, opened in 1913, the first \\"free-standing building conceived solely in the interests of cinema\\", a \\"sober, grey, and particularly windowless cube.\\", cited in .\\"Früher Höhepunkt der Gründungphase von Filmpaläste war das 1913 eröffneter \\"Cines-Theater\\", der erste \\"nur für die Belange des Kinos konziptierte freistehende Bau\\", ein \\"schlichter grauer und insbesondere fensterloser Kubus.\\" Early history =Background= In December 1908 a highly restrictive and monopolistic trust, the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC), otherwise known as the 'Edison Trust', was set up to combine the power of the major US film companies. This was particularly worrying for European film makers, since they were almost entirely excluded from the American market. They met in Paris in February 1909 to discuss sales and rental methods to get out a crisis of over-production (especially in France) and the supply of film stock (mostly made by Eastman Kodak) to the European manufacturers. The Cines logo Present at the meeting was a representative of Cines ('Società Italiana Cines'), an Italian film production company based in Rome. It had opened branches in London, Paris and Barcelona by 1907, and was the distributor for the Ambrosio Film production company of Turin. Cines began to expand considerably outside Italy, making preparations for an 'escalation strategy' to spend more on film productions and film portfolios. Cines had no distributor in the US at the time, and Mario A. Stevani (director general of Cines since 1910) made a trip to the USA in March–May 1911, and signed a contract with the Edison Trust (MPPC) to sell a million meters (3 million feet) of film per year. His main contact was George Kleine, a Chicago film importer and leading member of the MPPC, who made huge profits importing foreign films into the US, using his MPPC-license to acquire the films. Kleine became the distributor of Cines films in the US, and the Marquis di Serra (one of the directors of Cines) was appointed agent in the UK. Cines also received an injection of capital from a group of US investors, acquiring cinemas and distributors in Germany to increase its share of the marginal cinema revenues that its films generated: in 1912 Cines had a capital of 3.75 million lire ($712,125)., citing Traub, Hans (1943). Die Ufa : ein Beitrag zur Entwicklungsgeschichte des deutschen Filmschaffens (in German). Berlin: Ufa-Büchverlag, p. 9. Among the American investors and interested parties were: F. J. \\"Joe\\" Goldsoll; his younger brother L. H. Goldsoll, and Edward B. Kinsila; Albert H. Woods (who invested $160,000); Klaw and Erlanger and Charles Frohman, theatrical impresarios; and Pat Casey, an experienced vaudeville agent. Goldsoll was the general manager of his Cines-Theater AG company, which held the Cines rights for Germany. This was a separate entity from the parent Cines company in Rome. =Construction= U-Bahn station (l. foreground) and Neues Schauspielhaus (c.). The Ufa-Pavillon was built in front of the tower of the American Church in Berlin (r.) Although its exact origins are slightly unclear, the cinema seems to have been built from mid-1912 by Joe Goldsoll, a millionaire high-class con man and swindler whose Cines-Theater AG company owned the rights to Cines films in Germany. He appears (as F. J. Goldsoll) as its owner ('Eigentümer)' in the 1913 Berlin address book. With sketch map of the addresses on Nollendorfplatz. Abbreviations (p. 2): 'E'=Eigentümer (owner), 'V'=Verwalter, (caretaker, custodian), 'T'=Telephone. Goldsoll, as the main financial backer, was joined by Albert H. Woods (sometimes shortened to Al. Woods), a Hungarian theatrical producer based in New York, whose interest in films and cinemas seems to have begun with his involvement with the 1912 film The Miracle, produced by Joseph Menchen. Al. Woods's wife was Goldsoll's cousin. The late owner of the previous building on the new cinema's site was Baron Rudolf von Renvers, \\"v. Renvers, R., Dr., Prof., Geh.[heimer] Med.[izin] Rat.\\" von Bülow's doctor and confidant, who died in 1909. The deal to build the cinema was promoted by the slightly unusual Edward B. Kinsila, at the time a London-based American property developer: he later became a cinema and film studio designer in the US. Goldsoll, \\"a non-combatant in show-things\\", with Al. Woods and a \\"theatrical mob\\" including A. L. Erlanger, Pat CaseyCasey was an experienced vaudeville agent, see Vermazen, Bruce (2004). That Moaning Saxophone : The Six Brown Brothers and the Dawning of a Musical Craze and Charles Frohman, sailed on the for a 4- to 6-week tour of Europe on 3 April 1912. One of the first mentions of the new cinema appeared in the Moving Picture World in October 1912: :\\"Projection Department: From Berlin\\" :Mr. Edward B. Kinsila, Nollendorf Theater, Berlin, Germany, writes: :\\"I am building here what I hope will be the finest cinematograph theater in the world, and naturally I want to give the very best picture. The auditorium will be lighted during the showing of the picture, and the screen placed back on a thoroughly darkened stage about 18 feet from the proscenium opening. The throw will be made through the auditorium onto the screen, a distance of about 70 feet. It is my understanding that the best light effect is produced where the amperage is high and the voltage low, or the reverse. Will you be good enough to tell me just what voltage and amperage of direct current will be the very best? I can use up to 220 volts, and any amperage I like. I have no desire to economize on the light. I want the best effect, that is all.\\" In December 1912 Kinsila (or Kinsella) claimed to be associated with Goldsoll in the building of the new cinema: :\\"Berlin's finest and newest cinematograph playhouse, the Nollendorf Theater, which is about to open its doors, is the creation and property of two Americans, the Messrs. Goldsoll and Kinsella. The building, which is like a Greek temple, is architecturally one of the most striking structures in the Kaiser's capital, and does much to beautify the big Nollendorf Platz, on which it stands. :The new theatre contains one feature which is an absolute novelty in German picture-houses, namely, that it does not require to be darkened while the films are being shown. Its domed roof is also an innovation, as it is built to be removed in summer, and during other propitious weather, so at night the spectators have nothing above them but the starlit heavens.\\" Also in Motography, 9 Dec 1912 Vol XI #1, p.24. and repeated in Motography, 4 January 1913 p. 24 It was also the first cinema with a sloping floor and the seating in a fan-shaped arrangement. However, by the time the Nollendorf-Theater opened in March 1913 Kinsila seems to have left the scene, and it was being reported as the \\"creation and property of F. J. Goldsoll and Al. Woods.\\" =Opening= Hanns Heinz Ewers, who gave a speech at the opening night of the Nollendorf-Theater. The inauguration on 19 March 1913 of this \\"palace of unheard-of luxury\\" made a \\"genuine sensation.\\" The evening began with a dithyrambic speech in praise of the cinema (the Kintopp) by Hanns Heinz Ewers, one of the most outspoken pro-Autorenfilm literati.\\"Cines Nollendorftheater\\" (in German). Der Tag, 20 May 1913. Early German Cinema Database. Retrieved 8 January 2017. The main attraction, however, was the German première of the Cines blockbuster epic of Ancient Rome Quo Vadis?, to which Woods and Goldsoll controlled the German rights.New York Clipper, 24 May 1913 p. 2 Woods also owned the worldwide rights outside the US, where the rights were controlled by George Kleine. Like the presentation of the film of The Miracle in London and New York (to which Woods also owned the rights), Quo Vadis? also featured live actors in the auditorium to reinforce some scenes: \\"special mobs\\" were organised by Ryszard Ordynski (Richard Ardinski), Max Reinhardt's manager at the Deutsches Theater, who had stage-managed performances of The Miracle (play) in London in 1911–12, and later in Vienna in 1914. The page says that The Miracle played in Paris, but this seems not to be the case. See The Miracle (1912 film) § Germany. There was an orchestra of about twenty-five men and a full line of sound effects. The orchestra was hidden behind a balustrade between the audience and the screen. The theatre manager Jacob J. Rosenthal, visiting Berlin, wrote that \\"Quo Vadis is creating a furore in Berlin though it has been very badly mutilated by the censor, who doesn't seem to offer much objection to the risqué or even the immoral, but who strenuously objects to fights or violence. You can imagine what happened to Quo Vadis.It is possible that the live costumed action in the auditorium was partly to compensate for the censor's cuts. The critic of the Berlin newspaper ' was more enthusiastic about Ewers' speech than the film which followed: : \\"With his optimism Evers is not wrong: simply, the cinema's victorious career will reach a very different goal than is given to it today. Not entertainment, but instruction will be the main attraction of cinema in the future. Individual scenes were animated by singing, applause, etc., which can be described as partly successful.\\"\\"Mit seinem Optimismus wird Evers nicht unrecht behalten, nur dass die Siegeslaufbahn des Kinos ein ganz anderes Ziel erreicht, als ihm heute gegeben wird. Nicht die Unterhaltung, sondern die Belehrung wird der Hauptzweck des Kinos in der Zukunft sein. Einzelne Bilder wurden durch Gesang, Beifallklatschen usw. belebt, welcher Versuch als teils gelungen bezeichnet werden kann.\\" The critic Ferdinand Kiss was especially vitriolic about the whole affair: :At the Nollendorfplatz in Berlin, a new cinema has been let loose upon humanity. The opening film: Quo Vadis, or the persecution of Berliners by Nero in anno 1913. [...] And to outdo all that has gone before – within the film, and in general – one reaches to a desperate medium. What flickers up yonder? Is it Nielsen? Perhaps Lindner?Probably Friedrich Lindner (1875–1955) Or even Nauke?The comedian Marcel Fabre (born Marcel Fernandez Peréz), a former circus clown, whose film character was known as 'Nauke' in Germany and Holland, 'Robinet' in France and Spain, and 'Tweedledum' in Britain and USA.. No, it's Ewers [ ... ], \\"the cinema's most fervent advocate, who consecrated the newly opened movie-house by means of a dithyrambic speech.\\" In all other respects, it's downhill too. Fate has ordained filming and Ewers. [ ... ] How will it all end? We want to experience Nauke and see only the flickering Ewers instead.\\", citing the journal Die Aktion. According to one report, the Nollendorf-Theater and the Cines-Palast am Zoo, where Quo Vadis? also showed, were each taking about 4,500 marks ($1,000) a night with 'Quo Vadis,' giving two performances nightly but no matinees. Still from Quo Vadis? Siegfried Kracauer, writing in 1947, was evidently unaware of the live element incorporated into the film show: :\\"Despite the evolution of domestic production, foreign films continued to flood German movie theaters, which had considerably increased in number since 1912. A new Leipzig Lichtspiel palace was inaugurated with Quo Vadis, an Italian pageant that actually received press reviews as if it were a real stage play.\\" Kracauer is referring here to the opening night of the Königspavillon-Theater on Promenadestrasse, Leipzig (lessees, Goldsoll & Woods), on Thursday 24 April 1913 with Quo Vadis?, complete with real actors and a prologue (probably spoken by the \\"flickering Ewers\\"). This seems to be exactly the same show as on the opening night of the Nollendorf-Theater in Berlin in March 1913. The house manager of the Cines- Theater in 1913 and 1914 was the stage actor Valy Arnheim, later a film director and actor. Later history By the end of May 1913 the cinema had been renamed the Cines Nollendorf Theater. After the success of Quo Vadis?, Woods and Goldsoll opened a large chain of theatres in Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, many for Kinovaudeville shows. They leased fourteen houses in Germany, including six in Berlin; the second of these after the Nollendorf-Theater was the Groß-Berlin Theater (later the Ufa-Palast am Zoo) which was converted into a kino-vaudeville cinema, where the architect was again Oscar Kaufmann. =Banco di Roma= Monsignor Eugenio Pacelli (the future Pope Pius XII and nephew of Ernesto Pacelli, president of the Banco di Roma, (l.) and Cardinal Secretary Merry del Val at the signing ceremony of the Serbian concordat, underneath the picture of Pope Pius X, 24 June 1914 Assertions that the Pope's money was involved in the building of the Nollendorf , appear to be based on more than mere rumour. The Banco di Roma was co-founded in 1880 by Ernesto Pacelli, who soon had the confidence of Pope Leo XIII. According to John F. Pollard , \\"It would [...] be no exaggeration to say that the Pacellis were the most important family to be associated with the Papacy since the Borgias.\\" The Società Italiana Cines was founded in Rome in April 1906, and Pacelli became a director before August 1910. The Banco di Roma. apparently speculating with Papal funds, was also running dubious bank- owned enterprises in Tripoli and Salonika (and possibly perhaps Mogadishu, Somalia). Joe Goldsoll seems to have become involved with Cines in around 1912, and if there is any truth in the rumours that the Nollendorf-Theater was \\"paid for by the Pope's money\\", they would probably revolve around the fact that a hard-gambling, high-class con man and swindler, cited in and the president of a bank which was a quarter owned by the Vatican were both directors of closely linked film and theatre companies. Unfortunately, the bank was in deep trouble by 1914, having suffered severe losses arising out of the Italo-Turkish War (known in Italy as the Libyan War) of 1911–1912 A contemporary memoir of pre-war Germany summed up the extravagance accompanying the whole corrupt situation: :\\"Then, only a few months before the war, the whole thing crashed. The exorbitant payment of the writers, musicians, painters, actors, managers, the foolish waste of money caused by the production of certain films, which involved the trailing of whole companies of performers to the most distant corners of the world, hurled the enterprise to inevitable disaster. One bankruptcy followed another, while the ordinary comic and patriotic film and the unpretentious playlet quietly reappeared. The sumptuous palaces were ungilded, became skating rinks, halls for Tango teas, or cabarets.\\" =Collapse of Cines= Goldsoll severed his connection with Cines in February 1914, buying out the interests of Al. Woods and the Società Italian Cines in the Berlin-based Cines-Theater AG: Woods pulled out of Germany altogether. Goldsoll re-organized his much-reduced assets as the Palast-Theater AG, taking control of the Cines Palast am Zoo and the Cines cinemas, and leasing the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Städtisches Theater for operetta. The Cines Nollendorf-Theater \\"reverted\\" to the Società Italiana Cines. A German Cines company was formed, Deutsche Cines GmbH, whose offices occupied the old address of Cines-Theater AG at Friedrichstrasse 11. Goldsoll invested in Ambrosio Film, based in Turin, becoming a director by July 1914. When World War 1 broke out in August 1914 Italy was nominally allied with the Central Powers, but remained neutral. The war triggered a general international financial instability, and in the public rush to buy War Bonds, 18.3 million lire were withdrawn from the Banco di Roma between January and March 1914. Italy eventually joined the Triple Entente and declared war on Austria-Hungary in May 1915.Italy didn't declare war against the German Empire until August 1916. The bank continued to haemorrhage its cash deposits and the value of its shares plummeted, despite an emergency loan arranged by Pacelli from the Banco d'Italia. Pacelli resigned as president of the Banco di Roma in September 1915, although he was still personally highly indebted to it. To repay his loans he forfeited his shares in the bank, and was forced to sell his villa. The investments made by Pacelli and the Banco di Roma suddenly unravelled as depositors continued to withdraw millions of lire: by November 1915 Cines had collapsed, along with the bank's other enterprises in Tripoli and Salonika. Union-Theater/PAGU It appears that the Nollendorf-Theater and all the former Cines properties were sold around this time to the Union-Theater (U.T. or U-T Lichtspiele) chain of cinemas, owned by Paul Davidson of PAGU: its name was changed to the Union-Theater Lichtspiele. This corporate name was shared by many other cinemas in Berlin and Germany, such as the in Dresden, and the in Lübeck. Goldsoll's later career During World War 1 Goldsoll, a naturalised French citizen, was imprisoned in D.C. Jail in 1917 while Washington District courts decided whether or not to extradite him to France. He faced charges of defrauding the French war-time government out of millions of dollars in commissions on Pierce-Arrow trucks exported to the French War Department. Goldsoll was released on appeal to the US Supreme Court in 1919.Foster v. Goldsoll, 48 App. Div. D.C. 505 (1919) Goldsoll invested heavily in Goldwyn Pictures, joining the board of directors in July 1919 and, ousting Samuel Goldwyn to become managing director from 1922 to 1924, turned around the fortunes of the ailing company. Woods joined him on the board as a director. =Ufa= Ufa logo Along with Messter-Film and Nordisk Film, PAGU was one of the three main companies which formed the nucleus of giant conglomerate Universum-Film AG (Ufa), set up in complete secrecy by the German government as part of its propaganda effort in late 1917. The companies which made up Ufa retained their individual identities for some time, and by 1921 the cinema was known as the U.-T. Nollendorfplatz although it was owned by Universum-Film AG. The composer Giuseppe Becce conducted the orchestra from 1922, having transferred from the Mozart-Saal at the Neues Schauspielhaus over the road at No. 5 Nollendorfplatz, where he had been since 1915. The cinema was renamed the Ufa-Theater Nollendorfplatz in 1924, but Ufa was bankrupt by 1925, having spent enormous sums on films like Die Nibelungen and Der letzte Mann. It seems likely that Ufa sold back control of the old Union Theater Lichtspiele cinema chain to its former owner, Paul Davidson, former head of production at Ufa. Then in December 1925 Ufa announced the so-called Parufamet contract, which gave virtual control of Ufa's first-run theatres (including the Ufa-Theater am Nollendorfplatz) to Paramount and Metro-Goldwyn-MayerGoldsoll had been president of Goldwyn from 1922 to 1924 before its merger to form MGM. while also granting them 50 percent of income from Ufa's own productions. Two years later Ufa was bought by the right-wing media tycoon Alfred Hugenberg (whose own company Deulig (formerly DLG) had been absorbed into Ufa in 1920), and the cinema received its final name, Ufa-Pavillon in 1927. =Metropolis= Metropolis. Announcements that Fritz Lang's Metropolis would be shown at the Ufa-Pavillon am Nollendorfplatz had appeared as early as 6 January 1927. The cinema's exterior was coated all over with a shimmery silver paint, and illuminated by floodlights; the statue over the entrance was covered by a huge replica gong which featured towards the end of the film. Metropolis received a double world première on 10 January 1927: a gala première at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo, where the director, film crew and cast were in the audience along with the German President Marx, and a lower-key première at the Ufa-Pavillon am Nollendorplatz. Most of the press attended the gala performance at the 2,165 seat Ufa-Palast, and this seems to have given rise to the idea that Metropolis only premièred at the Ufa-Palast, along with a brief news item in Ufa's own publicity magazine: \\"Metropolis was shown with huge success at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo and from the 11th onwards at the Ufa-Pavillon Nollendorfplatz.\\"\\"Metropolls wurde mit Riesenerfolg in dem Ufa-Palast am Zoo und vom 11. ab im Ufa-Pavillon Nollendorfplatz aufgeführt. Presse und Publikum sind einstimmig begeistert über das grandiose Filmwerk.\\" For example, from a review which appeared the following day: \\"The film \\"Metropolis\\", after its premiere yesterday at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo, will be screened from to-day on at the Ufa Pavilion at the Nollendorfplatz. Many books have since repeated this idea that the première took place on 10 January at the Ufa-Palast only, e.g. \\"The day after the premiere, it transferred for four months to the UFA- Pavilion at the Nollendorfplatz\\" However, at least one journalist did go to the screening at the Ufa-Pavillon am Nollendorfplatz on 10 January and wrote a review concentrating on Gottfried Huppertz's score, which was conducted by Richard Etlinger.Etlinger arranged a number of popular works for orchestra. See Ries & Erle sales catalogue, September 2014. Retrieved 4 January 2017. This review appeared in the daily Film Kurier the following day, 11 January, along with a general film review from the UFA-Palast am Zoo., translated in .}} The film continued to show for about four months at the Ufa-Pavillon, the only cinema in the whole of Germany where it could be seen. Ufa's own publicity magazine claimed that \\"Press and public are unanimously thrilled by the grandiose work of cinematography.\\" Although many critics commented favourably on the film's technical achievements, a significant number were singularly unimpressed by the underlying philosophy of the script: Herbert Ihering summed up the single performance at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo: \\"A great premiere – much applause by the audience for the director Fritz Lang, for the cameraman Karl Freund, for the actors Alfred Abel, Heinrich George and Brigitte Helm. As for the film? No effort spared with brilliant technical detail, but it was wasted on a banal, no longer pertinent idea. The city of the future with the text of a bourgeois past.\\" =Destruction= The site of 4 Nollendorfplatz in October 2019 The cinema was closed after it was damaged during an RAF bombing raid in 1943. There were 17 large raids on Berlin from November 1943 to the end of January 1944. It seems quite possible that the Ufa-Pavillon was bombed on 22/23 or 23/24 November 1943, right at the start of the Battle of Berlin: \\"A vast area of destruction stretched from the central districts westwards across the mainly residential districts of Tiergarten and Charlottenburg\\". Buildings destroyed or severely damaged include: Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church and the Gloria-Palast, the Ufa-Palast am Zoo across the square, the Berlin Zoo and much of the Unter den Linden. The American Church in Berlin (literally next door) was destroyed probably in early 1944. A block of 1960s era apartments now stands on the site.

Wood published numerous collections of poetry as well as children's novels, fiction, and nonfiction. Major themes and influences in her work were Native American culture of the Southwestern United States. Her career, which spanned over five decades, included 28 publications of prose and poetry, and several photograph collections. Wood was a National Endowment for the Arts fellow, and a recipient of the Lee Bennett Hopkins Poetry Award. Early life Wood was born to an Irish Catholic family in Trenton, New Jersey, where she was raised. She began work as a writer at 14 at the Beachcomber newspaper on Long Beach Island, NJ. She attended Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. Career Wood moved to Colorado in 1958, where she lived until 1985 when she moved to New Mexico. After visiting Taos Pueblo in New Mexico in 1962, Wood became greatly influenced by the Puebloan peoples' culture and spiritual beliefs, which would come to inform her literary work. \\"It was 180 degrees from what I knew growing up,\\" she said. \\"Nature was the center. I began to think in those terms— here was not just a 'religion' but a whole way of being and seeing.\\" Originally working as a writer, her first book was a collaboration with husband and photographer Myron Wood, titled Central City: A Ballad of the West (1963). Her first work of poetry was published by Doubleday in 1974, titled Many Winters: Prose and Poetry of the Pueblos, inspired by her time spent in the Taos Pueblo. This would mark a lasting collaboration with illustrator Frank Howell, who provided artwork and illustrations for Wood's publications until his death in 1997. She would go on to publish numerous collections of poetry into the 2000s, as well as novels and photograph collections. Wood also published children's books, including How the Tiny People Grew Tall: An Original Creation Tale (2005), and Mr. and Mrs. God in the Creation Kitchen (2006), both of which recount traditional tales of the Pueblo people, as well as Thunderwoman (1999), which retells a Pueblo creation myth. In 2007, Wood published Eye of the West through University of New Mexico Press, followed by The Soledad Crucifixion, which earned her a posthumous Zia Award from the university. Wood received many honors throughout her career, including a National Endowment for the Arts literary fellowship, and a Lee Bennett Hopkins Poetry Award for her 1993 book, Spirit Walker. Personal life Wood was married three times: first to Oscar Dull, then Myron Wood, and John Brittingham. She had four children. In early 2013, Wood was diagnosed with terminal melanoma. She died at her home in Eldorado at Santa Fe, New Mexico on March 12, 2013.

Allyl is the radical with the connectivity CH2CHCH2, although as a ligand it is usually viewed as an allyl anion CH2=CH−CH2−, which is usually described as two equivalent resonance structures. Examples and their syntheses The allyl ligand is commonly in organometallic chemistry. Most commonly, allyl ligands bind to metals via all three carbon centers, the η3-binding mode. An example of a homoleptic allyl complex is Ir(η3-allyl)3. More common are complexes with allyl and other ligands. Examples include (η3-allyl)Mn(CO)4 and CpPd(allyl). Allyl complexes are often generated by oxidative addition of allylic halides to low-valent metal complexes. This route is used to prepare (allyl)2Ni2Cl2: :2 Ni(CO)4 \\\\+ 2 ClCH2CH=CH2 → Ni2(μ-Cl)2(η3-C3H5)2 \\\\+ 8 CO A similar oxidative addition involves the reaction of allyl bromide to diiron nonacarbonyl. Other methods of synthesis involve addition of nucleophiles to η4-diene complexes and hydride abstraction from alkene complexes. Lastly allyl ligands are produced by salt metathesis reactions starting with allyl Grignard and allyl lithium reagents. Chelating bis(allyl) complexes General structure of a chelating bis(allyl) complex of Ru (L = alkene, phosphine). 1,3-Dienes such as butadiene and isoprene dimerize in the coordination spheres of some metals, giving chelating bis(allyl) complexes. Such complexes also arise from ring- opening of divinylcyclobutane. Chelating bis(allyl) complexes are intermediates in the metal-catalyzed dimerization of butadiene to give vinylcyclohexene and cyclooctadiene. Sigma-allyl Complexes with η1-allyl ligands are also known. One example is CpFe(CO)2(η1-allyl) where only the methylene group is attached to the Fe centre. Such compounds often convert to the η3-allyl derivatives by dissociation of a ligand: : CpFe(CO)2(η1-allyl) → CpFe(CO)(η3-allyl) + CO Benzyl complexes Structure of tetrabenzylzirconium with H atoms omitted for clarity. Benzyl and allyl ligands often exhibit similar chemical properties. Benzyl commonly adopt either η1 or η3 bonding modes. The interconversion reactions parallel those of η1\\\\- or η3-allyl ligands: :CpFe(CO)2(η1-CH2Ph) → CpFe(CO)(η3-CH2Ph) + CO In all bonding modes, the benzylic carbon is more strongly attached to the metal as indicated by M-C bond distances, which differ by ca. 0.2 Å in η3-bonded complexes. X-ray crystallography demonstrate that the benzyl ligands in tetrabenzylzirconium are highly flexible. One polymorph features four η2-benzyl ligands, whereas another polymorph has two η1\\\\- and two η2-benzyl ligands. Applications In terms of applications, a popular allyl complex is allyl palladium chloride.Tatsuno, Y.; Yoshida, T.; Otsuka, S. \\"(η3-allyl)palladium(II) Complexes\\" Inorganic Syntheses, 1990, volume 28, pages 342-345.

It was launched by Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520–66), and took place between June 1554 and May 1555. It was part of the wider Sunni–Shia conflict. Background The campaign was triggered by the 1550–52 Safavid attacks in eastern Anatolia which devastated Van and Erzurum, and left many Sunnis dead. In a letter dated July 1554, the Ottomans invited the Safavids to battle, then repeated the famous fatwa of Ibn Kemal. The campaign, which was the third expedition during the war, and was led by Suleiman himself and Governor- General of Rumelia Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, and included forces from the Balkans (the Rumelia Eyalet). The Balkan forces were stationed at Tokat and spent the winter of 1553–54 there, then in June 1554 joined up with the Sultan's Army coming from Aleppo in Suşehri. The Balkan forces took part in the whole campaign. The campaign The Ottomans raided Safavid Azerbaijan and killed both Sunni and Shia. Safavid palaces, villas and gardens were destroyed, and Yerevan, Karabakh and Nakhchivan were captured by the Ottomans. The Mahmudi tribe in Van (not subdued by the Ottomans during the Ottoman capture of Van in 1548) under their leader Hasan, until then loyal to the Safavids, switched sides to the Ottomans following the attack on Azerbaijan in 1554. Ebussuud, the Ottoman chief jurisconsult (şeyhülislâm), issued a fatwa in 1554 that endorsed the enslavement of Safavid captives, and contrary to previous practice, they could be sold like non-Muslims. The Safavids did not enslave Ottoman subjects, but executed them. Suleiman's army took thousands of captives in Nakhchivan in July 1554. Ebussuud's fatwa did however assert that the enslavement of captured Kizilbaş (Shia) children in Nakhchivan was not lawful. Suleiman threatened to destroy Ardabil and its shrine if Safavid intrusions did not stop. Both sides had terrible losses, with no outright victor. Aftermath Suleiman received a Safavid delegation at his winter quarters in Amasya to negotiate peace. Regarding territory, a Safavid recognition of Ottoman rule in Iraq and eastern Anatolia would return Yerevan, Karabakh and Nakhchivan. Regarding religious matters, the Safavids were promised that Shia pilgrims would not be prevented on visiting their sanctuaries in Ottoman territory, on the condition of Safavid abolition of tabarru. The Peace was signed at Amasya and brought half a century of Ottoman- Safavid war to an end. With the conclusion of hostilities in May 1555, the commanders Malkoçoğlu Balı Bey and their forces were permitted to return to Rumelia. Ottoman–Safavid correspondence following the war was friendly.

He is typically referred to as George W. Shaver or G.W. Shaver. Early life George Washington Shaver was born in Campbell County, Kentucky on March 2, 1832. George W. Shaver arrived in Oregon 1850. Shaver had first gone overland to California for the 1849 gold rush. Shaver settled briefly in Waldo, Oregon, in Josephine County, where he tried gold mining again. This did not prove successful, so he relocated to Portland, Oregon, arriving there on February 2, 1854. About this time he was married to Sarah Dixon (1836–1910), whose parents, James and Susan Dixon, were residents of Roseburg. The Dixons had originally come from Kentucky. Following the marriage, Shaver resided with his wife on a farm in Marion County, Oregon. They had four children together when they lived on the farm. After relocating to Portland in 1860 they had six more children. They lived in what is now known as the Irvington addition in Portland. The Shaver residence in Portland was located between Crosby and Larrabee Streets and Cherry and Broadway. It was still in existence in 1910. Business career Shaver entered the business of supplying wood to steamers for use as fuel, including both riverine and ocean-going vessels. This resulted in the clearing of large timber tracts. In 1880, Shaver, with his son Capt. James W. Shaver, H.L. Corbett (later a U.S. Senator), and Capt. Charles Bureau, became a partner in the People's Freighting Company and also in the small stern-wheel river steamer Manzanillo, which ran on the Columbia River between Portland and Clatskanie, Oregon. In 1884 the Shaver family bought out all the non-family shareholders in the firm. They built two new steamboats. First was the G.W. Shaver, named after George Washington Shaver, and the Sarah Dixon, named after his wife. Shaver Transportation Company was incorporated in 1893 and took over all the assets of the People's Freighting Company. The stockholders were George W. Shaver and his sons, Captains James W. \\"Jim\\" Shaver (1859–1922) and George McClellan Shaver (d. January 11, 1950). Shaver had another son, Capt. Lincoln \\"Link\\" Shaver (d.1922). Capt. Delmer \\"Del\\" Shaver was another son. George Washington Shaver was the president of Shaver Transportation Company, while his son James M. Shaver was secretary and treasurer. Jim and Lincoln Shaver were killed in 1922, in a collision between an automobile and an electric train. In May 1886, the Democratic Party of Multnomah County, Oregon nominated George W. Shaver for the position of county commissioner. Children Children of George W. Shaver and Sarah Dixon included: * John Riley Shaver (1854–1906), married to Martha J. King (1856–1923). * James W. \\"Jim\\" Shaver. * George McClellan Shaver (1865–1950), married to Maude Keenan (1872–1855). * Delmar \\"Dell\\" Shaver. * Lincoln \\"Link\\" Shaver (1861–1922), married to Bertha Kettler (1867–1946). * Mary Alice Shaver, married to H.

It operates bus transport services in and outside Davao Region with its headquarters, main garage and offices in Davao City. Its main terminals are located in Davao City and Tagum. History Davao Metro Shuttle started as a local taxi service in 1995 serving the city of Davao in what has been a partnership between businessmen Reynaldo T. Uy (who later went on to be mayor of Tagum) and Reynaldo Alba. When it procured its first air-conditioned bus units in 1996, its first service was the Davao-Digos route. In 1998 the company started servicing the Davao-Tagum route after purchasing 20 non-aircon bus units. In 1998 their range of service once again expanded when they started servicing the Davao-Kidapawan route using Daewoo buses. As time went on, and as the company went cycles of financial setbacks and recovery, its service routes expanded greatly on time to include Bansalan, Malita, Monkayo, Compostela, New Bataan, & Laak. The Davao Metro shuttle is set to launch the Go-Mindanao Tour Bus program in 2017, an initiative supported by the Department of Tourism. They are targeting to launch the route by March next year which would initially travel from the city to Bukidnon, Cagayan de Oro and Butuan. On 2 August 2017 the company started servicing the Davao-Butuan-Nasipit route for the first time using Guilin Daewoo buses. Shortly thereafter the company's Go- Mindanao Tour Bus program officially commenced operation as a few of its units, specifically high-deck buses procured from Zhengzhou Yutong Bus covered with stickers of the Go-Mindanao Tour Bus brand, started plying the Davao- Butuan and Davao-New Bataan routes. On 8 November 2018 the company, under its Go-Mindanao Tour Bus subsidiary brand, started plying the Butuan-Bislig route using then newly acquired Golden Dragon luxury buses, marking the first instance that, although the company bears the namesake of the city and the situate region it was mainly serving and based from, the company served completely outside its main areas of operation. Fleet The first bus units of Davao Metro Shuttle came from Nissan Diesel and Daewoo Bus. Later, they also have units from Hino. In 2008 they purchased units from Xiamen Golden Dragon Bus, the first in Mindanao, and in 2010 they purchased units from Zhengzhou Yutong Bus. To date, the fleet of Davao Metro Shuttle is composed of buses and minibuses acquired from Yutong, Golden Dragon, Hino, Daewoo, Nissan Diesel, Hyundai and Volvo. The company was also the first in the Philippines to field buses from THACO acquired in year 2020. Currently, the company is the largest indigenous bus company in Mindanao, possessing more than 200 bus units including from its Go-Mindanao subsidiary.

She was the first director of the Nursing Research Unit in Edinburgh. She was awarded a PhD for research in nursing, one of the first people to do so. Early life Lisbeth Hochsinger was born on 17 October 1918 in Graz, Austria. In 1936 she began studying medicine at the University of Graz where she completed three years of the course before being sent away from the threatening political situation in Hitler's Germany. She was unaware that her family had some Jewish ancestry, but later both her parents were taken to concentration camps where they died. With assistance from the Society of Friends, Hochsinger arrived in England in 1938 and went to Devon to stay with a brigadier and his wife. She first worked as a governess for their children and learned sufficient English to start nursing training in London. Nursing career In 1939 she was accepted to do her general nurse training at The London Hospital. She left the London Hospital on account of a new rule that stopped non-British subjects from nursing people who could be prisoners of war. She was allowed to train at Coppetts Wood Hospital in Muswell Hill and she qualified as a fever nurse in 1943. She then went to the Peace Memorial Hospital in Watford, completing her general nursing training in 1945. She changed her name to Hockey in 1949. She went to the North Middlesex Hospital, Edmonton and studied for her Midwifery Part 1. For the second part of her midwifery training she chose to go to Essex where she would spend time in the district. In 1950 she gained a health visitor qualification from Battersea Polytechnic. In 1965, she began working at the Queen's Institute of District Nursing in London, first as a tutor and then as a research officer. In 1970 she gained a Bachelor of Science in Economics from the University of London. In October 1971, Hockey was appointed the first director of the Nursing Research Unit in Edinburgh. It was the first nursing research unit at a British University. She completed a PhD in 1979, an uncommon achievement. Her PhD was awarded by City University, London and although her thesis was not published, A Study of District Nursing: the development and progression of a long term research programme provided an early description of the responsibilities involved. Later life Although retired, she remained active in the nursing world. The last year of her life was spent in a nursing home. She died in Edinburgh on 16 June 2004. Awards and honours She was made an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1979 Birthday Honours. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) made her a fellow in 1980. She was made an honorary fellow by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) in 1982, the first nurse to be honoured this way. It would be more than twenty years before another nurse was given this same honour. She was proud of this honour, having always intended to care for the whole person. In 1987 she was made an Honorary Member of the Austrian Nursing Association. In 2000 she received the Gold Medal of Honour from the Queen's Nursing Institute, only the fourth person to receive this honour. She was bestowed with honorary degrees from the University of Alberta in 1980, University of Uppsala in 1985 and the Queen Margaret University College, Edinburgh in 1995.

Roseau, Dominica: Central Statistical Office, Ministry of Finance and Planning, Kennedy Avenue, 2001. Belles is a historical site for a few reasons. It is a major part of the highway system to the northern part of the island. The roads were blocked many years ago by Rastafarians who were not happy with the government. Many of them escaped to Jaco Flats and used it for refuge. This is a site that was used by the Maroons hundreds of years ago. As of 2016, the Esprit and Benjamin families own and control a majority of the private land.  History  = Name = The Creole name for the town is Norway (pronounced as \\"nor-way\\". Belles previously named Bassinville got its modern name from Henry Hesketh Bell. This village is located near the center of the island. The main highway Nicholas Liverpool Highway runs north to Marigot. If the road is taken south, it ends up in Roseau, the capital of the island. There is a Catholic church in the village. It is dedicated to Saint Peter Donders (constructed 1929). The feast of Belles 'fete Belles' is celebrated yearly in the village. People come from near and far to celebrate. In recent years, the community, which was heavily dependent on agriculture, remains a significant contributor towards agricultural development on the island. = The Road = An excerpt from Lenox Honychurch, the islands most notable historian states that; By early 1947 the road cutting had only reached the hill at DLeau Gommier and all of the money had disappeared. In three years of work the road had only progressed about a mile and a half. The project closed down and it was not resurrected for almost a decade.

Early life and legal career Hsieh was born in Shangrao on 10 February 1949. At the age of eighteen, she became a schoolteacher. Hsieh's legal career began at age 28, after she had focused her legal studies at National Taiwan University on juvenile delinquency. Hsieh was a judge for eleven years prior to her election to the Legislative Yuan, having been appointed to the Yilan and Hsinchu district courts, as well as the Hualien bench of the Taiwan High Court. Political career Hsieh represented Hsinchu district in the Legislative Yuan from 1993 to 1996. She served another two terms in the Legislative Yuan, winning the 1995 and 1998 elections as a representative of Taichung. During her first term, Hsieh served on the education committee and worked to improve teaching style and curriculum in public schools. Soon after taking office, Hsieh unsuccessfully intervened in the capital punishment case of Liu Huan- jung, a Bamboo Union gang member who had killed five people and been placed on Taiwan's death row for seven years before his execution. She petitioned for the Judicial Yuan to rule on ROC Civil Code Article 1089, which stated that if parents were to disagree on a decision pertaining to the rights of a child, the father's decision was final. As written, Article 1089 was found to be unconstitutional. In further support of children's rights, Hsieh sought harsher punishments for child prostitution. In her second term, Hsieh was named a member of the judicial committee. In 1997, Hsieh supported the passage of amendments to the Law Governing the Disposition of Juvenile Cases, making guardians partly responsible for the actions of juvenile delinquents. The next year, she drafted an amendment to the Sexual Violation Prevention Act and Witness Protection Act, subjecting rape allegations to immediate investigation. Hsieh also helped pass an amendment regarding compensation to crime victims. Believing that smaller constituencies would prevent elected officials from accurately reflecting \\"mainstream public opinion\\", she opposed a 1998 proposal on electoral district reform. The change from multi-member electoral districts to single-member districts coupled with party-list representation eventually occurred in 2008. Hsieh was a strong advocate for women's rights, and staunchly against the death penalty. By her third term, Hsieh was routinely listed by TVBS Weekly Magazine, the Vision Information Internet Association, and the Social Lawmaking League as one of the best legislators. Yet, in April 2001 the Taiwan Association of University Professors listed Hsieh one of the thirteen worst legislators. During the 2000 presidential election, she led an investigation of James Soong's finances in support of his candidacy. Shortly after the election, First Lady of the Republic of China Tseng Wen-hui sued Hsieh, Elmer Fung, and Tai Chi for defamation. The three were cleared of charges, but fined upon appeal to the Taiwan High Court. Hsieh refused to pay the fine and was sentenced to three months imprisonment. In her third term, Hsieh opposed the continued operation of the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant and criticized the Republic of China Navy for excessive spending. She worked to implement a ban on the selling of life insurance to children under fourteen years of age out of concern that parents could be motivated to kill their children and subsequently file claims. By February 2001, Hsieh had become the New Party caucus leader. In June, Hsieh aided a woman who accused Chen Chao-chuan of raping her. She ran again in the December 2001 legislative election, but lost. Following the electoral defeat, Hsieh resigned her position as New Party caucus leader on 8 December 2001. Before she left office, Hsieh played a large part in the 2002 passage of the Gender Equality Employment Law. Shortly after stepping down from the Legislative Yuan, Hsieh moved to China to teach and run a coffee shop. Upon her return to Taiwan in December 2003, Hsieh served a three-month jail sentence for incidents of defamation that had occurred in 2000 involving Tseng Wen-hui. In 2010, she criticized Ma Ying-jeou's selection of Rai Hau-min as President of the Judicial Yuan. In July 2013, she began working in the Taipei City Government, and resigned from her duties in May 2014.

From 1830 the house was extended to a Palais, a stately home, by the Rothschild family. From 1832 the surrounding property was developed as a park in the style of an English landscape garden.

Returning to Seattle in 1997, he connected with Egg Studios owner Conrad Uno, who enlisted Johnny’s engineering assistance. After recording 4 albums with The Model Rockets, John Ramberg had begun work on a solo album with drummer Bill Rieflin (R.E.M., Ministry, The Minus 5). In 2006, those sessions, with the contribution of the Sangster brothers, evolved into the formation of the group The Tripwires.  Releases  The first The Tripwires album Makes You Look Around was released in 2007 on the Paisley Pop label and featured support from Scott McCaughey and technical help from Kurt Bloch. Reviewers praised the album, calling it melodic but powerful pop, bright and propulsive, filled with melodic hooks. A second album, House to House, was released in 2009 on the Spark & Shine label, featuring production by Johnny Sangster and engineering by Sangster and Jon Erwie. The album was described in reviews as explosive power pop. In 2014, a third album Get Young was released, this time on the Folc Records label.

In March, it was reported that Hamlett was not grayshirting as originally planned and was instead walking-on in 2010 and going on scholarship after the season. However, in August 2010, it was reported he had been given a scholarship. Hamlett's brother, Casey, played football at Western Washington from 2007 to 2008 and at Washington State from 2009 to 2010.

Professional career In a January 2015 story with The Herald, it was reported that Hamlett was retiring from football due to knee problems.

Lance Zierlein of NFL.com projected that he would go undrafted and be a priority free agent.

Plot The film tells the story of the romantic relationship between the heir to the Russian throne, Nikolay Romanov, and the ballerina of the Imperial Theater, Matilda Kshesinskaya, from the time the 22-year-old crown prince and 17-year-old dancer met in 1890 to the coronation of Nikolay and his wife Aleksandra Fedorovna in 1896. Cast Reception The film received mixed reviews in Russian media. Yury Grymov and Stas Tyrkin from Komsomolskaya Pravda differed in their opinions; Grymow criticized the film, citing the muddled nature of the picture, while Tyrkin gave a positive review. Egor Belikov from Time Out and Andrey Piskov from The Hollywood Reporter described the film as an overblown melodrama. Meduzas Anton Dolin praised the film; he complimented the fairy-tale like atmosphere, cinematography, sets and costumes.  Controversy  In 2016 when the official trailer of the film which contained in particular erotic love scenes was released, representatives of the public movement \\"King's Cross\\" found in the upcoming film a \\"distortion of historical events\\", and an \\"anti-Russian and anti-religious provocation in the field of culture\\". One cinema chain pulled out of showing the film after a group of self-described Orthodox militants threatened the film’s director and cinemas preparing to screen it. After a request to the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation from the Duma deputy Natalia Poklonskaya known for her veneration of Nicholas II, the film's material was audited and no violations were found. The Chairman of the Duma Committee on Culture, film director Stanislav Govoruhin, criticized the idea of checking the film, he expressed confidence that such scandalous initiatives should be \\"nipped right in the bud.\\" In the Kremlin, Poklonskaya’s request caused confusion and an uncertain delayed response. The Ministry of Culture said that the question of issuing certificates for rental of the film will be decided upon the completion of work on the picture. Somewhat later in December 2016 it was reported that the prosecutor's office will request the movie's script for inspection at the request of deputy Poklonskaya. In September 2017 Cinema Park and Formula Kino group, the Russia's biggest cinema chain, cancelled screenings of the film due to \\"extreme actions by opponents of the film\\" and threats made against cinemas. They later reversed the decision. Two cars were torched outside the Moscow office of a lawyer acting for Alexey Uchitel, the director of the film. On 4 September an ultra-Orthodox participant in monarchist rally against the film rammed the entrance to the Cosmos cinema, the largest in Yekaterinburg, with his car. In the car there was a barrel of gasoline and gas cylinders. The criminal set fire to the car with a Molotov cocktail and tried to escape, but was soon detained. The court released him from criminal liability because it recognized him insane. For the same reason, the owners of the cinema did not receive compensation for the damage caused (19.3 million rubles in their estimation). =Attempts of a ban= Director of the office of the Russian Imperial House, Aleksandr Zakatov called the film \\"blasphemy\\", but added that \\"such works should be condemned, but to inflate a scandal around them and make a formal ban does not make sense\\". A similar position was taken by the Bishop of Egoryevsk Tihon (Shevkunov), who reviewed the film highly critically, but said that the demand to ban the film - \\"is an absolutely dead-end and wrong approach\\": Nevertheless, Bishop Tihon pointed out, \\"most likely, individuals and groups, including Orthodox, will demand its prohibition\\". Production More than 17 tons of fabric were used to create a total of more than 5,000 costumes.

Mostafa's son occupied the chair in the row behind Bappi and pulled Bappi's hair from the back. Bappi scolded the boy for his behavior and told him not to sit on the row behind him anymore. Mostafa's sons (who were close friends of Sheikh Kamal) and some associates forcefully abducted Dalim, Nimmi, the groom's mother, and two of Dalim's friends (both of whom were distinguished freedom fighters) in Microbuses owned by the Red Crescent. Mostafa was taking them to the Rakhi Bahini headquarters but later took them to the residence of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Mujib mediated a compromise between them and made Mostafa apologize to Nimmi.

Early years Gilbert was born in Pennsylvania and was raised in Warren, Ohio. By the time she was 10, she and her family lived in Superior, Wisconsin, where her father ran a music store. Her father gave her a cello when she was 10, and \\"By the time she was 15, she was known in the northwest as a cello prodigy.\\" Her talent with that instrument earned her a scholarship to the Curtis Institute of Music and an opportunity to play at the Hollywood Bowl. Film Gilbert was described in a May 22, 1939, syndicated newspaper column as \\"The only studio musician who ever became an actress.\\" Writer Paul Harrison explained that Gilbert had been playing cello in the Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer orchestra for two years when test director Fred M. Wilcox saw her \\"and asked why she was behind the camera instead of in front of it.\\" (Two other newspaper articles, published August 6, 1939, and April 21, 1939, contained similar anecdotes, but in them W. S. Van Dyke was the director who noticed Gilbert playing cello. A fourth article, published February 18, 1940, says that film executive Winfield Sheehan \\"was impressed by her beauty, gave her a screen test and started her on her way to pictures.\\") Gilbert's film debut came in Andy Hardy Gets Spring Fever (1939). when she played Andy Hardy's dramatics teacher. That same year, she was featured as a patient who had trouble with her vision in The Secret of Dr. Kildare (1939). Gilbert's romantic proclivities may have cost her a role in The Wizard of Oz (1939). Eila Mell wrote in the book Casting Might-Have-Beens: A Film by Film Directory of Actors Considered for Roles Given to Others: \\"Helen Gilbert was the first choice to play Glinda the Good Witch. The actress was interested and it seemed the deal would be made. After she ran off with Howard Hughes, the role was up for grabs.\\" Her activities with Hughes may have cost Gilbert more than that one film role. An article by Lou Lumenick on the website of the New York Post quotes from David J. Hogan’s book, The Wizard of Oz FAQ: “Shortly after a young MGM contract player named Helen Gilbert was cast as Glinda, the inveterate girl-chaser Howard Hughes spirited her away for a fling … Gilbert was suspended, and the studio, which had been building her as a leading lady, allowed her contract to lapse after 1940.” Personal life Gilbert's first husband was orchestra leader Mischa Bakaleinikoff. They divorced November 18, 1939. On December 8, 1942, she was divorced by Seymour J. Chotiner, an attorney in Hollywood, California. They had been married five months. On February 19, 1949, she married Johnny Stompanato. They divorced in July 1949. Her sixth husband was Nevada casino manager James E. Durant. They married on September 28, 1949, in Las Vegas, Nevada. In June 1952, she went to court, asking for monthly alimony and a restraining order against Durant, alleging that he attempted to throw her out of an 11th floor window. Durant, meanwhile, claimed that the couple had been divorced already. Gilbert maintained that the decree in Arizona was invalid, but she dropped her suit after marrying M.O. Bryant, who was \\"associated with her in a Hollywood cafe.\\" She was also married to actor Bill Marshall and restaurateur Victor Makzoume. Death Gilbert died of cardiac arrest in Los Angeles on October 23, 1995, at age 80. Her body was cremated, and her ashes were scattered at sea.

Life Memorial to James Cook and family in St Andrew the Great, Cambridge Elizabeth Batts was the daughter of Samuel Batts who was keeper of the Bell Inn at Execution Dock, Wapping. Samuel Batts was one of Cook's mentors. She married James Cook at St Margaret's Church, Barking, Essex on 21 December 1762. Cook (1728 – 1779) was then a master in the Royal Navy but had not yet held his first independent command. The couple had six children: James (1763–94), Nathaniel (1764–80, lost aboard which foundered with all hands in a hurricane in the West Indies), Elizabeth (1767–71), Joseph (1768–68), George (1772–72) and Hugh (1776–93), the last of whom died of scarlet fever while a student at Christ's College, Cambridge. When not at sea, Cook lived in the East End of London and the family attended St Paul's Church, Shadwell, where their son James was baptised. After her husband was killed at Kealakekua Bay, Hawaii in 1779, Elizabeth Cook received an annual pension of 200 pounds from the Admiralty. In 1788, she moved to Clapham, Surrey. Outliving her husband and all six children, she died at Clapham on 13 May 1835 at the age of 93. Elizabeth Cook is buried in the central aisle of St Andrew the Great Church, Cambridge with her sons, James and Hugh. She left a bequest to pay the minister, support five poor aged women of the parish and to maintain the family's monument. The 'Charity of Mrs Elizabeth Cook' is still registered. Cook has no known direct descendants; all her recorded children predeceased her and died without issue.

The fourteenth named storm, sixth hurricane and third major hurricane of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, Nicole formed in the central Atlantic on October 4\\\\. The small, slow-moving storm defied forecasts by steadily organizing in spite of strong wind shear, and it rapidly intensified to a Category 2 hurricane on October 7\\\\. The wind shear finally took its toll by October 8, reducing Nicole to a minimal tropical storm, as a building high pressure system forced the storm southwards. Intensification began once again as the storm retreated towards Bermuda, and Nicole reached its peak intensity early on October 13 as a Category 4 hurricane with 140 mph (220 km/h) winds. Shortly thereafter, increased vertical wind shear weakened the storm to Category 3 status, and the eye of the storm passed over Bermuda later that day. Afterwards, Nicole accelerated northeastwards while gradually weakening, but significantly expanding in size as it traversed the Northern Atlantic. By October 18, decreasing sea surface temperatures caused the large hurricane to become extratropical as it accelerated northwards towards Greenland. The storm's approach and eventually impact to Bermuda forced schools, businesses, and government offices to close, while flight, bus, and ferry services were interrupted. One person drowned due to large swells that Nicole generated along its track that washed ashore along the East Coast of the United States. On the island of Bermuda, several people were injured, but no life-threatening injuries were reported. Overall, damage from Nicole amounted up to $15 million, which was less than what was anticipated. Meteorological history On October 1, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a weak tropical wave-induced low-pressure area producing scattered showers and thunderstorms, along with winds just shy of tropical storm intensity, over the central Atlantic. Strong wind shear prevented the disturbance from organizing significantly as it tracked northwestward for the next several days. On October 4, satellite data confirmed the presence of a well-defined circulation center with gale-force winds. Around the same time, thunderstorm activity became better organized and banding features began to evolve over the eastern side of the disturbance. As a result, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Storm Nicole at 15:00 UTC, while it was located about northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The storm, still plagued by inhibiting wind shear, was forecast to remain weak. Nicole's cloud pattern gradually improved on October 5, partially shielded from the effects of wind shear by an upper-level low situated atop the tropical storm. Although convection remained lopsided, a distinct mid-level eye feature developed within the unusually small cyclone. The storm continued moving generally northwestward around a subtropical ridge to its north. Nicole gradually intensified as it became more symmetrical in appearance, and at 18:00 UTC on October 6, it was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane about south of Bermuda. A period of rapid intensification brought Nicole to its initial peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane early on October 7, with sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 968 mbar (28.59 inHg). At the same time, a pinhole eye became evident on satellite imagery. Considering the strong shear produced by outflow from powerful Hurricane Matthew to Nicole's southwest, the NHC described this strengthening trend as \\"unexpected\\". An approaching trough eroded the ridge to the north, leaving the hurricane in an area of very weak steering currents; consequently, its forward movement slowed to nearly stationary. Nicole shortly before attaining hurricane status on October 6 By early on October 7, Nicole had finally felt the effects of strong wind shear and quickly weakened back into a tropical storm. A new blocking high pressure area began forming to the north, driving Nicole slowly toward the south as the storm's convective pattern continued to deteriorate. On the morning of October 8, the storm's center was displaced far to the north of the waning deep convection, and Nicole further declined to a minimal tropical storm. However, later that day, unusually warm sea surface temperatures enabled a \\"tremendous burst of deep convection\\" close to the center, and Nicole began to reintensify. That the storm was able to survive in spite of as much as 50 mph (85 km/h) of northerly shear proved \\"puzzling\\" to forecasters. Convection oscillated in coverage and intensity throughout the day on October 9; bursts of deep convection, which at one point coalesced into a burgeoning central dense overcast, repeatedly subsided to leave the center exposed. As steering currents slackened, Nicole slowed to a drift before the retreating ridge of high pressure allowed the storm to resume a northward course. By the morning of October 10, thunderstorms associated with the tropical storm had \\"faded away into a shallow and shapeless cloud mass\\", according to one NHC forecaster. The storm remained disorganized for the next day or so, until several bands of convection began to wrap around a ragged eye feature in response to abating wind shear. Nicole reattained Category 1 hurricane intensity at 18:00 UTC on October 11, and its satellite appearance continued to improve. After meandering westward for a time, the hurricane turned north and soon accelerated toward the northeast as it recurved into the mid-latitude westerlies. While nearing Bermuda, Nicole exhibited a highly symmetrical cloud pattern centered around a large and well-defined eye. The storm underwent another period of rapid intensification, and early on October 13, reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 950 mbar (28.05 inHg). Shortly thereafter, however, increased vertical wind shear caused Nicole to weaken to a Category 3 hurricane. Between 14:00 and 15:00 UTC, the western part of the eye of Nicole passed over Bermuda, marking a direct hit, although the exact center of the eye remained just to the east. While passing the islands, the storm's inner core lost some of its structure, and the eye as viewed from radar was tilted to the southwest of the central clearing displayed on satellite. At 09:00 UTC on October 14, southwesterly wind shear reduced the system to Category 1 status, although swells from Nicole affected Bermuda and portions of the U.S. east coast and Atlantic Canada. This strengthening was due to Nicole undergoing a warm seclusion, where a cyclone's warm core is isolated from surrounding cold air, allowing it to intensify. Shortly after, Nicole slowed tremendously, as it became stationed south of a high pressure system. Its wind field started to expand drastically, and Nicole finally transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 18, ending its nearly 2-week journey across the Atlantic basin. Preparations and impact =Bermuda= Rainbow infrared satellite loop of Nicole making its closest approach to Bermuda October 13 On October 10, while the storm was still located about to the south, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for the islands of Bermuda. A concurrent tropical storm warning was posted early the next morning, and both advisories were replaced with a hurricane warning when Nicole reintensified into a hurricane. Residents boarded up their homes and businesses and placed sandbags to minimize the effects of flooding. Small boats were removed from marinas for safe storage, while larger vessels that remained in the water were tightly secured. Schools and government offices closed for the duration of the storm, while ferry and bus services were suspended on October 12\\\\. Additionally, commercial flights to and from L.F. Wade International Airport were canceled. The threat of the storm prompted three cruise liners to cancel their scheduled stops at Bermuda. As a precaution, officials closed the Causeway late on October 12. Some 140 Royal Bermuda Regiment soldiers were deployed at strategic points, ready to assist in the aftermath of the storm. At the Cedarbridge Academy, a government shelter was opened with cots and emergency supplies for storm victims. Bermuda's only daily newspaper, The Royal Gazette, did not go to print on October 13. With adverse weather conditions expected to impact a crucial NASA rocket tracking site in Bermuda, the launch of an International Space Station resupply spacecraft from Virginia's Wallops Flight Facility was postponed. The mission had already been delayed, in part due to the threat of Hurricane Matthew. Strong swells from the slow-moving storm started affecting Bermuda on October 6. Later, on October 11, gusty winds along the periphery of Nicole's circulation caused a brief power outage. As the core of the hurricane passed over Bermuda, a weather station on Pearl Island recorded sustained winds of 87 mph (141 km/h) with gusts to 119 mph (191 km/h). An elevated station at Commissioner's Point recorded slightly higher winds. Nicole also dropped extremely heavy rainfall, amounting to . upwelled cooler waters below the surface, leaving behind a cold wake along its path. The strong winds brought down trees and powerlines, leaving 27,341 households—approximately 90% of all electric customers in the territory—without service. Service was predominately restored within a few days, though isolated outages reappeared well after the storm's passage, when salt deposits began disrupting the electric power distribution system. The terminal building at L.F. Wade International Airport was partially unroofed, and rainwater leaks were reported throughout the facility. Agriculture took a significant hit, as the storm destroyed fields of fruit and vegetable crops in various stages of growth. At least one farmer reported a nearly total loss of young vegetable plants. Dozens of boats, some up to in length, were ripped from their moorings and left damaged, sunken, or crushed upon rocky sections of coastline. Low-lying roadways and buildings were flooded, and some homes sustained roof damage, but the hurricane proved less destructive than initially feared. No fatalities or serious injuries were reported, although seven individuals were hospitalized with minor weather-related injuries. An unusually high number of blackpoll warblers were spotted in Bermuda after Hurricane Nicole disrupted their transoceanic migration, forcing them to seek shelter. Insured loss were counted at $15 million. =U.S. East Coast= Although only Bermuda was directly affected by the hurricane, Nicole's large size stirred a tremendous area of high seas. Long-period swells propagated across the entire North Atlantic for a prolonged period. One surfer went missing in Puerto Rico in relation to these swells. Along the Florida coastline, hundreds of baby sea turtles were washed back ashore; roughly 500 were rescued by the Volusia Marine Science Center, and 75 by the Brevard Zoo. In South Florida, the swells combined with the annual king tide, resulting in significant coastal flooding. Water levels in Virginia Key and Miami rose above forecast levels. Coastal roads in Ft. Lauderdale became submerged with waves rolling into streets. In Rodanthe, North Carolina, a large breaking wave pulled two teenagers out to sea; one managed to swim to shore safely while the other drowned. The United States Coast Guard assisted in search and rescue for nearly two days before the boy's body washed ashore. Between 20 and 30 other people required rescue from rip currents in the area.

She was the first woman to compete in motorcycle road racing and motocross events in the United States. Starting out as a sports car racer, she competed in motorcycle road racing and motocross from 1960 to 1976, then began competition again in 2000 in vintage motocross events. In 2013, McGee was named an FIM Legend for her pioneering motorcycle racing career. She was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2018.  Early life  McGee was born in Juneau, Alaska on December 12, 1936. She then moved to Iowa to live with her grandparents during World War II as Alaska was considered to be at risk of a Japanese invasion. In 1944 the family settled in Phoenix, Arizona. Eventually she met her husband, Don McGee, who was a mechanic who had worked on the east coast. Shortly after their 1956 wedding Don introduced her to racing cars which eventually led to racing motorcycles. While a tall 5’11”, Mary always described herself as \\"fast on my feet, fast with my brain, self- conscious and lacking confidence\\", however she had \\"no trouble with confidence on the race track\\".Liz Jansen, Trailblazer, Motorcycle Mojo, April 1, 2013 retrieved 4 Nov 2016  Sports car racing  McGee raced a variety of cars, including the 550 Porsche Spyder McGee began racing sports cars with the Sports Car Club of America in December 1957, driving a Mercedes 300SL owned by George Rice of Phoenix Arizona. She consistently won her races, which earned her media attention. A January 1962 article in Motor Trend started with \\"Housewives revolt!\\" and ended with \\"so ladies if you are bored with freeway traffic, don’t give up. Buy a motorcycle and join Mary McGee.\\" She continued racing sports cars until the summer of 1964. McGee raced a variety of cars including: * AC Bristol * Ferrari Berlinetta * Elva Mark IV * Corvette * Jaguar * Lotus 18 * Porsche Spyder * Ferrari Testarossa Some of the tracks McGee raced on include: * Riverside International Raceway, CA * Hour Glass Field, CA * Phoenix, AZ * Tucson, AZ * Santa Barbara, CA * Palm Springs, CA * Del Mar, CA * Pomona, CA * El Paso, TX * Oakland, CA * Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles, CA * Cotati, CA * Miramar, CA * Mildland, TX * Collidge, AZ * Chandler, AZ * Stockton, CA * Vacaville, CA * Salt Lake City, UT * Reno, NV * Hillclimb, Jerome, AZ While McGee raced with the California Sports Car Club (Cal Club) and the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), she placed: * 1958 3rd over 1600cc class (Cal Club) * 1959 3rd under 1600cc class (Cal Club) * 1960 2nd E Modified class (Cal Club) * 1961 1st over 1500cc Modified class (SCCA) * 1962 2nd over 1500cc Modified class (SCCA) * 1963 2nd in Pacific Coast Championship * 1964 2nd in Pacific Coast Championship  Motorcycle road racing  McGee learned to ride on a Triumph Tiger Cub in 1957. Pictured here is the 1960 version McGee bought her first motorcycle in 1957, when a friend needed to sell a 200cc 1956 Triumph Tiger Cub. She knew nothing about motorcycles at that time but was willing to learn and ended up falling in love with the sport. The Tiger Cub didn't always start, so she traded it for a Honda C110 that she used to commute to her job as a parts manager at Flint British Motors. In 1960, while she was racing a Porsche Spyder in Santa Barbara, California, the car's owner, Czech race-car icon Vasek Polak, suggested to McGee's husband that she should ride a motorcycle to improve her car-racing skills. When he told her, McGee responded with, \\"Okay. Why not?\\"Larry Lawrence, Mary in Motion, Cycle News, May 19, 2013, Retrieved Nov 4, 2016 A female road racer in the United States was a new phenomenon. McGee was already known to be an expert car racer, but the American Federation of Motorcyclists (AFM) wanted to be sure she could also perform on two wheels, so they told her she'd first have to attend a try-out. She passed the audition and became the first woman to road race and hold a FIM license in the United States – on a 125 Honda CB92 wearing her pink polka-dot helmet. She raced motorcycles from 1960 to 1963. Wes Cooley Sr. was President of AFM during this time. In 1962 Mary had earned enough points in all classes to run the #20 AFM number plate on her bike in 1963. Mary stopped road racing motorcycles in the fall of 1963 when there were coming rule changes for women even though at that point she was the only woman racing; however, these rules did not end up going into effect. Some of the tracks that McGee raced on include: * Riverside International Raceway, CA * San Luis Obispo, CA * Stockton, CA (old port and empty warehouses) * Las Vegas, NV (city streets where the Convention Centre now stands) * Hanford, CA (only banked track) * Willows Spring, CA (Including the US MC/FIM sanctioned GP Race in 1961. Mike Hailwood and Paddy Driver (UK) also raced.) * Laguna Seca Raceway, CA (1962 – Was the first time motorcycles were allowed) * Santa Barbara, CA * Santa Rosa, CA * Vacaville, CA * Reno, NV (At registration, Mary was told she was not allowed to race a motorcycle or a car because no woman had ever raced there before)  Dirt bike racing  McGee rode the Baja 500 solo in 1975 In 1963 at a New Year's Eve party attended by Hollywood stars who raced both cars and motorcycles, McGee's friend actor Steve McQueen told her \\"McGee, you’ve got to get off that pansy road-racing bike and come out to the desert.\\"Abeal, Marcelo, Steve McQueen: The race of his life. Editorial Dunken, Apr 10, 2015, p.251 Car racer and stunt man Bobby Harris was McGee's mentor. Her rite of passage came several months later in 1963 when Harris and other celebrity racers convinced her to enter a desert race, an AMA District 37 Enduro in Jawbone Canyon, California. McGee rode with Bob Drake, Bobby Harris & Al Tinker. The men all rode 650cc Triumphs while Mary rode a 1962 CL72 250cc Honda Scrambler. The men promised McGee that the event would be easy, but she recalls it being anything but as she was exhausted and cold in the snow that fell. In 1966 McGee purchased a 250cc CZ and raced it through 1967 when she started racing Husqvarna motorcycles. In 1967 Mary started desert racing in Baja California events. McGee's career highlight racing bikes in Baja was in 1975, when she rode a 250 Husqvarna solo in the Baja 500, passing 17 two-man teams. McGee says that the hardest thing she ever did was Baja. \\"It was very barren, no electricity, no doctors, no phone. I carried Percodan in case of injury because you’d have to ride injured to get to someplace where someone has a car to get to Ensenada or La Paz to a clinic or back to the States. Luckily, I never had to use the Percodan, but I did come off the bike several times.\\"\\"Women & Motorcycling: Mary McGee – WCM2020\\". wcm2020.org. Retrieved 4 Nov, 2016 McGee ended her motocross and long distance dirt racing around 1976 for several years. In 2000 after moving to Northern Nevada and meeting old motorcycle friends, she bought a 1974 250cc Husqvarna and started entering the women's class in vintage motocross events. McGee started off in the over 60 class then moved on to the over 70 class a few years later.  Personal life  In 1956 Mary married Don McGee. (Divorced) In 1964 McGee's brother died in a car race in Vacaville, California. In that same year, McGee was also involved in a serious auto accident in New York. In 1965 Mary McGee gave birth to her son Chris McGee. She currently lives near Carson City, Nevada and has a son and a granddaughter.

From 2012, the Pelican Lagoon Sanctuary Zone has fallen within the Encounter Marine Park. Pelican Lagoon is probably the oldest marine protected area in South Australia, having been protected since 1914. It was classified as an IUCN Category II protected area. On 20 October 2016, the reserve was abolished. History and description American River Aquatic Reserve, also called the Pelican Lagoon Aquatic Reserve in some sources, was declared on 30 November 1971 under the Fisheries Act 1971 and was re- proclaimed in 2007 following the enactment of the Fisheries Management Act 2007. In 1987, it was reported as being the oldest operating aquatic reserve created under fisheries legislation in South Australia. From 2012, it was located within the boundaries of a “sanctuary zone” within the Encounter Marine Park. The aquatic reserve was classified as an IUCN Category II protected area. On 20 October 2016, the reserve was abolished. Description The purpose of the aquatic reserve was to \\"protect seagrass mudflats and to provide a sanctuary for juvenile and adult fish, including whiting\\". This was achieved by the prohibition of both fishing and the collection of marine organisms within its waters. Access was permitted and activities such as birdwatching, boating, swimming and recreational diving (i.e. snorkelling and scuba diving) were also permitted. The aquatic reserve covered the full extent of the lagoon up including part of the inlet stopping at a line running from Picnic Point across to the adjoining shore just south of the American River township.

Its former building on Colquitt Street, a Classical Revival-style building constructed in 1923, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998 as Bossier High School (Colquitt Street). Its current location on Bearkat Drive, with its International Style architecture, also was listed on the National Register, in 2004. History Bossier High School was officially recognized as an accredited educational institution by the Louisiana Department of Education in 1917. The first school was located on Traffic Street in North Bossier, the present site of Bossier Elementary School. In 1923 a new high school was built to serve the city's rapidly expanding population, and this was expanded in 1928, but still was inadequate. In 1938 a new location was chosen on the historic site of Fort Kirby Smith, a Civil War Fort. Fort Kirby Smith was one of several defensive positions pieced together by the Confederate Army during the American Civil War (1861-1865) to protect Shreveport during the Red River Campaign. According to Gary Joiner's Through the Howling Wilderness: The 1864 Red River Campaign and Union Failure in the West, it was located to prevent an attack from the north, the east, as well as the southeast from Union aggression.[Joiner, Gary D. Through the Howling Wilderness: The 1864 Red River Campaign and Union Failure in the West, University of Tennessee Press, Knoxville, 2006.] After the surrender of Shreveport in 1865, Fort Kirby Smith was dismantled and abandoned. The present Bossier High School, a three-story building located at 777 Bearcat Drive, was built in 1938-39. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

Although her accomplishments for the most part went unrecognized, Bolin, who was the first player signed to play in the WBL, became a pioneering figure in women's basketball, both as a formidable scoring threat and as a sex symbol of the league. Among her accolades, Bolin holds the record for the most points scored in a single game by any professional women's basketball player (55) and the highest single-season scoring average (32.8). Biography Bolin was born in Dryden, Ontario, but was raised in Moravia, Iowa, where she first began playing basketball for Moravia High School's Mohawks during her junior year. In unconventional six-player half-court gameplay, Bolin averaged 50 points in her first year and 54.8 points in her senior year, while setting the school's single-game record for most points by one player (83). Among other early accolades, Bolin was selected to participate in tryouts for 1976 Summer Olympics' women's basketball team at 17 years-old and was voted an All-American in her senior year. In 1975, Bolin began attending Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa where she had to adjust to the conventional five-player style of play with the Vikings basketball team. As she recollected, \\"College wasn't the same experience as high school and I had to learn the five-on-five full-court game pretty quickly. In fact, right out of high school in 1975, I got recruited to tryout for the '75 Pan American team and I couldn't even dribble full-court and make a basket\\". Instead of playing her sophomore year, Bolin decided to sit out to marry Dennis Bolin and give birth to the couple's child, Damien, in 1977. When Bolin returned to the court in 1978, she set university scoring records, averaging 24.6 PPG, and graduated with an associate's degree in telecommunications. After her second year of eligibility, Bolin became the first player to sign to the newly-formed Women's Professional Basketball League, when she signed a one-year contract with the Iowa Cornets for $6,000. Honing in on her appearance as a blonde bombshell, Bolin was situated as the sex symbol of the league, appearing in several photo shoots, features in Sports Illustrated and SportsWorld, and commercials with NBA players such as Larry Bird. Nicknamed \\"Machine Gun\\" by a columnist of the Washington Post for her prolific scoring ability, Bolin averaged 16.7 PPG, and helped advance the Cornets to the championship finals before they were defeated by the Houston Angels. During the 1979-80 season, Bolin set 12 WBL records, including most points scored in a single game (55) and the highest single-season scoring average (32.8), and was named co-MVP alongside Ann Meyers. Both of Bolin's scoring marks have yet to be matched by any professional women's basketball player. Despite posting a 36-point game, the Cornets were beaten again in the finals, this time losing to the New York Stars.Bradley, Robert. \\"HISTORY OF THE WOMEN'S PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL LEAGUE\\", Association for Professional Basketball Research. Accessed October 8, 2016. With the WBL financially struggling, long road-trips, and low pay, Bolin agreed to join the Ladies Professional Basketball Association, a Southwestern-based league that was established to compete with the faltering WBL. However, after just seven games with the Southern California Breeze, the LPBA disbanded, and Bolin—a high-list free agent sought after by all the eight remaining WBL teams—negotiated a contract with the San Francisco Pioneers, whose coach, former NBA player Dean Meminger, was a crucial selling point for Bolin. Under Meminger's mentorship, she finished the 1980-1981 season second in the league in scoring (26.8) and competed in her third All-Star game. The WBL's third season proved to be its last for the league was forced to dissolve under severe financial hardship. After the WBL folded, Bolin was engaged in a custody battle with her recently divorced husband over their son, Damien. Initially, the court awarded her ex- spouse full custody, arguing that Bolin's profession and her glamour shoots made her an unfit parent; however, the decision was appealed and overturned in 1983. In 1984, Bolin was selected for a USA All-Star team composed of former olympians and professional players to participate in exhibition games against the 1984 Summer Olympics women's team which eventually won the gold medal. Bolin played her last professional season in the same year, signing with the Columbus Minks of the short-lived Women's American Basketball Association. Even though Bolin's basketball career was over, she continued to promote the concept of a new women's basketball league, and was hired by Fox Sports in 1995 to create a women's tournament for television. Shortly after Bolin's contributions, the NBA announced its intent to establish the Women's National Basketball Association. Other post-basketball accolades include her induction in the Iowa High School Basketball Hall of Fame in 1986, and the Grandview College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999. Bolin remarried to John Kazmer in 1989, and they currently reside in La Quinta, California with their two children.

New Mexico House of Representatives Cheney was the House Minority Leader while in the New Mexico House of Representatives in the 1990s. As a State Legislator, Cheney's positions included being anti-abortion, pro- gun rights and pro-business.

He chose Pete Rahn as his campaign manager. A campaign ad from the Santa Fe New Mexico newspaper showed that he ran on a platform highlighting cracking down on violent crime, repealing the gasoline tax, and lowering public spending. When Cheney legally changed his first name from Richard to Dick, his polling numbers increased tremendously. This created controversy, as opponents including John Dendahl stated that people voting in the polls would confuse Cheney with the former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney from Wyoming, improving his chances of winning the primary. He received 49% of the vote at the Republican State Convention in 1994. Cheney lost the primary by one point receiving 33% of the vote right behind Gary Johnson at 34%, who went on to become Governor of the state and later a Presidential candidate.

Solus is a serif typeface that was designed by English sculptor and stonemason Eric Gill for the British Monotype Corporation and released in 1929. Solus has a structure of straight, regular serifs reminiscent of slab-serif typefaces of the nineteenth century, but with a reduced build giving an impression of crispness. Along with these characteristics, Solus bears the distinct personality of Gill's characteristic preferences in letterforms, such as the pointed end to the top left of the letter 'a'. James Mosley describes Solus as \\"essentially a mechanistic type — a ‘light Egyptian’\\", a conclusion also reached by editor Robert Harling in his book on Gill's work. Solus was not particularly popular during the metal type period, which Harling suggests was because it was too similar to Gill's pre- existing Perpetua, not having an italic and having little appeal in display use, unlike more aggressive slab serif designs. Gill's Joanna, designed some years later in a similar style but with an italic, has become much more popular. Solus has not been digitised by Monotype; an unofficial revival has been made by the company K-Type. Financier, by Kris Sowersby, is a respected revival loosely influenced by Solus, Perpetua and Joanna.

It has an area of and more than 10,000 types of trees and many plant collections. Callus cultures of Agave amaniensis by Setia Dewi were taken in 1988. History The garden was established on January 30, 1941 by Dr. Gerhard Lourens Baas Becking Marinus from the initiative of Dr. Dirk Fok van Slooten as a division of Bogor Botanical Gardens. This garden is one of the three branches of the Botanic Gardens of Indonesia, with each having specific tasks and functions. The two other branches are Cibodas Botanical Garden and Bali Botanic Garden. Management of the entire botanical garden branch is under the responsibility of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences. Initially, the gardens were used for plantation crop research activities. Then in 1954 the basics of a botanic garden began to be applied, with the establishment of patches of plant collections. From 1980 most of the plants were reorganized according to the Engler classification system. Purwodadi is a major centre of research on plant conservation and plants of dry climates in the tropics. Collections =Legumes= The legume collection is classified into three parts: Mimosaceae, Caesalpiniaceae, and Papilionaceae. There are 70 genera included in these groups. Various types of legumes are used as ornamental plants such as species from the genera Amherstia, Brownea, Cassia, Senna, and Saraca. In addition, some types of wood are also used for buildings such as rosewood (Dalbergia latifolia) and Wangkal (Albizia procera), and roadside greening plants such as Angsana (Pterocarpus indicus), Acacia (Acacia auriculiformis) and Soga (Peltophorum pterocarpum). Some are used as medicinal plants such as Johar (Senna siamea), kedawung (Parkia timoriana), and Dadap srep (Erythrina subumbrans). =Orchids= Purwodadi's orchids are kept in greenhouse conditions adjusted to their natural habitat. There are about 2,344 specimens of wild orchids which consist of 319 species and 69 genera. About 7 species are endemic to East Java such as Appendicula imbricata, Arcuatum dendrobium and Paphiopedilum glaucophyllum. Among others are endangered species such as Ascocentrum miniatum, Phalaenopsis amabilis, Coelogyne pandurata from Kalimantan and others. =Palms= The Purwodadi collection of palms contains some 60 genera, 117 species and 435 individuals. =Bamboo= About 30 species of bamboo have been collected by Purwodadi, 16 species from Java, two from Maluku, two from Sulawesi, and 10 from several Asian countries (China, Japan, Thailand, India, and Burma). Gigantochloa manggong (manggong bamboo) is an endemic bamboo of East Java; Gigantochloa lear (pring lear) is often used for furniture, crafts or roofs; Dendrocalamus asper (pring petung) is used for its edible shoots, and Schizostachyum silicatum (bamboo wuluh) to make flutes. =Ferns= The fern collection lies beneath a patch of larger trees and is shady, as these plants grow best in shade and damp. The collection comprises 36 genera and 21 species. Among these are the spikes bird's nest (Asplenium nidus), maidenhair fern (Adiantum spp.), Lygodium circinnatum, and Platycerium coronarium. Some of the species contain useful properties, for example Athyrium esculentum has edible shoots, Asplenium sp. and Adiantum sp. are used as ornamental plants, horsetail Equisetum debile is used as a medical treatment, and Lygodium circinnatum for craft materials. =Medicinal plants= The medicinal plant collection includes species such as Morinda citrifolia, a fruit used for cough medicine and high blood pressure, purple leaf (Graptophyllum pictum), of which the leaves are used to cure hemorrhoids, Widoro upas (Merremia mammosa), a tuber used to remedy diabetes, Sembung (Blumea balsamifera) from the which leaves are used for asthma and heart disease medications, and Wudani (Quisqualis indica) which leaves are used for de-worming. Tourism and recreation Purwodadi Botanic Garden can be explored by foot, on a rented bicycle, or by private car. Visitors can also utilise a small train. Outside of Purwodadi Garden there are other tourist attractions such as Coban Baung waterfall on the eastern side. A visit to the gardens can be incorporated into an East Java nature weekend. The gardens can be visited on the way up to or back from Mount Bromo. Other mountains in the surrounding area are Mount Arjuno and Mount Kawi, while another attraction close to the gardens is the Wonosari Tea Plantation. Purwodadi Botanic Garden is a place for respite from the hustle and bustle of Surabaya. It can be visited on the way to the town of Malang and also features a cafe serving traditional Javanese cuisine.

It is produced by Arun Gosh and Bijoy Chandran under the banner of Shivani Entertainments and Chand V Creations. Principal photography began in October 2017 in Thrissur.Georgettan's Pooram Movie Review Plot P. V. Mathayyi was a participant in the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing. After India beat Bangladesh, P.V Mathayyi rose to prominence as one of the first Malayalis, from the district of Thrissur to win a gold medal at the Asian Games. When the Games ended, Mathayyi was welcomed back wholeheartedly by the rest of the people in his area. He gifted the youth of the place a ground and a sports club, which the people named Mathayyiparambu. However, the happiness was short-lived, after Mathayyi was killed in a road accident. The people built a statue in his honour in Mathayyiparambu, but soon afterwards, the people forgot the ground's initial use as a sports ground, and the place became a place for the youth to loiter around and play football. Vava, Thankan and Pallan are three boys who loiter around on Mathayyiparambu. Their parents are annoyed and Vava's father (Sunil Sukhada) tells Fr. Mathews Vadakkan (Renji Panicker), a local Mar Thoma priest to set them on the right path and he grants his son George this responsibility. After class one day, the three boys find George peeping through the bathroom, and catch him doing this. After this incident, they say that George is their leader and is one of them. Years later, George (Dileep), Vava (Vinay Forrt), Pallan (Sharaf U Dheen) and Thankan (Thiru Aftab) are still loitering around the ground doing nothing. They have a small gathering on top of a small tower in Mathayyiparambu, where Joseph (T.G Ravi), a local beggar who takes only Rs. 10 from the poor box near Jesus' statue and from Georgettan, welcomes them like his own children. Fr. Vadakkan is disappointed in his son George and wants him to become a bishop. George tries to impress his father by doing various things in the community, but each activity ends in disaster. Later, two people come and ask for the gang's permission of starting a driving school in Mathayyiparambu. Although at first reluctant, they agree immediately when the two explain that it is a ladies' driving school. However, they are disappointed when they see old women in the school. Then they hear the sad news of the death of a local MLA and a funeral is held by his son Simon (Sudheer Karamana). There, George meets Merlin (Rajisha Vijayan), a singer, and instantly falls in love. He is disappointed at the fact that he doesn't know anything about her, not even her name (he didn't find this out). Him and his friends decide to go to their house the next day to find out anything about her, but this ends in disaster. The next day, Vava explains that he has a proposal. George and his friends decide to go with him, but he drops off his brother Jose (Jeevan Gopal) at the local convent school, as their father now wants Jose to become a bishop, much to George's delight. There George plays a game of carroms against Kichu (Ganapathi), places a bet of Rs. 2000 but loses the bet. After, he goes with Vava to the marriage proposal and George takes Rs. 2000 from the girl's dad and gives it to Kichu, angering the dad. He cancels the proposal between the two. George goes and decides to stop the driving school at Mathayyiparambu, as he is disappointed at the fact that there are only old women coming. Right afterwards Merlin comes, and George decides to let the driving school carry on. The driving school teacher tells George that she is going to become a nun which her mother insisted, as she said that she doesn't have the three qualities a girl needs to have: desire, wish and love. George finds her desiring for and eating a nellikka, and tells her that he has proven she has one of the three qualities. George, after joining a class at the convent school, is saved by Merlin after a priest asks him questions. George understands this and tells her that he has proven the second of the three qualities, as she saved him in front of the priest. As they leave the convent school, the gang meet a bunch of youths smoking weed outside. George gets angry over this and starts a fight. As George beats up the last person, his father Fr. Vadakkan slaps him, as Fr. Vadakkan is disappointed even more in him. He goes to Mathayyiparambu, but unexpectedly, his mother Mercykutty (Kalaranjini) comes to visit him. She suggests to George that he should never enter the house. The next day, the locals gather to find some construction on Mathayyiparambu. George and his gang go and find Peter Mathayyi (Chemban Vinod Jose), who explains that he is the son of P.V Mathayyi and that Mathayiparambu is his. They go to Fr. Vadakkan's church and fight the case out there with the priest, where Peter seems to be favored. In retaliation, George and his gang decide to set up a stray dog conservation scheme on Mathayyiparambu, which ends in disaster, ruining George's name in the land. Peter then meets George and attempts to gain George's trust by saying that he is ready to give Mathayyiparambu away and leave it to waste. George is saddened and says that he is ready to accept any of Peter's demands. Peter suggests that they start a kabaddi team, which George accepts.

This rare species of Portulaca is restricted to a few coastal sites on Molokini Island (Maui), Puʻukoaʻe Islet and Kamōhio Bay, Kahoʻolawe. It is known to grow in volcanic tuff, detritus at base of sea cliff and on steep rocky slopes from about 30 to about 375 feet. Portulaca molokiniensis is a rare endemic to the Hawaiian islands where it known to grow in loose volcanic scree on steep slopes and in sand near the seaside on the arid islets of Molokini and Pu'ukoa'e and at Kanhio Bay on Kaho'olawe off the west coast of Maui. Though many think of the Hawaiian islands as lush and moist, the collection sites on these islands are on the leeward, rainshadow side and are extremely dry. Though this plant was first collected by Charles N. Forbes on Molokini in February 1913, it was identified as Portulaca lutea, a plant more widely distributed throughout the Pacific islands. It was collected once again as Portulaca lutea in the 1920s and then not documented again until collections made in the late 1970s and early 1980s where the distinctiveness of the plant was noted and it was officially described as a new species by Hawaii forester Bob Hobdy in 1987.

In between, he held visiting professorships at American Cancer Society, University of Washington, Seattle, Osaka University, University of Sydney and the Medical Research Council, London.  Legacy  Chording mycobacterium tuberculosis culture - luminescent microscope image Focusing his early researches on the molecular basis of homologous genetic recombination and employing RecA paradigm, Muniyappa demonstrated the effects of chromatization of DNA on homologous pairing and strand exchange and his studies are known to have assisted in exploring ways for gene targeting, cell senescence and genome stability. His studies on chromosome synapsis, genetic recombination and telomere dynamics attempted to widen the understanding of cellular recombination and Holliday junction and he is credited with the discovery of a negative regulatory mechanism of homologous recombination. His contributions in deciphering genetic recombination in mycobacterium tuberculosis are also reported to have influenced further researches on the mechanism of genetic exchange and lateral gene transfer. His researches have been published in a number of articles, 136 of which have been listed by ResearchGate, an online article repository. At the Indian Institute of Science, he set up a laboratory, K. Muniyappa's Lab, to pursue researches in the fields of Cancer biology, Genetics, Biochemistry and Biophysics, where he mentors a number of doctoral and post-doctoral research scholars. Under his leadership, IISc introduced new academic programs such as the integrated PhD program, interdisciplinary program in chemical biology, and national post-doctoral training program in Biotechnology and Life Sciences.

Once restored these artefacts could then be returned to Egypt. Caudana worked on many notable documents and textiles and died in Turin in 1974.

Chemistry  Pi4 is a peptide, which consists of 38 amino-acids with the following sequence: IEAIRCGGSRDCYRPCQKRTGCPNAKCINKTCKCYGCS It contains an α-helix and a β-sheet; it is stabilized by four cysteine-pairings that are crosslinked by four short disulfide bridges. The four disulfide bridges are characteristic for the α-KTX6 subfamily, while most other scorpion toxins contain only three disulfide bridges. The cysteines of Pi4 are paired in the following order: 6C–27C; 12C–32C; 16C–34C; 22C–37C. Most disulfide bridges show a left-handed conformation, although in the disulfide bridge between 22C–37C some variation is found. Only the disulfide bridge between 6C–27C shows a right-handed conformation.  Target & Mode of action  Pi4 blocks different potassium channels, for instance, the Shaker B, Kv1.2, and SK potassium channels. = Shaker B channel = Pi4 binds to Shaker B potassium channels, the Drosophila homologue of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1. Pi4 reversibly blocks this channel with an IC50 of 3.0 ± 2.2 nM. A Pi4 peptide, synthesized with a different C-terminus than the natural Pi4 (COO- instead of COH2N), shows the same binding characteristics as natural Pi4. This suggests that the C-terminus of the peptide Pi4 is not involved in the binding of Pi4 to the Shaker B channel. The residues 26K, 28I, 29N, 33K, and 35Y might be important for Pi4's interaction with Shaker B channels, especially 26K and 35Y, which form a conserved dyad of a lysine and aromatic cluster in other potassium channel toxins. It has been suggested that the positive charge of the lysine mimicks a potassium ion and enters the pore of the potassium channel, hence occluding the pore opening and inhibiting the ion flux. = Kv1.2 channel = Pi4 blocks the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.2. at low concentrations (IC50 8.0 ± 5 pM). No significant effects have been observed on Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 channels at concentrations up to 10 μm. In the binding of the peptide Pi4 to the Kv1.2 channel, the β-sheet structure is thought to play an important role. First, the residue 35Y, located in the β-sheet structure, tightly interacts via electrostatic forces with the aromatic cluster of Kv1.2 channels (344W, 345W and 355Y). Second, the residue 26K becomes stabilized by the four carbonyl oxygen atoms located in the channel of pore formed by four Kv1.2 α-subunits (357D). Finally, the four 332Q residues of the four α-subunits of Kv1.2 channels interact via salt bridges with four subunits of the toxin ring (composed of 10R, 19R, 30K, 33K). = SK-channel = Furthermore, the Pi4 binds to SK channels, small conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels. Pi4 competes with apamin, another SK-channel toxin. IC50 is 0.5 ± 0.2 μM.  Toxicity  Scorpion venoms can be toxic for mammals, insects, and crustaceans. Pi4 is lethal in mice upon injection in the ventricular system of the brain at and LD50 value of 0.2 μg/mouse.

Etymology  The LmαTX3 toxin derives the first part of its name from the source of the venom (Lychas mucronatus, 'Lm') , the middle part due to its nature as an α-scorpion toxin ('αTX'), and the last part as a reflection of the binding to receptor site 3 the toxin acts upon.  Sources  LmαTX3 is a toxin expressed and secreted by the venom gland of Lychas mucronatus, a scorpion from the family Buthidae found in China, Laos, Thailand and other regions of Asia.  Chemistry  Scorpion toxins targeting VGSGs (also called NaTX) are usually polypeptides composed of 61–76 amino acids cross-linked by four disulfide bridges. LmαTX3 consists of the same disulfide bridge pattern and conserved residues as sodium channel-specific modulators, thus suggesting its modulating effect on sodium channels. Analysis of the amino acid sequence in cDNA previously acquired of the Lychas mucronatus showed that LmαTX3 contained 21 residues in their signal peptides, and 62 residues in their mature peptides (the peptide remaining after the cleaving of the signal peptide). Modelling of the 3D structure of LmαTX3 showed a typical cysteine-stabilized α-helix/β-sheet motif (CSαβ motif), with the α-helix stabilized by two disulfide bridges to one strand of the β sheet. Similar to other α-scorpion toxins, LmαTX3 presented with potential functional residues in the conversed NC-domains (Lys1, Lys8, Lys 51, Asn53, Ile54 and Lys57) and the Core-domains (Arg14, Lys23, Arg39 and Lys 42). Therefore, there are strong suggestions that LmαTX3 falls under the NaTX type of channels. The molecular weight of LmαTX3 is 9.2 kDa.  Target  Electrophysiological experiments have evaluated the effect of recombinant LmαTX3 on the following four types of sodium channels: * rNav1.2: expressed at high levels in the central nervous system * mNav1.4: mostly found in adult skeletal muscles * hNav1.5: mostly found in embryonic and denervated skeletal muscle and heart muscle * hNav1.7: primarily in the peripheral nervous system LmαTX3 inhibits fast inactivation of these types of sodium channels. It modulates the inactivation of mNav1.4 and hNav1.5 channels more potently than of hNav1.7 channels and especially rNav1.2 channels.  Mode of Action  The α-toxins can inhibit the fast inactivation of VGSGs. Based on its homology to other members of the α-scorpion toxin family, LmαTX3 most likely blocks receptor site 3, which is located on the extracellular loop of sodium channels which connects the S3 and S4 segments on domain IV. Site 3 toxins prevent a component of outward gating charge movement associated with channel inactivation, it is likely that they are able to slow inactivation by preventing the outward movement of the DIV S4 segment, hence making fast inactivation difficult and prolonging the action potential. In this sense, scorpion α-toxins can be considered gating-modifier toxins.  Toxicity  Currently, there is no LmαTX3-specific knowledge of the toxic effect. Generally, scorpion α-toxins prolong the action potentials of excitable cells. These toxins can kill organisms by inducing paralysis and arrhythmia.

Uxbridge was a safe Conservative seat, so much so that no Liberal candidate contested the previous general elections in 1895 and 1900. The Liberals swept to power nationally and the tide nearly took Pocock into parliament. He lost by just 145 votes. Four years later, at the January 1910 General Election, he once again contested Uxbridge but this time the Conservative won comfortably. Later that year, he switched constituencies and was Liberal candidate for the Devizes division of Wiltshire at the December 1910 General Election. Devizes was a better seat for the Liberals, they had won it in 1906. The Conservatives had won it back in January 1910.

Wol Myeong Dong, ) is a worship and recreation center in Chungnam Province, South Korea. It is also known as the Recreation Center of the Christian Gospel Mission (CGM). Wolmyeongdong consists of various facilities and buildings on a tract of land of about 991,735 square meters in size. Development of Wolmyeongdong began in the early 1990s and was led by CGM founder Jeong Myeong Seok. Although construction presently continues, visitors are free to come and go as they please. It has attracted tourists from several countries. It was built with a design in mind that would not damage the surroundings but vitalize the beauty of the surrounding nature as much as possible. As a recreation center, Wolmyeongdong contains various hiking and walking trails, a pond, an art gallery, a rock museum, a sports field, natural spring water, and various other amenities. However, since it is also a temple in nature that has been dedicated to the Holy Trinity, statues of the Holy Son can be seen around the sports field. Rock Landscape At the front mountain of Wolmyeongdong, there is a rock landscape called the Ambition Masterpiece. At the very end of the Ambition Masterpiece is a tall boulder that serves as a signboard for this natural temple. Engraved on it are the words Natural Temple in Korean. At the top of the Ambition Masterpiece, there are twin boulders with the inscription: \\"All this has been designed by God, inspired by the Holy Spirit, and protected by the Lord Jesus Christ. We have worked as Their hands and as their feet.\\"  White Statue of the Holy Son  Wolmyeongdong houses a monumental statue of Jesus that is entirely white. It depicts Jesus in a flowing robe with arms wide open, standing firmly upon a pedestal surrounded by a marble fence. The statue of Jesus stands in a prominent location within the retreat center next to the lawn sanctuary. Besides this white statue, there is also a bronze statue of Jesus and a stone statue. alt=The White Statue of the Holy Son in Wolmyeongdong.  Natural Spring Water  Natural spring water flows in abundance from multiple areas in Wolmyeongdong in all seasons except Winter, when most the springs are frozen.  History of Seasonal Events  During each of the four seasons, CGM hosts various events throughout the year which include the summer retreats, spring flower festivals, and autumn rock festivals. = Spring Flower Festival = Pink flowers bloom in Wolmyeongdong during the flower festival  2014 Fragrant Flower Flower Aroma Festival  From 2014 April 21 to May 20, CGM held a spring flower festival in Wolmyeongdong, called the Fragrant Flower Flower Aroma Festival. During the event, there were various art contests along the trail to the cultural center. The festival was based on this underlying theme: “In this place, everything is art.\\"  2015 Flower Queen Festival  From 2015 May 2 to May 10, CGM held another flower festival called the Flower Queen Festival in Wolmyeondong. Instead of contests, the festival's activities revolved around performances and videos. There was also an exhibition of proverbs written by Jeong Myeong Seok displayed in front of the Front Mountain. The proverbs explored the value of life and the value of receiving salvation. > “Flowers are beautiful and fragrant. However, they wither away in an > instant. In this way, life is like a flower, and the life of the physical > body is a life of vanity.” - Proverb by Jeong Myeong Seok If you visit Wolmyeongdong during spring, you can enjoy the Natural Temple along with all of the flowers that have blossomed. One of the best places to go is the King Cherry Blossom Woods located behind the Holy Son's House of Love. You are free to take pictures and sometimes lunch is provided.  2016 Myeong (Bright) Flower Festival  From 2016 April 30 to May 8, CGM held their most recent flower festival called the Myeong Flower Festival in Wolmyeongdong. The flower festival was based on the idea that Christians are flowers with the fragrance of the Lord. > “Our purpose for living is for our Creator. It is for Him that we live. Just > as a flower must have its fragrance, as believers, let us become people who > spread the Lord’s fragrance and love.” - Director of the Wolmyeongdong > Recreation Center The 2016 Myeong Flower Festival differentiated itself from the previous flower festivals by including the local residents of Geumsan in the spring picnic held on May 4 and by having events on May 7 that the members of CGM could enjoy with their parents. = Autumn rock festivals = After the initial success of the 2011 Rock Gem Festival, which had over 40,000 visitors, the Rock Gem Festival has become an annual event along with Wolmyeongdong's Flower Festivals, which also began in 2011.  2012 Gem Rock Festival  Part of Wolmyeongdong's Rock Museum next to the sports field On 2012 Oct 22, CGM held their second Rock Gem Festival. It was held with the purpose of getting people to think about the value of life while not only looking at the trails throughout Wolmyeongdong but also the rocks. A person from the rock festival committee conveyed the purpose of the festival saying: > “If you think of the time from the birth of the universe to the creation of > the Earth, in a way, it takes 13 billion years for a rock to be made. So we > try to think about how our lives have that much value and dignity, just like > how God has been shaping nature until each rock has become its current > figure.”  2013 Third Rock Treasure & Life Treasure Festival  From 2013 Sep 28 to Oct 27, CGM held their third Rock Gem Festival. During the rock festival, CGM also held their National Soccer Tournament from October 10 to 12. Following the soccer tournament, there was a dance contest, “Move with the Sound of God,” on October 19. From then until October 27, there were other cultural events such as “The Music Concert Celebration of the Holy Son’s House of Love” and “The Dance Festival and Korean Traditional Music Festival with New Songs.” In various places around Wolmyeongdong, from Heotgol to Nongol, 88 proverbs written by Jeong Myeong Seok were placed around so that people could remember the Creator and give glory to Him while enjoying God's creations and the rock gemstones littered throughout Wolmyeongdong.  Gusang Art Museum  Throughout the year, various types of artwork are displayed in the Gusang Art Museum in Wolmyeongdong. On February 21, CGM showcased paintings of palm trees and pine trees by Jeong Myeong Seok and other artists in the Gusang Art Museum in Wolmyeongdong. One of the highlights of the Gusang Art Museum is the painting called Destiny, which symbolizes a person who has left his or her destiny up to God. > A snail like the one in “Destiny” is the stork’s favorite prey. No one will > say that the snail has any chance of survival, not even the stork: “You are > my prey. You will be dead in one peak.” However, the snail did not surrender > to death but said, “I will live.” It runs with all its might to avoid death, > but no matter how fast the snail may run, before the stork, its speed is > like that of an hour hand before the second hand. If you make a reservation at least one day before you go, you can view the exhibition while receiving a detailed explanation of the paintings from one of the museum's guides. Admission is free and the gallery is open from 10am to 5pm. However, it is closed every Wednesday.  Prayer assemblies  CGM also holds prayer assemblies in Wolmyeongdong. On 23 April 2014, CGM held a prayer meeting in Wolmyeongdong to pray for the victims of the Sewol Ferry incident and for all nations in the world to realize the value of life. Other prayer assemblies in Wolmyeongdong have centered on praying for the future and peace of Korea. Since Jung emphasizes peace and harmony rather than on winning, the events in Wolmyeongdong engage people to interact harmoniously, whether it may be in sports competitions or struggles between nations.  Current status and management  Currently, CGM is developing its third waterfall next to the Holy Son's House of Love. The area will be developed into a courtyard where people can swim in a 21 meter long swimming pool or enjoy the scenery of the lake and other areas while praising God.

They focus on both Ukrainian music and international works through the centuries such as Alfred Schnittke's Pater Noster, Samuel Barber's Agnus Dei, Eric Whitacre's Lux Aurumque, Rachmaninoff's All-Night Vigil, Pärt Uusberg's Kyrie and Hyo-Won Woo's Gloria. They have collected prizes at international choral competitions such as the International Robert Schumann Choir Competition and the 14th International Chamber Choir Competition Marktoberdorf in 2015, where they won among other awards a special prize for the best interpretation of a religious choral work for performing Schnittke's: Lord Jesus Christ. They performed concerts such as at the Aachen Biennale in 2009, where they sang solo concerts and also together with six other international choirs in the concluding work, Leonard Bernstein's \\"Kaddish\\". Daniel Honsack, a reviewer of the Wiesbadener Tagblatt, noted about their concert in St. Martin, Idstein: \\"The choir impresses with gentle persistence and penetrating sharpness. The tonal homogeneity, which is retained even in seemingly chaotic placement of the singers, is astonishing. The individual parts shine in individual sound colors, which can be mixed in different combinations\\". (\\"Der Chor beeindruckt mit sanfter Nachhaltigkeit und eindringlicher Schärfe. Verblüffend ist die klangliche Homogenität, die auch bei scheinbar chaotischer Choraufstellung beibehalten wird. Die einzelnen Stimmgruppen glänzen durch eigenständige Klangfarben, die sich immer wieder neu zusammenmischen lassen.\\") In June 2016 the choir participated in Israel, along with the Gary Bertini Israel Choir, in gala concerts of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Vasily Petrenko of Rachmaninoff's choral symphony The Bells.

A poor relation of the Verinder family, Miss Clack is an ardent Evangelical, and has a habit of handing out improving tracts to strangers and family alike. Social and Historical Context P. D. James suggests that, as \\"an evangelical busybody...Miss Clack occasionally gets close to being a caricature\\".P. D. James, 'Introduction', Wilkie Collins, The Moonstone (Oxford 1999) p. ix-x A quasi-editorial footnote alerts us to the way her narrative is intended to have \\"unquestionable value as an instrument for the exhibition of Miss Clack's character\\"; and when she describes her eavesdropping as \\"A martyrdom was before me\\", or exclaims \\"Sorrow and sympathy! Oh, what Pagan emotions to expect from a Christian Englishwoman\\", her role as comic self-betrayer becomes very apparent.Wilkie Collins, The Moonstone (Oxford 1999) p. 229n, p. 274, and p. 254 However, there was another side to her presentation: Collins - like Dickens, aware of the power behind Victorian evangelicanism, and of how spite and aggression could be concealed under a philanthropic cloak - mingled the serious with the comic in his portrayal of Miss Clack.C. Oulton, Literature and Religion in Mid-Victorian Britain (2002) p. 32 and p. 115 The issue comes to a head with regard to her apparently endless distribution of tracts - extracts in pamphlet form of evangelical literature - to the modern eye, a seemingly unique eccentricity. We first see her giving tracts to a servant and a cabbie in place of a tip; and then concealing no less than \\"twelve precious publications\\" around her dying aunt's house for the latter to find.Wilkie Collins, The Moonstone (Oxford 1999) p. 229-30, p. 255 and p. 269 This sort of activity would be characteristic of individuals associated with the Religious Tract Society, which published literally millions of tracts from 1799 onward of precisely the kind Collins describes;C. Peters, The King of Inventors (2014) p. 305 its members took pride in going to great lengths to disseminate their messages;C. Oulton, Literature and Religion in Mid-Victorian Britain (2002) p. 97 Thus it is only in the context of the strength of the evangelical mobilisation of public opinion behind the enforcement of Victorian morality,B. Wilson, Decency and Disorder (London 2007) p. 379 and p. 431 and the opposition to this influence in some quarters, that the significance of Miss Clack can be fully appreciated. Writers like Collins and G. M. Trevelyan opposed what they saw as \\"the peculiarly nauseous form of charity as a vehicle for tracts and enforced religion\\",G. M. Trevelyan, British History in the Nineteenth Century (London 1922) p. 55 judging that it was generally applied to social inferiors, with aggression masquerading as generosity.Leah Price, How to Do Things with Books in Victorian Britain (2012) p. 211 See also  References   External links  * Religion, Rogues, and Robinson Crusoe Category:Literary characters introduced in 1868 Category:Fictional English people Category:Fictional British people ","title":"Miss Clack"},{"id":"51933113","text":"Oriam is Scotland's national performance centre for sport, based at Heriot- Watt University's Riccarton campus in Edinburgh. The Scottish Rugby Union and the Scottish Football Association use it as a training facility, as do Heart of Midlothian F.C. for first-team training and to run their academy. It is also used by other sports teams, students and members of the public. History A review of Scottish football, led by former First Minister of Scotland Henry McLeish, picked up on the lack of facilities in Scotland in the first report published in April 2010. In February 2012, Sport Minister Shona Robison announced that £25million from the Scottish Government's Young Scots Fund would be put towards a new multi-sports centre which would include a national football academy. Universities, colleges and local authorities were invited to bid. By August 2013 there were three finalists. In September 2013, it was announced that the design by Reiach & Hall was chosen. The remaining £9million towards the cost of building came from sportscotland, Heriot-Watt University and the City of Edinburgh Council. Construction work began in March 2015. The £33million facility opened in August 2016. The indoor football pitch is covered by a curved steel frame with a PVC roof, the shape of which has been likened to the trajectory of \\"the goal which defied physics\\" which was scored by Brazilian football player Roberto Carlos against France in 1997. The building won the Future Building section at the 2016 Scottish Design Awards. Sports The Scottish Rugby Union and the Scottish Football Association have both made long-term commitments to using Oriam ahead of international fixtures. Heart of Midlothian F.C. use the facility to run their academy and for first-team training. The Scottish Handball Association, basketballscotland and Scottish Netball also use the facility. Furthermore, it is used by the recently formed professional women’s team in basketball and handball, both launched in summer 2016. Unlike some elite performance facilities, Oriam will be available to other sports teams, students and members of the public. For the 2016–17 season, Hibernian F.C. will play their under-20 fixtures at Oriam. Facilities The centre has a FIFA-accredited indoor synthetic 3G pitch which is the largest of its type in Europe. Its dimensions of 116 yards by 76 yards are the same size as those of Hampden Park's pitch. At the midpoint of this playing space, the roof is 28m high and there is a 15m playing height at the sides. The space accommodates a viewing area that can seat 500 people. There is also a synthetic pitch outdoors. There are natural surfaces outside too- five grass football pitches and two grass rugby pitches. Indoors there is a 12-court sports hall, eight squash courts and a four-court sports hall. Other facilities available on the high-performance side of the centre include a HydroWorx 3500i Series hydrotherapy pool with an integrated treadmill, a rehabilitation area and gym area for strength and conditioning. A 160-bed hotel is to be located on the site, to open in 2017.

This toxin is a selective blocker of BK channels, calcium-activated potassium channels.  Etymology and source  Limbatustoxin is purified from the venom of the Centruroides limbatus, a bark scorpion that lives in Central America.Yu, M, Liu, SL, Sun, PB, Pan, H, Tian, CL, & Zhang, LH (2016). “Peptide toxins and small-molecule blockers of BK channels”. Acta Pharmacologica Sinica, 37(1), 56-66. doi:10.1038/aps.2015.139.  Chemistry  Limbatustoxin (LbTX; α-KTx 1.4) is a 37-amino acid peptide, which belongs to the α-KTx 1.x subfamily, a group of short peptides consisting of 36-37 amino acid residues and three disulfide bridges. LbTX displays 57% sequence homology with charybdotoxin and 70% sequence homology with iberiotoxin. LbTX contains a β-sheet formed by three anti-parallel β-strands on one side of the molecule and a helix on the other side. This structure is important for binding to BK channels.  Target and mode of action  Limbatustoxin is highly selective for calcium-activated potassium channels, also called maxi-K channels, slo1 or BK (big potassium) channels. These channels play an important role in the excitability of neurons and the control of muscle contractions. Residues on β-sheet face of the helix as well as residues in the turn between the helix and the second anti-parallel strand and in the second and third strands of the β-sheet are critical for the binding of the toxin to the BK channel. When binding to the channel, limbatustoxin is known to block and inhibit the function of the BK channel. It seems likely that limbatustoxin modifies the gating mechanism of the channel, because the toxin binds to the β-subunit of the channel, which has a modulating function on the gating of the channel.McManus, OB, Helms, LM, Pallanck, L, Ganetzky, B, Swanson, R, & Leonard, RJ (1995). “Functional role of the β subunit of high conductance calcium-activated potassium channels”. Neuron, 14(3), 645-650. Based on the 70% homology with iberiotoxin, it seems likely that the limbatustoxin selectively inhibits the current through the BK channel by decreasing probability of opening and the time that the channel is open.Galvez, A, Gimenez-Gallego, G, Reuben, JP, Roy-Contancin, L, Feigenbaum, P, Kaczorowski, GJ, & Garcia, ML (1990). “Purification and characterization of a unique, potent, peptidyl probe for the high conductance calcium-activated potassium channel from venom of the scorpion Buthus tamulus”.

Assad had been living and working in Tanzania. Amnesty International reports he was captured on December 26, 2003, and held by the CIA until May 2005. Asad claimed that the only thing he was asked about during his interrogation was the Al-Haramain Foundation, which the Bush administration has listed as a charity tied to terrorism. His interrogators believed he had worked for Al-Haramain. In May 2005, Muhammad Assad, and two other Yemenis, Salah Ali and Muhammad Bashmilah, were transferred to Yemeni custody. In November 2005 Anne Fitzgerald, a policy researcher for Amnesty International, spoke about interviews she conducted with the three men. She said that she found the men's accounts credible, because their accounts of CIA custody were consistent, even though they had never been detained together, either in their US custody, or in Yemeni custody. According to Fitzgerald, the three describe being held in solitary confinement, isolated from all contact with the outside world, under conditions Amnesty International described as \\"sensory deprivation\\". According to the Washington Post, as of November 2005, all three men remained in Yemeni custody. Muhammad Assad was held in a \\"security prison at Al Ghaydah\\". The Washington Post contacted the CIA, and reported that CIA officials declined to refute or confirm the Amnesty International account. In December, 2014, the United States Senate Intelligence Committee released a 600-page summary of a massive analysis of the CIA's use of torture. According to Newsweek, the report was the first time the US had officially acknowledged that al-Asad was held, and treated abusively, by the CIA. Newsweek described al-Asad as being \\"wrongfully detained\\". Al-Asad died in May 2016. On October 8, 2016, the New York Times started publishing a series of articles on the ongoing mental problems suffered by individuals who had been tortured by the US.

Natural sources  Kalkitoxin is an ichthyotoxin, derived from the cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula which covers sections of the coral reef. It typically forms mini-blooms and produces several metabolites, such as kalkitoxin, curacin-A and antillatoxin. Kalkitoxin has been found and purified near the coasts of Curaçao and Puerto Rico.  Structure and reactivity  Kalkitoxin is a lipopeptide toxin with a molecular weight of 366.604Da. Its chemical formula is C21H38N2OS. The structure contains two double bonds, a 2,4-disubstituted thiazoline ring system, and an additional carbonyl-group. These four groups each provide a degree of unsaturation, which causes kalkitoxin to have four degrees of unsaturation. The structure contains 5 chiral centers, one of which is due to a substituent of the thiazoline ring, and the other four are due to methine groups along the aliphatic carbon chain, which are tertiary carbon atoms bearing three single carbon bonds and one hydrogen. The four methyl groups (each at a methine chiral center), the structure's overall stereochemistry, and the N-methyl group all contribute to the toxicity of kalkitoxin. The six partial structures used to derive the total structure of kalkitoxin = Structure determination = The structure of kalkitoxin was first determined by characterizing six partial structures which were subsequently connected to yield the total structure. This investigation was largely carried out through various NMR experiments. Structure (a) is a sec-butyl group, indicated by characteristic deshielding of its central methine group due to the adjacent carbonyl. Structure (b) contains this carbonyl group, and an adjacent tertiary methylated nitrogen atom, constituting a tertiary amide group. Since this is a tertiary amide, it exists in a cis/trans mixture, which underlies the two conformations of kalkitoxin. Structure (c) is a string of two methylene groups, then a methine group bearing a high-field methyl group. The next two groups identified (d,e) are identical and opposing strings of CH2-CH-CH3, however the left grouping's methylene protons experience greater deshielding, due to their proximity to the adjacent imine. Deshielding is an effect of a nearby electronegative atom withdrawing electron density from a given atom nucleus, eliciting an increased chemical shift as measured by NMR. The final partial structure consists of a thiazoline ring with a terminal alkene substituent, as determined by electron ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS) and 13C NMR. The chemical shifts of ring carbons adjacent to the sulfur and nitrogen heteroatoms were compared to 13C NMR data from model compounds. This allowed for the determination of these heteroatoms' locations in the ring, and subsequently the existence of the thiazoline ring itself. With these partial structures established, their connectivity was evaluated via HMBC spectroscopy, a 2D NMR technique which allows for the determination of heteronuclear J-coupling values for nonadjacent carbons and protons. This allows for the spatial relation of specific carbon and hydrogen atoms within a structure to be determined. = Stereochemistry = Kalkitoxin has five chiral centers, one of which is the ring carbon to which the terminal alkene is coordinated, with the remaining four occurring at tertiary carbon atoms along the aliphatic chain originating from the imine nitrogen. The total stereochemistry of natural (+)-kalkitoxin is 3R,7R,8S,10S,2′R. For this determination, 3JCH values by a variation of the HSQMBC pulse technique, a type of HMBC spectroscopy, and 3JHH values by exclusive correlation spectroscopy (E.COSY). These methods use NMR to evaluate the spin-spin coupling constants which directly relate to the dihedral angle of the atoms being analyzed, allowing for the determination of chirality. This was used to determine the stereochemistry of chiral centers at C7, C8, and C10. Because C7 and C8 are adjacent stereocenters, these techniques allowed for immediate determination of their relative stereochemistry, however C10 is separated from C8 by C9, which carries two diastereotopic protons. This allows for the determination of relative stereochemistry of C8 and C10 to the C9 protons through J-coupling \\\\ 3J coupling values, so as to relate the relative stereochemistry of C8 to C10. These methods yielded a relative stereochemistry of 7R, 8S, 10S for the aliphatic chain stereocenters. Stereochemistry at C3 was determined by Marfey's analysis, wherein the compound was ozonized and subsequently hydrolyzed to obtain cysteic acid from the thiazoline ring and attached terminal alkene. Marfey's analysis indicated this amino acid derivative was L-cysteic acid, indicating R absolute stereochemistry at C3. The absolute stereochemistry of the total molecule was determined by synthesizing the possible configurations of the already determined relative chiralities, and comparison of these to natural Kalkitoxin via 13C NMR shift differences, revealing the natural (+)-kalkitoxin stereochemistry to be 3R,7R,8S,10S,2′R. = Structure-activity relationship = The structure- activity relationship (SAR) of a molecule is the connection between the structural moieties within the compound, and how those specific structures directly contribute to the extent and character of the molecule's biological activity. Kalkitoxin exhibits potent cytotoxicity which relies on the complete thiazoline ring for its action. Kalkitoxin analogs lacking the complete thiazoline ring exhibit on the order of 1000-fold decreased toxicity to solid tumor cell lines. This indicates the thiazoline ring structure is a crucial component of kalkitoxin's mechanism of cytotoxicity. The necessity of the stereochemistry exhibited in natural (+)-kalkitoxin decreases moving towards the chiral centers in the core of the molecule, while the more terminal chiral centers and amide methyl group are increasingly crucial for toxicity. In a study which assayed for the toxicity of kalkitoxin and various analogs against brine shrimp, the analogs which experienced the least significant loss of potency were epimers at either C8 or C10. This indicates that C8 and C10 chiralities in natural (+)-kalkitoxin are the least critical for toxic biological activity. It is apparent that C10 chirality is less critical than C8, because the epimer of (+)-kalkitoxin at C10 is more potent than the epimer at C8. Furthermore, the removal of the C10 methyl group has a smaller impact on potency than does epimerization of C7, supporting the trend of decreased SAR correlation at core chiral centers on the aliphatic chain. Epimerization at C3, the attachment point of the terminal alkene to the thiazoline ring, further decreases potency of kalkitoxin, in agreement with the thiazoline ring and overall conformation of the leftmost segment of the molecule being critical for bioactivity. Finally, replacement of the tertiary amide with a secondary amide eliminates any observable toxicity, so this structure is crucial in the mechanism of kalkitoxin toxicity.  Synthesis  = Wu et al. synthesis = This effort was the first total synthesis of (+)-kalkitoxin, and served the purpose of deducing the specific stereochemistry of natural kalkitoxin. This synthesis began from an alcohol bearing the proper chirality at C8 and C10 found in (+)-kalkitoxin, and carried a dimethylphenylsiloxy (DPSO) group positioned beta to C8, and a terminal alkene positioned alpha to C10. Hydroboration of this alkene gives the resulting alcohol, which is converted to an azide, which is the position at which (R)-2-methylbutyric acid is coupled to produce the sec-butyl group and amide group. The amide is subsequently methylated, finalizing the tertiary amide which has been shown to be so crucial for kalkitoxin toxicity. O-Desilylation and oxidation of the resulting alcohol produce an acceptor for a Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, wherein a carbonyl and an alpha-methylated phosphonate react to produce an alkene. In this case, a beta-keto phosphonate bearing an (R)-phenylglycine- derived auxiliary group was ligated to the molecule. This group is lost in asymmetric conjugate addition of an (R)-amino alcohol, which, through two cyclodehydration steps using Wipf's oxazoline-thiazoline interconversion protocol, produces the thiazoline ring. = White et al. synthesis = The second total synthesis of (+)-kalkitoxin was only 16 steps and gave a 3% overall yield. A major aspect by which this differs from the first total synthesis of (+)-kalkitoxin is that rather than using a Horner-Wadsworth- Emmons reaction to ligate a phosphonate carrying the 4-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone, an organocopper conjugate addition reaction was used instead. This was done specifically by connecting the organocopper species to a 4-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone carrying an (S)-N-trans-crotonyl group through a 1,4-nucleophilic addition to the α,β-unsaturation of the crotonyl group. This method is advantageous because it allows for stereoselectivity of the resulting 1,3-dimethyl configuration during the larger sequential introduction of the methyl substituents at the C7, C8 and C10 chiral centers. Another point of diversion between these two syntheses is the number of carbons separating the keto-auxiliary group from the chiral center at C7. This group was separated by one carbon from C7 in the first total synthesis, so the keto- auxiliary moiety could be converted to a carboxylic acid, in anticipation of addition of the amino alcohol immediately thereafter. In this synthesis, this keto-auxiliary group is directly adjacent to C7, necessitating a one carbon homologation, before construction of the thiazoline ring. This was achieved through reductive bond cleavage of the auxiliary group to a primary alcohol and oxidation to the corresponding aldehyde, Wittig reaction using an ylide carrying a methoxy group to produce an enol ether, hydrolysis to the aldehyde and finally oxidation to produce the carboxylic acid. = Balieu et al. synthesis = This synthesis differentiates itself in that it takes an \\"assembly line\\" synthesis approach, as opposed to the conventional iterative synthetic approach taken in previous syntheses which normally necessitate functional-group interconversions and repetitive purifications for aliphatic chain extensions, such as the one found in kalkitoxin. This novel approach is achieved through the use of reagent-controlled chain extension of a boronic ester, which relies on a spontaneous 1,2-migration after formation of an intermediate compound incorporating a newly added lithiated benzoate ester building block. This allows for control of chirality at each addition by selecting the chirality of each benzoate ester added. Furthermore, this avoids repetitive interconversion and purification steps normally required for repeat chain extensions, which increases yield and efficiency and decreases labor. This synthesis capitalized on this technique by producing the core aliphatic chain as a single large fragment, and coupled this fragment to the chiral sec- butyl group bearing a carboxylic acid. The opposing amino thioether fragment was synthesized separately, and then adjoined and subsequently cyclized following the procedure devised by White et al. In total, this synthesis requires only 7 steps if the initial homologation series is counted as one step.  Targets  Kalkitoxin may activate the NMDA receptor. It also blocks the voltage-gated sodium channel and the electron transport chain (ETC) complex 1. It remains unknown how exactly kalkitoxin binds to the voltage- gated sodium channel. Neurotoxin sit 1 and 2 have been ruled out as possible binding sites, whereas neurotoxin site 7 is suggested as binding site for kalkitoxin. This is probable, because there is inhibition of the channel by kalkitoxin when deltamethrin, which has positive allosteric effects, is present. This could be because molecular determinants for binding are similar in kalkitoxin and deltamethrin.  Mode of action  451x451px Kalkitoxin induces delayed neuronal necrosis in cerebellar granule cells of the rat. This neuronal necrosis proved to be NMDA-receptor mediated. These receptors are normally activated by glutamate and other excitotoxic compounds and can induce neuronal necrosis. It is not yet known if the toxin induces necrosis directly or via the release of excitotoxic compounds. Secondly, kalkitoxin blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby inhibiting Ca2+ release that normally occurs when the voltage-gated sodium channel is activated, in a concentration dependent matter. Calcium release has been shown to induce lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) production. The amount of LDH is a measure for neuronal cell death. In the presence of kalkitoxin there is also a concentration- dependent inhibition of neuronal cell death and LDH production (9). The mechanism behind this inhibition is still unknown. Thirdly, kalkitoxin blocks the electron transport chain (ETC) complex 1, one of the protein complexes involved in mitochondrial respiration. By blocking the ETC complex 1, kalkitoxin potently inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) activation. HIF-1 is a transcription factor, which enhances the expression of genes that increase oxygen availability, as well as genes that decrease oxygen consumption. Inhibition of HIF-1, which is one of the main effects of kalkitoxin, thus induces cellular hypoxia.  Toxicity  Kalkitoxin is ichthyotoxic to goldfish (Carassius auratus, LC50: 700nM) and to aquatic crustacean brine shrimp (Artemia salina, LC50: 150-180nM ). Kalkitoxin also has been shown to have delayed neurotoxic effects on cerebellar granule cells of the rat (LC50: 3,86nM).  Therapeutic research  Many efforts to discover cancer therapeutic drugs focus on the screening of novel biomolecules produced and isolated from various plants and animals. These isolated molecules are screened via in-vitro assays to measure their effects in standardized paradigms designed to select for the desired therapeutic effect. Kalkitoxin was originally isolated from Lyngbya majuscula as an effort to collect new molecules for testing as antitumor or antifungal agents. One of the first tests of kalkitoxin tumor-selective cytotoxicity used an in-vitro assay to test solid tumor selectivity of kalkitoxin's previously demonstrated cytotoxicity against the human colon cell line HCT-116. The assay measured the extent of differential cytotoxicity of kalkitoxin and various analogous structures by observing differential cytotoxicity against solid tumor cells, and either non-solid tumor cells such as leukemia cells or normal cells. This test yielded promising results, as kalkitoxin exhibited preferential cytotoxicity for the solid tumor cell test conditions (Colon 38, and HCT-116 cells) as compared to the non-solid tumor and normal cell conditions. Kalkitoxin exerts this cytotoxic effect through inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex 1. This causes the inhibition of hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activation, which is crucial in solid tumor cancers because hypoxia drives tumor angiogenesis, leading to worsening disease stages and increased resistance to treatment. HIF-1 is a transcription factor which induces expression of genes promoting oxygen availability and decreasing oxygen consumption, the effect of which counteracts cellular hypoxia.Semenza, G.L. Oxygen sensing, hypoxia-inducible factors, and disease pathophysiology. Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2014, 9, 47–71. Therefore, kalkitoxin's HIF-1 inhibitory ability positions it as a potentially promising molecule to counteract the progression of some solid tumor cancers by blocking the tumor proliferative response to hypoxia. The caveat to kalkitoxin's promising anti-proliferative properties is its neurotoxic effects. At concentrations comparable to those required for tumor-selective cytotoxicity, kalkitoxin induces cell death when applied to rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) in culture. Kalkitoxin acts as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist, and induces cytotoxicity in cultured rat CGNs at delayed time points. Therefore, this effect must be taken into account when considering kalkitoxin or its chemical derivatives for use as a therapeutic option.

Brawner, 471 F.2d 969 (D.C. Cir. 1972), is decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in which the Court held that a person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. The case overturned the Durham rule for determining whether a defendant was not guilty by reason of insanity. The Court ruled that the primary reason they were departing from the old test of insanity is that it put substantial dominance on the testimony of experts. The Court exhaustively examined the justification for the defense of insanity and the need to guide the jury with a specific framework for the insanity defense. The American Law Institute provided a better framework in the majority's opinion because it took part of the reliance on experts away and focused on the acts and mental state of a defendant at the time he committed the acts constituting the crime.Insanity, Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice 735-40 (1983); Abraham GoldsteinCriminal Law - Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder, , It proposed a rule that was adopted as the American Law Institute Model Penal Code rule (ALI rule).

Schiffler's father was an elementary school teacher and his grandfather was a toy manufacturer. Schiffler was born in Gotha, Thuringia, where he grew up as well. He had just completed the local gymnasium (high-school) in 1914, when he was drafted as a soldier in World War I. After the war Schiffler studied first at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology and later at the University of Stuttgart, which awarded him an engineering degree. Then he worked as an engineer for a machine factory in Esslingen.Lore Thier-Schröter und Hellmut Thier: Kurt Schiffler zum 100. Geburtstag. Gründer der Dusyma-Werkstätten. L. Schiffler- Betz, Schorndorf-Miedelsbach 1996, pp. 8-9,15-17, 23-24, 29-33(German) building block with cogs invented by Schiffler In 1925 he founded his own company called Dusyma, which produced educational toys and musical instrument made of wood. The instruments that Dusyma produced comprised an improved version of the Stoessel lute and the Mandolute. In 1937 Schiffler invented a special building block with cogs as a basic element for construction kits of wood pieces allowing to construct various toy buildings and structures. Dusyma produced not only toys but also children's furniture and other supplies needed in kindergartens. Many of the educational toys Dusyma produced were inspired by the Froebel gifts. Schiffler collaborated with Erika Hoffman, a professor of pedagogics and expert on Friedrich Froebel, and the Kindergarten teacher Christine Uhl, who designed one of the construction kits produced by Dusyma. During World War II Schiffler was again drafted as a soldier and his company was reorganized to produce material needed for the war effort. After the war Dusyma went back to manufacture educational toys and various kindergarten supplies. In addition to wood now plastic was used as construction material as well. In 1971 Schiffler was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1978 he asked his daughter Lulu Schiffler-Betz to join Dusyma to prepare her for leading the company later on. 1981 Schiffler retired and passed on Dusyma's management to his daughter. Triangle ABC is partitioned into triangles ABI,BCI, ACI and the Euler lines e0,e1,e2,e3 coincide in the Schiffler point S Schiffler had in interest in geometry and discovered that if you partition a triangle into 3 subtriangle with the incenter as a common point, then the Euler lines of those subtriangles and the original triangle intersect in a common point. This property became later known as Schiffler's theorem and that common point as Schiffler point. Schiffler published his discovery in 1985 in the form of a problem in the Canadian journal Crux Mathematicorum.Joe Goggins: The Converse of Schiffler's theorem.

It is considered to be the first known successful cyberattack on a power grid. Most affected were consumers of «Prykarpattyaoblenergo» (; servicing Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast): 30 substations(seven 110kv substation and 23 35kv substation) were switched off, and about 230 thousand people were left without electricity for a period from 1 to 6 hours. At the same time consumers of two other energy distribution companies, «Chernivtsioblenergo» (; servicing Chernivtsi Oblast) and «Kyivoblenergo» (; servicing Kyiv Oblast) were also affected by a cyberattack, but at a smaller scale. According to representatives of one of the companies, attacks were conducted from computers with IP addresses allocated to the Russian Federation. It has been argued that the Ukraine power grid cyberattack is of limited relevance for concerns over hacking of grids in connection with expanding use of renewable energy, as the Ukraine case took place under special conditions that do not apply elsewhere. Description The cyberattack was complex and consisted of the following steps: * prior compromise of corporate networks using spear-phishing emails with BlackEnergy malware; * seizing SCADA under control, remotely switching substations off; * disabling/destroying IT infrastructure components (uninterruptible power supplies, modems, RTUs, commutators); * destruction of files stored on servers and workstations with the KillDisk malware; * denial-of-service attack on call-center to deny consumers up-to-date information on the blackout. In total, up to 73 MWh of electricity was not supplied (or 0.015% of daily electricity consumption in the Ukraine). Cyber attacks on the energy distribution companies took place during an ongoing conflict in the Ukraine and is attributed to a Russian advanced persistent threat group known as \\"Sandworm\\".

Palmier was a 74-gun ship of the line of the French Navy. History Built by Joseph Véronique-Charles Chapelle, her keel was laid down at Brest on 14 November 1750 as part of the shipbuilding boom between the end of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1748 and the start of the Seven Years' War in 1755.Patrick Villiers, La France sur mer : De Louis XIII à Napoléon Ier, Paris, Fayard, coll. « Pluriel », 2015, 286 p. (), page 126 She was built to the norms set for ships of the line by French shipbuilders in the 1740s to try to match the cost, armament and manouvrability of their British counterparts, since the Royal Navy had had a greater number of ships than the French since the end of the wars of Louis XIV.Martine Acerra and André Zysberg, L’essor des marines de guerre européennes : 1680–1790, Paris, éditions SEDES, coll. « Regards sur l'histoire », 1997, 298 p. (), pages 90–91 She was launched on 21 July 1752 and completed in October of the same year. She was commanded by Joseph de Bauffremont during the Canadian campaign by Rémy-Claude de Bullion's fleet in May 1755 at the start of the Seven Years' War. She did not fight at Lagos or Quiberon Bay, in which the Toulon and Brest fleets were defeated in a new attempt at an invasion of Britain. In June 1766 it was ordered that she should be rebuilt at Brest because her timbers were so rotten that it was not possible to save any for a refit. Taken in hand at Brest Dockyard, she was re- launched in December 1766 and emerged, essentially as a new ship to the lines of Citoyen, a new 74-gun designed by Joseph-Louis Ollivier. In 1778 Palmier was under Boscal de Réals as part of the White-and-Blue squadron, the vanguard of the fleet under Orvilliers. She took part in the Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778. In 1780 she was sent to the Antilles as part of de Guichen's fleet. There she fought in the Battle of Martinique on 16 April and in two other indecisive encounters against Rodney's forces. In May 1781 she served as François-Aymar de Monteil's flagship in the Franco-Spanish attack on Pensacola in Florida. The Palmier then joined de Grasse's fleet, which had just arrived from France, and returned with it to the Antilles. On 12 September 1781 she was in the midst of the battle of Chesapeake, a decisive French victory which lead to the British defeat in the Siege of Yorktown. Still stationed in the Antilles, she took part in the Battle of St Kitts in January 1782. On 12 April she was part of the rearguard at the French defeat in the Battle of the Saintes. She was retired from the fleet the same year when it was ordered back to France, but was sunk by a major storm off the Bermudas on 24 October 1782.

It is used in Armenia, Turkey, Iranian Azerbaijanis, Azerbaijan Georgia and other Caucasus regions. It has different names, according to the territory in which it is played. This membranophone is different from the dhol and nagara of India. Dhol in Armenia The dhol is a common folk instrument played in Armenia, as well as historically throughout Armenian history, since the times of Cilicia, the Armenian Kingdom. The dhol may be played with sticks, mallets, or with the palms of the hands and the fingers. Once used during military campaigns, the dhol is now played in folkloric trios (the duduk and zurna complementing the dhol) and orchestra. The Armenian Highlands have been home to Armenians for thousands of years, so it is believed that either the Armenian merchants from Silk Road brought the instrument from India, or vis-versa. Nagara in Turkey The nağara (also called koltuk davulu) is a Turkish folk drum or percussion instrument. It is placed under the arm and beaten with the hands. It is longer compared to the regular drums and its diameter is smaller. Doli in Georgia The doli is played across Georgia in the Caucasus. The body consists of a hollow wooden cylinder covered with leather tightly attached to it with iron rings. It is played by palms and fingers, under or over the arm, while sitting or dancing. It is struck in the center to get the forte effect and at the edges to get a piano effect. The doli’s height and diameter of the body and head is about 3 to 1. It is mostly men who play the doli. In performance, the doli creates the rhythm of the dance. The doli is often combined with other regional instruments including the chonguri, the chiboni, the salamuri, the buzika and the duduki. Nagara in Azerbaijan Since the state of Azerbaijan was founded in 1918, the prototype of dhol of neighbouring countries has been adapted to locals and associated with Turkish Nagara, used widely across the country today. There is a proverb in the Azerbaijani language (Turkish language) that says \\"toy-dan-sora-naghara!\\" This literally means after the wedding ceremonies naghara! This instrument helped the doctors to deal with bad mood, melancholy, intellectual and physical exhaustion, as well as low blood pressure. It was considered that the Naghara could be substituted for some medicinal plants like spicy cloves. The rhythmic beating of the naghara is believed to lead to the strengthening of the heart. The naghara is described in the Early Middle Age Turkish literary epic, \\"Kitabi Dada Gorgud\\" (Book of Dede Korkut) (The Book of my Grandfather).

Monihon (November 6, 1837September 2, 1904) was an American businessman and politician. He was a signatory to the formation of the Salt River Valley Town Association, the first government of the area that became Phoenix, and later served on the board of supervisors and as mayor of Phoenix. Early years, mining, military service Monihon was born to James and Ann (Martin) Monaghan, Irish immigrants, in Oneida County, New York on November 6, 1837. When he was two, his family moved to St. Lawrence County where he grew up on a farm and attended local schools. Monihon joined the California Gold Rush in 1854, traveling by sea via the Isthmus of Panama. After reaching San Francisco, California, he became involved in placer mining often around Howland Flat, Sierra County until 1861. At the beginning of the Civil War, Monihon enlisted in Company F of the 1st California Infantry Regiment. While in the military, he served throughout the area that composes modern day Arizona and New Mexico. As Chief of the Howitzer division he fired a celebratory salute in Tucson on July 4, 1862. Ten days later he saw action during the Battle of Apache Pass when his unit of 64 soldiers was attacked by over 450 Apache Indians led by chief Cochise. Following the battle, his unit spent two months in Mesilla before being redeployed to Fort Craig. In late 1863, Monihon's unit was ordered to Fort Wingate. From there they continued to the Chino valley where they established Fort Whipple. Monihon served as Provost Sergeant at his new posting until his discharge at the end of the war. He remained in central Arizona, where he worked in mining again for several years and ran a livery stable in Prescott. Much of his mining work was as engineer of the mill at the Big Bug mine. In 1868, Monihon sold the livery business, the Plaza Feed and Livery Stable, to Gideon Brooke and Jacob Linn. George M. Willing tried to sell him half ownership in the fraudulent Peralta land grant for $250 in 1867. Willing suggested that the two of them could reap a sizable profit by selling nearby mines back to their owners. Monihon was incensed by the offer and rebuffed Willing who quickly left town. Almost 30 years later, Monihon testified as a principal witness for the government about this in court after the fraud was exposed. Monihon relocated to Wickenburg and in March 1869, opened the Wickenburg Feed and Sale Stable. Phoenix The Monihon Building, as depicted in the 1892 Phoenix Directory A year later, he was in Phoenix where he built what is claimed to be Phoenix's second house. He was one of the first builders in the area, using adobe techniques suited for the available materials. In 1870, he was a signatory to the formation of the Salt River Valley Town Association, the first government of the area that became Phoenix. On January 17, 1871, he planted the first Cottonwood tree in the town. He partnered with Captain Hancock in 1871 to erect the first Maricopa County Courthouse which they rented to the county as the seat of the county government. The city's first public school was located there and the first District Court for Maricopa County held its initial session in the building which also acted as the civic center of the city. When the county moved out in 1875, the building was used as a Justice of the Peace office for many years. In May 1872, he built a barn and corral for the Starar Brothers, from which they ran the Phoenix Livery, Feed, and Sales Stables on the corner of Washington Street and First Avenue. Monihon was paid with a one-third ownership interest in the business. At some point, Monihon bought out his partners and became sole owner. He operated the business for ten years. He was on the board of supervisors in 1874, and was nominated to run in the first mayoral election as the Republican candidate after Phoenix was incorporated in 1881. He lost by seven votes but was elected councilman the next year. He left Phoenix for a period of six years but returned from the east in 1889 and became chairman of the board of directors of the Insane Asylum of Phoenix which had opened two years earlier. The next year, he built a large building on part of the stable grounds. The Monihon building was at the time considered \\"the finest edifice in Arizona\\". It was torn down in the mid-1930s. Mayor He ran for Phoenix mayor a second time in 1892, being unanimously nominated at the Republican city convention, and was again defeated, this time losing 268 to 198. Monihon continued to be active in the party, and organized \\"the greatest political gathering in the territory\\", a rally of the Republican party in Maricopa County in September 1892. He was victorious in his third run in May 1894, winning by a large majority of 388 to 234 and leading a Republican sweep of all positions in the city election. He failed to win the Republican nomination in 1895 to Pierce Evans who lost the election to the Democrat candidate. Monihon regained the Republican nomination and won the next election in June, 1896 by a vote of 268 to 238. He received the party nomination again in 1899, but not the endorsement of the Arizona Republican, which endorsed every other Republican on the ticket for city offices. He lost the election. As mayor, he spoke at a ceremony marking the completion of the Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railway in March 1895 and presented a gold key to the Vice President of the railroad in appreciation for connecting Phoenix with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway network via Prescott and on to the mainline at Prescott Junction. Personal life Cover art of a 1891 invitation from Monihon to a Phoenix Fire Department fundraiser masquerade ball Monihon married Josie C. Linville of Santa Rosa, California on March 15, 1877. The union produced one daughter, Rebecca Ann. He was a charter member of Phoenix Engine Company #1, Phoenix's first volunteer fire department that was formed in 1886 and was a bucket brigade captain and has been called the \\"father\\" of the Phoenix Fire Department. Organizations Monihon had an extensive association with Masonry, being a member of the lodge, chapter, commandery, and Mystic Shrine. He served for three terms as grand marshal of the Grand Lodge. He was a member and commander of the Civil War veterans' fraternal organization, Grand Army of the Republic lodge and was a delegate to the 1889 \\"National Encampment\\" in Boston. Death Monihon died in his home September 2, 1904, in Phoenix.

It has rough flaky or tessellated bark on most or all of the trunk, smooth bark above, lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven and urn-shaped fruit. Description Corymbia serendipita is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has thin, rough, flaky to tessellated bark on part or all of the trunk, smooth powdery white to cream-coloured or grey bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have lance-shaped green leaves that are paler on the lower surface, long and wide. Adult leaves are dull light green to greyish green, paler on the lower surface, lance-shaped or curved, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a thin, branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, about long and wide with a rounded operculum, sometimes with a small point in the centre. Flowering has been observed in February. The fruit is a woody urn-shaped capsule long and wide with a short neck and the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming This bloodwood was first formally described in 1994 by Ian Brooker and David Kleinig and given the name Eucalyptus serendipita. The description was published in their book Field Guide to Eucalypts, Volume 3, from specimens they collected near Forsayth in 1992. In 2002, Anthony Bean changed the name to Corymbia serendipita in the journal Austrobaileya. Distribution and habitat Corymbia serendipita grows in thin sandy soil on sandstone hills on the ranges between Georgetown, Einasleigh and Forsayth and south to the White Mountains.

The fifth ship of this type to be built by the French Navy, she was designed to the norms set for ships of the line by French shipbuilders in the 1740s to try to match the cost, armament and maneuverability of their British counterparts, since the Royal Navy had had a greater number of ships than the French since the end of the wars of Louis XIV.Martine Acerra and André Zysberg, L’essor des marines de guerre européennes : 1680-1790, Paris, éditions SEDES, coll. « Regards sur l'histoire », 1997, 298 p. (), pages 90-91 Without being standardized, dozens of French 74-gun ships were based on these norms right up until the start of the 19th century, slowly evolving to match new shipbuilding technologies and the wishes of naval tacticians and strategists. Her 74 guns comprised 28 x 36-pounders on the lower deck, 30 x 18-pounders on the upper deck, 10 x 8-pounders on the quarterdeck and 6 x 8-pounders on the forecastle. Service =War of the Austrian Succession= Intrépide fought at the Second Battle of Cape Finisterre on 25 October 1747, forming part of Henri- François des Herbiers's division, which also included the admiral's flagship the 80-gun , the 74-gun Monarque and Terrible, four 56-to-68 gun ships and a 26-gun frigate. They were charged with escorting a convoy of over 250 merchant vessels to the Antilles and faced Edward Hawke and his 14-ship squadron. The engagement lasted nearly seven hours and saw six French ships captured. Heading the French line and captained by the experienced commander de Vaudreuil, Intrépide was little damaged, since she was the last ship attacked by the British squadron. She escaped her pursuers and saved Tonnant, allowing her to disengage. The following dawn Intrépide managed to take Tonnant in tow. Their success was not only down to their commanders but also the fact that they were new powerful ships, easier to handle and with more modern armament than older ships in the British and French fleets. They arrived at Brest on 9 November 1747 whilst the convoy safely reached the Antilles. She was used as the test-bed for an inclining experiment (the first such ever recorded) which was performed in May 1748 by François-Guillaume Clairain-Deslauriers. =Seven Years' War= In 1756 Intrépide was put under the command of Guy François de Kersaint and made the flagship of a fleet charged with capturing all British ships operating off the coast of Guinea. This proved a success and Intrépide moved to the Antilles, where she was attacked near Caicos on 21 October 1757 by three British ships in the Battle of Cap-Français. This lasted several hours and Intrépide was almost completely dismasted, whilst her captain was wounded twice, though she managed to force the British ships to retreat. In 1759 she joined a twenty-one ship invasion fleet under maréchal de Conflans. She took part in the Battle of Les Cardinaux on 20 November that year under the command of Charles Le Mercerel de Chasteloger, joining in her attack on the British flagship . On the day after the French defeat Intrépide and seven other ships left the combat area to take refuge at Rochefort. Intrépide subsequently underwent a rebuilding at Brest from 1758 to April 1759, carried out by Léon-Michel Guignace. =American Revolutionary War= From January 1776 to March 1778 Intrépide was commanded by François Joseph Paul de Grasse. She took part in the Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778 under the command of Châteauvert in the blue squadron, which formed the French fleet's rearguard and was commanded by Louis-Philippe d'Orléans. In 1780 she joined Guichen's fleet sent to fight in the Antilles. On 17 April 1780, under the command of Parscau-Plessix, she fought in the battle of Martinique, again in the rearguard. She was finally lost on 22 July 1781 off Cap français, when a barrel of local rum caught fire and the ship was burned and sunk. Several crew members drowned.

At the time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993, it had been under cultivation by members of the Ballard family for more than 200 years, having been established in 1788 by a sale from Ira Allen to Joseph Ballard. Description and history The Ballard Farm stands in a rural area of central southern Georgia, on more than of land on Ballard Road near Town Highway 6 (Decker Road). The historic core of the farm is a parcel located mostly west of Ballard Road and south of Decker Road. The property has about each of pasture and cropland, with the balance, the westernmost portion, in steeply sloped woodlands. The farmstead consists of a cluster of buildings on either side of Ballard Road just south of the junction. The farmhouse is set on the east side of the road facing west, and is a 2-1/2 story brick I-house with Greek Revival features. Doors and windows are set in openings with marble sills and lintels. The main entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a transom window with X-shaped dividers. A wood-frame ell, like the main block topped by a gable roof, extends to the rear. Across the street from the house stand two late 19th- century barns, along with an array of other mostly 20th-century buildings. The oldest outbuilding, now serving as a garage, was built about 1800 as an icehouse. with Joseph Ballard was one of the first settlers of Georgia, purchasing the original 100-acre parcel from Ira Allen, the first white owner of the land, in 1788. Ballard purchased a single acre to the east (across what is now Ballard Road) where he built his first house. The wood-frame ell of the present brick house contains within it the elements of a house built about 1800. Now mainly a dairy operation, use of the farm by various generations of Ballards followed common trends in Vermont agriculture, beginning with generalized use, and eventually transitioning to sheep farming before turning to dairy farming. The family's success is reflective in the regular acquisition of land over time.

It was succeeded by the present-day Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College. History After William Wyggeston's death in 1536, his brother Thomas Wyggeston, as a trustee, used part of the money to establish a school for boys known as the Elizabethan Grammar School. This eventually became defunct in the 19th century, but was re-founded on the site of the old Wyggeston Hospital as the Wyggeston Hospital School, which took its first pupils on 30 April 1877. This school passed its name to the later Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys. In 1927, new buildings were built, designed by James Miller. In 1970/1971, the school won the national Top of the Form radio quiz show, beating Harris Academy, Dundee, in the final on 2 January 1971. After the reorganisation of local government, the system of education in the City of Leicester became comprehensive, and the school closed in 1976 to be replaced by other schools, including the Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College. Wyggeston Grammar School for Girls, also known as Wyggeston Girls' Grammar School, was founded not long after the boys' school and also closed in 1976. Its site was re-used for the Wyggeston Collegiate Sixth Form College, known as Regent College, Leicester, between 1996 and 2018, when it was absorbed into Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College.

The energy of light is used to change for shape and chemical properties of the drug, resulting in different biological activity. This is done to ultimately achieve control when and where drugs are active in a reversible manner, to prevent side effects and exposure to the environment of antibiotics. Switching drugs 'on' and 'off' is achieved by introducing photoswitches such as azobenzene, spiropyran or diarylethene into the drug. By introducing the photoswitch, the drug has two different states between which can be switched with light. Since both states have a different structure, the activity of the drug is different hence the 'on' and 'off' state of the drug An example is photostatin, which is an inhibitor that can be switched on and off in vivo, to optically control microtubule dynamics.

Located prominently on Ridge Street atop Seminary Hill, this 1872 Second Empire building has been a major visual and architectural landmark in the city since its construction. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural significance in 1975. Description and history College Hall is located near the top of a hill east of downtown Montpelier, that was given the name Seminary Hill after the Vermont Methodist Conference established the campus of its seminary there in 1866. The site was chosen because of its proximity to railroad service, and to the state's center of government; it had previously housed a military hospital during the American Civil War. College Hall was built between 1868 and 1872 at a cost of $50,000, and has been in educational use ever since. It was operated exclusively as the Vermont Seminary until 1936, when Vermont Junior College was given space in the seminary facilities. The seminary closed its doors in 1947. Vermont Junior College was reorganized as Vermont College in 1958 and merged into Norwich University in 1972. The university used the campus to establish a fine arts program, which was later sold to the Union Institute. The Vermont College of Fine Arts was established in 2008. College Hall is a cruciform masonry building, built out of load- bearing brick walls set on a foundation of rubblestone faced in cut granite. It is four stories in height, covered with a mansard roof. The long street- facing facade is eleven bays wide, with the central three projecting. The projecting section has round-arch windows, including two-story windows in the second and third floors, where the chapel is located. The flanking wings have round-arch windows in the first floor and the mansarded fourth floor, with segmented-arch windows on the second and third levels. The entrance is in the center bay, which projects slightly further, and is topped by a tower rising five stories, also with a mansard roof. The building corners have brick quoining, and there is a beltcourse of brickwork above the first floor. The roof eaves are studded with modillions. with See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Vermont References External links *Vermont College of Fine Arts web site Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont Category:National Register of Historic Places in Washington County, Vermont Category:Second Empire architecture in Vermont Category:School buildings completed in 1868 Category:Buildings and structures in Montpelier, Vermont Category:Vermont College of Fine Arts Category:1868 establishments in Vermont ","title":"College Hall (Montpelier, Vermont)"},{"id":"51934562","text":"Irati Idirin Egaña (born 13 May 1994) is a Spanish professional racing cyclist, who currently rides for Spanish amateur team Murias–Limousin.
