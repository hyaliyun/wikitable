Early life and education Cullen was born at Mount Johnston, near Jamberoo, New South Wales, the seventh son of John and Rebecca (n√©e Clinton) Cullen. A brother, Joseph Cullen, was a Member of Parliament for both New South Wales and Western Australia. William was educated at country state schools, including Kiama, and the University of Sydney, where he won a scholarship. William Cullen graduated B.A. with first class honours in classics in 1880, M.A. in 1882, LL.B. in 1885 and LL.D. in 1887. During his university career he won the University, Lithgow, Barker, and Renwick scholarships, and the John Smith prize. Legal career Cullen was called to the bar in 1883 and his progress at first was slow. But, he eventually took high rank at the equity bar, and argued with much success before the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the High Court of Australia (an institution whose creation he had vigorously supported). He became a KC in 1905. He regularly appeared in the High Court, and was considered one of the leading barristers appearing in the High Court, including appearing in R v Governor of South Australia; Ex parte Vardon, Union Label case,. and the Steel Rails case. Political career Cullen entered politics in 1891 when he was elected a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Camden. He was defeated at the 1894 election, and in 1895 was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council. Though not a strong party man, or even a politician by temperament, he was a useful member of the house who never spoke unless he could contribute something constructive to the debate. Cullen was a Federationist. University of Sydney His chief interest from his undergraduate days was the University of Sydney; he was elected a member of the university senate in 1896, vice-chancellor in 1908, and chancellor in 1914. During his early days in the Legislative Council he introduced a bill embodying important reforms in the conduct of the university, although some of these were not brought into effect until many years after. He was elected term after term as chancellor, and when he resigned on account of his health and his advanced age in December 1934, he had been in office for a longer period than any previous chancellor, during a time of great expansion. Judicial career In January 1910 he was appointed Chief Justice of New South Wales in succession to Sir Frederick Darley, and in March was appointed Lieutenant-Governor. Cullen found much business awaiting him at the Supreme Court, but his great capacity for work soon cleared up the arrears. He was a very sound equity and constitutional lawyer who as chief justice worthily upheld the traditions of his court. Cullen was courteous and considerate to juniors appearing before him, and could hold his own with the most experienced barristers. He had great conscientiousness, excellent knowledge of the law and sound judgment, and consequently his judgments were seldom upset.Fuller B.C. \\"Obituary Sir William Cullen\\". (1935) 9 Australian Law Journal 24. Late life Cullen retired as Chief Justice in January 1925 but retained the position of Lieutenant-Governor until September 1930. He administered the State of NSW on several occasions during the absence of governors from the State or between appointments. He died at Leura on 6 April 1935. He married in 1891 Lily, eldest daughter of the Hon. R. H. D. White, who died in 1931. He was survived by two sons and a daughter. He was knighted in 1911 and created KCMG in 1912. Cullen was interested in literature, in the Australian flora (Eucalyptus cullenii was named for him), and in social and philanthropic movements.

It was released in 1976 on their album 2112. Released in 1976, the song follows the album's title song 2112. With the album's title track comprising the first half of the record, \\"A Passage to Bangkok\\" opens the second side of the album (on the original LP and audio cassette). Composition The song is in the key of E minor and is played in 4/4 time. Guitarist Alex Lifeson said in 2009 that the Led Zeppelin song \\"Kashmir\\" inspired \\"A Passage to Bangkok\\". Lyrics The song's lyrics, written by drummer Neil Peart, are widely interpreted as describing drug tourism, specifically cannabis. The lyrics employ innuendo, eschewing naming any actual drugs. The song describes visiting Colombia, Mexico, Jamaica, Morocco, Thailand, Afghanistan, \\"golden Acapulco nights\\" (a reference to Acapulco Gold), Nepal, and Lebanon. Mention is made of \\"smoke rings\\", \\"pipe dreams\\", various fragrances, and welcoming natives who \\"pass along\\" their unspecified \\"yield\\". Lifeson said: > This piece is about a fun little journey to all the good places you could go > to have a puff. We thought it would be kind of fun to write a song about > that, and Neil did it in a very eloquent way, I think. That song was > probably written in a farmhouse, on an acoustic guitar, in front of a little > cassette player of some sort. We would record like that and then go down in > the basement and rehearse it. In the documentary Classic Albums Presents the Making of 2112 & Moving Pictures (2010), Peart states the intent was to be \\"light in tone and write some funny songs\\" when discussing \\"A Passage to Bangkok\\". In the film, Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, Rush producer Terry Brown, and Peart explain and demonstrate the subtleties in the song that make it a tongue-in-cheek reference to drug use in the 1970s. Reception Ultimate Classic Rock ranked \\"A Passage to Bangkok\\" number 16 on their list of \\"All 167 Rush Songs Ranked Worst to Best\\", writing that it is \\"one of the sharpest vocal melodies the band wrote pre-1980, and it's a load of fun as a lyric\\". They thought it was the best song on 2112. Odyssey rated the song 4.5/5, and wrote that it begins with an amazing riff by Lifeson. They also called Geddy Lee's vocals in the song calm but impressive. They also ranked it number 61 on their ranking of every Rush song. Greg Prato of AllMusic chose \\"A Passage to Bangkok\\" as one of the album's highlights.

It is consistently ranked as the top performing high school in Macomb County. History Opened in 1972, Eisenhower is one of two public high school located in Shelby Township. Until the 1990s, the school had a Washington Township mailing address. As the surrounding area began to develop, the city limits changed and the school fell into Shelby Township boundaries. The original design of the school had few windows and no walls in the individual wings, giving the school an open concept. This open concept failed, as multiple classes could be heard at the same time. The building was quickly segmented into its current classroom structure. When the school opened, the surrounding area was rural and there were no paved roads within miles of the school. Today, the surrounding area is suburban (a part of Metro Detroit), and has subdivisions and strip-malls within the school's immediate proximity. Over the years, Eisenhower has received several renovations. In 2002, the restrooms adjacent to the Commons were extensively renovated. In 2004, the current media center and library were constructed. The following year, in 2005, the Performing Arts Center (PAC) was constructed on the easternmost side of the school. Competitions Eisenhower's Quiz Bowl team has won four state championships (the 1989, 1992, and 2000 Michigan State Championship Quiz Bowl and the 2000 Michigan NAQT State Championship Tournament) and two national championships (the 1990 and 2000 American Scholastics Competition Network Tournament of Champions). Eisenhower's Varsity Dance Team has earned top honors multiple times in regional competitions, as well as the UDA National Dance Team Championship under coach Rachelle Kiehle. Since 2009, the team has been consistently ranked in the top three dance teams in the nation, placing first in the Jazz category in 2014.http://987ampradio.cbslocal.com/2016/02/03/congrats-to-the-eisenhower- high-schools-varsity-dance-team-for-bringing-home-national-medals/ In 2015 the team placed first in Hip Hop and second in Jazz, while Eisenhower's Junior Varsity Dance Team scored their first National championship with their Pom routine and took third place in Jazz.

Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. For the class of 2019, a Composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, passing a civics and government exam will be added to the graduation requirements.Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Board of Education Finalizes Adoption of Pennsylvania Common Core State Academic Standards and High School Graduation Requirements, March 14, 2013 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams.

The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Greater Johnstown High School offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools.

Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that Districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Greater Johnstown School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. A nurses is available in the high school building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day.

All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3.

She was also: * President of the Medical Women‚Äôs Federation (1982-1983) * President of the Faculty of Community Medicine of the Royal College of Physicians (1986-1989) * President of the British Medical Association (1990-1991) * Founding Fellow of Green College, Oxford * Awarded the Edward Jenner Medal of the Royal Society of Medicine (2001) Background Elsie Rosemary Laurence was born in 1928 in Hutton, Essex in England and moved with her family to London in 1933. She was evacuated in 1940 during The Blitz to stay with relatives in Devonshire, where she contracted tuberculosis and peritonitis. It was while she was convalescing that she decided on a career in medicine, entering the all-woman Royal Free Medical School in London in 1945. In 1950 she married Roger Rue, a pilot instructor of Belgian descent in the Royal Air Force. When she told the medical school dean that she was changing her name, she was told that she could not stay at the school if she was married. She was instead accepted at the University of Oxford, qualifying in 1951 after taking the University of London exams. Her first job was at an extended-care hospital in Oxford. She did not tell her employers that she had a husband or a newborn son, as many hospitals then didn't employ married women. She was eventually sacked when her employers learned she was married with children. In 1954, she contracted polio from a patient, becoming the last person in Oxford to get it. Polio gave her the major, lifelong disability of having one bad leg. This left her unable to walk, even with crutches, or perform basic tasks such as carrying a medical bag. She spent time teaching at girls' schools. Unable to walk up front steps for interviews, she had to turn down several medical jobs. New hospitals were constructed in Swindon, Reading and Milton Keynes, with basic modules that could be incorporated into every hospital. In 1960, she was named Assistant County Medical Officer for Hertfordshire and worked as a part-time paediatrician in Watford. She spent an academic term at the Institute of Child Health in London. In 1965, she was offered the job of Senior Assistant Medical Officer for the Oxford region, running that region's health authority. In the early 1960s new money was allocated by the government to rebuild the crumbling medical system in the UK. Dr Rue ensured that Oxford got a fair share. Later positions In 1972 she became one of the founders of the Faculty of Community Health (now the Faculty of Public Health), which brought together academic bodies such as the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, community health doctors, and organisations such as the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS). She served as the PHLS Regional Medical Officer from 1973‚Äì84, and Regional General Manager from 1984‚àí88. Death In her last few years, Dame Rosemary continued to take an active interest in health service matters, despite both breast and colon cancer. She died, aged 76, at her cottage in Stanton St John, Oxfordshire on Christmas Eve 2004, aged 76. She was survived by her two sons.Biography, livesonline.rcseng.ac.uk; accessed 26 October 2015.

Published weekly in print from 1915 to 2012, it became independently operated in 1956.UWM Post advertising section, UWM Post. Retrieved May 17, 2007. The newspaper published a new issue every Monday during the fall and spring semesters and was distributed both on campus and in the Greater Milwaukee metropolitan area. Once the largest independent college weekly in Wisconsin, the newspaper ended its print run in 2012, though it is published online. History The UWM Post was formally founded with that title in 1956 after the merger of the Wisconsin State College - Milwaukee and UW Extension Milwaukee division merged that year to form the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. The paper is ultimately descended from the publications of both schools and had frequently cited 1915 and 1888 as its founding year. It was the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee's unofficial campus news outlet and served as the primary source of student news, collegiate athletics and on- and off-campus events and issues for students and alumni. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, it competed with other campus papers, including the UWM Times, the Sun and the Leader. An independent student-run news outlet, the UWM Post was governed by a five-member Board of Directors elected by the staff, with the editor in chief serving as chair. The Board was responsible for financial solvency of the newspaper, employment and management decisions, and daily operations. The UWM Post during its period of dominance served as the primary on-campus opportunity for students in journalism, graphic design, marketing and business administration. In addition, the paper was an active member of the community through sponsoring educational and social events and supporting non-profit organizations. The UWM Post maintained national affiliations with UWIRE, the Associated Collegiate Press, the Student Press Law Center and the Society for Professional Journalists. It has won awards from the American Scholastic Press Association, Wisconsin Newspaper Association, Society for Professional Journalists and a Best of Show award from the Associated Collegiate Press. The UWM Post‚Äôs coverage on events and issues was regularly cited in student and other publications. At its peak, the Post produced Monday and Thursday editions with press runs of 10,000 to 15,000 copies each Monday and Thursday during the fall and spring semesters, plus summer issues. Seventy-five percent of the newspapers were distributed on the UWM campus, with the remaining newspapers disseminated to locations throughout the East Side, Riverwest, downtown, Bay View and north side neighborhoods. Cessation of print format (2012) The UWM Post printed its last print issue in November 2012. Because of lack of steady revenue, the Post cut its paper edition and ended salaries. An online-exclusive edition was launched in spring 2013. Litigation The UWM Post has been party to numerous lawsuits over the years. These included at least two lawsuits brought by former staff against the paper over its control and resources. Other legal actions saw the Post as plaintiff seeking to influence public policy. In 1991, the Post was lead plaintiff in an ACLU-supported action against the University of Wisconsin Regents which resulted in the declaration that the university's campus speech codes were unconstitutional. On November 11, 2009, the UWM Post and former editor in chief Jonathan Anderson filed a lawsuit against the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee claiming the university violated Wisconsin's public records law by redacting records the UWM Post requested regarding the university's Union Policy Board. The university argued it redacted the records pursuant to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a federal student privacy law, because students were members of the board. The newspaper contended that the university was over-complying with FERPA and misinterpreting the law's intent. The dispute was settled out of court, with the university agreeing to release all the records requested. Kevin Lessmiller won the 2010 Wisconsin Newspaper Association's Freedom of Information Award for his coverage of the lawsuit.

The rebellion aimed to force the Spanish Governor, Antonio de Ulloa, to leave New Orleans and return to Spain, but his replacement, General Alejandro O'Reilly, was able to crush the rebellion, execute five of its ringleaders, and firmly establish Spanish law in the territory. Background In the Treaty of Paris at the conclusion of the global Seven years War, known in America as the French and Indian Wars, France lost all of its territories on the North America continent including Canada, Illinois Country and Louisiana. It got to keep its French West Indies islands in the Caribbean and also the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. Great Britain acquired Canada and all the land on the east bank of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. As compensation from losses elsewhere, France handed over control of New Orleans and all the land on the west bank of the Mississippi River and its tributaries to their Spanish allies. Implementation of the turnover was slow in North America with the French continuing to expand its villages including founding St. Louis. In April 1764 the first Spanish governor, Jean- Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie, a French official who was administering Louisiana for the Spanish, took office and heard complaints from among the natives. d'Abbadie died from illness on February 4, 1765. The senior military officer in the colony Captain Charles Philippe Aubry, a French officer, assumed control and continued to administer the colony for Spain. After a mass meeting in January 1765, Jean Milhet, a rich and influential New Orleans merchant, was sent to France to appeal directly to Louis XV to rescind the decision to transfer Louisiana to the Spanish crown, but the King would not grant him an audience.Powell (2012), pp.136, 143-44 On March 5, 1766, Antonio de Ulloa, the new Spanish governor, arrived, but brought with him only 90 soldiers and a small group of bureaucrats. Having insufficient military support if there were to be an insurrection, he did not present his credentials and did not formally accept the handing over of the territory, not even raising the Spanish flag over the Place d'Armes. Instead, he decided to run the colony through Aubrey, the interim French governor.Powell (2012), p.135 Ulloa finally took formal possession of the colony in late January 1767, in an impromptu ceremony held at La Balize, Louisiana; however, he changed his mind the next day when it came time to sign the act of transfer, saying he would wait to do so when he had sufficient military support on hand. The elite of New Orleans were displeased at Ulloa's actions, especially as the transfer ceremony did not take place in New Orleans, the colony's capital, with what they saw as the necessary pomp. They were also confused that the French fleur-de-lis flag still flew over the city while the Spanish flag flew over La Balize.Powell (2012), p.140 Ulloa's superiors in Havana virtually ignored his many requests, including replacing the colony's French currency with pesos, and the dispatch of more soldiers. Although fluent in French, Ulloa disliked New Orleans society, which he considered to be full of boors who drank too much and were profligate with their money. A Renaissance man, scholar, and naturalist who also studied cartography, astronomy, and engineering, Ullola preferred to spend his time at La Balize, nearer to the mouth of the Mississippi River, where he could live a simpler life studying the area's flora and fauna and corresponding with scientists and scholars from all over the world.Powell (2012), pp.134‚Äì35,139‚Äì40 In the summer of 1768, Ulloa announced plans to crack down on Louisiana's considerable smuggling operations by reducing the mouth of the Mississippi to a single channel to improve security; officially he spent his time at La Balize supervising the engineering of the project.Powell (2012), p.140 At the same time, he also announced that Louisiana would no longer trade with France or any of its colonies, consistent with policy in other Spanish possessions. Rebellion In the spring or early summer of 1768, Denis-Nicolas Foucault, who was Louisiana's commaissaire-ordonnateur - the chief financial officer of the colony - under the French, and had continued the position under the Spanish during the transition, and Nicolas Chauvin de La Fr√©ni√®re, who was the Louisiana attorney general under the French and also continuing under the Spanish, hatched a plot to force the governor out. Most of the complaints of the plotters, who included many of the colony's merchants and other elites, concerned restrictions on trade and other economic issues. The conspirators included many relatives, descendants, and in-laws of Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, the father of New Orleans, and many of the insurrectionists were members of, or connected with, the Superior Council, created by the French as the colony's chief judicial institution, which gradually - because of lax control of the colony by Paris - had become as much a legislative entity as a legal one.Powell (2012), pp.39,144-45 Joseph Milhet - the brother of Jean Milhet - was sent to villages west of the Mississippi to stir insurrection. Joseph Viller√© went to communities northwest of New Orleans. Pierre Marquis was declared leader of the Louisiana militia. In the process, the conspirators arrested the French military officer Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent on charges of collaborating with the enemy when Governor Ulloa sent him to the German Coast to reassure the settlers there. Balthasar Masan went to the British territory of West Florida to request aid, which the British rejected.Powell (2012), pp.145-6 On October 28, as riots broke out in New Orleans, Aubry escorted the governor and his pregnant wife to the Volante, the flagship packet boat on which he had arrived in the colony. The Superior Council voted that the governor must leave within three days. He complied, leaving on November 1 in a French vessel, as the Volante was undergoing repairs.Powell (2012), pp.148-49 With the Spanish governor out of Louisiana, St. Maxent was also released. The Superior Council drew up the Memorial of the Planters and Mechants of Louisiana on the Revolt of October 29, 1768, a defense of their actions based on Ulloa's supposed tyrannical rule and the commerce-destroying policies of the Spanish crown. It was intended for consumption both in New Orleans and in France, but they delayed in sending a delegation carrying it across the Atlantic. They did not arrive in Paris until 1769, by which time the version of events as described by Ulloa - who sent his to Madrid as soon after setting foot in Cuba from New Orleans - and Aubrey - who sent his m√©moire to Paris at about the same time - had become the accepted history. While the Parisian people supported the Superior Council's actions, the French court did not. Many officials refused to see the delegates from Louisiana at all, and none of them ever returned to the colony.Powell (2012), pp.149-50 Spanish response Around July 6, 1769 the Irish-born Spanish general Alexander (Alejandro) O'Reilly - who fought for the Catholic armies of Austria, France, and Spain against the armies of the European Porotestant powersPowell (2012), p.154 - sailed to Louisiana with 23 ships, loaded with 46 cannons, 150,000 pesos, and almost 2,100 soldiers, both black and white, who he recruited in Cuba. The flotilla was headed by Ulloa's Volante, which now served as O'Reilly's flagship. They reached La Balize on July 21. There, O'Reilly landed Francisco Bouligny, his French-speaking aide- de-camp, who carried a letter for Governor Aubrey. Bouligny headed upstream to New Orleans, arriving there on the evening of July 24. He was met by a somber crowd, who had been alerted to his imminent arrival by a fast boat sent by the garrison at La Balize. The following morning, Aubrey assembled the people of the city, formally announcing the arrival of a Spanish armada of ships commanded by General O'Reilly, whose reputation was well known to them.Powell (2012), pp.154-55 On July 27, O'Reilly had a \\"cordial\\" meeting on Volante at La Balize with three leaders of the conspiracy, La Fr√©ni√®re, Pierre Marquis and Joseph Milhet. La Fr√©ni√®re declared their profound respect for the Spanish king and noted that no blood had been shed in the rebellion. He blamed Ulloa's \\"subversion of the privileges assures by the act of cession\\" for making the rebellion necessary. O'Reilly's reply was succinct: \\"Gentlemen, it is not possible for me to judge things without first finding out about the prior circumstances.\\" He pledged that he would hold a thorough invenstigation, and that \\"seditious people\\" would be brought to justice.Powell (2012), pp.155-56 O'Reilly's flotilla arrived in New Orleans after several weeks sailing upstream. O'Reilly disembarked on August 18, having previously met with Aubrey to tell him that he wished to hold the ceremony of taking formal possession of Louisiana as soon as he arrived. A cannon shot announced the beginning of the spectacle, which included the disembarking of all of O'Reilly's troops, which included 90 horsemen. Spanish officials who had remained in New Orleans when Ulloa left joined O'Reilly's entourage. Aubrey read out the transfer orders fro the kings of France and Spain, and laid the keys to the city's gates at O'Reilly's feet. The French flag was formally lowered and the Spanish flag raised, and artillery and musket fire rang out., while French and Spanish soldiers cried \\"Long live the Kings!.\\" The ceremony concluded with a Te Deum in the cathedral.Powell (2012), pp.156-57 Aftermath The next morning, August 19, O'Reilly requested of Aubrey a full account of the rebellion, providing the names of the ring-leaders and their deeds, and the authors of the 'Memorial of the Planters and Merchants'. This Aubrey gave to O'Reilly on the following day. On the morning of the 21st, after reading Aubrey's document, O'Reilly informed him that he planned to arrest and try the leaders, nine of whom were invited to his quarters under various pretexts. O\\"Reilly accused them of treason, and told them they were arrested. They gave up their swords and were escorted away.Powell (2012), pp.157-58 Because of the many family and commercial connections between the conspirators and the rest of New Orleans' elites and merchants, there was much trepidation among concerning what would happen to them. O'Reilly put them at ease by telling them that he wanted to administer \\"precise justice\\", and that they had nothing to fear. He posted an amnesty proclamation on the 22nd, and another on the 24th telling free inhabitants to come to his residence on the 26th to swear loyalty to the Spanish crown.Powell (2012), p.158 The trial itself began shortly after the conspirators were arrested, and did not conclude until October 24. Its form was the Spanish 'proceso', in which depositions of witnesses were followed by interrogation of the accused. Each one had an advocate appointed for them, even Joseph Viller√©, who had died, because a finding of guilty could affect the disposition of his estate. A painstaking royal prosecutor and a university-trained advocate who had come with O'Reilly from Havana conducted the proceedings. O'Reilly's aide-de-camp, Bouligny, was the official translator. The defendants argued that they could not be tried under Spanish law, because Ulloa had never formally received possession of the colony, an argument which they lost. The result of the trial was finding of sedition and treason for all the defendants.Powell (2012), p.158-159 O'Reilly handed down his sentence a few days after the end of the trial. Five of the accused - La Fr√©ni√®re, Marquis, Joseph Milhet, Pierre Caresse, and Jean-Baptiste de Noyan - were sentenced to death on October 25 and were executed by firing squad on October 26; this would also have been Viller√©'s fate if he had not died. Foucault, who was a French official, was sent back to France, where he was interrogated and then given an indefinite prison sentence, of which he served two years. Five other plotters were sent to prison in Cuba, one for life, two for 10 years, and the rest for 6 years. They were released after two years. All of the property of the condemned men - except for their dowries - was confiscated. Twenty-one other conspirators were banished from Louisiana, although one, an aging man, was allowed to live out the rest of his life in New Orleans.Powell (2012), p.159 One month after the executions, O'Reilly promulgated new laws for the colony, known as \\"O'Reilly's Code\\" or \\"Code O'Reilly\\". It combined the Laws of the Indies with O'Reilly's understanding of the Castilian-derived laws of Spain - the Siete Partidas or \\"Seven-Part Code\\" - but left in place colloquial French legal procedures which were consonant with Spanish law. The administrative and judicial systems were overhauled, and the courts were decentralized, putting local justices in place and abolishing the Superior Council, the members of which were largely responsible for the rebellion. It was replaced by the Cabildo, a council which was used throughout Spanish America.Powell (2012), pp.166,225\\"History of the Codes of Louisiana: Code of Civil Procedure\\" The Law Library of Louisiana The territory remained in Spanish hands until 1800, when on paper it was returned to France following the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. However, Spanish officials continued to administer the colony. In April 1803, Napoleon sold La Louisiane to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase, in exchange for money and the cancellation of French debts. Late in 1803 and in the spring of 1804, both of these transfers were formalized back-to-back, with the French flag being raised temporarily in New Orleans and again later in St. Louis. Then the French flag was lowered and the American flag raised. The 1804 ceremony in St. Louis, was called Three Flags Day. Elements of French law still remain in the state of Louisiana.

Points of interest =Kushumba Mosque= ;Location On the west bank of Atrai river, under the Manda upazila of Naogaon district, the mosque named Kusumba is situated. ;History Kusumba Mosque is named after the village Kusumba. It was built during the period of Afgan rule in Bangladesh by a high-ranking official named Sulaiman. It was built under one of the last Suri rulers. His name was Ghiyasuddin Bahadur Shah.Although the mosque was built under the suri rule, the architectural pattern was not influenced by the earlier Suri architecture of North India. It was constructed with a Bengal style. At the eastern central entrance, inscription mentioned the time period of construction of the mosque to 966 AH (1558-59 AD). ;Current Condition The mosque was badly damaged during the earthquake in 1987. Kushumba mosque is also known as Kala Pahar, Kala Rotno which means Black Pearl. Possible reason: During the massive earthquake of 1897 the mosque was damaged severely, but stood firmly. Another reason can be for such name is the black plaster of stones at the outer wall. Now the mosque is protected by the Department of Archaeology of Bangladesh. The mosque is an attraction that is marveled at and studied, due its wonderful architectural style and elaborate decorations. ;Structure The mosque lies inside a walled enclosure with a monumental gateway with standing spaces for guards. The inscription tablet is totally in Arabic, except the part \\"built by\\" is in Persian.Walking up to the mosque, visitors will be greeted by a massive gateway, which is the only entrance to the mosque that is protected by a surrounding wall. One can almost imagine the guards outside, still protecting this breathtaking building. The foundation and most of the building was constructed from bricks, although the outer walls, some interior walls, side screens and columns are of stone. Bunches of grapes and vines curve in an almost serpentine manner on the mihrab frames, and kalasas, tendrils, and rosettes are reduced to dots. The platform edge has grape vine decoration, and there are rosettes on the spandrels of the arches supporting the platform, as well as on the mihrab wall. The central Mihrab is designed in the west. Opposite the central and southeastern entrances, the interior west wall has two mihrabs. There is division in the two mihrabs and they had different platforms. That is because the time of construction the general public was separated from officials and nobility during the prayers. =Manda Roghunath Jio Temple= =Pakuria Shaheed Nagor(killing Field)= =Shah Agriculture Museum= Manda has 14 unions/wards, 299 mauzas/mahallas, and 286 villages.

While Mayor of Waverley Council, Pearce was noted for his pony tail, but this was ruled out by Labor party organisers at the 2003 election. He was successful in being elected to the seat of Coogee in 2003 and subsequently was re-elected in 2007. At the 2011 state election, Pearce lost the seat of Coogee to Liberal Party candidate and former City of Randwick Mayor Bruce Notley-Smith. Pearce was one of several Labor MPs from comfortably safe Labor seats who were swept out in the massive Coalition landslide that year. He'd previously held Coogee with a majority of seven percent, but was toppled on a 15 percent swing. He recontested the seat for Labor at the 2015 elections but whilst obtaining a substantial swing to Labor, he was unable to retake the seat.

Retrieved 15 November 2012 Plot summary The book tells the story of its main characters' final term at Cricklepit Combined School which is based on St. Sidwell's School Exeter where Gene Kemp taught. The book is principally narrated by 'Tyke' Tiler, a bold and athletic twelve- year-old with the reputation of being a troublemaker. Tyke's best friend Danny Price has a speech defect, which means Tyke often has to translate for him. Danny has a helpless air which leads him to depend on his often exasperated friend. When Tyke overhears some teachers discussing the possibility of Danny going to a special school next year, the only option seems to be to help Danny to cheat in the assessment test ‚Äì a plan which naturally backfires. When Tyke is off sick, Danny is accused of stealing a gold watch and runs away. It is up to Tyke to persuade the headmaster that Martin and Kevin are the guilty ones, and to find Danny. On the last day of school, Tyke decides to emulate Thomas Tiler, a relative, in climbing up the outside of the school and ringing the school bell, which has been silent for thirty years. When this ends in disaster the headmaster says: \\"That child has always appeared to me to be on the brink of wrecking this school, and as far as I can see, has, at last, succeeded.\\" Up to the end of the penultimate chapter the narrative is written without directly revealing the protagonist's sex. The daring nature of Tyke's exploits often leads readers to assume Tyke is a boy, though there are a few scattered clues to the contrary. The story ends with the revelation that Tyke is a girl, her full name being Theodora Tiler.

Themes In addition to the children's real-world adventures there is an emphasis throughout the book on chivalry and heroism. A student teacher reads T. H. White's The Once and Future King to the class, which they perform as a pantomime play, and they later re-enact a local battle between Saxons and Normans which appears to be the 1068 siege of Exeter. Both main characters are excited by the stories; Danny in particular is pleased to be compared to Sir Galahad, \\"His strength was as the strength of ten, because his heart was pure\\", and he resolves to live up to the comparison. Significance According to Mary Cadogan in Twentieth-Century Children's Writers, \\"This truly innovatory book gives new dimensions to the day-school story, and an authoritative boost to feminism. More convincingly than any other juvenile book it demolishes many accepted ideas about aspirational and experiential differences between boys and girls.\\" She added: \\"The exactly appropriate first person narrative is punctuated by consciously dire playground rhymes and jokes which sharpen its pacy succinctness.\\"Twentieth-Century Children's Writers, ed.

The distinguishing characteristic of precious corals is their durable and intensely colored red or pink-orange skeleton, which is used for making jewelry. Habitat Red corals grow on rocky seabottom with low sedimentation, typically in dark environments‚Äîeither in the depths or in dark caverns or crevices. The original species, C. rubrum (formerly Gorgonia nobilis), is found mainly in the Mediterranean Sea. It grows at depths from 10 to 300 meters below sea level, although the shallower of these habitats have been largely depleted by harvesting. In the underwater caves of Alghero, Sardinia (the \\"Coral Riviera\\") it grows at depth from 4 to 35 meters. The same species is also found at Atlantic sites near the Strait of Gibraltar, at the Cape Verde Islands and off the coast of southern Portugal. Other Corallium species are native to the western Pacific, notably around Japan and Taiwan; these occur at depths of 350 to 1500 meters below sea level in areas with strong currents. Anatomy In common with other Alcyonacea, red corals have the shape of small leafless bushes and grow up to a meter in height. Their valuable skeleton is composed of intermeshed spicules of hard calcium carbonate, colored in shades of red by carotenoid pigments. In living specimens, the skeletal branches are overlaid with soft bright red integument, from which numerous retractable white polyps protrude. The polyps exhibit octameric radial symmetry. Species The following are known species in the genus: As a gemstone The Queen Farida of Egypt red coral parure by Ascione, made in 1938 in Naples, Coral Jewellery Museum Chinese coral sculpture. Gift of Mr and Mrs Charles D. Field, 1988 and gift of Alice Meyer Buck, 1968. The hard skeleton of red coral branches is naturally matte, but can be polished to a glassy shine. It exhibits a range of warm reddish pink colors from pale pink to deep red; the word coral is also used to name such colors. Owing to its intense and permanent coloration and glossiness, precious coral skeletons have been harvested since antiquity for decorative use. Coral jewellery has been found in ancient Egyptian and prehistoric European burials, and continues to be made to the present day. It was especially popular during the Victorian age. Precious coral has hardness 3.5 on the Mohs scale. Due to its softness and opacity, coral is usually cut en cabochon, or used to make beads. History of trade 6-Strand Necklace, Navajo (Native American), ca. 1920s, Brooklyn Museum Non precious red dyed sponge coral earrings. Coral earrings. Polished fragments of fake dyed red bamboo coral (not precious coral). Red coral precious raw gemstone At the beginning of the 1st millennium, there was significant trade in coral between the Mediterranean and India, where it was highly prized as a substance believed to be endowed with mysterious sacred properties. Pliny the Elder remarks that, before the great demand from India, the Gauls used it for the ornamentation of their weapons and helmets; but by this period, so great was the Eastern demand, that it was very rarely seen even in the regions which produced it. Among the Romans, branches of coral were hung around children's necks to preserve them from danger from the outside, and the substance had many medicinal virtues attributed to it. The belief in coral's potency as a charm continued throughout the Middle Ages and early in 20th century Italy it was worn as a protection from the evil eye, and by women as a cure for infertility. From the Middle Ages onward, the securing of the right to the coral fisheries off the African coasts was the object of considerable rivalry among the Mediterranean communities of Europe. The story of the Torre del Greco is so interwoven with that of the coral so as to constitute an inseparable pair, and is documented as early as the fifteenth century. In 1790 the Royal Society of Coral was established in the town of Torre del Greco, with the idea of working and selling coral fish. This shows that the coral fishing flourished for many years in the city. It was also enacted December 22, 1789, by Ferdinand IV of Bourbon Code coral (prepared by the Neapolitan jurist Michael Florio), with the intent to regulate the coral fishing in those years starring, in addition to the sailors Torre del Greco, the locals and those in Trapani This regulation did not have the expected success. From 1805, when he founded the first factory for the manufacturing of coral in Torre del Greco (by Paul Bartholomew Martin, but with French Genoese origin), the golden age for the manufacturing of coral in the city situated on the slopes of the Vesuvius started, because working together with the coral fishing was increasingly under the control of Torre del Greco fishermen. Since 1875, the Torre del Greco began working with the Sciacca coral and a school for the manufacturing of coral was built in 1878 in the city (which closed in 1885 to reopen in 1887), with which in 1933 established a museum of the coral. Then came the time of processing of Japanese coral found in the markets of Madras and Calcutta. Other story instead a short period the Tunisian fisheries were secured by Charles V for Spain; but the monopoly soon fell into the hands of the French, who held the right until the Revolutionary government in 1793 threw the trade open. For a short period (about 1806) the British government controlled the fisheries, but this later returned to the hands of the French authorities. Before the French Revolution much of the coral trade was centred in Marseille, but then largely moved to Italy, where the procuring of the raw material and the working of it was centring in Naples, Rome and Genoa. In culture The origin of coral is explained in Greek mythology by the story of Perseus. Having petrified Cetus, the sea monster threatening Andromeda, Perseus placed Medusa's head on the riverbank while he washed his hands. When he recovered her head, he saw that her blood had turned the seaweed (in some variants the reeds) into red coral. Thus, the Greek word for coral is 'Gorgeia', as Medusa was one of the three Gorgons. Poseidon resided in a palace made of coral and gems, and Hephaestus first crafted his work from coral. The Romans believed coral could protect children from harm, as well as cure wounds made by snakes and scorpions and diagnose diseases by changing colour. * In Hindu astrology red coral is associated with the planet Mars or Graha-Mangala and used for pleasing Mars. It should be worn on the ring finger. * A branch of red coral figures prominently in the civic coat of arms of the town of Alghero, Italy. * In Islam coral is mentioned as one of the gems in paradise. * Amongst the Yoruba and Bini peoples of West Africa, red precious coral jewellery (necklaces, wristlets and anklets most especially) are signifiers of high social rank, and are worn as a result by titled kings and chieftains. Conservation Intensive fishing, particularly in shallow waters, has damaged this species along the Mediterranean coastline, where colonies at depths of less than 50 metres are much diminished. Fishing and now climate change threaten their persistence. The three oldest Mediterranean Marine Protected Areas--Banyuls, Carry-le-Rouet and Scandola, off the island of Corsica--all host substantial populations of C. rubrum. Since protection was established, colonies have grown in size and number at shallow and deeper depths.

Plot  A small, isolated tribe are cursed by spirits for their sins. One of the tribesmen crafts a clay pi√±ata which the tribe put their evil into, and then send the object afloat in the ocean. A group of college students sail to a remote island for an annual Cinco de Mayo treasure hunt. There, every fraternity boy is handcuffed to a random sorority girl. Each couple is instructed to collect as many pairs of strewn underwear on the island as possible. The couple that collects the most underwear and presents them to judges Monica and Paul will receive $20,000. The groups consist of Jake and Julie, Doug and Carmen, Bob and Lisa, Larry and Connie, and Kyle and Tina. As the hunt starts, the pairs eagerly retrieve underwear, apart from Kyle and Tina who have just broken up with each other. Bob and Lisa find the pi√±ata, accidentally bringing the object to life. It proceeds to beat Bob to death with a branch while Lisa runs away. Kyle and Tina decide to forget about the break-up and join in the game. Lisa warns Larry and Connie of the pi√±ata, but neither of them believe her and continue on their search. They pick up a shovel and get a bunch of underwear from a secret stash. The pi√±ata picks up the shovel and crushes Connie's head before turning on Larry. Lisa goes to the camp and tells Paul and Monica about what she saw. The judges, unsure about whether they should believe her or not, go to look for Bob. While they do so, Jake and Julie see the pi√±ata, and when Jake goes to open it, the pi√±ata grabs him and rips out his testicles while it beats Julie to death. Paul is later killed, as Kyle and Tina reconcile. A new group of Kyle, Tina, Doug, Carmen, and Lisa now leave when they see Bob ripped in half on a tree. Doug is hanged by the pi√±ata. As Carmen and Lisa go back, Lisa takes a bathroom break right before Carmen gets her head chopped off. Monica finds Kyle and Tina. Lisa makes it to the camp and thinks Larry and Connie are in there just before she is killed by the pi√±ata. Kyle, Tina and Monica kill the pi√±ata by blowing it up by a Molotov cocktail.  Cast  Production Originally, the pi√±ata monster was played by an actor in a rubber suit, and the film contained no computer effects. After the final cut, computer effects were added to make the monster more frightening. Reception Bruce Eder of Allmovie praised the film's evoking of numerous horror films from past decades, and said, \\"The plot is clever, turning logic on its head in grisly fashion and twisting around some of the conventions of the modern horror genre.\\" Additionally praising the inventive deaths, \\"nutty lightheartedness\\", and set design, he concluded, \\"Pi√±ata: Survival Island ... is not a great movie, just a better, cleverer movie than one would expect from this genre at this late date and also a great deal of fun.\\" Felix Vasquez of Cinema Crazed regarded it as a guilty pleasure which seems deliberately ridiculous. He commented, \\"Sure, this is an age old formula, but I‚Äôve never seen it put to such use before. There‚Äôs nothing but fun in this film and you can‚Äôt help laugh at the horrendous acting by the cast ...\\" References  External links  * * Category:2002 horror films Category:English-language films Category:2002 direct-to-video films Category:2002 films ","title":"Demon Island"},{"id":"9514207","text":"Naogaon Sadar () is an Upazila of Naogaon District in the Division of Rajshahi, Bangladesh.

He played collegiate soccer at Saint Louis University where he won the 1969 and 1970 Hermann Trophy as the player of the year. His professional career includes years in both the North American Soccer League (NASL) and Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). He also was a member of the 1972 U.S. Olympic soccer team. He went on to earn 14 caps with the U.S. national team, scoring one goal. He coached professionally with the St. Louis Steamers of MISL and continues to coach youth soccer. He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame. Early life and college Al Trost grew up in St. Louis, MO and attended high school at St. Louis Preparatory Seminary in Shrewsbury, MO, where he also starred on the soccer team. Trust attended Saint Louis University where he led the Billikins to the 1969 and 1970 NCAA championships. In 1967, Trost's freshman year, St. Louis made it to the title game, which was ended due to weather with the score 0‚Äì0. St. Louis and Michigan State were declared co-champions that season. In 1969, Trost earned NCAA Tournament Offensive MVP honors. Trost was also a two-time Hermann Trophy recipient as the collegiate player of the year in 1969 and 1970. Ironically, he was only selected as a first team All American in 1970. On September 30, 2009, Trost was named to SLU's Half-Century Team. Olympics and national teams While Trost finished his collegiate career in 1970, he chose not to turn pro in order to be eligible for the 1972 Summer Olympics. The U.S. began qualification for the games in 1971 and Trost was an integral part of the Olympic team, playing eight of the U.S.'s eleven games. He scored twice, first in the August 22, 1971 3‚Äì1 victory over and the next game, a September 18 1‚Äì0 victory over El Salvador. Trost played two of the three games at the Munich Olympics, the 0‚Äì0 tie with Morocco and the crushing 0‚Äì7 defeat at the hands of West Germany. Trost continued playing for the national team after the Olympics. He earned his first cap, and scored his only goal, with the senior team on August 12, 1973, in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Poland. He went on to captain the U.S. through the failed 1974 and 1978 World Cup qualifying campaigns. His last game with the national team came against Portugal in Lisbon on Sept. 20, 1978. NASL In 1973, Trost began his professional playing career with the St. Louis Stars of the North American Soccer League. He had initially been drafted by the Stars in the 1968 college draft; however, the near-collapse of the NASL and Trost's desire to maintain hi amateur eligibility precluded his signing with the team prior to 1973. After the 1977 season, the Stars gave up on St Louis and moved to Anaheim, California, to play the 1978 season as the California Surf. Despite leading the Surf in scoring, the team traded him to the Seattle Sounders in January 1979 for Tony Chursky. Trost played the 1979 season with the Sounders, scoring only one goal in eleven games. On 28 September 1979, Trost left the Sounders and the NASL. During his time in the league, he was a second team All Star in 1976 and received honorable mention in 1973 and 1977. Trost ended his NASL career number 72 on the NASL points list with 100 off 38 goals and 24 assists. MISL After leaving the NASL, Trost played a single season for the New York Arrows of Major Indoor Soccer League in 1979‚Äì1980. In 1981, the St. Louis Steamers hired Trost to replace Pat McBride who left the team in a contract dispute during the 1980‚Äì1981 post- season. Trost continued coaching the Steamers during the 1981‚Äì1982 season when he took the team to the MISL championship series, which it lost to Trost's old team, the New York Arrows. When the team began the 1982‚Äì1983 season 5‚Äì9, Trost was fired on January 4, 1983. High school coaching Trost began his coaching career with the McCluer North High School (Florissant, Missouri) boys' soccer team, while playing for the St. Louis Stars. In 1974, he took the team to the Missouri state championship. He currently coaches the Parkway South High School boys' and girls' soccer teams. In February 2016, Trost announced he will retire from teaching and as head coach at Parkway South.

Therefore, a scout plane is essentially a small naval aircraft, as distinguished from a tactical ground observation aircraft, a strategic reconnaissance \\"spyplane\\", or a large patrol flying boat. Scout planes first made their appearances during World War I. Major naval powers, keen on developing the new medium of aerial warfare, converted a number of vessels as seaplane tenders for scouting purpose. Similarly, battleships began to mount short flight decks on top of gun turrets, enabling small fighter-type aircraft to take-off from them; these single-seater \\"scouts\\", having no floats to land on and having no landing decks to return to, either had to find dry land for landing, or else had to ditch onto the sea. After World War I, a more satisfactory (although still clumsy) solution had been found, in which catapults were mounted onto battleships, cruisers and seaplane tenders, used to launch scout planes; these floatplanes or small flying boats would land on water, and then be winched back onto the ships by cranes. Well-known scout planes of these type include the British Supermarine Walrus, the German Arado Ar 196, and the American Curtiss SOC Seagull. Meanwhile, aircraft carriers also began to appear; these rarely carried dedicated scout planes, but usually combined this function with other types of aircraft, such as dive bombers (hence this type of aircraft was known in the United States Navy as \\"scout bomber\\") or torpedo bombers (\\"torpedo scouts\\"). While the \\"traditional\\" role of scout planes was to spot enemy fleets, during World War II scout planes were essential for battleships and other surface warships during bombardment of land targets, as it was difficult to see an enemy position, even with binoculars. The scout plane, for the U.S., this was usually the Vought OS2U Kingfisher, which would fly over the position, giving the ship a latitude/longitude destination. The ship would then open fire on that area, thereby indirectly attacking the enemy, and allowing ground troops or fighter/bomber aircraft to access the area. Quite possibly the most illustrious use of scout planes were with the sister battleships and . Their extremely long range meant that they could fire over the horizon, and scout planes were needed to spot enemy ships. Seven seaplane scouts were carried on each ship, including four Aichi E13A for long-range reconnaissance, and three Mitsubishi F1Ms for artillery direction. Japan also pioneered the concept of submarine-borne scout planes, with a number of large submarines having waterproof hangars and catapults to carry scout floatplanes during World War II. During the Cold War the role of the shipborne observation aircraft was taken over by naval helicopters. Although less so in Western navies, the role of providing mid-course update via data-link for long range anti-shipping missiles can be seen as directly akin to the artillery \\"spotting\\" missions of old. Without mid-course update it would be impossible to fully utilize the full range of long range missiles such as the Otomat, and P-500 Bazalt. Due to the advanced technology used by today's cruisers, destroyers, and other surface vessels, and the use of ship-launched UAVs for the same sorts of \\"spotting\\" missions in the 21st century, scout planes are no longer needed for long range exchanges.

Driberg was well known as the Daily Express columnist \\"William Hickey\\" and had a home in Bradwell-on-Sea ‚Äì the only candidate who lived in the constituency. He was a member of the \\"1941 Committee\\", a group of progressive intellectuals who met under the chairmanship of J. B. Priestley at the home of Edward G. Hulton, the owner of the Picture Post newspaper. At the start of May, the Committee had published a \\"Nine-Point Plan\\" calling for works councils and the publication of \\"post-war plans for the provision of full and free education, employment and a civilized standard of living for everyone.\\"Schoolnet: Tom Hopkinson The plan formed the basis of Driberg's campaign. The third contestant was 64 year- oldWho's who in Engineering, 1921 Borlase Matthews, standing as a National Independent and Agricultural candidate. He was Liberal candidate at Henley for the 1931 general election, the 1932 Henley by-election, at Ashford for the 1935 general election,The Times House of Commons, 1935 and at the 1937 Tonbridge by-election. He was an engineer but left engineering to take up farming. He was a Member of the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society. He was a Member of the Electricity Commissioners Rural Electrification Conference. He was Chairman of the Rural Reconstruction Association. He was also an author of several books and papers on farming.The Times House of Commons, 1931 Matthews supported Churchill's Coalition government but felt that it was too dominated by the Conservatives and wanted it to be more progressive in nature.Tom Driberg: his life and indiscretions, Francis Wheen  Results  On a much-reduced turnout, the result was a massive victory for Driberg, who won 61.3% of the votes. Ruggles-Brise had held the seat at the 1935 general election with 53.4% of the votes, a majority of 24.5%; but Hunt won only 31.3%. Driberg sat as an Independent Labour MP until January 1945, when he took the Labour Whip in the House of Commons. As a Labour Party candidate, he held the seat comfortably at the 1945 general election, and remained Maldon's MP until he stepped down at the 1955 election. The rejection of the government candidate was widely linked to the Axis capture of Tobruk only a few days beforehand, the latest in a string of British defeats, although Driberg denied that this had been a major factor.

Mann Building Newton Free Library, the public library of Newton, Massachusetts, provides an extensive collection of print, non-print, and electronic resources, a comprehensive reference service, and a wide array of educational and cultural programs for people of all ages. History Before 1870, several citizen groups organized library societies to serve their neighborhoods, among them the Social Library Society of West Newton, the Adelphian Library and the Newton Centre Library Association. In 1866, one of these groups, the Newton Library Association, purchased land to establish a public library for the residents of Newton. Construction of the building began in August 1868, aided by donations from private citizens. Designed by architect Alexander Rice Esty, the Newton Free Library was dedicated on Friday, June 17, 1870, and opened to the public July 1 of the same year. It opened with about 7,000 volumes, composed of previous library associations' collections, new purchases, as well as private donations. By 1875, the collection had grown to 11,003 volumes. Today, the collection has grown to about 530,000 items. Regarding the library's name, the annual report for the year 1887 reads: > The term 'Public Library' fails to give full expression to the character of > the Public Library and the many institutions of the same description which > have been lately established in our cities and towns. The distinguishing > term is the 'Free Library'. As the library's collection and membership grew, the physical space needed to be expanded. Several expansions were added to the original building on Centre Street, first in 1886, then again in 1952. Demand for library services was so great that the Newton Free Library built neighborhood branches in Newton Centre, Waban, Oak Hill, West Newton, Auburndale, Newton Upper Falls, Newtonville, Nonantum, Newton Highlands and Newton Lower Falls. In the mid 1980s it was determined that a new building was needed to maintain the growing collection of library materials‚Äîboth traditional and non-traditional, and to keep up with the community's demand for quality library services. Groundbreaking for the new building took place on July 27, 1989. The Theodore D. Mann Building opened to the public on September 15, 1991, at a cost of just over $15 million. It was believed that branches were no longer necessary and were, in fact, usurping the main of patrons and resources, so all but 4 of the branches were closed. The remaining branches remained open with reduced hours and staffing in four outlying locations: Auburndale, Waban, Newton Corner, and Nonantum. The latter two were closed on July 1, 2008 due to budget cuts, while Auburndalehttp://auburndalelibrary.org/ and Wabanhttp://www.wabanlibrarycenter.org/ continue as community-run library centers. Today Since its move to the new building, the Newton Free Library's circulation has steadily increased to almost 2 million items per year. A wide variety of educational and cultural programs, specialized children's programming, high-speed wireless access, and an ever-increasing audio-visual collection continue to attract people of all ages to the library. In its most recent update, in spring of 2018, the library renovated the children and teen area to create a new tween area on the first floor behind the research area. The Newton Free Library has been recognized as one of the top ten libraries in the country within its population range category by Hennen's American Public Library Ratings, being ranked in the top 10 nine times out of 10 reports between 1999‚Äì2010. Governance The library is a department of the city of Newton and has a board of trustees appointed by the mayor who serve a staggered five-year term.

During his career, he signed a total of 52 players who made it to the Major Leagues, most notably Hall of Famers Ferguson Jenkins and Mike Schmidt. His total number of Major League signings is considered to be unsurpassed, and some have called him perhaps the greatest scout ever. Early life Lucadello was born in Thurber, Texas to native Italian parents, but grew up in Chicago, Illinois, where his family moved so his father could work in the area's coal mines. From player to scout In 1936, Branch Rickey established a new Class D team - the Fostoria Redbirds - in Fostoria, Ohio as part of the St. Louis Cardinals system and the Ohio State League. Lucadello travelled to Fostoria to try out for the team and ended up spending two years as a shortstop and player-manager in the league with the Redbirds and the Tiffin Mud Hens. Never a major league prospect as a player, Lucadello eventually took a factory job with the Fostoria Screw Company, met his future wife and settled down. In 1942, however, he returned to baseball as a part-time scout for the Chicago Cubs. He began running tryout camps, assembling teams and borrowing equipment to outfit them, and playing his finds against some of the best amateur talent in the Midwest. He was offered his first full-time scouting position by Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley after bringing two pitchers in two years to the attention of Cubs manager Charlie Grimm who were signed immediately to the Major League roster. After seeing the second pitcher, Bob Rush, throwing at a tryout at Wrigley Field, Wrigley told Grimm, \\"Before you sign this pitcher here, if you want him that bad, you better sign that young man right there,\\" and pointed at Lucadello. As he left Grimm's office, Wrigley said of Lucadello, \\"This young man was born to be a scout\\". Scouting fundamentals Unlike nearly all other scouts, Lucadello almost never watched a game from behind home plate. Rather, he moved from place to place around the field: a short way up the baseline (to see the batter's face), behind first or third base (to judge the arm strength of both infielders and outfielders), and halfway up the line (to watch pitchers). Lucadello claimed that the key to identifying a prospect was to focus on the player's body control and footwork, saying, \\"Eighty-seven percent of the game of baseball is played below the waist.\\" The four kinds of scouts, according to Lucadello, start with the letter 'P': * Poor -- wastes time looking for games rather than having a planned itinerary * Picker -- emphasizes a player's one weakness to the neglect of all strengths * Performance -- bases his evaluation on what a player does in his presence * Projector -- envisions what a player will be able to do in two or three years. He estimated that five percent of scouts were poor, five percent pickers, 85 percent performance scouts and five percent projectors. Lucadello's credentials as a \\"projector\\" were most clearly demonstrated in his vision for Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt. As a high school senior with two bad knees, Schmidt hit only .179 with one home run, but Lucadello had been watching him since Little League and still saw his potential. \\"I felt...that Mike was a late bloomer\\", he explained years later. He tried to keep his interest in Schmidt from other scouts by hiding behind dugouts or bushes or watching from a nearby rooftop. \\"I watched one game from the back of a station wagon in the parking lot\\", Lucadello said. According to Schmidt, \\"Without Tony Lucadello, I wouldn't have been a Philadelphia Phillie. He scouted me from the time I played Little League Baseball all the way up through high school and college. He had me followed when a lot of other scouts had kind of written me off\\". =The Lucadello plan= Like many scouts, Lucadello believed that modern players were weak in the fundamentals of the game. For many years he had proposed that young players could constantly improve their skills by using concrete walls to work on their arms and take ground balls at the same time, with or without supervision, similar to the way young basketball players spent hour after hour shooting at a basket. With the help of some high school coaches who worked as part-time scouts for him, he developed and published a series of training drills using the walls in a booklet called \\"The Lucadello Plan\\" that he believed could help change the game. In 1984, American League president Dr. Bobby Brown, also believing the game's skills were in decline among its young players, began seeking a low- level way to reverse the trend. Among the ideas he received from major league baseball scouts was Lucadello's description of his \\"plan.\\" With encouragement from former Phillies manager Dallas Green, who had seen clinics run by Lucadello in Puerto Rico, Major League Baseball created an instructional video in 1987 called, \\"A Coaching Clinic,\\" that demonstrated the drills. Orders for the video came from all over the world, and it was given to officials from the former Soviet Union who visited spring training in 1988 in preparation for the creation of an Olympic team. The Lucadello Plan lists six rules for young players to follow to maximize the benefit of practicing with the wall: # Learn to position your feet for ground balls # Keep your head and glove down # Grip the ball across the seams # Throw with a strong, over-the-top delivery # Take 100 grounders off the wall every day # Play with enthusiasm Major League signees Lucadello claimed, along with many of the coaches and part-time scouts he worked with, that his success in signing players was due largely to the close relationship he built with prospects and their families while he scouted them, sometimes over a number of years. Ferguson Jenkins said, \\"I signed with the Phils because they had worked with me for three years...and 'cause I became real good friends with Tony Lucadello. He came down every weekend to watch me play.\\" In one case, Lucadello was able to sign a player who had offers of at least $100,000 from seven other teams while all Lucadello could offer from the Cubs was $4,000. Lucadello had been watching the player, Dick Drott, since he was fifteen. On the night of Drott's graduation, the earliest time he could sign a high school player, Lucadello, Drott and both of his parents were in tears about their decision when the mother said, \\"I don't want the money....Over my dead body is my boy going to sign with anyone but Tony.\\" These are the Major League players who were originally signed by Tony Lucadello (by ML debut date): :For the Chicago Cubs (Note: * All-Star, + Hall of Fame): * Johnny Lucadello * Hank Edwards * Ed Hanyzewski * Russ Kerns * Bob Rush * * Wayne Terwilliger * Harry Chiti * Bob Kelly * Fred Richards * Don Elston * * Duke Simpson * Jim Brosnan * Bob Speake * Bob Anderson * Dick Drott * Eddie Haas * Gordon Massa * Gene Fodge * Footer Johnson * Don Eaddy * Ed Donnelly * John Goetz * Lou Johnson :For the Philadelphia Phillies (Note: * All-Star, + Hall of Fame): * George Williams * John Herrnstein * Alex Johnson * ( American League Batting champion) * Grant Jackson * * Ferguson Jenkins *+ (1971 National League Cy Young Award winner) * Billy Sorrell * Terry Harmon * Clarence Jones * Mike Marshall * (1974 National League Cy Young Award winner) * John Upham * Larry Hisle * * Steve Arlin * Toby Harrah * * Dave Roberts * Mike Schmidt *+ (1980, 1981, 1986 National League Most Valuable Player; All- Century Team) * Larry Cox * Jim Essian * Tom Underwood * Dyar Miller * Bill Nahorodny * Fred Andrews * Barry Bonnell * Todd Cruz * Scott Munninghoff * Len Matuszek * Scott Service * Mickey Morandini * * Tom Marsh Awards Lucadello was inducted into the All Sports Hall of Fame in Chicago in 1976.Krupp, Paul. \\"Famous Baseball Scout Overlooked By Hometown.\\" Fostoria.org.

Apparently unable to cope with the impending loss of his work - \\"the fear of not being wanted,\\" Mike Schmidt called it - Lucadello committed suicide by a gunshot wound to the head on May 8, 1989 on a baseball field in Fostoria. The field, now named for Lucadello, features a monument honoring the former scout as \\"Baseball's Friend\\".

He is a former member of Old Crow Medicine Show and a founding member of the Kitchen Syncopators. In March 2015 he released his third album, the self-titled Gill Landry, and in October 2017 came Love Rides a Dark Horse released by ATO Records and Loose Music. Biography =Early days= Gill Landry got his first guitar when he was 5. After spending many years busking the streets of New Orleans, the Northwest, and Europe, he started The Kitchen Syncopators with his friend Woody Pines in 1998. As he tells the story: Those songs would come in handy later when they'd moved to the Pacific Northwest. Landry recounts: The Kitchen Syncopators recorded six self-released CDs: * The Kitchen Syncopators * Tijuana Zebra * Pepper In My Shoe (2003) * Yazoo City Strugglers (2004) * Underwood (2005) * Live From Sedona (2006) =Old Crow Medicine Show= Gill began to fill in for Critter Fuqua, lending vocals, banjo and steel guitar for Old Crow Medicine Show, joining them on tour in Europe in 2005 and appearing at the Cambridge Folk Festival. As Landry tells it: Recovering quickly, he \\"went to a place called The Folkstore in Seattle, and bought a Goodtime banjo.\\" He got a five-minute lesson from the store owner, then \\"practiced it for two weeks before I went to meet the boys. I played it on the Opry and at Doc Watson days. I must have just been god awful (sic).\\" Something must have worked, because \\"they kept calling me back. When Old Crow co-founder Chris \\"Critter\\" Fuqua officially \\"went on hiatus\\" from the group in 2007 to pursue \\"recovery from a longtime alcohol addiction\\", the group looked to Landry as a replacement. \\" He toured and recorded with the band until 2015, appearing on Tennessee Pusher (2008), Carry Me Back (2012), and Remedy (2014), for which they won a Grammy Award for Best Folk Album. Regarding his third solo album, released March 2015, he says: \\"This album, though holding to a few similar influences as Old Crow, is very much a departure as it is more of a personal journey, musically and lyrically.\\" Landry left Old Crow Medicine Show following the release of this record. Solo albums In 2007, Landry released a solo album titled The Ballad of Lawless Soirez on Nettwerk Records. \\"Coal Black Heaven\\" from this album was hailed by one reviewer as \\"something of a hobo haiku to the national collapse and depression looming over every hollowed-out and rusted-through US river town.\\" In October 2011, he self-released his second solo album titled Piety & Desire ‚Äî featuring the Felice Brothers, Brandi Carlile, Jolie Holland, Ketch Secor, and Samantha Parton (of the Be Good Tanyas) ‚Äî where he \\"creates a whole film and stereo hi-fi noir milieu\\" by realizing \\"a dozen rootsy, ambient and mostly catchy hardscrabble southwestern tinged originals.\\" His third, self- titled album was released by ATO Records on March 3, 2015. Leaving the \\"relative security of the popular roots band Old Crow Medicine Show\\" and suffering a \\"tough breakup with a one-time fianc√©e,\\" forced a reevaluation of Landry's life helping to generate the \\"introspective, generally dark songs that pour out of him' on this album. Landry says of his \\"map out of the darkness\\": = Love Rides a Dark Horse (2017) = Love Rides a Dark Horse was released by ATO Records & Loose in October 2017. Landry says of the impetus for the album: The album includes contributions from Ross Holmes on fiddle (Mumford & Sons, Bruce Hornsby), Skylar Wilson on keyboard (Andrew Combs, Rayland Baxter), and Logan Matheny on drums (Roman Candle, The Rosebuds). American Songwriter notes \\"Landry‚Äôs looming yet subtle baritone ‚Äî somewhere between Leonard Cohen, Kris Kristofferson and Dave Alvin ‚Äî unspool (sic) stories of broken hearts.\\" Festivals and tours Landry shared stage at Americana Music Festival in September 2015 with acts such as Loretta Lynn, Steve Earle, Pokey Lafarge, and Gillian Welch. He opened for Warren Haynes and The Wood Brothers on tour in Fall of 2015. After touring Sweden in 2016, Landry performed at Twisterella (2016) and both the Latitude Festival in Suffolk, England and Longitude Festival in Ireland in 2017. Film/Video Landry contributed music for the Run Away Dog (2017) soundtrack. He appeared in Austin to Boston (2014), which chronicled four bands riding in five Volkswagen buses across three thousand miles, and featured: Ben Howard, The Staves, Nathaniel Rateliff, and Bear's Den.

Next comes the mathematical school of probability, followed by charts and statistics. As the narrator slowly turns into a \\"math zombie\\", everything in her life is transformed into a problem. A class treat of cupcakes becomes a study in fractions, while a trip to the store turns into a problem of money. Finally, she is left painstakingly calculating how many minutes of \\"math madness\\" will be in her life now that she is a \\"mathematical lunatic.\\" Her sister asks her what her problem is, and she responds, \\"365 days x 24 hours x 60 minutes.\\" Finally, she collapses on her bed, and dreams that she is trapped in a blackboard-room covered in math problems. Armed with only a piece of chalk, she must escape and she manages to do just that by breaking the chalk in half, because \\"two halves make a whole.\\" She escapes through this \\"whole\\", and awakens the next morning with the ability to solve any problem. Her curse is broken...until the next day, when her science teacher mentions that in life, everything can be viewed as a science experiment. Math problems The book is full of actual math problems (and some rather unrelated questions, such as \\"What does this inkblot look like?\\"). Readers can try to solve the problems and check their answers, which are located on the back cover of the book. Adapted for the stage The book was also adapted for the stage by Heath Corson and Kathleen Collins in 1997. It was first performed at the A Red Orchid Theatre in Chicago, Illinois, in 1997, with subsequent productions at other locations. Its West Coast premiere was in 2003 at the Powerhouse Theatre of Santa Monica, California. Directed by Collins, the cast included Kerry Lacy, Thomas Colby, Will Moran, Andrew David James, and Emily Marver. The play met with warm reviews and succeeded with its audiences as well as local school children. Awards The book was critically acclaimed, winning a number of awards and accolades, including Maine's Student Favorite Book Award, the Texas Bluebonnet Award, and New Hampshire's The Great Stone Face Book Award.

Calretinin, also known as calbindin 2 (formerly 29 kDa calbindin), is a calcium-binding protein involved in calcium signaling. In humans, the calretinin protein is encoded by the CALB2 gene.  Function  This gene encodes an intracellular calcium-binding protein belonging to the troponin C superfamily. Members of this protein family have six EF-hand domains which bind calcium. This protein plays a role in diverse cellular functions, including message targeting and intracellular calcium buffering. Calretinin is abundantly expressed in neurons including retina (which gave it the name) and cortical interneurons. Expression was found in different neurons than that of the similar vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein, calbindin-28kDa. Calretinin has an important role as a modulator of neuronal excitability including the induction of long-term potentiation. Loss of expression of calretinin in hippocampal interneurons has been suggested to be relevant in temporal lobe epilepsy. It is expressed in a number of other locations including hair follicles.  Clinical significance  Calretinin is a diagnostic marker for some human diseases, including Hirschsprung disease and some cancers. = Mesothelioma = Using immunohistochemistry, calretinin can be demonstrated in both benign mesothelium and in malignant mesothelioma and can be used to help differentiate different lung tumours. Antibodies to calretinin can also be used to distinguish between different types of brain tumour, demonstrating only those with neuronal rather than glial, differentiation. Furthermore, the essential function of calretinin in mesothelioma cell lines has been demonstrated in vitro and may be an interesting target for therapeutical approaches. =Hirschsprung disease= In Hirschsprung disease, calretinin immunohistochemistry offers additional diagnostic value in specimens with inadequate amount of submucosa and rarely seen ganglion cells. The presence of ganglion cells consistently correlated with calretinin-positive thin nerve fibrils in the lamina propria, muscularis mucosae and superficial submucosa. These calretinin-positive thin neurofibrils are absent in the aganglionic segments of bowel and in the areas without ganglion cells from the junction of normal with diseased rectum. Calretinin is strongly expressed in the submucosal and subserosal nerve trunks in the ganglionic segment. No calretinin expression is seen in the nerve trunks in the rest of the aganglionic segment. It has faint expression in the thick nerve trunks from the areas without ganglion cells. Faint positivity of the thick submucosal and subserosal nerves in the absence of ganglion cells and calretinin positive nerve fibrils, is characteristic of the junction of the aganglionic-to-normal rectum.

Early life Born in Swindon and attended Queens' College, Cambridge. His mother was an Armenian, and daughter of man fleeing the Armenian Genocide; she was later adopted by his grandfather. Television Jukes' television writing has mainly been in the genre of prime time thrillers or TV detective fiction, with 90-minute or two-hour long stories being broadcast by the BBC. Jukes devised and wrote most of the three seasons of the BBC One prime time undercover thriller In Deep starring Nick Berry and Stephen Tompkinson; French Version of in Deep two 90-minute film length episodes of the BBC One series The Inspector Lynley Mysteries;. Burn Out, the two-hour first episode of the first season of the Emmy Award winning 'cold-case' series Waking the Dead; achieved 8.4m viewers and a 38% share.Digital Spy author (22 June 2001) Feltz return grabs 4m, Digital Spy, retrieved 6 January 2007 He and Ed Whitmore wrote the second series of the paranormal/science thriller Sea of Souls which won the 2005 BAFTA Scotland AwardScottish Bafta Awards for Best Drama. Jukes' opening episode of the third season of Holby City was described by The Guardian as the \\"televisual equivalent of Crack Cocaine.\\" In October 2009, Jukes wrote a critical piece for Prospect magazine, contrasting the standards of UK television drama negatively with the standard of television dramas in America. In the essay Why Can't Britain Do the Wire he argued that high-quality drama in the UK had suffered from a concentration of commissioning power, the dominance of soaps (such as the twelfth series of Holby City), and the lack of show runners or writer producers that characterise US TV drama production. Radio His radio credits include the original BBC Radio Soul Motel (2008) (a drama taking place entirely in social networking space similar to Bebo or Facebook) and, with the comedian and actor Lenny Henry, the plays Bad Faith and Slavery: The Making of. The latter formed part of the BBC's 2007 programming series to commemorate 200 years since Britain abolished the slave trade, \\"managed to extract maximum humour from the grimmest of subject matters.\\" by using the form of a semi-comic mockumentary. As The Spectator magazine explained: \\"Greg Wise plays the harassed producer trying to put together a drama for which Lenny Henry has provided sheafs of research printouts from the internet ‚Äì but no script... 'Whose story is this?' demands Adrian Lester in an angry exchange with Brian Blessed. Were they in character? Or were they arguing for real?\\" In 2008, Lenny Henry starred in another \\"dark comedy\\" by Jukes called Bad Faith: \\"Imagine the movie Bad Lieutenant transplanted to Birmingham, with Harvey Keitel's morally bankrupt copper replaced by Lenny Henry as a police chaplain who has lost his faith, and you have Peter Jukes's black comedy\\". Paul Donovan of The Sunday Times called Bad Faith \\"the best radio drama I have heard in ages, and clearly destined to become a series....\\". In February 2010 three further episodes were broadcast on BBC Radio 4. to more positive reviews: \\"The scripts are strong, taut, bang up-to-the-minute, salted with ironic humour. (Lenny Henry's) performance is brilliant\\" according to Gillian Reynolds in The Daily Telegraph, and according to The Stage: > \\"Jukes' writing is terrific ‚Äì funny, deep, unafraid to move from the mundane > to the reflective. Jake, his semi-heretical minister, is the most original > creation of his kind that I can recall and Henry was born to play him.\\". Non-fiction Jukes's book A Shout in the Street was published by Faber and Faber in the UK in 1990, and by Farrar, Straus and Giroux and the University of California Press in the US. This \\"unusual but addictive book\\" (according to The Washington Post ) is a series of essays and montages about modernity and city life, centred on London, Paris, Saint Petersburg and New York City. The Journal of Sociology compared the book favourably to the work of Jane Jacobs: \\"He is less shrill than Jacobs, more confident in his materials, and yet more sensitive and critical.\\" But it was the format of the book (\\"a courteously lucid deconstructionist text,which is part documentary lecture, part collage of quotations and photographs\\" according to The New Yorker) which was commended by John Berger a \\"dream of a book\\" following the traditions of Walter Benjamin: > Benjamin dreamed of making a book entirely of quotations, and there have > been some remarkable books which are creative responses to that idea, like > Peter Jukes's A Shout in the Street. Following through in these themes of urbanism and city development Jukes also co-authored, along with Anna Whyatt, Stephen O'Brien and the sociologist Manuel Castells, the monograph Creative Capital: 21st Century Regions. Jukes is the author of The Fall of the House of Murdoch, published by Unbound, a crowd-funded publisher, in August 2012.

Shadowing the Conqueror, which transferred to Washington, D.C, was described in The Washington Post as \\"a depiction of the travels of Alexander the Great (Grimmette) and a contemporary photographer named Mary Ellis (Laura Giannarelli) ‚Äì based very loosely on the relationship between Alexander and Pyrrho of Elis, a painter who accompanied the warrior on his expedition to the Orient ‚Äì is most of all a lofty debate between two intensely committed, opposing forces.\\" Jukes wrote the book of the London stage musical Matador, with lyrics by Edward Seago and music by Mike Leander, starring John Barrowman and Stefanie Powers, which premiered at the Queen's Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue in April 1991. Journalism and politics Jukes has been a book reviewer and feature writer for both The Independent and the New Statesman on themes as diverse as nationalism, art in the computer age, and apocalyptic religion. During the 1980s and 90s Jukes was an active member of the British Labour Party and was involved in the investigations around the cash for questions scandal. More recently Jukes became an active Barack Obama supporter during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, writing for Daily Kos and then MyDD when it became a heavily pro-Clinton site. Later he recorded his online experiences of the Primary 'Flame Wars' for Prospect. Following the primaries, he was one of 25 regular bloggers who began writing for a new political blog, The Motley Moose.

It has three EF hand motifs and is structurally related to calmodulin and troponin C. Parvalbumin is found in fast-contracting muscles, where its levels are highest, as well as in the brain and some endocrine tissues. Parvalbumin is a small, stable protein containing EF-hand type calcium binding sites. It is involved in calcium signaling. Typically, this protein is broken into three domains, domains AB, CD and EF, each individually containing a helix-loop-helix motif. The AB domain houses a two amino-acid deletion in the loop region, whereas domains CD and EF contain the N-terminal and C-terminal, respectively. Calcium binding proteins like parvalbumin play a role in many physiological processes, namely cell-cycle regulation, second messenger production, muscle contraction, organization of microtubules and phototransduction. Therefore, calcium-binding proteins must distinguish calcium in the presence of high concentrations of other metal ions. The mechanism for the calcium selectivity has been extensively studied. Location and function {  Pvalb is expressed in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus in the postnatal day 56 mouse. Allen Brain Atlases  In the cerebellum of adult mice Pvalb is expressed in Purkinje cells and molecular layer interneurons. Allen Brain Atlases } = Parvalbumin in neural tissue = Parvalbumin is present in some GABAergic interneurons in the nervous system, especially the reticular thalamus, and expressed predominantly by chandelier and basket cells in the cortex. In the cerebellum, PV is expressed in Purkinje cells and molecular layer interneurons. In the hippocampus, PV+ interneurons are subdivided into basket, axo-axonic, and bistratified cells, each subtype targeting distinct compartments of pyramidal cells.free full text PV interneurons' connections are mostly perisomatic (around the cell body of neurons). Most of the PV interneurons are fast-spiking. They are also thought to give rise to gamma waves recorded in EEG. PV-expressing interneurons represent approximately 25% of GABAergic cells in the primate DLPFC. Other calcium-binding protein markers are calretinin (most abundant subtype in DLPFC, about 50%) and calbindin. Interneurons are also divided into subgroups by the expression of neuropeptides such as somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, cholecystokinin. = Parvalbumin in muscular tissue = PV is known to be involved in relaxation of fast-twitch muscle fibers. This function is associated with PV role in calcium sequestration. During muscle contraction, the action potential stimulate voltage-sensitive proteins in T-tubules membrane. These proteins stimulate the opening of Ca2+ channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to release of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasm. The Ca2+ ions bind to troponin, what causes the displacement of tropomyosin, a protein that prevents myosin walking along actin. The displacement of tropomyosin exposes the myosin-binding sites on actin, permitting muscle contraction. This way, while muscle contraction is driven by Ca2+ release, muscle relaxation is driven by Ca2+ removal from sarcoplasm. Along with Ca2+ pumps, PV contributes to Ca2+ removal from cytoplasm: PV binds to Ca2+ ions in the sarcoplasm, and then shuttles it to the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  Role in pathology  Decreased PV and GAD67 expression was found in PV+ GABAergic interneurons in schizophrenia. =Parvalbumin and food allergy= Parvalbumin has been identified as an allergen causing fish allergy (but not shellfish allergy). Bony fishes manifest Œ≤-parvalbumin and cartilaginous fishes such as sharks and rays manifest Œ±-parvalbumin; allergenicity to bony fishes has a low cross- reactivity to cartilaginous fishes.

It is a modified antibody. Abatacept is a fusion protein composed of the Fc region of the immunoglobulin IgG1 fused to the extracellular domain of CTLA-4. In order for a T cell to be activated and produce an immune response, an antigen-presenting cell must present two signals to the T cell. One of those signals is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), combined with the antigen, and the other signal is the CD80 or CD86 molecule (also known as B7-1 and B7-2). Abatacept binds to the CD80 and CD86 molecule, and prevents the second signal. Without the second signal, the T cell can't be activated. Abatacept was developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and is licensed in the United States for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the case of inadequate response to anti-TNFŒ± therapy. Some doctors criticize its cost ($3,500 to $3,800 a month, like other biological drugs of its class) and its promotional marketing.Ask Your Doctor if This Ad Is Right for You. How advertising promotes expensive drugs and treatments you may not need. By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL, New York Times, FEB. 27, 2016 Medical uses Abatacept is used to treat adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a second line agent, and as a first line agent for people whose RA is severe and rapidly progressing. It also used to treat psoriatic arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. For label updates, see FDA index page for BLA 125118 Contraindications Abatacept has not been tested in pregnant women and it is not known if it is secreted in breast milk; it causes birth defects in rodents when given in very high doses, and is transmitted in rodent breast milk. People should be tested for tuberculosis and any infection cleared before starting abatacept; vaccines should be updated prior to starting abatacept as well. Abacept will likely interfere with any vaccine given while people are taking it. It should not be used in combination with anakinra or TNF antagonists. Because abatacept, anakinra, and TNF antagonists suppress the immune system, using them in combination may significantly increase the risk for severe infections. Adverse effects People have experienced serious infections due to abatacept's suppression of the immune system; some of these infections have been fatal. People with COPD are likely to get lung infections more often than usual. Some people have had anaphylactic reactions to the drug. Abatacept may cause otherwise slow-growing cancers to proliferate and spread, due to suppression of the immune system. Very common adverse effects (occurring in more than 10% of people) include upper respiratory tract infections. Common adverse effects (occurring in between 1% and 10% of people) include lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, herpes infections, pneumonia, flu, cough, high blood pressure, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, mouth sores, elevated transaminases, rashes, fatigue, weakness, local injection site reactions, and systemic injection reactions. Mechanism of action Abatacept prevents antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from delivering the co-stimulatory signal. This prevents the T cells from being fully activated, and even downregulates them. Simple signaling without co-stimulation allows the cell to recognize the primary signal as \\"self\\" and not ramp-up responses for future responses as well. In order for T cells to be activated and attack an antigen, that antigen must be presented to the T cell by an antigen-presenting cell (APC). That activation requires two signals (one of which is called co-stimulatory signal or signal 2): For signal 1, the APC must bind the antigen to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule, bring that complex to its surface, and present it to the T cell receptor on the surface of the T cell. For signal 2, the APC must present a B7 protein on its cell surface to a CD28 protein on the surface of the T cell. These two signals activate the T cell. Without signal 2, the T cell will not be activated, and will become anergic. Abatacept consists of a fusion protein of the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 and human IgG1, binds to the B7 protein on the APC and prevents it from delivering the co-stimulatory signal to the T cell. Chemistry Abatacept is a fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 with the hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains of IgG1. Research Abatacept is the basis for the second- generation belatacept currently being tested in clinical trials. They differ by only 2 amino acids. In organ transplantation, belatacept is intended to provide extended graft survival while limiting the toxicity generated by standard immune-suppressing regimens such as calcineurin inhibitors (for example cyclosporin).

The park was built on a condemned piece of property purchased in 1897. New York City lacked the funds to do anything with it, so the Outdoor Recreation League (ORL),https://streetswithoutcars.wordpress.com/tag/outdoor-recreation-league/ a playground and recreation advocacy group that built playgrounds in the undeveloped parks using temporary facilities and equipment, built ithttps://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/tag/playground-movement/ as the first permanent, municipally built playground in the country. Opened on October 17, 1903, it was built with cinder surfacing, fences, a recreation pavilion, and children's play and gymnastic equipment. A large running track encircled the play area and children's garden. The Seward Park Branch of the New York Public Library was built in the southeastern part of the park, opening on November 11, 1909. In the 1930s and 1940s, the park was reconstructed, and a piece of land was returned to the city.Flickr Photo and History The Schiff Fountain, donated by Jacob H.

Adult videos are focused on sex, and may not in some cases have a storyline. They are released initially on video, and pass inspection by an adult video ethics committee such as (NEVA), which enforces the placement of video-masking mosaics over pubic hair or genitalia. Pink films may be concerned with sex, but tend to focus more on story, and they are rated by , rather than an adult video ethics organization. The mainstream studio Nikkatsu focused on pink films through its Roman Porno line from 1971 through 1988. V-cinema or OV also tend to focus on a story, but sex if present is less central, and they are released on video to be displayed in video stores or rental shops alongside mainstream movies. Many V-cinema works are produced by video-focused subsidiaries of the big film studios, e.g. SHV Cinema for Shochiku. OV can be rated by the Eirin or Eizourin depending on the content. This is a chronological history of the AV (adult video) industry in Japan. The main events relevant to the AV industry are discussed for each year, as well as notable debuts. Names are given in Western order (i.e., family name second), and alphabetized by family name.  1960s  In the late 1960s, the 'pink film', or adult film market in Japan was largely the realm of low-budget independent companies. The major studios, Daiei, Nikkatsu, Shochiku, Toei and Toho tended to focus on story-based films with little nudity or sex.  1971  Sony released its first U-matic video cassette recorders, providing an early alternative to theatrical film. Film required developing while videotape could be played back right after recording. The high price of the U-matics limited their use mainly to television studios and news crews. With their audience being lost to television and the importation of American films, Japan's major film studios were struggling to keep their market share. Seeking to attract a new audience, Toei entered the sexploitation market in 1971 with its \\"Pinky Violence\\" series. Takashi Itamochi, president of Nikkatsu, Japan's oldest major film studio, made the decision to put the company's high production values and professional talent into the adult, or 'pink film' industry as a way of attracting a new audience. When Nikkatsu launched its Roman Porno series in November 1971 with the Apartment Wife series, these often well-made and artistic softcore erotic films proved popular with both the public and the critics. This introduction of erotica into mainstream Japanese movie theaters has been credited with saving Nikkatsu from collapse at that time. Nikkatsu produced nothing but 'Roman Porno' films for the next 17 years, releasing an average of three such films a month. Other large studios such as Shint≈çh≈ç Eiga and Million Films would follow Nikkatsu into the big-budget 'pink film', but Nikkatsu remained the dominant producer of high- production theatrical pornography in Japan. By the end of the 1970s, Nikkatsu's 'Roman Porno' together with 'pink films' by other studios made up over 70% of the domestic Japanese film market.  1972  The big three video makers of the time Nikkatsu, Toei Video and Nihon Bikotte band together to create an organization to monitor the ethics of adult videos, the .  1975  Sony releases its first Betamax video cassette recorder. It was cheaper than the U-matic, and opened up the possibilities for people to buy them for home use.  1976  JVC releases its first VHS video cassette recorder. For a number of years after, there was a format war between VHS and betamax for the consumer market with VHS eventually winning out.  1977  The ethics organization is renamed the , and affixes its NEVA stamp to approved videos. NEVA requires makers to put in large checkered mosaics over pubic hair and genitals.  1980  Adult magazine publisher Kuki Inc.(‰πùÈ¨º) released its first adult video. Ownership of VCRs starts to spread more widely. Adult videos provided privacy and comfort that the older, established theatrical pink films could not. Also, Patrick Macias points out that adult videos were better able to focus on niche-interests, and provided the convenience of the fast-forward button.  1981  After starring in Japan's first theatrically released hardcore film, director Tetsuji Takechi's Daydream (1981), Kyoko Aizome made her AV debut in November 1981, making her one of Japan's earliest AV idols. was founded in October, and later changed its name to Media Station. Samm Video was founded to produce S&M; videos, and later changed its name to h.m.p. (Japan). In December, Tadashi Yoyogi founded Athena Eizou.  1982  Adult videos attained an approximately equal share of the adult entertainment market with theatrical erotic films.Weisser, p.29. Faced with this new competition over the adult entertainment audience, Nikkatsu focused on production of its S&M; films, which had been their most popular product. Japan's video rental stores increasingly adopt a policy of only stocking videos with the NEVA stamp of approval, leading more and more studios to join NEVA. The early adult video, , became a hit in Japan in 1982, selling over 200,000 copies, an unprecedented number for an adult video. The popularity of this VHS-format video has been said to have increased the sales of video recorders at this time. The popularity of this early video led to its release in the United States by the Orchid International company in 1984. Early AV performers were often struggling actresses who could not find work in the theatrical Roman Porno films and girls from the soaplands.AV producer Shoichi Yoshimura, quoted in 1982 saw the debut of one of the earliest prominent AV actresses, Kate Asabuki, whose name would appear on the titles of both AVs and theatrical films. She would go on to serve as a co-host of the weekly television show Tokyo Rock TV.  1983  Satomi Shinozaki, who debuted on AV in 1983, had a career in theatrical films for another 20 years, directing a film in 2001. Another 1983 debut, Ky≈çko Hashimoto, would graduate from AVs to a successful theatrical film career, appearing in over 100 films, including Kei Mizutani's breakthrough film Weather Woman (1996) 1983 debuts * Satomi Shinozaki („Åó„ÅÆ„Åñ„Åç„Åï„Å®„Åø) aka Aya Misawa, (‰∏â‰∫ïÁ∂æÂ≠ê‰ªñ) Debut: 1983; Born: 1963/1/18.Web I-dic Profile , Shin-Toho Biography , JMDB Filmography  1984  The Crystal-Eizou studio was founded. Director Toru Muranishi joined soon after, and began developing a quasi-documentary approach to filming AV. Yumiko Kumashiro, who debuted in 1984, later starred in a series of theatrical films for Nikkatsu under her stage-name, Eve. She went on to a successful career as a striptease dancer, and starred in films for the Shint≈çh≈ç Eiga studio in the 1990s. Also during this year, Wonder Kids studio released the first completely pornographic animated film, Lolita Anime. It was an immediate success and Nikkatsu quickly jumped on the trend and released their own direct-to-video animated porno under the same title with recognizably similar characters. New government policies and an agreement between Eirin (the Japanese film-rating board) and the pink film companies put drastic new restrictions on theatrical films. Theatrical pink film profits dropped 36% within a month of the new ruling. 1984 debuts * Yumiko Kumashiro (Á•û‰ª£ÂºìÂ≠ê) aka Eve („Ç§„É¥) Debut: 1984 (Eve Debut: 2004); Born: 1965/11/22 Shizuoka Prefecture.Web I-dic Profile , JMDB Filmography: Kumashiro Yumiko, JMDB Filmography: Eve  1985  Eri Kikuchi was an early AV actress to capitalize on her large bust, a metric E-cup. Though she had made underground tapes previously, her official AV debut was in September 1985. She appeared in AVs, magazines and theatrical films such as Shint≈çh≈ç Eiga's 1986 Eri Kikuchi - Big Breasts (ËèäÊ±†„Ç®„É™ Â∑®‰π≥ - Kikuchi Eri Kyonyu). In 2003 she was a lecturer/demonstrator for classes at the AV Cultures School, a school for aspiring AV directors, and in 2007, 23 years after her AV Debut, she was still releasing AVs. Nikkatsu tried to tempt audiences back to adult theaters with higher-caliber pink films, beginning with the Flower and Snake (Hana To Hebi) series (1985‚Äì1987), based on its 1974 Roman Porno S/M hit Flower and Snake, starring Naomi Tani. Nikkatsu tried to circumvent the new theatrical rules and to compete directly with adult videos by entering their own turf. To launch the company's new \\"Harder Than Pink\\" AV series, Nikkatsu wanted Masaru Konuma, director of the highly popular and critically praised 1974 Roman Porno Wife to be Sacrificed, to make a hard-core version of his script Woman in the Box (ÁÆ±„ÅÆ‰∏≠„ÅÆÂ•≥ - Hako No Naka No Onna) in 1985. Konuma was at first reluctant, but Nikkatsu was able to persuade him to make the video by agreeing to allow Konuma to direct his original (and, according to the Weissers, artistically superior) version of this script for theatrical release the following year. However, Nikkatsu soon ceased production of this video series when it proved unsuccessful with the public.Weisser, p. 30, 334, 509.  1986  Alice Japan („Ç¢„É™„Çπ Arisu JAPAN) was established on April 4, 1986 as the adult video label for V-cinema maker Japan Home Video. Hitomi Kobayashi's career in the AV field would last for over a decade and a half, earning her the title \\"Japan's Queen of Adult Video.\\" Her 39 AVs sold over 600,000 copies, earning about 6 billion yen. According to the adult entertainment editor for Shukan Shincho, \\"She laid the foundations for the golden age of adult video.\\" Kaoru Kuroki, has been called \\"the first high-profile AV actress.\\" After becoming a popular star of pornographic videos, she was seen on late-night television, then on daytime talk shows and in national advertising campaigns. She became admired by women for her outspoken but polite and frank discussions of sex, and for expressing \\"feminist\\" views on television. According to Rosemary Iwamura, she changed the image of the AV actress. \\"...she didn't seem to be making videos because of a lack of options but rather as an informed choice.\\" Kuroki's director at Crystal-Eizou, Toru Muranishi, became known as an industry innovator who helped create the documentary-style format which would become a trademark of Japanese AVs. Nikkatsu hired AV queen Hitomi Kobayashi (debut 1986 - see list below) to star in her own theatrical film series in 1987, but these films were judged as little more than AVs on film, and were not popular.Weisser, p.155, 221-222.  1987  In an attempt to compete with the AV industry, Nikkatsu hired AV queen Hitomi Kobayashi, who had debuted the previous year, to star in her own theatrical film series in 1987. These films were not popular with AV fans, who preferred the privacy the AV offered, or with movie-goers, who judged them as little more than AVs on film. Nao Saejima, who debuted in 1987, would star in self-titled theatrical releases for Nikkatsu, the pink film, Abnormal Excitement: Nao Saejima (1989), and the mainstream Meet Me In the Dream: Wonderland (1996)Weisser, p.35. A 2006 article reported that Saejima was then working as an artist. 1987 debuts *Nao Saejima  1988  The largest pink film studio Nikkatsu closed its production facilities in April. Bed Partner (1988) was the final film of the 17-year-old Roman Porno series. Nikkatsu continued to distribute films under the name Ropponica, and theatrical pornography through Excess Films. However these were not nearly as popular or critically respected as the Roman Porno series had been in its heyday.Weisser, p.30, 63, 155. Prolific pink film actor Yutaka Ikejima entered the directing profession in 1988 through the AV medium. He would eventually move into directing theatrical pink films in 1991,Weisser, p.190. earning several awards at the Pink Grand Prix through the years for his contributions to that genre. Diamond Visual, which would become the largest AV company for a while, was founded in September 1988 by Toru Muranishi. Muranishi had worked at Crystal-Eizou when Kaoru Kuroki made her debut there in 1986. Sharing his vision of documentary-style AVs, Kuroki followed Muranishi to his new company. 1988 debut, Keiko Murakami would star in the pink film (1991). 1988 debut, Rena Murakami produced a self-titled movie under her own production unit (Rena Films), under Excess in 1997. 1988 debuts *Mari Ayukawa * Keiko Murakami (Êùë‰∏äÊÖ∂Â≠ê) Debut: 1988; Born 1971/10/25.Web I-dic Profile , JMDB Filmography *Rena Murakami  1989  Yumika Hayashi, who would earn the title of \\"Japan's Original Adult Video Queen\\" during a 16-year career, debuted in 1989. She would star in almost 200 AVs and 180 pink films in her career. A documentary on her life was filmed in 1997, and she was awarded Best Actress at the Pink Grand Prix awards in 2005.

According to the Weissers, \\"by mid-1991, full frontal nudity became commonplace in Japanese magazines and books.\\"Weisser, p.30. The restriction on pubic hair in film and video had been relaxed for imported films, but remained in place for domestic films and AVs until the middle of the decade.  1990  The which became a significant genre of the AV market with Kimiko Matsuzaka's debut early the previous year, continued in 1990. Matsuzaka would appear in her last AV in October 1990, and retire from public life in 1991. Among the leading busty models who debuted this year was Kuwata Kei, whose 113 cm bust measurement was the first in the AV industry to surpass Matsuzaka's advertised 110.7-centimeter metric G-cup. Though never as popular as Matsuzaka, Kuwata's career would last until at least 1998. 1990 debuts * Kei Kuwata (Ê°ëÁî∞„Ç±„Ç§) Debut: 1990, Born: 1971/8/28 Tokyo; Debut: 1990;  1991  Kimiko Matsuzaka's sudden retirement from public life in the spring of 1991 came as a shock to the AV industry. Director Toru Muranishi called Matsuzaka's October 1990 departure from AVs one of the worst stories of the year for the AV industry. Muranishi's company, Diamond Visual, for which Matsuzaka worked, would go from the largest AV producing company to declaring bankruptcy within a year of her retirement. Actress Rie Miyazawa's shashinshuu (photo book) Santa Fe, released in November 1991, was one of the first photo books to take advantage of the lifting of the long-standing ban on the showing of pubic hair. Revealing a little hair in one picture, the book became a national phenomenon, selling 1.5 million copies. \\"Hea nuudo\\" (or \\"Hair nudes\\") in photography became commonplace, but the ban remained in place for AVs. The TV show Gilgamesh Night begins airing on TV Tokyo, and many former AV actresses appear as regulars: Ai Iijima, Reiko Hayama, Asami J≈ç, Miku Kawakami, Rina Kitahara and Youko Yazawa. A number of nude models and mainstream actresses also appeared: Kei Mizutani, Fumie Hosokawa and Tamao Sat≈ç.  1992  The independent Lahaina Tokai studio was founded in Nagoya, focusing on outdoor exhibitionist and other fetish videos. Like many independent studios it refused to join NEVA, sold to specialized AV stores rather than mainstream video rental shops, and used a finer mosaic to obscure pubic hair. It becomes known for its documentary approach. The major film studio, Shint≈çh≈ç Eiga, entered the AV (adult video) market in 1992 with its \\"Hard Porno\\" series. This was a line of video-releases of older K≈çji Wakamatsu-produced S&M; films. The series opened with the Shin'ya Yamamoto (director)-directed Naomi Tani film Cruelty of the Female Inquisition (1975). Wakamatsu's own Torture Chronicles were released to video in this series.Weisser, p.97. In the wake of the preceding year's \\"hair nude\\" photo by Rie Miyazawa, other celebrities appear in photos displaying pubic hair, including Yoko Shimada and Keiko Oginome. Toru Muranishi's Diamond Visual, the largest AV production company at the time, declared bankruptcy in February, 1992.  1993  Nihon Video Hanbai (Êó•Êú¨„Éì„Éá„Ç™Ë≤©Â£≤) opens a nationwide chain of adult video shops Bideo Yasuuriou („Éì„Éá„Ç™ÂÆâÂ£≤Áéã) selling original indies videos (some produced by Soft on Demand or Toru Muranishi). Shuttle Japan was established, and becomes a prominent maker of outdoor exhibitionism, bukakke and gokkun videos.http://www.shuttle- japan.com/company.html  1995  Panasonic, Philips, Sony and Toshiba come out with the first DVD cameras, players and recorders. DVD eventually comes to replace VHS as the dominant format for adult video. In December 1995, Ganari Takahashi founded the AV studio Soft On Demand, which would become the largest independent adult video company in Japan and notable for its creative approach to adult videos. Soft on Demand refused to join NEVA, and started up its own ethics organization, which allowed for finer mosaics than NEVA's big blocky ones. This may have been a factor in SOD's success. Momotaro (Ê°ÉÂ§™ÈÉéÊò†ÂÉè) was also founded this year, and eventually became a rival to SOD in the Indies market. Until the mid-1990s, AV actress were almost exclusively models in their late teens or early 20s at the time of their debuts. However, at this time, \\"mature women\\" models in AVs became increasingly popular. While youthful debuts would still remain the norm, this broadening in tastes would pave the way for the debuts of future \\"mature\\" AV stars. Ruka Aida was one of the most popular 1995 AV debuts, and became known for refusing to allow her male partners to wear condoms in spite of industry concerns over AIDS. After retiring from AV appearances, she would work as a masseuse at a \\"soapland\\" in Tokyo's Yoshiwara district, and then, in 2004, open her own bar in Tokyo's Roppongi district. In one of the longer and more prolific AV actress careers, Aika Miura averaged one film a month over a seven-year period, She starred in the theatrically released, widescreen film Aika Miura - Streetcar Ecstasy in 2001, and retired in 2002, seven years after her AV debut. 1995 debuts *Ruka Aida (ÊÑõÁî∞„Çã„Åã) Debut: 1995, Born: 1971/9/4 Kanagawa.Avidol Profile, Web I-dic Profile , News: 2006/1/7 *Asami Jo  1996  Soft on Demand set up the Media Rinri Kyoukai („É°„Éá„Ç£„Ç¢ÂÄ´ÁêÜÂçî‰ºö) to monitor the content of videos produced by SOD group and allied indie studios. Mediarin enforces thinner mosaics than NEVA allowing the indies makers to gain market share. Miki Sawaguchi was one of the more prominent actresses to debut in 1996. Through appearances in magazine photo layouts, gravure books, AV videos, on TV, on radio and even singing on CDs, this busty AV actress became a multi-media star. A December 2005 news article claimed that 1996 AV debut, Yuri Komuro was \\"one of the brightest stars in the adult video firmament\\", and reported that she had begun working as an author after her 1999 retirement. At the height of her popularity, Komuro participated in developing a perfume from the odor that had built up in a pair of panties she had worn for several days. The perfume was named \\"Asoko\\" (literally, \\"That place\\"), a word used as a euphemism for the genitals by the Japanese.  1997  A 2006 article reported that 1997 debut, Sally Yoshino, was then working as a striptease dancer.  1998   1999  Hokuto Corporation creates the Digital Media Mart (DMM) corporation to sell and rent adult videos over the World Wide Web. This eventually becomes the largest online adult video store in Japan. 1999 debut, Mami Aizawa was called \\"one of the hottest commodities in the Japanese adult video world\\" in a 2003 article. She had reportedly preserved her virginity until her third AV appearance since her first required only modeling, and the second displayed her manual skills on her male counterpart. In October 2006, seven years after her 1999 debut, AV star Minori Aoi appeared in a controversial promotional campaign for the 2nd International Healthy City Conference in the People's Republic of China.Ëëµ„Åø„ÅÆ„Çä and Ëëµ„Åø„ÅÆ„Çä (Minori Aoi) at Japanese Wikipedia, and ËëµÂØ¶ÈáéÁêÜ at Chinese Wikipedia 1999 debuts * Mami Aizawa (Áõ∏Ê≤¢„Åæ„Åø) Debut 1999, Born: 1980/06/15 Tokyo.Avidol Profile; News: 2003/9/14  2000  Anna Ohura became one of the leading big-bust performers in the AV industry, developing an international following. At one point she claimed to have the largest breasts in the Japanese adult film industry. 2000 debut Emily Yoshikawa would become a leading AV actress, and make news in the entertainment field with her retirement from the screen to work in Tokyo's Yoshiwara \\"soapland\\" district in 2004. Nao Oikawa became romantically involved with popular comedian Jinnai Tomonori, and retired from the AV industry in 2004. She followed her AV career with appearances on TV variety shows. Busty, mature actress, Aki Tomozaki's AV debut in 2000, at the age of 30, initiated a career of over 250 appearances. Her attractively motherly appearance and large breasts gave her a leading role opposite younger actors in many AVs with an incest theme. 2000 debuts *Nao Oikawa (ÂèäÂ∑ùÂ•àÂ§Æ / „Åä„ÅÑ„Åã„Çè„Å™„Åä) Debut: 2000, Retired: 2004; Born: 1981/04/21 Saitama Prefecture.Avidol Profile, Web I-dic Profile ; JMDB Filmography; Interview , Interview (Eng); News: 2003/9/14, News: 2006/12/27 * Emily Yoshikawa (ÂêâÂ∑ù„Ç®„Éü„É™„Éº) Debut: 2000; Retired: 2004; Born 1980/6/3 Dominican Republic.Web I-dic Profile , JMDB Filmography; News: 2004/12/30  2001  Ai Kurosawa became a popular and prolific AV actress, winning the \\"Main AV Actress Award\\" at Takeshi Kitano's second Entertainment Awards ceremony. Hitomi Hayasaka, who had planned on majoring in motel management before her AV debut, became one of the more prolific AV performers, making over 120 appearances and still appearing in AVs five years after her debut in the industry. Nozomi Momoi, was one of the more prominent and promising AV debuts of the year, appearing in over 100 AVs within a year of her 2001 debut, However her career would be cut short in October 2002 in a murder-suicide that shocked the nation. Erika Nagai cultivated the image of a martial arts expert in her AVs, and became a favorite of followers of the \\"strong-woman\\" genre which became popular in the 2000s. 2001 debuts *Hitomi Hayasaka  2002  A March 2002 Shukan Bunshun article reported that AV actress Yumika Hayashi, who had made her debut in 1989, participated in a symposium and showing of pink films in the Shibuya district targeted for women. According to a 2003 article, gravure idol Maria Takagi, who made her AV debut in 2002, was then the highest-paid AV actress in Japan. She was paid 300 million yen to perform in 30 films. Called the \\"Aya Matsuura of porn\\", she made her acting debut in the 2003 Fuji Television dramatic series, Anata no Tonari no Dareka Iru.. She retired in 2004 and has appeared in many TV dramas since then. Her other acting appearances include a role in the 2005 horror- comedy, Tokyo Zombie. 2002 debuts *Maria Takagi  2003  Shinji Kubo, a male AV actor who had appeared in over 800 videos, opened the AV Cultures School on May 25, 2003. Established to help aspiring AV directors, actress Eri Kikuchi, who made her AV debut in 1984, was one of the first instructors at this school. Hitomi Kobayashi, who had debuted in 1986 and was called Japan's Queen of Adult Video, announced her retirement with a final, big-budget AV. The widely advertised project was announced for investors in July 2003. Investors in the video would later complain of unethical financial practises. With no previous film-acting experience, Emi Kuroda, an AV veteran of some 200 videos, was chosen to star in 'pink film' director Mitsuru Meike's (2003). Re-released as The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai, the film became a surprise cult hit, playing at 20 international film festivals.Sharp. Behind the Pink Curtain (2008). p.318. Minami Aoyama made her AV debut and pink film debut both in 2003. She would win the Best Actress award at the 2006 Pink Grand Prix.  2004  AV star, , who had debuted in 2000, announced her retirement from the screen in 2004. Her decision to work in Tokyo's red-light Yoshiwara district became a major news item in adult entertainment. Cost for a session with Yoshikawa started at 70,000 yen, which would pay for a trip to Hong Kong and back. Nevertheless, within days of the announcement, Yoshikawa's waiting list was booked three months in advance. Financial controversy following the release of Hitomi Kobayashi's final AV in December 2003, A March 2004 article reported that Kobayashi, who had debuted in 1986, was then working as a hostess at a nightclub in the Roppongi district of Tokyo. Her husband, the former president of her talent agency, was working as her driver. Also in Roppongi, the doors to the bar, \\"Ruka\\", opened in June 2004. This establishment was named after its owner, the retired AV star Ruka Aida, who had made her AV debut in 1995. Hotaru Akane, who debuted in 2004, was named \\"Newcomer of the Year\\" in Weekly Playboy 's 2005 \\"AV Academy Awards\\". Her particular talent with female ejaculation earned her the title \\"Shiofuki Queen\\". (Interview)  2005  Yumika Hayashi's death after celebrating her 35th birthday in June 2005 ended one of the longest careers in the AV field. Debuting in 1989, by the time of her death, she had become known as \\"Japan's Original Adult Video Queen.\\" Her 16-year career included appearances in over 400 videos and films, including a documentary on herself. A December 2005 Asahi Geino article reported on the current careers of several prominent former AV actresses. Yuri Komuro was working as an author, Nao Saejima was working as an artist. Ruka Aida was still operating her self-named bar in Roppongi, which she had opened the previous year. Sally Yoshino had returned to her favorite form of adult entertainment, performing as a striptease dancer. Hitomi Hasegawa was planning and appearing in \\"sexy events\\" as an \\"erotic missionary.\\"  2006  Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry pushes indies and old-line AV makers to work together to enforce common standards regarding rating and mosaics. Adult video conglomerate Soft On Demand and tabloid paper Tokyo Sports inaugurated the AV Open contest for most sales with eighteen AV companies submitting entries.  2007  The Japanese police raid NEVA headquarters, and arrest NEVA officials and JAV company presidents charging them with allowing mosaics which are too thin.  2008  The AV Grand Prix ceremony succeeded the AV Open. , starring 2002 \\"mature woman\\" debut Maki Tomoda, won \\"Best SM Video\\".  2009  Busty gravure idol Fuko made her AV debut on February 1, 2009. 2009 debuts - Fuko  2010  NEVA and SOD group's Content Soft Association hand over their duties to the newly created Ethics Organization of Video ending the division between old-line and indies JAV makers with regard to mosaics and rating.

Cryptic family protein 1B is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CFC1B gene. Cryptic family protein 1B acts as a receptor for the TGF beta signaling pathway. It has been associated with the translation of an extracellular protein for this pathway. The extracellular protein which Cripto encodes plays a crucial role in the development of left and right division of symmetry. Crypto is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored co- receptor that binds nodal and the activin type I ActRIB (ALK)-4 receptor (ALK4).  Structure  Cripto is composed of two adjacent cysteine-rich motifs: the EGF-like and the CFC of an N-terminal signal peptide and of a C-terminal hydrophobic region attached by a GPI anchor, which makes it a potentially essential element in the signaling pathway directing vertebrate embryo development. NMR data confirm that the CFC domain has a C1-C4, C2-C6, C3-C5 disulfide pattern and show that structures are rather flexible and globally extended, with three non-canonical anti-parallel strands.  Function  In the Nodal signaling pathway of embryonic development, Cripto has been shown to have dual function as a co-receptor as well as ligand. Particularly in cell cultures, it has been shown to act as a signaling molecule with the capabilities of a growth factor, and in co-culture assays, it has displayed the property of a co-ligand to Nodal. Glycosylation is responsible for mediating this interface with Nodal. EGF-CFC proteins‚Äô composition as a receptor complex is further solidified by the GPI linkage, making the cell membrane connection able to regulate growth factor signaling of Nodal.  Expression during embryonic development  High concentrations of Cripto are found in both the trophoblast and inner cell mass, along the primitive streak as the second epithelial-mesenchymal transformation event occurs to form the mesoderm, and in the myocardium of the developing heart. Though no specific defect has been formally associated with mutations in Cripto, in vitro studies that disrupt gene function at various times during development have provided glimpses of possible malformations. For example, inactivation of Cripto during gastrulation disrupted the migration of newly formed mesenchymal mesoderm cells, resulting in the accumulation of cells around the primitive streak and eventual embryonic death. Other results of Cripto disruption include the lack of posterior structures. and a block on the differentiation of cardiac myocyte,. both of which lead to embryonic death. Cripto's functions have been hypothesized from these null mutation studies. It is now known that Cripto is similar to other morphogens originating from the primitive streak in that it is asymmetrically expressed, specifically in a proximal-distal gradient, explaining the failure of posterior structures to form in the absence of Cripto.  Clinical significance  CFC1B has oncogene potential due to the tumor cell proliferation through initiation by autocrine or paracrine signaling. Furthermore, the cryptic protein is highly over-expressed in many tumors such as colorectal, gastric, breast, and pancreatic cancers in homosapiens. Cripto is one of the key regulators of embryonic stem cells differentiation into cardiomyocyte vs. neuronal fate. Expression levels of cripto are associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitors.

Organizations  Since joining the Texas Back Institute in 1996, Zigler has been an international guest lecturer on topics in spinal reconstruction, as well as a Principal Investigator for the ProDisc artificial disc replacement system's U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clinical studies. He is a former Clinical Associate Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. He served as President of the American Spinal Injury Association from 2003 to 2005.www.asia-spinalinjury.org profiles  Role as ProDisc Principal Investigator  Zigler's role as Principal Investigator for the ProDisc, Synthes Spine's artificial disc replacement system, was to monitor all the clinical ProDisc cases done at the Texas Back Institute, and also to serve as a resource to Synthes on questions about cases done at all of the 19 other investigative sites. On August 14, 2006, the ProDisc-L (\\"lumbar\\") Total Disc Replacement was approved by the FDA for use as a treatment for functionally disabling pain from lumbar degenerative disc disease (\\"DDD\\"). It was the second device to be approved by the FDA for such a purpose. As a condition of approval, Synthes Spine is required to conduct a five-year study assessing the long-term safety and effectiveness of the disc. The study will include the 286 patients who participated in the pre-approval clinical trials. The company is also required to complete an annual analysis and report any major adverse events (such as implant breakage, subsidence or expulsion from the disc space). These conditions are similar to those imposed on the Charite artificial disc. Zigler is himself responsible for publication of the national data now that the ProDisc-L has been FDA-approved. More recently, questions about ethics of surgeon investigators in the Pro Disc study have been raised, specifically in a New York Times article about conflicts of interest related to his Zigler's financial ties, in which it is reported that he invested $25,000 in the company.www.nytimes.com 1/30/2008 Since the time of these articles, there has been no substantiation to support the New York Times' allegations, and a follow-up FDA audit of Zigler's ProDisc site prompted by these allegations turned up no evidence of any wrongdoing.  In the media  Zigler has appeared as a guest expert on Orange County News network in Orange County, California, as well as Good Morning Texas, a morning show produced by the ABC affiliate WFAA-TV in Dallas, Texas.

The district also has six K‚Äì5 schools (Dandridge Elementary, Jefferson Elementary, Mount Horeb Elementary, New Market Elementary, Piedmont Elementary, and Talbott Elementary) and two middle schools (Jefferson Middle and Maury Middle School). Jefferson County High School opened in August 1975 as a result of the reorganization of all elementary schools and the consolidation of the existing high schools. Students from White Pine, Rush Strong, Maury, and Jefferson High Schools combined to form a student body of nearly 2300+ in grades 9‚Äì12. In its first year of operation, the high school was recognized by the Tennessee School Board Association as the \\"School of the Year\\" in Tennessee. The academic, athletic, and activity programs have continued to excel since its opening. Jefferson County High School is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The Jefferson County School District has also received District SACS accreditation. The high school is located in the geographic center of Jefferson County. The location is approximately fifteen miles from the most distant commuting student in the county. The campus consists of including a stadium, gymnasium, playing fields, tennis courts, and the academic complex. The enrollment is approximately 1800 students. In 2007, Jefferson County Schools embarked on a $78 million building program intended to provide additional classroom space in the elementary schools and renovations to the high school. The main campus of the high school has repairs started after rain in 2013 caused roofing to collapse. Prior to these repairs none had taken place since the building of the school in 1974. Repairs were completed in December 2015, including refurbished classrooms, a new fine arts wing, and an auditorium with a capacity of around 600. The Patriot Academy, a division of the school catering to freshmen, located down the road from the high school, was opened in 2013. Students from the 2013-2014 school year have reported leaks during the first year of that building's use. Some students expressed fear that their school was as dangerous as the main campus. Since then maintenance crews have stopped further leaking and fixed the problems with the roof.

He has also competed in the 2002 and 2006 Commonwealth Games finishing 6th and 5th respectively. Kris Gemmell has been racing on the International Triathlon Union (ITU) World Cup circuit since 1998 and has had numerous wins and podium finishes. Career progression When Kris moved from Palmerston North to Christchurch in the late 1990s to study at the University of Canterbury, he was an aspiring Rugby union player. However an injury led to a chain of events that resulted in Kris coming to the attention and under the guidance of Doctor John Hellemans. Hellemans is a well known multiple World Champion Triathlete and coach. In 1997, Gemmell competed in the ITU junior World Championships in Perth Australia coming a 6th in a field that included future World Champion Ivan Rana. Kris' break through race on the world stage in the senior ranks came in 2000 when he claimed 3rd place at the Tokyo round of the ITU World Cup. Gemmell was selected for the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England where he placed second for New Zealand and sixth in overall. Later that year, he became World Champion in the aquathon before later in the week backing it up with an 8th place at the Triathlon World Championships in Canc√∫n Mexico. Disappointment followed as Kris suffered some injuries and missed selection to the three-person New Zealand Olympic team for Athens in 2004. Nevertheless, the year ended on a high note with his first ITU World Cup victory in Gamagori, Japan. 2005 and 2006 saw more good results on the World stage and selection to his second Commonwealth games this time in Melbourne Australia. After finishing 5th Kris had a series of 4th placings including at the World Championships in Lausanne Switzerland. Kris also won at Corner Brook Canada and his consistent year was rewarded with 5th place in the ITU points rankings for the year (2006). In 2007, Gemmell had enjoyed another consistent season with three podiums and two fourth places. One of those fourths was at the Beijing round of the ITU World Cup and this result gained Kris a nomination for the New Zealand Triathlon team to race at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. At Beijing, he finished in 39th place. He qualified again for the 2012 Summer Olympics, and finished in 15th place. Cycling Kris has also raced alongside professional cyclists in UCI sanctioned events such as the Tour of Southland and the Tour of Wellington. In 2007 Kris joined the Subway team for the Tour of Wellington as they both are sponsored by Avanti Bikes to kick start his season. In the media Kris narrowly missed selection to the 2004 Olympics in Athens but was named as 'first reserve'. After training with other team members Hamish Carter and Bevan Docherty in France Kris was invited by TVNZ to give 'expert' comments on the men's and women's races. Carter and Docherty famously claimed the Gold and Silver medals and Gemmell was able to reassure broadcaster Brendon Telfer and the New Zealand Television audience that the Australian Greg Bennett would not catch the two New Zealanders.

Biography  Chmielowski was born in the Volhynia, province of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, in 1700. He had been studying in Jesuits schools since 1715 in Lviv before he was accepted to the Seminary in Lviv in 1722. After that, as a young priest, he was a preceptor to Dymitr Jab≈Çonowski from the powerful Jablonowski family. Thanks to them he get soon the clergy house in Firlej√≥w (called –õ–∏–ø—ñ–≤–∫–∞ nowadays) near Rohatyn in 1725. Before 1743 he had become a prelate to Lviv's archbishop Miko≈Çaj Gerard Wy≈ºycki. During the 1750s he had become a parson in Podkamie≈Ñ (modern West Ukraine) and the dean (Christianity) in Rohatyn. Since 1761 he was also Kiev's canon. He lived almost all his life in the Firlej√≥w and devoted himself to the encyclopedic work. He died in Firlej√≥w in 1763. He is famous as the author of the first Polish-language encyclopedia called Nowe Ateny published in Lviv in the years: 1745-1746 and 1754-1756 in four volumes finally. Chmielowski is also the author of the popular prayer Bieg roku ca≈Çego (1728), printed in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The laws on its role and function vary by jurisdiction. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, all inquests were once conducted with a jury. They acted somewhat like a grand jury, determining whether a person should be committed to trial in connection to a death. Such a jury was made up of up to twenty- three men, and required the votes of twelve to render a decision. Similar to a grand jury, a coroner's jury merely accused, it did not convict. Since 1927, coroner's juries have rarely been used in England. Under the Coroners Act 1988,Coroners Act, 1988, s 8(3) a jury is only required to be convened in cases where the death occurred in prison, police custody, or in circumstances which may affect public health or safety. The coroner can actually choose to convene a jury in any investigation, but in practice this is rare. The qualifications to sit on a coroner's jury are the same as those to sit on a jury in Crown Court, the High Court, and the County Court. Additionally, a coroner's jury only determines cause of death, its ruling does not commit a person to trial. While grand juries, which did have the power to indict, were abolished in the United Kingdom by 1948 (after being effectively stopped in 1933), coroner's juries retained those powers until the Criminal Law Act 1977. This change came about after Lord Lucan was charged in 1975 by a coroner's jury in the death of Sandra Rivett, his children's nanny. United States A coroner's jury deemed Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and their posse guilty in the death of Frank Stilwell in March 1882. In the aftermath of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, a coroner's jury found factory owners Isaac Harris and Max Blanck responsible for the death of Mary Herman, a factory operator. A coroner's jury ruled that the 2018 Hart family crash in Mendocino County, California was deliberate.

It comprises a mix of single-family detached homes, apartment buildings and other semi-detached dwellings. It also contains a number of commercial zones with businesses. As of 2009, the area was home to 4,405 residents. The neighbourhood is considered a middle-income area, with an average family income of $42,236, an average dwelling value of $245,254 and a home ownership rate of 28.6%. History City Park was originally known as Central Park and first had a golf course. In 1903, the annual exhibition was moved from the Louise Grounds in Nutana to City Park, and a horse racing track and grandstand were constructed. By 1910, the exhibition had moved to its permanent home in the city's south end. The outline of the old racetrack can still be seen in what is now Kinsmen Park. City Park was one of the first areas annexed by the city after its incorporation in 1906. The Alexander Residence, built in 1912 on Spadina Crescent, was named for Dr. Harold E. and Edith Alexander, who owned the house from 1916 to 1946. It is one of the city's most notable examples of pre-World War I Arts and Crafts architecture. It was designated a municipal heritage property on May 12, 2001. Government and politics City Park exists within the federal electoral district of Saskatoon West. It is currently represented by Sheri Benson of the New Democratic Party, first elected in 2015. Provincially, the area is within the constituency of Saskatoon Meewasin. It is currently represented by Ryan Meili of the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party, first elected in a 2017 by-election. In Saskatoon's non-partisan municipal politics, City Park lies within ward 1. It is currently represented by Darren Hill, first elected in 2006. Institutions =Education= * City Park School - a K-12 school operated by Saskatoon Public Schools. Originally opened as City Park Collegiate in 1929, it served as a mainstream high school from its opening until 1984 when it closed as a result of the opening of Marion M. Graham Collegiate in the city's Silverwood Heights neighborhood. The school's former athletic program's teams were known as the Cowboys. City Park Collegiate was re-established in 1986 as an alternative education program to meet the needs of students having difficulty in the regular school setting. In 2003‚Äì2004, the timetable was expanded to a fully modified program. This program offered modified versions of compulsory high school courses along with many regular-level, hands-on electives. The facility was renovated in 2015 and is now a multi-use school hosting various division programs including an elementary Montessori program, an online learning center, Ecoquest, Outdoor School and more. =Health= * Saskatoon City Hospital - originally opened in 1909 as western Canada's first municipal hospital. The original building was on 6th Avenue North; by 1927 a larger facility was built at the present site on Queen Street. It was expanded in 1930 and again in 1950. In the 1990s, part of the hospital was demolished and replaced the current building, completed in 1993. The hospital offers full acute care services, surgical facilities, and other specialized services. Unlike Saskatoon's other two hospitals, Royal University Hospital and St. Paul's Hospital, the emergency department of City Hospital is not open 24 hours a day. Parks and recreation * Wilson Park - * Mendel Site Park - * Meewasin Park - * Kinsmen Park - The Mendel Art Gallery is Saskatoon's major public art gallery, containing works of art from local, national and international artists. Attached to the gallery is Saskatoon's civic conservatory, containing seasonal flower displays as well as tropical and arid plants. The City Park Community Association organizes social and leisure programs, such as adult fitness, children/youth sports and preschool playgrounds. The association also maintains the outdoor rink at the former First Nations University of Canada campus. Public services City Park is a part of the central division of the Saskatoon Police Services patrol system. Saskatoon Fire & Protective Services' central division covers the neighbourhood. Transit services to City Park are provided by Saskatoon Transit on routes 12 (River Heights/City Centre) and 14 (North Industrial/City Centre). Commercial City Park contains several business districts. On the west side and south sides of the neighbourhood are commercial zones immediately adjacent to the Central Business District. Several professional businesses line Queen Street, which runs past Saskatoon City Hospital. There is a small collection of businesses near the center of City Park, at 7th Avenue North and Princess Street. Finally, there are businesses along the north edge of the neighbourhood, parallel to the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks. There are 66 home-based businesses in City Park. Location City Park is located within the Core Neighbourhoods Suburban Development Area. It is bounded by the South Saskatchewan River to the east, railway tracks to the west, 33rd Street to the north, and 25th Street to the south. Most Streets are laid out in a grid plan, with avenues running north‚Äìsouth and streets running east‚Äìwest. Some roads in the south and west parts of City Park are angled to align with their continuations in the Central Business District.

Jones in the period 1928‚Äì1929 for the British branch of the Linotype company, and based on the Garamond typeface that was used in a book printed by the Parisian Jean Poupy in 1592. The roman design was from Claude Garamond and the italic version was from Robert Granjon. Because several other Garamonds were on the market in the 1920s, Jones decided to name his type Granjon. Jones, a master printer based in London, had been engaged by Linotype to improve the quality of their typeface range through the development of revivals of notable type designs of the past. Granjon was popular in the metal type era and Beatrice Warde described it as her favourite revival of French renaissance typefaces in her famous 1926 article on the topic; it was also praised by former Linotype designer Walter Tracy. (Many of the Garamond revivals of the 1920s were later shown to be actually based on the types of Jean Jannon; Granjon was an exception to this. Warde commented \\"It would seem that Garamond's name, having so long been used on a design he never cut, is now by stern justice left off a face which is undoubtedly his.\\") Jones developed a companion bold named Bernhard, named for sixteenth-century engraver Bernard Salomon. A longtime popular text type, Granjon's digital version is sometimes criticized as being \\"anemic\\" in smaller point sizes. Mastering the Art of French Cooking, vols. I & II (by Julia Child, Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle) were set in Granjon typeface. References *Friedl, Frederich, Nicholas Ott and Bernard Stein.

Background and early years D'Amore is the daughter of immigrants, who migrated from Italy in 1964. She was educated at Bethlehem College, Ashfield and the University of Sydney and was an officer for the Municipal Employees Union and the NSW Nurses‚Äô Association. New South Wales state politics D'Amore was elected at the 2003 NSW general election. In March 2010, D'Amore was appointed Parliamentary Secretary Assisting the Minister for Police and Parliamentary Secretary Assisting the Minister for Climate Change and Environment in the Kristina Keneally Labor government. D'Amore's previous parliamentary experience includes: *Chair of the Committee on the Office of the Ombudsman and Police Integrity Commission. 2007 - 2008 *Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Women's Representative for Australia *Deputy Chair of Committee of the International Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Women's Steering D'Amore proposed major infrastructure changes in the area, such as the M4 east and Iron Cove Bridge widening.. It was claimed that the widening would complement D'Amore's announcement of securing 400 new bus services in March 2010. The M4 East extension is aimed at channelling traffic underground, easing pressure on surface roads, to get Sydney buses running on time effectively and efficiently. D'Amore has noted that the tunnel would be a major public transport outcome for the Inner West. On 22 September 2010, it was revealed that D'Amore was under investigation by ICAC relating to the implementation of a 2006 draft guideline. The matter was in relation to whether relief officers worked in parliament house or at the Drummoyne electorate office. The relief officers had worked the correct days, on the correct rate of pay and undertook the correct duties but had undertaken their electorate duties in Parliament house rather than the Drummoyne electorate office. Further, the NSW Parliament Employee Services Manager stated during the investigation, the relief officers forms had been amended and approved by Parliament as they were in the 'spirit of the draft guideline'. Subsequently, Ms D'Amore was not made aware by Parliament that relief officers had not completed forms correctly. Despite this on 7 December 2010, the ICAC made adverse findings against D'Amore and was of the opinion that the advice of the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) should be sought in relation to prosecuting D'Amore. D'Amore stated she was appalled at the findings and parliamentary colleagues openly stating that she had been unfairly targeted by the ICAC. She remained a Labor member until the NSW state election in 2011. In late 2013 the DPP advised the ICAC that there was insufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution of D'Amore based on ICAC's adverse findings. The DPP's advice was accepted by the ICAC.

It is one of the largest pulp and paper companies in the world. It was founded by Eka Tjipta Widjaja with the help of co-founder Singgih Wahab Kwik (Kowik) who was also the adviser of the previous owners of Indah Kiat (Jap Swie Kie a.k.a Soetopo Jananto) and former head of commissary and deputy of Sinar Mas Group. With 14 major companies in Indonesia and China, APP has a current annual combined pulp, paper, and packaging-grade capacity of more than 18 million tons per year, and markets its products to more than 150 countries across six continents. History Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) has its roots in 1972 when Eka Tjipta Widjaja founded a small caustic soda manufacturer called Tjiwi Kimia. In 1978, Tjiwi Kimia commenced paper production of 12,000 tons/year. In December 1976, Indah Kiat was formed as a joint venture between CV Berkat (an Indonesian company), Chung Hwa Pulp Corporation, and Yuen Foong Yu Paper Manufacturing Company Ltd. from Taiwan. In April 1979, Indah Kiat Tangerang mill's Paper Machine 1 and 2 started with a production of 100 tons/day of wood free paper. By March 1984, Indah Kiat Perawang mill's Pulp Machine 1 started producing bleached hardwood kraft pulp with an initial capacity of 250 tons/day. In May 1986, Sinar Mas Group acquired 67% of Indah Kiat's total shares by the order of Singgih Wahab Kwik (Kowik). Chung Hwa and Yuen Foong Yu had 23% and 10% shares, respectively. In 1987, the first cast coating machine was installed at Tjiwi Kimia, and in April 1990 Tjiwi Kimia was listed on the Jakarta and Surabaya Stock Exchange. In 1991, Tjiwi Kimia's PM 9 started operation with an annual capacity of 207,000 tons. The following year, Indah Kiat acquired PT Sinar Dunia Makmur, a manufacturer of industrial paper located in Serang with a production capacity of 900 tons per day. Tjiwi Kimia commissioned the Carbonless Paper Plant (CPP) in March 1993 as an experiment. Pindo Deli, a paper company affiliated with APP, was under the control of CPP in February 1994, and by 1997 its paper machines No. 8 and No. 9 began operating with a production capacity of 240,000 tons per year. In 1998, paper machine No. 11 started tissue production with an annual production capacity of 400,000 tons. APP-China began investing in China in 1992, with an emphasis on the Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas. APP-China's pulp and paper mills now include Ningbo Zhonghua, Goldeast Paper, Ningbo Asia, Gold Huasheng, Gold Hongye, Hainan Jinhai Pulp and Paper, and Guangxi Jingui Pulp & Paper.APP-China Sustainability Report 2009, APP, Bund Center, Shanghai, China, Nov. 2010.

In June 2016, Asia Pulp and Paper contributed to an effort concerning \\"the conservation and promotion of primary forests and the protection of their biodiversity\\", which was discussed at a declaration in Milan, Italy with the Green Green management institute. Asia Pulp and Paper has a close relationship with China Development Bank (CDB) which has been a crucial backer for their modern operations. They have provided the funding for the recent pulp mill expansions in Indonesia. Indah Kiat Perawang Indah Kiat Perawang is APP's largest pulp mill in Indonesia. Its pulp is sold to APP paper mills in Indonesia and China. Indah Kiat Perawang increased its pulp production from approximately 2 million tonnes in 2009 to an estimated 2.3 million in 2010‚Äì2011. The mill has been cited by Greenpeace as significantly harming the survival prospects of endangered Ramin trees and Sumatran Tigers; however, the accusation was denied by the Ministry of Forestry who did an investigation regarding the report. Sustainability Roadmap =NGO and activist criticism= As a result of the announcement of its zero deforestation plan, Greenpeace, Rainforest Action Network and other NGOs expressed cautious optimism and welcomed the company's Forest Conservation Policy. Greenpeace also agreed to halt its global campaign against APP and open discussions to ensure that the company properly implements its policy. Various NGOs have criticized APP on environmental grounds. According to a Friends of the Earth report from 2005, APP has cleared over 280,000 hectares of rainforest in the past decade and planned to cut another 300,000 over the next five years.indonesia trees Indonesia without trees? Record breaking logging of last rainforests Friends of the Earth APP has launched a Forest Conservation Policy to restore and support one million hectares of Indonesian Rainforest. The company has been at the center of many environmental controversies and has been accused of being involved in illegal logging in Indonesia. The company is also known for defaulting on debt repayments in 2001, during a period of wide- scale financial problems in the South East Asia region. In 2003, APP signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the World Wildlife Fund, but this ended six months later after WWF refused to approve the environmental management plan. Despite the failure of the WWF partnership, APP entered into a five-year partnership with Rainforest Alliance in 2005. This partnership was supposed to allow Rainforest Alliance to identify and monitor high conservation value forest within four concessions managed by APP in Pulau Muda, Serapung, Siak, and Bukit Batu, and provide independent \\"verification statements\\" to attest to the scope and results of the company's efforts to protect these high conservation value areas. Rainforest Alliance made several requests for changes in the management of these areas in the first year of the contract and found that the situation had deteriorated by late 2006 and some areas had been cleared, leading Rainforest Alliance to terminate the agreement in February 2007, stating, \\"The company has not demonstrated a comprehensive, consistent or dedicated approach toward conservation management necessary to maintain or enhance the forest ecosystems fundamental to the survival of the High Conservation Value Forests present there.\\" In February 2014, the Rainforest Alliance announced it would evaluate the progress of APP's forest conservation policy and commitments, including its pledge to stop clearing natural forests across its supply chains in Indonesia. Upon re-engaging with APP, Richard Donovan, the organization's Vice President of Forestry said: \\"There is strong commitment at the highest levels of the organization, and also welcomed by Greenpeace, which signals that APP is serious this time around.\\" In November 2007, Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) formally disassociated itself with APP, rescinding the rights of APP to use its logo. On the termination of all ties with the FSC in 2007, a spokesman for WWF commented, \\"Apparently the company has decided to run a global propaganda campaign rather than protect forests with high conservation values. \\" In March 2008, an investigation by an environmental coalition called Eyes on the Forest showed evidence of a new road built by APP, heading through the Kampar peninsula, one of the world's largest contiguous tropical peat swamp forests, with more carbon per hectare than any other ecosystem on Earth. The investigation found tracks on the new road of the critically endangered Sumatran tiger, whose wild population has been reduced to less than 500 individuals. APP claimed that it was building this state-of-the-art, paved highway for the benefit of the local communities, though satellite imagery shows that the road does not go anywhere near the two settlements. The authors of the report stated, \\"We strongly urge APP to join the ranks of responsible businesses and conduct its operations within the law.\\" Since 2016, NGOs have raised their concern of the new 3 million tons capacity PT OKI mill that APP planned to build in South Sumatra, highlighting the risk of growing demand for fiber becoming an obstacle to a proper zero deforestation policy implementation. In response, APP insisted to have enough long-term fiber supply for the pulp production increase by referencing an assessment report that the company refused to share with NGOs and the public. =Sustainability Roadmap Vision 2020= On 5 June 2012, APP announced its Sustainability Roadmap Vision 2020 plan, in which the company pledged to be wholly reliant on raw materials from plantations and that all its suppliers must operate by High Conservation Value Forest (HCVF) standards by 2015 following independent audits. This program led to: * 14 November 2012: All nine of APP's Indonesian mills had received SVLK timber legality certification, which is the Indonesian Timber Legality Assurance System, designed to ensure the mills only receive and process timber from legal sources, and that all products exported from the country are traceable to verifiable points of origin. APP was then authorized by the European Commission to import fiber products. * 5 February 2013: Immediate halt of natural forest clearance across its entire supply chain. * Partnership with the non-profit organisation The Forest Trust, which is assisting the company with High Conservation Value (HCV) and High Carbon Stock (HCS) assessments to identify forested areas for protection. TFT worked with APP and Greenpeace to design APP's Forest Conservation Policy and will be monitoring and reporting on APP's progress towards achieving its commitments. In addition, APP's policy specifically welcomes third party observers to verify the implementation ‚Äì a first for APP and the industry. * 5 June 2013: Absolute deadline of 31 August 2013 for all-natural forest wood felled before 1 February 2013 to be accepted at its pulp mills. APP also launched a pilot online monitoring dashboard, which provides access to updated technical information. * 5 February 2014: Forest Conservation Policy (FCP) Anniversary Report with a call for NGOs, governments, and businesses to work together to help tackle deforestation in Indonesia. From the study's Executive Summary: > On 5 February 2013, Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) announced: \\"an end to the > clearing of natural forest across its entire supply chain in Indonesia, with > immediate effect\\".

APP later received the Singapore Environment Council‚Äôs (SEC) enhanced Green Label certification, heralding the return of its products to Singapore shelves. On 20 December 2017, Associated Press reporter Stephen Wright revealed exclusive news that Asia Pulp & Paper has extensive behind-the-scenes ties and significant influence over wood suppliers linked to fires and deforestation that have degraded Indonesia's natural environment. Soon after the report, ten international NGOs such as Wetlands International, Rainforest Action Network, and World Wide Fund for Nature released a joint statement that APP did not make enough progress as they promised in their Forest Conservation Policy right before APP released the fifth-anniversary report on 5 February 2018. On 17 May 2018, Greenpeace International ended all engagement with Asia Pulp & Paper because according to their research APP destroyed around 8000 acres of virgin forests in Indonesia. On 30 May 2018, Auriga, an environmental organization, reported PT Bumi Mekar Hijau and PT Sebangun Bumi Andalas Wood Industries, which APP claimed are \\"independently owned and operated\\", actually have apparent close links with the Sinar Mas Group, APP's parent conglomerate on their corporate registry documents. On 5 June 2018, Mongabay also reported: \\"One of the world‚Äôs biggest paper producers continues to deny that it secretly owns most of the companies supplying it with wood, despite mounting evidence to the contrary.\\" On 10 July 2018, Mongabay interviewed two of APP's ex-employees and they said APP management used their names for a secret company in Borneo. On 16 August 2018, Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) decided to suspend the process of re-associating with Asia Pulp & Paper. Greenpeace campaigns =Mattel= On 8 June 2011, Greenpeace launched \\"Barbie, It's Over\\", an international campaign criticising Mattel's use of Asia Pulp & Paper products in its packaging, particularly in its line of Barbie products. Within two days of the campaign's start, Mattel ordered its packaging suppliers to stop buying from Asia Pulp & Paper pending an investigation into Greenpeace's deforestation allegations and further ordered its suppliers to report on how they source materials. Asia Pulp & Paper welcomed Mattel's response, believing that Mattel's investigation would conclude that its \\"packaging materials are more than 95% recycled paper sourced from around the world.\\" On 5 October 2011, Phil Radford of Greenpeace announced that Mattel stated that it would no longer purchase pulp and paper products from Asia Pulp & Paper due to the effects that its logging practices had on the Sumatran tiger population. Greenpeace has been working together with APP from 2013 to the present. =Sumatran tiger incident= To help conserve the critically endangered Sumatran tiger, APP has created a 106,000-hectare sanctuary, Senepis Buluhala Tiger Sanctuary from four companies logging concessions. The sanctuary is surrounded and protected by production forests, where workers are continually on guard for illegal logging and wildfires that threaten the endangered Sumatran tigers' habitat. However, this conservation effort has been proven to be ineffective. During late July 2011, Greenpeace revealed images and footage on their websiteEndangered Sumatran tiger dies in trap on APP concession in Indonesia ‚Äì Greenpeace 25 July 2011 that showed a Sumatran tiger than had become trapped by an animal snare at the edge of an APP concession. The tiger is reported to have been there for at least seven days, without food or water. Attempts to tranquilize and rescue the tiger failed due to its poor condition of health. APP stated that the trap was set by local villagers and was intended to target small mammals. In February 2012, WWF listed US toilet papers that may have a direct impact on the 400 Sumatran tigers left in the wild.Don't Flush Tiger Forests WWF 8 February 2012 =Ramin logging= Ramin trees (Gonystylus) are legally protected under Indonesia's laws and its national CITES regulations. Sumatra's peat swamp forests are a key ramin habitat.The Ramin Paper Trail Asia Pulp & Paper Under Investigation ‚Äì Part 2 in short Greenpeace 1 March 2012 In 2012, Greenpeace did an expos√© video on APP's illegal logging practices. In the video, they show logs from ramin trees sitting in an APP pulp yard. According to Greenpeace in March 2012, APP's main pulp mill in Indonesia (Indah Kiat Perawang) mixes illegal ramin logs regularly with other rainforest species in its pulpwood supply. APP denied the allegations, stating \\"APP is grateful to Greenpeace for bringing this report to our attention. We take very seriously any evidence of violation of the regulations concerning the protection of endangered tree species‚Ä¶APP maintains a strict zero-tolerance policy for illegal wood entering the supply chain and has comprehensive chain of custody (CoC) systems to ensure that only legal wood enters its pulp mill operations.\\" Since Indonesia banned the logging and trade of ramin in 2001, more than one-quarter of this ramin habitat has been cleared ‚Äì much of this from areas currently supplying APP. Government maps show that 800,000ha (28%) of Sumatra's peat swamp forests were cleared between 2003 and 2009. In 2003, 80% of Sumatra's peat swamp forests, a key ramin habitat, were also identified as a critical habitat for the survival of Sumatran tigers. =Operational criticism= In 2004, Zhejiang Hotels Association announced that it would no longer purchase APP products because of the firm's illegal logging activities in Yunnan province, leading APP to threaten to sue. The suit was later dropped because of a major publicity campaign by Greenpeace China. In 2005, APP was also found to be conducting illegal logging in Yunnan Province in China, while a subsidiary of the firm called \\"Green Rich\\" was caught illegally logging in Cambodia. According to Asia Times Online, APP's business model is a tactically aggressive one: it turns huge profits by quickly stripping forests bare, exploiting age-old forests and indigenous peoples, and leaving town before the environmental consequences are felt. The authors of the report stated, \\"We strongly urge APP to join the ranks of responsible businesses and conduct its operations within the law.\\" In January 2008, the office retailer Staples ended their 11-year relationship with APP, which had formerly supplied between 5 and 9% of the paper sold at the chain \\"due to their clear lack of progress in improving their environmental performance.\\"Bloomberg.com Staples Ends Contracts With Asia Pulp on Environment. 7 February 2008. Staples Ends Contracts With Asia Pulp on Environment (Update1) , Heather Burke ‚Äì 7 February 2008 21:52 Other companies including Office Depot and Wal-Mart had cut ties previously on environmental grounds, and these have been followed more recently by Australian retailer Woolworths Limited. In 2010, APP hired the public relations firm Greenspirit Strategies, run by former Greenpeace activist Patrick Moore, to boost their image. Moore, in turn, authored a report that describes APP as not responsible for deforestation but that it is caused mostly by locals \\"illegally encroaching on forests in search of better livelihoods. By employing Indonesian people, APP is reducing deforestation, as more employment means less poverty, which means less pressure to move into the forest\\". The Guardian reported that Moore plagiarized large sections of the report from an APP public relations brochure. In 2011, when asked if he believes APP is sincere in reforming its logging practices, Dorjee Sun, CEO of Carbon Conservation, stated that: \\"Change in large organizations always takes time, so our goal by 2020 is to build sustainability practices, targets and a roadmap with accountable milestones which will result in true sustainability throughout the entire corporation.\\" APP continues construction and logging in Sumatra's Kampar peninsula. In February 2013, APP committed to improving forest conservation, which it dubbed its Forest Conservation Policy. However, from 2013 to the present, APP also planned and/or implemented several major expansions to increase production capacity. Because overcapacity has been linked to negative environmental and social impacts, APP partners raised concerns that the commitments outlined in the Forest Conservation Policy could not be met. In response to these concerns, APP commissioned an independent study to analyze whether it would be able to meet its commitments. According to APP, the September 2014 unpublished results from The Growth & Yield ‚Äì Wood Supply Study \\"confirmed that Asia Pulp and Paper Group (APP) has sufficient plantation resources to meet the pulp requirements of its existing mills as well as its future mill in OKI, South Sumatra\\". However, since the results were never published it is not possible to verify the results of the study, nor can the claim of independence be verified. A 2016 study \\"by twelve international and Indonesian NGOs shows that in spite of its high-profile sustainability commitments, Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) is building one of the world's largest pulp mills in the Indonesian province of South Sumatra without a sustainable wood supply.\\" \\"In March 2014, the former governor of Indonesia's Riau province was sentenced to 14 years in prison and ordered to pay almost USD90,000 in fines for illegally issuing logging permits to APP subsidiaries. In addition, three wood suppliers of APP are among 14 companies which the Ministry of Environment has under examination for possible liability suits over environmental damages.\\" With high-profile criminal cases linked to the corporation, concerns remain about APP and its conduct in relation to environmental and social issues, including the prevention of \\"catastrophic fires in the [South Sumatran] region\\" and \\"severe land subsidence, [and] increasing flooding\\". Controversies In 1994, the company moved its headquarters from Indonesia to Singapore and began to borrow money to expand aggressively. It was soon heavily leveraged; from 1996 to 1998, it only produced 1.5 times as much cash flow as its interest costs. In March 2001, during the Asian Debt Crises, APP declared a moratorium on U.S.$13.9 billion in debt, resulting in one of the largest debt defaults in the Asian market. Most of the debt was subsequently rescheduled at lower values.\\"Asia Pulp & Paper to Default on $12 Billion in Debt\\" Bloomberg, 12 March 2001 In November 2003, Jakarta-based subsidiary Indah Kiat sued the underwriter and holders of an issue of debt (in United States dollars) it had issued in 1994 under New York law; it sued, however, in Indonesia, and in February 2007 the Indonesian court declared the debt invalid. The resulting bankruptcy in what was the biggest missed bond obligation by an Asian company to date. Bloomberg later commented that the affair was, \\"A cautionary tale of greed, blind optimism, and the East-West divide\\". In 2001, APP was the subject of a probe by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) in Singapore, after creditors and investors cried foul when APP defaulted on the US$13.9 billion of debt earlier that year. But the case, along with a parallel probe by the CAD into APP's sister company, Asia Food and Properties, was closed two years later without any disclosure as to why the firms were investigated. In November 2003, Jakarta-based subsidiary Indah Kiat sued the underwriter and holders of an issue of debt (in United States dollars) it had issued in 1994 under New York law; it sued, however, in Indonesia, and in February 2007 the Indonesian court declared the debt invalid. In 2017 an Associated Press investigation found the company to have consistently reneged on the terms set by itself as part of non-deforestation promises throughout the entire period of the relationship with Greenpeace. The NGO responded by issuing a statement calling on APP customers to cancel their contracts. The firm today has operations in several countries across Southeast Asia and China, and regularly reports more than a billion US dollars in revenues. On January 20, The London Economic posted and an article saying that \\"Sinar Mas a poster child for the paper industry‚Äôs duplicity\\": COP25: the climate protection mirage But such deceptive behaviour by no means the exclusive privilege of the fossil fuel industry‚Äîand its prevalence in other industries must be tackled to avoid the most damaging consequences of climate change. The paper sector is an especially overlooked polluter. As a case in point, Indonesia‚Äôs biggest industry manufacturer, Sinar Mas Group‚Äôs Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) was recently hauled over the coals for failing to honour its flagship zero-deforestation policy. According to the Rainforest Action Network, the company‚Äôs CO2 emissions stood between 67 and 87 million tonnes in 2006, a figure exceeding the carbon footprint of 165 countries in the world.

Accessed on line November 20, 2007.Grace Notes, Geoff Edgers, Boston Globe, August 9, 2002. Accessed on line November 20, 2007. On September 1, 2010, he was named Conductor Laureate of the Boston Landmarks Orchestra. Biography Charles Ansbacher was born on October 5, 1942 in Providence, Rhode Island to renowned Adlerian psychologists Heinz Ansbacher and Rowena Ripin Ansbacher. Ansbacher took up cello as a boy and began by conducting a Mahler piece with his high school orchestra in Burlington, Vermont. His parents encouraged his study by sending him to Greenwood Music Camp and Tanglewood. He majored in physics at Brown University but switched to music after creating a successful chamber orchestra with his classmates. He earned his master's degree in orchestral conducting from the University of Cincinnati in 1968, followed by his D.M.A. in 1979. Ansbacher held titled positions with orchestras in Boston, Moscow, Bishkek, and Sarajevo. Among his acclaimed performances were an all- Brahms program at Harvard University's Sanders Theater, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, and the same work in Belgrade with American and Russian soloists. In 2008, he was the first American conductor to appear with the Lebanese National Symphony Orchestra. The performance was received so well that he was invited to return to the podium in 2009. He also conducted the first-ever symphony orchestra concert in Boston's historic Fenway Park, and in Hanoi as the first American ever to lead the Vietnamese National Symphony Orchestra. His primary relationship was with the Boston Landmarks Orchestra, which he created in 2000 as a gift to his home community. He led the orchestra at Boston's historic Hatch Shell on the Charles River Esplanade, and at other locations throughout Boston during the summer. In the mid-nineties, while residing in Vienna, Ansbacher led multiple performances of renowned Austrian ensembles, including the Vienna State Opera, the Vienna Chamber Orchestra, and the Innsbruck Philharmonic. He also conducted the Sarajevo Philharmonic in performances throughout Austria, including at the famed Salzburg Grosse Festspielhaus, and Vienna's City Hall. He conducted major orchestras in Canada, Colombia, Israel, Ecuador, Italy, Lithuania, South Africa, South Korea, Vietnam, and of course the United States; however, his main thrust as an orchestra leader had been to perform in nations undergoing political transition, such as Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Ansbacher organized cross-cultural exchanges, such as bringing the Sarajevo Philharmonic to Italy and Austria; leading members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in their famed Symphony Hall featuring Croatian pianist, Ivo Pogorelich, to celebrate the opening of the Croatian consulate; conducting the world premiere of the Mandela Portrait in Johannesburg, South Africa, then bringing the piece to the United States in 2004; and conducting the Jerusalem Symphony with a Palestinian soloist, Saleem Abboud-Ashkar in December 2005. Honoring his efforts to bridge international communities, President Bill Clinton once called Ansbacher ‚Äúthe unofficial ambassador of America‚Äôs music.‚Äù Building upon multiple concerts with the Moscow Symphony Orchestra in that city's Tchaikovsky Hall, as well as the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, Ansbacher conducted the MSO on nine CD's. The Landmarks Orchestra annually incubates a new work for children, and six of these are available on MSO CD's: Make Way for Ducklings, The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere, The Journey of Phillis Wheatley, Lifting the Curse: The Story of the Red Sox, David and Old Ironsides, and John Adams: the Voice Heard 'Round the World. For adults, Ansbacher led the MSO recording Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 4 and Symphony No. 4, as well as Landmarks Overtures, Dolce, and his most recent release, the double-CD Heroic Beethoven. As a young man, Charles Ansbacher devoted almost twenty years to building the Colorado Springs Symphony, which named him Conductor Laureate when he stepped down in 1989. He was known throughout the Rocky Mountain region not only for his regular concert season, but also the music he brought to hundreds of thousands of diverse families through often-televised, innovative outdoor concerts, and the Christmas Pops on Ice that featured Olympic figure skating stars. Beyond music, Charles Ansbacher applied art to public policy-making when, as a White House Fellow, he was co-chair of the U.S. Department of Transportation's Task Force on the Use of Design, Art, and Architecture in Transportation. His interest in design and architecture led to his appointment by Mayor Federico Pena to the Blue Ribbon Committee for the design of the new Denver International Airport. He stayed in the policy realm as Chair of the Colorado Council on the Arts and Humanities, appointed by Governor Roy Romer. Soon after moving to Massachusetts, he accepted a one-year appointment as a Visiting Scholar in the Harvard Music Department (1998‚Äì1999). As he had throughout his career, Ansbacher served on the board of numerous community- focused, non-profit organizations. In 1985, he married Swanee Hunt (the US ambassador in Vienna from 1993 to 1997). He brought his teenage son and later Oscar- and Emmy-nominated filmmaker Henry into the marriage, she Lillian, born in 1982. Together, they had another son, Theodore Ansbacher-Hunt, and three grandchildren (by Henry). He died on September 12, 2010 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Honors and awards In 2009, Ansbacher was honored by the City of Cambridge, MA, and the U. S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon for his civic and artistic contributions in the United States and around the world. In February 2010, the National Theater of Sarajevo unveiled a plaque to thank him for his artistic leadership in the city, which began immediately after the siege in 1994 and continues today. In March 2010, the Mayor of Denver and the Governor of Colorado dedicated Charles Ansbacher Hall: the Art of Colorado at Denver International Airport, as a tribute to his leadership on the New World Airport Commission. In addition, Governor Bill Ritter declared March 15, 2010, to be \\"Charles Ansbacher Day\\" in the State of Colorado. On July 7, 2010, as Ansbacher led the Boston Landmarks Orchestra in Fenway Park's first full- length orchestral concert, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick presented him with a plaque that reads: Maestro Charles Ansbacher visionary founder Boston Landmarks Orchestra Free for All Concert Fund ensuring classical music for all 2010 The plaque will be mounted on a bench on the Esplanade.

Along with civil engineer John A. Roebling, he emigrated to Pittsburgh in 1831. In 1833 he published his best-known work, a prospectus titled The Paradise within the Reach of all Men. It outlined detailed, visionary plans to harness the energy of wind, water and sun to benefit mankind. He believed that contemporary technology was sufficient, if only slightly developed and astutely applied, to bring about an earthly paradise of effortless plenty within a matter of a few years. He occasionally was able to gain sufficient financial backing and supporters to make a go at turning this dream into reality. In particular, his hopes for a revolution in agriculture rested on the \\"Satellite,\\" a general-purpose cultivation tool that was to be propelled using ropes to transmit power from a stationary source that was powered in turn by wind. The device proved impractical, and his partly and poorly implemented plans to colonize the American tropics failed, with loss of life and bitter recriminations. Etzler's spirit was crushed, and he disappears from the records. Nevertheless, his vision of a world freed from labor through automated devices remains with us, and may yet find a more complete realization.

Nothing is definitely known about the origin of the upazila name. It is said that Mir Jumla II, the Subahdar of Bengal, came there by the order of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in order to invade Koch Bihar. He set up a camp near the current Mithapukur Degree College during the period of his military expedition in Bengal. His forces faced an acute problem of water for which a pond was dug near the camp. The water of the pond was so sweet that Mir Jumla named the place \\"Mithapukur\\" (Mitha means Sweet and Pukur means Pond). Some believe that Shah Ismail Ghazi ordered to dig the pond.

Before the sultans' period very few history and sign was found like, destroyed place of king at Pat around 5 km away from Pirganj upzilla headquarter and high land at Vimshahar at Baradargah Vendabari highway. Most probably these structures were formed at the period of Pal/Sen. There was another ancient temple at Bakduar called \\"Temple of Bakdebi\\". Bagdebi was desired goddess of king Bhabachandra. Bagduar was an ancient and civilized porgona under pirganj. The temple of Bhabachandra (soon to be destroyed) is situated at Udaypur under Bagduar porgona.

Which is 06 km away from pirganj. Most probably this area was developed at early 11th century. Rangpur along with Pirganj was a part of Kamrup. After Baktiar Khalgi failed to capture this part of the kamrup and died (1206 AD-1210 AD) Sultan giash uddin tried to capture kamrup on 1227 AD and failed. Tughrel Kha primarily captured this area but in the long run he failed to continue his control. At last Shah Ismail Gazi Captain of thirteenth Gour's Pathanian Sultan Rukunnuddin Abul Mujahid Barbak Shah was able to capture kamrup. Shah Ismail Gazi was a Muslims religious leader, captain and Muslim missionary. The king of Ghoraghat Bhandari Roy was envious with his success and started to conspiracy against him and be able to convince Sultan Rukunnuddin Abul Mujahid Barbak Shah to send soldier against him.

He was president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America from 1900 to 1912. As president of the Carpenters, he built a powerful personal machine among the international union's organizers. He expanded the union's jurisdictional claims, and forced the American Federation of Labor to formally recognize and enforce the union's jurisdiction. He was also a critic of racial discrimination within the union. After his election, Huber was ordered by the international union's executive board to assist founder and general secretary- treasurer Peter J. McGuire with his duties. But McGuire's failing health, alcoholism and general unpleasantness led Huber to abandon this role. Huber, along with Frank Duffy, was one of a group of union leaders who sought to force McGuire into retirement. He personally presented the charges of incompetence and corruption which led to McGuire's dismissal from the union in 1902. Huber was a key figure in the formation of the Structural Building Trades Alliance in 1902. He also led raids on the American Wood Workers Union, and forced the union to merge with the Carpenters in 1912. Huber did not get along well with the generally autonomous members of the international union's executive board. Although he was able to win passage of constitutional amendments that centralized power within the office of the international president, he was exhausted by the battles with the board. Huber retired as president of the Carpenters at the end of his term in 1912, and was succeeded by James Kirby. References *Christie, Robert. Empire in Wood: A History of the Carpenters' Union.

In interviews, band frontman Joel Plaskett has noted that Ashtray Rock is not a genre of music, but an actual location‚Äîin the forest west of Clayton Park, Nova Scotia‚Äîwhere teenagers go to get drunk. The album is a concept album about two friends growing up in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who form a band together, fall for the same girl, and have a falling-out in their friendship. Plaskett intended a nostalgic feel to the album, and used songs from his days with the band Thrush Hermit: \\"Snowed In\\" was performed live by that band, \\"The Glorious Life\\" is from 1994, and the title track Plaskett wrote in 1992 when he was age 17. The album is Plaskett's most personal. He has suggested that his former Thrush Hermit bandmates will recognize themselves in some of the narrative, and that one of the main character's musical tastes are similar to those of his wife, Nova Scotia graphic artist and cartoonist Rebecca Kraatz, who designed the album cover art. \\"Snowed In\\" and \\"Fashionable People\\" have both been released as singles in Canada. On July 10, 2007, the shortlist for the Polaris Music Prize was revealed. Ashtray Rock was announced as a finalist, alongside such other acts as Arcade Fire, The Besnard Lakes, and Feist.

(in short form, CableLabs) is a not-for- profit innovation and research and development lab founded in 1988 by American cable operators. System operators from around the world are eligible to be members. Members dues are based on revenue generated from the cable services and businesses they sell to consumers. Incorporated as a non-profit 501(c)(6), CableLabs' board of directors is composed of the chief executive officers of member companies, thus affording business and strategic insight into the technology development process. CableLabs works with its members to determine what service requirements are to be supported by new technologies and new services. CableLabs then seeks to support those requirements through open interface specifications, written in tandem with members and suppliers. The specifications, in turn, take much of the guess work out of vendors' engineering decisions as to where cable operators are moving with many of their new businesses. This collaborative process is designed to get products to market more quickly and at lower price points due to global economies of scale. Innovation is driven by a multiplicity of working relationships between suppliers/vendors and CableLabs staff: Visiting engineers and contributing engineers from these vendor organizations create a pool of thousands of individuals providing innovative input to the work performed at CableLabs. Development undertaken at CableLabs and endorsed by the cable industry has led to relationships among companies never before known within the cable market. CableLabs' flagship example of adding value to the cable industry is through guiding the collaborative specification authorship of the DOCSIS suite of specifications. CableLabs' facilitation of intellectual property (IP) rights discussions minimizes exposure to intellectual property risk for companies entering the marketplace. CableLabs has approximately 180 employees with an additional on-site population of visiting engineers and consultants.

It is known as the gateway to North Bengal, since the Dhaka- Rangpur and Dhaka-Rajshahi highways intersect at Hatikumrul in Ullapara. History Around 4500 BC, the region of Varendra consisted of parts of Dinajpur, Joypurhat, Bogra, Rajshahi and western Pabna. Pabna and Mymensingh were formed by the deposition of alluvial river soil. At that time, there was no Jamuna River, and Sirajganj and Tangail were part of Mymensingh. According to the Chinese traveler Xuanzang, Sirajgonj was inhabited for seven centuries before the Jamuna began to separate the region from the rest of Mymensingh. At that time, the new region was underwater for eight or nine months of the year. According to Xuanzang, the west bank of the Karatoya River was in the kingdom of Pundravardhana; Ullapara was probably also in the kingdom at the time. The area was settled during the eras of Muslim administration (1204-1757) and the British Raj (1757-1947) before a business center was established. In 1875 a thana (police station) was built, and on July 2, 1983 Ullapara became an upazila. Geography Ullapara, with 69,479 households and an area of , was built on alluvial soil deposited by the Padma, Jamuna and other rivers. The upazilas of Raiganj and Tarash are to the north, Tarash and Bhangura to the west, Faridpur and Shahjadpur to the south and Belkuchi and Kamarkhanda to the east. Ullapara is an estimated above sea level, and is drained by the Karatoya, Fulzor, Jopjopia and Kamla Dargadoh Rivers. The average annual high temperature is , and the average low is . Annual average rainfall is . Demographics In the 1991 Bangladesh census, Ullapara had a population of 5,40,156. Males were 51.13 percent of the population, and females 48.87 percent. The population aged 18 and older was 192,188. Ullapara had an average literacy rate of 39.61 percent (ages seven and older); males had a 44.81-percent literacy rate and females a 34.09-percent rate, compared to the national average of 82.4 percent. Transport Rivers were formerly the only effective routes of communication. The Dhaka-Rangpur highway and the Dhaka- Rajshahi railway connect the upazila (at the village of Newargacha) with other parts of Bangladesh. A road network exists, and the Bangabandhu Bridge over the Jamuna has reduced the overland travel time to Dhaka to about three hours. Education Ullapara's oldest secondary school, Salop High School (estabd. in 1905),the second oldest Ullapara Merchant's Pilot High English School, was founded in 1906 by the jute merchants of the small river port. Other schools are Kaliakoir Adarsha High School, Ullapara Science College, Government Akbar Ali College Barahar School & College, Barahar Hazi Abbus Ali Alim Madrasha, Barahar Primary School and K.A.M High School.

By Library of Congress. Copyright Office, p2294 Plot summary The novel is set in October 1967. Sun Yat, an elderly Chinese bookseller in San Francisco's Chinatown is murdered by Mafia hitmen who stage the murder to make it look like a Tong assassination. The murdered man is a double agent employed by AXE and Chinese communist agents. Carter is summoned to a meeting of the Joint Intelligence Chiefs at CIA headquarters. Carter learns that Fan Su ‚Äì an anti-communist agent he helped on an earlier mission (described in Dragon Flame) has requested his help in supporting an anti- communist underground movement within China. Fan Su is currently in San Francisco. Carter also learns that Chinese forces are constructing a 500-mile long tunnel beneath the Chumbi Valley from Tibet into India to invade India and to conceal construction of the world's largest hydrogen bomb. Carter's mission is to enter China and destroy the bomb and tunnel before they can be used. Carter heads to San Francisco to meet Fan Su. He visits a pharmacist in Chinatown where Sun Yat delivered his secret materials for forwarding to AXE. Carter is met by a Chinese acupuncturist who gives the correct response to his coded introduction. The Chinese man attacks Carter with curare-tipped acupuncture needles but is overpowered and killed. Carter finds the real contact dead in a closet and Fan Su tied up next to him. Carter and Fan Su kill another two agents as they escape from the pharmacy. They head to a safe house in Los Angeles and plan their strategy. Carter will travel to Pusan where he will take a submarine to Shanghai. There he will meet up with Fan Su who will enter China via Hong Kong. Together they will head across China to Tibet with assistance from an elderly warlord known to Fan Su. If the mission to destroy the bomb in the Chumbi valley is a success the CIA will support Fan Su's anti-communist Undertong movement. After spending several days in Shanghai, Carter learns that Po-Choy, Fan Su's half-brother and a fellow ringleader of the underground movement who had infiltrated the Red Guard, has been captured and tortured by the Red Guard. To prevent him revealing any information that might compromise the mission Carter and Fan Su kill Po-Choy as he is paraded at a Red Guard rally. Carter and Fan Su escape from Shanghai with the assistance of a CIA-operated Civil Air Transport plane which takes them deep into China yet still 500 miles from the Chumbi valley. In the Chinese hinterland, Fan Su's family friend, a local warlord named General Teng Fa, provides shelter and armed guides while they wait for a CIA plane from Sikkim to take them to the Chumbi valley. General Teng tells Carter of an unguarded valley running parallel to Chumbi valley with ancient carved steps that will provide a shortcut into the Chumbi valley. Teng warns Carter that the place is called the Valley of the Yeti. Carter and Fan Su arrive at the valley by parachute. Carter leaves Fan Su alone guarding their camp and infiltrates the secret tunnel excavation where he plants a small atomic grenade near the unfinished H-bomb assembly. The bomb is timed to explode 30 minutes after Carter and Fan Su are picked up by helicopter at their pre- arranged landing site. Carter hears shots as he scales the cliff to return to Fan Su. Carter finds only blood stains, a bent rifle and giant footprints. Carter follows the bloodstains and footprints and discovers Fan Su's mangled body. She has been killed by some large animal ‚Äì possibly a Yeti. Carter follows the wounded animal into a series of interconnected caves but loses it. Carter is picked up by the CIA helicopter and returns to base in Sikkim as the tunnel and bomb are destroyed.

Its journalists are widely considered to be ideologically driven, and some of its content has been called misogynistic, xenophobic, and racist by liberals and many traditional conservatives alike. The site has published a number of conspiracy theories  * and intentionally misleading stories. Breitbart News aligned with the alt-right under the management of former executive chairman Steve Bannon,See, e.g.:  who declared the website \\"the platform for the alt-right\\" in 2016. In 2016, Breitbart News became a virtual rallying spot for supporters of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The company's management, together with former staff member Milo Yiannopoulos, solicited ideas for stories from, and worked to advance and market ideas of, neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups and individuals. After the election, more than 2,000 organizations removed Breitbart News from ad buys following Internet activism campaigns denouncing the site's controversial positions.

The website featured direct links to wire stories at the Associated Press, Reuters, Fox News, the New York Post, TMZ as well as a number of other outlets. The website's initial growth was largely fueled by links from the Drudge Report. In 2007, Breitbart.com launched a video blog, Breitbart.tv. According to co-founder Larry Solov, the two men were in agreement that the site should be \\"unapologetically pro-freedom and pro-Israel\\" during their visit to Israel in 2007. In August 2010, Andrew Breitbart told the Associated Press that he was \\"committed to the destruction of the old media guard.\\" As part of that commitment, he founded Breitbart.com, a website designed to become \\"the Huffington Post of the right\\" according to Breitbart News's former executive chairman, Steve Bannon. Breitbart News exclusively re-posted the Anthony Weiner sexting scandal, the resignation of Shirley Sherrod, and the ACORN 2009 undercover videos controversy. Following Andrew Breitbart's death in 2012, the site was redesigned, bringing the formerly distinct \\"Big\\" websites under one umbrella website at Breitbart.com.

The website hosted a number of memorials for him. Editors said they intended to carry on his legacy at the website. Following Andrew Breitbart's death, former board member Steve Bannon became executive chairman and Laurence Solov became CEO. The company also hired Joel Pollak as editor-in-chief and Alex Marlow as managing editor. An October 2012 article in BuzzFeed News suggested there were internal tensions in the organisation in the year after Andrew Breitbart's death as staffers battled for ownership of his legacy. Before his death, Andrew Breitbart had begun a redesign of the Breitbart News website to transform it from a links- aggregator into a more tabloid-style website. The redesign was launched shortly after his death in March 2012. In February 2014, Bannon announced the addition of approximately 12 staff members and the opening of Texas and London-based operations. The new offices were the beginning of an expansion plan that included the addition of a new regional site roughly every 90 days, with new locations to include Florida, California, Cairo, and Jerusalem. According to a 2014 Pew Research Center study, 3% of respondents got their news from Breitbart in a typical week, and 79% of its audience reported having political values that are right-of-center. Under Bannon's management, Breitbart News aligned with the American alt-right, the European populist right, and the white nationalist identitarian movement. Bannon declared the website \\"the platform for the alt-right\\" in 2016, but denied all allegations of racism and later stated that he rejected what he called the \\"ethno- nationalist\\" tendencies of the alt-right movement. One of Bannon's coworkers said he wasn't referring to Richard Spencer but instead to \\"the trolls on Reddit or 4Chan.\\" The owners of Breitbart News deny their website has any connection to the alt-right or has ever supported racist or white supremacist views. Support for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign Alex Marlow, editor-in-chief of Breitbart News Breitbart News strongly supported Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election. In July 2015, Politico reported that Ted Cruz \\"likely has the Republican presidential field's deepest relationship with the Breitbart machine.\\" In August 2015, an article in BuzzFeed reported that several anonymous Breitbart News staffers claimed that Donald Trump had paid for favorable coverage on the site. The site's management strongly denied the charge. In March 2016, Lloyd Grove of The Daily Beast characterized the website as \\"Trump-friendly\\", writing that Breitbart News \\"regularly savages the GOP establishment, the media elite, the Washington consultant class, and the Fox News Channel.\\" On March 11, 2016, Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields filed a battery complaint against Donald Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, alleging that Lewandowski had grabbed her and bruised her while she was attempting to ask a question at an event. After claiming that Breitbart News's management was not sufficiently supportive of Fields, Breitbart's editor-at-large Ben Shapiro and Fields resigned. A Breitbart News article published on March 14, 2016 accused Shapiro of betraying Breitbart News's readers; the article was subsequently removed from the website. Editor-at-large Joel Pollak apologized for writing the article, saying he had done so in an attempt \\"to make light of a significant company event.\\" The website's spokesperson Kurt Bardella also resigned following the incident, objecting to the company's handling of the incident and its favorable coverage of Trump. By March 14, several top executives and journalists at Breitbart News had resigned, with The New York Times saying that \\"Breitbart's unabashed embrace of Mr. Trump, particularly at the seeming expense of its own reporter, struck them as a betrayal of its mission.\\" Former employees accused Bannon of having \\"turned a website founded on anti- authoritarian grounds into a de facto propaganda outlet for Mr. Trump.\\" CPAC On August 17, Bannon stepped down from his role as executive chairman to join the Trump campaign as its new CEO. On August 25, Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton criticized him for hiring Bannon as his CEO in her rally in Reno, Nevada. She stated that the site \\"embraces ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right\\" by reading out the site's headlines and that Trump's decision to hire Bannon \\"represents a landmark achievement for the alt-right\\". In January 2017, editor Julia Hahn resigned from Breitbart News to work as special assistant to president Donald Trump. =2016‚Äìpresent: after the 2016 election= On November 30, 2016, Breitbart News announced plans to boycott the Kellogg's brand after its decision to stop advertising on the site because Breitbart is not \\"aligned with our values\\". Later, Breitbart News announced they would be willing to go to \\"war\\" with Kellogg's over its decision to remove ads from the site. Milo Yiannopoulos, who had served as a senior editor of Breitbart News since 2014, resigned from the company on February 21, 2017 after a video of him making controversial statements in relation to hebephilia surfaced. Allies of Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner complained to Trump in April 2017 after Breitbart published several unflattering articles about Kushner. Shortly afterwards, the site's senior editors asked staffers to stop writing stories critical of Kushner. Bannon was appointed White House Chief Strategist in the administration of US President Donald Trump and served in that role for seven months; he was dismissed from the White House on August 17, 2017. That same day, he was again appointed executive chairman of Breitbart News. In January 2018, Breitbart News announced that Bannon stepped down from his position as executive chairman. In September 2018, Wikipedia banned factual citations to Breitbart News due to its unreliability; Breitbart News can still be cited on Wikipedia as an opinion or commentary source. Decline in advertisers and readership From the United States presidential election in November 2016 to June 2017, Breitbart's readership fell faster than other news sites. In the two months from April to June 2017, the site lost about 90% of its advertisers, The decline coincided with boycotts aimed at getting advertisers to stop running ads on the site. The boycotts were mainly organized by the anonymous online group Sleeping Giants, which said on June 5 that 2,200 organizations had committed to stop advertising on Breitbart News (and similar sites) due to its controversial positions. Soon thereafter, Breitbart News trimmed prominently displayed, overtly racist content and fired contributor Katie McHugh for posting Islamophobic tweets about the London Bridge terror attack. By 2019 Breitbart had lost nearly 75% of its readership, going from 17.3 million at the beginning of 2017 to 4.6 million in May 2019. Content and coverage = Accuracy and ideology = Breitbart News is a far-right American news, opinion, and commentary website. Some sources describe it as a conservative news outlet or as part of the alt-right. Its consistently conservative editorial positions overlap with the ideological positions of far-right European political parties. It supported Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, and political scientist Matthew Goodwin described Breitbart News as being \\"ultra-conservative\\" in orientation. In August 2017, Joel Pollak, the senior editor-at-large for Breitbart News, described the \\"mission\\" of Breitbart News in this way: Breitbart News has published a number of falsehoods and conspiracy theories, as well as intentionally misleading stories, including claims that Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration supported ISIS. It has sometimes published these misleading stories as part of an intentional strategy to manipulate media narratives via disinformation. In July 2010, Shirley Sherrod was fired from her appointed position as Georgia State Director of Rural Development for the United States Department of Agriculture. Her firing was largely in response to coverage in Breitbart News of video excerpts from her address to an event of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in March 2010. Both NAACP and White House officials apologized for their statements after a longer version of her address was reviewed. In April 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center wrote that the \\"outlet has undergone a noticeable shift toward embracing ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right\\" and was using \\"racist\\", \\"anti- Muslim\\" and \\"anti-immigrant ideas\\". The center wrote that the website was openly promoting, and had become associated with, the beliefs of the alt- right. Former editor-at-large Ben Shapiro wrote that under Bannon's leadership, \\"Breitbart has become the alt-right go-to website ... pushing white ethno-nationalism as a legitimate response to political correctness, and the comment section turning into a cesspool for white supremacist mememakers\\", describing the website as \\"Trump Pravda\\". Breitbart News has published material that has been called misogynist, xenophobic, and racist. However, the owners of Breitbart News deny their website has any connection to the alt- right. The Anti-Defamation League described Breitbart News as \\"the premier website of the alt-right\\" representing \\"white nationalists and unabashed anti- Semites and racists.\\" The Zionist Organization of America rejected accusations of anti-semitism, saying that Breitbart News instead \\"bravely fights against anti-Semitism\\" and called for the ADL to apologize. An article in The Jewish Daily Forward argued that Bannon and Andrew Breitbart are anti-Semitic. An article by Rabbi Shmuley Boteach in The Hill disputed the allegations, arguing that Breitbart defends Israel against antisemitism.'America's rabbi' rises to defend Steve Bannon Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, Contributor, The Hill, 11/15/16 Alexander Marlow denies that Breitbart is a \\"hate-site\\", stating \\"that we're consistently called anti-Semitic despite the fact that we are overwhelmingly staffed with Jews and are pro-Israel and pro-Jewish. That is fake news.\\"Inside Breitbart News: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre Not a Hate Site‚Äô March 17, 2017, 11:04 AM ET, by HANNAH RAPPLEYE, STEPHANIE GOSK and ANNEKE FOSTER, NBC News Breitbart News has had staff members associated with white supremacists. An expos√© by BuzzFeed published in October 2017 documented how Breitbart solicited story ideas and copy edits from white supremacists and neo-Nazis via the intermediation of Milo Yiannopoulos. Yiannopoulos, together with other Breitbart News employees, developed and marketed the values and tactics of these groups and attempted to make them palatable to a broader audience. According to BuzzFeed, \\"These new emails and documents ... clearly show that Breitbart does more than tolerate the most hate-filled, racist voices of the alt-right. It thrives on them, fueling and being fueled by some of the most toxic beliefs on the political spectrum‚Äîand clearing the way for them to enter the American mainstream.\\" In November 2017, British anti-fascism charity Hope Not Hate identified one of the website's writers as an administrator of a far-right Facebook group that serves as a platform for fascists and white supremacists. In 2017 the Mueller investigation examined the role of Breitbart News in Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and its role in both amplifying stories from Russian media and being amplified by Russian bots in social media. In 2017, a Breitbart News reporter left the company to join Sputnik. Breitbart News is a for-profit organization. According to Politico, investors include computer scientist and hedge fund CEO Robert Mercer. Editors commented in 2015 that the site is a \\"private company and we don't comment on who our investors or backers are.\\" One of Breitbart News's objectives is to court millennial conservatives. Traffic is vital to Breitbart News as it supports itself from advertising revenue. =Main sections= Big Hollywood In 2008, Andrew Breitbart launched the website \\"Big Hollywood\\", a group blog by individuals working in Hollywood. The site was an outgrowth of Breitbart's \\"Big Hollywood\\" column in The Washington Times, which included issues faced by conservatives working in Hollywood. In 2009, the site used audio from a conference call to accuse the National Endowment of the Arts of encouraging artists to create work in support of President Barack Obama's domestic policy. The Obama Administration and the NEA were accused of potentially violating the Hatch Act. The White House acknowledged regrets, and the story led to the resignation of a White House appointee, and new federal guidelines for how federal agencies should interact with potential grantees. Big Government Andrew Breitbart launched BigGovernment.com on September 10, 2009, with a $25,000 loan from his father. He hired Mike Flynn, a former government affairs specialist at the Reason Foundation, as Editor-in-Chief of Big Government.\\"Introducing Andrew Breitbart's Big Government, Edited by Mike Flynn\\", Nick Gillespie, reason.com, September 10, 2009 The site premiered with hidden camera video footage taken by Hannah Giles and James O'Keefe at Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) offices in various cities, attracting nationwide attention resulting in the ACORN 2009 undercover videos controversy. According to law enforcement and media analysts, the videos were heavily edited to create a negative impression of ACORN. Big Journalism In January 2010, Andrew Breitbart launched Big Journalism. Upon the launch of Big Journalism, he told Mediaite: \\"Our goal at Big Journalism is to hold the mainstream media's feet to the fire. There are a lot of stories that they simply don't cover, either because it doesn't fit their world view, or because they're literally innocent of any knowledge that the story even exists, or because they are a dying organization, short- staffed, and thus can't cover stuff like they did before.\\" Big Journalism was edited by Michael A. Walsh, a former journalism professor and Time magazine music critic. National Security BigPeace.com, which later became the National Security component of Breitbart News, debuted on July 4, 2010. National Security covers foreign policy, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, terrorism, Islamic extremism, espionage, border security, and energy issues. Breitbart Tech On October 27, 2015, the website launched Breitbart Tech, a technology journalism subsection of the site that focuses on technology, gaming, esports, and internet culture. It was initially edited by Milo Yiannopoulos until his resignation on February 21, 2017, following the controversy surrounding questionable comments he made regarding hebephilia and the sexuality of children during two podcasts. In July 2016 Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter after racist abuse was directed towards Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones following Yiannopoulos's insulting tweets about her. Although Yiannopoulos's Twitter account was removed, Breitbart News has since republished the full tweet exchange and has published articles criticizing Twitter. Radio Breitbart News Radio began daily production on SiriusXM Patriot in 2015. =Regional sections= Breitbart London Breitbart News's London edition was launched in February 2014. It was headed at the time by executive editor James Delingpole, described as a \\"high traffic hire\\" by The Spectator's Steerpike column. He co-founded it with Raheem Kassam. Breitbart Jerusalem Logo for Breitbart Jerusalem On November 17, 2015, the website launched Breitbart Jerusalem, which covers events in Israel and the wider Middle East. It is edited by Israel-based American reporter Aaron Klein. Rabbi Shmuley Boteach has been an occasional columnist. Breitbart Texas Breitbart News's Texas edition was launched in February 2014 and its editor and managing director at launch was Brandon Darby. Michael Quinn Sullivan was a founding contributor. Notable events =ACORN undercover videos= Breitbart News played a central role in the 2009 ACORN video controversy, which resulted in the reorganization of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, as well as its loss of private and government funding. Breitbart News contributor Hannah Giles posed as a prostitute fleeing an abusive pimp and seeking tax and legal advice on how to run an illegal business that included the use of underage girls in the sex trade, while James O'Keefe, another contributor, posed as her boyfriend. They clandestinely videotaped meetings with ACORN staff who \\"gave advice on house- buying and how to account on tax forms for the woman's income.\\" Andrew Breitbart paid Giles and O'Keefe $32,000 and $65,000, respectively, to film, edit and blog about the videos. Giles paid $100,000 and O'Keefe paid $50,000 to settle a lawsuit brought by former ACORN employee Juan Carlos Vera regarding the videos. Subsequent investigations by the Brooklyn District Attorney's office and the California Attorney General found the videos were heavily edited in an attempt to make ACORN's responses \\"appear more sinister\\",An Independent Governance Assessment of ACORN , Proskauer Rose (December 7, 2009). and contributed to the group's demise. Clark Hoyt, The New York Times public editor, wrote, \\"The videos were heavily edited. The sequence of some conversations was changed. Some workers seemed concerned for Giles, one advising her to get legal help. In two cities, ACORN workers called the police. But the most damning words match the transcripts and the audio, and do not seem out of context.\\" However, a former Massachusetts Attorney General hired to investigate the matter found no pattern of illegal conduct by the ACORN employees and said the news media should have been far more skeptical, demanding the raw video from which the edited versions were produced.The Acorn Sting Revisited by Clark Hoyt, The New York Times, March 20, 2010. =Shirley Sherrod's remarks at NAACP fundraiser= In July 2010, Breitbart News released an edited video titled \\"Proof NAACP Awards Racism\\" which featured USDA official Shirley Sherrod speaking at a National Association for the Advancement of Colored People fundraising dinner in March 2010. In the video, Sherrod admits to a racial reluctance to help a white farmer obtain government aid. As a result of the video, the NAACP condemned Sherrod's remarks, and U.S. government officials called on Sherrod to resign, which she did. The NAACP later posted the longer 43-minute video of the speech. In it, Sherrod said her reluctance to help a white man was wrong, and she had ended up assisting him. The NAACP then reversed their rebuke of Sherrod, and Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack apologized and offered Sherrod a new government position. Andrew Breitbart said that the point of the piece was not to target Sherrod, but said the NAACP audience's reception of some parts of the speech demonstrated the same racism the NAACP's President had accused the Tea Party movement of harboring. In 2011, Sherrod sued Andrew Breitbart and his business partner Larry O'Connor for defamation. In 2015, Sherrod and Andrew Breitbart's estate settled the case.Zoe Tillman, \\"Former USDA Official Settles Defamation Suit Against Breitbart Estate\\", National Law Journal (October 1, 2015). =Anthony Weiner sexting scandal= On May 28, 2011, Breitbart News's BigJournalism website reported on a sexually explicit photo linked on New York Representative Anthony Weiner's Twitter feed. Weiner initially denied that he had sent a 21-year-old female college student the link to the photograph, but later admitted to inappropriate online relationships. On June 6, Breitbart News reported other photos Weiner had sent, including one that was sexually explicit. Two days later, the sexually graphic photo was leaked after Andrew Breitbart participated in a radio interview with hosts Opie and Anthony. Andrew Breitbart stated that the photo was published without his permission. Weiner subsequently resigned from his congressional seat on June 21. =\\"Friends of Hamas\\" story= On February 7, 2013, Ben Shapiro published an article on Breitbart News reporting allegations that former Senator and nominee for United States Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel (R-Nebraska) may have been paid to speak at an event sponsored by a group called \\"Friends of Hamas.\\" Breitbart News said that the story was based on exclusive information from U.S. Senate sources. An investigation by Slate reporter David Weigel failed to confirm the existence of the purported group. On February 19, New York Daily News reporter Dan Friedman said that the story had originated from a sarcastic comment he had made to a congressional staffer. \\"Friends of Hamas\\" was one of several groups which Friedman considered to be so over-the-top as to be implausible and obviously fictitious. He was investigating rumors that Hagel had been paid for speaking to \\"controversial organizations\\", and asked sarcastically whether he had addressed \\"Friends of Hamas.\\" Friedman followed with an email to the congressional staffer asking if Hagel had received a $25,000 fee from \\"Friends of Hamas\\" for his speaking engagement. No reply to the email was received, and the next day, Breitbart News ran a story with the headline \\"Secret Hagel Donor?: White House Spox Ducks Question on 'Friends of Hamas'.\\" Breitbart News maintained that the report was accurate, posting articles defending the website and criticizing Weigel and Friedman. Writers for The Washington Post, New York magazine and The Daily Beast criticized Breitbart News for the \\"Friends of Hamas\\" story, calling it \\"wrong\\" and \\"made- up\\". =Nancy Pelosi/Miley Cyrus ad campaign= In April 2014, Breitbart News created an advertising campaign to launch Breitbart California, which included posters bearing an image of House minority leader Nancy Pelosi's head superimposed onto singer Miley Cyrus's body as seen twerking on California governor Jerry Brown, spoofing the 2013 VMAs. DNC Chairwoman and Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz denounced the images as disrespectful to women. In response, House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy requested that his column be removed from the site. =Misidentification of Loretta Lynch= On November 8, 2014, Breitbart News posted an article by Warner Todd Huston, which erroneously reported that Loretta Lynch, President Barack Obama's nominee for attorney general, had been part of Bill Clinton's defense team during the Whitewater scandal about the Whitewater Development Corporation. In fact, the Whitewater lawyer was a different Loretta Lynch. After this mistake was pointed out by Talking Points Memo and Media Matters for America, Breitbart News noted that the two Lynches were different people by correcting and appending the original article. Andrew Rosenthal of The New York Times editorial page editor criticized this, writing: \\"The appended correction didn't really do justice to the scope of the misidentification.\\"\\"No Comment Necessary: The Wrong Loretta Lynch\\". Rosenthal, Andrew. The New York Times, November 10, 2014 The American Journalism Review said \\"that Breitbart had let the mistaken fact stand in the headline and the article itself,\\" and had published a second story containing the incorrect information on November 9. By November 10, the initial story had been deleted from Breitbart.com.Breitbart News attacked the wrong Loretta Lynch. McDonald, Soraya Nadia. The Washington Post, November 10, 2014 PolitiFact rated the claim \\"Pants on Fire\\" and noted that the false claim had \\"already spread to other conspiracy, opinion and conservative news websites\\", as an example of how fast false information can spread on the Internet.\\"Breitbart gets the wrong Loretta Lynch in Whitewater claim\\". Sharockman, Aaron. PolitiFact, November 10, 2014 =Conspiracy theories about President Obama= According to The New York Times, Breitbart News promoted the falsehood that President Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim (\\"birtherism\\"). In Devil's Bargain, however, Joshua Green writes that Breitbart never promoted birtherism. Breitbart senior editor-at-large Joel B. Pollak has denied that Breitbart News was a \\"Birther website\\" or that it had ever made a birther-conspiracy claim.Joel B. Pollack, Fake News: New York Times Falsely Claims Breitbart 'Birther' Site, Breitbart (November 21, 2016). In June 2016, Breitbart News falsely claimed President Obama supported terrorists. In March 2017, Breitbart News published a story by conservative talk radio host Mark Levin claiming that Obama had wiretapped Donald Trump during Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. President Trump repeated the claims on his Twitter feed less than 24 hours after Breitbart News ran the story. =Conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton= During the 2016 presidential election, Breitbart News were accused by Rolling Stone magazine of promoting conspiracy theories including the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which alleged that high-ranking Democrats were involved a child sex ring. The website made unconfirmed claims about Hillary Clinton's health, including asserting she had issues caused by a supposed brain injury. A June 2016 Breitbart News article presented Stone's conspiracy theory that Clinton aide Huma Abedin was involved with terrorism. =False report of Muslim mob in Germany= On January 3, 2017, Breitbart News's Virginia Hale wrote that \\"[a]t a New Year's Eve celebrations in Dortmund a mob of more than 1,000 men chanted 'Allahu Akhbar', launched fireworks at police, and set fire to a historic church\\" giving the impression of \\"chaotic civil war-like conditions in Germany, caused by Islamist aggressors\\" according to The Guardian. The story was later shown to be false; St. Reinold's Church is neither the oldest church in Germany nor was the church set on fire. While 1000 people did gather, which is not unusual on New Year's Eve in a public place, video footage from the scene does not show a \\"mob\\", and no policemen were targeted. The official police report recorded an \\"average to quiet New Year's Eve\\" with \\"no spectacular facts to report\\", while firefighters note an \\"almost normal weekend night\\" and state that a \\"safety net at the Reinoldi church caught fire by a fireworks rocket, but was quickly extinguished\\". Witness said it was not the church roof that was scorched, but a construction scaffolding on the church's far side, away from the crowd. The group that shouted \\"Allahu Akbar\\" consisted of only 50‚Äì70 people and was celebrating the ceasefire in Aleppo. The false story was then subsequently picked up by an Austrian far-right website before it made its way back to Germany where politician Thorsten Hoffmann fell for it. In Germany, several newspapers reported on Breitbart News publishing the hoax and distorting facts for the purpose of spreading Islamophobic propaganda. Breitbart News initially declined to comment, but on January 8 published a story in which it stood by its claims, which had been shown to be false, and refused to admit to any exaggeration. The only correction issued was with regard to the church's age. The follow-up story used a screen capture of different fireworks at the near side of the church, with no scaffolding. Ruhr Nachrichten, the original outlet and the alleged witness cited by Breitbart News, replied to the update, and stated that Breitbart News had not contacted them or the firefighters present to verify their story. They also reiterated the accusation against Breitbart News of exaggerating minor facts to give a false \\"impression that a 'mob' of 1000 migrants had shot at Christian churches in Dortmund and set them on fire.\\" The newspaper went on to accuse Breitbart News of not adhering to journalistic ethics. Ruhr Nachrichten also accused Breitbart of \\"using our online reports for fake news, hate and propaganda\\" and published video fragments recorded on site that contradicted Breitbart News's story. =Climate change denial= In November 2016, Breitbart News published an article summarizing a Daily Mail piece that falsely claimed that record-high global temperatures were unrelated to global warming. The Breitbart article, by James Delingpole, was cited by the United States House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, for which the latter itself was criticized.It‚Äôs likely Earth‚Äôs hottest year on record ‚Äî and some people are talking about global cooling, The Washington PostHouse Science Committee Tweets Climate-Change Denying Breitbart Article, NBC NewsSanders burns House committee for sharing Breitbart article denying climate change, USA Today Weather.com condemned the Breitbart story in an article titled \\"Note to Breitbart: Earth Is Not Cooling, Climate Change Is Real and Please Stop Using Our Video to Mislead Americans\\". In June 2017, Breitbart News published an article by Dellingpole that claimed that 58 scientific papers disproved anthropogenic climate change. A number of scientists criticized the article, describing it as cherry-picking, derogatory, inaccurate, misleading, and employing flawed reasoning. In April 2019, Breibart News published an article that claimed that a scientific study on past climate proved that man-made climate change was a hoax. Climate scientists sharply criticized the article, variously describing it as ignorant, misleading, and misrepresentative of the study‚Äôs actual findings. In 2020, Breitbart News falsely claimed that the sea level has remained stable throughout the 20th century. =Wrongly picturing Lukas Podolski as a refugee= In August 2017, Breitbart News featured a picture of professional German soccer player Lukas Podolski in an article entitled \\"Spanish Police Crack Gang Moving Migrants on Jet-Skis\\". Podolski is neither a migrant gang member nor a victim of human trafficking. The picture was of Podolski riding a jet-ski in the summer of 2014 in Brazil. Breitbart News apologized to Podolski after the picture drew attention. =False story about Northern California wildfires= In October 2017, Breitbart News published a false story claiming that an illegal immigrant was arrested in connection with the October 2017 Northern California wildfires. Sonoma County's sheriff department responded to Breitbart's reporting, \\"This is completely false, bad, wrong information that Breitbart started and is being put out into the public.\\" = COVID-19 Scandal = Breitbart News livestreamed a widely viewed video on July 27, 2020, featuring a group called America's Frontline Doctors, that made dubious claims related to the COVID-19 pandemic and touted hydroxychloroquine as a cure. The group was led by Dr. Simone Gold, reportedly a Trump supporter who has advocated the use of hydroxychloroquine on conservative talk radio and podcasts. President Donald Trump shared several versions of the video with his 84 million Twitter followers before they were taken down. The video was removed by Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for violating policies against COVID-19 misinformation. The president's son Donald Trump Jr. was restricted from Twitter for 12 hours for sharing it. The video event was funded by the right-wing group Tea Party Patriots. The video had 14 million views and was shared 600,000 times on Facebook before it was taken down. Breitbart did not immediately respond to CNBC when asked about the video being removed by Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. = Voter fraud = In August 2020, a Breitbart article reported on a press release by Michigan's Secretary of State about more than 800 dead people voting in Michigan. The Breitbart article was framed to suggest that the ballots were not legitimately cast and thus evidence of extensive voter fraud. However, the voters in question died after submitting the ballots, and the ballots were rejected by Michigan authorities who knew the voters had died before the election date.

It replaced the Land Court of New South Wales on 10 December 1921 and itself replaced by the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales on 1 September 1980. Background to the establish of the court The Crown Land Acts 1884 (NSW) created a new structure, introducing various new tenures of holding real property not previously in existence in Australia. These new tenures included grazing licences, homestead leases, conditional leases, and pastoral leases. There were also annual leases for pastoral purposes, and leases of scrub land. Lessees acquired the right to convert portions of land held under pastoral or homestead leases into scrub leases. There were leases for wharfs and jetties and leases for special purposes, such as dams, irrigation works, sawmills, and quarries and permits for wharfs and jetties. To administer this new system, land in New South Wales was divided into three divisions, namely eastern, central and western divisions. Each division had a Local land board, which effectively decentralised the administration of Crown land in the State Parties to any proceedings before a local land board were given a right to appeal from any adjudication or decision of the board to the Minister for Lands, who was directed to hear and determine the appeals as in open court. The Crown Lands Act 1889 (NSW) introduced a Land Court of New South Wales which replaced the ministerial court. The new court comprised three members who were appointed by the Governor of New South Wales. The governor could appoint of the members as the President. The Land Court heard all appeals and all matters referred to it by the Minister or by a local land board, making orders or awards which were conclusive on the parties and had the force of a common law judgment of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Questions of law arising in cases in the Land Court could be referred to the Supreme Court in the form of a stated case, on the request of any party or of the Court‚Äôs own motion. The Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913 (NSW) abolished the Land Court and constituted a Land Appeal Court of New South Wales consisting of three members, one of whom was the President. The jurisdiction of the Land Appeal Court was similar to that of its predecessor, the Land Court, and again provision was made for the stating and submitting of a case for the decision of the Supreme Court on any question of law. The Law Reform Commission of New South Wales states in its twenty third report that the death of the President and the advancing ages of the two members of the Land Appeal Court furnished a suitable opportunity in 1921 for the New South Wales Government to recast the constitution of that court. This was effected by the Land and Valuation Court Act 1921 (NSW). The Land Appeal Court was abolished and a new court was constituted as the Land and Valuation Court. Composition of the court The court was constituted by a judge having the same rank, title, status, and precedence and the same salary and rights as the judges of the Supreme Court. The first judge of the Court was the Honourable Mr Justice Pike, who held office from 21 December 1921 to 24 May 1937. The Honourable Mr Justice Else- Mitchell was a judge of the court who retired on 1 October 1974. Laurence Street, who subsequently became Chief Justice of New South Wales, was also appointed a judge of the Court on 28 October 1974. Jurisdiction of the court Jurisdiction was conferred on the Court to hear and determine matters which had previously been heard in the former Land Appeal Court of New South Wales. Subsequently, the Court was given jurisdiction to hear objections to and appeals against valuations of land, the levying of rates or charges and the assessment of rateable property under various Acts, and claims made for compensation by reason of the acquisition of land under the Public Works Act 1912 (NSW) where such claim exceeded ¬£100. The right of appeal by way of case stated for the decision of the Supreme Court was retained. From 1927, the court could hear appeals in relation to the value of land resumed under the Closer Settlement Acts. From 1945, the court heard appeals from local councils decisions concerning applications to erect buildings, to open new public roads and to subdivide land, instead of the District Court of New South Wales. They could also hear claims for compensation exceeding ¬£100 made in respect prescribed planning schemes From 1958, Boards of Appeal were established to hear appeals from councils on building and subdivision applications. Parties then had a right of appeal in certain circumstances to the Court by special case on a question of law. In 1962, valuation boards of review were constituted to hear objections against valuations of land made under the Valuation of Land Act, 1916 instead of the court. However, there still remained a right of appeal to the court and a board could refer a question to the court for determination. In 1972, the Local Government Appeals Tribunal of New South Wales was established to hear planning and development appeals instead of the Court. Business of the court The first proceedings of the Court were held on 14 February 1922. According to the New South Wales Law Commission, in 1975 there were approximately 181 appeals lodged under the Local Government Act 1919 (NSW), seven claims for compensation for compulsory resumption of land, eight appeals lodged pursuant to section 38 of the Valuation of Land Act 1916 (NSW) from valuation boards of review, two claims for compensation lodged pursuant to section 342AC (1) of the Local Government Act 1919 (NSW), and ten references under the Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913 (NSW), by the Minister from local land boards.

The ground was demolished in 1994 as part of works for the Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit. The ground held approximately 18,000 people, and consisted of a main stand with a capacity of 2,000, with open terracing around the rest of the ground. History Soccer had been played in the Albert Park precinct since the 1880s. In the early 1900s the ground was used occasionally by the original St Kilda Soccer Club.http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/1934Cup.html In the 1950s, the site that would become Middle Park Stadium was designated as 'Oval No. 18'. During the 1950s, the site was used by South Melbourne United, and from 1957 by Melbourne Hakoah. In addition, a cycling track had been built around the perimeter of the soccer field in the early 1950s. By the late 1950s however, the cycling groups had abandoned the track due to spectators and soccer players' studs damaging the track. The ground was a fully enclosed venue by 1960, and a grandstand built by South Melbourne Hellas and Melbourne Hakoah, partly with funds lent to it by the Albert Park management authority was opened in the May 1961. Further attempts to improve the venue were often met with hostility from local residents. Apart from South Melbourne and Hakoah, one other tenant, Melbourne Hungaria, used the venue between 1969 and 1980. Other clubs to use the venue included Heidelberg United in the 1977http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/NSL/1977/Round12.html#0608 and 1978 National Soccer League seasons, as well as Brunswick Juventus in the 1990 and 1991 Victorian Premier League seasons. Middle Park also hosted the grand finals of the 1992, 1993 and 1994 Victorian Premier League seasons.

ART 13 radio transmitter History USS Nereus, circa. 1952 In 1940 the Collins Radio Company designed a new radio transmitter for the US Navy. The transmitter, Navy designation ATC, was later re-designated under the Joint Army-Navy (JAN) system as T-47/ART-13. The Army Air Force adopted a slightly improved version as the T-47A/ART-13, most made by Stewart-Warner. The USAAF matched the AN/ART-13A with the BC-348 receiver, whose -R and -Q models were known under the JAN system as the AN/ARR-11. The resulting communications system was known as the AN/ARC-8 and was the liaison radio set on many larger USAAF aircraft beginning late in World War II. Some were still in service in the early 1970s. The earlier AN/ART-13 was widely used in post-World War II Navy aircraft, being paired up post-World War II with the Navy's AN/ARR-15 auto-tune receiver. The resulting communications system was known as the AN/ARC-25. Its replacement began with the Collins AN/ARC-38 AM transceiver in the early 1950s, which in turn was upgraded to the AN/ARC-38A USB transceiver in the late 1950s. The Russians made nearly exact copies of the AN/ART-13 transmitter (called RSB-70 and R-807) for use on their military aircraft. It is thought that they obtained AN/ART-13 units from battle damaged B-29 bombers that landed in Russia during World War II. It was well known that the Russians copied the B-29 bomber calling their version the Tu-4.

It had ten autotuned VFO tuned channels that could be preset. Post-war modifications by COMCO and other companies added crystal frequency control capability and were approved for use on civil airliners. Power output was approximately 100 watts using an 813 vacuum tube as the final amplifier. Under favorable atmospheric conditions communications could be established between aircraft and ground stations separated by thousands of miles.

History On December 9, 2007, Robert Pickton, a pig farmer from Port Coquitlam, was convicted of second-degree murder in the deaths of six women. He was also charged in the deaths of an additional twenty women, many of them from Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. These charges were, however, stayed by the Crown in 2010. In December 2007, he was sentenced to life in prison, with no possibility of parole for 25 years. It was the longest sentence then available under Canadian law for murder. Following Pickton's arrest, there was increased attention given to a prior attempted murder charge of a sex worker in March 1997. Pickton was alleged to have stabbed her several times during an altercation at the farm. The victim informed police that Pickton had handcuffed her, but that she escaped after suffering several lacerations, disarming him, and stabbing him with his weapon. The charge was dismissed in January 1998. The mandate of the commission included evaluating why the 1997 charges against Pickton were stayed. The Missing Women Commission of Inquiry had four mandates: * Evaluate the response of the police to reports of missing women from Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, * Evaluate the reasons for staying charges against Robert Pickton in January 1998, * Recommend changes regarding how missing women and suspected homicides are handled * Recommend changes to how cases are handled when they involve more than one investigating organization In 2012, the Commission issued a final report which included a number of recommendations.

The goal of cellular manufacturing is to move as quickly as possible, make a wide variety of similar products, while making as little waste as possible. Cellular manufacturing involves the use of multiple \\"cells\\" in an assembly line fashion. Each of these cells is composed of one or multiple different machines which accomplish a certain task. The product moves from one cell to the next, each station completing part of the manufacturing process. Often the cells are arranged in a \\"U-shape\\" design because this allows for the overseer to move less and have the ability to more readily watch over the entire process. One of the biggest advantages of cellular manufacturing is the amount of flexibility that it has. Since most of the machines are automatic, simple changes can be made very rapidly. This allows for a variety of scaling for a product, minor changes to the overall design, and in extreme cases, entirely changing the overall design. These changes, although tedious, can be accomplished extremely quickly and precisely. A cell is created by consolidating the processes required to create a specific output, such as a part or a set of instructions. These cells allow for the reduction of extraneous steps in the process of creating the specific output, and facilitate quick identification of problems and encourage communication of employees within the cell in order to resolve issues that arise quickly. Once implemented, cellular manufacturing has been said to reliably create massive gains in productivity and quality while simultaneously reducing the amount of inventory, space and lead time required to create a product. It is for this reason that the one-piece-flow cell has been called \\"the ultimate in lean production.\\" History Cellular manufacturing is derivative of principles of group technology, which were proposed by Flanders in 19255\\\\. Flanders, R.E. 1925. Design, manufacture, and production control of a standard machine. Transactions of ASME, Vol. 26, 691-738. and adopted in Russia by Mitrofanov in 1933 (whose book6\\\\. Mitrofanov, S.P. 1959. The scientific principles of group technology. Leningrad (trans. By J.L. Grayson, Birmingham University). was translated into English in 1959). Burbidge actively promoted group technology in the 1970s.4\\\\. Burbidge, J.L. 1975. The Introduction to Group Technology. New York: John Wiley. \\"Apparently, Japanese firms began implementing cellular manufacturing sometime in the 1970s,\\" and in the 1980s cells migrated to the United States as an element of just-in-time (JIT) production.Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerl√∂v. 2002. op. cit. p 20 One of the first English-language books to discuss cellular manufacturing, that of Hall in 1983, referred to a cell as a ‚ÄúU-line,‚Äù for the common, or ideal, U-shaped configuration of a cell7\\\\. Hall, Robert W. 1983. Zero Inventories. Homewood, Ill., Dow Jones-Irwin. pp 120-126‚Äîideal because that shape puts all cell processes and operatives into a cluster, affording high visibility and contact. By 1990 cells had come to be treated as foundation practices in JIT manufacturing, so much so that Harmon and Peterson, in their book, Reinventing the Factory, included a section entitled, \\"Cell: Fundamental Factory of the Future\\".8\\\\. Harmon, R.L., and L.D. Peterson. 1990. Reinventing the Factory: Productivity Breakthroughs in Manufacturing Today.

Finally, when JIT/lean became widely attractive in the service sector, cellular concepts found their way into that realm; for example, Hyer and Wemmerl√∂v‚Äôs final chapter is devoted to office cells.1\\\\. Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerl√∂v. 2002. op. cit., pp 573-617 Cell design Cells are created in a workplace to facilitate flow. This is accomplished by bringing together operations or machines or people involved in a processing sequence of a products natural flow and grouping them close to one another, distinct from other groups. This grouping is called a cell. These cells are used to improve many factors in a manufacturing setting by allowing one-piece flow to occur. An example of one- piece flow would be in the production of a metallic case part that arrives at the factory from the vendor in separate pieces, requiring assembly. First, the pieces would be moved from storage to the cell, where they would be welded together, then polished, then coated, and finally packaged. All of these steps would be completed in a single cell, so as to minimize various factors (called non-value-added processes/steps) such as time required to transport materials between steps. Some common formats of single cells are: the U-shape (good for communication and quick movement of workers), the straight line, or the L-shape. The number of workers inside these formations depend on current demand and can be modulated to increase or decrease production. For example, if a cell is normally occupied by two workers and demand is doubled, four workers should be placed in the cell. Similarly, if demand halves, one worker will occupy the cell. Since cells have a variety of differing equipment, it is therefore a requirement that any employee is skilled at multiple processes. 188x188px While there exist many advantages to forming cells, there are some obvious benefits. It is quickly evident from observation of cells where inefficiencies lie, such as when an employee is too busy or relatively inactive. Resolving these inefficiencies can increase production and productivity by up to and above 100% in many cases. In addition to this, formation of cells consistently frees up floor space in the manufacturing/assembly environment (by having inventory only where it is absolutely required), improves safety in the work environment (due to smaller quantities of product/inventory being handled), improves morale (by imparting feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction in employees), reduces cost of inventory, and reducing inventory obsolescence. When formation of a cell would be too difficult, a simple principle is applied in order to improve efficiencies and flow, that is, to perform processes in a specific location and gather materials to that point at a rate dictated by an average of customer demand (this rate is called the takt time). This is referred to as the Pacemaker Process. Despite the advantages of designing for one-piece-flow, the formation of a cell must be carefully considered before implementation. Use of costly and complex equipment that tends to break down can cause massive delays in the production and will ruin output until they can be brought back online. The short travel distances within cells serve to quicken the flows. Moreover, the compactness of a cell minimizes space that might allow build-ups of inventory between cell stations. To formalize that advantage, cells often have designed-in rules or physical devices that limit the amount of inventory between stations. Such a rule is known, in JIT/lean parlance, as kanban (from the Japanese), which establishes a maximum number of units allowable between a providing and a using work station. (Discussion and illustrations of cells in combinations with kanban are found in1\\\\. Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerl√∂v. 2002. op. cit., pp 332-338) The simplest form, kanban squares, are marked areas on floors or tables between work stations. The rule, applied to the producing station: \\"If all squares are full, stop. If not, fill them up.\\"3\\\\. Hall, Robert W. 1987. op. cit., p 92 An office cell applies the same ideas: clusters of broadly trained cell-team members that, in concert, quickly handle all of the processing for a family of services or customers.1\\\\. Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerl√∂v. 2002. op. cit., p 5 A virtual cell is a variation in which all cell resources are not brought together in a physical space. In a virtual cell, as in the standard model, team members and their equipment are dedicated to a family of products or services. Although people and equipment are physically dispersed, as in a job shop, their narrow product focus aims for and achieves quick throughput, with all its advantages, just as if the equipment were moved into a cellular cluster.1\\\\. Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerl√∂v. 2002. op. cit., pp 27, 136, 585-586 Lacking the visibility of physical cells, virtual cells may employ the discipline of kanban rules in order to tightly link the flows from process to process. A simple but rather complete description of cell implementation comes from a 1985 booklet of 96 pages by Kone Corp. in Finland, producer of elevators, escalators, and the like. Excerpts follow:  Implementation process  In order to implement cellular manufacturing, a number of steps must be performed. First, the parts to be made must be grouped by similarity (in design or manufacturing requirements) into families. Then a systematic analysis of each family must be performed; typically in the form of production flow analysis (PFA) for manufacturing families, or in the examination of design/product data for design families. This analysis can be time consuming and costly, but is important because a cell needs to be created for each family of parts. Clustering of machines and parts is one of the most popular production flow analysis methods. The algorithms for machine part grouping include Rank Order Clustering, Modified Rank Order Clustering, and Similarity coefficients. There are also a number of mathematical models and algorithms to aid in planning a cellular manufacturing center, which take into account a variety of important variables such as, \\"multiple plant locations, multi-market allocations with production planning and various part mix.\\" Once these variables are determined with a given level of uncertainty, optimizations can be performed to minimize factors such as, \\"total cost of holding, inter-cell material handling, external transportation, fixed cost for producing each part in each plant, machine and labor salaries.\\"  Difficulties in creating flow  The key to creating flow is continuous improvement to production processes. Upon implementation of cellular manufacturing, management commonly \\"encounters strong resistance from production workers\\". It will be beneficial to allow the change to cellular manufacturing to happen gradually. In this process. It is also difficult to fight the desire to have some inventory on hand. It is tempting, since it would be easier to recover from an employee suddenly having to take sick leave. Unfortunately, in cellular manufacturing, it is important to remember the main tenants: \\"You sink or swim together as a unit\\" and that \\"Inventory hides problems and inefficiencies.\\" If the problems are not identified and subsequently resolved, the process will not improve. Another common set of problems stems from the need to transfer materials between operations. These problems include, \\"exceptional elements, number of voids, machine distances, bottleneck machines and parts, machine location and relocation, part routing, cell load variation, inter and intracellular material transferring, cell reconfiguring, dynamic part demands, and operation and completion times.\\" These difficulties need to be considered and addressed to create efficient flow in cellular manufacturing. Benefits and costs Cellular manufacturing brings scattered processes together to form short, focused paths in concentrated physical space. So constructed, by logic a cell reduces flow time, flow distance, floor space, inventory, handling, scheduling transactions, and scrap and rework (the latter because of quick discovery of nonconformities). Moreover, cells lead to simplified, higher validity costing, since the costs of producing items are contained within the cell rather than scattered in distance and the passage of reporting time.1\\\\. Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerl√∂v. 2002. op. cit. Chapter 10: Cost Accounting and Cellular Manufacturing, pp 281-310)Frecka, Thomas J. Accounting for Manufacturing Productivity: A Set of Papers from an AME Meeting--Problems and Directions in Cost Accounting. Association for Manufacturing Excellence, 2nd Printing. Several of the 11 articles in this report pertain to changes in cost accounting stemming from JIT production, and cells in particular. Cellular manufacturing facilitates both production and quality control. Cells that are underperforming in either volume or quality can be easily isolated and targeted for improvement. The segmentation of the production process allows problems to be easily located and it is more clear which parts are affected by the problem. There are also a number of benefits for employees working in cellular manufacturing. The small cell structure improves group cohesiveness and scales the manufacturing process down to a more manageable level for the workers. Workers can more easily see problems or possible improvements within their own cells and tend to be more self-motivated to propose changes. Additionally, these improvements that are instigated by the workers themselves cause less and less need for management, so over time overhead costs can be reduced. Furthermore, the workers often are able to rotate between tasks within their cell, which offers variety in their work. This can further increase efficiency because work monotony has been linked to absenteeism and reduced production quality. Case studies in just-in-time and lean manufacturing are replete with impressive quantitative measures along those lines. For example, BAE Systems, Platform Solutions (Fort Wayne, Ind.), producing aircraft engine monitors and controls, implemented cells for 80 percent of production, reducing customer lead time 90 percent, work-in-process inventory 70 percent, space for one product family from 6,000 square feet to 1,200 square feet, while increasing product reliability 300 percent, multi- skilling the union-shop work force, and being designated an Industry Week Best Plant for the year 2000.9\\\\. Sheridan, John L. 2000. ‚ÄúLean Sigma synergy,‚Äù Industry Week (October 16) pp 81-82. By five years later, rework and scrap had been cut 50 percent, new product introduction cycles 60 percent, and transactions 90 percent, while also increasing inventory turns three-fold and service turn times 30 percent, and being awarded a Shingo Prize for the year 2005.10\\\\. 2005 Shingo Prize website. It appears to be difficult to isolate how much of those benefits accrue from cellular organization itself; among many case studies researched for this article few include attempts at isolating the benefits. One exception is the contention, at Steward, Inc. (Chattanooga, Tenn.), producing nickel zinc ferrite parts for electromagnetic interference suppression. According to case study authors, cells resulted in reductions of cycle time from 14 to 2 days, work-in-process inventories by 80 percent, finished inventories by 60 percent, lateness by 96 percent, and space by 56 percent.11\\\\. Levasseur, Gerls A., Marilyn M. Helms, and Aleisha A. Zink. 1995. ‚ÄúA Conversion from a functional to a cellular manufacturing layout at Steward, Inc. Production and Inventory Management. 3rd quarter, pp 37-42. Another cellular case study includes quantitative estimates of the extent to which cells contributed to overall benefits. At Hughes Ground Systems Group (Fullerton, Calif.), producing circuit cards for defense equipment, the first cell, which began as a pilot project with 15 volunteers, was launched in 1987. One month later a second cell began, and by 1992 all production employees, numbering about 150, had been integrated into seven cells. Prior to cells, circuit card cycle time, from kit release to shipment to the customer, had been 38 weeks. After the cells had taken over the full production sequence (mechanical assembly, wave solder, thermal cycle, and conformal coat), cycle time had fallen to 30.5 weeks, of which production manager John Reiss attributed 20 weeks to use of a \\"WIP chart system\\" by the cell teams and the other 10.5 weeks to the cellular organization itself. Later, when it seemed that the cells were overly large and cumbersome, cell sizes were shrunk by two-thirds, resulting in ‚Äúmicro cells‚Äù that cut cycle time by another 1.5 weeks. Finally, by adopting certain other improvements, cycle times had decreased to four weeks. Other improvements included reducing work-in-process inventory from 6 or 7 days to one day and percent defective from 0.04 to 0.01Tonkin, Lea A.P. 1992. Hughes Ground Systems Group Takes Aim at Defects, Delays. Target (May‚ÄìJune). pp 25-27 Switching from a functional (job-shop) layout to cells often costs has a minus net cost, inasmuch as the cell reduces costs of transport, work-in-process and finished inventory, transactions, and rework.1\\\\. Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerl√∂v. 2002. op. cit., pp 225-232 When large, heavy, expensive pieces of equipment (sometimes called ‚Äúmonuments‚Äù in lean lingo) must be moved, however, the initial costs can be high to the point where cells are not feasible.1\\\\. Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerl√∂v. 2002. op cit., pp 519-521 There are a number of possible limitations to implementing cellular manufacturing. Some argue that cellular manufacturing can lead to a decrease in production flexibility. Cells are typically designed to maintain a specific flow volume of parts being produced. Should the demand or necessary quantity decrease, the cells may have to be realigned to match the new requirements, which is a costly operation, and one not typically required in other manufacturing setups.

An eccentric toothed gear is mounted on a hexagonal shaft. The wrench is introduced inside the pipe (especially a close nipple, which has threading its entire length, and therefore no surface for an outside wrench). As the wrench is turned, the eccentric gear is forced to grip the inside of the pipe. As with a regular pipe wrench, the mechanism is such that the grip on the pipe increases with the torque applied on the wrench. It is a relatively obscure but often useful tool.

Hallmarking is a way to guarantee the purity of precious metals. Metals are tested and, if they meet a certain minimal purity requirement, are marked with a specified seal. In the United Kingdom (UK), this is done by the Assay Offices in London, Birmingham, Sheffield, and Edinburgh. The Act made business transactions involving unmarked metals illegal. Trading Standards departments are responsible for enforcing the Act. Another notable consequence of the Act was the formation of the British Hallmarking Council (BHC). This council is responsible for advising the Secretary of State in matters of hallmarking, making certain the UK has acceptable hallmarking facilities, and overseeing the Assay Offices so they follow the legal hallmarking standards. The council has made many important contributions concerning UK hallmarking procedures. In 1992, the European Commission proposed a Directive meant to cover hallmarking. The BHC examined the document and found multiple areas of ambiguity and deficiency. When the European Parliament voted on the Council‚Äôs recommendations, many were approved. The Hallmarking Regulations 1998 and The Hallmarking Order 1998 caused the legitimisation of hallmarks of other member states (those countries that ratified the Convention on the Control of Articles of Precious Metals of 1972). The council was responsible for clearing up ambiguous statements in the regulations and for extending its definition to deal with other problems in the hallmarking law. Some of these changes include seven additional standards of fineness, a change in the standard mark, and the dropping of the date requirement on marked metals.

Composed of functionaries from the KPD and ten anti-fascist prisoners of war, their job was to seek out anti-fascist individuals and prepare the groundwork for the re-establishment of communist organizations and unions in postwar Berlin. There were two additional regional groups, the Ackermann Group in Saxony and the Sobottka Group in Mecklenburg. Many of the group's members later became high-level officials in the government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR).  Political operation  The tasks for the Ulbricht Group and the other communist cadre who were to return to Germany were defined at a meeting between Wilhelm Pieck and Georgi Dimitrov held in Moscow on April 25, 1945. Dimitrov was then a high-level functionary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, working as the assistant division leader of the International Information Division. They were to prepare the region to accept and follow the instructions of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany so the Nazi government could be dismantled. The de-nazification process was to convince the people to turn over Nazi war criminals. The Group was to calm people and assure them that the Red Army would neither destroy nor enslave them, but that the German people had to understand that they bore the responsibility for the Nazi's rise to power, giving force to Hitler's policies and causing the catastrophe. The communists had tried to warn them of the coming catastrophe and they were now there to help them out of their distress and at the same time, establish a basis for the future of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).Stiftung Archiv der Parteien und Massenorganisationen der DDR: SAPMO-BArch, NY 4036/ 500, Bl. 109 (Urschrift), Bl. 39‚Äì40 (Klarschrift) They were also to seek out anti-fascist individuals who would be willing to work with the new organizations. The youngest member of the group was 24-year- old Wolfgang Leonhard.Stefan Aust and Frank Schirrmacher, Du gehst in das Institut Nummer 99 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (May 14, 2005).

Retrieved November 12, 2011 The Ulbricht Group left from the Hotel Lux, where they had been living in exile, some for years, and flew from Moscow to Minsk, then to Calau, near Miƒôdzyrzecz. Not all members of the group knew what their assignment was or how long it would last until after they landed. They landed in an airfield and were met by a Soviet officer, who drove away with Ulbricht. The rest left by truck for Bruchm√ºhle, about east of Berlin and the offices of Marshal Georgy Zhukov, the first commander of the Soviet occupation zone. The Ulbricht Group began working from there on May 2, 1945, though not much could be done with the city in flames after the Battle of Berlin. In the evening, Ulbricht met with the group and explained their assignment. They were to cover all 20 districts in Berlin and begin building local administrations. In each, they were to seek out as many social democrats as possible, also a civil servant with a Ph.D from each local administration who was willing to work with the Soviets and a cleric to lead a religious advisory council. Communists were to be installed in each district as assistant administrator, and to head up the departments for personnel and development. The group worked from Bruchm√ºhle till May 8, after which they moved to the Friedrichsfelde area of Berlin. On May 6, 1945, Ulbricht gave the Soviet commander of Berlin, Nikolai Berzarin, the first list of suggested names to fill important administrative posts in Berlin. On May 12, 1945, the district administrators and city councils were appointed from Ulbricht's list without exception. Paul Markgraf, one of the ten anti-fascist prisoners of war, was appointed the \\"Berlin Police President\\", also on Ulbricht's initiative.For more on the ten anti-fascist prisoners of war and Ulbricht's list of names, see: Jochen Staadt, Wir packen mit an, Ordnung zu schaffen, in: Forschungsverbund SED- Staat der Freien Universit√§t Berlin (Eds.), Zeitschrift des Forschungsverbundes SED-Staat, Edition No. 28/2010, pp. 90-117, here pp. 92-94 In the beginning of June 1945, Ulbricht, Ackermann and Sobottka traveled back to Moscow to give the first reports and get their further instructions. On June 4, 1945, they met with Pieck, Joseph Stalin and Andrei Zhdanov. Stalin urged them to found a nationwide working class party that would remain open for the proletariat, farmers and intellectuals. He wanted the party to work for a unified Germany and said in his opinion, the West wanted to split the country into partitions, so, according to Pieck, their goal was to \\"[complete] the civil-democratic revolution through a civil-democratic government.\\"Wilhelm Pieck's notes from June 4, 1945, cited by Wilfried Loth, Stalins ungeliebtes Kind. Warum Moskau die DDR nicht wollte, Rowohlt Berlin (1994), p. 24 The founding manifesto of the KPD was written by Ackermann. In it, the new party spoke openly against a sovietization of Germany. It said the goal was to \\"continue to its conclusion the civil-democratic transformation begun with the revolutions of 1848\\" and through land reform, to eliminate the \\"remnants of feudalism\\". The goal the Party named was as the \\"establishment of an anti- fascist, democratic republic with all democratic rights and freedoms for the people\\".Rolf Steininger, Deutsche Geschichte 1945-1961. Darstellung und Dokumente in zwei B√§nden, Fischer, Frankfurt am Main (1983), Vol. 1, p. 159 With the re-establishment of the KPD on June 11, 1945, the Ulbricht Group reached its first goal. On July 10, 1945, it moved into the KPD's Central Committee building.  Existence concealed  Until 1955 and the publication of Wolfgang Leonhard's book, Die Revolution entl√§√üt ihre Kinder (later published in English as Child of the Revolution), knowledge of the Ulbricht Group was kept secret. In Leonhard's opinion, it was kept secret so as not to emphasize the role of communist exiles from Moscow in the establishment of the GDR. After 1955, several versions of the story appeared regarding the composition of the group and the order of events leading to the appointments. There is disagreement among historians as to whether or not Stalin and Ackermann were earnest in their affirmation of parliamentarian democracy and fundamental rights. Leonhard reported the oft-cited comment by Ulbricht made during this period, \\"It is quite clear. It must look democratic, but we must have everything in hand.\\"Wolfgang Leonhardt, Die Revolution entl√§√üt ihre Kinder, Kiepenheuer und Witsch, Cologne (1955), p. 440 Some historians say that by spring 1945, the establishment of a communist-dominated government in the Soviet-occupied zone and the proclaimed democracy was merely a transitional stageManfred Wilke (Ed.): Anatomie der Parteizentrale.

In August 1993, the supreme courts of Iowa and Michigan ordered her returned to Schmidt, who named her Anna Jacqueline Schmidt. The case was widely publicized as the \\"Baby Jessica\\" case after the name given her by the DeBoers. The case name is In re Clausen 442 Mich. 648 (1993). Overview Anna was born in 1991 to Cara Clausen, who placed her for adoption with Jan and Roberta DeBoer without telling Schmidt that he was the father. She also put a different man's name on the birth certificate, further obscuring paternity. The adoption process was handled by the DeBoers' attorney, whom Clausen erroneously thought was also her attorney. Five days after the birth, Clausen changed her mind, informed Schmidt of his paternity, and told the DeBoers that she wanted to cancel the adoption. Clausen had already relinquished her parental rights so there was nothing that she could do. But Schmidt had not relinquished his parental rights so he could and did stop the adoption proceedings. The DeBoers, however, believing that the most important issue was the best interest of the child, rather than parental rights, attempted to complete the adoption. Clausen and Schmidt later married, and Schmidt went to court to get Anna returned to them. The DeBoers, who had named the baby \\"Jessica,\\" battled to keep the child for 2¬Ω years, but ultimately lost. Because the adoption process had never been completed, the Michigan court had no choice but to give full faith and credit to the sister state judgment from Iowa and order \\"Jessica/Anna\\" to be returned to her biological parents. At the time, courts tended to side with birth parents rather than adoptive parents, and not take into consideration the interests of the child in question. Since the \\"Baby Jessica\\" case, however, a further case decided on the grounds of the putative adoptive child's best interest has provided a possible precedent that in disputed cases of adoption, the rights of three parties will be considered: those of the adoptive parent(s), the biological parent(s), and also the child. See Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl. Roberta \\"Robby\\" DeBoer later wrote a book called Losing Jessica about the case, and the DeBoers established a child advocacy group called Hear My Voice that advocates for children involved in difficult custody cases, with a pro- adoptive parent angle. A TV movie dramatizing the events, Whose Child Is This? The War for Baby Jessica was produced, but was criticized by some for being biased in favor of the DeBoers. In the film, the DeBoers, who were better educated than the Schmidts and had a better financial position, were portrayed as an affluent, ideal family for the child, while the Schmidts were portrayed as less educated, unsuitable parents. Anna said in 2003 that she has no memory of the DeBoers and was doing well with her biological family.

It existed between 17 July and 20 November 1921. Gjoni led his Roman Catholic Mirdita tribesmen in a rebellion against the Albanian regency and parliament established after the World War I. The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), and its newly enthroned King Aleksandar Karadjordjevic backed Gjoni based on its interest of having another separatist region within Albania, weakening the newly created Albanian state and sharpening the religious antagonism. Gjoni proclaimed in Prizren the founding of an independent Republic of Mirdita. Gjoni was the only president of the republic. As the republic violated the sovereignty of the Albanian state, Albanian government troops fought and eventually extinguished the republic. The putative government of the republic was overrun by the Albanian government, though no real persecution fell on the main leaders. Gjoni fled to Yugoslavia, but later returned to Albania and remained active in the political life of the highlands until his death in 1925. History =Background= The region of Mirdita has been traditionally known for the Catholic resistance against the ruling Ottoman Muslims. This resistance has its roots in the 15th century, when the Mirditors fought Ottoman armies under the leadership of Gjergj Kastrioti ‚Äì Skenderbeg. Furthermore, the Mirditors are said to be the direct brothers of the Dukagjini tribe, meaning both regions were directed by one ancestor. The Mirditors were successful in uniting with Kurbin, Lezh√´, Dukagjin, Puk√´, Shkod√´r, and Mal√´sia areas in order to preserve their culture, religion, and obtain autonomy from the Ottoman Empire. =Proclamation and attempted establishment of Mirdita republic= In 1919, Prenk Bib Doda, the childless chieftain (Kapedan) of the Catholic Mirdita tribe was assassinated in 1919 near the marshes of Lezha and left no clear successors. Marka Gjoni, a relative became a claimant and successor for the position of chieftain however many of the Mirdita leaders refused to acknowledge him and he lacked popularity among the tribe due to issues of cowardice shown during the First World War. He allowed Yugoslav authorities to declare on his behalf the independence of the Mirdita republic (July 1921) in Prizren, Yugoslavia.. Gjoni received Yugoslav support, weapons, money, and of whom placed Wrangel's White Russian army at his service for the endeavour and the motive for independence he alleged was that the Albanian government or \\"Turks\\" were going to ban Catholicism. The events of the Mirdita republic coincided with international negotiations over finalising the Albanian-Yugoslav border which was viewed by participants as important and these discussions were ongoing during November 1921. Gjoni urged Yugoslavian authorities to take steps to secure the recognition of the Mirdita republic, while the Yugoslavs hoped that rebellion in northern Albania would have its territorial claims supported to the region. Greece gave recognition to the Mirdita republic. At the League of Nations, the Yugoslav government accused the Albanian government of being a tool of Muslim landowning elites while Albania responded that it was not a government of Muslims and represented Albanian people from all religions.. The Yugoslav government disputed that the Albanian government of Tirana represented all Albanians, due to the existence of the Mirdita republic which threw in doubt Albania's status of being a country thus affecting it being a League member.. The Yugoslav delegation contended that two governments existed and a unity of the people did not exist. Great Britain, which recognised the Albanian government in November 1921, rejected Yugoslavia's position by sending through its prime minister Lloyd George multiple heated diplomatic protests to Belgrade demanding its withdrawal from disputed areas. The intervention by Great Britain was important as Yugoslav support for Gjoni ended thereafter.. The British government advised the League of Nations that actions should be taken against Yugoslavia based upon Article 16 of the League's Covenant and the Conference of Ambassadors suggested sanctions.. The League of Nations recognised Albania's borders to be those of 1913 with small territorial adjustments in favour of Yugoslavia. Ahmet Zog was sent to the Mirdita region by the Albanian government with a contingent of Albanian troops and irregular forces that defeated the secessionist move by 20 November 1921. Upon arrival Zog offered lenient terms of no reprisals if the rebellion ceased, while Gjoni fled to Yugoslavia. Local Mirditor elders negotiated with Zog for a deal with the central government.. Mirdita was placed under state of siege, Gjoni and his followers were proclaimed traitors to Albania and other Mirditors associated with the events were punished in a government political court. Previous arrangements dating to the Ottoman period that gave Mirdita autonomy through indirect rule were abolished.. After some time Marka Gjoni was allowed to return to Albania and in Mirdita was active in local affairs for a few years before his death. = Legacy = The former territories of Mirdita Republic were shrunk in size and population by less than half, known today as Mirdita Region. Mirdit√´ District would be created later. Other neighboring districts take stake to the annexed parts of \\"Old Mirdita\\" (), known by the locals only.

SH 67's southern terminus is at SH 96 in Wetmore, and the northern terminus is at U.S. Route 85 (US 85) in Sedalia. It traverses the former route of the Florence and Cripple Creek Railroad through Phantom Canyon as a county road and carrying part of the Gold Belt Byway. SH 67 forms the eastern border of the Mueller State Park near Divide. Route description Signage indicating a terminus of SH 67. SH 67 begins at its southern terminus with State Highway 96 in Wetmore, Colorado. It proceeds north into Fremont County and the city of Florence, where it is signed as Robinson Avenue to State Highway 115 (Main Street) and overlaps the highway for half a mile west before turning north again, signed as Pikes Peak Avenue. The highway crosses the Arkansas River on its way out of the city and continues northward to a junction with U.S Route 50 adjacent to Fremont County Airport. The state portion of the highway ends at U.S. Highway 50 and becomes the county-maintained Phantom Canyon Road (CR 67 in Fremont County), carrying the Gold Belt Byway through Phantom Canyon north to Victor, where the state highway resumes, turning west and north before heading into Cripple Creek. The road turns east for a few miles before resuming its northward path, acting as the eastern border of Mueller State Park for several miles before reaching a junction with U.S. Highway 24 in Divide. Again the state portion of the highway ends to overlap U.S. Highway 24 for east into Woodland Park, splitting off the concurrent road to turn north once again. Continuing to the north- northwest, the road enters the Pike National Forest, passing turnoffs for Red Rock Campground and the Manitou Park Recreation Area's Colorado Campground and Painted Rocks Campground before turning west and entering Douglas County, where it promptly heads into Westcreek and turns north until it reaches a junction with North Rainbow Falls Road and turns to the northwest. SH 67 near Woodland Park In Deckers, the state portion of the road again ends to overlap County Road 126 and heads to the north-northeast signed as South Platte Canyon Road.

The route turns east and changes name again to Jarre Canyon Road, resume state highway status at its intersection with Rampart Range Road southwest of Sedalia. The route leaves Pike National Forest a few miles east of resuming state highway status and continues northeast with increasing intersections as it approaches Sedalia. After crossing State Highway 105 (Perry Park Road), the route turns north and is named Manhart Street for a few blocks before reaching its northern terminus at U.S. Highway 85. History SH 67 is an original 1920s state highway and was originally an unbroken route. In 1994, the route was rerouted around the Little Ike Tunnel near Cripple Creek, altering the location of the Horsethief Park Trail trailhead to the east side of the tunnel. The Cripple Creek and Victor Gold Mining Company funded the realignment of nearly two miles of Highway 67 and built the highest bridge on the Colorado State Highway system, the Arequa Gulch Bridge, as part of its Cresson Mine expansion in 2001. In July 2006, a flood on West Creek washed out the highway north of the town of Westcreek, closing the highway between Westcreek and Deckers to two-way traffic until reconstruction was completed.

VC and People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) cadre and combatants who defected and rallied to become aligned with the South Vietnamese government were known as Chi√™u H·ªìi or H·ªìi Ch√°nh Vi√™n, the latter being a term loosely translated as \\"members who have returned to the righteous side\\". Only a very small number of these Chi√™u H·ªìi were selected, trained, and deployed with U.S. infantry units as Kit Carson Scouts. Program origins The concept of using soldiers and cadre who had previously fought on the enemy side in this way originated in late 1966 with the 5th Counterintelligence Team, which had counterintelligence tasks within the Danang Chi√™u H·ªìi Center as one responsibility. Most H·ªìi Ch√°nh Vi√™n recruited into the fledgling Kit Carson Scout program had defected to Saigon's side in the war because they suffered either from malaria or grave wounds beyond what could be medically treated with the rudimentary medical care available on the VC/PACN side. Those Chieu Hoi (H·ªìi Ch√°nh Vi√™n) who volunteered for selection and training as Kit Carson Scouts had, during their service with the enemy, little or no contact with anyone speaking English. Few had any knowledge at all of the English language, creating a communication challenge as they were deployed with American units. A further complication was that almost all H·ªìi Ch√°nh Vi√™n had a distrust of Vietnamese soldiers and interpreters because of the degree to which friendly forces had been infiltrated by enemy agents. Major General Herman Nickerson Jr., commanding the 1st Marine Division at the time, named them Kit Carson Scouts after Kit Carson the American frontiersman. The first six Kit Carson Scouts were placed in the field with the 1st and 9th Marine Regiments as part of a trial program in October, 1966. All but one of the original group of six would later be killed in action. The VC defectors initially recruited to work as intelligence scouts with U.S. Marine infantry units were paid by the U.S. and were treated as staff non-commissioned officers with a nominal rank (not official) of staff sergeant. History Marines, led by a Vietnamese Kit Carson Scout during Operation Oklahoma Hills. Circa March 31,1969 From October to December 1966 III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF) credited Kit Carson Scouts with killing 47 VC, capturing 16 weapons and discovering 18 mines and tunnels. By the end of 1966 19 Kit Carson Scouts were serving with the 1st Marine Division. In February 1968 General Lewis William Walt ordered the program to be adopted throughout III MAF and a Kit Carson training center was established at Danang to standardize training. By the end of 1967 132 scouts served with the Marines in I Corps and were credited with killing 58 VC, capturing 37 and 82 weapons. On 29 April 1967, the Intelligence Section of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) published a procedural document detailing the expansion of the Kit Carson Scout Program for all active U.S. Army units in country, including the scout's terms of service and wages. As the program evolved, recruitment of non- military VC cadre and defecting PAVN officers were added, and these Kit Carson Scouts also became valuable sources of intelligence in the conduct of the war. General Westmoreland issued an order in September 1967 directing all infantry divisions in Vietnam, including U.S. Army units, to begin using Kit Carson Scouts in conjunction with friendly operations. He directed that a minimum of 100 scouts per division was necessary to ensure effectiveness with a target of 1,500 scouts by the end of 1968. In 1968 the number of scouts increased from 132 to 476 with 102 serving with the 1st Marine Division, 106 with the 3rd Marine Division, 153 with the 101st Airborne Division and 115 with the 23rd Infantry Division with a further 22 undergoing training. Throughout the year scouts were credited with killing 312 VC/PAVN, apprehending 851 suspects and locating 720 tunnels and supply caches and over 1300 booby-traps. During 1969 the number of scouts working with III MAF grew from 476 to 597 despite the redeployment of the 3rd Marine Division during the year. The scouts were credited with killing 191 VC/PAVN, capturing 539 and 195 weapons and locating 143 tunnels and caches and 518 booby-traps. In January 1969 scouts began being assigned to Allied forces starting with the 1st Australian Task Force, followed by the Royal Thai Army Expeditionary Division in August 1969 and South Korean forces in December 1970. A report given to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee in February, 1970 listed 230 Kit Carson Scouts killed in action and 716 wounded. At the beginning of 1970 over 2,300 scouts served with U.S. forces, with 165 serving in III MAF. III MAF recruited potential scouts from Chi√™u H·ªìi centers in Danang and Hoi An. An experienced Marine NCO investigated the background of motivation of each potential recruit and those who passed would then go to a training center west of Danang for 28 days of training and evaluation. Class sizes were small, usually consisting of no more than eight men. Training including fieldcraft, field sketching, use of sensors and basic English. As the Marines redeployed from South Vietnam the number of scouts serving with III MAF dropped to 111 in July and 95 in December. During 1970 III MAF scouts were credited with killing 43 VC and capturing 313 and 96 weapons. In June 1970 as part of the Vietnamization program, the Kit Carson Program name was changed to L·ª±c L∆∞·ª£ng 66 (Vietnamese for Force 66), but scout numbers declined as U.S. forces withdrew from South Vietnam with only 400 scouts serving by the end of 1970.

The name derives from the Bengali word ut'tar meaning \\"north\\". It lies on the road to Gazipur, and adjoins Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. Uttara is a primarily planned square grid residential suburb, geographically elevated from southern Dhaka saving it from floods, and is divided into several \\"sectors\\". It can be said that Uttara is far from the congestion and pollution of Dhaka. Indeed, well into the 1990s, Uttara retained its quiet, leafy suburban character. In recent years, with the increasing influx of people moving in from the city, Uttara has evolved into a bustling town, similar to other areas of Dhaka such as Gulshan, Mohakhali, Banani, Mirpur, Mohammadpur or Dhanmondi. The suburb is well-served by a proliferation of shopping complexes, shops, and schools and colleges. Uttara is not a village Geography Uttara is planned by RAJUK and divided into 14 sectors, starting from sector 1 to sector 14. Originally it was planned that the odd-numbered sectors (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) were to be situated on the west side of Dhaka-Mymensingh Highway, and the even-numbered sectors (2, 4, 6, 8) on the east side. Due to increase in population, new sectors were planned but this order was not upheld and they were all developed on the west side. Uttara Residential Area (3rd Phase) project is now underway. Demographics At the 2001 Bangladesh census, Uttara had a population of 345,097. According to 1991 figures, males constitute 54.41% of the population and females 45.59%, and about 60% of the Uttara's population are adults. Uttara has an average literacy rate of 61% (7+ years). Economy The middle class demography has attracted the establishment of market complexes like Rajlaxmi Complex, Amir Complex, RAJUK Commercial Complex, Uttara Tower, H.M. Plaza and the likes. The increase in the upper middle class population gave rise to demand for shopping outlets, giving rise to shopping centres like North Tower, Polwel Carnation, Mascot Plaza, Tropical Alaudin Tower, and RAK Tower. United Airways has its head office in Uttara Tower,\\"Our offices.\\" United Airways.

Travelers entering the city centre can take buses, taxis or CNG-driven three-wheelers southbound on the highway. Travelers coming towards Uttara from within the city must travel on any bus that travels through Khilkhet and the airport to Uttara. Travelers coming to Uttara from northern Bangladesh must board a coach that enters Dhaka via Abdullahpur/Tongi, as most buses enter Dhaka city from the Gabtoli entry. Travelers coming from southern Bangladesh to Uttara must disembark at their designated stops and board a local bus to Uttara. uttara airport road The nearest railway station to Uttara is located opposite to the airport, and is called the Airport Rail Station. airport road dhaka As of 2010, Uttara and Mirpur, two of the northernmost parts of Dhaka city, were not linked by any form of direct transportation link. Between the two areas, there was a large uninhabited swamp. This is to be changed as a bridge is being constructed between the two areas.

More recently those seeking asylum or protection based on torture claims are a fast growing part of the city's population, increasing since 2004 due to changes in the legal system for considering asylum and torture claims mandated by local courts. As of September 2017, there were about 14,000 pending or failed asylum seekers or torture claimants awaiting processing, adjudication, appeals, or deportation after failure to gain refugee status. With roughly 60% from South Asia, 30% from Southeast Asia, and nearly 10% from Africa. Almost none of the asylum seekers or torture claimants are ultimately sustained by immigration authorities and judicial review to have a bona fide claim and granted refugee status or protection in Hong Kong. A public debate surrounds the asylum system with criticism voiced from some sectors of the press and political spectrum about the high cost of supporting the living expenses of the asylum seekers and torture claimants, process abuse by those seeking asylum and protection who are without a bona fide claim to fear of torture or persecution, and the crime committed by applicants who typically wait for years to have claims adjudicated. Definitions A refugee is a person holding refugee status based on the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. An asylum seeker is a person claiming to be a refugee but who has not had his or her status determined in the prospective country. A torture claimant is a person claiming protection in the prospective country from being returned to another state where there are \\"substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to torture\\" according to the United Nations Convention against Torture. History Turmoil in the region has been a cause of refugees waves to the city, which has long attracted those fleeing persecution as well as many in search of a better life. The end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 resulted in the population growing from 600,000 to 2.1 million between 1945 and 1951, meaning a large proportion of the Hong Kong population are descended from refugees. Included amongst this wave were also thousands of Russian refugees who had migrated from mainland China through Hong Kong during the 1950s and 1960s. These were White Russians who had fled the Soviet Union after the Communist Revolution in 1917 and settled in Manchuria and Sinkiang, but had to flee again after the Communists assumed control of China in 1949. For more than two decades they were stranded, billeted in hotels with their expenses shared by the UNHCR and the World Council of Churches waiting for resettlement by UNHCR in countries including the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand. It is estimated that by 1980 a total of twenty thousand White Russians from mainland China had passed through Hong Kong on their way to resettlement in overseas destinations. In the next wave, the end of the Vietnam War brought hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese refugees. Ultimately, of the refugee claims, 143,700 Vietnamese refugees were resettled in third countries while about 67,000 Vietnamese migrants were deported back to Vietnam. Only about 1,000 Vietnamese refugees were granted permission to reside and assimilate in Hong Kong. Since 2004 after a series of rulings by Hong Kong courts prohibited the immigration authority in Hong Kong from removal of any illegal immigrants as long as those individuals claimed persecution or risk of torture and awaited adjudication of their claims. There was a dramatic increase in the number of asylum seekers and torture claimants after 2004. A March 2013 holding by the Court of Final Appeal held that determination of refugee claims is subject to judicial review. This landmark holding prompted Hong Kong to restructure the system for considering claims into a Unified Screening Mechanism in 2014. In the period from 2014‚Äì15, the number of asylum seeker claims has soared, rising by 70% from early 2014 to mid-2015 due to consolidation of claims for both persecution and torture under the Unified Screening Mechanism. Unified Screening Mechanism Since 2014, the system for consideration of asylum and torture claims in Hong Kong is implemented under the common umbrella of the Unified Screening Mechanism and administrated by the Department of Immigration. By commencing this mechanism UNHCR has ceased the screening of asylum claims under its mandate in Hong Kong and the two processes are no longer to be handled separately by the UNHCR considering asylum seekers who claimed risk of persecution and the Hong Kong government assessing claims of torture risk. Rejection of claims made by the department is subject to appeal before Hong Kong courts. Whereas in other countries successful applications result in lawful residence, successful applications in Hong Kong mean only that people will not be returned to their countries of origin (non-refoulement). They are not given any form of lawful residence and can only apply for six-month permits to work, granted at the discretion of the Director of Immigration. Process abuse The official government position as stated by an Immigration Department spokesperson in 2012 is Hong Kong has a \\"long-established policy of not granting asylum and we do not admit individuals seeking refugee status\\" citing fears that asylum seekers would abuse the system given the prosperity of the city's economy and liberal visa policy. The rate of success of torture claims is extremely low. By 2013, the Torture Claim Assessment Section by the Immigration Department assessed 4532 claims, of which only 12 were sustained as substantiated. As of June 2019 172 of 21,553 claims were substantiated. This 0.8 substantiation rate extremely low compared to rates of 25-62% per cent in other developed jurisdictions. There have been complaints about the competency of decision making after reports of judges relying on Wikipedia for information about the claimant's country of origin, and refusing to adjourn proceedings even when the claimant was suffering from pregnancy-induced pain. The 2013 Annual Report of the Immigration Department notes that most torture claims are filed after either the claimant has been arrested for contravening Hong Kong law, notified of their removal from Hong Kong, or has had their claim for refugee status rejected by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The South China Morning Post has noted that some asylum seekers are motivated to make claims to illegally work in Hong Kong for years, which is the length of time it can take to process claims. Demographics As of September 2017, there are about 14,000 asylum seekers awaiting determination of their claims. Over half of the asylum seekers are from the following three South Asian countries: Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh, with nearly a third from Southeast Asia and 10% from Africa. Asylum seekers live in low cost housing due to the basic level of rental subsidy provided by the Hong Kong government and extremely high cost of rent in the city. The monthly rent allowance per adult in June 2019 being $1,500 HKD (US$190), and a food budget in the form of food vouchers of $40HKD a day. The centrally located Chungking Mansions is a popular living quarter for asylum seekers who find budget accommodation in the 15 floor residential block that is home also to foreign wholesale goods traders and backpackers. Outside of the city center, asylum seekers also live in the rural villages of Hong Kong where cheaper accommodation is found. In some reporting cases having to live in converted pig and chicken shacks. Cost and assistance The total cost of assistance to asylum seekers in the 2013‚Äì14 fiscal year was HK$450 million (about US$60 million). The government provides a $1,500HKD (US$190) a month rental subsidy, food and emergency medical care to asylum seekers who are not allowed to work while claims are considered. Food coupons worth $1200HKD are provided every month, although the remittances are tiny considering the extremely high cost of living in the city. Publicly funded legal representation is provided for asylum seekers that are unable to afford hiring a lawyer. Although with the very low acceptance rate of legal aid applications most asylum seekers are forced to represent themselves unless they can persuade the very over stretched legal organisations such as Justice Centre Hong Kong and lawyers willing to carry out pro-bono legal assistance. The high cost of supporting asylum seekers was a reason for a proposal by the Liberal Party in 2015 to withdraw visa free entry for Indians. After lobbying by \\"Indian diplomats and prominent businessmen\\", the proposal was not carried through. An electronic pre-arrival notification required for Indian nationals was implemented in January 2017 instead. Crime In the perception some sectors of the press and political spectrum, asylum seekers are associated with a high level of street crime. Although crime data is not provided from the police, and from what little data can be obtained from Freedom of Information requests shows no evidence of an increase in refugee led crime in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. Vision First, a refugee advocacy NGO, argues that criminal activity by asylum seekers is due to \\"Hong Kong‚Äôs botched asylum system\\" which provides \\"insufficient welfare assistance\\" and disallows working. An alleged rape in June 2013 by an asylum seeker sparked alarm in Hong Kong and subjected the handling of asylum seekers by the city government to widespread public scrutiny. A 26-year-old Indian asylum seeker living in Rhine Guesthouse, a hostel at Chungking Mansions, allegedly raped another guest, a woman from mainland China. Over the course of 2015, a series of arrests of 84 suspects busted a major drug ring operating in Hong Kong. Most of the suspects were described as mostly \\"African men, mainly from Gambia\\" who had sought asylum.

He was burnt at the stake on November 30, 1539 at the order of Bishop Don Juan de Zum√°rraga, the first Catholic bishop of New Spain, for continuing to practice the pre- Hispanic religion. The main source of information on Don Carlos is the record of his inquisition trial, published in 1910 by the Mexican archives.Luis Gonz√°lez Obreg√≥n. Proceso inquisitorial del cacique de Texcoco (1539). Mexico: Archivo General de la Naci√≥n, 1910. Juan de Zum√°rraga, the first archbishop of Mexico City, who investigated Don Carlos. There is no known image of Don Carlos himself. Oztoticpac Lands Map of Texcoco, part of a lawsuit to gain title to lands of Don Carlos after his execution Don Carlos was a grandson of the famous Texcocan ruler Nezahualcoyotl through his son Nezahualpilli. He held significant lands in the Texcoco region in the Aztec codex known as the Oztoticpac Lands Map of Texcoco, from ca. 1540 just after his execution. The pictorial on native paper (amatl) from Texcoco ca. 1540 is held by the manuscript division of the Library of Congress, measuring 76 x 84 cm. The contents are both pictorial and alphabetic text in Nahuatl in red and black ink. The glosses indicate it deals with lands that Texcocan lord Ixtlilxochitl I may have given to Don Carlos with litigation over the lands' ownership. The Oztoticpic Lands map was likely created between 1540 and 1544, as part of an effort to reclaim land held by Don Carlos. The map indicates a palace held by Don Carlos in Oztoticpac. In the schematic cadastrals of particular pieces of land, the map shows Nahua families who farmed the land as well as the measurements of the plots. A number of these properties were rented by tenants with standard glyphic representations of the rents. The names of the pieces of land are indicated with toponymic glyphs. The Oztoticpac Lands Map has been linked to another indigenous pictorial, the Humboldt Fragment VI held by the Berlin State Library. One of the most interesting and important features of the map is depictions of fruit trees, both European and local, many of them grafted. Pears, quince, apple, pomegranates, peaches, and grapevines are shown Income from the sale of fruit would have increased the value of the property. The importation of European fruit trees is part of the Columbian Exchange, but what is especially significant is that not just the trees were integrated into local horticulture, but the practice of grafting to increase the health and yield of the plants.Howard F.

Brinkman is an unincorporated community in Greer County, Oklahoma, United States. It lies at the western end of State Highway 34B, nine miles north of Mangum and one mile west of U.S. Route 283. History Brinkman was founded in 1910, and named after John Brinkman, who was a business associate of railroad builders Joseph A. Kemp and Frank Kell. A post office opened on June 17, 1910, and by 1925 the high school had over 450 students. It was a market town for the surrounding area and had two large elevators as well as other amenities. But the bank closed in 1927, and a fire destroyed half the town in 1929. Most of the buildings were never rebuilt. Oklahoma State Highway 34, constructed in 1931, bypassed the town to the east, accelerating the decline. The school closed in 1957.Lillie-Beth Brinkman, \\"Former Brinkman residents remember community with new monument: Brinkman marker to be dedicated in southwest Oklahoma on Saturday.\\" The Oklahoman, August 30, 2012 (pay site). On December 30, 1965 the post office closed. The school building had been removed and the school district consolidated into a still larger unit.

He was president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America from 1952 to 1972. He was nicknamed \\"Maurice the Silent\\" for his taciturn nature and ability to sit silently through long meetings or heated debates. He was born in Saginaw County, Michigan, to William Hutcheson and his wife Bessie Mae (King). He was educated in public schools. The Hutcheson family moved to Indianapolis, Indiana in 1913 when William Hutcheson was elected president of the Carpenters' union. The younger Hutcheson apprenticed as a carpenter in 1914 and served in the United States Navy in World War I. After the war, he returned to carpentry. He was appointed a financial auditor for the international union in 1928, and was elected an international vice president in 1938. After the death of his father, who was president of the Carpenters' union, he was elected president. Hutcheson immediately withdrew the Carpenters from the American Federation of Labor (AFL) when, shortly after his election, the AFL signed a no-raid agreement with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). However, he reaffiliated the union just three weeks later. He was elected a vice president of the AFL in 1953 and served on the federation's executive council. After the merger of the AFL and CIO in 1955, he was elected a vice president of the merged organization as well. In 1954, he signed a jurisdictional agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, ending a 40-year dispute. In 1957, he was cited for contempt of Congress for refusing to appear before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations led by Senator John L. McClellan and answer questions about labor racketeering. Hutcheson was convicted of contempt of Congress in May 1960 and sentenced to six months in prison. The conviction was upheld by the United States Supreme Court. A federal district court judge converted the sentence to two years of probation in 1964. Hutcheson was later pardoned by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Although he was critical of Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa for permitting his union to be dominated by organized crime, Hutcheson voted against the resolution ejecting the union sponsored by AFL-CIO president George Meany in 1957. The resolution passed over his objection. In 1958, Hutcheson and two Carpenters union officials were accused of bribing an Indiana state official to obtain advance notice of the nature and location of future highway projects. Law enforcement officials said Hutcheson and the others had made an $81,000 profit by buying the land on which a highway was to be built and then selling it to the state. All three men turned their profits over to the state and were convicted in 1960. The Indiana Supreme Court unanimously threw out the convictions in 1963, holding that there were no grounds for a conspiracy conviction. The conviction nearly led to Hutcheson's removal from the AFL-CIO's Executive Council, but Meany‚Äîwhom Hutcheson had strongly supported through the years‚Äîblocked the removal when Hutcheson threatened to pull his union from the federation. After his retirement, he lived in Milan, Indiana. Shortly before his death, he moved to Florida. Maurice Hutcheson died in Lakeland, Florida. Hutcheson's wife, the former Ethel Hyatt, died in 1977. The couple had no children. See also *List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the president of the United States References *Christie, Robert.

Kosovo lawyers and politicians have repeatedly called for amendments or a thorough revision of the constitution. Proposals include removing the prohibition of unification with Albania (art. 1.3), allowing direct elections for the president, and improving the language of the document. Alternative draft constitutions have also been proposed, before and after the declaration of independence. History =The constitution of 1974= Whilst within SR Serbia in Yugoslavia, the Constitution of 1974 had a purpose which stated that all ethnicities of Kosovo should unite under the national socialist revolution and the Communist party in its lead, against class warfare and further class inequality. The head of the Assembly was Iljaz Kurteshi and the constitution was signed on 27 February 1974. First constitution attempted by Kosovo was integrated in the constitution of SFRY of 27 February 1974. Five points below explain the main reasons for its existence and importance: # From 1944 onwards Kosovo's participation in the federal Yugoslavia was mostly like the other federal units. # Since 1944, and particularly under the 1974 SFRY constitution, Kosovo had a substantial degree of autonomy. In all areas, social economic and national policy. # Under the 1974 Constitution, the six republics along with Vojvodina and Kosovo had a similar constitutional position, the main difference was that the republics (Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Slovenia, Serbia, Montenegro and Slovenia) had the right to secede, Kosovo and Vojvodina did not. # Kosovo had the same protection that the republics had in disputes between Serbia and Kosovo including the Federal Constitutional court. This was removed in 1989‚Äì1990 and could not be re-established once the SFRY had disintegrated. # The position of Kosovo under the 1974 Constitution was cancelled in 1989‚Äì1990 by Serbia's federal authorities. =Second constitution, 1989‚Äì1990= After the speech that Slobodan Milosevic gave on 24 April 1987 and on 28 June 1989, the Gazimestan speech in front of a large number of ethnic Serbs at the main celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo. Some think that this speech helped Milo≈°evic consolidate his authority in Serbia.The Economist, 5 June 1999, US Edition, 1041 words, \\"What's next for Slobodan Milo≈°evic?\\" With the rise to power of nationalist movement in Serbia, the limitation of powers for Kosovo begin. In 1989 the Serbian assembly began passing amendments for restricting Kosovo's powers, guaranteed by the 1974 SFRY Constitution. It could propose such amendments but these required acceptance by the Kosovo Assembly before being adopted. On 23 March 1989 Kosovo Assembly accepted changes to its constitution, removing its autonomy. Representatives handpicked by Serbia approved changes to Kosovo's Constitution, starting the disintegration of the SFRY and the oppression and brutality in Kosovo. Kosovo Albanians responded with a non-violent separatist movement, employing widespread civil disobedience and creation of parallel structures in education, medical care, and taxation, with the ultimate goal of achieving the independence of Kosovo.Clark, Howard. Civil Resistance in Kosovo. London On 2 July 1990, the self-declared Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo a republic in Yugoslavia. On 7 September 1990 in the town of Ka√ßanik, 35 miles south of Prishtina and in an improvised session promulgated the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo. Witch confirmed the referendum and on 22 September 1991 declared Kosovo an independent country, the Republic of Kosovo.Historical Dictionary of Kosovo by Robert Elsie page 88 In May 1992, r. Ibrahim Rugova was elected president. During its run, the Republic of Kosovo was recognized only by Albania; it was formally disbanded in 2000, after the Kosovo War, when its institutions were replaced by the Joint Interim Administrative Structure established by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). The Constitution of Ka√ßanik 1990, was written to give Albanians freedom, fairness and wellbeing within Yugoslavia and stipulated that the people were the ones who select their wellbeing and futures. The head of the meeting on 7 September 1990 was Iljaz Ramajli.Kosovo: The Politics of Identity and Space =Influences=  UN Security Council Resolution 1244  Kosovo's constitutional status of the period June 1999 ‚Äì February 2008 was established by the United Nations in UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1244, adopted on 10 June 1999.Nato The Security Council placed Kosovo under the temporary administration of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), under the leadership of a Special Representative of the Secretary General. It also explicitly upheld the existing sovereignty of Serbia over Kosovo, \\"reaffirming the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other States of the region, as set out in the Helsinki Final Act and annex 2 [the Finnish-Russian proposals].\\" It also established a requirement that the post-conflict status process must take full account of \\"the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\\" The problem for either side was noted by Ylber Hysa: Although \\" \\"Resolution 1244 respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including Kosovo\\", and even provided for Serbian troops to be stationed in the province, on the ground \\"certain territories are under the full control of KFOR and the international administration\\" without any Serbian involvement (citat: Ylber Hysa, \\"Kosovo: a permanent international protectorate?\\", p. 288 in The UN Role in Promoting Democracy: Between Ideals and Reality, eds. Edward Newman, Roland Rich (United Nations University Press, 2004) ). However the part in question was never implemented. The severely circumscribed control exercised by Serbia in Kosovo has led some commentators to describe the nature of its sovereignty as purely \\"nominal\\". On 15 May 2001, UNMIK enacted a \\"Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government ( ciat : ) Although it provides a constitutional framework, it is not constitution, and is deliberately nonjudgmental on the question of sovereignty, as UNMIK itself does not have a role in the determination of Kosovo's final statusDaccessdds It defines Kosovo as \\"an entity under interim international administration\\" and \\"an undivided territory\\". Serbia's interference in Kosovo has caused significant problems. UNMIK was given exclusive rights to manage Kosovo's economic affairs and stated its intent in the Constitutional Framework to establish a market economy. Prior to 1999, much of Kosovo's economy had been controlled by the state. All publicly owned enterprises were owned by the Yugoslav government or the Serbian state, both governed from Belgrade. When UNMIK began implementing privatization of assets that it did not own, Serbs with interests in the companies subject to privatization sued first UNMIK and then the UN in New York. Swedish economist Jessica Johnson claims that the fact that Kosovo is still regarded in law as being part of Serbia, as well as the ongoing political tensions, has caused it significant difficulties in achieving economic development and that its uncertain legal status has prevented it from accessing lending from International Financial Institutions such as the World Bank. The establishment of the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) based on the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244 was primarily intended to preserve the territorial integrity of Kosovo and grant it \\"substantial autonomy\\" until a final status could be met. Albanian Kosovars viewed this mandate as a step towards an independent and sovereign Kosovo. In a secret meeting in Prizren in 2000, headed by the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (S.R.S.G.), Bernard Kouchner, there was an attempt to see if the 1999 Rambouillet Peace Accords document could be used as a model for constitution drafting, but this document essentially gave Serbia power to establish territorial and institutional \\"parallel structures\\" of government in Kosovo and also block decision-making processes in the central government in Kosovo. Kouchner realized that Rambouillet could not be the document that would establish a sustainable government scheme for Kosovo and Serbia, though the idea of using the peace accords as a foundation for the constitution would be an inspiration for the Ahtisaari Plan. Serbia's unwillingness to recognize Kosovo and the general lack of consensus in the international community as to whether Kosovo should be independent left Kosovo in a state of limbo after 1999, during its administration under UNMIK. To mitigate the economic and social problems that come from what was essentially a client state like Kosovo, the U.N. Security Council issued the Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement, otherwise known as the Ahtisaari Plan.Yris.Yira essay Ahtisaari plan Ahtisaari stated on 8 February 2007 that after a period of consultations with the parties he would finalize his Settlement proposal for submission to the UN Security Council and at that stage he would also elaborate on the status issue itself (citat: ^ \\"Ahtisaari press conference \\",). In Belgrade, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Ko≈°tunica refused to receive Ahtisaari. Ko≈°tunica claimed that because Serbia had still not formed a new government after the 21 January parliamentary elections he had no mandate to discuss Kosovo and therefore could not meet Ahtisaari. He later denounced the proposal as \\"illegitimate and unacceptable\\" because he alleged it \\"violates the U.N. Charter ... by undermining sovereignty of U.N. member Serbia (citat: ^ \\"Ahtisaari's proposal unacceptable and illegitimate for Serbia\\", Government of the Republic of Serbia website, Belgrade, 7 February 2007. ) President Boris Tadic did receive Ahtisaari, after which he reaffirmed his vow to never accept an independent Kosovo ( citat : ^ \\"U.N. envoy unveils Kosovo proposal, by Garentina Kraja, Associated Press (AP), Pristina, 2 February 2007). Foreign Minister Vuk Dra≈°kovic warned that it was \\"necessary to avoid an imposed solution that could cause Serbia to become a factor of instability. Citat: ^ \\"Serbian leaders warn UN plan for Kosovo could destabilize Balkans\\", International Herald Tribune, Belgrade, 7 February 2007. In Pristina, Kosovo Albanian leaders issued a statement after meeting with Ahtisaari saying they are \\"convinced that the international process for the resolution of Kosovo's status led by President Ahtisaari will be concluded soon with Kosovo becoming an independent state. Citat: ^ \\"Unity Team Press Statement,\\" 2 February 2007. ) The United States called the proposal \\"fair and balanced, citat: ^ Presentation of Kosovo Status Proposal to the Parties, Sean McCormack, U.S. Department of State spokesman, Washington, DC, 2 February 2007.) while the EU Presidency noted that Ahtisaari's proposals \\"build on almost twelve months of direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina. \\" citat: ^ EU Presidency Statement on the Kosovo status proposals to be presented today by Martti Ahtisaari in Belgrade and Pristina, 2 February 2007. On 21 February, Ahtisaari began a period of consultations with the parties in Vienna to finalize the Settlement. He made clear that his proposal was a draft and that he would incorporate compromise solutions into the final document. After this period of consultations and further modification of the Settlement, Ahtisaari convened a high-level meeting of the parties in Vienna on 10 March. After this meeting, leaders from both sides signaled a total unwillingness to compromise on their central demands (Kosovo Albanians for Kosovo's independence; Serbia for continued sovereignty over Kosovo). Concluding that there was no chance for the two sides to reconcile their positions, Ahtisaari said he intended to submit to the UN Security Council his proposed status recommendations, including an explicit recommendation for the status outcome itself, by the end of March. In November 2008, the EU accepted the demand of Serbia not to implement the plan of Ahtisaari through EULEX. =Declaration of Independence= The Republic of Kosovo declared independence on 17 February 2008. The participants unanimously declared Kosovo to be independent from Serbia,BBC while all 11 representatives of the Serb minority boycotted the proceedings. The legality of the declaration, and whether it was an act of the Assembly has been disputed. Serbia sought international validation for its stance that the declaration was illegal, and in October 2008 requested a judgement from the International Court of Justice.News BBC However, the Court ruled that the declaration was legal.Guardian: Kosovo's independence is legal, UN court rules The 2008 declaration was a result of the Ahtisaari plan negotiations that broke down in the fall of 2007. The plan, prepared by the UN Special Envoy and former President of Finland, Martti Ahtisaari, hoped that a supervised independence by the European Union (without expressly using the word \\"independence\\") would show that the polarized interests in Kosovo could sustain self-governance with a constitution and a representative government that was obligated to expressly protect its minorities' rights. Kosovo would be accorded its own national symbols such as a flag and a coat of arms, and be obligated to carry out border demarcation on the Kosovo-Republic of Macedonia border. The Albanian negotiators essentially in whole supported the Ahtisaari plan, the latter that also gained the support of the European Union and of the United States. However, Serbia and Russia rejected it outright, and continued United Nations intersession was fruitless. Negotiations stopped. The Kosovars unilaterally proclaimed the Republic of Kosovo, and obligating themselves to follow the Ahtisaari plan's provisions in full. Border demarcation talks with Macedonia were delayed because the Kosovars insisted on the pre-condition of official recognition but eventually withdrew the opposition. The 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence elicited mixed international reaction and was domestically continuously polarizing between the Kosovo Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians. After 13 years of international oversight, Kosovo's authorities formally obtained full unsupervised control of the region (less only North Kosovo) on 10 September 2012 when Western Powers terminated their oversight. The International Steering Group, in its final meeting with the authorities in Pristina, declared that the Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement, known as the Ahtisaari plan after its Finnish UN creator, had been substantially implemented. =Drafting the Constitution= When the time came for resolution of the process, United Nations Secretary Gereral Kofi Annan appointed Martti Ahtisaari to lead the Kosovo status process in November 2005.UN In a period of fourteen months Ahtisaari held seventeen rounds of negotiations between Serbian and Kosovar officials in Vienna and made twenty- six expert missions to both capitals. These discussions had a great support of the Contact Group, which included the United States, the UK, France, Germany and Italy as well as Russia.Crisis group On 2 February 2007, the final report was released which included the \\"Ten guiding principles\\", which created a structure and authorities for the broad governing of Kosovo and its government.[The Road to Independence for Kosovo By Henry H. Perritt, Jr. ‚Äì page 119 to 120] The report contained a broad provision for Kosovo's autonomy which included the power to enter into international agreements as well as to become a member of international organizations but the report also constrains Kosovo's sovereignty because of the power sharing arrangements with the minority groups that international missions had the power to enforce. The only contact group state that refused the proposal was Russia, stating that the Serbian part of the agreement was not held.[The Road to Independence for Kosovo By Henry H. Perritt, Jr. ‚Äì page 160 to 161] Because of Russia's rejection of the plan, a \\"Troika\\" from German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier of representatives from the United States, European Union, and Russia held additional negotiations to reach an agreement. However, the parties were not able to reach an agreement on the final status of Kosovo.DW[The Road to Independence for Kosovo By Henry H. Perritt, Jr. ‚Äì page 191 to 211] Despite the stalemate inside the international consensus, Kosovo declared independence on 17 February 2008 and the Assembly adopted a declaration of independence in accordance with the Special Envoy of the U.N.

The Kosovo Assembly approved a new constitution in April 2008 and it went into effect on 15 June 2008.Kosovo Declaration of Independence Although Kosovo declared independence in February, the U.N. did not approve the plan of the Special Envoy, Ahtisaari; the Constitutional Commission began to draft the Constitution as early as March 2007. The commission was to be composed of 21 Kosovo members, 15 appointed by the President of Kosovo, 3 by the Assembly holding seats reserved for minorities especially Serbs, and 3 members of other minority communities also appointed by the Assembly.kushtetuta e Kosoves First the sub-groups of the Commission published the drafted segments of the Constitution in late summer of 2007. Then the entire Commission submitted drafts for the reviewing process, internal and international advisors did the review. By the end of 2007, the Commission produced a draft constitution, directly derived from the Ahtisaari plan.Ahtisaari PlanKushtetuta e Kosoves After the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution was published for public comment, with more than 1000 comments from the public and the Commission holding public hearings for gathering more suggestions the final draft was created. The final draft was completed in April 2008 and the ratification process then went into force on 15 June 2008. The new Constitution created a parliamentary republic with pledges to protect minorities.

Most commonly, a minority is considered a non-dominant group with an identity distinct from that of the majority population in a country. 'Minority rights' refer to group specific rights, in addition to general human rights and civil and political liberties, that any individual member of the minority can choose to enjoy. 'Minority protection' refers to the overall situational and policy framework in which these minority rights are embedded. Notably, minority protection will only be effective when both majority and minority groups have incentives to adhere to the established institutions and rights. The people belonging to communities in the Republic of Kosovo are entitled to have individually or jointly with others the fundamental human rights and freedoms established in international legal obligations building upon the Republic of Kosovo. These rights and freedoms are guaranteed by the constitution, other laws, regulations and other state policies. For the protection and promotion of the rights of communities and their members in the Republic of Kosovo, the Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo ratified the Law on Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Communities and their Members in the Republic of Kosovo. Members of the community in the majority in the Republic of Kosovo, who as a whole are not in the majority in a given municipality, are also entitled to have the rights listed in this law. The authorities in the republic of Kosovo, including the courts, interpret this law in accordance with the guarantees of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rights of communities and their members established in the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo with applicable international human rights obligations including the provision of the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. Communities and their members have the right to freely maintain, express, develop their culture and identity, and to preserve and enhance the essential elements of their identity, namely their religion, language, traditions and cultural heritage. In addition to the specific rights enumerated in this law, fundamental human rights shall be exercised freely and equally, including freedom of thought, of expression, of the media, of association and assembly, of religious belief and practice, and the right to manifest in private or in public, individually or in community with the others, the cultural attributes of the respective community. The Republic of Kosovo shall create appropriate conditions that enable communities and their members to freely maintain, express and develop their identities. According to this law, Albanian and Serbian languages and their alphabets are official languages of the Republic of Kosovo and have equal status in its institutions. The Turkish, Bosnian and Roma languages have the status of official languages at the municipal level or will be in official use in accordance with the Law on the Use of Languages. Persons belonging to communities have the right to use freely and without interference the language of their community in private and in public, orally and in writing.

[Constitution ofKosovo, chapterIII] Kosovo's declaration of independence has brought opportunities, and potential risks for the protection of minority rights and the rights of smaller minorities in Kosovo. As exercisers of executive power in newly independent Kosovo, the EU and the international community can help to facilitate the effective participation of minority communities in Kosovo, while also ensuring the guarantee of minority rights.[ Filling the vacuum: Ensuring Protection and Legal Remedies for Minorities in Kosovo(2009) ] The Constitution of Kosovo gives additional rights and protections to communities and their members in Kosovo.

The first goal was to draft a document that would be broadly acceptable to the people of Kosovo‚Äîa document that not only \\"belonged\\" to Kosovo, but also was acceptable and impressive to the rest of the world. The second goal was to provide a constitution that would help ensure broad international acceptance of the new country and quick recognition of Kosovo's independence‚Äù.

Their main application is in the medical device and pharmaceutical industry. In vivo, polyanhydrides degrade into non-toxic diacid monomers that can be metabolized and eliminated from the body. Owing to their safe degradation products, polyanhydrides are considered to be biocompatible.  Applications  The characteristic anhydride bonds in polyanhydrides are water-labile (the polymer chain breaks apart at the anhydride bond). This results in two carboxylic acid groups which are easily metabolized and biocompatible. Biodegradable polymers, such as polyanhydrides, are capable of releasing physically entrapped or encapsulated drugs by well-defined kinetics and are a growing area of medical research. Polyanhydrides have been investigated as an important material for the short-term release of drugs or bioactive agents. The rapid degradation and limited mechanical properties of polyanhydrides render them ideal as controlled drug delivery devices. One example, Gliadel, is a device in clinical use for the treatment of brain cancer. This product is made of a polyanhydride wafer containing a chemotherapeutic agent. After removal of a cancerous brain tumor, the wafer is inserted into the brain releasing a chemotherapy agent at a controlled rate proportional to the degradation rate of the polymer. The localized treatment of chemotherapy protects the immune system from high levels of radiation. Other applications of polyanhydrides include the use of unsaturated polyanhydrides in bone replacement, as well as polyanhydride copolymers as vehicles for vaccine delivery.  Classes  The structure of a polyanhydride molecule with n repeating units. There are three main classes of polyanhydrides: aliphatic, unsaturated, and aromatic. These classes are determined by examining their R groups (the chemistry of the molecule between the anhydride bonds). Aliphatic polyanhydrides consist of R groups containing carbon atoms bonded in straight or branched chains. This class of polymers is characterized by a crystalline structure, melting temperature range of 50‚Äì90 ¬∞C, and solubility in chlorinated hydrocarbons. They degrade and are eliminated from the body within weeks of being introduced to the bodily environment. Unsaturated polyanhydrides consist of organic R groups with one or more double bonds (or degrees of unsaturation). This class of polymers has a highly crystalline structure and is insoluble in common organic solvents. Aromatic polyanhydrides consist of R groups containing a benzene (aromatic) ring. Properties of this class include a crystalline structure, insolubility in common organic solvents, and melting points greater than 100 ¬∞C. They are very hydrophobic and therefore degrade slowly when in the bodily environment. This slow degradation rate makes aromatic polyanhydrides less suitable for drug delivery when used as homopolymers, but they can be copolymerized with the aliphatic class to achieve the desired degradation rate. Synthesis and characterization Polyanhydrides are synthesized using either melt condensation or solution polymerization. Depending on the synthesis method used, various characteristics of polyanhydrides can be altered to achieve the desired product. Characterization of polyanhydrides determines the structure, composition, molecular weight, and thermal properties of the molecule. These properties are determined by using various light-scattering and size-exclusion methods. =Polymerization= Polyanhydrides can be easily prepared by using available, low cost resources. The process can be varied to achieve desirable characteristics. Traditionally, polyanhydrides have been prepared by melt condensation polymerization, which results in high molecular weight polymers. Melt condensation polymerization involves reacting dicarboxylic acid monomers with excess acetic anhydride at a high temperature and under a vacuum to form the polymers. Catalysts may be used to achieve higher molecular weights and shorter reaction times. Generally, a one-step synthesis (method involving only one reaction) is used which does not require purification. There are many other methods used to synthesize polyanhydrides. Some of the other methods include: microwave heating, high-throughput synthesis (synthesis of polymers in parallel), ring opening polymerization (removal of cyclic monomers), interfacial condensation (high temperature reaction of two monomers), dehydrative coupling agents (removing the water group from two carboxyl groups), and solution polymerization (reacting in a solution). =Chemical structure and composition analysis= The chemical structure and composition of polyanhydrides can be determined by H1NMR spectroscopy. This will determine the class of polanhydride (aromatic, aliphatic, or unsaturated) as well as the structural features of the polymer. For example, the analysis of nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) peaks allows one to determine if a copolymer has a random or block-like structure. Molecular weight and degradation rate can also determined by NMR. =Molecular weight analysis= Aside from using NMR to determine a polyanhydride‚Äôs molecular weight, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and viscosity measurements may also be used. =Thermal properties= Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is used to determine the thermal properties of polyanhydrides. Glass transition temperature, melting temperature, and heat of fusion can all be determined by DSC. Crystallinity of a polyanhydride can be determined using DSC, Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and X-ray diffraction. Degradation Comparison of bulk and surface erosion mechanisms. The erosion and degradation of a polymer describe how the polymer physically loses mass (degrades). The two common erosion mechanisms are surface and bulk erosion. Polyanhydrides are surface eroding polymers. Surface eroding polymers do not allow water to penetrate into the material. They erode layer by layer, like a lollipop. The hydrophobic backbone with hydrolytically labile anhydride linkages allows hydrolytic degradation to be controlled by manipulating the polymer composition. This manipulation can occur by adding a hydrophilic group to the polyanhydride to make a copolymer. Polyanhydride copolymers with hydrophilic groups exhibit bulk eroding characteristics. Bulk eroding polymers take in water like a sponge (throughout the material) and erode inside and on the surface of the polymer. Drug release from bulk eroding polymers is difficult to characterize because the primary mode of release from these polymers is diffusion. Unlike surface eroding polymers, bulk eroding polymers show a very weak relationship between the rate of polymer degradation and the rate of drug release. Therefore, the development of surface eroding polyanhydrides incorporated into the bulk eroding polymers is of increased importance. Biocompatibility Biocompatibility and toxicity of a polymeric material is evaluated by examining systemic toxic responses, local tissue responses, carcinogenic and mutagenic responses, and allergic responses to the material's degradation products. Animal studies are conducted to test the polymer‚Äôs effect on each of these negative responses. Polyanhydrides and their degradation products have not been found to cause significant harmful responses and are considered to be biocompatible.

A friend of Charlemagne, in 791 Hildebold was made the archchaplain and chancellor of the Imperial Council. At the request of Charlemagne, Pope Adrian I released Hildebold from the traditional episcopal requirement of residing in one's see. In 795, the pope raised Cologne to archiepiscopal status. The dioceses of Utrecht, Li√®ge, M√ºnster, Minden, Osnabr√ºck, and Bremen were made suffragan. Hildebold began the construction of an extension of Cologne Cathedral that was only completed in 870, which in later times was called the Hildebold Cathedral. In 805, he met the first bishop of M√ºnster, St Ludgar. Hildebold was the first witness to Charlemagne's testament of 811. Together with Richulf, he presided over the Synod of Mainz in 813 at St. Alban's Abbey, Mainz, and in the same year he prepared Louis the Pious to succeed his father. When Charlemagne died in 814, Hildebold donated to the construction of his tomb in Aachen. With Pope Stephen IV, he prepared the coronation of Louis in Reims. Hildebold died on 3 September 818 and was buried in the Abbey of St Geron. The friendship of Charlemagne and Hildebold has become something of a legend. It is said that they first met when Charlemagne was hunting in the forests outside Cologne. After a long day hunting and in need of a rest, Charlemagne stopped at a small chapel. After a while the chapel filled with worshippers and Hildebold gave his sermon. Charlemagne was so impressed by Hildebold's sermon that he offered a sum of gold to his chapel. Believing Charlemagne was only a hunter and not the king, Hildebold rejected the offer and asked only for a small piece of leather from the next deer killed so he could bind his old prayer book. Charlemagne was so impressed by this modesty that he immediately fostered a friendship with the cleric.

A gunman identified as Sulejman Taloviƒá killed five bystanders and wounded four others before being shot dead by several members of the Salt Lake City Police Department. Authorities were not able to determine a motive. Events =Shooting= On February 12, 2007, at 6:42 p.m. MST, Taloviƒá arrived at the Trolley Square Mall, parking his vehicle in the upper level of the mall's west parking garage. He was wearing a white shirt, a tan trench coat, and was carrying a 6-shot 12-gauge pump-action shotgun w/ a pistol grip, a 38-caliber handgun, and a backpack full of extra ammunition during the shooting. Two minutes after exiting his vehicle, Taloviƒá encountered 52-year-old Jeffrey Walker and his 16-year-old son Alan in the parking garage. He shot and wounded both in the head with his shotgun; Alan Walker managed to run down a staircase to the lower parking level, where he was assisted by other citizens. However, Taloviƒá stood over Jeffrey Walker, who had fallen to the ground after being shot, and shot him repeatedly in the head and back, killing him. Continuing onward to the west entrance of the mall, Taloviƒá shot 34-year-old Shaun Munns twice with the shotgun from approximately 30 yards away. Munns managed to flee the scene and survive his injuries. Taloviƒá then fired twice at the entrance doors, causing shoppers inside the store to hide or flee. Entering the mall, he approached the west stairs, where he fired at a security guard, missing, then walked down the main level hallway in the opposite direction. There, he shot 29-year-old Vanessa Quinn in the chest with his revolver; when she fell to the ground, Taloviƒá stood over her and killed her with a second gunshot to the head. Taloviƒá then entered Cabin Fever, a card store where seven people were hiding. He first approached 44-year-old Carolyn Tuft, who was crouched down near a display table at the front of the store, and shot her in the left side and arm with the shotgun, causing her to fall over to the ground. He then spotted 53-year-old Stacy Hanson crouching near the southeast glass wall of the store. Hanson said to him \\"Everyone just wants to go home,\\" to which Taloviƒá told him to \\"Shut up!\\" before shooting and injuring him in the lower abdomen and arm with the shotgun, also shattering the glass wall; Hanson fell face-down into the glass. Taloviƒá then approached a group of three people: 15-year-old Kirsten Hinckley (whose mother was the injured Carolyn Tuft), 24-year-old Brad Frantz, and 29-year-old Teresa Ellis. All three victims were lying on the floor in the southern front of the store. Taloviƒá fired from his shotgun, hitting all three people. Frantz died of a gunshot wound to the forehead, while Hinckley suffered a wound to the torso and Ellis suffered wounds to the right arm, torso, and leg. He then left the store briefly to reload, during which Carolyn Tuft crawled towards her injured daughter. Taloviƒá returned, shooting Tuft, Hinckley, and Ellis again; Hinckley and Ellis both died of gunshot wounds to the head, while Tuft survived a wound to the back. =Police response= Leaving Cabin Fever a second time, Taloviƒá encountered off-duty police officer Kenneth Hammond of the Ogden City Police Department. At the time, Hammond was at Trolley Square on an early Valentine's Day dinner with his pregnant wife, 911 dispatcher Sarita Hammond, when they heard gunshots. Sarita Hammond borrowed a waiter's cell phone to call 911. Drawing his weapon, Hammond identified himself as a police officer, and Taloviƒá fired twice at him with his shotgun, missing. Moving around the central hallway area, Taloviƒá focused his gunfire at three restaurant employees, firing from near the south entrance of the Pottery Barn Kids home- furnishing store. Witnessing him returning to Cabin Fever and shooting Stacy Hanson in the back, an employee, Barrett Dodds, yelled at Taloviƒá, prompting him to walk back towards Pottery Barn. Hanson survived his injuries. Meanwhile, Sergeant Andrew Oblad of the Salt Lake City Police Department entered Trolley Square through the south entrance and encountered Kenneth Hammond. Taloviƒá fired at both officers, and Hammond fired back in return. An active shooter contact team composed of Salt Lake City PD SWAT team members Sergeant Joshua Scharman, Detective Dustin Marshall, Detective Brett Olsen, and Officer Gordon Worsencroft eventually arrived and confronted Taloviƒá from behind. Scharman and Olsen shot him a total of eight times in the back with their Heckler & Koch MP5 service weapons, and Marshall also shot him five times with his AR-15 service rifle. When Taloviƒá turned around and aimed his shotgun towards the team, Scharman and Olsen fired again and killed him. Taloviƒá's body was later found to have been struck a total of 15 times by bullets fired by police. At least 30 rounds were fired by Taloviƒá, 29 of which came from his shotgun and at least one from his revolver. The entire shooting lasted for six minutes. According to local TV station KTVX, several witnesses reported that most of the shooting took place on the ground floor near the Pottery Barn store, though the majority of the dead and injured were found in Cabin Fever. One of the victims, having been shot, apparently entered the nearby Hard Rock Cafe and told customers to lock the doors. The wounded victims were transported to local hospitals, some in critical condition. =Victims= Killed * Jeffrey Walker, 53 (shot at the west parking garage) * Vanessa Quinn, 29 (shot at the main level hallway) * Brad Frantz, 24 (shot inside Cabin Fever) * Kirsten Hinckley, 15 (shot inside Cabin Fever) * Teresa Ellis, 29 (shot inside Cabin Fever) Injured * Alan \\"A.J.\\" Walker, 16 (son of Jeffrey Walker, shot at the west parking garage) * Shawn Munns, 34 (shot near the west entrance) * Carolyn Tuft, 43 (mother of Kirsten Hinckley, shot inside Cabin Fever) * Stacy Hanson, 53 (shot inside Cabin Fever) Shooter Sulejman Taloviƒá (October 6, 1988 ‚Äì February 12, 2007) was identified as the perpetrator of the shooting. He was born in Cerska, a town in the Vlasenica municipality of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and later migrated with his family to the United States in 1998. Taloviƒá was a permanent resident who received a green card in 2005 and lived with his mother, father and three sisters in Salt Lake City at the time of the shooting. As a child, Talovic frequently spent time at the mall and it was described as \\"the only place he went.\\" The family at one point lived one block away. He had a record of minor juvenile incidents and had dropped out of high school at age 16. After the shooting, Taloviƒá was buried in his birthplace, the small village of Taloviƒái near Cerska, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on March 2, 2007. Sulejman's father Suljo Taloviƒá soon moved back to Bosnia and told media outlets that he was too sad and ashamed to stay living in a country where his son committed mass murder. =Motive= Taloviƒá's aunt Ajka Omeroviƒá emerged briefly from the family's house to say relatives had no idea why he attacked so many strangers. She said that Taloviƒá had lived in Sarajevo as a child, and that his family moved to Utah from Bosnia. \\"He was such a good boy. I don't know what happened,\\" she told Salt Lake City television station KSL-TV. In another KSL interview, with Omeroviƒá, and Taloviƒá's father, Suljo Taloviƒá, the two indicated concern that some outside influence might have induced Sulejman to commit the killings. \\"I think this [Sulejman] did. I think somebody (is) behind him, I think, but I am not sure....\\" The father suggested that the U.S. government bears some responsibility for his son's actions, saying \\"The authorities are guilty for not alerting us that he bought a gun. In the U.S., you cannot buy cigarettes if you are under-aged, but you can buy a gun.\\" Federal law prohibits the sale of handguns and handgun ammunition to those under 21 from federally licensed gun dealers although some states allow 18+ to purchase handguns through legal private sales. Long guns (being a rifle or shotgun) and rifle/shotgun ammunition are prohibited to those under 18.Gun laws in the US Taloviƒá had bought the guns in a pawn shop. In the light of the War on Terrorism some commentators, including John Gibson and U.S. Representative Chris Cannon suggested that Taloviƒá repeatedly shouted \\"Allahu Akbar\\" prior to his death, suggesting a religious motive, citing video of the rampage which supposedly captures Taloviƒá's religious shouting.Burbank Says Evidence Does Not Support 'Personal Jihad' in Mall Shooting\\" , KCPW-FM, Feb. 22, 2007. For the video, see amateur video clip recording of the mall shooting After being told that police investigators had not uncovered any evidence to support his claims, Cannon's spokesman said the congressman accepts that Taloviƒá did not yell anything of a religious nature. FBI agent Patrick Kiernan stated that he had no reason to suspect terrorism. Ajka Omeroviƒá was quoted as saying, \\"We are Muslims, but we are not terrorists.\\" Officers honored Five officers were honored at the Utah state capitol on February 16 for their bravery in the Trolley Square shooting. They are Sergeant Andrew Oblad, Sergeant Joshua Scharman, Detective Dustin Marshall, and Detective Brett Olsen, all of the Salt Lake City Police Department; and Officer Kenneth Hammond of the Ogden Police Department. On February 13, 2007, Salt Lake City police officials thanked Hammond as a hero for saving countless lives.

This earned him a certain popularity among the French- speaking African youth, who considered him as a defender of African sovereignty. Originally close to the Nation of Islam, he eventually joined Voodoo in 2014, which he links to the work of the metaphysician Ren√© Gu√©non about the perennialism as he explains in his latest book Free Africa or death. He is the initiator of the demonstrations against the CFA franc who took in several French-speaking African countries. In January 2018 , he was elected as 2017 African Personality of the Year by Africanews, for his fight against French neocolonialism and the CFA Franc in Africa. In December 2019, while accusing France of being partly responsible for terrorism in the Sahel, K√©mi S√©ba placed himself at the disposal of the regional armies, in order to fight against the jihadists. He therefore proposed to the presidents of the G5 Sahel the creation of a group of \\"Pan-African civilian volunteers\\".

He was president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America from 1973 to 1979. He was born in Chicago to Samuel and Fannie (Freeman) Sidell. His father was a cabinetmaker. The family moved to Los Angeles, California, where Sidell graduated from public high school. He apprenticed as a carpenter, and in 1939 joined the local in Los Angeles. He married his wife, Frankie, in 1936 and the couple had three children. In 1948, he was elected business manager of Local 721 in Los Angeles, and in 1957 secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles District Council of Carpenters. He served as a trustee for the Carpenters Health and Welfare Fund for Southern California, and as a pension trustee for the Carpenters Pension Trust for Southern California. In 1963, he was elected a vice president of the Carpenters union and served on the general executive board. In 1964, he was elected second vice president, and moved to first vice president in 1969. After the retirement of president Maurice Hutcheson in 1972, he was elected president as his successor. The same year, he was elected a vice president of the AFL-CIO, and served on the executive committee of the Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO and chaired the AFL-CIO Committee on Housing (a group which lobbied Congress on housing policy). President Gerald Ford appointed him to the President's Collective Bargaining Committee in Construction, but resigned in 1976 when Ford unexpectedly vetoed a common situs picketing bill. He was considered a successor to AFL-CIO president George Meany. But when Meany hand-picked his assistant, Lane Kirkland, as his successor, Sidell and other contenders for the presidency withdrew. Post- retirement After his retirement, President Jimmy Carter appointed Sidell to the Panama Canal Commission Supervisory Board in 1980. In 1976, Sidell agreed to serve on a new AFL-CIO board which would settle jurisdictional disputes arising between affiliates. References *Bernstein, Harry.

This gene is a member of the lectican (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan) family. The encoded protein is an integral part of the extracellular matrix in cartilagenous tissue and it withstands compression in cartilage. Aggrecan is a proteoglycan, or a protein modified with large carbohydrates; the human form of the protein is 2316 amino acids long and can be expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing.  Structure  Aggrecan is a high molecular weight (1x106 < M < 3x106) proteoglycan. It exhibits a bottlebrush structure, in which chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are attached to an extended protein core. Aggrecan has a molecular mass >2,500 kDa. The core protein (~300 kDa) has around 100 GAG chains attached to it. Aggrecan consists of two globular structural domains (G1 and G2) at the N-terminal end and one globular domain (G3) at the C-terminal end, separated by a large extended domain (CS) heavily modified with GAGs. (N-G1-G2-CS-G3-C) The two main modifier moieties are themselves arranged into distinct regions, a chondroitin sulfate and a keratan sulfate region. The three globular domains, G1, G2, and G3 are involved in aggregation, hyaluronan binding, cell adhesion, and chondrocyte apoptosis. Along with type-II collagen, aggrecan forms a major structural component of cartilage, particularly articular cartilage. The aggrecan family includes other important members such as versican, also named PG-M, neurocan, brevican and the cell surface HA receptor CD44. They are modular proteoglycans containing combinations of structural motifs, such as EGF-like domains, carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD), complement binding protein (CBP)-like domains, immunoglobulin folds and proteoglycan tandem repeats.  Function  Aggrecan is a critical component for cartilage structure and the function of joints. Functionally, the G1 domain interacts with hyaluronic acid and link protein, forming stable ternary complexes in the extracellular matrix. G2 is homologous to the tandem repeats of G1 and of link protein and is involved in product processing. G3 makes up the carboxyl terminus of the core protein. It enhances glycosaminoglycan modification and product secretion. Aggrecan plays an important role in mediating chondrocyte-chondrocyte and chondrocyte-matrix interactions through its ability to bind hyaluronan. Aggrecan provides intervertebral disc and cartilage with the ability to resist compressive loads. The localized high concentrations of aggrecan provide the osmotic properties necessary for normal tissue function with the GAGs producing the swelling pressure that counters compressive loads on the tissue. This functional ability is dependent on a high GAG/aggrecan concentration being present in the tissue extracellular matrix. In the disc, aggrecan concentrations peak in a person's twenties, and decline thereafter, with aggrecan degradation products slowly accumulating over the following decades. This causes discs to get stiffer and less resilient with age. Aggrecan also plays an important role in the organization of the extracellular spaces between neurons in the brain. Through interactions with link protein and tenascins, aggrecan binds to hyaluronan, forming large aggregated complexes at the cell surface.  Clinical significance  The synthesis and degradation of aggrecan are being investigated for their roles in cartilage deterioration during joint injury, disease, and aging. The linker domain between the N-terminal globular domains, called the interglobular domain, is highly sensitive to proteolysis. Such degradation has been associated with the development of arthritis. Proteases capable of degrading aggrecans are called aggrecanases, and they are members of the ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease) protein family. Degenerative joint disease is a leading source of morbidity resulting in significant social and economic impact. Osteoarthritis is characterized by the slow progressive deterioration of articular cartilage and fibrosis of the synovium and joint capsule. Articular cartilage contains up to 10% proteoglycan by weight, most of which is aggrecan, and its loss is an early sign of the disease.

This species is native to Atlantic forest of eastern Brazil. Taxonomy All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) Formerly, this bird was divided into two subspecies: T. s. pernambucensis in north-east Brazil (Pernambuco and Alagoas), and T. s. solitarius found in south-east Paraguay and extreme north- east Argentina. The former, however, turned out to be not distinct from the nominate but rather individual birds that showed a particular color morph which is now known to also occur elsewhere.Raposo do Amaral & Silveira (2004) Notably, the hue of the back varies between olive and rusty, and the intensity of the lower neck's plumage color also varies. The black barring in these areas is more or less strong. pernambucensis refers to yellower birds with much barring, especially on the neck. Illustration by Joseph Smit, 1895 Solitary tinamou eggs in nest Tinamus solitarius - MHNT Description The solitary tinamou is a large brownish tinamou heavily barred with black. Its neck, breast, and flanks are grey, and its belly is white. It has a dark brown crown and a white throat on its yellowish head and neck, which contrasts with a distinctive buff line on the side of the neck. It averages in length.Harrison, C. (1993) Range It is found in southeastern Bahia, eastern Minas Gerais, Esp√≠rito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo, eastern Mato Grosso do Sul, Paran√°, Santa Catarina, and northern Rio Grande do Sul states. It is also found in southeastern Paraguay and extreme north-east Argentina in Misiones province.BirdLife International (2009)Clements, J (2007) Behavior Like other tinamous, it lays oddly-shaped eggs with a glossy, colorful shell,Cabot (1992) and it eats fruits, and seeds off the ground or low plants. Males will incubate the eggs which are in a nest on the ground, and will also rear the young for the short period of time before they are independent. Ecology The solitary tinamou is found in lowland humid tropical forest and montane forests up to ASL. It readily inhabits secondary forest and can be not uncommon in extensively used plots, tolerating selective logging to some degree. Large plantations of exotic species are not well-liked. But the birds can be plentiful enough to withstand some hunting for example in a mosaic of cabruca smallholder plantings, interspersed with secondary growth with dense caet√© Marantaceae and Merostachys bamboo understorey as well as higher Guadua bamboo and full-grown heart-of-palm trees (Euterpe edulis). In little- disturbed Dense Ombrophyllous Montane Forest ecotone, thriving populations may exist in forest fragments as small as 1,000 acres (400 ha).Simon (2000), Silveira et al. (2005) Conservation It is currently threatened by the ongoing deforestation caused by urbanisation, industrialisation, agricultural expansion, and associated road-building. It is also hunted excessively. Consequently, the IUCN classifies it as a Near Threatened species, it may soon become vulnerable with a range occurrence of .BirdLife International (2008) The population formerly believed to be referred to by pernambucensis is either very rare or already extirpated. These northern birds have always been fairly rare in historical times, with possibly not more than 6 specimens in museums.Cabot (1992), Raposo do Amaral & Silveira (2004), BLI (2008) It has been noted that this species is not hard to introduce to suitable habitat. Solitary tinamous were found to persist in numbers in a forest fragment of where they were not originally found.Faria et al. (2006) It is not considered globally threatened by the IUCN.

Based in Rangoon, the company was owned by Mr Major Parrot, a British man. But the company was not started as a film company. It started as a taxi company. The Parrot Taxi Company The Parrot Taxi Company imported Morris and Austin cars from Great Britain in the early 1920s. The company's boss, Mr Parrot met with a young Burmese clerk working in a gambling company when he went to horse racing course to gamble. The young man was U Sunny. He was a sociable, friendly and hard-working clerk who was also very fluent in English. The two became friends later. Mr Parrot told U Sunny to quit his job and offered him a job as a clerk in his taxi company. Later, U Sunny was promoted to managing director by Mr Parrot. Under his management, the company became more prosperous. The taxis increased from about ten to thirty-five and U Sunny was also able to establish a taxi gate near the Strand Hotel. The Great Depression and the Transformation By the start of the 1930s, the company was facing severe financial problems caused by the Great Depression which hit Burmese farmers and merchants particularly hard, while the British companies continued to buy rice at low prices. Later, there were riots in Rangoon University together with unrest among farmers and workers. Mr Parrot saw the writing on the wall and decided to retire and return home to England. Before leaving, he sold the company to U Sunny at half its value. U Sunny worked hard to keep the taxi company going during the depression and stave off bankruptcy. One day, however, U Sunny was inspired by the sight of crowds of people pouring out of a cinema and decided to turn his taxi company into a film company. U Ba Thar, his mechanic, agreed to be his company director. Movies of the Parrot Film Company The first film \\"Thirty-Six Animals\\" became a major hit. It was based on how Burmese suffered from gambling thirty-six animals. Thirty-six animals was one of the earliest gambling system in Burma of the 20th Century.It was played using thirty-six animals which included a tiger,a horse,a mouse and an elephant. The second film \\"Our Peacock Flag\\" was also a hit and it was based on politics. It encouraged Burmese revolutionists and so it was censored. The third film was \\"The Golden Peacock Coin\\" which also encouraged Burmese nationals to use Burmese peacock coins from the Thibaw Min's reign again despite the present use of the British coins. The seventh film \\"Our King and Our Queen and Our Buddha\\" was also censored. It starred Maung Maung Aye and Khin Khin May as Thibaw Min and Queen Supayalat and again encouraged Burmese people to fight against the British.It also showed that Buddhism was starting to fade under the British rule. The Film Censorship Board of Burma passed the film first but later stopped the film from showing due to its controversial story. The company produced and directed about 58 films. The 22nd film,\\"Teacher\\" starring Ba Chit and Tin May Kalay was also a major hit. U Sunny gave away free books by Mawbi Hsaya Thein and P Moe Nin to people who came and watched his film. Later years of the company U Sunny became a rich man. He owned and operated the company for nearly twenty years. After the Second World War, he handed his company to his son, Ko Pe Kyaing. Parrot U Sunny died in 1956.

The flaps are stowed during normal vehicle operation; however, in certain situations, e.g., if the vehicle goes into a spin, particularly if it is facing backwards, the flaps deploy to disrupt the air flow over the roof and reduce the lift force on the vehicle. NASCAR mandates that cars in the Cup and Xfinity series have two roof flaps positioned near the rear of the vehicle, with the left flap oriented perpendicular to the length of the car and the right flap angled 45¬∞ counter- clockwise (when looking downward) from the left flap. Trucks in the Camping World Truck Series only have the angled flap, due to the smaller roof area of the pickup truck type greenhouse and lower overall lift potential of the body shape. Originally, the flaps each measured wide by tall. Following several incidents where cars became airborne in Sprint Cup races in preceding years, NASCAR mandated new, larger flaps to increase their effectiveness, introduced with the \\"Car of Tomorrow\\" fifth generation body style in 2007. Flap specs were enlarged again for the \\"Generation 6\\" body styles which debuted in 2013. For the 2013 season, the flaps measured tall by tall on the left side, and by on the right. The new flaps are designed to deploy more quickly than the previous design, and include canvas \\"parachutes\\" on their underside to further disrupt airflow when deployed. A race car's body is designed to optimize downforce, but if that body is spun so air is flowing in reverse, lift is generated instead of countered. The roof flaps' job is to disrupt that airflow and prevent lift. The decision to implement a safety device to keep cars on the ground came after two crashes in 1993. In the first, Rusty Wallace barrel- rolled through the infield of Talladega Superspeedway in 1993 after being tagged by Dale Earnhardt exiting the tri-oval. Wallace's car spun backwards, and lifted off the ground. The car landed in a grassy area of the track and his car tumbled violently down the frontstretch. In August of that same year, Johnny Benson spun off turn two at Michigan International Speedway and flipped down the backstretch. NASCAR tested a restrictor plate at Charlotte Motor Speedway that September but driver lobbying led to development of the roof flaps. \\"We developed them so NASCAR would not slow the cars down more,\\" said the devices' primary engineer, Jack Roush. Following Matt Crafton's flip at Daytona International Speedway in 2017, NASCAR developed flaps that are located on the decklid of the trucks, meant to keep the trucks from getting airborne due to their tendency to do so despite the angled flap on their roofs (most likely due to how much lighter the rears of the trucks are compared to Xfinity and Cup cars in combination with the much taller and wider spoiler than the higher tier series.). These flaps are designed to deploy as the truck goes around, venting the air through the decklid, which often acted as a parachute before. However, upon introduction at Talladega that fall, it was found that the center flap would often deploy on track as the trucks qualified or raced. This was likely due to the positioning of the flap, being close to the rear windshield on the trucks. The pocket of low pressure caused by turbulence of the air coming around the trucks' cabs is likely what caused it to deploy. This resulted in stunted qualifying runs and the inability to keep the trucks grouped in packs during racing as a result of how vastly it changed the flow of air around the trucks. They did prove effective in their purpose later in the race when Cody Coughlin wrecked with others during the Talladega race, when his truck threatened to go airborne upon turning backwards, but set back down, although ontop of another truck in the process.

RNAa was first reported in a 2006 PNAS paper by Li et al. who also coined the term \\"RNAa\\" as a contrast to RNA interference (RNAi) to describe such gene activation phenomenon. dsRNAs that trigger RNAa have been termed small activating RNA (saRNA).Li, Longcheng; Dahiya, Rajvir. \\"Small Activating RNA Molecules and Methods of Use.\\" U.S. Patent US 8,877,721 filed October 1, 2004, and issued November 4, 2014. Since the initial discovery of RNAa in human cells, many other groups have made similar observations in different mammalian species including human, non-human primates, rat and mice, plant and C. elegans, suggesting that RNAa is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of gene regulation. RNAa can be generally classified into two categories: exogenous and endogenous. Exogenous RNAa is triggered by artificially designed saRNAs which target non-coding sequences such as the promoter and the 3‚Äô terminus of a gene and these saRNAs can be chemically synthesized or expressed as short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Whereas for endogenous RNAa, upregulation of gene expression is guided by naturally occurring endogenous small RNAs such as miRNA in mammalian cells and C. elegans, and 22G RNA in C. elegans.  Mechanism  The molecular mechanism of RNAa is not fully understood. Similar to RNAi, it has been shown that mammalian RNAa requires members of the Ago clade of Argonaute proteins, particularly Ago2, but possesses kinetics distinct from RNAi. In contrast to RNAi, promoter-targeted saRNAs induce prolonged activation of gene expression associated with epigenetic changes. It is currently suggested that saRNAs are first loaded and processed by an Ago protein to form an Ago-RNA complex which is then guided by the RNA to its promoter target. The target can be a non-coding transcript overlapping the promoter or the chromosomal DNA. The RNA-loaded Ago then recruits other proteins such as RHA, also known as nuclear DNA helicase II, and CTR9 to form an RNA-induced transcriptional activation (RITA) complex. RITA can directly interacts with RNAP II to stimulate transcription initiation and productive transcription elongation which is related to increased ubiquitination of H2B.  Endogenous RNAa  In 2008, Place et al. identified targets for miRNA miR-373 on the promoters of several human genes and found that introduction of miR-373 mimics into human cells induced the expression of its predicted target genes. This study provided the first example that RNAa could be mediated by naturally occurring non-coding RNA (ncRNA). In 2011, Huang et al. further demonstrated in mouse cells that endogenous RNAa mediated by miRNAs functions in a physiological context and is possibly exploited by cancer cells to gain a growth advantage. Since then, a number of miRNAs have been shown to upregulate gene expression by targeting gene promoters or enhancers, thereby, exerting important biological roles. A good example is miR-551b-3p which is overexpressed in ovarian cancer due to amplification. By targeting the promoter of STAT3 to increase its transcription, miR-551b-3p confers to ovarian cancer cells resistance to apoptosis and a proliferative advantage. In C. elegans hypodermal seam cells, the transcription of lin-4 miRNA is positively regulated by lin-4 itself which binds to a conserved lin-4 complementary element in its promoter, constituting a positive autoregulatory loop. In C. elegans, Argonaute CSR-1 interacts with 22G small RNAs derived from RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and antisense to germline-expressed transcripts to protect these mRNAs from Piwi-piRNA mediated silencing via promoting epigenetic activation. It is currently unknown how widespread gene regulation by endogenous RNAa is in mammalian cells. Studies have shown that both miRNAs and Ago proteins (Ago1) bind to numerous sites in human genome, especially promoter regions, to exert a largely positive effect on gene transcription.  Applications  RNAa has been used to study gene function in lieu of vector-based gene overexpression. Studies have demonstrated RNAa in vivo and its potential therapeutic applications in treating cancer and non- cancerous diseases. In June 2016, UK-based MiNA Therapeutics announced the initiation of a phase I trial of the first-ever saRNA drug MTL-CEBPA in patients with liver cancer, in an attempt to activate CEBPA gene.

C. Thompson was a neurosurgeon assigned to Navy Hospital. Entomology was a hobby, and he also showed an interest in the herpetofauna of San Diego County. He offered to supervise the construction of a reptile house, announcing that he already had plans for one. He was elected vice-president of the Zoological Society, and was appointed with Dr. Harry Wegeforth and Frank Stephens to draw up the Articles of Incorporation and the By-Laws. Thompson is given credit for much of the planning of the Zoo's education program. In a news article he wrote in 1916, he described the arrangement of exhibits as they would appear in Balboa Park's Pepper Grove, an early choice for the Zoo's location. He also announced that there would be guidebooks, text books and free lectures. After having been presented with a Kodiak bear lent to the Zoo by Captain Prideaux of the U. S. collier Nanshan, Thompson announced that the first lecture would be about bears. It must have been an interesting lecture. \\"Caesar\\", the Kodiak, had been kept as a mascot and pet by the crew of the Nanshan until she got too large and unruly. According to Dr. Wegeforth, none of them knew anything about crating bears, and didn't know quite how to get her to the Zoo. With no truck, and no expertise in handling bears, it was decided to put a collar and chain around the bear's neck and let her ride to the Zoo with Thompson, seated beside him in the front of his car.\\" Psychoanalytic career In the early 1920s Thompson became interested in Freudian psychoanalysis and he underwent analysis with Dr. Henry Grovens in 1923. In 1924 Thompson became vice- president of the Washington Psychoanalytic Association, but by 1936, after criticizing the American psychoanalytic establishment for straying too far from Freud, he was no longer listed as a member of the association. It was Thompson's contention that lay analysts should be given as much importance in the psychoanalytic field as physicians. Sigmund Freud's collected correspondence in the US Library of Congress does contain a 1923 postcard to Joe Tom Sun, listed in the collection as an alias for Dr. Thompson of Baltimore, M.D. In Guam, Commander Thompson became involved in archaeological explorations, and the 1923 Journal of the Polynesian Society reported that due to his efforts \\"much information has been obtained about the culture of the vanished Chamorros, a flourishing race at the time of Magellan's visit in 1521.\\" The Journal of the Polynesian Society, 1923 Also while in Guam, under the pseudonym 'Joe Tom Sun', Thompson published three articles in the Psychoanalytic Review: * 'Symbolism in the Chinese Written Language' (1923)'Symbolism in the Chinese Written Language' Psychoanalytic Review, 1923 * 'Psychology in Primitive Buddhism' (1924)'Psychology in Primitive Buddhism' Psychoanalytic Review, 1924 * 'Symbolism in the Sumerian Written Language' (1924)'Symbolism in the Sumerian Written Language' Psychoanalytic Review, 1924 His other published works on psychiatry: * 'Psychoanalytic Literature' (1923) (as J. C. Thompson) (1923) US Naval Medical Bulletin Vol XIX * 'The Psychoanalyst and his Work' (1924) (as J. C. Thompson)US Naval Medical Bulletin vol.

Thompson) The Military Surgeon vol. 53 Encounter with L. Ron Hubbard In 1923 Thompson accompanied then-12-year- old L. Ron Hubbard, the future founder of Scientology, on an ocean liner sailing from his father's posting in San Diego to a new one in Washington, D.C. According to a recording of Hubbard sharing anecdotes from his life, he considered Thompson to be a \\"very great man\\" who sparked Hubbard's interest in \\"the human mind\\". Hubbard said that Thompson told him, \\"If it's not true for you, it's not true.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laGfzYjotbs Clara Mabel Thompson In 1924 the noted psychoanalyst Clara Thompson (no relation to Joseph), began psychoanalytic treatment with him as her analyst. She had been a psychiatric resident under psychobiologist Dr. Adolf Meyer at Phipps Clinic in Baltimore, and Meyer had seen fit to put her in charge of his private patients. Clara's classmates described her as frequently seen dining with her analyst, or with him 'walking arm-in-arm, talking animatedly.' By 1925 Dr. Meyer was objecting to Clara's analyst, and Meyer dismissed Clara from her position after she refused to discontinue her treatment with Thompson. In a later letter to Clara, Dr. Meyer makes a reference to a 'misleading influence' that may have been aimed at her analyst. The next year Dr. Meyer wrote to a Johns Hopkins doctor calling Joseph Thompson 'a clever, but unsavory psychoanalyst.' Clara, meanwhile, felt obliged to defend herself from rumor mongers who claimed that she had been asked to resign for being her analyst's mistress. She wrote to Meyer, \\"It happens that I have never been his mistress at any time.\\"Inter-personal Analysis: The Selected Papers of Clara M. Thompson by Maurice Green, Basic Books, New York 1964 Developer of Burmese cats Already an established breeder of Siamese cats, by 1926 Thompson had founded a cattery which he named 'Mau Tien', or cat heaven.CFA Siamese Yearbook 1960 \\"MAU TIEN CATTERY (Dr. Joseph C. Thompson, San Francisco, California), was established about 1926. The parent stock for this cattery came from their native land and Dr. Thompson made every effort to keep the original characteristics of the native breed. Dr. Thompson's Siamese were very large in size, due in large part to an outdoor mode of life and a diet of lean meat, liver, fish and grass. The imported sire, Tai Mau, weighed seven and one-half pounds while his son, Pak Kwai Mau, tipped the scales at ten and one-half pounds. But the real \\"jumbo\\" Siamese of the cattery was Kwai Tse Mau, son of Pak Kwai Mau and Tai Noo Mau, which weighed 15 pounds. In addition to promoting the Siamese, Dr. Thompson was instrumental in creating much interest in the Burmese cat in America. He introduced the Burmese cat to the West by the importation of a female, Wong Mau, from Burma in 1930. Dr. Thompson's established place in the history of the fancy is attributed to his untiring efforts over the years to obtain recognition of the Burmese, with the result that the Burmese cat was accepted and permitted to compete in the championship classes. Dr. Thompson was a former director of the Siamese Cat Society of America.\\" In order to develop the Burmese breed of cat,World Encyclopedia of Cats by Angela Sayer, published by Octopus Books 1977. \\"In 1930 Dr. Joseph C. Thompson took a brown cat named Wong Mau from Burma to America. She herself was a hybrid from Siamese and a dark-coated breed named Burmese. Mated to a Siamese, she produced hybrids and Siamese. When the Burmese/Siamese hybrids were mated together, the darker coated Burmese were produced. These bred true, and in 1936 the Burmese was officially recognized in the United States of America as a new show breed.\\" In 1943 the Journal of Heredity published posthumously an article Thompson co-wrote, titled, \\"The Genetics of the Burmese Cat\\".\\"The Genetics of the Burmese Cat\\", Thompson et al., Journal of Heredity, 1943 At one time Thompson had 45 cats. San Francisco After retiring from the Navy in 1929, Thompson moved to San Francisco, where he was one of very few psychoanalysts. On March 7, 1943, Thompson died of a heart attack in San Francisco, at the age of 68. His obituary in the San Francisco Chronicle mentioned his widow, Mrs. Hilda Thompson, and a very special Siamese cat, known as Pak Kwai Mau, or 'White Devil Cat'. He left $10,000 in the bank in Pak Kwai Mau's name. Thompson's grave can be found in Golden Gate National Cemetery, San Bruno, San Mateo County, California. https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/3641145/joseph-cheesman-thompson In addition to contributing to the fields of cat fancy and psychoanalysis, Thompson wrote papers on fish,Fish Fauna of the Tortugas Archipelago' (with David Starr Jordan) Bulletin of the US Bureau of Fisheries reptiles and amphibians.'Description of a new genus and species of salamander from Japan', (1912) California Academy of Sciences, 'The variation exhibited by mainland and island specimens of the Hibakari snake, natrix vibakari (Boie)' (1914) US National Museum, 'The variation exhibited by Thamnophis ordinoides, (Baird and Girard) a garter snake inhabiting the San Francisco peninsula' (1917)'Notes on Serpents in the Family Colubridae' (1913) Natural Sciences of Philadelphia'Contributions to the Synonymy of Serpents in the family Elapidae' (1913) Academy of Natural Sciences'Further contributions to the anatomy of the ophidia' (1914) Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London'Description of a new species of sea snake from the Philippine Islands with a note on the palatine teeth in the proteroglypha'.(1908) (with J.

The aethalia, or fruiting bodies, occur either scattered or in groups on damp rotten wood, especially on large logs, from June to November. These aethalia are small, pink to brown cushion-like globs. They may excrete a pink paste if the outer wall is broken before maturity. When mature, the colour tends to become more brownish. When not fruiting, single celled individuals move about as very small, red amoeba-like organisms called plasmodia, masses of protoplasm that engulf bacteria, fungal and plant spores, protozoa, and particles of non-living organic matter through phagocytosis (see slime mould for more information). Description Aethalia on decaying wood During the plasmodial stage, individuals are reddish in colour, but these are almost never seen. When conditions change, the individuals aggregate by means of chemical signalling to form an aethalium, or fruiting body. These appear as small cushion-like blobs measuring about in diameter. Colour is quite variable, ranging from pinkish grey to yellowish brown or greenish black, with mature individuals tending towards the darker end. They may be either round or somewhat compressed with a warted or rough texture. While immature they are filled with a pink, paste-like fluid. With maturity the fluid becomes a powdery mass of minute grey spores. The spores measure 6 to 7.5 ¬µm and are round in shape with a netted texture and appearing ochre to lavender in colour. The pseudocapillitia, sterile elements in the spore mass, are long, flattened, branching tubes with transverse wrinkles and folds.

He was president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America from January 1, 1980 to October 31, 1982. He was born in 1915 in Cleveland, Ohio, to Louis and Mary (Gabor) Konyha. His father was a carpenter. He was educated in public schools, and attended a four-year trade school before becoming a carpenter in 1936. He joined Local 1180 in Cleveland. In 1939, Konyha was elected president of Local 11800 and business manager for the Cleveland District Council of Carpenters. During World War II, Konyha served in the Seabees and served and saw combat in the South Pacific. After the war, he attended Chicago Technical College from 1945 to 1947. In 1947, he was hired as an organizer by the international Carpenters union. In 1952, he became a staff representative, and began servicing contracts throughout Ohio. In 1960, Konyha was elected president of the Ohio State Council of Carpenters. In 1962, he was elected president of the Ohio AFL-CIO. He resigned both positions in 1970 when he was elected a vice president of the international Carpenters union representing District 3. He was elected second vice president in 1972, and first vice president in 1973. Konyha was appointed to the Federal Apprentice Committee by President Richard Nixon. After the retirement of William Sidell in 1979, Konyha was elected his successor as president of the Carpenters union. In 1980, Konyha was elected a vice president of the AFL-CIO, and he won a full term as Carpenters president in 1981. In 1981, Konyha invited President Ronald Reagan to be honorary chair of the union's 100th anniversary celebration. Reagan agreed. In the interim, Reagan asked Congress for tax cuts and fired striking federal air traffic controllers. Konyha spent the intervening months attacking Reagan's tax policy, and defended the right of federal workers to strike after Reagan's speech. Nevertheless, the bad blood between the two men did not prevent Reagan from appointing Konyha to the National Productivity Advisory Committee later that year. Retirement Konyha unexpectedly resigned a year into his term. He quit the presidency on October 31, 1982. No reason was given for his sudden announcement. First vice president Patrick J. Campbell succeeded him as interim president. Once retired, Konyha raised racehorses. In 1991, Konyha and a group of investors (which included a former Ohio state racing commissioner) bought Finger Lakes Race Track near Syracuse, New York. Konyha and his wife, Evelyn, had six children. He was preceded in death by one son. References *Balz, Dan. \\"President Defends Firing of Controllers Before Labor Group.\\" Washington Post.

Manual testing is the process of manually testing software for defects. It requires a tester to play the role of an end user whereby they use most of the application's features to ensure correct behavior. To guarantee completeness of testing, the tester often follows a written test plan that leads them through a set of important test cases. Overview A key step in the process is testing the software for correct behavior prior to release to end users. For small scale engineering efforts (including prototypes), exploratory testing may be sufficient. With this informal approach, the tester does not follow any rigorous testing procedure, but rather explores the user interface of the application using as many of its features as possible, using information gained in prior tests to intuitively derive additional tests. The success of exploratory manual testing relies heavily on the domain expertise of the tester, because a lack of knowledge will lead to incompleteness in testing. One of the key advantages of an informal approach is to gain an intuitive insight to how it feels to use the application. Large scale engineering projects that rely on manual software testing follow a more rigorous methodology in order to maximize the number of defects that can be found. A systematic approach focuses on predetermined test cases and generally involves the following steps.ANSI/IEEE 829-1983 IEEE Standard for Software Test Documentation # Choose a high level test plan where a general methodology is chosen, and resources such as people, computers, and software licenses are identified and acquired. # Write detailed test cases, identifying clear and concise steps to be taken by the tester, with expected outcomes. # Assign the test cases to testers, who manually follow the steps and record the results. # Author a test report, detailing the findings of the testers. The report is used by managers to determine whether the software can be released, and if not, it is used by engineers to identify and correct the problems. A rigorous test case based approach is often traditional for large software engineering projects that follow a Waterfall model. However, at least one recent study did not show a dramatic difference in defect detection efficiency between exploratory testing and test case based testing. Testing can be through black-, white- or grey-box testing. In white-box testing the tester is concerned with the execution of the statements through the source code. In black-box testing the software is run to check for the defects and is less concerned with how the processing of the input is done. Black-box testers do not have access to the source code. Grey-box testing is concerned with running the software while having an understanding of the source code and algorithms. Static and dynamic testing approach may also be used. Dynamic testing involves running the software. Static testing includes verifying requirements, syntax of code and any other activities that do not include actually running the code of the program. Testing can be further divided into functional and non-functional testing. In functional testing the tester would check the calculations, any link on the page, or any other field which on given input, output may be expected. Non-functional testing includes testing performance, compatibility and fitness of the system under test, its security and usability among other things. Stages There are several stages. They are: ;Unit Testing: This initial stage in testing normally carried out by the developer who wrote the code and sometimes by a peer using the white box testing technique. ;Integration Testing: This stage is carried out in two modes, as a complete package or as an increment to the earlier package. Most of the time black box testing technique is used. However, sometimes a combination of Black and White box testing is also used in this stage. ;System Testing: In this stage the software is tested from all possible dimensions for all intended purposes and platforms. In this stage Black box testing technique is normally used. ;User Acceptance Testing: This testing stage carried out in order to get customer sign-off of finished product. A 'pass' in this stage also ensures that the customer has accepted the software and is ready for their use. ;Release or Deployment Testing: Onsite team will go to customer site to install the system in customer configured environment and will check for the following points: # Whether SetUp.exe is running or not. # There are easy screens during installation # How much space is occupied by system on HDD # Is the system completely uninstalled when opted to uninstall from the system. Comparison to automated testing Test automation may be able to reduce or eliminate the cost of actual testing. A computer can follow a rote sequence of steps more quickly than a person, and it can run the tests overnight to present the results in the morning. However, the labor that is saved in actual testing must be spent instead authoring the test program. Depending on the type of application to be tested, and the automation tools that are chosen, this may require more labor than a manual approach. In addition, some testing tools present a very large amount of data, potentially creating a time consuming task of interpreting the results. Things such as device drivers and software libraries must be tested using test programs. In addition, testing of large numbers of users (performance testing and load testing) is typically simulated in software rather than performed in practice. Conversely, graphical user interfaces whose layout changes frequently are very difficult to test automatically. There are test frameworks that can be used for regression testing of user interfaces. They rely on recording of sequences of keystrokes and mouse gestures, then playing them back and observing that the user interface responds in the same way every time. Unfortunately, these recordings may not work properly when a button is moved or relabeled in a subsequent release. An automatic regression test may also be fooled if the program output varies significantly.

Rajani Anil Wankhede is President of Shindkheda City Council.  History  The Rawal of Shindkheda (Sindkheda) Settlement of Shindkheda may have been in the 12th century, before that this area belonged to Dandaka Aranya. Shindkheda is settled on the bank of Burai River. There is a story on the name of Burai River. One day a Santa (Pujari) bathed on the little stream, suddenly a flow of water increased and Pujari's clothes were swept away. Pujari was shocked and surprised to see some new cloths flowing towards him. He thanked the river and said from today you are named Ma Burai, who will wash everyone's bure karm. At the same time he preached anyone \\"who tries to dirty you will dry yourself or who dirties your water will have a worsened life\\". After the 12th century, Muslim sardars and Khans ruled this area, causing it to be named Khandesh. It is also held that this is khana (Krishna) ka desh so it is kanha Desh. Both Hindus and Muslims live here peacefully in Shindkheda. Khan divided the land into 13.5 provinces, in local languages they are known as Raul (Rawal). Pratapsingh Rawal after that Lakhesing Rawal ruled the Jahagiri up to British rule. On the Era of Pratapsingh Rawal Lord Datta mandir of sindkheda was constructed on the bank of river Maa Burai. At the same era Lord Balaji Mandir might be constructed. Balaji sansthan started Ratha Palkhi Utsava where every year at Ashvin Paurnima i.e. on Kojagiri Paurnima People of the town and surrounding area gather and pull the Ratha around the main street of Sindkheda. It is one of the huge and famous Rath Plakhi utsav around area. During the Indian freedom movement of 1947, Shindkheda contributed freedom fighters like Ramchandra Nathu Buwa-Dukale alias Rama Buwa, Narayan Buwa alias Nana Buwa (Balaji Sansthan,Shinkheda), Vyankatrao Patil. Pratapsing Rawal was strong beloved in Hinduism and mythology so he called to Kavyatirth Hon. Late. Ha.pa.bha. Sitaram Gangadhar Pandit called nickname Shewadkar bapu bapu was bachelor of Sanskrit language and got degree from Kashi(banaras) Hindu Vidyapeeth. He was very popular in Sindkheda taluka. Bapuji read 60 times Bhagwat katha in Datta Mandir. He was master in Vedic Astrology, Mythology and Karmakand he was living at Datta Mandir. This is a great holy place. The whole wooden Rath was built on teak woods and it has five wheels. The fifth wheel is in the middle of other five it is used on very difficult turning on streets. Ratha is passing through different lanes where Muslim people are also pulling the Ratha from their area. Near the mosque the Hindus are stop beating there drums and musical instruments. So loving both the communities‚Äô whole world should learn lesson from this small town. Might be more than last 150 years this Ratha Palkhi ustav gets celebrated in the area, very next day shree Balaji Seats on Palkhi in the evening and bless the people of the town. Near the sindkheda small but famous village Patan which is famous for Ashapuri mataji Temple. There is a story that Ashapuri mataji is coming on every nauratri for Gharbha dance to the Ghadi of Rawals at Sindkheda. Rawal build a very beautiful temple at patan. The first Gymkhana (Vyayamshala) in Shindkheda was opened by freedom fighter Ramchandra Nathu Buwa-Dukale, alias Rama Buwa, and he named it after his guru Damodar, Damodar Guru Vyayamshala Shindkheda. The first boys' school was opened in Shindkheda by Freedom Fighter Ramchandra Nathu Buwa-Dukale. Dr. Phade. School was named 'New English School', then it was renamed M.H.S.S. (Mulla Haidar Shaikh Shamshuddin) High School. The first girls' school was also opened in Shindkheda by 'New English School' named after 'Meerabai Fulchandas Shah'. The first Urdu High School also was opened in Shindkheda by 'New English School'. Mangalsingh Nimji Rajput (aka Thansingh Jibhau) was a famous MLA from this taluka. He was a farmer. Accomplishments to improve the community include Shindkheda Railway Station and its platform, the town's water supply system works, the bridge on the bank of River Burai, and the diversion of water from Tapi River to the town.

The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses this definition as part of its ongoing Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project . Purpose The purpose of the BDI metric is to quantify the relative performance of a brand within specified customer groups. The index helps marketers identify strong and weak segments (usually demographic or geographic) for individual brands. The BDI is especially useful in conjunction with the category development index (CDI). It can be used in deciding the allocations in the media to which a specific brand is advertised. It can also be used to determine how much advertising, or promotion effort is, or should be put in that specific market. Construction BDI: An index of how well a brand performs within a given market group, relative to its performance in the market as a whole. ::BDI (I) = ::[Brand sales to group (#) √∑ Households in group (#)] √∑ ::[Total brand sales (#) √∑ Total households (#)] :: ::Note: Although defined here with respect to households, these indexes could also be calculated for customers, accounts, businesses, or other entities. For example, one might hypothesize that sales per capita of Ben & Jerry's brand ice cream would be greater in the brand's home state, Vermont, than in the rest of the country. By calculating Ben & Jerry's BDIs for Vermont and for the rest of the country, marketers could test this hypothesis quantitatively. Govoni also defined the BDI as the index of brand sales to category sales,Govoni, Norman A. Dictionary of Marketing Communications, Sage Publications, Inc, 2004. though this ratio is more commonly referred to as market share.  See also  * Philip Kotler et al.

Song structure The song is known for its distorted guitars, use of synthesizers (especially with drums and lyrics), and Steven Tyler's scat singing. The chorus of the song also features the phrase \\"fuckin' A\\" which is bleeped out through use of a turntable for much of the song; until the end, when the expletive can actually be heard a few times. The radio edit bleeps this out while the radio remix replaces the lyrics. The song also features a reference to \\"Walk This Way\\". In other media The song was performed heavily on Aerosmith's Just Push Play Tour and was also featured in Dodge Ram commercials, during the band's 2001 partnership with the car company. The song was also played during Aerosmith's performance at the historic United We Stand: What More Can I Give benefit concert in October 2001.

This strain of P. syringae lacks the ability to produce a certain surface protein, usually found on wild-type P. syringae. The \\"ice-plus\\" protein (INA protein, \\"Ice nucleation-active\\" protein) found on the outer bacterial cell wall acts as the nucleating centers for ice crystals. This facilitates ice formation, hence the designation \\"ice- plus\\". The ice-minus variant of P. syringae is a mutant, lacking the gene responsible for ice-nucleating surface protein production. This lack of surface protein provides a less favorable environment for ice formation. Both strains of P. syringae occur naturally, but recombinant DNA technology has allowed for the synthetic removal or alteration of specific genes, enabling the ice-minus strain to be created from the ice-plus strain in the lab. The ice nucleating nature of P. syringae incites frost development, freezing the buds of the plant and destroying the occurring crop. The introduction of an ice-minus strain of P. syringae to the surface of plants would reduce the amount of ice nucleate present, rendering higher crop yields. The recombinant form was developed as a commercial product known as Frostban. Field-testing of Frostban in 1987 was the first release of a genetically modified organism into the environment. The testing was very controversial and drove the formation of US biotechnology policy. Frostban was never marketed. Production To systematically create the ice-minus strain of P. syringae, its ice-forming gene must be isolated, amplified, deactivated and reintroduced into P. syringae bacterium. The following steps are often used to isolate and generate ice-minus strains of P. syringae: # Digest P. syringaes DNA with restriction enzymes. # Insert the individual DNA pieces into a plasmid. Pieces will insert randomly, allowing for different variations of recombinant DNA to be produced. # Transform the bacterium Escherichia coli (E.coli) with the recombinant plasmid. The plasmid will be taken in by the bacteria, rendering it part of the organism's DNA. # Identify the ice-gene from the numerous newly developed E. coli recombinants. Recombinant E. coli with the ice-gene will possess the ice-nucleating phenotype, these will be \\"ice-plus\\". # With the ice nucleating recombinant identified, amplify the ice gene with techniques such as polymerase chain reactions (PCR). # Create mutant clones of the ice gene through the introduction of mutagenic agents such as UV radiation to inactivate the ice gene, creating the \\"ice-minus\\" gene. # Repeat previous steps (insert gene into plasmid, transform E. coli, identify recombinants) with the newly created mutant clones to identify the bacteria with the ice- minus gene. They will possess the desired ice-minus phenotype. # Insert the ice-minus gene into normal, ice-plus P. syringae bacterium. # Allow recombination to take place, rendering both ice-minus and ice-plus strains of P. syringae. Economic importance Icy Lingonberry In the United States alone, it has been estimated that frost accounts for approximately $1 billion in crop damage each year. As P. syringae commonly inhabits plant surfaces, its ice nucleating nature incites frost development, freezing the buds of the plant and destroying the occurring crop. The introduction of an ice-minus strain of P. syringae to the surface of plants would incur competition between the strains. Should the ice-minus strain win out, the ice nucleate provided by P. syringae would no longer be present, lowering the level of frost development on plant surfaces at normal water freezing temperature ‚Äì . Even if the ice-minus strain does not win out, the amount of ice nucleate present from ice-plus P. syringae would be reduced due to competition. Decreased levels of frost generation at normal water freezing temperature would translate into a lowered quantity of crops lost due to frost damage, rendering higher crop yields overall. Historical perspective In 1961, Paul Hoppe of the U.S. Department of Agriculture studied a corn fungus by grinding up infected leaves each season, then applying the powder to test corn for the following season to track the disease. A surprise frost occurred that year, leaving peculiar results. Only plants infected with the diseased powder incurred frost damage, leaving healthy plants unfrozen. This phenomenon would baffle scientists until graduate student Stephen Lindow of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison with D.C. Arny and C. Upper found a bacterium in the dried leaf powder in the early 1970s. Lindow, now a plant pathologist at the University of California- Berkeley, found that when this particular bacterium was introduced to plants where it is originally absent, the plants became very vulnerable to frost damage. He would go on to identify the bacterium as P. syringae, investigate P. syringaes role in ice nucleation and in 1977, discover the mutant ice-minus strain. He was later successful at developing the ice-minus strain of P. syringae through recombinant DNA technology as well. In 1983, a biotech company, Advanced Genetic Sciences (AGS) applied for U.S. government authorization to perform field tests with the ice-minus strain of P. syringae, but environmental groups and protestors delayed the field tests for four years with legal challenges. In 1987, the ice-minus strain of P. syringae became the first genetically modified organism (GMO) to be released into the environment when a strawberry field in California was sprayed with the ice-minus strain of P. syringae. The results were promising, showing lowered frost damage to the treated plants. Lindow also conducted an experiment on a crop of potato seedlings sprayed with ice-minus P. syringae. He was successful in protecting the potato crop from frost damage with a strain of ice-minus P. syringae. Controversy At the time of Lindow's work on ice-minus P. syringae, genetic engineering was considered to be very controversial. Jeremy Rifkin and his Foundation on Economic Trends (FET) sued the NIH in federal court to delay the field trials, arguing that NIH had failed to conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment and had failed to explore the possible effects \\"Ice-minus\\" bacteria might have on ecosystems and even global weather patterns. Once approval was granted, both test fields were attacked by activist groups the night before the tests occurred: \\"The world's first trial site attracted the world's first field trasher\\". The BBC quoted Andy Caffrey from Earth First!: \\"When I first heard that a company in Berkley was planning to release these bacteria Frostban in my community, I literally felt a knife go into me. Here once again, for a buck, science, technology and corporations were going to invade my body with new bacteria that hadn't existed on the planet before. It had already been invaded by smog, by radiation, by toxic chemicals in my food, and I just wasn't going to take it anymore.\\" Rifkin's successful legal challenge forced the Reagan Administration to more quickly develop an overarching regulatory policy to guide federal decision-making about agricultural biotechnology. In 1986, the Office of Science and Technology Policy issued the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology, which continues to govern US regulatory decisions. The controversy drove many biotech companies away from use of genetically engineering microorganisms in agriculture.

Set in the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, the novel narrates the exploits of Emilio Roccanera, Lord of Ventimiglia and his attempts to avenge his brothers, slain by the Duke Van Guld, now Governor of Maracaibo. The Lord of Ventimiglia, known throughout the Spanish Main as the Black Corsair, allies himself with some of the greatest pirates and buccaneers of the era: Fran√ßois L'Ollonais, Michael the Basque and Henry Morgan, vowing never to rest until he attains his vengeance.  Plot summary  Two pirates, Carmaux and Van Stiller, are rescued by the Thunder, a pirate ship under the command of Emilio di Roccabruna of Roccanera, Lord of Valpenta and of Ventimiglia, and feared throughout the Caribbean as the Black Corsair. Once aboard, the two inform the captain that his younger brother the \\"Red Corsair\\" has been hanged by Duke van Guld, the Governor of Maracaibo. The Black Corsair decides to sneak into the city to retrieve his brother's body and give him an honourable burial at sea. Carmaux and Van Stiller accompany the Corsair to the city, and aided by their friend Moko, manage to steal the body. After a series of adventures the Corsair and his men return to the Thunder with the body. On the night the Corsair buries his brother, he vows to slay Van Guld and all those who bear his name. En route to Tortuga, the pirates attack and capture a Spanish ship. They find a young noblewoman aboard, Honorata Willerman, the Duchess of Weltrendrem. She is taken captive to Tortuga where she is to await payment of her ransom. Struck by her beauty and spirit, the Corsair frees her and the two quickly fall in love. The hunt for Governor Van Guld resumes and the Black Corsair and L'Ollonais lead an attack on Maracaibo. Unfortunately the governor escapes and the Black Corsair and his companions must track him through the jungles of Venezuela. There they encounter savage beasts, quick sand, and cannibals. Van Guld proves elusive and to capture him the pirates must make an assault on the city of Gibraltar, Venezuela. But unfortunately, although they succeed in storming the city, they are late: Van Guld has fled again. Returning to the Thunder, a Spanish prisoner reveals accidentally this terrible truth, \\"Honorata Willerman\\" is really Honorata de Van Guld, Governor Van Guld's daughter! So the Black Corsair must kill her because he has sworn to kill all those bearing his hated enemy's name. Honorata is willing to accept her death, but the Corsair is not able to kill her in cold blood and instead he decides to maroon her on a fragile boat. While he sees her beloved Honorata drifting away on a fragile boat which can sink at any moment, the Corsair bursts into tears. \\"Look, Stiller, the Black Corsair is crying!\\" says a grieving Carmaux. Sequels The quest for vengeance stretches over the course of several novels: The Queen of the Caribbean (La regina dei Caraibi),Honorata de Wan Guld , Yolanda, the Black Corsair's Daughter (Jolanda, la figlia del Corsaro Nero), The Son of the Red Corsair (Il figlio del corsaro rosso) and The Last Filibusters (Gli ultimi filibustieri).  Film versions  There have been several film versions of the novel. In the 1920s, director Vitale Di Stefano first brought the Corsair trilogy to the screen with a series of silent films. In 1937, Amleto Palermi directed the first remake of Il corsaro nero and Italian fencing champion Ciro Verratti was cast to play the Black Corsair. In 1944, Mexican director Chano Urueta filmed El corsario negro, the first Spanish language adaptation. In 1976, Kabir Bedi and Carole Andr√© were reunited to portray The Black Corsair and Honorata in another Sergio Sollima adaptation of a Salgari classic, The Black Corsair. Urueta's and Sollima's films are available on DVD. In 1999 Mondo TV (Italy) created a 26-episode animated TV series \\"The Black Corsair\\".  Trivia  In the late 19th century Emilio Salgari was Italy's foremost writer of adventure novels. He was knighted in 1897 in recognition for his work. The Black Corsair, the Chevalier Emilio, is named after himself. He also pays tribute to the House of Savoy, Italy's Royal family to show his gratitude. Yolanda, the Black Corsair's daughter is named after Princess Yolanda of Savoy. Salgari used A History of The Buccaneers of America by Alexandre Exquemelin as one of his main references. Van Guld, the Governor of Maracaibo, is based on the real life Governor of M√©rida. The attacks on Maracaibo and Gibraltar are based on true events as are the biographies of the pirates that appear in the novel. Il Corsaro Nero sold 80,000 copies in its first printing, a record in Italy at the time.

It was banned by the Pan- Malaysian Islamic Party because of its animist and Hindu-Buddhist roots which pre-date Islam in the Asian region by far. The late Cik Ning was a leading Mak Yong performer in the 1980s. In 2005, UNESCO declared Mak Yong theatre a \\"Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity\\". Mak Yong is considered the most authentic and representative of Malay performing arts because it is mostly untouched by external sources. Although most traditional Malay dances were influenced by India, Java and other parts of Southeast Asia, Mak Yong's singing and musical repertoire are unique. Of the major stories performed in Mak Yong, most are derived from Kelantan-Patani mythology. Some of those obtained from outside the Malayan-Thai region have now died out elsewhere such as Anak Raja Gondang, a story originally from the Jataka tales but now almost unknown in India. A performance begins by paying respect to the spirits (semah kumpung) with an offering. This is followed by dancing, acting, and improvised dialogues. Stories were presented in a series of three-hour performances over several nights. The lead dancer is called the Pak Yong and dresses like a king. The cast usually includes a queen in second lead, palace girls, and jesters. Traditionally, all performers were female except for the clowns who are always male. A group called Jong Dongdang sings and dances in between chapters and at the story's closing. The Mak Yong orchestra is small with the main instruments played being the three-stringed spiked lute, drum (gendang), and a pair of gong. It may also include the flute (serunai), keduk drums and small cymbals (kesi). Today there is less than ten veterans Mak Yong performers. Although there have been a few attempts to revive the art form, seasoned performers have noted a clear difference between the commercialized Mak Yong of urban dancers when compared with the movements of rural performers. Not many young people are willing to undergo the rigorous apprenticeship so the art is now on the decline. History Mak Yong was originally a form of folk theatre involving rituals connected with propitiation as well as healing. It is believed to have come into being in the Pattani Kingdom, which is now a province of Thailand. Because it was passed down orally among villagers, Mak Yong's exact age is uncertain. However, the fact that it is mostly free of outside influence would make it 800 years old at the very least and almost certainly much older. Legend generally credits the dance to a rice spirit called Mak Hiang but a later belief tells that it was created by the clown-like divinity, Semar. Certain scholars connected Mak Yong with the palace, especially in Patani, but there is no evidence for this. It was patronized by all layers of society to pay respect to spirits, give thanks for the harvest, or to cure a person of various illnesses. According to the Hikayat Patani, Mak Yong was brought to Kelantan more than 200 years ago. From there, the practice was also spread to Kedah and it was mostly performed for royalty until it was more often seen among the common folk in the 1920s. Whereas the palace theatre mirrored the elegance of royalty, peasant performers enacted the life of workers in the rice fields. Nevertheless, Mak Yong's delicate movements, polite mannerisms, and refined speech endured. In 1923, the king's youngest son, Long Abdul Ghaffar wanted Mak Yong to retain its courtly look. He built a cultural precinct called Kampung Temenggung on his palace grounds to lend his support to the arts. During this time, it became conventional to have a lead female. His death in 1935 was followed by World War II. Mak Yong was once again a folk tradition but it now regained much of the sophistication it had as a court theatre, especially in the costumes, make-up, and music. The traditional Mak Yong had continued into the 1960s and 70s but was later impeded by the Islamic revival. When PAS took control of Kelantan in 1991, they banned Mak Yong in the state for its \\"un- Islamic elements\\" and clothing which leaves the head and arms uncovered. Although many old performers defied the ban, Mak Yong could no longer be shown in public. Some thought the tradition would die out until UNESCO declared it as one of the intangible cultural heritages that should be preserved. There has since been some effort to preserve Mak Yong outside Kelantan but interest among the younger generation is lacking. Nowadays, Mak Yong is seldom performed at cultural shows as the priority is often focused on the modern Malays ethnic group dances like joget. It is sometimes still staged at weddings, to celebrate a state's independence or to pray for the king's long life. However, these modern shortened performances are stripped of the old animist rituals and their music is simplified because the songs are played so infrequently. There are only a few troupes left who perform traditionally Mak Yong in the villages of Kelantan and Terengganu. Ritual performance As with many other ancient Malay forms of theatre, Mak Yong was once used for healing purposes. Healing Mak Yong is called Mak Yong Mak Puteri and involves trance dancing and spirit possession through the use of the traditional healing ritual called Main Puteri. These healing rituals are still practiced in the villages as well as in some more traditional cities but they are largely frowned upon today. Ritual performances are more elaborate than those staged for entertainment, combining shamanism, feasting the spirits, and dance theatre. It reflects the deep, mystical significance of Mak Yong's stories and dances and its original aim to serve as a conduit to the spirit world. Ritual performances are enacted for spiritual healing, to pay homage to a teacher and for the graduation of a performer.Prof. Dr Ghulam-Sarwar Yousof: \\"Mak Yong as ritual\\", Vol. 8: Performing Arts. The Encyclopedia of Malaysia, 2004. Indonesia In Indonesia, Mak Yong performance found in Riau and North Sumatra, spread from South Thailand via Singapore. In the Riau Islands, mak yong is performed in Batam and Bintan, by groups from Pulau Panjang, Kecamatan Kijang and Pulau Mantang Arang.

He was the oldest son of Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu. He drew ire from his parents for wastefulness (which Emperor Wen disliked) and having many concubines (which Empress Dugu disliked), while his younger brother, Yang Guang, whom Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu thought lacked these faults, was favored by them. In 600, Emperor Wen deposed Yang Yong and replaced him with Yang Guang. Subsequently, after Emperor Wen died in 604 (a death that most historians, while acknowledging a lack of conclusive evidence, believed to be a murder ordered by Yang Guang), Yang Guang had Yang Yong put to death. Background It is not known when Yang Yong was born. He was the oldest son of Yang Jian and his wife Dugu Qieluo, but it is not known whether he was older or younger than his oldest sister, Yang Lihua (who later became empress to Emperor Xuan of Northern Zhou), born in 561. During Northern Zhou, as Yang Jian's father Yang Zhong () the Duke of Sui was an accomplished general, Yang Yong received the title of Marquess of Boping. (This implies, but does not conclusively show, that Yang Yong was born before Yang Zhong's death in 568, when Yang Jian inherited the title of Duke of Sui.) Sometime before 580, Yang Jian and Lady Dugu selected the daughter of the official Yuan Xiaoju (), a descendant of Northern Wei's imperial house, to be Yang Yong's wife. During this time, Yang Yong served as a low-level official in Northern Zhou's imperial administration. In 580, after Emperor Xuan's death, Yang Jian seized power as regent over Emperor Xuan's son Emperor Jing (by Emperor Xuan's concubine Zhu Manyue. After defeating the general Yuchi Jiong, who rose against him, he had Yang Yong created the Duke of Changning and the commandant of Luoyang, with authority over all of the old territory of Northern Qi (which Emperor Xuan's father Emperor Wu destroyed in 577. He was, however, soon recalled to the capital Chang'an to serve as the minister of defense. In spring 581, Yang Jian had Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui dynasty as its Emperor Wen. Emperor Wen created Yang Yong crown prince. In the Book of Sui, Yang Yong was described as a studious and handsome gentleman who was known for his gracious demeanour, straightforwardness and generosity, and was respected by many. As crown prince = Early in Emperor Wen's reign = While Yang Yong was crown prince, it was clear that Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu favored his younger brother, their second son Yang Guang the Prince of Jin. In summer 581, Yang Yong's chief of staff Lu Ben (), trying to exploit this situation to gain Yang Yong's favor, tried to get Yang Yong involved in his plot to, jointly with several other officials, take over power from Emperor Wen's favored officials Gao Jiong and Su Wei. The plot was discovered, and Lu Ben and his associates were deposed, but Yang Yong was not punished. In winter 582, Emperor Wen, anticipating an attack from Tujue during the construction of his new capital Daxing, near Chang'an, had Yang Yong command troops and briefly posted at nearby Xianyang to defend the potential Tujue attack. In spring 586, the commoner Gao De () submitted a petition to Emperor Wen, suggesting that he pass the throne to Yang Yong and become retired emperor. Emperor Wen rejected the petition, but did not punish Gao. Subsequently, in summer 586, Emperor Wen again had Yang Yong posted to Luoyang, with authority over the surrounding provinces. In 589, Sui conquered rival Chen dynasty, unifying China. Yang Yong's brother Yang Guang, as the supreme commander over the entire operation, received many accolades. =Late in Emperor Wen's reign= Yang Yong was recorded as being lenient, kind, and honest in his nature, making few pretenses, but he favored luxuries, much to the chagrin of Emperor Wen, who favored frugality. Once, when Yang Yong made a highly decorated set of armor, Emperor Wen rebuked him, sending him an undecorated sword that Emperor Wen himself employed, as well as a box of miso, to remind him that prior to becoming crown prince, he had to settle for common items such as those. The relationship between Emperor Wen and Yang Yong was further strained when, at Dongzhi, Yang Yong openly welcomed officials to his palace, which Emperor Wen interpreted as Yang Yong's receiving submission from those officials‚Äîan act that Emperor Wen considered inappropriate as Yang Yong, while crown prince, was still an imperial subject. The relationship between Yang Yong and Empress Dugu also became strained, as Empress Dugu disfavored men who had many concubines (so much so that Emperor Wen did not have many concubines while she was still alive, and might not have had sexual relations even with the few concubines that he had during her lifetime), but Yang Yong, who did not favor his wife Crown Princess Yuan, had many concubines, particularly favoring the beautiful Consort Yun. Crown Princess Yuan, who did not have any sons with Yang Yong, died suddenly in 591, apparently from a heart ailment, but both Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu suspected foul play, and Empress Dugu particularly rebuked him. After Crown Princess Yuan's death, Consort Yun became effective mistress over the Crown Prince's palace, and she and the other concubines bore Yang Yong 10 sons in total, which made Empress Dugu exceedingly displeased, as she was even more displeased at men having children with their concubines. Yang Guang, who had ambitions of replacing Yang Yong, was meanwhile gaining the favors of both Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu by pretending to be frugal and loving only his wife Princess Xiao, which caused Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu to be further displeased with Yang Yong, by comparison. By 599, both Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu were considering replacing Yang Yong with Yang Guang. When Empress Dugu tried to see if she could have support in this proposition from Gao Jiong, Gao, whose son Gao Biaoren () married Yang Yong's daughter, stated his opposition, and this, coupled with Gao Jiong's own favor for a concubine after his wife's death, eventually caused Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu to deposed Gao Jiong from his influential posts in fall 599. Meanwhile, Yang Guang was conspiring with another highly influential official, the general Yang Su, with whom Yang Yong had a poor relationship. Yang Su thereafter praised Yang Guang repeatedly, causing Empress Dugu to further strengthen her relationship with him to try to have him persuade Emperor Wen to depose Yang Yong. Meanwhile, Yang Yong was beginning to realize Yang Guang's ambition, but his reaction‚Äîspending much time to try to have witches deflect ill fortune from him‚Äîfurther brought suspicion from Emperor Wen. As a final straw, Yang Guang bribed Yang Yong's associate Ji Wei () to make false accusations against Yang Guang, twisting Yang Guang's acts to appear treasonous. Yang Su then made public denunciations against Yang Yong, which Emperor Wen concurred in. In winter 600, Emperor Wen ordered that Yang Yong be deposed, and executed a number of officials who were close to Yang Yong or who dared to speak on his behalf. Yang Guang was created crown prince to replace Yang Yong. After removal Yang Yong was put under house arrest at his palace and still given proper supplies, but Yang Guang was put in charge of having Yang Yong guarded. Yang Yong made repeated requests to personally appeal to Emperor Wen, but each request was blocked by Yang Guang. Yang Yong, desperate, often climbed onto trees to holler at Emperor Wen's palace, seeking to have Emperor Wen hear his cries. However, when Emperor Wen heard the cries, Yang Su falsely reported that Yang Yong had become irreparably psychotic after his removal. As a result, Emperor Wen never saw Yang Yong again. In 602, Empress Dugu died. Thereafter, Emperor Wen began to have relationships with his concubines, particularly favoring Consort Chen (the sister of Chen's final emperor Chen Shubao) and Consort Cai. In either 602 or 603, after Yang Yong's younger brother Yang Xiu the Prince of Shu was similarly accused of crimes and deposed, the official Pei Su () submitted a petition to have Yang Yong and Yang Xiu be released from house arrest and given small fiefs, a proposal that Emperor Wen was tempted by, but ultimately did not accept. In summer 604, Emperor Wen, while visiting his vacation palace Renshou Palace (‰ªÅÂ£ΩÂÆÆ, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), grew gravely ill. Traditional historians allege (but admit that they did not have conclusive proof) that while Emperor Wen was growing ill, Yang Guang tried to rape Consort Chen. When Consort Chen revealed this to Emperor Wen, Emperor Wen became angry and wanted to depose Yang Guang and restore Yang Yong. However, Yang Guang and Yang Su had the two officials that Emperor Wen entrusted this task to‚ÄîLiu Shu (Êü≥Ëø∞, the husband to Yang Yong's sister Yang Awu () the Princess Lanling) and Yuan Yan () -- arrested, and Emperor Wen soon died, a death that most historians attribute to assassination by Yang Guang's associate Zhang Heng (). Emperor Wen's death was kept secret for eight days, before Yang Guang announced it and took the throne (as Emperor Yang). Emperor Yang sent Yang Su's brother Yang Yue () back to Daxing. Once Yang Yue was back at Daxing, he forged an edict from Emperor Wen, ordering Yang Yong to commit suicide. When Yang Yong refused, Yang Yue strangled him, and only after Yang Yong died declared Emperor Wen's death. Emperor Yang posthumously created Yang Yong the Prince of Fangling, but did not allow any of Yang Yong's sons, who were reduced to commoner rank when Yang Yong was deposed, to inherit the title. In 607, Emperor Yang had Yang Yong's sons put to death.  References  * Book of Sui, vol. 45. * History of the Northern Dynasties, vol. 71. * Zizhi Tongjian, 174, 175, 176, 178, 179, 180.

He was a son of Emperor Wen (Yang Jian) and his powerful wife Empress Dugu, who died as a result of an illness caused by poisoning by his jealous wife Princess Cui. His son Yang Hao was later briefly declared emperor by the general Yuwen Huaji after Yuwen killed his brother Emperor Yang in 618. Early life Yang Jun was born in 571. He was the third son of Yang Jian and Dugu Qieluo, after Yang Yong and Yang Guang. When Yang Jian seized the throne from Emperor Jing of Northern Zhou in 581, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui Dynasty as its Emperor Wen, he created his sons princes, and Yang Jun was created the Prince of Qin. In 582, Yang Jun, at age 11, was made the governor of Luo Province (Ê¥õÂ∑û, roughly modern Luoyang, Henan) and titularly the commander of the armed forces east of the Hangu Pass. In 583, he was made the commandant at Qin Province (Áß¶Â∑û, roughly modern Tianshui, Gansu) and was in charge of the surrounding provinces. It was around this time that Yang Jun began to be a devout Buddhist and became known for his kindness, and at one point he requested permission from Emperor Wen to become a monk, a request that Emperor Wen denied. Military and political career In 586, Yang Jun became the regional executive of the provinces south of the Qinling Mountains and was stationed at Xiangyang (Ë•ÑÈôΩ, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei). It was around this time that his wife Princess Cui (the sister of the general Cui Hongdu () gave birth to his first son Yang Hao. In 588, when Emperor Wen launched a major attack against rival Chen Dynasty, Yang Jun was stationed at Hankou (Êº¢Âè£, in modern Wuhan, Hubei) and made the commander of the Sui forces in the middle Yangtze River region. The Chen general Zhou Luohou () soon arrived to guard against Yang Jun, but Yang Jun, disliking the idea of major battle losses, chose not to engage Zhou, and they stalemated. Nevertheless, this stalemate prevented all Chen troops in the upper Yangtze region from being able to attend to the defense of the capital Jiankang, then attacked by forces under command of Yang Jun's brother Yang Guang. Soon, when news arrived that Jiankang had fallen and the Chen emperor Chen Shubao had been captured, Zhou surrendered. When Chen Shubao's brother Chen Shushen () and cousin Chen Zhengli () nevertheless tried to resist at Chen Shushen's post at Xiang Province (ÊπòÂ∑û, roughly modern Changsha, Hunan), the Sui generals Xue Zhou () and Liu Ren'en () attacked and captured Chen Shushen, delivering him to Yang Jun, and Yang Jun executed Chen Shushen. Yang Jun submitted a report to Emperor Wen in which he stated, \\"It is unfortunately that I am even given the task of grinding grains, as I contributed nothing to the war effort, and am ashamed of it.\\" Emperor Wen, however, was pleased with his humility and, when Chen Shubao and his clan were presented to Emperor Wen, they were preceded into the palace by the victorious Yang Guang and Yang Jun. Emperor Wen made Yang Jun the commandant at Yang Province (ÊèöÂ∑û, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), in charge of 44 provinces, most of which was formerly Chen territory. In 590, Emperor Wen swapped his assignment and Yang Guang's and made him the commandant at Bing Province (Âπ∂Â∑û, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), in charge of 24 provinces. Fall from grace While at Bing Province, however, Yang Jun began to live luxuriously, including building palaces beyond what was proper for an imperial prince. He also began to have many concubines, and his wife Princess Cui became jealous and could not tolerate what Yang Jun was doing. In 597, she poisoned melons that Yang Jun was eating, and he became so ill that he had to be taken back to Chang'an for treatment. It was then that his exceedingly wasteful living became known to Emperor Wen, who favored frugal lifestyles and was displeased with Yang Jun's wastefulness. In fall 597, Emperor Wen removed Yang Jun from all of his posts and returned him to his mansion only with the title of imperial prince. Soon thereafter, it was discovered that it was Princess Cui who poisoned Yang Jun, and Emperor Wen ordered a divorce between them, and then, after sending her back to her home, ordered her to commit suicide. The generals Liu Sheng () and Yang Su both believed that the punishment against Yang Jun was overly severe, but Emperor Wen responded to Yang Su: :I am the father of just five sons, not the father of all people over the land. If I agreed with you, does that mean I have to draft a Penal Code for the Emperor's Sons? Even a man as kind as the Duke of Zhou executed his brothers, the lords of Guan and Cai, for their crimes. I am nowhere as capable as the Duke of Zhou, so I can break my own laws? Emperor Wen therefore did not permit Yang Jun to return to service. Thereafter, Yang Jun's illness appeared to never get well, and by 600, he was extremely ill, and he sent messengers to deliver a petition to Emperor Wen, requesting forgiveness, but Emperor Wen refused. Only when Yang Jun was near death did Emperor Wen confer on him the honorific post of Shang Zhuguo (), an office that, in Sui's nine-rank system, was first rank, second class, but carried no authorities of its own. Death and legacy Yang Jun died in summer 600, and it was said that Emperor Wen only cried slightly before stopping. He ordered the overly luxurious items that Yang Jun made to be all destroyed. When Yang Jun's staff requested that a stone monument be erected for Yang Jun, Emperor Wen responded: :For a person to have a good name, only several pages in a history book would be sufficient. Why would he need a monument? If his descendants could not glorify him, the monument will only be broken into pieces to be paperweight. Yang Jun was survived by two sons‚ÄîYang Hao, the son of Princess Cui, and Yang Zhan (), born of a concubine. The imperial officials, anticipating that Emperor Wen would not favor having either of them inherit Yang Jun's title, recommended that neither be allowed‚Äîon the basis that Yang Hao had been tainted by Princess Cui's crimes, and that Yang Zhan, as the son of a concubine, should not inherit. Emperor Wen agreed, and had Yang Jun's staff serve as his mourners. Yang Jun's oldest daughter Princess Yongfeng was 11 at this time, and she mourned Yang Jun in a particularly devout manner that she was praised by historians. It was not until Yang Guang became emperor in 604 that Yang Hao was allowed to inherit the title of Prince of Qin and Yang Zhan was created the Marquess of Jibei.

Traditional historians generally believed that he was involved in the suspected murder of Emperor Wen in 604, at the behest of Emperor Wen's son Yang Guang (the later Emperor Yang). His son Yang Xuangan later rebelled against Emperor Yang in 613 but was defeated and killed, and Yang Su's other sons were also executed.  During Northern Zhou  It is not known when Yang Su was born. His grandfather Yang Xuan (Ê•äÂñß) was a mid-level official under the Northern Wei or its branch successor state Western Wei. Yang Su's father Yang Fu (Ê•äÊï∑) served as a general for Western Wei's successor state Northern Zhou, but in 571, while defending Dingyang (ÂÆöÈôΩ, in modern Linfen, Shanxi), Yang Fu was defeated and captured by the Northern Qi general Duan Shao (ÊÆµÈü∂). Yang Fu refused to surrender and was kept in captivity for the rest of his life, but it is not known when he died. After Yang Fu's death, Yang Su, who was considered highly talented in his youth, repeatedly sought posthumous recognition for his father from Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou. Eventually, Emperor Wu was so pestered that he ordered that Yang Su be killed‚Äîperhaps stating the order publicly to scare Yang Su so that he would relent. Instead of begging for forgiveness, however, Yang Su yelled out, \\"I serve a ruthless emperor, and it is proper for me to die!\\" Emperor Wu, impressed with Yang Su's fortitude, released him and gave Yang Fu posthumous honors, including the title of Duke of Linzhen. He made Yang Su an official in his administration, and once, when he had Yang Su draft an edict for him and was impressed by both the fast speed that Yang Su wrote the edict and the beauty of the language, he commented, \\"Just work hard. Honor and wealth will come to you.\\" Yang Su responded, \\"I am worried that I will be forced to accept honor and wealth, as I have no desire for them.\\" In 575, when Emperor Wu launched a major attack on Northern Qi, he granted Yang Su's request to lead the remains of Yang Fu's old army. While Emperor Wu was soon forced to abandon the campaign, Yang Su was, for his contributions, created the Viscount of Qinghe. When Emperor Wu relaunched the attack on Northern Qi in winter 576, Yang Su served under Emperor Wu's brother and major general Yuwen Xian the Prince of Qi, and during a battle, when Yuwen Xian was ambushed by forces under Northern Qi's emperor Gao Wei, it was Yang Su who fought hard to save Yuwen Xian. Thereafter, he continued to make contributions under Yuwen Xian during the campaign against Northern Qi. After Emperor Wu conquered Northern Qi in 577, he promoted Yang Su's title to Duke of Chen'an. In 578, he served under the general Wang Gui (ÁéãËªå) in defeating the Chen Dynasty general Wu Mingche, and for this contribution, Emperor Wu created his brother Yang Shen (Ê•äÊÖé) the Marquess of Yi'an. After Emperor Wu's death later in 578 and succession by his son Emperor Xuan, Emperor Xuan conferred the title of Duke of Linzhen, which Emperor Wu had posthumously created Yang Fu, on Yang Su, transferring Yang Su's title of Duke of Cheng'an to his brother Yang Yuƒì (Ê•äÁ¥Ñ). Yang Su subsequently served under the general Wei Xiaokuan in capturing the region between the Yangtze River and the Huai River from Chen. In 580, Emperor Xuan, who had by that point become retired emperor, died, and Emperor Xuan's father-in-law Yang Jian seized power as regent over Emperor Xuan's son Emperor Jing. Yang Su became close to Yang Jian, and Yang Jian made him the governor of the important Bian Province (Ê±¥Â∑û roughly modern Kaifeng, Henan). However, before Yang Su could report to Bian Province, the general Yuchi Jiong, suspicious of Yang Jian's intentions, rose against him. One of Yuchi's supporters, Yuwen Zhou (ÂÆáÊñáÂÜë) the governor of Ying Province (ÊªéÂ∑û roughly modern Zhengzhou, Henan) defended Hulao Pass against Yang Jian's forces, and Yang Jian sent Yang Su against Yuwen Zhou. Yang Su was able to defeat Yuwen Zhou, and after Yuchi had been defeated and had committed suicide, Yang Jian made Yang Su the commandant at Xu Province (ÂæêÂ∑û roughly modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) and promoted his title to Duke of Qinghe, transferring his title of Duke of Linzhen to his brother Yang Yu√® (Ê•äÂ≤≥ note different tone and character than the other brother).  During Emperor Wen's reign  In 581, Yang Jian had Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui Dynasty as its Emperor Wen. Yang Su continued to serve in Emperor Wen's administration including a spell helping prepare the Kaihuang Code on which Emperor Wen's legal reforms were based. In 584, during an argument with his wife Zheng Qiye (ÈÉëÁ•ÅËÄ∂), he angrily stated, \\"If I become emperor, you will not be empress!\\" Zheng Qiye, in anger, reported the comment to Emperor Wen, who removed Yang Su from his post as a punishment. In 585, Emperor Wen restored him and made him the commandant at Xin Province (modern eastern Chongqing) to prepare an attack against Chen down the Yangtze River. While at Xin Province, he built large ships in anticipation of the attack. In winter 588, Emperor Wen launched the attack, commissioning his sons Yang Guang the Prince of Jin and Yang Jun, along with Yang Su, to command the three main prongs of the attack, with Yang Guang in overall command of the operations. Yang Su's responsibility was to take his forces down the Yangtze and attack cities on the river. He passed through the Three Gorges and defeated the Chen general Qi Xin (ÊàöÊòï). He soon ran into heavy resistance by the Chen general L√º Zhongsu (ÂëÇÂø†ËÇÖ) and initially was repelled, but eventually was able to defeat L√º. With Chen Shubao's cousin Chen Huiji (Èô≥ÊÖßÁ¥Ä) abandoning the region to make one last-ditch attempt to reach the Chen capital Jiankang to help defend it against Yang Guang's attack, Yang Su encountered no further resistance, and soon news that Jiankang had fallen arrived, and the local provinces all surrendered to him or Yang Jun, whom he met at Hankou (Êº¢Âè£ in modern Wuhan, Hubei). Emperor Wen subsequently promoted Yang Su to the greater title of Duke of Yue and transferred his title of Duke of Qinghe to his son Yang Xuanjiang (Ê•äÁéÑÁçé), while making his heir apparent Yang Xuangan a mid-level official. He was briefly made the commandant at Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û roughly modern Jingzhou, Hubei), but in summer 588 was recalled to the capital to be the head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ Menxia Sheng) -- one of the most important officials in the imperial government. In 590, he was made the head of the legislative bureau (ÂÖßÂè≤ÁúÅ Neishi Sheng). Later in 590, with Chen's former territory up in rebellions against imposition of Sui laws, Yang Su was put in command of a large army to attack the various rebel leaders. He defeated Shen Xuanhui (Ê≤àÁéÑÊáÄ) and Gao Zhihui (È´òÊô∫ÊÖß), eventually quelling much of the former Chen territory. Emperor Wen awarded him with many gifts. Based on Yang Su's conduct during the campaign, the historian Sima Guang, in his Zizhi Tongjian, commented: :When Yang Su commanded large armies, he showed flexibility and much tactical capability. His military discipline was harsh, and before each battle, he always sought out soldiers who had faults to execute in order to show his power -- sometimes more than a hundred, and sometimes no less than 20. As their blood flowed before him, he treated as if it were nothing, and continued to smile and talk. When it came time for battling, he would send out somewhere between 100 to 200 soldiers as a forward corps to attack first. If they were unsuccessful in penetrating the enemy lines and returned, regardless of how many survived, they would all be executed. He would then repeat the process, but with 200 to 300 soldiers. All officers and soldiers tremored with fear, and all fought with resolution to fight to the death. Therefore, he was always victorious and considered a great general. At that time, Yang Su was powerful and favored by the emperor. Whatever he suggested was not refused, and so Yang Su's followers, even if their contributions were small, would be rewarded for their contributions. The soldiers under the other generals often had their contributions denied by the civilian officials and not rewarded. Therefore, even though Yang Su was cruel, his soldiers were willing to follow him. Around the new year 593, Yang Su was made a co-head of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ Shangshu Sheng) with Gao Jiong, effectively serving as co-prime ministers, replacing Su Wei in that role. It was said that by this point, Yang Su had become very arrogant, and among the officials, he only respected Gao, Niu Hong (ÁâõÂºò), and Xue Daoheng (ËñõÈÅìË°°), looking down at and bullying the rest. It was commented by traditional historians that he was more talented and had more foresight than Gao, but that he was not as fair-minded or well-behaved as Gao. In spring 593, Emperor Wen commissioned Yang Su to oversee the building of his vacation palace, Renshou Palace (‰ªÅÂ£ΩÂÆÆ in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). Yang Su spent much effort building it to be a luxurious palace, needing not much architectural work but landscaping of the nearby hills and valleys. Much human life was lost‚Äînumbering in the tens of thousands. The palace was completed in spring 595, and when Emperor Wen inspected it, he, by nature frugal, was initially displeased and stated, \\"Yang Su expended money and effort to build this palace, and he made the people hate me.\\" Yang Su was fearful of punishment, but when Emperor Wen's wife Empress Dugu arrived, she pointed out to Emperor Wen that Yang Su knew that they had little other pleasures, and therefore built the palace in this manner. She gave Yang Su awards in both money and silk. In 598, both Empress Dugu and Yang Su's wife Zheng Qiye were ill, and suspicions came on the official Dugu Tuo (Áç®Â≠§ÈôÄ)--who was Empress Dugu's half-brother and whose wife was Yang Su's half-sister. Dugu Tuo was accused of having his servant girl Xu Ani (ÂæêÈòøÂ∞º) employ cat spirits to curse Empress Dugu and Zheng Qiye, and was nearly executed, but at Empress Dugu's urging was spared and only reduced to commoner rank. In spring 599, Yang Su was one of the major generals commissioned to attack Tujue's Dulan Khan, Ashina Yongyul√º, along with Gao Jiong and Yan Rong (ÁáïÊ¶Æ). He encountered Ashina Yongyul√º's subordinate khan, the Datou Khan Ashina Dianjue. Contrary to prior strategies to first protect his army before engaging, he quickly engaged Ashina Dianjue and defeated him, forcing Ashina Dianjue to flee. Sometime around that time, Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu, who generally had a loving relationship, had a major conflict‚Äîover an affair by Emperor Wen (who otherwise did not have any concubines, in contrast with nearly every other emperor in Chinese history) with Yuchi Jiong's granddaughter, who had become a servant in the palace. Empress Dugu killed Lady Yuchi, and in anger, Emperor Wen rode away from the palace. Yang Su and Gao had to track him down and persuade him back to the palace. Yang Su and Gao subsequently held a banquet for them to allow them to reconcile. In winter 599, Emperor Wen sent Yang Su again to attack Ashina Yongyul√º, but before his army could depart, Ashina Yongyul√º was assassinated and replaced by Ashina Dianjue (as Bujia Khan), and so Yang Su did not launch his army. In 600, when Ashina Dianjue attacked, Emperor Wen sent Yang Su and Shi Wansui (Âè≤Ëê¨Ê≠≤), along with his sons Yang Guang and Yang Liang, to resist, and Ashina Dianjue was fought off. (The historians had much to say as to Shi's success during this campaign, but not Yang Su's, suggesting that Yang Su was not involved in major engagements during this campaign.) By 600, Emperor Wen's crown prince Yang Yong had lost the favor of Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu, over his wastefulness (which displeased Emperor Wen) and having many concubines (which displeased Empress Dugu). Yang Guang, whom Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu, had for some time plotted to replace Yang Yong, sent his associate Yuwen Shu to persuade Yang Su's brother Yang Yuƒì that, as Yang Su did not have a good relationship with Yang Yong, that if Emperor Wen died, Yang Su and his brothers would soon be in danger under Yang Yong's rule. Rather, Yuwen suggested, Yang Su should form a pact with Yang Guang and try to have Yang Guang made crown prince. Yang Su agreed, and began to discuss with Empress Dugu in earnest the possibility of replacing Yang Yong with Yang Guang. Empress Dugu was pleased, and requested Yang Su to persuade Emperor Wen as well. By fall 600, Yang Guang had Yang Yong's associate Ji Wei (Âß¨Â®Å) falsely accuse Yang Yong of plotting treason. Emperor Wen commissioned Yang Su to investigate, and Yang Su intentionally misinterpreted evidence and manufactured additional evidence, causing Emperor Wen to believe that Yang Yong was indeed plotting treason. Emperor Wen deposed Yang Yong and created Yang Guang crown prince instead. In winter 601, Emperor Wen commissioned Yang Su to command an army, in association with Qimin Khan Ashina Rangan (who had surrendered to Sui and whom Emperor Wen had created khan), to attack Ashina Dianjue. In spring 602, Yang Su achieved a great victory, and for his victory, Yang Xuangan's post was upgraded, and another son of Yang Su, Yang Xuanzong (Ê•äÁéÑÁ∏±), was created the Duke of Huainan. By 602, Yang Guang was concerned that his brother, Yang Xiu the Prince of Shu, who as the commandant at Yi Province (roughly modern Chengdu, Sichuan) was in control of the modern Sichuan and Chongqing region, would eventually make trouble for him. He had Yang Su collect evidence of Yang Xiu's wastefulness and inappropriate behavior. Emperor Wen summoned Yang Xiu back to the capital, and had Yang Su investigate. Both Yang Guang and Yang Su manufactured additional evidence against Yang Xiu, and Yang Xiu was reduced to commoner rank and put under house arrest. Also in 602, Empress Dugu died. Yang Su was in charge of the funeral arrangements, and in appreciation, Emperor Wen created yet another son of Yang Su the Duke of Yikang. Upon accusations by the official Liang Pi (Ê¢ÅÊØó) that Yang Su was becoming overly powerful and abusive, Emperor Wen began to distance himself from Yang Su, although he continued to confer honors on Yang Su. The actual authority over the executive bureau was instead exercised by Su Wei and Emperor Wen's son-in-law Liu Shu (Êü≥Ëø∞). In summer 604, while at Renshou Palace, Emperor Wen became ill. Yang Su, Liu, and Yuan Yan (ÂÖÉÂÑº) attended to him. Emperor Wen soon died, and Yang Guang, after ordering Yang Su's brother Yang Yuƒì to have Yang Yong killed, announced Emperor Wen's death and took the throne as Emperor Yang. Traditional historians, while admitting a lack of direct evidence, largely believed an account that Emperor Wen's death was a murder ordered by Yang Guang, with Yang Su in cooperation. This account alleged that Yang Guang attempted to rape Emperor Wen's concubine Consort Chen (Chen Shubao's sister), and when Consort Chen reported the attempted rape to Emperor Wen, Emperor Wen tried to depose Yang Guang and sent Liu and Yuan to summon Yang Yong. Yang Su arrested Liu and Yuan, and then Yang Guang sent his associate Zhang Heng (ÂºµË°°) to kill Emperor Wen.  During Emperor Yang's reign  Upon hearing Emperor Yang's ascension, Yang Liang, then the commandant at Bing Province (Âπ∂Â∑û roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) and in control of the territory north of the Yellow River, rebelled‚Äîinexplicably declaring, as his reason for rebelling, that Yang Su had committed treason. Emperor Yang sent Yang Su to attack Yang Liang, and Yang Su, after capturing Yang Liang's general Xiao Mohe, forced Yang Liang's surrender. For Yang Su's contributions, Emperor Yang gave his sons Yang Wandan (Ê•äËê¨Áü≥), Yang Renxing (Ê•ä‰ªÅË°å), and Yang Xuanting (Ê•äÁéÑÊå∫) all mid-level imperial posts and much treasure, previously owned by Yang Liang. In spring 605, Emperor Yang began to expand Luoyang to serve as the eastern capital. Yang Su was commissioned to head the project. It was said that although Yang Su had much contributions for him, Emperor Yang actually was very suspicious of Yang Su. When imperial astrologers informed Emperor Yang that the Sui region (central Hubei) would have a major funeral, Emperor Wen created Yang Su the Duke of Chu, technically a greater title‚Äîbelieving that the Chu and Sui regions were close enough that he could use Yang Su to deflect the ill fortune. When Yang Su grew ill in 606, Yang Guang sent the imperial physicians, along with the most precious medicines, to treat Yang Su, but closely monitored Yang Su's conditions, hoping that Yang Su would die. Yang Su himself knew of Emperor Yang's intentions, and therefore refused all treatment and did not take good care of his own body, stating to Yang Yue, \\"Why should I want to live?\\" He died in fall 606, and Emperor Yang honored him with a magnificent funeral. After Yang Xuangan rebelled in 613, all of Yang Su's sons were killed. Yang Su's tomb was destroyed, and Yang Su's body was burned by the general Wei Wensheng (Ë°õÊñáÊòá). But one daughter of his would later become a concubine of Emperor Gaozu of Tang and bear him a son named Li Yuanxiang (ÊùéÂÖÉÁ••) and titled Prince of Jiang, while his granddaughter through his son Yang Xuanjing would become a concubine of Emperor Taizong of Tang and bear him a son named Li Fu (ÊùéÁ¶è) and titled Prince of Zhao. It was said that one of Yang Su's favorite dishes was fried rice and that he popularized the dish.Êñ∞ËèØÁ∂≤ÂêâÊûóÈ†ªÈÅì¬∑ÁæéÈ£ü In the Book of Sui, Yang Su was described as a man with imposing look and a shiny long beard.

Biography =Early life and education in Europe (1885‚Äì1906= Poole was born on 16 August 1885 in Easebourne, Sussex, England, the youngest son of Stanley Lane-Poole, an Egyptologist, and his wife Charlotte. His brother Richard was a senior officer in the Royal Navy. In 1900 his father took up a professorship at Trinity College Dublin, moving the family with him, and Lane Poole began attending school at St Columba's College the next year. He then undertook an engineering course, but dropped out after losing his left hand in a shooting accident. He switched to forestry science, graduating from the French National School of Forestry in 1906. =Africa (1906‚Äì1916= After Lane Poole's graduation from the French National School of Forestry, the British government sent him to South Africa, where he initially spent a year at the South African Forest School. He began working as a forest officer in Transvaal in May 1907, and was then appointed as District Forest Officer at Woodbush Forest, near Haenertsburg. He resigned from this position in June 1910, citing disagreement with the government's policies. In November 1910 he was posted as a forest officer to Sierra Leone. While on leave in Dublin in July 1911, he married Ruth (n√©e Pollexfen), an interior designer who later furnished The Lodge and Government House in Canberra, and was a cousin of W. B. Yeats. She stayed in Ireland when he returned to Sierra Leone, where he became the Conservator of Forests and a member of the Legislative Council, among other things establishing the forestry department and setting up the first forest reserves. =Western Australia (1916‚Äì1921)= In 1916, Lane Poole was appointed as Western Australia's Conservator of Forests, and moved to the Perth suburb of Cottesloe with his wife and daughter in their first home together.Dargavel, John. Australian National Botanic Gardens. Charles Lane Poole. Originally published in issue 32, summer 2006‚Äì2007, of Momento, National Archives of Australia. He formulated the Forests Act (1918), established a new Forests Department, and began long-term planning for sustainable use of timber. In Ludlow, he set up a forestry settlement along with Ludlow Forestry School (1921‚Äì1927), the first forestry school in Western Australia. When the Western Australian authorities would not heed his advice, he resigned in protest in 1921. Shortly afterwards, Ruth returned to Ireland with the couple's two daughters. =Papua and New Guinea (1921‚Äì1925)= The Australian timber industry pressured the national government to hire Lane Poole to survey the existing timber resources in Papua, then an Australian territory, and later in New Guinea. He spent three years surveying the Papuan and New Guinea forests, from the lowlands to the highlands; he surveyed the country, measured trees, and collected specimens. Although he did not find the stands of timber that could be harvested on a large scale, his extensive notes on such forest products as resin, oils and nuts helped identify other possible avenues of commercial development. His third and youngest daughter was born while he was in Papua. After the missionary Christian Keyser, he was one of the first Europeans to climb the Saruwaged Massif. =Melbourne, Canberra, and later life in Sydney (1925‚Äì1970)= In 1925 Lane Pool moved with his family to the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra, where he was appointed Forestry Adviser for the Commonwealth, on the recommendation of Western Australian senator George Pearce. In 1927 he was appointed Commonwealth Inspector-General of Forests and Acting Principal of the Australian Forestry School, which he had established and strongly campaigned for. The Lane Pooles move to Canberra in late 1927 and by early 1928 they were living in Yarralumla in Westridge House, the forestry school principal's official residence, which had been designed for them by Harold Desbrowe-Annear with Ruth's input regarding the interiors. The Australian Forestry School, which was later amalgamated into the Australian National University, trained many of Australia's professional foresters. He retired from the Australian Forestry School in 1944 and from the Commonwealth government in 1945, after which he moved to the Sydney suburb of Manly and carried out consulting work. He died on 22 November 1970, aged 87, in Sydney; his body was cremated.  Legacy  The author Mervyn Millet described his friend and mentor as the father of national forestry in Australia, as its first Inspector-General of Forests and in advancing education on management practices. A large reservation of jarrah forest is named in his honour: the Lane Pool Reserve is about from Perth, and contains the old milling town of Nanga Brook. The species Eucalyptus lane-poolei and Cycas lane-poolei were named in his honour.

In these experiments two or more particles are created from the same initial packet of energy, inexorably linking/entangling their physical properties. Separate particle detectors measure the quantum states of each particle and send the resulting signal to a coincidence counter. In any experiment studying entanglement, the entangled particles are vastly outnumbered by non-entangled particles which are also detected; patternless noise that drowns out the entangled signal. In a two detector system, a coincidence counter alleviates this problem by only recording detection signals that strike both detectors simultaneously (or more accurately, recording only signals that arrive at both detectors and correlate to the same emission time). This ensures that the data represents only entangled particles. However, since no detector/counter circuit has infinitely precise temporal resolution (due both to limitations in the electronics and the laws of the Universe itself), detections must be sorted into time bins (detection windows equivalent to the temporal resolution of the system). Detections in the same bin appear to occur at the same time because their individual detection times cannot be resolved any further. Thus in a two detector system, two unrelated, non-entangled particles may randomly strike both detectors, get sorted into the same time bin, and create a false- coincidence that adds noise to the signal. This limits coincidence counters to improving the signal to noise ratio to the extent that the quantum behavior can be studied, without removing the noise completely. Every experiment to date that has been used to calculate Bell's inequalities, perform a quantum eraser, or conduct any experiment utilizing quantum entanglement as an information channel has only been possible through the use of coincidence counters. This unavoidably prevents superluminal communication since, even if a random or purposeful decision appears to be affecting events that have already transpired (as in the delayed choice quantum eraser), the signal from the past cannot be seen/decoded until the coincidence circuit has correlated both the past and future behavior. Thus the \\"signal\\" in the past is only visible after it is \\"sent\\" from the future, precluding quantum entanglement from being exploited for the purposes of faster-than-light communication or data time travel.

In this type of reactor, a fluid (gas or liquid) is passed through a solid granular material (usually a catalyst possibly shaped as tiny spheres) at high enough speeds to suspend the solid and cause it to behave as though it were a fluid. This process, known as fluidization, imparts many important advantages to an FBR. As a result, FBRs are used for many industrial applications. Basic diagram of a fluidized bed reactor Basic principles The solid substrate (the catalytic material upon which chemical species react) material in the fluidized bed reactor is typically supported by a porous plate, known as a distributor.Howard, J. R. (1989). Fluidized Bed Technology: Principles and Applications. New York, NY: Adam Higler. The fluid is then forced through the distributor up through the solid material. At lower fluid velocities, the solids remain in place as the fluid passes through the voids in the material. This is known as a packed bed reactor. As the fluid velocity is increased, the reactor will reach a stage where the force of the fluid on the solids is enough to balance the weight of the solid material. This stage is known as incipient fluidization and occurs at this minimum fluidization velocity. Once this minimum velocity is surpassed, the contents of the reactor bed begin to expand and swirl around much like an agitated tank or boiling pot of water. The reactor is now a fluidized bed. Depending on the operating conditions and properties of solid phase various flow regimes can be observed in this reactor. History and current uses Fluidized bed reactors are a relatively new tool in the chemical engineering field. The first fluidized bed gas generator was developed by Fritz Winkler in Germany in the 1920s.Tavoulareas, S. (1991.) Fluidized-Bed Combustion Technology. **Annual Reviews Inc.** 16, 25-27. One of the first United States fluidized bed reactors used in the petroleum industry was the Catalytic Cracking Unit, created in Baton Rouge, LA in 1942 by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (now ExxonMobil). This FBR and the many to follow were developed for the oil and petrochemical industries. Here catalysts were used to reduce petroleum to simpler compounds through a process known as cracking. The invention of this technology made it possible to significantly increase the production of various fuels in the United States. Today, fluidized bed reactors are still used to produce gasoline and other fuels, along with many other chemicals. Many industrially produced polymers are made using FBR technology, such as rubber, vinyl chloride, polyethylene, styrenes, and polypropylene. Various utilities also use FBRs for coal gasification, nuclear power plants, and water and waste treatment settings. Used in these applications, fluidized bed reactors allow for a cleaner, more efficient process than previous standard reactor technologies. Advantages The increase in fluidized bed reactor use in today's industrial world is largely due to the inherent advantages of the technology.Trambouze, P., & Euzen, J. (2004). Chemical Reactors: From Design to Operation. (R. Bononno, Trans.). Paris: Editions Technip. * Uniform particle mixing: Due to the intrinsic fluid-like behavior of the solid material, fluidized beds do not experience poor mixing as in packed beds. This complete mixing allows for a uniform product that can often be hard to achieve in other reactor designs. The elimination of radial and axial concentration gradients also allows for better fluid-solid contact, which is essential for reaction efficiency and quality. * Uniform temperature gradients: Many chemical reactions require the addition or removal of heat. Local hot or cold spots within the reaction bed, often a problem in packed beds, are avoided in a fluidized situation such as an FBR. In other reactor types, these local temperature differences, especially hotspots, can result in product degradation. Thus FBRs are well suited to exothermic reactions. Researchers have also learned that the bed-to-surface heat transfer coefficients for FBRs are high. * Ability to operate reactor in continuous state: The fluidized bed nature of these reactors allows for the ability to continuously withdraw product and introduce new reactants into the reaction vessel. Operating at a continuous process state allows manufacturers to produce their various products more efficiently due to the removal of startup conditions in batch processes. Disadvantages As in any design, the fluidized bed reactor does have its draw-backs, which any reactor designer must take into consideration. * Increased reactor vessel size: Because of the expansion of the bed materials in the reactor, a larger vessel is often required than that for a packed bed reactor. This larger vessel means that more must be spent on initial capital costs. * Pumping requirements and pressure drop: The requirement for the fluid to suspend the solid material necessitates that a higher fluid velocity is attained in the reactor. In order to achieve this, more pumping power and thus higher energy costs are needed. In addition, the pressure drop associated with deep beds also requires additional pumping power. * Particle entrainment: The high gas velocities present in this style of reactor often result in fine particles becoming entrained in the fluid. These captured particles are then carried out of the reactor with the fluid, where they must be separated. This can be a very difficult and expensive problem to address depending on the design and function of the reactor. This may often continue to be a problem even with other entrainment reducing technologies. * Lack of current understanding: Current understanding of the actual behavior of the materials in a fluidized bed is rather limited. It is very difficult to predict and calculate the complex mass and heat flows within the bed. Due to this lack of understanding, a pilot plant for new processes is required. Even with pilot plants, the scale-up can be very difficult and may not reflect what was experienced in the pilot trial. * Erosion of internal components: The fluid-like behavior of the fine solid particles within the bed eventually results in the wear of the reactor vessel. This can require expensive maintenance and upkeep for the reaction vessel and pipes. * Pressure loss scenarios: If fluidization pressure is suddenly lost, the surface area of the bed may be suddenly reduced. This can either be an inconvenience (e.g. making bed restart difficult), or may have more serious implications, such as runaway reactions (e.g. for exothermic reactions in which heat transfer is suddenly restricted). Current research and trends Due to the advantages of fluidized bed reactors, a large amount of research is devoted to this technology. Most current research aims to quantify and explain the behavior of the phase interactions in the bed. Specific research topics include particle size distributions, various transfer coefficients, phase interactions, velocity and pressure effects, and computer modeling.Arastoopour, H. (Ed.). (1998). Fluidization and Fluid Particle Systems: Recent Research and Development. New York, NY: American Institute of Chemical Engineers. The aim of this research is to produce more accurate models of the inner movements and phenomena of the bed. This will enable chemical engineers to design better, more efficient reactors that may effectively deal with the current disadvantages of the technology and expand the range of FBR use.

Originally established in 1954 and corporatized in 2002, TOT used to be known as the Telephone Organization of Thailand and TOT Corporation Public Company Limited. TOT's main line of business is fixed line telephony, although it has several other businesses, including mobile telephony. Its current president is Mr Monchai Noosong, appointed to the post on 16 November 2015. Early history The first use of the telephone in Thailand began during the reign of King Rama V in 1881 with a telephone line constructed between the Bangkok, and Paknam, in Samut Prakan, a short distance south of Bangkok along the Chao Phraya River. Its purpose was informing Bangkok of the arrival and departure of ships at Paknam.Thai National Archives The Telephone Organization of Thailand was founded by the Thai government on 24 February 1954. A state enterprise under the Ministry of Transport and Communications, it incorporated the Telephone Technician Unit under The Post and Telegraph Department. It originally had 732 staff members and a budget of 50 million baht. The TOT provided telephone services in the Bangkok metropolis, which included Wat Lieb, Bang Rak, Ploenchit, and Sam Sen Exchanges.TOT, About TOT TOT was transformed from a state-owned enterprise under the control of the Transport and Communication Ministry to a public company named TOT Corporation Public on 31 July 2002. Corporate status change and the aftermath of the 2006 coup Under the deposed government of Thaksin Shinawatra (2001‚Äì2006), TOT became a corporation and plans were under way to privatise a portion of the state enterprise through an IPO on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. These plans were cancelled after the Thaksin government was overthrown by a coup on 19 September 2006. Soon after the coup, the junta of General Surayud Chulanont announced plans to merge TOT with rival state telecom enterprise CAT Telecom (formerly the Communications Authority of Thailand).The Nation, Call for end to policy corruption, 16 October 2006 The junta also appointed junta Assistant Secretary-General General Saprang Kalayanamitr as the new Chairman of the Board of Directors of TOT. General Saprang's first move as TOT Chairman was to hand-pick three Army colonels and controversial Thaksin-critic Vuthiphong Priebjrivat to sit on the state enterprise's board of directors. The junta cancelled the Thaksin government's telecom excise tax policy. The Thaksin government had imposed an excise tax on privately offered fixed and cellular services, and then allowed telecom companies to deduct the amount they paid in excise tax from concession fees they had to pay to state concession owners TOT and CAT Telecom. The amount paid by the private telecom firms did not change. The Surayud government's excise tax cancellation meant that TOT and CAT Telecom would receive their full concession payments. However, TOT and CAT were then forced to increase their dividends to the Ministry of Finance to account for their increased income.The Nation, Telecom excise tax revoked , 24 January 2007 In December 2009, TOT became Thailand‚Äôs first 3G mobile phone service provider, launching 3G mobile phone service (Phase 1) via the brand TOT3G, by enhancing 584 base stations in Bangkok and its vicinity to accommodate 500,000 numbers for the service and with a goal of nationwide coverage by the end of 2011.

She was selected to the post of interim president and CEO of the NAACP to replace Benjamin Jealous, assuming that role on November 1, 2013. Replacing Karen L. Haas in February 2007, she was the first African American to serve as an official of the United States House of Representatives. Miller left her post as clerk at the start of the 112th Congress on January 5, 2011. She was replaced with her predecessor, Karen L. Haas. Prior to being appointed to the Clerk post, she served as the director of intergovernmental relations for then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. This was a senior position akin to the position of Deputy Chief of Staff and senior policy advisors. In her tenure in the public service, Miller has served in a number of positions in both the legislative and executive branches. Pelosi is the third Democratic Speaker of the House that Miller will be working for, having worked for Tom Foley and Jim Wright in the past. In addition, she worked under Rep. John Lewis of Georgia. During the Clinton Administration, Miller served as a Deputy Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs; in the late 1990s, she transitioned to her role as Bureau Chief of Consumer Information for the Federal Communications Commission. Prior to her service in the FCC, she served as director of government relations for the Federal Trade Commission. Miller has also served as the president of the Washington D.C. chapter of the NAACP since 2004. As the Clerk of the House she received a salary of $163,700 a year.\\"Fort Worth native named to serve as clerk of U.S. House\\" STAR-TELEGRAM 1/31/07 References External links * Category:20th-century births Category:1948 births Category:Clerks of the United States House of Representatives Category:Clinton administration personnel Category:Living people Category:NAACP activists Category:People from Fort Worth, Texas Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Lorraine Miller"},{"id":"9517390","text":"The Roman Catholic Diocese of Puerto Plata () (erected 16 December 1996) is a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Santiago de los Caballeros.

He was a key advisor to Emperor Wen of Sui and instrumental in the campaign against rival the Chen Dynasty, allowing Sui to destroy Chen in 589 and reunify China. In 607, he offended Emperor Wen's son Emperor Yang of Sui (Yang Guang) by criticizing Emperor Yang's large rewards to Tujue's submissive Qimin Khan and was executed by Emperor Yang.

Cities of Aristocrats and Bureaucrats. https://books.google.com/books?id=BIgS4p8NykYC&pg;=PA44  Background  It is not known when Gao Jiong was born. His father Gao Bin (È´òÂÆæ/È´òË≥ì) was an official of Eastern Wei who, in 540, fearful of false accusations against him, fled to Western Wei. Gao Bin served on the staff of the Xianbei general Dugu Xin, and on the orders of Western Wei's paramount general Yuwen Tai in 554, changed his family name to Dugu as well. Because of this connection, after Dugu Xin was forced to commit suicide in 557 after the founding of Western Wei's successor state Northern Zhou, Dugu Xin's daughter Dugu Qieluo often visited Gao Bin's home. Gao Bin eventually served as a provincial governor and died during such a posting. Gao Jiong was himself skilled in history and rhetoric while young. When he was 16, Yuwen Xian the Prince of Qi made Gao Jiong a member of his staff. He inherited the title of Count of Wuyang that had been created for his father. He apparently served under Yuwen Xian when Yuwen Xian was a major general in the campaign of his brother Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou in destroying rival Northern Qi, (Eastern Wei's successor state) and was promoted to a mid-level post in the imperial government. In 580, after the death of Emperor Wu's son Emperor Xuan, Emperor Xuan's father-in-law Yang Jian (Dugu Qieluo's husband) seized power as regent over Emperor Xuan's son Emperor Jing (by Emperor Xuan's concubine Zhu Manyue). Yang Jian, knowing that Gao was intelligent and full of strategies, sent his associate Yang Hui the Duke of Yu to request that Gao join his staff. Gao, seeing that Yang had great ambitions, responded, \\"I am willing to be driven by him. Even if the Duke's ambitions could not be carried out, I am willing to have my clan slaughtered over this.\\" He therefore agreed to serve as Yang's secretary. When the general Yuchi Jiong, suspicious of Yang's intentions, rebelled at Xiang Province (Áõ∏Â∑û, roughly modern Handan, Hebei), Yang needed someone to oversee the operations against Yuchi, but his associates Cui Zhongfang (Â¥î‰ª≤Êñπ), Liu Fang (ÂäâÊòâ), and Zheng Yi (ÈÑ≠Ë≠Ø) each declined. Gao volunteered, and he not oversaw the operations but also personally defeated Yuchi's son Yuchi Chun (Â∞âÈÅ≤Ê∑≥). After the major general Wei Xiaokuan defeated Yuchi Jiong and forced Yuchi Jiong to commit suicide, Gao Jiong was created the Duke of Yi'ning. (As Yang soon declared that Yuwen Tai's system of requiring Chinese officials and generals to change their names to Xianbei should be rescinded, Gao after this point did not use the family name Dugu any more.)  During Emperor Wen's reign  In 581, Yang Jian had Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui Dynasty as its Emperor Wen. He reorganized his government into five major bureaus, and Gao served as both the head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) and the co-head of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng) -- effectively serving as co-prime minister. He was created the Duke of Bohai, and few officials could rival him in terms of Emperor Wen's trust, shown by Gao's appointment as one of the officials in charge of the hengy legal reforms enacted in the Kaihuang Code. Emperor Wen often referred to him honorifically as simply \\"Mr. Dugu\\" (using his old Xianbei name) without mentioning his given name. Gao recommended Su Wei to Emperor Wen, and Emperor Wen trusted Su as well, eventually promoting Su to be co-prime minister. Whenever other officials made accusations against Gao, Emperor Wen deposed those officials. He also gave a daughter of his son and crown prince Yang Yong to Gao's son Gao Biaoren (È´òË°®‰ªÅ) in marriage. In 582, Emperor Wen had Gao oversee an operation against rival Chen Dynasty, but when Emperor Xuan of Chen died in early 582, Gao suggested that it was improper to attack a state that had just lost its emperor, and Emperor Wen agreed and withdrew the troops. Later in 582, it was after consulting Gao and Su that Emperor Wen, who had felt that the city of Chang'an, his capital, was too small, constructed a new capital nearby named Daxing (Â§ßËàà), where he moved the capital in 583. In fall 583, Emperor Wen sent Gao and Yu Qingze (ËôûÊÖ∂Ââá) to attack Tujue. In 587, while Sui's vassal Emperor Jing of Western Liang was at Daxing, Emperor Jing's uncle Xiao Yan (Ëï≠Â∑ñ) and brother Xiao Huan (Ëï≠Áìõ), in charge of his capital Jiangling, feared that the Sui general Cui Hongdu (Â¥îÂºòÂ∫¶) was going attack, and therefore took the people of Jiangling and surrendered to the Chen general Chen Huiji (Èô≥ÊÖßÁ¥Ä, the cousin of Chen's emperor Chen Shubao). In response, Emperor Wen abolished Western Liang and took its territory under direct control. He sent Gao to Jiangling to comfort the people of the region. Meanwhile, when Emperor Wen asked Gao for tactics in preparing to conquer Chen, Gao suggested harassing Chen's border regions in two ways: sending troops on exercise without actually attacking, to cause Chen's farmers to be on alert and unable to farm and causing Chen's guards to be down when an actual attack would come; and to send spies to burn Chen's border farmlands. Emperor Wen agreed, and these tactics helped damage Chen's resistance capabilities. In winter 588, Emperor Wen declared the campaign against Chen. He made Yang Su and his sons Yang Guang the Prince of Jin and Yang Jun the Prince of Qin the commanders of the three main prongs of the operation, with Yang Guang in overall command. Gao served as Yang Guang's deputy and was responsible for the strategies used in the campaign. When Chen's capital Jiankang fell in spring 589 and the emperor Chen Shubao was captured, Yang Guang ordered that Chen Shubao's concubine Consort Zhang Lihua be spared‚Äîperhaps because he wanted to take Consort Zhang as his own concubine. Instead, Gao, comparing Consort Zhang to Daji‚Äîthe wicked wife of King Zhou of Shang‚Äîbeheaded her. Yang Guang thereafter resented Gao greatly, stating sarcastically, \\"It has been said, 'You should repay every good deed done to you.' I will repay Duke Gao later.\\" Gao was responsible for collecting Chen's imperial stores, and was said to be exceedingly scrupulous at it, taking nothing for himself. For Gao's contributions, Emperor Wen promoted him to the greater title of Duke of Qi and awarded him with much silk. When Emperor Wen told him and the general Heruo Bi (Ë≥ÄËã•Âºº) to compare their contributions, Gao declined, stating that Heruo fought on the battlefield while he was merelyl serving as a civilian, and could not compare himself to Heruo. Emperor Wen was impressed and honored Gao even more. However, when Emperor Wen wanted to create the official Li Delin a duke as well for his contributions, as Gao had consulted Li during the campaign, Gao persuaded Emperor Wen not to, apparently out of jealousy for Li. In 592, Su was removed from his post as co-prime minister, and Yang Su replaced Su. It was commented by traditional historians that Yang Su was more talented and had more foresight than Gao, but that he was not as fairminded or well-behaved as Gao. In 598, angry that Ying Province (ÁáüÂ∑û, roughly modern Zhaoyang, Liaoning) had been attacked by Goguryeo, Emperor Wen send his son Yang Liang and the general Wang Shiji (Áéã‰∏ñÁ©ç) to attack Goguryeo‚Äîa campaign that Gao tried to dissuade Emperor Wen from but Emperor Wen launched anyway, and in fact forced Gao to serve as Yang Liang's deputy. Due to Yang Liang's young age, Gao was actually in charge of the operation, which ended in failure due to inadequate food supplies due to drought, as well as a storm destroying a large part of the fleet commanded by the former Chen general Zhou Luohou (Âë®ÁæÖÁù∫). Yang Liang, disgruntled at how Gao gave him little actual authority on the campaign and frequently disobeyed him, complained to Empress Dugu that he was fortunate to not have been killed by Gao, and this angered Emperor Wen as well. Meanwhile, the relationships between Gao and the imperial couple were breaking down for other reasons as well. Earlier, there had been a confrontation between Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu over Emperor Wen's sexual relationship with Yuchi Jiong's granddaughter (who had become a palace servant) and Empress Dugu's subsequent killing of Lady Yuchi. Emperor Wen was so angry that he rode away from the palace, requiring Gao and Yang Su to track him down. At Gao and Yang Su's urging, Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu reconciled over a feast that Gao and Yang Su hosted. However, while persuading Emperor Wen to return to the palace, Gao referred to Empress Dugu as \\"a woman,\\" which, when she found out, she was displeased with. Further, by this point, Yang Yong had lost Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu's favor, over his wastefulness (which displeased Emperor Wen) and having many concubines (which displeased Empress Dugu). Gao, who had also drawn Empress Dugu's ire for having a favorite concubine, thereafter came under suspicion by Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu of being overly supportive of Yang Yong, as he rejected outright the possibility that Yang Yong should be displaced by Yang Guang. In 599, when Emperor Wen sent Gao, Yang Su, and Yan Rong (ÁáïÊ¶Æ) against Tujue's Dulan Khan Ashina Yongyul√º, Gao, while on the campaign, requested additional troops, leading to suspicion by Emperor Wen that he was planning a rebellion, but Gao soon returned from the campaign, temporary assuaging Emperor Wen's fears. However, later in 599, after Wang Shiji was executed over suspicions of treason, accusations arose during the investigation of Wang's case that he had heard many palace secrets from Gao. Thereafter, Gao and two other high level officials, Yuan Min (ÂÖÉÊóª) and Yuan Zhou (ÂÖÉÂÜë), were accused of accepting bribes from Wang, and Yuan Min and Yuan Zhou were removed from their posts. When several other officials, including Heruo, Yuwen Bi (ÂÆáÊñáÂºº), Xue Zhou (ËñõÂÜë), Hul√º Xiaoqing (ÊñõÂæãÂ≠ùÂçø), and Liu Shu (Êü≥Ëø∞), tried to speak on Gao's behalf, Emperor Wen was so angry at them that he briefly threw them all into jail. Soon, Gao was found guilty and removed from his governmental posts, but allowed to keep his title of Duke of Qi. Soon thereafter, however, Gao was accused of comparing himself to Sima Yi, and was reduced to commoner rank. He thereafter was powerless to prevent Yang Yong's removal and replacement by Yang Guang in 600.  During Emperor Yang's reign  Gao Jiong's activities for the next several years were not clear. In 604, Emperor Wen died‚Äîa death that most traditional historians, while admitting a lack of direct evidence, believed to be a murder ordered by Yang Guang‚Äîand Yang Guang took the throne as Emperor Yang. Sometime after Emperor Yang took the throne, he made Gao the minister of ceremonies. When Emperor Yang ordered, in 606, that the former palace musicians from Northern Qi and Northern Zhou be regathered (Emperor Wen, who disfavored music, had disbanded the palace music corps), Gao opposed, without effect. In 607, when Emperor Yang gave great rewards to Tujue's submissive Qimin Khan Ashina Rangan, Gao again opposed, with no effect. It was said that Gao made several comments critical of Emperor Yang's policies, including a comment to his secretary Li Yi (ÊùéÊáø), \\"Zhou's Emperor Tianyuan [i.e., Emperor Xuan] destroyed his dynasty over his favor for dances, music, and crafts. The example of his spilled wagon is just in the short past, and how is it that it is being repeated?\\" He told He Chou (‰ΩïÁ®†), the minister of palace storage, as to Ashina Rangan, \\"This barbarian has become knowledgeable about China's strength and geographical features, and I fear that he will become a danger later.\\" He also spoke to Yang Xiong (Ê•äÈõÑ) the Prince of Guan (Emperor Yang's cousin) and said, \\"Recently, the government's laws are not being enforced.\\" These comments were reported to Emperor Yang, along with similar comments made by Yuwen Bi and Heruo Bi. In summer 607, Emperor Yang had Gao, Yuwen, and Heruo all beheaded, and Gao's sons were exiled to the border provinces. Some traditional historians, however, attribute Gao's death to his earlier killing of Consort Zhang. The Book of Sui commented, about Gao: :Gao Jiong was talented in both civilian and military matters and highly observant. Since he received the emperor's confidence, he expended his faithful service and contributed earnestly. He recommended talented people, and he saw saving the world as his responsibility. Su Wei, Yang Su, Heruo Bi, and Han Qinhu [(ÈüìÊìíËôé, another general)] were all brought into the government by Gao, and the officials who contributed because of his recommendations were innumerable. Gao was in power for almost 20 years, and both officials and the people praised and respected him, with no objections. That the empire could become rich and powerful was due to Gao. When he was executed, everyone mourned for him.  Notes and references  * Book of Sui, vol. 41. * History of Northern Dynasties, vol. 72. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180.

Is the youngest municipality of this Department along with the town of Uribia and others, created on March 19, 2000. Albania neighbours and exclusive enclosed camp site for the Cerrej√≥n coal mine workers and their families, named Mushaisa. Geography The municipality of Albania is located in the Guajira Peninsula, northern Colombia presenting a predominantly flat and arid terrain by the steps of the Serran√≠a del Perij√° to the east and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta to the west, within the basin of the Rancher√≠a River. The municipality of Albania limits to the north with the municipality of Maicao; to the east with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and Maicao; to the south with the municipalities of Hatonuevo, to the west with the municipalities of Hatonuevo and Riohacha. The municipal seat is located at 72¬∞ 56‚Äô east y 98¬∞ 08‚Äô north. The municipality has a total area of 425 km¬≤. Since May, 2001 the Colombian government authorized an urban corridor between Albania and the locality of Cuestecitas of approximately 95 km¬≤ pertaining to the mining zone. The municipality has one of the largest deposits of coal in Colombia. History The Crescentia cujete (Calabash trees) colloquially known as Calabazos, first name of Albania. The village of Calabacito was founded in the early 19th century and was first inhabited by indigenous groups pertaining to the Cocinas, Cariachiles and Wayuu who, due to their nomad traditions abandoned the area. It was repopulated later by former African slaves or their descendants probably escaping from the settlements of Moreno, Tabaco or Barrancas. These first inhabitants were blacks or mulattos and probably came also from a settlement known as \\"Soldado\\" in the early 20th century by 1903 escaping from political persecution or the civil war itself in which Colombia was engulfed between 1899 and 1902 known as the \\"Thousand Days' War\\". The first settlers apparently were seeking to establish agricultural production. The area was largely populated by Crescentia cujete (Calabash trees) colloquially known as Calabazos or Totumos. Politically and administratively, Albania was along the settlements of Manantial, Cuestecitas and Los Remedios under the mandate of the Province of Santa Marta (Sovereign State of Magdalena) until the year 1911 when it became part of the Special Commissary of La Guajira. The name of Calabacito was changed in 1937 by a commissar of La Guajira named Eduardo Londo√±o Villegas, who named it after his wife Alba or as other version suggests, after the country in the Balkans, Albania. During the military dictatorship of Gen. Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, Albania was annexed officially by Decree 1824 of 1954 to the Special Commissary of La Guajira; integrated by Uribia (then capital) and the village of Maicao. Along Albania the villages of Cuestecitas and Manantial were also included through Executive Decree 807. By Law 105 of December 12, 1960, the government of Colombia created the National Intendency of La Guajira, legalized by Decree 1824 by legislative act 1 of December 28 of the same year making La Guajira a department. The legislative act was officially enforced on July 1, 1965. Albania became a municipality on March 27, 2000, by Ordinance 001 passed by the Department Assembly of La Guajira, presented by then deputy Alvaro Gustavo Rosado. The first Mayor of Albania was Adel Enrique Pinto, designated by Decrere 080 of March 29, 2000.

He first became an important official during the reign of Sui's founder Emperor Wen,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 175. and after Emperor Wen's death continued to serve Emperor Wen's son Emperor Yang. He was often praised for his abilities and integrity but criticized for pettiness. After Emperor Yang was assassinated in 618, he was nominally an official under Emperor Yang's nephew Yang Hao,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 185. and then under the warlords Yuwen Huaji, Li Mi, and Wang Shichong. After Wang Shichong's state of Zheng was destroyed by Tang Dynasty in 621,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 189. neither the Tang general Li Shimin (the later Emperor Taizong) nor Li Shimin's father Emperor Gaozu of Tang was interested in retaining Su as an official, and Su Wei died soon thereafter.  Background  Su Wei was born in 542, during the reign of Emperor Wen of Western Wei. His father Su Chuo () was the key assistant for Western Wei's paramount general Yuwen Tai. Su Chuo died around the new year 547, and Su Wei inherited his father's title. (The historical sources are in conflict as to whether that title was Count of Meiyang or Duke of Meiyang, but the former seemed more probable.) After Yuwen Tai's death in 556, Yuwen Tai's nephew Yuwen Hu served as regent, and in 557 forced Emperor Gong of Western Wei to yield the throne to Yuwen Tai's son Yuwen Jue, ending Western Wei and founding Northern Zhou,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 167. although Yuwen Hu maintained power over the reigns of three emperors (three sons of Yuwen Tai) -- Emperor Xiaomin (whom Yuwen Hu later deposed and killed), Emperor Ming (whom Yuwen Hu later poisoned), and Emperor Wu. Yuwen Hu was impressed with Su Wei's talent and gave his daughter the Princess Xinxing to Su Wei in marriage. Su Wei, however, was fearful of the power that his father-in-law wielded, believing that it would eventually be a source of disaster, so for a while he fled into the mountains to be a hermit. Soon thereafter, his uncle forced him out of the mountains back into governmental service, but he still spent much of his time in Buddhist temples, reading various books. His title was promoted to Duke of Huaidao. In 572, Emperor Wu ambushed Yuwen Hu and killed him, taking power himself. He tried to retain Su in his government, but Su repeatedly declined under the excuse that he was ill. During this time, he was praised for his actions during a particular incident involving his cousin and her husband Yuan Xiong () -- Northern Zhou's ally Tujue had resented Yuan (for reasons lost to history) and had requested that Northern Zhou turn Yuan and his wife (Su's cousin) over to it for punishment. Su, believing that Tujue authorities could be bribed, sold all of his belongings to ransom his cousin and Yuan. He returned to governmental service during the reign of Emperor Wu's son Emperor Xuan. In 580, the erratic Emperor Xuan died, and Emperor Xuan's father-in-law Yang Jian seized power as regent.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 174. As one of Yang's close advisors, Gao Jiong, had long praised Su for his abilities, Yang invited Su to join his staff. After serving under Yang for a month, Su heard that Yang was intending to seize the throne, and he fled into the country. Gao requested Yang's permission to track him down, but Yang responded, \\"He does not want to participate in what I will be doing. Ignore him for the time being.\\" In 581, after Yang had Emperor Xuan's son Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui Dynasty as its Emperor Wen, he summoned Su back to his government, and posthumously honored Su's father Su Chuo as the Duke of Pei, and then had Su Wei inherit the title.  During Emperor Wen's reign  Emperor Wen made Su Wei the head of the examination bureau (Menxia Sheng, ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ), one of the five main bureaus in his governmental structure, and the minister of finance as well as appointing him to assist with the legal reforms of the Kaihuang Code. Su, remembering that his father Su Chuo had often lamented at what heavy taxes he needed to impose on the people due to the governmental needs from the wars of the times, advocated reduction of taxes, and Emperor Wen agreed. At one point, Gao Jiong, believing Su to be more capable, offered to resign and transfer his authorities to Su, and Emperor Wen initially agreed, but then decided that Gao should not lose his position because of his ability to identify Su's talent. Rather, Emperor Wen had Gao and Su share their authorities, effectively as co-prime ministers. In 582, at Su's suggestion, and after consulting Gao, Emperor Wen moved the capital from the old city of Chang'an to a nearby, newly built capital city of Daxing (later to be known as Chang'an as well). In 583, at Su's suggestion, Emperor Wen abolished the commandery level of government, making county government directly below provincial government. Around that time, Emperor Wen, somewhat dissatisfied with the new laws that he promulgated after he became emperor, had Su and Niu Hong () further revise the penal code, to reduce the number of laws and reduce the severity of punishment. In 589, after Emperor Wen's forces conquered rival Chen Dynasty and unified China, Su suggested that a local governmental layer, the township, be created, each with 500 households, headed by a mayor. Li Delin, who had often opposed Su's suggestions, pointed out that this would lead to situations where multiple counties would have to share one township and create confusion as well as potential for corruption by the mayors. Emperor Wen nevertheless agreed with Su. In the summer of that year, he also made Su one of the heads of the executive bureau (Shangshu Sheng, Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ). At that time, Su, along with Gao, Yu Qingze (), and Emperor Wen's nephew Yang Xiong () the Prince of Guangping, were known as the \\"four nobles\\" due to the power they wielded.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 177. In 590, due to an investigative report submitted by Yu that pointed out that the township mayors were indeed often corrupt, Emperor Wen ordered that the township layer be abolished‚Äîbut instead of punishing Su, he became angry when Li pointed out that he had previously opposed the idea but now wanted to wait to see if the idea could be reworked, and he demoted Li to a provincial governorship, particularly with Su accusing Li himself of corruption. Also in 590, another ill-advised idea by Su contributed to a major problem that Sui was facing. After Chen's conquest, Su had written a work known as the Five Teachings () and ordered that all former citizens of Chen be required to read and memorize it. (The Five Teachings is no longer extant, but is believed to be a work that concentrated on loyalty to the emperor.) This, along with other dissatisfactions about Sui rule and rumors that Sui was about to force Chen's people to move to the Guanzhong region, caused mass-scale rebellions, which were eventually suppressed by Yang Su. In 592, the official He Tuo (), who had previously had disputes with Su, had a dispute with Su's son Su Kui (), and was angry that despite Su Kui's younger status, the other officials were largely supporting Su Kui due to Su Wei's power. He therefore submitted a petition to Emperor Wen accusing Su Wei of factionalism and nepotism. Emperor Wen had Yu and his son Yang Xiu the Prince of Shu investigate, and the accusations were found true. In anger, Emperor Wen removed Su from his post and abolished his dukedom, although soon thereafter somewhat relented and restored Su's privilege to visit the palace, commenting, \\"Su Wei is virtuous, but was misled by the people around him.\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 178. Yang Su took over Su Wei's posts. By summer 594, Emperor Wen had restored Su Wei to his dukedom and again made him the head of the examination bureau. In 595, Su was accused of a lack of proper respect when accompanying Emperor Wen in sacrificing to the god of Mount Tai, and was removed, but soon restored. It was around this time that Emperor Wen made a comment that appears to be observant of Su's character -- \\"It has been said by many that Su Wei was only pretending to be clean and that his house was filled with gold and jade. That accusation is ridiculous. However, he is overly ferocious and unrealistic, and he overly paid attention to his reputation. He is happy if you go along with him and resents if you do not. That is his true problem.\\" In 597, Emperor Wen, in order to divide and conquer Tujue, married the daughter of a clansman, whom he created the Princess Anyi, to Tuli Khan Ashina Rangan, a subordinate khan to the leader of Tujue, the Dulan Khan Ashina Yongyul√º. In order to solemnize the ceremony and further pull Ashina Rangan to his camp, Emperor Wen made Su, Niu, and Hul√º Xiaoqing () masters of ceremony. (Thereafter, Ashina Rangan became a submissive Sui vassal.) In 601, after Gao had been removed from his post in 600, Su was restored to his prior post as co-head of the executive bureau, effectively serving as co-prime minister again with Yang Su.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 179.  During Emperor Yang's reign  In 604, Emperor Wen died‚Äîa death that traditional historians, while admitting a lack of direct evidence, generally believed to be a murder ordered by his son and Yang Guang the Crown Prince. Yang Guang took the throne as Emperor Yang, and Su Wei continued to serve as co-prime minister. In 606, Emperor Yang revised the methods for promoting officials, requiring not only that they be competent but also show virtues and specific accomplishments before they could be promoted. He put seven officials in charge of the process of reviewing officials' performance and promotions‚ÄîSu, along with Niu Hong, Yuwen Shu, Zhang Jin (), Yu Shiji, Pei Yun (), and Pei Ju, and they were known collectively as the \\"seven nobles of officialdom.\\" However, although all seven consulted on the decisions, the main authority fell into the hands of Yu, and it was alleged that Yu decided the promotions based on the amounts of bribes he received.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 180. In 607, despite Su's opposition, Emperor Yang built a section of the Great Wall from Yulin to Zihe (Á¥´Ê≤≥, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia), employing over a million men in labor. Su was subsequently removed from office. However, Su escaped the fate of Gao Jiong, Yuwen Bi (), and Heruo Bi (), who were executed for their similar oppositions to Emperor Yang's construction and military campaigns. Sometime between 607 and 613, however, Su was again named the head of the examination bureau. In 613, when Yang Su's son Yang Xuangan rebelled against Emperor Yang in the midst of Emperor Yang's second campaign against Goguryeo, Emperor Yang asked Su whether Yang Xuangan, whom Emperor Yang considered intelligent, was capable of causing great trouble. Su responded, \\"Only a person who is capable of judging what is right and wrong and what is successful and unsuccessful can be called intelligent. Yang Xuangan is careless and unattentive, and he will not cause much trouble. What I am afraid of is that he is merely starting the prelude of great troubles.\\" Much as Su feared, while Yang Xuangan's rebellion was quickly suppressed, thereafter, there was little peace for the rest of Sui's history.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 182. In the fall of 615, while Emperor Yang was touring the frontier districts, Shibi Khan and the Eastern Turks launched a surprise attack against Yanmen Commandery in reprisal against various offenses by the emperor. Princess Yicheng‚Äîdaughter of a Sui clansman‚Äîsecretly informed the emperor of the attack, and Emperor Yang and his entourage fled to the safety of the commandery seat at present-day Daixian, Shanxi.. Shibi Khan then besieged the town on September 11.Â§ßÊ•≠ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÂπ¥ ÂÖ´ÊúàÁô∏ÈÖâ Academia Sinica Sima Guang, Zizhi Tongjian, Vol. 182. Yuwen initially suggested that Emperor Yang fight his way out of the siege, but Su opposed taking such risks and eventually, under the advice of Emperor Yang's brother-in-law Xiao Yu, Emperor Yang sought more aid from Princess Yicheng. Emperor Yang's extravagant promises of promotion and reward brought reinforcements and Princess Yicheng falsely informed the khan that the Turks were under attack from the north. Shibi Khan then lifted the siege. With the northern empire under the effects of agrarian rebellions, Su subsequently advised Emperor Yang to return to the capital Chang'an, and Emperor Yang initially agreed. However, Yuwen suggested going to the eastern capital Luoyang instead, and Emperor Yang went to Luoyang and would never again go to Chang'an in his lifetime. Subsequently, when Su was examining the proposed promotions to soldiers based on their contributions assisting Yanmen Commandery lift the siege, he reviewed them strictly and promoted few of them, a decision that Emperor Yang agreed with but which brought much dissension among the army ranks. In 616, with the empire even more engulfed in rebellions, Emperor Yang was asking his officials how the rebellions were being suppressed. Yuwen falsely stated that the rebels had been reduced to less than 10% of what they used to be. Su initially declined to answer the question, but after Emperor Yang insisted on hearing his answer, he responded that while he did not know the numbers, the rebels were getting closer to Luoyang‚Äîand that, further, the taxes and labor levies were severely decreased due to rebel activities. He further pointed out that Emperor Yang was reneging on his promise to stop considering campaigns against Goguryeo. Emperor Yang was displeased. Further, at Duanwu Festival, while the other officials submitted treasures as gifts to the emperor, Su submitted a copy of the Classic of History. Emperor Yang was displeased when someone pointed out that the Classic of History contained a chapter entitled the Song of the Five SonsZizhi Tongjian, vol. 183.‚Äîa lament by the five brothers of King Taikang of Xia DynastyClassic of History, Song of the Five Sons. that he lost his kingdom due to his excessive cruelty and hunting‚Äîand believed that Su was criticizing him. He was further incensed when Su, while discussing the issue of another campaign against Goguryeo, sarcastically suggested that if Emperor Yang pardoned all of the agrarian rebels, there would be hundreds of thousands of soldiers available to attack Goguryeo. Emperor Yang thereafter complained about Su to Pei Yun, and Pei Yun then had a man named Zhang Xingben () accuse Su of inappropriate promotions and fear of Tujue. Emperor Yang removed Su from his posts, and then further accusations that Su was conspiring with Tujue were made. Emperor Yang had Pei Yun investigate it, and Pei proposed that Su be executed. Su, unable to prove his innocence, begged for forgiveness. Emperor Yang took pity and released him, but stripped him of citizenship rights, along with his descendants for three generations. Soon, however, it appeared that Su was restored to some extent, as he accompanied Emperor Yang to Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) in 617, although he was not restored to his posts, as Pei Yun and Yu suggested to Emperor Yang that Su was too old to be effective.  After Emperor Yang's death  In spring 618, a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji (Yuwen Shu's son) killed Emperor Yang, along with a number of his relatives and high-level officials. Yuwen Huaji, however, did not kill Su, as Su was at that point no longer involved in policy-making. Further, as Su was respected by the officials and the people, Yuwen made Su the nominal leader of the government, although Yuwen was in actual control. Yuwen subsequently made Emperor Yang's nephew Yang Hao the Prince of Qin emperor, and Su became a part of Yang Hao's regime, as Yuwen soon abandoned Jiangdu and headed north toward Luoyang. Later that year, after Yuwen was defeated by Li Mi, Su surrendered to Li, and people were surprised when he bowed readily to Li, stating, \\"I did not know that today I will again see a capable ruler!\\" When Li was subsequently defeated by Sui troops under Wang Shichong, who at that point controlled Luoyang and was nominally supporting Emperor Yang's grandson Yang Tong as emperor, Su surrendered to Wang and was restored to the title of Duke of Pei. In 619, after Wang had Yang Tong yielding the throne to him, ending Sui and establishing a state of Zheng, he gave Su honorific titles, although Su tried to decline them. In 621, Wang, facing military pressure from Li Shimin, the son of Emperor Gaozu of Tang, surrendered. Li Shimin set up headquarters at Luoyang, and Su requested an audience with him, but stated that he was too old to bow to Li Shimin. Li Shimin sent back a messenger to rebuke him for bowing to Li Mi and Wang and refused to meet him. Su subsequently went to the Tang capital Chang'an and sought an audience with Emperor Gaozu, and was similarly rebuked and not given an office. He died in 623.

The accords were signed on February 16, 1996, in San Andr√©s Larr√°inzar, Chiapas, and granted autonomy, recognition, and rights to the indigenous population of Mexico. The accords were based on the five principles of basic respect for the diversity of the indigenous population of Chiapas, the conservation of the natural resources within the territories used and occupied by indigenous peoples, a greater participation of indigenous communities in the decisions and control of public expenditures, the participation of indigenous communities in determining their own development plans, and the autonomy of indigenous communities and their right of free determination in the framework of the State. They were discussed and approved by representatives of all the indigenous communities of Mexico, and translated into ten indigenous languages. President Zedillo and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) however, ignored the agreements and instead increased military presence with the political support of the other important political parties Democratic Revolution Party and National Action Party (PRD and PAN). History Larrainzar, Chiapas On February 16, 1996, the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) created and signed the first phase of the San Andres Accords. Later that same day, the Mexican federal government agreed upon the conditions and also signed the accords. Both groups signed the accords in the presence of CONAI (the National Intermediation Committee - Comisi√≥n Nacional de Intermediaci√≥n) led by Bishop Samuel Ruiz and COCOPA (the Commission of Concordia and Pacification).http://www.greens.org/s-r/27/27-27.htmlMEXICO: GOVERNMENT AND GUERRILLAS NEGOTIATE BY CORRESPONDENCE, IPS-Inter Press Service, March 17, 1995, Eduardo Molina y Vedia The creation and signing of these accords occurred after multiple talks between the EZLN and the Mexican federal government. These talks began in January 1996. Most involved dialogue and discussions about the rights and culture of indigenous peoples in Mexico. The main topics discussed by the two groups at these meetings were: # Basic respect and recognition for the diversity of the indigenous population of Chiapas # The preservation of the natural resources within the lands occupied by the indigenous population # More participation by individuals within indigenous communities in the decisions and control of public expenditures # More participation of indigenous individuals within their communities in deciding their own development plans, including control over their own political and judicial policies # The autonomy of indigenous communities and their right to participate in state affairs After a specific talk in San Andres Larrainzar concerning these very issues in January 1996, the EZLN and the Mexican Federal Government decided to construct and sign the San Andres Accords. The accords were constructed to address these issues that the two groups felt were essential in addressing the needs of the indigenous population. After both groups signed the accords, the citizens of Chiapas were relieved with new hope that there would now be peace in Chiapas. Many Chiapas citizens were relieved that the Mexican Federal Government was actively negotiating and participating in talks with EZLN. The first stages of the San Andres Accords signed by the two groups were supposed to mark the beginning of negotiations and peace talks. The EZLN was under the impression that further discussions with the Federal Government would eventually lead to more provisions that would be essential in addressing more issues that the indigenous population faced. Some of these issues included the substandard living conditions for the indigenous peoples in Chiapas, the development of indigenous communities, and situations faced by women in Chiapas. Despite the initial efforts to reconcile relations between the EZLN and the Mexican Federal Government, the Mexican Federal Government did not fulfill the promises that they had made by agreeing with the accords. None of the issues discussed in the San Andres Accords were addressed as the Chiapas indigenous citizens had expected and hoped for. Instead, the communities of Chiapas were infiltrated by Mexican military and paramilitary groups more often than before. According to CONAI, which acted as a mediation group between the EZLN and the Federal Government, Mexican Government officials refused to talk or bring participants for the second round of discussions concerning the indigenous population. On August 29, 1996, the EZLN refused to negotiate with the Mexican Federal Government anymore until the five specific provisions they agreed upon were met by the government. The five provisions were: # The government must fulfill their obligation from the parts of the original San Andres Accords that addressed the issues of the indigenous population‚Äôs rights and cultures # The Federal government must present a proposal that addresses the issues of democracy and justice for indigenous groups # The government must free the political prisoners jailed for being \\"Zapatistas\\" (which was agreed upon during the signing of the Dialogue and Conciliation Laws on March 11, 1995 by the EZLN and the Federal Government) # There must be an end to the warfare initiated by the government in Chiapas. The paramilitary groups in the northern parts of Chiapas must be disarmed. # There must be a governmental delegation that can help resolve the conflict with full respect of the Zapatista mediation body. After talks ended between the EZLN and the Mexican Federal Government, COCOPA (the federal Congress‚Äô monitoring body responsible for overseeing talks between the two groups) looked for a more fair and rewarding way to find resolution to the disagreement. COCOPA began efforts to convert the original San Andres Accords (only the ones concerning indigenous peoples) into legal legislation. The COCOPA initiative was presented to the Mexican Federal Government and the EZLN in November 1996. The EZLN agreed upon the conditions presented in the initiative and signed the proposal on November 29. A few days later, the Mexican Federal Government rejected the initiative, despite the fact that the proposal had been created by officials within the government (COCOPA leaders). The Mexican Federal Government addressed the refusal by creating and presenting a counter initiative. For the most part, the government totally altered the main principles presented in the original San Andres Accords. The EZLN read over the proposal and declined to sign it. The Zapatistas claimed that the Federal Government made the indigenous people look ‚Äúuncivilized, with very little interest in dialogue‚Äù. The Federal Government then began a media campaign against the EZLN. The Mexican government announced to the citizens of Chiapas that they had fulfilled the obligations promised in the original San Andres Peace Accords. CONAI critically compared the Mexican Government‚Äôs counter-proposal against what was originally promised in the San Andres Accords. According to CONAI officials, ‚Äúthe presidential proposal on Indigenous Rights and Culture does not comply with what was agreed in San Andres‚Äù. CONAI commented that the counter-proposal limited the exercising rights of Indian peoples in their communities, mentioned that the Constitution ‚Äúgranted‚Äù rights to the indigenous people instead of recognizing them, failed to recognize jurisdiction rights of the indigenous peoples, did not recognize Indigenous peoples‚Äô right to their territory, and did not recognize the right of Indigenous peoples to decide procedures for the election of their own officials. Recent relations Paramilitary groups have also reappeared, and aggressions against Zapatistas have increased.‚ÄúLearning, Surviving: Marcos After the Rupture‚Äù by Laura Castellanos, NACLA Report on the Americas, May ‚Äì June 2008, Vol. 41 Issue 3: 34-39 The paramilitaries have been sheltered in particular by the Chiapas governor, Juan Sabines, an ex-PRI militant turned PRD member. The PRD leadership has remained silent. Manuel Camacho Solis, however, acknowledged that the subject has been discussed. He says 'There is a risk of violence in Chiapas. There are PRD groups that have been resorting to dirty tricks.‚Äô‚Äù In 2000, Vicente Fox, leader of the National Action Party, was elected President. He promised to renew the peace process and talks with the indigenous community. The election of Fox inspired new hope among the indigenous that negotiations were possible.http://lasa.international.pitt.edu/Lasa2003/EscarcegaSylvia.pdf During March and April 2001, EZLN leaders made a trip from Chiapas through a dozen states in Mexico in an attempt to rally for indigenous rights. EZLN had been demanding the renewal of peace negotiations. They demanded the withdrawal of Mexican military forces from seven key bases in Chiapas, the release of all Zapatista prisoners, and the passage into law of the COCOPA initiative that would include the original San Andres accords. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox closed down the seven military bases and released all but nine Zapatista political prisoners. However, he refused to meet the Zapatista demand to implement the San Andres Accords without change. Instead of officially recognizing indigenous autonomy in the Mexican constitution, Congress passed the ‚Äúindigenous law‚Äù that allowed local states with the choice about whether or not to recognize indigenous autonomy. Strong opposition to this law was met from state officials, religious leaders, many indigenous groups, and the EZLN. Zapatista leader Subcomandante Marcos commented that the name of the ‚Äúindigenous rights‚Äù bill would be better termed the ‚ÄúConstitutional Recognition of the Rights and Culture of the Landowners and Racists‚Äù. Since the reform was passed by the Senate on April 25, 2001, nearly 300 constitutional complaints have been filed against this law. Those complaints argue that the law fails to recognize indigenous peoples as legal subjects and that it does not guarantee indigenous communities the right to use their own natural resources.http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/d74d6ab34bb16826c1256b53004e0f1b?Opendocument In 2015, the governor of Chiapas, Manuel Velasco Coello, pointed out that the accords must be observed and that these must be stated in the Federal Constitution.La Jornada, June 27, 2015; \\"The Zapatista Movement, Political Reality: Velasco Coello.\\" (\\"El movimiento zapatista, realidad pol√≠tica:Velasco Coello.\\") Tuxtla Guti√©rrez, Chiapas.

After only several minutes, Ilija is free to go, however, he starts to suspect that his sub-tenant, Petar, might be a spy. As time passes, Ilija becomes convinced that Petar, a modern man from a capitalist country, represents a great threat to national security and the socialist system, and begins spying on Petar. Ilija's wife Danica (Mira Banjac) is more concerned with the future of their daughter Sonja (Sonja Saviƒá), who, although holding a degree in dentistry, is unable to find a job. After a bout of spying, Ilija phones inspector Dra≈æiƒá (Milan ≈†trljiƒá), claiming that Petar was meeting with \\"suspicious people\\" (actually Petar's intellectual friends), but Dra≈æiƒá does not take him seriously. Ilija decides to take matters into his own hands. He begins his own surveillance operation against the innocent man and his friends. Eventually, he bars his house, buys a guard dog, arms himself with munition, and even gets help from his brother ƒêura (Zvonko Lepetiƒá), both of them becoming convinced that Petar is a foreign agent. One evening, Ilija is accidentally hit by a car, which he sees as an attempt of assassination. Soon, even Danica starts to believe Ilija, but Sonja believes that her father is suffering from paranoia. ƒêuro manages to capture several of Petar's friends, holding them in his basement, beating them up and making them \\"reveal their terrorist plans\\".

Petar says that he wanted to say goodbye, as he is traveling to New York, and asks Danica why Ilija and his brother are following him, thus revealing that he was aware of their \\"surveillance operation\\". Ilija and ƒêura crash into the house, sending Danica away, tying Petar to a chair, beating him and forcing him to \\"confess\\". Petar keeps claiming that he is not a spy, but the brothers do not believe him. ƒêura leaves the house for a while, to bring one of Petar's friends who \\"admitted everything\\", and Ilija continues to interrogate Petar. However, Ilija gets too excited and has a heart attack. Petar manages to get to the phone and call the ambulance, and then, still handcuffed to the chair, he leaves the house to try to catch his plane. Ilija, while in severe pain, phones ƒêura's house and tells his wife to tell him to \\"block the airport\\".

Children have been dying every year, especially during the rains when the adivasis do not have adequate employment for daily earnings. Melghat is a vast forested tract spread over two tehsils of Amravati district, Chikhaldara and Dharni. It covers a geographical area of about 4,426 km2. Of this, 3,630 km2 is in Chikhaldara. This tehsil retains its dense forest cover because of its comparatively low population‚Äîabout 76,000 people in 197 villages. The 796 km2 of Dharni tehsil have fewer forests due to the pressure of 1.13 lakh people living in 153 villages. It was earlier estimated that the deaths of adivasi children mostly occurred in Dharni and not in the Melghat Tiger Reserve. The problem has now spread, with deaths in 39 villages of the Multiple Use Area (MUA) of the tiger reserve. The reserve covers 1,676 km2 of forests. It includes the Gugamal National Park (361.28 km2), which has no village within its boundaries, the Melghat Wildlife Sanctuary (788.75 km2) with 19 villages and a MUA (526.90 km2) with the 39 villages. The reserve has a human population of 25,000. Of these, 8,000 people live in 19 villages of the sanctuary and 17,000 adivasis live in the 39 villages of the MUA. Studies have shown that one of the reasons for the rising child deaths among the Korkus of Melghat is that they are denied access to traditional foods like wild flowers, tubers, fruits, crabs and fish from the rich forest. Dharni is facing challenges from the government's new policy of making dams which poses a great threat to almost 2,000 inhabitants living in surrounding villages.

He was a prolific writer whose writing ability was greatly praised by his contemporaries and the emperors that he served under. He began the compilation of the Book of Northern Qi, a work that he was never able to complete, but his son Li Baiyao later completed the work. Background The exact year of Li Delin's birth is not known, but in all likelihood he was born during the 530s, perhaps 531, around the time when Northern Wei was divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei. His grandfather Li Shou (ÊùéÂ£Ω) was a minor provincial official, but his father Li Jingzu (ÊùéÊï¨Êóè) was more prominent, serving as both an official and a general during the reign of Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei. Li Delin was said to be highly intelligent from his childhood, and even before he turned 10 he was able to quickly memorize and recite the lengthy poem Shudu Fu (ËúÄÈÉΩË≥¶) by Zuo Si (Â∑¶ÊÄù), impressing the high-level official Gao Longzhi (È´òÈöÜ‰πã). By age 14, his writing ability already impressed the historian and official Wei Shou. When he was 15, Li Jingzu died, and Li Delin took his father's casket back to his ancestral commandery Boling (ÂçöÈôµ, roughly modern Hengshui, Hebei) for burial. Because his mother Lady Zhao was often ill, he declined offers of governmental posts and remained at Boling to care for his mother, until his mother eventually grew better in her physical condition. During Northern Qi Sometime before 557, Gao Jie (È´òÊπù) the Prince of Rencheng, the governor of Ding Province (ÂÆöÂ∑û, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei) and brother to Emperor Wenxuan of the newly established Northern Qi (Eastern Wei's successor state), impressed with Li Delin's talent, invited Li to his mansion and treated him as a friend, not as a subordinate. In 557, Gao Jie, believing that Li's talent should be employed by the imperial administration, recommended him. The prime minister Yang Yin made Li a low level official, but in a post where Li felt that his talent was not being used properly, so eventually Li resigned (with the excuse that he was ill) and returned to Boling. He turned to imperial government after Emperor Wenxuan's death in 559, and gradually rose in prominence during the succeeding reigns of Emperor Wenxuan's son Emperor Fei and Emperor Wenxuan's brothers Emperor Xiaozhao and Emperor Wucheng. In 573, when Emperor Wucheng's son and successor Gao Wei, who had a love for literature, established Wenlin Hall (ÊñáÊûóÈ§®) to retain officials with literary talent, he made Li and Yan Zitui (È°èÂ≠êÊé®) co-directors. Meanwhile, Li was responsible for drafting imperial edicts, and his literary abilities became well-known. During Northern Zhou In 577, Northern Qi was conquered by rival Northern Zhou (Western Wei's successor state). Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou, who had previously already been impressed by the edicts that Li Delin drafted for Northern Qi's emperors, made the comment, \\"I have long heard of Li Delin, and when I read the edicts that he wrote for Qi, I believed him to be a heavenly man. I did not know then that one day I can have him draft my own documents.\\" Li thereafter served in Northern Zhou's imperial government, although not of high rank. During the time of the reign of Emperor Wu's grandson Emperor Jing (579‚Äì581), while Emperor Wu's son Emperor Xuan still retained imperial powers as retired emperor, Li was created the Baron of Cheng'an. In 580, Emperor Xuan died, and his father-in-law Yang Jian seized power as regent. He invited Li to serve as his assistant, and Li pledged loyalty to him. It was at Li's suggestion that Yang immediately made his intentions to eventually take the throne known by assuming particularly elevated titles while serving as regent. When the general Yuchi Jiong rose against Yang at Yecheng, the former Northern Qi capital, Yang particularly entrusted strategic issues with Li, allowing Li to make much of the military decisions during the campaign, which eventually saw Yang defeating Yuchi to affirm his hold on power. During Sui Dynasty In spring 581, Yang Jian had Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui Dynasty as its Emperor Wen. Emperor Wen reorganized his government into five main branches, and he made Li Delin be the deputy head of the legislative branch Neishi Sheng (ÂÖßÂè≤ÁúÅ), under the official Yu Qingze (ËôûÊÖ∂Ââá). Yu subsequently recommended to Emperor Wen that the members of Northern Zhou's imperial Yuwen clan be massacred‚Äîa suggestion that the other chief advisors to Emperor Wen, Gao Jiong and Yang Hui (Ê•äÊÉ†) disagreed with but did not dare to openly oppose. Only Li openly opposed it, but Emperor Wen responded, \\"You are only a scholar, and you have no qualifications in this matter.\\" Emperor Wen subsequently did slaughter members of the Yuwen clan, and after this incident, he never again promoted Li‚Äîand it did not help that Li, who was proud of his own abilities, generally had poor relations with other high-level officials. Li's title, however, was upgraded from baron to viscount. Li had a particularly adversarial relationship with Su Wei, over Su's constant desire to revise the laws that Li drafted along with Yu Yi (‰∫éÁøº) and Gao in 581 and Li's opposition to Su's proposal to create the office of township mayors with authorities over 500 households, on the grounds that it would be difficult to find enough men capable of governing 500 household units. In this conflict, Su, supported by Gao, was largely able to have his opinions adopted by Emperor Wen, over Li's. In winter 587, when Emperor Wen visited Tong Province (ÂêåÂ∑û, roughly Weinan, Shaanxi), Li initially did not follow him on account of illness. However, Emperor Wen had him summoned from the capital Chang'an to plan together the invasion of rival Chen Dynasty, making the promise to Li, \\"On the day that Chen is conquered, I will use seven kinds of jewels to decorate you, so that no one east of the Qinling Mountains would be more honored than you would be.\\" When Emperor Wen subsequently launched the invasion in 588, he often had Gao, who was the chief strategist for the campaign, consult Li on strategies. Once Chen was conquered in 589, Emperor Wen initially issued an edict awarding Li a large cache of silk and creating him a duke, but Gao, arguing that doing so would make field generals angry (and because he was jealous of Li's abilities), persuaded Emperor Wen to withdraw the edict. By 590, Emperor Wen and Su's conflicts with Li had come to the foreground, over several matters. First, when Yuchi Jiong was defeated, at Li's request, Emperor Wen awarded an inn owned by the former Northern Qi official Gao Anagong, who had joined Yuchi's effort, as his reward. Emperor Wen later found out that Gao had himself forcibly seized the land on which the inn sat from the farmers, and Su took the opportunity to accuse Li of being complicit in Gao's seizure. Second, when Yu, after realizing the problems created by township mayors, suggested that the mayoral posts be abolished, Li, while initially opposing the proposal, opposed its abolition, reasoning that laws should not be changed so quickly‚Äîusing language that caused Emperor Wen to believe that Li was comparing him to Wang Mang. Third, Li had previously falsely stated his father Li Jingzu to have been a far higher-ranked official (fourth rank, second class) than actually was the case (ninth rank, first class), in order to obtain posthumous honors for Li Jingzu. Emperor Wen, citing these issues, removed Li from his post and made him the governor of Hu Province (ÊπñÂ∑û, roughly modern Huzhou, Zhejiang). Li was later moved to Huai Province (Êá∑Â∑û, roughly modern Jiaozuo, Henan) and died as its governor, at age 60, probably in 591. Emperor Wen, apparently remembering his contributions, buried him with honor. His son Li Baiyao later served as an official for Sui and its successor state Tang Dynasty, and completed Northern Qi's history, the Book of Northern Qi, which Li Delin began but did not complete.

On 27 April 1994, it was integrated with six other independent forces into the South African National Defence Force (SANDF).South African Medal Website - SA Defence Force : 1975-2003 (Accessed 30 April 2015)South African Medal Website - SA Defence Force : 1952-1975 (Accessed 30 April 2015)Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 457, no. 25213, Pretoria, 25 July 2003 Institution The Military Merit Medal, post-nominal letters MMM, was instituted by the Chief of the Defence Force as the Defence Force's Commendation Medal on 9 October 1974. In 1993 it was ratified and formally instituted by the State President as the Military Merit Medal. Development =Commendation= 100px In 1968, the Commandant General of the South African Defence Force instituted the Commendation by the Commandant General, which was awarded for service of a high order which did not qualify for a decoration. Recipients were entitled to wear a bronze protea flower emblem on a strip of tunic cloth, mounted like a medal ribbon and placed in the last position on their ribbon bars. About 500 awards were made and, from the appearance of the emblem, it became irreverently known as the \\"Mielieblaar\\" (Corn leaf). When the title of Commandant General was changed to Chief of the Defence Force, after Admiral Hugo Biermann was appointment in that post in 1972, the name of the award was changed accordingly to the Chief of the Defence Force's Commendation. =Medal= On 9 October 1974, the Chief of the Defence Force's Commendation was replaced by the Chief of the Defence Force's Commendation Medal, which was still awarded by the Chief of the Defence Force for service of a high order. All the members of the \\"Mielieblaar Club\\" received the new medal, to replace the protea flower emblem. Even though it was officially sanctioned, the medal was considered unofficial and assumed the lowest position in the order of precedence, since it was not instituted or awarded by the State President. =Decoration= In 1992, a committee, chaired by Brigadier (Professor) Deon Fourie and with Colonel Andr√© Kritzinger, Commandants Ray Burgess and Piet Joubert, Major (State Herald) Fred Brownell and representatives of all four Arms of the Service as members, was tasked with the revision of the South African military orders, decorations and medals. Of the resulting recommendations, one of those which was approved in 1993 was that, since the State President was the Fount of Honour and the award of a military medal by the Chief of the Defence Force was therefore inappropriate, the Chief of the Defence Force's Commendation Medal should be upgraded to a full-fledged military decoration, awarded by the State President. The name Military Merit Medal was proposed, as well as that its position in the official order of wear should be revised accordingly. Another recommendation, which was approved in 1993, was that all awards for bravery and meritorious service should be considered as decorations and that recipients of all these awards should be granted the privilege of using appropriate post-nominal letters. The post-nominal letters which were proposed along with this recommendation, were for the following decorations: * Four existing honours, the Southern Cross Medal (1975) (SM), Pro Merito Medal (1975) (PMM), Danie Theron Medal (DTM) and Military Merit Medal (MMM). * One discontinued honour, eighteen years after it had been discontinued, the Jack Hindon Medal (JHM). * Seven new decorations which had recently been instituted, the Pro Virtute Decoration (PVD), Pro Virtute Medal (PVM), Ad Astra Decoration (AAD), Army Cross (CM), Air Force Cross (CA), Navy Cross (CN) and Medical Service Cross (CC). Award criteria The Military Merit Medal could be awarded to all ranks of the South African Defence Force, for service of a high order. The use of post-nominal letters by all recipients since 1968, was allowed from 1993. A bar, instituted in 1993 as well, could be awarded in recognition of further similar displays of service of a high order. Order of wear The position of the Military Merit Medal in the official order of precedence was revised four times after 1975, to accommodate the inclusion or institution of new decorations and medals, first when its status was raised from an award by the Chief of the Defence Force to a decoration by the State President, again upon the integration into the South African National Defence Force on 27 April 1994, then again in April 1996, when decorations and medals were belatedly instituted for the two former non-statutory forces, the Azanian People's Liberation Army and Umkhonto we Sizwe, and finally upon the institution of a new set of awards on 27 April 2003. Its position remained unchanged, as it was on 27 April 1994, upon the latter two occasions. ;South African Defence Force until 26 April 1994: Jack Hindon Medal (JHM) Military Merit Medal (MMM) Korea Medal *Official SADF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Jack Hindon Medal (JHM). ** Succeeded by the Korea Medal. *Official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Jack Hindon Medal (JHM). ** Succeeded by the Civil Defence Medal for Meritorious Service.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette no. 15093, Pretoria, 3 September 1993 ;South African National Defence Force from 27 April 1994: Jack Hindon Medal (JHM) Military Merit Medal (MMM) Defence Force Commendation Medal *Official SANDF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Jack Hindon Medal (JHM) of the Republic of South Africa. ** Succeeded by the Defence Force Commendation Medal of the Republic of Bophuthatswana. *Official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Jack Hindon Medal (JHM) of the Republic of South Africa. ** Succeeded by the Civil Defence Medal for Meritorious Service of the Republic of South Africa.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, Description ;Obverse The Military Merit Medal was struck in bronze, with an engrailed edge which has twelve points, to fit in a circle 38 millimetres in diameter, and is 3 millimetres thick at the centre.

The archiepiscopal see is the Santa Mar√≠a la Menor cathedral, a World Heritage Site, dedicated to St. Mary of the Incarnation, which was designated a minor basilica by Pope Benedict XV in his apostolic letter Inter Americae on 14 June 1920.

History  * The Bull of Pope Alexander VI, dated 24 June 1493, designated the Franciscan Bernardo Buil (Boil) to accompany Christopher Columbus on his second voyage of discovery, with faculties as Apostolic delegate or vicar. He did not make the journey, and his Benedictine near- namesake did. On 30 August 1495, a band of Franciscans and other missioners did arrive in Hispaniola.http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Archdiocese_of_Santo_Domingo * The see was erected on 8 August 1511 by Pope Julius II by the Bull Pontifex Romanus, which also established the bishoprics of Concepci√≥n de la Vega and the San Juan of Porto Rico, on Antillian Spanish-colonial territory split off from the Archdiocese of Seville. Three prelates, who had been appointed to the sees comprising the ecclesiastical province created in 1504 by the same pope, united their petition to that of the Crown in requesting the Holy See to suppress them and to establish the three new dioceses as suffragans to the See of Seville. This alteration was effected before any of the prelates in question had taken possession of his diocese or been consecrated a bishop. - Father Francisco Garcia de Padilla, a Franciscan, who in 1504 had been designed to occupy the See of Diocese of Bayuna (Baynoa, Baiunensis), was chosen the first Bishop of Santo Domingo. He died before his consecration, after having named Rev. Carlos de Arag√≥n his vicar-general and authorized him to take possession of the diocese. The first bishop to occupy the See of Santo Domingo was Alessandro Geraldini, who was appointed in 1516 and died in 1524. He was a native of Italy, and perhaps the only representative of the Americas to attend the Fifth Lateran Council. * Lost territories on 1513.08.28 to establish the Diocese of Santa Mar√≠a la Antigua del Dari√©n and on 1517.02.11 to establish the Diocese of Baracoa * In 1527 it gained territory from the suppressed Diocese of Concepci√≥n de la Vega, which was united, after the death of its first bishop, Pedro Su√°rez de Deza, to the See of Santo Domingo. * Lost territories again : on 1531.06.21 to establish the Diocese of Coro (soon its suffragan), on 1534.01.10 to establish the Diocese of Santa Marta, on 1534.12.18 to establish the Diocese of Guatemala (soon its suffragan) and in 1539 to establish the Diocese of Honduras * Pope Paul III on 12 February 1546 elevated Santo Domingo to Metropolitan Archdiocese of Santa Domingo, and the incumbent of the see at the time, Bishop Alonso de Fuenmayor, became its first archbishop. As first the newly Metropolitan see of Santo Domingo had five Caribbean suffragan sees: two Antillian -Diocese of Puerto Rico and Diocese of Santiago (de Cuba) on Cuba- and three continental : Diocese of Coro (its daughter) in Venezuela, Diocese of Santa Marta in Colombia and the Diocese of Guatemala (its daughter). * In 1848 it was demoted as non-metropolitan Archdiocese of Santo Domingo / Sancti Dominici (Latin) * Lost (Haitian) territories (French side of Hispaniola island) on 1861.10.03 to establish Metropolitan Archdiocese of Port-au-Prince, Diocese of Cap-Ha√Øtien, Diocese of Les Cayes, Diocese of Les Gonaives and Diocese of Port-de-Paix * Promoted back on 1953.09.25 as Metropolitan Archdiocese of Santo Domingo / Sancti Dominici (Latin), having lost more territories to establish Diocese of Santiago de los Caballeros (now Metropolitan), Diocese of La Vega and Territorial Prelature of San Juan de la Maguana (now Roman Catholic Diocese of San Juan de la Maguana) * Lost territories thrice later : on 1959.04.01 to establish Diocese of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Altagracia en Hig√ºey, on 1986.11.08 to establish Diocese of Ban√≠ and on 1997.02.01 to establish Diocese of San Pedro de Macor√≠s. * It enjoyed Papal visits from Pope John Paul II (January 1979, October 1984 and October 1992.10).

He was a son of Emperor Wen and his powerful wife Empress Dugu, and during most of his father's reign was given great control over the modern Sichuan and Chongqing region. In 602, after accusations were made that Yang Xiu was abusing his power, Emperor Wen removed him from power and reduced him to commoner rank. He was subsequently held under house arrest for the rest of Emperor Wen's reign and the reign of his brother Emperor Yang. In 618, after the general Yuwen Huaji killed Emperor Yang, he and his co-conspirators briefly considered declaring Yang Xiu emperor, but ultimately decided not to, and instead executed Yang Xiu and his sons. Background It is not known exactly when Yang Xiu was born, but it is known that he was the fourth of the five sons of Yang Jian and Yang Jian's wife Dugu Qieluo. As the third of his older brothers, Yang Jun, was born in 571 (his younger brother, Yang Liang, similarly has an unknown birth year) and he was already born at least by the time that Yang Jian seized the throne from Emperor Jing of Northern Zhou, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui Dynasty as its Emperor Wen in 581, he would have been born sometime between 572 and 579. In 581, after Emperor Wen took the throne, he appointed both of his sons as imperial princes, and Yang Xiu was appointed the Prince of Yue. During Emperor Wen's reign In winter 581, the official Xuan Min (ÂÆ£Êïè), after returning from an inspection of the Shu region (modern Chongqing and Sichuan), suggested that Emperor Wen should make the region the fief for one of his sons, pointing out the region's wealth and strategic importance and that Northern Zhou had fallen because its imperial princes lacked the power to defend the state. Emperor Wen liked the proposal, and so changed Yang Xiu's title to Prince of Shu and made him the commandant of Yi Province (roughly modern Chengdu, Sichuan), in charge of the 24 surrounding provinces. Emperor Wen made the official Yuan Yan (ÂÖÉÂ∑ñ) Yang Xiu's chief of staff, and it was said that Yuan served Yang Xiu capably, keeping his behavior proper. Yang Xiu did not participate in the campaign against Chen Dynasty in 589 that destroyed Chen and unified China, in which his older brothers Yang Guang the Prince of Jin and Yang Jun the Prince of Qin participated; instead, the soldiers from his region were commanded by Yang Su, implying that Yang Xiu might not be old enough to command troops personally by this point. In 592, Yang Xiu appeared to be briefly recalled to the capital Daxing to serve as the head of the legislative branch of government, the Neishi Sheng (ÂÖßÂè≤ÁúÅ), when Emperor Wen put him and the official Yu Qingze (ËôûÊÖ∂Ââá) in charge of investigating claims that the deputy head of the executive branch, the Shangshu Sheng (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ), Su Wei, had been engaging in factionalism. Yang Xiu and Yu found Su to be guilty, and Emperor Wen stripped Su of his titles. (It appeared that briefly thereafter, Yang Xiu returned to Yi Province.) In 598, Yang Xiu submitted an accusation that the general Shi Wansui (Âè≤Ëê¨Ê≠≤) had received bribes from the chief of the Nanning Tribe (ÂçóÂØßÂ§∑), Cuan Wan (Áà®Áø´), in 597, to permit Cuan, after surrendering to Shi after a revolt, not be taken to Daxing, allowing Cuan to rebel again in 598. Emperor Wen nearly executed Shi over the accusation, but eventually spared him and reduced him to commoner rank. Over the years, as Yang Xiu became more and more accustomed to ruling over the region and grew arrogant and wasteful beyond the appropriate levels for an imperial prince. After Yuan Yan died in 593, without anyone to check his behavior, he made an armillary sphere ‚Äì an item that only an emperor would be permitted to have. He also seized many men of the Liao (Áç†) tribe and castrated them to serve as his eunuchs, and used vehicles and decorations only appropriate for an emperor. Emperor Wen often told Empress Dugu, \\"Yang Xiu will surely suffer a violent end. While I do not need to worry while I am alive, when his brother becomes emperor, he will surely revolt.\\" In one of the campaigns against Cuan Wan's forces, Yang Xiu sent his jester Wan Zhiguang (Ëê¨Êô∫ÂÖâ) to serve as the assistant to the general Yang Wutong (Ê•äÊ≠¶ÈÄö). Emperor Wen, finding this out and believing this act to be inappropriate, began to divide the forces under Yang Xiu's command. In 600, Yang Xiu's oldest brother Yang Yong the Crown Prince, over false accusations made by Yang Guang and Yang Guang's ally Yang Su, was deposed, and Yang Guang replaced Yang Yong as crown prince. Yang Xiu was displeased over the development, and Yang Guang was worried that Yang Xiu would make trouble for him. He instructed Yang Su to collect evidence of Yang Xiu's improper behavior and submit it to Emperor Wen. In fall 602, Emperor Wen summoned Yang Xiu back to the capital, sending the general Dugu Jie (Áç®Â≠§Ê•∑) to replace him. Yang Xiu considered refusing to return to Daxing, but decided not to resist after being advised by Yuan Shimin (Ê∫êÂ∏´Ê∞ë) otherwise. However, even after Dugu Jie arrived at Yi Province, Yang Xiu had not gotten underway, and it took further urging by Dugu Jie for him to actually depart. Yang Xiu, after leaving Yi Province, considered returning and attacking Dugu Jie, but Dugu Jie, who had taken precautions, had his army in a state of high alert, and therefore Yang Xiu gave up on the idea. While Yang Xiu was still en route back to Chang'an, his mother Empress Dugu died. When Yang Xiu arrived at Chang'an some three months after his departure from Yi Province, Emperor Wen refused to say anything to him while meeting him. Emperor Wen then sent messengers to severely rebuke him, and Yang Xiu begged for forgiveness. Yang Guang and the other imperial princes publicly begged for forgiveness on Yang Xiu's account as well, but Yang Guang secretly made two dolls with the names of Emperor Wen and Yang Liang the Prince of Han and curses against them and buried the dolls, and then had Yang Su dig them out and submit the dolls to Emperor Wen, along with evidence that Yang Xiu had made plans to attack the capital at some point. Around the new year 603, Emperor Wen reduced Yang Xiu to commoner rank and put him under house arrest within the Bureau of Eunuchs, not permitting him to meet with his wife and children. Yang Xiu submitted a petition for forgiveness, particularly asking to again see his favorite son, whose nickname was Guazi (ÁìúÂ≠ê). Further incensed by the petition, Emperor Wen issued an edict accusing Yang Xiu of 10 crimes, particularly stating, \\"I do not know what kind of relatives 'Yang Jian' and 'Yang Liang' are to you.\\" Yang Su also took this opportunity to falsely accuse certain political enemies to be Yang Xiu's associates and had them banished. During Emperor Yang's reign In 604, Emperor Wen died‚Äîa death that traditional historians commonly believed to be a murder ordered by Yang Guang, even though those historians admit that they had no direct evidence of it. Yang Guang took the throne as Emperor Yang. He continued to hold Yang Xiu under house arrest, and whenever he took tours of the country (of which he had 11 during his reign), he usually took Yang Xiu with him. In 618, while Emperor Yang was at Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), Emperor Yang was killed in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji. Yuwen and his co-conspirators briefly considered declaring Yang Xiu emperor, but ultimately decided not to do so, and instead executed Yang Xiu and his seven sons.

It was proclaimed municipality in 1995. The town is mostly recognized for being the birthplace of renown vallenato composer Carlos Huertas and his song \\"El Cantor de Fonseca\\". Geography Dibulla limits to the west with the Magdalena Department; to the north with the Caribbean sea by the steps of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains (northeastern side). Located 74 km away from La Guajira's capital Riohacha en route to the city of Santa Marta, it is crossed by the river of the same name, the Dibulla River and also the J√©rez River. The municipality has a total area of 1,847 km¬≤ and its only 2 m above sea level. The average temperature is of 28 ¬∞C. Its main attraction relies on a recreational center called Maziruma, a beach resort. Government of La Guajira: Geography of Dibuya History Province of Guanebucanes (Green), part of the Government of Santa Marta created in the year 1524. The area of present-day municipality of Dibuya was inhabited predominantly during the Pre- Columbian era by indigenous tribes pertaining to the Koguis and Guanebucanes ethnic groups descendants of the Tairona civilization with a direct influence from the Wayuu ethnic group. During the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the indigenous village of Yaharo was first seen by Spanish explorers upon reaching the coasts of the Guajira Peninsula in 1502. In 1525, Spanish explorer Rodrigo de Bastidas visited the Yaharo Town and registered an account of the village. Dibuya: History A year before, in 1524 Bastidas had created the Government of Santa Marta which covered an area from Cabo de la Vela to the mouth of the Magdalena River.

Between 1609 and 1640, the Spanish colonizers imported some 800 or more African slaves. Most of these later escaped and formed Palenques. In 1679 the Government of Santa Marta offered these palenques their freedom in exchange of protecting the territory from English pirates.

He was a son of Emperor Wen and his powerful wife Empress Dugu, who, during his father's reign, controlled the region north of the Yellow River. After his father's death in 604, he rose against his brother Emperor Yang, but was soon defeated by Emperor Yang's general Yang Su and forced to surrender. He was reduced to commoner rank and imprisoned for the rest of his life. Background It is not known exactly when Yang Liang was born, but it is known that he was the youngest of the five sons of Yang Jian and Yang Jian's wife Dugu Qieluo. As the third of his older brothers, Yang Jun, was born in 571 (the fourth, Yang Xiu, similarly has an unknown birth year) and he was already born at least by the time that Yang Jian seized the throne from Emperor Jing of Northern Zhou, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui Dynasty as its Emperor Wen in 581, he would have been born sometime between 573 and 580. In 581, after Emperor Wen took the throne, he created his sons imperial princes, and Yang Liang was created the Prince of Han. During Emperor Wen's reign Yang Liang did not participate in the campaign that destroyed rival Chen Dynasty in 589 and unified China (in which his older brothers Yang Guang the Prince of Jin and Yang Jun the Prince of Qin participated), suggesting that he was not yet old enough by that point. In 592, he was made the governor of the capital province Yong Province (ÈõçÂ∑û, roughly modern Xi'an, Shaanxi). In 597, he was made the commandant at Bing Province (Âπ∂Â∑û, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and was in charge of the 52 provinces north of the Yellow River. In 598, when Emperor Wen attacked Goguryeo, Yang Liang served as co-commander of the operation (along with the general Wang Shiji ())‚Äîa campaign that ended disastrously, as a drought prevented food supplies from being sent by water, and therefore the army ran out of food. As it arrived at Liao River, the border between Sui and Goguryeo, there began to be an epidemic in the army. Further, the ships commanded by the former Chen general Zhou Luohou () encountered a storm and suffered great losses. The Sui forces were forced to withdraw, although Goguryeo then sued for peace. (During the campaign, the general Gao Jiong served as Yang Liang's lieutenant, and, due to his senior status, often disobeyed the young Yang Liang, causing Yang Liang to be so displeased that he complained to his mother Empress Dugu, further straining the relationship between Empress Dugu and Gao over Gao's refusal to endorse Yang Guang, her favorite son, as crown prince, and in 599, at Empress Dugu's urging, Emperor Wen removed Gao from his post.) In 599, when Sui forces attacked Tujue's Dulan Khan, Ashina Yongyul√º, Yang Liang was nominally the overall commander of the operations, but did not go to the front. In summer 600, when Dulan Khan's successor Bujia Khan Ashina Dianjue (), who was a rival claimant to the Tujue throne to the Sui-supported Qimin Khan Ashina Rangan, attacked Sui, Yang Liang was one of the four commanders (along with his brother Yang Guang and the generals Yang Su the Duke of Yue and Shi Wansui () the Duke of Taiping) sent by Emperor Wen to engage Bujia Khan, and they defeated him, although Yang Liang's contribution to the campaign was unclear. Meanwhile, Emperor Wen much favored Yang Liang, but Yang Liang was becoming ambitious and troubled by the removal of his oldest brother, Yang Yong, as crown prince in 600. (Yang Guang replaced Yang Yong as crown prince.) He therefore persuaded Emperor Wen that his headquarters at Taiyuan was the key to the defense against Tujue, so Emperor Wen permitted him to produce weapons and build up Taiyuan's defenses. Two of his trusted generals, Wang Kui () and Xiao Mohe, both of whom believed that they should have been given greater responsibility by Emperor Wen, also encouraged him to eventually consider rebelling. Yang Liang was further troubled after another brother, Yang Xiu the Prince of Shu, was deposed over charges of wastefulness in 602. (Part of the charges against Yang Xiu, which appeared to have been manufactured by Yang Guang, was that Yang Xiu secretly cursed Emperor Wen and Yang Liang, but there was no evidence indicating that Yang Xiu actually did so or that Yang Liang believed Yang Xiu did or resented Yang Xiu over it.) Rebellion against Emperor Yang In 604, Yang Guang became emperor (as Emperor Yang) after Emperor Wen's death. (Most traditional historians believe that Emperor Wen was murdered at Yang Guang's order, although they admit a lack of direct evidence.) Emperor Yang, apprehensive of Yang Liang's intentions, did not initially announce Emperor Wen's death, and sent the general Qutu Tong () to Taiyuan to, using an edict in Emperor Wen's name, summon Yang Liang to the capital Daxing. However, Yang Liang figured out the edict to be a forgery, and declared a rebellion, supported by governors of 19 provinces. However, even though Wang Kui pointed out to him that he needed to make a quick election between the strategies of attacking Daxing quickly (in which case he needed to advance as fast as he could) or to try to hold his territory north of the Yellow River (in which case he needed to make certain that the generals in charge of his operations were largely people from the old territory of Northern Qi), Yang Liang could not decide which set of strategies to use, and therefore used a mixed approach. As his rationale for rebelling, he declared that Yang Su had committed treason. (As the modern historian Bo Yang pointed out, falsely accusing Yang Su of treason was an unconvincing declaration. Bo suggested that even if Yang Liang had not known about Yang Guang's involvement in Emperor Wen's death by that point, he still nevertheless should have accused Yang Guang of patricide.) Yang Liang made initial gains, and his forces, commanded by Pei Wen'an (), quickly captured the strategically important Pu Province (Ëí≤Â∑û, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) and were poised to cross the Yellow River to attack the capital region. For reasons unclear then, Yang Liang changed his mind and destroyed the bridge over the Yellow River, stalling his own advances, although he soon advanced south from Taiyuan himself to again make another offensive. Soon, Yang Su, loyal to Emperor Yang, advanced north and met Yang Liang's forces. Against Wang's suggestion that he should engage Yang Su quickly, Yang Liang withdrew to Qingyuan (Ê∏ÖÊ∫ê, near Taiyuan), thus losing initiative. Yang Su defeated him and captured Xiao Mohe, forcing him to retreat back to Taiyuan, where Yang Su put him under siege. Wang Kui committed suicide. Eventually, Yang Liang surrendered. Even though officials largely suggested that Yang Liang should be executed, Emperor Yang did not do so, but reduced him to commoner rank and put him under imprisonment. He died in imprisonment, and although it was unclear the year he died, it appeared to be not long after his capture. His son Yang Hao (Ê•äÈ°•, different person than Yang Jun's son who later was declared emperor) was also imprisoned, and when Emperor Yang was assassinated by the general Yuwen Huaji in 618, Yang Hao was also killed.

She was the second consort and only Queen consort of Frederick IV of Naples. Isabella was also suo jure Duchess of Andria and Venosa and Princess of Altamura.  Biography  Isabella was the daughter of Pietro Del Balzo, duke of Andria and Prince of Altamura, and Maria Donata Orsini of Venosa. Pietro had served as Grand Constable of the Kingdom of Naples but had been strangled to death in 1487. Isabella was in 1483 engaged to the heir of Naples, Francis, but he died prior to their wedding. Her father was imprisoned for having participated in a plot against the monarch. Isabella was by then engaged to the next heir to the crown of Naples, Frederick. The purpose of the marriage was to annex the territories of her parents in to the Kingdom of Naples. In the marriage contract, she was declared to be the heir of her parents' territories, despite the fact that she was not their eldest child, which meant that her fiefs were to be inherited by her issue and then further in to the Napolese royal house. On 28 November 1487 in Andria, Isabella married Prince Frederick of Naples. He was the second son of Ferdinand I of Naples and his first consort, Isabella of Clermont. Upon marriage, she was declared Duchess regnant of Andria and Venosa and Princess regnant of Altamura. After the wedding she therefore remained in the Castle of Andria in Apulia, rather than joining the royal court of Naples. In 1495, during the war against France, Isabella was ordered by Frederick to seize control over the Castle of Bari and repair its fortifications, which she did. She managed the administration of the territory and its taxation, and also entered into negotiations with the French. She was however forced to flee to Brindisi, and later joined her consort in Otranto, before settling down in Lecce. On 7 September 1496, Frederick succeeded his childless nephew Ferdinand II of Naples. Isabella became his Queen consort for five years. At the time of his succession, Isabella was in Lecce. She was told of his succession on 12 October, and asked to join him in Naples. She traveled toward Naples by many of the cities in the kingdom, where she received celebrations of herself as queen. She was however forced to stay on her way in Arienzo after a rebellion had erupted, and reached Naples in October 1497. Not until February 1498 was she able to reunite with Frederick as queen in Naples. A combination of King Louis XII of France and King Ferdinand II of Aragon had continued the claim of Louis' predecessor, King Charles VIII of France, to Naples and Sicily. In 1501 their alliance deposed Frederick; Naples initially went to Louis. Frederick and Isabella spent the following years in exile. Isabella initially escaped to Ischia with her children in August 1501, but later followed Frederick to France, where he was given an allowance. In 1503, they moved to the Duchy of Maine. Frederick died in Tours on 9 November 1504. His death gave Isabella grave financial difficulties. Isabella found a refuge for herself and younger children in the Duchy of Ferrara under the protection of Frederick's nephew Alfonso d'Este, and lived there until her death, never remarrying.George Nugent, \\"Jacquet's Tributes to the Neapolitan Aragonese,\\" The journal of musicology VI/2 (spring 1988), pp. 198-226. She spent her later life in poverty and relied on charity from relatives. In 1526, she asked for help from the pope to support her daughters. Isabella was portrayed by Baldassare Castiglione as an ideal example of a woman and a queen to have bravely endured her many strikes by faith.

He initially served in the military in the late Liang Dynasty, and gradually grew in stature and fame during the reigns of each of the emperors of Chen. When Sui forces attacked Chen in 589, Xiao resisted, and his defeat and capture sealed Chen's fate, allowing Sui to destroy Chen and unify China. He later served under Emperor Wen of Sui's son Yang Liang the Prince of Han, and became a major proponent of Yang Liang's rebellion against his brother Emperor Yang of Sui after Emperor Wen's death in 604. He was unable to stand against the attack of Emperor Yang's general Yang Su, however, and was captured and executed.  During Liang Dynasty  Xiao Mohe was born in 532, during the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang. When he was less than 10 years old, his father Xiao Liang () was made a commandery official at Shixing Commandery (ÂßãËàà, roughly modern Shaoguan, Guangdong), and Xiao Mohe accompanied his father to the commandery. His father died while in service there, and at that time, Cai Luyang (), who was had married either his sister or his aunt,The Book of Chen indicated that Cai was Xiao Mohe's uncle, while the History of Southern Dynasties indicated that Cai was Xiao's brother-in-law. was a member of the local gentry at nearby Nankang Commandery (ÂçóÂ∫∑, roughly modern Ganzhou, Jiangxi), and Cai took him and raised him. As Xiao Mohe grew in age, he became known for being resolute and strong. In 548, the rebel general Hou Jing rose against Emperor Wu and by 549 had captured the capital Jiankang, taking Emperor Wu and his crown prince Xiao Gang (the eventual Emperor Jianwen) hostage. In winter 549, the ambitious general Chen Baxian raised an army at Guang Province (Âª£Â∑û, roughly modern Guangdong) and planned to march north, eventually to head to Jiankang to attack Hou. His path, however, was blocked by Cai, who then controlled Nankang as a local warlord. Xiao served in Cai's forces and fought so fiercely that none of Chen's soldiers was a match for him, but eventually Cai was defeated, and Xiao surrendered.According to the History of Southern Dynasties, Xiao was 12 when this event happened, but this dating contradicts the other dates given for Xiao and therefore was likely an editor's error. Xiao became a subordinate of Chen's commander Hou Andu. He was part of Chen's campaign, as Chen joined with Wang Sengbian, the chief general of Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong (the eventual Emperor Yuan), to destroy Hou Jing. By 556, Chen was the regent over Emperor Jing, Emperor Yuan's son and the chief among the claimants for the Liang throne after Emperor Yuan's capture and execution by Western Wei in 555, after Chen ambushed and killed Wang Sengbian and deposed Xiao Yuanming, the candidate favored by Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi who was declared emperor by Wang. Wang's subordinates Ren Yue () and Xu Sihui () sought Northern Qi aid in resisting Chen, and Northern Qi forces soon arrived in Jiankang's vicinity. Chen sent Hou Andu to engage Northern Qi forces. Before battle, Hou commented to Xiao, \\"You are famed for your ferocity in battle, but seeing is better than hearing.\\" Xiao responded, \\"I will let you see today.\\" During the battle, Hou was having a hard time and was nearly captured by the enemy forces. Xiao experienced a surge of fury, roaring fiercely and single handedly fighting through the frontlines to save Hou from Northern Qi soldiers, and no men could stop him. Eventually, Hou was able to repel Northern Qi forces, and for his accomplishments was created a duke. It is not clear whether and how Xiao was awarded, although it was said that Xiao was one of the few subordinates that Hou treated with respect and honor.  During Chen Dynasty  In 557, Chen Baxian seized the throne from Emperor Jing, establishing Chen Dynasty as its Emperor Wu. Xiao Mohe's superior, Hou Andu, served as a major general under Emperor Wu, and became particularly prominent after Emperor Wu died in 559 and was succeeded by his nephew Emperor Wen. However, Hou came under Emperor Wen's suspicions in 563, and Emperor Wen forced him to commit suicide. The impact of Hou's death on Xiao's career is unclear, but prior to Hou's death he participated with distinction in the campaigns against the warlords Liu Yi () (561-562, a campaign commanded by Hou) and Ouyang Ge () (569-570), and for those accomplishments he was eventually promoted to the post of governor of Bashan Commandery (, roughly modern Ji'an, Jiangxi). It was as the governor of Bashan Commandery that Xiao served under the major general Wu Mingche in 573 as Wu, commissioned by Emperor Wen's brother Emperor Xuan, led a campaign against Northern Qi, seeking to capture the region between the Yangtze River and the Huai River. The Chen forces under Wu were intimidated by a small vanguard force in the Northern Qi army, commanded by the Xianbei generals Wei Pohu () and Zhangsun Hongl√ºe (), this elite squad consisted of tens of sturdy looking fighters with great physical strength and they were all above 1.9 metres tall, and accompanied by a sharpshooting Eurasian bowsman from the Western Regions (Xiyu). Wu informed Xiao of this, while praising him as having fortitude equivalent to Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. In response, Xiao first sought out the Xiyu bowsman, charged forward and killed him with a dart, and then dozens of fighters from the elite squad came forth and challenged Xiao to a small battle, Xiao fought fiercely and eventually slew all of them, leading to the Northern Qi forces' losing morale and collapsing. Wei fled, while Zhangsun was killed in battle. Wu was eventually able to capture all of the region between the Yangtze and the Huai later that year. For Xiao's contributions, he was created the Count of Lianping and soon promoted to the rank of marquess. During the subsequent minor campaigns against Northern Qi over the next several years, Xiao also contributed. After Northern Zhou destroyed Northern Qi in 577, Emperor Xuan wished to contend for the Xu Province (, roughly modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) region, and he sent Wu to attack the region in winter 577. Xiao served under Wu. Initially, Wu defeated the Northern Zhou governor of Xu Province Liang Shiyan, forcing Liang to withdraw inside Pengcheng (, the capital of Xu Province) and defend it. Wu put Pengcheng under siege. In spring 578, the Northern Zhou general Wang Gui arrived with a force to lift the siege, and he, as his first step, cut off Wu's supply route (and escape path). Xiao Mohe advised Wu to attack Wang as quick as he could to prevent the supply route from being cut off, but Wu did not follow Xiao's suggestion. Soon, the Chen forces were trapped. Wu subordinates suggested destroying the levee near Pengcheng so that the area would flood, allowing them to escape by ships. Wu agreed, but believing that he, as the commanding general, should withdraw last, did so, sending Xiao with the cavalry first. The cavalry was therefore able to escape, but most of the foot soldiers‚Äî30,000‚Äîand Wu himself were captured by Wang and taken to the Northern Zhou capital Chang'an. Xiao was able to return to Jiankang and continued to serve as a general under Emperor Xuan. In 580, after Northern Zhou captured the region between the Yangtze and Huai from Chen, Emperor Xuan made an attempt to recapture the territory, and Xiao served in the campaign along with Emperor Xuan's nephew Chen Huiji (), but after he was unable to capture Guangling (, in modern Huaiyin, Jiangsu), he withdrew. Another campaign waged by Xiao and Zhou Luohou () in 581 also ended in failure. In 582, Emperor Xuan died, and his son Chen Shuling () tried to assassinate the crown prince Chen Shubao, but only managed to wound, not kill, Chen Shubao. Chen Shuling fled back to his mansion and mobilized troops under his command, and he made overtures to Xiao Mohe, asking Xiao to join his coup attempt. Xiao initially pretended to agree, and when Chen Shuling sent his associates Dai Wen () and Tan Qi () to confer with Xiao, Xiao beheaded them and hang their heads on the city walls. Chen Shuling's troops lost morale and collapsed, and he was killed. For Xiao's contribution, Chen Shubao, who soon took the throne, created Xiao the Duke of Suijian and awarded Chen Shuling's considerable wealth to Xiao. He also selected Xiao's daughter to be the wife and crown princess of his son and crown prince Chen Yin. He also granted Xiao several honors normally reserved for the highest-ranked officials. He subsequently made Xiao the governor of Southern Xu Province (, roughly modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), to defend against potential attacks by Northern Zhou's successor state Sui Dynasty from Guangling. In spring 589, when Xiao was at Jiankang, the Sui general Heruo Bi () took the chance to cross the Yangtze (as part of the overall campaign by Emperor Wen of Sui to destroy Chen) and captured Jingkou (, the capital of Southern Xu Province). Soon, Heruo arrived at Zhongshan (now Purple Mountain), near Jiankang, and Xiao volunteered to engage Heruo. Chen Shubao agreed, despite warnings by another major general, Ren Zhong (), not to engage Heruo. Xiao's own motivation level was said to be low, however, due to an affair that Chen Shubao was having with Xiao's wife. Heruo defeated him and captured him. Heruo threatened him with beheading, and yet Xiao would not prostrate himself. Heruo was impressed and spared Xiao. Subsequently, Heruo captured Chen Shubao as well, and Xiao obtained permission to cook and serve Chen Shubao one final meal from the Chen imperial kitchen as well as to make a tearful farewell‚Äîacts that greatly impressed Sui's Emperor Wen.  During Sui Dynasty  Emperor Wen made Xiao Mohe a general, but unlike the situation with Zhou Luohou, did not give him great responsibilities. However, when Xiao Mohe's son Xiao Shil√ºe () participated in resistance campaigns by former Chen subjects against Sui rule, Emperor Wen pardoned Xiao Mohe from any punishments that he would otherwise have suffered based on Xiao Shil√ºe's rebellion, on the basis that Emperor Wen believed that Xiao Shil√ºe was forced to participate. In 604, when Emperor Wen died and was succeeded by Emperor Yang, Xiao was serving under Emperor Yang's brother Yang Liang the Prince of Han, who was the commandant at Bing Province (, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Yang Liang, not willing to yield to Emperor Yang, rebelled, a rebellion encouraged by Xiao and Wang Kui (, Wang Sengbian's son). However, when Xiao engaged Emperor Yang's general Yang Su, Yang Su defeated and captured him, and then had him executed. His sons were not killed but were seized as imperial servants, and his subordinate Chen Zhishen () took his body and gave it a proper burial.

In 1997, WDOD-FM switched from country music to Triple-A \\"The Mountain.\\" The station was considering a switch to mostly classic rock with some new rock mixed in, though WSKZ was already doing this. Research showed that listeners wanted mostly new rock with some classics. One possible approach to this was modern adult contemporary, but this might have hurt sister station WDEF-FM. Regardless of the market, Triple-A had the same songs representing about half the playlist, but the rest were different on each station. On The Mountain, artists included Jewel, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Talking Heads. A sample hour of music included Collective Soul, Third Eye Blind, Chris Isaak, Stone Temple Pilots, EMF, Van Halen, Dave Matthews Band, Joan Osborne, Bruce Springsteen, Vigilantes of Love, Loverboy, No Doubt, Aerosmith, and U2. Many songs were familiar and had been hits (an unusual approach to alternative), but they were not heard in the Chattanooga market. One characteristic that made The Mountain different was attitude, which other area stations did not have. DJs and liners attacked the competition as well as artists such as Michael Bolton and Barry Manilow. Operations Manager Danny Howard did not want to go overboard, and, having worked in AC, he personally felt uncomfortable with making fun of Bolton.

Description and history The Church of the Holy Family stands in central Cahokia, at the southeast corner of East 1st and Church Streets. The church campus includes three buildings: the 1799 church, a modern 20th-century sanctuary, and a parish house. The 1799 church is a log structure, measuring about . It is built out of heavy walnut timbers that were hewn into rectangular shape and mortised into a wooden sill resting on stone slabs. The timbers are each about long, one foot wide and six inches thick, and are set about one foot apart. The spaces between them are filled with what was termed pierrotage, a mixture of rubblestone and clay. Each of the walls slopes slightly inward as it rises, and is braced by diagonal timbers. The roof trusses are of walnut and oak, and give the roof a bell-cast appearance. The only substantive alterations to the building have been relatively minor. Small wings were added in 1833, and in the 1890s the exterior was finished in wooden clapboards; the clapboards have since been removed. In 1949‚Äì1951 the structure's foundation underwent repairs, and some of its rotted members were replaced. The congregation was established in 1699, when priests from Quebec (New France) arrived with Father Pinet to establish a mission. The mission was ended about 1768, and the fate of its building is not known. In 1783, Cahokia was integrated from Province of Quebec to the United States. Construction of this church began about 1786, not long after the arrival of Father Paul St. Pierre, and was formally consecrated in 1799. It remained in use by the congregation for worship until 1891, when a new stone church was built adjacent. The log church was then converted into a parish hall, a role it played until its restoration in 1949‚Äì51. Each Sunday morning there is a Latin Mass starting at 9:00 A.M. The Holy Family Church right next door has an English Mass starting at 10:00 A.M.

The Los Angeles School redirects urban study away from notions of concentric zones and an ecological approach, used by the Chicago School during the 1920s, towards social polarization and fragmentation, hybridity of culture and auto-driven sprawl. History The first published identification of the Los Angeles (L.A.) School as such was by Mike Davis in his popular urban history of Los Angeles, City of Quartz (1990). According to Davis, the school emerged informally during the mid-1980s when an eclectic variety of neo-Marxist scholars began publishing a series of articles and books dealing exclusively with Los Angeles. During the school's formation, Davis cautiously estimated that the school had about twenty members scattered throughout Southern California and beyond, with some members purportedly residing as far away as Frankfurt, Germany.Dear, Michael J (2002). \\"The Resistible Rise of the L.A. School\\" pp3-16 in Dear, Michael J. (ed.)From Chicago to L.A.: Making Sense of Urban Theory. Sage Publications. Much of the work published by L.A. School members during the 1980s and early 1990s garnered considerable attention. However, while some members (e.g. Edward Soja and Mike Davis) became household names in urban theory, there was little consciousness of the school as its own entity, especially outside of Los Angeles. This changed in 1998, with the publication of an article by Michael J. Dear and Steven Flusty, which explicitly argued for the existence of a distinct L.A. School of Urbanism, of which its various theories, concepts, and empirical works could be pooled together to constitute a radical new conception of ‚Äòpostmodern urbanism.‚ÄôDear, Michael J. and Flusty, Steven (2000). ‚ÄúPostmodern Urbanism.‚Äù Annals of the Association of American Geographers. 90(1): 50-72 After Dear and Flusty's publication, Dear popularized the school through the production of a series of articles and books, including a full-length edited volume comparing the L.A. School to the Chicago School.Dear, Michael J. (ed.); 2002; From Chicago to L.A.: Making Sense of Urban Theory; Sage Publications Though much of the work of the L.A. School is still widely read in urban studies, the school's membership has declined substantially in recent years. At a retirement party for Soja in 2008 at which many purported members were present, only Michael J. Dear appeared to be willing to envisage the school's continued existence. This situation reflects the vital conceptual disagreements between members of the LA School, and especially between Dear and the other members. Members There is no official list of present or historic members of the Los Angeles School of Urbanism. Some thinkers who are commonly considered members include: *Michael Dear *Mike Davis *Allen J Scott *Edward Soja *Michael Storper *Jennifer Wolch Ideas The L.A. School has no official doctrine, and there is great diversity in the works of its various members. Nevertheless, there are several influences, themes, and concepts which are relatively consistent in the school's scholarship. Perhaps the central characteristic of the thought of the L.A. School is a sustained focus on Los Angeles in both empirical and theoretical work, often with the underlying claim that L.A. is the paradigmatic American metropolis of the 20th and 21st centuries. More than this, the L.A. School poses a challenge to, what many members see as, the dominant Chicago School of Urbanism.Dear, Michael J and Dahmann, Nicolas (2008). ‚ÄúUrban Politics and the Los Angeles School of Urbanism.‚Äù Urban Affairs Review. 44(2): 266-279 While the Chicago School presents a modernist theory of cities as based on social darwinist struggles for urban space, the Los Angeles School proposes a postmodern or postfordist vision. While not all members of the L.A. School identify as postmodernists, and in fact some (e.g. Mike Davis)Davis, Mike (1985). ‚ÄúUrban Renaissance and the Spirit of Postmodernism‚Äù New Left Review. I/151 are against the very concept, a focus on postmodernism is fundamental to many members of the L.A. School, who rely heavily upon theorists associated with postmodernism, such as Baudrillard, Foucault, Jameson, and Derrida. A further stream of work emerging from the LA School is represented by Scott and Storper's many publications on flexible specialization, agglomeration, and the economic dynamics of the contemporary metropolis. Scott and Storper's work differs from that of Dear and Soja by approaching urban theory from the perspective of postfordism rather than postmodernism. Scott and Storper represent one distinctive tendency in the LA School; Dear and Soja represent another. Criticism A number of criticisms have been raised against the Los Angeles School. Perhaps the most important of these is skepticism over the school's actual importance relative to its claims. For instance, one criticism is that its literature sometimes deceptively excludes discussions or citations of other important works on urban issues, to give readers the impression that the L.A. school is more radical, original, and important than it actually is. In particular, some critics think that the contemporary importance of the Chicago School is grossly overstated by L.A. theorists, and that little to no attention is allocated to extremely important scholarly materials produced in the period between the decline of the Chicago School and the emergence of the L.A. School, particularly the work of Marxist urban theorists like Manuel Castells, David Harvey, and Henri Lefebvre.Gottdiener, Mark.; Urban Analysis as Merchandising: The ‚ÄòLA School‚Äô and the Understanding of Metropolitan Development‚Äô pp157-181 in Eade, John and Mele, Christopher (eds.) (2008). Urban Analysis as Merchandising: The ‚ÄúLA School‚Äù and the Understanding of Metropolitan Development. Blackwell Publishers On a similar vein, much of the work of the L.A. School has been criticized for its incoherence and lack of a demonstrable methodology.Sui, Daniel Z (1999). Postmodern Urbanism Disrobed: or Why Postmodern Urbanism is a Dead End for Urban Geography. Urban Geography 20(5): 403-411. A final criticism questions the L.A. School's fundamental claim that Los Angeles should be considered the paradigmatic postmodern American city. This stems both from external comparisons which have been made between Los Angeles and other cities,Nijman, Jan (2000). The Paradigmatic City. Annals of the Association of American Geographers 90(1): 135-145.Bacon, Nicholas A (2010).‚ÄúLost in Dialectic: A Critical Introduction to Urban Space in Greater Hartford, 1633-2010.‚Äù Undergraduate Honors Thesis, Trinity College, CT. pp.32-55. and findings that in certain cases urban phenomena in Los Angeles do not match those of other American cities.

As a result of their diet, spongivore animals like the hawksbill turtle have developed sharp, narrow bird-like beak that allows them to reach within crevices on the reef to obtain sponges. Examples The hawksbill turtle is one of the few animals known to feed primarily on sponges. It is the only known spongivorous reptile. Sponges of various select species constitute up to 95% of the diets of Caribbean hawksbill turtle populations. Pomacanthus imperator, the emperor angelfish; http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079%5B1740:AIBSOA%5D2.0.CO;2 Lactophrys bicaudalis, the spotted trunkfish; and Stephanolepis hispidus, the filefish are known spongivorous coral reef fish. Certain species of nudibranchs are known to feed selectively on specific species of sponges.  Attacks and counter-attacks  Turret sponge, eaten by some spongivores. = Spongivore offense = The many defenses displayed by sponges means that their spongivores need to learn skills to overcome these defenses to obtain their food. These skills allow spongivores to increase their feeding and use of sponges. Spongivores have three primary strategies for dealing with sponge defenses: choice based on colour, able to handle secondary metabolites and brain development for memory. Choice based on colour was involved based on which sponge the spongivore would choose to eat. A spongivore would bite small sample of sponges and if they were unharmed that they would continue eating that specific sponge and then move on to another sponge of the same colour. Spongivores have adapted to be able to handle the secondary metabolites that sponges have. Therefore, spongivores are able to consume a variety of sponges without getting harmed. Spongivores also have enough brain development to be able to remember the same species of sponge it has eaten in the past and will continue to eat in the future. = Sponge defense = Sponge spicule A sponge defense is a trait that increases a sponge fitness when faced with a spongivore. This is measured relative to another sponge that lacks the defensive trait. Sponge defenses increase survival and/or reproduction (fitness) of sponges under pressure of predation from spongivore. The use of structural and chemical strategies found in sponges are used to deter predation.Hill, M., Lopez, N., & Young, K. (2005). Anti-predator defenses in western North Atlantic sponges with evidence of enhanced defense through interactions between spicules and chemicals. Marine Ecology Progress Series, 291, 93‚Äì102. doi:10.3354/meps291093 One of the most common structural strategies that sponges have that prevents them from being consumed by predators is by having spicules. If a sponge contains spicules along with organic compounds, the likelihood of those sponges being consumed by spongivores decrease. Sponges have also developed aposematism to help avoid predation. Spongivores have learned four things about sponges aposematism and they are as follows: # If it is poison some predators will not eat it # If It is conspicuously coloured, or advertises itself by means of some other signals; # Some predators avoid attacking it because of its signals # These conspicuous signals provide better protection to the individual or to its genes than would other (e.g. cryptic) signals.Pawlik, J., Chanas, B., Toonen, R., & Fenical, W. (1995). Defenses of Caribbean sponges against predatory reef fish. I. Chemical deterrency. Marine Ecology Progress Series, 127, 183‚Äì194. doi:10.3354/meps127183 Unfortunately, sponges that live in the deep sea are not at an advantage due to the colour because most colour in the deep sea is lost.Pinet, P. R. (2016). Invitation to oceanography. Burlington, MA: Jones et Bartlett Learning.  Impacts  Sponges play an important role in the benthic fauna throughout temperate, tropical and polar habitats.Bell, J. J. (2008). The functional roles of marine sponges. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 79(3), 341‚Äì353. doi:10.1016/j.ecss.2008.05.002 If there is a high volume of predation it can effect bio erosion, reef creation, multiple habitats, other species and help with the nitrogen levels. Bio erosion that occurs in the production of reef sediments and the structural component of corals are partly produced by sponges, where solid carbonate is processed into smaller fragments and fine sediments. Sponges also play a role in increasing the survival of live coral on Caribbean reefs by binding fragments together and is expected to increase the rates of carbonate accretion. The coral reefs that contain higher amounts of sponges have better survival rate than the reefs with fewer sponges. Sponges can act as a stabilizer during storms as they help keep the reefs intact when presented with a strong currents. Sponges also grown between rocks and boulders, providing a more stable environment and lowering the disturbance levels. Sponges also provide habitats for other organisms to live in, without them, these organisms would not have a protected habitat. Scientist have discovered that sponges play an important role in the nitrogen cycle. There are low amounts of nitrogen found in the water around coral reefs and most of the nitrogen that is found it bound into particulate or dissolved organic matter. Before this dissolved organic matter is able to be used by other reef organisms it must undergo a series of microbial transformations. The nitrogen cycle that occurs in sponges are able to cycle the nitrogen back into the water column and can be used by other organisms, especially cyanobacteria. The cyanobacteria then can then fix the atmospheric nitrogen and then the sponges can use it. Therefore, if there is a high amount of spongivores present in an environment, it can effect other aspects of the environment besides sponges.

Analy was established in 1908 and celebrated its centennial in May 2008. In 2011, the school was listed at #184 on Newsweeks list of \\"America's Best High Schools\\" for California schools. Analy was the only school in the Redwood Empire listed in the top 500, and ranked 20th overall out of all California private and public high schools. The school is located in Analy Township, which derives its name from the Annaly Ranch which was located in the township in the 1840s, which in turn was named for an Annaly in Ireland, which had connections to the settler Jasper O'Farrell.http://beehivedesignstudio.com/graton/GratonHistory.html The school and several facilities, including the library and some classrooms were used as setting of the popular Netflix TV show 13 Reasons Why, in which the school is called Liberty High School.http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/5749436-181/hollywood-comes-to-analy- high?artslide=0 History Analy was established in the town of Sebastopol in 1908, where it stood as the town's local school. It is primarily a college preparatory school. Many local parents are Analy graduates. The community supports the school; in 2004 they passed a $13,000,000 bond issue, and in 2006 they renewed a four-year parcel tax for another seven years. Although the town's population is small, the school serves an area of 50,000. The town it serves has changed from a rural community to a more suburban community in recent decades; many residents commute to metropolitan areas. Approximately 85% go directly to two or four-year colleges; the school ranks in the 98th percentile on sending students to two or four-year public schools. Analy is one of two comprehensive high schools in the West Sonoma County Union High School District, the other being El Molino High School in Forestville, California. Curriculum The high school district has 11 feeder elementary districts. Over the last three years these districts together have developed grade level standards K-12 in English, math, and social studies, and work continues in technology and science. Analy has a seven-period day and offers a wide variety of electives, including 11 programs in practical arts. Analy provides an almost entirely untracked curriculum for all students and a full range of AP and Honors classes in the five academic areas.Western Association of Schools and Colleges Report-WASC Students participate actively in athletics, performing arts, and debate.

Athletics  Analy has over 600 athletes on 38 teams in 21 sports each year. In 2009, the varsity boys' basketball team at Analy won the NCS Division III Final for the first time in the school's 101-year history. Other sports offered include football, volleyball, cross country, soccer, softball, baseball, swimming, tennis, golf, track and field, wrestling, and badminton.http://www.contracostatimes.com/high-school-sports/ci_11858310 The Analy High School football team was mentioned by Bruce Campbell's character, Sam Axe, in Burn Notice: The Fall of Sam Axe. He stated that the tactics he used to train the rebels were the secrets of the Analy High School football team.VIDEO Music =Band= There are four band classes and one orchestra class at Analy, with an average combined student participation of well over 200. The school has one of the highest instrumental music students per capita ratios in the State of California. The bands include a 0 period jazz band that starts at 6:45am every morning, an intermediate band, advanced band, honor band, and an orchestra, which were all under the direction of Vance Regan until 2013. The bands perform in two scheduled concerts per year and host the annual Band Wagon Fall Festival. The bands annually perform the national anthem at a San Francisco Giants game, travel to southern California to participate in the Disney Magic Music Days main street parade, and march in the local Apple Blossom Festival Parade. The honor band has received numerous awards and has participated in several Festival of Gold National competitions. The Analy bands are well known for masterful performances and exquisite class. Once a week, the orchestra winds and percussion meet at 6:00pm and adjourn at 7:30pm for rehearsal. The band has won numerous awards for their jazz, concert and orchestra programs. The jazz band and orchestra annually participate in the California Music Educators Association festivals and competitions. In 2011, the Analy orchestra was given a unanimous superior rating at a California Music Educators Association (CMEA) festival at Sonoma State University, the highest rating possible; this was the second consecutive year that the orchestra earned this honor. =Choir= Analy's choir department performs three concerts each year. The first concert is performed in the fall, the second in the winter, and the third in the spring. The choir department is divided into different choirs, which perform music at differing styles and levels of complexity. *Concert Choir: This is the beginning level choir, and it has no prerequisite to join. It primarily consists of freshmen and sophomores, though it is not limited to younger students. *Treble Choir: This is an all-female chorus. It is the second level for female singers, and students are required to audition before joining the treble choir. *Honor Choir: This is the advanced mixed-voice chorus. It is also an audition-only choir, and usually consists of singers who have graduated from the concert or treble choirs. The group is not limited though, and singers with potential are encouraged to audition even without experience in the previous two choirs. *Vocal Ensemble: This is not an actual course. It is a small group (usually consisting of 8-12 singers) that rehearses outside of class hours, usually once a week. This group often tackles music that is considered more challenging, both in technical and vocal facets, also consisting wholly of songs that are performed a cappella. Auditions for the group are held early in the year, and are limited to students in the Honor Choir. The Vocal Ensemble is a relatively new facet of the Choir Department, and was created in 2002. During the 2009/10 school year, the Analy High School Honor Choir was selected by DCINY to sing the entire piece of Faure's Requiem Mass at the Lincoln Center in New York City. The concert was set to take place in April, 2010, and was to be sung under the directing of Daniel Hughes. However, a call was received in mid-October saying the show was cancelled. Another show was set up at Carnegie Hall during the same time period, and the choir was to sing songs directed by contemporary composer Eric Whitacre. This was the first such cross country trip encountered by the Analy Honor Choir. *Each winter, the Honor Choir has traditionally performed the Hallelujah Chorus from Handel's Messiah as the last song of the evening. Alumni of the honor choir are invited to join the chorus on stage to perform with the choir. *Every spring, several graduating seniors are selected to direct a song each. They are given their choice of songs, and rehearse with their choir, as conductor, in place of Mr. Del Monte. They conduct their pieces on the night of the Spring Concert. *Each Graduation Day, the Honor Choir performs a song for the graduating seniors. Drama  The Drama department was headed by teacher/director Starr \\"Hergie\\" Hergenrather, who produced two shows per year, a non-musical in the fall, and a musical in the spring. The department annually attended the Lenaea Festival, a high-school theatre event held on the California State University, Sacramento campus. However, as of the 2017-2018 school year, Hergenrather is retiring, and the budget for the drama department has undergone a controversial budget cut by the district, in spite of the celebrated tradition of art at the school and in Sonoma County. The full-time position formerly held by Hergenrather has been reduced to a part-time position for a beginning theater class. Speech and debate Since its inception in 1995, Analy's High School's Speech and Debate Team has qualified varsity members to the state championships. It has also qualified members to many national championships for the last three years. Analy's team is a member of the Golden Gate Speech Association league, the California High School Speech Association (CHSSA), and the National Speech and Debate Association (formerly the National Forensics League). In addition to competing in local league tournaments and national invitationals, team members speak at local service club organizations such as the Lion's Club and Rotary Club, where they earn hundreds of dollars every year in scholarship money. Analy speakers place in the finals at nearly every league tournament, often going undefeated.

The district includes five distinct areas of Lebanon: the city's main commercial district, the neighborhood around McKendree University, two residential districts, and an archaeological site at the city limits. Development in Lebanon began in the 1820s, and McKendree University was founded in 1828. The oldest building from this period, the Mermaid House Hotel, is a Federal structure dating to 1830. The city received an influx of German immigrants from the 1830s onward, which affected the city's development. In the 1850s and 1860s, a railroad opened in the city and several local industries developed; however, the city retained the character of a small college town and never developed into an industrial or trade center. The historic district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 4, 1978.

It is currently receiving the attention of politicians in Scotland who have acknowledged that there has been underinvestment over the past few decades in keeping the infrastructure in line with the needs of the city. As an ancient city, Aberdeen has some beautiful infrastructure feature such as the Brig o' Balgownie and the Bridge of Dee. Like any other city, the advent of cars has however seen the creation of less beautiful infrastructure such as the Anderson Drive dual carriageway and the Haudagain Roundabout which sees constant tailbacks. Airport and heliport Aberdeen Airport terminal building Aberdeen Airport, in the neighbouring town of Dyce, serves primarily UK and European destinations for passenger and freight flights. It is also the busiest helicopter terminal in the world, serving the many North Sea oil offshore installations. Via commercial airlines, connections are available via London Heathrow, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt and Amsterdam airports to many worldwide destinations. The IATA airport code for the airport is ABZ. A regular airport bus service (route 727 operated by Stagecoach Bluebird) connects the airport directly with the city centre at Broad Street and the bus and railway stations at Union Square. Railway Aberdeen railway station =Historical= Aberdeen was connected to the railway network from the south with the opening of Aberdeen Ferryhill railway station in 1850. Three years later, the Deeside Railway opened and the following year the railway was extended to Guild Street. From the north, the Great North of Scotland Railway opened its terminus at Kittybrewster in 1854. A new terminus, Aberdeen Waterloo, opened two years later. The two railways weren't connected until 1967 when the Joint station opened at the site of the present day Aberdeen railway station. As with many parts of the UK rail network, several lines out of Aberdeen were closed in the 1960s. For example, the Deeside Railway which ran west of the city to Ballater opened in 1853 but the Beeching Report led to the closure of the line in 1966. The line is now a popular walk and cycle route, the Deeside Way. Further lines running north to the commuter town of Ellon and to Peterhead were also closed around this time. =Present day= There are two railway stations in Aberdeen. The main city-centre station is located on Guild Street, adjacent to Union Square which offers a covered interchange with the bus station. The only other station in Aberdeen City is Dyce to the north. Abellio ScotRail services connect Aberdeen to all six other Scottish cities, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, and many intermediate destinations. These services make use of the Glasgow to Aberdeen Line, Edinburgh to Aberdeen line and Aberdeen to Inverness Line. High-speed inter- city services operated by London North Eastern Railway connect Aberdeen to London via Edinburgh in just over seven hours on the East Coast Main Line. A regular stopping service, also run by ScotRail, serves Aberdeen along with all stations between Inverurie and Montrose. Inter-city services operated by CrossCountry connect Aberdeen to south-west England and numerous intermediate destinations such as Sheffield, Birmingham, Bristol and Exeter. In addition, the Caledonian Sleeper service makes an overnight journey to/from London Euston six days a week. Buses Bus services form the main public transportation system in Aberdeen. Most city buses are operated privately by FirstGroup via their subsidiary First Aberdeen (First's global headquarters are located in the city, on King Street). First Aberdeen has a monopoly on city bus services in Aberdeen partly due to their history. When bus services in the UK were privatised in the 1980s, those in Aberdeen were the subject of a management buy-out. The resulting company developed into FirstGroup following a number of mergers and acquisitions over the years. First Aberdeen has been criticised by local politicians and in the media for taking advantage of its monopoly with high fares and mediocre service.http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1361692 High bus fares prompt call for inquiry into monopoly The company has defended its frequent fare rises as being necessary due to high running costs and cuts to government subsidies. Bus firm 'forced' to increase fares Sign at Aberdeen bus station, Union SquareFirst Aberdeen have the largest share of routes in the city with 22 services currently running. They operate a hub-and-spoke network - the majority of routes begin at an outskirt or suburb, run through the city centre (often via at least part of Union Street) and then out to another suburb. For example, route 1 runs from Danestone in the north, to the city centre along Union Street, then out to Garthdee in the south-west. Services run at intervals from approximately every 15 minutes (during the day) to every 30 minutes (in the evening and on Sundays). All First Aberdeen buses require the exact fare as none carry change. Many of the routes date back to those formerly operated by trams. When the tram system was closed in the 1950s, the same routes were replaced by diesel buses. Many of these same routes, with minor alterations, still run today. Stagecoach Bluebird also operate a single cross-city route; their route 59 operates between Northfield and Balnagask via the city centre and Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. Stagecoach Bluebird also operate a frequent service linking the bus station at Union Square to Aberdeen Airport as route 727. Change is given on Stagecoach Bluebird services. Country bus services to outlying and rural villages and towns are also operated by Stagecoach Bluebird. Most start and terminate at the bus station at Union Square. They also pick up passengers at stops in the city. Routes such as the Coast Rider, (running between Montrose; Stonehaven; Newtonhill; Portlethen and Aberdeen) are popular, especially during rush hour with commuters working in the city. Longer-distance and inter-city buses operate from the bus station at Union Square. Frequent services to other Scottish cities are operated by Scottish Citylink and Megabus, including the luxury Citylink Gold service to/from Glasgow. National Express operates services to/from London via a number of towns and cities as well as Heathrow Airport. Roads There are six main roads into and out of the city: * The A92 runs north to the Blackdog interchange, where it joins the A90 for Ellon, Peterhead and Fraserburgh. * The A947 exits the city at Dyce and goes on to Oldmeldrum and Turriff, ending at Banff. * The A96 links to Elgin and Inverness in the north-west, passing through Inverurie, Huntly and Keith. * The A944 exits the city to the west, passing through Westhill before following Donside to Alford, Strathdon and Corgarff. * The A93 follows Deeside west to Banchory, Aboyne, Ballater and Braemar, then turns south, providing an alternative tourist route to Perth. * The A92 south joins the A90 at Stonehaven, then continues as the coastal route by Inverbervie, Montrose and Arbroath to Dundee and on into Fife, whilst the A90 from Stonehaven provides the primary route to Dundee, Perth and Edinburgh. The A90 Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route opened in stages during 2018 and 2019 and provides a bypass around the city from Blackdog in the north to Stonehaven in the south, diverting traffic away from the city centre and from the city's original ring road, Anderson Drive, built in the 1930s. Bridges Aberdeen's two main rivers, the Dee and Don are currently crossed by a variety of bridges, varying from modern structures to older stone bridges dating back hundreds of years. =River Dee crossings= Victoria Bridge, Torry The River Dee is crossed by a number of bridges, from east to west: *Victoria Bridge *Queen Elizabeth Bridge *Wellington Suspension Bridge *Railway bridge *King George VI Bridge *Bridge of Dee *St Devenick's Bridge *Maryculter Bridge Maryculter Bridge links the North and South Deeside roads near the village of Maryculter close to the boundary of the council area, the bridge is earmarked for expansion as part of the proposed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route to bypass the city. Victoria Bridge was completed in 1887, following a ferry disaster in 1876 which claimed the lives of 32 people returning from a visit to the Bay of Nigg. It was made possible by the 1871 channelling of the River Dee which had previously followed an unstable course to the sea. The bridge has facilities for carrying water and gas services across the river. Queen Elizabeth II Bridge opened in 1983. Wellington Suspension Bridge is very narrow and was designed by Captain Samuel Brown and opened in 1831 to replace the Craiglug ferry. Refurbished in 1930, the Category A listed building was closed to vehicular traffic in 1984 and to pedestrians in March 2002 due to structural concerns. However it was refurbished and re-opened as a pedestrian bridge in 2008.http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/821154 =River Don crossings= Brig o' Balgownie The River Don is crossed by a number of bridges, from east to west: *Bridge of Don *Brig o' Balgownie *Diamond Bridge *Grandholm Bridge *Persley Bridge The Bridge of Don has five granite arches, each 75 ft (23 m) in span, and was built 1827-1832. A little to the west is the Auld Brig o' Balgownie, a picturesque single arch spanning the deep black stream, said to have been built by King Robert I, and celebrated by George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron in the tenth canto of \\"Don Juan\\". It is closed to motor vehicles. The Grandholm Bridge is a private bridge, constructed for the Crombie Mills in the 1920s. Access to the bridge, other than for pedestrians and bicycles, is now controlled by an electronically activated barrier, passes for which are made available to residents of the housing development constructed on the site of the mills in 2004. The A92 road uses Persley Bridge. Sea Fisheries Research Vessel Scotia in Aberdeen Harbour Aberdeen Harbour was the first publicly limited company in the United Kingdom and is today the principal commercial port in northern Scotland and an international port for general cargo, roll-on/roll-off and container traffic. The harbour also serves NorthLink Ferries, which sail to Kirkwall, Orkney and Lerwick, Shetland. The Aberdeen Maritime Museum (on Shiprow in the city centre) includes exhibitions and displays which tell the story of the harbour and its role in the economy and development of the city. Originally, the defective harbour, with a shallow sand and gravel bar at its entrance, retarded the trade of Aberdeen, but under various acts since 1773 it was greatly deepened. By the Harbour Act of 1868, the river Dee near the harbour was diverted from the south at a cost of ¬£80,000, and 90 acres (364,000 m¬≤) of new ground, in addition to 25 acres (101,000 m¬≤) formerly made up, were provided on the north side of the river for the Albert Basin (with a graving dock), quays and warehouses. A 1050 ft (320 m) long concrete breakwater was constructed on the south side of the stream as a protection against south- easterly gales. On Girdleness, the southern point of the bay, a lighthouse was built in 1833. The North Pier, built partly by John Smeaton 1775-81, and partly by Thomas Telford 1810-15, extends nearly 3,000 ft (1000 m) into the North Sea and raised the bar. Victoria Dock, named in honour of the queen's visit to the city in that year, is a wet dock of 29 acres (117,000 m¬≤) and with 6000 ft (1800 m) of quay, was completed in 1848 Upper Dock adjoins Victoria Dock. =Ferry services to the Northern Isles= NorthLink Ferries provides daily vehicle and foot-passenger service to Lerwick, Shetland, and regular service to Kirkwall, Orkney. On this route it operates two vessels, Hjaltland and Hrossey. These services arrive and depart at the ferry terminal which can be accessed off Market Street. The vessel can usually be clearly seen from the street when docked. Trams The last tram ran on 3 May 1958. All but one were then scrapped; the last is on display in the Grampian Transport Museum at Alford, Aberdeenshire.

Biography Rossanda was born in Pula, then part of Italy. She studied in Milan and was a student of philosopher Antonio Banfi. At a very young age, she took part in the Italian resistance and, following the end of World War II, she joined the Italian Communist Party (PCI). After a short period, secretary Palmiro Togliatti named her responsible for culture in the party. She was elected for the first time to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 1963. In 1968 she published a small essay, entitled L'anno degli studenti (\\"The Year of the students\\"), in which she declared her support for the youth movement. Rossanda was part of a minority inside the PCI that was against the Soviet Union, and, together with Luigi Pintor, Valentino Parlato, and Lucio Magri founded the party and newspaper il manifesto. This caused her expulsion from the Communist Party after its XII National Congress held in Bologna. In the 1972 elections, Il Manifesto obtained only 0.8% of the votes. It therefore merged with the Proletarian Unity Party, forming the Proletarian Unity Party for Communism. She later abandoned party politics but kept her role as director of il manifesto.

Educated at the Irish College in Paris, he taught at the English college at Saint-Omer. In 1783, Delaney was appointed coadjutor to James Keeffe, Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin. Together, they established St. Patrick's, Carlow College. Delany later founded the Brigidine Sisters, and the Patrician Brothers. Biography =Early life= He was born in 1747, the first of two sons into a well-to-do farming family on the Castlecoote Estate. His father Daniel and younger brother John died when Daniel was still young. Daniel attended the local Hedge school at Briscula, just a few kilometres from his home. His mother, Elizabeth Delany (n√©e Fitzpatrick) sent him to her sisters, who had a shop in town, to gain a better education.Sr. M. Claude, C.S.B., \\"Dr. Daniel Delaney\\", Carloviana Vol 2. No. 27. 1978/79 p. 30 &31. As the public practice of Catholicism was outlawed by British Law at the time, in 1763, with the help of a good Protestant friend, the sixteen year old Delany was smuggled out of Ireland to Paris to study for the priesthood at the Irish College in Paris. He was ordained a priest in 1770. For the next five or six years Delany taught rhetoric at the English College at Saint-Omer in France.The Bishop Daniel Delany Story Carlow Nationalist, 6 February 2015. Father Delany returned to Ireland in 1776, disguised as a layman since priests were still outlawed. He was so appalled at the state of Ireland that he was tempted to return to France. However, his mother prevailed on him to stay in Ireland. Soon after arriving he was stationed at Tullow as assistant priest. Catholic education in Ireland had been denied to the people of Ireland since the seventeenth century; in consequence, much of the population suffered from poverty, hunger and drunkenness. Delany tried to bring back the traditional Catholic education to the community. He started by the establishment of Sunday schools for the youth of Tullow.\\"Bishop Daniel Delany\\", The Brothers of St. Patrick He also formed a youth band to help teach his students hymns.Minehan csb, Rita. \\"From the Acorn to the Oak\\" Soon older people of the community started to join these classes. Bishop In April 1783 Delany was appointed Coadjutor to Bishop James Keeffe of the Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin, choosing as his motto Fortiter et Suaviter. =St. Patrick's College= With some relaxation of the Penal Laws in 1782, many Irish priests including Bishops Keeffe and Delany worked to rebuild churches, monasteries, convents and schools. In 1782 Keeffe and Delany began planning for the establishment of a tertiary college for the education of both lay students and those studying for the priesthood. St. Patrick's College was originally planned for Tullow but in the end, had to be situated in Carlow fifteen kilometres away. Keeffe died in 1787 but he was able to witness the beginning of construction. It was left to Bishop Delany and Fr Henry Staunton of Carlow to get the college finished. For financial reasons, it did not open until 1793, with Staunton as its first president. St. Patrick's, Carlow is the oldest surviving Catholic tertiary college in Ireland preceding St Patrick's College, Maynooth by two years. In 1784, Delany organized a procession through Tullow for the Feast of Corpus Christi. He also decided to start ringing the Angelus bell, which hadn't been done for a century. This caused some consternation, with Bishop Keeffe, concerned it would lead to trouble. With the death of Bishop Keeffe in 1787 Bishop Delany was appointed Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin on 17 February 1788. Sometime after 1794, his mother died, leaving him all her property. Delany invested a portion of this property left to him and the interest went to charities. Delany also distributed prayer books to children on the day of their first communion. He started a circulating library and was responsible for the building of a church in both Tullow (1805) and Mountrath (1810). In 1807 Delany refounded the Congregation of St. Brigid, the Brigidine Sisters, and in 1808, the Congregation of The Brothers of St. Patrick in Tullow, County Carlow. In the convent gardens, Delany planted an oak sapling from Kildare. Today many of the Brigidine communities have an oak tree growing from the seed of an oak tree in Kildare. Bishop Delany died at two in the morning on 9 July 1814. He had been seriously ill for some months and was being cared for by the Brigidine Sisters in their convent. He is buried in his Tullow church.

He is widely recognized as a progenitor of the figuration libre movementhttp://www.latribune.fr/loisirs/marche-de-l- art/20090622trib000390902/figuration-libre.html that began in Paris around 1980 as a reaction to the art establishment in general and minimalism and conceptual art in particular. Figuration libre is often regarded as having roots in Fauvism and Expressionism and is linked to contemporary movements such as Bad Painting and Neo-expressionism. It draws on pop cultural influences such as graffiti, cartoons and rock music in an attempt to produce a more varied, direct and honest reflection of contemporary society, often satirizing or critiquing its excesses. Combas‚Äô own work has always been strongly rooted in depictions of the human figure. The figures are often in wild, violent or orgiastic settings. Usually on large, often unstretched canvases, Combas crowds his flat pictorial space with a teeming proliferation of bodies, street poetry and designs reminiscent of the compulsive patterning in much folk and outsider art. He creates hectic narratives of war, crime, sex, celebration and transgression‚Äîin short, every phase that makes up the constant flux of modern life. In recent years a strong autobiographical strain has been evident in his work, which was present only on a subliminal level, if at all, in the earlier work. Combas often seems to be offering the work as critique‚Äîof both the art establishment and society at large. The recent painting ‚ÄúI am greedy man‚Äù features a densely layered jostle of bodies, with the foreground dominated by transparent line figures, the background occupied by monochromatic figures and the middle ground reserved for two more fully realized figures, one in a business suit and the other muscular and shirtless. They dance in a swirl of text which seems to have no discernible beginning or end but which may be read as: ‚ÄúI am greedy man/ Please shout me babe/ Soul serenade is a lot of pussy/ Pussy gone on the Eiffel Tower/ My Eiffel Tower is long and large.‚Äù The lampoon of a society where all are anonymous except in the individual recognition of need and gratification is typical of Combas‚Äô work throughout his career. While Combas‚Äô works often seem to carry an element of shock or confrontation, he insists the images are meant to engage the viewer, and their execution in vibrant color and bold, unfettered line communicate a spirit of proletarian camaraderie that offsets the tendency to overwhelm, in the larger works especially. In a biographical note on Robert Combas‚Äô official website the artist asserts his aim is to > ‚Äúprovoke, that is, to trigger a reaction in the spectator only to ‚Äòinvite‚Äô > him, beckoning him in and whispering in his ear ‚Äòcome over and talk to me, I > want to tell you about the stupidity, violence, beauty, love, hatred, > seriousness and fun, the logic and senselessness that pervade our day-to-day > lives‚Äô ‚Äù.

The station is operated by World Christian Broadcasting, a non-profit company based in the United States. KNLS broadcasts 20 hours a day of Christian-themed programming in Chinese, English and Russian. History Offices of KNLS on Norman Lowell Road, outside of Anchor Point near the transmission towers. The idea for KNLS came about during World War II, when Maurice Hall, a young Army Signal Corps officer, was involved in delivering shortwave radio transmitters to the Yalta Conference so that President Franklin D. Roosevelt could stay informed of news from Washington. Hall, a devout Christian, realized that Christian programming could also be sent to the entire world in the same way. After World War II, Hall became a minister, educator and missionary, but still dreamed of an international shortwave station that would reach the entire world with Gospel messages. In 1976, World Christian Broadcasting Corporation was formed and work began on making the station a reality. The following year, Lowell Perry, one of the founding directors, was killed in a plane crash during a mission to find a transmitter site. In 1979, land was purchased in Alaska and a transmitter was built.

History After its victory in World War I, it was agreed that Italy would not receive territories from the defeated German colonial empire. It was divided between France and the United Kingdom, but Italy would be rewarded some bordering areas from the British and French colonial empires. That was considered by Italians to be very little compensation for their sacrifices in the bloody war, which was one of the reasons of the rise to power in Italy of Mussolini's fascism. The British ceded Oltre Giuba (today Jubaland) from Kenya to Italian Somalia in 1925, but the French delayed some years until 1935, under Laval's leadership, and gave only a small amount of territory in eastern Africa and a desert area in the French Sahara. Laval had succeeded Louis Barthou as Foreign Minister after the latter's assassination in Marseilles on October 9, 1934, along with King Alexander I of Yugoslavia. Laval borrowed the idea of his predecessor of a system of collective security to contain the threat of Hitler in Europe. On January 4, 1935, Laval went to Rome, the capital of Italy, to meet Mussolini. It was the beginning of a diplomatic offensive intended to contain Hitler's Germany by a network of alliances. He proposed a treaty to Mussolini to define disputed parts of French Somaliland (now Djibouti) as part of Eritrea, redefine the official status of Italians in French Tunisia and give Italy a mainly-free hand to occupy Ethiopia during the Abyssinia Crisis. Italy was also to receive the Aouzou Strip, which was to be moved from French- ruled Chad to Italian-ruled Libya (that issue would have some implications in World War II and in the later Toyota War between Libya and Chad). In exchange for those concessions, France hoped for Italian support against German aggression, which did not occur. Map showing the new Italian Eritrea-French Somaliland border after the Laval-Mussolini Accord of January 1935. The coast of French Somalia was reduced south of the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait. The agreements were confirmed by a law of the French parliament on March 26, 1935.7 janvier 1935 - Accord franco-italien (Laval-Mussolini) (extrait in french) Both French and Italian parliaments ratified the 1935 agreement. Since the instruments of ratification were not exchanged, ICJ named the agreement as \\"Non-ratified\\".1994 ICJ Case Corcerning The Territorial Dispute (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Chad)Page: Top:19; Bottom:17 Main agreements The accord had the following main agreements: * A small territory in French Somaliland south of Eritrean Rahayta was to be given to Italian Eritrea. * The village of Aozou and the surrounding Aozou strip in French Africa Chad was to be given to Italian Libya. * Italy was given a free hand by the French government to occupy Ethiopia.

Taxonomy All tinamous are from the family Tinamidae and members of the infraclass Palaeognathae. Tinamous are the only members from their infraclass that aren't ratites, and can even fly, albeit poorly. All paleognaths evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) This species of tinamous was first described by Henry Boardman Conover in 1949 based on a specimen from Cusco in Peru. It has two subspecies: * T. o. hershkovitzi: Almost entirely restricted to the Colombian Andes, where found at altitudes between .Clements, J. (2007) It is known from the west slope of the East Andes in the Huila Department, and San Jos√© de la Fragua on the east slope of the East Andes in the Caquet√° Department. Reports from the northern Central Andes in the Antioquia Department in Colombia, and the north-eastern Andes in the Napo and Sucumb√≠os Provinces in Ecuador likely also involve this subspecies.Brinkhuizen & C√≥rdova (2008). * T. o. osgoodi: Found on the east slope of the Peruvian Andes in Cuzco, Puno, Madre de Dios, and Hu√°nuco.BirdLife International (2008) It is mainly found at altitudes of , but locally occurs up to .Schulenberg et al. (2007). Description The black tinamou is a stocky terrestrial bird with a short tail and rounded wings. It is comparatively larger than other tinamous and tends to be about long, with females being a little larger than males. A male black tinamou has an average wingspan of about , and a female black tinamou has an average wingspan of . While there is no record of the average mass of a black tinamou, a male specimen weighing has been examined at the Field Museum of Natural History. It is primarily slate grey, rather than truly black as its name would imply. The upperparts of an adult black tinamou are a uniform grey, while its midsection and greater wing coverts are sometimes edged with brown. Its lower breasts and flanks are a sooty brown color, as well as its belly. It has a rufescent vent, which may or may not have black speckling, depending on the subspecies. Its maxilla is black, and its mandible is a light grey. The black tinamou has blue-grey legs and dark brown eyes. An adolescent black tinamou is similar in color, but with whitish spots on the coverts of its wings. Black tinamou chicks generally have a light brown head with a broad, cinnamon-brown stripe extending from the crest of their heads to the napes of their necks. They have whitish throats and chins. Their neck, upper back and upper breast are a dusty brown. A black tinamou chick's lower back and rump is a dirty buff color, and its lower breast and belly range from dusky brown to pale brown. The black tinamou has a tremulous and descending whistle lasting about one second. The whistle is similar to that of a white- throated tinamou, even sharing the same first note.Gomes et al. (2014) Behavior Virtually nothing is known about the behavior of the black tinamou, but it is likely similar to that of its relatives. Nuts have been found in the crop of one specimen. =Reproduction= The only nest known was on the ground and contained 2 glossy blue eggs. In Peru, adults in breeding condition have been recorded between March and November, and a chick was found in February. Conservation The black tinamou is rated as Vulnerable by the IUCN with a range occurrence of . In 2004 it was estimated that fewer than 10,000 remained. There are few recent records from Colombia. It was formerly described as locally common in Peru, but is now rare in that country. The black tinamou has been recorded in several reserves, notably the Megantoni National Sanctuary, Man√∫ National Park and Sira Communal Reserve in Peru, Sumaco Napo-Galeras National Park in Ecuador, and the Cueva de los Gu√°charos National Park in Colombia.Vriesendorp et al. (2004) The black tinamou is threatened by deforestation or los of habitat caused by human settlement expansion, agricultural expansion, road-building, oil exploration in Peru, and it is hunted for food. Even within reserves, hunting and habitat loss are ongoing.

Season 1 =The Osbourneshttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306370/episodes 2011-0409-0033 (ed. 2011) or: There Goes the Neighborhood= The debut episode opens with a brief introduction of the family with a voice-over and scenes of each member. After the introductions, the episode deals with the family moving into their new Beverly Hills home. The family deal with problems that could arise from such a situation - finding valuable furniture broken due to lousy packing and trying to set up the TV with no instructions. Ozzy appears on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno as a performer. Kelly and Sharon come with Ozzy to the show, but Jack stays at home, watching a documentary about marijuana instead. The episode also shows Jack and Kelly's love-hate relationship, and their constant fighting. While the Osbournes are still settling in, Kelly nearly sets the kitchen on fire, and Jack wanders around the background clad in pseudo Army gear in a daze. The two constantly fight, chasing each other around the house. Jack and Kelly then go out clubbing, on Sunset Strip, using fake IDs. Ozzy warns them not to drink or take drugs and to wear condoms if they have sex. In spite of all the problems, Sharon is happy and content that they're finally 'home'. =Bark at the Moon= The episode starts with a brief scene of Ozzy and Sharon trying to turn on their new vacuum cleaner. Kelly lends a hand and switches on the vacuum, and Ozzy complains about the loudness of the vacuum. The family's numerous dogs has been excreting far too many times in the house, and ruining valuable furniture in the process. The worst dog is Lola, a bull dog which belongs to Jack. Lola has already demolished a valuable sofa. Sharon threatens Jack she'll give Lola away. Jack says Lola is demolishing the furniture because Kelly has bought a new cat into the house, and Lola is angry. Kelly gets busted for not stopping at a stop sign while driving, and is not far from having her license taken away. Elijah Wood and his sister Hannah visit the Osbournes. Lola does a massive 'crap' in Ozzy and Sharon's bedroom and urinates on the family sofas. Sharon threatens to give the dog away but later decides to hire a dog trainer. The dog trainer says that the dogs are spoiled rotten and untrained, and briefly trains Lola. As the dog trainer leaves, Lola urinates on a carpet. It is revealed Kelly has bought two cats, and Ozzy sees them. His yell of horror can be heard beyond Beverly Hills... =For the record...= Ozzy's releases his first solo album in six years. Ozzy and Sharon arrive at a in-store gig. Ozzy sign autographs and takes photos with fans, including an entire squad of security guards. Afterwards, Ozzy and Sharon go to KROQ-FM and have an interview on Loveline. Jack listens to the interview over the radio in a friend's car. Ozzy and Sharon discuss their sex life, and how Ozzy has been using Viagra excessively because he had been 'shooting blanks'. Jack winces in embarrassment as the Osbournes go on to say how Ozzy would get 'hard' at inconvenient times when Sharon is sleeping and not interested. On the day Jack goes to camp, Melinda tries to wake up Jack. But Jack is very depressed for some unknown reason and it becomes a struggle for Melinda to get him up. Jack manages to get to the school bus in time and is off to camp, but Sharon is very worried that Jack may need medication. Afterwards Sharon and Kelly take a private flight to New York to be with Ozzy. Ozzy appears on a TRL show with daughter Kelly, who is told backstage not to swear on stage. Kelly's 17th birthday is coming up and Sharon has arranged a themed party back at home. While going over the development of Kelly's party, Sharon gets a call from Jack's school that Jack is coming back from camp. Jack had been complaining that he didn't like the students, he threw rocks at students and tents and he cursed at the school captain. Morning after her 17th birthday party, Kelly reveals to Ozzy that she has a tattoo on her hip. Sharon is disappointed and says she's a very stupid person. Ozzy finishes the episode saying, with advice about tattoos, that he doesn't want an eagle on his daughter's buttock. =Won't you be my neighbor?= Kelly complains that elder sister Aimee had booked her a gynecologist appointment. Ozzy thinks it's a practical joke. The Osbournes have new neighbors, and they had been playing loud European dance music late at night. Sharon confronts them over the fence and tells them to go in their \\"perfectly big house\\" to play their music. The neighbors refuse to go inside, and Ozzy declares war. One night the neighbors play camp songs, and Jack finally has enough. He plays Meshuggah on full volume to upset the neighbors. It wakes Kelly who comes running out of the house and throwing tantrums. Next, Jack and Sharon start throwing ham across the fence. This catches the attention of the police, and they tell Sharon they are powerless to do anything about the loud noise UNLESS they are there when it happens. They also warn the family not to throw \\"the good food\\" over the fence, and to call them when the neighbors start playing up again. Ozzy, who had been sleeping through all this, awakes and grabs a piece of firewood and throws it over the fence. Even though Sharon insists that he throws the fruit. Something smashes. The cops come back! and they all run into the house =Tour of Duty= Ozzy is working out with a personal trainer in preparation for an upcoming tour. Sharon talks with a friend over the phone saying that the original name for Ozzy's tour was going to be 'Black Christmas', but was inappropriate because of the 9/11 attacks and its aftermath, so they renamed it 'Merry Mayhem'. Sharon adds that Ozzy will come on stage in a sleigh that will go around the stadium. On a day off, Sharon and Kelly go on a shopping spree at Saks Fifth Avenue, and loses Ozzy's credit card in the process. Panic-stricken, Kelly takes the blame for the missing card and frantically searches her car and finally finds it under the driver's seat - in the middle of the night. The next day, Ozzy goes to band rehearsal for the tour, warning that guitarist Zakk plays louder than Satan. Later, he does a Moulin Rouge skit for more promotional purposes. Ozzy prepares to leave for tour, and Sharon remarks that he finds it very stressful when embarking on a tour. During the rehearsal, Sharon shows to Ozzy all the special effects for the shows. Ozzy is angry by all the special side effects, thinking it will distract the fans from his music. He refuses to perform two nights in a row with the silly special effects. He says Sharon only cares about the money rolling in. Somehow Sharon persuades him to do the two shows anyway, and they become a success. =Trouble in Paradise= Ozzy has well gone into his tour, traveling across the USA. Sharon had returned home and says she'll reunite with Ozzy in Houston because she misses him so much. Kelly complains about her twisted ankle after falling into a hole exactly the same size as her foot. When Sharon and Ozzy reunite in Houston, Ozzy says he had injured his leg during a concert. Back at the house, Jack and nanny Melinda are at each other's throats. Melinda blames Jack's moodiness on him being tired and sticking to a busy schedule, which is hardly true. Jack parties out late, orders pizza in early morning, sleeps in, and plays games. Melinda calls Ozzy and Sharon and says that Jack has left the house and hasn't returned for hours. She's worried that Jack might be dead out there. Ozzy contacts Jack on his mobile. He tells Jack it's no such big deal to apologize to Melinda for being bratty. Jack refuses to apologize anyway, not wanting to appear sensitive and mushy. Ozzy eventually returns home and despite a broken leg, he has to fetch the cat which walks around the dangerous unfinished pool. He wanders about trying to get the cat until Sharon finally assists him and gets the cat. Both Sharon and Ozzy become fed up with Jack and Kelly constantly partying and bringing friends over at noon. They order a family meeting and give a stern talking to Kelly and Jack, despite concerns that Kelly would cause problems, it is Jack that becomes outraged and leaves the meeting failing to improve while Kelly decides to change. =Get Stuffed= Ozzy mixes alcohol with the pain medication for his foot injury and winds up stoned. He tries to take Lola for a walk, but Sharon sends Jack to retrieve him. The Osbournes suffer through a miserable Thanksgiving. Ozzy works on the video for his song \\"Dreamer,\\" and adamantly refuses to wear a bat coat. Kelly grows frustrated when the media continually mentions Jack's work with Epic Records, as she feels they are implying that she isn't doing anything with her life. She angrily insists that she actually discovered the band that Jack is helping, and that he hasn't given her any credit. She turns to Ozzy for sympathy, but he isn't quite sure what he wants her to say. Ozzy grows fed up with the family and insists on returning to the tour alone. Sharon, Jack and Kelly decide to surprise him in Chicago for his birthday. They hide from him until his birthday because they fear he would become angry if he saw them before his birthday dinner. When the event finally arrives, Ozzy is surprised and pleased to see his family. =No Vagrancy= Jack invites his friend Jason Dill, a professional skateboarder, to stay at the house after he is kicked out of the home of yet another of his friends. Ozzy and Sharon are more than a little put off by the fact that Jack just lets Dill come over without telling them, let alone asking for permission. Dill is obnoxious and slovenly, and creeps out Ozzy and others with his habit of always scratching his head. Dill also smokes and drinks a lot, and Sharon is annoyed to find a bottle of Jack Daniels with his belongings. She decides that she is going to urinate in the bottle, but Kelly pleads with her not to do this. Dill accidentally starts a fire in the kitchen, doing damage to a pan and the stove top. Jack is irritated by the fact that Dill is the only one who doesn't seem to be helping clean up the mess, although Dill points out that he would only make things worse. Ozzy and Sharon finally persuade Jack to ask Dill to leave the house. Jack is upset when Sharon and Ozzy give away Lola because she keeps leaving horrific messes around the house. Jack tries to make arrangements to spend time with the dog on weekends, but Ozzy finally agrees to let Lola come back to the house, provided that Jack looks after her. =A Very Ozzy Christmas= The Osbournes are packing their stuff at the Peninsula Hotel in New York, and Sharon tells Ozzy and Jack that one of their tour truck drivers had an accident the other day. He was getting a blow job from a hooker he had picked up, and was driving in the nude. Later they are on a tour bus driving around New York, and Sharon is informed that Michael, their security guard, had been arrested for robbing a house behind theirs. Ozzy immediately suspects that Michael may have stolen his jewelry. Ozzy embarks on his last promotional concert for his new album in New York. Back at the hotel, Ozzy is flabbergasted when he sees all the designer branded shopping bags Sharon has. Ozzy, Sharon and Jack return home, managing to get all the bags onto the plane. When Christmas finally arrives, presents are exchanged, and the Osbournes are paid a visit by Ozzy's son from his first marriage, techno DJ Louis Osbourne. For dinner, Ozzy repeats: \\"We did really great with that gravy!\\" and Sharon sighs: \\"We're gonna hear about this fucking gravy for the next year\\". Ozzy opens a champagne bottle, and almost breaks something when the cork flies across the room. Sharon starts talking about Christina Aguilera's album 'My Kind Of Christmas'. Jack flips Kelly the finger for no reason. Kelly pouts, gets up and leaves the dining room. After the dinner, Jack's and Kelly's girl friends, come over for a visit and talk with the Osbournes in the sitting room. Jack gets a pocket knife from one of his friends for Christmas. He plans to go out with it, but Sharon and Ozzy warns if he goes out with an army-style haircut, a tee with 'Cocaine' on it and holding a pocket knife, he would get arrested by the police. The day after Christmas, Sharon and Kelly meet up with Michael, their security guard. Michael explains how he had never been in the house behind theirs and never took anything. =Dinner with Ozzy= The episode starts with Ozzy sitting in his dining room and enjoying dinner and recounts a time when a stray cat entered their house. Note we actually hear and see Aimee (Whose face is blurred due to her not wanting to participate in the show) in this segment. Ozzy then introduces and discusses Sharon, and there scenes of her giving him a breath strip. The next scene shows Sharon kissing and snuggling Ozzy while Jack tries to watch TV. Then, Ozzy talks to Kelly and Melinda about being put in jail for stealing. Ozzy then starts to talk about Jack. Jack is then shown walking around with a rifle and wearing army gear. Kelly then complains that \\"15 year old boys shouldn't be playing with rifles and knives\\" She then brings up an old situation that Jack had shot Kelly with a pellet gun six year earlier and she still has a grudge. Ozzy then briefly talks on how much Kelly and Jack fight but that they should outgrow it. The next scene though comes up and it's revealed that Jack hasn't gotten up to go to school. Ozzy walks into Jack's room, wakes him up, and tells him that he needs to go to school. Ozzy then talks about Sharon not liking cooking. This brings up a scene with Kelly complaining to her mom that she doesn't cook. Ozzy then says that the first thing that attracted him to Sharon was her laugh. Then a scene is shown with Sharon and Kelly talking about their chests. Ozzy then comes back and says that Kelly doesn't take after her mom and she definitely doesn't take after Ozzy. Ozzy comes back again and says that people think he lives in a Bavarian castle like a bat, but he does chores like everyone else. He is then shown grinding coffee, collecting firewood, and making microwave popcorn. Then Ozzy says that sometimes he feels invisible. Ozzy then finishes his dinner with a cup of tea and a montage of scenes from the season is shown. Ozzy then says, \\"That's the way we are. We're The Osbournes. I love it.\\" Season 2 =Catching Up with the Osbournes= Season 2 starts off with that.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306370/episodes 2011-0409-0033 (ed. 2011) =What Goes Up...= Sharon and the dogs are in the backyard. Lola the bulldog then vomits on the grass. Ozzy then tries to show off his knife throwing skills by trying to throw knives into logs. As Jack is in the car going somewhere he makes a call saying there are fans on the lawn and the sprinklers should be turned on to scare them away. Sharon then shows Melinda a gold filling that she had accidentally swallowed. Ozzy then announces that he and Sharon have been invited to Washington DC for a press dinner at the White House. Ozzy doesn't know how to handle it and he doesn't know proper etiquette, he's a street guy. Sharon helps Ozzy pick out a watch to wear. Jack then announces that Kelly has covered Madonna's \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" and that she would be singing it at the MTV Movie Awards. This leads to a scene of Ozzy dancing with Kelly while the song plays in the background. Jack then tells us that he had a part in Kelly getting signed to a record contract and Kelly discusses that she doesn't want a chick band. Ozzy and Sharon leave to go to Washington and Sharon tells Ozzy that she got President Bush some cuff-links as a gift. Ozzy asks how is she going to give The President a gift. Ozzy says that he's the President...he's not allowed to accept gifts. They arrive in Washington and drive past the Washington Monument and Lincoln Monument. Sharon admits that she doesn't know who President Bush is and that Ozzy is starting to get stage fright. Back home, Jack continues his playful attitude with fans and the sprinklers. Kelly then goes to rehearsal and she steals Jack's spritz bottle. Jack tells Kelly, \\"Just because you have a hit song doesn't mean you can steal my spritz bottle.\\" Back in Washington, Ozzy and Sharon are getting ready for their dinner and Sharon says that Ozzy looks like Harrison Ford. Ozzy says he looks more like Glenn Close. He then calls Sharon a cunt, but then quickly apologizes. He then looks into the camera and says, \\"I found out you can say anything to a woman. But you mention the \\"C\\" word and you suddenly get this feeling of death come over you.\\" At the dinner President Bush says, \\"What a fantastic audience we have tonight. Washington power brokers, celebrities, Hollywood stars, Ozzy Osbourne.\\" Then causes Ozzy to stand up with a big smile on his face and the crowd applauds him. Ozzy then flies to England and Sharon joins Kelly and Jack. At the movie awards, all the attention goes to Kelly, while Jack is on a quest to find Natalie Portman. Ozzy introduces Kelly and she does a great performance. That night on the ride home they pass a McDonald's and Jack is happy to see that the McRib is back. This irks Kelly and he tells Kelly that it's the little things in life that make people happy. The episode then ends with Jack continuing his antics with people outside his house with sprinklers and Kelly flies to New York to promote her album. =Must Come Down= Sharon recuperates at the family's Malibu beach house while undergoing treatment for colon cancer. She vows to beat the disease, and tries to maintain as normal a life as possible. Everyone talks about their reactions to the news of her diagnosis. Ozzy struggles to remain sober while on tour with Ozzfest. He had already been going through detox, and the news of Sharon's illness has made a difficult situation much worse. A family friend/employee tries to help Ozzy by helping him get into yoga and reading him poetry, but Ozzy is decidedly less than impressed. Some people try to talk to him about how religion helped them overcome their addictions, but he does not want any part of it. He is terrified by the prospect of losing Sharon, and doesn't want to be away from her. However, he elects to tough it out and stay on tour because he doesn't want to cause Sharon any further stress. Ozzy comes home for a few days during a break in the tour. Sharon tries to have a fire going in the fireplace for his arrival, but it ends up getting a little bit out of control. Jack takes up surfing while on vacation. He and his friends jump off a pier, but Jack winds up breaking his elbow. =The Ozz Man and the Sea= Kelly travels to Europe for a series of interviews and appearances. She is upset when her bag is lost (apparently seized by security because of concerns over her gun-shaped pin), leaving her without any extra underwear. She first visits Germany, where she deals with several adoring fans and tries to fake her way through a radio interview conducted in German (\\"That's amazing. I always don't know what to say\\"). Kelly then goes to England to perform \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" on Top of the Pops. Jack heads to North Carolina to film a guest spot for Dawson's Creek. Sharon is depressed about the fact that everyone is away at the same time. Ozzy tries to cheer her up by building a fire outside the beach house so that she can spend some time outside. The fire department gives him some advice on building a pit for the fire, but the ocean is not very cooperative (\\"Fuck! Go to Alaska! No, no, no, no. You fucking asshole ocean! No!\\"). When the fire finally gets going, Ozzy gives Sharon a good laugh when he tries to catch a fish in the ocean‚Äîand ends up falling on his butt. =Beauty and the Bert= Kelly begins dating Bert McCracken, lead singer of the band The Used. Sharon worries after hearing some stories about Bert (\\"They call him cauliflower dick. Cauliflower dick!? Dont you get that from virg-, virginia, virginial, Venereal disease mum. Venereal disease! Why do I keep thinking fucking virginial?\\"), while Jack thinks that Bert is weird because he professed his love to Kelly after only a few weeks of dating. Kelly warns that she will run off to Vegas and marry before the end of the year. Sharon actually encourages this, saying that she needs some excitement. Sharon worries about the situation, but Ozzy encourages her to relax and just focus on living one day at a time. Sharon wants Bert to stay at the house (and sleep in Jack's room) when his band comes to town. Kelly refuses to bring him over to meet the family because she fears they will threaten or embarrass him. She finally tries to sneak him into the house, but Sharon catches them. She asks Bert about his nickname, leaving Kelly mortified. Meanwhile, Ozzy has more problems with the television set, which winds up stuck on a cooking channel (or the Bread Baking Channel, as he calls it). He develops a strange fascination for the series Two Fat Ladies. =Smells Like Teen Spirits= Sharon makes amends with her father after not speaking with him for over twenty years. Kelly keeps going out and getting drunk every night, despite Sharon's pleas. Ozzy tries to warn her of the consequences of her actions, as they can't protect her if she gets arrested for underage drinking. Pop star Mandy Moore comes over to the house to hang out with Jack. Jack also spends a lot of time partying, and ignores his trainer's repeated efforts to get him to change his lifestyle. Kelly and Robert annoy Ozzy when they disturb his sleep with their loud, drunken behavior. Sharon's father tries to give her advice on how to rein in the kids. Kelly becomes very ill after drinking too much, and claims that she is going to stay in all weekend. Sharon intentionally tortures her throughout her hangover by talking about disgusting food items. Ozzy becomes a grandfather when his oldest daughter, Jessica, has a baby girl. Ozzy later becomes addicted to burritos (\\"Your father can't eat just 1 burrito, he has to have 900 burritos\\"). =Meow Means No!= Kelly recruits her friend Sarah to play the drums in her band. However, Sarah has never had any formal lessons, and can't seem to keep up with the others during rehearsals. Everyone becomes very frustrated, and reaches the conclusion that Sarah must be replaced by someone with more experience. Kelly can't bring herself to fire her friend, so Sharon volunteers to handle it. Sarah gets $10,000 for her services, and a job handling the slate during the filming of Kelly's video for \\"Shut Up.\\" Dill returns to town, and Jack invites him to stay at the house. Ozzy is not thrilled about this, but doesn't stand in his way. Dill and Jack engage in a political debate that seems to bore the rest of their friends. They later engage in a bizarre wrestling match in the driveway that finds them stripping half-naked. One of the dogs, Arthur, becomes too frisky as he deals with leftover \\"feelings\\" after being fixed. The family believes that Arthur has raped Gus the cat, although a veterinarian insists that this is impossible. =It's a Hard Knock Life= Kelly grows frustrated with all of the appearances she must make as a recording artist. She yells and screams at everyone. Sharon sympathizes with her, noting that she just wants to be a teenager and is having a hard time handling all of the demands being placed on her. She asks Ozzy to go talk to Kelly and reassure her. Kelly quickly sends him scampering away as she throws a screaming fit. Kelly flies to New York to work on her album. She does a photo shoot for Vanity Fair, and ends up storming off and having another tantrum. She later meets P.Diddy at a party. He asks her to be his guest and gives her an expensive watch as an apology after one of his security guards knocks her down. Sharon becomes fascinated with the idea of becoming P.Diddy's mother-in-law, and embarrasses Kelly by refusing to stop talking about it. Ozzy and Kelly listen to some of her songs together. He tells her that she has done well and expresses his pride. Meanwhile, Jack has problems with a band that he is trying to sign, as the guitar player is very reluctant to hand over the demos. =Cleanliness Is Next to Ozzyness= Ozzy grows increasingly tired of the dogs and their tendency to defecate in the house. Because Sharon's immune system is very weak due to the chemo, he fears that all of the germs will cause her to develop an infection. He constantly cleans everything and tries to get everyone to wear gloves around Sharon. He also urges Sharon not to let the dogs on the bed, but she ignores him. Ozzy meets with a contractor about plans to build an outdoor kennel for all of the dogs, but Sharon quickly kills this idea. Jack and Sharon argue when she insists on going out to dinner. He believes she should rest, but she is feeling well and can't stand to be cooped up in the house. Sharon takes Robert shopping for furniture for his new room. She explains that Robert was a good friend to Aimee and Kelly after the Osbournes moved from England, so they have taken him in after his mother's death (from colon cancer). Jack bonds with Robert and shows him how to make one of his favorite treats, beans on toast. Sharon goes to the doctor. At a special dinner that night, she announces that her cancer is in remission and that she will finish her treatment in January. =Viva Ozz Vegas= The Osbournes pack their bags for Sin City as Ozzy prepares for a concert and Kelly celebrates her 18th birthday. Before heading to Vegas, Kelly discovers that she has been made to sign a contract with The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino as the hotel clearly states that if anyone is seen to be drinking underage, then they would all be thrown out of the hotel. The family charter a private jet to Vegas. When Kelly and friend Sara head out for a wild night on the town, Jack gets left behind because he's still not of legal age. Jack is deeply annoyed by this as he had been told by a friend that they would all be meeting \\"some Penthouse chicks\\" while in Vegas. As Jack watches television with some friends, Kelly and Sara run wild. Shocking onlookers with a revealing table dance before falling to the floor in front of a disapproving Ozzy and Sharon, Sara horrifies onlookers shortly before Kelly and Jack go toe-to-toe. =My Big Fat Jewish Wedding= Sharon and Ozzy decide to renew their wedding vows at a hotel on New Year's Eve. Kelly is to serve as flower girl, with Jack and Robert as ushers. Kelly objects to the fact that the ceremony will be conducted by a rabbi; although Sharon's father is Jewish, Kelly insists that a person cannot be Jewish unless their mother is (Sharon: \\"Excuse me, my husband is circumcised\\"). Ozzy is not at all enthused about the ceremony. Kelly and Sarah are less than impressed with Jack's latest female \\"friend,\\" particularly because she once dated Jack's best friend. Sharon catches the girl in bed with Jack, and later finds condoms in the room. She tries to encourage Jack to settle down and find a steady girlfriend, but he would rather juggle several girls because the idea of a relationship freaks him out. Ozzy and Jack have various body parts plucked, shaved and waxed before the wedding. Sharon recalls the couple's first wedding night, when Ozzy passed out drunk in the hallway. Ozzy insists that he will not drink this time. Sharon recites her own vows, leaving Ozzy clearly touched. The hotel hosts a celebrity-filled reception. Sharon is especially excited about the presence of Justin Timberlake. She asks him to marry Kelly. Ozzy gets completely plastered, causing mayhem such as making out with Marilyn Manson. History repeats itself, as Ozzy falls asleep on a couch and Sharon laments that she has again been cheated out of her wedding night. =What a Boy Wants= The Osbournes struggle to come up with a gift for Jack's birthday. Kelly strongly objects when Jack dances with Christina Aguilera, whom Kelly had previously insulted on a number of occasions. Kelly complains that Jack is disrespecting her by hanging around someone that she dislikes, and insists that she would never do this to Jack. Jack tries to explain that Christina actually had nice things to say about Kelly. The kids get into a brawl, which Sharon must break up. Meanwhile, Ozzy visits the dentist and gets intoxicated from the nitrous oxide, and he appears to take the rinse water and pours it over his ear. The family visits a medieval-themed club to celebrate Jack's birthday, and buys him a knight suit. Jack tries out his new sword by dueling with a buddy in the street. =Flea's a Crowd= The pets suffer from a flea infestation, creating havoc around the house and leaving everyone itchy and miserable. Kelly prepares to go on a trip to Philadelphia to visit her boyfriend, Bert. Sharon does not want her to go away alone (she prefers her to have security at all times), and drives Kelly crazy as she somewhat jokingly nags her. Sharon has Robert and Jack move a heavy statue out to the garden, but never seems satisfied by the location. She forces them to move it several times. The house is redecorated, and Ozzy finds himself extremely bewildered by a giant statue of a hand. Kelly goes against her parents' wishes and gets a nose ring, which Sharon wants her to remove. Kelly later mistakes the nose ring for something on her nose and accidentally flicks it out. =Run Ozzy Run= Ozzy continues to work out with his trainer, Pete, who Ozzy jokes may be a robot because he never stops talking, sweats, eats or goes to the bathroom. Ozzy is to run five miles on his 54th birthday. He runs almost two miles before he is stopped by a foot injury. The family throws a party for Ozzy's birthday, complete with a fireworks display by Jack and Robert. Ozzy eventually tries to run the five miles again, and succeeds this time. Meanwhile, Ozzy has problems with his new car, as the voice recognition system can't understand a word he says. =Fists of Fury= Ozzy and Sharon prepare to leave for a few days on a Hawaiian vacation. Ozzy tells Jack that he is no longer to have people over at the house after 11 PM. Kelly is afraid that Jack will turn the house into a nonstop party while their parents are gone. Sharon promises to talk to him, but this does little to reassure Kelly. Jack has a lot of people over late at night, and they soon begin using the pool and making a lot of noise. Kelly becomes very upset because she is tired of Jack and his friends keeping her from sleeping. He refuses to listen to Melinda when she asks them to be quiet. When Kelly confronts Jack, he dares her to hit him, so she nails him in the face. They get into a fight, and the staff has to pry them apart. Kelly calls Sharon for sympathy, but Jack gets on the line and complains about the cuts to the face he sustained from the punch. Kelly feels Jack deserved what he got; Melinda agrees somewhat, but warns Kelly to be careful about her temper. Sharon and Ozzy come home, and Sharon teases Kelly about the incident. Kelly and Jack quickly patch things up, as they hang out in the kitchen and share some Easy Mac. =Mama, I'm Staying Home= Ozzy decides to stay home while Sharon, Melinda and the kids travel to New York. Sharon hopes that Ozzy and Robert will spend more time together, but the two mostly avoid one another because they have little in common. Robert spends a lot of time listening to music and dancing in his guest house, and Ozzy cannot get one of the songs out of his head. Ozzy buys a lot of kitchenware, and spends over $600 on candy for Sharon. Meanwhile, Melinda learns that she is pregnant, and annoys Kelly by talking about her pregnancy nonstop. Kelly also gets into a playful wrestling match with Sharon. =Tennis Racket= Sharon receives a peace offering from one of her folk-singing neighbors, but the neighbors on the other side begin to drive the family crazy by playing tennis at all hours of the day and night. Jack tries playing drums outside, and Ozzy blasts the loudest, most obnoxious music he can find. However, nothing seems to have an effect on the neighbors. Jack shoots at the court with his paintball gun, leading to a visit from the police. Sharon suspects that the neighbors are responsible when three of the Osbournes' cats disappear, although the coyotes seem the more likely culprit. Kelly brings home another cat, but Ozzy isn't very happy about it. =A Little Ditty 'bout Jack and Brianne= Jack visits the home of singer/actress Courtney Love. He begins dating Kurt Cobain's sister Brieann, who is staying with Courtney. They get along very well, and Jack teaches her some of his favorite recipes, including beans on toast. Sharon is touched to learn that Jack has a tattoo of the word \\"Mum\\" with a heart around it. (He got it right after she was diagnosed with cancer.) Ozzy tries out some song lyrics on Sharon, who is busy shopping at the time. He later plays a demo of the new song for Jack and Brieann. Ozzy is bewildered by a rotisserie turkey as it cooks in the kitchen. =Angler Management= After 17 years of waiting, Ozzy fulfills his dream of taking Jack on a fishing trip. They get in trouble with the captain for throwing firecrackers at the pelicans. Everyone on board places bets on who can catch the largest fish, and a friend of Jack's wins the contest. Ozzy winds up catching some tin cans and a bird. He also momentarily mistakes a seal for a shark. Nevertheless, they both have a great time on the trip. =Bye Bye Babies= Jack and Robert fly to England to spend time at the Osbournes' other home. Jack shows Robert the house and introduces him to the family's oldest dog, Sugar. Some of Jack's friends also come over to hang out with them and drink. Lola grows lonely and bored because she misses Jack so much. Sharon also laments the departures of both Jack and Kelly, who is away on tour. Meanwhile, Ozzy uncovers an old keyboard from his Black Sabbath days and tries to get it working again. He also becomes fascinated with carrot cake, but Pete tries to stop him from overdoing it. Jack and Kelly return home and are reunited with their loved ones. =Ozz Well That Ends Well= Kelly experiences problems in her relationship with Bert. He finally breaks up with her over the phone on Valentine's Day, claiming that no one took him seriously because he was dating her. Kelly becomes extremely irritable and depressed, and takes her anger out on the family. She argues with Sharon, who suggests that she find another manager; and bites Jack on the arm. She overhears her family talking about her and decides to leave home. Meanwhile, Jack is alarmed when he acts out violently in his sleep. He wakes up one night to find himself beating up Lola. On another night, he attacks Minnie; and is horrified to wake up and discover that he has killed her. He flees the house with the body. A devastated Sharon retreats to the family's Malibu home to escape memories of Minnie. Ozzy is left all alone, with no one to help him fix the television. Suddenly, the director yells, \\"Cut!\\" Ozzy rejoins his family (including Minnie) in another room, and it is revealed that this episode has been scripted. Everyone pretends that the entire series has been fake: Ozzy expresses relief at no longer having to say the f-word, and tells someone to pick up the \\"fake\\" dog doo. =The Osbourne Family Christmas Special= The Osbournes prepare for Christmas in a series of skits. The dogs are dressed in festive attire; Sharon horrifies Kelly by trying to make her dress \\"Christmas-y\\" for the family's upcoming party; Mandy Moore tries in vain to get Jack and Kelly into the holiday spirit; and Ozzy very reluctantly performs a holiday duet with fellow MTV reality star Jessica Simpson. The family hosts a blow-out celebrity bash for the holidays, complete with cooking segments, a visit from Santa, Christmas carols, and a unique version of \\"'Twas the Night Before Christmas.\\" Season 3 =The Show Must Go Oz= Sharon faces pressure from the powers that be behind her talk show, who are disappointed in her performance and expect her to work harder. She refuses to incorporate their suggestions into the show. Kelly and Jack grow tired of appearing on Sharon's show; both refuse her request for a co-hosting appearance. Ozzy very reluctantly agrees to appear in the Halloween episode. He believes that he is going to just be a guest, and is furious when he learns (at the last minute) that he is to serve as co-host. Meanwhile, the Osbournes' property undergoes some re-decorating. The workmen struggle to move a gigantic Buddha statue across the yard. =Car Jacked= Jack turns 18 and receives a car as a birthday present. Kelly doesn't believe that he will pass his driver's test because he is such a poor driver, but Sharon disagrees. Jack practices parallel parking with his assistant, and winds up crashing into another car. Jack passes his test, receiving a perfect score on the driving portion of the exam. Meanwhile, Kelly frets about yet another confrontation with Christina Aguilera, this time during the MTV Europe Awards. =Rebel Without an Ozz= Ozzy and Sharon fret about all of the time they must spend apart as she works on her talk show. One of Sharon's scheduled guests, rapper/actor DMX, runs late and is in danger of not making it to the show on time. He has a history of being late or skipping out on events, and Sharon finds the whole situation very amusing. Ozzy gives everyone who stops by the house a tour of his new home studio. He enjoys watching porn on the state-of-the-art TV. Ozzy also buys a new motorcycle, but isn't quite sure how to start it. Meanwhile, Jack and his friends find new and disgusting ways to entertain themselves. =Return of the Ring= Ozzy loses a diamond pinkie ring that is worth over $100,000. He becomes obsessed with trying to find it, and pleads with Sharon not to buy any more jewelry. She doesn't pay attention to his decree, and also buys his and her Bentleys. Ozzy eventually finds the ring, but is upset to learn that Sharon plans to buy Kelly a ring for her birthday. Meanwhile, one of the dogs, Colin, has to be fixed because he continuously humps everything in sight. =The Accidental Tourist= Kelly and Ozzy plan to travel to England, where they are to perform a duet of \\"Changes,\\" the title track from Kelly's second album, on Top of the Pops. Ozzy upsets Kelly by saying that he doesn't want to come with her, but Sharon assures her that he will change his mind. Kelly's boyfriend, Rob, joins her on the trip. Everyone seems pleased with their duet, and Ozzy predicts that it could hit number one on the U.K. charts. Before a talk show appearance, Kelly gets into a fight with Rob. They apparently break up, and he returns to the U.S. Ozzy annoys Kelly when he immediately complains of boredom and says that he wants to go back to Los Angeles. They later get along well while riding ATVs on the family's estate. Ozzy suffers an accident while riding one of the ATVs. His bodyguard finds him lying on the ground, unconscious. =The English Patient= After three weeks in the hospital, Ozzy is released and continues to convalesce at his home in England. He and Sharon miss each other desperately. Ozzy develops a craving for √©clairs, and cannot get enough of them. Meanwhile, Jack finally gets a hair cut after two years. Sharon experiences more problems with her talk show. Publicists begin pulling their clients from the show because they do not approve of Sharon's behavior, and Sharon grows tired of the constant tinkering with the show (adding cooking segments and makeovers). She decides to quit the show, and no one really fights her on it. She and Ozzy agree that they will no longer work unless it is a project they can take together. Ozzy is able to fly back home to Los Angeles, and is greeted warmly by the family. =Scent of a Woman= Kelly annoys everyone, particularly Sharon, with her disgusting lack of personal hygiene as she refuses to shower for a long period of time. She is upset when Sharon accuses her of smoking. Ozzy receives a letter supposedly from the Prime Minister of Canada asking him to come to Canada to receive an award. Ozzy, however, suspects that the whole thing is a hoax. =Pain in the Neck= Ozzy grows increasingly frustrated about being cooped up around the house. He misses Sharon, who is busy working on her show, and is upset about the weight he has been gaining because he cannot work out. He also hates the bulky neck brace that he is forced to wear. Jack gets another tattoo and reveals it to Ozzy. Ozzy is so bored that he goes out grocery shopping with his assistant, Tony, even though he hates to shop. He later joins Jack at the shooting range. Ozzy is soon able to begin using the treadmill again, and receives the good news that he can take off the neck brace. =Ozzy Knows Best= Ozzy is upset by Kelly's tendency to wear revealing outfits when she goes out to clubs and parties. She feels that he is being overprotective. Ozzy worries about the behavior of one of the bulldogs, Colin, as he is attacking the other dogs (especially Lola).

He and Jack eventually patch things up, and Sharon tries to get through to Kelly. =Valentine Daze= Kelly continues to spend time with Rob, but doesn't want to be his girlfriend because he wants a committed relationship and she feels that she is too young to settle down.

Kelly eventually admits the truth to Sharon and enters rehab. Ozzy and Sharon don't believe she will stay at the facility for long. =28 Days Later= Kelly struggles to adjust to life in rehab, and frequently calls home requesting various personal belongings. She wants to leave, but Jack urges her to tough it out. Jack celebrates both his birthday and a year of sobriety. Kelly arrives home and becomes frustrated by the curfew and other rules she must follow. She clashes with her mother often, and accuses Sharon of messing with her head when she expresses her concerns. =Charity Case= Sharon and Kelly plan a trip to Kenya on behalf of a charity organization. Ozzy doesn't want them to go, as he fears they will be kidnapped or contract malaria. Sharon also has second thoughts after hearing more details about the trip.

After the death of her spouse, she was for a short while a candidate for the throne. Life Joanna was born at Naples, a daughter of Ferdinand I and his second wife, Joanna of Aragon, which made her a half-sister of Alfonso II of Naples and Frederick IV of Naples. Her father died in January 1494, and was succeeded by her half brother. = Queen of Naples= In January 1495, her half brother abdicated in favor of his son, her nephew. Joanna left Naples for Sicily with her mother and their entourage before the French occupation that year, and did not return until October, with a Venetian ship from Messina. Her mother and the king closely cooperated in casting out the French, and the successful discontinuation of the French occupation ended with her mother arranging the marriage between her and the king. In 26 July 1496, the 17-year-old Joanna married her 27-year-old nephew, Ferdinand II, the son of her half-brother, Alfonso II. A papal dispensation had been necessary in order to conduct a wedding between an aunt and nephew. However, Ferdinand II died on 7 September of the same year. The marriage was childless. =Succession struggle= Upon the death of her spouse, he was succeeded by his uncle, Joanna's half-brother Frederick, after a struggle of succession. Her mother contested the succession and wished for Joanna to succeed her late husband to the throne. With the support of her mother, Joanna started to sign seals. Naples had had female monarchs and Joanna's succession was viewed favorable by the public, however, her mother's claim on her behalf was forcefully contested by the barons and nobility, who feared the influence of her mother and Aragon and made it impossible for Joanna and her mother to secure her succession before that of Frederick. Her mother's disappointment over the succession failure earned her the sobriquet \\"The Sad Queen\\" because of her sorrow on behalf of her daughter. The relationship between Frederick and Joanna and her mother was strained. Frederick granted the cities and lands of Sorrento, Massa and Vico to Joanna in an attempt to pacify her and her mother's discontent. She retired from Naples with her mother to Poggioreale and San Sebastian by Vesuvius and did not return to court until November. King Frederick reportedly feared that Joanna would marry someone who would support her claims to the throne against him. Joanna settled with her mother in her position as queen dowager, and the two queen dowagers where referred to as Joanna the Elder and Joanna the Younger. In 1499, her mother suggested a marriage between her and Ferdinand, Duke of Calabria, but it did not materialize. In 1499, she accompanied her mother to a visit to her maternal uncle Ferdinand II of Aragon. In 1501, Joanna met her half sister Beatrice of Naples, queen dowager of Hungary, for the first time, when she returned to Naples from Hungary. =Later life= During the French invasion of Naples in 1501, Joanna and her mother fled to Palermo in Sicily, where they lived during the French occupation of Naples under the protection of Joanna's maternal uncle, Ferdinand II of Aragon. In 1504, the Kingdom of Naples was turned over to Aragon. Joanna was a renowned beauty, and her new position under the protection of the king of Aragon also made her attractive on the dynastic marriage market, and she received several proposals. King Henry VII of England lost his wife, Elizabeth of York, on 11 February 1503. At age 46, he was interested in taking a second wife and (the still young) Joanna was suggested as a potential bride by her aunt, Isabella I of Castile, who probably wanted to divert Henry's interest from her daughter, Catherine of Aragon. Lacking a portrait of Joanna, Henry sent ambassadors to Naples in 1505 to report on the physical qualities of the prospective bride. Henry's questions, and the ambassador's answers, were mentioned by Francis Bacon in his 1622 biography, The Historie of the Raigne of King Henry The Seventh. A document containing the questions and answers was published in London, 250 years after the fact, as \\"Instructions given by King Henry the Seventh, to his embassadors, When he intended to marry the young Queen of Naples: together with the answers of the embassadors\\".published in London: 1761, by T. Becket and P.A. De Hondt The 1761 book lists \\"Articles\\" in sequential Roman numerals, each \\"Article\\" followed by an \\"Answer\\" - sought by Henry dealt with all aspects of Joanna's appearance: the color of her hair, the condition of her teeth, the size and shape of her nose, the complexion of her skin, whether she had hair on her upper lip. Article XVI instructed the ambassadors to note \\"hir brestes... whether they be bigge or smale.\\" The ambassadors told the king that Joanna's breasts \\"be somewhat great & fully, and in as much as that they were trussed somewhat high after the manner of (the) country, which causes her Grace for to seem much the fuller and her neck to be the shorter.\\" The ambassador's report on Joanna's appearance was satisfactory, but the marriage negotiations failed for political and financial reasons.Schwarz, Arthur L., VIVAT REX! An Exhibition Commemorating the 500th Anniversary of the Accession of Henry VIII, The Grolier Club, 2009, p. 58: \\"Henry's Father Searches for a New Wife\\". In 1506, she and her mother returned to Naples in the company of Ferdinand of Aragon and his second queen Germaine de Foix. Joanna settled with her mother, her half sister Beatrice and Isabella of Aragon, Duchess of Milan with their own household in the Castel Capuano in Naples. They were provided with a generous allowance from her maternal uncle Ferdinand of Aragon. In 1508, she and her mother nursed queen dowager Beatrice, and benefited from her will later that year. Joanna never remarried. In 1510, her uncle Ferdinand of Aragon planned to arranged a marriage for her to Charles III of Savoy, and collected taxes in Naples to fund the wedding, but the plans never materialized. Joanna died a couple of months after her mother. She was taken ill suddenly after a trip to Puglia. Joanna lived most of her life in the shadow of her mother, who was described as a dominant personality and the driving force in her life, acting as her companion her entire life, and the information of Joanna herself is somewhat scarce.

It is 18 km away from the city of Negombo. The village of Wennappuwa is mentioned in the Culavamsapp 97 as a small farming hamlet.  History  A church made of wattle and daub, consecrated to St. Joseph, was put up in Gangoda in 1850. Very Rev. Fr. Contentious Chounavel (OMI) a French Missionary and the founder of the church arrived at Wennappuwa between 1861 and 1863 A.D. 300 families lived there at the time. His intention was to gather those families whose faith was strong and visible, under one roof. The roads were coming up and he realized that a new church should be built by the main road in order to accommodate the growth. The brother of Utuwankande Sura Saradiel of Mawanella lived with his family at Haldanduwana and learnt sculpture under Rev. Fr. Chounavel, the Parish Priest of Haldanduwana and a master of sculpture. The historical statue of St. Joseph on the front facade of the St. Joseph's Church Wennappuwa was sculpted by him. The church (1880 AD), which is a symbol of unity and co-existence, stands by the Negombo-Chilaw main road.  Education  Wennapuwa is home to the Joseph Vaz College and the Holy Family Girls' School. and a few school.  Economy  Wennappuwa town has more than 500 businesses. The Wennappuwa Business association is the largest business association there. It represents almost all businesses. Recently they developed the nearby lake. Wennappuwa became known as little Italy because of the number of people who migrated to Italy and earn Euros. All the state banks and many private banks operate there.

Bhiwapur is a town and a tehsil in Umred subdivision of Nagpur district in Nagpur revenue Division in the Berar region in the state of Maharashtra, India. Bhiwapur is famous for chillies, and the main occupation of people in this town is chilli cutting. The town was founded by Bhiwa gawali (Ref-Marathi vishwakosh). A big temple of bhima mata is in it. Bhima mata temple is known in the nearby districts, in Vejyadashme (Dsra) a big fear in the town all religion people celebrated together. 5 high schools are in the town. Bhiwapur education society high school & juner college is old high school in the town. The topper of the area are from this schools. Bhiwapur is famous for red chilles, the main occupation of people in this town is related to processing chillies. The name of this town is derived from the name of goddess Bhima. A very famous temple of Bhima Devi attracts hundreds of devotees every year during the annual fair on Vijaya Dashami. A tiny river called Maru river flows from outskirts of Bhiwapur which gets dried up during hot summers and overflows during good monsoon season. This serves as a source of water for irrigation purpose for the nearby villages. Red Chillies in Nagpur Red Chillies This town was famous for the red chillies which were grown in nearby villages. Chillies are for Bhiwapur what oranges are for Nagpur. But as the time progressed more and more farmers turned up soybean farming rather than chillies because the tedious jobs involved in chilli pepper farming and low yield as compared to the former. Comparatively low fertility of land and weather added to the worries of chilli pepper growers. So the landmark Bhiwapuri Mirchi (Chilli) is very rare to spot today. But still Bhiwapur and nearby area get large amount of chillies from all over India for processing. This involves drying up the chillies under the Sun, separating the stem from the pod, packing in gunny bags and transporting to respective destinations for further processing of consumption. This is the main source of employment for the local people who don't own land for farming. In year 2015 the town is become a nagar panchayat. The 17 no of ward are created in this town.

Comparable systems include Diehl Corporation's Spear and SMArt 155, Israeli Aerospace Industries LAHAT, Israeli Military Industries Excalibur, GIAT Industries Polynege, Alliant Techsystems STAFF and MRM-KE, Raytheon's MRM-CE, and the two final companies' TERM. There are two variants of KSTAMs; KSTAM-I and KSTAM-II. KSTAM-I is modeled after Israel's 105 mm Excalibur top-attack munition, while KSTAM-II is modeled after Diehl's SMArt 155. While the two systems significantly differ from one another, their concept remains the same; to defeat enemy armor by attacking their most vulnerable spot, the top. History Not much is known about the KSTAM-I, other than the fact that it was based on Israeli Military Industry's 105 mm Excalibur top-attack munition. It was to have a minimum range of 2 km with maximum being 5 km. KSTAM-II was co-developed by South Korea and Germany's Diehl Corporation. The KSTAM-II is launched from the 120 mm L55 main guns mounted on the K2 Black Panther main battle tanks that are to be fielded by the South Korean military, and will be used for attacking targets, stationary or moving, that are hidden behind obstacles. It is similar to the SMArt 155. It is speculated that the KSTAM-I has been abandoned in favor of KSTAM-II's higher capability, and thus the following article will focus on KSTAM-II. Basically a guided anti-tank mortar munition, the KSTAM flies with the energy applied to it from the firing of the munition from the main gun. It does not possess any kind of propellants, and should not be confused as a missile or a rocket. The trajectory of the munition is curved, giving it a mortar- or artillery-like capability to strike targets taking cover behind obstacles. Its main use is to destroy entrenched and/or covered enemy vehicles that are unreachable with regular anti-tank shells due to the restrictions in terrain and/or hazards imposed upon the friendly vehicle. Launch vehicle The KSTAM is specifically designed for the 120 mm L55 guns mounted on the K2 Black Panther main battle tanks, and there are no other launch vehicles announced that are capable of firing such projectiles. Onboard equipment The munition is equipped its own guidance and obstacle-avoidance systems for navigation, small millimeter band radar and infrared sensors for target identification, and an Explosively Formed Penetrator for attacking targets. Usage The launch vehicle does not need to be revealed in order to use the munition, as the munition is equipped with its own navigation and targeting systems and gives it fire-and-forget capability. The vehicle can be completely hidden behind obstacles and still be able to launch the munitions as long as there is enough clearing for the barrel to elevate. After being fired, the munition will begin its travel towards over the designated area, aided by four fins to stabilize its flight, where it would deploy its parachutes to slow its descent, giving its target-acquisition radar and infrared sensors enough time to identify and acquire a target, then fire its EFP at the top of it. The munition can be manually controlled in a limited fashion by the launch vehicle using a live data link feed. The minimum range of the munition is 2 km, while the maximum range is 8 km.

As the title of the calling suggests, men who held this position assisted the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in fulfilling their priesthood responsibilities. Assistants to the Twelve were general authorities, and were generally assigned by the Twelve Apostles to preside over and speak at stake conferences; re-organize stakes; tour missions; and assist in the direction of worldwide missionary work. Like counselors in the First Presidency, Assistant to the Twelve was not a distinct priesthood office‚Äîrather, it was a calling that any worthy high priest could be asked to fill. In April 1941, church president Heber J. Grant called five men to serve as Assistants to the Twelve.J. Reuben Clark, Conference Report, April 1941. No more Assistants to the Twelve were called until 1951;David O. McKay, Conference Report, October 1951. the church continued to call Assistants to the Twelve throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and the first half of the 1970s. Of the 38 men who held the calling of Assistant to the Twelve, thirteen later became members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: Marion G. Romney, George Q. Morris, Hugh B. Brown, Gordon B. Hinckley, N. Eldon Tanner, Boyd K. Packer, Marvin J. Ashton, L. Tom Perry, David B. Haight, James E. Faust, Neal A. Maxwell, Robert D. Hales, and Joseph B. Wirthlin. Additionally, a former Assistant to the Twelve (Alvin R. Dyer) was ordained to the office of apostle without being made a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. Seven Assistants to the Twelve (Romney, Brown, Dyer, Isaacson, Hinckley, Tanner, and Faust) later served in the church's First Presidency, with one (Hinckley) later becoming the church's president. In 1976, church president Spencer W. Kimball announced that the calling of Assistant to the Twelve would be discontinued, and that the 22 men then serving in that calling would be ordained to the priesthood office of seventy and assigned to the First Quorum of the Seventy, which had been organized in 1975.Spencer W. Kimball, ‚ÄúThe Reconstitution of the First Quorum of the Seventy‚Äù, Ensign, November 1976, p. 9. The following individuals held the calling of Assistant to Twelve:Grampa Bill's G.A.

After earning a degree in architecture at the University of Florence, he opted for a writing career in his mid to late twenties. Veronesi published his first book at the age of 25, a collection of poetry (Il resto del cielo, 1984) that has remained his only venture into verse writing. What has followed since includes five novels, three books of essays, one theatrical piece, numerous introductions to novels and collections of essays, interviews, screenplay, and television programs. Works Il resto del cielo consists of twenty-five short compositions, none longer than fourteen verses, that speak to the general problematics of communication, all of which is underscored by a constant coincidentia oppositorum. Seemingly simple verses, they speak eloquently to the narrating voice's quotidian landscape. His first novel, Per dove parte questo treno allegro (1988), is the story of a typical relationship of the 1980s between father and son. A troubled rapport between them, the father is an adventurous businessman who, while deep in debt, has squirreled away a few hundred thousand dollars in Switzerland. The son, an insipid thirty-year-old, who acts half his age, is a do-nothing with strange habits. While the two spend a few strained weeks together, their lives eventually begin to find some similarities. With his second novel, Gli sfiorati (1990), Veronesi approaches the family thematics in a much more dramatic fashion. A family recomposed of two previously split ones, here too the father and son experience a troubled relationship. Mete, however, finds comfort in a developing rapport with his beautiful stepsister. All this takes place in Rome, intertwined with other narratives of various social types that one might expect to find in such a chaotic metropolis that Veronesi depicts. Experimental, in some ways, this novels verges on the fantastic, while the author offers up a portrait of the early 1990s and its polymorphous, youthful generation, represented herein by the literal, and metaphorical, sign of \\"schiumevolezza.\\" Faithful to the theme of troubled relationships between two people of different generations, Venite venite B-52 (1995) changes the dynamics to that of father-daughter. As he did in his previous novels, especially in Gli sfiorati, here too Veronesi offers up a gallery of extraordinary characters, beginning with the father, Ennio Miraglia, a representation of the 1980s consumerist Italy, and his daughter Viola, whose desire to free herself of her father's Italy is underscored in the novel's title, her hopes that the American bombers come and destroy that which she abhors. La forza del passato (2000; Premio Viareggio L. Repaci and the Premio Campiello) continues the father-son relationship. This time, however, the father is absent (dead), and ‚Äì again different from before ‚Äì we move from a positive memory of the dead father to one that questions his son's knowledge of who he truly was. Gianni Orzan is a writer of children's books whose life is suddenly shattered when he realizes that what he always believed about his father, and by extension of himself, may have all been a fa√ßade. Through Gianni's eventual stream-of-consciousness, both he and the novel's reader constantly shift between the present and, through the character's memory, the past. Ring City (2001) is a \\"children's novel,‚Äù for lack of a better term. As such, it figures as a wonderful companion piece to La forza del passato, as it is surely a book Gianni Orzan would have written. Topolino (Mickey Mouse) must confront the Fosterman clan, who has taken over the once tranquil city of Vocalia, transforming it into a giant boxing ring. ' (2005) won him Italy's most prestigious award, the Strega Prize. Having lost his wife to a natural death, Pietro Paladini is able to recover his existential bearings only after re-examining life from its metaphorical underbelly, in his subsequent dealings with the people in his life, especially when he unorthodoxly hangs around in front of his daughter's school. Brucia Troia (2007) is Veronesi's latest novel, being released May 2007. An assiduous essayist, much of the material in his non-fiction collections appeared in various daily and weekly newspapers and magazines, and serials, which include: Il manifesto, Epoca, Il Gambero Rosso, La Gazzetta del Prato, l'Unit√†, Nuovi Argomenti, Panta, Corriere della Sera. These books to date include: Cronache italiane (1992) and Live. Ritratti, sopralluoghi e collaudi (Bompiani, 1996), each of which originate chiefly from his journalistic writings. Occhio per occhio. La pena di morte in quattro storie (1992), instead, is an integral study of the death penalty and how it is administered in four different localities around the world: Sudan, Taiwan, the Soviet Union, and California. In 2002, Bompiani brought out his previous two collections, together with his ‚ÄúNuove cronache\\" (1996‚Äì2002), in Superalbo. Le storie complete. In addition to the above, he has also written numerous introductions of various sorts for numerous books that range from novels to collections of essays on many topics, including soccer and rock music. Most recently, he ventured into the world of theatre with his No Man's Land (2003), a drama originating from and similar to Danis Tanovic's film of 2001, this time however with a good dose of Veronesi's caustic irony. Veronesi collaborates with numerous newspapers and licterature magazines. He is also the founder of the publishing house Fandango Libri along with Domenico Procacci, and of the web radio Radiogas. In 2010, italian newsmagazine La Repubblica reported that Fandango's artistic director, as part of the promotional campaign of new Veronesi's book, titled ‚ÄúXY\\", have announced to have inserted some fictional articles in italian language Wikipedia to attract new potential buyers. Shortly after he publicly apologized,http://www.liquida.it/sandro-veronesi/ claiming also to have included just one article in it.wiki. Bibliography =Fiction= * Il resto e il cielo.

Liberal religion in Aberdeen and the North East of Scotland is represented through a Unitarian community and the city is also home to an Islamic mosque in Old Aberdeen and a small Jewish congregation. The Hazelhead area holds a Thai Buddhist temple. There is no formal Hindu building. The University of Aberdeen has a small society of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Christianity The largest denomination in the city (in terms of membership) is the Church of Scotland. The Church of Scotland's Presbytery of Aberdeen has 41 parish churches. In the Middle Ages, Aberdeen contained houses of the Carmelites (Whitefriars) and Franciscans (Greyfriars), the latter surviving in modified form as the chapel of Marischal College as late as the early 20th century. Also churches still in use today are located in the city centre including Bon Accord Free Church which is situated on Rosemount viaduct near His Majesty's Theatre and Gilcomston South Church situated at the corner of Union Street and Summer Street. Many other churches in the city centre have been converted into bars and restaurants. =Kirk of St Nicholas= In the Middle Ages there was only one burgh kirk - the Kirk of St Nicholas, one of Scotland's largest parish churches. Like a number of other Scottish kirks, it was subdivided after the Reformation, in this case into the East and West churches. The Kirk of St Nicholas congregation is now an ecumenical partnership in membership of both the Church of Scotland and the United Reformed Church. The large kirkyard of the Kirk of St Nicholas is separated from Union Street by a 147 ft (45 m) long Ionic fa√ßade, built in 1831. The divided church within, with a central tower and spire, forms one continuous building 220 ft (67 m) in length. =St Machar's Cathedral= The pre- Reformation Diocese of Aberdeen is said to have been first founded at Mortlach in Banffshire by M√°el Coluim II (1005‚Äì1034) to celebrate his victory there over the Danes, but in 1137 David I (1124‚Äì1153) transferred the bishopric to Old Aberdeen, and twenty years later St Machar's Cathedral was begun, a few hundred yards from the river Don. With the exception of the period of the episcopate of William Elphinstone (1484‚Äì1511), building progressed slowly. Gavin Dunbar, who followed him in 1518, completed the structure by adding the two western spires and the southern transept. The church suffered severely at the Reformation, but is still used by the Church of Scotland as a parish church. =St Mary's Cathedral= St Mary's Cathedral is the Roman Catholic cathedral. A Gothic Revival building, it was erected in 1859. =St. Andrew's Cathedral= St. Andrew's Cathedral is the Scottish Episcopal Cathedral. It was constructed in 1817, as St Andrew's Chapel, and was Archibald Simpson's first commission. The church was raised to Cathedral status in 1914. The Episcopal Church in Aberdeen is notable for having consecrated the first bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, Samuel Seabury. The cathedral was renovated in the 1930s to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Seabury's consecration. The memorial was dedicated with a ceremony attended by the then US ambassador to the UK, Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. =Other Churches= Belmont street at the turn of the 19th century was better known as Holy Street as crowds would file out of six churches set over the 400 metre road. The last remaining church congregation in Belmont Street has now moved to Union Square South Christ Central. Triple Kirks pub, The Academy Shopping mall, Neptune Night Club, and Slain's Castle theme pub is all that remains of the 19th-century traditional church. Ironically the last church to be in Belmont Street was the charismatic newfrontiers church, Christ Central, which met in the Belmont Picturehouse. On Justice Street, is the category B listed St Peter's Roman Catholic Church which opened in 1804.

Leopold Flowers, former Executive Commissioner of The Scout Association of Belize, and William Faux, presently Deputy Chief Commissioner, Scouting in Belize was started in 1910 when Henry Longsworth of St. John's Cathedral established a troop there. The oldest records found to date in England indicates that Scouting started in British Honduras in 1911 with two troops, 20 Scouts in total. The following year the numbers were one troop, three Scouters and 24 Scouts, a total of 27. =British Boy Scouts= There is record of the British Boy Scouts (a separate organization to The Scout Association of the United Kingdom) operating in Belize from 1910. =The Boy Scouts Association, British Honduras Branch / The Scout Association of Belize= The Scout Association of Belize was founded as a branch of The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom. The Boy Scouts Association, British Honduras branch was registered in 1917 with a census of eight Scouters, 113 Scouts and 59 Cubs, a total membership of 180. In 1915, Robin O. Phillips, a Boy Scouts of America scout, about 17 years old, is said to have invested 20 young men as Scouts. This took place at Robin's home, then situated at the corner of Wilson Street and Barrack Road. When these Scouts were considered well trained, Robin's father approached Governor William Hart-Bennett to seek assistance and support for the Scout Movement. Governor Bennett then selected George Grabbam, then manager of the Belize Estate and Produce Company Ltd. Mr. Grabham in turn appointed as Scoutmasters to assist him Phillip Ely, a Mr. Wexham and Paul Shephard Berry, then the superintendent of the Belize Wireless Station. In 1917, these men formed a branch of The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom. The association flourished for about three to four years, then ceased when Mr. Grabham left Belize. Scouting was revived again in 1931 in the Belize City area, by Brother John Mark Jacoby, SJ, MBE, Professor of Mathematics at Saint John's College. Hundreds of boys, including many leading citizens, passed through the hands of 'Bra Jake', as he was affectionately known. For many years, Scouting revolved around activities held at the Holy Redeemer Scout room (the home of troops 1, 2 and 3) and at an annual summer camp at San Pedro, Ambergris Caye. In 1936 Scouting was introduced to the districts beginning with the Stann Creek District and eventually spreading to all the others. Since that time the association has always been active in the Belize. The level of this activity has varied considerably over the years, depending largely on the extent of the association‚Äôs ability to attract and maintain committed voluntary leadership. The Boy Scouts Association, British Honduras Branch changed its name to The Scout Association of Belize. The association exists by virtue of the Scout Association of Belize Act, 1987 (assented to on January 25, 1988). On December 15, 1987, The Scout Association of Belize became a direct member organization of the World Organization of the Scout Movement rather than being represented through its parent organization, The Scout Association in London.

Portrayed by former Grange Hill actor Jonathan Dixon, the character first appeared onscreen during the episode airing on 18 March 2007. Creation =Background= Darryl is the less serious-minded of the Morton twins, Darryl can be just plain daft, lazy and is closest to his twin sister Mel. In the interview with Digital Spy, Jonathan went on to confirm this, speaking of his character he said: Darryl first appears on-screen 18 March 2007. He lives in the shed of the garden of Number 6. He gets into trouble with the law for several motoring offences, and is horrified when twin sister Mel (Emma Edmondson) says that she plans to join the police. Soon after his arrival he strikes up a close friendship with next door neighbour David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) (coincidentally his real life childhood friend). =Casting= During the casting for the character of Darryl Morton different actors were called in for auditions for the role. Actor Jonathan Dixon revealed in an interview with Digital Spy that he was called back through five stages of auditioning and eventually got down to the last two where he had to audition against a long term friend. During each stage of auditioning the hopefuls had to audition as sets of twins. Jonathan continually met fellow cast member Emma Edmondson who plays his on-screen sister Mel. In the final audition the two were paired up, and went on to be cast as twins Mel and Darryl. It also emerged that the actor is real life friend of fellow cast member Jack P. Shepherd who plays David Platt in the show. In August 2008, it was thought the character Darryl would exit the street in November, two months after the rest of the Morton family. However, he signed a new 6-month contract. It was reported on 15 May 2009 that Dixon and co-star Wanda Opalinska would be written out of the soap and would be departing later in the year with it being said that this was due to \\"natural storyline progression.\\" Storylines Darryl Morton arrives in Coronation Street with his father Jerry (Michael Starke), grandfather Wilf (Rodney Litchfield), and sisters, Jodie (Samantha Seager), Mel and Kayleigh (Jessica Barden). In April 2007 it was announced that he would be involved in a heavy marijuana smoking scene with Vernon Tomlin (Ian Reddington). It caused controversy, and the soap's executive producer Kieran Roberts stated that: \\"Not all stories are to the taste of all our viewers. But the vast majority of the time we get it right. We do not set out to shock and sensationalise.\\" Although the scene did not air, there is a milder scene at the Morton's house-warming party where Vernon takes on a mellow disposition after smoking a joint Darryl gives him. On 16 September 2007, Darryl's friend 'Stig' asks him to look after some ecstasy tablets. Afraid that his dad would find them, he asks David to look after them, but he hides them in one of his niece's dolls. However, when Bethany (Amy & Emily Walton) swallows one, David decides to protect his friend and bails Darryl out by taking the blame for possession. After a brief flirtation in the Rovers with barmaid Lauren Wilson (Lucy Evans), Darryl begins dating her. After a few dates of playing hard to get, they begin seeing each other on a more regular basis. He often pays for their dates and drinks, even though Mel tells him that his money is the only reason she is interested. Their involvement with each other comes to an end when Lauren becomes angry with him having no money, and states they were never an item. Originally, Darryl was supposed to be leaving with the rest of the Morton clan. However, in an interview with the Liverpool Echo, Michael Starke who plays his father Jerry revealed they had kept Darryl's character on because of \\"his character links in with David Platt\\". Jerry collapses on 27 August 2008 and goes into care on 31 August, where Darryl and the rest of the family were told that Jerry is still alive and has a high chance of staying that way, but also that he may die. Jerry makes a full recovery but discovers that wife Teresa Bryant (Karen Henthorn) has been poisoning him. Darryl, along with his siblings order Teresa out of the family home as a result. Amber Kalirai (Nikki Patel) becomes close to Darryl and they subsequently start a relationship. Darryl opts to stay on in Weatherfield when Jerry decides that he is moving Kayleigh and Finlay (Ramone Quinn) to Spain in September 2008 due to his job and friends being on the Street. He allowed Teresa back into the house after finding her drunk on the street. He subsequently gets into trouble with Amber's overprotective father Dev (Jimmi Harkishin) after he discovers that he is having sex with Amber. In November 2008, Dev takes over Jerry's takeaway shop as it proves too much for Darryl to run alone. Darryl is dismayed to learn that as well as selling the business to Dev, Jerry is putting No. 6 on the market. After much difficulty of running the shop alone on his first day as owner, Dev eventually relents and asks Darryl to run the place for him. Prior due to Jerry's departure, Darryl and his mother Teresa have been evicted form their home as Jerry decides to rent the house to new family, the Windasses. However, before the family can move in, Teresa protests to the idea by barricading herself in the house, refusing to come out. This prompts Darryl to bribe her by putting money in the letter box, but to no avail. The Windasses run out of patience and decide to do the job themselves by smashing the front door window with a crutch. When they run into the house, they discover that Teresa has handcuffed herself to the kitchen oven and cupboard doors. Since she has lost the keys to the handcuffs, the family's son Gary (Mikey North) decides to drag her out of the house. Having nowhere to go, Amber offers Darryl a place to stay with her and Dev, and agrees to the offer to stay, without Teresa. In December 2008, Darryl becomes involved in a scheme of Pam Hobsworth (Kate Anthony)'s to make money. He agrees to sell her the used oil from the takeaway to convert into a form of biofuel. However, the project backfires for the pair during the New Year's Eve episode when Pam accidentally ignites the fuel causing it to explode. Darryl escapes with minor injuries while Pam is hospitalized. March 2009 sees Darryl expressing concern that his relationship with Amber may not survive when she speaks of going to university in London but she reassures him that they will be fine. However, he is unconvinced and several months later, Amber kisses Mitch, a Uni friend after an argument with Darryl. He dumps her and she departs to University alone and upset. Amber returns during Freshers' Week and makes up with Darryl at Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) and Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan)'s party. However, Amber's father Dev, not keen on having Amber choose Darryl over University, bribes him with ¬£500 to dump Amber. Darryl took the money but doesn't cash it and tells Dev what he thinks of him. Amber later finds out thanks to Teresa's interference, and she leaves for Uni once again on the bus, with neither Darryl or Dev able to convince her to stay. On 16 October 2009, Dev discovers that Umed Alahan (Harish Patel) and Teresa are selling curry in the kebab shop, although this is not Darryl's idea. Dev warns him that he is on thin ice, but Darryl, fed up with Dev, quits his job anyway. He then decides to go and live with his family in Spain. He bids farewell to Teresa before boarding the bus to the airport. In May 2010, when Teresa departs Weatherfield, after her relationship with Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles) comes to an end, it is possible that she has gone to Spain to live with Darryl, this is implied after she makes a phone call, presumingly to Darryl, asking for a favour. Reception When the Manchester Evening News spoke upon the axing of the Morton clan, their critic Ian Wylie stated that he had become to like the characters of Darryl and Mel, even though their on- screen family 'failed to fit the Weatherfield jigsaw'. A reporter from Holy Soap described Darryl's most memorable moment as being caught in the fire drama after selling Pam's old cooking oil from the chip shop. On the What's on TV website, Darryl was described as \\"a likeable layabout\\" who \\"totally lacks energy and ambition\\".

The character was portrayed by Emma Edmondson from the character's inception into the episode airing on 18 March 2007 until her departure on 3 October 2008. Storylines Some of the character's earlier minor storylines involved David Platt developing a crush on Mel, but she stood him up. To get his revenge, he spread gossip that he had slept with Mel, but was forced to apologise by his mother. In February 2008, Mel became WPC Morton, joining her friend Abi Sharpe in the police force where she began training to become a full-time Police Constable. At the time, the storyline also saw her onscreen grandfather put his obituary into the local paper, thinking that Mel‚Äôs chances of joining the police force would be improved if the local police thought he was no longer alive to get involved in dodgy dealings. Mel later argued with her mother Teresa Bryant upon her return in May 2008, portraying the rocky relationship between mother and daughter. After Mel returned from holiday in August 2008, she discovered that Teresa had been lying in a deliberate attempt to lengthen her stay in the house. This prompted Mel to make her father choose between herself and her mother. When Jerry chose her mother, she went to stay at Abi's. It was later announced that the character of Mel would be involved in a controversial storyline that would depict the violence that is currently on the streets of Britain. More so, that the storyline reflected an attack that happened in Rochdale when thugs booted an unconscious man in the head. In the soap opera, the latter was depicted happening to fellow character Abi Sharpe, who came to Mel's assistance during the fight. The aftermath of the controversial storyline that involved the character. The episode was screened on 3 September 2008. Mel and Abi went out on the town to celebrate the end of their police training. Outside the bar, they witnessed a gang of girls fighting on the street. Abi called the police and told Mel to stay out of it as they were both off duty but she intervened. Upon seeing her friend being punched and kicked by the girls, Abi attempted to break up the fight but sustained a blow to the head from a glass bottle and received blows to the head after being stamped on. The attackers could not be charged due to lack of evidence, seeing Mel trying to take the law into her own hands.http://www.teletext.co.uk/tvplus/CoronationSt/dcbecefd798e970219530360fb29604b/Tina+Baker's+Corrie+preview.aspx Later in the week, Mel tried to seek revenge on the girls but instead she was confronted by Teresa and they reconciled. Later, she got the revenge she needed as Teresa went behind her back and followed one of the girls into the ladies toilets in the bar where the attack happened. Teresa gave her a blow to the head with a heel of her shoe. Teresa and Mel later fell out yet again after Mel discovered Teresa's scheme and arrested Teresa for attempted murder. Mel was furious when Jerry refused to back up her story, which not only freed Teresa, but damaged Mel's reputation on the force. Jerry, Kayleigh and Finlay left the street on 29 September for Spain; however, Mel didn't want to go as she had only just qualified in police force. She departed on 3 October when she saw Darryl bringing a drunken Teresa back to the house. Unable to cope with the situation, she left to stay with Abi. Creation and development =Casting= During the casting for the character of Mel Morton different actresses were called in for auditions for the role.

He was co-discoverer of Thecodontosaurus, which in 1836 was the fourth dinosaur genus to be named. He also played a part in Gideon Mantell's naming of Iguanodon. As a geological surveyor he mapped a large area of eastern Australia. Early life Stutchbury was born on 15 January 1798 in London, the son of a gauging instrument maker. In 1820 he became assistant conservator at the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons and in 1821 was made an associate of the Linnean Society of London. In 1824 he had a part in Gideon Mantell's identification of Iguanodon, which in 1825 would become the second dinosaur to be formally named. It was Stutchbury who realised that Mantell's fossils of teeth resembled the teeth of the iguana specimen which Stutchbury had just prepared at the Hunterian Museum. In 1825 he sailed on and later Rolla as a zoologist in an expedition of the Pacific Pearl Fishery Company to New South Wales and the Tuamotus. Later years From 1831-50 Stutchbury was curator of the museum at the Bristol Institution (now Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery). Fossil finds from excavations that he carried out at Bristol with local naturalist Henry Riley led to their announcement of Thecodontosaurus in 1836. This was only the fourth dinosaur genus to be named, although it was originally omitted from the group Dinosauria when the group was named by Richard Owen in 1842. In 1841 Stutchbury became a Fellow of the Geological Society of London. From 1850-55 he worked as a geological and mineral surveyor in Australia. Originally appointed to survey the New South Wales gold finds, he eventually mapped 32,000 square miles (over 82,000 square km) from New South Wales to Queensland. Stutchbury died on 12 February 1859 in Bristol. A number of fossil and recent organisms have been named after him.

Since autumn 2006, Parantainen has been working as a professor for photography at the University of Art and Design Helsinki, where he is responsible for the education of new people within The Helsinki School. Style Parantainen is influenced by the Russian film maker Andrei Tarkovsky, whose precise aesthetic is combined with what he himself called ‚Äúthe dirt of the world‚Äù. The effect of this influence in Parantainens pictures, are a combination of high aesthetics and gruesome reality. They are a mixture of social realism and socialist surrealism.

He places metal wires, numbers and words upon the first print, to reveal some of the underlying themes of the picture thereby making it obvious to the observer, that these melancholic images are full of lost hopes and disappointments. Influenced by Anselm Kiefer, Parantainen works with social themes. Violence as a subject is often displayed in his works: violence through physical aggression in the fight for justice and self-assertion, sexual violence or as a means of suppressing people or peoples. In the series ‚ÄúBurning Interiors‚Äù he deals with human anxiety. Taking pictures of rooms on fire, he addresses the subject of human vulnerability. Fire erases everything: trails of an individual‚Äôs life, his personal story, his memories. The artist on his work ‚ÄúOn a domestic scale, catastrophes appear everywhere around me; divorce, hate, irritation, as well as anger and a permanent state of misunderstanding to those closest to me. I feel there is an obvious impossibility to find harmony and a sense of well-being in those negative elements surrounding one. All this can simultaneously be seen as happening on a national and universal level. In these images, I try to create a certain amount of irony in order to present some ways of seeking satisfaction, which in my opinion easily appears in bizarre and even tragic acts of behaviour.

Skiing Mount Everest  Tormod Granheim, his Swedish partner Tomas Olsson and photographer Fredrik Schenholm approached Everest from the Tibetan side in Spring 2006. Granheim climbed the mountain from Advanced Base Camp (6400 meters above sea level) to the summit (8848 m) in a continuous 24‚Äëhour effort, meeting Olsson en route, who spent two days covering the same ground. The route they followed, known as the Mallory route normally takes climbers five days to complete. The pair then skied into the North Face by the Norton Couloir, a 55 degree steep and nearly 3000 meter high mountain face. Near the top Olsson's ski broke, adding extra tension to the already complex task. A cliff intersecting the couloir forced the two to make an abseil. A snow anchor failed and Olsson fell an estimated 2500 meters to his death.

Fort Recovery is a fort on the West End of Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. In historical records, the fort is often referred to as Tower Fort, and the area around the fort is still referred to as \\"Towers\\" today. A hotel is now built around the Tower. History The site was originally an earthen fort that was probably built by the Dutch privateer Joost van Dyk in 1620, when the truce, which had existed between the Dutch and the Spanish in Puerto Rico, ended. Somewhere between 1623 and 1630, Fort Recovery may have been used as a barracks for wounded and ill soldiers; this is probably the source of the name \\"Fort Recovery\\".Fort Recovery Beachfront Villas History of Fort Recovery (retrieved 16 February 2007). However, the information may not be entirely accurate, as it refers to British soldiers even though Britain did not establish a garrison in the Territory until well after 1672. Nor did the Dutch establish a garrison, as the settlements by Jost Van Dyke and his compatriots were essentially private enterprises, with only tacit support from the Dutch West India Company. Accordingly, it is likely that these dates are mistaken, and are more likely to refer to 1723 to 1730. The Fort was later abandoned when the Territory fell into decline after the British seized control of the islands in 1672. However, during the turbulent colonial era commencing with the American Revolutionary War and extending to the Napoleonic wars the fort was rebuilt in its current form. When the British rebuilt the fort, the Martello Tower was clearly added to try to compensate for the lack of elevation of the cannon at the Fort. The fort fell into disrepair again in the early 19th century when the main theater of conflict moved from the colonies to mainland Europe, and the economies of the islands were insufficient for its upkeep. It may also have been that, if the fort was designed to protect a source of freshwater, when the source dried up (there is no freshwater pond there today) the necessity for the fort disappeared. Design and location The fort itself is of a tower structure. The fort is a very early example of a Martello Tower, a type of fortification used extensively along the British south-east coastline during the Napoleonic wars. The location of the fort is somewhat unusual in that it is built close to the sea, on level ground (instead on in an elevated position on the hills rising behind it) and not close to either a port or population source. It has been suggested that the fort was built to protect a freshwater pond that was located near the area. This is plausible; Tortola has no rivers, so wells and freshwater ponds were precious resources. The other possibility is that the fort was built to secure the trail that linked Soper's Hole to Pockwood Pond and Road Town as previous Spanish attacks had landed in Soper's Hole and then proceeded overland to Pockwood Pond and Road Town. It would have been difficult to fortify effectively Soper's Hole against Spanish cannon, but a fort on the soldiers' overland route could delay an attack and prevent another massacre of the type that occurred in 1646. The difficulty with this theory is that it still cannot explain why the fort was not elevated. Also, although it is not clear whether the fort was erected before or after the attacks of 1646 and 1647, it seems more likely that it was actually built before.

In contrast to macroscopic models, microscopic traffic flow models simulate single vehicle-driver units, so the dynamic variables of the models represent microscopic properties like the position and velocity of single vehicles. Car-following models Also known as time-continuous models, all car-following models have in common that they are defined by ordinary differential equations describing the complete dynamics of the vehicles' positions x_\\\\alpha and velocities v_\\\\alpha. It is assumed that the input stimuli of the drivers are restricted to their own velocity v_\\\\alpha, the net distance (bumper-to-bumper distance) s_\\\\alpha = x_{\\\\alpha-1} - x_\\\\alpha - \\\\ell_{\\\\alpha-1} to the leading vehicle \\\\alpha-1 (where \\\\ell_{\\\\alpha-1} denotes the vehicle length), and the velocity v_{\\\\alpha-1} of the leading vehicle. The equation of motion of each vehicle is characterized by an acceleration function that depends on those input stimuli: :\\\\ddot{x}_\\\\alpha(t) = \\\\dot{v}_\\\\alpha(t) = F(v_\\\\alpha(t), s_\\\\alpha(t), v_{\\\\alpha-1}(t)) In general, the driving behavior of a single driver-vehicle unit \\\\alpha might not merely depend on the immediate leader \\\\alpha-1 but on the n_a vehicles in front. The equation of motion in this more generalized form reads: :\\\\dot{v}_\\\\alpha(t) = f(x_\\\\alpha(t), v_\\\\alpha(t), x_{\\\\alpha-1}(t), v_{\\\\alpha-1}(t), \\\\ldots, x_{\\\\alpha-n_a}(t), v_{\\\\alpha-n_a}(t)) =Examples of car-following models= * Optimal velocity model (OVM) * Velocity difference model (VDIFF) * Wiedemann model (1974) * Intelligent driver model (IDM, 1999) * Gipps' model (Gipps, 1981) Cellular automaton models Cellular automaton (CA) models use integer variables to describe the dynamical properties of the system. The road is divided into sections of a certain length \\\\Delta x and the time is discretized to steps of \\\\Delta t. Each road section can either be occupied by a vehicle or empty and the dynamics are given by update rules of the form: :v_\\\\alpha^{t+1} = f(s_\\\\alpha^t, v_\\\\alpha^t, v_{\\\\alpha-1}^t, \\\\ldots) :x_\\\\alpha^{t+1} = x_\\\\alpha^t + v_\\\\alpha^{t+1} (the simulation time t is measured in units of \\\\Delta t and the vehicle positions x_\\\\alpha in units of \\\\Delta x). The time scale is typically given by the reaction time of a human driver, \\\\Delta t = 1 \\\\text{s}. With \\\\Delta t fixed, the length of the road sections determines the granularity of the model. At a complete standstill, the average road length occupied by one vehicle is approximately 7.5 meters. Setting \\\\Delta x to this value leads to a model where one vehicle always occupies exactly one section of the road and a velocity of 5 corresponds to 5 \\\\Delta x/\\\\Delta t = 135 \\\\text{km/h}, which is then set to be the maximum velocity a driver wants to drive at. However, in such a model, the smallest possible acceleration would be \\\\Delta x/(\\\\Delta t)^2 = 7.5 \\\\text{m}/\\\\text{s}^2 which is unrealistic. Therefore, many modern CA models use a finer spatial discretization, for example \\\\Delta x = 1.5 \\\\text{m}, leading to a smallest possible acceleration of 1.5 \\\\text{m}/\\\\text{s}^2. Although cellular automaton models lack the accuracy of the time-continuous car-following models, they still have the ability to reproduce a wide range of traffic phenomena. Due to the simplicity of the models, they are numerically very efficient and can be used to simulate large road networks in realtime or even faster. =Examples of CA models= * Rule 184 * Biham‚ÄìMiddleton‚ÄìLevine traffic model * Nagel‚ÄìSchreckenberg model (NaSch, 1992) See also *Microsimulation Category:Road traffic management Category:Mathematical modeling ","title":"Microscopic traffic flow model"},{"id":"9518855","text":"Peter Damian Kavanagh (born 1959) is a former Australian politician, teacher, barrister and legal academic, who served as a member of the Victorian Legislative Council representing the Democratic Labor Party (DLP).

He has worked as a barrister, law lecturer and teacher. Kavanagh has travelled extensively within Australia and around the world, especially in East Asia. He has spent a total of more than two years in China and formally studied in Taipei, Nanjing, Beijing, Tokyo and Rome. He lectured in a college in Malaysia between 1994 and 1996. Kavanagh has working fluency in written and spoken Mandarin Chinese and retains some abilities in Japanese, Indonesian and Malay. He later obtained a Master of Arts in Asian Studies with Honours and a Graduate Diploma in Arts (Asian Studies) from the University of Melbourne. Political career At the 2006 Victorian election Kavanagh stood as the DLP's lead candidate in the newly formed Western Victoria Region, which elects five members via proportional representation. Despite winning only 2.5% of the vote, Kavanagh was able to win the final seat due to receiving preferences from both of the major parties. Peter Kavanagh maintained he was attempting to use his share of the balance of power constructively, in particular encouraging the Government and Opposition to work towards and achieve agreement on some legislation. Kavanagh led opposition within the Parliament to the decriminalisation of abortion under the Crimes Act in Victoria. In opposing the Abortion Bill 2008 Kavanagh also sent a photograph to other MPs of American Samuel Armas who, after being operated on while still in the womb, reached from inside his mother's body and grasped the surgeon's finger, in a gesture that looks like an expression of gratitude. Sending this photo prompted a storm of abuse and vitriol from some other MPs. In Parliament Kavanagh also proposed amendments to the Abortion Bill 2008 (including a requirement for pain relief for the fetus) which would have mitigated the legislation. He also made an impassioned three and a half-hour speech against the Abortion Bill (Victoria, Legislative Council (2008) Debates, 9 October, p. 4093.) which earned him extraordinarily enthusiastic, loud and sustained applause from the public gallery.The Herald Sun, 10 October 2008, p. 3 His proposed amendments were all rejected however and the Bill was passed unamended by 23 to 17 votes. Surprising many, Kavanagh has also expressed a willingness to consider gay civil unions in Victoria \\"providing there is a special status retained for marriage\\". Kavanagh was defeated at the Victorian state elections held on 29 November 2010. The DLP was again unrepresented in the Victorian parliament until the 2014 election when Rachel Carling-Jenkins won a Legislative Council seat for the DLP.

Normally the metal in the mould cools at a certain rate relative to thickness of the casting. When the geometry of the molding cavity prevents directional solidification from occurring naturally, a chill can be strategically placed to help promote it. There are two types of chills: internal and external chills.. Types Internal chills are pieces of metal that are placed inside the molding cavity. When the cavity is filled, part of the chill will melt and ultimately become part of the casting, thus the chill must be the same material as the casting. Note that internal chills will absorb both heat capacity and heat of fusion energy. External chills are masses of material that have a high heat capacity and thermal conductivity. They are placed on the edge of the molding cavity, and effectively become part of the wall of the molding cavity. This type of chill can be used to increase the feeding distance of a riser or reduce the number of risers required. Materials Chills can be made of many materials, including iron, copper, bronze, aluminium, graphite, and silicon carbide. Other sand materials with higher densities, thermal conductivity or thermal capacity can also be used as a chill. For example, chromite sand or zircon sand can be used when molding with silica sand.

The book gives a Marxist view on the history of women and is considered to be a pioneer work of Marxist feminism. It has been translated into many languages. In Woman's Evolution, Reed asks what anthropology can tell us about social evolution.Reed, Evelyn. Woman's Evolution: From Matriarchal Clan to Patriarchal Family, Pathfinder Press 1975. Page references in the text are to this edition. She concludes that social organization was created out of the mother-child relationship - initially as a matrilineal clan system, long before patriarchal families became the norm (page xiii). She focuses particularly on the earliest records of 'primitive' communities (with economies based on hunter-gathering or simple agriculture) (pp468,xviii). These communities used to be quite widespread up to the nineteenth century. They did not have any written language and Reed notes that within a very few years following contact with Europeans their social structure often changed substantially (p162). So she relies on the earliest anthropological records, drawing particularly on a review of such work by Robert Briffault published in 1927 (page xv). Her basic observation is that such communities were organised around a group of women together with their children. When the boys reached a certain age, usually in the range 6 to 10, they would be transferred to an associated group of men (p82). The men therefore would be the brothers of the women and maternal uncles of the children, but they would not be the biological fathers because of strict rules of exogamy enforced by traditions based on totem and taboo. Reed notes there was a double taboo (pp23,204). Sexual relations were not permitted within associated kin groups. But also men were not permitted to kill anyone within the same defined kin groups. Typically there was also a strong prohibition against men eating women's food and vice versa (pp71,83,91). The systems of totem and taboo prevented cannibalism only within defined groups. However they did usually require men not to kill any woman, or often even any female animal (p280). Reed argues this was enforced by belief in women having superior magic - demonstrated by their ability to produce children (p108). From a feminist perspective, the most important point to be drawn is that early human society was almost certainly organised along matrilineal lines with people tracing their kin ties through their mothers. Men were typically kept well away from child birth and may not even have known where babies come from (p340). These communities could be described as matriarchal at least as far as children were concerned. Women did not control men so much other than excluding them from family life. Reed argues this was probably to protect women and children from male hunters, i.e. from cannibalism which she notes is found in fossil records throughout the paleolithic era, though it died out with Homo sapiens (pp27‚Äì28). Also important from a feminist perspective, in hunter-gatherer communities women gathered food for themselves and their children; men hunted food for themselves. Studies quoted by Reed show that in most areas the most reliable sources of food were not animal but vegetable (p106). In other words, the typical patriarchal claims that human society was founded on the skills of hunting are not credible. The gendered division of food consumption as well as food gathering meant that men were relying on a completely different food source to that of women and children. It may be that the evolutionary advantage of the social organization of Homo sapiens was not that male hunting contributed to the family's food but rather that it allowed men not to compete for the family's food. Reed argues there are no credible examples of communities moving from patriarchal to matrilineal, but many examples in history and mythology of moving from matrilineal to patriarchal - though the process is not well understood (p166). Many of the matrilineal communities studied by early anthropologists changed very rapidly, allowing later anthropologists to believe that patriarchal or patrilineal relations were the norm. Thus was evidence of the original matriarchy written out of history almost before it was written in. As Reed says, we should not see this matriarchy as a \\"lost paradise\\" (page xviii). One obvious flaw with the early social structure based on totem and taboo was that it always required some people to be outside the favoured kin groups in order to provide sexual partners (pp319,355,381). When men started to cohabit with women as husbands they were divided between their responsibility in their own lineage for their sisters' sons and their responsibility for their wives' children. Reed speculates that this may have been the cause of widespread child sacrifices in many communities at the dawn of 'civilization' (pp403‚Äì4). The transition from matrilineal to patriarchal is perhaps best shown in the Greek myth of Orestes (who killed his mother Clytemnestra in revenge for her killing his father Agamemnon, which was in revenge for Agamemnon sacrificing their daughter) (pp460‚Äì4). When Orestes is put on trial the key question, as related by Reed, is whether he is the flesh and blood of his mother, as in matrilineal custom, or the product of his father's seed as asserted in patriarchal custom. Luckily for Orestes, the judge is Athena, the goddess of wisdom, who has to accept that she herself was born without a mother (she was plucked out of Zeus's head) - thus proving the patriarchal assertion that a mother is not necessary. So Orestes was his father's flesh and blood and it was OK to kill his mother. On such impeccable logic was the patriarchal rule of law founded in Ancient Greece.

This organization later united with a similar organization at Northwestern University and became Phi Sigma. Phi Sigma was nationalized in 1924, and chapters were organized at leading colleges and universities. On May 14, 1927, it became Eta Sigma Phi, the National Honorary Classical Fraternity, and was incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois. Though nominally a fraternity, as an honor society it is open to all genders. Purpose The Constitution of Eta Sigma Phi states that the purposes of the society are as follows: *To develop and promote interest in classical study among the students of colleges and universities *To promote closer fraternal relationship among students who are interested in classical study, including inter-campus relationship *To engage generally in an effort to stimulate interest in classical study, and in the history, art, and literature of ancient Greece and Rome. Motto The organization's Greek motto, œÜŒπŒªŒøœÉŒøœÜŒø·ø¶ŒºŒµŒΩ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÜŒπŒªŒøŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒø·ø¶ŒºŒµŒΩ (English transliteration: \\"philosopho√ªmen ka√¨ philokalo√ªmen\\"), translates into \\"We love wisdom and beauty.\\" The saying is a paraphrase from Pericles' famous funeral oration delivered to his fellow Athenians. Eligibility =Chapters= Local chapters are chartered at liberal arts colleges and universities which are on the accredited list of the Association of American Universities or the recognized regional accrediting agency. Normally the institution will offer a major in Classics. =Faculty= Faculty who did not join Eta Sigma Phi as undergraduates may be elected as honorary members of the local chapter at their institution. =Students= *Student's college or university has an active, officially chartered chapter. National: *Completion with \\"A\\" average or above in a Latin and/or Ancient Greek course. Local: *Completion with \\"A\\" average or above in any one classical studies course and enrollment in another expecting the same, or a \\"B\\" average or above in any two courses in classical studies. Types of Membership There are three categories of membership: =Active membership= Limited to undergraduates who are enrolled in classes in Latin and/or Greek in the original languages. A student must meet the basic qualification of an attained grade of not less than \\"B\\" in courses in Latin and Greek, with completion of at least one semester or two quarters. The chapters are permitted considerable autonomy in any additional requirements for membership; however, the grade standard stated above must be observed, and it is expected that chapters will maintain even higher standards. =Associate membership= Open to graduate students who were undergraduate members of Eta Sigma Phi and graduate students in Classics elected under the requirements of membership. =Honorary membership= Conferred upon persons selected by the chapter for their interest in the Classics and contributions to the understanding and appreciation of classical languages, history, and culture. Organization Eta Sigma Phi is an undergraduate society, and its officers are active (undergraduate) members who are elected to office for a period of one year by the annual national convention. Currently, the officers are: Kyle Oskvig of the University of Iowa, Megas Prytanis (President); Jordan Dillon of the Truman State University, Megas Hyparchos (Vice President); Brandon Glackin of Temple University, Megale Grammateus (Secretary); and Katelynn Torcato of Stockton University, Megale Chrysophylax (Treasurer). The finances of the society are managed by a Board of Trustees, composed of five faculty members from active chapters who are elected for a period of three years. The Current Chairperson of the Board is Dr. Martha Davis of Temple University. This Board also administers the contests and scholarship program. The Executive Secretary is a faculty member of an active chapter who is responsible for carrying out the policies of the society and is required to perform the duties usually assigned to this position. The current Executive Secretary is Dr. Thomas J. Sienkewicz of Monmouth College. Works and Activities The value of Eta Sigma Phi is revealed particularly in the work of local chapters and the effect of the society upon individual members and upon the academic community. Although Eta Sigma Phi is \\"honorary\\" in nature, chapters usually must utilize programs or activities to carry out the purposes of the society. Groups of chapters use regional conferences as a means of stimulating interest and exchanging ideas. At the national level, Eta Sigma Phi sponsors the following activities: =Scholarships= Each year the society awards two scholarships for study abroad during the summer, one to the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and the other to the American Academy in Rome, to members who have recently graduated. A third scholarship, to a session of the Vergilian Society at Cumae, is also offered, with preference going to rising juniors and seniors. =Contests= Each year the society sponsors contests among college and university students to encourage the study of Latin and Greek on the college level. Participation in the contests is limited to colleges and universities in which there are Eta Sigma Phi chapters. The contests are in Greek translation, Latin translation, and Latin prose composition. =Medals= The society makes available to high school teachers inexpensive medals to award to outstanding students. Many Eta Sigma Phi chapters also award the medals in local high schools. These medals are intended to encourage the study of Latin in high school. =Newsletter= NUNTIUS is the official publication of Eta Sigma Phi, published two times each year. It contains information concerning the society, original articles by members, announcements, and accounts of the activities of the chapters. The current editor is Dr. Thomas J. Sienkewicz of Monmouth College. =National Convention= The Constitution provides for a national convention each year, late in March or in April. At this time, delegates conduct the business of the society, including the election of national officers, and workshops are held. Local chapters bid to host the convention, and an effort is made to move the site from region to region to accommodate chapters in different parts of the country. Fees =National= There is a charter fee (currently $50) paid to the national office to establish a new chapter. The only charge for active (undergraduate) membership imposed by the national office is an initiation fee (currently $40 per active member). For this fee an active member receives a membership card, a membership certificate, and a subscription to NUNTIUS during the remainder of his or her undergraduate years. Associate members pay a fee of $5, and honorary members pay no fees. There are additional charges for NUNTIUS subscriptions and membership certificates for associate and honorary members. There are no annual dues to the national organization. =Local= Local chapters may impose an additional initiation charge and/or dues, as well as conduct fund-raising activities, to support their operations. Charter Petitions The procedure involved in organizing a chapter is as follows: *A petition, executed by a group of qualified undergraduate students and with the endorsement of a faculty member of the appropriate department, is addressed to and filed with the Executive Secretary. *The petition is submitted to the Grand Executive Council, composed of the national officers, for consideration. *If the petition is approved by the Grand Executive Council, it is submitted to the national convention for final action. *If the petition is approved by delegates to the national convention, installation of the new chapter may take place upon payment of the charter fee and initiation fee for each person to be initiated. The Executive Secretary designates a person or group to officiate at the installation of the new chapter. *A petition should reach the Executive Secretary by February 15 of any year to be considered at the next national convention. The form for petitioning for chapters is enclosed. *It is suggested that the local Classical Club be used as a nucleus for forming a chapter of Eta Sigma Phi. If there is not such an organization on your campus, it is suggested further that such a club be formed prior to petitioning for a charter.

Life and career Raised in an orphanage [\\"children's home\\"], he taught himself to play several folk instruments and the piano. In 1941, after Operation Barbarossa began and when he was already a student at Moscow Conservatory, he joined the army as a volunteer, there directing various grass-roots performances, and writing songs and music to dramas. In 1943‚Äì50 (1945‚Äì50, according to other sources) he resumed his studies at the Moscow Conservatory under Dmitri Shostakovich and Nikolay Myaskovsky (in composition) and Igor Sposobin (in music theory). Inasmuch as in 1948 Shostakovich was accused of \\"formalism\\" in music, the same tendencies were detected in the works of his pupils, particularly Galynin. Tikhon Khrennikov criticized Galynin's First Piano Concerto in particular, although later (in 1957) he denied such an assessment. Nevertheless, the composer was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1951 for his \\"Epic Poem\\" (1950). Despite falling seriously ill with schizophrenia in 1951 and in consequence spending a considerable part of his life in hospitals and psychiatric clinics, Galynin remained an active composer. His work is a bright phenomenon in Soviet classical music though still underestimated, unfortunately, in his homeland and largely overlooked in the West. Within the well-developed system of public Children's Music Schools in Russia and the former Soviet republics Galynin is most gratefully remembered for his short and easy pieces of music composed for beginners, some of them being variations of popular folk melodies. \\"The composer‚Äôs bright and original talent was a union of melodic generosity, picturesque harmonies, a sense of modern colouring, and elegance of classical form\\", the Encyclopedia of Music (Moscow, 1973) wrote of him.

She married a cousin, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia, with whom she had seven children. She was the mother-in-law of Felix Yusupov and a cousin of Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia who, together, killed Grigori Rasputin, holy healer to her nephew, the haemophiliac Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia. During her brother's reign she recorded in her diary and letters increasing concern about his rule. After the fall of the monarchy in February 1917, she fled Russia, eventually settling in the United Kingdom. Her grandson Prince Andrew Andreevich has been a head of the Romanov Family since December 2016. Early life Xenia with her mother, 1878 Grand Duchess Xenia (right), with her brother Michael Alexandrovich and cousins, Victoria and Louise, daughters of Edward VII. Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna was born on 6 April 1875 at Anichkov Palace in St. Petersburg.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.4 She was the elder daughter among the six children of Alexander III of Russia and his wife, Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia (n√©e Princess Dagmar of Denmark). After the assassination of her paternal grandfather Tsar Alexander II of Russia, when Xenia was six years old, her father Alexander III ascended to the Russian throne in 1881. It was a difficult political time, plagued with terrorist threats. For security reasons, Alexander III moved with his family from the Winter Palace to Gatchina Palace. There, Xenia and her siblings enjoyed a relatively simple childhood, sleeping on cot beds, waking at 6am, and taking cold baths every morning. Their rooms were also simply furnished, though comfortable. Like her brothers, Xenia was educated by private tutors. A special emphasis was laid on the study of foreign languages.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.12 Apart from her native Russian, Xenia studied English, French, and German. Xenia learnt cookery, joinery, and making puppets and their clothes for their theatre. She also enjoyed riding and fishing on the Gatchina estate,Van der Kiste and Hall, p.18 drawing (for which she supposedly had a particular talent), gymnastics, dancing, and playing the piano. She was also a tomboy when she was younger, and somewhat shy. Her entire family enjoyed family holidays at the home of her Danish maternal grandparents, Fredensborg Castle.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.15 It was on such a visit that she met her cousin and lifelong friend, Princess Marie of Greece, daughter of King George I of Greece and his Russian-born wife, Queen Olga. The Danish composer, Valdemar Vater, paid Xenia a tribute by writing the \\"Polka Mazurka\\".Van der Kiste and Hall, p.17 In the Winter of 1888, she caught typhoid and had to have her hair cut as it began to fall out, though luckily made a full recovery. Only a few years later, she began suffering from some sort of recurring skin disease, possibly Eczema, causing painful red spots.  Early marriage  Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna with her husband. Xenia and her paternal first cousin once removed Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia, her eventual husband, played together as friends in the 1880s. Alexander, usually called Sandro, was also a friend of her brother, Nicholas. In 1886, 20-year-old Alexander was serving in the navy. Eleven-year-old Xenia sent him a card when his ship was in Brazil, \\"Best wishes and speedy return! Your sailor Xenia\\". In 1889, Alexander wrote of Xenia, \\"She is fourteen. I think she likes me.\\" At age 15, though Xenia and Alexander wanted to marry, her parents were reluctant because Xenia was too young and they were unsure of Alexander's character. The Tsarina Maria Feodorovna had complained of Alexander's arrogance and rudeness. It was not until 12 January 1894 that Xenia's parents accepted the engagement, after Alexander's father, Grand Duke Michael Nikolaievich of Russia, intervened. The couple finally wed on 6 August 1894, when Xenia was 19, in the SS Peter & Paul Chapel of the Peterhof Palace.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.37 Xenia's younger sister, Olga, wrote about the joy of the wedding, \\"The Emperor was so happy. It was the last time I ever saw him like that.\\" Korneva and Cheboksarova, p.196 They spent their wedding night at Ropsha Palace, and their honeymoon at Ai-Todor (Alexander's estate in Crimea). During the honeymoon, Xenia's father, Alexander III, became ill and died on 1 November 1894.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.41 After his death, Xenia's eldest brother inherited the Crown and became the new Tsar Nicholas II. Charitable works Xenia as a young woman Xenia contributed strongly to charitable works. She was a member of the Women's Patriotic Association. From 1903, Xenia was patron of the Creche Society of St. Petersburg, which looked after poor working-class children while their parents were at work. She took a particular interest in hospitals for patients suffering from tuberculosis in the Crimea, perhaps influenced by the death of her brother George from the disease in 1899. She was also patron of the Maritime Naval Welfare Association, which took care of widows and children of naval personnel. Xenia founded the Xenia Association for the Welfare of Children of Workers and Airmen. In addition, she was patron of the Xenia Institute, a St. Petersburg boarding school for 350 students.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.73-74 Russo-Japanese War Like other members of her family, Xenia had been grateful to her father for keeping Russia out of wars. On 25 January 1904, Xenia recorded in her diary that war had been declared between Russia and Japan.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.56 The previous December, Xenia had told the War Minister, Kuropatkin, that there would be no war and that her brother did not want war. The War Minister said the whole matter might be outside the control of Russia. As war broke out, there was unrest in Russia. On a cold Sunday in January 1905, over 150,000 peaceful people approached the Winter Palace under the leadership of Father Gapon. The people wanted to present the Tsar with a petition. The St. Petersburg police had asked for help from the army, which fired into the crowd, resulting in 2,000 casualties. The day would be known as \\"Bloody Sunday\\" and mark a turning point in the relationship between the Tsar and his people.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.59 In February, Xenia's uncle Sergei, was killed by a bomb in Moscow. Xenia wanted to be with her aunt Ella, but was told the situation was too dangerous. Xenia was exasperated on hearing of Russia's military defeat in Korea.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.60 She had been angry about the start of the war and recorded her thoughts on the end, \\"and ended even more stupidly!\\" Xenia was in the Crimea at their home at Ai-Todor with her husband and children, when news of the mutiny of the Black Sea fleet reached them. In October, her brother was forced to agree to the establishment of a Duma as a concession to the people. Some of Xenia's family saw it as \\"the end of Russian autocracy\\".Van der Kiste and Hall, p.61 Her husband Sandro had resigned his position at the Ministry of Merchant Marine. Xenia and her family spent Christmas at Ai-Todor as it was not safe to travel north, or from their estate. A Christmas service was held in the house, with the priest being driven there and back \\"in a closed landau under an escort of cavalry\\". World War I and the collapse of the empire The former mansion of Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna in St Petersburg The outbreak of war caught Xenia and her mother unaware: Xenia was in France while the Dowager Empress was in London.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.86 They arranged to meet in Calais, where the private train of the Dowager Empress was waiting to take them to Russia, being confident that the German Kaiser Wilhelm II would let them through. Arriving in Berlin, they found the line to Russia had been closed. Hearing that the Yusupovs were also in Berlin, the Dowager Empress ordered that they join the train. An ugly situation ensued in Berlin until finally the train was allowed to travel to Denmark,Van der Kiste and Hall, p.87 and then on to Finland. Arriving back in Russia, Xenia threw herself into war work, providing her own hospital train and opening a large hospital for the wounded. She also chaired the Xenia Institute, which provided artificial limbs for the maimed. In 1915, learning that Nicholas intended to take command of the armed forces, she accompanied her mother to Tsarskoe Selo in an attempt to dissuade him. The Dowager Empress had recorded her lack of confidence in her diary,Van der Kiste and Hall, p.91 and this was borne out. Xenia returned disheartened to the Yelagin Palace. In February 1916, Xenia travelled to Kiev after an illness to see her mother and sister Olga. Her sister finally had her shell of a first marriage dissolved by the Tsar and was married in November 1916 to Nikolai Kulikovsky in the presence of the Dowager Empress in Kiev.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.93 Xenia was absent. On 28 October 1916, increasingly depressed by Russia's predicament, Xenia wrote to her mother, speculating what her father would have done. Xenia, her mother, and her sister Olga urged Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich to write to the Tsar warning him about the influence of the Tsarina in government affairs. Nicholas did not even open the envelope. The Tsarina read it and accused the Grand Duke of \\"crawling behind [his] mother and sisters.\\" Realising the danger, Xenia and her family moved to Ai-Todor in the Crimea. From there, Xenia heard of Rasputin's murder and was embarrassed by the episode.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.94 She wrote to her mother in Kiev, \\"Sleep little. There is rumour that Rasputin is murdered!\\"Van der Kiste and Hall, p.95 Xenia's son-in-law had been one of the murderers. At the beginning of 1917, Xenia hoped her mother could make her brother see sense about the collapsing situation in Russia. She wrote in despair, hoping she would persuade him.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.97 Her mother felt she could not do anything and that she had no intention of returning to St. Petersburg from Kiev. On 19 February 1917, Xenia was back in St. Petersburg at her palace. On 25 February, she wrote in her diary, \\"There are disturbances in the city, there was even shooting into the crowd, [they] say, but everything is quiet on the Nevsky. They are asking for bread and the factories are on strike.\\"Van der Kiste and Hall, p.98 On 1 March 1917 she wrote of rumours circulating that Nicholas's train had been stopped, and that he had been forced to abdicate.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.100 The Dowager Empress wrote to her about her meeting with Nicholas in Mogilev, \\"I still can't believe that this dreadful nightmare is real!\\"Van der Kiste and Hall, p.103 Xenia tried to see her brother but was refused permission by the Russian Provisional Government. Seeing no future where she was in St. Petersburg, Xenia left for Ai-Todor on 6 April, her 42nd birthday.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.105 Exile from Russia Xenia arrived at Ai-Todor where she joined her mother, husband, and sister on 28 March 1917. At the end of November, Xenia wrote to her brother Nicholas in Tobolsk in Siberia, > \\"The heart bleeds at the thought of what you have gone through, what you > have lived and what you are still living! At every step undeserved horrors > and humiliations. But fear not, the Lord sees all. As long as you are > healthy and well. Sometimes it seems like a terrible nightmare, and that I > will wake up and it will all be gone! Poor Russia! What will happen to > her?\\"Van der Kiste and Hall, p.124 In 1918, while in Crimea, Xenia learnt that her brother Nicholas II, his wife, and their children had been murdered by the Bolsheviks. Her last surviving brother, Michael, was also murdered (by shooting) in 1918 outside Perm. While the Red Army was coming closer to the Crimea, Xenia and her mother, the Dowager Empress Maria, escaped from Russia on 11 April 1919 with the help of Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom (n√©e Princess Alexandra of Denmark), Dowager Empress Maria's sister. King George V of the United Kingdom sent the British warship HMS Marlborough which brought them and sixteen other Romanovs (including five of her sons) from the Crimea through the Black Sea to Malta, and then to England. Xenia remained in Great Britain, while Dowager Empress Maria, after a stay in England, was joined by Olga at Villa Hvidore outside Copenhagen in Denmark. Later years Xenia Alexandrovna (c.1925) On 17 May 1920, Xenia had been granted Letters of Administration as eldest sister and heir to her brother Nicholas's estate in England worth five hundred British pounds sterling.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.159 Her husband Sandro was living at this time in Paris. By 1925, Xenia's financial situation had become desperate. King George V, who was her first cousin, allowed her to settle in Frogmore Cottage, a grace and favour house, in Windsor Great Park,Van der Kiste and Hall, p.171 for which she was grateful. Later she had to deal with the fraudulent claims of Anna Anderson to be her niece, the murdered Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.175 Her sister Olga had pointed out if there had been any Romanov monies left, the Dowager Empress would not be receiving a pension from the British King. In July 1928, ten years after the death of Nicholas and Alexandra, his family were legally presumed dead. Xenia and her family had hoped to take possession of the Langinkoski estate in Kotka, Finland, but this came to nothing.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.178-179 Xenia visited her mother, the Dowager Empress, in Denmark as often as she could. Her mother was living in a villa, Hvid√∏re, that she and her sister Alexandra had bought on the Danish coast north of Copenhagen. In 1928, Xenia's mother fell seriously ill and died on 13 October.Korneva and Cheboksarova, p.244 After the death of her mother, the sale of the Hvid√∏re estate, and the jewels of the Dowager Empress brought in some income. No sooner had the Dowager Empress died than Xenia received a letter from Gleb Botkin, son of her late brother's doctor, claiming that Xenia was trying to steal from her niece, Anastasia.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.184 Her husband declared in a letter to her his disdain for the \\"vileness\\" of Botkin.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.185 On 26 February 1933, Xenia's husband Sandro died. Xenia and her sons attended his funeral on 1 March, in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin in the south of France. By March 1937, Xenia had moved from Frogmore Cottage in Windsor Great Park to Wilderness House in the grounds of Hampton Court Palace. She lived there until her death on 20 April 1960. Despite reduced circumstances during her lifetime, Xenia left a small estate to her remaining relatives. Issue and later marriage Xenia and Alexander had seven children together, one daughter followed by six sons: * Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia (15 July 1895 ‚Äì 26 February 1970) m. Prince Felix Yussupov * Prince Andrei Alexandrovich of Russia (24 January 1897 ‚Äì 8 May 1981) m. 1. Donna Elisabeth Ruffo-Sasso, m. 2. Nadine McDougall * Prince Feodor Alexandrovich of Russia (23 December 1898 ‚Äì 30 November 1968) m. Princess Irina Pavlovna Paley * Prince Nikita Alexandrovich of Russia (16 January 1900 ‚Äì 12 September 1974) m. Countess Maria Vorontsova-Dashkova * Prince Dmitri Alexandrovich of Russia (15 August 1901 ‚Äì 7 July 1980) m. 1. Countess Marina Sergeyevna Golenischeva- Kutuzova, m. 2. Margaret Sheila MacKellar * Prince Rostislav Alexandrovich of Russia (24 November 1902 ‚Äì 31 July 1978) m. 1. Princess Alexandra Pavlovna Galitzine m. 2. Hedwig von Chappuis * Prince Vasili Alexandrovich of Russia (6 July 1907 ‚Äì 23 June 1989) m. Princess Natalia Golitsyna The children were grandchildren of a tsar (Alexander III) through their mother (female line), but only great-grandchildren of a tsar (Nicholas I) through their father (male line). Due to Imperial Family Statutes brought in by Alexander III to limit the rank of Grand Duke and Duchess, they held the title Princes and Princesses of Russia with the style of ‚ÄúHighness‚Äù. One of Xenia's descendants could have become the Head of the Imperial House of Russia, but all of her children, like all the other Romanovs, married morganatically, making them ineligible, in accordance with the old succession laws of Russia. As a result, none of the current descendants of the Romanov Family, including Maria, the daughter of Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov, whose mother was from a family recognised as non-dynastic by the last ruling Emperor of Russia, Nicholas II, are born of a Dynastic Marriage, under the old succession laws of Russia. However, her descendants are the only Romanov descendants of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and the closest Romanov blood relations of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. From left to right: Rostislav, Grand Duke Alexander, Grand Duchess Xenia, Vasili, Irina, Nikita (on the floor) Fyodor, Dmitry, Andrei In 1913, Xenia and Sandro's daughter Irina expressed her intention of marrying Prince Felix Yussupov. He was heir to the largest private fortune in Russia.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.81 Felix had decided that Irina would make the perfect wife. Xenia was not happy at the prospect of giving approval to such a marriage, as Felix had a notorious reputation. It was rumoured he had had an affair with Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich of Russia. The Dowager Empress had heard the rumour and summoned Felix to meet with her, but Felix's charms won her over. She said, \\"Do not worry, I will do all that I can for your happiness.\\"Van der Kiste and Hall, p.82 Xenia's only daughter was married on 9 February 1914 in the presence of the Tsar, who gave her away. The wedding was held at one of the smaller palaces due to a falling out between Xenia and Tsarina Alexandra. Xenia walked behind with Sandro and her mother.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.83 During Xenia's last pregnancy in 1907, Alexander had an affair with a woman identified only as \\"Maria Ivanovna\\" in Biarritz. One year later, Xenia also began to have an affair, with an Englishman named \\"Fane.\\" Xenia referred to him simply as \\"F.\\" in her diaries. They corresponded with one another as late as the First World War. After Xenia and Alexander admitted the affairs to each other, their marriage began to fall apart. Though still loving each other, they began sleeping in separate rooms and living separate lives.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.xix Prior to the Revolution, Alexander had become disenchanted with the course of events in Russia and court life. Both he and Xenia spent considerable periods of time outside Russia;, but both returned before the start of the First World War. Following the Revolution, they separated and managed to escape Russia. Family relations Xenia had a close relationship with her brother Nicholas II and his wife before they married. When Nicholas and Alexandra moved into the Alexander Palace after their own marriage, Xenia and Alexander (known in the family as \\"Sandro\\") spent the evenings together in the new billiard room.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.45 A source of gradual resentment grew between Xenia and Alexandra due to the fact that Xenia had given birth to six healthy sons, whilst Alexandra had four daughters and her only son, Alexei Nikolaevich, was diagnosed with haemophilia. The robust health of Xenia's sons was a constant source of antagonism in the mind of Alexandra. It was only in 1912 that Xenia learnt from her sister Olga that Alix had admitted that Alexei had haemophilia.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.77 The birth of Alexei led to Alexandra obtaining total control over her husband;Van der Kiste and Hall, p.57 Trying to find a cure for her son's illness, Alexandra fell under the influence of Rasputin. Like all her family, Xenia was highly skeptical of Rasputin.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.76 Family relations were strained. Xenia did remain close to her brother, who often visited when he was in the Crimea, walking with her nieces, Olga and Tatiana; her sister- in-law visited rarely.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.77-78 Apart from Nicholas, Xenia was devoted to her other two brothers, Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia and Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich. In 1899, George died from tuberculosis and his death, although expected, was traumatic. Grand Duke Michael married without the permission of the Tsar, Natasha Sergeyevna Wulfert. The couple were exiled as punishment. Xenia was willing to overlook this, as her own marital problems had made her more understanding.Van der Kiste and Hall, p.79 She received both Michael and Natalia in 1913 in Cannes in France. Xenia tried to talk to her brother Nicholas about Michael and was told that he could return to Russia at any time, but that Natalia could not. Xenia helped to restore relations between Michael and their mother, the Dowager Empress. Ancestry References =Sources= * Korneva, Galina; Tatiana Cheboksarova (2006).

History The Eagles first fielded a team in the 1986/87 season, which was the second year of competitive Gridiron in South Australia. The Eagles burst onto the scene with a 14‚Äì12 win over the Port Adelaide Spartans. On the way to a berth in the play-offs, they scored a historic 54‚Äì0 win over the Southern Long Horns (now known and the Southern District Oilers). During the 1990s the club struggled with a shortage of players, coaches and general support. Although they had limited on-field success, the Eagles maintained their competitive spirit and strong sense of pride. The 2000/01 season was the beginning of a period of re-building for the Eagles. The player roster was boosted by the recruitment of a number of experienced players from other clubs, talented rookies, and significantly, some players from the USA. One of these players, Lloyd Gubler returned to play and coach for three consecutive seasons. In 2001/02 the Eagles had a record number of registered players for any one team in the league. They made it into the play-offs and 13 Eagles players were selected for the All Star teams. The club also saw the return of Eagles Cheerleaders and a growing number of sponsors and supporters. Although the 2003/04 season wasn't the best for on field performance, the Eagles were still one of the strongest clubs in the league for player numbers and growing strength in supporters. With their strong presence around the league they had many of our players represent the state at the National Championships held in Adelaide.

Tunnbr√∂d can be soft or crisp, and comes in many variants depending on choice of grain, leavening agent (or lack thereof) and rolling pin. The dough is made from any combination of wheat, barley and rye; the leavening agent can be both yeast and ammonium carbonate. Soft tunnbr√∂d is commonly used like a cr√™pe or tortilla as a wrap for other food. A popular fast food dish is soft tunnbr√∂d rolled around mashed potatoes and a hot dog, known as tunnbr√∂d roll (tunnbr√∂dsrulle). Another traditional old Swedish method of eating soft tunnbr√∂d is burrito-style, combined with mashed potatoes and roasted herring. Traditionally, tunnbr√∂d is eaten with fermented herring (surstr√∂mming) and as dip in the pot (dopp i grytan). A spiced soft bread is generally used for this, and the bread is soaked in the stock left from cooking the Christmas ham. Crisp tunnbr√∂d differs from kn√§ckebr√∂d (crispbread) in being thinner and more compact, containing fewer air bubbles. The consistency and taste of tunnbr√∂d can vary a lot, as recipes and preparation of the bread differ depending on the bakery.

It was set at the heart of the South Yorkshire Coalfield, at Wath- upon-Dearne, approximately halfway between Barnsley and Doncaster, in the United Kingdom. It opened in 1907 and closed in 1988. History The idea of a yard for the concentration of coal traffic developed following a visit by the Great Central Railway's General Manager, Sam Fay (later Sir Sam Fay) to the United States. It was built by Logan and Hemingway, a contractor regularly used by the Great Central Railway and the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway before them, and opened in August 1907. At this time a significant amount of rail-borne coal traffic was wagon-load. Customers would order coal direct from individual collieries, which would utilise the railways to deliver the coal in the colliery's own four-wheel wagons that usually carried between 12 and 16 tons of coal. These customers could be anything from a domestic coal merchant ordering a single wagon of coal to be delivered to a station goods yard for local delivery, up to rail-connected industry that would consume many thousands of tons of coal a month. All this generated a very complex pattern of rail traffic from the 45 collieries that were working within a ten-mile radius of Wath. The purpose of the yard was to make this traffic more efficient by concentrating the marshalling of the wagons of coal from the local collieries in a central position. Coal wagons were \\"tripped\\" in local trains from each colliery to the yard, then sorted into longer distance trains which would deliver to a marshalling yard near the customer, from where the wagons would again be re-sorted into new local \\"trip\\" trains that delivered the wagons to their individual destinations. Throughout its lifetime, the yard handled loaded and empty coal and coke wagons almost to the exclusion of other traffic. Many trains were sent over the Woodhead Line to a yard at Mottram, near Manchester, where they were divided for distribution throughout the North-West. Another major destination for the coal traffic was the steam trawler bunkering sidings at New Clee, near Grimsby, and after 1912 export coal was sent via the new dock facilities at Immingham. The temporary nationalisation of the coal industry during the hostilities of World War 2, leading to full nationalisation in 1947, led to an end to the system of individual collieries selling direct to individual end customers, however different collieries produced different grades of coal, and domestic and industrial customers were still dotted at many locations throughout the country, and so Wath Yard was still needed to efficiently manage the coal traffic flows from the area. This was so much so, that in the early 1950s, the yard became one of the eastern ends of the Manchester-Sheffield-Wath electric railway, over the Woodhead route. A prime justification of this scheme was the heavy coal flows from Wath up the steep grades over the Pennines. By the 1970s, the energy requirements of Britain's households and industry had changed. The Clean Air Act and North Sea gas meant that the number of domestic users of coal was dwindling, industry was now powered by electricity, and the centralisation of the power industry under the Central Electricity Generating Board meant that power was generated in a new fleet of large power stations rather small municipal generators. The remaining coal traffic was block-train rather than wagon-load and consequently did not require much marshalling: the coming of Merry-go-round trains for coal that travelled from colliery or dock to power station in a continuous cycle further reduced this need. In 1981 the Woodhead route and the associated electrification system closed. Wath Yard was busy with coal trains for a few more years, but the impending closure of many of the remaining local collieries after the 1984-85 miners' strike resulted in a sudden decline. The western exit to Wombwell and Barnsley was lifted in 1986. The yard finally closed and was lifted in 1988 with the closure of the last of the local collieries. The whole site of the yard was cleared in stages in the mid-1990s and is now an area of office, light industry and residential developments set around a lake which forms the Old Moor Wetland Centre RSPB reserve. When visiting today it is very difficult to detect that the area was once a large and busy railway marshalling yard. The yard The yard was set to the south of the main line from Doncaster and Barnsley. It was built on the 'hump' principle, where trains were uncoupled and then propelled over a hump, allowing the wagons to run by gravity into sidings to await collection. However unlike later hump yards it was built without automatic retarders to slow the rolling wagons down. Instead the yard employed human runners who chased the rolling wagons to pin down their hand brakes and control their movement through the sidings. This was a particularly hazardous occupation. With a total length of over 1¬º miles, between Wath Central railway station and Elsecar Junction, and with over 36 miles of track this was two yards in one: Eastbound traffic was received in 8 reception sidings feeding 31 departure sidings and controlled by \\"B\\" Box, whilst for westbound traffic there was a fan of 9 reception sidings, again feeding 31 departure sidings and controlled by \\"A\\" Box. The western entry/exit to the yard was under the control of Elsecar Junction signal box whilst the eastern end was controlled by Moor Road signal box, with additional control from the Wath Central signal box, which controlled the main lines through the yard and was situated by the station. The yard could handle as many as 5,000 wagons per day. The locomotive depot Initially the yard did not have major locomotive stabling facilities: locomotives were provided by Mexborough shed. With the coming of the electrification a two-road engine shed was built to the North of the yard adjacent to the Moor Lane Bridge to stable the new electric locomotives. In 1963 the replacement of steam with diesel locomotives on the non-electrified lines in the area resulted in the closure of Mexborough shed: a small diesel depot was built on the site of the old turntable in the centre of Wath yard, although diesel locomotives were also stabled at the electric locomotive shed. This shed closed in 1983, after then a shunter was provided as a trip from Tinsley until closure. After closure of the depot and yard, the locomotive shed was for a few years the home of a toxic waste processing company, which resulted in a local protest movement being formed. In a lane off Moor Road to the south of the yard was the 'power house', along with the Yard Master's and Inspectors Offices and the Yard Master's House. At the time of opening the points within the yard, controlled by \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" boxes, were controlled by electro-pneumatic power, this being extended to control points on the main line and signals. The compressed air was supplied from the 'power house' through a network of pipes running throughout the yard. Special locomotives GCR Class 8H in 1949 To operate the yard special, powerful, locomotives were needed and the GCR developed a large, three-cylinder, 0-8-4T tank locomotive, four of which were built by Beyer Peacock & Company, at Gorton Foundry, being delivered in December 1907 and January 1908. On delivery these were numbered 1170-1173, which in 1923 became L.N.E.R. 6170-6173. They were known as Wath Daisies, GCR Class 8H (LNER Class S1).

Such a rule traditionally consisted of three parts: *The event part specifies the signal that triggers the invocation of the rule *The condition part is a logical test that, if satisfied or evaluates to true, causes the action to be carried out *The action part consists of updates or invocations on the local data This structure was used by the early research in active databases which started to use the term ECA. Current state of the art ECA rule engines use many variations on rule structure. Also other features not considered by the early research is introduced, such as strategies for event selection into the event part. In a memory-based rule engine, the condition could be some tests on local data and actions could be updates to object attributes. In a database system, the condition could simply be a query to the database, with the result set (if not null) being passed to the action part for changes to the database. In either case, actions could also be calls to external programs or remote procedures. Note that for database usage, updates to the database are regarded as internal events. As a consequence, the execution of the action part of an active rule can match the event part of the same or another active rule, thus triggering it. The equivalent in a memory-based rule engine would be to invoke an external method that caused an external event to trigger another ECA rule. ECA rules can also be used in rule engines that use variants of the Rete algorithm for rule processing.

Arrow Classic Rock broadcasts on FM and is also receivable via cable, all nationwide. Owned by Ad Ossendrijver and Willem van Kooten, the station started broadcasts via all Dutch cablenetworks in 1996 and bought AM 828 from Veronica FM in 1998. In 2003 the frequencies of medium wave had been redistributed and the station moved to AM 675. In May 2007 Crosspoints BV, the company which produced Arrow Classic Rock and Arrow Jazz FM bought Caz! to use their FM frequencies. On 31 January 2008 they ceased their AM transmissions, transmitting an announcement in English advising their move to FM and to use the web stream. Three evenings a week, a variety of program specials can be heard. On Monday Liselotte Hegt presents the program Arrow High Voltage! (Metal/hard rock), on Tuesday Arie Verstegen presented Symphonic Mania! (Symphonic rock) and Wednesday to hear the Bluesbox Gerry Jungen. The station can be received via DAB+, cable, DVB and the Internet. 220px Once a year the station organizes Arrow Rock Festival, one of the largest rock festivals in the Netherlands with dozens of big-name bands playing every year. Aerosmith performed at Arrow Rock Festival 2007 along with Scorpions and Europe. In 2008, Kiss headlined the festival. Arrow also contributes to the newly founded Pinkpop Classic rock festival, to be held August 2007 featuring the performance of Status Quo, among others. In October Arrow has Rocktober which is in the spirit of Rock, that includes: *The sympho-25 (the 25 best sympho- rock songs) *The blues top 50 *The album top 100 of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s *The best guitar player, singer, bass player and drummer *The Arrow rock 500 *British Invasion *Rock in Waterland History Ad Ossendrijver and Willem van Kooten started in autumn 1996 with Arrow Classic Rock Radio. The station sent non-stop rock music 24-hours a day via the cable. The philosophy was: first money, then attract DJs. On April 1, 1997 the broadcasting frequencies would be distributed. This was different. Only in 2003 the Dutch government passed after numerous legal procedures to divide FM frequencies. On January 15, 1998 stopped Hitradio Veronica with broadcast via the medium. Arrow Classic Rock Radio took one of its frequencies over 828 kHz broadcast from Heinenoord. This could be achieved largely by Netherlands over the air. Later that year launched presented programs in the evenings. Gerry Jungen moved from the VARA to Arrow Classic Rock. Ren√© van den Abeele, which at Radio Noordzee Nationaal three years Rock from Holland had compiled and presented, adopted in February 1998 Classic Album Special on. He took care of the weekly program editing and presentation. He was also responsible for the editing of the weekly Rolling Stones Special which was presented by Luc van Rooij. Later, Harry de Winter (1999) and Kees Baars (2001) also place behind the Arrow microphone. In May 2003 were the Dutch broadcasting frequencies really divided. In addition, Arrow Classic Rock offered a normal - recoup - amount to different FM frequency plots. They fell by their real bidding on the lots by the wayside because other parties offered much higher amounts. Thus, the transmitter was no airwave frequency. Soon, a deal was signed with Quality Radio, owner of AM 675 which Arrow Classic Rock still came into the ether. In early 2004 the company began behind Arrow Classic Rock FM sister station called Arrow Jazz FM. The retirement benefit \\"Jazz\\" FM land was not divided in May 2003 and in November 2003 was still Van Kooten and Ossendrijver won. In 2006 PCM joined as a shareholder to the Arrow Media Group and was pursued cross media. This was not really a success, and Ad Ossendrijver bought all the shares and independently with Arrow Classic Rock and Arrow Jazz FM continued, operated by Cross Point BV. On 1 July 2007 the company CrossPoints BV Ad Ossendrijver took the ether frequencies of Caz! over by SBS Broadcasting and placed directly on the Arrow Classic Rock FM frequencies. The AM675 was done by early 2008 on Radio Maria. In May and June 2008 Arrow began testing Arrow Talks at 828 kHz, 362 m. But it remained only a test. On 10 July 2008, the Arrow radio group put the radio station Caz! temporarily in the area of the AM frequencies 828 kHz, 362 m. From 2003 to 2008, it has organized the annual Arrow Rock Festival. In October, Arrow dominated by Rocktober, meaning that the Arrow Rock 500 and other Top X tables are turned in the sign of symphonic rock, metal and blues. FM closure In February 2009, Crosspoints BV was ordered by the Radiocommunications Agency to cease Arrow Classic Rock broadcasting on the FM frequencies across the Netherlands by March 11 after a dispute about licence fees. Because of the financial crisis Crosspoints BV was not longer able to pay millions for licence fees to the Dutch government for the distribution of a special interest music station. After FM-distribution stopped, Arrow Classic Rock was still broadcasting via all Dutch cable networks, online and on AM 828 kHz 24 hours a day. On 5 May 2009 Crosspoints switched off also the AM-transmitter because only a limited number of listeners could be reached.Flux Media Factory neem Arrow Classic Rock en Arrow Jazz FM over  oranjemuziek.nl Programs At the time of Arrow Classic Rock on the FM were told several presented programs on the channel.

He signed the University Matriculation Register 1856/7 as of Stamford. He married in 1858 and lived at Mary Cottage in the suburb of Trinity in the north of Edinburgh. His wife died in childbirth in March 1861 and Frederick Thomas remarried to Elizabeth Cropley from Ely, Cambridgeshire in August 1861 with whom he raised a family of five children, living successively in Cumin Place, Eton Terrace, Egremont House in Dick Place which he built for himself. His family comprised Ernest born 1864, architect, died during the First World War, Maud Elizabeth, a miniaturist; Ethel Mary; Mabel Jane; and Frederick Percy, born 1874.

In Edinburgh, Pilkington concentrated on churches for the Free Church of Scotland, where worship focused not on a nave and altar, but on the pulpit and the \\"Word of God\\". Pilkington developed a new style of church building which accorded with the fashionable Gothic style but was adapted for the worship needs of the Free Church of Scotland. In 1867 he went into partnership with John Murray Bell (1839-1877) to form Pilkington & Bell, Bell providing the structural know-how, Pilkington providing the design flair. Pilkington adhered closely to Ruskin's principals, and in the High Victorian tradition which they promoted he evolved a highly personal style by mixing northern medieval elements with those from the Gothic architecture of Northern Italy as published by Ruskin and George, Edmund Street. His work featured polychrome stone, chunky rustication and lavish external carving of Venetian medieval buildings combined with French rose windows, decorated tracery, high-pitched roofs and deep, rain-conscious porches.

It is one of the Indian Parliamentary Constituencies and a Vidhan Sabha constituency.Election Commission of India  Overview  Chimur is a tehsil of Chandrapur district in Maharashtra, India, with a population of about 170,000.2011 Indian Census There are offices and a municipality of the Tehsildar, SDO, and Panchayat Samiti. Chimur can be reached by road from Warora, which is also the nearest railway station on the Wardha-Ballarpur-Hyderabad link. From Warora, it is and from Chandrapur. A regular bus service runs between Chimur and Nagpur, which is away. Chimur also has a large market because it is so apart from other towns and cities. Chimur doesn't have much education, it has English and Marathi medium schools and people can graduate in two Gownvana University colleges. Chimur is also the center place from Wardha, Chandrapur, Gondiya, Bhandara, Gadchiroli, and Nagpur. It is about from all these district places.  Historical background  =Chimur Kranti= Chimur is famous for its active participation in the Indian Freedom Struggle during the Quit India Movement of 1942. Rashtrasant Tukdoji Maharaj was doing Sadhna in Gufa Godhula (Canopy) near Chimur during the early days of his life. A close associate of Mahatma Gandhi, Professor Bhansali, who has established an Ashram at Takali in Saoner taluka of Nagpur district, also spent substantial time in Chimur during the Quit India Movement. Many people participated in the satyagraha during the Quit India Movement. During the Quit India Movement, Balaji Raipurkar and Babulal Zire were killed when the British troops opened fire on the satyagrahis. Following this incident, The Government Rest House at Chimur was burnt down by an angry mob in which the Subdivisional officer, Tehmuras Darashaw Doongaji, was killed along with Jarasand some other police officers. This incident occurred on August 16, 1942, on Nagpachmi thithi, therefore, there is a Nag statue as smarak. After this incident, for about 3 days, there was no British rule and the Indian flag was raised. The news was broadcast on Barlin Radio that there was no British rule in Chimur, as the troops were not able to reach Chimur due to the various roadblocks set up by the freedom fighters. Following this incident, the British government cracked down heavily on the freedom fighters and the people of Chimur. The British troops committed severe atrocities on the satyagrahis. Five satyagrahis were sentenced to death by Baburao Bhope to be hanged by the British government for their role in the 1942 freedom struggle. Professor Bhansali undertook a fast unto death to prevail upon the British government to stop their atrocities in Chimur. He also helped people to buy houses that were auctioned by the British government for non-payment of taxes and fines. Rashtrasant Tukdoji Maharaj also participated in the 1942 freedom struggle but left Chimur on the day of the burning down of the Government rest house. After independence, the Government of Independent India paid back to the people of Chimur, the taxes, and fines which had been forcibly and wrongly collected by the British government. Important places like the Dak bungalow, police station, schools, etc. were reconstructed by the government of independent India. =Balaji Raipurkar= Shri. Udhavrao Tukaram Korekar was born and brought up at Chimur. His father Shri. Tukaram Balaji Korekar had a poor family background. Udhavrao after completing his vernacular final, went on to get trained to become a teacher. He served as a teacher at Chimur for which he used to get Rs. 16 per month as salary. After only 3 years in service, Udhavrao jumped into the Indian Freedom Movement. He quit his job as a teacher and actively followed the Gandhian principles of satyagraha to oppose British rule. He played a key role as well from my Family late Krushnarao Bhope & Late Shrihari Bhope also in the \\"Jungle Satyagraha\\" and the Quit India Movement of 1942. For his role in the freedom struggle, he was tried and sentenced by the British Government to 35 years of imprisonment. His nephew Shri. Gopalrao Korekar was sentenced to death for his role in the freedom struggle. This death sentence was reduced to life imprisonment by the British Government. After India gained independence in 1947, both the sentences were terminated. Udhavrao was released from prison in 1947. He was an active member of the Indian National Congress. He was Chairman and member of Warora Janpad Sabha Education Committee. He was the founder of the Chimur Education Society. Presently, the Chimur Education Society runs 2 Junior Colleges and 3 high schools. Udhavrao Korekar was also the Chairman of the Chimur Gram Panchayat and a member of the Chandrapur Zilla Parishad. Along with Udhavrao Korekar Nanaji Siras (Anantrao Siras), Dada Naik (RSS head, Chimur), and Baburao Begde, Ramdas Rampura were also killed. In the freedom struggle, the British government fired shots at the protesters in which Balaji Raipurkar died and several leaders like Nanaji Siras were severely injured and later on put into jail for several years. However, in 1946 they were set free by paying 2000 Rs. Nanaji Siras lived in Chandrapur along with his family and son Mohan Siras. For his contribution to the Indian Independence struggle and for his role in the overall development of Chimur, the Indian Prime Minister Shri. P. V. Narsimha Rao personally honored and publicly felicitated Udhavrao Korekar during his visit to Chimur in 1993. Udhavrao Korekar breathed his last breath on 24 May 1995 in Pune.

Prof. Bhansali Mahararaj took 63 fast at his home, who is one of the Gandhijee followers. Both are active members of congress.  Ghodayatra  There is a Balaji temple in Chimur which is more than 395 years old. This temple was constructed during the Bhosale reign. The idol in this temple is a unique one, having laxmi at its feet. This temple is famous for the \\"Ghodayatra\\" which begins as per the Hindu calendar on Magh Shuddha Trayodashi.

Kranti Jilha Movement = Chimur Kranti: A Village Rises to the ‚ÄòQuit India‚Äô Call = Amit Bhagat \\\\----Chimur, located 90 km from Nagpur in Chandrapur district of Maharashtra, is a nondescript village today. But it made national news in August 1942 with the kranti (revolution) that took place here during the Quit India Movement. The revolt lasted just three days but it reverberated through the hearts of all Indians and gave Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs ‚ÄòQuit India‚Äô call a powerful impetus ‚Äì albeit at a terrible cost to the villagers. In the early 20th century, Chimur was a large village surrounded by dense forests. It was also an important political centre during the reign of the Bhonsla Rajas of Nagpur in the 18th-19th century. It was home to well-to-do families of Maratha Sardars ‚Äì the Naiks and Begdes ‚Äì who owned huge ancestral wadas or homes and who were closely associated with the court of the Bhonsla Rajas. Owing to its fairly advanced political thought and proximity to Nagpur, Chimur became a politically active centre for the Congress, Hindu Mahasabha and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. It is little wonder that this village rose in revolt against the British Raj after the arrest of national leaders on 8th August 1942. Quit India Resolution passed on 8th August 1942 at Gowalia Tank MaidanWikimedia Commons It was on this historic day that Mahatma Gandhi raised the ‚ÄôQuit India' slogan from Bombay‚Äôs Gowalia Tank Maidan, an announcement that had powerful repercussions across the country. The British government responded by freezing the Congress‚Äôs assets and arresting most of its leaders, including Gandhi and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. The press was totally muzzled. Following the arrest of prominent Congress leaders, the country was effectively leaderless. There was widespread violence across the nation as a protest against the British government's oppressive measures. Violence also shook many places in the Central Provinces and Berar, which had been a centre of political revolt and mass rebellion since the Revolt of 1857. The region witnessed political uprisings and massive campaigns in various places like Chimur, Ashti, Yaoli, Ramtek and Nagpur. Demonstration at Mumbai during Quit India movement, August 1942Wikimedia Commons The trigger of the Chimur Revolt was a call from Sant Tukdoji Maharaj, a revered spiritual leader from Vidarbha, on the night of 15th August 1942. He performed a ‚ÄòKhanjari Bhajan‚Äô (a devotional song sung using an instrument Khanjira) in Chimur and urged the people to demonstrate their patriotic fervour in these difficult times. The very next day, on 16th August 1942, exactly a week after Gandhi's arrest, riots broke out in Chimur. The police opened fire on a public demonstration organised to protest the arrest of Congress leaders. They continued to fire till they had exhausted their ammunition. Many lost their lives, many more were injured. Enraged, the public attacked the police, killing a Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Circle Inspector, Naib Tahsildar and a Police Constable. Ten forest depots were set on fire. Some unarmed policemen were also thrashed by the mob. Others were humiliated by having their uniforms burnt and being compelled to wear Gandhi caps and carry Congress flags in processions. The agitated mob also demolished a road bridge leading to Chimur, thereby severing possible means of communication with the village. When the District Magistrate K N Subramaniam got news of what had happened in Chimur, he reported it to the Provincial Government, saying the rebellion could not be quelled without the help of the army. Thus, on 19th August, a special train with 200 European soldiers and 50 Indian constables arrived at Wardha, 100 km north-west of Chimur. The soldiers and sepoys barged into homes in Chimur and unleashed unspeakable atrocities on the people. \\\\---- > They thrashed men and boys, destroyed household goods and furniture, and > raped women, young and old. \\\\----These were the means used to suppress the popular uprising. The Government, after ruthlessly quelling the riots, arrested and detained around 400 men. Despite the threats and bayonets of the police and the military, an old woman in the village, Dadibai Begde, managed to urge the District Magistrate K N Subramaniam to show some mercy. He gave in and ordered the military to stop the violence. The rampage, rape and pillage in Chimur stopped but the people lived in mortal fear until 26th August, when the military finally left the town. Daily Record Newspaper - Glasgow, UK (Saturday 22nd August 1942)Author A collective fine of Rs 1 lakh was imposed on Chimur and almost all the men who were held responsible were put behind bars. The long and painful process of investigation of the people‚Äôs ‚Äòcrimes‚Äô followed, causing untold hardship to the villagers. In the last week of August 1942, the Bar Association of Chanda district, of which Chimur was a part, passed a resolution demanding an inquiry into the Chimur atrocities and sent it to the government. Their demand was not only turned it down, but the authorities also refused to lift the restrictions on the town. Photograph taken at Chimur by Deputy Commissioner of Chanda District on the 23rd & 25th August 1942National Archives of India The Nation is Shocked Women rights activists from Nagpur ‚Äì Vimlabai Deshpande, Dwarkabai Deoskar, Vimal Abhyankar, Ramabai Tambe and Durgabai Wazalwar ‚Äì visited Chimur on 19th September and conducted an inquiry into the atrocities on the women of Chimur by conducting a ‚Äòlane-to-lane‚Äô survey of the village. They revealed the ghastly nature of the crimes committed by the military and, as word spread, political leaders in Nagpur were furious. Hindu Mahasabha leader Dr B S Moonje and his associate and activist Mr M N Ghatate visited Chimur on 25th September and inquired into the incidents that had taken place the month before. They placed their findings before the Government and requested it to conduct an inquiry into them. Instead, the Government of the Central Provinces and Berar issued a lengthy statement on 16th October, saying that all the complaints about Chimur were fictitious and the women of Chimur had deliberately made up these accusations to defame the army. But the political leaders were determined not to give up. Usha Mehta, a Gandhian and freedom fighter who ran an underground radio station in Bombay called Secret Congress Radio, broadcast the news of the rape of the women at Chimur, on 28th October. The news shook the nation and was subsequently broadcast by the Azad Hind Radio of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose from Berlin. Red-faced and left with no defence, the Government of Central Provinces and Berar clamped down further, and banned the publication of any news about Chimur under the Defence of India Rules. This made it virtually impossible to get any justice for the people of Chimur and the victims of the atrocities. The October communiqu√© of the CP and Berar Government tried to dispose of the complaints in the gross, while the New Year communique tried to dispose of the complaints by defaming the complainants, one by one. Photograph taken at Chimur by Deputy Commissioner of Chanda District on the 23rd & 25th August 1942National Archives of India Professor Bhansali‚Äôs Fast The Chimur case gained greater public attention when Professor J P Bhansali, a close disciple of Gandhi, went on an indefinite fast at the Wardha residence of industrialist, Gandhian and freedom fighter, Jamnalal Bajaj. Bhansali demanded an impartial inquiry into the excesses committed by soldirs in Chimur. In response, the government further tightened restrictions on the press, banning not only news or mention of Bhansali but even any reference to it. The press in India declared a one-day strike by suspending all publications on 6th January 1943, to protest the Government's despotic order. A few days later, a settlement was reached between the CP Government and Bhansali, who was at the time on the 63rd day of his fast. Bhansali broke his fast on 12th January 1943, and the very next day, the CP Government according to the terms of the settlement, lifted the ban on newspapers writing about Chimur and allowed activists and journalists to visit the village. The CP Government also promised to ‚Äòrespect the dignity of women and protect them from any kind of molestation‚Äô. In July 1943, Dr M S Aney, a political leader from Vidarbha and also a member of the Viceroy's Executive Council, paid a visit to Chimur along with Bhansali. Headlines in The Bombay Chronicle, 11 April 1945 (page 1)Author Chimur Trials After sustained protests across India, a commission was finally appointed to investigate the case. The inquiries made by the government revealed that 13 women had been raped, some of them by more than one European. Four minor girls had also been sexually assaulted. Women were robbed of all their jewellery and other possessions. The wife of the sarpanch or village head, who was pregnant, had also been raped. The 400-odd people detained in Chimur were charged with violence and put on trial, and pleading on behalf of them were renowned activist-lawyers like K M Munshi, Balvantrao Deshmukh, Madhavrao Chendke, Ramchandra Siras, Raghunath Dewaikar, Dadaji Kovale and Baba Amte. In the end, death sentences were awarded to 29 people, 43 were sentenced to life imprisonment while several others suffered rigorous imprisonment and fined. Lakhs of people across India signed a joint statement, urging the Government to commute the death sentences of the Ashti-Chimur accused. Among the prominent petitioners were members of the Congress, Muslim League, Communist Party, trade unions, workers unions, women‚Äôs organisaitons, student federations, Sikh organisations, Muslim organisations, journalists, doctors, writers, artists, businessmen, etc. Coverage on the Chimur trials in Amrita Bazar Patrika - Northern India Edition, 5th April 1945Author Of the 29 people awarded the death sentence, 14 had their sentenced commuted to life imprisonment. Finally, on 29th January 1945, the Central Provinces Government commuted the death sentences of eight of the 15, to life imprisonment and sent them to the Nagpur prison. On 3rd April 1945, Gandhi issued a statement against the death sentences in the Chimur case, asking all Indians to make a united demand for the commutation of the death sentences of the remaining seven accused. Gandhi‚Äôs appeal received a spontaneous response from the working class of Bombay. A mass rally was held at Kamgar Maidan in Parel in Bombay, where around 1.5 lakh workmen of the Girni Kamgar Union, Railway and Tramway Union and BEST Workers' Union came out in protest. Together, they staged one of the biggest protests in the history of Bombay, marking 3rd April 1945 as ‚ÄòChimur Day‚Äô. To shouts of ‚ÄúCommute the death sentences,‚Äù a resolution was passed condemning the death sentences and demanding that they be commuted. On 9th April, Gandhi wrote a letter to Bhulabhai Desai, a prominent and influential Congress leader, expressing his concern over the Chimur's issue, saying, \\"If the prisoners of Chimur are hanged, how can we hope to form a nationalist government?\\" Gandhi requested him to \\"try to get something done with the agreement of the Muslim League, while the prisoners are still alive\\". In the meantime, the British Crown, which then governed India, rejected the mercy petition on 31st March 1945. Gandhi issued a statement to the press in Bombay that same day, calling it ‚Äúa cold-blooded, calculated murder as it will be done ceremoniously and under the name of so-called law, which will leave behind nothing but a great increase in the already existing woeful bitterness‚Äù. Martyrs of Chimur RevoltAuthor Death Sentences Commuted Following the Chimur trials, a Capital Punishment Relief Society (CPRS) had been set up on 7th February 1943 in Nagpur, to help the families of those given the death sentence in the Chimur and Ashti case. Dr N B Khare, first premier of CP and Berar in 1937, was its founder-president and its founder members were: G T Madkholkar, Veer Harakare, Advocate Rambhau Manohar, Advocate P K Tare, E S Patwardhan and A N Udhoji. It was formed to also help the accused who were not able to defend themselves. In May 1943, Dr N B Khare was appointed as a member of the Viceroy‚Äôs Executive Council, in lieu of which he had to step down from the presidency of the CPRS. Anasuyabai Kale, former Deputy Speaker of the Central Provinces Legislative Assembly, then became the president of the CPRS. Towards the end of 1943, the Society appealed in the Nagpur (Bombay) High Court on behalf of the Chimur accused, against the capital punishment awarded to them in the lower court. When the High Court dismissed their appeal, they preferred an appeal before the Privy Council in England. But that too was refused in December 1944. Therefore, to put off the day on which the death sentences were to be executed, they submitted a mercy petition to the British Crown, King George VI, on behalf of the Chimur accused. In this connection, Anasuyabai Kale, president of the CPRS, visited Delhi to meet the private secretary to the Viceroy of India. But even before the mercy petition was decided, the CP Government fixed the date of execution as 5th April 1945. Upon learning this, Dr N B Khare intervened and was successful in getting the date postponed. Later, Kale‚Äôs tireless efforts bore fruit when the King of England himself commuted the sentences of the seven persons on death row on 16th August 1945, to life imprisonment. The news was announced publicly and these men ‚Äì Gopalrao Korekar, Vinayak Bhope, Ganpati Channe, Domaji Kote, Baburao Kote, Dadaji Kirimkar and Dadaji Tannirwar ‚Äì came to be known as the ‚ÄòSeven Immortals‚Äô or ‚ÄòSaptarshi‚Äô (Seven Rishis) of Chimur Kranti. Martyr‚Äôs Memorial in Chimur VillageAuthor To mark the pivotal role played by Chimur in the freedom struggle and the heavy price paid by its villagers, a martyr's memorial was erected in Chimur and a ‚ÄòShahid Library‚Äô opened in memory of the martyrs. Every year since India‚Äôs Independence, 16th August is celebrated as ‚ÄòKranti Diwas‚Äô in Chimur, a tribute to its fearless freedom fighters and to the unforgettable memory of their glorious revolution. \\\\---- > ABOUT THE AUTHOR \\\\----Amit Bhagat is an independent researcher.

French Colonial describes several styles of architecture used by the French during colonization. Many former French colonies, especially those in Southeast Asia, have previously been reluctant to promote their colonial architecture as an asset for tourism; however, in recent times, the new generation of local authorities has somewhat \\"embraced\\" the architecture and advertise it.http://www.eng.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/abouthcmcity/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?CategoryId=10&ItemID;=5440&PublishedDate;=2005-03-13T11:19:09Z/ French Colonial architecture has a long history, beginning in North America in 1604 and being most active in the Western Hemisphere (Caribbean, Guiana, Canada, Louisiana) until the 19th century, when the French turned their attention more to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. In Canada French settlements in Canada date back to the mid-16th century until the French defeat in Seven Years' War where New France was annexed by the British Crown after the Treaty of Paris (1763). The settlements in the regions were extensive, hence the abundant architectural legacy from that period shows itself particularly in Quebec City but also in the city of Montreal, which has a significant Canadien population. Most buildings constructed during the French colonial period utilized a heavy timber frame of logs installed vertically on a sill, poteaux-sur-sol, or into the earth, poteaux-en-terre. An infill of lime mortar or clay mixed with small stones (pierrotage) or a mixture of mud, moss, and animal hair (bousillage) was used to pack between the logs. Many times the infill would later be replaced with brick. This method of construction was used in the Illinois Country as well as Louisiana. General characteristics of a French Colonial dwelling included a raised basement which would support the floor of the home's primary living quarters. Exterior stairs were another common element; the stairs would often climb up to a distinctive, full-length veranda or \\"gallery,\\" on a home's fa√ßade. The roof over the veranda was normally part of the overall roof. French Colonial roofs were either a steep hipped roof, with a dormer or dormers, or a side- gabled roof. The veranda or gallery was often accessed via French doors. French Colonial homes in the American South commonly had stuccoed exterior walls.Bigolin, Steve. \\"The Landmarks of Barb City\\", Daily Chronicle, 28 February 2005. Retrieved 15 February 2007.

The other styles were Colonial Georgian, Dutch Colonial, and Spanish Colonial. French Colonial developed in the settlements of the Illinois Country and French Louisiana.

Most of them are located in the larger cities: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Phnom Penh. Hanoi, as the capital of Indochina during the main growing period from 1902 to 1954, possesses the majority of French Colonial buildings in the region. The French also built many public buildings in all the cities and many towns, and many are still in use.

Early life and family His family, House of Dipsheu of the Circassian people, was originally from Ubykhia province of Circassia, who were exiled to Ottoman Empire in the 1860s. He was born in Emre village of Bandƒ±rma as the son of Psheu Ali Bey. One of his brothers was a Member of Parliament for Saruhan (present-day Manisa) in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey's first legislative term and previously in the fourth term of the Chamber of Deputies of the Ottoman Empire. His other brother was a senior military officer who graduated from the Turkish Military Academy in 1902. Ethem the Circassian had blond hair, light blue eyes, and very pale skin, as described by Halide Edip Adƒ±var. He stood at 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in) tall. Education and military career He ran from home when he was 14 years old to join Bakƒ±rk√∂y Cavalry Junior Officer School. He joined the Balkan War and was wounded on the Bulgarian front. As a result, he was awarded with honours and seniority allowance. Later he joined Te≈ükilat-ƒ± Mahsusa organized by E≈üref Ku≈ü√ßuba≈üƒ± and participated in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq during World War I. He was again wounded and retired to his village. For a while he took up banditry in the mountains. He then founded Kuv√¢-yi Seyy√¢re which was the only organized military force in Anatolia during 1919‚Äì1920, period between the Armistice of Mudros and the Treaty of S√®vres. He coordinated his military operations with Ali Fuat Pa≈üa in Ankara and harassed the invading Greek armies with his fast cavalry. He was instrumental in putting down various rebellions against the authority of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. Eventually he had a disagreement with the ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º government in Ankara, refusing to join his forces with the regular army established under the command of ƒ∞n√∂n√º Pa≈üa. Newly reconstituted Turkish Army had to put down the situation whilst also fighting the Greeks at First Battle of ƒ∞n√∂n√º. His alleged subsequent surrender to and cooperation (disputed by historians in Turkey until his restoration of honour) with the Greek army resulted in his citizenship getting revoked on the grounds of treason and his being announced a persona non grata by the TBMM, amongst many others. From Greece, he went to Jordan and settled there. =Cooperation with Atat√ºrk= √áerkes Ethem was an ally of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk who appreciated him for his successful fight against invading armies and bandits in different regions of Turkey. Atat√ºrk awarded Ethem the Circassian with the title of Mill√Æ Kahraman (Turkish: National Hero). In her 1928 work The Turkish Ordeal, the leading Ottoman female novelist and nationalist Halide Edip Adƒ±var mentions the first time she saw Ethem the Circassian and how well he was treated by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk in addition to describing Ethem Bey's physical appearance as the following: Death and burial Ethem Bey died on 21 September 1948 near River Jordan in Amman, Jordan.

There are many stone Menhirs in the western part of the town at hill base. Around 12 can be seen in rows. Young researcher Amit Bhagat has recently discovered around hundreds of menhirs at Dongargaon, Navkhala, Kasarla & Korambi in the close proximity of Nagbhid.https://www.academia.edu/41605601/Recent_Discovery_of_Megalithic_Sites_in_Chandrapur_District_of_Maharashtra Some researchers have related them to the 3000-year-old megalithic custom of erecting a stone pillar at the burial place. But these stones need more research and preservation. A village called \\"Deotak\\" or Devtek is 2‚Äì3 km from Nagbhid, There was a stone slab containing two distinct inscriptions, the characters of one being of the kind known as those of the 'Ashoka' edicts and those of the other belonging to the 'Vakataka' period.

Death On February 13, 2007, Eliana Ramos was found dead at her grandparents' home in Montevideo, Uruguay, at age 18. Preliminary examinations indicated the cause of death as heart attack, believed to be related to malnutrition; final test results were released at a later date. Fellow models confirmed that she had suffered for many months after her sister Luisel Ramos, 22, died of heart failure, but rejected speculations that an eating disorder could have played a role. Her sister died shortly after stepping off a runway in August 2006 during a fashion show at a Montevideo hotel. An autopsy cited the cause of death as a heart attack. The deaths drew widespread media attention in Latin America, where the fashion industry's treatment of young women has been the subject of debate since anorexia was blamed for the deaths of model Ana Carolina Reston and three other Brazilian women in December.

This was the first time it was used as a brand name to describe a selection of artists who had studied under adjunct professor Timothy Persons at Aalto University School of Arts, Architecture and Design in Helsinki from the beginning of 1990s until now. It was based upon a Professional Studies program that used its academic platform to create an environment that blended its teachers, students and former graduates together in a contextual dialogue through group exhibitions, publications and the utilisation of the international art fairs as a means for teaching, referencing and presenting these artists‚Äô works to the international community. History Pentti Sammallahti and Arno Rafael Minkkinen were the original mentors who inspired the first generation of artists like Jorma Puranen, Ulla Jokisalo and Timo Kelaranta. The next generation would already be composed by artists like such as Jyrki Parantainen, Marjaana Kella, Pertti Kekarainen, Joakim Eskildsen, Ilkka Halso, Tiina Itkonen, Elina Brotherus, Aino Kannisto, Ola Kolehmainen, Janne Lehtinen, Sanna Kannisto and Riitta P√§iv√§l√§inen. The third generation: Sandra Kantanen, Ari Kakkinen, Niko Luoma, Santeri Tuori and Jari Silom√§ki. The fourth generation: Ville Lenkkeri, Anni Lepp√§l√§, Susanna Majuri, Mikko Sinervo, Nelli Palom√§ki, Milja Laurila, Niina Vatanen, Eeva Karhu. Fifth generation: Tanja Koljonen, Juuso Noronkoski, Mikko Rikala. Sixth generation: Ville Kumpulainen, Jaakko Kahilaniemi, Hilla Kurki, Rainer Paananen. Characteristics The Helsinki School follows other of two key photographic movements: The New American Color Photography which established color photography as an important artistic medium, beginning with the William Eggleston exhibition at the MoMA in New York in 1976. And the D√ºsseldorf School, which emerged in the late 1970s under the guidance of Bernd and Hilla Becher, followers of the 1920s German tradition of Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity). Their students, Andreas Gursky, Candida H√∂fer, Thomas Ruff and Thomas Struth modified the approach by applying new technical possibilities and contemporary vision. These movements combined with the influence of the Icelandic minimalism and artists like Donald Judd, played a pivotal role in understanding the roots of the Helsinki School. The Helsinki School was based upon a Professional Studies program that was unique in how it used its academic platform to create an environment that blended its teachers, students and former graduates together in a contextual dialogue through group exhibitions, publications and the utilisation of the international art fairs as a means for teaching, referencing and presenting these artists‚Äô works to the international community. It's grounded on an approach that introduces the students in how to use criticism as a positive tool. This places the emphasis more on how to find solutions rather than the fear of making mistakes. Due to financial restrictions, common to many universities, Aalto has conceived a system where students teach each other through their shared experiences. A good example of this is in Aalto‚Äôs intern program of sending selected students abroad to work in residencies, galleries and other professional platforms. Gallery Taik Persons (currently Persons Project) was conceived as the vehicle to join all these generations together. The gallery was established in 1995 in Helsinki, however, since 2005 its permanent exhibition space has been located in Berlin. Its primary responsibility is to prepare and guide the students in how to manage their professional life. =Defining traits= The Helsinki School‚Äôs defining trait is the use of the photographic process as a tool for conceptual thinking. It was founded in 1995 in Helsinki and is to this day directed by Adjunct Professor Timothy Persons, who also created Persons Projects (former Gallery Taik Persons) based in Berlin. \\"There is a clarity of vision that seems to come out of the late evening northern summer light. The conceptual base is lucidly presented. There is an honesty and sincerity behind the work that is rare to find among a group of artists, (‚Ä¶) the borderland discourse, which touches the very idea of identity. Many Helsinki School pictures bear signs of Finnish culture, unconscious or not, meanings related to nature and remoteness. This is quite natural in a country so sparsely populated. These photographs seem to be presentations of artists who sink with themselves.\\" His verdict diverges from mine, however, in that he says, \\"Their photographs seem to be covering something, preferably hiding and hinting than saying anything direct. Yes, there is ambiguity, yes there is a Northern loneliness, but it speaks very directly. There is a sense of isolation in the way several of the artists express their identity. Instead of direct contact with somebody in the picture, photographs became full of landscapes, empty spaces, and figures somewhere in distance.\\"Alistair Hicks, The Helsinki School Vol. 5 p. 22 Publications  The Helsinki School platform sustains a direct link to its former alumni by joining their works with each new generation of graduates through the publication of The Helsinki School books by Hatje Cantz, that is currently in its 6th volume.

Notable villages in this tehsil are Ladbori and Ramala. Nagpur, the nearest large city, is about away. Description The first Rice Research Center was established in Sindewahi, where various researchers work to discover new rice varieties. Gram Sewak Training Center is also in Sindewahi, one of only two in Maharashtra (the other is in Pune). Ghodazari Talaw and Asolamenda Talaw are picnic areas near Sindewahi. Asola Mendha is one of the biggest reservoirs in Maharashtra. Sindewahi City is surrounded by a forest in which tigers and other wild animals can be found. Ram Mandir is the oldest temple of sindewahi City near by wholesale market is situated. * Sindevahi * Sindevahi was once famous for jaggery, cloth, silk and much more. Some places have a history of thousands of years, some places are illuminated by forts and battles, while railways lead to industrial development. Today we will learn about a typical town in East Vidarbha where there are no big factories, forts or even a history of battles. But it was once famous all over the country. Sindevahi is a small town located on Nagpur-Nagbhid-Mul-Chandrapur State Highway No. 9 and Gondia-Nagbhid-Chanda Railway at a distance of 130 km from Nagpur and 70 km from Chandrapur. Even though it has recently become a Nagar Panchayat, it is a small town like any other taluka with a population of only 12,914 and a population of 15,000 to 20,000 by adding the surrounding settlements. The earliest mention of this village is found in the time of Vyankoji Bhosale (1788 AD), the grandson of the first Raghuji Raje Bhosale of Nagpur. Vyankoji was married to a girl from the Gujar family and gave cattle to Sindevahi as a gift to his nephew 'Gujabadada Gujar'. Later, Navloji Gujar, who lived in Nagpur during the British rule, was a cattle farmer here. However, there is no conclusive evidence as to which Shinde family the name Sindevahi came from or fell from a tree called Sindi. Earlier, the Sindewahi was a small village in Gadbori parish, 7 km from there. Gadbori, once a major pargana during the Gond and later Maratha rule, is now a neglected and remote village. In the past there were a large number of Telugu speaking weavers and Brahmins. But being within the main road and in the early British period only the name Pargana remained, all the settlements migrated to Sindevahi and other places. The Gond states gave shelter to the hardworking tribe 'Kohli' in Gadbori, Sindevahi, Navargaon area to build a lake. According to Hiralal and Russell's book, the Kohali people from chanda were very fond of sugarcane cultivation and built this fertile area with several lakes and made it famous as a 'jaggery depot'. Sugarcane, jaggery, paddy, textiles and a small amount of silk business made Sindewahi prosperous. But later, due to the economic imperialist policies of the British, the handloom business here, like other cities, came to a standstill. The population of Sindevahi, which had a population of 4569 in 1881, was reduced to 3951 by 1891 due to migration and drought. Due to two severe droughts and diseases in 1896 and 1899, the size of Sindevahi was halved in 1901 and only 2932 people remained, including more than half of the Telugu speakers. The Asola Mendha, Ghodazari and Naleshwar reservoirs were planned by the British government in the central province around 1905 to avert the damage caused by the previous drought and the resulting loss of life. At the same time in 1911 Nagpur-Nagbhid railway was brought to Rajoli and in 1913 Sindevahi was connected to Chandya. Then the police station at Talodhi was brought to Sindevahi and Talodhi had to wait for the next 100 years for the police station. Earlier, the British government had been monitoring jaggery production here since 1820 and for this they took over 150 acres of land in Sindevahi in the 1912-13 season and set up an 'Agriculture Farm' or today's 'Agricultural Research Center'. British officials were researching new varieties of sugarcane, cotton and rice here. At the same time, research was being done on entomology and soil. Sugarcane juice kilns have been used in this area for centuries to make jaggery. The British authorities made some changes in it and made it world famous by naming it 'Sindewahi furnace'. Not one or two but hundreds of dissertations have been published in the periodicals of that time. The low cost and low fuel jaggery kiln was initially compared to the Poona Furnace in the Pune area. Due to the relatively high benefits of Sindevahi Bhatti, it used to be demonstrated at all farmers' conventions across India. The comparative study of each new furnace used to be done with Sindevahi furnace. Sindevahi kilns were built for farmers in Madras, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. However, later due to mechanization, such kilns became obsolete. The discovery of a new variety of cotton called 'Sindevahi Cross' also started here. This species also became very famous. Until recently, even a rice variety called 'Sindevahi' was a special favorite of farmers. Sindevahi may be the only village in the country named after a sugarcane kiln, cotton and rice varieties. In 1922, Sir Frank Sly, the then Governor of Central Province, visited a research center in Ghodazari while hunting. All this research was done under the supervision of British officials when Sindevahi had no electricity. Electricity to Sindevahi, however, came much later on January 19, 1959. After independence, this agricultural research center was further developed by the Government of India as 'Gramsevak Training Center and Agricultural Research Center'. Even today, these centers are famous as a specialty of Sindevahi. Many may not know this but Sindewahi has also done research on malaria. Sindewahi was the first to experiment with 50% benzene hexachloride spraying, which was once used to control malaria. Today, however, this part is stuck in the grip of unemployment. The tragedy of this area is that not even a kilogram of jaggery is produced in the area which was once famous for jaggery kilns. It is hoped that the Gosikhurd Irrigation Project and the forthcoming Nagpur-Nagbhid broad gauge railway link to Nagpur may rekindle hopes for the region's prosperity. Let's hope that experimental farmers and enterprising youth will bring back the glory of Sindevahi. Transport Sindewahi railway station connects to Gondia - Balharshah Electric Broad Gauge Line. It is also connected to Mul, Chandrapur, Nagpur, Gondia, Bhandara, Nagbhid, and Bramhapuri by MSRTC buses and also connected to Hyderabad by TSRTC.

From the 17th century through to the 19th century, the Habsburg Monarchy, Austrian Empire, and Austro-Hungarian Empire made a few small short-lived attempts to expand colonial trade through the acquisition of factories. All attempts were ended due to international pressure, or lack of interest from the Imperial government and opposition from Hungarians high in the government. However, for a brief period, Austria's ruler also ruled Spain, which did have a large colonial empire. No other Austrians were involved when Emperor Charles V held the crown of both the Spanish Empire and Roman Empire.  Ostend East India Company  Share No. 4527 of the Ostend East India Company The Ostend East India Company was a private merchant company formed in 1715, based in the Southern Netherlands in what is now Flemish Belgium. No Austrians were involved. The only connection to Austria was that Emperor Charles VI controlled both the Southern Netherlands and Austria. The Emperor provided the company with 6 million guilders, as a public-private monopoly with 6000 shares, set a 1000 guilders each. Due to the speed of the Ostender's trade ships, the Company, within a couple of years became one of the largest trading firms in the East and Canton. By 1720, the Ostend Company had been transporting 7 million pounds of tea, which was about 41.78% of the tea traded from the Port of Canton. The private Ostend Company consisted of two Flemish brothers-in-law, Paulo Cloots and Jacomo de Pret, who formed a consortium with two Dutch merchant houses of De Bruyn and Geelhand; Cloots and de Pret also invited the two London houses of Hambly and Trehee, and the French baker Antoine Crozat to invest in the company. After seven years of profitable ventures, and much fighting between other merchants in Antwerp and Ghent, Charles VI agreed to its petition of official charter. In 1715, the Ostend Company acquired trading charters in the ports of Mocha, Surat, and Canton. In 1723, the Ostender's obtained trading ports in the lucrative harbors of Banquibazar and Cabelon. The trade missions to Mocha were initially successful, but due to the wreck of the Mochaman, a trade vessel headed to the Red Sea in 1720, and the capture of a home-bound vessel by the Barbary Pirates in 1723, Mocha eventually turned into a heavy loss. The ports of Surat and Canton however, continued to be quite profitable. All the profits went to Belgium and none to Austria. The company had become such a threat to British, Dutch, Portuguese, and French interests, that when Emperor Charles VI promulgated the edict of the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, it was refused international recognition on the grounds of Ostend Company's success in the East Indies. These International political pressures ended its extraordinary growth, and in 1727 the charter was suspended, leading to the company being dissolved by 1732. After the Imperial government's withdrawal of the Ostend Company's charter, the Great Powers accepted the Pragmatic Sanction. The suspension also allowed the Austrians to sign the Treaty of Vienna (1731) with the British; which allied both powers in the Anglo-Austrian Alliance. Bolts' book entitled Considerations on India(n) Affairs: Particularly Respecting the Present State of Bengal and it's Dependencies...\\"  Attempt in Delagoa Bay  In 1776, an expelled British trade official, Colonel William Bolts, approached the Austrian Imperial Court with a request to found a trading company to explore possible routes in Africa, India, and China. Empress Maria Theresa was intrigued and decided to form the Austrian Asiatic Company of Trieste, with Bolts as the head of the company. Colonel Bolts had previously been under the service of the British East India Company and was already competent in trade and colonization efforts. Bolts had also heard that the area was a possible site for gold mining. SMS Novara on the Novara Expedition of 1857-1859. Sailing from Flanders in 1778, Bolts and his company of Austrian-Italian subjects, docked in Delagoa Bay. Bolts then made treaties with the local Mabudu chieftains, who inhabited the port. A trading post (factory) was built, and the factory quickly began to thrive under Austrian rule. Bolts shortly after, set sail to promote Austria interests in India. After two years, the factory, which was composed of 155 men and a number of women, traded in ivory, and profits reached as high as 75,000 pounds per year. The Austrian presence in Delagoa Bay caused the ivory price to change dramatically. This was due to the Austrian output, which exceeded that of the Portuguese in Mozambique Island. Unfortunately for the Austrians, the port contracted malaria in 1781, and the Portuguese successfully asserted their dominance of the area; the Portuguese then proceeded to expel the remainder of Austrian colonists.  Multiple attempts in the Nicobar islands  = First attempt = After Bolts' mission in Delagoa Bay, he directed a venture to the Nicobar Islands. This mission was a part of his colonial ventures in India; and in 1778, Gottfried Stahl and his crew arrived on the ship Joseph und Theresia. Stahl greeted the natives personally and made a contract with the Nicobarese, where all twenty-four islands were to be signed over to the Austrians. The colonization effort was successful until Stahl, whom Bolts had appointed as head of the colony, died in 1783. The colonists lost courage in their settlement attempts, and the islands were abandoned in 1785. = Second attempt and expedition = Seventy-three years later in 1858, the SMS Novara, then on its circumnavigation of the globe, decided to sail to Nicobar. SMS Novara landed in Car Nicobar, the northernmost island, and its purpose was to promote scientific exploration and included the search for possible penal colonies. The leader of the group, Karl von Scherzer, promoted re-colonization. Austrian scientists and archaeologists then explored the islands of Nancowry and Kamorta and collected over 400 artifacts native to the islands. The Austrian government decided against Von Scherzer's recommendations, and closed all potential colonial opportunities. = Third attempt = In 1886, the Austrians became interested in another possible colonization attempt. When the crew arrived on the island of Nancowry with the corvette SMS Aurora, they were surprised to find the entire Nicobar island chain had been colonized by the British several years earlier. In 1868, the British purchased the claims to the Nicobar Islands from the Danish and established it as a penal colony for several years.Lowis,R. F. (1912) The Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Part I. Report. Part II. Tables. This ended all further possibilities to colonize the area. Exploration of Franz-Joseph's Land A photograph of the Tegetthoff trapped in the ice.In 1873, an Austrian expedition, according to its leader Julius von Payer, was sent to the North Pole tasked with finding the Northeast Passage. The expedition actually ended up close to the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, the easternmost point of Europe. Karl Weyprecht, the expedition's secondary leader, claimed the second intended destination after the Northeast Passage was the North Pole. The cost of the journey is estimated to be around 175,000 florins. The project was promoted and financially supported by several Austrian and Hungarian noblemen, which included Count Johann Nepomuk Wilczek and Count √ñd√∂n Zichy. The head-ship was named after the Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff. The Tegetthoff weighed 220 tonnes, 125.78 feet long (38.34 m.), and had a 100 horsepower (75 kW) steam engine). The Tegetthoff left port at Troms√∏, Noway in July 1872. Soon after arriving in the Arctic Circle, the Tegetthoff became locked in pack ice and drifted for the remainder of their journey. While drifting within the ice, the explorers discovered an archipelago and decided to name it after the then- current Emperor Franz Joseph. The crew later was able to dock and performed several sled expeditions on the island chain. Two years later in May 1874, Captain Weyprecht decided to abandon the ice-locked Tegetthoff and believed the crew could return to the mainland by sleds and boats. On 14 August, the expedition reached the open sea. The expedition then arrived at Novaya Zemlya, where a Russian fishing vessel rescued them. The crew was dropped off in Vard√∏, Norway; and were able to arrive in Austria-Hungary by train from Hamburg.  Berlin Conference of 1884‚Äì85  The Conference of Berlin in 1884 The Berlin Conference was held to settle matters of African colonization, particularly regarding the Congo territory and West Africa. Austria-Hungary was only invited to the Conference due to its status as a Great Power. While Austria did not petition for any permanent colonies or treaty ports, it did acquire some indirect benefits. Emerich Sz√©ch√©nyi von S√°rv√°ri Fels√∂-Vid√©k, serving as one of the head members of the Conference, was able to procure the privilege of free docking rights in all European African ports, excluding British South Africa, Italian Somalia, and French Madagascar. Austria-Hungary was further able to sign trade agreements consisting of colonial goods from Africa, with several of the other powers present.  19th-century colonial possibilities  = Rio de Oro = After the humiliation in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Spain wished to divest itself of its colonies, and Spanish diplomats approached the Austro-Hungarian Colonial Society about a possible purchase of the trading port of Rio de Oro. The society's vice- president, Ernst Weisl, made a quiet deal with Agenor Goluchowski, the Minister of Foreign Affairs for Austria. Goluchowski later convinced the Austrian Imperial Council, and Emperor Franz Joseph openly supported the deal. A treaty was drawn up to purchase and transfer ownership over to Austria- Hungary. However, the Hungarian House of Magnates blocked the colonial purchase on the eve of its finalization. This colonial move made by the Austrians was primarily to justify the naval aspirations of several Austrian ministers. The Hungarian Parliament had been for some time opposed to naval expansion, and the Austrians had slowly been pressuring the Hungarians for increased naval expenditures in the national budget. With the Hungarian veto of this purchase, this ended further potential colonial expansion and ideas of dramatic naval expansion in Austria-Hungary.  Port of Tianjin  Yuan's Mansion in the Austro-Hungarian Concession was built in 1918. But Yuan Shih- kai never lived here. Austria-Hungary participated in the Eight-Nation Alliance from 1899-1901. This grand alliance was formed to contain the Boxer Rebellion in China.Hall Gardner (16 March 2016). The Failure to Prevent World War I: The Unexpected Armageddon. Routledge. p. 127. . The Austro-Hungarian Navy helped in suppressing the rising. However, Austria-Hungary sent the smallest force of any nation. Only four cruisers and a force of only 296 marines were dispatched.\\"Russojapanesewarweb\\". Russojapanesewar.com. 1 July 1902. Retrieved 6 September 2012. Even so, on 27 December 1902, Austria gained a concession zone in Tianjin as part of the reward for its contribution to the Alliance. The Austrian concession zone was in area; which was slightly larger than the Italian, but smaller than the Belgian zone. The self-contained concession had its own prison, school, barracks, and hospital. It also contained the Austro-Hungarian consulate and its citizens were under Austrian, not Chinese, rule. The concession was provided with a small garrison, and Austria-Hungary proved unable to maintain control of its concession during the Great War. The concession zone was swiftly occupied on the Chinese declaration of war on the Central Powers. On 14 August 1917 the lease was terminated, (along with that of the larger German concession in the same city). Austria abandoned all claims to Tianjin on 10 September 1919. Hungary also made a similar recognition in 1920. However, despite its relatively short life-span of 15 years, the Austrians left their mark on that area of the city, as can be seen in the Austrian architecture that still stands in the city. =List of consuls= *Carl Bernauer: 1901‚Äì1908 *Erwin Ritter von Zach: 1908 *Milo≈° Kobr: 1908‚Äì1912 *Hugo Schumpeter: 1913-1917 See also *Austria-Hungary *Habsburg Monarchy *Austrian Empire *German colonial empire *German colonial projects before 1871 *List of former German colonies References Further reading * Sauer, Walter. ‚Äò‚ÄôHabsburg Colonial: Austria-Hungary's Role in European Overseas Expansion Reconsidered,‚Äù Austrian Studies (2012) 20:5-23 ONLINE Category:Colonial history of the Habsburg Monarchy Category:European colonisation in Asia Category:History of European colonialism Category:Overseas empires ","title":"Austrian colonial policy"},{"id":"9519247","title":"Kellee Stewart"},{"id":"9519252","text":"AIM ImmunoTech Inc.

It is owned by the National Trust and part of it is a Scheduled Monument. Description Rising to a maximum height of , Wolstonbury projects into the Weald from the main ridge of the South Downs giving views of both the Downs and the Weald. Views across the Weald to the north are panoramic, to the east are the Clayton Windmills and Ditchling Beacon beyond. Hollingbury is prominent to the southeast. Looking west one can see Newtimber Hill, West Hill with Devils Dyke just beyond, further out Chanctonbury Ring is clearly visible. Wolstonbury, owned and maintained by the National Trust, is listed as a Scheduled Monument. Access No roads or car parks lie close to the summit so visitors have to ascend on foot or by mountain bike. Geology South of Hurstpierpoint ridge, the clay vale lies beneath the jutting profile and complex scarp and foot of Wolstonbury Hill. The approach from the north is characterised by a network of linked or closely spaced woodlands (some parts ancient) centred on the designed landscape at Danny House. Flora and fauna Archeology and history The remains at the site include a early Bronze Age enclosure now referred to as Wolstonbury C. A possible inner enclosure known as Wolstonbury A appears to be older, due to it being overlain by C. Wolstonbury B is another possible enclosure sandwiched between A and C, its presence indicated by a survey conducted in 1994 by the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England. Excavations done by Bournemouth University in 1995 suggest that Wolstonbury A and B may be field lynchets. Skeletons were reportedly unearthed during flint digging operations begun in 1765. This digging continued until the mid-19th century, resulting in extensive damage to the site. Unknown quantities of Neolithic and early Bronze Age flintwork were discovered in a 1929 dig as well as \\"Romano-British\\" pottery, animal bones, and hammerstones.

A movement for social economic and political improvement using co- operatives economic enterprises in combination with a regard for custom and tradition to synthesise a new social order. As the Marau-Hauba Council on Guadalcanal, became destabilised in 1956, while a 'back to custom' movement was gaining strength, centred in the south east coastal areas and on the villages in the Suta area ‚Äì on the northern side of the interior mountains. At Makaruka and Veuru Moli, Pelise Moro started to mobilise people around stories of original creation and a return to the use of name Isatabu instead of Guadalcanal. However, as the movement rose, the Marau-Hauba council was replaced by the Guadalcanal Council. Pelise Moro  Was born in Makaruka village, Isatabu (Guadalcanal), but much of his childhood was spent in his mothers village in Suhu, east of Makaruka. According to Dominic Alebua, Moro's ancestors come from Nabua village, in the inland Areata area, in Talise. He is the descendant of a woman taken to Makaruka as a Checka (slave). After his mothers brother died, Moro inherited their land. Moros father Tavoruka was a 'Bigman' in Makaruka who held hereditary ritual powers to calm seas, make torrential rain abate and promote the fertility of the yams and taro. Moro learned these skills and inherited them when his father died in 1961. He was baptised a Roman Catholic by Fr. Jean Boudard but did not attend missionary school and is illiterate. In 1962 he married a girl from an inland village. They had 2 children ‚Äì a son and a daughter. Vision and power In 1956 Moro and some men from Komuvaolu, Makaraku, Bokasughu and Nagho went to Korasaghulu reef to stop men from Wanderer bay and the Weather Coast from fishing for trochus shells, as the Moli peoples had claimed ownership of this reef. Upon his return Moro became very ill while at Lauvi Point, where he fell while chasing the Chacha (The Eagle). Moro fell into a deep coma and was even presumed dead. However he recovered consciousness after a few days although he did not fully recover for many months. Moro has also said that during this time he was somewhat mentally ill. After he had recovered, however, Moro had acquired the ability to know who had stolen anything, who performed sorcery, and who was guilty of possessing 'Vele' or 'Piro'. It was at this time also that he began to recount the story of the origin of Guadalcanal. Moro has said that during his illness he had a visit: ‚ÄúI saw a bird but it was a man. At first it was a bird, it came out of some swirling dust like that behind a truck on the roads of Honiara. The bird changed into a man who spoke and instructed. You must do the things I tell you. Everything in this land and sea belongs to you. You must ignore all those who scoff or tell you not to do it. The things you should start is an association (Kampani, pidgin English for company) to make money All the things that are yours should be used, [n]ot allowed to stand unused or to be exploited by others. Your people own it and control it.‚Äù After his recovery, Moro began telling of his vision and large numbers came to hear it. The stories and visions were written down by members of the movement. David Valusa is one of the main recorders and translators of the movement. He recorded Moro's stories and they are kept at Makaruka, at the headquarters of the Moro Custom Company. The most important document is the creation story of Guadalcanal, \\"The story of what our ancestor in the beginning of the island Isatabu.\\" About how Ironggali created the island of Isatabu (Guadalcanal). Ironggali is a spirit or god which lives in the air. When it came to the water it was called Isobotua ‚Äì i.e. 'sitting on water' or 'floating leg'. Isobotua created the island and the life upon it: first 2 dos Laula (m) and Lauili (f) and then 2 humans: Kaputua and his sister Lavegauna. This text goes on to give the establishment of the four main descent groups or tribes of Qaravu, Manukiki, Koinahao and Lasi. Another document is the ‚ÄúCustom Company Makaruka and History of the Island Isatabu and its Paramount Chiefs.‚Äù This document claims Moro as the paramount Chief in the line of Tuimauri, giving him absolute right to the land of Guadalcanal (Isatabu) as granted by the creator and original ancestral chief Ironggali. The importance of economic transactions and boundaries (district borders) are given value and the document repudiates waste and the concept of Public Land. This was against the Protectorate Government which declared land not occupied by the people as waste and public land. Areas Moro as paramount chief had responsibility over the District Chiefs. In 1965, Davnport records 8 districts and their councils: Veuru Moli, Babuli of Makaruka, Longgu district, Ngelea of Purepure and Okimo of Uma, Talise districts, Manu of Ngalitahaverona, Koleuladistrict, Revele and Seve of Valechomara, Suta district, Sakelua and Rupo and Lau district, Manevacha of Vironggono. These districts were the ground support and area of the Moro movement. Organisation Since some of the prominent leaders of the Moro Movement were also leaders in Maasina Ruru and there are organisational similarities. Joseph Qoraiga and Ludovic Lui of Nagho who had ‚Äòduties‚Äô in Maasina Ruru, later became ‚Äòvillage leaders‚Äô (Taovia ni Vera) in MM. In the village areas there are men designated as ‚Äòduties‚Äô. They act as messengers, collectors and general aids and contacts to Moro. They are sometimes referred to as a Passion (a pidgin word meaning way of doing things) apart from their jobs as duties they are also responsible for ensuring the village rules and norms are adhered to. A Passion has under him a contingent of ladies called ‚ÄòDaki Nonoro‚Äô whose work is to look after visitors. Another similarity between the 2 movements is the organisation of followers or members into large communal villages. Before this people lived in small villages comprising family members and close relatives. In these villages there is a Luma ‚Äì a guest house to accommodate visitors. There is also a Tabu House set aside for meetings and ceremonies such as healing rituals. The biggest tabu House is the Custom House at Makaruka which is the HQ of the movement. This house stored valuables such as shell money baskets, traditional artefacts and other objects of significance in the history of Isatabu. The Collection and the census Sums of money were collected from followers at the orders of Moro, through the ‚Äòcensus‚Äô. One shilling was called for to aid the cause. In addition to the census contribution, a ‚Äòcollection‚Äô was also instituted. This is one pund from each adult male and 10 shillings from each adult female. Another contribution was in shell currency which is kept at the House of Antiquities at Makaruka. The movement's financial worth in 1990 was estimated at between 20 and 30 thousand SI dollars, including the value of the shell money. There has never been any attempt to use of bank this money though. It is owned by Moro who does not use it either. Alluvial gold is also given free by followers to Moro. With some of the money collected, some relatively large scale commercial endeavours were begun, including stores at Makaruka, a piggery, a plantation, a school and even a taxi in Honiara. Most of these ventures have collapsed. The panning of alluvial gold was also an encouraged activity for members of the movement. This brought them into direct conflict with the large mining companies. However, most of the land owners where the mining companies operate in Central Guadalcanal, are also Moro Movement members and so are benefiting from the mining. Social and cultural activities The movements supporters gathered in large numbers at Makaruka for meetings of the entire group or for feasts. During these feasts, most but not all would wear traditional dress: fibre skirt called 'bosa' for women and tree bark or ‚ÄòKabilato‚Äô for men. Other activities include the collection of traditional artefacts and ‚Äòsacred stones‚Äô to be kept at the House of Antiquities. Traditional artefacts include carvings, traditional tools such as stone axes and weapons. The collection of ‚Äòsacred stones‚Äô was very frenetic during the 1970s. The stones were brought from the Offering Altars of ‚ÄòPeo of the different clans of the movement. The Peo signify the ownership of the land by the clan who owns a peo in the area. They were collected in the HoA. These activities were opposed by the Roman Catholic Church in the area who said that the stones were associated with spirits of ancestors and were being worshipped. While Sio Bubuli claimed that the stones were kept as souvenirs or mementoes just like the Church keeps objects such as the Eucharist. Ben Magore who looked after the House in the 1980s 90s stated that the stones are being kept until Moro releases the stones‚Äô stories and histories. This future time will depend upon Moro and the members of the movement. The movement, like Maasina Ruru also had factions of cargo cult behaviour. In 1965, Diki Valerago and Pada Valebaibai in the Suta area went to Koleula and told people to await cargo from America. Sio Bubuli, Moro and others were against this activity. Recent developments After the 1977 general elections, David Valusa of the MM was elected into the National Parliament. It was a bigger achievement of the movement and great boost when Valusa lead the country into independence. On 7 July 1978. In Honiara, the Movement were invited to put on a cultural show at the independence ceremonies. After independence, Valusa was an important figure in the movement but when Ezekiel Alebua from the anti-moro area of Avuavu was victorious in the 1980 election. From 1980 ‚Äì 84, Alebua gained favour in the movement by helping Moro m villages, for example water supply to Makaruka and Komuvaolu, and a Copra Buying Point at Haimarao including Longgu and Nago villages. Provincial Fisheries were improved at Marau. In 86 when EA was elected PM. Gaena alu Movement In September 1985, Chief Moro and his supporters celebrated 3 decades of the movement at Turarana, by taking a new name. The celebrations were attended by many guests including government officials, the British High Commissioner Mr. Stansfield and his wife. The new name is defined differently by different people. Some refer to the Octopus with 8 hands, others the 8 rays of the sun. Most people still use Moro Movement.

Typically, they consist of stones, each of which may be about 30 cm in size, laid out in a pattern extending over several metres or tens of metres. Notable examples have been made by many different Australian Aboriginal cultures, and in many case are thought to be associated with spiritual ceremonies. Particularly fine examples are in Victoria, where the stones can be very large (up to 1 metre high). For example, the stone arrangement at Wurdi Youang consists of about 100 stones arranged in an egg-shaped oval about 50m across. Each stone is well-embedded into the soil, and many have \\"trigger-stones\\" to support them. The appearance of the site is very similar to that of the megalithic stone circles found throughout Britain (although the function and culture are presumably completely different). Although its association with Indigenous Australians is well-authenticated and beyond doubt, the purpose is unclear, although it may have a connection with initiation rites. It has also been suggested that the site may have been used for astronomical purposes (Morieson 2003). Other well-known examples in Victoria include the stone arrangements at Carisbrook and Lake Bolac.Long, A. & Schell, P., 1999, Lake Bolac stone arrangement (AAV 7422-394); management plan. An unpublished report to Aboriginal Affairs Victoria. Australia's largest collection of standing stones is said to be at Murujuga, also known as the Burrup peninsula or the Dampier archipelago, in Western Australia, which includes tall standing stones similar to the European menhirs, as well as circular stone arrangements. Part of the Yirrkala stone arrangement representing a Macassan fishing boat A very different example is found near Yirrkala in Arnhem Land, where there are detailed images of the praus used by Macassan fisherman fishing for Trepang, several hundred years before European contact. Here the stones are small (typically 10‚Äì20 cm), sit on the surface of the ground, and can easily be moved by hand, which also implies that they can be easily damaged or altered by modern hands, so that caution is needed when interpreting such sites. Similar examples are found scattered throughout Australia, mainly in remote or inaccessible places, and it is likely that there were many more prior to European settlement of Australia. In South East Australia are found Bora rings which consist of two circles of stones, one larger than the other, which were used in an initiation ceremony and rite of passage in which boys were transformed into men. Some Aboriginal stone arrangements in south-east Australia are aligned to cardinal directions with an accuracy of a few degrees,Orientations of linear stone arrangements in New South Wales Hamacher et al., 2013, Australian Archaeology, 75, 46-54 while the Wurdi Youang stone arrangement, which indicates the direction of solstitial sunsets, appears to have been built around the east-west direction, again with an accuracy of a few degrees.Wurdi Youang: An Australian Aboriginal Stone Circle with possible solar indications Norris et al., 2013, Rock Art Research, 30, 55-65.

Small numbers of Anglo-Jewish immigrants followed, some subsidized by a Jewish charity in London which had a mission of caring for the poor and orphaned young people in the community. These \\"subsidised\\" Jewish immigrants were also intended by their benefactors to be devout members of the fledgling Jewish community in Wellington, to which the respected English business leader Abraham Hort, Senior, was sent from London to organize along London religious lines. The difficulties of life in early colonial New Zealand, together with historically high rates of intermarriage, made it hard to maintain strict religious observation in any of the new congregations. Following news of gold rushes, Jewish immigrants poured in from new lands such as Germany, and then moved on when the boom was over. These immigrants, and others from Eastern Europe faced an increasingly stringent immigration policy throughout the end of the 19th and mid 20th century, but Jewish New Zealanders and their descendants have continued to contribute in business, medicine, politics, and other areas of New Zealand life, at the highest levels, and the spectrum of Jewish religious observance continues in communities throughout the country. While New Zealand has experienced several anti-Semitic incidents in recent decades, the government and public response has been swift and unequivocal. Early immigrants Anglo-Jewish traders were among the early immigrants from the 1830s onwards. Joel Samuel Polack, the best known and most influential of them, arrived in New Zealand in 1831. Polack, an English-born Jew, opened a general store at Kororareka in the Bay of Islands, where, following the tradition of centuries of European \\"Port Jews\\", his respect for the MƒÅori people's culture earned him unique access and insights as a trader. Joel Samuel Polack's trade advertisement John Israel Montefiore, also an English- born Jew, left Sydney, Australia for New Zealand in October 1831. He became a merchant in Tauranga and Kororareka, and later, Auckland, where he featured prominently in civic affairs. Returning briefly to England in 1837, Polack wrote two popular books about his 1831‚Äì37 travels in New Zealand. In addition to being entertaining travel guides to new tastes (hearts of palm, for example), sights and sounds (MƒÅori tattoos, exotic birds), etc., his books were a rallying cry for commercial development, specifically for flax production which he believed was possible on a lucrative scale. In 1838, in testimony to a House of Lords inquiry into the state of the islands of New Zealand, Polack warned that unorganised European settlement would destroy MƒÅori culture, and advocated planned colonisation. With the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840, the way was cleared for colonisation and the first legitimate immigrants. The British government and the speculative New Zealand Company, among whose financial backers was the wealthy Anglo-Jewish Goldsmid family anticipated (wrongly, as it turned out, at least in the next few decades) that land would increase in value, and encouraged a flood of subsidised mostly English and Scottish emigrants. Abraham Hort, Jr, related by family and business ties to the Mocatta & Goldsmid bank, arrived in Wellington on the barque Oriental on 31 January 1840 accompanied by two brothers he employed as cabinet makers, Solomon and Benjamin Levy. These were the first recognisably Jewish names in this early wave of post-Treaty settlement. Solomon Levy, 1817‚Äì1883, Wellington New Zealand. Levy arrived from London with his brother Benjamin in 1840. He helped to found the Jewish synagogue in Wellington, taught Hebrew to Wellington's Jewish children for many years, but was himself married to his sister's Christian shipmate, and their children were raised Christian. Hort's business and civic leadership was quickly recognised in the new colony. Within months of his arrival he was elected one of the two constables for Wellington's fledgling police force. Hort was a promoter of early Wellington civic affairs, Jewish and non-Jewish. David Nathan was an important Auckland businessman and benefactor, who is perhaps best known for establishing the firm L.D. Nathan and Company. He left Sydney for the Bay of Islands on the Achilles on 21 February 1840. Nathaniel William Levin was another early immigrant, who became a notable merchant in Wellington and a politician. He arrived in Wellington on 30 May 1841 on the Arachne. Economic and religious factors in early Anglo-Jewish emigration Hort's father, Abraham Hort Senior saw New Zealand as a possible haven for impoverished English Jews and a potential refuge for oppressed Jews of eastern Europe and elsewhere. The Jews' Hospital (Neveh zedak), which was largely funded by the Goldsmid family, sponsored two Jewish women to emigrate in 1841 on the barque Birman: Elizabeth Levy, (sister of the Levy brothers), and Esther Solomon, who was being sent to marry one of the brothers. Annotated Birman map Esther Solomon Levy 1824‚Äì1911 Benjamin Levy 1818‚Äì1853 Bills allowing Jews more civil rights in England had been introduced and repeatedly voted down, and Jews in the 19th century continued to be portrayed with racist stereotypes. Among the promises of emigration for Jews was that the lack of manpower would level the ethnic playing field Early Jewish ceremonies Marriage Contract of Esther Solomon and Benjamin Levy, Wellington, 1 June 1842. The first Jewish ceremony in New Zealand was the marriage of businessman David Nathan to Rosetta Aarons, the widow of Captain Michael Aarons, on 31 October 1841. Their daughter, Sarah Nathan, born 10 January 1843, was the first known Jewish birth in New Zealand. The second ceremony, the marriage of Esther Solomon and Benjamin Levy was on 1 June 1842 in Wellington, according to the ketubah contract in Hebrew, witnessed by Alfred Hort (another of Abraham Hort Senior's sons) and another early Jewish emigrant Nathaniel William Levin. Levin, for whom the town of Levin was later named, soon married Hort Senior's daughter, Jessy, further connecting the small group of early Wellington Jews. Bris June 13, 1843 In early 1843, Abraham Hort, Sr. arrived in Wellington, where he organised and promoted the Jewish community, with the approval of London's Chief Rabbi. Hort brought with him David Isaacs, also an alumnus of the Jews' Hospital. Isaacs served as Mohel (to perform circumcisions), shochet (kosher butcher) and chazan (Cantor/lay leader for services). The first religious service was performed soon after, on 7 January 1843. A few months later, the new community celebrated the birth of Benjamin's and Esther's first child, Henry Emanuel Levy, which Hort documented in a series of letters sent to The Jewish Chronicle (the premier London Jewish newspaper of the time). Acting on behalf of the community, Hort requested a plot of land for a synagogue and a plot of land for Jewish burials, offering himself as one of the trustees. The request was originally denied, the government responding that it didn't have the authority. The death of the Levy's second son, aged 8 months in 1845 was, Hort wrote to the Chronicle, \\"our first Jewish corpse\\" and the \\"first Jewish burial\\" in the new Jewish cemetery. Throughout the early 1840s, Hort's letters to the London Jewish Chronicle and the Voice of Jacob reveal the difficulty of maintaining a Jewish community that could barely muster a minyan, owing to the demands of making a living, and complaining how few Jewish shopkeepers respected the sabbath by closing their doors, let alone celebrating Jewish holidays properly. A MƒÅori massacre, the threat of forced militia service for all, and the extreme difficulty of making a living, took their toll on the small community. Isolation rapidly gave way to intermarriage. Solomon Levy quickly married Jane Harvey, the 14-year-old Christian shipmate of Esther Solomon and Elizabeth Levy. Although only one of his eight surviving children chose Judaism as a religion, Levy helped found the first Wellington synagogue and taught Hebrew to Jewish children for many years. Mid-1800s gold rushes In 1849‚Äì1850 the California Gold Rush led to an exodus of early New Zealand Jewish settlers, including Joel Samuel Polack, Benjamin Levy, and Abraham Hort.Starr, Kevin and Orsi, Richard J. (eds.) (2000), pp. 53‚Äì56. For those who remained, gold rushes in New Zealand in the 1860s, the Central Otago Gold Rush from 1861 and the West Coast Gold Rush from 1864 shifted their businesses from centres like Auckland and Wellington to new towns and (like Sir Julius Vogel) to Dunedin in the South Island. In 1862, the congregation in Dunedin had 43 members. Those drawn to gold strikes in the 1860s and after, were instrumental in founding businesses and helping to erect the many synagogues that were established at this time. Jewish cemetery in Auckland, founded in the mid-nineteenth century. Late 19th century Restrictions were instituted in 1881 that effectively closed off immigration to immigrants who were not from England, Ireland, or Scotland, who were Asian, or any other culture deemed too foreign (a category which also included eastern European Jews). New Zealand, like Australia, had struggled with its white, Christian identity. Some have attributed this attitude to New Zealand's geographic isolation at the time, to fear of economic competition, to the dilution of a perceived \\"white\\" culture. 20th century As a result of the restrictions put into place earlier, few Jews were granted refuge in New Zealand before, during or after the Holocaust. First called \\"enemy aliens\\" because of their German nationality, popular sentiment suggested that they leave as soon as the war was over, as they were competing with New Zealanders for work. The major veterans group, the Returned Services' Association, in 1945 suggested that not only should the \\"enemy aliens\\" go back where they came from, but that any money they had made during their stay should be turned over to the wives and children of the soldiers, who had risked their lives while the Jews stayed safely in New Zealand. More recently, Jewish immigrants have come from South Africa, Israel, and the former Soviet Union. Role in leadership Three Prime Ministers have Jewish ancestry, although only Julius Vogel, who served twice during the 1870s, practised Judaism. Francis Bell was PM very briefly in 1925. Former Prime Minister John Key was born to an Austrian Jewish mother and is thus considered Jewish under Halakha, though he is not practising. More recent religious and cultural developments Moriah School, Wellington's only Jewish day school opened in 1985. It closed in December 2012, citing a lack of resources and fewer than 20 pupils. In 2010 the practice of shechita, the ritual slaughter of mammals and birds, attracted controversy when the Minister of Agriculture reversed a decision that had banned it. The issue was about to be heard in the High Court but pressure from Jewish community members who wanted to slaughter poultry in the traditional manner promoted the move. In recent years a small but growing Chabad movement has been established in several cities, including Otago and Auckland. The Chabad house in Christchurch was destroyed in the 2011 earthquake that hit New Zealand. International Jewish fundraising efforts helped the Chabad community to rebuild. Antisemitic attacks In 1990, four children at an Auckland Jewish day school were stabbed by an apparently demented woman, but all survived. In 2004, scores of Jewish graves, including Solomon Levy's and other historic early Jewish graves, were smashed and spray painted with swastikas and other anti-semitic messages at Wellington. The New Zealand Parliament responded rapidly to condemn the actions. Solomon Levy's grave was restored by the City of Wellington and re-consecrated in 2005. Solomon Levy's grave in Wellington, broken in one of several antisemitic attacks.Close up of repaired headstone In October 2012, a Jewish cemetery in Auckland was desecrated overnight with swastikas and anti-semitic statements scrawled across the grave stones. More than 20 graves were attacked at the Karangahape Road cemetery. The perpetrator, a young Englishman on holiday in New Zealand, was convicted and ordered to leave the country. Founding of synagogues Three early synagogues at Nelson, Hokitika, and Timaru are no longer in existence. Hokitika's synagogue, which served the boom and bust Gold Rush Jewish population, was virtually abandoned for the last decades of the 19th century and was known as \\"the Ghost Synagogue.\\" The Dunedin Synagogue was established at Dunedin in September 1863. The Canterbury Hebrew Congregation obtained funds in 1863 to build a small wooden synagogue on a block of land in Gloucester Street (between Cambridge Terrace and Montreal Street) in Christchurch. The next synagogue, called Beth El Synagogue, was built on the same site and opened in 1881. The first synagogue in Wellington was Beth El, established in 1870 at 222 The Terrace. By the 1920s, this wooden building with a capacity of 200 was too small for the city's 1400 participants and a new brick building was built on the same site and opened in 1929. The site was required to be vacated for motorway construction in 1963, and a new Wellington Jewish Community Centre was opened at 74‚Äì80 Webb Street in 1977. In Auckland, a synagogue building was designed in 1884‚Äì85 and opened on 9 November 1885. The building still stands at 19A Princes Street, has heritage protection, and is now known as University House. The community moved to larger premises at Greys Avenue in 1967. Demographics In 1848, in New Zealand's total population of 16,000 there were known to be at least 61 Jews, 28 in Wellington and 33 in Auckland. The 2013 New Zealand census data gives 6,867 people identifying as having a Jewish religious affiliation, out of the total New Zealand population of 4.5 million. Another estimation (2009) was around 10,000 Jewish people. In 2012 a book titled \\"Jewish Lives in New Zealand\\" claimed that there were more than 20,000 Jewish people in New Zealand, including non- practising Jews. There are seven synagogues.

It is located on the Maharashtra State Highway-3 MH MSH-3 and Maharashtra State Highways MH SH-183 connecting to Deulgaon Raja in Buldhana district and MH-232 connecting Kinwat town in Nanded district. Mahagaon is a small and beautiful taluka place famously known as COTTON TOWN situated in Yavatmal District of Maharashtra.  History  East India Company created Berar Province in 1853, Yavatmal became part of East Berar District in 1863 and later part of the South East Berar district, both districts of the Central Provinces and Berar. Mahagaon remained part of Madhya Pradesh until the 1956 reorganization of states when it was transferred to the Bombay State. With the creation of the Maharashtra state on 1 May 1960, Mahagaon along with Yavatmal district became a part of it. Mahagaon is surrounded by hills from almost all the sides and is at little lower elevation than these hills. Pus nadi is lifeline of the town and also a source of drinking water and irrigation water. The Mahagaon has population of 8248 of which 4169 are males while 4079 are females with total 1949 families residing as per Population Census 2011. In Mahagaon village population of children with age 0-6 is 980 which makes up 11.88% of total population of village. Average Sex Ratio of Mahagaon village is 978 which is higher than Maharashtra state average of 929. Child Sex Ratio for the Mahagaon as per census is 929, higher than Maharashtra average of 894. Mahagaon village has higher literacy rate compared to Maharashtra. In 2011, literacy rate of Mahagaon village was 85.54% compared to 82.34% of Maharashtra. In Mahagaon Male literacy stands at 91.31% while female literacy rate was 79.68%. As per constitution of India and Panchyati Raaj Act, Mahagaon is administrated by Nagar Panchayat adhyakshya (Head of Nagapnchayat ) who is elected representative of town. When we went into the history of town the credit of civilization goes to great personalities in town from Shree. Vishramji patil Narwade who was the Sarpanch of then village and one of the Initial developer of town ,Shree Vasantraoji Naik former chief minister Maharashtra, Sudhakarraoji Naik former chief minister of Maharashtra and governor of Himachal Pradesh and many Others. Mahagaon and surrounding areas mostly depend on agriculture as the main source of income. The land in the region is very well irrigated because of Pus dam, Veni Dam. Pus River also provide direct irrigation water to farms. Drinking water is also sourced from this canal. Main crops include Sugarcane, Cotton, Soybean, Bengal gram, Jawar, and Wheat. There is a market place for cotton and food grains in the city. As main crop of Mahagaon are Cotton and Suger cane, there are two co-operative sugar factories viz. 1.

Given two (usually independent) random variables X and Y, the distribution of the random variable Z that is formed as the ratio Z = X/Y is a ratio distribution. An example is the Cauchy distribution (also called the normal ratio distribution), which comes about as the ratio of two normally distributed variables with zero mean. Two other distributions often used in test-statistics are also ratio distributions: the t-distribution arises from a Gaussian random variable divided by an independent chi-distributed random variable, while the F-distribution originates from the ratio of two independent chi-squared distributed random variables. More general ratio distributions have been considered in the literature.George Marsaglia (April 1964). Ratios of Normal Variables and Ratios of Sums of Uniform Variables. Defense Technical Information Center. Often the ratio distributions are heavy-tailed, and it may be difficult to work with such distributions and develop an associated statistical test. A method based on the median has been suggested as a \\"work-around\\". Algebra of random variables The ratio is one type of algebra for random variables: Related to the ratio distribution are the product distribution, sum distribution and difference distribution. More generally, one may talk of combinations of sums, differences, products and ratios. Many of these distributions are described in Melvin D. Springer's book from 1979 The Algebra of Random Variables. The algebraic rules known with ordinary numbers do not apply for the algebra of random variables. For example, if a product is C = AB and a ratio is D=C/A it does not necessarily mean that the distributions of D and B are the same. Indeed, a peculiar effect is seen for the Cauchy distribution: The product and the ratio of two independent Cauchy distributions (with the same scale parameter and the location parameter set to zero) will give the same distribution. This becomes evident when regarding the Cauchy distribution as itself a ratio distribution of two Gaussian distributions of zero means: Consider two Cauchy random variables, C_1 and C_2 each constructed from two Gaussian distributions C_1=G_1/G_2 and C_2 = G_3/G_4 then : \\\\frac{C_1}{C_2} = \\\\frac{{G_1}/{G_2}}{{G_3}/{G_4}} = \\\\frac{G_1 G_4}{G_2 G_3} = \\\\frac{G_1}{G_2} \\\\times \\\\frac{G_4}{G_3} = C_1 \\\\times C_3, where C_3 = G_4/G_3. The first term is the ratio of two Cauchy distributions while the last term is the product of two such distributions. Derivation A way of deriving the ratio distribution of Z = X/Y from the joint distribution of the two other random variables X , Y , with joint pdf p_{X,Y}(x,y) , is by integration of the following form : p_Z(z) = \\\\int^{+\\\\infty}_{-\\\\infty} y\\\\, p_{X,Y}(zy, y) \\\\, dy. If the two variables are independent then p_{XY}(x,y) = p_X(x) p_Y(y) and this becomes : p_Z(z) = \\\\int^{+\\\\infty}_{-\\\\infty} y\\\\, p_X(zy) p_Y(y) \\\\, dy. This may not be straightforward. By way of example take the classical problem of the ratio of two standard Gaussian samples. The joint pdf is : p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\\\frac {1}{2 \\\\pi }\\\\exp(-\\\\frac{x^2}{2} ) \\\\exp(-\\\\frac{y^2}{2} ) Defining Z = X/Y we have : p_Z(z) = \\\\frac {1}{2 \\\\pi }\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\, y \\\\, \\\\exp(-\\\\frac{(zy)^2}{2} ) \\\\, \\\\exp(-\\\\frac{ y^2}{2} ) \\\\, dy : \\\\;\\\\; \\\\;\\\\; = \\\\frac {1}{2 \\\\pi } \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\,y \\\\, \\\\exp(-\\\\frac{y^2 (z^2 + 1)}{2} ) \\\\, dy Using the known definite integral \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} \\\\, x \\\\, \\\\exp(-cx^2 ) dx = \\\\frac {1}{2c} we get : p_Z(z) = \\\\frac {1}{ \\\\pi (z^2 + 1)} which is the Cauchy distribution, or Student's t distribution with n = 1 The Mellin transform has also been suggested for derivation of ratio distributions. In the case of positive independent variables, proceed as follows. The diagram shows a separable bivariate distribution f_{x,y}(x,y)=f_x(x)f_y(y) which has support in the positive quadrant x,y > 0 and we wish to find the pdf of the ratio R= X/Y. The hatched volume above the line y = x/ R represents the cumulative distribution of the function f_{x,y}(x,y) multiplied with the logical function X/Y \\\\le R. The density is first integrated in horizontal strips; the horizontal strip at height y extends from x = 0 to x = Ry and has incremental probability f_y(y)dy \\\\int_0^{Ry} f_x(x)dx . Secondly, integrating the horizontal strips upward over all y yields the volume of probability above the line : F_R(R) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f_y(y) \\\\left(\\\\int_0^{Ry} f_x(x)dx \\\\right) dy Finally, differentiate F_R(R) \\\\text{ wrt. } R to get the pdf f_R(R) . : f_R(R) = \\\\frac{d}{dR} \\\\left[ \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f_y(y) \\\\left(\\\\int_0^{Ry} f_x(x)dx \\\\right) dy \\\\right] Move the differentiation inside the integral: : f_R(R) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f_y(y) \\\\left(\\\\frac{d}{dR} \\\\int_0^{Ry} f_x(x)dx \\\\right) dy and since : \\\\frac{d}{dR} \\\\int_0^{Ry} f_x(x)dx = yf_x(Ry) then : f_R(R) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f_y(y) \\\\; f_x(Ry) \\\\; y \\\\; dy As an example, find the pdf of the ratio R when : f_x(x) = \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\alpha x}, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; f_y(y) = \\\\beta e^{-\\\\beta y}, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; x,y \\\\ge 0 Evaluating the cumulative distribution of a ratio We have : \\\\int_0^{Ry} f_x(x)dx = - e^{-\\\\alpha x} \\\\vert_0^{Ry} = 1- e^{-\\\\alpha Ry} thus : \\\\begin{align} F_R(R) &= \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f_y(y) \\\\left( 1- e^{-\\\\alpha Ry} \\\\right) dy =\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\beta e^{-\\\\beta y} \\\\left( 1- e^{-\\\\alpha Ry} \\\\right) dy  & = 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\alpha R}{\\\\beta + \\\\alpha R}  & = \\\\frac{ R}{\\\\tfrac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha} + R} \\\\end{align} Differentiation wrt. R yields the pdf of R : f_R(R) =\\\\frac{d}{dR} \\\\left( \\\\frac{ R}{\\\\tfrac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha} + R} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\tfrac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha}} {\\\\left( \\\\tfrac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha} + R \\\\right)^2 } Moments of random ratios From Mellin transform theory, for distributions existing only on the positive half-line x \\\\ge 0 , we have the product identity \\\\operatorname{E}[(UV)^p ] = \\\\operatorname{E}[U^p ] \\\\;\\\\; \\\\operatorname{E}[V^p ] provided U, \\\\; V are independent. For the case of a ratio of samples like \\\\operatorname{E}[(X/Y)^p] , in order to make use of this identity it is necessary to use moments of the inverse distribution. Set 1/Y = Z such that \\\\operatorname{E}[(XZ)^p ] = \\\\operatorname{E}[X^p ] \\\\; \\\\operatorname{E}[Y^{-p} ]. Thus, if the moments of X^p \\\\text { and } Y^{-p} can be determined separately, then the moments of X/Y can be found. The moments of Y^{-p} are determined from the inverse pdf of Y , often a tractable exercise. At simplest, \\\\operatorname{E}[ Y^{-p} ] =\\\\int_0^\\\\infty y^{-p} f_y(y)\\\\,dy . To illustrate, let X be sampled from a standard Gamma distribution : x^{\\\\alpha - 1}e^{-x}/\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha) \\\\text { whose } p^{th} moment is \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha + p) / \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha). Z = Y^{-1} is sampled from an inverse Gamma distribution with parameter \\\\beta and has pdf \\\\; \\\\Gamma^{-1}(\\\\beta) z^{1+\\\\beta} e^{-1/z}. The moments of this pdf are : \\\\operatorname{E}[Z^p]= \\\\operatorname{E}[Y^{-p}] = \\\\frac { \\\\Gamma(\\\\beta - p)}{ \\\\Gamma(\\\\beta) }, \\\\; p<\\\\beta. Multiplying the corresponding moments gives : \\\\operatorname{E}[(X/Y)^p]=\\\\operatorname{E}[X^p] \\\\; \\\\operatorname{E}[Y^{-p}] = \\\\frac { \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha + p)}{ \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha) } \\\\frac { \\\\Gamma(\\\\beta - p)}{ \\\\Gamma(\\\\beta) }, \\\\; p<\\\\beta. Independently, it is known that the ratio of the two Gamma samples R = X/Y follows the Beta Prime distribution: : f_{\\\\beta^'}(r, \\\\alpha, \\\\beta) = B(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta)^{-1} r^{\\\\alpha-1} (1+r)^{-(\\\\alpha + \\\\beta)} whose moments are \\\\operatorname{E}[R^p]= \\\\frac { \\\\Beta(\\\\alpha + p,\\\\beta-p)}{ \\\\Beta(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta) } Substituting \\\\Beta(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta) =\\\\frac { \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha)\\\\Gamma(\\\\beta)}{ \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha +\\\\beta) } we have \\\\operatorname{E}[R^p] = \\\\frac { \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha + p)\\\\Gamma(\\\\beta - p)} { \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha +\\\\beta) } \\\\Bigg/ \\\\frac { \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha)\\\\Gamma(\\\\beta)} { \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha +\\\\beta) } = \\\\frac { \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha +p)\\\\Gamma(\\\\beta - p)} { \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha) \\\\Gamma(\\\\beta) } which is consistent with the product of moments above. Means and variances of random ratios In the Product distribution section, and derived from Mellin transform theory (see section above), it is found that the mean of a product of independent variables is equal to the product of their means. In the case of ratios, we have : \\\\operatorname{E}(X/Y) = \\\\operatorname{E}(X)\\\\operatorname{E}(1/Y) which, in terms of probability distributions, is equivalent to : \\\\operatorname{E}(X/Y) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x f_x(x) \\\\, dx \\\\times \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty y^{-1} f_y(y) \\\\, dy Note that \\\\operatorname{E}(1/Y) eq \\\\frac{1}{\\\\operatorname{E}(Y)} \\\\text{ ie. } \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty y^{-1} f_y(y) \\\\, dy e \\\\frac{1}{\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty y f_y(y) \\\\, dy} The variance of a ratio of independent variables is : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{Var}(X/Y) & = \\\\operatorname{E}( [X/Y]^2) - \\\\operatorname{E^2}(X/Y)  & = \\\\operatorname{E}(X^2) \\\\operatorname{E}(1/Y^2) - \\\\operatorname{E}^2(X) \\\\operatorname{E}^2(1/Y) \\\\end{align} Normal ratio distributions =Uncorrelated central normal ratio= When X and Y are independent and have a Gaussian distribution with zero mean, the form of their ratio distribution is a Cauchy distribution. This can be derived by setting Z = X/Y = \\\\tan \\\\theta then showing that \\\\theta has circular symmetry. For a bivariate uncorrelated Gaussian distribution we have : \\\\begin{align} p(x,y) &= \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt {2 \\\\pi} } e^{-\\\\tfrac{1}{2} x^2 } \\\\times \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt {2\\\\pi}} e^{-\\\\tfrac{1}{2} y^2 }  &= \\\\tfrac{1}{ 2\\\\pi} e^{-\\\\tfrac{1}{2} (x^2 + y^2 )}  & = \\\\tfrac{1}{ 2\\\\pi} e^{-\\\\tfrac{1}{2} r^2 } \\\\text{ with } r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \\\\end{align} If p(x,y) is a function only of r then \\\\theta is uniformly distributed on [0, 2\\\\pi ] \\\\text{ with density } 1/2 \\\\pi so the problem reduces to finding the probability distribution of Z under the mapping : Z = X/Y = \\\\tan \\\\theta We have, by conservation of probability : p_z(z) dz = p_{\\\\theta}(\\\\theta)d\\\\theta and since dz/d\\\\theta = 1/ \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta : p_z(z) = \\\\frac{p_{\\\\theta}(\\\\theta)}{ dz/d\\\\theta } = \\\\tfrac{1}{2\\\\pi}{\\\\cos^2 \\\\theta } and setting \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta = \\\\frac{1}{1+ (\\\\tan \\\\theta)^2}= \\\\frac{1}{1+z^2} we get : p_z(z) = \\\\frac{1/2\\\\pi}{1+z^2 } There is a spurious factor of 2 here. Actually, two values of \\\\theta \\\\text{ spaced by } \\\\pi map onto the same value of z, the density is doubled, and the final result is : p_z(z) = \\\\frac{1/\\\\pi}{1+z^2 } , \\\\;\\\\; -\\\\infty < z < \\\\infty However, when the two distributions have non-zero means then the form for the distribution of the ratio is much more complicated. Below it is given in the succinct form presented by David Hinkley. =Uncorrelated noncentral normal ratio= In the absence of correlation (cor(X,Y) = 0), the probability density function of the two normal variables X = N(ŒºX, œÉX2) and Y = N(ŒºY, œÉY2) ratio Z = X/Y is given exactly by the following expression, derived in several sources: : p_Z(z)= \\\\frac{b(z) \\\\cdot d(z)}{a^3(z)} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi} \\\\sigma_x \\\\sigma_y} \\\\left[\\\\Phi \\\\left( \\\\frac{b(z)}{a(z)}\\\\right) - \\\\Phi \\\\left(-\\\\frac{b(z)}{a(z)}\\\\right) \\\\right] + \\\\frac{1}{a^2(z) \\\\cdot \\\\pi \\\\sigma_x \\\\sigma_y } e^{- \\\\frac{c}{2}} where : a(z)= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma_x^2} z^2 + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma_y^2}} : b(z)= \\\\frac{\\\\mu_x }{\\\\sigma_x^2} z + \\\\frac{\\\\mu_y}{\\\\sigma_y^2} : c = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_x^2}{\\\\sigma_x^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\mu_y^2}{\\\\sigma_y^2} : d(z) = e^{\\\\frac{b^2(z) - ca^2(z)}{2a^2(z)}} and \\\\Phi is the normal cumulative distribution function: : \\\\Phi(t)= \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{t}\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi}} e^{- \\\\frac{1}{2} u^2}\\\\ du\\\\ . Under certain conditions, a normal approximation is possible, with variance: :\\\\sigma_z^2=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_x^2}{\\\\mu_y^2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_x^2}{\\\\mu_x^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_y^2}{\\\\mu_y^2}\\\\right) =Correlated central normal ratio= The above expression becomes more complicated when the variables X and Y are correlated. If \\\\mu_x = \\\\mu_y = 0 \\\\text{ but } \\\\sigma_X eq \\\\sigma_Y and \\\\rho eq 0 the more general Cauchy distribution is obtained : p_Z(z) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{(z-\\\\alpha)^2 + \\\\beta^2}, where œÅ is the correlation coefficient between X and Y and : \\\\alpha = \\\\rho \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_x}{\\\\sigma_y}, : \\\\beta = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_x}{\\\\sigma_y} \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\rho^2}. The complex distribution has also been expressed with Kummer's confluent hypergeometric function or the Hermite function. =Correlated noncentral normal ratio= Approximations to correlated noncentral normal ratio A transformation to the log domain was suggested by Katz(1978) (see binomial section below). Let the ratio be : T \\\\sim \\\\frac{\\\\mu_x + \\\\mathbb{N}(0, \\\\sigma_x^2 )}{\\\\mu_y + \\\\mathbb{N}(0, \\\\sigma_y^2 )} = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_x + X}{\\\\mu_y + Y} = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_x}{\\\\mu_y}\\\\frac{1+ \\\\frac{X}{\\\\mu_x}}{1+ \\\\frac{Y}{\\\\mu_y}} . Take logs to get : \\\\log_e(T) = \\\\log_e \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_x}{\\\\mu_y} \\\\right) \\\\+ \\\\log_e \\\\left( 1+ \\\\frac{X}{\\\\mu_x} \\\\right) \\\\- \\\\log_e \\\\left( 1+ \\\\frac{Y}{\\\\mu_y} \\\\right) . Since \\\\log_e(1+\\\\delta) = \\\\delta - \\\\frac{\\\\delta^2}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\delta^3}{3} + \\\\dots then asymptotically : \\\\log_e(T) \\\\approx \\\\log_e \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_x}{\\\\mu_y} \\\\right)+ \\\\frac{X}{\\\\mu_x} - \\\\frac{Y}{\\\\mu_y} \\\\sim \\\\log_e \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_x}{\\\\mu_y} \\\\right) + \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\left( 0, \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_x^2}{\\\\mu_x^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_y^2}{\\\\mu_y^2} \\\\right) . Alternatively, Geary (1930) suggested that : t \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\mu_y T - \\\\mu_x}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma_y^2 T^2 - 2\\\\rho \\\\sigma_x \\\\sigma_y T + \\\\sigma_x^2}} has approximately a standard Gaussian distribution: This transformation has been called the Geary-Hinkley transformation; the approximation is good if Y is unlikely to assume negative values, basically \\\\mu_y > 3\\\\sigma_y . Exact correlated noncentral normal ratio Geary showed how the correlated ratio z could be transformed into a near-Gaussian form and developed an approximation for t dependent on the probability of negative denominator values x+\\\\mu_x<0 being vanishingly small. Fieller's later correlated ratio analysis is exact but care is needed when used with modern math packages and similar problems may occur in some of Marsaglia's equations. Pham-Ghia has exhaustively discussed these methods. Hinkley's correlated results are exact but it is shown below that the correlated ratio condition can be transformed simply into an uncorrelated one so only the simplified Hinkley equations above are required, not the full correlated ratio version. Let the ratio be: :z=\\\\frac {x+\\\\mu_x}{y+\\\\mu_y} in which x, y are zero-mean correlated normal variables with variances \\\\sigma_x^2, \\\\sigma_y^2 and X, Y have means \\\\mu_x, \\\\mu_y. Write x'=x-\\\\rho y\\\\sigma_x /\\\\sigma_y such that x', y become uncorrelated and x' has standard deviation : \\\\sigma_x' = \\\\sigma_x \\\\sqrt {1- \\\\rho^2}. The ratio: :z=\\\\frac{x' + \\\\rho y\\\\sigma_x/\\\\sigma_y+\\\\mu_x}{y+\\\\mu_y} is invariant under this transformation and retains the same pdf. The y term in the numerator is made separable by expanding: :{x' + \\\\rho y\\\\sigma_x/\\\\sigma_y+\\\\mu_x} =x'+\\\\mu_x -\\\\rho \\\\mu_y \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_x}{\\\\sigma_y} + \\\\rho (y+\\\\mu_y)\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_x}{\\\\sigma_y} to get :z=\\\\frac {x'+\\\\mu_x'}{y+\\\\mu_y} + \\\\rho \\\\frac{ \\\\sigma_x}{\\\\sigma_y} in which \\\\mu'_x=\\\\mu_x - \\\\rho \\\\mu_y \\\\frac { \\\\sigma_x }{\\\\sigma_y} and z has now become a ratio of uncorrelated non-central normal samples with an invariant z-offset. Finally, to be explicit, the pdf of the ratio z for correlated variables is found by inputting the modified parameters \\\\sigma_x', \\\\mu_x', \\\\sigma_y, \\\\mu_y and \\\\rho'=0 into the Hinkley equation above which returns the pdf for the correlated ratio with a constant offset \\\\- \\\\rho \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_x}{\\\\sigma_y} on z. The figures above show an example of a positively correlated ratio with \\\\sigma_x= \\\\sigma_y=1, \\\\mu_x=0, \\\\mu_y=0.5, \\\\rho=0.975 in which the shaded wedges represent the increment of area selected by given ratio x/y \\\\in [r, r + \\\\delta] which accumulates probability where they overlap the distribution. The theoretical distribution, derived from the equations under discussion combined with Hinkley's equations, is highly consistent with a simulation result using 5,000 samples. In the top figure it is easily understood that for a ratio z=x/y=1 the wedge almost bypasses the distribution mass altogether and this coincides with a near-zero region in the theoretical pdf. Conversely as x/y reduces toward zero the line collects a higher probability. This transformation will be recognized as being the same as that used by Geary (1932) as a partial result in his eqn viii but whose derivation and limitations were hardly explained. Thus the first part of Geary's transformation to approximate Gaussianity in the previous section is actually exact and not dependent on the positivity of Y. The offset result is also consistent with the \\"Cauchy\\" correlated zero-mean Gaussian ratio distribution in the first section. Marsaglia has applied the same result but using a nonlinear method to achieve it. =Complex normal ratio= The ratio of correlated zero-mean circularly symmetric complex normal distributed variables was determined by Baxley et. al. The joint distribution of x, y is : f_{x,y}(x,y) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi^2 \\\\Sigma} \\\\exp \\\\Biggr ( - \\\\begin{bmatrix}x  y \\\\end{bmatrix}^H \\\\Sigma ^{-1}\\\\begin{bmatrix}x  y \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\Biggr ) where : \\\\Sigma = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\sigma_x^2 & \\\\rho \\\\sigma_x \\\\sigma_y  \\\\rho^* \\\\sigma_x \\\\sigma_y & \\\\sigma_y^2 \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\;\\\\; x=x_r+ix_i, \\\\;\\\\; y=y_r+iy_i (.)^H is an Hermitian transpose and : \\\\rho = \\\\rho_r +i \\\\rho_i = \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\bigg(\\\\frac{xy^*}{\\\\sigma_x \\\\sigma_y} \\\\bigg )\\\\;\\\\; \\\\in \\\\;\\\\left \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\right \\\\le 1 The PDF of Z = X/Y is found to be : \\\\begin{align} f_{z}(z_r,z_i) & = \\\\frac{1-\\\\rho^2}{\\\\pi \\\\sigma_x^2 \\\\sigma_y^2 } \\\\Biggr ( \\\\frac{z^2}{\\\\sigma_x^2} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma_y^2} -2\\\\frac{\\\\rho_r z_r - \\\\rho_i z_i}{\\\\sigma_x \\\\sigma_y} \\\\Biggr)^{-2}  & = \\\\frac{1-\\\\rho^2}{\\\\pi \\\\sigma_x^2 \\\\sigma_y^2 } \\\\Biggr ( \\\\;\\\\; \\\\Biggr  \\\\frac{z}{\\\\sigma_x} - \\\\frac{\\\\rho^* }{\\\\sigma_y} \\\\Biggr ^2 +\\\\frac{1-\\\\rho^2}{\\\\sigma_y^2} \\\\Biggr)^{-2} \\\\end{align} In the usual event that \\\\sigma_x = \\\\sigma_y we get : f_{z}(z_r,z_i) = \\\\frac{1-\\\\rho^2}{\\\\pi \\\\left ( \\\\;\\\\;  z - \\\\rho^* ^2 + 1-\\\\rho^2 \\\\right)^{2} } Further closed-form results for the CDF are also given. The ratio distribution of correlated complex variables, rho = 0.7 exp(i pi/4). The graph shows the pdf of the ratio of two complex normal variables with a correlation coeffient of \\\\rho = 0.7 \\\\exp (i \\\\pi /4) . The pdf peak occurs at roughly the complex conjugate of a scaled down \\\\rho . Uniform ratio distribution With two independent random variables following a uniform distribution, e.g., : p_X(x) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 \\\\qquad 0 < x < 1  0 \\\\qquad \\\\text{otherwise}\\\\end{cases} the ratio distribution becomes : p_Z(z) = \\\\begin{cases} 1/2 \\\\qquad & 0 < z < 1  \\\\frac{1}{2z^2} \\\\qquad & z \\\\geq 1  0 \\\\qquad & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} Cauchy ratio distribution If two independent random variables, X and Y each follow a Cauchy distribution with median equal to zero and shape factor a : p_X(xa) = \\\\frac{a}{\\\\pi (a^2 + x^2)} then the ratio distribution for the random variable Z = X/Y is : p_Z(za) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi^2(z^2-1)} \\\\ln(z^2). This distribution does not depend on a and the result stated by Springer (p158 Question 4.6) is not correct. The ratio distribution is similar to but not the same as the product distribution of the random variable W=XY: : p_W(wa) = \\\\frac{a^2}{\\\\pi^2(w^2-a^4)} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{w^2}{a^4}\\\\right). More generally, if two independent random variables X and Y each follow a Cauchy distribution with median equal to zero and shape factor a and b respectively, then: 1\\\\. The ratio distribution for the random variable Z = X/Y is : p_Z(za,b) = \\\\frac{ab}{\\\\pi^2(b^2z^2-a^2)} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{b^2 z^2}{a^2}\\\\right). 2\\\\. The product distribution for the random variable W = XY is : p_W(wa,b) = \\\\frac{ab}{\\\\pi^2(w^2-a^2b^2)} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{w^2}{a^2b^2}\\\\right). The result for the ratio distribution can be obtained from the product distribution by replacing b with \\\\frac{1}{b}. Ratio of standard normal to standard uniform If X has a standard normal distribution and Y has a standard uniform distribution, then Z = X / Y has a distribution known as the slash distribution, with probability density function :p_Z(z) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\left[ \\\\varphi(0) - \\\\varphi(z) \\\\right] / z^2 \\\\quad & z e 0  \\\\varphi(0) / 2 \\\\quad & z = 0,  \\\\end{cases} where œÜ(z) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution. Chi-squared, Gamma, Beta distributions Let X be a normal(0,1) distribution, Y and Z be chi square distributions with m and n degrees of freedom respectively, all independent, with f_\\\\chi (x,k) = \\\\frac {x^ {\\\\frac{k}{2}-1} e^{-x/2} } { 2^{k/2} \\\\Gamma(k/2) }. Then : \\\\frac{ X }{ \\\\sqrt{ Y / m } } \\\\sim t_m the Student's t distribution : \\\\frac{ Y / m }{ Z / n } = F_{ m, n } i.e. Fisher's F-test distribution : \\\\frac{ Y }{ Y + Z } \\\\sim \\\\beta( \\\\tfrac{m}{2},\\\\tfrac{n}{2} ) the beta distribution : \\\\;\\\\;\\\\frac{ Y }{ Z } \\\\sim \\\\beta'( \\\\tfrac{m}{2},\\\\tfrac{n}{2} ) the beta prime distribution If V_1 \\\\sim {\\\\chi'}_{k_1}^2(\\\\lambda), a noncentral Chi-squared distribution, and V_2 \\\\sim {\\\\chi'}_{k_2}^2(0) and V_1 is independent of V_2 then : \\\\frac{V_1/k_1}{V_2/k_2} \\\\sim F'_{k_1,k_2}(\\\\lambda), a noncentral F-distribution. \\\\frac{m}{n} F'_{m,n} = \\\\beta'( \\\\tfrac{m}{2},\\\\tfrac{n}{2}) \\\\text{ or } F'_{m,n} = \\\\beta'( \\\\tfrac{m}{2},\\\\tfrac{n}{2} ,1,\\\\tfrac{n }{m}) defines F'_{m,n} , Fisher's F density distribution, the PDF of the ratio of two Chi-squares with m, n degrees of freedom. The CDF of the Fisher density, found in F-tables is defined in the beta prime distribution article. If we enter an F-test table with m = 3, n = 4 and 5% probability in the right tail, the critical value is found to be 6.59. This coincides with the integral : F_{3,4}(6.59) = \\\\int_{6.59}^\\\\infty \\\\beta'(x; \\\\tfrac{m}{2},\\\\tfrac{n}{2},1,\\\\tfrac{n}{m} ) dx = 0.05 If U \\\\sim \\\\Gamma ( \\\\alpha_1 , 1), V \\\\sim \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_2, 1) , where \\\\Gamma (x;\\\\alpha,1) = \\\\frac { x^{\\\\alpha-1} e^{-x}}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha)} , then : \\\\frac{ U }{ U + V } \\\\sim \\\\beta( \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2 ), \\\\qquad \\\\text{ expectation } = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_1}{\\\\alpha_1 + \\\\alpha_2 } : \\\\frac{U}{V} \\\\sim \\\\beta'(\\\\alpha_1,\\\\alpha_2), \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\text{ expectation } = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_1}{ \\\\alpha_2 -1}, \\\\; \\\\alpha_2 > 1 : \\\\frac{V}{U} \\\\sim \\\\beta'(\\\\alpha_2, \\\\alpha_1), \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\text{ expectation } = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_2}{ \\\\alpha_1 -1}, \\\\; \\\\alpha_1 > 1 If U \\\\sim \\\\Gamma (x;\\\\alpha,1) then \\\\theta U \\\\sim \\\\Gamma (x;\\\\alpha,\\\\theta) = \\\\frac { x^{\\\\alpha-1} e^{- \\\\frac{x}{\\\\theta}}}{ \\\\theta^k \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha)} If U \\\\sim \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_1, \\\\theta_1 ),\\\\; V \\\\sim \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_2, \\\\theta_2 ) , then by rescaling the \\\\theta parameter to unity we have : \\\\frac {\\\\frac {U}{\\\\theta_1}} { \\\\frac {U}{\\\\theta_1} + \\\\frac {V}{\\\\theta_2}} = \\\\frac{ \\\\theta_2 U }{ \\\\theta_2 U + \\\\theta_1 V } \\\\sim \\\\beta( \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2 ) : \\\\frac {\\\\frac {U}{\\\\theta_1}} { \\\\frac {V}{\\\\theta_2}} = \\\\frac{ \\\\theta_2 }{ \\\\theta_1 } \\\\frac{U }{ V }\\\\sim \\\\beta'( \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2 ) : thus \\\\frac {U}{V} \\\\sim \\\\beta'( \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, 1, \\\\frac{\\\\theta_1 }{ \\\\theta_2 } ) \\\\quad \\\\text{ and } \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[ \\\\frac {U}{V} \\\\right] = \\\\frac{\\\\theta_1 }{ \\\\theta_2 } \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_1}{\\\\alpha_2 - 1 } : i.e. if X \\\\sim \\\\beta'( \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, 1, 1 ) then \\\\theta X \\\\sim \\\\beta'( \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, 1, \\\\theta ) More explicitly, since : \\\\beta'(x; \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, 1, R ) = \\\\frac{1}{R} \\\\beta' (\\\\frac{x}{R} ; \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2) if U \\\\sim \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_1, \\\\theta_1 ), V \\\\sim \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_2, \\\\theta_2 ) then : \\\\frac {U}{V} \\\\sim \\\\frac{1}{R} \\\\beta' ( \\\\frac{x}{R} ; \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2 ) = \\\\frac { \\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{R} \\\\right)^{\\\\alpha_1-1} } {\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{x}{R} \\\\right)^{\\\\alpha_1+\\\\alpha_2}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac {1} { \\\\;R\\\\;B( \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2 )}, \\\\;\\\\; x \\\\ge 0 where : R = \\\\frac {\\\\theta_1}{\\\\theta_2}, \\\\; \\\\;\\\\; B( \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2 ) = \\\\frac {\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_1) \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_2)} {\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_1 + \\\\alpha_2)} Rayleigh Distributions If X, Y are independent samples from the Rayleigh distribution f_r(r) = r e^ {-r^2/2\\\\sigma^2}, \\\\;\\\\; r \\\\ge 0 , the ratio Z = X/Y follows the distribution : f_z(z) = \\\\frac{2 z}{ (1 + z^2 )^2 }, \\\\;\\\\; z \\\\ge 0 and has cdf : F_z(z) = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{ 1 + z^2 } = \\\\frac{z^2}{ 1 + z^2 }, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; z \\\\ge 0 The Rayleigh distribution has scaling as its only parameter.

Then log(T) is approximately normally distributed with mean log(p1/p2) and variance ((1/p1) ‚àí 1)/n + ((1/p2) ‚àí 1)/m. The binomial ratio distribution is of significance in clinical trials: if the distribution of T is known as above, the probability of a given ratio arising purely by chance can be estimated, ie a false positive trial. A number of papers compare the robustness of different approximations for the binomial ratio. Poisson and truncated Poisson distributions In the ratio of Poisson variables R = X/Y there is a problem that Y is zero with finite probability so R is undefined. To counter this, we consider the truncated, or censored, ratio R' = X/Y' where zero sample of Y are discounted. Moreover, in many medical-type surveys, there are systematic problems with the reliability of the zero samples of both X and Y and it may be good practice to ignore the zero samples anyway. The probability of a null Poisson sample being e^{-\\\\lambda} , the generic pdf of a left truncated Poisson distribution is : \\\\tilde p_x(x;\\\\lambda)= \\\\frac {1}{1-e^{-\\\\lambda} } { \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\lambda} \\\\lambda^{x}}{x!} }, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; x \\\\in 1,2,3, \\\\cdots which sums to unity. Following Cohen, for n independent trials, the multidimensional truncated pdf is : \\\\tilde p(x_1, x_2, \\\\dots ,x_n;\\\\lambda)= \\\\frac{1}{(1-e^{-\\\\lambda})^{n} } \\\\prod_{i=1}^n{ \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\lambda} \\\\lambda^{x_i}}{x_i!} }, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; x_i \\\\in 1,2,3, \\\\cdots and the log likelihood becomes : L = \\\\ln (\\\\tilde p) =-n\\\\ln (1-e^{-\\\\lambda}) -n \\\\lambda + \\\\ln(\\\\lambda) \\\\sum_1^n x_i - \\\\ln \\\\prod_1^n (x_i!), \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; x_i \\\\in 1,2,3, \\\\cdots On differentiation we get : dL/d\\\\lambda = \\\\frac{-n}{ 1-e^{-\\\\lambda}} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i and setting to zero gives the maximum likelihood estimate \\\\hat \\\\lambda_{ML} : \\\\frac{\\\\hat \\\\lambda_{ML}}{ 1-e^{-\\\\hat \\\\lambda_{ML} }} = \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = \\\\bar x Note that as \\\\hat \\\\lambda \\\\rightarrow 0 \\\\text{ then } \\\\bar x \\\\rightarrow 1 so the truncated maximum likelihood \\\\lambda estimate, though correct for both truncated and untruncated distributions, gives a truncated mean \\\\bar x value which is highly biassed relative to the untruncated one. Nevertheless it appears that \\\\bar x is a sufficient statistic for \\\\lambda since \\\\hat \\\\lambda_{ML} depends on the data only through the sample mean \\\\bar x = \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i in the previous equation which is consistent with the methodology of the conventional Poisson distribution. Absent any closed form solutions, the following approximate reversion for truncated \\\\lambda is valid over the whole range 0 \\\\le \\\\lambda \\\\le \\\\infty; \\\\; 1 \\\\le \\\\bar x \\\\le \\\\infty . : \\\\hat \\\\lambda = \\\\bar x - e^{-( \\\\bar x -1) } - 0.07(\\\\bar x -1)e^{-0.666(\\\\bar x-1)} + \\\\epsilon, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\epsilon  < 0.006 which compares with the non-truncated version which is simply \\\\hat \\\\lambda = \\\\bar x . Taking the ratio R = \\\\hat \\\\lambda_X / \\\\hat \\\\lambda_Y is a valid operation even though \\\\hat \\\\lambda_X may use a non-truncated model while \\\\hat \\\\lambda_Y has a left-truncated one. The asymptotic large- n\\\\lambda \\\\text{ variance of }\\\\hat \\\\lambda (and Cram√©r‚ÄìRao bound) is : \\\\mathbb{Var} ( \\\\hat \\\\lambda ) \\\\ge - \\\\left( \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\delta ^2 L }{ \\\\delta \\\\lambda^2 } \\\\right]_{\\\\lambda=\\\\hat \\\\lambda} \\\\right) ^{-1} in which substituting L gives : \\\\frac{\\\\delta ^2 L }{ \\\\delta \\\\lambda^2 } = -n \\\\left[ \\\\frac{ \\\\bar x}{\\\\lambda ^2 } - \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\lambda}}{(1-e^{-\\\\lambda})^2 } \\\\right] Then substituting \\\\bar x from the equation above, we get Cohen's variance estimate : \\\\mathbb{Var} ( \\\\hat \\\\lambda ) \\\\ge \\\\frac{ \\\\hat\\\\lambda}{n} \\\\frac { (1-e^{-\\\\hat\\\\lambda})^2 }{ 1 - (\\\\hat\\\\lambda + 1) e^{-\\\\hat\\\\lambda} } The variance of the point estimate of the mean \\\\lambda , on the basis of n trials, decreases asymptotically to zero as n increases to infinity. For small \\\\lambda it diverges from the truncated pdf variance in Springael for example, who quotes a variance of : \\\\mathbb {Var} ( \\\\lambda) = \\\\frac {\\\\lambda / n}{1-e^{-\\\\lambda}} \\\\left [ 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\lambda e^{-\\\\lambda} }{1-e^{-\\\\lambda}}\\\\right] for n samples in the left-truncated pdf shown at the top of this section. Cohen showed that the variance of the estimate relative to the variance of the pdf, \\\\mathbb {Var} ( \\\\hat \\\\lambda) / \\\\mathbb {Var} ( \\\\lambda) , ranges from 1 for large \\\\lambda (100% efficient) up to 2 as \\\\lambda approaches zero (50% efficient). These mean and variance parameter estimates, together with parallel estimates for X, can be applied to Normal or Binomial approximations for the Poisson ratio. Samples from trials may not be a good fit for the Poisson process; a further discussion of Poisson truncation is by Dietz and Bohning and there is a Zero-truncated Poisson distribution Wikipedia entry. Double Lomax distribution This distribution is the ratio of two Laplace distributions.Bindu P and Sangita K (2015) Double Lomax distribution and its applications. Statistica LXXV (3) 331‚Äì342 Let X and Y be standard Laplace identically distributed random variables and let z = X / Y. Then the probability distribution of z is : f( x ) = \\\\frac{ 1 }{ 2 ( 1 + z )^2 } Let the mean of the X and Y be a. Then the standard double Lomax distribution is symmetric around a. This distribution has an infinite mean and variance. If Z has a standard double Lomax distribution, then 1/Z also has a standard double Lomax distribution. The standard Lomax distribution is unimodal and has heavier tails than the Laplace distribution. For 0 < a < 1, the ath moment exists. : E( Z^a ) = \\\\frac{ \\\\Gamma( 1 + a ) }{ \\\\Gamma( 1 - a ) } where Œì is the gamma function.  Ratio distributions in multivariate analysis  Ratio distributions also appear in multivariate analysis. If the random matrices X and Y follow a Wishart distribution then the ratio of the determinants : \\\\varphi = \\\\mathbf{X}/\\\\mathbf{Y} is proportional to the product of independent F random variables. In the case where X and Y are from independent standardized Wishart distributions then the ratio : \\\\Lambda = {\\\\mathbf{X}/\\\\mathbf{X}+\\\\mathbf{Y}} has a Wilks' lambda distribution. =Ratios of Quadratic Forms involving Wishart Matrices= Probability distribution can be derived from random quadratic forms : r = V^T A V where V \\\\text{ and/or } A are random. If A is the inverse of another matrix B then r = V^T B^{-1} V is a random ratio in some sense, frequently arising in Least Squares estimation problems. In the Gaussian case if A is a matrix drawn from a complex Wishart distribution A\\\\sim W_C(A_0,k,p) of dimensionality p x p and k degrees of freedom with k \\\\ge p \\\\text{ while } V is an arbitrary complex vector with Hermitian (conjugate) transpose (.)^H , the ratio : r = k\\\\frac {V^H A_0^{-1} V}{V^H A^{-1} V} follows the Gamma distribution : p_1(r) = \\\\frac {r^{k-p} e^{-r}}{\\\\Gamma(k-p+1)}, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; r \\\\ge 0 The result arises in least squares adaptive Wiener filtering - see eqn(A13) of. Note that the original article contends that the distribution is p_1(r) = r^{k-p-1} \\\\; e^{-r}\\\\; / \\\\Gamma(k-p) . Similarly, Bodnar et. al show that (Theorem 2, Corollary 1), for full-rank ( k \\\\ge p ) real-valued Wishart matrix samples W \\\\sim W(\\\\Sigma,k,p) , and V a random vector independent of W, the ratio : r = \\\\frac { V^T \\\\Sigma^{-1} V }{V^T W^{-1} V} \\\\sim \\\\chi^2_{k-p+1} Given complex Wishart matrix A\\\\sim W_C(I,k,p) , the ratio : \\\\rho = \\\\frac {( V^H A^{-1} V)^2}{V^H A^{-2} V \\\\cdot V^H V} follows the Beta distribution (see eqn(47) of) : p_2(\\\\rho) = (1-\\\\rho)^{p-2} \\\\rho^{k-p+1} \\\\frac {k!}{(k+1-p)!(p-2)!}, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; 0 \\\\le \\\\rho \\\\le 1 The result arises in the performance analysis of constrained least squares filtering and derives from a more complex but ultimately equivalent ratio that if A\\\\sim W_C(A_0,n,p) then : \\\\rho = \\\\frac {( V^H A^{-1} V)^2}{V^H A^{-1} A_0 A^{-1} V \\\\cdot V^H A_0^{-1}V} In its simplest form, if A_{i,j}\\\\sim W_C(I,k,p) and W^{i,j} = \\\\left (W^{-1} \\\\right )_{i,j} then the ratio of the (1,1) inverse element squared to the sum of modulus squares of the whole top row elements has distribution : \\\\rho = \\\\frac { \\\\left( W^{1,1} \\\\right)^2 }{\\\\sum_{j \\\\in 1..p}  W^{1,j} ^2 } \\\\sim \\\\beta( p-1, k-p+2 ) See also *Relationships among probability distributions *Inverse distribution (also known as reciprocal distribution) *Product distribution *Ratio estimator *Slash distribution References External links *Ratio Distribution at MathWorld *Normal Ratio Distribution at MathWorld *Ratio Distributions at MathPages Category:Algebra of random variables Category:Statistical ratios Category:Types of probability distributions ","title":"Ratio distribution"},{"id":"9519382","text":"Maurice Gerard Moynihan, (14 December 1902 ‚Äì 21 August 1999) was an Irish civil servant and economist who served as the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland from 1960 to 1969. He was also a co-drafter of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland, Secretary of the Government of the Irish Free State in 1937 and Knight Commander of the Papal Order of St. Gregory the Great in 1959. Family background Moynihan was born in Tralee, County Kerry, brother of Sean O'Muimhneachain, a member of the Irish Volunteers, and later Sinn F√©in and both sons of Mary and Maurice Moynihan (died 1918) of Tylough, County Kerry, a leading nationalist who was campaign manager for the constitutional nationalist Thomas O'Donnell, M.P.. The two brothers took opposite sides, Maurice for, and Sean against, the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, but both ended- up working for √âamon de Valera. A third brother, Michael, who joined the British Army, was killed in action in World War I on 3 June 1918. Their sister Johanna was a member of Cumann na mBan, interned along with Sean during the Irish Civil War. Maurice was also a cousin of Patrick Denis O'Donnell, with shared interests in Irish history. Maurice married American-born Mae Conley in 1932, and they had five children. Education Moynihan was educated by the Congregation of Christian Brothers, and won a scholarship to University College Cork, where he graduated with a first-class honours degree in Commerce. Career Moynihan began his civil service career working in the Department of Finance in 1925, and his talent was quickly recognised by Minister for Finance Ernest Blythe. He was promoted to become Private Secretary to the Taoiseach, √âamon de Valera in 1932. He was appointed Secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach, and Secretary to the Government in 1937, in which post he served until 1960. In 1960, he was appointed as Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, having been a Service Director thereof from 1953 to 1960. He was one of the \\"architects\\" of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland. Later years After his retirement from the Central Bank of Ireland in 1969, he devoted much of his time in the following years to writing. His considerable archives are now in the custody of University College Dublin (UCD). During his retirement, he also served as Director of the Trinity Bank. He died at age 96 in the Leeson Park Nursing Home, and was buried in Clontarf Cemetery in Dublin. Influence and legacy He is acknowledged to have played a \\"central, constructive role in the coordination of government policy generally\\", and \\"his contribution to the development of the State was significant and enduring... matched only by his modesty and courteous manner\\" in the early formative years of the newly independent Irish Free State and later Republic of Ireland. He was also a close collaborator of de Valera in defending Ireland's neutrality during the World War II. He is also credited by the Central Bank of Ireland with having stewarded its development in areas such as the issuance of credit advice to banks marking the beginnings of monetary policy, the provision of rediscounting facilities, active participation in the market for government securities, the development of clearing systems and preparatory work for a money market, and the widening of fund backing to include non-sterling assets. During his Governorship, the Central Bank of Ireland assumed responsibility for the administration of exchange controls, the printing of banknotes in Dublin, as well as banking supervision. He oversaw the supervision of the bank mergers, and the centralisation of foreign exchange reserves. He also initiated monetary research and economic policy formulation in the Central Bank. He initiated the construction of the modern Central Bank premises in Dame Street in Dublin. Honours and tributes He was conferred with an honorary Doctorate in Economic Science by the National University of Ireland in 1955, and was invested as a Knight Commander of the Papal Order of St. Gregory the Great in 1959. On his death, he was acknowledged by Mary McAleese, the then President of Ireland, as having served his country \\"with great distinction and integrity, employing the finest qualities in the public service\\". He was also described as a \\"most independent civil servant, respected by politicians and civil servants alike\\", by Professor Patrick Lynch, prominent economist and former Assistant Secretary of the Government. J.J. Lee, professor of history in Cork, described him as one of the greatest public servants who ever served the State\\" and \\"a man in whom the institutions of the State found an absolutely trustworthy protector\\". He was \\"imbued with a profound sense of loyalty and commitment to public service\\". Echoing Professor Lee, he was considered in the view of the Irish Times \\"one of the greatest civil servants in the State.\\" Publications *Currency and Central Banking in Ireland ‚Äì 1922‚Äì1960, by Maurice G.

As a major financial centre, much of Hong Kong's Jewish community is temporary in nature, largely consisting of expatriates from countries with much larger Jewish populations, such as Israel, United States, France, and other countries. History =1800s-1960s: origins= Jews first arrived in Hong Kong when the territory was ceded to Great Britain by China in 1842. The Jews transferred their offices from neighboring Canton and Macau (a Portuguese settlement) to Hong Kong and helped to develop this new port. The Hong Kong Jewish Community was first established in 1857. The first synagogue was set up in a rental house on Hollywood Street in 1870. A new synagogue in memory of Sir Jacob Sassoon's mother, Leah, replaced the older one in 1881. The Ohel Leah Synagogue was constructed in 1901, the communal cemetery was enlarged in 1904 to meet the needs of the community with assistance of Sir Matthew Nathan, the only Jewish governor of Hong Kong, and the Jewish Club, built by the Kadoorie family, was created in 1904 and enlarged in 1909.Encyclopedia of Diasporas.

The Jewish community did not grow quickly, as most Jewish merchants were attracted to Shanghai, especially in the period from 1910 to 1936. However, the Japanese occupation of mainland China in the late 1930s caused many Jews to leave Shanghai, Tianjin, and Harbin for Hong Kong.Encyclopedia of Diasporas.

Vol. I, Jewish Diaspora in China by Xu Xin, pp.162-163, Ember, Melvin; Ember, Carol R.; Skoggard, Ian (Eds.), Springer 2004 The outbreak of World War II and the consequent Japanese occupation of Hong Kong temporarily suspended all Jewish activities there. =1960s-1990s: expansion= From the 1960s onwards, Hong Kong's development as a trade and finance centre attracted tens of thousands of foreigners, among them Jews from the United States, Israel, the UK, Australia and Canada. They revitalized the local Jewish community. Since the 1960s, Israel also began to appoint Honorary Consuls to Hong Kong. =Present day= There were 2,500 Jews living in Hong Kong (two thirds of them Americans and Israelis) according to the statistics of the Israeli embassy as of February 1998, up from 1000 around the 1980s.M.Ejlenberg It is estimated that about 5,000 Jews lived in Hong Kong in 2000,Encyclopedia of Diasporas.

Synagogues Ohel Leah Synagogue Shuva Israel Synagogue (the windows with green curtains on the third floor of the building in the center) =Ohel Leah Synagogue= The Ohel Leah Synagogue () was first founded by Jacob Sasson and his brother on Hollywood Road in 1870, and moved from place to place over the years. In 1899 they agreed that a new and permanent synagogue should be built, to search for the right field, Emmanuel Raphael, a successful Jewish merchant who was also a member of the board of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Bank found a place he thought was suitable for the construction of the new synagogue on Kennedy Street. Despite this, the synagogue was not built there because it was not possible to collect enough money to buy the land, and also because of differences of opinion with the rest of the community regarding how much of the land would be devoted to the construction of the synagogue. Finally, it was decided to build a synagogue on Robinson Road at a cost of $26,000, paid by the Sassoon family. The cornerstone was laid by Avraham Haim Yaakov Rahamim and Sasson & Co. on 7 August 1901. The synagogue called \\"Ohel Leah\\" Memory mother of founder Yakov Eliyahu David Sassoon, who died in May 1878. Construction of the synagogue was completed in 1902. In the late 1980s, the synagogue's board of governors discussed the possibility of demolishing the synagogue and building it elsewhere. The land on which the synagogue was built cost much more than the price at which it was purchased, and it seemed to them that it would be better to sell the land and to receive a new synagogue. The idea of demolishing the synagogue was dropped after one of the women who was present insisted that a synagogue should not be destroyed. However, the idea of selling the land did not come out of the chapter, and the land was finally sold, but only in half. The synagogue area remained intact, the synagogue was renovated, and the second area was built with two very tall residential buildings known as Robinson one. The lower five floors are owned by the Jewish community, including a kosher restaurant, pool, library and other community needs. The synagogue was built by Iraqi merchants, over the years, however, the synagogue underwent many vicissitudes, and today the style of the prayer is Sephardic with an Israeli accent. Almost all prayers are held in the synagogue, except for Mincha and Arabic prayers on weekdays (not including Sundays and holidays). =Shuva Israel= The Shuva Israel community () located on the Connaught road in Central was established in October 1991 by the Darwish family following differences of opinion between David Darwish, then head of the Jewish Community Department, and other Jewish officials in Hong Kong. \\"Shuva Israel\\" was intended for a more ultra-Orthodox public. The first rabbi of the community was Rabbi David Avraham. The community also operates kollel students and a kosher restaurant. The community had an ultra-Orthodox school, which was closed in 2006, when the founding family moved to Israel. =Chabad Hong Kong and Kowloon= The Chabad of Hong Kong was established in the 1980s by Rabbi Mordechai Avtzon and his wife Goldie. Chabad House Hong Kong was the first in the Far East. In addition, he founded the \\"Lubavitch of the Far East\\" (LIFE Lubavitch of the Far East). In 2009, another Chabad house was established in the Kowloon Peninsula, led by Rabbi Yisrael Liberman. =Kehilat Zion= Kehilat Zion () located in Kowloon was established in 1995 by Rabbi Shlomo Katsin. At first Rabbi Zion Mizrachi was sent to serve as rabbi of the community, named after him. The community is mainly used by local businessmen and those who are invited to visit their businesses. Rabbi Meoded serves as the chief rabbi of the Sephardic community in Hong Kong and also serves as the Chief Rabbi of Hong Kong, where there is a synagogue and a kosher restaurant serving kosher food and Shabbat meals.

Zap Mama sings polyphonic and afro-pop music, a harmonic music with a mixture of infused African vocal techniques, urban, hip hop with emphasis on voice. The worldwide success of Zap Mama, and an ensemble of female polyphonic singers, inspired influences in American hip hop, nu-soul, jazz and elements of pop. The evolving musical compositions created a diverse band of singers and musicians for Zap Mama. \\"The voice is an instrument itself,\\" says Daulne. \\"It's the original instrument. The primary instrument. The most soulful instrument, the human voice. Singing songs in French and English with African World Music Roots.\\" Sources of Zap Mama's music Sources of Zap Mama's music include Daulne's roots in the Democratic Republic of Congo, her upbringing in Belgium, and her return to Africa to rediscover her musical roots. =Democratic Republic of Congo= Marie Daulne, the daughter of a Belgian father and a Congolese mother, was born in the East Zaire City of Isiro. Marie had only been born a few days when her father was killed by the Simba rebels, during the Congo Crisis. The Crisis resulted in the deaths of some 100,000 people. It led to the assassination of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, as well as a traumatic setback to the United Nations, following the death of UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld in a plane crash as he sought to mediate. Marie's mother, with brother and sisters had to survive hiding in the forest. Several months later, they were airlifted out to Isiro in an emergency evacuation by Belgian paratroopers. Marie and her family were flown to Belgium, because her father was a Belgian citizen. =Belgium= Growing up in Belgium was not easy for the family. \\"There were few black people in Belgium,\\" says Daulne. \\"It became easier as I grew older\\". There were black role models seen in music and sports. In the home, the Congolese culture remained present through traditional songs, which her mother and sisters sang together. The loving paternal family of Marie's Belgian father, provided liturgical music and the Walloon popular songs. From early adolescence, Marie trained and competed in track, field and volleyball with athletic aspirations to one day compete in the International Olympics. . Marie is a graduate of the Academie Royale des Beaux Arts de Bruxelles and the Nationale Superieure des Arts Visuales de La Cambre. Daulne also trained in modern dance, choreography and acrobatics at the Ecole du Cirque, and briefly attended the Antwerp School of Jazz. Although Daulne remembers that her mother sang some songs from Congo Kinshasa around the house, her mother did not teach them to the children, stressing mastery of French instead. Daulne listened to European music as she grew up. \\"We had the radio when I was growing up in Belgium, so we heard a lot of French music. And of course, American music was also very popular all over Europe. Since our mother did not want us to watch TV in our home, we entertained ourselves by creating our own music. We were very musical.\\" Daulne was introduced to black music watching television. \\"When I was growing up, there weren't many black people in Europe -- my family was alone. Then I saw an American musical comedy with black people on TV. And I couldn't believe it. I said, \\"That's us!\\" My whole fantasy life was based on that movie.\\" Daulne felt a special connection to blues songs like \\"Damn Your Eyes\\" by Etta James. \\"When I was a teenager I listened to a lot of American blues,\\" she says. \\"That song brought me happiness while I was going through the pain of a broken love. It helped me to open the door and see the life in front of me. I sing it now and I hope, in my turn, that I can help another teenager to do the same if they are having pain from love.\\" When Daulne was 14 she went to England and first heard reggae. \\"I discovered Bob Marley -- my favorite album was Kaya. I know that whole album by heart.\\" Then Daulne became interested in the rap music of Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys. \\"I was into breakdancing at the time. I formed a gang, and we would beatbox like the Americans, like the Fat Boys.\\" After Daulne left home she remembered the African songs her mother sang to her as a child. \\"When I left home, I missed those songs, and in the school choir, I wondered why we didn't use African harmonising. So my sister and I started to sing African melodies, and Zap Mama was born. I wrote my first song at 15, and my artist friend Nina said that what we were doing was amazing. She helped me to find a gig, and from that day, it has been non-stop.\\" But Daulne didn't really get interested in singing until an accident left her unable to participate in athletics. \\"I wanted to be a runner, but then I broke my leg and I was finished with sports. I stayed at home, listening to music. I was recording sounds all the time -- I would listen to sounds repeating for hours. But there was something that I needed still, and that's when I decided to go to Africa, to the forest.\\" =Return to Africa= In the documentary film Mizike Mama, Daulne and her family recall a reverse cultural tug-of-war for her allegiance during her childhood. Her mother feared that Daulne would grow up too African and so did not teach her tribal songs. However the Belgian side of her family encouraged Daulne to explore her African heritage.New York Times. \\"Djembefola.\\" September 15, 1993. Daulne first heard a recording of traditional pygmy music when she was 20. She decided to return Congo-Kinshasa in 1984 to learn about her heritage and train in pygmy onomatopoeic vocal techniques. \\"When I went to the Congo, I hadn‚Äôt thought of being a musician. Not at all. But I was there, and I was standing in the middle of the forest, hearing the music that had been a part of my earliest memories, and it was like an illumination, like a light,\\" Daulne said.Zap Mama. \\"Zap My Message = Zap Mama Welcome Page + Zap Marie = Zap Mama Bio.\\" Daulne made further trips to Africa. \\"I go all around Africa. I started where I was born, in the forest of Zaire. After that I branched out to West Africa, South Africa, East Africa. It [is] very easy for me to learn because all African cultures seem to have something in common the music and the voices,\\" Daulne says. Although Daulne draws inspiration from Africa, she does not call Africa home. \\"You know when I went back to Congo, I thought I would have a welcome like I was part of the family, part of the country, but that was not the case,\\" Daulne said. \\"They treated me like a Belgian come to visit as a tourist. I saw that that is not especially a place to call home.\\" Marie Daulne, the founder and leader of Zap Mama, says her mission is to be a bridge between the European and the African and bring the two cultures together with her music. Daulne specializes in polyphonic, harmonic music with a mixture of heavily infused African instruments, R&B;, and Hip-hop. Daulne emphasizes voice in all her music, as she says \\"the voice is an instrument itself.\\" Daulne's music has evolved over the years from an a cappella quintet to a lead voice accompanied by instruments. \\"I‚Äôm a nomad. I like to discover my sound with different instruments, different genres. For me it‚Äôs normal. My name is Zap Mama...it‚Äôs easy for me to zap in from one instrument to another, a culture, a style. I‚Äôm more a citizen of the world, not an American or Belgian.\\" Zap Mama has released seven full-length albums: Zap Mama (1991) (re-released in 1993 as Adventures in Afropea 1, minus the single track Etupe), Sabsylma (1994), Seven (1997), A Ma Zone (1999), Ancestry in Progress (2004), Supermoon (2007), and ReCreation (2009) that fall into four cycles. =First Cycle: Adventures in Afropea 1 and Sabsylma= When Daulne returned to Belgium, she spent several years singing in Brussels in jazz cafes. In 1989, she founded the group Zap Mama to merge the African and European aspects of her identity. Daulne auditioned scores of female singers looking for the right combination of voices for an a cappella ensemble. \\"When I did my first album, I was looking for girls that were the same mix as me--African and European,\\" she says. \\"I wanted to put these two sounds together to prove that to have blood from white and black was perfect harmony on the inside.\\" The five vocalists‚Äî Marie Daulne, her sister Anita, Sylvie Nawasadio, Sabine Kabongo, Angelique Willkie (who else?) --combined the sounds of Congolese Pygmies with vocal styles of European choral traditions. The original idea of Zap Mama was \\"five singers who would be one,\\" Marie Daulne said. \\"There is no chief.\\" \\"The power of voices was my thing,\\" Daulne said. \\"I wanted to show the world the capacity of five women exploring...our voices and our minds, nothing else.\\" Zap Mama performed their first concert in 1989. In 1991, the group recorded their first record, Zap Mama, at Studio Daylight in Brussels, Belgium. The album was released by Crammed Discs, the Belgian record label of Marc Hollander and Vincent Kenis (who produced the album). In 1992, Zap Mama came to the United States for the first time to perform at New Music Seminar in New York. There, they met David Byrne and agreed to let him reissue Zap Mama's first recordings as Adventures in Afropea 1 on Luaka Bop Records. By the end of the year, Billboard announced it was the top seller for \\"world music.\\" Zap Mama went on tour, playing New York's Central Park, Paris' Olympia, the Montreux Jazz Festival. After the success of Adventures in Afropea 1, Zap Mama split from Luaka Bop Records over artistic difference. According to Daulne, the record company \\"wanted to mold us into a poppy girl band, but I said, 'No, you'll kill me', and I stopped. Everyone was asking why I wanted to stop when we'd finally arrived at the top. But I felt that it was completely wrong. I wasn't ready. I wasn't strong enough. The manager said that if I stopped then, I'd be killing my career, but it was my decision.\\" The next album Sabsylma (Crammed Discs, 1994) featured Indian, Moroccan, and Australian influences and earned Zap Mama a Grammy nomination for Best World Music Album. Daulne explained that the sharper sound of Sabsylma was due to the increasing influence of American music, as a result of being on the road. \\"We've been touring so intensively. Adventures in Afropea 1 was a soft, African record with a natural, round sound. Sabsylma is hectic, sharper. Not on purpose, mind you. I can't help it. If you're driving in a van for months, and you constantly hear the sounds of traffic, TV, hard rock on the radio ... those sounds hook up in your ears, and come out if you start to sing.\\" In the studio, Daulne used an organic process of improvisation to create her music. \\"I'm always looking for sounds. Most of the time, I work with colors. Each sound needs different colors of voices. I dissect sounds, cut them in little pieces, order them, and reassemble them,\\" says Daulne. \\"During the rehearsals, we light some candles, start a tape- recorder, close our eyes, and start making up a story. On that, we start adding sounds. We let ourselves go. We are carried away by the music.\\" While Zap Mama worked on Sabsylma in the studio, Director Violaine de Villers made a documentary, Mizike Mama (1993), presenting a portrait of the group. The film focuses on Daulne as the driving force behind the group and discusses the implications of membership in a racially mixed group that consciously fuses African rhythms and vocal tones with European polyphony. =Second Cycle: Seven and A Ma Zone= After the success of the first two albums, Daulne put her career on hold for a few years to birth and mother her daughter Kesia. Upon returning to her music, Daulne moved in a new direction. She chose to record Seven as the sole remaining member of the original Zap Mama. Her music had evolved stylistically as well. Adventures in Afropea 1 and Sabsylma had both been largely a cappella, but Seven broke with the past by including male musicians and vocalists, an increased number of instruments, and more songs in English. \\"I'm looking for instruments that have vocal sounds, forgotten instruments like the guimbri... The first and second albums were about the voice, what came before. This album is about introducing those sounds into modern, Western life,\\" says Daulne. The title of Seven (1997) refers to the seven senses of a human being. When Daulne traveled to Mali in 1996, she had learned the Malian belief that in addition to the five senses known in the West, some have a sixth sense of emotion. \\"But not everyone has the seventh. It is the power to heal with music, calm with color, to soothe the sick soul with harmony. [The man who taught me about this belief] told me that I have this gift, and I know what I have to do with it,\\" Daulne says. Daulne's next album was A Ma Zone (1999). The title is a wordplay meaning both \\"Amazone,\\" the female warrior, and \\"A Ma Zone,\\" (in my zone) which \\"means that I feel at ease wherever I am,\\" Daulne says. \\"Naturally an Amazon is a rebel, a fighter who, once she has set her heart on something, pulls out all the stops to achieve her goal. I feel this way as well when I'm standing on the stage with the group-- as a team we share the same aim of winning over the audience with our music,\\" Daulne says. That same year, Zap Mama made \\"Iko-Iko\\" for Mission: Impossible 2 soundtrack, a cover of \\"Jock-A-Mo\\" by Sugar Boy & the Cane Cutters. =Third Cycle: Ancestry in Progress and Supermoon= Daulne (center) performs with Zap Mama at Bumbershoot 2007 in Seattle on September 3, 2007 Daulne moved to New York in 2000. \\"I've never been welcome in any country as my own country,\\" says Daulne. \\"In Europe, they talk to me as if I'm from Congo. In Congo, they act like I'm from Europe. The first time I felt at home was in New York. I said, ‚ÄòHere is my country. Everybody is from somewhere else. I feel so comfortable here.'\\" Ancestry in Progress (2004) reflects Daulne's new life in the United States, as it synthesizes her traditional African and European influences with American musical styles like hip-hop and R&B.; \\"The American beat is a revolution all over the world,\\" Daulne says. \\"Everybody listens to it and everybody follows it. But the beat of the United States was inspired by the beat coming from Africa. Not just its structure, but the sound of it. This is the source of modern sounds, the history of the beat, starting from little pieces of wood banging against one another, and arriving on the big sound-systems today. It's genius. So I wanted to create an album about the evolution of old ancestral vocal sounds, how they traveled from Africa, mixing with European and Asian sounds, and were brought to America.\\" Ancestry in Progress (2004) reached #1 on the Billboard World Music Album chart. A music video for the single \\"Bandy Bandy,\\" featuring Erykah Badu, directed by Bill Fishman and produced by David Herrera (music video director), aired on VH1. After four years in the United States, Daulne moved back to Belgium and now calls Brussels home. \\"I lived in the United States from 2000 to 2004 and it is a place with so many stars. When I met a lot of big celebrities I realized I was not a big star and that I didn't want to be, because your life would be a habit, stuck in this and that. I prefer the singularity. I prefer to be me.\\" Daule finds life easier in Belgium. \\"With my family...my children, the people I love ‚Äî that is home.\\" Daulne still draws inspiration from her travels. \\"Currently, I feel the need to go to England, because a lot of interesting things are happening over there. In my band, there are a lot of young musicians who teach me completely new things. They challenge me - and that is the way I like it,\\" Daulne says. In Supermoon (2007), Daulne's vocals take center stage. \\"When the audience appreciates the art of the artist, the audience becomes the sun and makes the artist shine as a full moon,\\" says Daulne. Supermoon is also one of Daulne's most personal statements with songs like \\"Princess Kesia,\\" an ode to her daughter and a reflection on her growth. \\"With Supermoon, I reveal the way I chose to live when I started my career,‚Äù says Daulne. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very intimate‚Ä¶You‚Äôre seeing me very close up. I hope that‚Äôs a kind of intimacy that people will understand. I‚Äôm opening a door to who I am.\\" \\"I always used to hide myself, and I'm not complaining about it, but now it is time to show my eyes and my femininity and my delicate side,\\" said Daulne. \\"I am proud to be so feminine, because I have taken the time to develop...my femininity. Now that I have that, I can face anybody. And if anybody challenges me, there is no problem.\\" =Fourth Cycle: ReCreation= In 2009, Zap Mama released her latest album, ReCreation, which celebrates her tradition of worldwide influences and expresses her new attitude toward her life and music. Daulne describes the inspiration behind the album as her realization that she was learning and experiencing \\"something new all the time.\\" The album's title refers to recreation in two senses of the world, both as a renewal of the self and as pleasurable relaxation and enjoyment. Almost every song on the album features a collaboration with another artist, including G. Love, Vincent Cassel, and Bilal. ReCreation was nominated by the NAACP Image Awards for Outstanding World Music Album.

She heads the UTS Centre for Social Justice and Inclusion. Ms Firth was the Chief Executive Officer of the Public Education Foundation in Australia and is a former politician. Firth served as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing the electorate of Balmain for the Labor Party from 2007 to 2011. During this period, she served as Minister for Women, Minister for Science and Medical Research, and Minister Assisting the Minister for Health (Cancer) from 2007 to 2008, Minister for Climate Change and the Environment in 2008, and as the Minister for Education and Training from 2009 to 2011. Career Firth became a member of the Labor Party at the age of 15. She studied at North Sydney Girls High between 1986 and 1991, before studying Arts/Law at the University of Sydney between 1992 and 1998. While at university, she was active in student politics. After graduating, she worked as a political staffer, prior to working as an articled clerk at Slater & Gordon in 2001; she then worked as a campaign organiser for the Australian Labor Party (2001‚Äì2004). Between 2004 and 2007, she practised as a solicitor with Slater & Gordon, specialising in asbestos litigation and industrial law. Firth was elected as a councillor of the City of Sydney in 2004. During her tenure on Council, she served for a period as Deputy Lord Mayor. Prior to entering state politics, she served on the board of the Law and Justice Foundation and Aidwatch. Firth was elected to the new seat of Balmain on 24 March 2007. Though there was a swing away from the Labor, she won the seat with a majority of just below 4%. She was sworn in on 2 April 2007, receiving simultaneous appointment as Minister for Women, Minister for Science and Medical Research, Minister Assisting the Minister for Health (Cancer) and Minister Assisting the Minister for the Environment, Climate Change and Water (Environment). On 22 February 2008, Phil Koperberg, Minister for the Environment, Climate Change and Water, resigned from cabinet due to ill health. Firth was subsequently appointed as Minister for Environment and Climate Change. Following the caucus election of Nathan Rees as Leader of the NSW Labor Party and Premier in September 2008 and ensuing New South Wales government reshuffle, Firth was appointed as Minister for Education and Training. She won early praise for her demand to the federal government that it fund state public schools to the same level as private schools. During her tenure as Education Minister, she was regarded as a future Labor leader. Firth retained the Education portfolio under Rees' successor, Kristina Keneally. During early 2009, the then Rees Labor Government announced the CBD Metro project. Controversial from the start, the CBD Metro project dominated the Sydney news for much of the year. Firth received media coverage for her opposition to the CBD metro, in the event that it would mean a bus interchange at Rozelle (due to the urban density of the area). Firth was also perceived as being at odds with economically conservative sections of the NSW Cabinet after her opposition to the privatisation of Sydney Ferries became public; at the time, the option of privatising Sydney's ferry fleet was examined by the NSW government against the opposition of unions and some residents. The Keneally government subsequently announced that the ferries would not be privatised. Firth was defeated by Jamie Parker (representing the NSW Greens) as the Member for Balmain at the 2011 state election. After her defeat, Firth considered returning to work as a solicitor. Instead, however, she was appointed as CEO of the Public Education Foundation, an advocacy organisation providing scholarships for students in need of financial assistance. In May 2014, Firth won Labor preselection for the seat of Balmain in the 2015 state election. She lost the election to the sitting member, Jamie Parker of the Greens.http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/nsw-state-election-2015/nsw- election-2015-greens-pull-ahead-of-labor-to-secure-seat-of- balmain-20150328-1m9h3k.html Personal life Firth grew up in West Pymble and in Glebe. She lives in Glebe with her husband Matthew Chesher and their two children. Her brother is Charles Firth, a comedian and member of The Chaser. Her aunt is Meredith Burgmann, the former NSW upper house president. Firth is the great-granddaughter of Anglican Bishop Ernest Burgmann. In January 2011 Firth's husband, Matthew Chesher, was charged by police for possession of the illegal drug, ecstasy. Chesher resigned immediately as chief of staff to Minister for Roads David Borger. Firth said she was \\"angry, hurt and very disappointed\\". Verity refused to say how many tablets Chesher was buying and refused to say whether she had ever taken drugs. Chesher was charged with the possession of one ecstasy tablet and subsequently placed on a 12-month good-behaviour bond with no conviction being recorded.

The F.9/37 was rejected in favour of other designs. A development of the F.9/37 as a night fighter, for a new Air Ministry Specifications F.29/40 ‚Äì known unofficially as the Gloster Reaper ‚Äì was dropped so that Gloster could concentrate on existing work and on the nascent British jet projects. Design and development Gloster had designed a twin-engined turret-fighter for specification F.34/35 but the single-engined Boulton Paul Defiant for F.9/35 was seen to cover both requirements and the F.34/35 design dropped. Less than two years later, F.9/37 for a \\"twin-engined single-seat fighter with fixed armament\\" was issued. The F.9/37 was designed under the direction of George Carter, his first for Gloster, to F.9/37 (hence the name) as a single-seat fighter carrying an armament of four 0.303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns and two 20 mm Hispano cannon in the nose. Intended for dispersed production by semi-skilled labour, the structure broke down into sub-assemblies. A prototype (military serial L7999) with 1,060 hp Bristol Taurus T-S(a) radial engines flew on 3 April 1939 and demonstrated excellent performance, its maximum speed of being the best recorded by a British fighter at the time. Test flights revealed that the prototype was very manoeuvrable and \\"a delight to fly\\". After being badly damaged in a landing accident in July 1939, it was re- engined with 900 hp Taurus T-S(a)-IIIs in 1940, which reduced its performance. A second prototype (L8002) with 880 hp Rolls-Royce Peregrine I liquid-cooled, inline engines flew on 22 February 1940; it proved capable of at . =F.18/40 and F.29/40= Specification F.18/40, for a specialist night fighter, with nose- and turret-mounted guns, led to Gloster submitting a design based on the F.9/37, fitted with Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, a dorsal four-gun turret and Airborne Interception (AI) radar. This received support from the Air Staff who saw it as superior to the Bristol Beaufighter and the Air Ministry ordered one of the F.9/37 prototypes to be converted to the new specification as F.29/40. Unofficially known as the Gloster Reaper, it inherited the admirable handling characteristics of the F.9/37 and despite being judged superior to other designs, including turreted variants of the Beaufighter and de Havilland Mosquito, the Reaper was terminated in May 1941, for Gloster to concentrate on other work, especially the Gloster E.28/39 jet aircraft.

The image develops from Early Christian art, as a depiction of the Heavenly throne as described in 1 Enoch, Daniel 7, and The Apocalypse of John. In the Byzantine world, the image developed slightly differently into the half-length Christ Pantocrator, \\"Christ, Ruler of All\\", a usually unaccompanied figure, and the Deesis, where a full-length enthroned Christ is entreated by Mary and St. John the Baptist, and often other figures. In the West, the evolving composition remains very consistent within each period until the Renaissance, and then remains important until the end of the Baroque, in which the image is ordinarily transported to the sky. Development Traditio legis, or \\"transmission of the law,\\" Christ as lawgiver, mosaic, Basilica of San Lorenzo, Milan, 4th century, includes a scroll box at Christ's feet. From the latter part of the fourth century, a still beardless Christ begins to be depicted seated on a throne on a dais, often with his feet on a low stool and usually flanked by Saints Peter and Paul, and in a larger composition the other apostles. The central group of the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus of 359 (Vatican) is the earliest example with a clear date. In some cases Christ hands a scroll to St Peter on his right, imitating a gesture often made by Emperors handing an Imperial decree or letter of appointment to an official, as in ivory consular diptychs, on the Arch of Constantine, and the Missorium of Theodosius I. This depiction is known as the Traditio legis (\\"handing over the law\\"), or Christ the lawgiver ‚Äì \\"the apostles are indeed officials, to whom the whole world is entrusted\\" wrote Saint John Chrysostom.Eduard Syndicus; Early Christian Art; p. 96; Burns & Oates, London, 1962. Hall pp. 78-80 This depiction tends to merge into one of \\"Christ the teacher\\", which also derives from classical images of bearded philosophers. Other Imperial depictions of Christ, standing as a triumphing general, or seated on a ball representing the world, or with different companions, are found in the next centuries. By the seventh century the Byzantine Christ Pantocrator holding a book representing the Gospels and raising his right hand has become essentially fixed in the form it retains in Eastern Orthodoxy today.James Hall, A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art, pp. 92-3, 1983, John Murray, London, \\"Christ Triumphant\\" had a separate future development, usually standing, often with both hands raised high. The Deesis mosaic in the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople The Pantocrator figure first became half-length because large versions filled the semi-dome of the apse of many, if not most, decorated churches. A full-length figure would need to be greatly reduced for the head to make maximum impact from a distance (because of the flattening at the top of the semi-dome). The gesture Christ makes has become one of blessing, but is originally an orators gesture of his right to speak.Christ in early examples is Christ the Teacher: the gesture of Christ's right hand is not the gesture of blessing, but the orator's gesture; the identical gesture is to be seen in a panel from an ivory diptych of an enthroned vice-prefect (vicarius), a Rufius Probianus, ca 400, of which Peter Brown remarks, \\"With his hand he makes the 'orator's gesture' which indicates that he is speaking, or that he has the right to speak.\\" Staatsbibliothek Berlin. Illustrated in Peter Brown, \\"Church and leadership\\" in Paul Veyne, editor, A History of Private Life: From Pagan Rome to Byzantium 1987, p 272. The Deesis became standard at the centre of the templon beam in Orthodox churches and the templon's successor, the iconostasis, and is also found as a panel icon. Generally the Pantocrator has no visible throne, but the earlier Deesis does, and at least a single-step dais. The Deesis continues to appear in Western art, but not as often or in such an invariable composition as in the East. Romanesque illuminated manuscript Gospel Book, c.1220 In the West the image showed a full-length enthroned Christ, often in a mandorla or other geometrical frame, surrounded by the symbols of the Four Evangelists, representing the vision of Chapters 4 and 5 of the Book of Revelation. In the Romanesque period the twenty-four elders of the Apocalypse are often seen. Christ also holds a book and makes the blessing gesture, no doubt under Byzantine influence. In both, Christ's head is surrounded by a crossed halo. In Early Medieval Western art the image was very often given a full page in illuminated Gospel Books, and in metalwork or ivory on their covers, and it remained very common as a large-scale fresco in the semi-dome of the apse in Romanesque churches, and carved in the tympanum of church portals. This \\"seems to have been almost the only theme of apse-pictures\\" in Carolingian and Ottonian churches, all of which are now lost, although many examples from the period survive in illuminated manuscripts.Syndicus:143 From the Romanesque period, the image in the West often began to revert to the earliest, more crowded conception, and archangels, apostles and saints, now often all facing inwards towards Christ, appear, as well as the beasts emblematic of the Evangelists and the twenty-four elders. This development paralleled the movement towards a more \\"realistic\\" depiction of the \\"heavenly court\\" seen in the increasingly popular subjects of the Maest√† (the enthroned Virgin and Child) and the Coronation of the Virgin by Christ. A Christ in Majesty became standard carved in the tympanum of a decorated Gothic church portal, by now surrounded by a large number of much smaller figures around the archivolts. In painting, the Ghent Altarpiece is the culmination of the Gothic image, although a minority of art historians believe that in this case it is God the Father, not Christ, who is shown in majesty. Christ in Judgement Florentine mosaic Last Judgement of about 1300 A variant figure, or the same figure in a different context termed Christ in Judgement, depicting Christ as judge, became common in Last Judgements, often painted on the west (rear) wall of churches. Here an enthroned Christ, from the 13th century usually with robes pulled aside above the waist to reveal the wounds of the Passion (a motif taken from images of the Doubting ThomasSchiller, Vol 2, 188-189, 202) sits high in a complex composition, with sinners being dragged down by devils to Hell on the right and the righteous on the left (at Christ's right-hand side) rising up to Heaven. Generally Christ still looks straight forward at the viewer, but has no book; he often gestures with his hands to direct the damned downwards, and the saved up.Emile M√¢le, The Gothic Image: Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century, p 365-76, English trans of 3rd edn, 1913, Collins, London (and many other editions) From the High Renaissance the subject was more loosely treated; Christ and his court take to the clouds, and are distributed with an eye to a harmonious and \\"natural\\" composition rather than the serried ranks of old. From the late Renaissance and through the Baroque, it often forms the upper part of a picture depicting events on earth in the lower register, and as stricter perspective replaces the hieratic scaling of the Middle Ages, Christ becomes literally diminished. Such depictions tend not to be described as \\"Christ in Majesty\\", although they are the linear development of the earlier image; the main subject has become the human events in the foreground, such as the martyrdom of a saint, to which Christ is now a rather distant witness.

Biography He was born in Peeblesshire, Scotland in 1803. Cowan came to Upper Canada in 1834 and settled on a farm at Galt. In 1846, he helped found the Provincial Agricultural Association and Board of Agriculture for Canada West. He purchased a share in the firm Lutz and Cook which manufactured agricultural implements and became a partner after the death of Mr. Cook. When Waterloo County was created, he was part of a group lobbying to have Galt named the chief town instead of Berlin (later Kitchener). Cowan ran unsuccessfully for the seat for Gore division in the legislative council in 1858. In 1860, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for South Waterloo; he was reelected in 1863.

Sri Lankan and Indian origin make up the most significant proportion of Hindus in Denmark, numbering approximately 18,000‚Äì19,000 individuals out of a total population of 5.7 million in 2017. Hindus constitutes about 0.3 percent of the total population. Hinduism is also represented among the ethnic Danish community. About 2,000 Danish ethnic origin, belong to Hindu-related groups and Hindu-inspired groups. However, according to another estimate there are about 12, 000 Hindus in Denmark. History The first Hindus of Sri Lankan Tamil origin came in 1983 because of the escalating conflict in Sri Lanka. It was mostly men, and they were categorized as de facto refugees. Today they have married or have got the family, they had to leave to Denmark, and around half of the Tamils have been granted Danish citizenship. Hindus of Sri Lankan Tamil origin have realized that there will not be any solution to the conflict in Sri Lanka in the near future, and they have begun to rebuild or reorganize some of their cultural and religious representations in Denmark, so they can cope with the requirements of the traditions and Danish society as well. For example, this creates an institutionalized Hinduism, where the temple has become the religious bearer per se (internal representation), and that the bharata-natyam that has its roots in the Ancient Tamil Nadu in Tanjore, has become very popular among all the Tamils (external representation), because it communicates very well with Danish society. Of course, whether Danes know what the term \\"bhakthi\\" means is altogether a different story. Temples There are five Hindu temples in Denmark. In Denmark there are two consecrated Hindu temples: two dedicated to Vinayakar or the Ganesha and the other to the Goddess Abirami apart from the ISKCON temples. Community There are 9 registered Hindu groups in Denmark. Hindus are represented by the organisation Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh (HSS)-Denmark. =Hindu temple attack= In 2011, a Hindu temple in Western Copenhagen was assaulted by a group of young Muslims, throwing stones and breaking windows.

Biography Makashov was born in Levaya Rossosh, Voronezh Oblast. He graduated from the Tashkent Higher Combined Arms Command School, finished the M. V. Frunze Military Academy (with the gold medal), and the General Staff Academy (with the gold medal) during the 1960s. He became major general of the Red Army in 1979, serving in the Caucasus region. In 1989, Makashov was elected to the Supreme Soviet. He ran in the 1991 presidential election as an \\"independent nationalist\\", obtaining 3.74%. He then supported the Soviet coup d'√©tat attempt that took place later in the same year. During October crisis of 1993 he was in charge of the defense of the White House. He organized a people army which, on 3 October, stormed the police cordons, seized the Moscow Mayor's office and attempted to seize the Ostankino Tower. After the rebellion was suppressed, Makashov and a number of other opposition figures were arrested. After the imprisonment and amnesty in 1994, he was elected a deputy to the State Duma as a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (since 1995). =1991 presidential campaign= Makashov ran in the 1991 Russian presidential election. His running mate was Alexey Sergeyev (who had originally been running for president himself). Having made a name for himself after strongly attacked perestroika at the 1990 RSFSR Party Congress, calls for Mashakov to run for president arose in mid-May. Demonstrators at a May 10, 1991 pro-Stalin demonstration in Moscow organized by the conservative movement Yedinstvo were reported by the media to have called for Mashakov to run. Several military units in Central Russia endorsed him as a candidate. On May 14, 1991 Makashov announced that he would run for president. Makashov declared his goal as president would be to preserve Russia as a power by insuring that it be strong and wealthy. He promised that would fight for the preservation of a strong Soviet Union and its armed forces. He also promised that to restore law and order to Russian society. He opposed the privatization of Russian industries, arguing that enterprises should instead be placed under the control of worker collectives. He additionally proposed changing the RSFSR's political system so that its parliament and its local soviets would be elected by workers' collectives rather than through popular elections. Considered to be a hard-liner, during his campaign Makashov publicly exchanged heated debate with reformers such as Aleksandr Yakovlev. He also attacked liberal media, accusing them of distributing anti-military propaganda. Makashov's campaign politics were characterized as neo-Stalinist. He was considered to be a military zealot. Mashakov's campaign appealed to a core base of neo- Stalinists. His candidacy received the backing of neo-Stalinist Nina Andreyeva. Two of the groups which Makashov intended to focus on getting the votes of were military personnel and \\"patriotic\\" Russians. A third group he intended to focus on were members of the workforce who were worried by Yeltsin's economic proposals. In order to appeal to this third group, Makashov's campaign repeatedly referenced \\"social defense\\" in the transition to a market economy. Accusations of antisemitism Jewish associations and a number of commentators have accused Makashov of being antisemitic. According to a report produced by the Anti-Defamation League and the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, Makashov \\"has become infamous worldwide for his anti-Semitic outbursts blaming Jews for the country's economic problems, and advocating the establishment of a quota on the number of Jews allowed in Russia.\\" The Jewish Week stated that Makashov \\"has long revelled in unabashed anti-Jewish rhetoric\\". Makashov was accused of appearing on TV to \\"advocate the extinction of the 'Zhyds', and he promised to take at least 10 Zhyds with him into the next world.\\" According to Alexander Saley, a communist deputy from Tatarstan and ally of Makashov, \\"He was misquoted. [He] was quite specific in addressing specific people but the media put it in a more general way. Among Makashov's closest friends are quite a few Jews.\\" After the general's call for expulsion of all Jews at a public meeting in 1999, there were attempts to prosecute him for hate speech; the newspaper Kommersant ran an article about him named \\"Makashov ‚Äî Zoological Antisemite\\". David Duke, who visited Moscow in 1999, met Makashov and expressed his support for the General. Makashov was among the signatories of the \\"Letter of 500\\", which was described as \\"an appeal to the prosecutor general urging him to review the activity of all Jewish organizations in Russia due to their alleged extremism\\" against non-Jews. The open letter was published in January 2005 in Rus Pravoslavnaya, a Russian Orthodox newspaper. Amongst the 500 signatures, Makashov was among 19 members of the State Duma (five from the Communist Party, and 14 from the Rodina Party). Makashov defended the letter in an appearance on a televised debate show hosted by Vladimir Solovyov on 3 February 2005; 53 percent of the more than 100,000 viewers who called the station maintained that Makashov got the better of his debate opponent‚Äî Alexei Leonov‚Äî who denounced Makashov for ethnic incitement.

Jaekel was born in Neusalz (Nowa S√≥l), Prussian Silesia. He studied geology and paleontology in Liegnitz (Legnica). After graduating in 1883, he moved to Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw) and studied under Ferdinand Roemer until 1885. Karl von Zittel awarded a PhD to Jaekel in Munich in 1886. Between 1887 and 1889, Jaekel was an assistant of E.W. Benecke at the Geologisch-Pal√§ontologisches Institut in Stra√üburg, where he received his Habilitation. He worked at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t Berlin and at the Geologisch-Pal√§ontologisches Museum (a combined post) from 1894. Jaekel was considered as an ordinary professor of geology at the University of Vienna in 1903, but this was blocked by intrigue. Between 1906 and 1928, Jaekel was a professor at the University of Greifswald,Moore, R.C. (1978): Part T, Echinodermata 2, Crinoidea. Dedication. ‚Äì In: R.C. Moore & C.

He described a second species of Plateosaurus in 1914. During World War I, in which he served as a Hauptmann (Captain) in the 210th Prussian Infantry Regiment, he attempted to re-start excavations at the southern Belgian town of Bernissart, where several dozen specimens of the dinosaur Iguanodon had been dug up in the 1870s.Roolf, Christoph (2004). ‚ÄúDinosaurier-Skelette als Kriegsziel: Kulturgutraubplanungen, Besatzungspolitik und die deutsche Pal√§ontologie in Belgien im Ersten Weltkrieg.‚Äù Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte 27 : 5‚Äì26. Although he eventually succeeded in persuading the German occupation authorities to support his initiative, the attempt had to be abandoned after the German army surrendered in November 1918. After his retirement in Greifswald, Otto Jaekel accepted a position at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou in 1928. He died after a short and unexpected illness in the German Hospital in Beijing.Drevermann, F. (1929): Otto Jaekel ‚Ä† ‚Äì Pal√§ontologische Zeitschrift, Bd. 11 (3): 6 + 13-14, 1 Abb.; Berlin. Pg 6. As a paleontologist, Jaekel specialized in the study of fossil vertebrates, particularly fishes and reptiles. However, 27 of his publications were about echinodermata. In addition, he wrote about politics, literature and art. He was an accomplished painter, and used his skills to produce landscape paintings that illustrate the geology of the Pomeranian coast.

Pure-tone audiometry is a subjective, behavioural measurement of a hearing threshold, as it relies on patient responses to pure tone stimuli. Therefore, pure-tone audiometry is only used on adults and children old enough to cooperate with the test procedure. As with most clinical tests, standardized calibration of the test environment, the equipment and the stimuli is needed before testing proceeds (in reference to ISO, ANSI, or other standardization body). Pure-tone audiometry only measures audibility thresholds, rather than other aspects of hearing such as sound localization and speech recognition. However, there are benefits to using pure-tone audiometry over other forms of hearing test, such as click auditory brainstem response (ABR). Pure-tone audiometry provides ear specific thresholds, and uses frequency specific pure tones to give place specific responses, so that the configuration of a hearing loss can be identified. As pure-tone audiometry uses both air and bone conduction audiometry, the type of loss can also be identified via the air-bone gap. Although pure-tone audiometry has many clinical benefits, it is not perfect at identifying all losses, such as ‚Äòdead regions‚Äô of the cochlea and neuropathies such as auditory processing disorder (APD). This raises the question of whether or not audiograms accurately predict someone's perceived degree of disability.  Pure-tone audiometry procedural standards  The current International Organization for Standardisation (ISO) standard for pure-tone audiometry is ISO:8253-1, which was first published in 1983. The current American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard for pure-tone audiometry is ANSI/ASA S3.21-2004, prepared by the Acoustical Society of America. In the United Kingdom, The British Society of Audiology (BSA) is responsible for publishing the recommended procedure for pure-tone audiometry, as well as many other audiological procedures. The British recommended procedure is based on international standards. Although there are some differences, the BSA- recommended procedures are in accordance with the ISO:8253-1 standard. The BSA-recommended procedures provide a \\"best practice\\" test protocol for professionals to follow, increasing validity and allowing standardisation of results across Britain. In the United States, the American Speech‚ÄìLanguage‚ÄìHearing Association (ASHA) published Guidelines for Manual Pure-Tone Threshold Audiometry in 2005.  Variations  There are cases where conventional pure-tone audiometry is not an appropriate or effective method of threshold testing. Procedural changes to the conventional test method may be necessary with populations who are unable to cooperate with the test in order to obtain hearing thresholds. Sound field audiometry may be more suitable when patients are unable to wear earphones, as the stimuli are usually presented by loudspeaker. A disadvantage of this method is that although thresholds can be obtained, results are not ear specific. In addition, response to pure tone stimuli may be limited, because in a sound field pure tones create standing waves, which alter sound intensity within the sound field. Therefore, it may be necessary to use other stimuli, such as warble tones in sound field testing.http://www.emedicine.com/ent/topic311.htm [Accessed on 27/02/07] There are variations of conventional audiometry testing that are designed specifically for young children and infants, such as behavioral observation audiometry, visual reinforcement audiometry and play audiometry.http://michiganotoplasty.com/understanding-deafness-pta-testing/ [Accessed on 07/18/15]. Conventional audiometry tests frequencies between 250 hertz (Hz) and 8 kHz, whereas high frequency audiometry tests in the region of 8 kHz-16 kHz. Some environmental factors, such as ototoxic medication and noise exposure, appear to be more detrimental to high frequency sensitivity than to that of mid or low frequencies. Therefore, high frequency audiometry is an effective method of monitoring losses that are suspected to have been caused by these factors. It is also effective in detecting the auditory sensitivity changes that occur with aging.  Cross hearing and interaural attenuation  Figure 1: Interaural attenuation with air conduction. Figure 2: Interaural attenuation with bone conduction When sound is applied to one ear the contralateral cochlea can also be stimulated to varying degrees, via vibrations through the bone of the skull. When the stimuli presented to the test ear stimulates the cochlea of the non-test ear, this is known as cross hearing. Whenever it is suspected that cross hearing has occurred it is best to use masking. This is done by temporarily elevating the threshold of the non-test ear, by presenting a masking noise at a predetermined level. This prevents the non-test ear from detecting the test signal presented to the test ear. The threshold of the test ear is measured at the same time as presenting the masking noise to the non-test ear. Thus, thresholds obtained when masking has been applied, provide an accurate representation of the true hearing threshold level of the test ear.Katz J. Clinical Handbook of Audiology. 5th ed. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2002. A reduction or loss of energy occurs with cross hearing, which is referred to as interaural attenuation (IA) or transcranial transmission loss. IA varies with transducer type. It varies from 40 dB to 80 dB with supra-aural headphones. However, with insert earphones it is in the region of 55 dB. The use of insert earphones reduces the need for masking, due to the greater IA which occurs when they are used (See Figure 1). Air conduction results in isolation, give little information regarding the type of hearing loss. When the thresholds obtained via air conduction are examined alongside those achieved with bone conduction, the configuration of the hearing loss can be determined. However, with bone conduction (performed by placing a vibrator on the mastoid bone behind the ear), both cochleas are stimulated. IA for bone conduction ranges from 0-20 dB (See Figure 2). Therefore, conventional audiometry is ear specific, with regards to both air and bone conduction audiometry, when masking is applied.  Pure-tone audiometry thresholds and hearing disability  Pure-tone audiometry is described as the gold standard for assessment of a hearing loss Sindhusake D, Mitchell P, Smith W, Golding M, Newall P, Hartley D, et al. Validation of self-reported hearing loss. The Blue Mountains Hearing Study. Int. J. Epidemiol. 2001;30:1371-78. but how accurate pure-tone audiometry is at classifying the hearing loss of an individual, in terms of hearing impairment and hearing disability is open to question. Hearing impairment is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a hearing loss with thresholds higher than 25db in one or both ears. The degree of hearing loss is classified as mild, moderate, severe or profound. The results of pure-tone audiometry are however a very good indicator of hearing impairment. Hearing disability is defined by the WHO as a reduction in the ability to hear sounds in both quiet and noisy environments (compared to people with normal hearing), which is caused by a hearing impairment. Several studies have investigated whether self-reported hearing problems (via questionnaires and interviews) were associated with the results from pure-tone audiometry. The findings of these studies indicate that in general, the results of pure-tone audiometry correspond to self-reported hearing problems (i.e. hearing disability). However, for some individuals this is not the case; the results of pure-tone audiometry only, should not be used to ascertain an individual's hearing disability.Hietamen A, Era P, Henrichsen J, Rosenhall U, Sorri M, Heikkinen E. Hearing among 75-year old people in three Nordic localities: A comparative study. Int. J. Audiol. 2004;44:500-08.Uchida Y, Nakashima T, Ando F, Niino N, Shimokata H.

Otolaryngol. 2003;123:618-26. leftthumb500pxFigure 10: Speech recognition threshold (SRT) with noise. To aid explanation of this concept the CHL and the SNHL have the same magnitude of hearing loss (50 dBHL). The horizontal part of the curves is where the noise is inaudible. Thus, there is no masking effect on the SRT. The horizontal portion of the curve for the SNHL and CHL extends further than that for a normal hearing person, as the noise needs to become audible to become a problem. Thus, more noise has to be applied, to produce a masking effect. At the right hand side of the graph, to identify 50% of the speech correctly, the speech needs to much more intense than in the quiet. This is because at this end of the graph, the noise is very loud whether the person has a hearing loss or not. There is a transition between these two areas described. Factor A is a problem only in low noise levels, whereas Factor D is a problem when the noise level is high. Hearing impairment (based on the audiogram) and auditory handicap (based on speech discrimination in noise) data was reviewed by Reinier Plomp . This led to the formulation of equations, which described the consequences of a hearing loss on speech intelligibility. The results of this review indicated that there were two factors of a hearing loss, which were involved in the effect on speech intelligibility. These factors were named Factor A and Factor D. Factor A affected speech intelligibility by attenuating the speech, whereas Factor D affected speech intelligibility by distorting the speech. Speech recognition threshold (SRT) is defined as the sound pressure level at which 50% of the speech is identified correctly. For a person with a conductive hearing loss (CHL) in quiet, the SRT needs to be higher than for a person with normal hearing. The increase in SRT depends on the degree of hearing loss only, so Factor A reflects the audiogram of that person. In noise, the person with a CHL has the same problem as the person with normal hearing (See Figure 10). For a person with a Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in quiet, the SRT also needs to be higher than for a person with normal hearing. This is because the only factor that is important in quiet for a CHL and a SNHL is the audibility of the sound, which corresponds to Factor A. In noise, the person with a SNHL requires a better signal-to-noise ratio to achieve the same performance level, as the person with normal hearing and the person with a CHL. This shows that in noise, Factor A is not enough to explain the problems of a person with a SNHL. Therefore, there is another problem present, which is Factor D. At present, it is not known what causes Factor D. Thus, in noise the audiogram is irrelevant. It is the type of hearing loss that is important in this situation. These findings have important implications for the design of hearing aids. As hearing aids at present can compensate for Factor A, but this is not the case for Factor D. This could be why hearing aids are not satisfactory for a lot of people. Audiograms and hearing loss The shape of the audiogram resulting from pure-tone audiometry gives an indication of the type of hearing loss as well as possible causes. Conductive hearing loss due to disorders of the middle ear shows as a flat increase in thresholds across the frequency range. Sensorineural hearing loss will have a contoured shape depending on the cause. Presbycusis or age-related hearing loss for example is characterized by a high frequency roll-off (increase in thresholds). Noise- induced hearing loss has a characteristic notch at 4000 Hz. Other contours may indicate other causes for the hearing loss.

Bulgaria Bulgaria has deployed 608 troops in Afghanistan, as well as medical personnel. Belgium In 2002, a tri-national detachment known as the European Participating Air Forces of 18 Danish, Netherlands and Norwegian F-16 ground attack fighters aircraft deployed to Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan to support operations in Afghanistan. Belgium contributed a C-130 Hercules and four F-16 aircraft. Currently Belgium has around 550 troops stationed in Afghanistan, mainly in Kabul, Kunduz and Kandahar airport. Bosnia and Herzegovina Bosnia and Herzegovina deployed a unit of 37 men to destroy munitions and clear mines, in addition to 6 command personnel, as part of the Multinational force in Iraq. The unit was first deployed to Fallujah, then Talil Air Base, and is now located at Camp Echo. In December 2006, the Bosnian government formally extended its mandate through June 2007. Bosnia and Herzegovina is planning to send another 49 soldiers from the 6th infantry division to Iraq in August 2008, their mission will be to protect/guard Camp Victory in Baghdad. Canada In 2002, Canada had 2,100 personnel in the CENTCOM region (1,100 land, 225 air (6 aircraft) and 700 naval personnel (3 ships)). Ground troops included elements of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Regiment and Royal Canadian Regiment, and JTF2 special forces. Since initial deployments supporting OEF, Canadian forces have supported OEF and ISAF. Since the summer of 2006, the expanded Canadian force supported the NATO ISAF mission in south Afghanistan. Exit strategy: Canada had pledged to stop its military operations there by the end of 2014. And had begun logistical preparations to end any substantive combat role by the end of 2011 People's Republic of China The People's Republic of China has provided mine-clearance and police training for Afghan Security Forces, but has resisted international pressure to deploy troops to the country. The Chinese government considers Afghanistan a quagmire, and fears that if troops were to be deployed, rising casualties would provoke massive antiwar sentiment in China, due to the One Child Policy.Newsweek: 21 November 2009 Issue Republic of the Congo The Republic of the Congo offered the United States and allies logistical support. Cyprus Cyprus offered the United States and allies use of its airspace and airports. Also, the United Kingdom used its RAF bases in their Sovereign Base Areas in Atrokiri and Dhekelia to stage attacks and aid the ground forces. Czech Republic Since April 2007, a 35-man deployment of the Czech Military Police's Special Operations Group was deployed to Helmand Province to support British forces under ISAF command in a variety of force protection and Direct Action tasks. In 2011, The Czech deployment was increased with a full deployment of a Special Operations Task Group, including the 601st Special Forces Group under the newly formed ISAF SOF (Special Operations Forces) Command.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.141 Provided training and material support for allied Afghan forces (donation of Mi-17 and Mi-24 helicopters to ANA). Sent 3 times a Special Forces Detachment (601st Special Forces Group). Other activities in ISAF ‚Äì field hospital, KAIA airfield command, PRT Logar, force protection for German PRT and Dutch PRT. Denmark Since 2002 the number of ground forces committed by the Danish army has been steadily increased from 50 to 750 soldiers and support staff. These forces include a tank platoon with 3 Leopard 2 model 2A5DK tanks. The majority of the Danish forces are deployed in the Helmand Province operating in the Gerishk District as part of the ISAF force under UK command. The Danish forces have suffered substantial casualties including 43 deaths up till January, 2013. This is currently the highest level of casualties compared to the contribution size. Additionally Danish J√¶gerkorpset special forces have been deployed at various times ‚Äì including a substantial number in 2002. In 2002, a tri- national detachment known as the European Participating Air Forces of 18 Danish, Netherlands and Norwegian F-16 ground attack/fighter aircraft deployed to Manas in Kyrgyzstan to support operations in Afghanistan. Denmark contributed 6 F-16 aircraft. Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen, prime minister of Denmark (2009-2011), said his country's commitment depends on whether Afghanistan's 7 Nov. presidential runoff produces a credible leader (the run off was cancelled). Egypt Egyptian Field Hospital at Bagram: Egypt opened an Egyptian Field Hospital at Bagram in 2003. The hospital treats more than 7,000 Afghans per month. Treatment is provided free of charge. 31 percent of the hospital's patients are children. link: Egyptian Field Hospital at Bagram Also, Egypt offered the use of its airspace. Estonia Estonia offered the use of its airspace and provided logistical support in theatre. Estonia deployed about 150, and later a further 250, to Afghanistan.Estonia Extends Afghan Mission Through 2008 France Over 4,000 personnel including the Marine Nationale (one CVBG, comprising the Charles de Gaulle, frigates La Motte-Picquet, Jean de Vienne and Jean Bart, the nuclear attack submarine Rubis, the tanker Meuse and the aviso Commandant Ducuing) 3,200 ground troops and 350 from the Arm√©e de l'Air (12 Mirage 2000, Mirage F1 and Mirage IV ground-attack and reconnaissance aircraft). The first deployed French force was composed of soldiers from the 21st Marine Infantry Regiment deployed on 17 November 2001, to Mazar-e Sharif. French special forces operators have served in Afghanistan since the formation of ISAF, in 2003 150 COS operators were deployed to replace the Italian ISAF contingent, the COS primarily conducted reconnaissance and close-protection tasks. In 2001 and beginning again in the summer of 2003, 200 soldiers from various units of the Army Special Forces Brigade (BFST), along with marine and air commandos, have conducted operations against the Taliban, under command and in co-operation with U.S. special operations forces present in the area. French forces have since supported the ISAF mission. Between 2003 and 2007, a 200-man COS unit operated under direct ISAF SOF command of OEF-A, their tasks were restricted to what author Stephen Saideman said was \\"short-term counter terrorism and counterinsurgency raids\\" rather than longer Special Reconnaissance missions, nor were they allowed to conduct partnered operations. Despite the restrictions, French SOF operators were carried out a large number of successful Direct Action operations, often in joint operations with American and sometimes British special forces. The French special forces contribution to OEF-A ended in 2007 after disputes over its role. In August 2008, France took over control of the Kabul regional command. Ten French troops were killed and a further 21 wounded in an attack ‚Äì the heaviest loss of troops France has suffered since deploying to Afghanistan in 2002 ‚Äì it was announced on 19 August. In 2009, a 150-man French special forces task group deployed operating directly for the French ISAF contribution and also conducted significant mentoring of Afghan security forces. As of 17 September 2011, 75 French soldiers have died. All French forces left Afghanistan in 2012. Georgia Georgia deployed 174 troops to Afghanistan, and deployed 1,900 peacekeepers in 2010 for peacekeeping and counter-terrorism operations. A total of 750‚Äì800 soldiers are being deployed since 2010, making Georgia the highest net contributor per capita to the coalition forces. Germany In 2002, Germany had 2,560 personnel in the region. The German Navy has had three Frigates, one Fast Patrol Boat Group (five units) and four supply ships operating out of Djibouti, in the Gulf of Aden. A German Airbus A310 aircraft was on alert in Germany for use as a medevac platform. German forces have since supported the ISAF mission. Although nominally under OEF command, the KSK worked under ISAF command since 2005, carrying out numerous operations in the vicinity of the German deployment in Kabul, including a successful raid on an al-Qaeda safehouse for suicide bombers in October 2006. GSG9 is also deployed to the Kabul area, providing specialist close protection to German officials and facilities. KSK operators have commented in the German media about the restrictions placed on them by their national caveats and stated that a preference for working directly for the Americans as part of OEF-A as they had done as part of Task Force K-Bar.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.142 Greece Greek naval vessels have supported the ISAF since 2002. Hungary Hungary deployed a total of 3000 troops in 2019, and a special forces battalion. India India had offered all operational assistance to the United States, including use of its facilities, in any operations launched in pursuit of the perpetrators of the 11 September attack. Importantly Indian intelligence officials provided the United States with needed information concerning the financing and training of Islamic extremist groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Indian government had also offered the United States the use of its territory for staging any military operations in Afghanistan. On the naval front, India provided a frigate for escorting coalition shipping through the Straits of Malacca, made shipyards available for coalition ship repairs and opened ports for naval port calls. India offered the US its air bases and provided the Northern Alliance with logistical support. The Indian Army opened a hospital in Tajikistan, to treat injured Northern Alliance soldiers. India also loaned Mi-17 helicopters to the Northern Alliance. Iran Iran, having viewed the Taliban as a bitter enemy, aided coalition forces in an uprising in Herat. Ireland Ireland has permitted U.S. military aircraft to use Shannon Airport as a refuelling hub. Also, Ireland has seven troops deployed to the Isaf's headquarters in Kabul. Italy The Italian aircraft carrier and French aircraft carrier seen from (1 February 2002) Italy deployed Col Moschin and Gruppo Operativo Incursori (GOI) to Afghanistan, Italian Special Operations Forces were not under US-led OEF-A command, instead it operated directly in support of the Italian ISAF Task force-Nibbio, where they carried out local force protection and reconnaissance tasks. At the peak of its deployment, Italy had 4,200 troops stationed in Afghanistan at any given time. Italian naval warships including its only Carrier Battle Group (with the aircraft carrier ) supported combat operations in the North Arabian Sea. Italy deployed a 43-man engineer team to Bagram, Afghanistan to repair the runway in May 2002. Japan Japan provided logistical support on coalition forces and financial, reconstruction and development support. Kuwait Kuwait provided basing and overflight permissions for all U.S. and coalition forces. Kyrgyzstan Kyrgyzstan allowed US and allied aircraft to use Manas Air Base. Latvia Provided logistical support. Lithuania 40 Special Forces AITVARAS troops, from November 2002 to 2004. After 2005 Lithuania has deployed up to 268 soldiers. Most of them were deployed in PRT Chaghcharan. Lithuanian special forces were involved in Special Reconnaissance missions, since 2006 they have been in action in southern Afghanistan with British forces.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.143 North Macedonia North Macedonia has 244 troops in Afghanistan. Malaysia Malaysia provided use of its airspace and logistical support. Montenegro Montenegro was scheduled to deploy 40 soldiers, a three-member medical team, and two officers under German command to Afghanistan in 2010. Netherlands The Netherlands deployed 165 KCT operators backed up by 4 Dutch Chinooks in 2005 under the direct command of OEF-A. In 2006 under ISAF mandate, the KCT deployed to Tarinkot in Uruzgan Province to work alongside Australian forces, the KCT conducted long-range reconnaissance and specialist intelligence gathering for both the Dutch Battle Group and ISAF SOF command.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , pp.143-144 The Netherlands help in 2006 included a build, fight and air support mission in Afghanistan with 2100 soldiers. In 2010 all Netherlands troops returned home and a few months later they began a police training mission with the Marechaussee and the Task Force. The Netherlands troops are members of the ISAF. New Zealand The Royal New Zealand Navy frigate HMNZS Te Mana operates as part of Task Force 150 in the north Arabian Sea New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark announced in April 2008 that there would be additional New Zealand troops sent to the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Banyan Province, because of concern over the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan. A member of the NZSAS in Afghanistan, Corporal Bill Apiata, was awarded the Victoria Cross for New Zealand in 2007 for bravery under fire in 2004. Three other SAS soldiers also received bravery awards for actions during the same mission; two received the New Zealand Gallantry Decoration and one the New Zealand Gallantry Medal. There are also two C-130 Hercules and one Boeing 757 transport aircraft and an unstated number (about 120) of New Zealand Special Air Service special forces soldiers and 2 ANZAC class frigates in the Persian Gulf. In November 2007, a nephew of New Zealand's Minister of Defence Phil Goff died in Afghanistan; he was United States Army Captain Matthew Ferrara, who held both American and New Zealand citizenship. In July 2008, the sixth Australian soldier died in Afghanistan, New Zealand-born SAS Signaller Sean McCarthy. The decision was made in August 2009 that NZSAS troops would be sent back to Afghanistan. Exit strategy: The Government of New Zealand is working on an exit plan to pull all New Zealand troops out of Afghanistan. Norway Norwegian SOF, commanded by ISAF, has been in Afghanistan since 2001. In 2002, a tri-national detachment known as the European Participating Air Forces of 18 Danish, Dutch and Norwegian F-16 ground attack fighters aircraft was deployed to Manas International Airport in Kyrgyzstan to support operations in Afghanistan. Norway contributed four to six F-16s. Also deployed from Norway were logistic teams, mine clearance teams, special forces groups (from HJK and MJK) and several C-130 transport aircraft. Norway also has an army training base located in Afghanistan. Currently, they have lost one soldier in an RPG attack and one special forces lieutenant in a shoot-out with hostile gunmen.Aftenposten Newspaper: Taliban threaten more attacks in Afghanistan Aftenposten Newspaper: \\"Fallen soldier comes home\\" Norway has also lost six soldiers in bomb attacks, including four KJKs in the same attack. Norway redeployed F-16 ground attack aircraft in 2006 as part of a joint Dutch-Norwegian unit supporting expanded NATO operations in Afghanistan.13 February 2006: Dutch-Norwegian cooperation in Kabul ‚Äì Netherlands MoD Currently Norway has a little more than 500 soldiers stationed in Afghanistan, mainly in the North and in Kabul. Oman Oman offered the United States and allies use of its airspace and air bases. Pakistan Pakistan has been helping in the war against the Taliban. Pakistan and Iran agreed to open borders to receive the expected increased migration of refugees from Afghanistan. Earlier, Pakistan had supported the Taliban, especially during the 1996‚Äì1998 period when they were establishing control ‚Äì later relations between the two were not as close. After the 9/11 attacks, Pakistan allocated three airbases to the United States for the invasion of Afghanistan. USA depends on Pakistan for a route to Afghanistan to supply the ISAF forces more than any source. Poland A 40-man JW GROM element deployed to Afghanistan in early 2002, in 2007 both Grom and JW Komandos√≥w were deployed to Kandahar (after earlier successful tours of Iraq operating alongside US Navy SEALs) under direct US Command. They weren't restricted by any national caveats-the only restriction placed on them was regarding cross-border operations into Pakistan. Along with Direct Action successes, they were considered very effective in training and mentoring Afghan National Police units.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , pp.144-145 Poland has approximately 2,500 troops, mainly from Wojska LƒÖdowe, and 10 helicopters stationed primarily in Ghazni province.

In January 2006, Defence Secretary John Reid announced the UK would send a PRT with several thousand personnel to Helmand for at least three years. This had been planned as part of the gradual expansion of ISAF's area of responsibility from the Kabul region to the rest of Afghanistan. An initial strength of 5,700 personnel in Afghanistan was planned, which would stabilise to around 4,500 for the rest of the deployment.

An additional 212 buildings were destroyed in a later citywide fire, on December 8, 1794.

Because the fire started on Good Friday, priests refused to allow church bells to be rung as a fire alarm.Asbury, H., The French Quarter, Garden City Publishing Co., Inc., 1938, p. 54. Within five hours it had consumed almost the entire city as it was fed by a strong wind from the southeast. The fire destroyed virtually all major buildings in the then-city (now French Quarter), including the church, municipal building, army barracks, armory, and jail. Colonial Governor Esteban Rodr√≠guez Mir√≥ set up tents for the homeless. The fire area stretched between Dauphine Street and the Mississippi River and between Conti Street in the south and St. Philip Street in the north. It spared the riverfront buildings including the Customs House, the tobacco warehouses, the Governor's Building, the Royal Hospital, and the Ursuline Convent. Colonial officials were to replace the wooden buildings with masonry structures which had courtyards, thick brick walls, arcades, and wrought iron balconies. Among the new buildings were the central New Orleans (now Jackson Square) fixtures of St. Louis Cathedral, the Cabildo, and the Presbytere. The funds and supervision for the Cathedral and the Cabildo were provided by Don Andres Almonaster y Rojas. The Cabildo burned in the 1794 fire and had to be reconstructed. The Presbytere was built on a somewhat later basis, and Almonaster died before it could be completed.Arthur, Stanley C. Old New Orleans: A History of the Vieux Carr√©, Its Ancient and Historic Buildings. Westminster, Maryland: Heritage Books; copyrighted 1936, reprinted 2007. Governor Miro's report summarized the suffering: After six years of rebuilding, on December 8, 1794, another 212 buildings were destroyed in the Great New Orleans Fire of 1794.

The Imperial Ethiopian Navy =Founding of the navy= Ethiopia acquired a coastline and ports on the Red Sea in 1950 when the United Nations decided to federate Eritrea with Ethiopia. In 1955, the Imperial Ethiopian Navy was founded,Gray, Randal, ed., Conway‚Ä≤s All the World‚Ä≤s Fighting Ships 1947‚Äì1982, Part II: The Warsaw Pact and Non-Aligned Nations, Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 1983, , p. 304. and its first (and primary) base ‚Äî the Haile Selassie I Naval Base ‚Äî was established at Massawa in 1956. The navy took delivery of its first ship in 1957. By the early 1960s workshops and other facilities were under construction at Massawa to give it complete naval base capabilities. =Organization= In 1958, the navy became a fully independent service, organized as one of the three Ethiopian armed services - alongside the Ethiopian Army and Ethiopian Air Force - under the overall command of the Chief of Staff of the Imperial Armed Forces. The navy's deputy commander had his naval headquarters in Addis Ababa. The navy was conceived and built as a coastal navy for patrolling the Red Sea coast. =Training and education= The Imperial Ethiopian Navy's personnel were among the best trained in the world.Harpoon Headquarters: Ethiopian Naval Forces Even before Ethiopia took control of Eritrea, the British Royal Navy had seconded Ethiopian personnel to its bases in Eritrea to provide them with naval training. A naval college, where Ethiopian naval officers undertook a 52-month program of study, was founded at Asmara in 1956; each class admitted averaged 30 to 40 students in size, and they graduated with a naval commission and a bachelor of science degree. In 1957, a Naval Non-Commissioned Officer School was established at Massawa as well. A Frogman/Diving School for the training of a special commando unit and a Ratings' Training Establishment for the training of naval enlisted men also were established at Massawa by the late 1950s or early 1960s. Centers to provide enlisted men with training in technical specialities were established at Aseb, Asmara, and Massawa. Emperor Haile Selassie I appointed 25 Royal Norwegian Navy officers to help in organizing Ethiopia's new navy, and they oversaw much of the training. Retired British Royal Navy officers also served as trainers and advisers during Haile Selassie's reign. Some Imperial Ethiopian Navy officers received naval education at the Italian Naval Academy in Livorno, Italy, while others attended the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. =Forces= The United States Navy seaplane tender off Houghton, Washington, on 6 February 1944. She served in the Ethiopian Navy as the training ship Ethiopia from 1962 to 1993 and was its largest ship. Personnel By 1958, the Imperial Ethiopian Navy had 129 personnel, increasing to 1,200 in 1970. At its peak, the Imperial Ethiopian Navy had a force of 11,500 personnel. All enlisted men served seven-year enlistments as volunteers. Ships The navy operated a mix of patrol boats, torpedo boats, and small submersible boats transferred from the United States Navy and the navies of European countries. The Imperial Ethiopian Navys first ship was a former U.S. Navy PC-1604-class submarine chaser, ex-, transferred to Ethiopia on 2 January 1957 via a loan scheme involving Italy and transferred to Italy on 3 May 1959. The Ethiopian ship was named after Zerai Deres, citato in Allafrica.com famous national patriot considered a folk hero. In 1962 the United States transferred the former seaplane tender to Ethiopia; renamed Ethiopia (A-01) and placed in service as a training ship, she was the Ethiopian Navys largest ship throughout her 31 years of service. Haile Selassie in the uniform of the Ethiopian Navy. =Bases= The Imperial Ethiopian Navy established four bases: Massawa was the site of the naval headquarters and enlisted training facilities; the naval air station and naval academy were at Asmara; Assab was the site of a naval station, enlisted training facilities, and a repair dock; and there was a naval station and communications station on the Dahlak Islands in the Red Sea near Massawa. The Ethiopian Navy in the communist era Monument at the former headquarters of the Ethiopian Navy (2012 photo) Haile Selassie was deposed in 1974, and during the Communist-run governments of the Provisional Military Administrative Council or Derg of 1974 to 1977 and of Mengistu Haile Mariam that followed from 1977 to 1991, the Ethiopian Navy - no longer \\"Imperial\\" - was reoriented toward the Soviet Union. Officers continued to train in Ethiopia, but selected naval officers continued their studies at the Soviet naval academy in Leningrad and at Baku. After the Soviet Union was expelled from Somalia for supporting Ethiopia against Somalia in the Ogaden War in 1978, it established naval bases at Assab and on the Dahlak Islands and began to base Soviet Naval Aviation aircraft at Asmara International Airport; in addition, Soviet naval personnel took posts as instructors at the Ethiopian naval academy. Enlisted men continued to train at Massawa and served a seven- year enlistment. In 1982, the Ethiopian Navy had about 1,500 personnel. The turn to the Soviet Union meant that the navy became a largely Soviet-equipped force. Although Ethiopia continued in her role as a training ship and remained Ethiopia's largest naval vessel, the United States ceased arms sales to Ethiopia in 1977, and Soviet-built patrol boats and missile boats began to replace other ships. By 1991, the Ethiopian Navy had two frigates, eight missile craft, six torpedo craft, six patrol boats, two amphibious craft, and two support and training craft, mostly of Soviet origin. After the Derg seized power, the navys six UH-1 helicopters were transferred to the Ethiopian Air Force. At some point, the post-Imperial navy reportedly acquired two Soviet- made - perhaps Mil Mi-8 (NATO reporting name \\"Hip') or Mil Mi-14 (NATO reporting name \\"Haze\\") - helicopters. The navy also operated a coastal defense brigade equipped with two truck-mounted P-15 Termit (USDoD designation \\"SSC-3\\"; NATO reporting name \\"Styx\\") coastal defense antiship cruise missile launchers. =Operations= Eritrean opposition to Eritreas inclusion in Ethiopia broke out in a full-scale rebellion after the Derg took power in 1974, and this left the Ethiopian Navy in the difficult position of having all of its bases deep in rebel territory and on the front line of the Eritrean War of Independence. In April 1977, the navy lost the Cape-class patrol boat P-11, with reports blaming the loss both on a storm and on an attack by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF). If she was lost to EPLF action, P-11 was the only Ethiopian Navy ship ever lost in combat. The Ethiopian Navy contributed nothing to Ethiopias victory over Somalia in the Ogaden War of 1978, and Mengistu increasingly began to divert resources from the navy to the Ethiopian Army and Ethiopian Air Force. As a result, the Ethiopian Navy began to decline further in its capabilities. The Ethiopian Navy lost both its main port and its highway connection to the Ethiopian interior when the EPLF captured Massawa in March 1990, forcing the navys headquarters to move inland to Addis Ababa. The Eritrean rebellion spread to the Dahlak Islands, where the EPLF damaged the Petya II-class frigate F-1616 beyond repair. EPLF successes left Ethiopian Navy bases increasingly isolated as 1990 wore on. By the spring of 1991, the navys ships had begun to use ports in Djibouti, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen because of the danger of returning to their home bases. In late May 1991, the EPLF captured Asmara and surrounded Assab, where fire from its ground forces sank seven Ethiopian Navy ships in port. On 25 May 1991, the 14 Ethiopian Navy ships capable of putting to sea fled Assab, ten of them steaming to Yemen and the others to Saudi Arabia, leaving behind seven ships and a variety of small craft. Assab fell to the EPLF soon after. The end of the Ethiopian Navy Disused monument and fountain on the grounds of the former headquarters of the Ethiopian Navy, in Guele, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The facilities now serve as the headquarters of the East African Standby Force (EASF), East Africa's contribution to the African Standby Force. The monument now faces a housing block used by staff and students attending EASF.The Ethiopian Civil War and Eritrean War of Independence both ended in 1991 soon after the fall of Assab, and Eritrea became independent, leaving Ethiopia landlocked. The Ethiopian Navy remained in existence, left in the curious and unusual position of having no home ports. Nonetheless, directed by its headquarters in Addis Ababa, it continued occasional patrols in the Red Sea from ports in Yemen. In 1993, Yemen finally expelled the Ethiopian ships; by then some had deteriorated too much to be seaworthy, and the Ethiopians left them behind in Yemen. Ethiopia had become a hulk after arriving in Yemen in 1991 and was sold for scrap in 1993; other Ethiopian ships were also scrapped or scuttled. Those ships which could get underway from Yemen in 1993 moved to Djibouti. For a time it was thought that the Ethiopian Navy might survive, based at Assab in Eritrea or at Djibouti, and Ethiopia even requested that Eritrea lease it pier space at Assab from which to operate the surviving Ethiopian Navy. Eritrea refused the request. Proposals also were made for Eritrea and Ethiopia to divide the ships, with ships manned by both countries operating from Eritrean ports as a kind of successor to the Ethiopian Navy, but Eritrea soon expressed a desire to organize an entirely separate Eritrean Navy. By 1996, Djibouti had tired of having a foreign navy in its ports. The Ethiopian Navy had fallen behind in paying its harbor dues, and under this pretext Djibouti seized all of the remaining ships on 16 September 1996 and put them up for auction to pay the back dues. Eritrea expressed interest in 16 of them, but finally limited itself to purchasing only four of them - an Osa- II class missile boat and three Swiftships Shipbuilders patrol craft - in order to avoid exacerbating an international crisis with Yemen. The rest of the ships were scrapped. Later in 1996, the Ethiopian Navys headquarters in Addis Ababa disbanded, and the Ethiopian Navy ceased to exist. Its only remnant is the patrol boat GB-21; moved inland to Lake Tana and manned by Ethiopian Army personnel, she survived as of 2009 as Ethiopias only military watercraft. Potential revival In June 2018, newly installed Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed called for the eventual reconstitution of the Ethiopian Navy as part of a wider programme of security sector reforms, saying that \\"we should build our naval force capacity in the future\\". In March 2019, Abiy Ahmed signed defence accords with France's Emmanuel Macron, including on support in establishing a naval component.

A cultural bond of the German Lower Rhine region is its Low Franconian language, specifically the Cleverlander dialect (Dutch: Kleverlands, German: Kleverl√§ndisch), which is closely related to the Dutch dialects of South Guelderish just across the border and East Bergish to the southeast. In the region's southern portion Bergish is spoken, which is the easternmost dialect of Limburgish.

It is also known as the Honsh≈´ wolf. Its binomial name derives from the Greek Hodos (path) and phylax (guardian), in reference to Japanese folklore, which portrayed wolves as the protectors of travellers. It was one of two subspecies that were once found in the Japanese archipelago, the other being the Hokkaido wolf. Etymology The name ≈çkami (wolf) is derived from the Old Japanese √∂p√∂-kam√Ø, meaning \\"great-spirit\\".Kokugo Dai Jiten, Revised Edition 1988 (in Japanese), T≈çky≈ç:Shogakukan In the Shinto religion, wild animals were associated with the mountain spirit Yama-no-kami. Taxonomy and origin Coenraad Jacob Temminck's depiction of the animal. This may actually represent a yamainu (mountain dog), as the mounted specimen which it was based on was labeled as such by Siebold, who had encountered both mountain dogs and wolves. =Nomenclature: \\"≈çkami\\" and \\"yamainu\\"= Before Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck classified it, it had been long recognized in Japan that Honshu was inhabited by two distinct canids; ≈çkami (wolf) and yamainu (mountain dog), both of which were described by the herbalist Ono Ranzan in his Honz≈ç k≈çmoku keim≈ç (‚ÄúAn instructional outline of natural studies‚Äù) in 1803. He described the ≈çkami as an edible, but rapacious, greyish-brown animal with a long, ash-colored, white-tipped tail with webbed toes and triangular eyes that would occasionally threaten people if rabid or hungry. In contrast, the yamainu was described as a similar animal, but with speckled yellowish fur, unwebbed toes, a foul odor and inedible meat. Ranzan's works were studied by German botanist Philipp Franz von Siebold during his tenure in Dejima. He purchased a female mountain dog and a wolf in 1826, describing both in his notes as distinct, and preparing two sketches illustrating their differences. The skin of the mountain dog was subsequently shipped to the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in the Netherlands and mounted. The specimen, along with Siebold's notes, were used by Temminck as references for his scientific classification of the animal in Fauna Japonica (1839). Temminck, however, misinterpreted Siebold's notes distinguishing the wolf and the mountain dog and treated the two as synonyms. In 1842, he wrote a longer description, still confounding the two names, and producing a sketch of a \\"wolf\\" based on Siebold's mounted mountain dog specimen. =Skeletal and genetic findings= Mounted skeleton, National Museum of Nature and Science Skull in the Ueno Zoo, Japan Mounted specimen in Ueno Zoo The Japanese wolf, or Honsh≈´ wolf, (Canis lupus hodophilax Temminck, 1893) is a subspecies of the gray wolf (Canis lupus). Skeletal remains of the Japanese wolf have been found in archaeological sites, such as Torihama shell mounds, dating from the J≈çmon period (10,000 to 250 B.C). The Japanese wolf was not the world's smallest wolf. The cranial length of the adult Arab wolf (Canis lupus arabs) measures on average 200.8 mm, which is smaller than most wolves. Specimens of the Japanese wolf were measured between 193.1 mm and 235.9 mm and it was uncertain if these were all from adults. In the mandible, M1 (molar tooth) is relatively larger than in any other canid species.Miyamoto F, Maki I (1983) On the repaired specimen of Japanese wolf (Canis lupus hodophilax Temminck) and its skull newly taken out. Bull Fac Ed Wakayama Univ Nat Sci 32: 9‚Äì16 (in Japanese with English abstract) An examination in 1991 found one specimen's condylobasal length (a measure of skull length) to be 205.2mm, and the Alveolar length of P4 (the fourth maxillary premolar or carnassial tooth) to be 20.0mm (left) and 21.0mm (right).Miyamoto, F.

(in Japanese with English abstract) In 2009, an osteological study declared that the skull of the Japanese wolf was between 206.4 mm to 226.0 mm in total length, and that morphological characters alone were not sufficient to distinguish the Japanese wolf from large domesticated dogs, such as the Akita breed. Remains of the wild native canine dating from the late Edo period (1603 and 1868), the Yama-Inu, has occasionally been confused with the Japanese wolf because of the osteological similarities between the two.Obara I, Nakamura K (1992) Notes on a skull of so-called \\"Yama-Inu\\" or wild canine preserved in the Minamiashigara municipal folklore museum. Bull Kanagawa Pref Mus Nat Sci 21: 105‚Äì110 (in Japanese with English abstract) The Japanese wolf inhabited Kyushu, Shikoku, and Honshu Islands but not Hokkaido Island. This indicates that its ancestor may have migrated from the Asian continent through the Korean Peninsula into Japan. The phylogenetic tree generated from its mitochondrial DNA sequences revealed a long branch that separated the Japanese wolf from other gray wolf populations and that it belongs to the ancient mDNA haplogroup 2 (represented today by the Italian wolf and scattered pockets of other wolves across Eurasia), while the Hokkaido wolf belongs to mDNA haplogroup 1 and this suggests that the Japanese wolf was the first arrival on the Japanese archipelago with the Hokkaido wolf arriving more recently from the north. The wolf was estimated to have arrived in Japan during the Late Pleistocene between 25,000‚Äì125,000 years ago, however a more recent study that looked at the past sea levels of the Korean Strait together with the timing of the Japanese wolf sequences indicated that it arrived to the southern islands less than 20,000 YBP. :See further: Evolution of the wolf ‚Äì North America and Japan An examination of sequences from 113 ancient Canis specimens from China and Russia did not match, which indicated that none of these specimens were the ancestors of the Japanese wolf. Analyses of the mitochondrial DNA of 1576 dogs worldwide revealed that one Kishu and one Siberian husky possessed the same haplotype as a Japanese wolf, indicating past cross-breeding. A more- refined study of Japanese wolf mitochondrial DNA showed that they could be further divided into two separate groups, and that the sequences from one Kishu, one Siberian husky and one Shiba Inu could also be divided into the two groups. These dogs correspond to clade F of the mDNA phylogenetic tree among worldwide dogs, with clade F haplogroup dogs originating from a rare admixture between male dogs and more than one female ancestor of Japanese wolves, which have contributed to the dog gene pool. :See further Dog-Wolf hybridization Range Carl Hubert de Villeneuve's sketch of Siebold's captive specimen, probably the only authentic European depiction of the species unambiguously identified as a wolf rather than a \\"mountain dog\\" The Japanese wolf inhabited Kyushu, Shikoku, and Honshu Islands but not Hokkaido Island. The remains of a 28,000-year-old wolf specimen from the Yana River on the northern coast of arctic Siberia matched the mDNA haplotype of the Japanese wolf, which indicates that they shared common ancestry and a wider distribution.

History Full moon in Mushasi by Yoshitoshi 1890 The Japanese wolf is considered to be extinct as the last Japanese wolf was captured and killed at Washikaguchi of Higashiyoshino village in Honshu Nara Prefecture, Japan on January 23, 1905. Sightings of \\"short-legged dog like beasts\\", proposed to be the Japanese wolf, have been claimed since the time of its extinction until the last claim in 1997, but none of these have been verified. A claim in 2000 was dismissed as a hoax. Some Japanese zoologists believe that these reports \\"merely derive from misidentification of feral dogs\\". In AD 713, the wolf first appeared on record in Kofudoki itsubun (Lost writings on ancient customs). From AD 967, historical records indicated the wolf's preference for preying on horse, either wild horses or those in pastures, stables, and villages. In 1701, a lord introduced the first wolf bounty and by 1742 the first professional wolf hunters were using firearms and poison. In 1736, rabies appeared among dogs in eastern Japan, indicating that it had entered from China or Korea, then spread across the nation. Shortly after it spread to the wolf population, turning some wolves from simple horse predators to man-killers that led to organized wolf hunts. Killing wolves became a national policy under the Meiji Restoration, and within one generation the Japanese wolf was extinct. Some interpretations of the Japanese wolf's extinction stress the change in local perceptions of the animal: rabies-induced aggression and deforestation of the wolf's habitat forced them into conflict with humans, and this led to them being targeted by farmers. Culture Kitayama Moon by Yoshitoshi.Kitayama moon - Toyohara Sumiaki, from the series One hundred aspects of the moon by Tsukioka Yoshitori. Art Gallery of New South Wales, Australia The wolf drawings were taken from a book illustrated by Yoshitoshi's teacher, Kuniyoshi. The Japanese wolf memorial stands by the banks of the Takami River in Higashiyoshino, Nara and is a replica of the last wolf killed by hunters nearby in 1905. Inscribed is the haiku: I walk/ With that wolf/ That is no more Japanese wolf mounted in Ueno Zoo, Japan (Wakayama University possession) In the Shinto belief, the ≈çkami (\\"wolf\\") is regarded as a messenger of the kami spirits and also offers protection against crop raiders such as the wild boar and deer. Wild animals were associated with the mountain spirit Yama-no-kami. The mountains of Japan, seen as a dangerous, deadly place, were highly associated with the wolf, which was believed to be their protector and guardian. Many mountain villages, such as Okamiiwa (\\"Wolf Rock\\") and Okamitaira (\\"Wolf Plateau\\"), are named after the wolf; this could be due to a sighting at the location, or a simple homage to the species. There are an estimated 20 Shinto wolf shrines on Honshu alone. The most famous national shrine is located at Mitsumine in Chichibu, Saitama Prefecture and there are a number of smaller wolf shrines on the Kii Peninsula, including the Tamaki Shrine and the Katakati Shrine at Totsukawa village. In Japanese folklore, there is the widely recorded belief of the okuri≈çkami (\\"escort wolf\\") that followed someone walking alone through a forest at night until they reach their home without doing them any harm. An offering was sometimes made for this escort. Another belief was of wolves that raised an infant who had been abandoned in the forests of the Kii Peninsula, and later became the clan leader Fujiwara no Hidehira. Another belief from the Kanto area of eastern Japan was that feeding an infant wolf's milk would make them grow up strong. Some legends portray the Japanese wolf as being prophetic creatures. In the Tamaki Mountains the location of a tree called ‚Äúthe cypress of dog-howls‚Äù is said to be the site where wolves howled immediately before a flood in 1889 warning the villagers, and before the great earthquake of 1923 even though the wolf was extinct by that time. Another belief was the \\"wolf notification\\" where a traveller does not return home, then a wolf comes to their home and makes a sad howling that signalled their death. Some villages had wolf charms called shishiyoke that were believed to protect their village and their crops against wild boar. Wolf fangs, hide, and hair were carried by travelers to ward of evil spirits, and wolf skulls were kept in some home shrines to ward off misfortune. In some villages such as in Gifu Prefecture, the skull of the wolf was used as the charm for both protection as well as curing possessed villagers. In addition to protecting the crops, the wolf may leave prey for villagers. The Japanese wolf is the prime concept in the hit 2012 anime movie, Wolf Children, about the life of the last Japanese wolf who can turn into a human, and a human wife who raised their two wolf-human children as a single mother, after her husband was killed.https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-wolf- children-20130927-story.html Claimed post-extinction records Despite the status, there have been various reports of canines resembling Canis lupus hodophilax throughout the 20th century and in the 21st century including a case by foreign tourists.

Cotte means \\"cave\\" in J√®rriais. The cave is also known as L√© Creux √®s F√©es (The Fairies' Cave).Dictionnaire Jersiais-Fran√ßais, Le Maistre 1966 Neanderthals lived there at various times between around 250,000 years ago and after 48,000 years ago‚Äîmaking it the earliest known occupation of the Channel Islands by a hominin species, and also possibly one of the last Neanderthal sites in northwestern Europe. It is the only site in the British Isles to have produced late Neanderthal fossils. At that time, with sea levels slightly below those at present, Jersey was part of Normandy, a peninsula jutting out from the coast, and La Cotte would have been a prominent landmark on the dry plain that linked Jersey to the French mainland. It was not until after the last Ice age that the sea eroded the coastline, separating first Guernsey, then Jersey and finally the √âcr√©hous from the mainland.  Making fire  Remains of fire was found in La Cotte. In fact, the earliest dates obtained for artifacts at the site (238,000 BP) come from thermoluminescence dating of burnt flint.  Cultural evolution  The immense timespan represented by the Paleolithic artifacts at La Cotte‚Äînearly 200,000 years‚Äîsaw considerable cultural changes among the prehistoric users of the site. The earliest stone tools, dated between around 240,000 years to 200,000 BP, are fairly typical of early Middle Paleolithic sites. From around 200,000 BP, however, there is noticeable elaboration in the procedures used to manufacture stone implements, with an increased use of Levallois (prepared core) techniques, and an increased efficiency of raw material usage as tools were resharpened and reused for multiple purposes throughout their ‚Äòlifetimes‚Äô. Dated at approximately 180,000 BP, two impressive piles of animal bones, consisting of selected cuts of mammoths and woolly rhinoceros, appear to have been dragged beneath an overhang after being butchered. These innovations mark a transition stage between Middle and Upper Paleolithic subsistence strategies.  Excavation timeline  La Cotte d√© Saint Br√©lade The rhinoceros skull Excavations have taken place from around 1910 onwards. Robert R. Marett (1866‚Äì1943) worked on the palaeolithic site from 1910‚Äì1914, recovering some hominid teeth and other remains of habitation by Neanderthal man. He published \\"The Site, Fauna, and Industry of La Cotte de St. Brelade, Jersey\\" (Archaeologia LXVII, 1916). The teeth were dated using new techniques in 2013, this analysis put them at between 100,000 and 47,000 years old. In 1911, Arthur Smith Woodward (director of the geology department at the British Museum of Natural History) was asked by R.R. Marrett to inspected the findings at La Cotte. At the time, Woodward was engaged in the archaeological discovery of \\"Piltdown man\\", which later became notorious as a hoax, and he used a comparison of findings at La Cotte to argue for an early dating of his Piltdown material. The Cambridge University excavations of the 1960s and 1970s found important examples of remains of Pleistocene mammals carried into La Cotte, including a pile of bones and teeth of woolly mammoth and woolly rhinoceros. Prince Charles took part (as a student) in these excavations, directed by Professor C.M.B. McBurney, which were later published. Katharine Scott, in 1980, published an article on the hunting methods used by Neanderthals at La Cotte in which she argues that they stampeded and drove the mammoths off the nearby cliffs, but this theory has since been disputed. In 2010 excavations were renewed at La Cotte by a multi-disciplinary team from British Institutions including UCL, The British Museum the University of Southampton and University of Wales Trinity Saint Davids. These on-going excavations revealed new archaeological levels at the site and determined the presence of deposits younger than 47,000 years ago still present at the site.

Universities The first of Aberdeen's two universities, King's College, was founded in 1495 by William Elphinstone (1431‚Äì1514), Bishop of Aberdeen and Chancellor of Scotland. Marischal College was founded in New Aberdeen by George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal of Scotland in 1593. These foundations were amalgamated to form the present University of Aberdeen in 1860. King's and Marischal were Scotland's third and fifth oldest universities respectively. Robert Gordon's College (originally Robert Gordon's Hospital) was founded in 1729 by the merchant Robert Gordon, grandson of the map maker Robert Gordon of Straloch, and was further endowed in 1816 by Alexander Simpson of Collyhill. Originally devoted to the instruction and maintenance of the sons of poor burgesses of guild and trade in the city, it was reorganized in 1881 as a day and night school for secondary and technical education, and in the 1990s became co-educational and a day-only school. It also produced the Robert Gordon Institute of Technology, which in 1992 became the Robert Gordon University. Art and Architecture schools Gray's School of Art, founded in 1886, is one of the oldest established colleges of art in the UK. It is situated in grounds at Garthdee on the edge of the city. It is now incorporated into Robert Gordon University. The Scott Sutherland School of Architecture and The Built Environment (previously the Scott Sutherland School of Architecture; The Scott Sutherland School of Art Architecture and Design) is situated on the Garthdee Campus of the Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, next to Gray's School of Art. Among other full-time and part-time courses; the School runs the a BSc Honours course in Architectural Studies and MArch masters in Architectural Studies. It also has a student-led lecture society and sponsored lecture series called 5710, creating a link between architectural practice and architectural education. Colleges North East Scotland College has several campuses in Aberdeen and offers part-time and full-time courses leading to several different qualifications. It replaced Aberdeen College which was the largest further education institution in Scotland. Northern College was a teacher training college with campuses in Aberdeen and Dundee. In 2000, the Aberdeen campus of Northern College became the University of Aberdeen School of Education. In 2006 the Hilton Campus of Northern College in Aberdeen was sold for housing development and demolished. State schools There are currently 12 secondary schools and 54 primary schools which are run by the city council. The most notable are Cults Academy, Oldmachar Academy and Aberdeen Grammar School which are all rated in the top 20 Scottish secondary schools league tables. Historically, the most famous of Aberdeen's schools is Aberdeen Grammar School, (now a comprehensive). Founded in 1263 it is one of the oldest schools in Britain, and is set in a Scottish baronial style building. It is celebrated as the school of Lord Byron. Private schools There are a number of private schools in Aberdeen; Albyn School for Girls (co-ed as of 2006), St Margaret's School for Girls, the Hamilton School, Robert Gordon's College, the Total S.A. French School (for French oil industry families) and the International School of Aberdeenhttps://www.educators.co.uk/private-schools-aberdeen/. Following investigations by the police and the care commission in 2014, both the Hamilton school and the Waldorf school closed.

The rifle retains many of the proven design elements the institute had used previously in its CETME Model 58 battle rifles.Wo≈∫niak, Ryszard. Encyklopedia najnowszej broni palnej - tom 1 A-F. Bellona. 2001. pp140-141. The weapon was successfully trialled between 1981‚Äì1982 and approved for serial production in 1984 at the Empresa Nacional Santa B√°rbara factory (currently Santa B√°rbara Sistemas, integrated into General Dynamics European Land Combat Systems division).Walter, John: Rifles of the World (3rd ed.), page 83. Krause Publications, 2006. The Model L replaced the 7.62mm CETME Model C in service with the Spanish Army and the first rifles were delivered in 1987, by which time orders for approximately 60,000 had been placed. In 1999 the Model L as now been largely replaced in Spanish service with a license-built variant of the Heckler & Koch G36E. Design details =Operating mechanism= The Model L is a selective fire, roller-delayed blowback firearm. The weapon features a semi-rigid two-piece bolt mechanism that consists of a bolt head and a supporting angular locking piece. During the \\"unlocking\\" sequence, the two cylindrical rollers contained in the bolt head are cammed inward against inclined flanks of the barrel extension and act upon the locking piece and bolt carrier, propelling it rearward at a velocity greater than that of the bolt, which remains closed until the fired bullet has left the barrel and pressures inside the bore have been reduced to a safe level before withdrawing together with the bolt carrier. =Features= The bolt also has a cartridge casing extractor, while the ejector is located inside the trigger housing (the ejector is lifted by a spring in the front of the trigger housing. The recoiling bolt carrier pushes the rear of the ejector down insuring the ejector is lifted into place to insure ejection is timed properly). The weapon is hammer-fired and has a fire control lever, which is also the manual safety. The safety and fire selector lever is located on the left side of the receiver, directly above the pistol grip, and has three settings: \\"S\\" (Spanish: Seguro)‚Äîweapon safe (trigger is disabled mechanically), \\"T\\" (Spanish: Tiro a tiro)‚Äîsemi-automatic fire and \\"R\\" (Spanish: R√°faga)‚Äîfully automatic fire (initial production rifles also had a burst selector option, which was abandoned). The Model L fires from a closed bolt position and uses the NATO-standard 5.56√ó45mm cartridge loaded with the 62-grain SS109 projectile. INI (Instituto Nacional de Industria, a state factory) made ammunition was dirtier and gave much more chamber pressure than standard NATO ammunition, and was one of the sources of reliability problems (hard primers were in part responsible, too). At NATO joint exercises, foreign units tended to be warned not to use Spanish ammo if their rifles were gas operated [sources needed]. The rifle's barrel features 6 right-hand grooves and a rifling twist rate of 1 in 178 mm (1:7 in); it is fitted with an open-type 3-prong flash suppressor, and later a \\"birdcage\\" style one, both designed to launch rifle grenades. The weapon will also mount a knife-type bayonet. The Model L's fixed stock, pistol grip and handguard are made of a high-strength lightweight plastic. The rifle strips down into the following components for regular maintenance and cleaning: the receiver, stock, pistol grip and trigger group, handguard, bolt, bolt carrier and recoil mechanism. Handguards in the first several series were \\"square\\" in section (see LC picture), covering from magazine well to front sight. This gave some problems with heat retention, so it was changed to a round \\"half length\\" handguard made of thicker plastic, over the full length stamped steel support piece. Almost all military rifles changed to the new handguard, but Guardia Civil rifles retained the squared version. =Feeding= The rifle feeds from standard NATO magazines that adhere to STANAG-DRAFT 4179 (interchangeable with magazines from the M16 rifle) and have a 30-round capacity, but it can also use short 12-round box magazines, usually only used for parades (early rifles and carbines were also adapted to use special 20 and 30-round magazines that were of an entirely different design). Issued magazines were steel, but thick walls only gave several problems, like misfeedings, stuck magazines (some could not even be inserted in the rifles), and the like. Although they were supposed to be expendable (a cost of 25 pesetas in 1995), it was forbidden to discard them, and many soldiers were punished for losing a magazine. Spanish soldiers tried to keep magazines known to work well for themselves, or get other STANAG magazines from surplus stores or friends abroad. It was a common sight in NATO joint exercises to see Spanish soldiers searching the zone where US troops discarded their empty mags. Many reliability problems were solved by using these \\"non--issued\\" magazines. =Sights= The CETME Model L is equipped with adjustable iron sights consisting of a forward post (corrected mechanically for elevation) in two versions \\"thick\\" and \\"thin\\" (no official designation). Thin post was better for precision shooting, but it could easily bend if hit. Since it was well protected this wasn't much of a problem, and it was preferred over the thicker version. A flip-up rear sight with two settings for firing at distances of 200 and 400 m (early models had a rotating drum rear sight that provided 100, 200, 300 and 400 m sighting range apertures). The Model LV (Visor) is a marksman variant equipped with a fixed STANAG mount over the rear sight base; the optic generally used in this role is the British SUSAT sight in some units, the standard being a nationally produced 4 power ENOSA scope. A starlight scope was also available. Another model with a rotating drum rear sight used by the Infanteria de Marina was also called LV, leading to some confusion, even in training manual and logistics. The standard rear sight base has a horizontal pin forward, and a circular shallow cavity behind were a detachable scope base could be mounted, but almost never used since not many of these bases were made for general use. =Accessories= Standard equipment supplied with the rifle includes a cleaning kit, sling, bayonet, lightweight bipod, blank-firing adaptor, rifle grenade launcher guide and magazine loader tool. Variants A variant of the Model L is the Model LC carbine that has a short barrel and a collapsible metal shoulder stock, making it particularly suitable for officers, special forces and riot police. These features also allow a high degree of movement in closed spaces or moving vehicles. This carbine version however cannot be used with a bayonet or rifle grenades. Another variant of the Model L is found in the United States; as a fully automatic firearm, it cannot be imported as a machinegun for civilian sale. However, if the receivers are cut in compliance with BATFE rules, all the parts may be imported, and the rifle reassembled from a new US receiver. Some are professionally built for the US civilian market; some are home made, with home builders purchasing stamped flats of the receivers and bending and welding the receivers themselves. MarColMar Firearms LLC (www.marcolmarfirearms.com) makes a civilian legal CETME L for sale in the United States. Utilizing a brand new receiver, a new cold-hammer-forged 1 in 7 and nitrided barrel, Cerakote Elite finish, brand new furniture, and a re- engineered spring package, the remaining original parts sets are used to construct the finished product. The rifle has also been designed to utilize the commonly available NATO STANAG M-16/AR-15 magazine. The CETME L, along with the LC, LV, and LV/S variants are all finished in Spanish green, black, FDE, or grey.

Valve characteristics  Valves are high voltage/low current devices in comparison with transistors. Tetrode and pentode valves have very flat anode current vs. anode voltage indicating high anode output impedances. Triodes show a stronger relationship between anode voltage and anode current. The high working voltage makes them well suited for radio transmitters and valves remain in use today for very high power short wave radio transmitters, where solid state techniques would require many devices in parallel, and very high DC supply currents. High power solid state transmitters also require complex combining and tuning networks, whereas a valve-based transmitter would use a single relatively simple tuned network. Thus while solid state high power short wave transmitters are technically possible, economic considerations still favor valves above 3 MHz and 10,000 watts. Amateurs also use valve amplifiers in the 500-1500 watt range mainly for economic reasons. = Audio vs. RF amplifiers = Valve audio amplifiers typically amplify the entire audio range between 20 Hz and 20 kHz or higher. They use an iron core transformer to provide a suitable high impedance load to the valve(s) while driving a speaker, which is typically 8 Ohms. Audio amplifiers normally use a single valve in class A, or a pair in class B or class AB. An RF power amplifier is tuned to a single frequency as low as 18 kHz and as high as the UHF range of frequencies, for the purpose of radio transmission or industrial heating. They use a narrow tuned circuit to provide the valve with a suitably high load impedance and feed a load that is typically 50 or 75 Ohms. RF amplifiers normally operate Class C or Class AB. Although the frequency ranges for audio amplifiers and RF amplifiers overlap, the class of operation, method of output coupling and percent operational bandwidth will differ. Power valves are capable of high frequency response, up to at least 30 MHz. Indeed, many of the Directly Heated Single Ended Triode (DH-SET) audio amplifiers use radio transmitting valves originally designed to operate as RF amplifiers in the high frequency range. = Circuit advantages of valves = *High input impedance, comparable to that of FETs, higher than in bipolar transistors, which is beneficial in certain signal amplification applications. *Valves are high voltage devices, inherently suitable for higher voltage circuits than most semiconductors. *Valves can be constructed on a scale that can dissipate large amounts of heat, with very high power models designed for water or vapor cooling. For this reason valves remained the only viable technology for very high power, and especially high power/high voltage applications such as Radio & TV transmitters long into the age when transistors had displaced valves in most other applications. However today these also are increasingly obsolete. *Lower investment cost in applications like RF amplifiers above the kilowatt power range Also, large, high value power valves can to some extent be remanufactured to extend residual life. *Electrically very robust, they can tolerate overloads which would destroy bipolar transistor systems in milliseconds (of particular significance in military and other \\"strategically important\\" systems). *Indefinite shelf life. Even 60-year-old tubes can be perfectly functional, and many types are available for purchase as \\"new-old-stock\\". Thus, despite known reliability issues (see below), it is still perfectly possible to run most very old vacuum tube equipment. *Comparative ease of replacement. Being known to be subject to a number of common failure modes, most tubes were designed and installed as plug-in devices, not soldered into a circuit. A failed tube can simply be unplugged and replaced by a user, while the failure of a soldered-in semiconductor may imply damage beyond economic repair for a whole product or subassembly. = Disadvantages of valves = *Cost. For most applications, tubes require both greater initial outlay and running expense per amplification stage, requiring more attentive budgeting of the number of stages for a given application compared to semiconductors. *Short operational life. In the most common applications, valves have a working life of just a few thousand hours, much shorter than solid state parts. This is due various commonplace failure mechanisms: cathode depletion, open or shorts circuits‚Äînotably of the heater and grid structures, cathode poisoning, and physical breakage of the glass envelope. Heater failure most often happens due to the mechanical stress of a cold start. Only, in certain always-on professional applications such as specialized computing and undersea cables, specially designed valves in carefully designed circuits and well cooled environments reached operational lives of tens or hundreds of thousands of hours. *Heater supplies are required for the cathodes. Beside the investment cost, the share of the power budget that goes into heating the cathode without contributing to output can range from few percent points of anode dissipation (in high power applications at full output),http://tubedata.tubes.se/sheets/140/4/4CV35000A.pdf to broadly comparable to anode dissipation in small signal applications. *Large circuit temperature swings in on/off cycles. Massive stray heat from cathode heaters in common low power tubes means that adjoining circuits experience changes in temperature that can exceed 100 ¬∞C / 200 ¬∞F. This requires heat resistant components. In RF applications this also means that all frequency-determining components may have to heat to thermal equilibrium before frequency stability is reached. While at AM broadcast (medium wave) receivers and in loosely tuned TV sets this was not a problem, in typical radio receivers and transmitters with free-running oscillators at HF frequencies this thermal stabilization required about one hour. On the other hand, miniature ultra-low power direct- heated valves do not produce much heat in absolute terms, cause more modest temperature swings, and allow equipment that contains few of them to stabilize sooner. *No \\"instant on\\" from a cold start. Valve cathodes need to heat to a glow to start conducting. In indirect-heating cathodes this could take up to 20 seconds. Apart from temperature-related instability, this meant that valves would not work instantly when powered. This led to development of always-on preheating systems for vacuum tube appliances that shortened the wait and may have reduced valve failures from thermal shock, but at the price of a continuous power drain, and an increased fire hazard. On the other hand, very small, ultra low power direct-heated valves turn on in tenths of a second from a cold start. *Anodes may require dangerously high voltages. *High impedance / low current output unsuitable for direct drive of many real world loads, notably various forms of electric motor *Compared to transistors, valves have the disadvantage of being available in a single polarity only. In most processes transistors are available in complementary polarities (e.g., NPN/PNP), making possible many circuit configurations that cannot be realized with valves. = Distortion = The most efficient valve-based RF amplifiers operate Class C. If used with no tuned circuit in the output, this would distort the input signal, producing harmonics. However, class C amplifiers normally use a high Q output network which removes the harmonics, leaving an undistorted sine wave identical to the input waveform. Class C is suitable only for amplifying signals with a constant amplitude, such as FM, FSK, and some CW (Morse code) signals. Where the amplitude of the input signal to the amplifier varies as with single-sideband modulation, amplitude modulation, video and complex digital signals, the amplifier must operate class A or AB, to preserve the envelope of the driving signal in an undistorted form. Such amplifiers are referred to as linear amplifiers.DRM broadcasts It is also common to modify the gain of an amplifier operating class C so as to produce amplitude modulation. If done in a linear manner, this modulated amplifier is capable of low distortion. The output signal can be viewed as a product of the input RF signal and the modulating signal. The development of FM broadcasting improved fidelity by using a greater bandwidth which was available in the VHF range, and where atmospheric noise was absent. FM also has an inherent ability to reject noise, which is mostly amplitude modulated. Valve technology suffers high-frequency limitations due to cathode-anode transit time. However, tetrodes are successfully used into the VHF range and triodes into the low GHz range. Modern FM broadcast transmitters use both valve and solid state devices, with valves tending to be more used at the highest power levels. FM transmitters operate class C with very low distortion. Today's ‚Äúdigital‚Äù radio that carries coded data over various phase modulations (such as GMSK, QPSK etc.) and also the increasing demand for spectrum have forced a dramatic change in the way radio is used, e.g. the cellular radio concept. Today's cellular radio and digital broadcast standards are extremely demanding in terms of the spectral envelope and out of band emissions that are acceptable (in the case of GSM for example, ‚àí70 dB or better just a few hundred kilohertz from center frequency). Digital transmitters must therefore operate in the linear modes, with much attention given to achieving low distortion.  Applications  = Historic transmitters and receivers = (High voltage / High power) Valve stages were used to amplify the received radio frequency signals, the intermediate frequencies, the video signal and the audio signals at the various points in the receiver. Historically (pre WWII) \\"transmitting tubes\\" were among the most powerful tubes available, were usually direct heated by thoriated filaments that glowed like light bulbs. Some tubes were built to be very rugged, capable of being driven so hard that the anode would itself glow cherry red, the anodes being machined from solid material (rather than fabricated from thin sheet) to be able to withstand this without distorting when heated. Notable tubes of this type are the 845 and 211. Later beam power tubes such as the 807 and (direct heated) 813 were also used in large numbers in (especially military) radio transmitters. = Bandwidth of valve vs solid state amplifiers = Today, radio transmitters are overwhelmingly solid state, even at microwave frequencies (cellular radio base stations). Depending on the application, a fair number of radio frequency amplifiers continue to have valve construction, due to their simplicity, where as, it takes several output transistors with complex splitting and combining circuits to equal the same amount of output power of a single valve. Valve amplifier circuits are significantly different from broadband solid state circuits. Solid state devices have a very low output impedance which allows matching via a broadband transformer covering a large range of frequencies, for example 1.8 to 30 MHz. With either class C or AB operation, these must include low pass filters to remove harmonics. While the proper low pass filter must be switch selected for the frequency range of interest, the result is considered to be a \\"no tune\\" design. Valve amplifiers have a tuned network that serves as both the low pass harmonic filter and impedance matching to the output load. In either case, both solid state and valve devices need such filtering networks before the RF signal is output to the load.  Radio circuits  Unlike audio amplifiers, in which the analog output signal is of the same form and frequency as the input signal, RF circuits may modulate low frequency information (audio, video, or data) onto a carrier (at a much higher frequency), and the circuitry comprises several distinct stages. For example, a radio transmitter may contain: *an audio frequency (AF) stage (typically using conventional broadband small signal circuitry as described in Valve audio amplifier, *one or more oscillator stages that generate the carrier wave, *one or more mixer stages that modulate the carrier signal from the oscillator, *the amplifier stage itself operating at (typically) high frequency. the Transmitter power amp itself is the only high power stage in a radio system, and operates at the carrier frequency. In AM, the modulation (frequency mixing) usually takes place in the final amplifier itself. = Transmitter anode circuits = The most common anode circuit is a tuned LC circuit where the anodes are connected at a voltage node. This circuit is often known as the anode tank circuit. = Active (or tuned grid) amplifier = Simple tetrode-based design using a tuned grid input An example of this used at VHF/UHF include the 4CX250B, an example of a twin tetrode is the QQV06/40A. Neutralization is a term used in TGTP (tuned grid tuned plate) amplifiers for the methods and circuits used for stabilization against unwanted oscillations at the operating frequency caused by the inadvertent introduction of some of the output signal back into the input circuits. This mainly occurs via the grid to plate capacity, but can also come via other paths, making circuit layout important. To cancel the unwanted feedback signal, a portion of the output signal is deliberately introduced into the input circuit with the same amplitude but opposite phase. When using a tuned circuit in the input, the network must match the driving source to the input impedance of the grid. This impedance will be determined by the grid current in Class C or AB2 operation. In AB1 operation, the grid circuit should be designed to avoid excessive step up voltage, which although it might provide more stage gain, as in audio designs, it will increase instability and make neutralization more critical. In common with all three basic designs shown here, the anode of the valve is connected to a resonant LC circuit which has another inductive link which allows the RF signal to be passed to the output. The circuit shown has been largely replaced by a Pi network which allows simpler adjustment and adds low pass filtering.  Operation  The anode current is controlled by the electrical potential (voltage) of the first grid. A DC bias is applied to the valve to ensure that the part of the transfer equation which is most suitable to the required application is used. The input signal is able to perturb (change) the potential of the grid, this in turn will change the anode current (also known as the plate current). In the RF designs shown on this page, a tuned circuit is between the anode and the high voltage supply. This tuned circuit is brought to resonance presenting an inductive load that is well matched to the valve and thus results in an efficient power transfer. As the current flowing through the anode connection is controlled by the grid, then the current flowing through the load is also controlled by the grid. One of the disadvantages of a tuned grid compared to other RF designs is that neutralization is required. = Passive grid amplifier = Simple tetrode-based amplifier using a passive grid input A passive grid circuit used at VHF/UHF frequencies might use the 4CX250B tetrode. An example of a twin tetrode would be the QQV06/40A. The tetrode has a screen grid which is between the anode and the first grid, which being grounded for RF, acts as a shield to reducing the effective capacitance between the first grid and the anode. The combination of the effects of the screen grid and the grid damping resistor often allow the use of this design without neutralization. The screen found in tetrodes and pentodes, greatly increases the valve's gain by reducing the effect of anode voltage on anode current. The input signal is applied to the valve's first grid via a capacitor. The value of the grid resistor determines the gain of the amplifier stage. The higher the resistor the greater the gain, the lower the damping effect and the greater the risk of instability. With this type of stage good layout is less vital.  Advantages  *Stable, no neutralizing required normally *Constant load on the exciting stage  Disadvantages  *Low gain, more input power is required *Less gain than tuned grid *Less filtering than tuned grid (more broadband), hence the amplification of out of band spurious signals, such as harmonics, from an exciter is greater = Grounded grid amplifier = Simple triode-based design using a passive grid input This design normally uses a triode so valves such as the 4CX250B are not suitable for this circuit, unless the screen and control grids are joined, effectively converting the tetrode into a triode. This circuit design has been used at 1296 MHz using disk seal triode valves such as the 2C39A. The grid is grounded and the drive is applied to the cathode through a capacitor. The heater supply must be isolated from the cathode as unlike the other designs the cathode is not connected to RF ground. Some valves, such as the 811A, are designed for \\"zero bias\\" operation and the cathode can be at ground potential for DC. Valves that require a negative grid bias can be used by putting a positive DC voltage on the cathode. This can be achieved by putting a zener diode between the cathode and ground or using a separate bias supply.  Advantages  *Stable, no neutralizing required normally *Some of the power from exciting stage appears in the output  Disadvantages  *Relatively low gain, typically about 10 dB. *The heater must be isolated from ground with chokes. = Neutralization = The valve interelectrode capacitance which exists between the input and output of the amplifier and other stray coupling may allow enough energy to feed back into input so as to cause self oscillation in an amplifier stage. For the higher gain designs this effect must be counteracted. Various methods exist for introducing an out of phase signal from the output back to the input so that the effect is cancelled. Even when the feed back is not sufficient to cause oscillation it can produce other effects, such as difficult tuning. Therefore, neutralization can be helpful, even for an amplifier that does not oscillate. Many grounded grid amplifiers use no neutralization, but at 30 MHz adding it can smooth out the tuning. An important part of the neutralization of a tetrode or pentode is the design of the screen grid circuit. To provide the greatest shielding effect, the screen must be well grounded at the frequency of operation. Many valves will have a \\"self neutralizing\\" frequency somewhere in the VHF range. This results from a series resonance consisting of the screen capacity and the inductance of the screen lead thus providing a very low impedance path to ground. = UHF = Transit time effects are important at these frequencies, so feedback is not normally usable and for performance critical applications alternative linearisation techniques have to be used such as degeneration and feedforward. = Tube noise and noise figure = Noise figure is not usually an issue for power amplifier valves, however, in receivers using valves it can be important. While such uses are obsolete, this information is included for historical interest. Like any amplifying device, valves add noise to the signal to be amplified. Even with a hypothetical perfect amplifier, however, noise is unavoidably present due to thermal fluctuations in the signal source (usually assumed to be at room temperature, T = 295 K). Such fluctuations cause an electrical noise power of k_B T B, where kB is the Boltzmann constant and B the bandwidth. Correspondingly, the voltage noise of a resistance R into an open circuit is 4*k_B*T*B*R)^{1/2} and the current noise into a short circuit is 4*k_B*T*B/R)^{1/2}. The noise figure is defined as the ratio of the noise power at the output of the amplifier relative to the noise power that would be present at the output if the amplifier were noiseless (due to amplification of thermal noise of the signal source). An equivalent definition is: noise figure is the factor by which insertion of the amplifier degrades the signal to noise ratio. It is often expressed in decibels (dB). An amplifier with a 0 dB noise figure would be perfect. The noise properties of tubes at audio frequencies can be modeled well by a perfect noiseless tube having a source of voltage noise in series with the grid. For the EF86 tube, for example, this voltage noise is specified (see e.g., the Valvo, Telefunken or Philips data sheets) as 2 microvolts integrated over a frequency range of approximately 25 Hz to 10 kHz. (This refers to the integrated noise, see below for the frequency dependence of the noise spectral density.) This equals the voltage noise of a 25 kŒ© resistor. Thus, if the signal source has an impedance of 25 kŒ© or more, the noise of the tube is actually smaller than the noise of the source. For a source of 25 kŒ©, the noise generated by tube and source are the same, so the total noise power at the output of the amplifier is twice the noise power at the output of the perfect amplifier. The noise figure is then two, or 3 dB. For higher impedances, such as 250 kŒ©, the EF86's voltage noise is 1/10^{1/2} lower than the source's own noise. It therefore adds 1/10 of the noise power caused by the source, and the noise figure is 0.4 dB. For a low- impedance source of 250 Œ©, on the other hand, the noise voltage contribution of the tube is 10 times larger than the signal source, so that the noise power is one hundred times larger than that caused by the source. The noise figure in this case is 20 dB. To obtain low noise figure the impedance of the source can be increased by a transformer. This is eventually limited by the input capacity of the tube, which sets a limit on how high the signal impedance can be made if a certain bandwidth is desired. The noise voltage density of a given tube is a function of frequency. At frequencies above 10 kHz or so, it is basically constant (\\"white noise\\"). White noise is often expressed by an equivalent noise resistance, which is defined as the resistance which produces the same voltage noise as present at the tube input. For triodes, it is approximately (2-4)/gm, where gm is the transconductivity. For pentodes, it is higher, about (5-7)/gm. Tubes with high gm thus tend to have lower noise at high frequencies. For example, it is 300 Œ© for one half of the ECC88, 250 Œ© for an E188CC (both have gm = 12.5 mA/V) and as low as 65 Œ© for a tride- connected D3a (gm = 40 mA/V). In the audio frequency range (below 1‚Äì100 kHz), \\"1/f\\" noise becomes dominant, which rises like 1/f. (This is the reason for the relatively high noise resistamnce of the EF86 in the above example.) Thus, tubes with low noise at high frequency do not necessarily have low noise in the audio frequency range. For special low noise audio tubes, the frequency at which 1/f noise takes over is reduced as far as possible, maybe to something like a kilohertz. It can be reduced by choosing very pure materials for the cathode nickel, and running the tube at an optimized (generally low) anode current. At radio frequencies, things are more complicated: (i) The input impedance of a tube has a real component that goes down like 1/f¬≤ (due to cathode lead inductance and transit time effects). This means the input impedance can no longer be increased arbitrarily in order to reduce the noise figure. (ii) This input resistance has its own thermal noise, just like any resistor. (The \\"temperature\\" of this resistor for noise purposes is more close to the cathode temperature than to room temperature). Thus, the noise figure of tube amplifiers increases with frequency. At 200 MHz, a noise figure of 2.5 (or 4 dB) can be reached with the ECC2000 tube in an optimized \\"cascode\\"-circuit with an optimized source impedance. At 800 MHz, tubes like EC8010 have noise figures of about 10 dB or more. Planar triodes are better, but very early, transistors have reached noise figures substantially lower than tubes at UHF. Thus, the tuners of television sets were among the first parts of consumer electronics were transistors were used.  Decline  Semiconductor amplifiers have overwhelmingly displaced valve amplifiers for low and medium power applications at all frequencies. Valves continue to be used in some high-power, high-frequency amplifiers used for short wave broadcasting, VHF and UHF TV and (VHF) FM radio, also in existing \\"radar, countermeasures equipment, or communications equipment\\" using specially designed valves, such as the klystron, gyrotron, traveling-wave tube, and crossed-field amplifier; however, new designs for such products are now invariably semiconductor-based.

Aberdeen became the centre of Europe's petroleum industry. With the largest heliport in the world and an important service ship harbour port serving offshore oil rigs, Aberdeen is often called the \\"Oil Capital of Europe\\". The number of jobs created by the energy industry in and around Aberdeen has been estimated at half a million. Today, reserves are still flowing fast, but it has been estimated that the North Sea is nearing or has even surpassed its peak production rate. As a result, Aberdeen is expected to have to redevelop itself as a research and development hub, rather than a base for offshore drilling, in order to remain home to the multi-national companies that drive its economy. There have been local political attempts to turn Aberdeen's reputation as the \\"Oil Capital of Europe\\" into the \\"Energy Capital of Europe\\". As of 2013, despite declining North Sea reserves, Aberdeen remained a major world center for undersea petroleum technology. The most severe disaster to occur in the region took place in 1988, when the city was dealt a heavy blow by the loss of 167 men during an explosion and fire aboard an offshore rig, the Piper Alpha. It remains the world's worst offshore disaster and there is a memorial to the crew in Hazlehead Park.

Traditionally Aberdeen was home to fishing, textile mills, ship building and paper making. These industries have mostly gone and have been replaced with high technology developments in the electronics design and development industry, research in agriculture and fishing, and the oil industry which has been largely responsible for Aberdeen's economic boom in the last three decades. Traditional (pre 1970) Donside Paper Mill under demolition, 15 February 2006 Most of the leading pre-1970s industries date from the 18th Century, amongst them woollens (1703), linen (1749), and cotton (1779). These gave employment to several thousands of operatives. The paper-making industry is one of the most famous and oldest in the city, paper having been first made in Aberdeen in 1694. The industry has however, collapsed. Culter Paper Mill closed in 1981, Donside Paper Mill closed in 2001 and the Davidson Mill (run by BPB Paperboard) in 2005. Flax- spinning and jute and combmaking factories also flourished, along with successful foundries and engineering works. Granite Very durable grey granite was quarried at Rubislaw quarry for more than 300 years, and blocked and dressed paving \\"setts\\", kerb and building stones, and monumental and other ornamental work of granite have long been exported from the district to all parts of the world. The terraces of the Houses of Parliament and Waterloo Bridge in London were built from Aberdeen granite. Quarrying finally ceased in 1971. Kemnay Quarry granite has been used in many buildings and structures, including Princes Street, Edinburgh and The Forth Railway Bridge. Fishing Fishing, though once the predominant industry, was surpassed by the deep-sea fisheries, which derived a great impetus from improved technologies throughout the 20th Century. Lately, however, catches have fallen due to overfishing in previous years, and the use of the harbour by oil support vessels. Aberdeen remains an important fishing port, but the catch landed there is now eclipsed by the more northerly ports of Peterhead and Fraserburgh. The Fisheries Research Services is based in Aberdeen, including its headquarters and a marine research lab. Agriculture research Aberdeen is well regarded for the agricultural and soil research that takes place at The Macaulay Institute, which has close links to the city's two universities. The Rowett Research Institute is a research centre for studies into food and nutrition located in Aberdeen, it has produced three Nobel laureates and there is a high concentration of life scientists working in the city.
