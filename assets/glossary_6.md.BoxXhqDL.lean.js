She was born in Berlin, Germany and died in Quito, Ecuador.  Biography  = Early life = Trude Sojka in 1929 (?) Gertrud Herta Sojkov√° Baum was born on 9 December 1909 in Berlin to Czech Jewish parents. Her father, Rudolf Sojka, was an engineer, who had business dealings with the Ecuadorian president Eloy Alfaro pertaining to the Ecuadorian Railway system. Rudolf Sojka and his wife, Hedwig Baum, had three children: Waltre, (born in 1907), Gertrud and Edith, who was the youngest. Soon, the family moved to Prague, Czechoslovakia to Na Po≈ô√≠ƒç√≠ Street. Upon graduation from high school, her father enrolled Sojka, against her wishes, at the Faculty of Economics. Trude was so bored that she spent her time drawing caricatures of her teacher. Without her fathers' knowledge she enrolled in the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. Her talent as a painter lead her to exhibit at the M√§rkisches Museum in Berlin. Aged 27, in 1936, she graduated as top student. Her father died a couple of years later of a heart attack. = Holocaust survival = Auschwitz suicides with wires, 1974, acrylics and cement over cardboard, CCTS With Hitler's rise to power and the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Third Reich, Sojka's non-practicing Jewish family was threatened. In 1938, Sojka married Dezider Schwartz, a Slovak civil servant. They moved to live in Nitra, Slovakia, at Priehradn√° 6 street. In 1942, the couple was aplarently transported to Majdanek concentration camp. This information remains unclear. Perhaps they managed to escape or hid, because in 1944 they were living in the same place, in Nitra. After the National Uprising, they werd sent first to Sered' labour camp, then, in October 1944, to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. In November, Trude is transferred to Gross-Rosen concentration camp, sub camp: Kudowa-SƒÖkisch. And in March 1945, as her pregnancy was beginning perhaps to be noticeable, she was put in Zittwerke-Kleinsh√∂nau concentration camp, where other Jewish pregnant women were held as well. She gave birth on 4 May 1945. Seven days later the camp was liberated by the Russians. On 29 May, her daughter, Gabriele Evelin Schwartz died. She could never find Dezider Schwartz again. Edith, Trude's sister, anlong with her husband and child had died in Terezin, and her mother, Hedwig, had been shot in a forest near Maly Trostinec. But she found in the Red-Cross a paper from her older brother, Waltre, lookjng for his family. He was living in Ecuador since 1938. Waltre had been invited to Ecuador to give chemistry lectures in the Central University of Ecuador and, with his wife Lidy Hutzler, decided it was safer to stay there, at least until the war finished. Trude decided to join them. But first, she spent a whole year travelling, trying still to find her family, and to recover her pertainings, while working in all kinds of jobs to earn enough money for the big trip to the New Continent. Sojka's experience in Auschwitz left her traumatized: she witnessed people die in front of her every day (including her daughter), walk barefoot in the snow, and even dig their own graves. The only food she got to eat was a \\"soup\\" (with unknown things floating in it), a little hard stale bread, potatoes and fruit and vegetable peels. She survived for nearly a year in the camp mainly due to her ability for massage. = Arrival to Ecuador = \\"When I arrived to the port of Guayaquil, my brother was waiting for me with his arms wide open. Only that when I got out from the ship, I went running straight to hug a bunch of bananas\\", Sojka used to joke. In fact, arriving to Ecuador she is delighted by the number of exotic fruits and things one could find nowhere in Europe at that time. Sojka was fascinated by the culture, the indigenous people and the landscape. Little by little she learns Spanish pronounced with curious accents. Also, she finds some resemblances between the Quichua language and the Czech language. She discovers is the autochthonous and aboriginal art, that she starts studying as soon as possible: a source of inspiration to her own works. Sojka begins working for her brother and his wife, both in his factory and at his handicraft store, called AKIOS, (Sojka written in reverse), in the Historic Center of Quito, in a neighborhood called Loma Grande.  Life in Ecuador  Trude Sojka and his husband Hans Steinitz, 1994 When Sojka arrived in Guayaquil, she met a good friend of her brother, who was also a Holocaust survivor, who managed to run away from Sachsenhausen concentration camp with the excuse he had been hired as a lawyer by a cotton company in Ecuador. He was helped out by honorary consul of Ecuador in Bremen Manuel Mu√±oz Borrero, recognized as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem for opening the door of his country to so many other Jews. In 1948 Hans Steinitz and Sojka were married. Their first child, Eva Graciela Hedvika Steinitz was born in 1949. They had two other girls: Ruth Miriam EdithMiriam Kannan, limnologist and professor at the Northern Kentucky UniversityBUILDING PEACE THROUGH NATURE CONSERVATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION IN THE ANDES OF ECUADOR: http://latino.nku.edu/docs/Ecuador_Trip.pdf and Anita Steinitz, now the Director of the Trude Sojka Cultural House in Quito.

She even gets to teach sculpture to Oswaldo Guayasam√≠n. Thereafter, Sojka lived calmly with her husband Hans Steinitz. She had two granddaughters: Geetha Kannan (born in 1985), daughter of Miriam, and Gabriela F. Steinitz (born in 1995 to Anita). Hans Steinitz died on 23 May 1996, from an oesophageal cancer. = Last years = On Sojka's 90th birthday, the Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana \\"Benjam√≠n Carri√≥n\\" (Ecuadorian House of Culture) paid her homage, naming her \\"Emeritus artist\\" during a reception, in which a retrospective exhibition of her artworks was held. At the same event, the book \\"The two lives of Trude Sojka\\", written by Rodrigo Villac√≠s Molina was launched. This is just one of the many tributes that are made for Sojka, including exhibitions in the Guaranda and Riobamba. On 2001, Sojka suffered a stroke. She managed to overcome it with a minimum of memory loss. She continued, though, to make heavy paintings and sculptures with cement and recycled materials up to the age of ninety-five. When her hands got too fragile, she ceased working with cement. However, she never stopped painting and drawing. At the beginnings of 2007, Sojka suffered a Respiratory failure. On 18 February that year, exactly a year after the death of her daughter \\"Chela\\" (Eva SteinitzEva Steinitz records), which was not told to her, Sojka entered hospital where she had a second stroke. She died, at home, on 18 March, from a respiratory failure. Her remains rest in the Jewish cemetery in the city of Quito, along with those of her husband.  Artwork  = Influences = Trude Sojka's work evolved in response to the various experiences in her life. Sojka studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin, where she became familiar with Expressionism. She became familiar with the works of Marc Chagall, Chaim Soutine and Georges Rouault. She deeply admired the sculptures of Ernst Barlach and is likely to have personally known the work of the expressionist-realist K√§the Kollwitz. Once she was established in Quito, she worked for the handicrafts factory Akios. Walter and Liddy Sojka had employed a number of locals who were reproducing all kinds of useful and traditional objects to sell and even export to other countries in America and Europe. So Trude Sojka got directly in touch with these indigenous people working for the factory. = Subjects = In Europe, Sojka became already interested in the primitive art of Africa, Oceania and America (which can also be considered somehow expressionist). This she had surely learned visiting ethnographic museums. Thus, when after World War II, in 1946, she came to Ecuador, she was amazed to discover so closely the Pre-Columbian art. Her first paintings in Ecuador, created in 1950, depict her experiences in Auschwitz. She also worked a lot around the meaning of her last name: Sojka, a bird that wanders around the woods of eastern Europe. \\"Bird\\", 1973, cement, acrylics, corals, wires and other recycled materials, CCTS Later on, she studied again, but this time deeply, Precolombian art, especially traditional Ecuadorian Indigenous art and its different divinities. Therefore, she introduced many of its figures to her European Expressionist way of painting, which is unique. Meanwhile, her paintings developed to be more gay: nature, the universe, prayers, nostalgic memories of her beloved Czechoslovakia... became her main subjects. At the end of the 20th century, when her two granddaughters were born, she painted many more tender figures, such as her well-known painting: El cuento de las mariposas amarillas (The yellow butterfile's fairytale). File:\\"Eva y la Culebra\\", Trude Sojka.JPG\\"Eva and the snake\\", 1951,cement and acrylics over wood, CCTS File:\\"Precolombino 2\\", Trude Sojka.JPG\\"Precolombian\\", 1961, cement and acrylics over wood, CCTS File:\\"Mujer en la ventana\\", Trude Sojka.JPG\\"Woman next to window\\", 1979, cement and acrylics over wood, CCTS File:\\"Garza\\", Trude Sojka.JPG\\"Heron\\", 1978,cement and acrylics over wood, CCTS File:La Ventana, cuadro de Trude Sojka.JPG\\"The window\\", 1979,cement and acrylics over wood, CCTS =Special Technique= Trude Sojka's works are considered to be very special as well because of its technique. The artist used cement, a very hard material that dries fast, to make her paintings, the same way as she would make her sculptures, giving second dimension to the usually flat surface. She came up with the idea because she loved to work with clay, but cement was cheaper and more challenging. To fix the cement to the wooden or cardboard surface, she used a glue that her brother Walter Sojka, a chemist, invented just for her. Moreover, she was a pioneer in Ecuador, and probably in Latin America as well, to use recycled materials within her artworks, such as broken glass, pieces of metal, wheel structures, tiles, dustbin covers... Because she believed on the value of each little object, in the aftermath of the tremendous experience in the concentration camps, back in Europe. She covered the gray surfaces with acrylics instead of oils, much widely in use at the beginning of the fifties. Her artworks are thus very heavy and fragile because they can easily break.  Cultural House (CCTS)  Entry to the Trude Sojka Cultural House, Quito, Ecuador. On 12 March 2009, one week before the second anniversary of Sojka's death, her daughter Anita Steintz opened to the public the house of the artist turned into a museum named Casa Cultural Trude Sojka (CCTS) or Trude Sojka Cultural House. Ever since, her more than 300 works of art are shown in a series of turning exhibitions. The house remained almost untouched. Only some rooms were adapted in order to improve the exhibition conditions. Visitors can also appreciate the sculpture garden, with the original plants of the house. Besides, the huge collection of Trude's husband, Hans Steinitz, was turned into a library. And the kitchen, into a small caf√© named \\"Praha\\", where the family serves their East-European and Jewish pastries and snacks. Hans Steinitz' library The garage became an atelier for workshops about art, for adults and kids. Many temporary exhibits, concerts, projections and lectures and many other cultural activities are held, using the adaptable spaces of the house. It is in this place that the Czech inhabitants of Ecuador reunite from time to time. The Yad Vashem has named the Trude Sojka's Cultural House a Holocaust memorial and a Freedom Station by the Claims Conference of the Ohio community, as the life of Sojka and her family constitutes a renowned example of survival and renewal, fighting against antisemitism, xenophobia, and other types of intolerance.

The term \\"face control\\" comes from the fact that establishments are attempting to use exclusivity to preserve their public \\"face\\". Although a similar \\"velvet rope\\" policy exists in other countries, aiming to admit the right mix of \\"beautiful people\\" and keep out boring or unattractive would-be patrons, the Russian version is considered particularly harsh and unforgiving by Western standards. The rare occasional use of this term in English can be considered a linguistic reborrowing via the Russian pseudo-anglicism —Ñ–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ª—å (feiskontrol). Admission standards Goscilo notes that, as the more upscale establishments are \\"temples of unbridled self-presentation- masquerading-as-pleasure\\", wealth is not enough to guarantee admission; a wealthy person who lacks the proper respect, culture, sartorial elegance, prettiness, or impressively expensive model car may nonetheless be denied admission. Face control, since it requires discernment, is considered an art, with Moscow only having about ten truly excellent face controllers. Some establishments only practice face control on Fridays and Saturdays, so customers unable to meet the bouncer's standards can come at other times. In Moscow, stricter face control tends to be implemented as the evening progresses, so people can also avoid it by coming early for dinner, before the bouncers are posted. As foreigners are sometimes preferred, speaking English has also been noted as helpful in getting through face control.

In 2012 the Australian Senate Inquiry Report into Forced Adoption Practices found that babies were taken illegally by doctors, nurses, social workers and religious figures, sometimes with the assistance of adoption agencies or other authorities, and adopted to married couples. Some mothers were coerced, drugged and illegally had their consent taken. Many of these adoptions occurred after the mothers were sent away by their families 'due to the stigma associated with being pregnant and unmarried'. The removals occurred predominantly in the second half of the twentieth century. It was a practice which has been described as 'institutionalised baby farming'. In response to the Senate Inquiry, on 21 March 2013 Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister of Australia offered a national apology to those affected by forced adoptions; and outlined a range of other government responses. Adoption practices in twentieth century Australia Modern adoption is a peculiarly twentieth century phenomenon, with most adoptions taking place between the 1950s and the 1980s. For much of this period, adoption had two key features: the application of 'clean break theory', and the framework of 'closed adoption'. Clean break theory involved the removal of a baby from the mother immediately after birth, often with no contact taking place between parent and child, followed by permanent placement of the baby with an adopting family usually within a period of several weeks. Closed adoption involved the sealing of the record of adoption. Records were thus closed, so that the parties to the adoption remained permanently unaware of the identity of others. (large file warning: 15MB) There are no precise estimates of the number of adoptions that took place in Australia, with estimates of around 250,000 being feasible. An unknown proportion of these adoptions involved the placement of the babies of single mothers. Because of the stigma attached to being born out of wedlock, and the absence of any financial support for single mothers, there was a widespread view at the time that adopting out the babies of unmarried mothers was in the 'best interests of the child'.  Apologies On 19 October 2010, Parliament of Western Australia became the first parliament in Australia to apologise for forced adoption policies of babies born to unwed mothers. \\"I now apologise to the mothers, their children and families who were adversely affected by these adoption practices,\\" Colin Barnett said. On 18 July 2012, the Parliament of South Australia formally apologised for forced adoption. \\"Our apology will recognise that those practices directly affected many of those parents whose children were adopted by force and many of those people who were separated from their parents as children,\\" said Premier Jay Weatherill. \\"This apology is long overdue but we hope it will be a significant moment for those affected.\\" It is estimated more than 17,000 children were adopted out before 1980 and some of these involved forced adoption practices. The Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly endorsed a formal apology, delivered by Chief Minister Katy Gallagher, on 14 August 2012. On 20 September 2012, NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell delivered an apology on behalf of the Parliament of New South Wales to the parents and children who were affected by past forced adoption policies. This apology was passed as a resolution of both chambers of the parliament. On 25 October 2012, the Parliament of Victoria apologised for forced adoption practices. The apologies were delivered by Victorian Premier Ted Baillieu and opposition leader Daniel Andrews. \\"We express our sincere sorrow,\\" the Premier told parliament. \\"These were misguided, unwarranted and they caused immeasurable pain. Today Victoria parliament is standing up and saying sorry.\\" On 6 August 2012, the Parliament of Tasmania announced that it would present a formal apology over forced adoption policies. and on 23 August 2012, the Queensland government announced that it would also deliver an apology through the Parliament of Queensland, this leaving the Northern Territory as the only jurisdiction not to apologise, or announce a forthcoming apology on the matter. On 21 March 2013, Julia Gillard apologised on behalf of the Australian Government. The National Archives of Australia was commissioned to develop a website and exhibition to increase understanding of forced adoption practices in Australia, as recommended in the Senate report.

community, that emerges with a common language and discourse that is generated from the use of the printing press, proliferated by a capitalist marketplace. Capitalist entrepreneurs printed their books and media in the vernacular (instead of exclusive script languages, such as Latin) in order to maximize circulation. As a result, readers speaking various local dialects became able to understand each other, and a common discourse emerged. Anderson argued that the first European nation-states were thus formed around their \\"national print-languages.\\" Terminology The term was coined by Benedict Anderson, and explained in depth in his book Imagined Communities in 1983. Development of the modern nation-state The printing press is widely credited for modern nationalism and the birth of the nation-state as the primary actors in political legitimacy. Soon after the invention of the Gutenberg-style printing press in 1454, literature such as the Bible was printed in vernaculars. The publication of the 95 Theses in 1517 sparked the reformation, under which Europe went through 200 years of warfare that led to the gradual establishment of the nation-state as the powers that were dominant, over the previous dominance of the Roman Catholic Church.Shirky, Clay.

Writing in the June 2012 issue of the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, Barry Rice praised the book's detailed coverage, photography, and build quality, as well as the inclusion of \\"very useful\\" distribution maps for each species. However, he pointed out the lack of a botanical key as a significant omission. He suggested that the book's shortcomings are likely \\"due to an overly-speedy publication schedule at Redfern Natural History Productions\\". Summarising, Rice wrote that both Sarraceniaceae of South America and its sister volume \\"are beautiful books with wonderful images and lots of fascinating details\\". A review by Nils K√∂ster published in the June 2012 issue of Willdenowia was also positive, describing the two monographs as \\"the ideal companions for everybody interested in New World pitcher plants\\". However, the author found the book's treatment of synonyms \\"a little disappointing\\"‚Äîalthough present, they are \\"rather hidden within the text\\" and mostly absent from the index. The reviewer also noted the lack of an identification key, writing: \\"ultimately, a taxonomic concept which cannot be implemented in an identification key always leaves some room for doubt about its viability\\". In his review for the September 2012 issue of the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, Michael F.

It evolved from one of several unofficial pro-Unionist militia units formed semi-secretly in St. Louis in the early months of 1861 by Congressman Francis Preston Blair, Jr. and other Unionist activists. The organization that would become the First U.S.R.C was largely composed of ethnic Germans, who were generally opposed to slavery and strongly supportive of the Unionist cause. Although initially without any official standing, beginning on April 22, 1861, the Unionist regiments Blair helped organize were sworn into Federal service at the St. Louis Arsenal by then-Captain John Schofield acting on the authority of President Lincoln. The first four regiments were considered to be the regiments of Missouri Volunteers called for under President Lincoln's April 15, 1861, call for 75,000 volunteers. So many St. Louis Unionists mustered to volunteer, that after consultation with General-in-Chief Winfield Scott, and Secretary of War Simon Cameron, President Lincoln directed Captain Nathaniel Lyon to \\"enroll in the military service of the United States the loyal citizens of Saint Louis and vicinity, not exceeding with those heretofore enlisted, ten thousand in number, for the purpose of maintaining the authority of the United States; [and] for the protection of the peaceable inhabitants of Missouri.\\"Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series 1, Vol 3, Chapter VIII, p675 These additional regiments, in excess of the original Presidential call were designated \\"United States Reserve Corps\\" units, and were intended for local service.

President Lincoln would later confirm Lyon's promotion from captain to brigadier general.  Military Service  On May 10, 1861, the 1st Missouri US Reserve Corps Infantry Regiment under Colonel Almstead participated in the arrest of the Missouri Volunteer Militia drilling at Camp Jackson at Lindell Grove on the western border of St. Louis City. As the Missouri militiamen were being march under guard back to the Arsenal near the riverfront, angry crowds confronted the Federal forces and the confused situation soon devolved into rioting and gunfire. Over 27 people were killed and the Camp Jackson Affair helped to polarize the state and send Missouri down the road to its own internal civil war. On May 18, the regiment received an organic cavalry company, also raised from the First Ward \\"which did valuable scouting service\\".

Written and directed by Thomas Schnauz, it aired on AMC on August 26, 2012. The title of the episode is a phrase repeatedly spoken by Walt (Bryan Cranston) during his encounter with Declan (Louis Ferreira). This episode marks Jonathan Banks's final Breaking Bad appearance as a series regular. Banks and Bryan Cranston both received high praise from critics for their performances. Banks later returned as Mike Ehrmantraut for the Breaking Bad prequel spin-off, Better Call Saul, and currently stars as a series regular.  Plot  Walt, Mike, and Jesse meet with Declan, their Phoenix-based competitor. Instead of agreeing to Declan's offer to purchase the heisted methylamine for $15 million in exchange for removing Walt's blue meth from the drug market, Walt offers a counterproposal: to sell his superior product through Declan's distribution network in exchange for a substantial share of the business and a one-time, $5 million payment to Mike for his share. Frustrated with having to negotiate with Walt, Declan demands to know who he is. Refusing to back down, Walt insists that Declan already knows his name and demands that he say it. When Walt informs him that it was he who killed Gus, Declan resignedly realizes and acknowledges Walt as Heisenberg. As Mike leaves with his $5 million, he informs Walt that he will continue making hazard payments to Gus's men out of his own money. He also advises Walt that the bugs planted in Hank's office must be removed before a sweep is performed by the DEA. Walt avoids Jesse's attempts to leave with his share of the money. Meanwhile, Mike learns through the bugs that the DEA has a search warrant for his house. He stashes a car with a go bag with cash, a passport, and a gun in an airport parking lot. When Hank and Gomez search his house, they find nothing. Later, Hank is told to end his surveillance of Mike due to budgetary considerations. Not being instructed otherwise, he decides to have Gomez follow Mike's attorney, Dan, who has been placing cash in various safe deposit boxes to facilitate the transfer of the hazard payments and to set aside money for Mike's granddaughter Kaylee. Gomez catches Dan in the act and apprehends him. Jesse confronts Walt and demands his share of the money. Walt becomes hostile and accuses Jesse of having nothing in his life, but his attempts to manipulate Jesse fail and he ultimately leaves without his money, angering Walt further. Walt is forced to cook his next batch of meth with Todd, who proves to be much more subordinate and better at following orders than Jesse. Pretending to be distraught over Skyler, Walt visits Hank at his office and manages to remove the bugs, but overhears Gomez telling Hank that they have arrested Dan and that he plans on telling everything he knows about Mike. Walt frantically calls Mike, who is at a park with Kaylee, and tells him the DEA is coming for him. Upon the arrival of the police, Mike is forced to flee the park without saying goodbye to his granddaughter. Mike asks Saul to retrieve the go bag for his getaway, but Saul fears the DEA will follow him. When Jesse volunteers to help, Mike refuses his assistance out of concern that Jesse would be spotted, leaving Walt to retrieve the bag. When Walt meets with Mike, he refuses to hand over the bag unless Mike tells him the names of the nine men he is paying off. Mike refuses and, angered by Walt's insistence that Mike owes him gratitude, proceeds to attack Walt's ego, insisting the entire situation could have been avoided if he had continued to work for Gus and had not killed him. Walt storms off momentarily, but then approaches Mike's car. Mike realizes his gun is missing from the go bag, just as Walt uses it to shoot him through his car window. Mike tries to get away, but ‚Äì mortally wounded ‚Äì ultimately resigns himself to sitting on a log by the river. After Walt catches up to him, Walt realizes he could have just asked Lydia for the names and that shooting Mike was unnecessary. As Walt stammers an apology, Mike tells him, \\"Shut the fuck up and let me die in peace\\". After a moment of silence, he falls off the log, dead.  Production  Banks made his final appearance as a series regular in \\"Say My Name\\" The episode was written and directed by Thomas Schnauz and aired on AMC on August 26, 2012. This episode marks the final Breaking Bad appearance of Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks) as a series regular. Show creator Vince Gilligan talked about Mike's death and why it was one of his favorite moments of the series: Banks claimed Mike's death did not surprise him because he always believed the character would die at some point. Banks would reprise his role as Mike Ehrmantraut in Better Call Saul.

I literally can't give this higher than a 9.0, it was just too sad of an ending.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix thought the episode was \\"a mostly tremendous episode of a drama\\", adding the death of Mike \\"is just a gorgeous, devastating scene\\", but he was unimpressed by the plotting that led to Mike showing any trust for Walt in that situation, writing that it was a contrived way to ensure that Walt would be in a position to kill Mike per the requirements of the overall show story. Thomas Schnauz was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for writing this episode. In 2019 The Ringer ranked \\"Say My Name\\" as the 8th best out of the 62 total Breaking Bad episodes.

JayisGames. Retrieved 2012-09-18. Players will form factions, sell ships, goods, and services to other players, and more. Players will need to consider numerous factors in building a working ship, including: radiating heat produced by the ship's systems to space; ensuring an adequate fuel supply; keeping the ship's air breathable and contained; keeping the crew efficient and happy; ensuring the ship's power supply can meet its power demands; placing crew members in roles at which they are skilled; and more. ScrumbleShip's gameplay aims to be challenging, but rewarding to players at all levels of video game competency.Ames, Adam (2012-09-24). \\"Frictionless 3D Space: ScrumbleShip\\". TruePCGaming.com. Retrieved 2012-09-29. In ScrumbleShip, there ain't no such thing as a free lunch. The law of conservation of energy applies; everything the player builds in-game, and all energy expended must come from some existing source. Players and AI crew members (redshirted clones), will need to build their ships and space stations block by block out of material mined from asteroids or salvaged from other ships. Players and clones can only carry one block at a time, as blocks are a cubic meter in volume. Players will place blueprint blocks that indicate where a clone or player should weld a new block or component, and out of which material it should be made. Setting The ScrumbleVerse is the universe in which ScrumbleShip takes place. The ScrumbleVerse is a persistent world. While there will not be one main server, players will be able to host their own servers which take the form of solar systems, all of which will be linked. Players who host a server will be able to run a space station hub that acts as a center for trade and repair for the solar system. This hub station will feature a warp gate that allows for instantaneous travel to other solar systems (servers) for those players whose ships cannot support a warp drive, or those who cannot afford one. Heat simulation Damage to a tungsten ship simulated by ScrumbleShip's heat engine As of August 12, 2012, ScrumbleShip's alpha version features heat simulation. While heat simulation has been featured in two-dimensional video games, such as falling-sand games, ScrumbleShip's heat simulation is unique among 3D computer games. Players can currently heat in-game objects using a laser. Objects transfer heat to nearby objects at a rate proportionate to the real- world thermal conductivity and thermal capacity of the materials. As objects grow hotter, they glow red proportionate to their heat energy. Laser fire is scalable; lower-powered lasers are likely to gradually warm an object and cause it to melt and boil off. High-powered lasers are more likely to flash- boil the voxels they strike, resulting in a hole in the object and relatively little heat transferred to the surrounding material. Objects that exceed their melting point without being flash-boiled turn into a red-hot animated blob representing melted material in zero gravity. Such blobs tend to quickly boil off, as the boiling point of a liquid is just over its melting point in a vacuum. When the engine calculates an object to be boiling, the object animates to represent boiling into nothingness, and is removed. Planned features include exothermic ship components producing heat that builds up in a ship's atmosphere and material, and requiring players who hope to build working ships to design them with heat dissipation in mind. Voxel Damage Modelling Voxel damage to glass windows and titanium window casing caused by a laser.Unlike in other block-building games which are erroneously referred to as \\"voxel\\" games, each component and block in ScrumbleShip is composed of up to 4,096 individual voxels, which are essentially 3D pixels. ScrumbleShip depicts damage to in-game materials accurately and precisely by removing voxels that the game calculates to have been destroyed, rather than by removing entire blocks or components. Voxels are currently destroyed when the game's heat engine calculates that a laser has brought an object's material above its boiling point. Voxels are then removed in the shape of the laser beam at a rate proportionate to the temperature of the object, the energy of the beam, and the duration of time over which the beam strikes the object. Terminals Terminals are the computer stations from which players and clones will control a ship's weapons, engines, sensors, and other systems. Terminals will operate on ScrumbleScript, a simple, custom-built programming language that will allow basic and advanced programs to be created. Players will be able to code and trade programs that cause various ship systems to perform certain functions under given conditions, allowing for automation of ship functions such as emergency reactor shutdown. Even functional operating systems may be created using ScrumbleScript. Licensing Every purchased copy of ScrumbleShip will come with a full copy of the C source code. However, the license is non-free: any redistribution, in source or binary form, verbatim or modified, is allowed \\"only on websites explicitly approved by Orangehat Tech, LLC. Currently the only approved website for redistribution is scrumbleship.com.\\"http://dynamic.scrumbleship.com/license Modders can contribute their original source code and voxel models for inclusion in the main build. Bleeding Edge Releases Bleeding edge executables are frequently broken, frequently updated executables with all the newest, untested features in them, and are equivalent to other software project's \\"nightlies\\". They are currently available as a perk for ScrumbleShip \\"Deluxe\\" owners. To install a bleeding edge release, players must unzip them and then move the files into the directory for the latest release of ScrumbleShip. Each bleeding edge is built against the current version of ScrumbleShip on the official web site's \\"Get\\" page. They are currently limited to Win32 and Lin64 executables due to technical limitations of the developer's system. Each release comes with the full source code, however, so players can build executables for any operating system. Funding ScrumbleShip employs an alpha funding model, whereby the latest version of the game in development are available for purchase. Purchasers of the Full version of the game have access to monthly releases, and purchasers of the Deluxe version have access to bleeding edge releases. Purchasing any version of the game ensures access to the final version of the game upon its 1.0 release. A successful Kickstarter campaign for ScrumbleShip concluded on October 17, 2012, awarding the developer $12,093 in funding, exceeding the project's $8,000 goal.

On August 13, 1992, on his first day in former Yugoslavia, he was struck by a sniper's bullet near the Sarajevo Airport while driving through Sniper Alley. His team had arrived to interview Milan Panic, the new Yugoslav prime minister. When traveling with the prime minister, however, the armored United Nations car proved to be too small to hold everyone, and Kaplan was moved to a \\"soft- skinned\\" (unarmored) van of another television crew. Because Kaplan had no flak jacket, he was seated between two journalists who did. A few minutes later, a bullet was fired through the tailgate of the van, between the taped letters \\"T\\" and \\"V\\". Kaplan was not wearing a flak jacket, and the bullet entered his back, severing an artery. He died hours later in a Sarajevo hospital. Kaplan was the first American citizen to be killed in the Yugoslav Wars. The shooter was unknown. ABC News anchor Sam Donaldson, who had also been traveling in the motorcade, called Kaplan \\"a good man\\" who \\"understood the risks here\\". US presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater described Kaplan as \\"an honest, fair, talented and creative journalist\\" and called his death \\"a very sad and personal loss for all of us who've worked with David\\".

While the United States Student Association does not have a student bill of rights of its own, it upholds the 1947 student bill of rights put forth by the National Student Association.United States Student Association http://www.usstudents.org/about/history/ These documents tend to do several things. They can be statements of belief, policy or law. When put forth by a student organization or third party organization they tend to be statements of belief because these organizations do not often have the ability to enforce their beliefs. Even though they are not legally binding they are important because they help policy and lawmakers understand what students expect and believe to be ethical treatment. At the institutional level they tend to be policy statements. These are legally binding as a promise from the institution to the students who attend and have been found in court to be considered to be part of the educational contract.Kaplan and Lee (2011) At any level these documents provide students with an understanding of their civil or legal rights which are already contained in legislation. These include rights pertinent to all citizens and also to students in the educational setting and provide procedural rights to inform students how institutions should be respecting their legal rights. When used as a statement of belief, however, they often include rights an organization feels students should have and the procedural rights institutions must follow to ensure these rights are fulfilled. There are currently a number of student petitions calling for the creation of national student bills in various countries. While there have been some attempts to create subject specific student bills in the United States, like the Academic Bill of Rights, these have not been successful due primarily for demand for a document which is wider in scope and deals with students constitutional, civil, contractual and consumer rights. North American Student Bills No country in North America has yet adopted a National Student Bill of Rights, Charter of Rights and Freedoms or Code of Rights and Responsibilities.Occupy Education http://www.facebook.com/occupycollegenavigatehighered.com =United States of America= American National Student Bills In the United States there have been several national student bill of rights drafted by student organizations including the historic National Student Association and the American Association of University Professors and other non-governmantal organizations but as yet none have been legally institutionalized. National Student Association (NSA) In 1947 the National Student Association NSA in the United States adopted a student bill of rights. The text of this document is not easily accessible. In 1967, however, the NSA put forth a joint statement on the rights and freedoms of students with the American Association of University Professors AAUP (now the Association of American Colleges and Universities). This statement was endorsed by a number of professional organizations. This document included the following rights: Constitutional Rights # Exercise of rights of citizenship # Freedom of association # Right to due process Speech and Association Rights # Student participation in institutional government # Student publications Due Process Rights # Standards for investigation of student conduct ## Investigation of student conduct ## Hearings for student conduct Classroom Rights # Protection of freedom of inquiry and expression # Protection from improper academic evaluation # Protection from improper student information disclosurehttp://www.aaup.org/aaup/pubsres/policydocs/contents/stud-rights.htm United States Student Association The United States Student Association does not have an official student bill of rights. The USSA was formed when the historic NSA merged with the National Student Lobby NSL in 1978. They did not officially adopt the student bill of rights put forth in 1947. They text of this document is not on their website and cannot easily be found with a search of the internet. 2003 Academic Bill of Rights In 2003, Georgia Congressman Kingston proposed the first national student bill of rights, House Bill #318. This bill, which was rejected in congress, was not an all encompassing student bill of rights but was narrowly defined to address academic freedom. Nevertheless, it was the first attempt at the creation of national legislation. The congressman found that \\"at almost every American university, conservative professors are drastically outnumbered.\\" This bill was intended to secure the intellectual freedom of students and faculty. It did not address whether teachers would have the freedom to determine all course goals, curriculum, assignments, grading schemes and course timeline. These issues are of major importance because students in Europe are calling for rights which protect students from teachers having complete academic freedom in the classroom and which regulate them to ensure students have minimum educational quality standards.http://navigatehighered.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/7/5/12753485/student_code_- _still_editing2.pdf =American Institutional Student Bills= In the United States individual institutions often have their own Student Bill of Rights, Charter of Rights and Freedoms or Code of Rights and Responsibilities. In elementary and secondary education these codes are often drafted by school board officials with perhaps the input of parent or parent teacher associations. In post secondary institutions these are often drafted by the academic senate with the contribution of student representatives. This process often includes varying degrees of student input from student surveys to no student voice and the academic senate may have as much as 50% student representation or as little as 0% student representation depending on the structure of the institution. =Canada= Canadian Federation of Students The Canadian Federation of Students has yet to accept a student bill or rights, code of rights and responsibilities or a charter of rights and freedoms. The Canadian Encyclopedia, which details issues of Canadian life and governance, however, states that in Canada \\"Basically 2 sorts of rights apply to students: substantive rights - the actual rights that students should enjoy - and procedural rights - methods by which students claim their rights. This article is concerned with students in public institutions, although those in private schools can claim rights under the common law and provincial education Acts.\\" Declaration on the Canadian Student In the 1960s, the Canadian Union of Students had adopted the Declaration on the Canadian Student, a declaration aimed defining the rights and role of a student. The Declaration was adopted at the September 1965 annual meeting of the CUS, and was initiated mainly by the Students' Union of the University of Ottawa President Jock Turcot.La Rotonde. L‚ÄôAG√âUO d√©finit l‚Äô√©tudiant canadien. Published 22 September 1965 A year later, the CUS re-affirmed the \\"fundamental philosophy\\" behind the Declaration.http://www.studentunion.ca/2013/07/the-declaration-of-the- canadian-student/ European Student Bills =European Student Union= In 2008 the European Student Union adopted a Student Rights Charter which is in essence their platform. This document includes those rights and freedoms which members of the European student Union are lobbying for in their own countries. Romania currently has the strongest student rights legislation in the European Union and this is in part to do with the efforts of the European Student Union to press for legislation.

Several fictional characters have reversed organs. * In the Ian Fleming novel Dr. No, Julius No explains to James Bond that he once survived a murder attempt because his heart is located on his right side, which his would-be-killers did not know when they stabbed the spot on the left where the heart of a normal human being would be. * At the DC Comics Universe, all the inhabitants of Earth 3 have their organs in an inverse position, and is possible to identify them in this way. * Souther, from the anime/manga Fist of the North Star, has dextrocardia with situs inversus totalis, making him immune to the normal applications of Kenshiro's Hokuto Shinken fighting style, since Souther's organs‚Äîand thus, his pressure points‚Äîare reversed from where they would normally be. This highly advantageous condition is referred to by Souther as his 'Emperor's Armour', and in his first fight with Kenshiro, he uses this advantage to easily defeat his opponent. During their final confrontation, Toki reveals the specifics of Souther's condition. With this knowledge, Kenshiro is able to successfully hold his own and defeat Souther in a decisive final battle. * In an episode of the television show In Plain Sight, an ATF agent survives an attempt on his life because his heart is on the right side of his body. * In the WB series Jack & Jill, Simon Rex played a young man with situs inversus. * Fortune, from Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. Revolver Ocelot points this out when he shoots Fortune on the left side of her chest, then remembers and states that her heart was on the right side. * In an ER episode entitled \\"Freak Show\\", Romano, Benton and Corday operate on a unique case involving a boy with reversed organs. *In a story called \\"The Trap,\\" which H. P. Lovecraft helped write, one of the characters is sucked into an interdimensional rift by an antique mirror. When he returns his organs, and in fact his handedness (which hand is dominant) are both reversed. * In Margaret Mahy's novel The Tricksters, the character Hadfield is said to be an exact mirror image of his otherwise identical twin Felix, including having his vital organs in mirror-image layout. * In the Lord Peter Wimsey short story The Image in the Mirror by Dorothy Sayers, a character with reversed organs has long been haunted by dreams of a doppelg√§nger and by fears that he himself might be only the reflection of someone else. * In the A. E. van Vogt short story \\"The Search,\\" the unique trait of people who can travel through time is that they have reversed internal organs. * In the Max Brooks novel World War Z, a character describes operating on a patient who had dextrocardia with situs inversus, and transplants a heart from someone with the same condition. Unbeknownst to him, the transplant heart is infected with the virus Solanum, thus turning the patient into a zombie. * In the science fiction novel Doorways in the Sand by Roger Zelazny the character Fred Cassidy goes through a device that completely reverses the left-right symmetry of his entire body (even to the point where he perceives writing and other images as their mirror image). The fact that his heart is on the wrong side ends up saving him from being killed by a bullet wound. * In the science fiction short story Technical Error by Arthur C. Clarke, character Richard Nelson is inverted laterally in an industrial accident where his body exists in a fourth spatial dimension due to a short circuit at the power plant where he works, which caused a strong, but unstable magnetic field. Doctors find he is unable to digest food due to the nutrient molecules being incompatible with his reversed enzymes and receptors. Efforts to re-invert him prove catastrophic. * In the Hindi movie Luck (2009), the character 'Ram' has his heart on the right side instead of the left which saves his life. * In Audrey Niffenegger's novel, Her Fearful Symmetry, the main characters are mirror twins, one of whom, Valentina, has situs inversus. * In the movie Ninja Assassin, a Europol agent Mika gets stabbed where her heart should be. Everyone thinks her to be dead, but then Raizo proclaims that her heart is \\"special\\" (meaning on the right side instead of left), and she survives. Also, in the beginning of the movie there is an old man, a tattoo artist, who should have died 57 years ago from a sword to the heart, but survived because his heart was located on the right side of the body as well. *In 2008 horror movie The Broken protagonist Gina McVey, a radiologist, is seen discussing a patient with Dextrocardia situs inversus early in the film. *In Roll Call - book 3 of the series Traces, a character called Emily Wonder has the condition. *In the manga Black Jack, the protagonist has a patient who has situs inversus totalis, in which he operates using a mirror that Pinoko provided so that he can see the organs \\"normally\\". * Helena from the series Orphan Black was discovered to have situs inversus totalis after surviving a gunshot wound that would otherwise have pierced her heart. * In Doppelg√§nger (1969 film) (also known as Journey to the Far Side of the Sun) astronauts from Earth land on a parallel planet on the other side of the Sun where everything is a mirror image of what it is on Earth. When one of the astronauts dies, X-rays from his post-mortem exam reveal that his internal organs are located on the wrong side of his body. * De Rode Ridder, the main character of the eponymous Flemish comic has situs inversus after he passed through a magical mirror (album 58), which later on saves his life by making a crossbow bolt narrowly miss his heart (album 208). * In the final mission in the 2016 game Hitman, called Situs Inversus, antagonist Erich Soders has situs inversus. His need for a heart transplant related to this condition leads him to seek treatment at an exclusive, high tech Japanese medical facility. A possible alternative to directly killing him is to destroy his replacement heart, leaving him on the operating table without a viable replacement. This mission also references the rarity of finding a right sided donor heart by hinting that an illegal black market organ trade occurred to obtain a right sided heart from a homeless Brazilian boy.

Using spamming, website defacement, malware, phishing, and denial- of-service attacks, it has targeted terrorist organizations, political opposition groups, western news outlets, human rights groups and websites that are seemingly neutral to the Syrian conflict. It has also hacked government websites in the Middle East and Europe, as well as US defense contractors. the SEA has been \\"the first Arab country to have a public Internet Army hosted on its national networks to openly launch cyber attacks on its enemies\\". The precise nature of SEA's relationship with the Syrian government has changed over time and is unclear.  Origins and historical context  In the 1990s Syrian President Bashar al-Assad headed the Syrian Computer Society, which is connected to the SEA, according to research by University of Toronto and University of Cambridge, UK. There is evidence that a Syrian Malware Team goes as far back as January 1, 2011. In February 2011, after years of Internet censorship, Syrian censors lifted a ban on Facebook and YouTube. In April 2011, only days after anti-regime protests escalated in Syria, Syrian Electronic Army emerged on Facebook. On May 5, 2011 the Syrian Computer Society registered SEA‚Äôs website (syrian-es.com). Because Syria's domain registration authority registered the hacker site, some security experts have written that the group was supervised by the Syrian state. SEA claimed on its webpage to be no official entity, but \\"a group of enthusiastic Syrian youths who could not stay passive towards the massive distortion of facts about the recent uprising in Syria\\". As soon as May 27, 2011 SEA had removed text that denied it was an official entity. One commentator has noted that \\"[SEA] volunteers might include Syrian diaspora; some of their hacks have used colloquial English and Reddit memes. According to a 2014 report by security company Intelcrawler, SEA activity has shown links with \\"officials in Syria, Iran, Lebanon and Hezbollah.\\" A February 2015 article by The New York Times stated that \\"American intelligence officials\\" suspect the SEA is \\"actually Iranian\\". However, no data has shown a link between Iran's and Syria's cyber attack patterns according to an analysis of \\"open-source intelligence\\" by cyber security firm Recorded Future.  Online activities  SEA has pursued activities in three key areas: *Website defacement and electronic surveillance against Syrian rebels and other opposition: The SEA has carried out surveillance to discover the identities and location of Syrian rebels, using malware (including the Blackworm tool), phishing, and denial of service attacks. this electronic monitoring has extended to foreign aid workers. *Defacement attacks against Western websites that it contends spread news hostile to the Syrian government: These have included news websites such as BBC News, the Associated Press, National Public Radio, CBC News, Al Jazeera, Financial Times, The Daily Telegraph, The Washington Post, Syrian satellite broadcaster Orient TV, and Dubai-based al-Arabia TV,\\"Syrian Electronic Army: Disruptive Attacks and Hyped Targets\\", OpenNet Initiative, 25 June 2011 as well as rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch. SEA targets include VoIP apps, such as Viber and Tango. *Spamming popular Facebook pages with pro- regime comments: The Facebook pages of President Barack Obama and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy have been targeted by such spam campaigns.Sarah Fowler \\"Who is the Syrian Electronic Army?\\", BBC News, 25 April 2013 *Global cyber espionage: \\"technology and media companies, allied military procurement officers, US defense contractors, and foreign attaches and embassies\\". The SEA's tone and style vary from the serious and openly political to ironic statements intended as critical or pointed humor: SEA had \\"Exclusive: Terror is striking the #USA and #Obama is Shamelessly in Bed with Al-Qaeda\\" tweeted from the Twitter account of 60 Minutes, and in July 2012 posted \\"Do you think Saudi and Qatar should keep funding armed gangs in Syria in order to topple the government? #Syria,\\" from Al Jazeera's Twitter account before the message was removed. In another attack, members of SEA used the BBC Weather Channel Twitter account to post the headline, \\"Saudi weather station down due to head on-collision with camel.\\" After Washington Post reporter Max Fisher called their jokes unfunny, one hacker associated with the group told a Vice interview 'haters gonna hate.'\\"  Operating system  On 31 October 2014, the SEA released a Linux distribution named SEANux.

It was the first English-language magazine in the USA, which was established by a Syrian immigrant. The magazine was headquartered in New York City. History The Syrian World was founded in 1926 by a Lebanese-American journalist and intellectual, Salloum Mokarzel. The magazine was printed entirely in English and was pitched to the first generation Syrians; who were born in the United States. Salloum founded the magazine as a non-sectarian and non-partisan publication that would seek, to educate the first generation of Syrian- Americans of their illustrious and ancient cultural heritage, and to strengthen their ties to their culture. In the second year of its publication, 1927, a single issue cost 50 cents, and a yearly subscription set back the reader 5 dollars. Although very popular when it was founded, it proved difficult to keep afloat during the Great Depression, and it ceased publication in 1932. However, after 1932 The Syrian World was turned into a weekly newspaper.

Biography Randall was born in Burr Oak, Michigan on December 17, 1870. His family then moved to Ann Arbor, where he spent his formative years and most of his life. He graduated from the Ann Arbor High School (now Pioneer High School) in 1889, and then earned his bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Michigan in 1893. A year later he completed a master's degree, then spent a few years teaching in high schools in West Bay City and Saginaw, living with his girlfriend Ida Muma who had a degree in classical studies from Michigan. On August 24, 1898 he married Ida, then in 1899 he returned to the University of Michigan to work as an instructor and finish his doctorate. He completed his PhD in physics in 1902, and immediately took a position on the faculty of the University, where he remained for the next 38 years. In 1910 Randall moved abroad to work under Professor Friedrich Paschen at the University of T√ºbingen‚Äî55 years before T√ºbingen and Ann Arbor would become sister cities. This was shortly after Paschen had discovered what is now called the Paschen series in the spectrum of hydrogen, and about 20 years after the discovery of what is now called Paschen's Law of electrical discharges. Randall said that he knew nothing about spectroscopy at the time and Paschen simply handed him a spectrometer and expected him to get to work‚Äîwhich he ultimately did. Even to the end of his life Randall considered Paschen his greatest mentor. Prior to 1910, the Michigan Physics Department had focused on precision metrology. Dr. Randall, who took all of his degrees at Michigan, initially specialized in that subject. In 1902, his PhD thesis measured the coefficient of expansion of quartz. During his 1910-11 sabbatical year in T√ºbingen, Germany he met Friedrich Paschen and became an expert in infrared spectroscopy. Quantum mechanics did not yet exist as a field, and the study of atomic spectra was largely ad hoc experimentation with very little theoretical underpinning. This was also the training Randall received as a young physicist. But Randall came home from his 1910 sabbatical at T√ºbingen with new ideas (as well as some new equipment Paschen had helped him develop), and went on to lead a radical overhaul of physics research at Michigan. Theoretical physics Randall and his Michigan collaborators produced molecular spectra of unprecedented quality and detail. At that time Walter Colby was the only resident theorist, so, with Randall‚Äôs encouragement, Colby recruited Oskar Klein. Although Klein returned to Europe after two years, the importance of theoretical colleagues was established. Subsequently, the University of Michigan added Otto Laporte, Samuel Goudsmit, George Uhlenbeck and David Dennison to the physics faculty. Colby and Randall also started the Michigan Summer Symposia in Theoretical Physics, an annual, multi-week gathering that occurred from 1927 to 1941. This conference provided short courses from prominent theorists, including Bohr, Dirac, Fermi, Heisenberg, Pauli and others, to audiences that sometimes exceeded 100. Administration One of Randall's central changes was to spend more resources on theorists as well as experimentalists, including a controversial program in which theoretical physicists would get a sabbatical every two years to work with theoretical physicists in Europe. At the time most of the best theoretical physics was being done in Europe, and it was partly through Randall's leadership that top-notch theoretical physics came to the United States. Randall was very persuasive when it came to securing funding; despite resistance from deans and presidents he managed to add on several new faculty as well as commission the construction of the East Physics Building (which is now named Randall Laboratory in his honor). The University refused to fund the high salaries necessary for renowned researchers, but Randall's strategy was to start with lesser-known researchers and help them develop into top researchers later on. Career Randall oversaw Michigan‚Äôs substantial growth in atomic physics and nuclear physics. In the mid-1930s he secured funding to build what was then the world's most energetic cyclotron. From 1917 to 1919 Randall was a researcher at the National Bureau of Standards. In 1925 Randall became vice-president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Randall was President of the American Physical Society in 1937, and remained Chair of the Physics Department at the same time, until he \\"retired\\" in 1941‚Äîonly to go on and extend his previous work in infrared spectroscopy to biophysics. In 1956 he received an honorary degree from Ohio State University and in 1966 he received an honorary Doctor of Law degree from the University of Michigan as well. Harrison Randall died on November 10, 1969 at the age of 98. Personality In interviews, Randall displayed a complex mix of humility‚Äîoften downplaying his own substantial accomplishments‚Äîand bitterness over what he felt were his ideas stolen by other researchers, particularly his students who went on to publish more prominently than he ever did. Despite his skills in leadership and many acquaintances (some of them world-renowned physicists), Randall had a difficult time making close friends. He considered his wife Ida to be his closest friend and most important source of emotional support.

Build A Better Athlete. Equilibrium Books, 2006 (pg. 101). The training regime, exercises used, how the exercises are performed, and the types of equipment all play important roles in achieving desired results. The need for specificity The role of strength preparation is highly valued in American football. However, it is usually performed for character development, rather than for the specific work of the intramuscular system required in football. The role of strength preparation is crucial not only for increasing muscular strength, which by itself provides an advantage, but also for developing the specific training effects of strength exercises.A Komarova ‚ÄúStrength and Technique‚Äù. Track and Field, 12: 13-14, 1974 From the adaptation of the neuromuscular system, to the stress of high eccentric and explosive demands required in football, more specific and intense exercises are needed over of the general exercises commonly used to produce football strength, such as jump training and Olympic- style lifts. If strength exercises are not used effectively, there will be a disparity between the functional levels of the skeletal muscle system and the capabilities of the neuromuscular system. Specialized strength work produces a strong training effect on the intramuscular system. Specialized exercises are used to develop the physical and psychological qualities that apply directly to football.Bondarchuk A. P. Transfer of Training in Sports Volume II translated by Dr. Michael Yessis, Ultimate Athlete Concepts, Michigan, USA, 2008. For example, using his hip flexors, a player can pull his leg from behind his body to underneath his hips forcefully, duplicating the knee drive action used in running and sprinting.Yessis M. Secrets of Russian Sports Fitness and Training, Ultimate Athlete Concepts, Michigan, USA, 2008. By varying the repetitions and speed of execution, the exercises can either be explosive (high intensity), allow the athlete to develop muscular endurance, or fall somewhere in between, all predicated on what the football player is trying to improve. Developing physical abilities specific to running, cutting, and jumping technique will have profound results in football-related strength and game performance. In addition, execution of certain specialized exercises requires concentration to develop the neuromuscular pathway needed.Yessis M. Build A Better Athlete what‚Äôs Wrong with American Sports and How to Fix It, Equilibrium Books, A Division of Wish Publishing, Terre Haute, Indiana, USA, 2006. A strength exercise which duplicates a particular portion of a skill requires ultimate concentration and perseverance to repeat exactly the same movement time after time. This does not mean that general exercises are of no benefit. They play a very important role in the initial stages of improving a player‚Äôs performance. The general exercises precede the specialized exercises to develop a base upon which the special exercises can be performed most effectively.Issurin V. Block Periodization 2: Fundamental Concepts and Training Design, Ultimate Athlete Concepts, Michigan, USA, 2008. All the advantages of specialized strength work can be realized only with its effective organization.Yessis M. Explosive Plyometrics, Ultimate Athlete Concepts, Michigan USA, 2009. General vs. specialized exercises An exercise does not have the same effect, nor does it improve sports performance to the same degree for athletes at different levels of development. The impact of an exercise depends on whether or not it has a direct effect on the sport's required skills. For example: running is directly related to football, so running exercise has a very good impact on football skill development. General strength exercises are those exercises that are used in overall body conditioning. They are not directly related to the specific actions required by the sports, or football skill. The overhead press exercise for running can be used to illustrate this concept.Yessis, Michael. Build A Better Athlete. Equilibrium Books, 2006 (pg. 98). It is a common exercise in which the arms move sideways directly upward from the shoulders. In running, however, the arms move in a forward-backward motion in relation to the trunk. Thus, while the overhead press is a good exercise for strengthening the shoulders and arms, which are used in running, it does not duplicate the arm and shoulder movements in the exact actions used in running and, thus, does little to improve that sports skill. General exercises, however, serve as a base upon which a player can add specialized exercises. =General exercises= General exercises play a very important role in the initial stages of improving a player‚Äôs performance. They precede the specialized exercises to develop a base upon which the specialized exercises can be performed most effectively.Baldock, M. Block Periodization 2: Fundamental Concepts and Training Design, Ultimate Athlete Concepts, Michigan, USA, 2008 =Specialized exercises= When the movement pattern in the exercise duplicates what occurs during a run (or other sports skill), it is known as a specialized exercise. For a runner, an example of a specialized exercise for the shoulders and arms is driving the arm from behind the body to the front of the body in the same pathway and in the same range of motion as in the running stride.Yessis, Michael. Build A Better Athlete. Equilibrium Books, 2006. Specialized strength exercises are designed and selected so that their movements and actions most closely match those required for the execution of the sport's specific skills. They also promote psychological traits such as decisiveness, willpower, perseverance and confidence to achieve specific goals. They require similar concentration and psychological qualities as those required for competition on the football field. For example, execution of certain specialized exercises requires concentration to develop the neuromuscular pathways needed. Any strength exercise that duplicates one aspect of a skill requires ultimate concentration and perseverance to repeat exactly the same movement time after time to develop the necessary muscle feel and activate the neuromuscular pathways. For the specialized exercises to have maximum positive transfer, the athlete must be decisive in his or her movements and actions to develop the confidence to repeat the action during play.Verkhoshansky Y., V.N. Deniskin, V.V. Mamadzhanyan, I.M. Dobrovolsky, ‚ÄúFactors That Influence the Working Effect of Explosive Force in Speed-Strength Types of Sports‚Äù, Fitness and Sports Review International, 29-3 & 4, 1994. Football strength training Types of equipment Free weights are recommended over machine weights for almost all athletes.Yessis, Michael. Build A Better Athlete. Equilibrium Books, 2006 (pg. 102) When one uses free weights (barbells, dumbbells, medicine balls, rubber tubing, etc.), the resistance can be moved in a manner more suited to the sports skill‚Äôs intramuscular pattern. With free weights, the athlete must guide and control the movement throughout the execution. In the process, balance and stability are developed because the entire body participates in every exercise, especially when relatively heavy weights are used. When the \\"marshmallow\\" machine weights are used, one must do what the machine dictates. The athlete is guided by the machine, rather than by what the body or limbs are intended to do. The machine isolates specific muscles and helps make them stronger, but that muscle hypertrophy will not necessarily be practical for any particular sport. Therefore, machine exercises are useful for general conditioning purposes, not specificity. Medicine balls are used in many different exercises to develop muscular strength and endurance, total body power, and flexibility, but their greatest value lies in explosive midsection and arm training. The sudden forces experienced upon catching a weighted ball also imitate what occurs during play in football when contact is made with another player. Rubber tubing (as opposed to dumbbells, barbells, or exercise machines) allows the athlete to duplicate movement patterns seen in the execution of football skills.Yessis, Michael. Build A Better Athlete. Equilibrium Books, 2006 (pg. 103). With rubber tubing, the athlete can create resistance in any and all directions so that replication of the sports skill movement pattern is possible. The rubber tubing must have specific tensions and accessories so it can be attached to different parts of the body, as well as to different objects on the field, in the gym or at home.

He was a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM), which are in a coalition in his municipality. The National Action Party (PAN) had ruled Matehuala for several years, and Morales P√©rez was scheduled to take office in September 2012. On August 12, 2012, he and his campaign manager Juan Francisco Hern√°ndez Colunga were killed by gunfire while driving home from a birthday party. Hern√°ndez's wife survived the attack but could not identify the perpetrators. Several publications described the attack as part of a broader crime wave. Three days earlier a van with fourteen corpses in the back had been found next to a highway in the state. In Veracruz on August 12, a family of seven, including four children, were found beheaded. In the state of Michoac√°n that same week, gangsters burned several buses and engaged in gun battles with the Mexican authorities. The Mexican authorities believe that the criminal group known as Los Zetas was behind the attack, and five municipal police officers have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the dual assassination. Personal life and family Morales P√©rez was born into an entrepreneur family, and studied at Civil Engineering at the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Matehuala. Upon graduation, he began working for Constructions Tribasa, a construction company that allowed him to participate in several infrastructure projects in Mexico and Guatemala. He then created his own construction company and began offering services to the municipality of Matehuala. He became popular in Matehuala for financing sport events and dance contests. In early 2012, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) recruited Morales P√©rez and proposed him for the municipal candidacy. He was survived by his wife, Noelia Cortez de Morales, and his three children. Assassination On August 12, 2012, Morales P√©rez and his campaign manager, Juan Francisco Hern√°ndez Colunga, were driving home from a quincea√±era party at around 1:45 a.m. when several gunmen ambushed them in the streets of the city of Matehuala, San Luis Potos√≠. The ambush took place just 60 meters away from the party, when two white Honda vehicles carrying a total of nine gunmen shot at Morales P√©rez's vehicle after they tried to get away. Both of them died at the scene, while Claudia Mart√≠nez de Hern√°ndez, the wife of Hern√°ndez Colunga and the only living witness, was gravely injured and was taken to the nearest hospital; she could not identify the perpetrators. The Mexican authorities received the emergency call of the attack at around 2:00 a.m. and went to the scene, but Morales P√©rez was found dead in the back seat of the car, while his campaign manager died in the driver's seat. More than 100 .223 and 7.62 mm caliber shells were found at the crime scene. The killers were not found but the Mexican authorities indicated that Los Zetas were the probable perpetrators of the attack. =Background= The state of San Luis Potos√≠ experienced an increase in drug-related violence several months prior to Morales P√©rez's assassination. According to official figures, 39 people were murdered in July 2012 in the state, compared to the 13 killed during the same month in 2011. In the first two weeks of August 2011, 33 people were killed, including the gruesome discovery of 14 mutilated bodies inside a van on August 9. Later that day, the death toll reached 21 dead after the Mexican Army and members of organized crime engaged in several gun battles throughout the state. The state authorities contributed the wave of violence to an infighting between rival groups of Los Zetas that fight for the control of San Luis Potos√≠. Reportedly, the 14 bodies found inside the van were members of the Coahuila-based faction of Los Zetas led by Iv√°n Vel√°zquez Caballero. Those who carried out the attack were killers supposedly under the orders of Miguel Trevi√±o Morales. Other Mexican sources indicate that the feud between the Zeta factions are between Trevi√±o Morales and Heriberto Lazcano. In addition, the surge in violence across the state may be partially attributed to the high summer temperatures throughout Mexico, since extreme weather conditions alter the patterns of drug harvesting and force the cartels to look for other sources of revenue during that time of the year. The \\"summer effect\\" ‚Äì a term coined by Alejandro Hope, a security specialist ‚Äì leads for more people to spend time outdoors, making criminal activities more visible, like drug sales, for example. In addition, the school calendar results in the absence of parental supervision, facilitating teenage recruitment by the drug trafficking organizations. Hope argues that the media outlets have played an important role in the perception of the drug violence documented in August 2012 in Mexico. The Mexican newspaper Milenio reported more than 38 killings throughout the country on August 9, 2012. Although these figures received a lot of coverage, Mexico experiences a rate of 60 drug-related murders per day, but these killings usually never make it to the national media and are rarely reported. Consequently, Hopes argues that the increase in violence may simply be \\"the spectacle of violence and not violence itself.\\" Los Zetas have had a stronghold in the state of San Luis Potos√≠ for several years; back in February 2011, gunmen of the Zetas cartel ambushed and killed the U.S. agent Jaime Zapata while traveling through the Pan American Highway. =Funeral= The mass ceremony and burial of Morales P√©rez and his campaign manager were held on August 13. More than 1,000 people attended the ceremony, including local politicians and former mayors of Matehuala. After the mass was over, a mariachi group played songs in memory of Morales P√©rez and Hern√°ndez Colunga outside the chapel where the mass was held as their coffins were taken to Jardines de la Luz cemetery. =Aftermath= San Luis Potos√≠ governor Fernando Toranzo Fern√°ndez responded by calling on federal military forces to reinforce law enforcement throughout the state. In response to the drug-related murders in San Luis Potos√≠, the Mexican government deployed 15,735 federal agents to seven states across Mexico on August 14, 2012. Of these, 11,835 are from the Mexican Armed Forces and 3,900 are from the Federal Police. Five police officers from the municipality of Matehuala were detained on August 17, 2012 for their alleged participation in the assassination of Morales P√©rez. According to the evidence presented by the authorities, the police officers were watching over at the party where Morales P√©rez was present but were reportedly \\"called to the station\\" just before the attack occurred. Nonetheless, their involvement in the crime and the reason for the attack remains unknown. In honor of Morales P√©rez, the municipality of Matehuala cancelled the celebration of the Mexican Independence Day on 16 September 2012. The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) appointed H√©ctor Ferm√≠n √Åvila Lucero as the mayor of Matehuala on 21 September 2012.

Costigan left the Communist Party in 1940, shortly after the conclusion of the Nazi-Soviet Pact. In 1948, Costigan provided testimony as a friendly witness to the Canwell Committee of the Washington State Legislature, charged with investigating Communist influence in the state.

The injustice of the event, which culminated in an IWW member being pulled from jail by an organized band and lynched, was instrumental in moving the young Costigan to himself become involved in radical politics. Costigan worked in local lumber mills and retail shops even while in high school. Following graduation he attended Whitman College and Washington State Normal School at Bellingham, where he trained to be a teacher. While in college Costigan learned how to cut hair and became a member of the haircutter's union. Upon graduation from college Costigan was employed as a teacher in Vancouver, Washington, where he also coached athletics. =Political career= In 1934 Costigan became actively involved in politics, helping to organize a state- level social democratic organization called the Commonwealth Builders, serving as Executive Secretary of the new group and editor of its official newspaper.\\"Biographical Note,\\" in \\"Guide to the Howard Costigan Papers, 1933-1989,\\" Suzzallo Library Special Collections, University of Washington, Seattle. According to Costigan's later sworn testimony to Congress > \\"The Commonwealth Builders was an organization originally of protesting and > unemployed citizens who were displeased at the fact that they were expected > to go up in front of soup kitchens when they preferred working with tools to > build themselves and adequate standard of living... > > \\"They decided that as long as private industry couldn't provide them with > the chance to do it that it was the duty of the state, and they nominated > candidates who supported what we call the Economic Security Act of 1935; and > I might add that that act almost passed the House of Representatives. It > got, I believe, 48 votes and there were 99 members in the House. And we > elected on the Commonwealth Builders ticket 41 members of the House of > Representatives in 1934, and I have forgotten the number in the State > Senate..., about a third if my memory serves me right...\\"\\"Testimony of > Howard Costigan,\\" pg. 5978. The Commonwealth Builders provided the core for a new expanded organization established in 1935, the Washington Commonwealth Federation, of which Costigan was named the Executive Secretary. This group, which drew inspiration from the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation of Canada, continued to play a decisive role in Democratic Party politics in Washington state, working to elect political candidates and to push forward the New Deal program of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Costigan was a proficient public speaker on political and in 1935 this affinity soon gained him a place at Seattle radio station KIRO-AM (known as KPCB until 1937), where he worked as a political commentator and interviewer. Costigan would remain in this capacity for more than a decade, with his broadcasts frequently picked up for a national audience by the CBS and Mutual radio networks. In December 1936, during the height of the international communist movement's attempt at fostering political cooperation with socialists and liberals under the banner of the Popular Front against Fascism, Costigan joined the Communist Party USA.\\"Testimony of Howard Costigan,\\" pg. 5977. According to his own testimony, Costigan signed his application for party membership with the pseudonym \\"Jack Robinson\\" and was accepted as a secret member of the organization, paid no dues, and did not attend meetings of local party units. Despite this unpublicized membership, Costigan indicates he was coopted into membership in the governing bureau of the Pacific Northwest district of the Communist Party in 1937 and remained in that capacity until 1939. During this interval Costigan shaped the policy of the Washington Commonwealth Federation in accord with policy initiatives of the Communist Party. Costigan left the CPUSA early in 1940, a few months after the conclusion of the conclusion of the Nazi-Soviet Pact. It was also at this time that he left the Washington Commonwealth Federation to work on the 1940 Roosevelt re-election campaign. Costigan ran for political office himself for the first time in 1944, when he entered the Democratic primary election for U.S. Congress, attempting to win the seat vacated by Warren Magnuson, who decided to run instead for U.S. Senate. This effort proved unsuccessful, however, with the seat being won by Washington Commonwealth Federation stalwart and secret Communist Party member\\"Testimony of Howard Costigan,\\" pg. 5987. Hugh DeLacy. In 1944 Costigan was appointed head of the Division of Progress and Industry Development of the Washington State Department of Conservation and Development, also working for the state's publicity division.\\"Testimony of Howard Costigan,\\" pg. 5976. He remained in this politically appointed position until resigning in 1946. Costigan ran once more for political office in 1946, again running unsuccessfully against Hugh DeLacy in the Democratic primary. Following his defeat in that election by the more radical DeLacy ‚Äî who ultimately lost his seat in the November general election ‚Äî Costigan was hired to help establish a new organization called Pacific Northwest United. This was to be a mainstream political organization bringing together representatives of industry, agriculture, labor, and government and included the active participation of Seattle mayor William F. Devin and Portland mayor Earl Riley. Costigan would serve as Executive Secretary of this organization. =1948 anti-communist testimony= Former Washington Congressman Hugh DeLacy was among those named as a member of the Communist Party by Howard Costigan in his 1948 Canwell Committee testimony. On February 2, 1948, Costigan gave testimony to the Canwell Committee of the Washington State Legislature, a state-level organization patterned on the national House Committee on Un-American Activities charged with the investigation of Communism in Washington state.Albert F. Canwell, et al., First Report, Un- American Activities in Washington State, 1948: Report of Joint Fact Finding Committee on Un-American Activities: Established by the Thirtieth Legislature under House Concurrent Resolution No. 10. Olympia, WA: The House, n.d. [1948]; pg. 359. Costigan testified that the Washington Commonwealth Federation had been established in 1935 by liberal and labor groups over the opposition of the Communist Party as a means for advancing Roosevelt's New Deal agenda.Albert F. Canwell, et al., First Report, Un-American Activities in Washington State, 1948, pg. 360. It was only in 1936, according to Costigan's testimony, that the CPUSA warmed up to the idea of using its trade union and liberal connections for the \\"penetration\\" of the Washington Commonwealth Federation, including its executive board. Costigan told the committee that the Communists diligently supported the Roosevelt administration and the WCF as a bulwark against the spread of fascism and that Communists in the WCF were \\"the most ardent and perhaps the most conservative\\" supporters of these institutions. Costigan testified that only in 1939, with the coming of the pact between the Soviet Union and Hitlerite Germany, did he note the primary emphasis of the Communist Party in supporting the interests of Soviet foreign policy.Albert F. Canwell, et al., First Report, Un-American Activities in Washington State, 1948, pg. 361. Costigan insisted that he had paid no party dues and carried no party card and \\"frankly had no feeling of being in the Party, except to consult with these people\\" throughout the 1937 to 1939 interval. After breaking with the CPUSA in 1940, Costigan noted that he had run against \\"the line that DeLacy and the rest of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party\\" were promoting until by the time of the 1946 elections Costigan found himself \\"probably hated more than anyone in the Pacific Northwest by the Communist Party.\\" During his Canwell Committee testimony Costigan named as members of the Communist Party former Congressman Hugh DeLacy,Albert F. Canwell, et al., First Report, Un-American Activities in Washington State, 1948, pg. 365. old age pension activists William Pennock and N.P. Atkinson,Albert F.

Canwell, et al., First Report, Un-American Activities in Washington State, 1948, pg. 368. Costigan separated from his wife in April 1948 and moved to Southern California, where he worked on behalf of the United Nations Appeal for Children. He subsequently served as the Executive Secretary of the Labor League of Hollywood Voters and as director of publicity for the Hollywood Film Council. He was also employed by the California Democratic Party's State Central Committee in 1948 and 1949. From 1950 through 1954 Costigan served as the assistant to Roy Brewer, who occupied leading roles in the Hollywood Film Council and Council Against Communist Aggression in addition to heading the Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators union. =1954 anti-communist testimony= In 1954 the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) turned its attention to radicalism in the Pacific Northwest. Howard Costigan was called on May 28, 1954, as a friendly witness. In his testimony Costigan detailed his own biography and the formation of the Commonwealth Builders and Washington Commonwealth Federation for the committee and named as members of the Communist Party journalists Lowell Wakefield, Jim Cour, and Ellen McGrath,\\"Testimony of Howard Costigan,\\" pg. 5982. his former secretaries Sylvia Keen and Irene Borowski,\\"Testimony of Howard Costigan,\\" pg. 5983.

Costigan also noted to HUAC that he had worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other departments of the U.S. Government, including the Immigration department, since the conclusion of World War II.\\"Testimony of Howard Costigan,\\" pg. 5993. Costigan argued to the committee that it was essential for conservatives to allow for \\"freedom for the expression of progressive and liberal ideas, in an effort to ameliorate conditions that give the Communists adequate soil in which to fortify.\\" He also declared that progressives and liberals needed to learn that \\"under no circumstance\\" was the Communist Party a force for the advancement of humanitarian values, but rather existed as part of \\"the most reactionary force in the world.\\"\\"Testimony of Howard Costigan,\\" pp. 5993-5994. =Later years= After 1955 Costigan worked as an independent consultant and writer, counting among his clients the House Committee on Un-American Activities, for whom he helped investigate Communist influence in the motion picture industry. Costigan moved to Fresno, California in 1970 and was active in the political campaigns of anti-communist Washington Senator Henry M. Jackson. In the late 1970s Costigan began to research and write his memoirs, aided by his second wife, but the book was never finished. =Death and legacy= Howard Costigan died on October 7, 1985. He was 81 years old at the time of his death. Costigan's papers are held in the Special Collections department of Suzzallo Library at the University of Washington in Seattle.

Written and directed by George Mastras, it originally aired on AMC in the United States on August 12, 2012\\\\.  Plot  A young boy rides on a dirt bike through the desert. Encountering a wild tarantula, he allows it to crawl over his hands before placing it in a jar. He hears a distant freight train and rides toward it. Walt pays a visit to the recently promoted Hank at his new DEA office. During their conversation, Walt confesses that his marriage to Skyler is failing, feigning tears. When Hank leaves momentarily to get coffee, Walt installs eavesdropping bugs on the computer and inside a picture frame sitting on top of Hank's desk. Later, Walt, Jesse, and Mike interrogate Lydia about the tracking device found affixed to the bottom of one of Madrigal's methylamine barrels. Mike and Walt believe that she planted it and decide to kill her. After forcing Lydia to contact Hank and report her discovery, the crew eavesdrops on Hank's next phone call, learning that it was actually placed by a DEA team in Houston that epoxied tracking devices to all of the methylamine barrels in Madrigal's warehouse. Although exonerated, Lydia is now useless to the trio, as all of the barrels in her warehouse are tracked. Desperate to avoid being killed, Lydia tries to prove her worth by asserting that she can access an \\"ocean\\" of methylamine. In exchange for Walt's promise of safety, she reveals that Madrigal's methylamine is transported through New Mexico via freight train, and that the train passes through a three-mile stretch of \\"dark territory\\" in McKinley County where its communications go dead. Lydia explains she has access to the train‚Äôs final manifest when it is uploaded to her company‚Äôs server, which reveals exactly which train car contains methylamine, and giving them about six hours' lead time to prepare a robbery. Walt and Mike understand that robbing the train necessitates killing the engineer and conductor, so no witnesses are left behind. Jesse, eager to avoid bloodshed, devises an alternate plan. The crew measures the track and buries two 1000-gallon tanks next to a trestle in preparation for the heist, leaving one of the tanks empty while filling the other with water. They enlist the help of Todd, a Vamonos Pest employee. Elsewhere, Walt Jr. and Holly remain with Hank and Marie. Walt Jr., who goes back to using the name \\"Flynn,\\" tries to return home, only to be curtly persuaded to leave by Walt. Skyler emphasizes her desire to keep the kids out of the house, reminding Walt of his near-fatal encounter with Jesse before Gus's death; her argument seems to get through to him. Skyler also promises to continue laundering Walt's drug money as long as the children stay away. As Walt leaves, Skyler notices his dirty pants and asks if he was \\"out burying bodies,\\" to which he candidly replies \\"robbing a train.\\" Upon viewing the final manifest from her computer at home, Lydia informs Mike of the shipment information. On the day of the heist, Walt's crew manages to stop the train by blocking a railroad crossing with a \\"broken-down\\" dump truck driven by Kuby. When the engineer and conductor exit the locomotive to assist him, Mike acts as a lookout while Walt, Jesse, and Todd drain methylamine from the train into the empty buried tank, simultaneously pumping water back in to ensure its weight remains unchanged. The robbery is threatened when a good Samaritan arrives on the scene and pushes the dump truck off the tracks earlier than expected. Despite being told by Mike to stop, Walt recklessly makes Jesse and Todd complete the job, putting them in danger; as the train rolls away, Jesse is forced to lie underneath it and Todd has to jump from its top. As Walt, Jesse, and Todd celebrate the heist's apparent success, they turn to see the boy with the dirtbike. The boy waves to them; Todd returns the wave, but then shoots and kills the boy as a horrified Jesse pleads with him not to.  Production  \\"Dead Freight\\" was written and directed by George Mastras, making his directorial debut on the series. Mastras revealed that the episode was logistically complicated to film because many cameras were needed to capture the lengthy train heist sequence. On the first day of filming the sequence, the train broke down. According to Vince Gilligan, the sequence took four days to shoot. The episode was originally titled \\"Dark Territory,\\" but was changed to avoid confusion with the film Under Siege 2: Dark Territory. Coincidentally, that film also features actor Jonathan Banks. Mastras explains that \\"dead freight\\" refers to wasted space on a vessel that has been paid for in full.  Reception  Critics praised the character development of Todd, played by Jesse Plemons = Ratings = \\"Dead Freight\\" was watched by 2.48 million viewers and received a 1.3 rating among viewers aged 18‚Äì49. = Critical reception = The episode received universal acclaim from critics and is considered one of the best in the series, with many critics praising the deadly train heist sequence and the ending scene that depicts Todd Alquist (Jesse Plemons)'s character development. Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club rated it as an A-. Though she criticized the material with Skyler and Walt Jr., calling it \\"clumsily functional\\", she stated that \\"this weak patch is more than made up for by the tremendous extended heist sequence and its tragic culmination, which is both well-conceived and perfectly shot.\\" Seth Amitin of IGN rated the episode with a 10 out of 10, calling it \\"beautifully crafted\\" and \\"excellently executed\\". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called \\"Dead Freight\\" a \\"great episode\\", stating: \\"So much fun, and then such a devastating but not unfair gut punch at the end.\\" Sean T. Collins of Rolling Stone called the episode \\"harrowing, heartbreaking, magnificent television\\". George Mastras was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for writing this episode. TV Guide's 65 Best Episodes of the 21st Century listed \\"Dead Freight\\" as just outside the top 10, but was mentioned as three alternate choices for that distinction. In 2019, The Ringer ranked \\"Dead Freight\\" as the 18th best out of the 62 total Breaking Bad episodes.

Church (1878‚Äì1936) was an American engineer and early roller coaster designer. He is most famous for his \\"Bobs\\" series of roller coasters that featured severe banking, steep drops, and nonstop action. History Fred Church was often associated with Tom Prior and his business partners, after Tom's death, Frank Prior. Church had met Tom Prior in Chicago when Prior was publicity director at White City and Riverview Park, Chicago's two great amusement parks. Church was born in Ontario Canada, studied mechanical engineering at Tufts University, and landed a job at Webster Manufacturing and Engineering near Chicago. The company designed and fabricated replacement parts for amusement park rides. Church was working on side-friction roller coaster car designs and began developing an interest in inventing new rides.http://www.westland.net/venicehistory/articles/church.htm Later coasters by Prior and Church would be built by Harry Traver, a legendary coaster builder and designer. Throughout the 1920s, Prior and Church coasters were built by Arthur Looff. (double out and back coasters) Notable roller coasters Three of Church's coasters are still operating. They are: * Dragon Coaster, Playland Park, 1929 * Giant Dipper, Belmont Park, 1925 * Giant Dipper, Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, 1924 http://www.rcdb.com/r.htm?ot=2&pe;=6875 Additional Church coasters that are well-known, but no longer standing, include: * Airplane Coaster, Playland Park, 1928‚Äì1957 * Bobs, Riverview Park, 1924‚Äì1967 * Cyclone Racer, The Pike, 1930‚Äì1968 * Thunderbolt, Savin Rock, 1925‚Äì1938 * Tornado, Coney Island, 1926‚Äì1977 The 1921-built Big Dipper at Playland in San Francisco (1921‚Äì1955) was at one time said to be an early Prior and Church coaster. However, park owner Arthur Looff built the Big Dipper with his own crew. Looff made a deal with Prior and Church to use the ride as a showcase for other potential parks wanting the new double out and back style roller coaster in their park. He would land the role as coaster builder for at least three double out and back coasters from the Big Dipper's ride popularity. The most famous roller coaster in the world today, the Cyclone at Coney Island, is similar in design to the Big Dipper. Rolling stock Church developed a rolling stock with flanged wheels for negotiating steep curves. Prior and Church coaster trains typically consisted of ten or eleven single-bench cars with open-air fronts, each bench securing up to three riders with a leather strap lap restraint. Racing Derby Prior and Church are the creators of a carousel-type ride often called a Racing Derby.

Gaertner and John F. Dovidio that outlines the processes through which intergroup bias may be reduced.Gaertner, S. L., Dovidio, J. F., Anastasio, P. A., Bachman, B. A., & Rust, M. C. (1993). The Common Ingroup Identity Model: Recategorization and the reduction of intergroup Bias. European Review of Social Psychology, 4, 1-26. Intergroup bias is a preference for one's in-group over the out-group. Derived from the social identity approach to intergroup behaviour, the common ingroup identity model is rooted in the process of social categorization, or how people conceive of group boundaries. The model describes how intergroup bias can be reduced if members of different groups can be induced to conceive of themselves to be part of the same group, then they would develop more positive attitudes of the former outgroup members. An individual will change the way they view the out-group through a social categorization process called recategorization where former out-group members become incorporated into individual's representations of the in- group.Gaertner, S. L., & Dovidio, J. F. (2000). Reducing intergroup bias: The common ingroup identity model. Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press. Aspects of the model The common identity group model identifies the potential causes and outcomes of the recategorization process that changes an individual's common ingroup identity. The model assumes that intergroup bias reflects in- group favoritism rather than outgroup derogation. In the model, Gaertner describes the behavior, emotional and social interactions between the group members to be the start of the recategorization process, or the causes (see Figure 1). The outcomes or consequences of those cognitive and motivational processes then changes an individual's attitude to be more positive toward the outgroup. The model also includes representational mediators, or the recategorization processes that change the way we view the group. An example representational mediator would be the recategorization of an individual's ingroup and the outgroup from \\"us\\" and \\"them\\" to \\"we\\". Diagram of the Gaertner's common ingroup identity model The causal factors (left) in the model are proposed to influence members' cognitive representations of the whole group. The cognitive representations of an individual such as whether they perceive themselves as one group or two subgroups within one group will then affect the specific cognitive, affective and behavioral consequences (right). The causal factors of the model influences an individual's cognitive representation (center) of their memberships to their ingroup and outgroup that consequently mediate the relationship. Development of the model Although, social categorization usually occurs spontaneously on the basis of proximity, similarities, or even shared fate, it is not completely uncontrollable or unalterable. The common ingroup identity group model harnesses the forces of how we categorize ourselves into social groups and redirects it towards the elimination of intergroup bias with recategorization. Recategorization encourages the members of both groups to consider themselves as belonging to a common superordinate group. Furthermore, recategorization does not require an individual to reject their original subgroup identity in favor of the new inclusive group identity. Rather, a dual identity may be present, whereby individuals view themselves as members of different groups working towards the same goals. According to the model, different types of intergroup interdependence and cognitive, perceptual, affective, linguistic, and environmental factors, can either independently or in concert, alter individual's cognitive representations of the aggregate. In essence, these factors may indirectly reduce intergroup bias by facilitating a transformation of members' perceptions of group boundaries from 'us' and 'them' to a more inclusive 'we'. Furthermore, a common ingroup identity can be directly attained by increasing the salience of existing common superordinate memberships (e.g. a team, a school, a company, a nation) or categories (e.g. students) or by introducing factors that are shared by the memberships (i.e. common goals or fate). From this view, features specified by Allport's (1954) contact hypothesis, such as cooperative interaction, equal status and egalitarian norms, reduce intergroup bias by providing an environment which assists in transforming individual's perceptions of group boundaries from two groups to one more inclusive group.Gaertner, S. L., Rust, M., Dovidio, J. F., Bachman, B. A., & Anastasio, P. A. (1994). The contact hypothesis: The role of common ingroup identity on reducing intergroup bias. Small Group Research, 25, 224-249. Theoretically, attaining a common ingroup identity results in reduced intergroup bias because group membership is drawn at a more inclusive level. Consequently, the cognitive and motivational processes that usually generate positive feelings towards ingroup members are therefore extended or redirected to former outgroup members because of their recategorized ingroup status. The existence of a common ingroup identity does not require individuals to reject their original subgroup identity in favour of the new inclusive identity. Research A large body of research in meaningful 'real-world' contexts lends support to the applicability of the common ingroup identity model. In a diverse range of intergroup situations, it has been demonstrated that the conditions specified by the contact hypothesis (i.e. cooperative interaction) reduce intergroup bias through transforming members' representations of separate group memberships to one inclusive group. These findings have been demonstrated among diverse groups including students attending a multiethnic high school,Gaertner, S. L., Dovidio, J. F., & Bachman, B. A. (1996). Revisiting the Contact Hypothesis: The induction of a Common Ingroup Identity.

Achieving step- family harmony: An intergroup relations approach. Journal of Family Psychology, 12, 310-325. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that individuals express more positive attitudes towards racial outgroups when a common, superordinate identity is made salient. In a field experiment conducted at the University of Delaware football stadium,Nier, J. A., Gaertner, S. L., Dovidio, J. F., Banker, B. S., & Ward, C. M. (2001). Changing interracial evaluations and behavior: The effects of a common group identity. Group Processes and Intergroup Relations, 4, 299-316. interviewers (either White or Black) approached White football fans wearing either a home team hat (the common ingroup identity condition) or an away team hat (the control condition). Football fans complied with Black interviewers more when the interviewer was wearing the home team hat, suggesting that (Black) outgroup members were treated more favourably when they were perceived to share a more inclusive common ingroup identity. Early studies of the common ingroup identity model conducted by Gaertner and Dovidio analyzed how the degree of differentiation between groups influences representation of groups and intergroup attitudes. In one study, the effect of physical seating arrangements to the degree which two groups perceive themselves as one unit was examined. Two groups of four participants (AAAA and BBBB) met in separate rooms to discuss a solution to a problem and then convened around an octagonal table as one group. The seating arrangements were configured in a segregated (AAAABBBB), partially integrated (AABABBAB), or fully integrated pattern (ABABABAB). Results indicated that participants who experienced greater integrated seating experienced the merger as one unit and exhibited less ingroup bias. Similarly, relative value of members' contribution to the solution, ratings of friendliness between and within subgroups, and confidence in the merged group's solution increased with greater seat integration. Participants who regarded the aggregate group as one entity perceived the group as more cooperative, democratic, pleasant, close, and successful than participants who viewed the aggregate group as two units. These results suggest manipulation of seating arrangements changes group representations and influenced group bias. Criticism Criticism for the common ingroup identity model primarily questions the long term effectiveness of the approach proposed in the model.Hewston, M. (1996).

New York: Guilford. The potential of a common ingroup identity to facilitate helping naturalistic groups with history of conflict was tested at a University football game. In this experiment, salient superordinate and subgroup identities were demonstrated to increase behavioral compliance with request for assistance from a person of different race, as explained above. However, the reduction in bias is only shown to occur for a temporary period of time.Nier, J.L., Gaertner, S. L., Dovidio, J. F., Banker, B. S. & Ward, C. M. (1999). Changing interracial evaluations, affective reactions, and behavior: The effects of a common group identity. Unpublished manuscript, Department of Psychology, Connecticut College, New London CT. In a laboratory experiment, racial outgroup members sharing common superordinate identity was explored. The results demonstrate that evaluations of the White partner were equivalent for the team and individual conditions. However, the evaluations of the Black partner were significantly more positive in the team condition than the individual condition. Additionally, the evaluation of the Black partner in the team condition was even more favorable than the evaluation of the White partner. These results indicate racial outgroup members sharing common identity were treated particularly positively relative to other conditions, but does not demonstrate how long the common identity is kept.Sidanius, J., Pratto, F., Martin, M., & Stallworth, L. (1991). Consensual racism and career track: Some implications of social dominance theory. Political Psychology, 12, 691 ‚Äì 721. Applications Educational exposure has been shown to decrease social dominance orientation and symbolic racism.

Because students see themselves as part of a superordinate group, other issues of sub group differences are attenuated.Levin, S., Sinclair, S., Sidanius, J., Van Laar, C., Ethnic and University Identities across the College Years: A Common In-Group Identity Perspective. Journal of Social Issues. Vol. 65, No. 2 2009. 287-306 Intergroup bias can be manifested as either traditional racism or aversive racism. For example, following the events of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a great deal of controversy arose over the event and how relief was handled. On one hand, Blacks felt that relief was slow to come due to racism. A poll revealed that 60% of Blacks felt that relief was slow to come because the majority of New Orleans inhabitants and those affected were Black. On the other hand, Whites felt that the residents of New Orleans were to blame.Dach- Gruschow, K., Hong, Y. (2006). The Racial Divide in Response to the Aftermath of Katrina: A Boundary Condition for Common Ingroup Identity Model. Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy, Vol. 6, No. 1, 2006, 125-141 In the same poll as mentioned above, only 12% of Whites felt that relief was slow to come because the victims were mainly Black.USA TODAY/CNN GALLUP. (2005). USA TODAY/CNN GALLUP POLL. Retrieved 10/27, 2005 from https://www.usatoday.com/news/polls/2005-09-12-poll-blacks.htm. In a study conducted by Gruschow and Hong, recategorization was shown to change perceptions of prejudice towards the Black out-group. When Whites identified themselves as \\"American\\", they were more prone to blame the victims of Hurricane Katrina for their predicament. When they identified themselves as \\"White American\\" or \\"European American\\", they were less likely to blame the victims. For a majority of White Americans, the title \\"American\\" isn't perceived as an inclusive title for all Americans (of which, minorities are surely included). By providing a dual identity in the \\"White/European American\\" identification, White Americans were able to view themselves as part of two groups, one of which, American (to include all Americans) was superordinate. Thus, intergroup bias was reduced by the recategorization of White Americans into the superordinate American group. For many Americans, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 served as a unifying experience. As the attacks came from outside the country, a salient out-group was created. Additionally, recategorization for a majority of Americans occurred in that they felt America as a whole was attacked; the attacks increased the salience of the perception that all Americans are members of a superordinate nation group. Thus, through recategorization, America as a whole became the new in- group and a different out-group was created. \\"In-group favoritism strengthened group cohesion, feelings of solidarity, and identification with the most emblematic values of the U.S. nation, while outgroup discrimination induced U.S. citizens to conceive the enemy (al-Qaeda and its protectors) as the incarnation of evil, depersonalizing the group and venting their anger on it, and to give their backing to a military response, the eventual intervention in Afghanistan\\".RODRIGUEZ-CARBALLEIRA, A., JAVALOY, F.

The documentary discusses synthetic biology, the potential of science \\"breaking down nature into spare parts\\" and then rebuilding it back up as we wish. Summary Adam Rutherford has been studying the emerging field of synthetic biology for the past 10 years and believes that this sort of genetic tinkering is the most effective way to pass along traits between different organisms, given that this result cannot be easily obtained through typical mating of certain species. In Playing God, he discusses the creation of the spider-goat by American researchers. It is a part goat, part spider hybrid, whose genetic code has been altered to be able to produce the same proteins found in spider silk. The milk produced by these goats can be used to create an artificial spider's web. Typically this silk is produced in small quantities by spiders but with the genetic modification of the goats, it may be mass produced. The goats are easier to handle in large groups than spiders and thus this could potentially increase the efficiency of silk production and consumer cost. This technology is also being used to make bio-diesel to power cars. Biotech company, Amyris, in Emeryville, California, has applied synthetic biology to yeast. Instead of producing alcohol through the fermentation of sugar, this yeast produces diesel. The amount of diesel that is produced by this method is substantially greater than that of the conventional method and can exponentially increase the rate of production. This diesel has already been implemented in actual cars, in Brazil. Other researchers are looking at how we might, one day, control human emotions by sending 'biological machines' into our brains. MIT professor Ed Boyden leads a group in synthetic neuroscience. This team utilizes the genetic code for molecules that convert light into electrical energy and inserts it in a virus or cassette that may be installed into various organisms. Because the brain works on electrical impulses, this technology may be applied to neural circuits, in order to treat various neurological disorders. With this technology, the direct control of various light sensitive and electrical functions in the brain would be enabled. MIT professor, Ron Weiss, has worked extensively in this field and has been leading a team in incorporating the concepts of computer programming and engineering to biology. \\"I decided to take what we understand in computing and apply that to programming biology. To me, that's really the essence of synthetic biology.\\" Weiss' team published a study that discusses how they combined computer circuit elements with BioBricks parts. The way this works is that the computer circuit is able to distinguish between a healthy and mutated cell by utilizing a set of five criteria. Any cells that satisfy these conditions are deleted, similar to the way code could eliminate certain functions in computer programming. The ability to target individual cells could make this an alternative to treatments that may have harmful effects on healthy cells, such as chemotherapy.  Scientific Concepts  The area of synthetic biology is extensively discussed in Playing God. This is considered to be a relatively new field that incorporates elements of engineering into biology. It involves the blending and manipulation of natural molecules and unnatural molecules to obtain a specific outcome. Through this mean, scientists may use biology as a base for the development of synthetic life and genetic coding. This area of study has been noted with the potential to increase the efficiency of the production of certain biomolecules and naturally occurring materials, such as enzymes.  Reception  Playing God and presenter, Adam Rutherford, have been subject to criticism following the release of this documentary. As plainly stated by Andrew Marszal of The Telegraph, \\"Rutherford overcooked it, particularly in his opening gambit ‚Äì the revelation that scientists have developed a new hybrid breed of 'spider-goats'... we were left a little disappointed as Freckles, Pudding and Sweetie chomped and grazed around the farm looking for all the world like, well, goats.\\" The portrayal of the applications of synthetic biology in this documentary appeared to be exaggerated and their importance not adequately stressed. The Alliance for Natural Health International (ANHI) wrote a reaction piece in which it expressed concern about the overwhelmingly positive tone the documentary as a whole had towards the development of this technology. \\"The programme was almost wholly positive about the new technology, even though it has many serious potential consequences for humans and the planet... Dr Rutherford reacts like a kid in a sweetshop at each new technological marvel. Not once does he question whether creating spider-goats is necessary, or whether the 'trickle-down' of genetic engineering into the community is a step too far.\\" References Category:BBC television documentaries about science Category:Horizon (British TV series) Category:Synthetic biology ","title":"Playing God (2012 film)"},{"id":"36709006","text":"Mohamed Raafat Shehata Abdel Wahed is an Egyptian Major-General, soldier, and intelligence officer.

From 1889 he studied natural sciences at the University of Jena, later graduating with a dissertation on the development of an armadillos' carapace. In 1892 he began work as an assistant to Ernst Haeckel (1834‚Äì1919) at Jena, where he focused on studies involving skin and hair formation of vertebrates. In April 1898 he became an assistant at the zoological museum in Berlin. In the summer of 1898, with zoologist Fritz Schaudinn (1871‚Äì1906) and explorer Theodor Lerner (1866‚Äì1931), he embarked on a scientific expedition to Svalbard aboard the trawler Helgoland. In the waters around Svalbard, the scientists gathered a large and diverse collection of marine fauna. These zoological specimens, along with knowledge gained on the expedition, served as a focal point towards R√∂mer and Schaudinn's publication of \\"Fauna Arctica\\", an important work on Arctic fauna that eventually ran to six volumes. The mission also had significance from a geographical standpoint; Kapit√§n R√ºdiger of the Helgoland made a number of corrections and additions to the map of Svalbard, that included charting the first accurate map of Kong Karls Land.

He died on 6 February 1874 in Melbourne. Early life Kerr was born in 1820 in Edinburgh, Scotland, and was great-nephew of the past New South Wales Governor, Admiral John Hunter. Kerr arrived in the Port Phillip District in 1839 at the age of 18 aboard the ship the Midlothian and initially took up land near Heidelberg near Melbourne, Victoria.John Hunter Kerr, Farmer & Artefact Collector Victoria estate He returned to Britain in 1841, but re-emigrated in 1849, purchasing the 'Edgars Plains' pastoral lease of 89,000 acres, north west of Bendigo near Boort, in the Loddon District, Victoria and renamed it 'Fernyhurst' (sometimes spelt 'Fernihurst'). Initially, with his partner Godfrey, he sold meat to the diggers on the Korong goldfields, and gained some success. In January 1851 he had won a gold medal for 'the best colonial thoroughbred' in an exhibition organised by the Victorian Industrial Society. and he was appointed a magistrate in 1854. However, 'Bad seasons and adverse circumstances' including the 'dissipation' of his partner caused him to have to sell 'Fernyhurst' in 1855, but he stayed on the property, possibly acting as manager, until 1861, the same year that he married Frances Murphy.Madeleine Say, John Hunter Kerr: Photographer, La Trobe Journal No 76 Spring 2005 Aboriginal ethnographic collection Kerr was also a painter and photographer and was particularly interested in recording the local Aboriginal people, with whom he claimed to have been 'always on very friendly terms'. He drew a portrait of 'Queen Jerrybung' or 'Jellibung', an elderly matriarch of the tribe, and a lithograph was later made of his drawing, which he exhibited in the Victorian Society of Fine Arts Exhibition in December 1857.The Dictionary of Australian Artists: painters, sketchers, photographers and engravers to 1870 His greatest contributions to Aboriginal ethnography came from a series of photographs of Aboriginal men women and children of the Loddon and Murray Tribes probably Dja Dja Wurrung and Yorta Yorta people,Elizabeth Willis, 'Re-working a photographic archive: John Hunter Kerr's portraits of Kulin people, 1850s‚Äì2004', Journal of Australian Studies Volume 35, Issue 2, 2011 and a collection of artefacts which he also obtained from them.

There was also an emu skin, some 'native boys' play sticks' and some examples of women's work, particularly 'native grass wrought by lubras' and 'a kangaroo rat bag'. Of special note were three items of ceremonial significance: 'emu feathers used in corrobberys'; 'kangaroo rat skins, used in corrobberys'; and a large curved piece of bark in the shape of an emu, decorated with white ochre lines, which he later told collector R.E. Johns that he had seen used in corroborees.

Having little development over the territory, Portugal's religious influence was interrupted by multiple Baptist missions by the British in 1827 and 1839. Focused on the island of Fernando Po, British Christianization efforts were cut short in this time due to Spanish interest in the territory. Resultantly, the former Portuguese colony was ceded to Spain in 1778. From the mid-nineteenth-century there were various Protestant missions, such as Baptist missions from the West Indies (in 1841), Primitive Methodists from England, and Presbyterians (in 1850) from the United States. However, one of the most widely known British Baptist missionaries, Alfred Saker, took a special interest in Christianizing the island of Fernando Po. Gaining trust from the indigenous communities, Saker lived among them and created many protestant churches beginning in 1849. Despite his connection with the people, Alfred Saker, and other protestant missionaries, were expelled by the Spanish government in 1853 due to a concordat between Spain and the Vatican. This concordat declared Catholicism to be the colony's official religion and led to some expulsion or non-recognition of competing faiths. Presbyterians were not recognised until 1906, and Protestant schools were not allowed under the Spanish rule. All Protestant churches were closed in 1952. During Equatorial Guinea's decolonization movement, Spain loosened its hold on restrictions. As a result, some religious freedoms and equal rights were granted to native citizens in 1959. After independence on October 12, 1962, there were brief hopes for complete religious freedom. However, there was severe persecution of Christians (associated with colonialist history) under the rule of Mac√≠as Nguema, president from 1968 to 1979, who wanted to be recognised as messiah. Nguema even ordered his own photo to be hung by the altar at every church, stating, \\"God created Equatorial Guinea, thanks to Papa Mac√≠as\\" and \\"There is no other God other than Mac√≠as Nguema\\". Additionally, in 1975, Mac√≠as Nguema ordered all churches to close, and the Roman Catholic Church was officially banned in 1978. As a result of these religious persecutions and limitations, tens of thousands of Christians fled the country to Gabon or Cameroon. After Nguema's overthrow, efforts were made to re-establish the Roman Catholic church in Equatorial Guinea. A papal visit in February 1982 was followed later that year by the establishment of the country as a Roman Catholic province with its own archdiocese of Malabo, and the dioceses of Bata and Ebebiyin. However, there are few national priests, and most pastoral work is carried out by Spanish priests, monks and nuns. Today, the majority of Equatorial Guineans (around eighty-seven percent of the national population) consider themselves to be Roman Catholic. Protestant Christians are the second religious majority, making up around five percent of the total population. These high Christianity percentages in Equatorial Guineans are likely due to the early colonial influence of Spain as well as its continued ties with Spanish traditions.

Biography Founder of progressive romanticism in Azerbaijani literature, Mahammad Hadi was born in 1879, in Shamakhi, into a family of a merchant. He received his primary education in a mosque, at mullah. Later he studied at Abbas Sahhat‚Äôs father mullah Aliabbas‚Äôs school. Losing his father at early ages, Hadi continued his education himself, learning Arabian and Persian languages excellently. An earthquake in 1902, demolished Hadi‚Äôs house in Shamakhi. Looking for a shelter and work, Hadi went to K√ºrd…ômir, where he taught for some period of time. In 1906, at insistence of his teacher and relative Mustafa Lutfi, he moved to him, to Astrakhan. But he didn‚Äôt stay there for a long time and returned to Baku and worked in editorial office of ‚ÄúFiyuzat‚Äù and ‚ÄúIrshad‚Äù magazines and ‚ÄúNew life‚Äù and ‚ÄúTaraggi‚Äù newspapers.

Activities  After the earthquake in Shamakhi in 1902, Mahammad Hadi moved to Kurdamir district. For making a living he tried to open a shop twice but he was bankrupt due to his lack of experience in this field. Shortly after Hadi decided to open a school with Agha Efendi with the financial help of some enlighteners. Due to his intelligence, Mahammad Hadi was selected as the representative of Kurdamir teachers and sent to Tbilisi in order to participate in Transcaucasian Teachers' Congress in 1204.

In 1910, Hadi went to Istanbul, Turkey, and started to work at \\"Tenin\\" the newspaper that used to publish by Tofig Fikret and Hussein Javid. Because of his fluency in the Oriental languages, he worked as an interpreter. His several poetries and articles translated from different languages were published in this newspaper.

He held strong views on race and was a proponent of white supremacy. A scandal and subsequent divorce from his second wife, the granddaughter of the famous ornithologist John James Audubon, led to a landmark judgment by the Supreme Court of the United States of America on the subject of alimony and bankruptcy. Life and career Son of Admiral Robert Wilson Shufeldt and Sarah Shufeldt, he was born in New York in 1850. After a school education in the United States and Havana, he joined as a Captain's clerk on the US Gunboat which was under the command of his father. In 1872 he joined Cornell University to study medicine and obtained a degree in 1876 from Columbian, Washington DC. He joined the Medical Department of the Army as a Lieutenant and was posted to Fort McHenry. He later worked as a surgeon in the campaign against the Sioux Indians. He retired in 1891 from the army as a Captain but was readmitted and posted on duty in the Army Medical Museum as a curator in 1882. He retired on January 9, 1919 as a surgeon. He was a lifelong member of the Democratic Party and a supporter of Woodrow Wilson. Scientific contributions Shufeldt's scientific interests began during his years in surgical practice. He had made zoological and botanical collections and had published extensively on osteology. He became an honorary curator at the Smithsonian Institution in 1882 and held it until 1892. He published as many as 1,100 notes and books, often on natural history but specializing in anatomy and systematics of birds which included a study of the last passenger pigeon. He had an interest in fossil birds and contributed to Alfred Newton's A dictionary of birds (1893-96). He is credited with coining the word \\"paleopathology\\", the study of diseases and cause of death of decomposed specimens. He also took a great interest in the field of photography, using it to document birds as well as human anatomy. He published a report on taxidermy and a book Studies of the human form for artists, sculptors and scientists (1908) which included many nude photographs. He was also a collector of skeletons and was known to have dug up the graves of many Indian tribes. Shufeldt brought the work of Gerhard Heilmann, written in Danish, to the attention of American researchers. Personal life Shufeldt married three times, first to Catherine Babcock, then to Florence Audubon (granddaughter of John James Audubon) before marrying Alfhild Dagny Lowum, a Norwegian. The first wife Catherine committed suicide in an asylum. His second wife, Florence Audubon, left him after two months of marriage accusing him of adultery. Florence sought divorce on the grounds that Robert was having an affair with their Norwegian housekeeper, who would later become his third wife. Around this time he published a pamphlet titled On female impotencyOn the medico- legal aspect of impotency in women. Read before the Medico-Legal Society. which included a photograph of a nude woman who he described as a mulatto but likely Ms. Audubon. This paper describing his personal problems, thinly veiled as medical research and meant to blackmail Florence, stated his affiliation to the Smithsonian Institution which outraged the Smithsonian leadership and led to his dismissal in 1897. Shufeldt refused to pay alimony following the divorce and claimed bankruptcy which was taken up in the US Supreme Court \\"Audubon v. Shufeldt, 181 US 575(1901)\\". He took back many of the specimens that he had collected for the Smithsonian and later deposited them with the New York State Museum. Other organizations like the AOU also attempted to distance themselves due to the potential for scandal and shame. Shufeldt had two sons from his first wife Catherine. Robert (1877‚Äì1892), who was interested in ornithology, died while collecting specimens for Marietta College. Family oral history, however, called this a hazing incident. Percy (1879‚Äì1949) briefly attended Marietta College as well, and became a successful harvester and trader of chicle. A daughter, Catherine, died of diphtheria in childhood. A foster daughter was listed in the 1881 census as a nurse.

This may be done as a matter of getting the attention of (or drawing attention to) another user of a social networking or blogging service, as a matter of replying to the other user's post, or as a matter of \\"tagging\\" a user in a post (i.e., to say that \\"Jay Thompson was here\\"). As of 2012, no standard for mentioning a user in a blog post has been developed, and various approaches have been developed. Styles and history =@ (at sign)= The rise to prominence of Twitter from its launch in 2006 gave rise to using the at sign (\\"@\\") as a description for directing a public post to a particular user, especially for the purpose of replying to another user's post (i.e., \\"@janedoe\\"). Only after the usage of @ as a visual means of directing posts to specific users gained currency among Twitter users did Twitter developers begin to integrate the @ sign as a fundamental conversational tool on the site. Initially, @ was used by Twitter users occasionally as shorthand for other words, such as location or time. The first person to use @ as a description of directing a post at another user was Robert S. Andersen (\\"rsa\\") on 2 November 2006; initially, this usage made use of a space between the @ and the name, followed by a colon and the main content. The first to propose a general syntax for directly addressing users in posts were Ben Darlow and Neil Crosby, and by January 2007, more Twitter users began to take notice of the practice with various degrees of acceptance; within the year, the convention trended toward combining the @ and a Twitter username (as opposed to a real name) and prepending the combination to the beginning of a post in order to indicate a reply. Ultimately, they became colloquially known as \\"@replies\\" for their primary usage as replies to other users' posts. Twitter added support for \\"@replies\\" beginning in May 2008, with any combination of @ with a username being turned into a hyperlink to the profile. On March 30, 2009, Twitter updated the feature and renamed it \\"Mentions\\" (i.e., to \\"mention\\" user \\"@janedoe\\") so as to include non-reply posts directed at individual users. Beginning September 2009, Facebook integrated the at sign as a mentioning feature; typing \\"@\\" in a post automatically initiates a drop-down autocomplete list containing names of \\"friends\\", groups and pages, which, after one being selected and the post published, links to the profile, group or page. =+ (plus sign)= The plus sign (\\"+\\") was utilized on Google+ to select a user or page.Wayback Machine Impact =Language= Since the adoption of mention styles like that used on Twitter, mentions have also entered the vocal lexicon of Twitter users, with users, especially those who work in news broadcasting, announcing their presence and reachability on Twitter (e.g., \\"you can find me on Twitter 'AT' edshow\\") or presenting posts to Twitter by specific users (\\"'AT' janedoe writes: 'What will happen now?'\\"). =Influence measurement= The hyperlink created by appending @ to the front of a username is indexed by various third- party social media-oriented analytics applications to measure the influence of a mentioned user (e.g. Klout or The Washington Post's Mention Machine).

History The Moors had been in Gibraltar, and the Spanish had occupied The Rock for over 250 years. In 1704, the British took possession and, by 1720, they had installed a pair each of 18-pounder (8.1 kg) and 12-pounder (5.4 kg) guns. By 1744, there were over 20 guns around Rosia Bay. Parson's Lodge Battery was originally named the 9th Rosia Battery. The Parson's Lodge name is first recorded in 1761 and reputedly refers to the dwelling of the parson of a church and hermitage named St. John the Green. In early October 1840, Major-General John Thomas Jones arrived to inspect the defences of Gibraltar. He remained on the rock until June 1841, when he returned to England. Jones advised on improvements for Parson's Lodge Battery, which caused eight guns to be installed in 1842. A Hotchkiss 6-pounder at the battery At the height of its military importance, the battery had three rifled muzzle-loading guns that guarded the approaches to Rosia Bay, which is the only natural harbour on The Rock. The guns were installed in 1884. These guns fired a shell over . Gibraltar Shields, which consisted of thick layers of iron around thick teak planks, protected the guns. The shields later used bolts that were also protected against abnormal loads as they included wooden bushes and had corners filed away to prevent them being snapped when resisting an enemy's shell.Iron Land Defences, Sydney Morning Herald, 21 August 1868, accessed August 2012 Beneath the fort lies a narrow tunnel that at one time housed a one-metre gauge railway but which is now a road tunnel. The tunnel was one of two originally created to take large quantities of quarried stone from Camp Bay to the harbour's South Mole when it was constructed in the 1880s. The battery was used during both World Wars and, in 1941 it had anti- aircraft and anti-tank guns as well as anti-aircraft searchlights installed. =Post-war developments= The military abandoned the battery in the 1950s. Gibraltar Heritage Trust extensively restored the battery in 1994, whose grounds now include a field centre belonging to the Gibraltar Museum. There is a wall that goes from Parson's Lodge Battery to Buena Vista Barracks. This wall and the Machicouli Gallery above Camp Bay are both List A items and are protected by the Gibraltar Heritage Trust Act, which transferred these and many other assets to the Gibraltar Heritage Trust in 1989. Guide to the battery Detailed plan of Parson's Lodge Battery. =[1] and [3] - Coast artillery searchlights= From 1898 to 1956 these buildings housed 90 cm searchlights, which were intended to illuminate enemy ships. Each light was 200 million candlepower and a concentrated \\"pencil\\" (3 degree) beam could be projected . =[2] - Underground 6 pounder gun position= Known as Lower Parsons. From April 1941 to the end of World War II (WWII), a 6 pdr. gun was positioned here to cover the landing places in Rosia Bay. It fired a shell . =[4] - 18th-century gun position= From about 1725 to 1840 (when a larger battery was built to the left) a smooth bore gun was positioned here to cover Camp Bay. At one stage it was a 24-pounder (11 kg) firing a solid round shot, . =[5] & [7] - 6 pounder gun positions= These guns were placed for use against enemy forces attempting to land in Camp and Little Bays. They were mounted on concrete blocks as opposed to the pedestal mounting in 2 above. The threshold to position 7 records that it was completed on Christmas Eve 1941 by the Somerset Light Infantry. =[6] - 18th-century gun position= As described in 4 above. At one stage, this gun would have been a 9-pounder (4 kg) firing a shot of that weight . =[8] - Personnel Shelter= There were several of these shelters at Parson's Lodge, providing cover for all personnel not actually manning fire positions. They were known as \\"elephant shelters\\" from the shape of the corrugated iron which formed the basis of their construction. =[9] - Medium machine gun (MMG) position= This fire position was occupied by a Vickers Medium Machine Gun which was designed to fire .303\\" (7.7 mm) ammunition, the same bore as a service rifle, at a rate of 500 rounds per minute. The flanking positions here were manned by rifle men armed with .303 short magazine Lee‚ÄìEnfields (SMLE's). =[10] - Shaft To underground defensive position= This contained two MMGs and two SMLE apertures in the cliff face overlooking possible enemy landing areas in Camp and Little Bays. =[11] - Admiralty boundary marker= The wall in which this stone is set marks the physical boundary between this Royal Artillery Battery and the Royal Naval Victualling Yard, built in 1808. =[12] - Battery= This large limestone construction replaced its predecessors (see relic to the right) about 1842 in accordance with recommendations of Major-General John Thomas Jones, and was surmounted, at the time, by eight guns. By 1873, the battery had been adapted to take 3 x 18 ton 10\\" RML guns. The corridor in front serviced the latter. =[13] & [19] - Shell store= 400 lb (180 kg) 10\\" (254 mm) solid armour piercing projectiles were stored here. At one stage position 19 was a \\"side arms store\\" - in lay parlance, a tool shed. =[14] - Lighting passage= Stringent precautions were taken to prevent accidental detonation in the cartridge stores. These included \\"spark free\\" copper fittings, rope shoes and the obvious measure of lighting magazines through plate glass fronted passages or niches. =[15] - Lamp room= The oil lamps were stored and serviced in this room. =[16] & [18] - Cartridge store= There were two types of cartridge 44 lb. (20 kg) and 70 lb (32 kg) contained in bags and tins. =[17] - Cartridge hoist= At the end of this corridor (and in 12 above) was an apparatus for hoisting cartridges and shells to the guns above. =[20] - Expense magazines= Cartridges and Projectiles were stored, ready for use, in these four limestone buildings. # The northernmost (No 1 in RA terms) contained hoist apparatus for lifting shells from the storage magazines below. It was surmounted, in World War II, by a Bren gun position - since removed. # No 2 also had a hoist (for cartridges) and was surmounted from 1963 until 1956 with a 90 cm anti aircraft searchlight (AASL). This AASL was 200 million condlepower and could project a concentrated beam 20,000 feet (3.8 miles: 6 km). # No 3 was surmounted by a 3\\" (76 mm) anti aircraft rocket projector, installed on 16 October 1942 and since removed. # No 4 is still surmounted by a Bofors 40mm light anti aircraft gun position, completed on 16 November 1941. =[21] - RML gun positions= From 1873 to about 1892, 10\\" (254 mm) rifled muzzle loading guns were positioned in each of the three shielded embrasures. Made in Woolwich, they fired a 400 lb (180 kg) projectiles to a range of about 4,500 yards (2.6 miles: 4 km). The gun fired and was protected, from seabourne attack, by a sandwich of armour plate and tyeack, specially invented for use here and known universally as \\"Gibraltar Shields\\".

The daughter of two stage performers, she began her career at the age of seven; by 1932 she had become well known in Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta, Indonesia), as a singer and stage actress. Around this time she met Kartolo, whom she married in 1934. The two acted in the 1937 hit film Terang Boelan, in which Roekiah and Rd Mochtar played young lovers. After the film's commercial success, Roekiah, Kartolo, and most of the cast and crew of Terang Boelan were signed to Tan's Film, first appearing for the company in their 1938 production Fatima. They acted together in two more films before Mochtar left the company in 1940; through these films, Roekiah and Mochtar became the colony's first on-screen couple. Mochtar's replacement, Rd Djoemala, acted with Roekiah in four films, although these were less successful. After the Japanese invaded the Indies in 1942, Roekiah took only one more film role before her death; most of her time was used entertaining Japanese forces. During her life Roekiah was a fashion and beauty icon, featuring in advertisements and drawing comparisons to Dorothy Lamour and Janet Gaynor. Though most of the films in which she appeared are now lost, she has continued to be cited as a film pioneer, and a 1969 article stated that \\"in her time [Roekiah] reached a level of popularity which, one could say, has not been seen since\\". Of her five children with Kartolo, one ‚Äì Rachmat Kartolo ‚Äì entered acting. Biography =Early life= Roekiah was born in Bandoeng (now known as Bandung), West Java, Dutch East Indies, in 1917 to Mohammad Ali and Ningsih, actors with the Opera Poesi Indra Bangsawan troupe; Ali was originally from Belitung, while Ningsih was of Sundanese descent and came from Cianjur.; Though Roekiah learned acting mainly from her parents, she also studied the craft with other members of their troupe. The trio were constantly travelling, leaving Roekiah with no time for a formal education. By the mid-1920s they were with another troupe, the Opera Rochani. Roekiah insisted on becoming an actress, despite the opposition of her family, and asked her mother for permission to perform on stage. Ningsih agreed, with one condition: Roekiah could only perform once. When the seven-year-old Roekiah took to the stage for the first time, Mohammad Ali ‚Äì unaware of the agreement between his wife and daughter ‚Äì rushed on stage and insisted that Roekiah stop singing. Afterwards, she refused to eat until her parents ultimately relented.; Roekiah performed regularly afterwards with the troupe. By 1932, the year she joined Palestina Opera in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta), Roekiah had become a well-known stage actress and singer of kroncong music (traditional music with Portuguese influences). She was admired not only for her voice, but her beauty.; While with Palestina she met Kartolo, an actor, pianist, and songwriter with the troupe; they married later that year. The new couple soon left Palestina, taking month's hiatus before joining the group Faroka on a tour in Singapore. They returned to the Indies in 1936.; =Film career= Partnership with Rd Mochtar Roekiah with her frequent co-star Rd Mochtar on the cover of d'Orient In 1937 Roekiah made her first film appearance as the leading lady in Albert Balink's Terang Boelan (Full Moon). She and her co-star Rd Mochtar played two lovers who elope so that Roekiah's character need not marry an opium smuggler; Kartolo also had a small role. The film was a commercial success, earning over 200,000 Straits dollars during its international release; the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credited Roekiah as the \\"dynamite\\" which led to this positive reception. Despite the success of Terang Boelan, its production company Algemeen Nederlandsch Indisch Filmsyndicaat stopped all work on fiction films. Now jobless and depressed after the death of her mother, according to journalist W. Imong, Roekiah \\"kept silent, constantly musing as if she were mentally disturbed\\". In order to distract his wife, Kartolo gathered the other cast members from Terang Boelan and established the Terang Boelan Troupe, which toured to Singapore to popular acclaim; this snapped Roekiah out of her melancholy. After the troupe returned to the Indies, most of the cast switched to Tan's Film, including Roekiah and Kartolo; the two also performed with the Lief Java kroncong group. With Tan's, the Terang Boelan cast appeared in the 1938 hit Fatima, starring Roekiah and Rd Mochtar. The film, in which Roekiah played the title role ‚Äì a young woman who must fend away the advances of a gang leader while falling in love with a fisherman (Rd Mochtar) ‚Äì closely followed the formula established by Terang Boelan. Roekiah's acting received wide praise. One reviewer in the Batavia-based Het Nieuws van den dag voor Nederlandsch-Indi√´ wrote that Roekiah's \\"sober personification of injustice in the Malay adat wedding captivates even the European spectator\\", while another, in the Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad, found that Roekiah's performance was appreciated by everyone. Fatima was a massive commercial hit, earning 200,000 gulden on a 7,000 gulden budget. Following the film's success, Tan's continued to cast Roekiah with Rd Mochtar. They became the colony's first on-screen celebrity couple and were termed the Indies' Charles Farrell‚ÄìJanet Gaynor. The popularity of Roekiah‚ÄìRd Mochtar as a screen couple led other studios to follow with their own romantic pairings. The Teng Chun's Java Industrial Film, for instance, paired Mohamad Mochtar and Hadidjah in Alang-Alang (Grass, 1939). In order to keep their new star, Tan's Film spent a large amount of money. Roekiah and Kartolo received a monthly holding fee of 150 gulden and 50 gulden respectively, twice as much as they had been given for Terang Boelan. They were also given a house in Tanah Rendah, Batavia. Roekiah and Kartolo, for their part, continued to act for the company; Kartolo often had small, comedic, roles, and Roekiah sang songs her husband had written. In 1939 they appeared together, again with Rd Mochtar as Roekiah's romantic foil, in the Zorro-influenced Gagak Item. Though not as successful as Roekiah's previous works, the film was still profitable. A reviewer for the Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad praised Roekiah's \\"demure\\" acting. Roekiah's last film with Rd Mochtar, Siti Akbari, was released in 1940. Possibly inspired by a poem of the same name by Lie Kim Hok, the film featured Roekiah in the title role, portraying a long-suffering wife who remains faithful to her husband despite his infidelity. The film was well-received, earning 1,000 gulden on its first night in Surabaya, but was ultimately unable to return profits similar to Terang Boelan or Fatima. Partnership with Djoemala After Mochtar left Tan's Film, Roekiah was paired with Djoemala. Amidst a wage dispute, Rd Mochtar left Tan's for their competitor Populair Films in 1940. Accordingly, the company began looking for a new on-screen partner for Roekiah. Kartolo asked an acquaintance, a tailor-cum-entrepreneur named Ismail Djoemala to take the part; though Djoemala had never acted before, he had sung with the group Malay Pemoeda in 1929. After Kartolo asked him six times to act for Tan's, Djoemala agreed. The company found the tall and good-looking Djoemala a suitable replacement, and hired him, giving him the stage name Rd Djoemala. Roekiah and Djoemala made their first film together, Sorga Ka Toedjoe (Seventh Heaven), later that year. In the film, Roekiah played a young woman who, with the help of her lover, is able to reunite her blind aunt (Annie Landouw) with her estranged husband (Kartolo). This film was a commercial success, and the reviews were positive. One, for the Soerabaijasch Handelsblad, opined that Djoemala was as good as, if not better, than Rd Mochtar. Another review, for the Singapore Free Press, wrote that \\"Roekiah fills the part of the heroine in a most praiseworthy manner\\". In April of the following year Tan's released Roekihati, starring Roekiah as a young woman who goes to the city to earn money for her ailing family, ultimately marrying. Her performance received praise from the Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad, which wrote that she had performed well in the difficult role. Later in 1941 Roekiah and Djoemala completed Poesaka Terpendam (Buried Treasure), an action-filled film which followed two groups ‚Äì the rightful heirs (Roekiah being one of them) and a band of criminals ‚Äì in a race to find treasure buried in Banten. Roekiah and Djoemala worked on their final film together, Koeda Sembrani (The Enchanted Horse), in early 1942. In the film, adapted from One Thousand and One Nights, Roekiah took the role of Princess Shams-al-Nahar and was shown flying on a horse. The film was still incomplete when the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies began in March 1942, though it was screened by October 1943. Altogether Roekiah and Djoemala acted in four films in two years. Biran argues this is evidence the company \\"wasted their treasure\\", as its competitors used their stars more often; Java Industrial Film, for instance, completed six films starring Moh. Mochtar in 1941 alone. Though Roekiah's films continued to be financial successes, they did not earn as large a profit as her earlier works. =Japanese occupation and death= Film production in the Indies declined after the Japanese occupation began in early 1942; the overlords forced all but one studio to close. In their place, the Japanese opened their own studio in the Indies, Nippon Eigasha, to produce propaganda for the war effort. Kartolo acted in the studio's only feature film, Berdjoang (Hope of the South), without Roekiah in 1943. After a hiatus of several years, Roekiah also acted for the studio, taking a role in the short Japanese propaganda film Ke Seberang (To the Other Side) in 1944. However, much of her time was spent touring Java with a theatrical company, entertaining Japanese troops. Roekiah fell ill in February 1945, not long after completing Ke Seberang. Despite this, and a miscarriage, she was unable to rest; the Japanese forces insisted that she and Kartolo go on tour to Surabaya, in eastern Java. Upon her return to Jakarta, her condition became worse. After several months of treatment, she died on 2 September 1945, mere weeks after Indonesia proclaimed its independence.; The date she died was also the day of Japan's surrender which formally ended World War II and the occupation. Roekiah was buried in Kober Hulu, Jatinegara, Djakarta. Her funeral was attended by several luminaries, including the Minister of Education Ki Hajar Dewantara. Family Roekiah with her husband Kartolo Roekiah said that she felt Kartolo was a good match with her, stating that the marriage brought them \\"great fortune\\". The two had had five children. After Roekiah's death, Kartolo brought the children to his hometown at Yogyakarta. In order to support the family, he took a job with Radio Republik Indonesia, beginning in 1946. There he spent most of the ongoing Indonesian National Revolution, an armed conflict and diplomatic struggle between newly proclaimed Indonesia and the Dutch Empire in which the newly proclaimed country attempted to receive international recognition of its independence. After the Dutch military launched Operation Kraai on 19 December 1948, capturing Yogyakarta, Kartolo refused to collaborate with the returning colonial forces. Without a source of income, he fell ill, and died on 18 January 1949. One of the couple's children died in Yogyakarta, aged ten. The remaining children were brought to Jakarta after the Indonesian National Revolution ended in 1950, where they were raised by Kartolo's close friend Adikarso. One, Rachmat Kartolo, went on to be a singer and actor active up through the 1970s, known for songs such as \\"Patah Hati\\" (\\"Heartbroken\\") and films such as Matjan Kemajoran (Tiger of Kemayoran; 1965) and Bernafas dalam Lumpur (Breathing in the Mud; 1970). Two other sons, Jusuf and Imam, played in a band with their brother before finding careers elsewhere. The couple's daughter, Sri Wahjuni, did not enter the entertainment industry. Legacy The press viewed Roekiah fondly, and her new releases consistently received positive reviews. At the peak of Roekiah's popularity, fans based their fashion decisions on what Roekiah wore on-screen. Roekiah appeared regularly in advertisements, and numerous records with her vocal performances were available on the market. One fan, in a 1996 interview, recalled that Roekiah was \\"every man's idol\\", while others christened Roekiah as Indonesia's Dorothy Lamour. Another fan, recalling a performance he had witnessed over fifty years earlier, stated: After Roekiah's death, the Indonesian film industry searched for a replacement. The film scholar Ekky Imanjaya notes one instance where a film was advertised with the line \\"Roekiah? No! But Sofia in a new Indonesian film, Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum\\". Roekiah's films were screened regularly, but most are now lost. Movies were then shot on flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. Of Roekiah's ≈ìuvre, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia only records Koeda Sembrani as being stored at Indonesia's film archive, Sinematek Indonesia. Writings about Roekiah after her death often cite her as an idol of Indonesia's film industry. Imanjaya describes her as one of the industry's first beauty icons; he also credits her and Rd Mocthar with introducing the concept of bankable stars to domestic cinema. Moderna magazine, in 1969, wrote that \\"in her time [Roekiah] reached a level of popularity which, one could say, has not been seen since\\". In 1977 Keluarga magazine styled her one of Indonesia's \\"pioneering film stars\\", writing that hers was \\"a natural talent, a combination of her personality and the tenderness and beauty of her face, always filled with romance\\".

According to historian, William Dalrymple, with whom he worked on his book Edge of Faith, \\"Rohit Khosla and Rohit Bal, along with Dasgupta, invented glamour in India.\\" A self-taught photographer, he received the Yves Saint Laurent grant for photography in 1991, for his photograph of model Feroze Gujral, shot for designer Suneet Varma. He shot the first advertisements of KamaSutra condoms in 1991, with models Pooja Bedi and Marc Robinson, which not only became popular, but also turned KS into India's top- selling condom brand. Another ad campaign he shot, was for 'Tuff Shoes' in 1995, which featured models, Milind Soman and Madhu Sapre. Dasgupta worked for Vogue, Elle, Harper's Bazaar and GQ. He published several art books of his photographs, including Women (1996), Ladakh (2000) with landscapes of Ladakh, and his 2009 book Edge of Faith authored by William Dalrymple, with portraits of the Catholic community in Goa, was published in 2009. His work has been internationally exhibited, in solo and group shows and is held in the collections at Museo Ken Damy, Brescia (Italy) and Galleria Carla Sozzani, Milan. His first personal show titled, Longing was held in New York in 2007, and was reviewed by The Paris Review. During his career he also mentored \\"a generation\\" of photographers, including Tarun Khiwal and Bharat Sikka, who assisted him in the 1990s. In his later years, Dasgupta moved to Goa. He died in Alibaug near Mumbai, following a heart attack on the way to the airport, after a fashion shoot in Alibaug, age 55. A memorial meeting in his honour was held on 25 August 2013 at NGMA, New Delhi, wherein tributes were paid by Mira Nair, Raghu Rai and Dayanita Singh; the gathering ended with an audio-visual montage of his works. As a tribute to him, the theme of the 2nd Delhi Photo Festival (2013) was chosen as \\"Grace\\", inspired by a talk Dasgupta gave at the 1st edition of the festival in 2011, \\"I want to have a long string of images, held together by grace, because grace is that undefineable, non-rational, non- linear word that I am looking for‚Ä¶\\" Personal life Dasgupta was married to Tania Sethi, a graphic designer who was also his life-long creative collaborator, and with whom he had two daughters. During the last decade of his life he separated from his wife and was in a relationship with model Lakshmi Menon. Books * Women.

Early life Arnon Goldfinger was born in Ramat Gan, Israel, to parents who immigrated from Germany and Czechoslovakia. As a youth he spent many hours sitting at the chess board, eventually becoming one of the most exceptional young chess players in Israel. He attended Tel Aviv University where he majored in cinema with a minor in philosophy. He completed his studies with honors and in 1987 was chosen as the outstanding student in the faculty of the arts and was granted the Rector's Scholarship. In 1990 he became the director of the Third International Student Film Festival in Tel Aviv. In the summer of 1990 Goldfinger was selected, as one of 12 students from around Europe, to take part in the European summer film school in Belgrade with renowned Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Zanussi as the lead instructor. Teaching career Upon graduation he began teaching, directing and scriptwriting at the leading film schools in Israel including the Sam Spiegel Film School, Maaleh, Camera Obscura and the film department at Tel Aviv University where he teaches till this day. Directing career Arnon Goldfinger's first full-length film was released in 1999. The Komediant is a documentary about the Burstein family ‚Äì Yiddish vaudeville artists ‚Äì Mike Burstein (stage name Mike Burstyn), his parents and twin sister ‚Äì and touches on the history of Yiddish theater.'When to tell, how to tell, whether to tell' an interview by Nirit Anderman Haaretz Goldfinger worked on this film for four years and in May 2000 the film was released theatrically in Israel, becoming the first documentary film in years that was commercially released. The film was widely acclaimed and Goldfinger was chosen by the mainstream daily Yedioth Ahronoth as one of the top five people in cinema that year. In 2002 \\"The Komediant\\" was theatrically released in the US. It was distributed by New Yorker Films and screened at over 50 cinemas nationwide, including Lincoln Plaza in New York City and at dozens of film festivals. The Chicago Film Critics dubbed the film one of the year's top five documentaries. In 2011 Goldfinger's second full-length film was released. The Flat is an Israeli- German coproduction whose German partner is the production company Zero One Film. The film opens with the director and members of his family gathered in his grandmother's apartment shortly after her death, in order to clear out the contents. There Goldfinger soon finds various items that reveal an astonishing chapter in the family's history, one that had been kept under wraps for decades, namely the co-operation between his Tuchler grandparents and the SS officer Leopold von Mildenstein in the cause of Zionism. \\"The Flat\\" had its premiere at the 2011 Jerusalem Film Festival. In his review, critic Avner Shavit calls the film \\"one of the best Israeli documentary films of all time\\" and added \\"the audience at the screening yesterday experienced a sort of state of shock from the experience\\". In September 2011 \\"The Flat\\" was theatrically released in Israel where it has been receiving rave reviews. Time Out Tel Aviv placed the film at the top of its recommended list for more than 30 weeks under the headline: \\"not to be missed\\".

Description and Contents This inscription, carved vertically on the shaft of the pillar, opens with praise to SthƒÅ·πáu i.e. ≈öiva and recounts the foundation of Kadamba power by May≈´ra≈õarma (for this personality see Mayurasharma). This family of BrƒÅhma·πáas, who belonged to MƒÅnavyagotra, are said to have acquired the name Kadamba from a Kadamba tree near their home. May≈´ra≈õarma went to Pallavendrapurƒ´ (i.e. KƒÅ√±cƒ´) with his teacher Vƒ´ra≈õarma to complete his studies. Because of a quarrel at the time of a horse-sacrifice (a≈õvamedha) orangised for the Pallava king where the BrƒÅhma·πáas were not treated with proper respect by the K·π£atriyas, May≈´ra≈õarma became enraged and, taking up the sword, took refuge in ≈örƒ´parvata.This episode explored, with translation of the relevant passage of the inscription, in Michael Willis, The Archaeology of Hindu Ritual (Cambridge, 2009): chapter 3.

Religion The proverbial \\"end\\" of a rainbow. An observer situated at that location would only see the rainbow end at a further distance. The rainbow has a place in legend owing to its beauty and the historical difficulty in explaining the phenomenon. In Greco-Roman mythology, the rainbow was considered to be a path made by a messenger (Iris) between Earth and Heaven. In some traditions of Tibetan Buddhism or Dzogchen, a rainbow body is believed to be attainable through practice. In Chinese mythology, the rainbow was a slit in the sky sealed by goddess N√ºwa using stones of five different colours. The Irish leprechaun's secret hiding place for his pot of gold is usually said to be at the end of the rainbow. This place is impossible to reach, because the rainbow is an optical effect which depends on the location of the viewer. When walking towards the end of a rainbow, it will appear to \\"move\\" further away (two people who simultaneously observe a rainbow at different locations will disagree about where a rainbow is). In the Bible's Genesis flood narrative, after creating a flood to wash away humanity's corruption, God put the rainbow in the sky as the sign of his promise that he would never again destroy the earth with flood (Genesis 9:13‚Äì17):Holy Bible: (King James Version.) (2004). Intellectual Reserve, inc. > I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant > between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud > over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: And I will remember > my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all > flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And > the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember > the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh > that is upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the > covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the > earth. Rabbinic Judaism learns from this portion of the Bible that rainbows are a symbol of divine anger and patience. On the occasion of seeing a rainbow, a blessing is said, thanking God for promising to never again flood the world. As well, there were certain Rabbis who never had rainbows appear in their lifetimes, such as Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints founder and prophet Joseph Smith stated that the second coming of the Christ would not occur in any year in which a rainbow is seen.\\"I have asked of the Lord concerning His coming; and while asking the Lord, He gave a sign and said, \\"In the days of Noah I set a bow in the heavens as a sign and token that in any year that the bow should be seen the Lord would not come; but there should be seed time and harvest during that year: but whenever you see the bow withdrawn, it shall be a token that there shall be famine, pestilence, and great distress among the nations, and that the coming of the Messiah is not far distant.\\" Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Section Six 1843-44, p.340 In the Dreamtime of Australian Aboriginal mythology, the Rainbow Serpent is the deity governing water. In Amazonian cultures, rainbows have long been associated with malign spirits that cause harm, such as miscarriages and (especially) skin problems. In the Amuesha language of central Peru, certain diseases are called ayona‚Äôachartan, meaning \\"the rainbow hurt my skin\\". A tradition of closing one's mouth at the sight of a rainbow in order to avoid disease appears to pre-date the Incan empire. In New Age and Hindu philosophy, the seven colours of the rainbow represent the seven chakras, from the first chakra (red) to the seventh chakra (violet). Art Rainbows are generally described as very colourful and peaceful. The rainbow occurs often in paintings.Niels Hutchison. \\"Stairways to Heaven\\". Colour Music. http://www.colourmusic.info/rain.htm/ Frequently these have a symbolic or programmatic significance (for example, Albrecht D√ºrer's Melancholia I). In particular, the rainbow appears regularly in religious art (for example, Joseph Anton Koch's Noah's Thank Offering). Romantic landscape painters such as Turner and Constable were more concerned with recording fleeting effects of light (for example, Constable's Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows). Other notable examples appear in work by Hans Memling, Caspar David Friedrich, and Peter Paul Rubens. { style=\\"margin-left: auto; margin- right: auto;\\" The Blind Girl, oil painting (1856) by John Everett Millais. The rainbow ‚Äì one of the beauties of nature that the blind girl cannot experience ‚Äì is used to underline the pathos of her condition.  Noah's Thank Offering (c. 1803) by Joseph Anton Koch. Noah builds an altar to the Lord after being delivered from the Flood; God sends the rainbow as a sign of his covenant (Genesis 8‚Äì9). } In contemporary visual art, the rainbow often appears as well, notably in Peter Coffin's Untitled (Rainbow), 2005,Announcement on e-flux http://www.artandeducation.net/announcement/utah- museum-of-fine-arts-presents-the-smithson-effect/ and in Ugo Rondinone's Hell, Yes!, 2001.Ugo Rondinone Like many other cultural references to the rainbow, these either emphasize the possible sublimity of the natural world or the cheerfulness, joy, and celebration often culturally associated with a profusion of colors. In 2012, American artist, Michael Jones McKean created a large-scale artwork, The Rainbow.https://huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/23/michael-jones- mckean_n_1539378.html The project created, impart, a fully sustainable prismatic rainbow using thousands of gallons of pressurized harvested rainwater, at times stretching several city blocks in size. Literature Judith Bauer Stamper's 1987 Find Your Fate book \\"Jem and The Holograms #3: The Secret of Rainbow Island \\", involves the reader in saving Rainbow Island, a tropical island that frequently has rainbows. American legend retelling The Rough Face Girl involves the heroines seeing an invisible Chief, who wears a rainbow as a sash. Stephen King's 1985 book 'It features a scene where Ben Hanscom sees a spray bow while fighting with Henry Bowers in The Barrens, and comments on finding gold at the end of it. The 1983 Care Bears book \\"A Sister for Ben\\" involves Cheer Bear, whose tummy symbol is a rainbow, telling Ben he will see a rainbow when his sister says her first word. Dan Piraro's comic strip Bizarro featured a 2008 cartoon about fictional pirate Rainbowbeard in response to Proposition 8. The rainbow inspires metaphor and simile. Virginia Woolf in To the Lighthouse highlights the transience of life and Man's mortality through Mrs Ramsey's thought, :\\"it was all as ephemeral as a rainbow\\" Wordsworth's 1802 poem \\"My Heart Leaps Up\\" begins: :My heart leaps up when I behold ::A rainbow in the sky: :So was it when my life began; :So is it now I am a man; :So be it when I shall grow old, ::Or let me die!... The Newtonian deconstruction of the rainbow is said to have provoked John Keats to lament in his 1820 poem \\"Lamia\\": :Do not all charms fly :At the mere touch of cold philosophy? :There was an awful rainbow once in heaven: :We know her woof, her texture; she is given :In the dull catalogue of common things. :Philosophy will clip an Angel's wings, :Conquer all mysteries by rule and line, :Empty the haunted air, and gnomed mine ‚Äì :Unweave a rainbow In contrast to this is Richard Dawkins; talking about his book Unweaving the Rainbow: Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder: > \\"My title is from Keats, who believed that Newton had destroyed all the > poetry of the rainbow by reducing it to the prismatic colours. Keats could > hardly have been more wrong, and my aim is to guide all who are tempted by a > similar view, towards the opposite conclusion. Science is, or ought to be, > the inspiration for great poetry.\\"  Music  * In Rainbow Connection, a song known for being sung by Kermit the Frog, the idea of a rainbow is seen as something to wish on, as it is popularly seen as a vision, or symbol of hope. * In End of the Rainbow by September, the singer sings about the rainbow, and how she will be at the end of the rainbow and her ex could see her there when he reaches the end of the rainbow. * End of the Rainbow is an award-winning stage play with music (or musical drama) by Peter Quilter. * The group Rainbow and the song Rainbow Demon by Uriah Heep. * I Can Sing a Rainbow is a popular children's classic song written by Arthur Hamilton, despite the name of the song, not all the colours mentioned are actually colours of the rainbow. * Ronnie James Dio used rainbows as a thematic element in many of his songs, particularly as singer and lyrics-writer for Ritchie Blackmore's band Rainbow.

Flags Rainbow flags tend to be used as a sign of a new era, of hope, or of social change. Rainbow flags have been used in many places over the centuries: in the German Peasants' War in the 16th century, as a symbol of the Cooperative movement; as a symbol of peace, especially in Italy; to represent the Tawantin Suyu, or Inca territory, mainly in Peru and Bolivia; by some Druze communities in the Middle east; by the Jewish Autonomous Oblast; to represent the International Order of Rainbow for Girls since the early 1920s, and as a symbol of gay pride and LGBT social movements since the 1970s.

Lower suggested that the comet's orbit obeyed Kepler's laws (instead of being an atmospheric phenomenon or following a rectilinear path, as was generally thought at the time) Using a telescope that had been provided by Harriot, Lower made a number of observations of the moon, and noted that its surface appeared irregular and \\"like a tart that my cooke made me last weeke\\".

Established in 1427, the shrine is the oldest Catholic church of Istanbul still in use.Janin (1953) p. 582-601 Location The edifice lies in Istanbul, in the district of Beyoƒülu, in the neighborhood of Karak√∂y (ancient Galata), almost at the border with Tophane, at Kemeraltƒ± Caddesi 11, on a terrace at the top of a staircase. History =Byzantine Age= On May 12, 1427, Benedictine friar Dom Nicolas Meynet, together with friars from Genoa founded a monastery in Constantinople, on the southeastern slope of the Galata hill.Janin (1953) p. 593 The Genoese had since a few years enlarged for the sixth and last time the wall which protected their Peyre Galata citadel, and the monastery was built just inside the new ramparts.Mamboury (1953) p. 314 The church, jointly dedicated to St. Benedict and the Virgin Mary (),M√ºller-Wiener (1977) p. 100 lay on the ruins of an ancient church and near a large cistern, both Byzantine. Due to that, the church was also known as of \\"Santa Maria della Cisterna\\". On May 13, 1449, the Friars joined the congregation of St. Justine from Padova. In 1450, the little monastery had 16 monks. In 1453, shortly before the Ottoman Conquest of Constantinople, the friars sent all the relics and the religious ornaments of their church to Chios and then to Genoa, to rescue them from the impending Ottoman attack. =Ottoman Age= After 1478, the community was repeatedly shuttered by fights among friars,Janin (1953) p. 594 until Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent menaced to convert the building into a mosque for the Moors who, expelled in those years from Spain, were resettling in Galata. Thanks to the intercession of King Francois I of France, the friars could remain in the complex, which became the Royal chapel of the Ambassador of France at the Porte.Mamboury (1953) p. 315 In 1540, French voyager Pierre Gilles visited the site, and described the giant cistern with 300 columns, which were later dismantled and sold by the Genoese.M√ºller-Wiener (1977) p. 101 On 18 November 1583, members of the Society of Jesus led by Giulio Mancinelli, sent by Pope Gregory XIII upon request of the Magnifica Communit√† di Pera (the Genoese administration in Galata), took charge of the church, founding a school in the precincts of the monastery. The shrine burned several times: after the first fire in 1610, it was restored by a Venetian and French endowment. St. Benoit was the only church to be spared by the great fire of Galata of 1660, but the monastery in that occasion was damaged and plundered. During the Seventeenth Century the monastery's life was disturbed several times by plague and internal disputes among friars. In 1686 the church burned because of negligence, and was restored by the friars and the French ambassador. In this occasion the Mufti of Istanbul donated the pillars still standing at the top of the staircase, and approved the reconstruction project with a lead roof cover and vaults, elements usually allowed only for mosques. In 1696 the church burned again but was restored one year later by the association of the Merchants of Marseilles. In this period St. Benoit became the most prestigious church of Galata, being used as a burial place by the upper class of the quarter and by several aristocrats and French ambassadors. Moreover, Saint Benoit was also used as national church of the Germans in Istanbul. During these years n hospital was added to the complex. The Seventeenth-Century Ottoman traveler Evliya √áelebi describes the shrine as a \\"French church with an Organ\\". In 1731 the edifice burned again during another quarter fire, but was restored in 1732 by the French Ambassador. In 6 July 1735 the body of the Hungarian exile Francis II R√°k√≥czi, considered a national hero in his country, was buried in St. Benoit, next to his mother Zr√≠nyi Ilona. There they remained, their graves often visited by Hungarian visitors to the city, until moved to Hungary in 1906. After the Suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773, in 1783 French Lazarists friars took over the complex. At the end of the eighteenth century a chapel dedicated to St. Anne was built. After problems during the French Revolution, in 1804 the friars restored the church, and transformed the existing school into the \\"Lyc√©e Saint Beno√Æt d'Istanbul\\" () which exists still today and is one of the most prestigious private schools in Istanbul. In 1839, nuns belonging to the Soeurs de la Charit√© (Daughters of Charity) society came from France and founded the female section of the school. In 1840 the school was moved to Bebek, but after the demolition of part of the Genoese ramparts of Galata, the school moved back here. In 1865 part of the left aisle and the atrium with several inscriptions burned. This part of the church was coarsely restored in 1871. In 1867 the complex was enlarged with the erection of the \\"Maison de la providence\\" complex, comprising, among others, an orphanage, an hospital and a seminary. The church was never one of the Roman Catholic Parishes of the Frankish quarter of Istanbul, but is the oldest Catholic church in Istanbul still in use. Architecture and interior Detail of the bell tower, originating from the fifteenth century The church has the entrance on Kemeraltƒ± Caddesi, and can be reached by a staircase leading uphill. The complex leans on a terrace, perhaps part of the Byzantine cistern which once lay nearby. During the Ottoman age the site became a fruit garden, and was then known under the name √áukurbostan (\\"Hollow Garden\\"). Originally the small church with three naves had only one dome (the two over the side aisles are later additions), an atrium and a gallery, while the interior was decorated with much admired mosaics depicting the life and passion of Christ. The rectangular building is oriented in direction southwest-northeast and has an entrance on the west side with an atrium whose columns and capitals are almost totally Byzantine spolia. The edifice's brickwork is made of alternate rows of stones and bricks, and the three naves are covered by groin vaults. The main and the south naves originate from the 1752 restoration, while the north one has been erected during the 1871 reconstruction.Eyice(1955) p. 104 The first two naves end to the east with small chambers covered with domes. It is possible that the southernmost of these chambers is still a remain of an ancient Byzantine church. The portal on Kemeraltƒ± Caddesi and the bell tower with square plan and crenelated moulding, originally a watch tower, come both from the fifteenth century. In the interior, several inscribed gravestones from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries remember wealthy Levantine families, church's benefactors, and French Ambassadors. In the church were among others buried the Croatian noblewoman Jelena Zrinska and her son, the Hungarian aristocrat Francis II R√°k√≥czi, both dead in exile in the Ottoman Empire.Eyice(1955) p. 105 See also *Embassy chapel References Sources  * External links * Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1427 Category:Roman Catholic churches in Istanbul Category:Beyoƒülu Category:15th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1871 Category:Roman Catholic churches in Turkey Category:Embassy chapels ","title":"Church of Saint Benoit, Istanbul"},{"id":"36710155","text":"Periya Kozhappalur is a village in Chetpet Taluk, Tiruvannamalai District, Tamil Nadu, India (Pin code: 632313.

(NAWA) is a United States organization, founded in 1889 to gain recognition for professional women fine artists in an era when that field was strongly male-oriented. It sponsors exhibitions, awards and prizes, and organizes lectures and special events. NAWA‚Äôs 1988 Centennial Exhibition stimulated an ongoing debate in the media about female representation in the arts and gender parity in major exhibitions and historical art studies. Constitution NAWA is a non-profit organisation, based on 5th Avenue, NYC, with chapters in Florida and Massachusetts. The Board and Officers of the Association are voted in annually by the membership, which numbers over 850 (at 2020).  History  = Early years: Woman's Art Club of New York (1889-1913) = NAWA was founded as the Woman's Art Club of New York by artists Anita C. Ashley, Adele Frances Bedell, Elizabeth S. Cheever, Edith Mitchill Prellwitz, and Grace Fitz-Randolph in Fritz-Randolph's studio on Washington Square in New York on January 31, 1889. As Liana Moonie (president of the NAWA, 1987-1989) remarks in the foreword to the centennial exhibition catalog, the Club was notable for having provided a platform for professional artists, whereas, at the time, female representation in the arts was frequently restricted to the decorative. Edith Mitchill Prellwitz, Early Morning Stroll, circa 1900. Oil on canvas, 76.2 cm x 63.5 cm (30 x 25 in.) Private collection. Artist Edith Mitchill Prellwitz was one of the founders of the Woman's Art Club of New York. Assessing the necessity for and role of women's artists groups in the United States, artist and historian Julie Graham writes: \\"These associations arose out of the genuine need of women artists which were not being met by the largely male organizations of their day: they provided support, a place to show work, and they often provided instruction and models as well ... The most successful club of those founded in the 19th century is the National Association of Women Artists.\\" A New York Times reporter covering the Club's third annual exhibition in 1892 of over 300 works of fine art, drew a parallel to Parisian salons, suggesting: \\"it is well ... that women should combine here, as they have long combined in Paris, to show their own work by itself, unaffected by the opinion or prejudices of masculine juries of acceptance and masculine hanging committees.\\" As now, early exhibitions were not restricted to members, nor to New York artists exclusively, and included works by Mary Cassatt, Berthe Morisot, Louise Catherine Breslau, Laura Coombs Hills, Rhoda Holmes Nicholls, and Cecilia Beaux. Between 1892 and 1905, the Club's membership doubled from 46 to approximately 100, and by 1914 grew to 183 artists and 30 more associates. = The National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors (1913-1941) = In 1913, Club members voted to change the name of the organization to The Association of Women Painters and Sculptors to avoid association with social clubs. Anne Goldthwaite, The Church on the Hill, 1913 Armory Show Also in 1913, the influential 1913 Armory Show featured works by members Josephine Paddock, Mary Wilson Preston, Anne Goldthwaite and Abastenia St. Leger Eberle, among others. The association's name was once again amended in 1917 to The National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors (NAWPS). By then, the association had 500 members in 40 states. In 1917, Clara Fairfield Perry, an observer for The American Magazine of Art, commented: \\"One notes with interest the rapid development that marks the growth of this association which is national in its scope, having a membership of over 500 artists located in all parts of the United States and which comprises the most representative artists among women in the professions of painting and sculpture in this country.\\" In 1924, the Association and the American Ambassadors to Argentina organized a traveling exhibition of paintings, sculpture and miniatures, which were shown at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Buenos Aires and the Galeria Jorge in Rio de Janeiro. Model for the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors Medal (obverse and reverse). Model by Brenda Putnam. Photograph by Peter A. Juley & Son via the Smithsonian Institution. The same year, the NAWPS purchased a building at 17 East 62nd Street to exhibit works. The house was opened in fall of 1925, making it \\"the first gallery [in the United States] devoted entirely to the work of women artists.\\" By 1930, the association's growing debt and the advent of the Great Depression forced the sale of the house. The deal, however, was profitable, allowing the association to re-invest the money in equipment and a lease at Argent Galleries in the American Fine Arts Building at 42 West 57th Street, which remained open during the Great Depression. Karen Rosenberg, art critic for The New York Times, reflected on the Association's activity during this period: \\"The association endured and even thrived during the Depression ... Female artists also benefited during those years from the many anonymous contests for Works Progress Administration murals and other public artworks.\\" Throughout the mid-1920s and 1930s, NAWPS faced criticism for its perceived lack of innovation. In 1925, for example, art critic John Loughery noted that \\"the image of gentility ... had become attached to the older, more conservative National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors.\\" Recognizing the ameliorated but ongoing disparity between male and female artists, the association broadened its scope, focusing on extending its support system beyond New York by organizing traveling exhibitions. Responding to the criticism in the association's centennial exhibition catalog (1988), guest curator Ronald G. Pisano wrote: \\"Over the last 100 year period it was often claimed, even by women, that the Association had accomplished its goals and there was no longer a need for the organization. In the wake of each new achievement, however, the continuing need for the services the Association provides, both to its membership and to American women artists in general, has been demonstrated and recognized.\\" = The National Association of Women Artists (1941-present) = The current name,The National Association of Women Artists, was adopted in 1941. In 1961, the NAWA moved its headquarters to 156 5th Avenue. The association's centennial exhibition in 1988 featured works by both historic and contemporary artists, including modern artists Marisol Escobar, Judy Chicago, Louise Nevelson, Dorothy Dehner, Cleo Hartwig, Minna Citron, Blanche Lazzell, Alice Neel, et al. An exhibition dedicated to select sculptors and members of the NAWA, \\"The Enduring Figure 1890s‚Äì1970s: Sixteen Sculptors from the National Association of Women Artists,\\" was shown at the Zimmerli Art Museum in December 12, 1999 ‚Äì March 12, 2000. The exhibition featured such artists as Mary Callery, Janet Scudder, Margaret Brassler Kane, Berta Margolies, Minna Harkavy, Bessie Potter Vonnoh, Augusta Savage, Louise Nevelson, Dorothy Dehner, Faith Ringgold, and others. The NAWA is considered a pioneering organization for the advancement of women in the arts. It was \\"the first group of women artists to band together to fight discrimination and gain recognition for its members.\\" As Benjamin Genoccio wrote in a New York Times review of \\"A Parallel Presence: National Association of Women Artists, 1889-2009,\\" while \\"by the 1980s and '90s the idea of an organization devoted to women was starting to seem passe, as women became a larger presence in art schools, commercial galleries and museums ... [t]he National Association of Women Artists played a role in this process, for which female artists -- and the rest of us -- should be grateful.\\" In 1995, a chapter of the National Association of Women Artists was founded in Florida by Liana Moonie (president of the NAWA, 1987-1989). In December 2013, another chapter of the NAWA was established in Massachusetts, with headquarters in Boston. 128th Annual Members' Exhibition at the Sylvia Wald and Po Kim Art Gallery, 417 Lafayette Street  Advancement of women in the arts in the postwar period (1945-today)  In the United States, visibility of women artists in the postwar period improved somewhat, spurred by second-wave feminism. Institutions devoted to the advancement of women in the arts became more decentralized, in keeping with the rise of alternative spaces (typically run by artists and not associated with museums or galleries), especially during the 1970s. Simultaneously, throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, the notion of achieved equality between men and women in the arts (based on representation in private and museum collections, at gallery shows) was continually challenged. Art historian Margaret Moore Booker contextualizes the formation of women art's organizations in the 1970s: \\"Solo shows by women in major museums and galleries were a rare occurrence, there were almost no works by women on display in the permanent collections of museums, major galleries in New York represented only a few token women, and most college art history textbooks ignored women.\\" Similar concerns about gender parity in the art world are raised today. Assessing women in art in the twenty-first century, art historian Whitney Chadwick writes: \\"There remains an ongoing need to document women's unique contributions in areas of patronage, collaborative practice, photography and new media in a concise and widely available format.\\" Chadwick emphasizes the continuing need for \\"prestigious retrospective exhibitions at major museums or the full-length monographic studies that secure visibility and reputations in [the] art world\\" and support for contemporary women artists.  Mission statement  The NAWA mission statement is:{{quote\\"To foster and promote awareness of, and interest in, visual art created by women in the United States. The Association promotes culture and education in the visual arts through exhibitions of its members' works, educational programs, scholarships, awards, its historical archive and other appropriate means. While encouraging contemporary and emerging artists, the Association honors and continues the long and important contribution of women to the history of American culture and art\\". = NAWA Permanent Collection = The NAWA Permanent Collection, established in 1991 by Liana Moonie (president of the NAWA, 1987-1989), comprises over 200 works dating from the founding of the Association. In 1992, the collection was donated to the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where it has been housed since. The exhibition \\"A Parallel Presence: National Association of Women Artists, 1889-2009,\\" which ran at the Zimmerli Art Museum from January 17 to April 26, 2009 and at UBS Art Gallery in Midtown, New York from May 14 to July 31, 2009, presented works by approximately 80 artists, including Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, Theresa Bernstein, Louise Nevelson, Pat Adams, Faith Ringgold, as well as archival materials related to the history of the organization. = Archive = The NAWA archive is held at the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University. A portion of the NAWA archives ‚Äì \\"administrative and membership records from the 1960s, exhibition records, printed material, and three scrapbooks\\" ‚Äì are held at the Smithsonian Institution. Additional records, including the annual catalog, can be found at the Solomon R.

Evans-Freke was educated at Downside, a Benedictine boarding school in Somerset. He later joined the Royal Engineers and during the Second World War saw active service behind enemy lines in Burma, where he took part in raids to destroy Japanese infrastructure. He then served in British India and ended his military service with the rank of captain. Following World War II, Evans-Freke became a director of an equine and livestock insurance company. He married firstly Joyzelle, an Australian, and they had three sons and two daughters. In a marriage which lasted more than sixty years, the couple were frequent visitors to Lourdes. On 25 December 1970 Evans-Freke succeeded an uncle in the family peerage and baronetcy. He had an interest in agriculture, music and poetry. He was a Traditionalist Catholic, and became a Military Knight of Malta, one of the most important of the military orders of the Roman Catholic Church. Following his wife's death in 2006, Carberry married again, remaining with his second wife, Elisabeth, until his death in July 2012. Carbery's body was entombed in the ancient family vault, the crypt of the ruined chapel of Castle Freke in West Cork. This followed a funeral ceremony and Tridentine Mass at the church in Rathbarry. His remains were entombed next to those of his first wife, who was buried in the same place in 2006. That was the first time the vault at Castle Freke had been opened since 1852.

The hatchery was opened in August 2000 and is situated on South Quay in Padstow, Cornwall. The organisation is a marine Conservation, research and education charity that focuses its efforts on the European lobster. It exists to serve the coastal fishing communities of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. The hatchery consists of a visitor centre, shop and conference facility, as well as various culture spaces, laboratories and technical facilities. Purpose The National Lobster Hatchery is a marine conservation, research and education charity that focuses exclusively on the European Lobster, a commercially exploited species. =Conservation= The charity's conservation work focuses on enhancing the stocks of lobsters in the coastal waters of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. Should stocks collapse (as they have done elsewhere) this work would shift its focus to restocking. The National Lobster Hatchery is in partnership with few selected local fishermen and shellfish wholesalers who provide female egg-bearing lobsters which are taken in and held until their eggs hatch. The resulting larvae are then on-grown into their post-larval stages before being released into the coastal waters of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. Juvenile lobsters are released onto suitable substrate, either by dive clubs who deliver the lobsters to the seabed, or by fishermen who effectively pump the juveniles directly onto the sea floor. The released juveniles will take between four and five years to grow to marketable size. Several studies have estimated very good wild survival for hatchery- reared lobsters and have even estimated the contribution to fisheries of such programs. =Research= Juvenile lobsters at the hatchery The research work focuses on two key areas: assessing the effectiveness of stocking work and developing techniques for lobster culture. The main research priority for the National Lobster Hatchery is to assess the effectiveness of the stock enhancement program. This includes the establishment of a population model for local populations and an assessment of the appropriateness of genetic markers as a tool to measure the program's contribution to catches. The charity is also focusing efforts on in-house research and development work. These are projects specifically designed to improve the implementation of stock enhancement techniques. The overarching aim of this work is to create an overall improvement in the production of juvenile lobsters, their fitness and their unit costs of production. This work will include improving husbandry techniques, improving our understanding of the nutritional requirements of the European lobster, gaining a better understanding of the implications of disease and improving juvenile health and behaviour, developing effective release systems and developing artificial habitats for promoting post-release survival. A juvenile European lobster. =Education= The organisation's education program focuses on raising awareness of the sustainability issues associated with coastal fisheries, promoting traditional and novel fisheries management tools and highlighting the importance of consumer choice. The National Lobster Hatchery formally educates people from pre-school to postgraduate. As well as contributing to University courses available nearby, the charity offers student placements and engages postgraduate students from various universities in its research program. The National Lobster Hatchery is one of the few marine biology laboratories in the world open to visitors. As well as seeing the progression of a lobster from egg to adult and learning about the hatchery's conservation and research work, children can learn about the wider marine environment, the importance of fisheries to our coastal communities, the impact of those fisheries on the environment and the relevance of fisheries management. History The National Lobster Hatchery was initiated with a query from a Member of the Cornwall Sea Fisheries Committee in 1992. An enormous amount of work was undertaken by the founding Chairman, Mr Edwin Derriman M.B.E. (the Chief fishery Officer for Cornwall) eventually culminating in the purpose-designed building being erected on the quayside of Padstow, in 2000. The organisation was initially run as a not-for- profit company and charitable status was awarded in 2004. The organisation is now run as a company limited by guarantee and charity and in 2009 the organisation gained accreditation as a social enterprise. The Directors/Trustees are drawn from relevant disciplines and bodies and are unpaid. The hatchery was eventually opened to the public in August 2000 although there were many problems associated with life support systems during the early days as well as a lack of visitors due to a foot and mouth outbreak. Subsequently, an upgrade of the life support systems took place in 2005 along with another upgrade to the holding facilities in 2010. The visitor centre has had many facelifts notably in 2005 and 2010. Funds are now being raised for a further upgrade of all the hatchery systems, to increase capacity and to improve the efficiency of the operation. The National Lobster Hatchery is one of two similar facilities in the UK. The other hatchery is in the Orkney Islands and is financially supported by the Orkney Fishermen's Association. Lobster hatcheries throughout the world are seen as a very positive way of increasing stock levels and, when mainly funded by visitors (the Padstow facility is one of only 2 facilities in the world so far to do this), the concept is then seen as being cost-effective. Further research is required to validate the effectiveness of hatcheries and to improve culture techniques. The National Lobster Hatchery has developed numerous partnerships with various research organisations in order to further develop the research capacity of the charity. Awards The National Lobster Hatchery has received various awards and accolades including a Pride in Seafood award in 2005 for its contribution to the UK seafood industry.

When preparing the Latin version of the charter, Bishop Simon took care of the interests of his own diocese by emphasizing that the village of Magyarsarl√≥s was jointly possessed by the nuns and the bishop of P√©cs. Bishop Simon's mastery of Greek and the use of Southern Italian patterns in the Latin variant of the charter point at his Sicilian or South Italian origin. Accordingly, he may well have arrived in the kingdom in the retinue of King Coloman's first wife, Felicia of Sicily in 1097. It is plausible that he is identical with that certain Bishop Simon, who was one of the two signatories of the Treaty of Devol on the behalf of Coloman in September 1108, alongside isp√°n Peres. In this case, he already held the dignity of Bishop of P√©cs in that year. Simon was one of the bishops to confirm the oath taken in 1111 by King Coloman on the preservation of the liberties of the towns of Dalmatia. Similarly, he was one of the four bishops to sign a charter issued for Trogir and Split in 1124 by King Coloman's successor, King Stephen II. The latter is the last existing authentic charter mentioning one \\"Bishop Simon of P√©cs\\", but referring to ancient manuscripts J√≥zsef Koller would state in the 18th century that Simon was still at the head of the diocese in 1133. Moreover, a falsified charter dated to 1135 lists one Archbishop Simon of Kalocsa. Taking into account that the latter was based on a charter issued in the reign of King B√©la II of Hungary, it is plausible that Simon was elevated to the rank of archbishop following decades of his bishopric in P√©cs. The exact circumstances surrounding the submission of Bosnia are unknown but the region seems to have accepted B√©la's suzerainty without resistance by 1137, which coincided with the episcopal activity of Simon. His archdiocese, with the task of Catholic spiritual care over the province, was commissioned to integrate the newly acquired territories to the Hungarian church hierarchy. The remaining part of Simon's potential archiepiscopate is unknown; the next known office-holder Mik√≥ was first referred to in this capacity two decades later, in 1156.

It is also known as Zawgyi-One or zawgyi1 font although updated versions of this font were not named Zawgyi-two. Prior to 2019, it was the most popular font on Burmese websites. It is a font with Burmese characters implemented in the Burmese block of Unicode but in a non-compliant way. Unicode incompatibility (ad hoc font encodings) Burmese script is a complex text layout script, whereby the position and shape of the grapheme varies based on context. The support for complex text rendering for personal computers did not arrive until Windows XP SP2 in 2004, and a Burmese font utilizing this technology did not exist until 2005. Furthermore, there were significant revisions in Unicode's implementation of Burmese script up until Unicode 5.1 in 2008. Compound the fact that Myanmar experienced Western sanctions, this had resulted in much of the Burmese localization technology being developed locally without cooperation with outside. Numerous Burmese supporting fonts were homegrown in the 2000s, but they were developed as Unicode fonts that were only partially Unicode compliant. Some of the codepoints for Burmese script were implemented as specified in Unicode but others were not, therefore the font is incompatible with Unicode. This is referred to as ad hoc font encodings by the Unicode Consortium. With the advent of mobile phones, mobile vendors such as Samsung and Huawei simply replace the Unicode compliant system fonts with Zawgyi versions. There is significant shortcomings in using ad hoc font encodings. As a separate encoding, the situation leads to garbled text being shown between users of Zawgyi and Unicode. Because the Zawgyi font encoding was not implemented as efficiently as specified in Unicode, it had to occupy more codepoints than what is allocated for Burmese. As such, Zawgyi encoding took over the Unicode block reserved for Myanmar ethnic languages. In Zawgyi, the same word can be encoded in multiple different ways, making Zawgyi text corpus difficult to search and analyze. It is also difficult to sort Zawgyi text. In addition, using Unicode would ease the implementation of natural language processing technologies. Myanmar government has designated Oct 1 2019 as \\"U-Day\\" to officially switch to Unicode. The full transition is estimated to take two years. Conversion International Components for Unicode supports conversion of Zawgyi data to conformant Unicode by means of the transliterator.

In the 1850s many of the town's communal lands were usurped by haciendas, as the growing of sugar cane extended through Morelos. Particularly the neighboring hacienda \\"El Hospital\\", cut off the towns' access to pastures and water sources, and finally expropriated part of the towns communal landholdings. Around the turn of the century Governor of Morelos, Manuel Alarc√≥n, tried to mediate between the townspeople and the hacendado, but was unsuccessful. The dissatisfaction with the situation led the peasants of Anenecuilco to rise up against the hacienda owners supported by D√≠az. Originally an indigenous Nahua community, the town gradually became mestizo during the second half of the 19th century as the indigenous population crashed due to the unfavorable conditions.

M. W. Turner. It is in the permanent collection of Tate Britain.  Description  Turner created this painting in the coastal town of Margate, in about 1845, near the end of his career. The painting, which measures , depicts a hazy yellow sunrise over a turbulent grey sea. Lurking in the lower left corner are pink and red swirls usually identified as the eponymous sea monsters. The painting first went on display in 1906.  Interpretations  alt=Detail from Sunrise with Sea Monsters by J.M.W. Turner showing the area associated with the \\"monsters\\" Beyond these basic elements, though, interpretations of the painting are the source of much study and open to speculation. The Tate Gallery maintains that the \\"monsters\\" are just fish. The Tate and other sources posit that a small section of four or five black cross- hatches might be a part of a fishing net. Critic James Hamilton speculates that the mist may hide a steam driven paddleboat being consumed by giant fish or whales, which were the subject of many of Turner's later works. This steamboat theory is consistent with the interpretation of many of Turner's other later works, as a response to the technological changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution. Other sources claim that the monsters really are just that: Michael Bockemuhl suggests that the swirls combine to form a single behemoth with large eyes and open mouth that is swimming towards the observer. They may also be compared to the monstrous creatures in the water of Turner's famous Slavers Throwing overboard the Dead and Dying‚ÄîTyphoon coming on. An alternative interpretation is that there is nothing there at all; at least nothing corporeal. Gunnar Schmidt claims the painting has two zones‚Äîthe warm sunny sky, and the cold dark water‚Äîand that at their interface is a mass of drifting steam that has particles and vortices but no shape or limit. In his view, it is this thermal process that is being compared to the \\"monstrous\\" power of industrial engines and machinery. Elizabeth Ermarth goes further, comparing this painting with Turner's Mountain Landscape and Seascape with Storm Coming On, and claiming they are \\"almost entirely abstract representations of space as pure atmosphere, as pure medium of light.\\" Other shapes may also be interpreted from the painting. The Tate Museum suggests that a larger patch of red and white nearby may be interpreted as a marine float, while a 1907 catalogue from the museum suggests that icebergs can be seen in the distance. Bockemuhl sees a dog's head in a shape in the water on the left of the monster. This varied and fantastic imagery is noted in many of the analyses of Turner's later works. A paper in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine draws a connection between these figures and Turner's possession of acetate of morphia (a drug related to morphine), possibly used for the treatment of a toothache.

The building is located along the south side of a gated alleyway which connects Frederiksholm Canal to Vester Voldgade. Together with Civiletatens Materialg√•rd and F√¶stningens Materialg√•rd, it forms a cluster of low, yellow- washed buildings all of which are listed, on the Zealand side of the canal, opposite the small island Slotsholmen with Christiansborg Palace. The Hay Storage Building at the end of the barracks building, facing Vester Voldgade, originally stored hay for the King's horses at the Royal Stables but later also served the Royal Horse Guards. Both the Royal Horse Guards Barracks and the Hay Storage building are now used by the Ministry of Education. History =The Royal Horse Guards Barracks= The Royal Horse Guards at Frederiksholm Canal, painting by Otto Bache Royal Horse Guards photographed at the barracks on 27 July 1908 The Royal Horse Guards were from 1755 based at Garderg√•rden in Vestergade (No. 18). The complex had room for 77 horses and was privately owned. Garverg√•rden remained in use until it had become too small in 1792 and the building was destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795 a few years later. The new barracks at Frederiksholms Kanal were designed by court architect Andreas Kirkerup and built on a narrow strip of land which had until then been part of Civiletatens Materialg√•rd's grounds. The new barracks were conveniently situated, close to Christiansborg Palace on the other side of the canal where the regiment served as royal guards. The building was hit by a fire in 1798 but subsequently rebuilt that same year. The composer Hans Christian Lumbye had a residence in the building in about 1842. =Later use= The Artillery Barracks in the late 19th century The Royal Horse Guards were disbanded in 1866 and in 1969 the 2nd Artillery Regiment took over the premises which were then known as the Artillery Barracks until 1925 when they relocated to a new installation at Artillerivej on Amager at the other side of the harbour. The building was then taken over by the Ministry of Education. Many other institutions or individuals rented rooms in the building during the following years. Architecture =Royal Horse Guards Barracks= The barracks viewed from the canal with the gate that opens onto one of the three gates to its rear The building is a long, 2-storey wing which runs from Frederiksholm Canal to the Hay Storage Building on Vester Voldgade and is accessed from a cobbled alleyway with a gate in each end, connecting the two streets. The facade stands in orange-washed masonry divided by lesenes but otherwise has little ornamentation. It is topped by a red tile roof with many dormer windows. This main wing is to the rear connected to a parallel building part of Civiletatens Materialg√•rd by several short rear wings, forming three interior courtyard spaces, the one closest to the canal entered directly from Frederiksholms Kanal and the two others through arched gateways in the barracks building. The ground floor was originally used for stables while there was residential quarters on the first floor and feed storage in the attic. The buildings were listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in 1918, together with Civiletatens materialg√•rd, and underwent restoration work conducted by Arkitema in 1996-97. =Hay Storage Building= The Hay Storage Building (H√∏magasinet), at 199 Vestervoldgade, its gable facing the alleyway, was originally built in 1740 for storage of hay for the King's Horses. The Royal Stables were located at Christiansborg Palace but fire hazard displaced the hay storage to the other side of the canal. The Hay Storage Building was destroyed in the fire 1798 fire which also hit the barracks building, and after that also stored hay for the Royal Horse Guards' horses. Much of the building was demolished in 1939 to make way for the Post Giro Building which was built to a design by Thorvald J√∏rgensen.

Biography Elwood Decker was born in Fresno, California on 8 April 1903. In 1931, after Decker had done a tour of duty with the U.S. Army, he had come to live as an artist in the dunes of Oceano. He had found a group of artists which he joined. The artists included writers, poets, and free-thinkers, who called themselves Dunites. In 1935, Decker decided to leave the dunes to become an artist for Civilian Conservation Corps. With this new job, he was assigned to create his own representation or portrayal of the reconstruction of the buildings at historic Fort Churchill that was near Reno, Nevada. This included brick making, scaffolding, tools and equipment, and the men themselves. Over 40 of his works with this assignment were sent to Washington, and others of them were left in the state of Nevada. By the end of 1935, Decker ended up living back in the dunes as the mysterious artist once again. In June of 1946, Elwood married Ann Carpenter, who he met in the dunes, and they moved to Hollywood, California. In 1965, Elwood and Ann moved from West Hollywood to Thousand Oaks, California. Education Elwood Decker attended high school in Oakland, California and later the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco. In 1952, Decker enrolled at Santa Monica City College to study photography. Interests Perhaps Elwood's greatest interest, and indeed that of Ann, was his devotion to Sri Anandamayi Ma and many of his poems were published in Ananda Varta. http://www.anandamayi.org/anandavarta/Vol27No1.pdf page 27 Decker's interests extended to filmmaking, writing, and music. He spent much of his life in San Luis Obispo. He worked in paint, ink, and pottery, and his style ranged over many schools of modern art: abstract, expressionist and impressionist, among others. He was the subject of a biographical song by The Bobs. Death In 1992, Elwood Decker was killed by a freight train while he was walking along the tracks that were in dunes of Oceano. His wife, Anne Decker, had died several years earlier. At Elwood and Ann's request, their ashes were scattered together in a remote section of the dunes where they had first met over forty years earlier. Preservation The Academy Film Archive has preserved several of Elwood Decker's films, including Color Fragments, Micro 2, Crystals, and Light Modulators.

The guidelines were adopted by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee at its first session and amended at its second session in 1978. History The first text of the Operational Guidelines was titled Operational Guidelines for the World Heritage Committee. It dates back to 1977 at the First Session of the World Heritage Committee (27 June - 1 July) in Paris. The Drafting Committee and the World Heritage Committee prepared the text. It contained four chapters and twenty-eight paragraphs. In October same year, the Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage with 27 paragraphs followed. A year later, at the Second Session of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, the Operational Guidelines was adopted with 30 paragraphs. The World Heritage Committee, the main body responsible for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention, has revised its text ever since adding paragraphs updating it with new concepts, knowledge or experiences. The 2011 Operational Guidelines is the latest version dating from November 2011 and available in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish. A revised Draft dating from February 2011 with limited distribution is available online. Contents =Introduction= The 2011 version of the Operational Guidelines contains two hundred and ninety paragraphs which reflect the aim of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Protection of the Cultural and Natural Heritage to further facilitate the Implementation of the 1972 Convention. The key users of the guidelines are not only the signatory nations. (States Parties to the 1972 Convention) The Secretariat of the World Heritage Committee based at the World Heritage Centre in Paris, the Advisory Bodies, site managers, stakeholders and partners all active in the protection of World Heritage properties are also invited to make usage of the Operational Guidelines. =Aim= The first chapter of the Operational Guidelines aims to facilitate the implementation of the 1972 World Heritage Convention. The major goals and procedure of the Convention are given reflecting certain articles of the Convention in a more detailed explanation. The main bodies of the 1972 Convention i.e. the General Assembly, the World Heritage Committee, the Secretariat, the Advisory Bodies IUCN, ICOMOS, ICCROM are presented in detail precising their role, tasks, specific responsibilities, moreover meeting sessions, term of office, contact informations etc. A list of functions of the World Heritage Committee in cooperation with the States Parties is provided. Most functions derives from Articles 11(2+4+7), Article 13(6), Article 21(1+3) and Article 29(3) of the World Heritage Convention. In general the overall aim of the Convention and its Guidelines is to safeguard heritage of universal value for future generations. It is to give a guidance on how properties can be inscribed on the World Heritage List or/and the List of World Heritage in Danger if the properties are facing serious dangers and are in need of emergency inscription. The Birthplace of Jesus: Church of the Nativity and the Pilgrimage Route, Bethlehem were thus inscribed in 2012. For the purpose of facilitating the nomination process for properties considered to be of universal value, World Heritage is defined so as to categorize heritage into cultural, natural, and mixed sites to be handled specifically. Other specific types of Heritage like e.g. Cultural landscape is a category of heritage acknowledged only since 1992 out of the need to recognize and protect the \\"combined work of man and nature\\". All informations consisting the World Heritage List and the way to it is to be found in Chapter 2. =Criteria for inscription= Before properties can be proposed for inscription as a World Heritage Site, they must be on the tentative lists of the States Parties. The properties must be of Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) which means \\"cultural and/or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity\\". There are ten criteria for the assessment of OUV. Criteria (i)-(vi) for cultural heritage, (vii)-(x) for natural heritage. Properties nominated under criteria (i) to (vi)- cultural Heritage - must fulfill the conditions of authenticity i.e. originality in form and design, materials, use and function etc. Cultural and natural properties must satisfy the conditions of integrity i.e. wholeness, intactness. The term OUV is used throughout the World Heritage Convention but only defined and explained in detail in the Operational Guidelines from paragraphs 79-95. The protection and management systems should be in place to ensure that the OUV is kept and the Heritage is passed to future generations. =Process for Inscription= The Operational Guidelines outlines the importance of participation of community and a wide range of stakeholders in the nomination process. It informs about the sources for help and guidance throughout the nomination process.(Chapter 3) Furthermore, detailed information is given for the inscription requirements for different types of properties.

It was the first purely homeopathic hospital for mental disorders in the United States. The hospital employed a number of new techniques for the treatment of mental disorders, most notably the use of baseball as a therapy.  History  The push for a state homeopathic institution for the treatment of mental disorders began in 1866 when John Stanton Gould delivered a speech to the State Homeopathic Medical Society entitled The Relation of Insanity to Bodily Disease. In this speech, Gould asserted that \\"It has been my purpose in this address, gentlemen, to bring before you in a clear and specific form the proofs that insanity is always a symptom of bodily disease which it is your duty and ought to be your pleasure to cure.\\" At the next meeting of the State Homeopathic Medical Society, they passed a resolution to push the New York State Legislature to construct an institution for the treatment of mental disorders along homeopathic lines. The state legislature approved a bill for the establishment of a state hospital in Middletown to use homeopathic therapy methods on April 28, 1870. The hospital opened in 1874 with 69 patients. Henry Reed Stiles became the second superintendent of the hospital in 1875 and introduced strict dietary regimens. From 1877 until 1902, Dr. Seldon H. Talcott was the superintendent and developed a series of occupational therapy for all patients at Middletown. His treatment included art exhibitions, an institutional newsletter written by the patients (The Conglomerate), and athletics. The number of buildings and the number of patients grew reaching over 100 buildings and 2,250 people in the early 1900s and 3,686 in the 1960s. In 1901, Ralph Albert Blakelock became a patient at the hospital where he continued painting his landscapes. The services shifted primarily to outpatient therapy and numbers decreased. The institution permanently closed in 2006.  Baseball therapy  Chesbro pitching for the New York Highlanders started his career playing for the Middletown Asylumsalt=A black-and-white picture of a man in a blue baseball uniform and a white hat winds up to throw a baseball While superintendent of the hospital, Seldon H. Talcott began using a range of physical activity as treatment for mental disorders. In 1888, they founded a team composed of patients, staff, and some of the best amateur baseball players in the region. The team began play in 1889 as the Asylums playing other teams in the region. By 1890, the team was playing regional teams from New York City and elsewhere winning 21 games out of 25. This included a split with the Cuban Giants, one of the top baseball teams at the time. In 1891, they narrowly lost a game with the New York Giants, who had finished 3rd in the National League that year, 4-3. In 1892, the team went undefeated except for two narrow losses to the New York Giants defeating the Cuban Giants, the New York Gothams, and many other teams from New York and New Jersey. Over the next few years, a number of excellent semi-pro players played for the Asylums. Many were recruited directly from the Asylums to professional baseball. With increased caseloads in the 1890s, the baseball focus of the Middletown hospital decreased and the Asylums withered away.

Later, A.C Ingham, a Drummoyne Alderman and Quarton Deloitte Sydney Rowing Club President and Mr W.A Hence of the NSW Rowing Association presided over a public meeting at the Drummoyne Town Hall on 28 August 1919 which was called for the purpose of forming a rowing club at Drummoyne. The Enterprise Rowing Club on the other side of the Iron Cove at Balmain had been destroyed by a fierce gale on 19 September 1917. A number of Enterprise Club members were Drummoyne residents and there was an interest in rebuilding across the river. Fred Cronin, Wally Kolts, Bill Witt Senior and Junior, George McKenzie, Lance Wearne & Norm Barrell were the Enterprise members instrumental in the DRC's foundation. The first committee was elected on 1 September 1919 with Ingham as President and Cronin as Secretary. The club chose to welcome women members from its inception. By 29 November 1919, three concrete piers, forming part of the foundation of the boat house, were placed in position in Sister's Bay on the Iron Cove. The building took two years to complete, work being done on Saturday afternoons and holidays only. The new boathouse was officially opened by Sir Walter Davidson on 24 September 1921. Mr A.C. Ingham owned a timber yard and supplied materials at cost as well as standing as guarantor for the club to its bank lender. The club's first boat purchase around that same time was a four-oared boat from George Towns & Sons. Much of the building work was done by volunteers and the clubhouse was finally completed in September 1921 and opened by the Governor Sir Walter Davidson. The club won the Junior Pennant in its first two years of existence and was runner-up in both pennants in its third year, all this notwithstanding the fact that the fleet consisted only of one racing eight and one regulation four. In March 1923, the NSW State Eight crew prepared for the Interstate Rowing Championships at the new boatshed. In 1966 a liquor license was obtained by which stage membership numbers had grown to 205 and a new licensed clubhouse was opened in 1968 with dining room extensions completed by 1975. A new boathouse was rebuilt in the mid 1980s. The licensed club ran into financial difficulties in the new millennium and ceased operation from 2010, although rowing continued. The rowing club and its members continue to compete in club, state and national regattas. Regattas The Drummoyne Regatta course on Iron Cove is a 1000m sprint course that starts off Leichhardt Park near the Leichhardt Rowing Club and finishes in Sister's Bay off the DRC boatshed. As of 2018 Drummoyne host a Rowers Regatta (consisting of around 40 events) in March of the Rowing NSW season and a Masters Regatta a month later consisting of around 50 masters events.RowingNSW 2018 calendar Along with the Glebe Rowing Club and the three other Iron Cove rowing clubs Drummoyne host one of the four week JB Sharp winter regattas over a short form 900m course.JB Sharp series Club presidents * A.C Ingham (1919) * Graham Wearne (1980s) * Kathleen Hextell (2014 - ) Club Captains * George Andrews (1995 - 2016) * Robert Glendenning (2016 -) Members Notable past members include: * Clyde Hefer two-time world champion in the lightweight coxless four and a 1984 Olympian. * Graham Gardiner was a Drummoyne rower when he won the first of this two world championships in the lightweight coxless four. * Graham Wearne was a national champion and represented at the 1979 World Championships.

Shirley, R.W. Fairbridge. Encyclopedia of Planetary Sciences, page 111. Identification The easiest way to correlate a meteorite with a parent body is when the parent body still exists. This is the case for Lunar and Martian meteorites. Samples from Lunar meteorites can be compared with samples from the Apollo program. Martian meteorites can be compared to analysis carried out by rovers (e.g. Curiosity). Meteorites can also be compared to spectral classes of asteroids. In order to identify the parent body of a class of meteorites, scientists compare their albedo and spectra with other known bodies. These studies show that some meteorite classes are closely related to some asteroids. The HED meteorites for example are correlated with 4 Vesta.Gunter Faure, Teresa M. Mensing.

Shaun West and J. Mark Crider began Proto with Erik Berkes in 2002. In the fall of 2003, the band began preparing for their first release to prelude the full-length album. Proto asked violinist Krista Wroten (schooled in classical music training at Boston University) if she was interested in playing on the CD to fill out some of the songs. What began only as an addition to the record became an addition to the band. It was obvious that Krista belonged after hearing her play. They quickly recruited lead guitarist Benjamin Mansfield and wrote their first song, \\"The Backwards Waltz\\". The song embodied a mutual frustration within the band towards ignorance and the destruction of the human mind. It was from this collaboration that the band realized their potential and agreed to pursue a serious career in music. The music immediately took precedence over everything else in their lives. Proto continued to write new material for their first full-length album, which was due out in 2004. After recording, the band left Memphis for Chattanooga.

It was his first major work, written in 1849 and published in the No.6 (March, book 2) 1850 Moskvityanin issue. Having caused a furore, it was banned by the Imperial Theatres' censorship committee and was staged for the first time on 9 December 1860, ten years after its publication. For some time the play has been also referred to as The Bankrupt, which was its original title. Background After his attempt to write a play called The Legal Request (–ò—Å–∫–æ–≤–æ–µ –ø—Ä–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ) failed Ostrovsky started working upon another storyline, again stemming from his experience in the Moscow commercial court. Uncertain in his own potential, he invited a friend, Tertiy Filippov, to become a co-author, but the latter refused. Then Dmitry Gorev (real surname Tarasenko) emerged, the son of a merchant who lived not far from the Ostrovskys' (and later turned bankrupt), who published a drama called Tzar the Liberator or the Poor Orphan in 1843. It was Gorev who suggested that they should work upon the play together. Several scenes of Act 1 finished, Gorev suddenly left Moscow and has not been seen there until 1853 when he re-emerged to accuse Ostrovsky of \\"stealing\\" the text he, Gorev, had been the co-author of. History Konstantin Rybakov (Bolshov) and Mikhail Sadovsky (Podkhalyuzin) in the 1892 production Ostrovsky was working on The Bankrupt all through 1847 and 1848. By the end of 1849 it has been finished. Ostrovsky's first audience was his University friend Alexey Pisemsky. He also met the now famous actor Prov Sadovsky who, much impressed, started to recite the play to his literary friends in Moscow. In the summer Ostrovsky read the play at Mikhail Katkov's in Merzlyakovsky Lane where another Moscow University professor, I.V.Belyaev was also present. Both Ostrovsky and Sadovsky started to receive invitations to the houses of Moscow cultural elite (Nikolai and Karolina Pavlovs, Alexander Veltman, professors Stepan Shevyryov and Mikhail Pogodin, at Meshchersky's and Sheremetyev's, even in the astronomer Alexander Drashusov's observatoryB.Drashusova's letter to Ostrovsky, the Bakhrushin Theatre Museum archives, file 200) where they became frequent guests since the autumn of 1849. Ivan Goncharov, who was in Moscow on his way from Saint Petersburg to Simbirsk, has heard the Bankrupt, liked it a lot and advised Ostrovsky to send the play to Krayevsky's Otechestvennye Zapiski. The author decided against it, still hoping to get the censorship permission first.Barsukov, N.P. The Life and works of M.P.Pogodin. Vol. 11, p. 68 In November 1849 Sadovsky read the play at the house of Countess Rostopchina who called it \\"our Russian Tartuffe\\" and expressed her delight with being the witness to \\"the birth of our own theatre literature.\\"The Lenin‚Äôs Library, fund 231, dpt. 2, 28/41. Rostopchina's opinion impressed Pogodin and he asked Nikolai Berg to invite Ostrovsky to his home. On December 3 Ostrovsky read the play to the audience which included Veltman, Lev Mei, the actor Shchepkin and, notably, Nikolai Gogol. The success was immense although at least one of the guests, Veltman, expressed his reservations, complaining about the duration of the event.Berg, I.V. Remembering N.V.Gogol. Russkaya Starina, 1872, No. 1, pp. 121-122D.Pogodin. From Memoirs. Countess Rostopchina and her Parties. Istoricheskye Vesti, 1892, No. 4, p. 52Berg, Nikolai. Countess Rostopchina in Moscow.

The play was published in the March (No. 6) issue of Moskvityanin under the new title It's a Family Affair-We'll Settle It Ourselves and made Ostrovsky famous in Moscow. \\"The Bankrupt caused furor in the city,\\" Moskvityanin editor-in-chief Mikhail Pogodin wrote in a diary on March 20, four days after the No.6 issue of the magazine came out. Governor Zakrevsky himself supported the play's theatrical production. Then the situation changed. The success of the play which satirized the uncultured, self-satisfied merchant class outraged some influential people and the reports \\"started to fly to Petersburg,\\" as the actor (and later Ostrovsky's publisher) Modest Pisarev attested. The Theatre and Literature censorial committee banned the play, condemning its negativism, pessimism and the lack of \\"positive examples,\\" even if admitting that it contained nothing that would abuse the censorial rules directly. Nikolai I, having signed this document, left upon it a hand-written enquiry: \\"Who is this Ostrovsky, the author of the Family Affair?\\" One of his aids Count Orlov forwarded this request to the 3rd Department's Moscow office and the city's secret police put the man who was still working in the court under surveillance. In a letter to the Minister of Education Ostrovsky admitted the play might have been flawed, but added: \\"Comedy, as far as my principles are concerned, is the best genre in terms of achieving high moral goals, I see it as the best way for me to reproduce real life and so I felt I had to write - either a comedy or nothing. I am convinced that God gives one talent to some purpose and this involves certain responsibilities... For the time will come when every one of us will have to answer this question: 'What have I done with the talent I've been given?'\\" Countess Rostopchina passed this text to Gogol. \\"I find his answer most sensible. God help him in his future work and let all doubts be dispelled as to the goodness of his intentions,\\" the later wrote back. Rather frightened by the official reaction, Ostrovsky visited Zakrevsky. \\"This only gives you more honour,\\" the Governor reassured the young author, meaning apparently that the Moscovites admired those of their intellectuals who fell out of favour with the authorities in Saint Petersburg. Very soon Ostrovsky discovered he was indeed becoming highly popular with the Moscow cultural elite. On 9 May 1850 he was invited to Gogol's birthday party. In 1860 Family Affair was finally declared eligible for the theatre production. The reason for the permission was two-fold: Ostrovsky agreed to make several changes and the general state of the Imperial Theatres' repertoire has been recognized in the report as quite deplorable. In the early 1861 the Family Affair was premiered in Saint Petersburg as Yulia Linskaya's benefice and enjoyed great success. Two weeks later it was staged by Maly Theatre in Moscow, with Prov Sadovsky (as Podkhalyuzin) using his skillful art of gesticulation to express without words some of the things the author had been forced to cut out. Both Ostrovsky and the troupe were given long ovation and several hundred people followed the dramatist and his friends to his house.

The art form would go on to be copied across Europe. Shadow plays S√©raphin was born in Longwy, near Luxembourg. The art of using shadows to form figures onto a screen can be traced back to 9th-century Indonesia and China. European travellers saw these \\"Ombres Chinoises\\" (Chinese shadows) and returned home with descriptions of their performance. S√©raphin introduced his version of the act at the back of a Versailles inn during the early 1770s. Though he started the show in humble beginnings they became such a success, including regular visits from the aristocracy, that S√©raphin would go on to perform at the Palace of Versailles in front of royalty. In 1784 S√©raphin moved to Paris, performing his shows at the newly opened Palais-Royal from 8 September 1784. During this time Marie Antoinette visited three of his plays. The performances would continue through the French Revolution. S√©raphin died in 1800 but his shows continued initially under the direction of his nephew until the theatre closed in 1870. S√©raphin had adapted the Ombres Chinoises and devised new methods to control the shadow-throwing puppets. Rather than use hidden performers moving the parts of the silhouetted puppets, S√©raphin developed the use of clockwork mechanisms to automate the show. He made a variety of devices and performed several different acts including \\"Le Chasse aux canards\\" (The Duck Hunt), \\"Le Magicien Rothomago\\" (Rothomago the Magician), and \\"L'Embarras du m√©nage\\" (The Embarrassment of the Household). Amongst S√©raphin's most popular works was Le Pont Cass√© (The Broken Bridge), a play based on a musical piece by Louis-Gabriel Guillemain. At the height of popularity the most famous of S√©raphin's shadow plays were reproduced so that children could perform them. Script details and paper versions of the characters were made in √âpinal, Nancy, and Augsburg. Children would stick the characters to cardboard and cut them out, performing their own versions of the stories in small toy theatres. S√©raphin is seen as the most important figure in the development of the art form. His work is believed to have been seen by Philip James de Loutherbourg, giving him inspiration for his mechanical work including the Eidophusikon. Techniques used to create the shadow plays were also replicated and combined with other emerging technologies, including magic lanterns, to form phantasmagoria shows. He died in Paris.

A premature baby lacks the ability to regulate its own body temperature. The Embrace Warmer uses a phase change material incorporated into a sleeping bag design to regulate the temperature of these babies, without the need for a constant supply of electricity. The device is being used in clinic and hospital settings around the world, with India as its primary market (India is home to 40% of the world's low-birth-weight and premature babies). Currently, Chen serves as chief executive officer (CEO) of Embrace Innovations, which has a mission to design and bring to market healthcare technologies for the developing world, starting with the infant warmer. The Embrace infant warmer costs about 1% of a traditional incubator, and is estimated to have helped over 300,000 babies to date. Chen served as the first CEO of Embrace, the non- profit arm of the organization, before stepping into the CEO role for Embrace Innovations, the for-profit social enterprise that was spun off in 2012. Early life and education Chen's early education was at Upland High School, in Upland, California. Chen holds a BA in Psychology and Economics from Pomona College, a Masters in Public Administration from Harvard University, and an MBA from Stanford University. Career Prior to Embrace, Chen worked with nonprofit organizations on healthcare issues in developing countries. She spent several years as the program director of a startup HIV/AIDS nonprofit in China (Chi Heng Foundation), and worked for the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs HIV/AIDS Initiative in Tanzania. She also worked at Monitor Group as a management consultant, advising Fortune 500 companies. Chen has been a TED speaker, and was selected as one of Forbes' Impact 30 in 2011. In 2019, Chen was featured in AOL/Verizon/Yahoo's \\"FUTURIST\\" Series, profiling industry leaders across all different disciplines who are advancing their fields with technology, innovation, and fearlessness. Chen has been recognized as the Inspirational Young Alumni of the Year by Pomona College, and selected as a \\"Woman of Distinction\\" by the American Association of University Women. Chen has spoken at numerous international conferences, including the Skoll World Forum, Bloomberg Design Conference, Forbes Women's Summit, and the World Economic Forum. In 2012, Chen was named as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum, and was featured in Dove's \\"Real Role Models\\" campaign for women and girls. She was also profiled in AOL's Makers campaign. Chen is a TED Fellow, Echoing Green Fellow, and Rainer Arnhold Fellow. In 2013, Chen and the other co-founders of Embrace, Linus Liang, Nag Murty, and Rahul Panicker were awarded the prestigious Economist Innovation Award, under the category of Social and Economic Innovation. In the same year, Chen and her co-founder Rahul Panicker were also recognized as Schwab Social Entrepreneurs of the Year by the World Economic Forum. In 2014, Chen was invited to the White House's first ever Maker Faire, where she presented Embrace's work to President Obama. In the same year, Beyonc√© made a $125,000 contribution through Chime for Change which allowed Embrace to distribute its infant warmers to nine countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. =Embrace= While doing her MBA at Stanford, Chen and a few other fellow graduate students were assigned a class project to create a low-cost infant incubator that could be used in rural areas. In 2008, they co-founded Embrace, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, to bring their project to life. In January 2012, Embrace moved into a hybrid structure. The non-profit entity, Embrace, donates infant warmers to the neediest areas through NGO partners, and provides educational programs on newborn health alongside the distribution of warmers. The for-profit social enterprise, Embrace Innovations, sells the warmers to paying entities, including governments and private clinics, all focusing on emerging markets. Embrace believes that this type of \\"hybrid\\" structure allows it to most effectively achieve its mission: to supply its infant warmers to every baby in need. Embrace Innovations, the for-profit social enterprise, raised its Series A round of financing in 2012 from Vinod Khosla's Impact Fund and Capricorn Investment Group. The company raised a second round of investment capital from Marc Benioff in 2014. In 2016, Embrace Innovations launched a line of consumer baby products called Little Lotus Baby (temperature regulating swaddles and sleeping bags), which have a buy-one give-one model; each product sold helps to save a baby in a developing country with the Embrace warmer. The Little Lotus products leverage the technology used in the Embrace warmer to keep babies at an ideal skin temperature, thereby helping to improve their sleep.  Personal life  Chen's personal hobbies include meditation, yoga and surfing. She writes a blog called Hanging Zen, and a column for Forbes about the life and startup lessons she learned through surfing.

During his time in office he was involved in the investigation and prosecution of the 1982 Lake Waco murders and also several crimes to which Henry Lee Lucas had been linked. Feazell currently resides in Waco, Texas, and is an attorney with his own firm. He is known for his commercials sporting the \\"Drive Laid Back\\" slogan. Early life Feazell was raised in Texas. At 17 years old, he took the civil service exam and was hired by the Austin Police Department. In the early 1970s, Feazell graduated from University of Mary Hardin Baylor and attended Baylor Law School, receiving his J.D. in May 1979. Ten days after graduation from law school, Feazell tried his first jury trial, alone, and won it. Career Feazell announced his candidacy for District Attorney of McLennan County in Waco, Texas in 1982. He would go on to win the election against the incumbent district attorney and became one of the youngest to hold the position in McLennan County. During his first term as District Attorney, Feazell tried the 1982 Lake Waco Triple Murders. In 1984, a jury found David Wayne Spence guilty of the murders and sentenced him to the death penalty. A chronicle of the Lake Waco Murders can be found in the Edgar Award-winning book Careless Whispers by Carlton Stowers. Feazell notes on his website that he is \\"now a vocal advocate against the death penalty.\\" In 1984, after Henry Lee Lucas claimed to have killed over 300 people across the country, the Texas Rangers announced numerous murders to have been solved. Three of these announced murders were in McLennan County. An investigation by the Dallas Times-Herald, published in 1985, cast doubt on the validity of Lucas's confession spree, but the Rangers stood by the confessions as legitimate and their claims that Lucas was a mass- murderer. This prompted Feazell to begin investigating the claims, and eventually publish the Lucas Report. The report suggested that Lucas could not have committed some of the murders to which he had confessed, including the ones in McLennan County. The Texas Rangers were unhappy with Feazall's defiance and casting doubt on them. The Texas Department of Public Safety began an investigation of Feazal which several sources have tied to retaliation against Feazall; Feazall was arrested, and his office and home searched by agents.Texas Monthly Feb 1994 The Twilight of the Texas Rangers Feazell's arrest came seven weeks before election day. Voters in McLennan County re-elected Feazell for another term. During the criminal investigation leading up to Feazell's indictment, a reporter from Dallas television station WFAA-TV named Charles Duncan ran an eleven-part series about Feazell, which later led to a libel judgement in favor of Feazell worth $58 million. This series was the only evidence shown to the federal grand jury that indicted Feazell. Feazell was found not guilty of all charges on June 29, 1987. Feazell then returned to work as District Attorney of McLennan County. On September 13, 1988, Feazell sent out a press release stating he would be resigning as District Attorney. Feazell then began representing Lucas in all of the still- pending murder cases he had confessed to around the country. Feazell spent much of the 1990s representing Lucas to ensure he was not convicted based on any more false confessions. The work done by Feazell and others cast enough doubt on the validity of the Lucas confession to the Orange Socks murder case that in 1998 then-Governor George W. Bush commuted Lucas's death penalty to life imprisonment. In 1991, represented by former U.S. Attorney Gary Richardson, Feazell was awarded a $58 million judgment for libel charges against WFAA-TV, at the time the largest libel judgment in U.S. history. As a result, he was cited in the 1993 edition of Guinness World Records for largest defamation lawsuit in history. In the 21st century, Feazell formed his own law office, The Law Offices of Vic Feazell with offices presently in Austin and Waco, Texas. The offices work primarily with personal injury cases and occasionally criminal cases.

A water stream stemming from it flows through a horizontal passage to form a waterfall, judging by noises from the depths. There are many metal buckets and pitchers floating in the lake, suggesting that cave water had been used by locals for many years. History and culture Khvamli is located in the western portion of the historical Georgian province of Lechkhumi. The name of Khvamli stems for an old Georgian word for a constellation and the rock, according to the 18th-century scholar Prince Vakhushti, was named so because of its height.

The two Davids divided the lands and vassal nobles, but from the Khomli treasure only certain articles were taken, of which the share falling to David VI was \\"the famous chain of diamonds, the superb jewel cut in the form of an anvil and a great pearl, of which the like was never seen\\". Much of the treasure, the chronicle states, remained hidden in the caves. The 19th-century French historian Marie-F√©licit√© Brosset reports that excavations made at Khvamli by Prince Dadiani in the 1840s yielded no result. Khvamli also housed a church of St. George probably built in the 12th or 13th century, of which only ruins remain. Digs in 1910 revealed a medieval Georgian stone inscription recording the name of the church's donor, Ioane, eristavi (\\"duke\\") of the Svans. Takaichvili, E.

Of a series of legends, the one identifying Khvamli as the site of punishment of Prometheus, or his local counterpart, Amirani, feature in some 19th-century European travel accounts and even found its way in Jules Verne's K√©raban the Inflexible, which mentions \\"the rock of Khomli, overlooking Koutais, to which Prometheus was bound, and where the vultures eternally feed upon his entrails as a punishment for having stolen the bolts of heaven\\".Verne, Jules (1885), \\"K√©raban the Inflexible: Or, Adventures in the Euxine\\", p. 638, in: Routledge's Every Boy's Annual, Vol. 26.

It exports to more than 100 countries, and was awarded The Queen's Award for Enterprise for International Trade in 2017.  History  = 1983-2000: Founding of Nisbets = Nisbets was founded by Andrew Nisbet in 1983. It started out selling knives, catering clothing and textbooks to catering colleges, building on the business of Nisbet‚Äôs father, Peter Nisbet, which provided catering kits to colleges in South West England. In 1987, the company launched its first mail-order catalogue, selling products to students and trade customers. Catering Insight called the mail order catalogue the \\"bedrock of the company‚Äù. Nisbets acquired catering wholesaler Red Ball in 1990, which was rebranded as RB Distributors, and enabled the company to start wholesaling to shops and other retailers for the first time. By 1995, the company stocked 8,000 products for next-day delivery. The business opened its first non-UK office in 1996 in Cork, Republic of Ireland. = 2000-2010: International expansion in Europe = In 2000, Nisbets opened an office in the Netherlands, the company's first physical presence outside of the British Isles. The new office was responsible for mail-order sales of Nisbet products in Holland and Belgium. Nisbets opened further offices in France in 2005 and Spain in 2007. The company also opened dedicated offices in Germany, Belgium and Portugal. Due to growing demand, the company relocated to new larger premises in Avonmouth, Bristol, in 2004, and subsequently moved to a larger 165,000 sq. ft. unit in 2008. In 2010, Nisbets acquired Pages, a catering retail outlet on Shaftesbury Avenue, London. The site was the company's first retail shop, and the company said they viewed high-street retail as the \\"perfect opportunity to attract serious home cooks as well as catering to trade customers.\\" = 2010-2017: High street growth and Australia expansion = In 2010, Nisbets acquired established Australian catering retailer Caterers Warehouse, which already operated retail sites in Erina, New South Wales and Castle Hill, New South Wales. Further retail stores were opened across the country in New South Wales, Victoria, Australian Capital Territory and Queensland over the next 7 years. As of December 2017, Nisbets has 12 retail outlets in Australia. Nisbets opened a new distribution centre in Campbelltown, New South Wales in 2015 to support growth of the business. Between 2010 and 2017, Nisbets opened 29 physical stores across the UK, focusing on major cities and towns, including Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast. As a result of growth, Nisbets was listed in The Sunday Times Top Track 250. In 2017, the company was listed as the 58th fastest growing company in the UK.

He was successively provost of Titel around 1127, bishop of P√©cs between around 1136 and around 1139, and finally archbishop of Esztergom until around 1147. Life Macarius is first mentioned in a fragmentary charter he issued as royal notary in the reign of King Stephen II of Hungary. The charter is dated to the period between 1125 and 1128, and refers to him as the head or provost of the collegiate chapter at Titel (now in Serbia). Macarius is first mentioned as bishop (but without any reference to his see) at the beginning of 1137. This year he participated at the assembly where Ladislaus, a younger son of King B√©la II of Hungary was proclaimed Duke of Bosnia. In the list of the participants, Macarius is only preceded by the archbishop of Esztergom. His see at P√©cs is revealed in a charter issued for the D√∂m√∂s Chapter by King B√©la II on September 3, 1138. Another charter, which donated villages to the monastery of Csat√°r, erected by Martin Gutkeled, isp√°n of Zala County, also refers to Macarius as bishop, but without mentioning his see. The charter is dated to the period between 1138 and 1141, the last years of B√©la II. Macarius seems to have been transferred to the see of Esztergom in some years, because three charters issued between 1142 and 1146 refer to one \\"Archbishop Macarius\\". As Jesuit scholar Istv√°n Katona considered at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, it is presumable that Macarius is identical with that certain Archbishop \\"Muchia\\", who appears without giving the specific archdiocese in a document in May 1142, when the privileges of Split were confirmed by the royal court in the name of the minor King G√©za II of Hungary. However historian Tam√°s K√∂rmendi emphasizes the paleographic difficulties between the two name forms, while the authenticity of the charter itself is also doubtful. N√°ndor Knauz, Imre Szentp√©tery, L√°szl√≥ Koszta, Attila Zsoldos and ‚Äì after philological and canon law considerations ‚Äì Tam√°s K√∂rmendi accepted Katona's claim, while J√≥zsef Udvardy identified \\"Muchia\\" as a previously unknown Archbishop of Kalocsa. He is still referred to as archbishop by two charters in 1146. Macarius appeared as a witness both times on the occasion of the last testaments of lady Sz√≠nes or Scines (the first preserved such document made by a woman in Hungary) and hospes Fulco, who served different prelates for decades as a secular clergyman. Macarius' name also appears in an undated royal charter, when G√©za II returned the privilege of the imposition of duty near Gy≈ër to the Pannonhalma Archabbey. According to the obituary of the G√∂ttweig Abbey, Macarius died on 25 January, without mentioning the proper year. As Fulco's last testament (where the archbishop was involved) took place after 16 February 1146, Macarius passed away sometimes from 25 January 1147 at the earliest to the same day in 1150 at the latest, as K√∂k√©nyes already functioned as archbishop in that year.

The first of his English translators guessed that De Barbastre referred to Walter being a barber. Geoffrey's second translator thought de Barbastre was a reference somehow to Walter's cousin, William the Conqueror, being a bastard. In fact, 'Walter de Barbastre' was an honorific gained at the successful siege of Barbastro in Aragon, near Saragossa.

By the time of the Conquest, Walter had returned to Normandy bearing a gift of the King of Spain for Duke William, a magnificent war-horse. The same Spanish war-horse duke William called for on the morning of the Battle of Hastings. The Spanish king in question was in all probability Sancho Ram√≠rez of Aragon (1063‚Äì94) who was known for making friends and recruiting knights and soldiers from Northern France.D.W.

In early January 1066, after Duke William received news of the crowning of Harold Godwinson as king of England, he called together a meeting, the Council of Lillebonne, that included six of his key magnates, Walter Giffard being one of them.Elisabeth M.C. van Houts, 'The Ship List of William the Conqueror', Anglo-Norman Studies X; Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1987, Ed.

Overview The Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center, located near the tribe's Foxwoods Resort Casino, opened August 11, 1998. The facility was built at a cost of $193.4 million, largely funded by casino revenues. It includes a museum and resources for scholarly research on the histories and cultures of the native peoples of the United States and Canada. Museum exhibits The museum's permanent collection includes artifacts of Native American peoples of eastern North America from the 16th century to the 20th century, as well as commissioned art works and traditional crafts by modern Native Americans. A series of interactive exhibits and life-size three-dimensional dioramas depicts the lifeways and history of the Mashantucket Pequot and their ancestors from the last glacial period through modern times. One highlight is a walk-through re-creation of a coastal Pequot village around the year 1550, shortly before the first contact with Europeans. The village is populated by 51 life-size figures of Indians engaged in activities such as building wigwams, sharpening arrows, and weaving mats. A photomural of an oak-hickory forest surrounds the village. A observation tower allows visitors to view the Mashantucket Pequot reservation, the casino, and surrounding areas of southeastern Connecticut. The museum reports having about 250,000 visitors each year. A reviewer for Connecticut Magazine described the museum as \\"rival[ing] anything in the nation\\" and commented that the Pequot village reconstruction and other dioramas \\"almost put EPCOT to shame\\". Facility The glass and steel building complex that houses the museum and research center was designed by New York City architects Polshek and Partners. The building design is intended to blend and merge with the surrounding natural landscape. A circular building, the Gathering Space, forms the focal center of the complex and serves as its main entry. Elements of the design are based on the plan of the Pequot fort at Mystic, Connecticut, that played an important role in the tribe's history. The complex received several awards for design and construction, including: * American Architecture Award, Chicago Athenaeum, 1998 * Best of 1998 Award, New York Construction News * Merit Award, American Institute of Architects (AIA) New York state, 1999 * Merit Award, AIA New England Regional Design Awards Program, 1999 * Innovative Design and Excellence in Architecture with Steel Award, AIA and American Institute of Steel Construction, 1999 * Honor Award, AIA Connecticut, 2000 * AIA National Award for Architecture, 2000 * New York Association of Consulting Engineers Platinum Award for Excellence in Structural Design, 2000 * Merit Winner, Engineering Awards of Excellence, 2000 In 2006, the museum building's green roof, which covers , was recognized with a Green Roof Award of Excellence.

The title refers to Berlin's subway line U1. The musical was first performed by the ensemble of the GRIPS-Theater on 30 April 1986. In October 2017, the troupe put on its 1,800th performance. The music was written by , the text written by , the set designed by , and the musical directed by . In 1988, a was made, and in 2008, GRIPS released a live recording on DVD.  Production  = Synopsis = The story follows a young woman who runs away from her provincial hometown and ends up at Berlin‚Äôs notorious Zoo station, searching for a rock musician who got her pregnant on a one-night stand. She gets stuck in underground line 1 and encounters a kaleidoscope of urban characters and their fates. According to the GRIPS, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a show, a drama, a musical about living and surviving in a large city, hope and adaptation, courage and self-deceit, to laugh and cry at, to dream, and to think about oneself.‚Äù As its other plays, Linie 1 includes sociocritical elements, but it also serves as an amusing portrait of Berlin's society before the fall of the Berlin Wall. = Development = In 1985, Volker Ludwig wrote the musical Line 1 (Linie 1). The title refers to Berlin's subway line U1. The music was written by German musician and composer Birger Heymann, a longtime friend of Ludwig, and the rock band No Ticket (Thomas Keller, George Kranz, Axel Kottmann, Michael Brandt, Richard Wester, Matthias Witting). The musical premiered on 30 April 1986 and became the biggest success of the GRIPS- Theatre. The success of Linie 1 also had its drawbacks. Due to the production's considerable costs, ticket sales no longer covered the theatre's expenses. However, after Volker Ludwig mentioned on a talk show that the theatre would have to close without additional support, the government eventually increased its subsidies. Initially, Germany's main stages ignored Linie 1, but when the Stuttgart State Theatre successfully ran the musical, other theatres followed suit. Linie 1 became known nationwide after several of its songs were performed on satirical TV show Scheibenwischer (windshield wipers). The show's creator, German satirist, actor and author Dieter Hildebrandt, later had a cameo appearance in the 1988 film version of the musical. For years, Linie 1 was the most-played German production and it remains the second-most successful musical after Bertolt Brecht‚Äôs Threepenny Opera. In 1987, the musical‚Äôs author Volker Ludwig was awarded the M√ºlheimer Dramatikerpreis (English: dramatist award of M√ºlheim), considered Germany‚Äôs leading theatre award. = International performances and adaptations = To this day, the musical has been performed at over 150 German-language theatres and adapted by theatres in 15 countries, including Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Italy, India, Lithuania, Namibia, the Netherlands, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and Yemen. In Barcelona (‚ÄúLinea Roja‚Äú), Hong Kong (‚ÄúIsland Line‚Äú), Kolkata (‚ÄúChord Line‚Äú), Seoul (‚ÄúSeoul Linie 1‚Äú), Vilnius (‚ÄúRule No. 1: It is forbidden to dream of Vilnius‚Äù), Windhoek (‚ÄúFriends 4Eva‚Äú) and Aden (‚ÄúMak Nazl‚Äú), the original play was adapted to the respective cities and retained the original music (except in Hong Kong). In , a young Chinese Korean woman from Yanbian comes to Seoul, traveling back and forth between the Seoul Station and the Cheongnyangni 588 red light district. The Nazi widows of the original play become widows of former military big shots. This Korean version, adapted by Kim Min-ki, became even more successful than the original in Berlin. While the GRIPS put on its 1,800th performance of Linie 1 in October 2017, Seoul Line 1 was performed over 4,000 times during the 13 years the musical belonged to the Hakchon Theatre's repertoire. Since September 8, 2018, Hakchon Theatre is staging a new version of the musical. In the Namibian version, a German girl arrives in Windhoek searching for a Namibian musician she met while he was playing in Germany. She travels all over Namibia with various typical means of transport, such as minibus taxis and a donkey cart. The Wilmersdorf widows in this version are widows of former Boers still dreaming of white supremacy in Africa.

It was premiered in the Maly Theatre on January 14, 1853. History By 1852 all of Ostrovsky's work, including a translation, has been banned from being produced on stage. Years later he wrote: \\"The author, especially the one who is just starting, who's got one or two plays banned without an explanation, becomes a slave to his own fear‚Ä¶ Once he comes across a long idea, he tends to shorten it; once he creates a strong character, he weakens it, once he hits upon a fiery, powerful phrase, he dulls it for in all of this he now starts to see the possible reasons for future prohibitions.\\" His new play was the result of such a compromise: it was a melodrama, less daring than the Family Affair and not as ambitious as The Poor Bride, with many sharp edges dulled. The main character, Rusakov, was the portrayal of a real person, merchant Kosheverov, actor Prov Sadovsky's relative who delighted Ostrovsky with his openness and easy ways with money. The play, originally called One's Got to Guess When Good Thing's Good (Ot dobra dobra ne ishchut), has been in the works all through 1852. On October 6 that year Mikhail Pogodin mentioned in his diary that he'd heard the play as read by its author. On November 19 Ostrovsky informed Pogodin that the text had been sent to the censors.Ostrovsky‚Äôs letter to M.Pogodin, November 19, 1852, The Lenin's Library collection, 1939, IV, p.16 Ostrovsky staged the play for the first time himself in the house of his friend Nikolai Panov (the one who first started to collect Ostrovsky's manuscripts, the work which later Nikolai Shapovalo took upon himself). Podkhalyuzin was played by the author himself and, reportedly, with this performance he made even Prov Sadovsky laugh. Another amateur performance of such kind has been staged in Pavlovsky Posad, at the factory owned by Prince Yakov Gruzinsky, a man whose son, actor Ivan Nikulin, was a husband of actress Lyubov Nikulina-Kositskaya. Pogodin assisted with the promotion by approaching his old acquaintance Stepan Gedeonov (who later succeeded his father as the Director of the Imperial Theatres). Once the censorial permission has been received, in January 1853 Verstovsky assigned it to Lyubov Kositskaya's benefice. The latter had an influential detractor in Countess Rostopchina who hated Kositskaya's simple ways and described her as \\"the turnip-like creature, with a head looking like an ill-formed water-melon, or cabbage... And what a vile, sloven diction!\\" All of this, though, as biographer Lakshin noted, was part of the reason why the actress was so admired by the theatre-going Moscovites. =Productions= The play was premiered at the Moscow's Maly Theatre on January 14, 1853 and had great success, praised even by Ostrovsky's detractors like Vasily Botkin. The second and the third performances were even better, with both Kositskaya and Sadovsky (as Rusakov) excelling. This, according to Lakshin, was the birth of what later would be termed as \\"the Ostrovsky's theater,\\" the \\"true union of the drama and the artists.\\" Later that season the play has been shown 12 times in the Bolshoy Theatre, which marked Ostrovsky's debut there.–ê. –ù. –û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –∏ –ú–∞–ª—ã–π —Ç–µ–∞—Ç—Ä / A.N. Ostrovsky and the Maly Theatre In the early February 1853 Ostrovsky went to Saint Petersburg for the first time. There he was received by the director of the Imperial Theatres Alexander Gedeonov and became friends with actor Fyodor Burdin who helped with getting the permission for another of Ostrovsky's plays, The Young Man's Morning to be produced in the capital; it was premiered on February 12, 1853 in the Circus Theatre. On February 19 Stay in Your Own Sled premiered in Alexandrinsky Theatre. Again it was a success although the actors' work was less inspired and more formulaic than that of their Moscow colleagues. Ostrovsky had to leave the capital before the play's premiere after having received the news of his father's dying. One of the shows in Alexandrinka was attended by Tsar Nikolai I himself who appeared to be greatly impressed, having construed the play's message to be that \\"children should follow their parents' advice, otherwise, everything gets ruined.\\" Addressing Gedeonov and his own entourage, he pronounced: \\"There's been not many plays which would have given me such pleasure,\\" and added in French: \\"–°–µ n'est phis une piece, c'est une lecon.\\" Next evening he brought his whole family to the theatre. In March 1853 the play was published in the March (No.5) issue of Moskvityanin and later that year came out as a separate edition. Several years later Nikolai Dobrolyubov wrote in \\"The Realm of Darkness\\" essay: \\"The main idea of the play is that samodurstvo [petty domestic tyranny], no matter how meek or even tender forms it might take, still greatly damages the person subjected to it, leading to the loss of the latter's individuality. Such de-individualisation destroys both the consciousness and the reason, so that the subject of samodurstvo might unwillingly commit any kind of crime, and thus perish simply due to the lack of reason and character.\\" References Category:1853 plays Category:Plays by Alexander Ostrovsky ","title":"Stay in Your Own Sled"},{"id":"36711969","text":"Doric Park is located in Old Swan, Liverpool, England.

Biography Bosch was born in Barcelona and educated at the school of the Convent de la Merc√® in Barcelona, where he began his studies in piano and guitar.Philip James Bone: The Guitar and Mandolin: Biographies of Celebrated Players and Composers for these Instruments (1914): \\"Bosch, Jaime Felipe Jos√©, born 1826 at Barcelona, died March 30, 1895, at 23 rue de la Damas, Paris. He studied singing and the guitar when young and was later attracted to Paris where he became popular as a teacher of the guitar.\\" Before he emigrated, Bosch gave successful concerts in Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia between 1849 and 1852. From 1853 he settled in Paris and from 1857 toured frequently in France, the Netherlands and Germany. Bosch was a very good friend of the painter √âdouard Manet and posed for him many times, one portrait being used as illustration for one of Bosch's publications, Plainte Moresque op. 85, which is also dedicated to Manet. Besides many original compositions he wrote a M√©thode de guitare (1891, see below) and an opera (Roger de Flor, 1868), which was not performed. In Paris, Bosch was much praised at the aristocratic salons and had a large number of pupils, including the brothers Alfred and Jules Cottin.Le Figaro, 26 April 1892, p. 3. His best-known piece was to be his song collection Dix M√©lodies, which was praised by Felipe Pedrell as a \\"true model of what a composer's inspiration may create in this genre\\".Paraphrased from CD booklet notes to LMG 2119; see Recordings. Bosch died in the 17th arrondissement of Paris. Most of Bosch's guitar works were not published at the time they were written but in collections of Dix Pi√®ces (ten pieces) in 1887 and 1894, 12 Pi√®ces faciles (12 easy pieces) in 1892 and a further six easy pieces in 1894. A later edition of ten easy pieces (1923) reprints some previously published pieces together with seven pieces that had apparently not previously been published. Bosch's M√©thode de guitare is very much a composer's method insofar as it contains numerous original compositions of varying length and difficulty. In the course of its 116 pages there are 16 Le√ßons (distributed over pages 3‚Äì14), 31 Exercises (pages 22‚Äì92) and 39 original compositions, ranging in length from one to five pages. Most of them are dedicated to one of his pupils, who included Guy de Polignac, member of a famous French noble family. Among the more substantial works there are two movements of a Sonata dialogue, dedicated to the memory of Fernando Sor (an Adagio on pp. 63‚Äì4, and an Allegro on pp. 102‚Äì4), a Jota (pp. 69‚Äì72), and Iberia (subtitled Valse de concert), pp. 110‚Äì4 (see below for full listing).

He was the co- founder of Carr√© Noir, the very first French design marketing agency, making him one of the inventors of the concept of brand design in France. He also contributed to the development of French design marketing overseas, in Japan Magazine max, avril 1994 : \\"G√©rard Caron, l'homme qui emballe les Japonais\\", magazine Cosm√©tica, juin 1993 :\\"Japon, l'empire packaging\\" as well as in other countries around the world. G√©rard Caron, who is the author of several books on design as a professional activity,Voir paragraphe \\"Publications\\" and the creator of a website dedicated to design, regularly gives lectures on this topic.Voir paragraphe \\"Quelques conf√©rences\\" Early life and education G√©rard Caron was born in Pont l'Ev√™que, Normandy, France, into a family of seven children, just before the outbreak of the Second World War. Nothing in his family background (his father was a telephone inspector and his mother a seamstress) seemed to destine him for a career in design. In the long periods of shortages brought about by the war, G√©rard Caron invented games, made products using flour, potatoes, sugar, water, or cider as his basic ingredients, created makeshift packaging and dreamt up advertising slogans and sold them to his brothers and sisters. Without realizing it, he had started creating his first packaging materials and logos. G√©rard Caron was twenty when war was declared in Algeria. For twenty-eight months, he did his military service in the Engineers where he happened to read an article about jobs in advertising. It came as a revelation. With his heart set on working in this industry, he decided to take correspondence courses. When he was demobilized, he continued studying at the Ecole Sup√©rieure de la Communication in Paris from which he graduated top of his class. To pay for his studies, he worked simultaneously in a bank. Later on, he would also study distribution, graphology, and psychology. Career Caron began his long life in advertising with Publicis in 1962, where he acquired his first professional experience. He developed his career working successively for SNIP (which subsequently became BDDP), Young & Rubicam, and Ted Bates. He spent considerable time in companies such as Brandt and Cotelle Lesieur, where he worked on the celebrated plastic Lacroix bleach bottle in 1964 with Raymond Loewy. This was his first professional contact with design and was to have an immense influence on his subsequent career. Later on, G√©rard Caron studied and developed theories about design based on handwriting, heraldry, symbolism, and relaxation therapy with his partner Michel Disle. In 1973, he founded Carr√© Noir, la premi√®re agence de design-marketing en France, the first design marketing agency to be set up in France, with three professionals from the Ted Bates agency: the architect Michel Alizard, the artistic director Michel Disle, and the designer Jean Perret. The square of the logo symbolizes the friendship of the four partners and the black color represents the pencil stroke of the creative designer on the sheet of white paper. They decided to call their new business a \\"design agency\\". At that time, the word ‚Äòdesign‚Äô conjured up images of Scandinavian furniture and had not yet become part of the advertising lexicon. G√©rard Caron and his associates are considered to be the inventors of communication design in France. G√©rard Caron went on to set up subsidiaries of Carr√© Noir around the world, in the United States, Japan, Italy, Belgium and England. He also prepared the launch of the agency in Germany, Poland and Hong Kong before leaving the business in 1998. In all, G√©rard Caron has created nearly 13,000 packaging designs with his teams (for brands such as Carrefour, Biotherm, Lanc√¥me, etc.), 1,200 visual identities (including logos for Lotus, Le Bon March√© or the RPR political party and the emblem used by former French president Fran√ßois Mitterrand) and 90 new chain store concepts (for Yves Rocher, Loisirs & Cr√©ation or Auchan). The career pursued by Caron and his extensive research on symbolic systems, colours, and the memorization of signs led him to work with artists, scientists, psychiatrists, business leaders, and politicians and to write a large number of books in which he develops his thoughts about design. In 2003, he founded and became editor of Admirable Design, a weekly online magazine devoted to news about design and related markets. Today, G√©rard Caron shares his knowledge and expertise in France and around the world as a consultant for design agencies and business organizations, and gives many lectures in Japan and throughout Europe. =Key dates= 1973: Creation of the first design marketing agency in France: Carr√© Noir. He served as the agency‚Äôs Chairman until 1998. 1990: G√©rard Caron founded the Enseigne d‚ÄôOr with Alain Boutigny, an annual award presented to architects and advertisers/distributors for their achievements and innovations.

Scopes uses images to study worldwide consumption trends through a network based in eight major cities worldwide: Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, Berlin, London, Milan, Paris, and Sydney. The company is composed chiefly of photographers, designers and journalists. 2002: G√©rard Caron became a columnist contributing to the Eco matin programme, broadcast on France 5. 2003: He founded Admirable Design, an online magazine dedicated to design in all its forms. Aimed at both professionals and students, it is currently the professional design website attracting the largest number of visitors. 2004: G√©rard Caron created Design Communication Corporation, a consultancy specializing in design and brand strategy. He also launched Caron Design Network, a professional network set up between the Japanese market and French design agencies. 2007: G√©rard Caron was appointed Chairman of the Pentawards jury, the international prize for packaging design founded by Brigitte and Jean-Jacques Evrard. He will henceforth serve as the chairman of the jury every year.

The company since changed its name to Classic Planes GmbH . The design, first flown in 1991, is an 80% scale replica of the Second World War Messerschmitt Bf 109 and is supplied as a kit for amateur construction or as a complete ready-to-fly- aircraft.Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12, pages 68 and 115.

Design and development The aircraft was designed to comply with the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale microlight rules. It features a cantilever low- wing, a single-seat enclosed cockpit, retractable conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. The first replica was inspired by Bek's inspection of a Loehle 5151 Mustang scale replica fighter at AirVenture in the late 1980s. He was impressed with the scale warbird, but wanted a German aircraft and so returned home and set out to design an Me 109 replica. The first prototype, registered D-MBAK, was of all wooden construction, powered by a Hirth 2704 producing only and first flew in 1991. This aircraft achieved on its low power output, but Bek started a second prototype based on lessons learned in 1992. The second aircraft, registered D-MYBB, first flew in 1992, but was lost in an accident that same year. Bek's third prototype, D-MNBP, was flown in about 1994 and resulted in some kits being sold. Bek flew a homebuilt category version of the Me 109 in 1996, powered by a Hirth F30 and later a Subaru automotive conversion, which became the prototype of the Me 109R kit aircraft. Bek then sold the company and the new owner ceased development of the Me 109. In 2003 Christian Engelen purchased the project and continued work on the aircraft, officially re- launching it in 2004. Since then production has continued on a demand basis. The current production version, the Me 109R is made from composites. Its span wing has an area of and flaps. Standard engines available include the Rotax 582 two-stroke, the Weber Motor MPE 750 and the D-Motor LF26 four-stroke powerplants.

The band were an important part of the local Kent punk scene in the late 1970s in Kent alongside bands like Wild Billy Childish's Pop Rivets, The Names, Naughty Thoughts and The Rivals. All of the band went to Queen Elizabeth's School in Faversham. The band were managed by a third Harris brother, Phil, who was quick to recruit Ben Challis from another local punk band, The Plague, when Kevin Holmes dropped out as lead singer just before the band's first gig in Whitstable. In its final and most successful lineup (as the Ignerents), the band was a fourpiece consisting of Ben Challis (vocals), Steve Harris (guitar), Chris Harris (base) and Stan Gretsch (drums). The band released one single in 1979 (Radio Interference b/w Wrong Place Wrong Time). The Ignerents also featured on the First Offenders compilation album in 1980 with two tracks, Harbour Street and I Won't Be There. Wrong Place Wrong Time also featured on the German Punk series 'Back To Front'. The band finally evolved into a new band, The Beekeepers, which featured Nick Appleton on guitar alongside Steve and with Chris, Ben and Stan, and then finally with Russel Lax on drums (who, in the then small Kent new wave music scene had, I think, been the Pop Rivets' drummer and ended up as the drummer with local folk heroes the Oysterband!). The Beekeepers released one single, Platform 5 b/w The Trouble With You in 1981. On the live circuit the Ignerents were active from 1977-1981 with numerous gigs that included the Marquee Club and the Vortex in London and support slots with bands like 999, The Only Ones, Wayne County & The Electric Chairs and Chelsea. The band's history has been marred by the deaths of Stan, by now drummer with the Rivals, in a road accident in 1981; and Chris, who died in a drowning accident in 1984 whilst on holiday. The band released the Beekeepers single to celebrate Stan's life and played a final tribute gig to celebrate Chris's life at the Tankerton Arms in Whitstable in 1994 and in 1997 released a CD (Woodbines, Tears and Jealousy) which featured all of the Ignerents' previously released tracks and another ten archive tracks. Various tracks also feature on other compilation albums (see the Discography) including Wrong Place Wrong Time on Back To Front Vol 4 and Call me Irresponsible on Punks, Skins & Rude Boys III.

The four-hour medical thriller was originally broadcast on A&E; on September 3‚Äì4, 2012. The series was directed by Mikael Salomon and produced by Ridley Scott and his brother Tony Scott, the same team that adapted The Andromeda Strain into the 2008 miniseries on A&E.; The film is dedicated to Tony Scott, who died in August 2012, only weeks before its broadcast premiere. Plot Susan Wheeler (Lauren Ambrose) is a medical student starting her first year of training at the Peach Tree Memorial Hospital, built by her deceased grandfather. There she meets Dr. Mark Bellows (Steven Pasquale), Chief Surgical Resident, a doctor in a relationship with the Head of Psychiatry Dr. Agnetta Lindquist (Geena Davis). Wheeler discovers that an unusually high number of surgeries at the hospital have been ending in comas. These coma patients are being transferred to the mysterious Jefferson Institute, a hospital designed to take care of coma patients. It is run by Mrs. Emerson (Ellen Burstyn), who refers to the patients as her \\"babies\\". With the help of Dr. Bellows (and soon Dr. Theodore Stark (James Woods), Chief of Surgery), Wheeler investigates the comas, and before long, strange things begin to happen seemingly to stop her investigation: her roommate, who works at the hospital and who helped her to access confidential files, is suddenly fired; the hospital board tries to have her expelled from school; and she discovers cameras in her house. She is also stalked by Peter Arno (Michael Weston), who turns out to be a patient of Dr. Lindquist's and seems to be stalking Wheeler at Lindquist's behest. During one encounter with Wheeler, Peter puts a burlap sack over her head and tells her that if she does not stop looking into the comas, she will end up at Jefferson too. Soon after a rare tour at Jefferson, during which Wheeler wanders off path and discovers inhumane practices such as suspending patients by metal rods inserted into their bones, she contacts Dr. Stark with evidence, but he is in a car accident that renders him comatose before he can expose the conspiracy. Wheeler and Dr. Bellows‚Äîwho began suspecting Dr. Lindquist's role in the conspiracy and broke off their relationship‚Äîtogether find out that various hospital staff and doctors have been getting large amounts of money from Jefferson. They further discover that each patient who ended up in a coma was operated on in the same room, which was pumped full of carbon monoxide via a pipe from the basement; this would render the patient brain dead without anyone noticing. Arno tries to kill Wheeler as she tries to collect evidence, but when he fails, he slits his own throat in a body cooler. Wheeler is eventually captured and delivered to Jefferson, where they plan to put her into a coma. She breaks free, though severely sedated, and tries to escape through the hospital, hallucinating that she is underwater. As she flees, she finds out the complete truth - the Jefferson Institute is a human experimentation laboratory and organ farm. Jefferson has Peach Tree Memorial purposely induce comas on patients predisposed to certain diseases and then uses the bodies in various ways, ranging from harvesting organs from the patients directly, to inducing pregnancy to use the fetuses for parts or umbilical stem cells to using them as human test subjects. Finally she encounters Professor Hillside, her medical school professor, who tells her that he and her late grandfather, Dr. Wheeler, are the masterminds of the Jefferson Institute, making it their legacy. Wheeler cries, distraught that this barbarism is being carried out in the name of medical advancement. Meanwhile, Dr. Bellows and police Detective Jackson (who has been investigating the stalking of Wheeler and the death of Arno) both end up at the house of Dr. Stark. There they find most of the doctors gathered for Dr. Stark's memorial; Stark died during surgery a few hours before. While there, Dr. Nelson, head of anesthesiology and a part of the conspiracy, is seemingly overcome by guilt and tells the detective and Dr. Bellows that they can find Wheeler at the Jefferson Institute. The police and Dr. Bellows soon enter the institute and witness the horror for themselves. They arrest Professor Hillside and Dr. Bellows discovers Wheeler, who stabbed Mrs. Emerson to death with a syringe in self-defense and escaped through a drain. The miniseries ends with Wheeler awake in a hospital with Dr. Bellows by her side. She tells him she had \\"a terrible dream ... I dreamt I was underwater and I couldn't get out.\\" Dr. Bellows tells her \\"it was just a dream\\" and then receives a text message with a picture of Dr. Lindquist, asking him to join her at a hospital in China. Dr. Bellows looks at Susan and repeats, \\"It was just a dream.\\" Cast *Lauren Ambrose as Susan Wheeler, Medical School student trainee at Peach Tree Memorial Hospital *Steven Pasquale as Dr. Mark Bellows, Chief Surgical Resident at Peach Tree Memorial Hospital *Geena Davis as Dr. Agnetta Lindquist, Head of Psychiatry at Peach Tree Memorial Hospital *James Woods as Dr. Theodore Stark, Chief of Surgery at Peach Tree Memorial Hospital *Ellen Burstyn as Mrs. Emerson, Head of Operations at the Jefferson Institute *Richard Dreyfuss as Professor Hillside, Professor at Atlanta University *James Rebhorn as Oren *Joe Morton as Dr. Nelson, head of Anesthesiology at Peach Tree Memorial Hospital *Michael Weston as Peter Arno *Joseph Mazzello as Geoffrey Fairweather *Brian J.

Adelle (ed.) (2012) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. Its environmental policy is significantly intertwined with other international and national environmental policies. The environmental legislation of the European Union also has significant effects on those of its member states. The European Union's environmental legislation addresses issues such as acid rain, the thinning of the ozone layer, air quality, noise pollution, waste, water pollution and sustainable energy. The Institute for European Environmental Policy estimates the body of EU environmental law amounts to well over 500 Directives, Regulations and Decisions.  The beginnings of the EU's environmental policy  The Paris Summit meeting of heads of state and government of the European Economic Community (EEC) in October 1972 is often used to pin point the beginning of the EU's environmental policy.Knill, C. and Liefferink, D. (2012) The Establishment of EU Environmental Policy. In: Jordan, A.J. and C. Adelle (ed.) (2012) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. A declaration on environmental and consumer policy was adopted at this summit which requested the European Commission to draw up an action programme for environmental protection. This (first) Environmental Action Programme was adopted in July 1973 and represented the EU's first environmental policy.Hildebrand, P.M. (1993) The European Community's environmental policy, 1957 to '1992', in D. Judge (ed) A Green Dimension for the European Community, Frank Cass, London, pp13-44. Furthermore, the task force within the Commission that drew up this action programme eventually led to the formation of a Directorate General for the Environment. The primary reason at that time for the introduction of a common environmental policy was the concern that diverse environmental standards could result in trade barriers and competitive distortions in the Common Market.Johnson, S.P. and Corcelle, G. (1989) The Environmental Policy of the European Communities, Graham & Trotman, London. Different national standards for particular products, such as limitations on vehicle emissions for the lead content of petrol, posed significant barriers to the free trade of these products within the Economic Community (EC). An additional motivation driving the EU's emerging environmental policy was the increasing international politicisation of environmental problems and the growing realisation from the beginning of the 1970s that environmental pollution did not stop at national borders, but had to be addressed by cross-border measures.Knill, C. and Liefferink, D. (2012) The Establishment of EU Environmental Policy. In: Jordan, A.J. and C. Adelle (ed.) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. At that time there was no mention of environmental policy in the founding treaties of the EU and therefore no explicit Treaty basis which underpinned EU environmental policy. However, the Treaty text was interpreted dynamically, enabling environmental policy to be regarded as an essential goal of the Community, even though it was not explicitly mentioned. It was not until the middle of the 1980s and the signing of the Single European Act in 1986 that economic and ecological objectives were put on a more equal footing within the Community.McCormick, J. (2001) Environmental Policy in the European Union. Palgrave: Basingstoke.  Main actors  EU environmental policy is shaped by a variety of actors including all of the main EU institutions as well as lobby groups which makeup the wider Brussels policy making community. Member states shape EU environmental policy by working within the Council of Ministers. The Council is a central actor in decision making in the EU sharing its decision making power with the European Parliament under the ‚Äòordinary legislative procedure‚Äô.Lewis, J. (2010) ‚ÄòThe Council of European Union‚Äô, in M. Cini and N. P√©rez-Sol√≥rzano Borrag√°n (eds) European Union Politics, 3rd edition, Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp141-61. There are different Council formations (made up of ministers responsible for particular policy areas) one of which is the Environment Council. The number of Environment Council meetings has increased significantly over time. Heads of state meet in something different ‚Äì the European Council ‚Äì which until recently had very little to do with environmental policy. However, more recently the European Council has played an important role in EU climate change policy in particular.R√ºdiger K. and Wurzel, W. (2012) Member States and the Council. In: Jordan, A.J. and C. Adelle (ed.) (2012) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. The European Commission not only has an exclusive right to propose new environmental policy, but it also has a responsibility to ensure the implementation of environmental rules. Therefore, since its creation in the 1950s the European Commission has been at the heart of the European Union. However, it did not set up a unit dedicated to environmental issues until the 1970s and a full Directorate General for the environment until 1981.Sch√∂n- Quinlivan (2012)The European Commission, In: Jordan, A.J. and Adelle, C. (eds) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. Initially DG Environment was perceived as a relatively weak DG but it has gradually become more assertive through the development of technical and political expertise. However, the Commission still has to depend on member states to implement its policies. Traditionally, the European Parliament gained a reputation as a champion of environmental interests within the EU where it provided an access point for those excluded from decision making and a voice for green political parties.Meyer, J.-H. (2011): Green Activism. The European Parliament's Environmental Committee promoting a European Environmental Policy in the 1970s. In: Journal of European Integration History vol. 17, no. 1, S. 73-85, ISSN 0947-9511, S. 73-85, available from: http://www.eu- historians.eu/uploads/Dateien/jeih-33-2011_1.pdf However, it was a reactive and relatively weak institution. More recently the Parliament has benefited from treaty changes that have made it a co-legislator with the Council of Ministers. However, the empowerment of the Parliament seems to have reduced its green credentials as it now appears less willing to adopt green amendments.Burns, C. and Carter, N. (2010a) ‚ÄòIs codecision good for the environment?‚Äô Political Studies, vol 58, no 1, pp128-142. Over the last 40 years the EU has attracted the interest of a vast number of lobby groups including environmental NGOs. As early as 1974, environmental groups from all the member states established a central representation in Brussels, founding the European Environmental Bureau. Other environmental NGOs only set up shop in Brussels from the late 1980s onwards.Meyer, J.-H. 2013. Challenging the Atomic Community. The European Environmental Bureau and the Europeanization of Anti-Nuclear Protest. In Societal Actors in European Integration. Polity- Building and Policy-Making 1958-1992, edited by W. Kaiser and J.-H. Meyer. Basingstoke: Palgrave, 197-220. European institutions, especially the European Commission, provide relatively easy access to these groups compared to some national governments.Adelle, C. and Anderson, J. (2012) Lobby Groups. In: Jordan, A.J. and C. Adelle (ed.) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. The European Commission has even actively encouraged their participation in policy making by setting up consultative committees and other bodies, and providing funds to establish and maintain certain core groups.Eising, R. and Lehringer, S. (2010) ‚ÄòInterest groups and the European Union‚Äô, in M. Cini and N. P√©rez-Sol√≥rzano Borrag√°n (eds) European Union Politics, Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp189-206.  Policy processes  Policy making in the EU can be extremely complex. It has been suggested that the policy making process is too densely populated with veto players (i.e. actors whose agreement is necessary for a policy to be adopted) for any single actor or group of actors (including the EU's member states) to consistently control the direction of policy making.Weale, A. (2005) ‚ÄòEnvironmental rules and rule-making in the European Union‚Äô, in A. Jordan (ed) Environmental Policy in the European Union, 2nd edition, Earthscan, London, pp125-140. The result in environmental policy making has been widely depicted as being especially unpredictable, unstable and at times even chaotic. However, the European Commission, as a key player in the policy making process, has under pressure to develop ‚Äòstandard operating procedures‚Äô for processing policy.Mazey, S., Richardson, J. (1992) ‚ÄòEnvironmental groups and the EC: Challenges and opportunities‚Äô, Environmental Politics, vol 1, no 4, p110. This has led to a number of changes in policy making processes in recent years, including: adopting minimum standards of consultation; the impact assessment of all major policy proposals; and the earlier publication of its work programmes.Adelle, C., Jordan, A., and Turnpenny, J. (2012) Policy Making. In: Jordan, A.J. and C. Adelle (ed.) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. The focus of EU environmental policy making has also changed in recent years concentrating more on updating existing policies than on building-up the EU's role in environmental policy.Princen, S. (2012) Agenda Setting. In: Jordan, A.J. and C. Adelle (ed.) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. In the 1970s and 1980s EU environmental policy was marked by the rapid build-up of a body of legislation that covered a range of issues previously not dealt with at EU level. Since the 1980s, other new issues have been taken up but in addition an increasing proportion of the environmental agenda has been taken up by debates on the revision of existing legislation. As a result, the proportion of EU environmental legislation that amends previous laws has steadily increased over time. Consequently, for most environmental issues, the key question is no longer: ‚Äòshould the EU be involved?‚Äô but ‚Äòwhat should the EU be doing?‚Äô And the logic for getting the issue on the EU political agenda is no longer to make the EU take it up but to change existing policies (strengthening or weakening them, depending on a political actor's objectives). This change in both the stakes of and the key struggle in agenda setting strategies, marks a shift from ‚Äònew issues‚Äô to ‚Äòongoing or recurring concerns‚Äô. In its policy making processes the EU has made a sizeable effort to undertake a particular type of policy coordination, namely the integration of environmental considerations into the operation of all policy sectors. The potential of environmental policy integration is undoubtedly ambitious: economically powerful sectors such as agriculture, energy and transport should ‚Äòdesign out‚Äô environmental problems in the development of their own policies.Lenschow, A. (2002) Environmental Integration. Earthscan: London. However, it has proven much harder to implement than many had originally expected, not least those working in the European Commission's environment directorate-general. A significant causal factor here has been the EU's fragmented institutional and political structure, which on the one hand has facilitated the adoption of visionary policy objectives, but has also undermined their implementation.Jordan, A., Schout, A. and Unfried, M. (2012) Policy Coordination. In: Jordan, A.J. and C. Adelle (ed.) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. Implementation is very much at the ‚Äòsharp end‚Äô of the EU policy process. The success of EU policies ‚Äì and with them the whole integration project ‚Äì are often judged by the impacts they have on the ground. If, however, the acquis (the body of EU law) is not fully implemented, EU policies risk becoming paper exercises with little tangible effect on environmental quality but serious distorting impacts on the Single Market.Jordan, A., and Tosun, J. (2012) Policy Implementation. In: Jordan, A.J. and C. Adelle (ed.) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. The implementation of policy in the EU is widely regarded as being problematic.Jordan, A. (1999)'The implementation of EU environmental policy: a problem without a political solution?' Environmental and Planning C, vol. 17, no. 1, pp69-90. Yet, both public and academic understanding of this crucial stage of the EU policy process remains relatively limited. Indeed, for a long time, a number of factors kept the whole issue of poor implementation down or off the political agenda, but today it is much more politicised, pushed along by the campaigning activities of NGOs and pro-integration actors such as the European Parliament. A whole host of solutions to the EU's implementation problems have been offered, some of which could, if deployed, even compound the problem. But in many respects, the causes of poor (or at least imperfect) implementation reside in the very structure of the EU. Consequently, there are likely to be no panaceas. To develop new environmental policies, it is important first to evaluate those that have already been adopted. However, this intuitively simple idea is difficult to apply in practice, no more so than in the EU where the complex system of multi-level governance adds considerably to the practical difficulty of evaluating policies.Mickwitz, P.(2012) Policy Evaluation. In: Jordan, A.J. and C. Adelle (ed.) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. Assessing impacts and finding side-effects of policies is best achieved by a plurality of data, methods, analysts and theories, as well as evaluation criteria. In recent years the demand for evaluations of EU policies and programmes has increased as the importance of evaluation has become more widely recognised. Many actors have become involved in commissioning, producing and using evaluations (including the European Environment Agency), but the role of evaluation is often still quite weak. Synergic to the environmental policy in Europe is the European environmental research and innovation policy. It aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development.  The environmental research and innovation policy  Europe is particularly active in this field and the European environmental research and innovation policy aims at promoting more and better research and innovation for building a resource-efficient and climate-resilient society and economy in sync with the natural environment. Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme Horizon 2020, which is also open to participation worldwide.See Horizon 2020 ‚Äì the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press- release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm  The EU as a global environmental actor  The EU is an important ‚Äì even an ‚Äòinfluential‚ÄôRhinard, M. andKaeding, M. (2006) The international bargaining power of the European Union in \\"mixed\\" competence negotiations: the case of the 2000 Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. Journal of Common Market Studies, vol. 48, no. 4, pp. 923‚Äì943. ‚Äì actor in international environmental negotiations. Therefore, if one wants to understand the processes and outcomes of international environmental negotiations, one needs to be familiar with the role that the EU plays there. Also, developments at the international level have an influence on the EU, its policies and the extent to which it can be a global actor. Hence, European and international environmental politics and policies are constantly interacting and thus mutually constitutive.Delreux, T.(2012) The EU as an Actor in global environmental politics. In: Jordan, A.J. and C. Adelle (ed.) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. The EU is a party to all major Multi- lateral Environmental Agreements covering a whole variety of environmental issues. The EU is also able to fully participate in international environmental negotiations, either as an observer in the UN context or as a party to the mother treaty in various Conference of the Parties (COPs) and Meeting of the Parties (MOPs). The EU is often observed as a leader in global environmental politics, but its leadership role can nowadays also be questioned, especially in the area of climate change. The EU's international climate change policy consists of three building blocks (environmental integrity, multilateralism, a legally binding instrument), which are under pressure in the context of the current climate change negotiations. As in other areas of external action, the EU's external environmental policy is often characterised by a mismatch between its ambitions and its ability to deliver in practice.  Environmental protection  When the EEC was established, environmental protection, let alone the broader concept of sustainable development, was not perceived as an important policy issue. The concept of sustainable development contains environmental, social and economic dimensions; finding practical ways to balance the three is widely regarded as a key challenge. The EU policies in the field of sustainable development evolved as a result of the interaction between internal political drivers and the EU's response to a number of key UN conferences.Pallemaerts, M.and Azmanova, A.(eds)(2006) The European Union and Sustainable Development: Internal and external dimensions. VUB Press: Brussels. One such influential conference was the first UN Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm in 1972. This not only addressed the environmental concerns of the industrialised countries in the North, but also, the development concerns of countries in the South. Sustainable development was only mentioned in European Council Conclusions for the first time in 1988. Wavering political support for ‚Äòsustained growth‚Äô and/or ‚Äòsustainable development‚Äô continued for some years and reveals just how ambivalent attitudes were to the concept.Pallemaerts, M.(2012) Developing more Sustainably? In: Jordan, A.J. and C. Adelle (ed.) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. The 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam eventually ensured the formal recognition of sustainable development as a legal objective under the Treaties. Subsequently, the EU's commitment to sustainable development was formalised as one of the EU's fundamental goals. In 1997, the EU committed itself to draw up a ‚Äònational‚Äô strategy for sustainable development by 2002. The Commission published a Communication on a European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development in 2001 which was discussed at the G√∂teborg European Council.An outline of the European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development, proposed in Helsinki in 1999 can be found in European Commission (2001): A Sustainable Europe for a Better World: A European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development, Report No. COM(2001)264 final However, this strategy suffered from several governance weaknesses which inhibited its implementation. In particular, the Strategy has been heavily affected by its ambiguous relationship to the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs, which has received far higher political priority. The political and institutional crisis that faced the EU in 2005 after the rejection of the EU Constitution, pushed the Sustainable Development Strategy back up the political agenda. A ‚Äòrenewed‚Äô SDS was subsequently adopted by the EU Council in 2006. The renewed strategy contained more detailed arrangements for implementation, monitoring and follow-up. The legal formalisation of the EU's commitment to sustainable development as a policy objective was completed by the Lisbon Treaty. Sustainable development is now repeatedly mentioned in the Treaties: as a basic objective of the EU in the new Article 3 TEU; in Article 21 TEU concerning the external action of the Union; and in Article 11 TFEU setting out the integration principle. The EU is now legally committed to pursue sustainable development both internally and externally (i.e. in its relations with ‚Äòthe wider world‚Äô). This legal commitment led to the setting up of an impact assessment process to be done ex ante, i.e. before the fact, to ensure that all future EU legislation would conform to the principles of sustainable development as laid down in the EU Strategy for Sustainable Development. In fact, multiple processes of impact assessment emerged: Commission-wide Impact Assessment for all future EU legislation,See publication by Ruddy/Hilty under Regulatory Impact Analysis Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) for DG Trade See the special issue edited by Clive George, Bernice Goldsmith (2006): Introduction: Impact assessment of trade- related policies and agreements: experience and challenges, Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal, Vol. 24, No. 4, pp. 254-258, doi:doi:10.3152/147154606781765075George, Clive (2010): The Truth about Trade: The Real Impact of Liberalization and Integrated Sustainability Assessment (ISA) as envisioned in EU-funded research projects such as MATISSE, In-Context and VISION RD4SD, which has been recommended for consideration as a methodology for future global assessments.Integrated sustainability assessment: what is it, why do it and how? P. M. Weaver, J. Rotmans (eds.), International Journal of Innovation and Sustainable Development, Vol. 1, No. 4.

Palgrave, 176-198. and the Habitats Directive are pieces of European Union legislation for protection of biodiversity and natural habitats. These protections however only directly cover animals and plants; fungi and micro- organisms have no protection under European Union law. The directives are implemented through the Natura 2000 programme and covers 30,000 sites throughout Europe.  Free trade challenges to EU environmental policy  A draft of the sustainable development section of Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and the US was leaked to The Guardian in October 2015. Asked to comment on the document, a French environmental attorney described the proposed environmental safeguards as \\"virtually non-existent\\" by comparison with the protection granted to investors, and that environmental cases accounted for 60% of the 127 ISDS cases already brought against EU countries under bilateral trade agreements in the last two decades, according to Friends of the Earth Europe. According to Joseph E. Stiglitz, TTIP could have a \\"chilling\\" effect on regulation and thus \\"undercut urgently needed action on climate that the Paris Agreement requires\\". The draft energy chapter of the TTIP was leaked to The Guardian in July 2016. This draft could sabotage European efforts to implement mandatory energy savings measures and to favour the switch to renewable electricity generation.

It was created by the retailer company Casino Group in 2005. History In the late 1990s, the food retailer company Casino Group delegated the management of their retailer properties in a new subsidiary, Groupe Casino Immobili√®re. In 2005, it was turned into a company with independent operations, which would go public itself, called Mercialys, although Groupe Casino retained a majority stake and therefore its control. Mercialys was listed on the Paris Bourse on November 1, 2005. The new company opted for the SIIC legal tax status for real estate investment trusts. Activities La Caserne de Bonne, one of the shopping malls leased by Mercialys. Mercialys leases its properties (mostly shopping malls, self- service restaurants and other vendor locations) to retailer companies so that these exploit it. The fact Mercialys maintains retail property assets in the long run, renovating and renting them, with limited exposure to development activities, gives it an advantage and a lower risk for investors. It manages more than 120 properties, with a gross leasable area of about 714,500 m2. The Mercialys' subsidiaries include Mercialys Gestion, Timur SCI, Point Confort and La Diane, among others. On March 4, 2012, Mercialys issued a bond to seven years, raising 650 million. Also, it took debt from five banks to finance a 1.25 billion euros exceptional distribution for shareholders.

As of the 2016‚Äì17 school year, the high school consists of one campus, which holds 9th - 12th grade.  History  Built in 1890, North Little Rock's (Argenta's) first high school was called North Side High School, later Clendenin Hill High School (site of present-day Argenta Alternative Academy at 13th & Main Streets). In 1912, the 16 classroom Argenta High School was constructed. In 1917 450 children attended the school.Hanley, Steven G. and Ray Hanley. Around Little Rock: A Postcard History. Arcadia Publishing, June 1, 1998. , 9780738568676. p. 118. The rapid northward growth of North Little Rock in the mid-1920s resulted in a doubling of school enrollment. In 1928, as the need for a new high school increased, the North Little Rock School Board selected the corner of 22nd and Main Streets as the new construction site for North Little Rock High School. As a result, North Side High School became a junior high school. The original Argenta High School facility, which included an auditorium, a gymnasium, and a recitation room, stood until its 1976 demolition. The North Little Rock High School was constructed beginning in 1928 and completed in 1930. Little Rock architect George R. Mann of the firm Peterson, William, Mann, Wanger & King designed the high school as a light colored brick and concrete building in an Art-Deco style. Between 1956 and 1959, North Little Rock High School served students in the 10th, 11th and 12th grade for nearby City of Sherwood before the construction of Sylvan Hills High School was completed. In 1970, the North Little Rock School District closed Scipio Jones High School, the segregated public school for black children, as a result of desegregation and the city established a new integrated public high school and thus integrated and renamed the then 40-year-old classic art- deco facility along Main Street as Ole Main High School and named the new facility as Northeast High School. For the next twenty years, the Northeast Chargers served as a natural rival for the Ole Main Wildcats. Then in 1990, the school district consolidated the two schools as North Little Rock High School East Campus (formerly Northeast) for ninth and tenth grades and North Little Rock High School West Campus (formerly Ole Main) for eleventh and twelfth grades. As a result of the consolidation, the schools' new mascot became the Charging Wildcats as it remains today. In 1993, North Little Rock High School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2012, the city of North Little Rock passed a millage to integrate the school into one campus for all high schoolers, grades 9-12. Construction for the new building and demolition of old ones began the following school year. The district had to shuffle grades to different campuses to allow for it. The new high school is predicted to be functioning in the 2016-17 school year.  Curriculum  The school's assumed course of study is based on the Smart Core curriculum developed by the Arkansas Department of Education. The school offers coursework and exams in Advanced Placement (AP) and since 1992 offers the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme. Additionally, the school is a member of the EAST (Environmental And Spatial Technologies) Initiative that allows students to familiarize themselves with technology through partnerships with technology firms. The school's teachers received the 1982, 1990, and 1997 Arkansas Teacher of the Year awards by the state's education department and the 1979 and 1987 Bandmaster of the Year award by the Arkansas School Band and Orchestra Association.  Extracurricular activities  The school's mascot and athletic emblem is the Charging Wildcat with royal blue and gold serving as the school colors. = Athletics = For 2012‚Äì14, the Charging Wildcats participate in numerous interscholastic sports and events from the 7A Classification‚Äîthe state's largest classification‚Äîwithin the 7A Central Conference administered by the Arkansas Activities Association including: baseball, basketball (boys'/girls'), bowling (boys'/girls'), cheer (boys'/girls'), cross country (boys'/girls'), dance, debate, football, golf (boys'/girls'), soccer (boys'/girls'), softball, speech, swimming (boys'/girls'), tennis (boys'/girls'), track (boys'/girls'), volleyball and wrestling. = Theatre Arts = NLRHS is proud to have a long tradition as one of the largest speech, drama, and dance programs in the state of Arkansas.

Family and early life Prince Heinrich XXXIII Reuss was the son of the Prince Heinrich VII Reuss of K√∂stritz and Princess Marie Alexandrine of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. Through his mother, Prince Heinrich XXXIII was heir to the throne of the Kingdom of the Netherlands until the birth of the Crown Princess Juliana, daughter of Queen Wilhelmina. Prince Reuss was trained as a doctor, and passed all his medical examinations; he entered the army subsequently and took a commission in the 2nd Dragoon Guards, and afterwards served in the diplomatic service. It was Prince Reuss before whom the two English doctors, Dr. Elliot and Dr. Austin, who were arrested as spies in Belgium when tried. The question to be decided by the Prince was whether they were doctors or not, and he had to put them through a severe examination in medicine. They were acquitted, and the Prince reportedly said \\"he thought those two English doctors two of the finest and most honest men he had ever met.\\" Dutch succession Queen Wilhelmina in 1898. Prince Heinrich XXXIII Reuss was seen as the most probable heir to the Dutch throne in the event that Queen Wilhelmina remained childless. Thus until 1909 he could be considered as an heir although he had severe competition from the Wied family (Princess Marie zu Wied was a daughter of Prince Frederick of the Netherlands and very popular in the Netherlands). Prince Heinrich XXXIII was the younger son of Marie Alexandrine (daughter of Princess Sophie of the Netherlands) and Prince Heinrich VII Reuss of K√∂stritz. A contemporary report said \\"Prince Henry XXXII of Reuss, who is next in order to the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar, is said to have no ambition in the direction of the Dutch throne, and to be willing to \\"renounce\\" in favour of Prince Henry XXXIII, now employed at the Berlin foreign Office, and until a year ago a member of the German Embassy in Paris. Early last year Prince Henry XXXIII was the guest of the Queen at The Hague, and was made much of at the Court and in social circles, so that he came to be generally regarded as \\"first favourite\\" in the succession. He is a man of varied talents; as a sculptor and as a painter he has produced ivories which have been accorded favourable criticism.\\" Marriage His first marriage was to Princess Victoria Margaret of Prussia, daughter of Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia and Princess Louise Sophie of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg-Augustenburg, on 17 May 1913 at Neues Palais, Potsdam, Brandenburg, Germany. They had two children, a daughter Maria Luise (b. 1915) and a son Heinrich (b. 1916). They were divorced on 14 July 1922. He next married the wealthy American Allene Tew (1872-1955) on 10 April 1929 in Paris, France. They were divorced on 31 October 1935 Her divorce from the prince was said to have been caused by his espousal of the Nazi cause. {citation} Death He died on 15 November 1942 at age 63 at Stonsdorf. He gained the title of Prinz Reuss zu K√∂stritz. His former wife, Allene Tew, became the guardian of his young son and brought him to America with her and her new husband, Count Paul De Kotzebue, shortly after their marriage in 1936.

It falls during the monsoon season, on the sixth day of the bright half of the month of Bhadrapada (usually in September). Dedicated to Surya, the Sun God, Varanasi will witness the holy dip taken by thousands of female devotees in the ancient stepwell pond of Lolark Kund (a sacred water body) and mark the festival of Lolarak. Couples from Varanasi and its neighbouring villages will perform religious rituals and pray to Lord Lolark Aditya that they be blessed with a child. Devotees will leave their clothes and a fruit or a vegetable (from which they pledge to abstain thereafter) in the kund after taking a holy dip in the Lolark kund. Many do so with hopes for a male child/heir or offspring. As thousands come to bathe in the holy waters of the Lolark kund at sun rise, a makeshift colourful bazaar mushrooms around the kund. Families cook puris on open camp fires all around the ancient kund. Steps lead down to the Kund from three sides. On the fourth side, the kund takes the shape of an enlonged, arched well, pointing into the direction of the rising sun (Ganges). Some devotees also throw considerable amounts of gold jewellary into the pond, which may later be harvested and distributed amongst the Mahant and Brahmins in order to finance the event and it's clean-up afterwards.

The word is compounded from the Latin prefix omni-, meaning \\"all\\", and the word shambles, a term for a situation of total disorder. Originally a \\"shambles\\" denoted the designated stock-felling and butchery zone of a medieval street market, from the butchers' benches (Latin scamillus \\"low stool, a little bench\\"). The word refers to a situation that is seen as shambolic from all possible perspectives. It gained popularity in 2012 after sustained usage in the political sphere led to its being named Oxford English Dictionary Word of the Year, and it was formally added to the online editions of the Oxford Dictionary of English in August 2013. Background The term, coined by writer Tony Roche, was first used at the end of the first episode of the third series of BBC political satire The Thick of It, broadcast in 2009, during which Nicola Murray (Rebecca Front) is drafted in as a cabinet minister for the fictional Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship at the behest of the government's director of communications Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi). Murray's first day as a cabinet minister is fraught with press inquiries about her husband's involvement in a private finance initiative contract, her appropriation of an expensive office chair from a staff member, and her intention to send her daughter to a private school. Tucker sends Murray to launch a by-election campaign, but a communications error results in her standing in front of the candidate's poster and blocking most of the letters so the sign appears to read \\"I am bent\\" (British slang that could mean either corrupt or homosexual) as she is filmed and photographed. Tucker believes Murray to be a potential cause of political controversy, and his patience expires when it is revealed the minister is claustrophobic when she refuses to enter a lift. Tucker then delivers an angry rebuke to her: Entry into popular lexicon The term was popularised by Labour Party leader and Leader of the Opposition Ed Miliband MP in a speech to the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions on 18 April 2012, criticising the government's 2012 budget and the resulting public image: The term was again used in Parliament by Opposition politicians to criticise various government actions: by Chuka Umunna, Ed Balls, Steve Rotheram, Julie Hilling, Rachel Reeves, and Catherine McKinnell to criticise the budget; Yvette Cooper to criticise the failed deportation of Abu Qatada; and Ivan Lewis, Margaret Curran, and Caroline Flint in reference to the perceived ineffectualness of the government. It was adapted for use in Scottish politics by Labour MSP Richard Baker, who referred to First Minister Alex Salmond's refusal to admit to a lack of legal advice on an independent Scotland's accession to the European Union as a \\"Scomnishambles\\". The term made its debut in Australian politics in 2013 during a reply to the Governor-General's speech by Australian Greens Senator Scott Ludlam. Due to its adoption as a political catchphrase, the editors of the Collins English Dictionary submitted the word for the dictionary's first public consultation into new additions, defining it as \\"something which is completely and continuously shambolic\\". In news coverage preceding the fourth series of The Thick of It, use of the term was cited by the cast and crew as an example of life imitating art; in an interview with ShortList, series co- writer Will Smith commented that politicians were \\"watching the show and embracing it\\", describing Miliband's use of the phrase as \\"baffling\\". A similar term, \\"Romneyshambles\\" was created as a political attack during the 2012 United States presidential election, based on comments Republican Party nominee Mitt Romney made criticizing London's preparations for the 2012 Summer Olympics. On 13 November 2012, omnishambles was named Word of the Year by the Oxford English Dictionary. Lexicographer and judge on the panel Fiona McPherson remarked that: \\"It was a word everyone liked, which seemed to sum up so many of the events over the last 366 days in a beautiful way.\\" The word was formally added to the online editions of the Oxford Dictionary of English in August 2013 together with a number of other words that had also gained popularity during 2012 and 2013. These included selfie, twerk and digital detox. The term re-emerged following the 2017 United Kingdom general election, which produced a hung parliament, and was used to describe Conservative efforts to form a confidence-and-supply agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party.http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/dup-tory- deal_uk_593ce995e4b0c5a35ca037cd It was also used to describe the UK's Brexit negotiations process following the 2017 election.http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2017/06/brexit- omnishambles-6-moments-eu-negotiations-could-end-chaos The word \\"pomnishambles\\" (Pom being an Australian derogatory word for an English person) was used by BBC writer Tom Fordyce (apparently quoting others) for the England men's cricket team and their lack of success against Australia in late 2017.https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/41859201 In 2020, during the COVID-19 Pandemic, in the UK, the word re-emerged in late May (as 'Domnishambles' - a portmanteau of Dominic Cummings' first name and the word 'Omnishambles') as it was revealed that the government advisor Dominic Cummings had breached the lockdown imposed by the government to curb the virus.

Tsagaan Ubgen (\\"The elder White\\", \\"White Old Man\\"; Mongolian: Buryat: Russian: ) is the Mongolian guardian of life and longevity, one of the symbols of fertility and prosperity in the Buddhist pantheon. He is worshiped as a deity in what scholars have called \\"white shamanism\\", a subdivision of what scholars have called \\"Buryat yellow shamanism\\"‚Äîthat is, a tradition of shamanism that \\"incorporate[s] Buddhist rituals and beliefs\\" and is influenced specifically by Tibetan Buddhism. Sagaan Ubgen originated in Mongolia. In some versions of the mythology, Sagaan Ubgen the White Elder is the partner of It√ºgen, Mother Earth, also known as Et√ºgen Eke.  Syncretic incorporation into the Buddhist pantheon  The modern Mongolian and Buryat Buddhist pantheons include Tsagaan Ubgen, like many other figures in those pantheons, as a result of syncretism with the indigenous shamanism of the region. Before the introduction of Buddhism to Mongolia and Buryatia, he was the deity of longevity, wealth, and fertility. To account for his continued veneration as part of Buddhist practice, narratives have been added to his existing mythology, providing tales of how he was converted to Buddhism, and making him a patron of the latter religion, at the same time that he continues in his previous, more worldly, religious functions. One version of the story relates how, while the Buddha and his disciples were out walking one day, they met Tsagaan Ubgen, who so impressed the Buddha with his wisdom that he (Buddha) declared Tsagaan Ubgen to be a \\"saint\\". A different version of the tale has Tsagaan Ubgen as one of two hunters, the other being Hara Ubgen (), who, out hunting, encounter Milarepa in Milarepa's Cave. Milarepa persuades them to give up hunting and to take up the teaching of Buddhism.  Appearance and iconography  right Tsagaan Ubgen is often depicted similarly to the Tibetan deity Gyalpo Pehar, or to the Chinese god Old Man of the South Pole, who like Tsagaan Ubgen is a patron deity of family longevity, wealth, and health. His conventional appearance is that of a bald old man with a white beard. He carries a dragon- headed staff and the book of destiny and is traditionally accompanied by a deer and a peach tree.  In Mongolian tsam and Tibetan cham dances  In this 1880 picture of a tsam dance troupe, Sagaan Ubgen is seated at front right. Tsagaan Ubgen has the same kindly bald old man with a white beard appearance in the Mongolian version of the Cham dance. There, he appears alongside other masked characters representing other syncretic Buddhist gods such as Begze, MahƒÅkƒÅla, and the Garuda; and is one of the few characters in the dance who is able to speak. The Elder White character was imported from the Cham dance into the Tibetan Cham in the 20th century by order of the 13th Dalai Lama, who had a dream during his exile in Mongolia. He is named rgan po dkar po, or simply rgan dkar, in Tibetan, and was first introduced into the Cham dance as part of the New Year's dance of the Potala Palace at Namgyal Monastery. From there, he spread to cham dance in other monasteries throughout Tibet. In the Cham dance, Tsagaan Ubgen, dressed all in white with a snuff bottle attached to his girdle, is the main character in the \\"Tiger Dance\\", which symbolizes the transition to the new year from the old. He enters the dance area weak and staggering, or even being carried. After symbolically killing a tiger by striking a tiger skin with a stick, his strength is renewed. In some variations of the dance, he then proceeds to pass among the audience seeking donations of money, sometimes offering a peck of snuff from his bottle in return. In other variations, he begins to drink alcohol and continue dancing until he is too drunk to dance.  Footnotes  Various alternative transliterations of the name into the English alphabet exist including Tsagaan Uvgun, Tsagaan √ñvg√∂n (as used in ), Tsagaan Ebugen (as used in ), and Cagan √ñb√∂ (as used in ).

Tahoe Dam regulates the top six feet of Lake Tahoe, and distributes the water into Tahoe's primary outflow, the Truckee River. The dam is located in Tahoe City and serves as the main storage facility for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Newlands Project that also includes the Lahontan Dam and two diversion dams, providing irrigation water for of cropland mainly in the Lahontan Valley of western Nevada. The present Lake Tahoe dam replaced an older, privately owned dam built in 1870 at roughly the same location. The dam was built between 1909 and 1913 and stands high and long, raising Lake Tahoe by up to . Outflows from the dam are regulated by a gated spillway with 17 bays, with a maximum release capacity of . It is situated 400 feet downstream from the lake's natural shore. This is meant to help hydraulic control during a dry season with low water levels. The reservoir receives water from a catchment of and has a maximum storage capacity of .  History  = Early controversy = In the early 1860s, Russian born and San Francisco based engineer Alexis Waldemar Von Schmidt bought a large amount of land in the Tahoe-Truckee area with the hope of sending water westward to San Francisco via an aqueduct. He created the Lake Tahoe and San Francisco Water Works Company in 1865 in order to see his plan come to life, however Von Schmidt was shut down by California Legislature in 1870. Instead of allowing an aqueduct to be built from Tahoe to San Francisco, the California Legislature granted the Donner Lumber and Boom Company, which was then owned by Mark Hopkins and Leland Stanford, the right to build a dam on Tahoe's outlet. A small dam was then built from lumber and rocks. However, this did not discourage Von Schmidt, who, in the following year, continued to push for the ability to divert water to San Francisco. He eventually proposed his idea to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, which was to channel the water from the Truckee River to Squaw Valley, which would lead to the North Fork of the American River, and then finally through an aqueduct towards San Francisco. This project, in total would have cost $10 million at the time (today roughly $200 million) and had been approved by the San Francisco city supervisors, but was ultimately shut down by the mayor of San Francisco, who was wary of the possible lawsuits over water rights which could come his way. = Newlands Reclamation Act = Francis G. Newlands In 1892, newly-elected House of Representatives member from Nevada, Francis G. Newlands, began advocating for more irrigation in the western United States in order to further the United States' agricultural growth. His advocacy had begun when he first moved to Nevada in 1888 and began to dream up a new irrigation system for the west. Newlands called his project the Truckee Irrigation Project, which ultimately was unsuccessful as a private venture. However, although Newlands did not find success in his short career as an entrepreneur, his quest for more irrigation became part of the reason Newlands was voted into office. It was not until 1901, however, when Theodore Roosevelt became President, that there was any real progress made towards implementing the irrigation systems. With President Roosevelt's support, Representative Newlands was finally able to successfully push his bill through. On June 17, 1902, Congress passed the Newlands Reclamation Act, thus creating what is now known as the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). The first of five projects created from the Reclamation Act was the Truckee‚ÄìCarson Project, later renamed the Newlands Project, as Representative Newlands had been the bills main figurehead. Construction for the Newlands Project began in 1903 and they quickly made progress on building the Derby Dam and the Truckee Canal.  Newlands Project  In 1909, the Newlands Project set out to obtain the rights to the Tahoe Dam, which at that point had been owned by Truckee River General Electric Company. Although an agreement was not fully reached until June 4, 1915, rights of ownership for Tahoe Dam were given to the US government. Rights to control Tahoe Dam and some 14 acres surrounding the outlet was purchased for a total of $139,500 by the federal government. Prior to this change of ownership, both the Truckee River General Electric and the USBR contributed to the replacement of the small original rock-filled wooden dam with a more sustainable concrete slab and buttress structure dam. Tahoe Dam was slightly modernized in 1987 by the Safety of Dams Program, and it is this version of the dam which still in operation today. In total, the Newlands Project led to the creation of many irrigation systems within Nevada and California including: * Lake Tahoe Dam *Lahontan Dam, reservoir, and power plant * Truckee Canal *Carson River Diversion Dam *Derby Diversion Dam = Paiute Tribe lawsuit = As the USBR stated intent to repair the Tahoe Dam in 1987 in order to enhance its seismic resistance, the Paiute Tribe took advantage of this occasion to file a lawsuit against the federal government. In what became the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe of Indians v. Secretary of the Interior Hodel, the Paiute Tribe fought against how specific operations of the dam negatively impacted Pyramid Lake's endangered cui-iu fish species. The main problem which the Paiute Tribe had identified was that part of the Truckee River naturally flows into Pyramid Lake within the Paiute Reservation. However, with irrigation interference from the U.S. Government, Pyramid Lake received less water than it needed for its ecosystem to thrive. It was found that the endangerment of the cui-ui was directly related to the amount of water within Pyramid Lake. The court decided on August 9, 1989 that water would be stored in the Stampede Reservoir for the purpose of releasing it into Pyramid Lake as needed to partially make up for what water was being lost within the irrigation systems created and sustained by the Newlands Project.  Local landmark  Tahoe Dam from the local landmark, Fanny Bridge After having been built in the early 1900s, Tahoe Dam has become a local landmark for Tahoe City and the greater Tahoe-Truckee area. It was recognized on a national level and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 25, 1981. Another landmark associated with Tahoe Dam would be the famed Fanny Bridge, a small two-lane bridge connecting North Shore and West Shore of Lake Tahoe, located in Tahoe City and directly across from Tahoe Dam.

The Swedish troops were directly led by Charles XII King of Sweden who persecuted a force of Russians commanded by Karl Evald von R√∂nne from the minor battle of Krasnokutsk to the town Gorodnoye where a new battle took place. The Swedes were victorious but cancelled their offensive when the night fell.  Prelude  During the end of the 17th century, Russia, Denmark-Norway, Saxony and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth formed an allegiance against the Swedish Empire in order to regain what was lost in earlier wars. However, three of the original four nations were defeated in the span of seven years leaving only Russia to stand up against the Swedish invasions. In 1707 Charles XII began his campaign of Russia and strove through victories as Holowczyn ‚Äì 1708 and the siege of Veprik ‚Äì 1708, but also through setbacks as the Swedish defeat at Lesnaya ‚Äì 1708. Charles reached the outskirts of Krasnokutsk not long after Veprik and there encountered a small force of Russians which he engaged and managed to take several prisoners who told him that R√∂nne would be close by Krasnokutsk with about 5,000 dragoons. He then began his march there.  Engagement  He arrived on February 21, with a companion of 2,500 cavalry, many of whom were the elite guards (Drabants). He quickly engaged the 5,000 Russians under command of R√∂nne who had taken defensive positions at the end of the small town. R√∂nne and his force couldn't handle the cavalry shock and almost immediately began to retreat and in disorder they split up in two parts, one ran against a nearby hill and the other one against the nearby river Merla. Charles persecuted the ones heading up the hill and left Colonel D√ºcker to hunt down those crossing the river. During the pursuit many Russians were killed in orders from the Swedish king who didn't want to waste any time on captured prisoners during the fast forced chase, but instead catch up with the main bulk of the Russian fleeing army. After a thirteen-hours pursuit they reached Gorodnoye where R√∂nne made a new stand to repulse the Swedish cavalry. Also with new fresh reinforcements now numbering somewhere between 5,000‚Äì10,000. Charles halted his army after discovering this and tried to organize his fairly outspread men. R√∂nne then saw an opportunity to strike and launched a huge cavalry assault against the exhausted and numerical disadvantaged Swedish troops. This caused them to rout and run back the way they came. The roles were suddenly reversed and the pre- hunting Swedes were now persecuted by the pre-hunted Russians. Charles and his drabant-companions got separated from the bulk of the army and in personal danger the king fought off the many Russian followers together with his few men. After some time when the situation was faded to the very critical for the surrounded Swedes, Carl Gustaf Kruse showed up with some new fresh cavalry regiments who charged in and routed the Russians and saved the Swedish king. R√∂nne pulled his forces away from Gorodnoye and retreated in good order after discovering this. Charles then pulled his troops into Gorodnoye and engaged the remaining Russians but didn't want to chase the ones retreating even further due to the approaching night.  Aftermath  About 1,500 Russians were either killed or wounded during the engagements, R√∂nne had pulled his forces back and left the way more open for the Swedish army to march against Moscow. However, the cold weather and the scorched earth tactic the Russians used forced Charles XII plans to waste. The Swedish casualties were 132 killed and wounded during the engagements, the drabants had suffered 10 dead and many wounded. It's said that Charles showed a lot of personal bravery during the fighting. The campaign however, ended not long after, in 1709 when the Swedish army suffered a crushing defeat in the Battle of Poltava, which ended the time for Sweden as the leading power in the war.

Located on the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains, the dam was built by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) between 1926 and 1929 as part of the Sun River Project to develop about of irrigated land in the Sun River Valley. Specifications The dam is a high and long arch gravity structure, with a base thickness of tapering to at the crest. As a whole the dam contains about of concrete. The impounded water forms Gibson Reservoir, which can store up to at full water levels of . When full, the reservoir covers , with a shoreline of roughly and a maximum depth of . Water releases are controlled by two sets of outlets: three release valves at the base of the dam have a combined capacity of , while a gated tunnel spillway, controlled by six radial gates, can pass a maximum of . Gibson Dam's main function is to capture spring snowmelt and release it during summer for the irrigation for about of land on the north side of the Sun River and south of the river. Water released from Gibson travels downstream for about before it is intercepted by the Sun River Diversion Dam, which diverts water into the Pishkun Supply Canal, which sends water to the offstream Pishkun Reservoir. The Sun River Slope Canal System takes water from Pishkin Reservoir to serve the irrigated lands on the north side of the river. The headworks for the Fort Shaw Canal, which serves the lands south of the river, are located further downstream and take water directly from the river. The lands north of the river comprise the Greenfields Irrigation District, while the south side is run by the Fort Shaw Irrigation District. History On September 26, 1906, the Department of the Interior authorized the USBR's Sun River Project, under pressure from local residents, namely those of Great Falls, who wanted the irrigation of lands east of the Rocky Mountains along the Sun and Teton Rivers. Early proposals included the diversion of streams from west of the Continental Divide to augment the arid region's water supply, but eventually the project was pared down to comprise two storage dams on the Sun River and a tributary, Willow Creek; two off- stream reservoirs and a diversion dam; and seven main canals. As early as 1889, the Gibson Dam site ‚Äì located in a narrow mountain gap a few miles above the mouth of the Sun River canyon ‚Äì had been identified by U.S. surveyor Herbert Wilson as an excellent location to develop water storage on the Sun River. More detailed studies in 1911 by the USBR (then the U.S. Reclamation Service) confirmed Wilson's idea, and the first plans for a dam were drafted around 1920. However, it was not until September 1926 when the $1.5 million main construction contract was given to Utah Construction Company. The dam was one of the first to be built using the trial-load method, which relies primarily on mathematical calculations to determine the pressure of water on the structure, and thus the dam's final design. This method allowed the USBR to save an estimated of concrete, lowering costs significantly, since otherwise a considerable safety margin would have had to be built into the dam. Gibson Reservoir seen from above Actual construction started in December 1926, with Albert E. Paddock as project superintendent and Ralph Lowry as construction engineer. Preliminary excavations and site clearing were followed by the placement of a wooden flume to divert the river before concrete pouring in the foundation work could begin. When the foundations were complete, the flume was closed and water allowed to pass through outlet holes in the base of the dam. Concrete for the dam was mixed at a site roughly downstream and transported to the construction site via a light railway. The concrete was then placed via buckets transported by a cableway system, supported by two high towers. Two penstocks were installed on the south side of the dam and of transmission lines were built connecting the dam and Augusta, Montana in preparation for future hydroelectric generation. However, after determining that the future reservoir would not have enough capacity to sustain power production, USBR sealed the penstocks and the power lines fell into disuse. The dam was completed and the first water stored in December 1929 after three years of construction. In 1938, gates were installed in the spillway, increasing the reservoir's storage capacity by 20 percent. At least three people were killed on the project, including Paddock and an unknown workman; the latter fell from a height and struck the former on April 20, 1929. In the early phases of construction in 1926, a laborer, M. G. Miller, died from injuries sustained from a dynamite explosion. Flood control By halting the Sun River's spring freshet, Gibson Dam has prevented an estimated $3,044,000 in flooding damage between 1950 and 1999. In 1964, western Montana experienced one of the greatest flooding events in its recorded history, when record snowpack followed by heavy early spring rains caused more than $438 million (2011 dollars) of damage in the Flathead and Missouri River basins. On June 8, after reports of at least three dam failures on tributaries of the Missouri sent local residents into a panic, there were rumors that the Gibson Dam had failed. A U.S. Forest Service pilot was sent to investigate and found that water was overtopping the dam by over . The USBR later estimated the peak flow over the dam at , of which at least half was over the crest. After this event the dam was retrofitted so that it could be safely overtopped by up to of water. Hydroelectric power proposal The Gibson Dam Hydroelectric Company \\"Gibson Hydro\\" is a two-member partnership proposing a renewable energy facility on the Gibson Dam. Tollhouse Energy of Bellingham, WA a small- business hydropower developer and Greenfields Irrigation District of Fairfield, MT a farmer-managed water utility, are proposing the addition of a 15 megawatt (MW) powerhouse at the base of the dam. The powerhouse would generate electricity from irrigation water releases with an estimated annual production of 42.9 million kilowatt hours.

She was born while the ethnic Crimean Tatars were in deportation in Uzbekistan, having been expelled from their native lands on the Crimean Peninsula in the Black Sea as part of the USSR's ethnic cleansing (later recognized by the Ukrainian government in November, 2015 as genocide\\"Ukraine's parliament recognizes deportation of Crimean Tatars in 1944 as genocide\\", Ukraine Today. (12 November 2015)). It was not until 1989, after the fall of the USSR that the Crimean Tatars were allowed to return to their homeland of Crimea. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in acting for dramatic theatre and film from the National University of Theatre, Film and Television in Kiev, Ukraine, Zarema learned to speak Turkish and wrote several songs in Turkish. In 2007, she signed a recording contract with Sony BMG Music Entertainment Turkey and relocated to Istanbul for one year. There she released her self-titled debut Turkish language album which went on to achieve critical acclaim throughout Europe.

She has written many songs in English, a number of which have attracted considerable attention on online Music pools and have been played on numerous American radio stations. With a degree in theater and film, Zarema has also pursued an acting career in the United States, graduating from the Stella Adler Academy of Acting in Hollywood and studying under various reputable acting coaches. She became a member of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) in 2009 and in 2010 became a member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG, now SAG-AFTRA). Fluent in Russian, Turkish, Ukrainian, Crimean Tatar, and English, Zarema has been sought-after for her multi-lingual voice-over work, performing on numerous popular movies and television shows.  Early life  Spending her early childhood in Uzbekistan, Zarema was surrounded by a musical family. Her grandparents all had a passion for singing, as did her father, and she and her siblings followed suit. Zarema herself decided at the age of four that she wanted to become a singer and she sang in music contests and school performances at every opportunity. When Crimean Tatars were allowed to return from deportation, Zarema's family moved to their national homeland of Crimea in the Black Sea, and it was there that she wrote her first lyrics and songs in the Crimean Tatar language. By the time Zarema was eight years old, she had begun studying piano and from age 9 until she graduated from high school, she studied piano, violin, solfeggio, and chorus. Many of her song lyrics were inspired by the tormented Crimean Tatar history, and her patriotism and strong affinity for her cultural homeland of Crimea. For several years, Zarema was enlisted to read her lyrics at the annual commemorative ceremony at the grave of the legendary Crimean Tatar poet, Eshref Shemyi-zade,\\"–≠—à—Ä–µ—Ñ –®–µ–º—å–∏-–∑–∞–¥–µ\\", Eshref Shemyi-zade. who in 1978 had been laid to rest in a cemetery near her hometown. At age 10, Zarema gave her first radio interview and at age 11 she submitted some of her lyrics to Crimea's biggest newspaper, Dostluk and the lyrics were subsequently published in the paper. Shortly thereafter, Zarema was paid a visit at her family home by representatives of Dostluk. It was they who recommended that Zarema attend the Artek Children's Camp in Hurzuf, Crimea and sponsored her attendance there that Summer. Her lyrics were also later published in various other Crimean newspapers and magazines. Throughout her childhood, Zarema performed in the town hall in her hometown as the lead singer of the band, both for routine performances and for holidays and special occasions. She often organized and produced neighborhood music performances, as well. At age 13, Zarema produced her first video of her original song, \\"Ayi-Dag\\" and it was played on Crimean television station, –ö—Ä—ã–º (National Television and Radio). Zarema was participating in regional and national music competitions and festivals by age 15http://www.mailce.com/zarema-kimdir.html and as a young adult, Zarema moved to Kiev, Ukraine to attend university. Later, she was invited back to Artek to sing her original music, performing in front of the President of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma.  Education and Career  Zarema attended the National University of Theatre, Film and Television in Kiev, Ukraine, where she studied acting for dramatic theatre and film, graduating with a bachelor's degree. The following year, Zarema met renowned Ukrainian music producer, Mikhail Nekrasov, and collaborated with him to co- write the songs, \\"Savash\\" and \\"Hop Soyle\\". Written in Turkish, both of these songs achieved critical acclaim and were played extensively on radio stations, music channels and nightclubs in many countries throughout Europe, Asia, Canada and Israel. She gave live performances on various radio stations and TV programs. The success of \\"Savash\\" and \\"Hop Soyle\\" drew the attention of Sony BMG Music Entertainment Turkey and she ultimately signed a recording contract with Sony to record her debut Turkish album. Writing her own music and lyrics, Zarema collaborated with the legendary Turkish producer, Ozan Colakoglu and his production company, Sarƒ± Ev (Yellow House), and also Mustafa Ceceli, √ñzg√ºr Buldum, and other well-known Turkish producers to produce and promote her self-titled debut album. Zarema shot a music video for Atak, one of the songs from the album, in Kiev with the well-known Ukrainian video director, Alan Badoev. The video was widely viewed and Zarema became the first ever artist in Turkey to exceed 400,000 views on Youtube. In 2008, her video became the number one video on all of the most popular music channels in Turkey, including Kral, Genc TV, Viva TV, Number One TV, and Dream TV. Zarema's music gained significant media attention and she was featured in numerous newspapers and magazines, appearing on the cover of many, including Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Vatan, Takvim, and others. In promoting her album, Zarema performed concerts in many well-known venues around the world, performing in front of 10,000 spectators in Baku, Azerbaijan and 20,000 in Moscow's Olimpijskij stadium. After touring to promote her album with Sony Music Turkey, Zarema relocated to Los Angeles[29], California and began a new phase of her life.

Life  Abdul-Wali was born in Ethiopia. His mother was Ethiopian and his father had emigrated from northern Yemen. In 1955, Abdul-Wali began his studies at the university of Cairo, where he got interested in Marxism. He was expelled from Egypt, and after a brief period in Yemen he moved to Moscow, where he learnt Russian and studied literature at the Gorky Institute. After finishing his studies in 1962, he returned to North Yemen, which just had won its independence. He was enrolled in the young country's diplomatic corps and became charg√© d'affaires first in Moscow and later in Berlin. He also had a brief spell as head of Yemen Airlines, but fell out of favour with the government and was imprisoned. He died in a never thoroughly investigated airplane crash on his way from Aden to Hadramaut in South Yemen along with a group of other ambassadors.  Works  Abdul-Wali is considered one of the forerunners of the modern Yemenite literary movement. He published three collections of short stories: al-Ard, ya Salma (\\"Our land, Salma\\", 1966), Shay‚Äô ismuhu al-hanin (\\"Something called love\\", 1972) and ‚ÄôAmmuna Salih (\\"Uncle Salih\\", 1978), as well as two novellas: Yamutun ghuraba‚Äô (\\"They Die Strangers\\") and San‚Äôa‚Äô ... madina maftuha (\\"San‚Äôa ‚Äì open city\\"). His collected works were posthumously published in 1987. The English-language collection They Die Strangers. A Novella and Stories from Yemen was published in 2001. Given his Ethiopian heritage, many of his works dealt with Yemeni immigrants and exiles and the fate of Yemeni-African marriages. His novella They Die Strangers, for example, is about a Yemeni national who opens a small shop in Addis Ababa but long has a desire to return home.

Location Gibraltar has three marinas: Marina Bay, Ocean Village Marina, and Queensway Quay Marina. Ocean Village Marina is located on Gibraltar's Westside, outside the northern end of Gibraltar Harbour, in the Bay of Gibraltar, next to the airport runway. It is adjacent to Marina Bay which is just to its north. The marina forms part of the Ocean Village Project or Ocean Village Marina Complex, often referred to as just Ocean Village. Ocean Village Marina is the former Sheppard's Marina or Sheppard's Yard.

The strategic location of the marina offers protection from moisture- laden Levanter winds. History Ocean Village Marina, Gibraltar Ocean Village Marina was formerly Sheppard's Marina, owned by H. Sheppard & Co. By 2004, the marina had been sold to Ocean Village Investments Ltd and demolition had commenced. The marina retained its original name, at least informally, for several years after the sale. The sale of Sheppard's Marina was not without controversy, as some residents of the marina were eventually evicted from their berths by the new owners. After Ocean Village Investments acquired the adjacent Marina Bay in 2006, both marinas were incorporated into Ocean Village, a resort with residential, retail, and leisure facilities. On 4 June 2012, the Ocean Village Marina hosted 161 vessels which formed the Gibraltar Diamond Jubilee Flotilla, celebrating sixty years of the Queen's reign. The flotilla took place one day after a similar event in London up the Thames. The festivities started officially with greetings from Gregory Butcher, founder of Ocean Village, and Ros Astengo, event organiser of Ocean Village. The Gibraltar Port Authority addressed those assembled on the topic of safety, and made recommendations regarding precautions which ranged from sunscreen to the distance between vessels. The flotilla departed from the marina at midday, sailing from the western side of the runway, passing Europa Point, and returning after reaching the eastern side of the runway.

Foundation Jerusalem Project Publications, 1999. 148 pp. [English], 48 pp. [Hebrew].) Since he called himself ·∫íarfati (the Frenchman), his family may have originated from France. R. Moses was the son of a famous rabbinical family in the Land of Israel and in Italy, living between the 15th century - 18th century. His last name - Bassola - shows that the family probably originated from Basel (the Latin form of the name is: Basil) in Switzerland. He served in his youth in his hometown of Pesaro as a Rabbi. In 1521 he sailed to the Land of Israel via Cyprus and Crete and toured it for a year and a half. His impressions from this visit are documented in his book Sefer , in which he describes various sites in Ottoman Palestine (partial list), such as Bar'am, Ein Zeitim, Safed, Meron, Kefar Hananiah, Akbara, Peki'in, Amuka, Gush Halav, Dalton, Huqoq, Jethro's Tomb in the Horns of Hittin, Nablus, Jerusalem, Hebron, among other places. In every place he visited, Rabbi Moses described the inhabitants of the country, the number of Jews living in each locality and their important occupations, including the burial sites of the righteous, synagogues, etc. During this period, Rabbi Moses resided in the settlement of Ein Zeitim, which had then a Jewish community of some forty families. The book became a primary source of information for Jewish life in the land of Israel and the country's attractions during those years. After returning to Italy R. Moses lived in Ancona and headed the Yeshiva there. In his later years R. Moses made Aliyah to the Land of Israel and settled in Safed, where he was in a friendly relationship with the rabbis of the city, especially with R. Moses ben Jacob Cordovero. R. Moses' son, R. Azriel ben Moses Bassola, was a known scholar, whom among his students was R. Leon of Modena.

The process of crystallization of Israeli sculpture was influenced at every stage by international sculpture. In the early period of Israeli sculpture, most of its important sculptors were immigrants to the Land of Israel, and their art was a synthesis of the influence of European sculpture with the way in which the national artistic identity developed in the Land of Israel and later in the State of Israel. Efforts toward the development of a local style of sculpture began in the late 1930s, with the creation of \\"Caananite\\" sculpture, which combined influences from European sculpture with motifs taken from the East, and particularly from Mesopotamia. These motifs were formulated in national terms and strived to present the relationship between Zionism and the soil of the homeland. In spite of the aspirations of abstract sculpture, which blossomed in Israel in the middle of the 20th century under the influence of the \\"New Horizons\\" movement and attempted to present sculpture that spoke a universal language, their art included many elements of earlier \\"Caananite\\" sculpture. In the 1970s, many new elements found their way into Israeli art and sculpture, under the influence of international conceptual art. These techniques significantly changed the definition of sculpture. In addition, these techniques facilitated the expression of political and social protest, which up to this time had been downplayed in Israeli sculpture. History Bezalel sculpture class, 1914 An attempt to find indigenous 19th-century Israeli sources for the development of \\"Israeli\\" sculpture is problematic from two points of view. First, both the artists and Jewish society in the Land of Israel were lacking the national Zionist motifs which would accompany the development of Israeli sculpture in the future. This applies, of course, also to non-Jewish artists of the same period. Second, art history research has failed to find a tradition of sculpture either among the Jewish communities of the Land of Israel or among the Arab or Christian residents of that period. In research conducted by Yitzhak Einhorn, Haviva Peled, and Yona Fischer, artistic traditions of this period were identified, which include ornamental art of a religious (Jewish and Christian) nature, which was created for pilgrims and, therefore, for both export and local needs. These objects included decorated tablets, embossed soaps, seals, etc. with motifs borrowed for the most part from the tradition of graphic art.See, Yona Fischer (Ed.), Art and Art in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1979). [In Hebrew] In his article \\"Sources of Israeli Sculpture\\"Gideon Ofrat, Sources of the Land of Israel Sculpture, 1906-1939 (Herzliya: Herzliya Museum, 1990). [In Hebrew] Gideon Ofrat identified the beginning of Israeli sculpture as the founding of the Bezalel School in 1906. At the same time, he identified a problem in trying to present a unified picture of that sculpture. The reasons were the variety of European influences on Israeli sculpture, and the relatively small number of sculptors in Israel, most of whom had worked for long periods in Europe. At the same time, even at the Bezalel ‚Äì a school of art founded by a sculptor ‚Äì sculpture was considered a lesser art, and the studies there concentrated on the art of painting and the crafts of graphic and design. Even in the \\"New Bezalel\\", founded in 1935, Sculpture did not occupy a significant place. While it is true that a department of sculpture was set up in the new school, it closed a year later, because it was viewed as a tool to help students learn three-dimensional design and not as an independent department. In its place a department of potterySee, Gideon Efrat, The New Bezalel, 1935-1955 (Jerusalem: Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, 1987) pp. 128-130. [In Hebrew] opened and flourished. There were exhibitions by individual sculptors during these years both in the Bezalel Museum and in the Tel Aviv Museum, but these were exceptions and were not indicative of the general attitude toward three- dimensional art. An ambiguous attitude toward sculpture by the artistic establishment could be felt, in various incarnations, well into the 1960s. =Early sculpture in the Land of Israel= Boris Schatz sculpts the figure of Theodor Herzl \\"Tribe of Issachar\\" by Ze'ev Raban, detail from a brass door at Bikur Cholim Hospital, Jerusalem The Awakening Judah (1925) by Abraham Melnikoff. Ramat Gan National Park, Ramat Gan The beginning of sculpture in the Land of Israel, and of Israeli art in general, is usually designated as 1906, the year of the founding of the Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts in Jerusalem by Boris Schatz. Schatz, who studied sculpture in Paris with Mark Antokolski, was already a well-known sculptor when he arrived in Jerusalem. He specialized in relief portraiture of Jewish subjects in an academic style. Schatz's work attempted to establish a new Jewish-Zionist identity He expressed this by using figures from the Bible within a framework derived from European Christian culture. His work \\"Matthew the Hasmoneum\\" (1894), for example, depicted the Jewish national hero Mattathias ben Johanan grasping a sword and with his foot on the body of a Greek soldier. This kind of representation is connected to the ideological theme of \\"The Victory of Good Over Evil\\", as expressed, for example, in the figure of Perseus in a sculpture from the 15th century.See, Alec Mishory, Behold, Gaze, and See (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 2000) pp. 53‚Äì55. [In Hebrew] Even a series of memorial plaques Schatz created for the leaders of the Jewish settlement is derived from Classical art, combined with the descriptive tradition in the spirit of the Ars Novo tradition. The influence of Classical and Renaissance art on Schatz can be seen even in the copies of sculptures he ordered for Bezalel, which he displayed in the Bezalel Museum as examples of ideal sculpture for the students in the school. These sculptures include \\"David\\" (1473‚Äì1475) and \\"Putto with a Dolphin\\" (1470) by Andrea del Verrocchio.] See, Alec Mishory, Behold, Gaze, and See (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 2000) p. 51. [In Hebrew] The studies at Bezalel tended to favor painting, drawing, and design, and as a result the amount of three-dimensional sculpture turned out there was limited. Among the few workshops which opened at the school was one in woodcarving, in which reliefs of various Zionist and Jewish leaders were produced, along with workshops in decorative design in applied art using techniques such as hammering copper into thin sheets, setting gems, etc. In 1912 a department for ivory design, which also emphasized the applied arts, was opened.Nurit Shilo- Cohen, Schatz‚Äôs Bezalel (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1983) pp. 55‚Äì68. [In Hebrew] In the course of its activities workshops were added that functioned nearly autonomously. In a memo issued in June 1924, Schatz outlined all of the major fields of activity of Bezalel, among them stone sculpture, which was founded primarily by students of the school within the framework of the \\"Jewish Legion\\" and the workshop on woodcarving.] Nurit Shilo-Cohen, Schatz‚Äôs Bezalel (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1983) p.98. [In Hebrew] Besides Schatz, there were several other artists in Jerusalem in the early days of Bezalel who were working in the field of sculpture. In 1912 Ze'ev Raban immigrated to the Land of Israel at Schatz's invitation and served as an instructor in sculpture, sheet copper work, and anatomy at Bezalel. Raban had trained in sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, and later at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, Belgium. In addition to his well-known graphic work, Raban created figurative sculptures and reliefs in the academic \\"Oriental\\" style, such as the terracotta figurine of the Biblical figures \\"Eli and Samuel\\" (1914), who are depicted as Yemenite Jews. However Raban's most important work focused on embossments for jewelry and other decorative items.About the jewelry design of Raban, see Yael Gilat, ‚ÄúThe Ben Shemen Jewelers‚Äô Community, Pioneer in the Work-at-Home Industry: From the Resurrection of the Spirit of the Botega to the Resurrection of the Guilds,‚Äù in Art and Crafts, Linkages, and Borders, edited by Nurit Canaan Kedar, (Tel Aviv: The Yolanda and David Katz Art Faculty, Tel Aviv University, 2003), 127‚Äì144. [In Hebrew] Other instructors at Bezalel also created sculptures in the realistic academic style. Eliezer Strich, for instance, created busts of people in the Jewish settlement. Another artist, Yitzhak Sirkin carved portraits in wood and in stone. The main contribution to Israel sculpture of this period can be contributed to Abraham Melnikoff, who worked outside the framework of Bezalel. Melnikoff created his first work in Israel in 1919, after he arrived in the Land of Israel during his service in the \\"Jewish Legion\\". Until the 1930s, Melnikoff produced a series of sculptures in various kinds of stone, mostly portraiture done in terracotta and stylized images carved out of stone. Among his significant works is a group of symbolic sculptures depicting the awakening of the Jewish identity, such as \\"The Awakening Judah\\" (1925), or memorial monuments to Ahad Ha'am (1928) and to Max Nordau (1928). In addition, Melnikoff presided over presentations of his works in exhibits of Artists of the Land of Israel in the Tower of David. The \\"Roaring Lion\\" monument (1928‚Äì1932) is a continuation of this trend, but this sculpture is different in the way it was perceived by the Jewish public of that period. Melnikoff himself initiated the building of the monument, and funding for the project was attained jointly by the Histadrut ha-Clalit, the Jewish National Council, and Alfred Mond (Lord Melchett). The image of the monumental lion, sculpted in granite, was influenced by primitive art combined with Mesopotamian art of the 7th and 8th centuries A.D.Haim Gamzo compared the sculpture to the image of the Assyrian lion from Khorsabad, found in the collection of the Louvre. See Haim Gamzo, The Art of Sculpture in Israel (Tel Aviv: Mikhlol Publishing House Ltd., 1946) (without page numbers). [In Hebrew] The style is expressed primarily in the anatomical design of the figure. Alexander Za√Ød monument by David Polus Aharon Meskin by Zeev Ben-Zvi The sculptors who started to produce works at the end of the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s in the Land of Israel demonstrated a wide variety of influences and styles. Among them were a few who went by the teachings of the Bezalel School, while others, who arrived after studying in Europe, brought with them the influence of early French Modernism on art, or the influence of Expressionism, especially in its German form. Among the sculptors who were Bezalel students, the works of Aaron Priver stand out. Priver arrived in the Land of Israel in 1926 and began to study sculpture with Melnikoff. His work displayed a combination of a tendency toward realism and an archaic or moderately primitive style. His feminine figures of the 1930s are designed with rounded lines and sketchy facial features. Another pupil, Nachum Gutman, better known for his paintings and drawings, traveled to Vienna in 1920, and later went to Berlin and Paris, where he studied sculpture and printmaking and produced sculptures on a small scale which show traces of expressionism and a tendency toward a \\"primitive\\" style in the depiction of its subjects. The works of David Ozeransky (Agam) continued the decorative tradition of Ze'ev Raban. Ozeransky even worked as a laborer on the sculptural decorations Raban created for the YMCA building in Jerusalem. Ozeransky's most important work of this period is \\"Ten Tribes\\" (1932) ‚Äì a group of ten square decorative tablets, which describe in symbolic terms the ten cultures associated with the history of the Land of Israel. Another work that Ozeranzky was involved in creating during this period was \\"The Lion\\" (1935) that stands atop the Generali Building in Jerusalem.see: Yael Gilat, Artists Write the Myth Again: Alexander Zaid‚Äôs Memorial and the Works That Followed in its Footsteps, Oranim Academic College Website [In Hebrew] Although he was never a student at the institution, the work of David Polus was anchored in the Jewish academism which Schatz formulated at Bezalel. Polus began to sculpt after he was a stonemason in the labor corps. His first significant work was a statue of \\"David the Shepherd\\" (1936‚Äì1938) in Ramat David. In his monumental work 1940 \\"Alexander Zeid Memorial\\", which was cast in concrete at \\"Sheik Abreik\\" and stands near the Beit She'arim National Park, Polus represents the man known as \\"The Watchman\\" as a horseman looking out over the view of the Jezreel Valley. In 1940 Polus placed at the base of the monument two tablets, in archaic- symbolic style, whose subjects were \\"the thicket\\" and \\"the shepherd.\\"Yael Gilat, Artists Write the Myth Again: Alexander Zaid‚Äôs Memorial and the Works That Followed in its Footsteps, Oranim Academic College Website [In Hebrew] While the style of the main statue is realistic, it became known for its attempt to glorify its subject and emphasize his connection with the land. In 1910 the sculptress Chana Orloff emigrated from the Land of Israel to France and began studies in the √âcole Nationale des Arts D√©coratifs. Her work, beginning with the period of her studies, emphasizes her connection to French art of the time. Particularly evident is the influence of Cubist sculpture, which moderated in her work with the passage of time. Her sculptures, mostly human images carved in stone and wood, designed as geometric spaces and flowing lines. A significant portion of her work is devoted to sculptural portraits of figures from French society.See Haim Gamzo, Chana Orloff (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1968). [In Hebrew] Her connection with the Land of Israel, Orloff preserved through an exhibition of her works in the Tel Aviv Museum.] Her museum exhibitions during those years took place in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 1935, and in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and the Haifa Museum of Art in 1949. Another sculptor who was greatly influenced by Cubism is Zeev Ben Zvi. In 1928, after his studies in Bezalel, Ben Zvi went to study in Paris. Upon his return, he served for short periods as an instructor in sculpture at Bezalel and at the \\"New Bezalel.\\" In 1932 his first exhibition was held at the Bezalel national antiquities museum, and a year later he mounted an exhibition of his works at the Tel Aviv Museum. His sculpture \\"The Pioneer\\" was displayed at the Orient Fair in Tel Aviv in 1934. In Ben Zvi's work, as in Orloff's, the language of the Cubists, the language in which he designed his sculptures, did not abandon realism and stayed within the boundaries of traditional sculpture.Haim Gamzo, The Sculptor Ben-Zvi (Tel Aviv: HaZvi Publications, 1955). [In Hebrew] The influence of French realism can also be seen in the group of Israeli artists who were influenced by the realistic trend of early twentieth-century French sculptors like Auguste Rodin, Aristide Maillol, etc. The symbolic baggage of both their content and their style showed up as well in the work of Israeli artists, such as Moses Sternschuss, Raphael Chamizer, Moshe Ziffer, Joseph Constant (Constantinovsky), and Dov Feigin, most of whom studied sculpture in France. One of this group of artists ‚Äì Batya Lishanski ‚Äì studied painting in Bezalel, and took courses in sculpture in the Parisian √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts. When she returned to Israel, she created figurative and expressive sculpture, which showed the clear influence of Rodin, who emphasized the corporeality of his sculptures. The series of monuments that Lishanski created, the first of which was \\"Labor and Defense\\" (1929), which was built over the grave of Ephraim Chisik - who died in the battle for the Hulda Farm (today, Kibbutz Hulda) - as a reflection of the Zionist utopia during that period: a combination of the redemption of the land and the defense of the homeland. The influence of German art and particularly of German expressionism can be seen in the group of artists who arrived in the Land of Israel after receiving their training in art in various German cities and in Vienna. Artists such as Jacob Brandenburg, Trude Chaim, and Lili Gompretz-Beatus, and George Leshnitzer produced figurative sculpture, primarily portraiture, designed in a style that wavered between impressionism and moderate expressionism. Among the artists of that group Rudolf (Rudi) Lehmann, who started teaching art in a studio he opened in the 1930s, stands out. Lehmann had studied sculpture and wood carving with a German named L. Feurdermeier, who specialized in animal sculptures. The figures that Lehmann created showed the influence of expressionism in the gross design of the body, which emphasized the material from which the sculpture was made and the way the sculptor worked on it. In spite of the overall appreciation of his work, Lehmann's primary importance was as a teacher of the methods of classical sculpture, in stone and wood, to a large number of Israeli artists. =Canaanite to abstract, 1939‚Äì1967= Nimrod (1939) by Itzhak Danziger The First Ones (1958) by Shoshanna Heimann \\"Messiah\\" (1966) by Amos Kenan. Tefen Sculpture Garden At the end of the 1930s, a group called \\"The Canaanites\\" ‚Äì a broad sculptural movement, primarily literary in nature ‚Äì was founded in Israel. This group tried to create a direct line between the early peoples living in the Land of Israel, in the second millennium before the Christian Era, and the Jewish people in the Land of Israel in the 20th century, at the same time striving toward the creation of a new-old culture which would separate itself from Jewish tradition. The artist most closely associated with this movement was the sculptor Itzhak Danziger, who returned to the Land of Israel in 1938 after studying art in England. The new nationalism that Danziger's \\"Canaanite\\" art suggested, a nationalism that was anti-European and full of Eastern sensuality and exoticism, reflected the attitude of many of the people living in the Jewish community in the Land of Israel. \\"The dream of Danziger's generation\\", Amos Keinan wrote after Danziger's death, was \\"to merge with the Land of Israel and with the land, to create a specific image with recognizable signs, something that is from here and is us, and imprint the stamp of that something special that is us on history.Amos Kenan, ‚ÄúGreater Israel,‚Äù Yedioth Ahronoth, 19 August 1977. [In Hebrew] Aside from nationalism, the artists created sculpture which expressed a symbolic expressionism in the spirit of British sculpture of the same period. In Tel Aviv Danziger founded a sculpture studio in the courtyard of his father's hospital, and there he critiqued and taught young sculptors such as Benjamin Tammuz, Kosso Eloul, Yehiel Shemi, Mordechai Gumpel, and others.] The Story of Israeli Art, Benjamin Tammuz, Editor (Jerusalem: Masada Publishing House, 1980), p. 134. [In Hebrew] In addition to Danziger's pupils, the studio became a gathering place for artists in other fields. In this studio Danziger created his first significant works ‚Äì \\"Nimrod\\" (1939) and \\"Shebaziya\\" (1939). From the moment it was first displayed, the statue \\"Nimrod\\" became the center of a dispute in the culture of Eretz Israel; in this sculpture Danziger presented the figure of Nimrod, the biblical hunter, as a lean youth, naked and uncircumcised, with a sword pressed close to his body, and a falcon on his shoulder. The form of the statue was reminiscent of the primitive art of the Assyrian, Egyptian, and Greek cultures, and similar in spirit to European sculpture of this period. In its form the statue displayed a unique combination of homoerotic beauty and pagan idol worship. This combination was at the center of the criticism of the religious community in the Jewish settlement. At the same time other voices declared it the model for the 'new Jewish man'. In 1942 an article appeared in the newspaper \\"HaBoker\\" declaring that \\"Nimrod is not just a sculpture, it is the flesh of our flesh, the spirit of our spirit. It is a milestone and a monument. It is the epitome of ingenuity and daring, of monumentality, of the youthful rebellion that characterizes an entire generation...Nimrod will be forever young.\\"Cited in: Sara Breitberg Semel, ‚ÄúAgripas vs. Nimrod,‚Äù Kav, No. 9 (1999). [In Hebrew] The first showing of the sculpture in the \\"General Exhibition of the Young People of Eretz Israel\\", in Habima Theatre in May, 1942] This exhibition is dated according to Gamzo‚Äôs critique, which was published on May 2, 1944. engendered the persistent argument over the \\"Canaanite\\" movement. Because of the exhibition, Yonatan Ratosh, founder of the movement, got in touch with him and requested a meeting with him. The criticism against \\"Nimrod\\" and the Canaanites was coming not just from religious elements who, as mentioned above, protested against this representative of the pagan and the idolatrous, but also from secular critics who condemned the removal of everything \\"Jewish\\". To a large extent, \\"Nimrod\\" ended up in the middle of a dispute that had been started long before. In spite of the fact that Danziger later expressed doubts about \\"Nimrod\\" as a model for Israeli culture, many other artists adopted the Canaanite approach to sculpture. Images of idols and figures in the \\"primitive\\" style showed up in Israeli art until the 1970s. In addition, the influence of this group can be seen to a significant degree in the work of the \\"New Horizons\\" group, most of whose members experimented with the Canaanite style early in their artistic careers. =\\"New Horizons\\" group= Growth (1959) by Dov Feigin. Museum of Art, Ein Harod The Burning Bush (1959) by Yitzhak Danziger Pesel Yam (1964‚Äì7) by Yehiel Shemi, Achziv beach In 1948, a movement called \\"New Horizons\\" (\\"Ofakim Hadashim\\") was founded. It identified with the values of European modernism, and particularly with abstract art. Kosso Eloul, Moshe Sternschuss, and Dov Feigin were appointed to the group of founders of the movement, and were later joined by other sculptors. The Israeli sculptors were perceived as a minority not only because of the small number of them in the movement, but primarily because of the dominance of the medium of painting in the view of the leaders of the movement, especially Joseph Zaritsky. In spite of the fact that most of the sculptures of members of the group were not \\"pure\\" abstract sculpture, they included elements of abstract art and metaphysical symbolism. Non-abstract art was perceived as old-fashioned and irrelevant. Sternschuss, for example, described the pressure that was put upon members of the group not to include figurative elements in their art. It was a long struggle that began in 1959, the year that was considered by members of the group as the year of \\"the victory of abstraction\\"Yona Fischer and Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now (Ashdod: Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 10. [In Hebrew] and reached its peak in the mid-1960s. Sternschuss even told a story about an incident in which one of the artists wanted to display a sculpture that was considerably more avante-garde than what was generally accepted. But it had a head, and because of this, one of the members of the board testified against him on this issue.On the subject of kibbutz pressure, see Gila Blass, New Horizons (Tel Aviv: Papyrus and Reshefim Publishers, 1980), pp. 59‚Äì60. [In Hebrew] Gideon Ophrat, in his essay on the group, found a strong connection between the painting and sculpture of \\"New Horizons\\" and the art of the \\"Caananites.\\"See Gideon Ophrat, ‚ÄúThe Secret Canaanism in ‚ÄòNew Horizons‚Äô,‚Äù Art Visits [Bikurei omanut], 2005. In spite of the \\"international\\" hue of the artistic forms that the members of the group exhibited, many of their works showed a mythological depiction of the Israeli landscape. In December 1962, for example, Kosso Eloul organized an international symposium on sculpture in Mitzpe Ramon. This event served as an example of the growing interest of the sculptures in the Israeli landscape, and in particular in the desolate desert landscape. The landscape was perceived, on the one hand, as the basis for the thought processes for creating many monuments and memorial sculptures. Yona Fisher speculated, in his research on art in the 1960s, that the interest of sculptors in the \\"magic of the desert\\" arose not just from a romantic yearning for nature, but also from an attempt to inculcate in Israel an environment of \\"Culture\\" rather than \\"Civilization\\".] Yona Fischer and Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now (Ashdod: Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), pp. 30‚Äì31. [In Hebrew] The test with regard to the works of each member of the group lay in the different way he dealt with abstraction and with landscape. The crystallization of the abstract nature of Dov Feigin's sculpture, was part of a process of an artistic search that was influenced by international sculpture, particularly that of Julio Gonz√°lez, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, and Alexander Calder. The most important artistic change took place in 1956, when Feigin changed over to metal (iron) sculpture.See: L. Orgad, Dov Feigin (Tel Aviv: The Kibbutz HaMeuhad [The United Kibbutz], 1988), pp. 17‚Äì19. [In Hebrew] His works from this year onward, such as \\"Bird\\" and \\"Flight\\" were constructed by welding together strips of iron which were placed in compositions full of dynamism and movement. The transition from linear sculpture to planar sculpture, using cut and bent copper or iron, was a process of natural development for Feigin, who was influenced by the works of Pablo Picasso done using a similar technique. In contrast to Feigin, Moshe Sternschuss shows a more gradual development in his move toward abstraction. After finishing his studies at Bezalel, Sternschuss went to study in Paris. In 1934 he returned to Tel Aviv and was among the founders of the Avni Institute ofArt and Design. Sternschuss' sculptures during that period displayed an academic modernism, although they were lacking the Zionist features present in art of the Bezalel School. Beginning in the middle of the 1940s, his human figures displayed a marked tendency toward abstraction, as well as a growing use of geometric forms. One of the first of these sculptures was \\"Dance\\" (1944), which was displayed in an exhibition next to \\"Nimrod\\" in this year. Actually, Sternschuss' work never became completely abstract, but continued to deal with the human figure by non-figurative means.See: Irit Hadar, Moses Sternschuss (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2001). [In Hebrew] When Itzhak Danziger returned to Israel in 1955, he joined \\"New Horizons\\" and began making metal sculptures. The style of the sculptures he developed was influenced by constructivist art, which was expressed in its abstract forms. Nonetheless, much of the subject matter of his sculptures was clearly local, as in sculptures with names associated with the Bible, such as \\"Horns of Hattin\\" (1956), the place of Saladin's victory over the crusaders in 1187, and The Burning Bush (1957), or with places in Israel, such as \\"Ein Gedi\\" (1950s), \\"Sheep of the Negev\\" (1963), etc. To a considerable extent this combination characterized the works of many of the artists of the movement.] A similar analysis of the narrative of Israeli sculpture appears in Gideon Ophrat‚Äôs article, ‚ÄúThe Secret Canaanism‚Äù in ‚ÄòNew Horizons‚Äô,‚Äù Studio, No. 2 (August, 1989). [In Hebrew] The article appears also in his book, With Their Backs to the Sea: Images of Place in Israeli Art and Literature, Israeli Art (Israeli Art Publishing House, 1990), pp. 322‚Äì330. Yechiel Shemi, also one of Danziger's pupils, moved to metal sculpture in 1955 for a practical reason. This move facilitated the move to abstraction in his work. His works, which made use of the technique of soldering, welding, and hammering into thin strips, was one of the first sculptors from this group that worked with these techniques.26 In works such as \\"Mythos\\" (1956) Shemi's connection with the \\"Caananite\\" art from which he developed can still be seen, but soon after he eliminated all identifiable signs of figurative art from his work. Israeli-born Ruth Tzarfati studied sculpture in Avni's studio with Moses Sternschuss, who became her husband. In spite of the stylistic and social closeness between Zarfati and the \\"New Horizons\\" artists, her sculpture shows overtones that are independent from the rest of the members of the group. This is expressed primarily in her display of figurative sculpture with curved lines. Her sculpture \\"She Sits\\" (1953), depicts an unidentified female figure, using lines characteristics of European expressive sculpture, such as the sculpture of Henry Moore. Another group of sculpture, \\"Baby Girl\\" (1959) shows a group of children and babies designed as dolls in grotesque expressive poses. David Palombo (1920 ‚Äì 1966) realised a number of powerful, abstract iron sculptures before his early death.David Palombo, on the Knesset website, accessed 16 October 2019 Palombo's sculptures from the 1960s can be considered to express Holocaust memories through \\"the sculptural aesthetics of fire\\". =Sculpture of protest= He Walked through the Fields (1967) by Yigal Tumarkin In the early 1960s, American influences, particularly abstract expressionism, pop art, and somewhat later, conceptual art, began to appear in Israeli art. In addition to new artistic forms, pop art and conceptual art brought with them a direct connection to the political and social realities of the time. In contrast, the central trend in Israeli art was towards a preoccupation with the personal and the artistic, ignoring to a large extent a discussion of the Israeli political landscape. Artists who concerned themselves with social or Jewish issues were looked on by the artistic establishment as anarchists.See: Yona Fischer and Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now (Ashdod: Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 76. [In Hebrew] One of the first artists whose works expressed not only international artistic influences, but also the tendency to deal with current political issues, was Yigal Tumarkin, who returned to Israel in 1961, at the encouragement of Yona Fischer and Sam Dubiner, from East Berlin, where he had been the set manager of the Berliner Ensemble theater company, under the direction of Berthold Brecht.Igael Tumarkin, ‚ÄúDanziger in the Eyes of Igael Tumarkin,‚Äù Studio, No. 76 (October‚ÄìNovember 1996), pp. 21‚Äì23. [In Hebrew] His early sculptures were created as expressive assemblages, put together from parts of various kinds of weapons. His sculpture \\"Take Me Under Your Wings\\"(1964‚Äì65), for example, Tumarkin created a sort of steel casing with rifle barrels sticking out of it. The mixture that we see in this sculpture of the nationalistic dimension and the lyric, and even erotic, dimension, was to become a striking element in Tumarkin's political art in the 1970s.Ginton, Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), p. 28. [In Hebrew] A similar approach can be seen in his famous sculpture \\"He Walked in the Fields\\" (1967) (the same name as Moshe Shamir's famous story), which protested against the image of the \\"mythological Sabra\\"; Tumarkin strips off his \\"skin\\" and exposes his torn innards from which weapons and ammunition protrude and his stomach, which contains a round bomb that looks suspiciously like a uterus. During the 1970s Tumarkin's art evolved to include new materials influenced by \\"Land art,\\" such as dirt, tree branches, and pieces of cloth. In this way, Tumarkin sought to sharpen the focus of his political protest against what he saw as the one-sided approach of Israeli society toward the Arab-Israeli conflict. After the Six-Day War Israeli art began to demonstrate other expressions of protest than those of Tumarkin. At the same time, these works did not look like conventional works of sculpture, made of wood or metal. The main reason for this was the influence of various kinds of avant-garde art, which developed for the most part in the United States and influenced young Israeli artists. The spirit of this influence could be seen in a tendency toward active artistic works that blurred both the boundaries between the different fields of art and the separation of the artist from social and political life. The sculpture of this period was no longer perceived as an independent artistic object, but rather as an inherent expression of physical and social space. =Landscape sculpture in conceptual art= Another aspect of these trends was the growing interest in the boundless Israeli landscape. These works were influenced by Land Art and a combination of the dialectical relationship between the \\"Israeli\\" landscape and the \\"Eastern\\" landscape. In many works with ritualistic and metaphysical traits, the development or direct influence of the Canaanite artists or sculptors can be seen, along with the abstraction of \\"New Horizons\\", in the various relationships with the landscape. One of the first projects in Israel under the banner of conceptual art was carried out by Joshua Neustein. In 1970 Neustein, collaborated with Georgette Batlle and Gerry Marx on \\"Jerusalem River Project\\". For this project speakers installed across a desert valley played looped sounds of a river in East Jerusalem, in the foothills of Abu Tor and Saint Claire's Convent, and all the way to the Kidron Valley. This imaginary river not only created an extraterritorial museum atmosphere, but also hinted in an ironic way at the feeling of messianic redemption after the Six Day War, in the spirit of the Book of Ezekiel (Chapter 47) and the Book of Zechariah (Chapter 14).Ginton, Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 32‚Äì36. [In Hebrew] Yitzhak Danziger, whose works had begun portraying the local landscape several years earlier, expressed the conceptual aspect in a style he developed as a distinctive Israeli variation of Land Art. Danziger felt that there was a need for reconciliation and improvement in the damaged relationship between man and his environment. This belief led him to plan projects which combined the rehabilitation of sites with ecology and culture. In 1971, Danziger presented his project \\"Hanging Nature\\", in a collaborative project in The Israel Museum. The work was composed of hanging fabric on which was a mixture of colors, plastic emulsion, cellulose fibers, and chemical fertilizer, on which Danziger was growing grass using a system of artificial light and irrigation. Next to the fabric, slides showing the destruction of nature by modern industrialization were screened. The exhibition requested the creation of an ecology unity, which would exist as \\"art\\" and as \\"nature\\" simultaneously.Yona Fischer , in: Itzhak Danziger, Place (Tel Aviv: Ha Kibbutz HaMeuhad Publishing House, 1982. (The article is untitled and preceded by the following quotation: ‚ÄúArt precedes science.‚Äù The pages in the book are unnumbered). [In Hebrew] The \\"repair\\" of the landscape as an artistic event was developed by Danziger in his project \\"The Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry\\", on the northern slopes of Mount Carmel. This project was created as a collaboration between Danziger, Zeev Naveh the ecologist, and Joseph Morin the soil researcher. In this project, which was never finished, they attempted to create, using various technological and ecological means, a new environment among the fragments of stone left in the quarry. \\"Nature should not be returned to its natural state,\\" Danziger contended. \\"A system needs to be found to re-use the nature which has been created as material for an entirely new concept.\\"From \\"Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry, Israel Museum, 1972, \\" in: Yona Fischer, in Itzhak Danziger, Place (Tel Aviv: Ha Kibbutz HaMeuhad Publishing House, 1982. [In Hebrew] After the first stage of the project, the attempt at rehabilitation was put on display in 1972 in an exhibit at the Israel Museum. In 1973 Danziger began to collect material for a book that would document his work. Within the framework of the preparation for the book, he documented places of archaeological and contemporary ritual in Israel, places which had become the sources of inspiration for his work. The book, Makom (in Hebrew - place), was published in 1982, after Danziger's death, and presented photographs of these places along with Danziger's sculptures, exercises in design, sketches of his works and ecological ideas, displayed as \\"sculpture\\" with the values of abstract art, such as collecting rainwater, etc. One of the places documented in the book is Bustan Hayat [could not confirm English spelling-sl ] at Nachal Siach in Haifa, which was built by Aziz Hayat in 1936. Within the framework of classes he gave at the Technion, Danziger conducted experiments in design with his students, involving them also with the care and upkeep of the Bustan. In 1977 a planting ceremony was conducted in the Golan Heights for 350 Oak saplings, being planted as a memorial to the fallen soldiers of the Egoz Unit. Danziger, who was serving as a judge in \\"the competition for the planning and implementation of the memorial to the Northern Commando Unit,\\" suggested that instead of a memorial sculpture, they put their emphasis on the landscape itself, and on a site that would be different from the usual memorial. ‚ÄùWe felt that any vertical structure, even the most impressive, could not compete with the mountain range itself. When we started climbing up to the site, we discovered that the rocks, that looked from a distance like texture, had a personality all of their own up close.\\"Itzhak Danziger, The Project for the Memorial to the Fallen Soldiers of the Egoz Commando Unit. [In Hebrew] This perception derived from research in Bedouin and Palestinian ritual sites in the Land of Israel, sites in which the trees serve both as a symbol next to the graves of saints and as a ritual focus, \\"on which they hang colorful shiny blue and green fabrics from the oaks [...] People go out to hang these fabrics because of a spiritual need, they go out to make a wish.\\"] Amnon Barzel, ‚ÄúLandscape as an Artistic Creation‚Äù (Interview with Itzhak Danziger), Haaretz (July 27, 1977). [In Hebrew] In 1972 group of young artists who were in touch with Danziger and influenced by his ideas created a group of activities that became known as \\"Metzer-Messer\\" in the area between Kibbutz Metzer and the Arab village Meiser in the north west section of the Shomron. Micha Ullman, with the help of youth from both the kibbutz and the village, dug a hole in each of the communities and implemented an exchange of symbolic red soil between them. Moshe Gershuni called a meeting of the kibbutz members and handed out the soil of Kibbutz Metzer to them there, and Avital Geva created in the area between the two communities an improvised library of books recycled from Amnir Recycling Industries.See: Ginton Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 88‚Äì89. [In Hebrew] Another artist influenced by Danziger's ideas was Yigal Tumarkin, who at the end of the 1970s, created a series of works entitled, \\"Definitions of Olive Trees and Oaks,\\" in which he created temporary sculpture around trees. Like Danziger, Tumarkin also related in these works to the life forms of popular culture, particularly in Arab and Bedouin villages, and created from them a sort of artistic-morphological language, using \\"impoverished\\" bricolage methods. Some of the works related not only to coexistence and peace, but also to the larger Israeli political picture. In works such as \\"Earth Crucifixion\\" (1981) and \\"Bedouin Crucifixion\\" (1982), Tumarkin referred to the ejection of Palestinians and Bedouins from their lands, and created \\"crucifixion pillars\\" for these lands.Yigal Zalmona, Onward: The East in Israeli Art (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1998), pp. 82‚Äì83. For documentation of much of Danziger‚Äôs sculptural activity, see Igael Tumarkin, Trees, Stones, and Fabrics in the Wind (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishing House, 1981. [In Hebrew] Another group that operated in a similar spirit, while at the same time emphasizing Jewish metaphysics, was the group known as the \\"Leviathians,\\" presided over by Avraham Ofek, Michail Grobman, and Shmuel Ackerman. The group combined conceptual art and \\"land art\\" with Jewish symbolism. Of the three of them, Avraham Ofek had the deepest interest in sculpture and its relationship to religious symbolism and images. In one series of his works Ofek used mirrors to project Hebrew letters, words with religious or cabbalistic significance, and other images onto soil or man-made structures. In his work \\"Letters of Light\\" (1979), for example, the letters were projected onto people and fabrics and the soil of the Judean Desert. In another work Ofek screened the words \\"America,\\" \\"Africa,\\" and \\"Green card\\" on the walls of the Tel Hai courtyard during a symposium on sculpture.] See: The Story of Israeli Art, Benjamin Tammuz, Editor (Jerusalem: Masada Publishing House, 1980), pp. 238‚Äì240. Also Gideon Efrat, Abraham Ofek House (Kibbutz Ein Harod, Haim Atar Museum of Art, 1986), primarily pp. 136‚Äì148. [In Hebrew] =Abstract sculpture= Uprise (1967‚Äì1976) by Menashe Kadishman White Square (1989) by Dani Karavan Dead Sea Sculpture (1986) by Buky Schwartz At the beginning of the 1960s Menashe Kadishman arrived on the scene of abstract sculpture while he was studying in London. The artistic style he developed in those years was heavily influenced by English art of this period, such as the works of Anthony Caro, who was one of his teachers. At the same time his work was permeated by the relationship between landscape and ritual objects, like Danziger and other Israeli sculptors. During his stay in Europe, Kadishman created a number of totemic images of people, gates, and altars of a talismanic and primitive nature.] Pierre Restany, Kadishman (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1996), pp. 43-48. [In Hebrew] Some of these works, such as \\"Suspense\\" (1966), or \\"Uprise\\" (1967‚Äì1976), developed into pure geometric figures. At the end of this decade, in works such as \\"Aqueduct\\" (1968‚Äì1970) or \\"Segments\\" (1969), Kadishman combined pieces of glass separating chunks of stone with a tension of form between the different parts of the sculpture. With his return to Israel at the beginning of the 1970s, Kadishman began to create works that were clearly in the spirit of \\"Land Art.\\" One of his main projects was carried out in 1972. In the framework of this project Kadishman painted a square in yellow organic paint on the land of the Monastery of the Cross, in the Valley of the Cross at the foot of the Israel Museum. The work became known as a \\"monument of global nature, in which the landscape depicted by it is both the subject and the object of the creative process.\\"Pierre Restany, Kadishman (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1996), p. 127. [In Hebrew] Other Israeli artists also created abstract sculptures charged with symbolism. The sculptures of Michael Gross created an abstraction of the Israeli landscape, while those of Yaacov Agam contained a Jewish theological aspect. His work was also innovative in its attempt to create kinetic art. Works of his such as \\"18 Degrees\\" (1971) not only eroded the boundary between the work and the viewer of the work but also exhorted the viewer to look at the work actively. Symbolism of a different kind can be seen in the work of Dani Karavan. The outdoor sculptures that Karavan created, from \\"Monument to the Negev Brigade\\" (1963-1968) to \\"White Square\\" (1989) utilized avant-garde European art to create a symbolic abstraction of the Israeli landscape. In Karavan's use of the techniques of modernist, and primarily brutalist, architecture, as in his museum installations, Karavan created a sort of alternative environment to landscapes, redesigning it as a utopia, or as a call for a dialogue with these landscapes.See: Ruti Director, ‚ÄúWhen Politics Becomes Kitsch,‚Äù Studio, no. 92 (April 1998), pp. 28‚Äì33. Micha Ullman continued and developed the concept of nature and the structure of the excavations he carried out on systems of underground structures formulated according to a minimalist aesthetic. These structures, like the work \\"Third Watch\\" (1980), which are presented as defense trenches made of dirt, are also presented as the place which housed the beginning of permanent human existence.See: Amnon Barzel, Israel: The 1980 Biennale (Jerusalem: Ministry of Education, 1980). [In Hebrew] Buky Schwartz absorbed concepts from conceptual art, primarily of the American variety, during the period that he lived in New York City. Schwartz's work dealt with the way the relationship between the viewer and the work of art is constructed and deconstructed. In the video art film \\"Video Structures\\" (1978-1980) Schwartz demonstrated the dismantling of the geometric illusion using optical methods, that is, marking an illusory form in space and then dismantling this illusion when the human body is interposed.See: Video Zero: Written on the Body ‚Äì A Live Transmission, the Screened Image ‚Äì the First Decade, edited by Ilana Tannenbaum (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2006), p. 48, pp. 70‚Äì71. [In Hebrew] In sculptures such as \\"Levitation\\" (1976) or \\"Reflection Triangle\\" (1980), Schwartz dismantled the serious geometry of his sculptures by inserting mirrors that produced the illusion that they were floating in the air, similarly to Kadishman's works in glass. =Representative sculpture of the 1970s= Performance art began to develop in the United States in the 1960s, trickling into Israeli art towards the end of that decade under the auspices of the \\"Ten Plus\\" group, led by Raffi Lavie and the \\"Third Eye\\" group, under the leadership of Jacques Cathmore.See: Video Zero: Written on the Body -- A Live Transmission, the Screened Image ‚Äì the First Decade, edited by Ilana Tannenbaum (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2006) pp. 35‚Äì36. [In Hebrew] A large number of sculptors took advantage of the possibilities that the techniques of Performance Art opened for them with regard to a critical examination of the space around them. In spite of the fact that many works renounced the need for genuine physical expression, nevertheless the examination they carry out shows the clear way in which the artists related to physical space from the point of view of social, political, and gender issues. Pinchas Cohen Gan during those years created a number of displays of a political nature. In his work \\"Touching the Border\\" (January 7, 1974) iron missiles, with Israeli demographic information written on them, were sent to Israel's border. The missiles were buried at the spot where the Israelis carrying them were arrested. In \\"Performance in a Refugees Camp in Jericho\\", which took place on February 10, 1974 in the northeast section of the city of Jericho near Khirbat al-Mafjar (Hisham's Palace), Cohen created a link between his personal experience as an immigrant and the experience of the Palestinian immigrant, by building a tent and a structure that looked like the sail of a boat, which was also made of fabric. At the same time, Cohen Gan set up a conversation about \\"Israel 25 Years Hence\\", in the year 2000, between two refugees, and accompanied by the declaration, \\"A refugee is a person who cannot return to his homeland.\\"See: Jonathan Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 142‚Äì151. [In Hebrew] Another artist, Efrat Natan, created a number of performances dealing with the dissolution of the connection between the viewer and the work of art, at the same time criticizing Israeli militarism after the Six Day War. Among her important works was \\"Head Sculpture,\\" in which Natan consulted a sort of wooden sculpture which she wore as a kind of mask on her head. Natan wore the sculpture the day after the army's annual military parade in 1973, and walked with it to various central places in Tel Aviv. The form of the mask, in the shape of the letter \\"T,\\" bore a resemblance to a cross or an airplane and restricted her field of vision.\\"See: Video Zero: Written on the Body -- A Live Transmission, the Screened Image ‚Äì the First Decade, edited by Ilana Tannenbaum (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2006), p. 43. [In Hebrew] A blend of political and artistic criticism with poetics can be seen in a number of paintings and installations that Moshe Gershuni created in the 1970s. For Gershuni, who began to be famous during these years as a conceptual sculptor, art and the definition of esthetics was perceived as parallel and inseparable from politics in Israel. Thus, in his work \\"A Gentle Hand\\" (1975‚Äì1978), Gershuni juxtaposed a newspaper article describing abuse of a Palestinian with a famous love song by Zalman Shneur (called: \\"All Her Heart She Gave Him\\" and the first words of which are \\"A gentle hand\\", sung to an Arab melody from the days of the Second Aliyah (1904‚Äì1914). Gershuni sang like a muezzin into a loudspeaker placed on the roof of the Tel Aviv Museum. In works like these the minimalist and conceptualist ethics served as a tool for criticizing Zionism and Israeli society.See: Irit Segoli, ‚ÄúMy Red is Your Dear Blood,‚Äù Studio, No. 76 (October‚ÄìNovember 1996), pp. 38‚Äì39. [In Hebrew] Exposure (Installation view), 1975 by Gideon Gechtman The works of Gideon Gechtman during this period dealt with the complex relationship between art and the life of the artist, and with the dialectic between artistic representation and real life.See: Gideon Efrat, ‚ÄúThe Heart of the Matter,‚Äù Gideon Gechtman: Works 1971-1986, Autumn 1986, unnumbered. [In Hebrew] In the exhibition \\"Exposure\\" (1975), Gechtman described the ritual of shaving his body hair in preparation for heart surgery he had undergone, and used photographed documentation like doctors' letters and x-rays which showed the artificial heart valve implanted in his body. In other works, such as \\"Brushes\\" (1974‚Äì1975), he uses hair from his head and the heads of family members and attaches it to different kinds of brushes, which he exhibits in wooden boxes, as a kind of box of ruins (a reliquary). These boxes were created according to strict minimalistic esthetic standards. Another major work of Gechtman's during this period was exhibited in the exhibition entitled \\"Open Workshop\\" (1975) at the Israel Museum. The exhibition summarized the sociopolitical \\"activity\\" known as \\"Jewish Work\\" and, within this framework,\\" Gechtman participated as a construction worker in the building of a new wing of the Museum and lived within the exhibition space. on the construction site. Gechtman also hung obituaries bearing the name \\"Jewish Work\\" and a photograph of the homes of Arab workers on the construction site. In spite of the clearly political aspects of this work, its complex relationship to the image of the artist in society is also evident. 1980s and 1990s In the 1980s, influences from the international postmodern discourse began to trickle into Israeli art. Particularly important was the influence of philosophers such as Jacques Derrida and Jean Baudrillard, who formulated the concept of the semantic and relative nature of reality in their philosophical writings. The idea that the artistic representation is composed of \\"simulacra\\", objects in which the internal relation between the signifier and the signified is not direct, created a feeling that the status of the artistic object in general, and of sculpture in particular, was being undermined. Gideon Gechtman's work expresses the transition from the conceptual approach of the 1970s to the 1980s, when new strategies were adopted that took real objects (death notices, a hospital, a child's wagon) and gradually converted them into objects of art.See: Neta Gal-Atzmon, ‚ÄúCycles of Original and Imitation: Works 1973-2003,‚Äù in Gideon Gechtman, Hedva, Gideon, and All the Rest (Tel Aviv: Association of Painters and Sculptors) (Unnumbered looseleaf folder). [In Hebrew] The real objects were recreated in various artificial materials. Death notices, for example, were made out of colored neon lights, like those used in advertisements. Other materials Gechtman used in this period were formica and imitation marble, which in themselves emphasized the artificiality of the artistic representation and its non-biographical nature. Nahum Tevet Painting Lesson, no 5, 1986 Acrylic and industrial paint on wood; found object Israel Museum collection During the 1980s, the works of a number of sculptors were known for their use of plywood. The use of this material served to emphasize the way large-scale objects were constructed, often within the tradition of do-it-yourself carpentry. The concept behind this kind of sculpture emphasized the non-heroic nature of a work of art, related to the \\"Arte Povera\\" style, which was at the height of its influence during these years. Among the most conspicuous of the artists who first used these methods is Nahum Tevet, who began his career in the 1970s as a sculptor in the minimalist and conceptual style. While in the early 1970s he used a severe, nearly monastic, style in his works, from the beginning of the 1980s he began to construct works that were more and more complex, composed of disassembled parts, built in home-based workshops. The works are described as \\"a trap configuration, which seduces the eye into penetrating the content [...] but is revealed as a false temptation that blocks the way rather than leading somewhere.\\"Sarit Shapira, One Thing at a Time (Jerusalem: Israel Museum, 2007), p. 21. [In Hebrew] The group of sculptors who called themselves \\"Drawing Lessons,\\" from the middle of the decade, and other works, such as \\"Ursa Major (with eclipse)\\" (1984) and \\"Jemmain\\" (1986) created a variety of points of view, disorder, and spatial disorientation, which \\"demonstrate the subject's loss of stability in the postmodernist world.\\"See: Nahum Tevet in the ‚ÄúCheck-Post‚Äù exhibition (Website of the Haifa Museum of Art). The sculptures of Drora Domini as well dealt with the construction and deconstruction of structures with a domestic connection. Many of them featured disassembled images of furniture. The abstract structures she built, on a relatively small scale, contained absurd connections between them. Towards the end of the decade Domini began to combine additional images in her works from compositions in the \\"ars poetica\\" style.See: Drora Dumani in the ‚ÄúCheck-Post‚Äù exhibition (Website of the Haifa Museum of Art). Another artist who created wooden structures was the sculptor Isaac Golombek. His works from the end of the decade included familiar objects reconstructed from plywood and with their natural proportions distorted. The items he produced had structures one on top of another. Itamar Levy, in his article \\"High Low Profile\\" [Rosh katan godol],See: Itamar Levy, ‚ÄúHigh Low Profile,‚Äù Studio: Journal of Art, No. 111 (February 2000), pp. 38-45. [In Hebrew] describes the relationship between the viewer and Golombek's works as an experiment in the separation of the sense of sight from the senses of touching and feeling. The bodies that Golombek describes are dismantled bodies, conducting a protest dialogue against the gaze of the viewer, who aspires to determine one unique, protected, and explainable identity for the work of art. While the form of the object represents a clear identity, the way they are made distances the usefulness of the objects and disrupts the feeling of materiality of the items. A different kind of construction can be seen in the performances of the Zik Group, which came into being in the middle of the 1980s. Within the framework of its performances, the Group built large-scale wooden sculptures and created ritualistic activities around them, combining a variety of artistic techniques. When the performance ended, they set fire to the sculpture in a public burning ceremony. In the 1990s, in addition to destruction, the group also took began to focus on the transformation of materials and did away with the public burning ceremonies.The Zik Group: Twenty Years of Work, edited by Daphna Ben-Shaul (Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 2005).

Art was not yet perceived as ideology, supporting or opposing the discourse on Israeli hegemony, but rather as the basis for a more open and pluralistic discussion of reality. In the era following the \\"political revolution\\" which resulted from the 1977 election, this was expressed in the establishment of the \\"identity discussion,\\" in which parts of society that up to now had not usually been represented in the main Israeli discourse were included. In the beginning of the 1980s expressions of the trauma of the Holocaust began to appear in Israeli society. In the works of the \\"second generation\\" there began to appear figures taken from World War II, combined with an attempt to establish a personal identity as an Israeli and as a Jew. Among the pioneering works were Moshe Gershuni's installation \\"Red Sealing/Theatre\\" (1980) and the works of Haim Maor. These expressions became more and more explicit in the 1990s. A large group of works was created by Igael Tumarkin, who combined in his monumental creations dialectical images representing the horrors of the Holocaust with the world of European culture in which it occurred. The artist Penny Yassour, for example, represented the Holocaust in a series of structures and models in which hints and quotes referring to the war appear. In the work \\"Screens\\" (1996), which was displayed at the \\"Documenta\\" exhibition, Yassour created a map of German trains in 1938 in the form of a table made out of rubber, as part of an experiment to present the memory and describe the relationship between private and public memory.] See: Galia Bar Or, ‚ÄúParodoxical Space,‚Äù Studio, No. 109 (November‚ÄìDecember 1999), pp. 45‚Äì53. [In Hebrew] The other materials Yassour used ‚Äì metal and wood that created different architectonic spaces ‚Äì produced an atmosphere of isolation and horror. Another aspect of raising the memory of the Holocaust to the public consciousness was the focus on the immigrants who came to Israel during the first decades after the founding of the State. These attempts were accompanied by a protest against the image of the Israeli \\"Sabra\\" and an emphasis on the feeling of detachment of the immigrants. The sculptor Philip Rentzer presented, in a number of works and installations, the image of the immigrant and the refugee in Israel. His works, constructed from an assemblage of various ready-made materials, show the contrast between the permanence of the domestic and the feeling of impermanence of the immigrant. In his installation \\"The Box from Nes Ziona\\" (1998), Rentzer created an Orientalist camel carrying on its back the immigrants' shack of Rentzer's family, represented by skeletons carrying ladders.See: ‚ÄúImmigrant With a Compulsion,‚Äù Ynet website: http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3476177,00.html [In Hebrew] In addition to expressions of the Holocaust, a growing expression of the motifs of Jewish art can be seen in Israeli art of the 1990s. In spite of the fact that motifs of this kind could be seen in the past in art of such artists as Arie Aroch, Moshe Castel, and Mordechai Ardon, the works of Israeli artists of the 1990s displayed a more direct relationship to the world of Jewish symbols. One of the most visible of the artists who used these motifs, Belu Simion Fainaru used Hebrew letters and other symbols as the basis for the creation of objects with metaphysical-religious significance. In his work \\"Sham\\" (\\"There\\" in Hebrew) (1996), for example, Fainaru created a closed structure, with windows in the form of the Hebrew letter Shin (◊©). In another work, he made a model of a synagogue (1997), with windows in the shape of the letters, Aleph (◊ê) to Zayin (◊ñ) - one to seven - representing the seven days of the creation of the world.David Schwarber, Ifcha Mistabra: The Culture of the Temple and Contemporary Israeli Art (Ramat Gan: Bar Ilan University), pp. 46‚Äì47. [In Hebrew] During the 1990s we also begin to see various representations of Gender and sexual motifs. Sigal Primor exhibited works that dealt with the image of women in Western culture. In an environmental sculpture she placed on Sderot Chen in Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Primor created a replica of furniture made of stainless steel. In this way, the structure points out the gap between personal, private space and public space. In many of Primor's works there is an ironic relationship to the motif of the \\"bride\\", as seen Marcel Duchamp's work, \\"The Glass Door\\". In her work \\"The Bride\\", materials such as cast iron, combined with images using other techniques such as photography, become objects of desire. In her installation \\"Dinner Dress (Tales About Dora)\\" (1997), Tamar Raban turned a dining room table four meters in diameter into a huge crinoline and she organized an installation that took place both on top of and under the dining room table. The public was invited to participate in the meal prepared by chef Tsachi Bukshester and watch what was going on under the table on monitors placed under the transparent glass dinner plates.For documentation on the installation, see: ‚ÄúDinner Dress‚Äù and the associated video on YouTube. The installation raises questions about the perceptions of memory and personal identity in a variety of ways. During the performance, Raban would tell stories about \\"Dora,\\" Raban's mother 's name, with reference to the figure \\"Dora\\" ‚Äì a nickname for Ida Bauer, one of the historic patients of Sigmund Freud. In the corner of the room was the artist Pnina Reichman, embroidering words and letters in English, such as \\"all those lost words\\" and \\"contaminated memory,\\" and counting in Yiddish.See: Levia Stern, ‚ÄúConversations About Dora,‚Äù Studio: Journal of Art, No. 91 (March 1998), pp. 34‚Äì37. [In Hebrew] The centrality of the gender discussion in the international cultural and art scene had an influence on Israeli artists. In the video art works of Hila Lulu Lin, the protest against the traditional concepts of women's sexuality stood out. In her work \\"No More Tears\\" (1994), Lulu Lin appeared passing an egg yolk back and forth between her hand and her mouth. Other artists sought not only to express in their art homoeroticism and feelings of horror and death, but also to test the social legitimacy of homosexuality and lesbianism in Israel. Among these artists the creative team of Nir Nader and Erez Harodi, and the performance artist Dan Zakheim stand out. As the world of Israeli art was exposed to the art of the rest of the world, especially from the 1990s, a striving toward the \\"total visual experience,\\"Amitai Mendelson, ‚ÄúThe Opening and Closing Spectacles: Rumblings About Art in Israel,1998-2007,‚Äù Real-time (Jerusalem: Israel Museum, 2008). [In Hebrew] expressed in large-scale installations and in the use of theatrical technologies, particularly of video art, can be seen in the works of many Israeli artists. The subject of many of these installations is a critical test of space. Among these artists can be found Ohad Meromi and Michal Rovner, who creates video installations in which human activities are converted into ornamental designs of texts. In the works of Uri Tzaig the use of video to test the activity of the viewer as a critical activity stands out. In \\"Universal Square\\" (2006), for example, Tzaig created a video art film in which two football teams compete on a field with two balls. The change in the regular rules created a variety of opportunities for the players to come up with new plays on the space of the football field. Another well-known artist who creates large-scale installations is Sigalit Landau. Landau creates expressive environments with multiple sculptures laden with political and social allegorical significance. The apocalyptic exhibitions Landau mounted, such as \\"The Country\\" (2002) or \\"Endless Solution\\" (2005), succeeded in reaching large and varied segments of the population. Commemorative sculpture Monument for the Fallen in the War of Indeependence (1949) by Dov Feigin at Rehovot Monument at Kibbuz Negba (1953) by Natan Rapoport Monument to the Holocaust (1975) by Igael Tumarkin. Rabin Square, Tel Aviv-Yafo Children's Memorial (1987) by Moshe Safdie at Yad Vashem, Jerusalem In Israel there are many memorial sculptures whose purpose is to perpetuate the memory of various events in the history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel. Since the memorial sculptures are displayed in public spaces, they tend to serve as an expression of popular art of the period. The first memorial sculpture erected in the Land of Israel was ‚ÄúThe Roaring Lion‚Äù, which Abraham Melnikoff sculpted in Tel Hai. The large proportions of the statue and the public funding that Melnikoff recruited towards its construction, was an innovation for the small Israeli art scene. From a sculptural standpoint, the statue was connected to the beginnings of the ‚ÄúCaananite‚Äù movement in art. The memorial sculptures erected in Israel up to the beginning of the 1950s, most of which were memorials for the fallen soldiers of the War of Independence, were characterized for the most part by their figurative subjects and elegiac overtones, which were aimed at the emotions of the Zionist Israeli public.See: Gideon Efrat, ‚ÄúThe Dialectic of the 1950s: Hegemony and Multiciplicity,‚Äù in: Gideon Efrat and Galia Bar Or, The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity (Kibbutz Ein Harod, Haim Atar Museum of Art, 2008), p. 18. [In Hebrew] The structure of the memorials was designed as spatial theater. The accepted model for the memorial included a wall with a wall covered in stone or marble, the back of which remained unused. On it, the names of the fallen soldiers were engraved. Alongside this was a relief of a wounded soldier or an allegorical description, such as descriptions of lions. A number of memorial sculptures were erected as the central structure on a ceremonial surface meant to be viewed from all sides.See: Avner Ben-Amos, ‚ÄúThe Theater of Memory and Death: Memorials and Ceremonies in Israel,‚Äù in Drora Dumani, Everywhere: Israeli Landscape with Memorial (Tel Aviv: Hargol, 2002). [In Hebrew] In the design of these memorial sculptures we can see significant differences among the accepted patterns of memory of that period. Hashomer Hatzair (The Youth Guard) kibbutzim, for example, erected heroic memorial sculptures, such as the sculptures erected on Kibbutz Yad Mordechai (1951) or Kibbutz Negba (1953), which were expressionist attempts to emphasize the ideological and social connections between art and the presence of public expression. Within the framework of HaKibbutz Ha‚ÄôArtzi intimate memorial sculptures were erected, such as the memorial sculpture ‚ÄúMother and Child‚Äù, which Chana Orloff erected at Kibbutz Ein Gev (1954) or Yechiel Shemi's sculpture on Kibbutz Hasolelim (1954). These sculptures emphasized the private world of the individual and tended toward the abstract.See: Galia Bar Or, ‚ÄúUniversal and International: The Art of the Kibbutz in the First Decade,‚Äù in Gideon Efrat and Galia Bar Or, The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity (Kibbutz Ein Harod, Haim Atar Museum of Art, 2008), p. 88. [In Hebrew] One of the most famous memorial sculptors during the first decades after the founding of the State of Israel was Nathan Rapoport, who immigrated to Israel in 1950, after he had already erected a memorial sculpture in the Warsaw Ghetto to the fighters of the Ghetto (1946‚Äì1948). Rapoport's many memorial sculptures, erected as memorials on government sites and on sites connected to the War of Independence, were representatives of sculptural expressionism, which took its inspiration from Neoclassicism as well. At Warsaw Ghetto Square at Yad Vashem (1971), Rapoport created a relief entitled ‚ÄúThe Last March‚Äù, which depicts a group of Jews holding a Torah scroll. To the left of this, Rapoport erected a copy of the sculpture he created for the Warsaw Ghetto. In this way, a ‚ÄúZionist narrative‚Äù of the Holocaust was created, emphasizing the heroism of the victims alongside the mourning. In contrast to the figurative art which had characterized it earlier, from the 1950s on a growing tendency towards abstraction began to appear in memorial sculpture. At the center of the ‚ÄúPilots‚Äô Memorial\\" (1950s), erected by Benjamin Tammuz and Aba Elhanani in the Independence Park in Tel Aviv-Yafo, stands an image of a bird flying above a Tel Aviv seaside cliff. The tendency toward the abstract can also be seen the work by David Palombo, who created reliefs and memorial sculptures for government institutions like the Knesset and Yad Vashem, and in many other works, such as the memorial to Shlomo Ben-Yosef that Itzhak Danziger erected in Rosh Pina. However, the epitome of this trend toward avoidance of figurative images stands our starkly in the ‚ÄúMonument to the Negev Brigade‚Äù (1963‚Äì1968) which Dani Karavan created on the outskirts of the city of Beersheva. The monument was planned as a structure made of exposed concrete occasionally adorned with elements of metaphorical significance. The structure was an attempt to create a physical connection between itself and the desert landscape in which it stands, a connection conceptualized in the way the visitor wanders and views the landscape from within the structure. A mixture of symbolism and abstraction can be found in the ‚ÄúMonument to the Holocaust and National Revival‚Äù, erected in Tel Aviv's Rabin Square (then ‚ÄúKings of Israel Square‚Äù). Igael Tumarkin, creator of the sculpture, used elements that created the symbolic form of an inverted pyramid made of metal, concrete, and glass. In spite of the fact that the glass is supposed to reflect what is happening in this urban space,Yigal Tumarkin, \\"Monument to the Holocaust and Revival\\", in Tumarkin (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishing House, 1991 (unnumbered pages) the monument didn't express the desire for the creation of a new space which would carry on a dialogue with the landscape of the ‚ÄúLand of Israel‚Äù. The pyramid sits on a triangular base, painted yellow, reminiscent of the ‚ÄúMark of Cain‚Äù. The two structures together form a Magen David. Tumarkin saw in this form ‚Äúa prison cell that has been opened and breached. An overturned pyramid, which contains within itself, imprisoned in its base, the confined and the burdensome.‚Äù] Yigal Tumarkin, \\"Monument to the Holocaust and Revival\\", in Tumarkin (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishing House, 1991 (unnumbered pages) The form of the pyramid shows up in another work of the artists as well. In a late interview with him, Tumarkin confided that the pyramid can be perceived also as the gap between ideology and its enslaved results: ‚ÄúWhat have we learned since the great pyramids were built 4200 years ago?[...] Do works of forced labor and death liberate?‚ÄùMichal K. Marcus, In the Spacious Time of Yigal Tumarkin. In the 1990s memorial sculptures began to be built in a theatrical style, abandoning the abstract. In the ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs Memorial‚Äù (1987), or the ‚ÄúYad Vashem Train Car‚Äù (1990) by Moshe Safdie, or in the Memorial to the victims of ‚ÄúThe Israeli Helicopter Disaster‚Äù (2008), alongside the use of symbolic forms, we see the trend towards the use of various techniques to intensify the emotional experience of the viewer. Characteristics Women sculptures of Lea Majaro-Mintz Attitudes toward the realistic depiction of the human body are complex. The birth of Israeli sculpture took place concurrently with the flowering of avantgarde and modernist European art, whose influence on sculpture from the 1930s to the present day is significant. In the 1940s the trend toward primitivism among local artists was dominant. With the appearance of ‚ÄúCanaanite‚Äù art we see an expression of the opposite concept of the human body, as part of the image of the landscape of ‚ÄúThe Land of Israel.‚Äù That same desolate desert landscape became a central motif in many works of art until the 1980s. With regard to materials, we see a small amount of use of stone and marble in traditional techniques of excavation and carving, and a preference for casting and welding. This phenomenon was dominant primarily in the 1950s, as a result of the popularity of the abstract sculpture of the ‚ÄúNew Horizons‚Äù group. In addition, this sculpture enabled artists to create art on a monumental scale, which was not common in Israeli art until then.

While English has been the sole official language of the country since 1990, in many areas of the country, German enjoys official status at a community level. German, a Germanic language, is especially widely used in central and southern Namibia and was until 1990 one of three official languages in what was then South West Africa, alongside Afrikaans and English, two other Germanic languages in Namibia. German is the main or mother tongue of about 30,000 Namibians, a number composed roughly equally of German Namibians as well as older black speakers of Namibian Black German and Namibians who as children grew up in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). The German Namibian newspaper Allgemeine Zeitung on its website refers to 22,000 native speakers and of several hundred thousand who know German as a second or third language. German benefits from its similarity to Afrikaans and has a prominent position in the tourism and business sectors. Many Namibian natural features, place and street names have German names. However, Germanic linguist Ulrich Ammon sees the future of German in Namibia as threatened.Stefan Fischer: Erhalt von Deutsch \\"fraglich\\". In: Allgemeine Zeitung. 13. September 2010.  History  Christ Church, Alte Feste and Reiterdenkmal The Allgemeine Zeitung is the only German-language daily newspaper in Africa and one of the highest-circulation newspapers in Namibia During the period as a German colony from 1884 to 1915 German was the only official language in German Southwest Africa, as Namibia was then known. Boers, i.e. South African whites who spoke Dutch (South African Dutch would later develop into Afrikaans) already lived in the country alongside Orlam tribes and mixed-race Reheboth Basters. South Africa took over administration of the country in 1915. However, German language privileges and education remained in place. In 1916 the Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper was founded under its original name of Der Kriegsbote. After the end of the First World War the South African attitude to the German Namibians changed, and between 1919 and 1920 about half of the Germans were transferred out of the country. In 1920 Dutch (later to be superseded by Afrikaans) and English replaced German as the official languages of the country. The German-speaking population wished German to be reinstated as an official language and in 1932 the Treaty of Cape Town encouraged South Africa to do so.\\"Nach den Bestimmungen des Vertrages von Kapstadt wird die s√ºdafrikanische Regierung aufgefordert, deutsch als dritte Amtssprache einzuf√ºhren.\\" It was hoped that this would throw a spanner in the works against South Africa annexing South West Africa into the Union of South Africa. South Africa did not officially recognise German; however, de facto German was added to Afrikaans and English as a working language of the government. Only in 1984 would German officially be added as an official language. After independence in 1990, English became the sole official language of Namibia, and German thus lost its official status, but German today continues to be used in a wide range of spheres of Namibian life. = Situation today =  Degree of use  About 31,000 Namibians speak German as a mother tongue, and several tens of thousands of Namibians, either white native speakers of English or Afrikaans or metropolitan black Namibians, speak German as a second language. German is taught in many schools, and is the medium for a daily newspaper, the Allgemeine Zeitung, as well as daily programming on the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation. Although German (and for that matter English) is not common as a mother tongue among the black population, a number of public servants especially in the tourism sector speak German to various degrees. However, there are many spheres in which the German language is not or barely present at all ‚Äî spheres with a small number of white people, especially in the north part of the country, but also in many neighbourhoods of Windhoek. Culture German is used as a medium of communication in a wide range of cultural spheres: * Churches, most notably the German-speaking Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia (GELK) * Schools (e.g. in the Deutsche H√∂here Privatschule Windhoek) * Literature (German- Namibian authors include Giselher W. Hoffmann) * Radio and television (German- language programming of the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation) * Music (e.g. artist EES) * Online media (as standard German or Namdeutsch [Namibian German] in social media, forums or online newspapers) Education In addition to 32 schools in which about 14,000 pupils learn German as a foreign language, there are about a dozen German-medium schools, including the Deutsche H√∂here Privatschule Windhoek (DHPS), German schools in Omaruru and Otjiwarongo as well as five government schools. There are several additional elementary schools, German-medium high schools and a German-medium Gymnasium in Windhoek. The University of Namibia offers German-medium programs in German studies and business administration.  Signs  Examples of multilingual signs in Namibia Signs for shops, restaurants and services are often in English and German, reflecting not only a high proportion of German-Namibian ownership but also the high number of German-speaking tourists that visit the country. However, a customer entering such as shop may well be greeted in Afrikaans; relatively fewer signs are in Afrikaans but the language retains a leading position as a spoken lingua franca in Windhoek and throughout the central and southern parts of the country. German is also found on signs for tourists, especially those to monuments and historic buildings from the German colonial period. Other signs that include German date back before 1990, when English, Afrikaans and German shared status as official languages of the country. Street names In Windhoek, Swakopmund, Keetmanshoop, Grootfontein and L√ºderitz many or most street names are German in origin, even though after 1990 many streets were renamed to honor black Namibian people, predominantly but not exclusively from the currently ruling SWAPO party. (See for example List of former Swakopmund street names). Streets named before 1990 often end in \\"Str.\\", the standard abbreviation in German for Stra√üe, and in Afrikaans for straat; streets renamed since 1990 often end in \\"St.\\", implying the English abbreviation for \\"Street\\".Stra√üe umgetauft.

Place names  German place names are especially prevalent in the south of the country Namibia contains many Afrikaans and German place names, except for in the northern part of the country Unlike other parts of the world with large German immigration and large numbers of German place names, only few places had their name changed, for example Luhonono, the former Schuckmannsburg. Alt URL Especially in the south, in the regions of Hardap and «ÅKaras, many place names are German or Afrikaans.

Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Baker included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in- charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 History After commissioning, Point Baker was initially stationed at Port Isabel, Texas where she was used for law enforcement and search and rescue operations. In late 1966 her homeport was shifted to Port Aransas, Texas. On 27 December 1966 she towed the disabled FV Sherry Ann to Port Aransas. On 15 June 1967 she towed the FV Old Man from 50 miles east southeast of Freeport, Texas to Aransas Pass, Texas following the medivac of the vessel's master by a Coast Guard helicopter.Scheina, p 72 On 10 December she towed the disabled FV Baroness from 90 miles east northeast of Port Aransas to that port. On 8 September 1968 she towed the disabled FV Gulf Star to Port Aransas.Scheina, p 72 While patrolling within the twelve mile limit in August 1975, Point Baker boarded and seized the Cuban fishing vessel E-82 for illegal fishing. The seized vessel was towed to Corpus Christi, Texas where it was impounded and the Cuban crew was turned over to Department of Justice representatives. in January 1981 she made the largest seizure of illegal drugs up to that time off the coast of Texas when she seized over 15 tons of marijuana from the hold of a fishing vessel. In 1991 she again changed homeports; this time to Sabine Pass, Texas where she remained until decommissioning. During the mass exodus of Cuban and Haitian migrants in 1994 Point Baker rescued many persons from sub-standard vessels. In August, she along with another cutter rescued 200 Cubans from a sinking vessel. During her Coast Guard career Point Baker and her crews earned three Coast Guard Unit Commendations and two Meritorious Unit Commendations. Point Baker was decommissioned 6 February 2002 and was transferred to the Coast Guard of Georgia where she was commissioned as General Mazniashvili (P211), homeported in Batumi, Georgia.

Biography He was the son of theologian and historian Philip Schaff. He prepared for college at Phillips Academy, Andover, the gymnasium at Kornthal, Germany, and at the Rugby School in England. Schaff graduated from Yale in 1873 (A.B.) and from Union Theological Seminary in 1876. In 1877, he was ordained in the Presbyterian ministry. He served as a pastor in Hastings, Nebraska from 1877-1881. He then led a congregation in Kansas City, Missouri from 1881 to 1889. After traveling in the Holy Land, Schaff was called to Jacksonville, Illinois where he was a pastor from 1890 to 1897. He then became Professor of Church History at Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio until 1903. Schaff then taught church history at Western Theological Seminary, an antecedent of Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, until 1927. Pittsburgh Theological Seminary named an annual lecture after Schaff for his service to the seminary. In 1927, Schaff began a term as Lecturer in American Church History at Union Theological Seminary. In 1910, Schaff earned a Ph.D. from the University of Geneva in Switzerland. He was a delegate to the Pan-Presbyterian Council at Aberdeen, Scotland in 1913. Schaff wrote extensively in the area of church history and co-edited the Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia. He completed the unfinished work of his father, Philip, who had begun the History of the Christian Church before his death. The young Schaff also wrote two books on the life of John Hus. David Schley Schaff played an early role in the introduction of and development of football in the United States. A graduate of the Rugby School in England, he was familiar with the game of football. In 1872, while a student at Yale, he helped organize and served as the President of the Yale Football Association and was the Captain of Yale's first intercollegiate football team, though he was unable to play in their first game because of injury.

Definition  A general PDAE is defined as: : 0 = \\\\mathbf F \\\\left( \\\\mathbf x, \\\\mathbf y, \\\\frac{\\\\partial y_i}{\\\\partial x_j}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 y_i}{\\\\partial x_j \\\\partial x_k}, \\\\ldots, \\\\mathbf z \\\\right), where: * F is a set of arbitrary functions; * x is a set of independent variables; * y is a set of dependent variables for which partial derivatives are defined; and * z is a set of dependent variables for which no partial derivatives are defined. The relationship between a PDAE and a partial differential equation (PDE) is analogous to the relationship between an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and a differential algebraic equation (DAE). PDAEs of this general form are challenging to solve. Simplified forms are studied in more detail in the literature.Wagner, Y. 2000. \\"A further index concept for linear PDAEs of hyperbolic type,\\" Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, v. 53, pp. 287‚Äì291.W.

In this physical culture is understood as ‚Äúcultural practices in which the physical body ‚Äì the way it moves, is represented, has meanings assigned to it, and is imbued with power ‚Äì is central‚Äù (Vertinsky, quoted in Silk & Andrews, 2011) Physical Cultural Studies is closely related to the fields of sport sociology, cultural studies, sociology of the body, body culture studies, queer studies and disability studies. Description =Empirical focus= PCS is predominantly concerned with studying the active body. The aim of such a focus is to problematise the taken-for-granted aspects of human movement and embodiment in such a way that makes social divisions (class, gender, ethnicity, ability, generation, sex, nation, race), and the processes that produce, reproduce and contest these divisions become visible and changeable. In this respect, we can see that the 'physical' is of central importance to PCS. Indeed, it is this empirical focus ( and subsequent breadth) that separates PCS from fields such as the sociology of sport. This is because PCS scholars take as their subjects of study - all the many and varied, more or less 'legitimate', popular and emerging, work or leisure related - forms of physical culture. areas of study include: exercise, health, dance, recreation, leisure, fitness, daily living, and work related activities. =Concern with Context= In the analysis of these activities PCS considers context and contextualisation to be vital. Indeed, how can one understand a cultural practice without reference to all the surrounding factors, flows, processes, actors and institutions with which it is articulated? For example, PCS researchers identify and seek to understand the complex political, economic, social and technological relationships in which the event occurs in order to understand physical culture as relational. =Social Change= Those in the field of physical cultural studies believe that research into, or understanding of, physical culture is of little importance if it does not make a difference in the world. Therefore, the idea of 'value free' research is not accepted in PCS. Instead, partisanship is the dominant ideal. Such a perspective is related to many aspects of PCS study that vary from 'mainstream' academia. For example, PCS is concerned with care and community in which public education is of central importance. In addition, PCS aims to be political, empowering and reflexive. Finally PCS researchers attempt to question their presupposed hierarchy over the researched. See also praxis =Methodology= PCS incorporates many methods of gathering data, oftentimes implementing a variety of methods together to create rich, contextual and multi-perspective analyses of physical culture. Such methods include ethnography, auto ethnography, contextual analysis, media analysis, discourse analysis and participant observation.

In a racing career which lasted from September 1989 to October 1990 she ran nine times and won seven races. Salsabil was one of the leading two-year-old fillies in Europe in 1989, winning two races including the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac at the Longchamp. After winning the Fred Darling Stakes on her three-year-old debut, Salsabil won both of Britain's Classic races for fillies: the 1000 Guineas over one mile at Newmarket and the Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom. She was then raced against colts and became the first filly for ninety years to win the Irish Derby at the Curragh. In autumn, Salsabil added a victory in the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp but finished unplaced when favourite for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in October. Salsabil was then retired to stud where she had success as a broodmare before dying of cancer in 1996. Background Salsabil was a bay filly with a white blaze bred in County Meath, Ireland by the Kilcarn Stud. Salsabil was one of the first champions sired by Sadler's Wells and her earnings in 1990 enabled the stallion to win the first of his thirteen sires' championships. Salsabil's dam, Flame of Tara, won the Coronation Stakes in 1983, and went on to be an extremely successful broodmare. Apart from Salsabil, she produced eleven winners including Marju, a colt who won the St. James's Palace Stakes and finished second in The Derby. As a descendant of the broodmare Aloe, Flame of Tara was related to Pebbles, Round Table, Nashwan, Go For Wand and many other successful racehorses. As a yearling, Salsabil was bought for the equivalent of $800,000 by Hamdan Al Maktoum. She was named Salsabil (Arabic ÿ≥ŸÑÿ≥ÿ®ŸäŸÑ) after a spring in the Islamic paradise. The filly was trained throughout her career by John Dunlop at Arundel, West Sussex. She was ridden in all of her races by Willie Carson. Racing career =1989: two-year-old season= Salsabil began her racing career in a six furlong maiden race at Nottingham Racecourse in September. She started 4/5 favourite and won easily by three lengths. Later that month Salsabil started at odds of 4/9 for the Jack Collier Memorial Stakes at Newbury, but after leading a furlong from the finish she was caught in the closing stages and beaten a short head by Free At Last. Eighteen days after her Newbury defeat, Salsabil was stepped up in class for the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac at Longchamp. Salsabil turned into the straight in sixth place before taking the lead and being driven out by Carson to win by two lengths from Houseproud, a filly who went on to win the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches. =1990: three-year-old season= On her first appearance as a three-year-old, Salsabil was sent to Newbury for the Fred Darling Stakes, a trial race for the 1000 Guineas. The race attracted a strong field for a Group Three race, and Salsabil started third favourite behind Dead Certain, the Cheveley Park Stakes winner and Chimes of Freedom, the winner of the Moyglare Stud Stakes. Carson positioned the filly in fifth place before moving into the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish. Salsabil drew away from her opponents to win by six lengths. Thirteen days later, Salsabil started 6/4 favourite for the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course. Her opponents included Free at Last, the filly who had inflicted her only defeat, and Heart of Joy, the unbeaten winner of the Nell Gwyn Stakes. Salsabil challenged Heart of Joy for the lead inside the final furlong and was hard ridden by Carson to win by three-quarters of a lengths. Negligent was five lengths further back in third. A month later Salsabil was moved up in distance for the one and a half mile Epsom Oaks and started 2/1 favourite, just ahead of the Irish 1000 Guineas winner In the Groove. Racing on softer ground than at Newmarket, Salsabil was restrained by Carson in the early stages before moving up to take the lead in the straight. She pulled clear of the field to win by five lengths from Game Plan, with Knight's Baroness in third and In the Groove finishing fourth. After the Oaks, Salsabil's connections took the unusual step of sending her to contest the Irish Derby against colts. Few fillies had contested the race, and none had been successful since Gallinaria in 1900. The field included Quest for Fame and Blue Stag, first and second in The Derby and Sheikh Mohammed's highly rated Belmez. Salsabil took the lead in the straight and won by three quarters of a length from the outsider Deploy, with a gap of four lengths back to Belmez, who narrowly beat Blue Stag and Quest for Fame for third. Salsabil was rested until autumn, when she returned with the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at her target. In September, she started 2/5 favourite for the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp over the Arc course and distance. Salsabil took the lead in the straight, but had to be driven out by Carson to prevail by a neck and half a length from Miss Alleged and In the Groove. On 7 October, Salsabil started favourite against twenty opponents in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, despite being given an unfavourable draw. She failed to reproduce her best form and was never in contention, finishing tenth behind Saumarez. Assessment and honours The independent Timeform organisation gave Salsabil a rating of 130.http://www.thoroughbredinternet.com/newsmore.html?Id=1262 In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Salsabil a \\"superior\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks and the thirtieth best filly or mare trained in Britain or Ireland in the 20th century. Shadwell's Salsabil Stud, near Bury St Edmunds, was named in honour of the mare. The Salsabil Stakes a Listed race for three-year-old fillies, is run at Navan Racecourse in April. Stud record Salsabil retired to become a broodmare for Shadwell Stud. In five years, she produced five foals, four of whom won races, three at Group level. Sahm, her only colt, won the Knickerbocker Handicap, Bint Salsabil won the Rockfel Stakes and Alabaq won the Premio Bagutta Memorial Sergio Cumani. In October 1996, Salsabil was euthanized after being diagnosed with cancer of the colon, and was buried at Shadwell Stud.

The show ‚Äì named Enlightenment ‚Äì had Jenny Sealey and Bradley Hemmings as its artistic directors, leading a team that included Jon Bausor as set designer and Moritz Junge as costume designer. Queen Elizabeth II officially opened the Games. The ceremony was performed in the Olympic stadium in London in front of a capacity audience of 80,000 people. Production Students from local schools who are part of the get set network were part of the under-16 cast. These include Millfields Community School in Hackney, Eastlea Community School in Newham and Trinity School in Barking and Dagenham. A total of 110 days of rehearsals took place in Dagenham. The ceremony had an adult volunteer cast of over 3,000 people, along with over 100 children and over 100 professional performers. Among the professional performers were 73 deaf and disabled performers and among the volunteers were 68 people with disabilities. In the build-up to the opening ceremony, an eight-week circus skills training programme took place at The Circus Space in Hoxton, London, and was run by 50 specialist performers. Participants included professional artists and many people who were new to the arts scene, such as soldiers undergoing rehabilitation and non-competing disabled athletes. The programme was funded by Arts Council England, and was part of the Enlightenment section, performing on a 35-metre high platform above the stadium floor. Stephen Daldry commenting on the ceremonies of London 2012 noted that \\"if Danny Boyle's [Olympics opening ceremony] was very much about two revolutions and popular culture and Kim Gavin's [Olympics closing ceremony] was very much about a symphony of British music, then what you will get from Jenny and Bradley is something very different.\\" Daldry also stated that \\"there will be an extraordinary number of disabled performers in the cast.\\" Sealey introduced Stephen Hawking as the \\"most famous disabled person alive\\" who will narrate \\"the most exquisite journey,\\" focusing on science and culture of the 18th century. As with the Olympics opening ceremony, The Tempest featured heavily and the character Miranda from the story starred in the ceremony, being the eyes for the audience. Sealey said that the character \\"sees everybody but she doesn't judge. That is fundamental to our personal and political ethos,\\" adding that it is \\"fundamental, [that] you look without judging. It's about removing those attitudinal barriers.\\" Sealey said that it was pure coincidence that she and Hemmings had chosen a line from the same play that was used by Boyle in the opening ceremony of the Olympics. \\"When we found out Danny Boyle was going to reference Shakespeare's The Tempest we burst out laughing.\\" Hemming, when comparing the Games to the Large Hadron Collider, said that the LHC \\"transforms our perception of our place in the universe in the same way that the Paralympics transforms our perception of what's possible,\\" while Sebastian Coe said that the ceremony would be a \\"great showcase of the skills and excellence of disabled artists.\\" Sealey and Hemming were determined to \\"pay tribute to the contributions that science has made to the able bodied and impaired alike.\\" The pair approached Hawking in late 2011, who was adamant that he would write his own part. Hawking commented on his role that \\"to use this stage to show the world that regardless of differences between individuals, there is something that everyone is good at, is very important.\\" Sealey and Hemming worked closely with Hawking to develop a series of messages for the ceremony and spent time with him in Cambridge; Hemming said Hawking had been \\"incredibly gratified with him giving his time.\\" Sealey said that although the ceremony has Hawking and Ian McKellen narrating, \\"what we all need to remember: don't just look down at your feet, look at the stars, be curious.\\" Officials and Guests The programme was attended by the Queen's grandson Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, David Cameron, the Prime Minister, with his wife Samantha Cameron and by London Mayor Boris Johnson. Foreign dignitaries included : * Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon * President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso * Vice President of United States Joe Biden * President of France Francois Hollande * President of Germany Joachim Gauck * President of Italy Giorgio Napolitano * Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev * Prince of Monaco Albert II * Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg Proceedings Before the ceremony at 20:12 local time a flypast by Aerobility took place. Aerobility are a British charity that trains disabled people to become pilots. =Miranda= Performers holding umbrellas fly around the stadium.The Ceremony started with a countdown featuring shots of the universe starting from Earth working outwards. Stephen Hawking then appeared on the Moon stage and talked about science and reason, which was followed with the \\"big bang\\" taking place with people holding umbrellas. Fireworks were released as the audience was cast into deepest space. The audience was brought back to modern day London as Flawless performed a street-dance on the moon stage to Rihanna's \\"Umbrella\\", as several people holding coloured umbrellas floated around the stadium. One of the performers floating around the stadium was introduced as Miranda, portrayed by Nicola Miles-Wildin. The stadium was also greeted by Prospero (Ian McKellen). Prospero encouraged Miranda to go out and be our eyes on our journey of discovery in science. Hawking meanwhile encouraged Miranda to be curious while the cast created an eye symbolising Miranda's. Three vehicles with motifs from the history of science appeared followed by a performance of \\"Principia\\" by Errollyn Wallen which featured lyrics about science. =Majesty= The Queen (centre right) and Sir Philip Craven (centre left) arrive. Queen Elizabeth II and Sir Philip Craven entered the stadium, after they were seated the Union Flag was raised and the national anthem of the United Kingdom was played. Corporal of the Horse Brophy ‚Äì The Household Cavalry Mounted Division; Lance Corporal Steane ‚Äì Nijmegen Company, Grenadier Guards; Warrant Officer Vaughan ‚Äì RM Poole; Chief Petty Officer Appleton ‚Äì HMS Raleigh; Leading Hand Campbell ‚Äì HMS Coniston; Warrant Officer Grundy ‚Äì RAF Cranwell; Sergeant Hyde ‚Äì RAF Valley; Lance Corporal O'Mahoney ‚Äì The Household Cavalry Mounted Division; marched the flag to the flag pole under the leadership of Flight Lieutenant Marsden ‚Äì RAF Halton. As they marched William Walton's \\"A Wartime Sketchbook\\" was heard. The flag was raised to the national anthem by Able Seaman Patel ‚Äì HMS King Alfred; Corporal Penman ‚Äì RAF Lossiemouth; Lance Corporal Peelo as a 430 strong choir performed the song and 12 people signed the song. Whilst the umbrellas in the centre of the stadium formed a representation of the flag. =Spirit in Motion= The Parade of Athletes then began. Teams entered in alphabetical order, according to the English language translation of their names. In accordance with tradition, the host country, Great Britain, marched into the stadium last. 165 countries were to participate in the Paralympics. However, neither Botswana nor Malawi, who were due to participate for the first time, sent their delegations. During the parade, a mix of global music was played by local DJs DJ Walde, DJ Excalibah and Goldierocks. After the parade Denise Leigh, who is blind and was the winner of Channel 4's Operatunity, sung Wallen's new piece \\"Spirit in Motion.\\" Leigh was joined by deaf actress Deepa Shastri who signed the lyrics. =Homecoming= London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games chairman Sebastian Coe and President of the International Paralympic Committee Sir Philip Craven addressed the audience. Coe welcomed the Paralympic Games home before telling the story of the precursor to the Paralympic Games in 1948. Coe said the Paralympic movement shows \\"what sport is all about, sport is about what you can do, what you can achieve, the limits you can reach, the barriers you can break, sport shows what is possible, sport refuses to take no for an answer; and everything that sport stands for we are going to see right here right now and in these Paralympic Games.\\" Coe said that his team were determined to raise the bar for the Olympics and Paralympics, and that he wanted London 2012 to be an advance for the Paralympic movement and a landmark for disability worldwide and for the progress of mankind. Coe, talking to the athletes, stated that \\"they will hear us [the crowd]\\" and added that \\"the enthusiasm for these Games is extraordinary. The crowds will be unprecedented. These will be Games to remember.\\" Coe told the world, \\"prepare to be inspired, prepare to be moved, prepare to be dazzled by the Paralympic Games of London 2012!\\" Craven said that it was the start of the biggest Paralympic Games ever and the night was a celebration of the development human spirit and the Paralympic Games coming home and of dreams becoming reality. Craven said that \\"what would happen at the Games had the energy to change each and every one of us.\\" Craven then paid tribute to Sir Ludwig Guttmann and the people who helped him in 1948 to create the first sparks of the Paralympic movement. Craven continued by paying tribute to the people who made London 2012 possible, particularly the Games Makers and the people of London, and noted that Coe's team exceeded everyone's wildest dreams with the Olympics. Craven stated that he was delighted to be joined by the President of the International Olympic Committee Jacques Rogge and his wife Anne in the stadium. Craven said that Britain had an insatiable appetite for sport and that London 2012 had done a tremendous job in making everyone feel like it was their Games, and spoke of his pride of the mascot, Mandeville, being hand-crafted by a retired steel worker from his home town of Bolton. Craven then thanked all the international sport federations who held qualifying competitions and welcomed a record 164 National Paralympic committees. Craven stated that these were the best prepared athletes ever and welcomed them to London. To the athletes, Craven stated that they \\"have some of the finest sporting stages upon which to perform\\", every step of the way cheered on by the \\"most passionate sport fans you will ever have seen or heard.\\" Continuing, he said that they would inspire many generations to come and their stories and performances will challenge people to think about themselves and others. Craven then stated that the athletes are all catalysts for change and role models for an inclusive society. Craven then asked the athletes to \\"abide by the rules and show the world why you are all proud Paralympians.\\" He added that they were there to continue the story that Guttmann started and stated that they had the \\"ability to win medals and change the world\\". Craven wished the athletes the very best of luck and reminded them to have fun. Craven \\"with honour and great pleasure\\" asked Queen Elizabeth II to officially open the Games. Once the Games were declared open, the Paralympic flag was carried into the Stadium by eight members of the Great Britain Under 22 Wheelchair Basketball team: Billy Bridge, Harry Brown, Emmanuel Filson, James MacSorley, Philip Pratt, Richard Sargent, Gregg Warburton and Joseph Williams. This was hoisted into the air as the Anthem was played. Swimmer Liz Johnson, Wheelchair rugby official Richard Allcroft, and David Hunter of the ParalympicsGB equestrian team took oaths on behalf of all the athletes, judges, and coaches, vowing to compete, judge, and coach according to the rules of their respective sport. =Brave New World= The giant umbrella in the centre of the stadium was lifted, revealing Miranda and Prospero underneath in a Library. The pair were stood on a giant book of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the umbrella became a lampshade. Elin Manahan Thomas then performed Handel's \\"Eternal Source of Light Divine\\" during which the lampshade divided into seven sections and six athletes; Robert Barrett (Athletics), Kay Forshaw (Wheelchair Tennis), Tanni Grey- Thompson (Athletics), Tony Griffin (Javelin), Ian Rose (Judo), and Marc Woods (Swimming) rose to the centre of the stadium. This was followed by Miranda reciting the \\"brave new world\\" speech from The Tempest. =Navigation= Miranda was sent on a voyage by Prospero in a boat created by an upturned umbrella. Whilst she is travelling, the books symbolise seagulls as the weather turns. Miranda was caught in a storm of ideas as words from The Universal Declaration of Human Rights appear on the pixel screen, as Ziya Azazi, a contemporary whirling dervish dancer, becomes the eye of the storm on top of the orrery. Birdy sang \\"Bird Gerhl\\" as the sway pole dancers signed the lyrics and David Toole did a contemporary dance. Toole and Miranda flew across the stadium, with Miranda arriving back on the book stage. =Gravity= A Mass of giant apples entered the stadium and circled the book stage, creating a maze. Performers juggled as a giant golden apple flew across the stadium. During the section Miranda learned of Isaac Newton and his work of gravity and of the solar system, as apples floated and orbited the stage, Propero is at a telescope, and three performers created a giant Newton's cradle. Also in this section Miranda led the stadium in the big crunch. =Collision= Prospero at the telescope explained the journey that Miranda had been on. He concluded that Miranda was ready for the next step to change the world. The stadium was transported back to 2012 and became a large replica of the Large Hadron Collider; Stephen Hawking, reappearing, explained that the Collider can change our perceptions of the world just like the Games themselves. =Empowerment= Alison Lapper Pregnant in the middle of the stadium as the cast form the agitos during \\"I Am What I Am\\". Orbital then performed \\"Where Is It Going?\\" as protesters with placards entered to call for equal rights. Ian Dury's \\"Spasticus Autisticus\\" was performed by Graeae Theatre Company, whilst Orbital continued to perform behind Hawking. Miranda and Propero protested as a giant version of Marc Quinn's statue Alison Lapper Pregnant arrived in the middle of the stadium. Miranda rose to break the glass as shattered pieces are seen on the pixels. =Enlightenment= A film showing the journey of the Paralympic torch to the stadium began the section. Hawking put the Paralympic Games into the wider context of society. Royal Marine Commando Joe Townsend, who hoped to compete in Rio (he went on to compete in paratriathlon), followed by zip wiring into the Olympic Stadium from the ArcelorMittal Orbit carrying the Paralympic torch. Fireworks signified his arrival as he handed it to Dave Clark, member of the 2012 blind 5-a-side football team. Clark then ran to the cauldron where he passed it to Margaret Maughan, Britain's first Gold medallist in the Paralympic Games, who lit the petals which rose to form the cauldron. =\\"I Am What I Am\\"= Beverley Knight, Lizzie Emeh and Caroline Parker appeared on the Moon stage to close the ceremony with a performance of \\"I Am What I Am\\". A pyrotechnic display took place as the entire cast flooded the stadium to form the three agitos of the Paralympic logo. The cast and the audience joined in with the signing and signed the lyrics which were learnt pre-show. Broadcasting and reception 80,000 people watched the Ceremony in the stadium. Audience viewing figures in the United Kingdom showed that an average of 7.6 million, a 40% share, watched the ceremony. The opening ceremony was met with positive reviews. Jim White of The Daily Telegraph described the ceremony as \\"three hours of noisy, colourful, bolshie brouhaha. Plus umbrellas.\\" However, White also felt that it was also \\"a little jumbled in its rush to communicate its ideas, maybe; occasionally resembling a giant prog rock gig, for sure.\\" White also praised the ceremony's use of \\"The Tempest\\" as an overlying theme, believing that Miranda's \\"O wonder\\" speech was \\"beautifully apt\\" in the context of what fans would expect to see during the Paralympics, and that her flight upwards into a glass ceiling was the most symbolic moment of the entire ceremonysince he believed that Paralympic athletes would also be \\"smashing ceilings\\" throughout the Games. Writing in the Independent Jerome Taylor notes that the ceremony was more structured and the music more classical than the Olympic equivalent \\"but it was still infused with simmering political radicalism and social commentary.\\" Taylor also states that the Ceremony was a celebration of humankind overcoming the impossible. While Charles Perrin in the Daily Express states that after the Olympics the opening ceremony of the Paralympics \\"won the hearts and minds of the public with a truly memorable show.\\" Perrin adds that \\"there was a palpable sense of awe and wonder attached to the ceremony, especially when the athletes parade began stadium.\\"http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/342833/London-puts-on-a- stunning-Paralympics-Opening-Ceremony Charlotte Higgins of The Guardian also enjoyed the ceremony, noting that despite the lack of \\"gleeful anarchy\\" and lower budget in comparison to its Olympic equivalent, noting that the theme of enlightenment representing both \\"a hoped-for lifting of prejudice against disabled people; and the 18th-century onrush of scientific knowledge and quest for the rights of man\\", along with its embodiment through the use of Stephen Hawking were \\"brilliant strokes\\" by the directors. In conclusion, Higgins remarked that concluding that \\"the ceremony seemed to suggest, the only barrier to disabled people's fulfilling their potential was one of perception.\\" Fellow Guardian writer Owen Gibson was also positive towards the opening ceremony, stated that the creators had finally \\"found\\" dramatic use for the Olympic Park's Orbit sculpture.\\" Overall Gibson found the ceremony to be a 'thought-provoking, expectation-defying, moving and occasionally challenging romp.' Concluding \\"Just as the title of Boyle's Isles of Wonder spectacular came to sum up the giddy excitement of London's Olympics, so organisers hope that Enlightenment will come to describe the effect of the Paralympics that over the next 10 days will conclude a bounteous sporting summer.\\" Francis Ryan writing for the same paper notes that \\"it was a seismic beginning for an opening ceremony that seemed smaller than its Olympic counterpart one month ago. It seemed lower key, perhaps, with less fanfare and more poignancy than brash spectacle. But by midnight, wonder was literally flying through the air.\\" Ryan states that the ceremony \\"was beauty, a thrust of anger, and a spotlight on athletes too often in the shade.\\" Ryan notes that the ceremony was thoughtful and combined emotional and complex ideas with the mystical. Concluding Ryan notes that Miranda smashing the ceiling was fiction but \\"in a sense in the real world had made a crack.\\" Whilst Richard Williams proclaimed that the nation suffered a petite mort at the end of the Olympics took its opportunity to come back to life. Anthony Faiola, writing for The Washington Post noted that \\"the expensive theatrics and brilliant pyrotechnics Wednesday underscored just how far the event has come,\\" from the Games beginning in 1948. He also notes that the ceremony was far more sober than its Olympic counterpart but could be just as esoteric. Lawrence Downes in The New York Times noted that the ceremony was truly cosmic. Gary Kingston writing in the Vancouver Sun noted that the ceremony was equally infused with \\"whimsy and wonder.\\" He further stated that there was playful use of the umbrella during the ceremony quintessential of British objects. Kingston also comments that the appearance of Toole and the aerial ballet demonstrated that physical limitations do not limit human potential.https://vancouversun.com/sports/Photos+Paralympic+Games+open+London/7163476/story.html Channel 4, the official broadcaster of the Paralympics in the United Kingdom, faced criticism throughout the opening ceremony for its coverage; viewers complained about the quality of Jon Snow's commentary; such as bringing up too many facts pertaining to war during the parade of nations.

Harald had claimed the Danish throne since 1047, and had launched raids into Denmark ever since. With his invasion in 1062, he wanted to decisively defeat the Danes, and thus finally be able to conquer Denmark. The battle was won clearly by the Norwegians, but since many Danes managed to escape, including Sweyn, it proved indecisive in Harald's attempt to conquer Denmark. Background When Harald became the sole king of Norway in 1047, he also claimed the Danish throne, despite that his predecessor and co-ruler Magnus the Good (king of Norway and Denmark) had appointed Sweyn Estridsen as his successor in Denmark. Since 1048, Harald launched raids into Denmark almost annually, attempting to force Sweyn out of the country. Although the raids were largely successful, Harald never managed to occupy Denmark. With the invasion in 1062, he sought to gain a decisive victory over Sweyn.DeVries (1999) p. 61 The battle According to the Icelandic saga writer Snorri Sturluson, the battle had been preassigned a time and place, but Sweyn did not appear as agreed. Harald thus sent home his non-professional ships and soldiers, the \\"peasant army\\" (b√≥ndaherrin), which had made up around half of his forces. When the ships were out of sight, Sweyn finally appeared and engaged Harald's fleet. With his own so-called drekinn ship in the middle, Harald tied his ships together in order to prevent gaps in the line. He placed earl Haakon Ivarsson and his forces from Tr√∏ndelag on the flanks. Sweyn used the same tactic, but unlike Harald had his own earl Finn Arnesson placed right next to himself, instead of on the flanks. The battle commenced in the evening, and lasted through the night.DeVries (1999) pp. 61‚Äì64 The two sides were evenly matched for a long time into the battle, until Haakon disengaged his ships from the flanks and started attacking the weakened Danish ships on the flanks. Sweyn had no similar reserve force, and his fleet was defeated by dawn, with 70 ships left \\"empty\\" and the remainder retreating. While Finn Arnesson fought until he was captured, Sweyn jumped into the water and was rescued by his former ally Haakon (albeit unknowingly to Harald). Haakon was after the battle universally recognized, including by Harald, as the hero of the battle, but when his treachery in rescuing Sweyn was discovered he fell into disfavour (even though Haakon claimed Sweyn had been in disguise, and that he had not recognized it was him).DeVries (1999) pp. 64‚Äì65 Aftermath Although Harald won the battle, the victory was not decisive since many Danish ships and men had managed to escape, including Sweyn. Denmark's economic and social fabric had been destroyed by the yearly raids, but the lengthy war had also taken its toll in Norway. After the Battle of Nis√•, Harald had trouble collecting taxes in the Uplands, and probably also in other areas. In 1064, Harald finally offered Sweyn unconditional peace without reparations or loss of land, and the two kings concluded peace.DeVries (1999) pp. 65‚Äì66 References Bibliography * Nisa Category:Conflicts in 1062 Nis√• Nis√• Nis√• Category:1062 in Europe Nis√• ","title":"Battle of Nis√•"},{"id":"36713451","text":"Yaar Pardesi is a 2012 Punjabi comedy drama film directed by Gurbir Singh Grewal.

It is the fifth bridge to cross the channel there with the first being a pedestrian-only structure that was built in the nineteenth century. The bridge was planned in 1940, but World War II delayed the acceptance of bids until 1947. Construction finished in 1949 and the bridge opened to traffic in late June of that year. The bridge is part of the National Highway System. History The Pine River Channel; looking toward Lake Michigan Island Lake Outlet, also known as the Pine River Channel, was dredged in 1870 to connect Lake Michigan to Lake Charlevoix through Round Lake. A total of five bridges have crossed the channel at this location; the first was a small footbridge built in 1869. The current bridge replaced a swing truss bridge built by the city of Charlevoix in 1901. The US 31‚ÄìIsland Lake Outlet Bridge was designed by the bridge division of the Michigan State Highway Department, led by George M. Foster, and by consulting engineers Haslett and Erdal. Plans were prepared in 1940, but World War II delayed the project. In January 1947, the department announced that it would accept bids beginning February 6 for the bridge's construction. Five bids were received and the contract was awarded to the lowest bidder ($697,981) submitted by L.W. Lamb Company of Holland, Michigan, and the Luedtke Engineering Company of Frankfort, Michigan. Construction was overseen by N. F. Kinney from the state highway department and H. J. Conroy (a district bridge engineer). Fabricated steel was purchased at a cost of $270,433 from the Mt. Vernon Bridge Company of Mt. Vernon, Ohio. In late May 1947, Luedtke Engineering arrived on site with their pile driver and construction commenced. Electrical work was contracted to Lake Shore Engineering Company from Iron Mountain, Michigan. In August, a was towed from Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, to carry traffic while the new bridge was under construction. The temporary bridge was fixed to the north bank and mounted to a pontoon on the south end to permit navigation of the channel. Aerial view of downtown Charlevoix with the bridge in the center; Round Lake is at bottom- right and Pine River Channel is at top-left. By November, construction of the north pier was underway and the south pier coffer dam was being installed. By March 1948, the north pier was ready to have its two steel bascule racks installed. However, the bronze-alloy trunnions were difficult to cast and were not satisfactory until the third attempt in September. In October, bascule girders arrived, manufactured by Mt. Vernon Bridge Company. Assembly of the south leaf was completed by early November, but the north leaf was delayed by poor weather and an insufficient number of laborers worsened by the start of deer hunting season. By January 1949, the south counterweight had been poured and welding of the mesh road surface of the south leaf was underway, followed by work on the north side. Into spring, machinery was installed and finishing details completed. Plans for the transformer structure were approved in April and the bridge opened for traffic on June 27, 1949. On July 30, it was dedicated in memory of twenty-two locals who died fighting in World War II. The ribbon-cutting ceremony was performed by State Highway Commissioner Charles Ziegler. The bridge originally had standard metal panels along the sidewalks. In the early 1990s, they were replaced with new railings, but these were replaced again with metal lattice railings in the mid-1990s through the efforts of Edith Gilbert. In late 2017, a community effort was launched to light the bridge railings and walkways on either side of the channel under the bridge. The idea was developed by Paul Belding, a local resident, fisherman, and lighting engineer, shortly before his death in September 2017. After a little over a year of fundraising efforts managed by a local non-profit, Silver Linings Charlevoix, the bridge was lit with a community celebration on July 4, 2019. http://www.charlevoixbridge.org The bridge is listed on an inventory of historic bridges maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation. Design and operation Bridge opening for the Beaver Island ferry Bridge closing after the ferry has passed The steel mesh road surface is wide with sidewalks cantilevered beyond the bridge girders. Each leaf of the bascule bridge is in length for a total channel width of . Each approach is long with a concrete road surface. The leaves and approaches are supported by concrete piers resting on steel piles; the abutments are supported by pilings. The leaves are opened by electric motors and the machinery weighs about and each counterweight consists of of concrete. The operator's house is at the southeast corner of the bridge and the transformers are located to the southeast on the east bank of Round Lake. The original design included recessed barriers that would rise to block traffic from driving onto the leaves. These were abandoned and removed as part of a maintenance upgrade in the 1990s. Gates also descend and flashing lights warn oncoming traffic. When closed, there is of clearance below the bridge. The bridge opens for recreational craft on the hour and half-hour from April through October. From April through December, the bridge opens on signal between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. For the remainder of the year, the bridge opens on signal when given notice twelve hours in advance. For public and commercial vessels and vessels in distress, the bridge is opened as soon as possible. Impact Because the bridge opens regularly during the summer months, it is a major source of traffic congestion. On occasion, the bridge has also been stuck in the raised position, as happened for a little over two hours in June 2004. Additional crossings have been explored, but the highly seasonal nature of the backups and financial constraints make them impractical. Since idling cars waiting for the bridge to close result in pollution and a significant waste of fuel, June 28 to July 4, 2010, was declared \\"Idle Free Week\\" in Charlevoix.

The Royal Star & Garter Homes, the charitable trust running the home, announced in 2011 that it would be selling the building as it did not now meet modern requirements and could not be easily or economically upgraded. The building, which is Grade II listed, was sold in April 2013 for ¬£50 million to a housing developer, London Square, which has restored and converted the building into apartments. The trust opened a new 60-room home in Solihull in the West Midlands in 2008 and the remaining residents at the Richmond home moved in 2013 to a new purpose- built 63-room building in Upper Brighton Road, Surbiton, in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames. A third home has now opened in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. The possibility of opening a fourth home is also under consideration, and funds have been set aside for this purpose. History Riverside view from Twickenham bank The Royal Star and Garter Home The Bromhead Memorial, in the nearby Richmond Cemetery, commemorates deceased residents of the Home Wick House, former home for the Star and Garter Home's nurses The site is the location of the former Star and Garter Hotel, which closed in 1906. The building was used as a military hospital, known as the Star and Garter Home for Disabled Sailors and Soldiers, during World War I. The site was then donated to Queen Mary (consort of George V) in support of her plans to establish a home for paralysed and permanently disabled soldiers. The hotel banqueting hall and ballroom were temporarily used to house disabled soldiers, but they were found to be unsuitable for their specialised needs. Demolition of the hotel buildings commenced in 1919 and from 1920 to 1924 the home's residents were transferred to Sandgate, Kent while the new Star and Garter Home for Disabled Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen was built on the site of the hotel. The new building was dedicated in 1924 as the Women of the Empire's Memorial of the Great War. It was formally opened by George V and Queen Mary on 10 July 1924. In 1948 residents of the home took part in a forerunner of the Paralympic Games, the first national athletic event for disabled athletes, organised by Dr Ludwig Guttmann. The Star and Garter Home received its royal charter in 1979, adding the prefix \\"Royal\\" to its name. Since the opening of the second home at Solihull in 2008 the charity has used a plural form of the name, as \\"The Royal Star & Garter Homes\\". Some of the residents who died at the home were buried in one of two dedicated sections in the nearby Richmond Cemetery. The cemetery contains two plots dedicated to deceased residents from the home, one of which is marked by the Bromhead Memorial, a large classical- style monument listing the names of those not commemorated elsewhere. Notable residents Notable residents have included: *Frederick Jeremiah Edwards (1894‚Äì1964), an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, who died at the home on 9 March 1964 *Norman \\"Bill\\" Jewell (1913‚Äì2004), commander of the submarine during Operation Mincemeat. In 1998, he suffered a serious fall and was paralysed from the neck down. He then went to live at the home until his death on 18 August 2004 aged 90. * Major David Mills (1918‚Äì1993), Secretary General of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club 1963‚Äì1979 *Nancy Wake (1912‚Äì2011), who fought with the French Resistance and lived in the home from 2003 until her death.

He founded his movement in painting,(the cosmonitic art), in Quebec, being the first to use fiberglass. He was recognized worldwide and skirted famous names, including Walt Disney who dedicated a Mickey Mouse cartoon published in newspapers around the world.  Early life and education  Andre Fontaine was born on March 6, 1926, in St. Gedeon, a small village in the Saguenay-Lac- Saint-Jean, a region of Quebec. He studied in Lac-Saint-Jean, then he went high school at Royal Military College Road Victoria, British Columbia. He obtained master's degrees in psychology and fine arts, and a PhD in cosmology at the University of Florida. To defray his studies, he painted alongside big names such as Jackson Pollock and Jacques Fresco. He married first wife, Marie-Paule Tremblay in Alma, Quebec, in 1945. From this union he had two daughters, Helen was born October 11, 1946, and Pauline was born in 1948. The divorce was formalized in 1966.  A futurist artist  Fontaine, whose works were winning for the first time in 1953 internationally from more than 5,000 exhibits. In 1963, the American Academy of Arts and Letters awarded him a medal and a scholarship for his artworks and his research, including creating a new painting medium the \\"texmos\\". The following year, he won the gold medal of the \\"American Architectural Association\\". Then a bright future for this emerging artist who is gaining popularity and is known throughout the great capitals of the world for its unique art he created. His art is his vision of the infinite universe, a step in the future, marking the time by his modernism. Numerous exhibitions of his works are connected and major U.S. and foreign personalities buy the paintings by. The new composition of his paintings give a three-dimensional effect. In the U.S., we know it mainly by his last name \\"Fontaine\\". Thus in 1965 the famous Walt Disney immortalised Fontaine in a Mickey Mouse comic published worldwide, in which the nephew of Mickey shows that he got the autograph of the painter Fontaine, \\"the fastest in the world\\" as that 'he says. In 1966, the Wowetco, organizing artistic and cultural works takes him under contract and his works are exhibited throughout the world. Andre Fontaine, father of his art, \\"cosmonitic art\\", he created, its revolutionary medium, which he called \\"the Texmos\\" in 1963. The small little boy from Quebec has exceeded the boundaries of his country not only Canada and the United States, but he managed to make himself known in the greatest capitals of the world! And his works are in museums of contemporary art. Fontaine and his painting  International Press journalist  Fontaine worked as a freelance journalist, correspondent of the International Press Institute. He worked as a reporter for several agencies including, Radio- Canada, Pathe News, The Saturday Evening Post and International Movietone. He was sent abroad to make feature s, by being present on site during major political events of world history such as: Cuban Revolution, from the mountains of the Sierra Maestra, the crisis of Panama, Dominican civil war, the construction of the Berlin Wall, Christmas 1963, the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, the Pope's visit to the United Nations. In addition, he has reported on major launches at Cape Kennedy since it opened in 1956. He was the first Quebec journalist to be a member of La Presse to Cape Canaveral. An exceptional man who touched many areas, he was ordained by the United Church in 1964. A veteran of the World War II (1939‚Äì1945), he was wounded on active duty and released in 1947. He also made his military service, United States, National Guard dismissed: lieutenant colonel. In 1965, Serge Brousseau, famous critical to Le Journal de Montreal Andre Fontaine defined as a \\"cosmic painter\\" News \\"The Painter of the Stars\\". \\"Because of his art of avant-garde. In addition, he said, speaking of Fontaine in an article published at the time \\"you're never a prophet in his country\\", and Fontaine went into exile outside his native country to be recognized for his art and its creation. He lived several years in the United States within West Indies and Latin America. In 1966, he wanted to disclose facts about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, as certain revelations were disturbing to some people, they wanted his silence.  Between the shade and light  In 1977, Fontaine out of the shadows, after some difficult years, where he was like \\" out\\" from the living world for political reasons. He published a book co-written with Carmen Morin to tell the whole truth about the story. In 1977, began another life, very different and opens his art studio in Quebec. He had just published the book Conspiracy which, by its embarrassing revelations, was considered to index a book which was withdrawn from the market. That year, he met a young artist, Joan Doyon, who works at the studio to teach painting to children. Both artists have developed a beautiful partnership working, so the following year, 1978 he proposed a bold plan to open an art gallery together. Fountaine Art Gallery opened in Quebec on 56, rue St-Pierre. Due to the inplication artists with good causes, which offer courses to underprivileged youth, this was the first art gallery offering art classes and professionals to receive a government grant, which was led by Ren√© L√©vesque. In December 1979, Andre Fontaine married for the second time. His wife was Joan Doyon. They had a daughter, Rachel, born in September 1980. Union that lasted over 25 years until his death. During the 1980s he organized 90 exhibitions of his paintings in the regions of Quebec and also gives occasional concerts of classical singing, which sometimes for weddings or the holidays. Another facet of Fountain, is the benefactor of the holiday season, which was recovering beignets, muffins restaurant before closing in order to move the bring centers of charity for the poor. Being a man of action, he remained active in various fields in addition to his paintings: He was a speaker at academic conferences, a tenor opera singer who gave concerts in churches, guests in TV shows to talk about his art. Fontaine died on January 30, 2005, following a myocardial infarction at the Hospital Saint-Fran√ßois d'Assise in Qu√©bec.

It is the most common measure of the spatial extent of random motion, and can be thought of as measuring the portion of the system \\"explored\\" by the random walker. In the realm of biophysics and environmental engineering, the Mean Squared Displacement is measured over time to determine if a particle is spreading solely due to diffusion, or if an advective force is also contributing. Another relevant concept, the Variance- Related Diameter (VRD, which is twice the square root of MSD), is also used in studying the transportation and mixing phenomena in the realm of environmental engineering. It prominently appears in the Debye‚ÄìWaller factor (describing vibrations within the solid state) and in the Langevin equation (describing diffusion of a Brownian particle). The MSD at time t is defined as an ensemble average (statistical mechanics): :{\\\\rm MSD}\\\\equiv\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{x}(t)-\\\\mathbf{x_0}^2\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\mathbf{x^{(i)}}(t) - \\\\mathbf{x^{(i)}}(0)^2 where N is the number of particles to be averaged, vector \\\\mathbf{x^{(i)}}(0)=\\\\mathbf{x^{(i)}_0} is the reference position of the i-th particle, and vector \\\\mathbf{x^{(i)}}(t) is the position of the i-th particle at time t.Frenkel, Daan & Smit, Berend. Understanding molecular simulation: From algorithms to applications. Academic Press, 196 (2nd Ed.), p. 97. Derivation of the MSD for a Brownian particle in 1D The probability density function (PDF) for a particle in one dimension is found by solving the one-dimensional diffusion equation. (This equation states that the position probability density diffuses out over time - this is the method used by Einstein to describe a Brownian particle. Another method to describe the motion of a Brownian particle was described by Langevin, now known for its namesake as the Langevin equation.) : \\\\frac{\\\\partial p(x,t \\\\mid x_0)}{\\\\partial t}=D\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2p(x,t \\\\mid x_0)}{\\\\partial x^2}, given the initial condition p(x_{0},t={0} \\\\mid x_{0})=\\\\delta(x-x_{0}); where x(t) is the position of the particle at some given time, x_0 is the tagged particle's initial position, and D is the diffusion constant with the S.I. units m^2s^{-1} (an indirect measure of the particle's speed). The bar in the argument of the instantaneous probability refers to the conditional probability. The diffusion equation states that the speed at which the probability for finding the particle at x(t) is position dependent. The differential equation above takes the form of 1D heat equation. The one- dimensional PDF above is the Green's function of heat equation (also known as Heat kernel in mathematics): : P(x,t)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4\\\\pi Dt}}\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{4Dt}\\\\right). This states that the probability of finding the particle at x(t) is Gaussian, and the width of the Gaussian is time dependent. More specifically the full width at half maximum (FWHM)(technically/pedantically, this is actually the Full duration at half maximum as the independent variable is time) scales like : {\\\\rm FWHM}\\\\sim\\\\sqrt{t}. Using the PDF one is able to derive the average of a given function, L, at time t: : \\\\langle L(t) \\\\rangle\\\\equiv \\\\int^\\\\infty_{-\\\\infty} L(x,t) P(x,t) \\\\, dx, where the average is taken over all space (or any applicable variable). The Mean squared displacement is defined as : {\\\\rm MSD}\\\\equiv\\\\langle ( x(t)-x_0)^2\\\\rangle, expanding out the ensemble average : \\\\langle (x-x_0)^2 \\\\rangle =\\\\langle x^2\\\\rangle+x_0^2 - 2x_0\\\\langle x\\\\rangle, dropping the explicit time dependence notation for clarity. To find the MSD, one can take one of two paths: one can explicitly calculate \\\\langle x^2\\\\rangle and \\\\langle x\\\\rangle, then plug the result back into the definition of the MSD; or one could find the moment-generating function, an extremely useful, and general function when dealing with probability densities. The moment- generating function describes the k^{\\\\textrm{th}} moment of the PDF. The first moment of the displacement PDF shown above is simply the mean: \\\\langle x\\\\rangle. The second moment is given as \\\\langle x^2\\\\rangle. So then, to find the moment-generating function it is convenient to introduce the characteristic function: : G(k)=\\\\langle e^{ikx}\\\\rangle\\\\equiv \\\\int_I e^{ikx}P(x,t\\\\mid x_0) \\\\, dx, one can expand out the exponential in the above equation to give : G(k) = \\\\sum^\\\\infty_{m=0}\\\\frac{(ik)^m}{m!}\\\\mu_m. By taking the natural log of the characteristic function, a new function is produced, the cumulant generating function, : \\\\ln(G(k)) = \\\\sum^\\\\infty_{m=1}\\\\frac{(ik)^m}{m!}\\\\kappa_m, where \\\\kappa_m is the m \\\\textrm{th} cumulant of x. The first two cumulants are related to the first two moments, \\\\mu, via \\\\kappa_1 =\\\\mu_1; and \\\\kappa_2 =\\\\mu_2-\\\\mu_1^2, where the second cumulant is the so-called variance, \\\\sigma^2. With these definitions accounted for one can investigate the moments of the Brownian particle PDF, : G(k)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4\\\\pi Dt}}\\\\int_I \\\\exp(ikx)\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{4Dt}\\\\right) \\\\, dx; by completing the square and knowing the total area under a Gaussian one arrives at : G(k)=\\\\exp(ikx_0-k^2Dt). Taking the natural log, and comparing powers of ik to the cumulant generating function, the first cumulant is : \\\\kappa_1=x_0, which is as expected, namely that the mean position is the Gaussian centre. The second cumulant is : \\\\kappa_2=2Dt, \\\\, the factor 2 comes from the factorial factor in the denominator of the cumulant generating function. From this, the second moment is calculated, : \\\\mu_2=\\\\kappa_2+\\\\mu_1^2=2Dt+x_0^2. Plugging the results for the first and second moments back, one finds the MSD, : \\\\langle (x(t)-x_0)^2 \\\\rangle = 2Dt.  Derivation for n-dimensions  For a Brownian particle in higher-dimension Euclidean space, its position is represented by a vector \\\\mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n), where the Cartesian coordinates x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n are statistically independent. The n-variable probability distribution function is the product of the fundamental solutions in each variable; i.e., P(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = P(x_1,t)P(x_2,t)\\\\dots P(x_n,t)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{(4\\\\pi D t)^n}}\\\\exp \\\\left (-\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}}{4Dt} \\\\right ). The Mean squared displacement is defined as {\\\\rm MSD}\\\\equiv\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x_0}^2\\\\rangle =\\\\langle (x_1(t)-x_1(0))^2+(x_2(t)-x_2(0))^2+\\\\dots+(x_n(t)-x_n(0))^2\\\\rangle Since all the coordinates are independent, their deviation from the reference position is also independent. Therefore, {\\\\rm MSD} =\\\\langle (x_1(t)-x_1(0))^2 \\\\rangle + \\\\langle (x_2(t)-x_2(0))^2 \\\\rangle + \\\\dots+\\\\langle(x_n(t)-x_n(0))^2\\\\rangle For each coordinate, following the same derivation as in 1D scenario above, one obtains the MSD in that dimension as 2Dt . Hence, the final result of Mean squared displacement in n-dimension Brownian motion is: \\\\text{MSD}=2nDt. MSD in experiments Experimental methods to determine MSDs include neutron scattering and photon correlation spectroscopy. The linear relationship between the MSD and time t allows for graphical methods to determine the diffusivity constant D. This is especially useful for rough calculations of the diffusivity in environmental systems. In some atmospheric dispersion models, the relationship between MSD and time t is not linear. Instead, a series of power laws empirically representing the variation of the square root of MSD versus downwind distance are commonly used in studying the dispersion phenomenon.

Finally, the LBDNH works with other regional agencies to apply for grants, use funds effectively and efficiently and address needs region-wide to foster cooperation among organizations. History of the Lessie Bates Davis Neighborhood House The original mission of the neighborhood house was serving Bohemian immigrants who came to East St. Louis in the early 1900s to work in National Stockyards. Through the support of the Women's Home Missionary Society, Rev. W.F. Fransee, of Bohemian descent, came to the area as a missionary to these people. A small cottage near the comer of 9th and Winstanley was obtained and thus began the Slavonic Settlement, as it was first known. Church services and Sunday School were held regularly, but from the beginning, the work sought to meet the social, physical and spiritual needs of the community. A Day Care for children of working mothers was one of the first programs to be started. The programs met a ready response and the mission work grew rapidly. In response to the rapidly growing programs, the Women's Home Missionary Society of Southern Illinois Conference in 1914 provided the funds for a new building at the comer of 9th and Winstanley. In 1939, the a new building was constructed and names the after Mrs. Frank L. Davis (Lessie Bates, the wife of a physician, who raised the $125,000 necessary for the construction. Elizabeth Provence served as executive director during the tumult of the 1960s and early 1970s, strengthening and expanding the agency's recreational and educational programs at the agency. In addition, she was able to get the community residents more actively involved in the programming at Neighborhood House. As the city's population fell from 75,000 in the 1960s to slightly over 40,000 by 1990, the housing stock continued to decline and the number of impoverished people in the city increased. The needs of the children and families in the community also continued to grow and change. In response to this growing need the Neighborhood House began offering additional programs and services, with the goal of \\"Empowering and Strengthening the Individuals and Families throughout the greater East St. Louis community.\\" Locations Lessie Bates Davis Neighborhood operates five sites in the Greater St. Louis Metro East area. St. Louis Metro East Administrative offices Lessie Bates Davis Neighborhood House houses the administrative offices of Lessie Bates Davis organization. The building was dedicated in 1939 and named after Lessie Bates Davis, who raised the funds for the building. The original building held dorms for missionaries. Year round the site hosts an open and supervised gymnasium for area youth. Programs today include emergency services programs, utility assistance, outreach programs, youth services including recreation, education, jobs program and cultural arts, and a wide range of comprehensive family support and family preservation services.

Giacomo Savelli (1523‚Äì1587) was an Italian Roman Catholic cardinal and bishop. He participated in several papal conclaves and held several administrative positions in the Catholic Church during his 48 year career with the Church during the mid 16th century. Biography A member of the Savelli family, Giacomo Savelli was born in Rome in 1523, the son of Roman nobles Giambattista Savelli and Costanza Bentivoglio.Entry from Biographical Dictionary of the Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church His paternal grandmother, Camilla Farnese, was a cousin of Pope Paul III. Savelli studied Latin and Greek as a young man and then attended the University of Padua to study law. He joined the papal household of Pope Paul III as a chamberlain of honor. He also served as a protonotary apostolic. Pope Paul III made him a cardinal deacon in the consistory of December 19, 1539. He received the red hat and the deaconry of Santa Lucia in Selci on April 16, 1540. On January 8, 1543, he opted for the deaconry of Santi Cosma e Damiano. From April 13, 1545 to May 26, 1546, he was the administrator of the see of Teramo. He participated in the papal conclave of 1549-50 that elected Pope Julius III. The new pope made Cardinal Savelli papal legate in the March of Ancona and he served in that position throughout the pontificate of Julius III. He opted for the deaconry of San Nicola in Carcere on March 9, 1552. He participated in both the papal conclave of April 1555 that elected Pope Marcellus II and the papal conclave of May 1555 that elected Pope Paul IV. He was the administrator of the see of Gubbio from May 29, 1555 until February 6, 1556, when he resigned the administration in favor of his nephew Marino Savelli, bishop-elect of Nicastro.

The congregation, whose synagogue building is in Lichfield Gardens, has 250 members and is a member community of the United Synagogue. History A Jewish community is known to have existed in Richmond in the late 17th century. King William III dined with Solomon de Medina, a Jewish businessman, at his country house in Richmond in November 1699. Until 1916 Richmond's Jewish religious community was known as the Richmond Hebrew Congregation. From 1916 to 1938, as Richmond Associate Synagogue, it met at Central Hall, Parkshot, Richmond, a building opened on 28 June 1916 by Leopold de Rothschild, the then President of the United Synagogue. From 1938, the renamed Richmond District Synagogue met at a converted chapel at 8 Sheen Road, which was compulsorily purchased by Richmond upon Thames Council to make way for a Waitrose supermarket and multi-storey car park. Designed by Stern Thom Fehler Architects, a new purpose-built synagogue building at Lichfield Gardens was opened on 8 March 1987 by Chief Rabbi Sir Immanuel Jakobovits and Rabbi Moshe Barron. A rabbi's house was later built on part of the synagogue's car park. People Richmond Synagogue's rabbi, since June 2016, is Meir Shindler, who was previously at Chigwell and Hainault Synagogue. Previous rabbis have included Maurice Ginsberg (1922‚Äì61), Yitzchak Schochet (1991‚Äì93), Jonathan Hughes (2013‚Äì15) and Yossi Ives (2003‚Äì12). Notable congregants have included Eldred Tabachnik and Lord Woolf. Activities Services are held on Friday evenings at 7:00 pm and on Saturday mornings at 9.30 am. The synagogue operates a day centre for Jewish people over 60.

She won the Siminovitch Prize in 2002. To date she has written more than a dozen plays including The Four Lives of Marie, The Seven Days of Simon Labrosse, Helen's Necklace, John and Beatrice, The Little Room at the Top of the Stairs, and most recently: Thinking of Yu. Career Fr√©chette studied acting at the National Theatre School of Canada from 1970 to 1973. She became involved in political and feminist theatre as well as collective writing which was flourishing at that time in Quebec. In 1974, she joined the feminist theatre group called the Theatre des cuisines (Kitchen Theatre Group) and participated in three productions: Nous aurons les enfants que nous voulons, Moman travaille pas, a trop d'ouvrage and As-tu vu ? Les maisons s'emportent! It was in this context that she began writing for the theatre, as part of a group effort by the women involved. The Kitchen Theatre experiment came to an end in the early 1980s and Fr√©chette undertook graduate studies in dramatic arts at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al. It was there that she wrote her first single-authored play:Baby Blues which was staged in 1989 at the Theatre d'Aujourd'hui (principal playhouse for contemporary Quebec writers in Montreal). Her second play, The Four Lives of Marie, translated by John Murrell and published by Playwrights Canada Press, won the Governor General's Award for French-language drama in 1995. This play constituted a turning point in Fr√©chette's career as a playwright. It was first produced in English in Toronto, Ontario, in 1997 and then in French in Montreal and Paris in 1998. The same year, her third play, Elisa's Skin was staged in Montreal. This was immediately followed by The Seven Days of Simon Labrosse which saw productions in Canada, Belgium and France. Since then, Fr√©chette's work has continued unabated (five more full-length plays and numerous short plays). She has been translated into over twenty languages and is presented to audiences the world over. She has also written two novels for young adults Carmen and In the Key of Do, which have also been translated into several languages. Her work has won several prizes, in Canada and abroad. Many of her plays have been broadcast over the radio in France, Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. The Seven Days of Simon Labross and John and Beatrice were adapted for television. Fr√©chette has also been active in the theatre world in Quebec. From 1994 to 1999, she was president of the \\"Centre des auteurs dramatiques\\", a professional association of playwrights devoted to promoting French language Quebec theatre.

Dragas is a Virginia real estate developer and the CEO of the Dragas Companies. She is also a former member of, and rector for, the University of Virginia Board of Visitors. Early life and career =Education= Dragas attended the University of Virginia and graduated with a B.A. in economics and foreign affairs in 1984. She also graduated from the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration in 1988. By the early 1990s Dragas had become the President of the Tidewater Mortgage Bankers Association. =The Dragas Companies= The Dragas Companies is a southeastern Virginia real estate development and building company founded by Dragas' father and uncle, George and Mark Dragas, in 1968. Helen Dragas‚Äô first job, as a teenager, was interviewing customers at her family's company about their purchases. Helen Dragas was named president and CEO of the Dragas Companies in 1996 and has remained in that position since. Under her tenure, the company has received numerous local awards, and three national awards: the Lee Evans Award for Building Management Excellence in 1999, and the 2009 Lee Evans Award for Management Excellence in 2009, and the Best Builders Award from Builder Magazine, also in 2009. It is now the region's largest homebuilder, with a focus of improving upon the quality of low-price homes in the area. In 2007 the Dragas Companies donated $1.5 million to the cities of Virginia Beach, Norfolk and Chesapeake for their use in dealing with homelessness and improving education for children in poverty. In 2009 the Dragas Companies spent over $5 million to voluntarily remediate Chinese drywall that was installed by a subcontractor in over 70 homes without Dragas' knowledge. Helen Dragas was named Virginia Beach's 2009 First Citizen. She was also featured by The Virginian-Pilot in a 2010 article about successful female homebuilders and their achievements in the workplace. In 2014, Dragas earned a top-15 spot in the Inside Business‚ÄìHampton Roads Business Journal‚Äôs Power List of people who shape and influence the region of over 1.6 million people. The editor noted Dragas‚Äô tenacity and called for her to apply her leadership in helping the community combat challenges of economic growth, education, and workforce development. =Other positions= Dragas has served on the Virginia State Transportation Board, which makes decisions on state spending and transportation strategy. Dragas has also served as a director of the utility corporation Dominion Resources since 2010, and has served on their audit committee. She was appointed to the Virginia State Council of Higher Education and the Commonwealth Transportation board by former governor Mark Warner. UVA Board of Visitors =First term= Dragas was appointed as a member of the University of Virginia Board of Visitors by then Governor Tim Kaine in 2008. She became rector of the board on July 1, 2011, and was the first woman ever to be elected to the post. It‚Äôs been noted that Dragas‚Äô state service was uncontroversial until she made headlines in June 2012 as part of the resignation of UVA President Teresa A. Sullivan. Sullivan announced her resignation as president in early June after only two years in the position, citing \\"philosophical differences\\" with the Board of Visitors as her reasoning. Media outlets had reported that the rift between Sullivan and the board may have been, in part, due to Dragas' viewpoint that the university was facing serious financial challenges, and that the administration would need to explore fiscally conservative solutions, something Sullivan was not actively pursuing. A Washington Post story and a UVA student newspaper story had both claimed that Dragas organized the support necessary to oust Sullivan as president. After the resignation, Dragas assured the community that the board was unified in its actions, but some board members later claimed that they had no knowledge of the Sullivan decision until just before her resignation. A former board member, Randal Kirk, publicly stated that he and others believed that Sullivan was the wrong pick from the start. Public records later revealed that a super-majority of the board supported the change in leadership based on personnel reasons. Dragas became the center of attention for those who supported Sullivan in their expression of dismay. According to a public records release, there were over 450 e-mails sent calling for Dragas to resign as rector. Additionally, the faculty senate of UVA passed a resolution supporting Sullivan and expressing a lack of confidence in Dragas. A newspaper report would later reveal that Sullivan‚Äôs supporters, mobilized by John O. ‚ÄúDubby‚Äù Wynne, a former UVA rector who had originally hired Sullivan, had established ‚Äúa ‚Äòwar room‚Äô on grounds, where they organized a counterattack, focusing on influential alumni and wavering board members.‚Äù Following the vote, Dragas offered to meet with the faculty senate to discuss the matter, and a meeting took place on June 18, 2012. According to a statement by the faculty senate, the meeting was \\"cordial,\\" but the faculty senate still demanded both the reinstatement of Sullivan and the resignation of Dragas. As the situation escalated, Governor Bob McDonnell made a statement that if the Board of Visitors did not resolve the issue by their June 26 meeting, he would use his power of appointment to replace all of the board members. At the June 26th meeting, the board unanimously voted to reinstate Sullivan as president. While e-mails show that Dragas had considered resigning from her position as rector during the height of the situation, she was subsequently reappointed to another term on the board by Governor McDonnell, and has released a joint statement with Sullivan to demonstrate a shared commitment to moving on to solving the university's problems. =Reconfirmation= Dragas was reconfirmed in January 2013. A March 2, 2013 Washington Post article reported that days after Virginia lawmakers confirmed Dragas‚Äôs reappointment to the board in January, the rector sent the president a lengthy and detailed list of goals to meet this school year. Sullivan claimed that the letter was inappropriate and constituted micromanagement. The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) issued a report on March 14, 2013 criticizing the actions of the Board in general and Dragas in particular. The report stated that Dragas was not prepared for the disruptive influence of online education, that she had previously made uninformed statements, and that she seemed inexperienced in her position. [32] It was noted that the report contained ‚Äúmultiple errors of fact.‚Äù The American Council of Trustees and Alumni later praised the work of Dragas and the Board, stating that ‚ÄúIf students are to receive a quality and affordable education in Virginia, it is the trustees who are going to have to press for, measure, and demand results.\\" Dragas‚Äô financial support of the university has been documented, noting that she has donated nearly half a million dollars to the university, ‚Äúbut she considers herself a voice for the state's lower- and middle-income families,‚Äù added one news report. In April 2013 Dragas was on the losing end of a 14-2 vote to raise tuition, claiming that the rise in tuition was putting the school on an unsustainable track. Dragas argued that tuition was rising faster than the income of Virginia families, so could become a barrier to post-secondary education. =End of tenure= The Washington Post wrote that the ouster of Sullivan served to be beneficial for the university in terms of developing an attitude in favor of long term change. In an exit interview from the position, Dragas stated that, \\"I believe we did the right thing in that we pushed for needed change ... We did it the wrong way in that we misunderstood that when you're going to try to solve thorne-y problems at a high-profile, public institution, you need to communicate a lot -- a lot more than we did -- and with a lot of people. And that was a lesson that I, in particular, and the board learned the hard way.\\" Her term as Rector ended at the end of June 2013, though she remains a member of the board. In August 2013, Dragas was one of only two members of the Board of Visitors to vote against scaling back the university‚Äôs financial aid program, Access U.Va., which assured low-income students could graduate without debt. The U.Va. Student Council submitted a letter echoing Dragas, requesting the program be maintained as it has operated for nine years. Following the decision, Ms. Dragas maintained her opposition to the measure stating that, ‚Äú[t]his action raises the cost of a UVa degree substantially for students from low-income families, hurting our diversity and coming at a time when we are already seen as elitist and unwelcoming.‚Äù Some alumni and students have begun organizing support and sending emails to administrators in an effort to reverse the decision. In September 2013, Dragas was noted for further expressing her opposition to tuition increases in the aftermath of a meeting between foundation representatives, administrators, deans and some board members who are advocates for raising in-state student tuition. Later in the Fall at a November meeting, Dragas urged her fellow board members to delay approving elements of a new strategic plan, reiterating a need for more discussion on the plan‚Äôs potential impacts to tuition and financial aid. Dragas specifically raised a concern about several years of double-digit tuition increases, following comments for the university‚Äôs president that the possibility of tuition increases have not been ruled out to pay for parts of the strategic plan, especially improvements to curriculum and student engagement. Ms. Dragas was featured in Hampton Road Magazine‚Äôs list of ‚Äú10 Leading Ladies‚Äù featuring the advice of powerful and inspiring women. She further mentioned the importance of affordable tuition by attributing her success and inspiration to the fact that she and her family ‚Äúwere able to afford the cost of a life-changing undergraduate and graduate education at the University of Virginia.\\" =Advocacy on Affordability= Throughout 2014, Dragas was further recognized for her advocacy of affordable higher education. Dragas has been joined by other members of the Board in raising concerns that the university has relied too much on yearly tuition increases to backfill stagnant state funding, lack of strategic planning, and declining research. Dragas and fellow board members have also pointed to the university‚Äôs lack of a long-term financial plan as one reason for the continued escalation of tuition. In response, in June 2014, the UVa Board of Visitors set up a special subcommittee to work on a long-range plan targeting affordability for students. During a June meeting of the UVa Board of Visitors, Dragas again raised the issue of the University‚Äôs public mission to provide affordable access to Virginians, arguing that board members owe their primary duty of loyalty to the public and then to the University. A newspaper article on the meeting pointed to tuition increases, as an example, which may limit access to Virginians with lower incomes but help the university administration avoid difficult budget decisions. One Virginia newspaper, the Daily Progress, cheered ‚ÄúHooray for Helen Dragas‚Äù, and editorialized that Dragas was ‚Äúspot-on in saying that the University of Virginia, including its governing board, should put the public interest first.‚Äù Calling her ‚Äúright on the money on these issues‚Äù, the Progress also agreed with Dragas that a proposed code of conduct muzzling Board member expression of dissenting views would be an unrighteous decision for a public institution. Personal life Dragas lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia. She is married to Lewis Webb, an attorney; they have three children.

At the University of Oregon, Bennett studied music, but he also painted in his free time.\\"Eugene Bennett: Rogue Valley Artist\\" , National Public Radio, July 28, 2006 During Bennett's service in the Navy, from 1943 to 1946, he continued to paint, and he decided to attend the Art Institute of Chicago.\\"Eugene Bennett Memorial Tribute honors one of the Rogue Valley's most prominent artists\\", Oregon Community Foundation profile By 1954 he had received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the Art Institute, and he taught there, and at New Trier High School. In 1954 Bennett moved to Italy and traveled to France. When he returned to Chicago in 1955, his works were shown in various exhibitions, and in 1957 the Art Institute awarded him the Renaissance Prize for Cathedral Forms. Although he was successful in Chicago, Bennett decided to return to Oregon. He was quoted in Southern Oregon Heritage Today as saying that he returned not only because the Rogue Valley was home, and beautiful, but also because he knew \\"there were many enthusiastic and talented artists in the Rogue Valley with so few possibilities to study or show their work. I wanted to help provide that opportunity for them.\\" Bennett taught classes in a home he had designed and built on South Grape Street in Medford, and in 1959 he established the Rogue Valley Art Association, which opened the Rogue Gallery. Bennett's last move was to Jacksonville, Oregon. He purchased the Eagle Brewery Saloon in 1962 and converted it to his home and studio, where he continued to paint, sculpt, build, draw and create collages. He particularly enjoyed working with wood and images of wood. Stacks of lumber and other building materials figure prominently in his work, and he created an installation of intricately carved poles studded with nails for the Oregon Pavilion at the Seattle World‚Äôs Fair in 1962. Bennett‚Äôs Jacksonville home In the mid-90s Bennett developed benign essential blepharospasm, which hindered his ability to keep his eyelids open and to tolerate light. Nevertheless, he continued to work, but at a somewhat reduced pace, concentrating increasingly on small collages and assemblages of wood, tacks, nails, foil, and found objects.\\"Artist is losing sight of his craft because of rare disease\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer July 21, 1997 Bennett employed his multiple talents, music, art and teaching, to benefit his community.

Al- Yamani's personality According to Shia sources, it is not clear whether Al- Yamani is one of descendants of Hasan ibn Ali or Husayn ibn Ali. A tradition by Ja'far al-Sadiq about Yamani ancestry said, \\"[One] from the lineage of my uncle Zayd will rise from Yemen.\\" There are different names for Al-Yamani in different traditions, such as \\"Hassan\\", \\"Hussein\\", \\"Saeed\\", \\"Mansour\\", and \\"Nasr\\". Muhammad, prophet of Islam, called him \\"Nasr\\" because he will come before Imam al-Mahdi. In some sources, Al-Yamani is mentioned as someone who invites people to the Imam al-Mahdi. Additionally, some sources call Al-Yamani \\"Mansour\\" and that he will assist Muhammad al-Mahdi in battle. Appearance of Yamani In Shia theology, five signs are guaranteed to occur before Imam al- Mahdi‚Äôs appearance. One of them is the appearance of al-Yamani, the ruler of Yemen, who will invite people to right and truth. Ja'far al-Sadiq states the five signs that will occur before Imam al-Mahdi's appearance include: the appearance of Sufyani and Yamani, the loud cry in the sky, the murder of Nafs- e-Zakiyyah, and the earth swallowing a group of people in the land of Beyda. In another Hadith, Muhammad al-Sadiq says that Yamani appears from Yemen with a white flag. =Time and place of the appearance= Yamani will rise up from Yemen. The sixth Imam of Shia says about the place of uprising, \\"[t]he rise of the Sufyani will be from Syria (Sham) and the rise of the Yemani will be from Yemen.‚Äù A Hadith by Muhammad al-Baqir explained, \\"[t]he appearance of Sufyani, Yamani and Khorasani will take place in one year, one month and one day (at the same time), they will take place as a series of events that are all connected by one string. Among these individuals the Yamani is the closest to guidance, for he calls the people to join Imam al-Mahdi. When he rises the trading of weapons will be prohibited for every Muslim. When he rises join him immediately, for his flag is the flag of guidance and prosperity and no Muslim should oppose it. Any one who does so will go to hell, because the Yamani calls to the right path.\\" In another Hadith, Ali al-Ridha said, \\"[t]he rise of Sufyani, Yemeni, and Khorasani will be at the same year, month, and day. Trouble will rise from every direction. Woe to those who try to resist them!\\" Yamani's appearance will occur during the month of Rajab. Some sources suggest that Yamani and Khurasani will be allied against Sufyani. = The conclusion of the appearance = While traditions provide few details about the conclusion of Yamani's appearance, a hadith by Muhammad al-Sadiq is said, \\"[a]fter the numerous wars and failures, he will crush on Sufyani and kill him.\\"  See also  * Khasf al-Bayda' * Signs of the reappearance of Muhammad al-Mahdi * The voice from sky * Sufyani * Nafs-e-Zakiyyah (Pure soul) References Category:Mahdiism Category:Shia eschatology Category:Religious leadership roles Category:Shia imams Category:Shia Islam Category:Islamic eschatology Category:Islamic terminology ","title":"Al-Yamani (Shiism)"},{"id":"36714047","text":"James C.

The foundation was originally envisioned by Rainer Arnhold, a San Francisco pediatrician and philanthropist, who taught at Mulago Hospital, Uganda. The foundation was officially created by his brother Henry Arnhold after Rainer Arnhold's death in 1993. Operations =Criteria for funding organizations= The Foundation's stated goal is to identify and invest in the highest impact giving opportunities. On their \\"How we fund\\" page, they write that they are looking for three things: a priority problem, a scalable solution, and an organization that can deliver. Once they identify an organization they wish to fund, they provide unrestricted and continued funding. Unlike most foundations, the Mulago Foundation does not accept or solicit proposals, but rather, the foundation itself tries to locate organizations to give to. =Organizations funded by Mulago= As of August 2012, the Mulago Foundation website lists about 30 organizations funded by the foundation. These include the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab and Innovations for Poverty Action, which are two of the foremost organizations that use randomized controlled trials and other methods to evaluate the effectiveness of poverty alleviation programs and other programs aimed at helping poor people. Also on the list are VillageReach (which charity evaluator GiveWell listed as its top rated charity from 2009 to November 2011), Living Goods (which has been profiled in many media outlets), Bridge International Academies (a for-profit company focused on low-cost private education in the developing world), mothers2mothers, KOMAZA, D-Rev, Samasource, VisionSpring, Root Capital, Muso, and The MicroDreams Foundation. Reception Charity evaluator GiveWell described the Mulago Foundation as an \\"impact-focused\\" grantmaker (alongside the Gates Foundation, Skoll Foundation, Children's Investment Fund Foundation, Jasmine Social Investments, and Peery Foundation). GiveWell stated in 2011 that it would consider the list of Mulago Foundation grantees (along with those of the other impact-focused grantmakers listed above, as well as the Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation) as part of its list of charities to review to see if they qualified for GiveWell's highest ratings. The Mulago Foundation was also mentioned on the Tactical Philanthropy blog, and Kevin Starr of Mulago wrote a guest post for the blog. Kevin Starr of Mulago wrote an article for the Stanford Social Innovation Review describing Mulago's definition of impact and some of the subtleties associated with the concept. His piece was referenced on the Acumen Fund blog. On March 11, 2014, Kevin Starr and Laura Hattendorf of the Mulago Foundation wrote a lengthy article in the Stanford Social Innovation Review skeptical of cash transfer charity GiveDirectly's accomplishment so far, saying that the evidence so far was underwhelming, though there might still be bigger gains a few years down the line. They contrasted GiveDirectly with other charities that they felt delivered more bang for the buck: One Acre Fund, VisionSpring, KickStart International, and Proximity Designs. Holden Karnofsky of GiveWell wrote a lengthy response countering that GiveDirectly's impact had been more rigorously established, and that Starr and Hattendorf were using flawed metrics to judge impact. The GiveDirectly board independently published a response on the GiveDirectly blog.

Gallagher, current Denver Auditor. Summary The Gallagher Amendment made many significant changes to property taxes in Colorado:An Analysis of 1982 Ballot Proposals. Research Publication No. 269, page 2. Legislative Council of the Colorado Assembly, 1982. # It simplified the assessor‚Äôs methodology for determining the actual value of property. Prior to this amendment, the assessor would consider some seven factors. The Gallagher Amendment established just three: cost, market, and income. # It established that the actual value of residential real property would be determined by the cost and market approaches to appraisal only. # It established that the actual value of agricultural land would be determined by the income approach to appraisal only (this is the earning or productive capacity of the land, capitalized at a rate prescribed by law). # It provided immediate relief to the tax burden on various types of property by reducing the assessments rates for 1983 and 1984. # It required the General Assembly to determine the percentage of the aggregate statewide valuation for assessment of various classes of property commencing January 1, 1985. Specifically, the General Assembly would be required to adjust the assessment percentage for residential property to ensure that the percentage of the aggregate statewide valuation for residential property in relation to other taxable property would remain the same as that in the prior year, except for increased valuation for assessment attributable to new construction and to increased volume of mineral and oil and gas production. This provision would become known as the Gallagher Adjustment. # It exempted certain property from taxation. These exemptions included: household furnishings and personal effects not used for the production of income; inventories of merchandise and material and supplies held for business consumption or for sale; livestock; agricultural and livestock products; and agricultural equipment used on a farm or ranch in the production of agricultural products. Many of these classes of property had been considered a nuisance tax based upon the complexity of the valuation (and the time and resources which it required) and the marginal revenue produced by the tax. The Gallagher Amendment had other effects as well, including mechanisms for enforcing the provisions described above. Ballot title Shall Sections 3 and 15 of Article X of the Colorado Constitution be amended in the following manner: Election results Passed by 551,334 votes (65.5%) to 290,590 votes (34.5%).Ballot Issue History, Colorado General Assembly  Repeal effort  In 2020, due to state budget shortfalls, state legislators approved a ballot initiative to repeal the Gallagher Amendment.

The term also serves to distinguish it from a form of shamanism not influenced by Buddhism (according to its adherents), called \\"black shamanism\\". Terminology and background While the applicability of the term \\"yellow\\" (or any other term) is still somewhat disputed, scholars consider the variety of shamanism practiced by the Khalka Mongols, the largest population group of Mongolia, to be yellow shamanism; others refer to the shamanism practiced by the Buryats of Siberia as yellow shamanism. =Mongolia= Buddhism first entered Mongolia during the Yuan Dynasty (thirteenth-fourteenth century) and was briefly established as a state religion. The cult of Genghis Khan, who had been accepted into the tngri, the highest pantheon of spirits in Mongolian shamanism, became annexed into Buddhist practice as well. Mongolia itself was at a political and developmental standstill until the sixteenth century, when after the conversion of Altan Khan Buddhism re-established itself. In 1691, after Outer Mongolia had been annexed by the Qing Dynasty, Buddhism became the dominant religion of the entire area and shamanism began incorporating Buddhist elements. Violent resistance in the eighteenth century by the hunting tribes of Northern Mongolia against the (Buddhist) ruling group, the Khalk Mongols, led to the foundation of black shamanism. During the Soviet domination of the Mongolian People's Republic, all varieties of shamanism were repressed; after 1991, when the era of Soviet influence was over, religion (including Buddhism and shamanism) made a comeback. The term \\"yellow shamanism\\" was first introduced in 1992 by Sendenjav Dulam and its use then adopted by Otgony P√ºrev, who considers it to be the Buddhism-influenced successor of an unbroken practice that goes back to Genghis Khan‚Äîthat earlier practice was \\"black shamanism\\" and was practiced by the Darkhad in defiance of the Buddhism introduced to the area by the Khalka. According to P√ºrev, the center of yellow shamanism was the Dayan Deerh monastery in Kh√∂vsg√∂l Province, where he found evidence of yellow practices in the recitations and prayers of a shaman born in the province in 1926; he argues that yellow shamanism has by now ceased to exist anywhere. Opponents argue that P√ºrev's argument relies too much on the evidence of one single monk from one province, and that it is more likely that yellow shamanism developed as a result of the tension between the Buddhism of the Qing Dynasty, for which conversion to Buddhism was in part a colonializing tactic. In agreement with P√ºrev's argument, though, yellow shamanism is also considered to not have survived Soviet and Communist rule. =Buryatia= The territory of the Buryats, who live around Lake Baikal, was invaded by the Russian Empire in the seventeenth century, and came to accept Buddhism in the eighteenth century at the same time they were recognizing themselves as Mongol; to which extent Buryat shamanism mixed with Buddhism is a matter of contention among scholars. A nineteenth-century division between black and white shamanism, where black shamanism called on evil deities to bring people misfortune while white shamanism invoked good deities for happiness and prosperity, had completely changed by the twentieth century. Today, black shamanism invokes traditional shamanic deities, whereas white shamanism invokes Buddhist deities and recites Buddhist incantations but wears black shamanist accoutrements. White shamans worship Sagaan Ubgen and Burkhan Garbal (the \\"Ancestor of Buddhism\\").

Completing the climb on his 20th birthday in 2006, Rhys beat the previous world record set by Danielle Fisher and previous British record set by Jake Meyer one year earlier. However, this record was later broken on 24 December 2011, by Jordan Romero. Early life Rhys grew up in the New Forest, Hampshire, England and was educated at Romsey School and Barton Peveril Sixth Form College. He started climbing as a result of hearing a talk at a Scout meeting. The talk was by Russell Parke MBE, the then leader of Hampshire Scout Expeditions, the subject was Mount Everest. Parkes talked about recruiting a Scout for an attempt on Mount Everest in 2007, to celebrate the centenary of the Scout movement. Jones went on to join the Hampshire Scout Expeditions team (HSX) and began training. His training with HSX included Scottish winter climbing, rock climbing and hillwalking. He also climbed with HSX on Mount McKinley, Alaska. The team successfully reached the summit and Jones claimed a record as the youngest British summiteer of North America's highest peak. Expeditions Mount McKinley was his first of the seven continental summits, and Jones then climbed the other six over a 3-year period. Mount McKinley, Alaska. N. America.

Summit May 2006 The Everest climb was in aid of the Wessex Heartbeat charity, and Jones pledged to raise ¬£1 for every vertical foot of Everest, ¬£29,035 in total. After Everest In August 2006, Jones raced in the Round Britain and Ireland non-stop yacht race, covering 2000 nm and completing a race in which one third of the fleet were forced to retire due to bad weather. After the race he was appointed as a Patron of the Sail 4 Cancer Charity. In 2007, Jones undertook a pioneering expedition to a remote part of South East Greenland. Sailing to Greenland from Iceland, the 3 man team then trekked inland across a glacier, where Jones fell into a crevasse fracturing his arm. During the 3 weeks waiting for the yacht to return, the team successfully made first ascents of four previously unclimbed peaks. In 2010 Jones set up a specialist trekking and expedition company RJ7 Expeditions. In 2011, RJ7 facilitated a filmed climb of Kilimanjaro for BBC documentary \\"Albino Witchcraft Murders\\", charting the plight of Tanzanians living with albinism. The lead character from the film, 34-year-old Tanzanian albino Josephat Torner reached the summit after 7 days of trekking. In 2012 RJ7 was responsible for leading Duncan Bannatyne (star of BBC Dragon's Den) on Kilimanjaro. RJ7 organised a successful climb for 4 amputee servicemen in February 2012, and two members of the team (both single amputees) set a new Guinness World Record for the Fastest Ascent of Kilimanjaro using crutches. An avid skier as well as a mountaineer, Rhys became a Patron of Sail 4 Cancer's sister charity Ski 4 Cancer in 2012. In 2014 Jones undertook a self supported ski mountaineering expedition with his wife Laura. They made a successful ascent of Mt Gunnbjornsfjeld, the highest mountain in the Arctic. Currently, Rhys and Laura run Monix Adventures, a luxury adventure travel company. Laura is now also a keen adventurer, and has run 7 marathons around the world in 1 year as part of her ICanRun7 challenge, including the world's highest marathon on Mt Everest, and the world's coldest marathon in the Yukon.

He worked with writer, Max Allan Collins. Fletcher continued to draw \\"Dick Tracy\\" until his death on March 16, 1983.

This was the first time in Martha's Vineyard history that a position was created to designate an island-wide poet laureate. On similar note, the Martha's Vineyard Poetry Society (MVPS) is the first island-wide poetry organization with membership in the history of Martha's Vineyard. MVPS was founded in 2008 by island poet/author/musician, William Waterway. The Martha's Vineyard Poetry Society (MVPS) is composed of a group of approximately 410 island poets and supporters who seek to enhance the presence of poetry on the Vineyard and throughout the world. The purpose of Martha's Vineyard Poetry Society's is to promote poetry on Martha's Vineyard through education and through the support of existing and new poetry groups. It is the organization's hope that through elevation of poetry in people's lives and consciousness ‚Äì it will facilitate a positive contribution to Martha's Vineyard culture and life styles. Over the years, MVPS has sponsored and hosted free public poetry events such as: \\"Martha's Vineyard Poet Laureate\\" celebration gatherings; ‚ÄúSummer Solstice In Poetry and Song‚Äù held at Featherstone Center for the Arts; \\"Winter Solstice in Poetry and Song\\" held at the Vineyard Haven Public Library; ‚ÄúA Gathering of Island Poets and Musicians‚Äù ‚Äì a four-hour MVTV television production broadcast ‚Äúlive‚Äù via Comcast to the island community; ‚ÄúMartha‚Äôs Vineyard Poem in Your Pocket Day (MVPIYPD)‚Äù,https://www.mvtimes.com/2013/04/15/that-poem-your- pocket-15124/http://www.mvtimes.com/2015/05/02/it-was-potluck-and-poetry-at- mvtv-studios-on-thursday/ held in conjunction with National Poem in Your Pocket (PIYP) day;http://www.poets.org/academy-american- poets/programs/national-poem-your-pocket-day the Gay Head Lighthouse poetry book project that published Lighthouse Legacy; \\"Civil War Poetry\\" at the Vineyard Haven Public Library with support from the American Library Association (ALA), and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), and, many other poetry programs on the island of Martha's Vineyard. Designation of first Martha's Vineyard Poet Laureate (MVPoetLaureate) in the island's history Martha's Vineyard plays host to a strong and vibrant community of poets and clusters of poetry groups. Besides the resident year-round poets, the island enjoys seasonal presentations by many renowned poets, including United States Poets Laureate. The position of MV Poet Laureate was presented to the public by the 431-member Martha's Vineyard Poetry Society in July 2012. Prior to this, there never was a designated Martha's Vineyard Poet Laureate throughout the island's history. To accomplish the task of designating the island's first MV Poet Laureate, the Martha's Vineyard Poetry Society's founder, William Waterway, created a double-blind election process that precluded politicking, lobbying, or collusion. Martha's Vineyard's First Poet Laureate, Lee H. McCormack ‚Äì the election process Lee H. McCormack, first Martha's Vineyard Poet Laureate (MV Poet Laureate) in the island's history Following a year-long judging process ‚Äì Lee H. McCormack was selected as the island's first Martha's Vineyard Poet Laureate in July 2012. A jury of ten qualified literary judges from representatives of the Martha's Vineyard Poetry Society, island libraries, writers, and poetry groups made the selection. Mr. McCormack was one out of a field of twenty-six participating poets. Each poet submitted five of their finest poems to the Martha's Vineyard Poetry Society. The poems were then copied and distributed to the judges without identifying marks except for a number assigned to each poet. All judging was based solely on the merits of submitted poems. Each of the ten judges did not know the names of the poets they were judging. On similar note, participating poets did not know the names of the ten judges. The names of the winning poet was revealed to the judges after the numerical judging results were submitted and calculated. Shortly after the judging process, a public announcement and media release shared the name of the winning poet. The Martha's Vineyard Poetry Society, in conjunction with the Vineyard Haven Public Library, held a festive evening to inaugurate and celebrate the island's first Martha's Vineyard Poet Laureate. Since his election, MV Poet Laureate, Lee, H. McCormack has undertaken several public library poetry gatherings ‚Äì as well as participating in the Featherstone Center for the Arts evening of \\"Fall Poetry and Music.\\" Mr. McCormack is also organizing a series of workshops with island poetry groups; libraries; schools; cultural institutions, and council on aging organizations.https://www.facebook.com/MVPoetLaureate?hc_location=timeline MV Poet Laureate McCormack read his shark conservation and education poem, entitled, The Apex, before an audience exceeding 2,000 people at the \\"Jaws Fest The Tribute\\", festival in 2012.

One of the first community based projects Arnie Reisman initiated as MV Poet Laureate, was to create and host a monthly \\"Poetry Cafe'\\" at the newly renovated Vineyard Playhouse. While hosting the Poetry Cafe', Reisman blends interludes of his poetry with that of three poets selected from the island poetry community. The hour-and-a-half event includes social time with deserts and beverages before and after the event's poetry readings. Brief history of Martha's Vineyard poetry Martha's Vineyard has a history of attracting people of note as well as those involved with the arts ‚Äì including: dancers; actors; singer/songwriters; authors; playwrights; artists; sitting United States presidents; and poets. The island's storied history with poetry begins with the writings of the first colonialists, who wrote poetic prose that is recognized today as a form called poesy. Another historic island connection to poetry is that with novelist and civil war poet, Herman Melville. As Martha's Vineyard entered the whaling era ‚Äì many whaling ship crew members, including many island women, also put poetic pen to paper. Martha's Vineyard appears to have always cultivated a culture of poetry. From diaries of men at sea longing for their wives and family at home, to the hardships and beauty of island life ‚Äì poetry served island people as a form of sharing their thoughts and emotions. Through the 1970s‚Äì80s, there were a series of island coffee houses presenting poetry to relatively large numbers of people. Wintertide Coffee House, located at Five Corners, and Daggett House Cafe', located at the Vineyard Playhouse, were the two most prominent coffee houses serving up poetry on a weekly basis. There was also the UU church gatherings organized by Ingrid Goff. Ingrid Goff and volunteers would set up linen covered tables with candles and small vases of flowers at the Unitarian Universalist Church ‚Äì and would feature intimate evenings of poetry accompanied by musical interludes. On similar note during the early 1980s, the furniture store, Vineyard Decorators, which was located on State Road in Vineyard Haven at the old Coca Cola bottling plant, established for a brief time an \\"invitation only\\" poetry lounge. Poets would gather for intimate recitals on expensive furnishings arranged as a living room setting. During the early 1900s, the up-island home of Dionis Coffin Riggs (1898‚Äì1997) ‚Äì situated in the town of West Tisbury, became the island's de facto center of poetry. Ms. Riggs' home was the historic \\"Cleaveland House.\\" The Cleaveland House has been in the same family for over 250 years, and has always served as a meeting place of island intellectuals, politicians, and writers. Circa 1960, Ms. Riggs began hosting poetry gatherings at her home. Since its inception, this group of poets met every two weeks to share, discuss, and criticize the original poems of attending members. To embellish the literary experience at her home, Ms. Riggs hosted \\"black bean dinners\\" every Saturday evening as a vehicle for poets and writers to share discourse. Since 1960, member poets have met every two weeks at Cleaveland House with little interruption over the years, and continue to do so at the present. The continuity and longevity of this poetry group at Cleaveland House makes it the most successful, longest lived writers' group in the history of Martha's Vineyard and the United States. Following Dionis Coffin Riggs death, the group was served by chairpersons Ruth Cochrane, who was followed by Judith Neeld. William Waterway was appointed as the group's Chair by Cynthia Riggs in 2004. Waterway renamed the group from the loosely applied name, \\"Wednesday's Poets\\", to \\"Cleaveland House Poets\\" to honor the name of the B&B; house where the group met. In the 1990s the group published a book of poetry entitled, \\"Wednesday's Poets\\". The title reflects the day of week the Cleaveland House Poets have historically gathered. Contributing poets to this anthology were: Jane Brown; Ruth Cochrane; Janet Holladay; Russ Hoxsie; Bob Kaplan; Judith Neeld; Katrina Nevin; Brooks Robards; Valerie Sonnenthal; Holly Wayman, and Sally Williams. Today, the Cleaveland House poets members include: Ellie Bates, Bob Kaplan, Peter Lederman, Chris Legge, Bob Kaplan, Lee H. McCormack, Don McLagan, Judith Neeld, Fanny Staunton Ogilvie, Susan Puciul, Andrea B. Quigley, Arnie Riesman, Cynthia Riggs, Brooks Robard, Kara Taylor, Jennifer Smith Turner, Annette Sandrock and Valerie Sonnenthal. In 2009, former Chair, William Waterway, changed the name of the group to Cleaveland House Poets, and began promoting the group with Cynthia Riggs at public readings with this new moniker. The group recently published an anthology entitled: \\"Cleaveland House Poets, 50 Years\\". Cleaveland House Poets is now recognized as the oldest, continuously meeting poetry group in the history of Martha's Vineyard as well as of the entire United States. Besides the Martha's Vineyard Poetry Society, various island organizations and libraries have sponsored educational poetry programs, including the Martha's Vineyard Regional High School and island elementary schools; the Nathan Mayhew Seminars; Feathestone Center for the Arts; Martha's Vineyard Poets Collective; Noepe Institute; Martha's Vineyard Writers Residency; Pathways Projects; Alex's Place, and various council on aging and senior centers. The position of West Tisbury Poet Laureate had its genesis with Dionis Coffin Riggs, who founded a poetry group at her ancestral West Tisbury Home circa 1960. This group adopted the name Cleaveland House Poets in late 1990s to honor Dionis' bread and breakfast of same name. During her active life as a poet and writer, Dionis Coffin Riggs was sometimes referred to the island's poet laureate. Dionis would flinch at this, stating that Poet Laureate is not a lighthearted sobriquet. In honor of her mother's memory, Cynthia Riggs undertook the task of creating the position of West Tisbury Poet Laureate. About ten years after Dionis' death, in spring of 2006, Cynthia Riggs petitioned the town of West Tisbury to put an article on the Annual Town Meeting warrant to establish the position of West Tisbury Poet Laureate. The position of West Tisbury Poet Laureate officially came into existence on 11 April 2006 by a voice vote at the West Tisbury Annual Town Meeting.West Tisbury Annual Town Meetings Retrieved 26 August 2012 Soon afterwards, at the recommendation of an advisory committee formed by the West Tisbury Library, the Selectmen appointed Daniel Waters as the town's first Poet Laureate.West Tisbury Daniel Waters Poet Laureate.

On similar note, in December 2011, the selectmen of the Martha's Vineyard town of Edgartown appointed Steve Ewing as their first Edgartown Poet Laureate, .Edgartown appoints first poet laureate. Retrieved 26 August 2012 As documented above ‚Äì in July 2012 ‚Äì the first Martha's Vineyard Poet Laureate (MV Poet Laureate) in the island's history was selected by a panel of ten literary judges organized under the auspices of the Martha's Vineyard Poetry Society. The Martha's Vineyard Poet Laureate (MVPL) is encouraged to work with island media; poetry organizations; towns, and schools to further the public's appreciation of poetry on a local and global basis.

It was opened in 1948, and has operated since then. The previous owner George Gourlias got the diner listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The spelling \\"dinor\\" is unique to northwestern Pennsylvania, and its origin is largely unknown.  Design  The Lawrence Park Dinor is located in Lawrence Park Township, outside of Erie, Pennsylvania, on Main Street in a lot. Because of the property's narrow size, the diner is oriented perpendicular to the street. A cottage erected at the same time as the diner sits at the rear of the lot, and served as the living quarters for the diner's original owners. The Lawrence Park Dinor was manufactured by Silk City Diners, a division of the Patterson Vehicle Company, in Paterson, New Jersey. The restaurant building itself sits on a concrete block foundation, and is long and wide. Its exterior is a white, porcelain enamel with a fluted, stainless steel band \\"sandwiched by two narrow strips of blue\\". A monitor roof runs the length the diner, a feature that was common in diner design until the 1950s. The building's two entrances, one at the end of the diner and another at its middle, are both fronted by stainless steel doors, each with a large, oval window. The interior of the diner is laid out in a counter-aisle-booth seating configuration with 16 seats at the counter, 5 booths, and a free-standing table. The vaulted ceiling is made up of curved, porcelain panels.  History  The Lawrence Park Dinor was manufactured at the Silk City factory and transported to its present location in 1948. Its first owners, Harold Curtis and his wife, purchased the diner to serve the community of Lawrence Park. As the majority of people in Lawrence Park were employed by General Electric from the diner, a fast and inexpensive eating establishment was in demand. The unusual spelling of \\"dinor\\" is found only in northwestern Pennsylvania and its origin is speculated to have been a typographical error that was never corrected, or a variant derived from the German language. In 1930, three out of five diners in Erie used the spelling; by 1958 it was used by over 90 percent of diners in Erie. The diner was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 18, 2004, by George Gourlias with the help of Lawrence Park Historical Society Member Virginia Anderson. The current owners took over the diner in 2010. The Lawrence Park Dinor is known for its famous \\"Greek sauce\\"--a (brought to the menu by former owner George Gourlias 1991-2010) spiced, ground beef mixture popular in Erie as a topping on French fries (known elsewhere as \\"Texas hot sauce\\" for its use as a chili dog topping).

The large volume of low density pumice produced by the eruption accumulated as a large area of floating pumice, a pumice raft, that was originally covering a surface of , spread to a continuous float of between and within three months dispersed to an area of more than twice the size of New Zealand.Website of the expedition Mesh The thickness of the raft may initially have been as high as and was reduced to around within a month. Three months after the eruption, the mass had dispersed into very dilute rafts and ribbons of floating pumice clasts. Most pumice clasts became waterlogged and sank to the sea floor while some flocks have stranded in the Tonga islands, on the northern shores of New Zealand, and eventually on the eastern coast of Australia one year after the eruption. Eruption Bathymetric map of Kermadec islands and seamounts The eruption of the Havre Seamount was not initially noticed by scientists, and volcanologists were not even aware that the Havre Seamount was an active submarine volcano. After the pumice raft was detected, researchers retrospectively examined satellite imagery and past seismic activity in an attempt to pinpoint the time and location of the eruption that produced the pumice raft. Seismologists discovered a cluster of earthquakes (ranging in magnitude between 3.0 and 4.8) that occurred 18‚Äì19 July 2012. These earthquakes were consistent with magma rising into a magma chamber prior to eruption. Analysis of satellite imagery showed an ash plume appear on 18 July 2012 and conclude several days later. Although some volcanologists initially believed that the eruption might have occurred at the Monowai Seamount, this possibility was later ruled out. It is also believed that the eruption was unrelated to the 2012 Te MƒÅri eruption at New Zealand's Mount Tongariro. In 2015 a scientific expedition set out to study changes of seafloor topography in the area surrounding Havre Seamount. The same group of researchers mapped the distribution of the floating pumice blocks driven by wind, ocean currents and eddies. Pumice raft Kermadec Islands pumice raft on 12 August 2012. Raft can be seen as fibrous tendrils primarily in lower right quadrant; Raoul Island can be seen as green dot near upper right. Scientists were not aware that any eruption had occurred until a huge pumice raft was sighted and photographed at 14:40 NZST on 31 July 2012 by Maggie de Grauw while on a commercial flight from Faleolo, Samoa to Auckland, New Zealand. She emailed her pictures to Dr Scott Bryan, senior research fellow at Queensland University of Technology. After discussion it was ascertained that the raft was around north of Auckland. Bryan then contacted Olivier Hyvernaud from the Laboratoire de G√©ophysique, Tahiti, who confirmed the location from Terra/MODIS imagery from NASA. The raft was subsequently sighted by members of the New Zealand Defence Force on 9 August 2012‚Äîseveral weeks after the eruption had occurred. It was spotted by an Orion aircraft and then approached and sampled by the strategic sealift ship HMNZS Canterbury. The pumice raft measured approximately in length and more than in width, making the floating island larger in surface area than Israel. An officer in the Royal Australian Navy said that it was \\"the weirdest thing [he had] seen in 18 years at sea\\".

His cult is linked to fertility rites which are practiced in yellow shamanism (which incorporates Buddhist ritual and belief) as well as in black shamanism (a less Buddhist-influenced type of shamanism). He is still venerated, especially on the eastern side of Lake Kh√∂vsg√∂l. Origin and cult Dayan Deerh is worshiped in both yellow shamanism and the less Buddhism-influenced black shamanism, though black shamans around Kh√∂vsg√∂l Nuur often do not accept him since he is popular among the yellow shamans. One explanation is that Dayan Deerh would have betrayed the black shamans by going over to the Buddhist side. Agnes Birtalan proposed that he began his career as a fertility god, then became a spirit particularly for shamans, and ended up as a protector. As a fertility god, he granted cattle and children to people, and was a shaman for Genghis Khan with whose wife or daughter he eloped. He can only be killed by suffocation (fire and metal cannot hurt him) and in return for not being threatened by the Khan with such a death he becomes a protector of him and his people. There is also a tradition of rivalry between Dayan Deerh and the Dalai Lama; still, syncretism between the two religious traditions is suggested by the fact that Dayan Deerh became a protector of yellow shamanism. Moreover, his statue is venerated by the Lamas of the Deerkhiin Kh√ºree monastery. Both Khalka and Buryat Mongols revere him, and in addition to promoting fertility he also functions as a patron to shamanic initiation. A statue of the god was venerated in Tsagaannuur, Kh√∂vsg√∂l, where his cult was particularly strong; it appears that Dayan Deerh had turned himself into a stone statue, according to sacral texts collected by Birtalan, and that warriors of Genghis Khan unsuccessfully tried to destroy it. The statue disappeared possibly in 1929 or in the 1950s, and later a Buddhist shrine newly established in a former hotel took over that function, where a new cult has now formed. In 1998, Birtalan recorded a number of incantations from X«ñxenƒµƒ≠, the descendant of a shamaness‚Äîtwo longer ones (a prayer and an invocation) and three shorter ones dedicated to Dayan Deerh. X«ñxenƒµƒ≠, whose family lived in Renchinlkh√ºmbe, Kh√∂vsg√∂l, in the Darkhad Valley, said she came under the protection of Dayan Deerh when they moved to the eastern side of Lake Kh√∂vsg√∂l. One other place of his cult is a cave near the border between Russia and Mongolia, kept out of sight and accessible only by horseback. Even during the communist regime of the Mongolian People's Republic (1924‚Äì1992) it was continuously worshiped. A Buddhist warrior god statue is placed in the center of the cave and is almost completely covered by khatas. Nearby, purifying rituals are held. Depictions Dayan Deerh is often depicted as equestrian, wearing at least some typically Mongolian attributes (Birtalan mentions boots). He typically has a triple shamanic feather crown including three mirrors, though statues have a warrior helmet. In a scroll image owned by a monk in M√∂r√∂n, he carries a mirror around his neck, intended to ward off evil spirits, an attribute used also by shamans; a necklace consisting of beads \\"indicates the coexistence of Buddhism and shamanism\\".
