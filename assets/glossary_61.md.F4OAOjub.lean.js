History Parramatta Sun : a serio-comic magazine, issued fortnightly, during the voyage of the ship Parramatta. Parramatta was launched in May 1866 for Devitt and Moore, in the United Kingdom. The ship was named after the Parramatta River near Sydney in Australia. The style of ship was known as a Blackwall frigate. These three- masted ships had been designed to supersede the British East Indiaman that carried goods from India to the United Kingdom. The clipper ships were actually used for carrying wool from Australia to the United Kingdom and passengers in both directions. Parramatta was the second fastest of this type after Tweed. Apart from a brief spell in 1873-4, Parramatta was under the command of Captain John Williams until she was sold to Norwegian owners.Parramatta, Bruzelius.info, retrieved 5 March 2014 In 1887 the ship was sold to J. Simonsen, Mandal, Norway. When Parramatta undertook its three-month journeys from London to Sydney it would issue a fortnightly amusing magazine to the passengers on board. Some of these were subsequently issued in book form after the journey. The magazine's name changed each time. The Parramatta Sun was issued on the outward journey to Sydney from London from 9 September 1879 to 8 December 1879 and a copy is available on-line.Parramatta Sun, Library of NSW, retrieved 6 March 2014 In 1890 Parramatta left England for Moscow. The ship travelled via Alexandria, Jerusalem, Cyprus, and Constantinople. Explorer and nurse Kate Marsden was on board visiting leper hospitals en route to her trip to Siberia. Fate On 12 January 1898 Parramatta sailed from Galveston, Texas, laden with pitch-pine, bound for King's Lynn in Norfolk. She was never heard of again.

This theory describes the transition from a presidency that directed rhetoric toward the United States Congress and other government bodies, to one that addresses rhetoric, policy and ideas directly to the public. After political scientists introduced this theory in 1981, Jeffrey K. Tulis authored The Rhetorical Presidency in 1987 establishing itself as the first book on the theory. Tulis established three stages in his book how presidential rhetoric evolved throughout the U.S.' history: the \\"Old Way\\", the \\"Middle Way\\" and the \\"New Way\\". Tulis's book sparked much debate over the historical evolution of presidential rhetoric. Presidential rhetoric integrates both verbal and visual rhetoric practices to gather the support of the public.  History  The term \\"rhetorical presidency\\" was introduced by political scientists James Ceaser, Glen E. Thurow, Jeffrey Tulis, and Joseph Bessette in 1981. Tulis wrote the foundational book on the subject entitled The Rhetorical Presidency, in 1987. Tulis' book spurred heated debate on the history and evolution of presidential rhetoric, with Tulis himself later revising positions taken in his book. By relying less on the traditional methods of communication with Congress and, Presidents rely more on the approval of the people as a means of governance. Presidents hope the people put pressure on their members of Congress to side with the President.  Development  He claimed that changes in the rhetorical style of the presidency were a symptom of a shift in American's underlying conceptions regarding how government should function. Rhetorical presidency cut congressional dominion, influenced the power to fit public policy, and put the president in front with the American people to show the development of leadership as an imperative demeanor of presidential character and politics. The rhetorical presidency is both a structural theory and a theory of how presidents communicate in the media age. It draws from political science, history and communication studies. Tulis delineates the historical arc of presidential rhetoric in the United States as having three stages: the \\"Old Way\\", the \\"Middle Way\\" and the \\"New Way\\". The Old Way (1789‚Äì1900) corresponds with traditional conventions of statecraft and rhetoric addressed to Congress, the courts or visiting dignitaries. Most presidential rhetoric was delivered in writing. The only attempt during this period to use rhetoric to address the whole people was President Andrew Johnson's Swing Around the Circle, which failed. The Middle Way (1900‚Äì1913) marks a hybrid between internal and external appeals on important matters epitomized by the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. He met fierce opposition from his own party in Congress regarding the Hepburn Act, with appeals directly to the people. William McKinley's 1898 speaking tour is argued to be an integral part of developing the \\"Middle Way\\" that Theodore Roosevelt is mainly credited for. The New Way (1913‚Äìpresent) refers to a presidency which dispenses with traditional statecraft and instead regularly engages the public. Woodrow Wilson employed two types of rhetoric: the policy speech and the visionary speech. A policy speech explains and defends the president's policy on a certain issue, while the visionary speech articulates a goal for the future and calls the nation towards that goal. Since Wilson, all Presidents have emphasized these tools.  Verbal and Visual Rhetoric  Verbal rhetoric used by Presidents is the most common type of presidential rhetoric used. The implication of Woodrow Wilson's policy speeches and visionary speeches laid the groundwork for the following Presidents. The use of the State of the Union Address is an example of Presidents explaining and defending their own policies to gain the support of the public directly. Using visual images, text and video to influence or persuade an audience is how Presidents utilize visual rhetoric in their own presidential rhetoric. The increasing growth of the mass media has increased the value of visual rhetoric in helping create a positive political image with the people.

The rejection, according to some theories, directly led to the death of this painter in 1879 at the age of 23, 18 months after her rejection. Henschel-Rosenfeld herself was murdered by the Nazis 65 years later at Westerwald.Page of Testimony at Yad Vashem Her granddaughter submitted her Page of Testimony to Yad Vashem. Henschel-Rosenfeld appears in some of Gottlieb's most famous paintings. Early life Laura Rosenfeld born on December 25, 1857 to Joseph Rosenfeld and Rosa Kolisch in Brno, the capital of Moravia. She was the youngest of 11 children. Laura attended a convent school in Lienz, Upper Austria, and then another near Geneva for three years, but despite her surroundings, continued to maintain the Jewish faith instilled in her by her mother. After her father died, her widowed mother moved with her to Vienna, where she was to have her first encounter with Maurycy Gottlieb probably in 1875 or 1876. Relationship with Maurycy Gottlieb Maurycy Gottlieb was smitten by Rosenfeld, and soon proposed to her. She accepted, and became the subject of many of his paintings, including Portrait of Laura, Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur, Shylock and Jessica, Uriel Acosta and Judith. Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom KippurShylock and Jessica Gottlieb travelled between his hometown of Drohobych and Vienna, and soon Laura began to lose interest in him. Gottlieb sensing her distance in their letters became more and more anxious, until Laura finally confessed she had fallen in love with someone else. Detail of Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur showing Laura and Maurycy Gottlieb died on July 17, 1879, according to some, of a broken heart, intentionally letting his health fail, due to his despair over the failed romance. Laura got married on 3 July 1879. Gottlieb learnt about it two weeks later and spent the whole night aimlessly roaming around [Krakow] and next day he ended up in hospital with a fever, where he died the next morning. https://zaxid.net/mi_pamyatayemo_mauritsiy_otlib_n1094226 (Evidence of Gottlieb's despair can also be found in his letters to Laura, and in his painting, Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur, where he placed his own name on the memorial inscription on the Torah mantle.) Life after Gottlieb Laura married Leo Henschel a prosperous Berlin banker. She had four daughters, the eldest of whom perished in the Holocaust, one died at a young age, and the other two survived. The eldest daughter's name was Margarete Steiner-Henschel. She was murdered on August 31, 1944 in Auschwitz. Margarete Steiner-Henschel and her mother Laura Rosenfeld-Henschel are commemorated on a memorial monument in Zeist. Bat Sheva Scheflan (1910-2007), the daughter of Margarete Steiner-Henschel and granddaughter of Laura Henschel-Rosenfeld, later moved to Israel, to Kibbutz Heftziba. In 1955, together with her maternal aunt, Vali Marx, they donated Gottlieb's Portrait of Laura, to the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.Mendelsohn, Ezra \\"Painting a People, Maurycy Gottlieb and Jewish Art\\", Page 116. While Laura ran the busy Berlin household, she also continued to read and study. After her husband died in 1909, and her children had left home, Laura dedicated her life to education and social work. She worked in an orphanage for children of criminals, as a social worker among the needy segments of the population, and established a communal home near Berlin which stressed harmony and equality amongst its residents. Later she founded \\"The House of the Order of the Free Spirit\\", which she called a \\"school for human education\\" and attracted many followers who knew her as \\"Mother Henschel\\". She was also active with feminist and human rights movements outside of Germany. Writings and philosophy Laura Henschel-Rosenfeld was a prolific writer, penning some 150 volumes concerning her family history, childhood recollections and philosophical reflections. Virtually all were lost during the Nazi occupation, save one 340 page leather-bound volume written in German by her own hand, called, \\"The Youngest Generation\\". The book is divided into two sections: a. intimate comments about her family written after the death of her husband in 1909; b. memoirs, thoughts and ideas written after 1940, during her time as a refugee in the Netherlands. The only other written materials containing her thoughts are to be found in a commemorative book published as part of the Castrum Peregrini series in Amsterdam in 1951, comprising some 102 pages. The book contains a collection of Henschel-Rosenfeld's ideas, along with two articles in German written by Lothar Helvling (\\"Mother Henschel\\") and Rudolph Eilhard (\\"Talks with Mother\\"). Both writers became acquainted with Henschel-Rosenfed during the last years of her life, and admired her greatly. According to Israeli art critic Eugen Kolb, who authored a short monograph on her life, Laura Henschel-Rosenfeld's writings \\"attest to wide spiritual horizons and a philosophical bent. She was aristocratic not only in appearance, but also in spirit\\" as is attested to by a few selected quotes from her work. Quotes \\"They say that all men are equal. No canvas is any different from another ‚Äì that is certainly true. But the pictures each man paints on the canvas of his life ‚Äì those are not the same.\\" \\"A man of noble spirit sees himself responsible for the everything in the world.\\" \\"Everyone who has must give.

For a while she was hidden by a friend in the east of the Netherlands, until she was informed upon. At 86 years of age, paralyzed and almost blind, she was shipped to Westerbork, and from there to Auschwitz-Birkenau.

This penalty was imposed by the Affordable Care Act. The penalty starts at 1 percent of taxable income in 2014, increasing to 2 percent in 2015 and 2.5 percent in 2016. The minimum payment in 2014 will be $95, unless that is changed by the passage of this law. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The Affordable Care Act (commonly known as \\"Obamacare\\") requires all U.S. citizens and legal residents to have health insurance that meets the law's requirements, or else they have to pay a tax penalty. The requirement is known as the individual mandate. Under the individual mandate provision (sometimes called a \\"shared responsibility requirement\\" or \\"mandatory minimum coverage requirement\\"), individuals who are not covered by an acceptable health insurance policy will be charged an annual tax penalty of $95, or up to 1% of income over the filing minimum,\\"Generally, in 2010, the filing threshold is $9,350 for a single person or a married person filing separately and is $18,700 for married filing jointly.\\" Joint Committee on Taxation, \\"Technical Explanation of The Revenue Provisions of the Reconciliation Act of 2010, as Amended, in Combination With the Patient Protection And Affordable Care Act,\\" March 21, 2010. whichever is greater; this will rise to a minimum of $695 ($2,085 for families), or 2.5% of income over the filing minimum, by 2016. Individuals who aren't covered will be assessed the penalty on their Federal tax return. In the wording of the law, a taxpayer who fails to pay the penalty \\"shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty\\" and cannot have liens or levies placed on their property, but the IRS will be able to withhold future tax refunds from them. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Suspending the Individual Mandate Penalty Law Equals Fairness Act or the SIMPLE Fairness Act would amend the Internal Revenue Code to delay until 2015 the imposition of the monthly penalty amount on individual taxpayers for failure to purchase minimum essential health care coverage. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as introduced in the House of Representatives on February 28, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4118 would delay the implementation of certain penalties related to the expansion of health insurance coverage established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA, and the health care provisions of ). The legislation would delay for one year the imposition of penalties associated with the requirement that most residents of the United States have health insurance coverage beginning in 2014. In addition, H.R. 4118 would shift by one year the schedule of penalties for people who do not comply with that mandate. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that enacting H.R. 4118 would reduce federal deficits by roughly $10 billion over the 2014-2019 period and by roughly $9 billion over the 2014-2024 period. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply because enacting the legislation would affect direct spending and revenues. JCT has determined that H.R. 4118 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Suspending the Individual Mandate Penalty Law Equals Fairness Act was introduced on February 28, 2014 by Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R, KS-2). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. On February 29, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 4118 would be considered on March 5, 2014. On March 5, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 97 by a vote of 250-160. Twenty- seven Democrats voted in favor of the bill. Debate and discussion Republicans argued that the bill was necessary to be fair to individual Americans, since the Obama administration had already delayed the penalties that would have applied to businesses.

Background The long-awaited De La Hoya‚ÄìVargas bout had been discussed for years. The fight was highly anticipated as not only were De La Hoya and Vargas two of the top fighters in the sport, they also had a long-going personal feud and openly discussed their hatred for one another. The rivalry was rumored to have stemmed from an incident in which Vargas, while working out at De La Hoya's boxing camp in 1993, supposedly slipped and fell in a snowbank while jogging. When Vargas spotted De La Hoya behind him, he reached out his arm hoping for some help, but De La Hoya simply laughed and continued on, angering Vargas, who held a grudge ever since.De La Hoya-Vargas jogging path tale leaves trail of bad blood, USA Today article, 2002-09-12, Retrieved on 2014-03-04 In June 2001, De La Hoya defeated Javier Castillejo to claim the WBC light‚Äìmiddleweight title, his fifth world title in his fifth different weight class. After De La Hoya's victory and after years of bad-mouthing each other, a fight between him and Vargas looked to finally be set for December 8, 2001, but negotiations fell through in August of that year after De La Hoya withdrew his proposal when the two sides couldn't agree on a deal after two weeks of talks.De La Hoya spurns Vargas, Chicago Tribune article, 2001-08-10, Retrieved on 2014-03-04 Despite their proposed fight in late 2001 falling through, the two sides continued to negotiate for months afterward before they reached an agreement in January 2002 for a May 4 bout.De La Hoya, Vargas Will Meet at Last, L.A.

Vargas was able to bloody De La Hoya's nose after an impressive fifth round; however, De La Hoya stormed back to take rounds six through eight and opened a gash under Vargas' right eye. Vargas regained his form in round nine, but De La Hoya turned up his offense in round 10 and stunned Vargas with a left hook to the head and a combination to the body just before the round ended. In the 11th round, De La Hoya continued to attack Vargas and with just over a minute gone by, sent him down with a left hook. Vargas got up and continued with the fight, but De La Hoya continued his assault, eventually getting Vargas into a corner and unleashing a flurry of punches. As Vargas was not offering much resistance, the referee stepped in and stopped the fight at 1:48, giving De La Hoya the victory by technical knockout.De La Hoya finishes off Vargas in 11th round, USA Today article, 2002-09‚Äì15, Retrieved on 2014-03-04 Aftermath Though Vargas expressed his desire for a rematch with De Le Hoya during his post-fight interview, a drug test that was administered the night of the fight revealed that he had tested positive for anabolic steroids.Vargas Drug Test Reveals Steroids, L.A.

Sarƒ± has been working on creating ceramics works that take advantage of the glow properties of radioactive uranium silicates. Sarƒ± has been working with technology and art in parallel implementing works of art by using the techniques of uranium silicate's phosphorus effects on porcelain bodies since 2011. According to Sarƒ±, there are two shades of red (copper red and uranium red) that are very difficult to achieve in glaze and ceramics and that a small surface of uranium red can be produced by burning uranium nitrate in high temperature. He was able to experiment with radioactive rare elements during his PhD studies in Sofia and that he was able to successfully significantly reduce alpha particle radiation from glaze and ceramics using radioactive uranium by using lead and lithium oxide layer coating which is further coated by glass layers.

After an art career spanning over 50 years, he died at age 77 of liver disease. His work continues to be showcased by art institutions and organizations across Houston, including the Deborah Colton Gallery, and is listed on the official website for the National Gallery of Art.  Early life and education  Dick Wray was born in Houston, Texas in 1933. He was the oldest child of Bundy and Mildred Wray, who both worked for the Union Pacific Railroad. His mother was known to have encouraged him to take art classes at an early age. Wray had one sibling: a brother named Robert Wray. Wray's first gravitation toward art occurred during his early teens, when he took free art lessons at the Houston Museum of Fine Arts. After graduating from Lamar High School in 1953, he enlisted in the United States Army, where he served as a radio operator for 2 years. In 1955, Wray received an honorable discharge from the Army and enrolled in the School of Architecture of the University of Houston. There, he would spend the next 3 years studying various forms of architecture, until leaving the school to finish his studies at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, the Arts Academy of the city of D√ºsseldorf, Germany. Wray travelled to Europe in 1958 in order to discover what he believed was the \\"center\\" of the art world. The two years he spent in Europe‚Äîbeginning in Paris and concluding in Germany‚Äîlaid the foundation for his painting career. Though originally interested in architecture, Wray's interactions with the work of abstract expressionists, artists of a European avant-garde movement known as the CoBrA group and New York Abstract Expressionists (which Wray also saw for the first time in Europe) had tremendous influences on his artistic passions. In effect, Wray deviated away from architecture and, equipped with new knowledge of European expressionism, returned to Texas at age 26 to begin his career as a painter. Wray launched his career in 1959 by competing in an art show at what is now the Art Museum of Southeast Texas in Beaumont. From thereon after, he exhibited his expressionist paintings in an art gallery or museum at least once per year for 51 consecutive years.  Career and achievements  Wray's artistic feats are numerous. According to the William Reaves Fine Art Gallery, Wray's work has been exhibited widely throughout the country, including in Texas, New York, California, and Oklahoma. In 1962, Wray's submission to the Museum of Fine Arts Houston (MFAH) exhibition, \\"The Southwest: Painting and Sculpture\\", received the Ford Foundation Purchase Prize. While living in Los Angeles between 1964 and 1966, he was the guest artist at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop. Upon returning to Houston, he served on the faculty at the Glassell School of Art between 1968 and 1982. Wray was one of seven artists represented in the show \\"Artists' Progress: Seven Houston Artists, 1943-1933\\" at the Glassell School of Art in 1993.Brauer, David E., Harvey Bott, Don Foster, et al. 7 Artists' Progress: Seven Houston Artists 1943-1993: Harvey Bott, Jack Boynton, Don Foster, Dorothy Hood, Charles Schorre, Don Shaw, Dick Wray, October 22-November 28, 1993, the Glassell School of Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas.

In 2000, he was presented with the Houston Art League's Texas Artist of the Year Award.Wilson, Jim E., and Wade Wilson (2000). ‚Äò‚ÄôDick Wray, Texas Artist of the Year Catalogue: Paintings 1960-2000‚Äô‚Äô (1st ed.). Art League Houston. Wray was featured in a 2006 exhibition‚Äî\\"Texas Modern: The Rediscovery of Early Texas Abstraction\\"‚Äîat Baylor University in Waco, Texas. In 2011, the city of Houston created laser- cut aluminum panels imitating Wray's work. The panels now scale one of the Houston Permitting Center's elevator towers, often referred to by writers as \\"Dick Wray's tower\\".  Personal life and death  A few years after returning from Europe, Wray met Georgetta Harvey, a model and photographer. They were married in 1961. Though they spent most of their marriage in Houston, they maintained a brief residence in Los Angeles. Dick and Georgetta had three children: Victor, Robert and Harold. Their oldest son died at age 18 in an automobile accident. In 2011, Wray died in Houston from complications due to liver disease. He was 77.  Critical reception  Public opinions of Wray's work have been mixed to generally positive. Abby Koenig of the Houston Press, in her review of the Dick Wray retrospect at the William Reaves Gallery, remarked on how \\"the sheer scale of Wray‚Äôs work is enough to stop you in your tracks\\", later claiming that \\"Dick Wray was a tour de force in the Texas art world and deserves all the accolades the gallery has bestowed upon him and this collection\\". James Harithas, director of the Station Museum of Contemporary Art, explained that \\"As far as the locals were concerned, Dick was one of the only painters who had been working seriously and with commitment\\". Bill Reaves, founder and president of the William Reaves Gallery, said that the Dick Wray retrospect was one of \\"the greatest one- person shows\\" they had on display. \\"His work is consistently good\\", Reaves said. Others have had opposing opinions of Wray's work. According to Koenig of the Houston Press, art collector Earl Weed described Wray's paintings as \\"irksome, messy explosions with no apparent rhyme or reason\\". Regarding Wray's display at the 1977 exhibit Texas Today: Three Exhibitions at the Fort Worth Art Museum, writer and critic Michael Mewsha of the Texas Monthly remarked that \\"Detracting from this fundamentally solid performance is the entirely arbitrary superimposition of crude, childlike scrawls in what appears to be a halfhearted effort to incorporate a sense of raw, funky 'Texas' personality\\".Mewshaw, Michael. ‚ÄúThe Texas Mainstream.‚Äù ‚Äò‚ÄôTexas Monthly.‚Äô‚Äô June 1977: 122.

Its headquarters is in Ipswich. It produces pamphlets, videos, classes, provides speakers, and holds conferences on Islam. It describes itself as \\"non-sectarian\\", \\"homegrown\\", and \\"particularly successful at teaching Islam to the youth and carries out a substantial amount of work at universities, colleges and mosques\\". It has been described by others as \\"probably the largest Salafi group in Britain\\". History The group was founded in 1984 by a group of four young Muslims studying at the University of Kingston in Surrey who were dissatisfied by what they saw as \\"a lack of dynamism\\" in the South Asian ahl-e-Hadith movement in Britain.Gilliat-Ray (2010) Muslims in Britain p81 M. Munawar Ali (Abu Muntasir) has been its head for some years. Ed Husain describes JIMAS as being known to be Wahhabi, although Gilliat-Ray says the group as providing platforms for prominent Muslim Brotherhood speakers such as Yusuf al-Qaradawi. According to Husain, the group made available speakers on Islam for his college and others: \\"Black, white, and Asian converts who had studied Islam in Saudi Arabia to live and preach in the UK.\\" The speakers were noted for being \\"mostly dynamic speakers, able to stir a crowd and plant genuine interest in Islam\\", their impressive knowledge of \\"the Quran or the Prophet Mohammed's wisdom\\", and but their ignoring of the \\"fourteen centuries of commentary and scholarship on Islam's primary sources\\", being passionate \\"about the idea of one God\\" (tawheed) while \\"ceaselessly warned against shirk\\" (polytheism), and for their appearance -- \\"they covered their heads with the red and white chequered Saudi scarf, ... They had huge, bushy beards and their trousers were very short, just below their knees\\". The speakers were also known for admonishing the Muslim students for wearing long trousers and listening to music. After the 9/11 attacks, according to Gilliat-Ray, the group changed its focus, becoming more interested in \\"grassroots engagement with 'ordinary' British Muslims\\" and moved away from the salafist ideology. Over the past twenty or so years JIMAS has splintered; mostly dividing over a pro/anti-Saudi dichotomy.

He is the former leader of the Alberta Party,https://edmontonjournal.com/news/edmonton/Alberta+election+Meet+party+leaders/10952587/story.html and in the 2015 Alberta general election was elected the party's sole Member of the Legislative Assembly, representing Calgary-Elbow. Clark resigned as leader on November 18, 2017, and served as interim leader until the leadership election when Stephen Mandel was elected the new leader of the party. Biography Clark was born and raised in Calgary, Alberta. He graduated in 1993 from the University of Victoria with a degree in Political Science, minoring in Sociology and holds an MBA from Royal Roads University, graduating in 2005. He returned to Alberta to work for Laurence Decore, who was then leader of the Official Opposition Alberta Liberals. Deciding to leave politics for a time, Clark earned an MBA and in 2006 co-founded an Information Technology consulting firm C3 Associates. The firm earned a distinction as one of Alberta Venture's 50 fast growth companies in 2011 and 2012. C3 Associates was also named one of Canada's top 250 information technology companies by the Branham Group in 2012 and 2013. In 2015, Mr. Clark was named one Alberta's 50 Most Influential by Alberta Venture Magazine. He has engaged in volunteer work, most notably as Vice Chair of Distress Centre Calgary, and he co-founded the Calgary River Communities Action Group in response to the 2013 Alberta floods. In 2013, Clark sold his share of C3 to his partners to enter politics full-time. Political career Clark was the Alberta Party's election candidate in Calgary-Elbow for the 2012 Alberta general election, placing 5th. Following the resignation of Glenn Taylor, the Alberta Party remained without a leader for some months. On May 29, 2013, the party announced that it would hold a leadership vote to coincide with its Annual General Meeting on September 21, 2013 in Edmonton. Clark won the election, receiving 87% of the 337 votes cast. He was elected as the Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for Calgary-Elbow on May 5, 2015. He currently serves on the Standing Committee for Resource Stewardship and is a member of the Select Special Ethics and Accountability Committee. Despite becoming the first Alberta Party candidate to win a seat in the Alberta legislature and growing the caucus to two by attracting an NDP MLA to cross the floor, Clark resigned as leader in November 2017 after being reportedly pressured by the party's board of directors to do so in order to renew the party through a leadership election. His resignation occurred months after the merger of the Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties in to the United Conservative Party which, in turn, resulted in large numbers of disaffected former Progressive Conservatives to join the Alberta Party and, allegedly, try to remould it in their image.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-party-greg-clark- leadership-politics-1.4416559 Though he initially considered standing in the new leadership election, Clark announced on December 14, 2017, that he would not be a candidate for the leadership though he intends to remain an Alberta Party MLA and run for re-election to the legislature in the 2019 provincial election.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-party-mla-greg-clark- will-not-seek-party-leadership-1.4448849 =Election results= References External links *Alberta Party Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Leaders of the Alberta Party Category:Alberta Party MLAs Category:Politicians from Calgary Category:21st-century Canadian politicians ","title":"Greg Clark (Canadian politician)"},{"id":"42122891","text":"Trentham Gardens railway station (originally named Trentham Park) was the last station built by the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) and was the terminus of the short Trentham Park branch.

Regular passenger traffic on the branch line was withdrawn between 1927 and 1938 although excursion trains ran frequently. In 1938 a regular Sunday service was reintroduced but the outbreak of the Second World War led to the discontinuation of these services.

The Spanish occupied city of Moers (Dutch at the time: Meurs) under Governor Andr√©s de Miranda was besieged by Dutch and English troops under the command of Prince Maurice of Orange. The siege ended with the capitulation and the withdrawal of the Spanish garrison. The siege was part of Maurice's campaign of 1597 known as the Ten Glory Years, his highly successful offensive against the Spaniards.Israel pg 29-30van Nimwegen pg 166 Background Moers had been occupied by the governor of the Spanish Netherlands, Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, on 8 August 1586 and Colonel Sacchinus Camillo de Modiliana was made governor with a modest garrison.von Roden pg 49 Halfway through 1597 the government at The Hague, with improved funding, ordered a new campaign for Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange, the commander of the Dutch and English troops, to oust the Spanish while they had been preoccupied with the Siege of Amiens.Wagenaar pg 470 Maurice planned a campaign directly through the east of the Netherlands, where Grol and Oldenzaal were the strongest cities.

Siege Sitting on western bank of the Rhine, Moers consisted of a fortress with a castle, Herman van den Bergh, the governor of Spanish Upper Guelders, reinforced the city with additional troops which totaled 400 soldiers under the command of Andr√©s de Miranda. Upon arrival Maurice then had Moers besieged from two sides, his batteries opened up on 29 August whilst the engineers had parts of the moat surrounding the city filled in at three places, so that the city could be stormed. Moers however offered little resistance to the Dutch and English; with parts of the wall crumbling and even before the attack was launched on 3 September, de Miranda negotiated for terms which Maurice accepted. Miranda surrendered the city and his men marched out with full honors and Maurice's troops then entered the city who then strengthened the fortifications and left a garrison. On 8 September Maurice then marched to Orsoy, crossed over the Rhine, then over the Lippe and appeared on the evening of 11 September before Groenlo, which he then besieged for eleven days forcing the garrison to surrender.

He was also known as . He served the emperors Kanmu, Heizei, and Saga, and was trusted and valued by each. He succeeded his uncle Nagate and his line as the head of the family. Unlike his father, whose secondary status in the family had prevented him from making daijin, Uchimaro rose to udaijin, and led the cabinet in Heizei's reign and the beginning of Saga's. He had many children, helping to lay the foundation for the later success of the Hokke.  Life  On the ascension of Emperor Kanmu in 781, Uchimaro was promoted from to . He was consecutively promoted in 785, 786, and 787, culminating in the rank of . This came shortly after Uchimaro's first wife, Kudara no Nagatsugu, who had since become a court lady, bore the emperor a prince (). It has been theorized that this birth precipitated Uchimaro's rapid promotion, and even that he used Nagatsugu as collateral to deepen his relationship with the Emperor. During this period, he held various positions in the imperial guard and as a provincial governor. Later, Uchimaro held head directoral positions in a division of the imperial guard, the Ministry of Justice, and the , a body governing the finances of the imperial household. In 794, immediately after the move of the capital to Heian-ky≈ç, Uchimaro joined the kugy≈ç with a promotion to sangi. At the age of 39, this made him the second youngest member of the cabinet after the 34-year-old of the Nanke. However, in the next few years, four high-ranking cabinet officials, including udaijin Fujiwara no Tsuginawa and dainagon Ki no Kosami, died or retired, and in 798, Uchimaro was promoted to and ch≈´nagon. He also obtained various other positions during this period, including general of the imperial guard. In 799 he was put in charge of the continued relocation to the capital. During the dispute between Fujiwara no Otsugu and Sugano no Mamichi (), in which Otsugu persuaded the Emperor to suspend his campaign in Ezo and the construction of Heian-ky≈ç, Uchimaro waited on Kanmu by his side.

In 809, he was promoted to . He emerged unscathed from the attempted coup of Prince Iyo and the Kusuko Incident. Uchimaro died on November 13, 812, at the age of 57. He was posthumously promoted to and sadaijin, and days later again to daij≈ç-daijin.  Personality  According to the Nihon K≈çki, Uchimaro was mild-mannered and very popular, and people were happy to follow him. The emperors he served trusted him deeply, and while he did not flatter them, he did not remonstrate them when they disagreed. He served in important government positions for more than ten years without committing any blunders. He was noted to have an exceptionally ready wit. Uchimaro commissioned statues of the Four Heavenly Kings and a version of Kannon and let his son Fuyutsugu offer them to K≈çfuku-ji. An anecdote in the Nihon K≈çki states that when Prince Osabe was crown prince, he bore ill will toward Uchimaro and tried to injure him.

He was a left-handed middle-order batsman, an infrequent legbreak and googly bowler and on occasion a wicketkeeper. He was born at Moss Side in Manchester and died at Lelant, Cornwall. Baker is recorded as playing for Warwickshire's second eleven in a non-first-class match in 1903. But he did not make his first team debut until the opening match of the 1905 season, when he established himself immediately with a score of 53 in the second innings of the game with Somerset. In only his fourth game, he scored 102 against Cambridge University. Though he did not make any further centuries in 1905, he retained his place in the side and totalled 956 runs at an average of 28.96. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack commented in its 1906 edition that he \\"showed capital form on many occasions\\", though it added that he was inclined to be a slow scorer. Baker remained as a regular member of the Warwickshire first team right up to the First World War, and including the surprise County Championship triumph of 1911. His best season in terms of his batting average was 1906, when his 848 runs came at an average of 40.38. He headed Warwickshire's averages in the wet summer of 1907 and Wisden noted that he was \\"now quite one of the best left handed batsmen in the country\\"; it added that \\"he at times erred on the side of over-caution, but he proved on several occasions the possession of ability to hit very hard indeed\\". In both 1907 and 1908 Baker failed by just a few runs to achieve 1,000 runs in the season, but his batting fell back in 1909 and he averaged only 18.60 in that season before returning to form in 1910, when he scored exactly 1000 runs. The runs in 1910 included an unbeaten innings of 155 in the match against Worcestershire, made out of a total of 292, and this proved to be highest score of his first-class career. Baker's part in Warwickshire's unexpected Championship victory in 1911 was a modest one, for he scored only 665 runs and was left out of the side for some matches in mid-season. He returned to better form in the wet summer of 1912 and in 1913 had his best season in terms of aggregate, scoring 1242 runs at an average of 33.56, and he passed 1000 runs again in the 1914 season. He returned to Warwickshire after the First World War, but had no success, appearing in two matches in each of the 1919 and 1920 seasons before retiring from first-class cricket. After retiring from first-class cricket, Baker became a cartoonist, working for the Daily Express newspaper. Baker settled in Cornwall and from 1925 to 1931 he played Minor Counties cricket for Cornwall as an amateur, often referred to in the scorecards of the time as \\"Mr C. Shaw Baker\\" and sometimes captaining the team. He ran a market garden at Lelant, near St Ives, where he died aged 93 in 1976.

Hermann Korb (1656, Niese (near L√ºgde) - 23 December 1735, Wolfenb√ºttel) was a German architect who worked mainly in the Principality of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel.  Life  Little is known of his early life. It is generally believed that he started as a carpenter and was inspired to teach himself architecture during a trip to Italy with his employer, Duke Anton Ulrich. It has also been reported that he was unable to draw, leaving the details to his assistants. All of this has been disputed. In 1689, he became the first Royal \\"Bauvogt\\" (Building Bailiff, or Inspector) in Wolfenb√ºttel then, in 1692, the \\"Bauverwalter\\" (Building Administrator), working in cooperation with the Landbaumeister (Master Builder) Johann Balthasar Lauterbach. Korb took over Lauterbach's duties after his death and completed many of his projects, which had languished because of his long illness. However, Korb wasn't officially promoted until 1704, when all of his work was being done from his own original designs. Construction proceeded at a fast pace during his 40-year tenure. Many of his structures no longer exist because, following practices that were common at the time, they were cheaply built, with wood panels designed to imitate sandstone, and quickly fell into disrepair. He retired in 1734 (possibly suffering from senility) and died the following year. Work His best-known works include: *The Schloss Salzdahlum (Begun by Lauterbach in 1688: completed by Korb in 1697). It was here that Frederick the Great married Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel-Bevern in 1733. It was dismantled in 1813. Pieces of it may still be seen at various sites throughout the city. *The original Brunswick Palace (Begun by Korb in 1718, but not finished until after his death). It was destroyed by fire in 1830 and rebuilt by Carl Theodor Ottmer. *Renovation of the Schloss Blankenburg. Korb was commissioned to convert the medieval castle into a Baroque-style residence. *The \\"Bibliotheksrotunde\\" at the Herzog August Library in Wolfenb√ºttel.

He took up a post at the Infirmary School of Medicine, Liverpool, and was surgeon of the Liverpool Royal Infirmary from 1877 to 1902, when he resigned and was appointed Consulting Surgeon. He died on 9 August 1904, while travelling, in Aix-la-Chapelle. He is buried in Toxteth Park Cemetery in Liverpool. Work \\"Mitchell Banks deserves recognition both as a surgeon and as an organizer. The modern operation for removal of the cancerous breast is largely due to his practice and advocacy. He recommended, in the face of strenuous opposition, an extensive operation that should include removal of the axillary glands when most surgeons were contented with local amputation. He drew attention to his method in 1878 and made it the topic of the Lettsomian Lectures at the Medical Society of London in 1900.\\" Banks describes his operation in the following manner, \\"Now having cleared out the axilla forty-one times, I have naturally come to know something about the state of the glands; and the first point was recognized of the fact that, until we have these glands in our hand and have split them open with a knife, we cannot tell whether they are infected or not. The usual fumbling in the axilla which is practised by surgeons tells nothing. When the glands are a big as walnuts, any first year's student, can tell they are infected; but there is a stage -the earlier stage- when there are certainly affected, and yet to touch through layers of skin fat, nothing amiss, can be felt. As a result of this, I came to the conclusion, about three years ago, that in every case where the breast is removed, the axilla should be cleared out as a necessary accomplainment; and this I beg to urge upon the meeting, The one operation is useless without the other. As you cannot tell whether the glands are infected or not, remove them and dissipate the doubt.\\"  Family  He was the father of Conservative Member of Parliament and County Court judge Sir Reginald Mitchell Banks.

Subsurface Textile Irrigation (SSTI) is a technology designed specifically for subsurface irrigation in all soil textures from desert sands to heavy clays. Use of SSTI will significantly reduce the usage of water, fertilizer and herbicide. It will lower on-going operational costs and, if maintained properly, will last for decades. By delivering water and nutrients directly to the root zone, plants are healthier and have a far greater yield. It is the only irrigation system that can safely use recycled water or treated water without expensive ‚Äúpolishing‚Äù treatment because water never reaches the surface. A typical subsurface textile irrigation system has an impermeable base layer (usually polyethylene or polypropylene), a drip line running along that base, a layer of geotextile on top of the drip line and, finally, a narrow impermeable layer on top of the geotextile (see diagram). Unlike standard drip irrigation, the spacing of emitters in the drip pipe is not critical as the geotextile moves the water along the fabric up to 2m from the dripper. SSTI is installed 15‚Äì20 cm below the surface for residential/commercial applications and 30‚Äì50 cm for agricultural applications. How SSTI Works A cross-sectional view of the wetting pattern provided by SSTI, as compared to drip irrigation. The systems rely on specific geotextiles to absorb the water from the drippers and to rapidly transport that water via mass flow and capillary action along the geotextile effectively turning those single drippers into billions of emitters. In essence, this enables intimate control of the speed of water delivery so that the capillary action of any soil can be matched (something that is virtually impossible for any other irrigation method including bare drip pipe below the surface). If the capillary action of the soil can be matched with the water delivery, only the minimal amount of water is needed to service the needs of the plants above (note that capillary forces draw water up from the water source to the roots of the plants). Shows the flow of water through an SSTI installation as compared to a drip irrigation system. To increase effectiveness, SSTI products should have an impermeable base layer to slow gravitational loss of water and to create an elliptical wetting pattern under the soil surface (see diagram). It should also have a small impermeable top layer to ensure that water from the dripper does not ‚Äútunnel‚Äù through the geotextile and up to the surface (again a common problem with bare subsurface drip pipe). The effect of these two layers is dramatic as it maximizes the spread of water through the geotextile (up to 10,000 times faster than a clay loam soil as tested by Charles Sturt University). When comparing SSTI with surface drip, using the same amount of water, SSTI can cover 2.5 times the volume of soil and takes six times longer to dry down until the next irrigation is required Recycled Water and Treated Effluent Recycled water can be used in SSTI systems as it will spread the nutrient load over 2-3 times the soil volume (compared to other irrigation methods). This means that additional nutrient requirements are minimized and the soil will have a long life without overloading other nutrients (especially phosphorus and potassium). A major benefit of SSTI is that treated effluent can be used but is prevented from reaching the surface. Recreational or agricultural activities can continue on the field during irrigation without the contaminants coming in contact with the public. Nutrients can be injected through all SSTI systems (fertigation). Macro and micro nutrients can be delivered to specific crops including grass, pasture, trees and vines. The nutrient is placed directly in the root zone so there is almost no wastage and no potential for run off into waterways. History =Use of Geotextiles= Geotextiles were used for capillary irrigation not long after World War II. However, it was not until 1995 that extensive research was conducted at the CSIRO Division of Land and Water in Griffith, Australia, by Grain Security Foundation Ltd, that SSTI was established as a serious commercial alternative to drip. Polyester geotextile of specific thickness and manufacture is required to ensure the system has the appropriate flow characteristics and so that it does not become hydrophobic (repels water). =Solving Typical Subsurface Problems= Summary Studies were done on many forms of geotextile using various dripper rates and configurations to evaluate water flow for the major soil texture types and to determine if SSTI had the same problems experienced by subsurface drip systems (SDI). Specifically, considerable focus was placed on the problem of root intrusion, tunnelling, dripper blockage and insect damage (serious problems associated with SDI). Root Intrusion Research data showed that roots could invade the geotextile but did not thrive nor thicken in the polyester geotextile and, therefore, caused no damage. The roots were deterred from entering the dripper area because that area is dry relative to the rest of the system. Roots simply went elsewhere. Tunneling Tunneling (the process whereby water works its way up to the surface) was nearly eliminated by the narrow reflective impermeable tape above the drip line. Blocked Drip Emitters Drippers are often blocked in bare drip systems due to soil lodging in the emitters and/or soil crusting around the emitters when the system is not operating. SSTI eliminates this problem because there is a physical barrier presented by the geotextile and due to the fact that the soil remains moist for much longer than drip systems (i.e. the soil does not form a crust anyway). Insects Similarly, insects are deterred from damaging SSTI systems because of the geotextile barrier. =Water Delivery= Initially solid, thick-walled drip pipes were used in trials at the CSIRO but subsequent trials between 1995 and 1998 demonstrated that drip tapes (thin-walled, flexible pipe) could be used very effectively. The loss of strength from using thin- walled drip tapes was countered by the additional tensile strength of the entire system (base layer, drip tape and geotextile). While significantly reducing the cost of SSTI, the use of drip tapes also permitted the use of large diameter drip lines (of up to 35mm) allowing for run lengths up to one (1) kilometre. The thin, flexible wall of drip tape also meant that master rolls of manufactured product could be much larger (over 600m in length). =Optimal Width and Wetting Patterns= The width of SSTI products varies based on the application. However, at the University of Queensland, Australia trials were conducted to discover the optimal width of the SSTI in black cracking clay with alfalfa sown across a single SSTI line. The SSTI line was 20 cm wide and was installed 30 cm below the surface. The alfalfa germinated directly above the SSTI line but covered 75 cm either side (a total of 1.5 m) in uniform lines. As a result of this research, most SSTI systems are between 6 cm and 20 cm wide. However, some products are up to 2 m wide. =Installation Technologies= In 1997 the first SSTI plow was tested at CSIRO Griffith using a standard three point linkage behind a tractor. This demonstrated that SSTI could be installed at 20‚Äì40 cm deep quickly and easily using the plow. SSTI plows are now available to install 1, 2 or 3 lines (more lines are possible). =Other Uses of SSTI= In 1996 the first ebb and flow mat technology for potted plants was commercialized based on SSTI technology using drip tapes to control the water delivery. This ebb and flow mat form of SSTI proved very effective in producing potted plants, sprouted wheat and barley for animal production and for research purposes in producing seed varieties without the use of any overhead irrigation. It also provided an effective fertilizer delivery platform. Components Well-designed SSTI systems are laid out essentially the same as drip systems but in many cases SSTI can be laid in a ‚Äúserpentine‚Äù pattern vastly reducing the number of take- off connections and potential leaks. Most drip tubes/tapes used in SSTI are pressure compensating. For example, using a 16mm drip tape, a run of up to 180 m can be achieved from one connection. Longer runs of up to 1,000 m can be achieved using lower flow rates per lineal metre and/or larger diameter drip tape. The following components make up a typical SSTI installation: * Pump or pressurized water source to 100-300kPa (14-43psi) * Water filters or filtration system from 120 micron with suspended solids less than 30ppm * Fertigation injector systems * Back flow prevention * Pressure regulating valves * Main line. Can be LDPE or PVC * Solenoid valves or gate valves to control water flow * SSTI system laterals * Barbed or Spinlock fittings with stainless steel clips * Flushing valves at the end of laterals or combined laterals into a flushing line so that regular flushing can remove suspended solids or bacteria that may build up when using recycled water Using drip tapes in SSTI means that there is a wide range of commercial fittings making SSTI very easy to install. Fittings are usually spinlock or ringlock devices securing the drip tape using a barb. Performance of SSTI =Advantages of SSTI= The advantages of SSTI are: * SSTI is a ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù solution if maintained properly. The components are inert and, given that they are situated below the ground, are not subject to the effects of weather, animals, machinery, vandals or other terrestrial conditions. * Water savings of 50-75% compared with overhead systems * Low pressure requirement (also means lower power requirements) * Yields can be improved up to four (4) times in certain crops * Minimal root intrusion to drippers in the SSTI with a deflective tape on top * No emitter blockage due to crusting * Minimal effect of evaporation * Safe use of recycled or treated water * Can use the field (for recreation or agriculture) while irrigation is running * Weed growth is minimized because the water does not reach the surface (saving herbicide cost). Germination of weeds only occurs during rainfall. * Fertigation can be done directly to the root zone (saving fertilizer cost) * Efficient distribution of nutrients to the entire root zone * Broad wetting patterns (moisture covers the entire root zone) * Water delivery can match the natural capillary rates in soil so saturation is minimized * Soil moisture can maintained at field capacity (minimised gravitational losses) * No surface run off * Soil erosion is minimized * Fields do not have to be perfectly level * Fields with irregular shapes can be accommodated * Distance between lines of SSTI is far greater than drip (lower number of solenoids and other components compared to sprinklers and drip). * SSTI laterals can be ploughed in behind a tractor on large sites (over 10,000 m per day) * Foliage remains dry (fungal and bacterial leaf disease is minimized) =Disadvantages of SSTI= The disadvantages of SSTI are: * Initial capital cost is typically more than overhead irrigation * Quality installation is critical. If mistakes made, they are difficult to find. * Installation using correct fittings must be done * Regular maintenance is required to ensure long life * Automated control and monitoring systems are preferable (subsurface irrigation does not give any visual indicators to show if it is working or not) * SSTI is usually not UV- treated so it must be kept out of sunlight until it is installed under the surface * Temporary overhead watering may be required to establish turf in hot areas * Germination of some agricultural crops may require overhead watering if insufficient rainfall * SSTI cannot apply fertilizers or herbicides overhead on the surface * Rodents may damage the system (although less than drip systems) Further reading * Kirby, .J.M., Smiles, D.E., Knight, J.H.

A lattice path may lie in any lattice in \\\\mathbb{R}^d , but the integer lattice \\\\mathbb{Z}^d is most commonly used. An example of a lattice path in \\\\mathbb{Z}^2 of length 5 with steps in S = \\\\lbrace (2,0), (1,1), (0,-1) \\\\rbrace is L = \\\\lbrace (-1,-2), (0,-1), (2,-1), (2,-2), (2,-3), (4,-3) \\\\rbrace . North-East lattice paths A North-East (NE) lattice path is a lattice path in \\\\mathbb{Z}^2 with steps in S = \\\\lbrace (0,1), (1,0) \\\\rbrace . The (0,1) steps are called North steps and denoted by N 's; the (1,0) steps are called East steps and denoted by E 's. NE lattice paths most commonly begin at the origin. This convention allows us to encode all the information about a NE lattice path L in a single permutation word. The length of the word gives us the number of steps of the lattice path, k . The order of the N 's and E 's communicates the sequence of L . Furthermore, the number of N 's and the number of E 's in the word determines the end point of L . If the permutation word for a NE lattice path contains n N steps and e E steps, and if the path begins at the origin, then the path necessarily ends at (e,n) . This follows because you have \\"walked\\" exactly n steps North and e steps East from (0,0) . center Counting lattice paths Lattice paths are often used to count other combinatorial objects. Similarly, there are many combinatorial objects that count the number of lattice paths of a certain kind. This occurs when the lattice paths are in bijection with the object in question. For example, * Dyck paths are counted by the n^{\\\\text{th}} Catalan number C_n . A Dyck path is a lattice path in \\\\mathbb{Z}^2 from (0,0) to (2n,0) with steps in S = \\\\lbrace (1,1), (1,-1) \\\\rbrace that never passes below the x-axis. Equivalently, a Dyck path is a NE lattice path from (0,0) to (n,n) that lies strictly below (but may touch) the diagonal y=x . * The Schr√∂der numbers count the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (n,n) with steps in (1,0), (0,1) and (1,1) that never rise above the diagonal y=x . * The number of NE lattice paths from (0,0) to (a,b) counts the number of combinations of a objects out of a set of a + b objects. Combinations and NE lattice paths NE lattice paths have close connections to the number of combinations, which are counted by the binomial coefficient, and arranged in Pascal's triangle. The diagram below demonstrates some of these connections. center The number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (n,k) is equal to the binomial coefficient \\\\binom{n+k}{n} . The diagram shows this for 0 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n =4 . If one rotates the diagram 135¬∞ clockwise about the origin and extend it to include all n,k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\cup \\\\lbrace 0 \\\\rbrace , one obtains Pascal's triangle. This result is no surprise, because the k^{\\\\text{th}} entry of the n^{\\\\text{th}} row of Pascal's Triangle is the binomial coefficient \\\\binom{n}{k} . =Problems and proofs= The graphical representation of NE lattice paths lends itself to many bijective proofs involving combinations. Here are a few examples. * \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\binom{n}{k} ^2 = \\\\binom{2n}{n} . Proof: The right-hand side is equal to the number of NE lattice paths from (0,0) to (n,n) . Each of these NE lattice paths intersects exactly one of the lattice points in the rectangular array with coordinates (x, n-x) for x \\\\in \\\\lbrace 0, 1, \\\\ldots, n \\\\rbrace . This is shown in the figure below for n=4 : Every NE lattice path from (0,0) to (4,4) intersects exactly one of the colored nodes. center On the left-hand side, the binomial coefficient squared, \\\\binom{n}{k}^2, represents two copies of the set of NE lattice paths from (0,0) to (k,n-k) attached endpoint to start point. Rotate the second copy 90¬∞ clockwise. This does not change the combinatorics of the object: \\\\binom{n}{k} = \\\\binom{n}{n-k} . So the total number of lattice paths remains the same. center Superimpose the NE lattice paths squared onto the same rectangular array, as seen in the figure below. We see that all NE lattice paths from (0,0) to (n,n) are accounted for. In particular, notice that any lattice path passing through the red lattice point (for example) is counted by the squared set of lattice paths (also shown in red). \\\\Box center References Category:Enumerative combinatorics ","title":"Lattice path"},{"id":"42123349","text":"Benihana of Tokyo, Inc. v.

Benihana, Inc., 906 A.2d 114 (Del. 2006) The court held that a Board's approval of an issuance and purchase of preferred stock was a valid exercise of its business judgment under Delaware law.Del. Code Ann. title 8, ¬ß¬ß 144(a)(1), 102(b)(3). Facts Benihana of Tokyo owned approximately 51% of Benihana, Inc. The latter was having financial difficulties and its directors approved an issuance of $20 million of preferred stock. A company called BFC bought the stock in a deal that was negotiated by a Benihana director. The same Benihana director was also a principal owner of BFC. After the directors approved the stock sale, Benihana of Tokyo disagreed with the sale and purchase and filed a derivative lawsuit against the directors. = Procedural facts = Benihana of Tokyo sued Benihana, arguing the directors had breached their fiduciary duty by allowing a director to negotiate the deal, when he had an interest acting for both the buying and selling parties. The trial court held for the directors, stating that the board knew that the director was a principal of BFC, but that the board was not informed that the director had negotiated the deal on behalf of BFC. The trial court also found that the decision was within the bounds of the business judgment rule. =Issue= There were two prominent issues in this case. The first was whether the directors breached their fiduciary duties in allowing a director with conflicting interests to be involved in the deal. The second was whether there was a safe harbor in the business judgment rule. Judgment The appellate court affirmed the lower court's decisions. The appellate court applied Delaware law, which provided safe harbor for an interested transaction. The law states, \\"the material facts as to the director's relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the board of directors, and the board in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by an affirmative vote of the majority of the disinterested directors.\\" Del. Code Section 144(a)(1). Benihana of Tokyo argued that this law was not applicable because the directors did not know that the director negotiated the deal. Ultimately, the appellate court found that because the directors spent significant time on the process of making their decision, and because the transaction was a fair deal that was approved by a majority of disinterested directors, it was covered by the business judgment rule.

The siege ended with the capitulation and the withdrawal of the Spanish after much unrest in the garrison. The liberation of the city of Rheinberg was the commencement of Maurice's campaign of 1597, a successful offensive against the Spaniards during the period known as the Ten Glory Years.Israel pg 29-30Naphy pg 95 Maurice of Orange Background The fortified town of Rheinberg, which had been in the possession of the Electorate of Cologne, had been garrisoned by the Spanish for seven years after the place was finally taken by Peter Ernst I von Mansfeld on 3 February 1590 after a four-year siege. In mid 1597, the government at The Hague with improved funding ordered a new campaign for Maurice of Orange, the commander of the Dutch and English troops, to oust the Spanish in Twente while they had been preoccupied with the Siege of Amiens.Wagenaar pg 470 Maurice's objective was to march along the Rhine and take the towns of Rheinberg and Meurs along the river, then head directly through the east of the Netherlands, where Grol and Oldenzaal being the strongest cities. The conquest of Rheinberg was important for Gelderland as it would increase the isolation of Spanish bases in the rest of Overijssel. On the 4th of August Maurice along with his cousin (and brother-in-law) William Louis arrived at Arnhem with a force of seven thousand infantry and twelve hundred cavalry. This included thirteen ensigns of English troops under Colonel Horace Vere and ten ensigns of Scots under Sir Henry Balfour.Knight, Charles Raleigh: Historical records of The Buffs, East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot) formerly designated the Holland Regiment and Prince George of Denmark's Regiment. Vol I. London, Gale & Polden, 1905, p. 45 Horace's brother Francis Vere was at this time governor of Brill and general of Elizabeth I's forces in the Netherlands and this meant Horace was temporarily in the field.Markham pg. 272 Siege & Aftermath After reducing the town and castle of Alphen, Maurice marched to Rheinberg arriving there on 10 August and immediately attacked. The Spanish garrison of Rheinberg consisted of 850 men under the command of Camilo Sachino who had held many governing positions in the region for many years. The garrison though was not in a fit state to fight having had many desertions through lack of pay and many were unwilling to fight. The Dutch and English army had access to a large quantity of artillery, which had landed via barges from the Rhine. On 11 August 1597 approaches were dug towards the city's walls as the siege commenced. William Louis of Nassau was wounded by a bullet in the thigh and Maurice not long after had a cannonball fly just over his head as it entered his tent while in repose. Once the batteries were placed, the city was intensively shelled which added to the misery of the garrison. After ten days of shelling the Sachino afraid of a mutiny in the garrison called for negotiations and then surrendered on 20 August; the Archbishop of Rheinberg begged for the place and the populace to be spared from pillaging which Maurice agreed to. The Spanish garrison, who were allowed the honors of war but were not to fight for a long time, then marched out and the Dutch and English marched in. With the capture of Rheinberg Maurice knew that access over the Rhine was now an easy task and the East of the Netherlands was now open to him. Maurice's troops were thus able to take the offensive further and capture Meurs, Groenlo, Bredevoort, Enschede, Oldenzaal, and closed off the year and the campaign with the capture of Lingen.

The Spanish occupation under Commander Don Luis Bernardo de Avila would last only till 1601 when Maurice again captured Rheinberg after a siege of more than a month.

A Christian establishment was first made here around 540 AD. The parish lands were often raided by Irish, Viking, Norman and English forces in the years that followed. The church was allowed to fall into ruins during the period when the Catholic Church was penalized in Ireland. Location The ruined parish church stands at the northern end of the lake named Finn Lough or Fenloe. The name \\"Tomfinlough\\" means Tomb or Tumulus of the Fair Lake. It is in the barony of Bunratty Lower in County Clare, about northwest of the village of Six-Mile- Bridge. The parish contains the village of Ardsallis. The parish contains the following townlands: Ayleacotty, Ballycar, Boheraroan, Caherkine, Caherscooby, Carrowmeer, Carrownakilly, Finlough, Granaghan, Granaghan Beg, Granaghan More, Kilnacrandy, Langough, Mausnarylaan, Mooghaun North, Mooghaun South, Muckanagh (Butler), Muckanagh (Studdert), Muckanagh (Vandeleur), Newmarket, Rathlaheen North, Rathlaheen South and Snugborough. History Tuamfinlough is the oldest known settlement in the region of Newmarket-on-Fergus. Tomfinlough is said to have been founded by Saint Luchtighern mac-ui-Trato, a contemporary of Saint Mac Creiche who lived around 540, and probably belonged to the Trataidhe tribe. When the forces of Connaught were plundering the district of Corcomroe, the people sent a deputation to Emly. They asked Saint Ailbhe to persuade Saint MacCreiche, their relative, to return and plead for them with the king of Connaught. Mac Chreiche agreed, and came with his disciple Manch√≠n. On the way they stopped at Tomfinlough where Luightighern agreed to accompany them. The lands of Trataidhe were both fertile and vulnerable, and were often raided. The Danes destroyed the original church in 944. In 1854 a hoard of buried treasure hidden in a small stone chamber was unearthed in the Mooghaun North townland during the construction of the Limerick and Ennis Railway. It included many valuable gold items, including three gorgets that were given to the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy, and many rings, bracelets and other items. The total weight was over . Most of the treasure was sold to private bidders. It may have been booty collected by the Danes and buried after they were defeated by Brian Boroimhe (died 1014). According to the Annals of the Four Masters, the abbot Scannlan died in 944, and the lecturer Tuathal O‚ÄôMuirgheasa died in 1049. In 1054 Torlogh O‚ÄôBrien and the Connacians raided Thomond and sacked Tuaimfionlocha. The church was closed during the Penal Law period. In 1744 the High Sheriff for Clare, John Westropp, reported to the authorities that, \\"I have according to your instructions made strict search in Ennis and in several other places where we had the least suspicion of priests and had the army from Clarecastle to assist me - but could find none. We have locked and nailed up all the Mass houses.\\" After the laws were relaxed, Tomfinlough became part of the Catholic parish of Newmarket-on-Fergus which also contains the civil parishes of Bunratty, Clonloghan, Drumline, Kilconry, Kilmaleery and Kilnasoolagh. In 1856 the parish was also part of a Church of Ireland deanery named Tradrai'gha, which included the parishes of Bunratty, Clonloghan, Drumline, Feenagh, Kilconry, Kilmaleery, Kilnasoolagh, Killowen, Tomfinlough and the island of Inis-da-dhrom. Church The old church of Tomfinlough incorporates portions that are extremely old with more modern changes and additions. Large blocks of limestone in the southwest of the site are traces of a pre-Norman building which could date to the 10th century. Around 1300 the de Clare family restored the church and added at least two sandstone windows to the south and east walls. The building was restored again around 1480, and a new limestone-cut window was inserted in the east wall. The church in 1839 measured , with walls high and thick. There was a pointed doorway in the west gable high and wide. The lower of the gable seemed much older than the rest of the gable. The church had another door in the south side, and several windows, some divided into two, of different ages. One of the windows was decorated in the interior with carved human heads, much weathered. Another window appeared to date to at least the first part of the 10th century. In July 1907 the north wall of the ruined \\"old Abbey of Fenloe\\" collapsed. Other remains There is a holy well near the church, where stations were still performed in 1839. In 1839 a section of wall high and long stood about to the southeast of the church. It had large cut stones at its ends, like the angles of a house gable, and a doorway in the center high measured from ground level as it then was. The doorway was wide at the top and wide at the foot. This seems to have been the west end or gable of an ancient church. Above the doorway there were three human heads sculpted in stone. The middle one was very badly weathered but the other heads still preserved their features. These Romanesque heads may date to the 15th century. This would mean that the earlier building, identified as Saint Luchtighern's oratory, was renovated around this time, when the church was also renovated. The heads are still visible, but have been re-arranged so the central head is now one that is in good condition. A traditional story tells of Luchtigern curing a woman inflicted by the plague, who came to him when he was working in the field at Tomfinlough with two deacons. One of the deacons was greatly impressed, and attributed the cure to God working through the saint. The other was skeptical. Luchtigern carved three faces on a stone, representing himself and the deacons, and said that heaven would show who was right. Soon the face of the skeptic was worn away, while the other two faces remained. There is a stone in the Tomfinlough graveyard wall with two raised solid circles on its face, about six inches in diameter. On has a rounded face and other a flat face with a small cross roughly engraved on it. It is called the \\"plague stone\\", and is associated with the legend.

Discovery  The mace was found by Cecil Mallaby Firth during the 1910‚Äì11 season of excavations in Sayala in Grave 1 of Cemetery 137. The grave, which probably belonged to the local ruler, had already been plundered, but still contained many grave goods, which had been crammed into one corner of the grave. These consisted of stone and ceramic artefacts: a rose quartz head of a lion, a cosmetic palette, copper chisels and hatchets, and the remnants of two ceremonial maces. The maceheads in breccia or rose quartz survived, as well as the gold plating of the lost wooden handle. Both sets of gold plating had horizontal ribbing on the lower part. There was no other decoration on one of the sets of gold plating, but that of the Sayala Mace had detailed images of animals (see below). Firth made the grave and its contents known in a preliminary report of 1911. In this publication he included the first sketch of the mace.Cecil M.

She strived to inspire young women to take on leadership roles within the democracy using the written word. She wrote many books, plays, articles, and poems relating to her cause. Her parents were Judge M. Buck and Annie Buck. She lived out most of her life after college in Poughkeepsie, New York with close friend and colleague, Laura Wylie. The two were rumored to be lovers. She never married or had any children. Buck dedicated her life to \\"challenging the patriarchal paradigm with her reformist views of pedagogy and rhetoric\\". Education As part of a new generation of women that had the opportunity to attend college, Buck graduated from the University of Michigan with a bachelor of science in 1884, a Master of Science in 1895, and a PhD in Rhetoric and Composition in 1898. Buck was the first student of Michigan's Fred Newton Scott to receive a PhD in this field. During the time before receiving her PhD, Buck taught composition classes at Indianapolis High School and Detroit Normal Training School before taking a position at Vassar College in 1897. At Vassar, Buck taught a variety of courses including rhetorical theory, literary criticism, composition, argument, poetics, English lyric poetry, and drama. She published a thesis on the psychology of rhetoric, a dissertation on the metaphor, several textbooks on composition for use in her classes, a book on literary criticism, a variety of articles on rhetoric and other topics, and many poems and plays. In her many years as a scholar and teacher, she developed specific views on language, the composing process, and the implications of psychology on the study of rhetoric. Buck taught at Vassar for twenty four years leading up to her death in 1922. Dissertation and thesis Gertrude Buck's thesis, completed for her Master's degree, was on the metaphor. Her approach is mostly psychological, describing metaphors as a result of primitive human behavior that confuses different things as the same. However, she states that the civilized human is able to immediately distinguish between the two items. The poetic metaphor, then, is a representation of the primitive perception of two different items as the same which are known to be inherently different. Buck also felt strongly about the contemporary trends in the teaching of language and writing. She criticized the way grammar was taught to students - especially sentence structure. She believed that the way in which sentence structure was taught did not take into account the mental processes of the listener and speaker. Buck was known for her, as worded by Gerald Mulderig, her amoeba and tree diagrams - diagrams that described the process of composition in reference to the splitting of amoebas in individual sentences and the creation of complex sentences as branches of a tree. It is important to recognize that Buck rejected sentence structuring and diagramming, and believed the creation of sentences was a natural and organic, based on the mental processes of the creator. She stressed the importance of the rhetorical situation as \\"a real occasion for writing and a real audience to be addressed\\". Students, she thought, become more focused on following the rules of sentence diagramming than genuinely communicating - thus, Buck attempted to guide students away from the rules that govern their day-to-day thinking so they might be free to discover language as communication. Student-centered pedagogy Although her published contributions were significant, Buck's main goal was the reconstruction of pedagogy within the English Department at Vassar College. She rejected the educational traditions of the time such as grammar rules and sentence structure and advocated for a \\"student-centered pedagogy\\" which emphasized individuality in order to create intelligent students who could ably participate in democracy. Buck's ideas of contemporary pedagogy began during her days at Detroit Normal Training School, where she worked closely with Harriet M. Scott to enforce a curriculum that catered to the interests of individual students rather than premeditated themes and topics. As she continued her teaching career at Vassar College, Buck, with the accompaniment of Laura Wylie, embraced women's rights and attempted to empower female students to take on roles in leadership and thinking through her own pedagogical ideals. Gertrude Buck's ideas on rhetoric and pedagogy paved the way for today's New Rhetoricians. Although her contributions may have been historically overlooked, her ideas about education and a student-centered approach to teaching are fundamental to the way in which we educate students today. Reform movements Naturally, Buck contributed to other movements aside from educational reform such as the suffrage and Little Theater movements. She \\"prompted Vassar students to consider women in a positive and powerful light and to envision themselves in ways that extend beyond the domestic sphere\\". Plus, she believed participation in theater prepared female students for participation in democracy. In light of this, Buck initiated the dramatic workshop at Vassar College, which is said to be one of her most substantial accomplishments. The dramatic workshop eventually became the Poughkeepsie Community Theatre in 1920. Buck's own plays were sometimes performed there and often brought to attention the gender and class assumptions of society and featured strong female characters. Contribution to rhetoric Buck was famous for her short essay \\"The Present Status of Rhetorical Theory.\\" Interpreting the insights by pre-Socratic sophists, Buck denoted sophistic rhetoric as violent and manipulative with less regard to listeners as she called it as ‚Äúpurely predatory-primitive aggression to the weak.\\" The art of rhetoric is the art of war.‚Äù Buck echoed rhetoric as ‚Äúa real communication between speaker and hearer, to the equal advantage of both, and thus a real function of the social organism.\\" Buck's notion was aligned with the idea of Platonic for imposing the egalitarian position of a speaker and hearers to reach their communicative goals. Buck‚Äôs works are groundbreaking for the establishment for ethics in feminist rhetoric as they interrupted the western tradition which has been dominated by male cultural practices and the binary concepts of ‚Äúargument as male and narrative as female.\\" This essentialism of women characteristics becomes antithetical to democratic values that Buck attempted to break in her era which became the beginning of Feminism move.

Early life He has been educated in both Egypt and Canada, and speaks both Arabic and English. Originally from, Cairo, Egypt, Alimam currently splits his time between Cairo, Egypt and Quebec, Canada. Past Projects Alimam has gained notoriety in recent months for his controversial short film, Libido. Libido follows the life of Mazen, a young Egyptian trying to deal with his sexuality, something that is very taboo in Egypt. He created the film as a final graduation project at the High Cinema Institute in Cairo, Egypt. When interviewed about Libido by Global Voices Online, Alimam said, \\"I was thinking I wanted to talk about the subject because I myself thought about this a lot as a kid. I did not receive proper sex education in my school, and my curiosity was just like any other kid, so I thought it would be very interesting to finally ask the questions myself for the first time when I was 20. Then, I started researching, until I finally came up with the whole concept of the movie, and how it shall be made.\\" Alimam released the film over the internet, reaching people far and wide. By doing so, young people across not only the Middle East, but everywhere could watch and relate to something natural, yet discouraged. Since releasing Libido, Alimam has created a second short film entitled, Speed of Light. It is an 8-minute sci-fi film which Alimam describes as, \\"very different from Libido.\\" Speed of Light was selected in six different official festivals, premiering at the Dubai Film Festival. Next, it will be screened at the LA Shorts Fest. Current Project Alimam studied sound engineering at Recording Arts Canada, and is now recording his first album, which he plans to release on YouTube under the name MAYET NAR. In English, the album is called \\"Sulphuric acid.\\" The title is a metaphor about emotional destruction and when translated according to the artist, it references \\"water on fire\\".

In 2014, astronomers found that the X-rays being emitted are coming from a region inside the accretion disk located about three times the radius of the event horizon. This implies that the black hole must be spinning incredibly fast to allow the disk to survive at such a small radius. The measurement of the black hole's rotation is the first time astronomers have been able to directly measure the rotational speed of any black hole. This determination was made by a team led by Rubens Reis of the University of Michigan using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton telescopes. The team observed the X-rays generated in the innermost regions of the disk circling and feeding the black hole that powers the quasar. By measuring the radius of the disk, the astronomers were able to calculate the black hole's rotational speed, which was almost half the speed of light. The rapid spin of the quasar indicates that the black hole is being fed by a vast supply of gas and dust. However, the measurements would not have been possible without a rare alignment of the quasar and a giant elliptical galaxy (which is itself part of a cluster of other galaxies in line with the quasar) which lies between Earth and RX J1131-1231. This line-up provided a quadruple gravitational lens which magnified the light coming from the quasar. The strong gravitational lensing effect associated with RX J1131-1231 has also produced measured time delays; that is, in one image the lensed quaser will be observed before the other image.

Her prints were included in the publication Fine Prints of the Year during the 1930s.  Background and Career  Clara Gardner Mairs was born on January 5, 1878 in Hastings, Minnesota to Abigail and Samuel Mairs. Her grandfather, Stephen Gardner, built the first grain mill in Dakota County on the Vermillion River. Her father, Samuel Mairs, died in 1891 and Abigail moved a 13-year-old Clara and her three younger siblings, Sam, Helen, and Agnes to St. Paul, Minnesota. Clara attended the Mount Vernon Junior College and Seminary in Washington D.C. from 1895 to 1897. She also trained at the St. Paul School of art, a branch of the St Paul Institute. In the 1910s she attended the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and studied with impressionist landscape painter Daniel Garber. Mairs returned to St. Paul by 1918 and supervised the Nimbus Club, an informal art group formed to allow artists to work from a live model. She was also instrumental in founding the Art League of St. Paul, which met in the then defunct St. Paul School of Art's auditorium. Through these groups, Mairs met a young artist named Clement Haupers. Though he was 22 years younger than her, the two would become lifelong companions. They held two- person exhibits at local art galleries and entered many of the same art shows. In 1923, Mairs and Haupers traveled to Paris where they studied sculpture with Antoine Bourdelle at the Acad√©mie Colarossi and painting with Andr√© Lhote at the Acad√©mie Montparnasse. Mairs also briefly attended the Acad√©mie Julian. The pair toured Italy and spent a winter in Algiers before returning to Minnesota in 1925. They later frequented the Kettle River in Pine County, and created paintings of the people and landscape. Mairs then turned her artistic energy towards printmaking before she and Haupers returned to Paris in 1928. She began experimenting with etching techniques and was influenced by Jean Lur√ßat's gros point panels. Her visits to the zoo inspired tapestries depicting white gibbons and zebras. Beginning in Paris and influenced by her earlier work in textile design, Mairs created colorful five-by-six-foot wall hangings. Mairs' print Leaping Leopards was reproduced in Fine Prints of the Year 1930. That same year her print Three Ring Circus earned an honorable mention at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts's Minneapolis and St. Paul Artists exhibition. Mairs' etchings were also included in Fine Prints of the Year in both 1932 and 1938. She was a member of the Minnesota Artists Association. She won awards at the Minnesota State Fair in 1925, 1926, 1931, 1933, 1936, and 1950. Mairs' early works featured soft-ground etching, a process she often combined with aquatint. The etching process created textured masses and gave her lines a grainy quality. Mairs died on May 24, 1963.

He made significant contributions to the field of Search and Rescue and was an outspoken advocate for wilderness safety.  Early life  Jones supervises helicopter rescue training Order of BC Directing SAR operations Helicopter rescue supervision Dog rescue Jones and his ambulance Timothy Edmund Jones was born on May 30, 1956, in Edmonton, Alberta, the youngest of three children. His father, Owen, was an attorney and his mother, Mary, a homemaker. The family moved to North Vancouver in 1962, settling in a home at the bottom of Grouse Mountain. There Jones explored logging trails, canyons and creeks with his brother, Owen Jr. This was the start of his love of the mountains that inspired him in his later years. In high school, Jones played football at Handsworth Secondary School in North Vancouver and eventually went to Simon Fraser University on a sports scholarship. After graduating with a BA in Geography, he was drafted into the Canadian Football League by the Toronto Argonauts in 1978, but a knee injury in preseason ended his professional football career. At 24, Jones returned to Vancouver. Shortly after returning his father died and he stayed home with his mother to offer support. Jones went on to earn a teaching degree at SFU. He became a substitute physical education and geography teacher in North Vancouver, and helped coach high school football teams. In 1981, Jones met his wife to be, Lindsay, while on a ski trip to Mount Baker. In 1984 they were married. Their son Curtis was born in 1986, followed by their daughter Taylor in 1989. The Jones family resided in North Vancouver, British Columbia. His son, Curtis, became a member of the North Shore rescue team in 2004.  Paramedic  Shortly after becoming a substitute teacher, Jones started working part-time with the British Columbia Ambulance Service. Since part-timers were required to be on-call, he sometimes spent nights sleeping at the station so he would not be late for a call. Jones progressed to working full-time as a paramedic in the Downtown Eastside. While raising a young family and working night shifts, Jones completed several advanced training certifications. He became an advanced life-support paramedic and, in 1990, was appointed unit chief in North Vancouver where he remained until his death in 2014.  North Shore Rescue  Jones started with the all volunteer North Shore Rescue team as a resource member in the early 1990s, assisting the team in his role as an advanced life support paramedic. Once he became a member of the team, he recognized the need for a professional and well equipped service on the north shore and across the province and started to fundraise and advocate for the change. In his efforts building the search and rescue team, Jones would often work 50 hours a week in addition to his paid job as a paramedic. Through his work as a search and rescue team member, Jones saved over 1600 lives in his decades of service. Additionally, he was instrumental in North Shore Rescue becoming the first British Columbia search and rescue team to implement the Helicopter Flight Rescue System also known as HETS. He was also involved with building a communications system, fundraising for several rescue vehicles and a rescue base. Through his work with the media, Jones advocated for search and rescue volunteers across the province. Jones lobbied government for adequate funding and recognition of its volunteers. In 2014 the federal government of Canada recognized Jones in the budget by dedicating a national search and rescue volunteer tax credit in his name.  Awards  Jones received numerous awards and honours for his service to the community, among them were: * Inducted into the 2014 Simon Fraser University Clan Sports Hall of Fame under the Terry Fox Honorary Category. He is the only person other than Fox himself to so recognized. * Federal Tax Credit for search and rescue volunteers in Canada named in his honour * The Order of British Columbia * Honorary Doctor of Laws from Capilano University * The Queens Diamond Jubilee Medal  Death  On January 19, 2014, Jones died from a sudden cardiac arrest while hiking down from the North Shore Rescue team cabin on Mount Seymour. He was accompanied by his daughter and a teammate who both attempted to resuscitate him. Thousands of emergency services personnel and members of the community attended a parade and ceremony held in his honour. Both the Premier of British Columbia and the Prime Minister sent condolences which were read at the ceremony. At the end of the ceremony his ashes were taken away by the helicopter that he flew on many rescue missions. Following his death, members of the community suggested naming the second peak of Seymour after Jones. Shortly after this bivouac.com, an online database, changed the name to Tim Jones Peak. With the backing of local politicians, a strong movement has now formed to officially name the peak.

Life  Bernatzik was the brother of the constitutional law teacher Edmund Bernatzik. Initially a law student at his father's request, he studied at the Special School for Landscape Painting at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna under Eduard Peithner von Lichtenfels from 1873 to 1875. In 1875, he received the Golden F√ºger-Medal and studied at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf until 1878. Finally, he finished his training in Paris with L√©on Bonnat. In 1880 he joined the Vienna K√ºnstlerhaus. He painted The Vision of St Bernhard in 1882 in Heiligenkreuz Abbey, having been attracted by the mood of the Gothic place. At the 1894 World Exhibition in Antwerp, he won a medal (second class). In 1897 he was a founding member of the Vienna Secession, and served as the group's president in 1902-03. With the art critic Julius Meier-Graefe he organised a successful Impressionist exhibition in Vienna in 1903. Together with the group around Gustav Klimt, he left the Secession in 1905. He died in Hinterbr√ºhl in his brother Marx's house. He was buried in Hinterbr√ºhl cemetery. In 1907, the Galerie Miethke in Vienna held a retrospective exhibition on his life.  Style  Bernatzik was primarily a landscape painter, taking motifs from Vienna and Lower Austria and preferring to paint en plein air. During his time in Paris, he absorbed Impressionist tastes. However, he also created genre paintings, including processions in landscapes and symbolic images. He was one of the art's main representatives in Vienna at the turn of the century.

In 1847 the fort was sold to Mormon settlers, along with livestock and the surrounding area for $1,950. In the 1850s the cabin was sold and moved. It was moved several more times during the next 50 years to various locations along Washington Avenue in Ogden. In 1919 it was donated to the Daughters of Utah Pioneers, and was displayed on a parade float. It was then moved to a location behind Fire Station #3 (also on Washington Avenue). In 1928 it was moved to Tabernacle Square next to the Daughters of Utah Pioneers Museum. The Goodyear Cabin was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. The submission paperwork notes that the roof is not original, and some of the logs were replaced after they had rotted. During 1994-95 the cabin was refurbished.

History Almost nothing is known about who built the castle or when it was originally built. It first appears in the historical record in 1329 in the possession of the Freiherren von Weissenburg. It was then acquired by the Lords of T√ºdingen (Duedingen) and in 1356 became the center of their Herrschaft of Mannenberg- Laubegg. In 1378 the Lord of D√ºdingen sold the lands and castles to Fribourg following an uprising. After the Battle of Sempach in 1386, Bern conquered the Simmen river valley (Simmental) and acquired Zweisimmen. The Bernese bailiff over the upper Simmen valley was installed at Blankenburg Castle. Blankenburg Castle remained the political center of the Obersimmental district through the 1798 French invasion and the Act of Mediation in 1803. It remained the capital until the district was dissolved in 2009. In 1767 most of the medieval castle burned to the ground. Niklaus Hebler was appointed to rebuild the historic castle. He used the medieval foundation but built an entirely new building. It now forms an L-shaped building with a two-story corps-de-logis or main building, flanked by a single one-story wing. The front of the building is dominated by a double, covered staircase which is similar to the staircase at the Town Hall of Bern. The front of the building has a raised courtyard with a nearby horse barn. The south side of the castle is raised over the surrounding gardens.Burgenweg.ch accessed 5 March 2014 Following the administrative reforms in the Canton of Bern at the end of 2009, the castle was no longer needed by the cantonal government or courts. In December 2010 it was announced that the Canton would sell the castle to the Interessengemeinschaft Schloss Blankenburg for 1.25 million CHF. The association converted it into a meeting and reception center and planned to convert the prison cells into a small kitchen and restaurant.

History The initial plans for this building were elaborated in 1937 by the office for urban renewal (Risanamento) of the Rione Carit√† of Naples. They planned to install one large building, housing the Bank of Italy, in the area between via Medina and the Piazza del Municipio, that by 1939 had been cleared of a number of older buildings and palaces. However the project was suspended during the second World War, and in 1949, a new competition for new plans was awarded to the firms of De Lieto and Ferrobeton, with their respective designers, Marcello Canino and Arnaldo Foschini, in charge of the project. They scaled down the project to two independent buildings for the site, although both have a similar style to each other. The Bank of Italy palace was completed in 1957. Description The building occupies an area enclosed by the Piazza Municipio, Via Cervantes, Via dell'Incoronata, and the Mercato dei Grani. The composition is characterized by a massive block clad in stone and travertine interrupted by windows lined the basement and the first floor separated by pillars covered with stone. A double band in travertine separates the base from the block to C, characterized by the scanning line of windows interspersed with dividing walls that incorporate pilasters that create a dynamic rhythm in the facade. The top floor is completely covered in travertine and is concluded by a robust cornice. The interior is characterized by a large first floor hall, which contains the 1956 works completed by Francesco Russo based on the ideas of the painter Giovanni Brancaccio. In other areas there are also mosaics depicting rural scenes and seascapes. References * NapoliGuida-14 itinerari di Architettura moderna, Clean, Edited by Sergio Stenti with Vito Cappiello, 1998.

She was the first female full professor of Chemistry at Harvard, attaining the position in 1989. Today she is the Theodore William Richards Professor of Chemistry and Professor of Materials Science, as well as a member of the editorial board of ACS Catalysis, Chemical Science, and the Journal of the American Chemical Society. She served as co-Editor-in-Chief of the Catalysis Science & Technology journal from 2010 until 2013. Her research focuses on controlling the chemical and physical properties of interfaces, by investigating important catalytic reactions and by making new materials with key chemical functionality. Her lab aims to develop solutions to important problems in energy usage and environmental chemistry. Friend joined the Chemistry department of Harvard University in 1982 after doing her postdoctoral research at Stanford University and earning her Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley. Her previous leadership positions at Harvard include Associate Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (2002‚Äì05), Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology (2004‚Äì07), and Associate Director of the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (2002-2011), and Radcliffe Trustee (1990‚Äì93). Dr. Friend also served as Associate Director of the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, at Stanford University (2011-2012) while on a leave from Harvard.  Early years  Cynthia Friend was born in the village of Lawrence, Nebraska, where her father was also born. Lawrence was a predominantly German- Catholic village where her grandfather settled as a young adult. Friend has one brother, Randolph. Her parents were both veterans of WWII. Elise was a staff sergeant in the US Marine Corps and Matt, her father, was a bomber pilot in the Army Air Corps. Matt and his brother ran a plumbing and heating company that serviced the community in vicinity of Lawrence. In 1960, her family moved to nearby Hastings Nebraska because the business could not support two families. Her mother worked as a bookkeeper in Hastings and her father worked for a plumbing and heating supply company. Friend attended Catholic school in Hastings through the sixth grade and thereafter transferred to the public school system. In high school, she benefited from a flexible educational schedule that allowed her to take independent study courses under the supervision of several dedicated teachers. She was also a lab assistant for the chemistry and biology teachers, which helped her build on her interest in science. Cynthia learned to play golf early on from her father and played competitively, mainly at the local and state levels. Friend gave up golf after high school in order to attend college. At that time, there were no athletic opportunities for women. She renewed her interest in golf as an adult and competed at local, state, and national levels. Education Friend enrolled at University of California, Davis, after having graduated from Hastings High School in 1973. She earned her B.S. degree in Chemistry in 1977. At the University of California, Berkeley, Friend studied Physical Chemistry under the direction of Prof. Earl Muetterties. She completed her Ph.D. in 1981 and subsequently was a postdoctoral researcher for one year at Stanford University in the Department of Chemical Engineering in the Madix Group.  Harvard  Cynthia Friend began her independent research career as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Harvard University in 1982. She moved through the ranks to become the first female Full Professor of Chemistry in 1989. Friend was appointed as the Theodore William Richards Professor of Chemistry in 1998 and as Professor of Materials Science in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard in 2002. Prof. Friend has served in many leadership roles at Harvard, including as the first and only Department Chair in Chemistry (2004‚Äì07), as Associate Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (2002‚Äì05), and as Director of the Rowland Institute (2013‚Äì19).

The flex layout allows responsive elements within a container to be automatically arranged depending upon screen size (or device). Concepts Most web pages are written in a combination of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). In short, HTML specifies the content and logical structure of the page, while the CSS specifies how it looks: its colors, fonts, formatting, layout, and styling. CSS flex-box layout is a particular way to specify the layout of HTML pages. One of the most defining features of the flex layout is its ability to form- fit, based on its viewing environment. Flex boxes can adjust in size‚Äîeither decreasing, to avoid unnecessarily monopolizing space, or increasing to make room for contents to be constrained within its boundaries. Moreover, the flex layout is less restrictive in terms of content flow than those, for example, of the block and inline display types, which are generally uni-directional. Indeed, not only can flex directional flow be specified, at the style level, as rightwards, leftwards, upwards, or downwards; individual items within a flex container may also be automatically reordered and rearranged to suit the available layout space.  History  In the 2000s the intensive use of the Web by mobile agents motivated \\"liquid layouts\\" and responsive elements for the growing variety of screen sizes.https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-cssqueries/index.html In the 2010s, the intensive use of popular JavaScript layout frameworks, such as Bootstrap, inspired CSS flex-box and grid layout specifications.https://github.com/kvdmolen/grid-flexbox-sass https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/css3-flexible-box-layout-explained/ CSS 3 modules included solutions akin to this, like flexbox https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css3_flexbox.asp and grid.https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp , 98.69% of installed browsers (99.29% of desktop browsers and 100% of mobile browsers) support CSS Flexible Box Layout. Terminology Following are a few terms associated with the flex layout model =Flex container= :Parent element that holds all flex items. Using the CSS display property, the container can be defined as either flex or inline-flex. =Flex item= :Any direct child element held within the flex container is considered a flex item. Any text within the container element is wrapped in an unknown flex item. =Axes= :Each flex box contains two axes: the main and cross axes. The main axis is the axis on which the items align with each other. The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis. Flex- direction :Establishes main axis. Possible arguments: row (default), row- reverse, column, column-reverse. Justify-content :Determines how content gets placed on the main axis on the current line. Optional arguments: left, right, center, space-between, space-around. Align-items :Determines the default for how flex items get placed on the cross axis on each line. Align-content :Determines the default for how cross axis lines are aligned. Align-self :Determines how a single item is placed along the cross axis. This overrides any defaults set by align-items. =Directions= :The main-start/main-end sides determine where to start placing flex items within the flex container, starting from the main-start end and going to the main-end end. The cross- start/cross-end sides determine where flex lines get filled with flex items from cross-start to cross-end. Order :Places elements in groups and determines which order they are to be placed in within the container. Flex-flow :Shorthands flex-direction and flex-wrap to place the flex content. =Lines= :Flex items can either be placed on a singular line or on multiple lines as defined by the flex-wrap property, which controls both the direction of the cross axis and how lines stack within the container. =Dimensions= :Main size and cross size are essentially the height and width of the flex container, each dealing with the main and cross axes respectively. Designate a flex box Designating an element as a flex element is relatively easy. All that is necessary is to set the display property to either flex or inline-flex as follows: display: flex; Or: display: inline-flex; By setting the display to one of the two values above, an element becomes a flex container and its children flex items. Setting the display to flex makes the container a block- level element, while setting the display to inline-flex makes the container an inline-level element.Using CSS flexible boxes ‚Äì Web developer guide  MDN  Align to center  One of flexbox's advantages is the ability to easily align items within the container to the center of a page, both vertically and horizontally. display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; References Category:Web design Category:World Wide Web Consortium standards ","title":"CSS Flexible Box Layout"},{"id":"42125233","text":"Andrea A.

Lunsford has served as Chair of the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC), as Chair of the Modern Language Association (MLA) Division on Writing, and as a member of the MLA Executive Council. Contributions Lunsford, along with Lisa Ede, argues for collaborative writing and the ability for writers to work together and be rewarded for their work on the same level as singular writers. Lunsford has collaborated on researching the role of audience in composition theory and pedagogy. Lunsford, again with Ede, researched creating a common ground between addressed and invoked audiences and the idea that an elaborated view of audience must balance the creativity of the writer and the creativity of the reader. An important claim Lunsford has made in cognitivism is that cognitive mental faculties involved during composition are important. She states that the best way to encourage the writing process is through the use of workshops and discussions rather than traditional lecture styles.

The report was issued by a three-person board, invoked by Chief of the General Staff Guy Simonds, and chaired by Major General Howard K. Kennedy. The report recommended that the Reserve Army be renamed the Militia, that the command structure be reorganized (divisions and brigades replaced with 26 militia groups), and changes in unit types and armaments (less infantry and artillery, more armour; coastal and air defence units eliminated) be implemented. This was to better provide a partly- trained, partly-equipped force to act as a cadre in the event of a requirement for full-scale mobilization. The recommendations were generally accepted; the six divisions of the Canadian Army Reserve Force being disbanded and replaced with a larger number of militia groups. The Canadian Army Reserve Force became the Canadian Army (Militia), while the Canadian Army Active Force became the Canadian Army (Regular). Various regiments, such as the North Nova Scotia Highlanders, the Essex Scottish Regiment, and the Perth Regiment were dissolved by amalgamation. The implementation of the report's recommendations significantly reduced the role of the reserve army, thoroughly subordinating it to the regular army. The recommended training requirements were never properly implemented, making it practically impossible for the reserve forces to meet regular-force standards, and there were also challenges with equipment and morale. All this took place in an environment where powerful voices, such as that of Field Marshal Montgomery, were deprecating the importance of augmenting mobilization ability (as opposed to maintaining stronger front-line forces).

To advance his plan, Woodard traveled to the erstwhile vegetarian/feminist utopia and met with its municipal leadership. Following an initial visit, having encountered a population in \\"moral and intellectual decline\\",Tenaglia, F., Momus‚ÄîA Walking Interview (Turin/Milan: Noch Publishing, 2015), p. 39. he chose not to pursue the relationship but had found in the community an object of study for later writings. What particularly interests him are the proto-transhumanist ideas of speculative planner Richard Wagner and Elisabeth F√∂rster-Nietzsche, who along with her husband Bernhard F√∂rster founded and lived in the colony between 1886 and 1889.Kober, H., \\"In, um und um Germanistan herum\\", Die Tageszeitung, May 18, 2006.Lichtmesz, M., \\"Nietzsche und Wagner im Dschungel: David Woodard & Christian Kracht in Nueva Germania\\", Zwielicht 2, 2007, pp. 28‚Äì31. In 2004, acknowledging sustainable aspects of Nueva Germania's founding ideals, Woodard composed the choral anthem \\"Our Jungle Holy Land\\".Scheidemandel, N., \\"Der Traum in der Maschine\\", Der Freund, Nr. 1, September 2004, pp. 41‚Äì50.Horzon, R., Das weisse Buch (Berlin: Suhrkamp, 2011), pp. 240‚Äì256. From 2004 to 2006 Woodard led numerous expeditions to Nueva Germania, winning support from then U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney.Epstein, J., \\"Rebuilding a Home in the Jungle\\", San Francisco Chronicle, March 13, 2005. In 2011 Woodard granted Swiss writer Christian Kracht permission to publish their sizable personal correspondence, largely concerning Nueva Germania,Schr√∂ter, J., \\"Interpretive Problems with Author, Self-Fashioning and Narrator\\", in Birke, K√∂ppe, eds., Author and Narrator (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2015), pp. 113‚Äì138. under Leibniz University Hannover imprint Wehrhahn Verlag.Woodard, \\"In Media Res\\", 032c, Summer 2011, pp. 180‚Äì189.

According to Andrew McCann, Woodard embarked on \\"a trip to what is left of the place, where descendants of original settlers live under drastically reduced circumstances\\" and was moved to \\"advance the cultural profile of the community, and to build a miniature Bayreuth opera house on the site of what was once Elisabeth F√∂rster-Nietzsche's family residence.\\"McCann, A. L., \\"Allegory and the German (Half) Century\\", Sydney Review of Books, August 28, 2015. In recent years Nueva Germania has tempered into a more genial destination, with bed and breakfasts and a makeshift historical museum. Dreamachine From 1989 to 2007 Woodard built replicas of the Dreamachine , a stroboscopic device created by Brion Gysin and Ian Sommerville which involves a slotted cylinder, made of copper or paper, rotating around an electrical lamp.Allen, M., \\"D√©cor by Timothy Leary\\", The New York Times, January 20, 2005. Woodard claimed that when observed with closed eyes, the machine could trigger mental states that are comparable to substance intoxication or dreaming.Woodard, Program note, Program, Berlin, November 2006.

He served in the Nevada State Senate. Faiss was born at Centralia, Illinois in 1911, the son of John and Belle Faiss. He married Theresa E. Watts, whom he had first met at St. Louis, Missouri, on April 14, 1933. They had three sons, Robert, Donald and Ronald. The family relocated to North Las Vegas, Nevada in 1944, and upon their arrival, Wilbur operated a small business (Truck Haven and later Truck Harbor) and served as a volunteer firefighter. He also a worked on Nevada Test Site in the 1950s, and was a part of a teamsters' union. Retiring from business in 1976, Faiss, then aged 65 ran for election as a Democratic candidate for the Nevada State Senate, winning election to represent North Las Vegas. He served two terms, until 1984. During his time in office advocated for the working class, seniors issues, education, and civil rights.http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/77th2013/Bills/SR/SR8.pdf He voted in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment in 1977, and wrote laws including one permitting pharmacists to replace lower-cost generic drugs with brand name drugs, and one to grant free admission for senior citizens to state parks. He was honored with a resolution in the Nevada Senate in 1983 on the occasion of his 50th wedding anniversary. In January 2012, he and his wife were recognized as one of the longest married couples in the United States by President Barack Obama. He later stated that the key to a long marriage was to compromise; his wife was a Republican while he was a Democrat. His wife, Theresa died on October 28, 2012 at the age of 97, after 79 years of marriage. He later moved to Carson City, Nevada to be closer to his family. The Wilbur and Theresa Faiss Middle School was named in honor of him and his wife. He delivered an address to the students there on the eve of his 100th birthday in 2011.

April 25, 2013 was also proclaimed Senate Wilbur Faiss Day by Governor of Nevada Brian Sandoval. Faiss died aged 102 after weeks of hospitalization at Carson City, Nevada in 2013. He was assumed to be the oldest living former state legislator in the United States at the time of his death. Upon his death, governor Brian Sandoval stated: \\"I was deeply saddened today to learn of the passing of Wilbur Faiss. Mr. Faiss had a tireless commitment to the state and its people, but most importantly, he devoted his life to his wife and children\\".

Smyth kept a diary and documented the natural history he encountered in Australia. Early life and medical career Arthur Bowes Smyth was born on 23 August 1750 at Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Essex, England, and was buried there shortly after his return to England on 31 March 1790. Son of Surgeon Thomas Smyth and the seventh of ten children, Arthur Bowes Smyth followed in his father's footsteps practising medicine in his place of birth until appointed \\"Surgeon to the Ship's Company\\" aboard the Lady Penrhyn in 1787. Whilst Bowes Smyth practiced as a surgeon for a number of years before his appointment to the First Fleet, no evidence can be found of his medical qualifications. It has been surmised that \\"Surgeon\\" was an honorary title. He is known to have practiced midwifery in his local parish of Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Essex, an experience that served him well in his supervision of the women convicts on the Lady Penrhyn. First Fleet Journal as Surgeon on the Lady Penrhyn Bowes Smyth boarded Lady Penrhyn on 22 March 1787 before the ship departed Portsmouth for New South Wales. Bowes Smyth took charge of the female prisoners on the Lady Penrhyn when the convicts' surgeon, John Turnpenny Altree, fell ill at Tenerife and, in Governor Arthur Phillip's opinion, had proved unequal to the task. Bowes, as he was known in the colony, kept a journal from 22 March 1787 to 12 August 1789. The journal is a detailed account of the voyage, recording weather observations, events on board, treatment of the sick and descriptions of ports of call en route‚Äîin particular, Rio de Janeiro and Cape Town. His journal is notable for its interest in natural history including descriptions of bird life at Port Jackson and Lord Howe Island on the Lady Penrhyn's return voyage. The journal contains 25 drawings in watercolour and ink, including the earliest known surviving illustration of the emu by a European. These elements provide a unique account different from the other First Fleet Journals. Bowes Smyth's journal is one of the most detailed eyewitness accounts of the first weeks of European settlement of Australia. The journal entries for 18‚Äì26 January record first impressions on arrival including interactions with Aboriginal communities and descriptions of the vegetation, intense heat, and native wildlife. The convicts and their children who disembarked the Lady Penrhyn at Port Jackson are listed. Bowes Smyth's first journal entry, dated 22 March 1787, records the full crew list and the women convicts, their name, age, trade, crime, and term of transportation. The list of children born on the voyage contains inaccuracies regarding the sex of the child and dates of birth and death. The Lady Penrhyn, under charter to the British East India Company to continue her voyage to China for a cargo of tea, departed Port Jackson in early May. The journal continues, recording the return voyage via Lord Howe Island, Tahiti, China, St Helena, and finally England. The original journal is now in the collection of the National Library of Australia and has been digitised for online viewing. Manuscript 'fair copies' are held in the British Library and State Library of New South Wales. The 24 illustrations in the copy held by the State Library of New South Wales have been separated from the original journal and digitised for online viewing.

Ek Chuaj is part of a pantheon of Maya deities that have been depicted in hieroglyphs and artwork of various Maya sites and has been interpreted as a significant part of Maya religion. Description Ek Chuaj can either be depicted as black-and-white striped, as he is in the Dresden Codex, or entirely black, as he is in the Madrid Codex. Other distinguishing characteristics of Ek Chuaj are his mouth, which is encircled by a red-brown border, his large lower lip, and the presence of two curved lines to the right of his eye. Other depictions of Ek Chuaj show him as an old man with only a single tooth. This is the appearance he most regularly takes in the Madrid Codex. He has been depicted with a pack of goods commonly carried by merchants, and his carrying of a burden is also indicated by the rope or tumpline tied around his head. He may also carry a spear and, in some instances, a scorpion's tail. Significance = Mentioned in: The history of Chocolate = Ek Chuaj holds various meanings depending upon the contexts in which he is depicted. His principal associations are with trade and cacao use. =As a Merchant Deity= Ek Chuaj is often depicted carrying a pack and a spear, indicating transportation of goods as well as the dangerous life of a merchant. In this context, Ek Chuaj is a patron deity of travelers and journeys. During journeys, travelers would stack three stones on top of each other and offer incense to Ek Chuaj at night to ensure a safe journey home.Hagar, 1900, 100-101 It is possible that Ek Chuaj and the \\"Guide of the Merchant,\\" otherwise known as Polaris or the North Star, are related both symbolically and linguistically. \\"Ek\\" can be translated as either \\"black\\" or \\"star\\".Hagar, 1900, 100-101 =As a Patron of Cacao= Cacao was one of the most important products traded by Maya merchants and it was often treated as currency. Because Ek Chuaj is a patron of cacao, owners of cacao groves would hold ceremonies or special festivals in his honor. One of these was held during Muwan, a \\"month\\" in the Maya solar calendar or haab'. The presence of this ceremony suggests that Ek Chuaj was an agriculturally symbolic deity within Maya society. Interactions with Other Deities Ek Chuaj is sometimes depicted in combat, most often with Buluk Chabtan (God F) the god of war, violence, and sacrifice. This interaction has been interpreted as representing the need for traveling merchants to have the ability to ward off hostile attacks. In the Madrid Codex, Ek Chuaj and God L are closely related and sometimes nearly indistinguishable from one another. It appears that God L was a Classic Maya counterpart of Ek Chuaj.

She was the daughter to the owner of a small mechanical workshop. Biography Baldo-Ceolin graduated from the University of Padua in 1952 and six years later (1958) became a Professor in Physics in the same University. In 1963, she was the first female to have a professorship (Chair of Physics Department) in the University. The discovery of the proton and neutron antiparticles led Baldo-Ceolin to co-discover antilambda, the first antihyperon, with Derek Prowse after a 1957 conference. In the 1970s she was attracted by neutrino physics. She entered the NUE experiment at CERN, where she worked within Helmut Fraisser's team to determine a value for the Weinberg angle. Baldo-Ceolin was also part of the Italian-French-Dutch-Norwegian collaboration regarding the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN. This collaboration used a liquid deuterium bubble chamber to explore neutrino interactions with protons and neutrons. In 1976 she started an experiment for the observation of electron-muon-neutrino oscillations, which later continued running with NOMAD's collaboration contribution (Neutrino Oscillation MAgnetic Detector). Baldo-Ceolin was given the opportunity to unfold her leading abilities during that collaborative project. She also supported the development of the ICARUS experiment and its installation in the Gran Sasso laboratory. In Padua, from 1965-1968 she was Head of the local section of the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) and 1973-1978 Head of the Physics Department. In 1998, she initiated the series of international workshops on neutrino telescopes at the Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti. Amongst others, she had been coordinator of the European Networks of neutrino oscillators. When Baldo-Ceolin died she was still a Professor Emeritus in the University of Padua, a role attributed to her in 1998. Awards Throughout her career Baldo-Ceolin received the following awards: *1976: Awarded the Feltrinelli Prize by the Accademia dei Lincei *1978: Gold Medal for Education and Arts (Benemeriti della Scuola, della Cultura e dell'Arte) *1995: Gold Medal for Science (Benemeriti della Scienza e della Cultura) *2007: Enrico Fermi Prize of the Italian Physical Society References External links *Scientific publications of Milla Baldo-Ceolin on INSPIRE-HEP Category:1924 births Category:2011 deaths Category:People from Legnago Category:Italian physicists Category:Particle physicists Category:Italian women physicists Category:Italian women scientists Category:People associated with CERN Category:20th-century physicists Category:20th-century women scientists Category:University of Padua faculty ","title":"Milla Baldo-Ceolin"},{"id":"42125463","text":"MV Treasure may refer to: * (1983‚Äì2000; ) ‚Äì cargo ship that sank off the coast of South Africa in 2000 ‚Äì see MV Treasure oil spill * (1990‚Äì; ) ‚Äì heavy load carrier * (1942‚Äì1969) ‚Äì the Empire ship Treasure ‚Äì see List of Empire ships (Th‚ÄìTy) Category:Ship names ","title":"MV Treasure"},{"id":"42125470","text":"Jacob Moli (born 11 May 1967) is a Solomon Islands former footballer and the current manager of the Solomon Islands national under-17 football team.

(Willdan) is an American publicly traded company selling professional technical and consulting services to public and private utilities, public agencies at all levels of government, and commercial and industrial firms. The company operates offices in more than a dozen states, with its key operations in California and New York. Operations The primary markets Willdan serves are: energy engineering; infrastructure and transportation; municipal engineering, planning, and staff augmentation; economic and financial analysis. History In 1964, the company was built by William Stookey and Dan Heil in southern California on a then-unique model of providing outsourced engineering services exclusively to municipalities, especially newly urbanizing cities.Lavery, Kevin (1999). Smart Contracting for Local Government Services: Processes and Experience, p. 103, Praeger Publishers, London.. Over the next 50 years, the company's expansion has reflected the increasingly complex challenges facing communities, with a forward-looking focus on energy efficiency, energy engineering, cogeneration, Energy Savings Performance Contract, Community Choice Aggregation, smart city, microgrid consulting, and Transactive energy software. In 2006, Willdan Group, Inc. completed its initial public offerings in NASDAQ, becoming a publicly traded company under the symbol WLDN. In 2008, Willdan acquired Intergy Corporation, then renamed Willdan Energy Solutions, offering energy efficiency utility program management. In 2015, Willdan acquired 360 Energy Engineers and Abacus Resource Management, expanding its capabilities into Energy Service Company and Energy Savings Performance Contract services. Willdan acquired NYC-based Genesys Engineering, P.C., in 2016, bringing Power Engineering services into its portfolio, with an eye to evolution of U.S. power systems toward Distributed generation and microgrids. The big data analytics firm Integral Analytics, Inc. (IA) was acquired by Willdan in July 2017. IA's software solutions help investor-owned utility and smart city managers solve problems arising from the transformation of an electrical grid facing growth in distributed generation sources, such as solar power and the electric vehicle, effectively harnessing the power of renewable energy and energy storage.

Description and Classification Olbitherium was originally described from lower and upper jaw fragments and several teeth found in the Wutu Formation of Shandong Province. The limited material of Olbitherium shares similarities with several ungulate groups. According to Tong et al., the upper cheek teeth show similarities to early Perissodactyls, as well as the hyracoid Seggeurius, while the lower cheek teeth more closely resemble those of phenacodontids, such as Ectocion, Phenacodus, and Copecion. Due to these conflicting similarities, Tong et al. placed Olbitherium as incertae sedis within the Phenacodonta, a grouping of Perissodactyla, \\"Condylarthra\\", and Hyracoidea in McKenna's 1975 classification, and suggested that Olbitherium represents an intermediate stage in the evolution of perissodactlys from Phenacodus-like ancestors. In 2010, a skull and post- cranial remains were described, and Olbitherium was assigned to the Perissodactyla, closely related to basal members of the extinct family Isectolophidae such as Homogalax and Cardiolophus.

History Historic clock tower at the Szombierki Power Plant Interior The power plant was completed after World War I, and started operations in 1920, providing electricity for Bytom region (then part of Germany). The structure, originally intended to be an explosives factory, covers approximately . It was originally operated by Schaffgotsch Bergwerksgesellschaft GmbH (a German company of the Schaffgotsch family). The structure was designed by German architects Georg and Emil Zillmann, known in Silesia as architects of the Nikiszowiec and Giszowiec districts in nearby Katowice. Notable features of the design included a large hall (), three chimneys, and a clock tower with a clock, one of the largest turret clocks in Poland. By World War II the plant had a capacity of 100 MW. Quickly rebuilt after the war, and operating at a similar capacity in the 1950s, the Szombierki Power Plant was one of the largest in the People's Republic of Poland and Europe. In the 1970s, the power plant was converted from a thermal power station to a combined heat and power plant. It was modernised up until the mid 1990s, and from 1993 it was owned by Zesp√≥≈Ç Elektrociep≈Çowni Bytom S.A. Since the late 1990s, the power plant has been operating at a significantly reduced capacity, used primarily as a reserve power plant. It is considered an industrial monument (a part of the Trail of Monuments of Engineering in the Silesian Voivodeship, Szlak Zabytk√≥w Techniki Wojew√≥dztwa ≈ölƒÖskiego). During a 2009 vote organized by mmsilesia.pl, TVS and supported by the officials of the Silesian Voivodeship, it was voted as one of the \\"Seven Architectural Wonders of the Silesian Voivodeship\\". As of 2013 the structure has been officially classified as a monument by the government of Poland. Since the mid-1990s, it has been a host site to a number of cultural events (such as concerts or exhibitions) until 2011, when it was acquired by Finnish company Fortum and closed due to concerns over structure stability. Parts of the structure are still open for small guided tours. There are plans to convert it into a museum or a similar type of a cultural institution.

Biography Born in Roswell, New Mexico, Antram became a Franciscan in 1945, studied at Duns Scotus College in Southfield, Michigan from 1946 to 1950, and was ordained a priest in 1954. He was assigned to St. Michael's Mission in St. Michaels, Arizona and spent his career at institutions around the Navajo Nation, including in Chinle, Houck, and Kayenta, Arizona, and in Gallup and Tohatchi, New Mexico.\\"Obituary for Fr. Cormac Antram, OFM\\" , Voice of the Southwest (Roman Catholic Diocese of Gallup), October 2, 2013. Antram learned to speak Navajo fluently, and in 1958 began a bilingual radio program, known as \\"The Padre's Hour\\" (although the programs were actually only a half-hour in length) that became widely popular among the Navajo. He continued to host the show for more than 45 years (except for an 18-month stint by another priest in the 1960s), making it one of the longest-running programs in American radio history. He also supervised a 20-year effort to produce an authorized translation of the Catholic Mass into Navajo,Christopher Vecsey, On the Padres' Trail (University of Notre Dame Press, 1996), , p. 212. and became known as an expert on the language, sometimes consulted by native speakers with questions about the language.Bill Donovan, \\"More than 300 attend Navajo-speaking priest's funeral\\", Navajo Times, October 10, 2013. He adapted other Catholic prayers into Navajo, including a version of the Gloria Patri (\\"Glory be to the Father\\") prayer, sung to a melody associated with the traditional Navajo Blessing Way chant. He died in 2013 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, aged 87. He was reported to be the last Franciscan priest who could speak the Navajo Language fluently. In 2011, his celebration of the Navajo Mass was recorded on video to preserve it for future use. He also authored two books collecting columns and stories from his column in the diocese newspaper.

The aim of the ENDIA Study is to identify environmental factors and gene-environment interactions that contribute to and protect against the development of islet autoimmunity and progression to type 1 diabetes in children genetically at-risk. The study will follow 1,400 infants with a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes prospectively from early pregnancy into childhood to investigate relationships between prenatal and postnatal environmental factors, and the development of islet autoimmunity and subsequent type 1 diabetes. ENDIA will evaluate the microbiome, nutrition, bodyweight/composition, metabolome-lipidome, insulin resistance, innate and adaptive immune function and viral infections. A systems biology approach will integrate multi-omics analyses to explore hypotheses and mechanisms underlying the development of islet autoimmunity.

Blending elements of genre fiction and literary fiction, the novel takes place in a post- apocalyptic United States ravaged by zombies. Whitehead has stated that the novel was partly an attempt to return to his adolescent fascination with horror writer Stephen King and science fiction icon Isaac Asimov. Plot summary A virus has laid waste to civilization, turning the infected into flesh-eating and mortally contagious zombies. But events have stabilized, and the rebuilding process has begun. Over a three-day span, ‚ÄúMark Spitz‚Äù and his fellow ‚Äúsweepers‚Äù‚Äîother survivors of the apocalypse‚Äîpatrol portions of New York City, eliminating zombies as part of a mission to make the city habitable once again. Flashbacks pepper the narrative, explaining how ‚ÄúMark Spitz‚Äù survived the apocalypse to date and got his nickname along the way. Critical reception Reviewing Zone One for Esquire, Tom Chiarella wrote that \\"Whitehead brilliantly reformulates an old-hat genre to ask the epidemic question of a teetering history‚Äîthe question about the possibility of survival\\" and called the book \\"one of the best books of the year.\\" While Chiarella's review establishes the high-water mark of praise heaped on the book, most critics were similarly impressed. Glen Duncan, who likened the pairing of genre and literary fiction to \\"an intellectual dating a porn star,\\" concluded that Zone One \\"is a cool, thoughtful and, for all its ludic violence, strangely tender novel, a celebration of modernity and a pre-emptive wake for its demise.\\" Charlie Jane Anders observed ‚Äúthis is one zombie story that nobody's ever told before‚Äù and opined ‚Äúthe book pays off marvelously.‚Äù Duncan and Anders both had criticisms of the novel, however. Duncan, took issue with the prose, writing, \\"[s]tylistically the novel takes a while to settle,\\" but that when it does, \\"Whitehead writes with economy, texture and punch.\\" Anders, meanwhile, wondered if the heavy, unpredictable, and sometimes indiscernible use of flashbacks represented a deliberate attempt \\"to deny the reader any feeling of narrative satisfaction, through denseness and obfuscation.\\" The novel was a New York Times bestseller.

It is one of the five Bindu Upanishads, all attached to the Atharvaveda, and one of twenty Yoga Upanishads in the four Vedas.GM Patil (1978), Ishvara in Yoga philosophy, The Brahmavadin, Volume 13, Vivekananda Prakashan Kendra, pages 209‚Äì210 The text is notable for its focus on meditation, calling dedication to bookish learning as rubbish, emphasizing practice instead, and presenting the Vedanta doctrine from Yoga perspective. The Tejobindu is listed at number 37 in the serial order of the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads. Nomenclature Tejobindu, states Paul Deussen, means \\"the point representing the power of Brahman\\", wherein the point is the Anusvara in Om. The Tejobindu Upanishad is sometimes spelled as Tejabindu Upanishad (Sanskrit: ‡§§‡•á‡§ú‡§¨‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Å), such as in the Poona manuscript versions. Chronology and anthology Mircea Eliade suggests that Tejobindu Upanishad was possibly composed in the same period as the didactic parts of the Mahabharata, the chief Sannyasa Upanishads and along with other early Yoga Upanishads: Brahmabindu (probably composed about the same time as Maitri Upanishad), Ksurika, Amritabindu, Brahmavidya, Nadabindu, Yogashikha, Dhyanabindu and Yogatattva. Eliade's suggestion places these in the final centuries of BCE or early centuries of the CE. All these, adds Eliade, were likely composed earlier than the ten or eleven later Yoga Upanishads such as the Yoga- kundalini, Varaha and Pashupatabrahma Upanishads.Mircea Eliade (1970), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, , pages 128‚Äì129 Gavin Flood dates the Tejobindu text, along with other Yoga Upanishads, to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period. This Upanishad is among those which have been differently attached to two Vedas, depending on the region where the manuscript was found. Deussen states, it and all Bindu Upanishads are attached to the Atharvaveda, while Ayyangar states it is attached to the Krishna Yajurveda.Alain Danielou (1991), Yoga: Mastering the Secrets of Matter and the Universe, Inner Traditions, , page 168 Colebrooke's version of 52 Upanishads, popular in north India, lists this Upanishad's text at number 21 along with the other four Bindu Upanishads with similar theme. The Narayana anthology also includes this Upanishad at number 21 in Bibliothica Indica. In the collection of Upanishads under the title \\"Oupanekhat\\", put together by Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh in 1656, consisting of a Persian translation of 50 Upanishads and who prefaced it as the best book on religion, the Tejobindu is listed at number 27 and is named Tidj bandeh. Structure This text is part of the five Bindu Upanishads collection, the longest among the five, the other four being the Nadabindu Upanishad, the Brahmabindu Upanishad, the Amritabindu Upanishad and the Dhyanabindu Upanishad, all forming part of the Atharvaveda. All five of Bindu Upanishads emphasize the practice of Yoga and Dhyana (meditation) with Om, to apprehend Atman (soul, self). Like almost all other Yoga Upanishads, the text is composed in poetic verse form. The text exists in multiple versions. The manuscript translated by Deussen is short. It has fourteen verses, describing how difficult meditation is in its first two verses, the requirements for a successful meditative practice in next two, the need for the universal constant Brahman as the radiant focal point of meditation and the nature of Brahman in verses 5 to 11, then closes the text by describing the Yogi who has achieved the state of \\"liberation, freedom\\" (moksha) while being alive. The manuscript translated by TRS Ayyangar of Adyar Library is long, and has six chapters with a cumulative total of 465 verses. The first chapter contains 51 verses, the second has 43 verses, the third with 74 verses, the fourth contains 81 verses, fifth has 105, and the last sixth chapter has 111 verses. Two chapters, in the longer version, are structured as a discourse, with chapters 2 to 4 between Kumara and his father Shiva, and the last two chapters between Nidagha and Ribhu. Deussen states that the shorter form may be a trimmed, \\"enormously corrupt text transmission\\". Contents The text does not esteem scriptural studies, and encourages the practice of meditation instead. =Meditation is difficult= The text opens by asserting that Dhyana (meditation) is difficult, and increasingly so as one proceeds from gross, then fine, then superfine states. Even the wise and those who are alone, states the text, find meditation difficult to establish, implement and accomplish. =How to meditate successfully?= For success in Dhyana, asserts the text, one must first conquer anger, greed, lust, attachments, expectations, worries about wife and children. Give up sloth and lead a virtuous life. Be temperate in the food you eat, states Tejobindu, abandon your delusions, and crave not. Find a Guru, respect him and strive to learn from him, states the text. =The fifteen limb yoga= The Tejobindu Upanishad begins its discussion of Yoga, with a list of fifteen Angas (limbs), as follows: Yamas (self control), Niyama (right observances), Tyaga (renunciation), Mauna (silence, inner quietness), Desa (right place, seclusion), Kala (right time), Asana (correct posture), Mula-bandha (yogic root-lock technique), Dehasamyama (body equilibrium, no quivering), Drksthiti (mind equilibrium, stable introspection), Pranasamyama (breath equilibrium), Pratyahara (withdrawal of senses), Dharana (concentration), Atma-dhyana (meditation on Universal Self), Samadhi (identification with individual self is dropped). The Tejobindu briefly defines these fifteen limbs in verses 1.17 to 1.37, without details. The verses 1.38 to 1.51 describe the difficulty in achieving meditation and Samadhi, and ways to overcome these difficulties. One must function in the world and be good at what one does, improve upon it, yet avoid longing, state verses 1.44‚Äì1.45. Physical yoga alone does not provide the full results, unless introspection and right knowledge purifies the mind, state verses 1.48‚Äì1.49 of the longer manuscript. One must abandon anger, selfish bonds to things and people, likes and dislikes to achieve Samadhi, states verse 3 of the shorter version of the manuscript. =The indivisible oneness in the essence of all= Chapter 2 is a discourse from Shiva to his son Kumara on \\"Individual One Essence\\". This is Atman (soul, self), states Shiva, it is all existence, the entire world, all knowledge, all space, all time, all Vedas, all introspection, all preceptors, all bodies, all minds, all learning, all that is little, all that is big, and it is Brahman. \\"Individual One Essence\\" is identical to but called by many names such as Hari and Rudra, and it is without origin, it is gross, subtle and vast in form. \\"Individual One Essence\\" is thou, a mystery, that which is permanent, and that which is the knower. It is the father, it is the mother, it is the sutra, it is the Vira, what is within, what is without, the nectar, the home, the sun, the crop field, the tranquility, the patience, the good quality, the Om, the radiance, the true wealth, the Atman. Shiva describes the nature of consciousness in verses 2.24‚Äì2.41, and asserts the Vedanta doctrine, \\"Atman is identical with Brahman\\" in the final verses of chapter 2. =Atman and Brahman= The Tejabindu Upanishad, states Madhavananda, conceives the Supreme Atman as dwelling in the heart of man, as the most subtle centre of effulgence, revealed to yogis by super-sensuous meditation. This Atman and its identity with Brahman, that where the saying Tat Tvam Asi refers to, is the subject of chapter 3. It is that which is to be meditated upon, and realised in essence, for the absolute freedom of the soul, and for the realization of the True Self. The text mentions Shiva explaining the non-dual (Advaita) nature of Atman and Brahman. The verses describe the Atman to be bliss, peace, contentment, consciousness, delight, satisfaction, absolute, imperishable, radiant, Nirguna (without attributes or qualities), without beginning, without end, and repeatedly states \\"I am Atman\\", \\"I am Brahman\\" and \\"I am the Indivisible One Essence\\". The Upanishad also states that the ultimate reality (Brahman) is also called Vishnu, it is consciousness as such. This discussion in Tejobindu Upanishad, a Yoga Upanishad, is entirely compatible with the discussions in the major Vedanta Upanishads. In the shorter manuscript version, translates Eknath Easwaran, \\"the Brahman gives himself through his infinite grace to ones who abandon the viewpoint of duality\\". =Jivanmukti and Videhamukti= The text describes Jivanmukta as a person who has realized his Self, that he is pure Hamsa (migrating swan). The chapter 4 of the Upanishad, in a discourse from Shiva to his son Kumara, describes Jivanmukta as follows (abridged): The text asserts that a Jivanmukta has Self-knowledge, knows that his Self (Atman) is pure as a Hamsa (Swan), he is firmly planted in himself, in the kingdom of his soul, peaceful, comfortable, kind, happy, living by his own accord. He is \\"the Lord of his own Self\\", state verses 4.31‚Äì4.32 of the text. The Tejobindu Upanishad, in verses 4.33‚Äì4.79 describes Videhamukta, and the difference between Videha mukti and Jivanmukti. A Videhamukta, states the text, is one who is beyond the witnessing state of awareness. He is beyond the \\"all is Brahman\\" conviction. He sees all in his Atman, but does not have the conviction that I am Brahman. A Videhamukta accepts the other world, and has no fear of the other world. He who does not conceive of \\"Thou Art That\\", \\"this Atman is Brahman\\", yet is the Atman that never decays. He is consciousness, devoid of light and non-light, blissful. He is Videhamukta, states verses 4.68‚Äì4.79 of the text. =Atman versus Anatman= The fifth chapter of the text presents the theory of Atman and of Anatman, as a discourse between Muni Nidagha and the Vedic sage Ribhu. Atman is imperishable, states Ribhu, full of bliss, transcendental, bright, luminous, eternal, identical to Brahman and it is Brahman alone. The Buddhist concept of \\"Anatman\\" (not-self) is a false concept, asserts Ribhu, and there is no such thing as Anatman by reason that it contradicts the existence of free will. The Anatman concept that assumes absence of consciousness is flawed because if consciousness is nonexistent then nothing could be conceived, just like no destination could be reached in the absence of feet, and no work can be done in the absence of hands or no death can happen in the absence of birth, states the text in verses 5.16 to 5.21. Anatman is a false notion, asserts the text, as it implies that ethics etc. has no basis to it. The verses in chapter 5 repeat the ideas of the previous chapters. It adds in verses 5.89‚Äì5.97 that the idea, \\"I am my body\\" is false and the definition of self as body is the reason for bondage. It is a false impression created by mind: Then the text asserts again the truth that the Unchanging is the Atman. It is also stated that this chapter is probably a later addition to the original version of the Upanishad. =The nature of Satcitananda= The last chapter continues the discourse attributed to Muni Nidagha and the Vedic age Ribhu. Everything is of the nature of Sat-Chit-Ananda, existence- consciousness-bliss, asserts Ribhu. Sat-Chit-Ananda is the imperishable essence of all and everything. In a certain sense there is, translates TRS Ayyangar of Adyar Library, no such thing as \\"thou\\", nor \\"I\\" nor \\"other\\", and all is essentially the absolute Brahman. In the deepest analysis there are no scriptures, no beginning, no end, no misery, no happiness, no illusions, no such thing as arising out of gods, nor evil spirits, nor five elements, no permanence, no transience, no worship, no prayer, no oblation, no mantra, no thief, no kindness, nothing is really Real except existence-consciousness- bliss. Ultimately all is Brahman alone. Ribu asserts: Time is Brahman, Art is Brahman, happiness is Brahman, Self-luminousity is Brahman, Brahman is fascination, tranquility, virtue, auspiciousness, inauspiciousness, purity, impurity, all the world is the manifestation of the One Brahman. Brahman is the Self of all, (Atman), there is no world other than that made of Brahman. Know thyself as a form of Brahman. Reception The Tejobindu Upanishad, states Laurence Rosan, Professor and Departmental Representative in University of Chicago, is a classic in the history of absolute subjective idealism. The Neoplatonism of Proclus, though not identical, parallels the monistic idealism found in Tejobindu Upanishad. The 5th-century CE philosopher Proclus of Greece proposed organic unity of all levels of reality, the integrative immanence of One Reality, and universal love. These ideas independently appear, states Rosan, in Tejobindu Upanishad as well, in the most fully developed, longest litany of singular consciousness. While the conceptual foundations of Tejobindu are found in ancient major Upanishads such as the Chandogya (~800‚Äì600 BCE) and many minor Upanishads such as Atmabodha, Maitreyi and Subala, it is Tejobindu that dwells on the idea extensively, states Rosan, with the phrases Akhanda-eka-rasa (Undivided One Essence) and Chit-matra (Consciousness as such). The absolute idealism doctrine in Tejobindu is closely related to the Neoplatonic doctrine of Proclus. It is also said that the nondualism concept in Tejobindu is philosophic, it is metaphysics and cannot be reduced to phenomenology. The text has also been important to the historical study of Indian yoga traditions. Klaus Klostermaier, for example, states that Tejobindu Upanishad is a fairly detailed Hindu treatise on Raja Yoga.Klaus K.

Japanese people began arriving in the United States in the late 1800s and have settled in places like Hawaii, Alaska, and California. Los Angeles has become a hub for people of Japanese descent for generations in areas like Little Tokyo and Boyle Heights. As of 2017, Los Angeles has a Japanese and Japanese American population was around 110,000 people. History After the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, Japanese immigration to the United States increased drastically throughout the 1800s. From 1869-1910 Los Angeles became a prime location for Japanese immigrants to settle down. By 1910, Los Angeles had the highest percentage of Japanese and Japanese descendants in the country. Japanese immigrants took on the low-wage jobs that were once held by Chinese Immigrants and settled in cities like San Francisco. Japanese immigrants were once recruited to come to the United States to take on jobs on railroads but quickly turned to agriculture as a means of work in Southern California. In 1905, the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner published an article on the ‚Äúyellow peril‚Äù and related it to Japanese immigrants, as its original creation was against people of Chinese descent. The first group traveled from San Francisco after experiencing anti-Asian sentiment in that city.Wilkman, John and Nancy Wilkman. Los Angeles: A Pictorial Celebration. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2008. , 9781402750366. p. 148. \\"The first Japanese in Los Angeles came south from San Francisco in the 1890s to escape anti-Asian sentiment. Since that time, Japanese and Japanese Americans have played important roles in the economic and cultural life of the city.\\" The early 1900s saw an increase of racism and xenophobia in California to the point where Asian children were being segregated in public schools in San Francisco. After the 1906 earthquake in Northern California, around 2,000-3,000 Japanese immigrants moved to Los Angeles and created areas like Little Tokyo on East Alameda. As the community continued to grow, Little Tokyo extended to the First Street Corridor in Boyle Heights, in the early 1910s. Boyle Heights was Los Angeles‚Äôs largest residential communities of Japanese immigrants and Americans, apart from Little Tokyo. In the early 1910s, Boyle Heights was one of the only communities that did not have restricted housing covenants that discriminated against Japanese and other people of color. Boyle Heights was a bustling interracial community where people of different ethnic backgrounds lived amongst each other. In the 1920s and 1930s, Boyle Heights became the center of significant churches, temples, and schools for the Japanese community, ‚ÄúThese include the Tenrikyo Junior Church of America at 2727 E. 1st Street (1937‚Äê39), the Konko Church at 2924 E. 1st Street (1937‚Äê38), and the Higashi Honganji Buddhist Temple (1926‚Äê27), all designed by Yos Hirose, and the Japanese Baptist Church at 2923 E. 2nd Street (1926; extant but altered) built by the Los Angeles City Baptist Missionary Society in 1926‚Äê29‚Äù. A hospital, also designed by Hirose, opened in 1929 to serve the Japanese American community. Families of Japanese ancestry being removed from Los Angeles, California during World War II. As of December 1941 there were 37,000 ethnic Japanese people in Los Angeles County. Not long after the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which authorized military commanders to exclude \\"any or all persons\\" from certain areas in the name of national defense, the Western Defense Command began ordering Japanese Americans living on the West Coast to present themselves for \\"evacuation\\" from the newly created military zones. This included many Los Angeles families. After the war, due to lack of housing in Little Tokyo, many Japanese Americans returning from the camps moved into neighborhoods surrounding the downtown area, into apartments and boarding houses. Notably, Boyle Heights, just east of Little Tokyo, had a large Japanese American population in the 1950s (as it had before the internment) until the arrival of Mexican and Latino immigrants replaced most of them. In 1981, public hearings were held by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians at the Los Angeles State Building as part of a government investigation into the constitutionality of the World War II internment of Japanese Americans. More than 150 people participated in the Los Angeles hearings.

The interior of the Mitsuwa in Torrance As of 2014 Torrance has the second largest concentration of ethnic Japanese people of any U.S. city, after Honolulu. The city has headquarters of Japanese automakers and offices of other Japanese companies. Because of this many Japanese restaurants and other Japanese cultural offerings are in the city, and Willy Blackmore of L.A. Weekly wrote that Torrance was \\"essentially Japan's 48th prefecture\\". A Mitsuwa supermarket, Japanese schools, and Japanese banks serve the community. In the pre-World War II period the South Bay region was one of the few areas that allowed non-U.S. citizens to acquire property, so a Japanese presence came. According to John Kaji, a Torrance resident quoted in Public Radio International who was the son of Toyota's first American-based accountant, the Japanese corporate presence in Torrance, beginning with Toyota, attracted many ethnic Japanese. Toyota moved its operations to its Torrance campus in 1982 because of its proximity to the Port of Long Beach and Los Angeles International Airport, and it was followed by many other Japanese companies.Fujita, Akiko. \\"Toyota built Torrance into the second-largest home of Japanese Americans.

His function is to shake some cowbells to warn people about the arrival of the carnivals, which are celebrated annually on the last weekend of January. The Joaldunak in Ituren, on the road to Zubieta. Location Navarre The tradition of the Joaldunak takes place in some villages of Navarre, specially in the region of Malerreka. Ituren and Zubieta are located in the Pyrenees, 56.5 km due north of Pamplona, capital city of Navarre. They are situated on the flood plain of the River Ezkurra, a tributary of the River Bidasoa, in the shadow of the Mendaur mountain (1060m). The distance between the two villages is no more than 3 km. Name Although the original name is Joaldun, this character is referred to in a number of other ways: kaldurro, ttuntturro, txantxurro... However, the most used but not totally correct name is Zanpantzar. =Zanpantzar= The name Zanpantzar has become more common over the years, although nobody in Zubieta or Ituren uses this name. Zanpantzar, therefore, means: * A doll made of straw and fern, which is famous because of his trial, sentencing, and burning in the carnivals of some Basque villages. (This process is part of a cleansing ritual that burns diseases at the same time as the doll.) * The carnivals. Costume The original suit of a Zanpantzar had some characteristics in common, although nowadays each individual group has modified the costume. The features of the costume are: Hats and sprinklers of the Joaldunak. * A hat named Tunturro on the head, which is a cone (0.5 metres long) and has colourful ribbons and feathers. * A kerchief around the neck. * A shirt and short skirt made of sheep skin. * Two cowbells at the waist. * A white skirt. * A sprinkler made of horsehair in the right hand. * The footwear are the abarcas. =Variations= Although the costumes of the village are similar to each other, there are some vatiations: * The Zubieta costume does not include the fur-lined jacket as the attire of Ituren does. * The kerchief of Zubieta is a blue square and smaller than that of Ituren, which is red. Who is a Joalduna? The tradition was that the costume could only be worn by men, normally over 18 and native of the place, but a few years ago, some girls decided to dress up as Joaldun. However, the children can sometimes march following their older relative's steps. The carnivals right A Joalduna is the character who warns of the arrival of the carnivals, and is the centrepoint of the celebration. The origin of the carnivals and their objective are not known, but the tradition is thought to be bound to the (?)canching and mysticism. In fact, the Joaldunak are said to have been not only the creatures who protected the cattle, but also the ones who chased the bad spirits away, favouring the good harvests. =The parade= On Monday at noon, the Zubietars (the people of Zubieta) Joaldunak set off for Ituren (the road is only 3 km). The route follows the course of the river Ezkurra, which flows around the Mendaur mountain, geographic accidents that give the region its name: Malerreka (\\"Malda eta erreka\\", \\"Slope and river\\"). Half way along the route, they will be met by the people of the Ittundar (the people of Ituren) neighborhood of Aurtitz. After that, they will go towards Latsaga's neighborhood to join with the Joaldunak of Ituren. There will start the joint parade of approximately forty or fifty Joalduns (between eighty and a hundred bells) which, after passing through the whole of the centre of Ituren, will end up in the village square. There they will have a communal lunch to celebrate the brotherhood of the villages. On Tuesday, the following day, the Ituren Joaldunak will pay a return visit to those of Zubieta. This is the end of the carnivals. Joaldun parade Joaldunen Biltzarra Every year a celebration is held to honour all the Basque groups that have kept the tradition. This is not confined to just the Navarre villages; many Basque towns have taken up Joaldunak groups since the establishment of the \\"Joaldunen biltzarra\\". The festivities include parades, concerts, communal feasts and musical events.

Vrindavan Sweekar Sudhindra Thirtha attained Vrindavan on 17 January 2016 at Vyasa ashram, Haridwar. As per the tradition of the math, to continue the guruparampara, on 7 July 1989, Thirtha initiated a vatu into sanyasa to be the 21st, and called him Raghavendra Thirtha. Due to internal strife Raghavendra was removed from the position and all rights in the math, with effect from 19 July 2000. Later, to continue the tradition and guruparampara of the math, it was necessary to initiate a new Shishya. Sudhindra theertha swamiji therefore initiated another vatu into sanyasa and named him as Samyamindra Thirtha swamiji on 20 June 2002 as the new successor. Thus Samyamindra become main disciple (patta shishya) & successor (uttaradhikari) of the math.

He is a smart, brave person who has a penchant for adventures. Shankar appeared in Chander Pahar (franchise). Background Sankar is an ordinary young Bengali boy, from a nondescript village of Bengal. He is a 20-year-old youth, recently graduated from college and due to financial difficulties in the family, was about to take up a job in a jute mill of Shyamnagar, a prospect he absolutely loathes. In Africa Since childhood geography has been his pet subject; he has wanted to follow the footsteps of renowned explorers like Livingstone, Mungo Park, and Marco Polo, all of whom he has read about. He yearns for adventure, wild lands, forests and animals and the continent of Africa. By a stroke of luck, he secures a job as a clerk in Uganda Railway through an acquaintance already holding a post there and joyously rushes to Africa without a second thought. There, he spends a few months as a part of a company laying rail tracks but soon encounters the first of many dangers of pre-World War I Africa: man-eating lions who claim the lives of a few of his new-found friends in Africa. Later he takes up a job as station master in a desolate station amidst the Veldts. Here his presence of mind enables him to have a narrow escape from another hazard in Africa: the deadly black mamba. While at this post, Shankar one day encounters, rescues and nurses Diego Alvarez, a middle-aged Portuguese explorer and gold/diamond prospector. Alvarez's arrival becomes a turning point in Shankar's life. While recuperating, Alvarez narrated his earlier exploits in Africa with his friend Jim Carter. Lured by a priceless, uncut yellow diamond gifted by the Chief of a Kaafi village, Alvarez and Carter had resolved to find the cave of these yellow diamonds, located on the Mountain of the Moon- Chander Pahar- in the Richtersveldt, which was believed to be guarded by the mythical monster, the Bunyip. The explorers set off, much against the villagers' advice, braved the dense jungle and hostile environment but met with disaster- for Carter was gruesomely killed, supposedly by the Bunyip. Shankar, highly inspired by Alvarez's exploits, resigns from his job and accompanies Alvarez as they decide to venture out once more and find the mines. They meet with innumerable hardships, a raging volcano being the greatest challenge. But the volcano was unknown to the world outside, thus making Shankar and Alvarez its first discoverers. Eventually, they get lost in the forests where Alvarez suffers death at the hands of a mysterious monster, the same that had taken Carter's life, the Bunyip. A grieved and demoralised Shankar sets out to attempt to reach civilization. He finds the Bunyip's cave and the diamond mines by accident. He enters the cave but eventually gets lost. With great difficulty, he gets out, marking his way with \\"pebbles\\" and taking some back with him as memento, not knowing each is a piece of uncut diamond. He finds the remains of the Italian explorer, Attilio Gatti, and learns that the cave he found earlier really was the diamond mine. Gatti, as Shankar learns from a note by him, had uncut diamonds in his boots. The note said that whoever reads the note can take the diamonds as long as he buries his skeleton, with Christian rites. Shankar does so, and keeps the old diamonds. He becomes lost in the deserts of Kalahari and nearly dies of thirst. He is rescued by a survey team, and taken to a hospital in Salisbury, Rhodesia, from where he sets sail for home. Before going back he wrote his account in a newspaper which earned him quite some money. In that he named the volcano after Alvarez. He ends the book saying that he will return to that cave one day with a large team, and continue the legacy of Alvarez, Carter and Gatti.

Gregory Maass & Nayoungim's idiosyncratic work brings together philosophy, psychoanalysis, cybernetics, cybernetic management, economy, fringe science, science fiction, art and craft, music, comics, conspiracy theory, sub-culture, and food by focusing on such diverse means as adaptation, normality, perversion, and methodology. They are the founders of Kim Kim Gallery, which describes itself as \\"a non-profit organization, locative art, an art dealership based on unconventional marketing, a curatorial approach, an exhibition design firm, and editor of rare art books, depending on the situation it adapts to; in short, it does not fit the format imposed by the term Gallery.\\" One rarely appears in public without the other. Early lives Gregory Maass was born in Hagen in North Rhine-Westphalia, northern Germany, his mother tongue being German. He worked as a paramedic before moving to Paris, France. He studied philosophy at the Paris-Sorbonne University and art at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, at the Institut des Hautes √âtudes en Arts Plastiques (IHEAP) Paris (1993‚Äì94) and at Jan Van Eyck Academie the Netherlands (1998-2000). Nayoungim was born in Seoul in South Korea. She studied art at the Seoul National University and later at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts. The two first met on 12 September 1991 while studying sculpture at the ENSBA. The two claim they came together because they are both egomaniacs who form a symbiosis. They communicate with each other in French and English. They have claimed that they married in 2008. Psychotic Mickey Mouse, Seoul Culture Station, 2012 Works Their work has addressed a wide variety of subject matters including scatology, survivalism, and economy. The two artists rarely appear in their own work. Mister, Relationships do not exist, 2010 Arsewipe Rocket, still life photography, Paris, 2008 =Toilet Paper Still Lifes= are often life-size photographic representations on canvas of toilet paper rolls arranged on a table top. Depending on the composition the images are called ‚ÄúArsewipe rocket‚Äù, \\"torche-cul\\", or ‚ÄúAss-ana‚Äù. =Relationships Do Not Exist= The pair is perhaps best known for their miniature work called \\"Relationships Do Not Exist\\". This group of sculptures is one of the largest series of work created by Gregory Maass & Nayoungim. Relationships Do Not Exist is among the more iconic, philosophically astute and visually humorous works that Gregory Maass & Nayoungim have created. The title derives from the famous Jacques Lacan quote ‚ÄúSexual relationships do not exist‚Äù.Jacques Lacan, Seminar XVIILe S√©minaire. Livre XVII. L'envers de la psychanalyse, 1969-70. Ed. Jacques-Alain Miller. Paris: Seuil, 1991: 134 They proceeded by choosing samples from a wide collection of figurines ranging from the 1950s until today. In an intricate process the bodies are dismembered and reassembled, painted and mounted on empty trophy pedestals.

It is a chromed steel snowman placed on a rooftop water tower of a local kindergarten. =Mona Lisa Overdrive= is a public art work, first installed in front of the Seoul Railway Station in 2008. It is made of rubber, toys, foam mattresses and steel frames, and sprayed over with expansion foam. The entire construction is painted with a collection of surplus paints.

Nevertheless, after the early 80s wave of popularity for Spanish-singing boy bands waned somewhat beginning in the mid-80s, groups such as Los Chicos and Mermelada ended up separating, only Menudo survived for a long period after that. Mermelada's separation was hastened by Monchy Capricho's departure from the group in the late 1980s, and the band survived for only a couple of years more.

It is patterned after the original Kalashnikov rifle and built on the heavier RPK light machine gun receiver. History Early versions of the Vepr-12 were produced by Izhmash, with production moving to the Molot factory where the shotgun was redesigned and mass-produced. The Vepr-12 is intended to be a direct competitor to the widely popular Saiga-12 shotgun already produced by Izhmash. Like the Saiga, the Vepr-12 was designed to be a versatile weapons platform, capable of being used by hunters and professional shooters alike. With these considerations in mind, Molot introduced unique features, such as the ambidextrous safety selector, the bolt hold-open mechanism and a simplified magazine feeding mechanism. See . Features Due to the large difference in size between the 7.62√ó39mm cartridge and 12-gauge shells, the extractor port has been lengthened, allowing the shotgun to eject spent shells without risk of causing a stovepipe malfunction. Like all firearms with the Vepr designation, the Vepr-12 receiver is patterned after that of the RPK light machine gun. The stamped steel receiver is reinforced, thicker (1.5 mm instead of 1 mm), and more heavily constructed than a standard Kalashnikov-pattern rifle. The Vepr-12 also incorporates a unique safety catch and bolt release mechanism. A side folding stock is present on most models; however, Vepr-12 shotguns are offered with fixed stocks as well. Instead of the standard AK safety selector, some Vepr-12 shotguns have an ambidextrous safety that can be manipulated from either side of the receiver. An unusual feature among firearms in the Kalashnikov family, the Vepr-12 sports a last round bolt hold-open mechanism. That is, the bolt locks to the rear of the receiver after the last round has been ejected. To facilitate rapid reloading of the shotgun, a bolt release lever is located inside the trigger guard, allowing the user to release the bolt without breaking grip.http://world.guns.ru/shotgun/rus/vepr-12-e.html The addition of a magazine well, another unusual feature for a Kalashnikov-pattern firearm, allows for \\"straight in\\" magazine insertion, as opposed to the \\"rock and lock\\" procedure required on standard AK rifles and the Saiga-12 shotgun. The Vepr-12 is also chrome lined throughout, including the gas block, barrel, and chamber, affording the shotgun excellent corrosion resistance. Unlike the IZ-109 manually adjustable gas regulator system used on the Saiga-12, the gas system on the Vepr-12 is a clone of the IZ-433 unregulated fixed open port tappet system, allowing the Vepr-12 to cycle most commercially available 12-gauge loads, from 3.25 dram equivalent and up, without risking damage to the shotgun and without requiring any manual adjustment by the user. This versatile system is often erroneously characterized as a \\"self-regulating\\" gas system. However, no variable regulating mechanism is present. Also, like the IZ-433, the gas block lacks a screw in gas adjuster. Instead, the piston is accessed in a manner familiar to users of traditional Kalashnikov rifles, by removal of the gas tube. A notch on the operating rod allows the user to hook the piston and pull it out to the rear for cleaning.http://forum.saiga-12.com/index.php?/topic/76772-vepr-12-gas-system- pics/ The Vepr-12 lacks the standard AK side mounting rail, instead using a Picatinny rail incorporated into the dust cover for optic mounting. The dust cover is hinged to the shotgun, allowing the user to open and close the cover without losing the zeroing of a mounted optic. Purpose The Vepr-12 was conceived for the Russian military and law enforcement market, with civilian applications ranging from hunting to self-defense and competition use. In particular, the shotgun has carved out a niche among IPSC competition shooters, one of the Vepr-12's target audiences. With its fixed open port gas system, the Vepr-12 can effectively cycle a multitude of 12-gauge loads, making it a highly versatile semi-automatic shotgun. Much like its cousin the Saiga-12, the Vepr-12 is ideal for clay shooting, with appropriate optics. Variants The Vepr-12 is manufactured in numerous variations, each with a unique designation. The Vepr-12 can use the same magazines as the Saiga-12 with modifications, but the Saiga-12 cannot use Vepr-12 magazines and drums. =–í–ü–û-205 (VPO-205)= The VPO-205 series is chambered for 12 Gauge [18.5x70mmR] and 12 Gauge Magnum [18.5x76mmR] shells. It has a side-folding two-strut folding stock with a buttpad and reversible cheekpad. *–í–ü–û-205-00 - Stock model with a 16.92-inch [430mm] barrel with detachable muzzle brake. It weighs 8.59 lbs.

It has short Picatinny rails on the sides of the forend and under the end of the barrel and long Picatinny rails on the top of the receiver and the bottom of the forend. It weighs 9.25 lbs.

[4.4 kg]. *–í–ü–û-206-02 - Competition model with a 26.77-inch [680mm] barrel with interchangeable chokes. Weighs 10 lbs. [4.55 kg]. Export and legal status The Vepr-12 is exported worldwide. Ownership in Russia requires only a smoothbore-gun license. Due to Russian law, domestic and many export versions of the shotgun are equipped with a disconnector that will render the gun unable to fire while the stock is folded (only if the length of the weapon gets less than 800 mm). The shotgun is also imported into the United States. Early American export models have no muzzle brake and have a fixed stock rather than a folding stock. Later models included a fully functional folding stock.

She has danced at venues across Europe as well as appearing in Beijing and Japan. Biography Born in St Petersburg, Smirnova comes from a family with no connections with ballet. Her mother encouraged her to take up the art at the Vaganova Academy where she studied under Lyudmila Kovaleva. The academy, which some consider as the source of modern ballet, is over 260 years old.Russian Ballet Celebrates 275 (!!!) Years , Dance Magazine, 2013, retrieved 13 March 2014 She participated in the academy's tours across Europe and Japan, performing in the 2004 presentation arranged jointly with the Royal Ballet School. In 2011, immediately after her graduation, she was recruited by the Bolshoi and spent just one day in the corps de ballet before taking on solos. Having joined the company as a soloist, she was promoted to first soloist in her first season and to leading soloist at the end of her second season in 2013. In 2011, while still a student at the Vaganova academy she appeared in London at the London Coliseum to commemorate Galina Ulanova, who is said to be one of the greatest of ballerinas. For the commemoration routine, which was choreographed by A. Messerer and accompanied by Dvo≈ô√°k's Melody, Smirnova danced with S. Strelkov. She also danced, in June of that year, at Diana Vishneva's benefit performance at the Mariinsky theatre. The following month she was in Beijing, partnered by the Bolshoi's principal dancer Semyon Chudin, performing Grand Pas Classique (choreography by V. Gsovsky) to music by the 19th century French composer Daniel Auber. In 2012 and 2013, she danced leading roles in La Bayad√®re, Diamonds, The Pharaoh's Daughter and Swan Lake. In 2013 she performed the role of Tatiana at the Bolshoi's premiere of Cranko's Onegin. She has created roles such as Bianca in Mailliot's Taming of the Shrew, Jorma Elmo's 'Dream of Dream', the Marquess in Pierre Lacotte's Marco Spada.

She also danced the principal part in Diamonds, a part which she premiered in 2012, in the Bolshoi's broadcast of Jewels. Assessment Writing in The Telegraph in March 2013, Mark Monahan found her \\"a truly extraordinary talent\\". He described her physique as: \\"Long-limbed, with a swan-like neck, superbly pliant spine and ravishing, sway-back classical line, she also has the agility of a soubrette. Her arms ripple with an unmistakably Russian, lighter-than-air lyricism, yet her soaring, apparently preparation-free jump, which heightens the impression of buoyancy, also suggests great muscular strength.\\" As for her dancing skills, he commented that \\"after barely 18 months, she is already a working definition of a star.\\" Commenting on her performance in Diamonds (August 2013), Luke Jennings of The Observer characterizes her as \\"the physically perfect instrument of her art form\\", revealing his enthusiasm for her pas de deux with Semyon Chudin at the Royal Opera House.

Larger revisions may cause changes to the whole system and a new version of the classification system is published. The latest, eighth revision was started in 2002 and was put in use in autumn 2006. Both the research libraries (via the National Library of Sweden) and the public libraries decided at the end of 2008 to recommend a transition to the Dewey Decimal system. The research libraries' major reason for transitioning are simplification: large parts of research literature is already classified in this system. For public libraries the concern is to have the same classification system over the entire country. A considerable savings would be enjoyed by both parties by not having to maintain a distinct national classification system. Structure SAB is built in a tree structure, where each individual subject has a signum. A signum is a code of one or more letters and sometimes other symbols, which together represent a particular subject category. The first letter, in upper case, indicates a general subject area (e.g. C for religion). Additional lower case letters after the initial letter indicate more specialized subjects (e.g. Cg for practical theology and Cge for cathechethics. There is in principle no limit to how many subcategories can be formed in this way. Additional notation A signum can be made more precise with additional notation. The following additional notations exist: * Geographic division (expressed with a hyphen) : Ab Libraries, Ab-c Libraries : Sweden or Qaea-j Monetary systems : France. * Chronological division (expressed with a period) : Kc.3 Swedish history : Middle ages. * Language specification (expressed with an equal sign) : Kj=e History of France: in English * Aspect (expressed with a colon) : F:do Language : psychology or Pcj:k Telephony : history * Biography (expressed with 'z' and the name of the subject of the biography) : Dcz Chomsky, Noam Logic and language-oriented philosophy : biographies of Noam Chomsky * Type of work (expressed with parentheses) : Ke(u) English history : primary source or Vpg(p) Nursing : periodical * Target audience (expressed with a comma or as a prefix to the signature stem) : Ih,u or uIh Arts and crafts : for children or young adults * Medium (expressed with a solidus) : Cba/LG Old testament : recording, gramophone record In addition special additional codes are available which are only used on particular signums. These always begin with .0. For instance, the category Fc (the Swedish language) can be subdivided * Fc.00 History of the Swedish language * Fc.01 Swedish grammar * Fc.011 Swedish phonetics * Fc.02 Swedish vocabulary etc. Additional notation may be combined. Thus, Ab-c:b(p) for Libraries : Sweden : research : periodicals.

In 1780 he enlisted in the French Royal Army. With the advent of the French Revolution his promotion became very rapid. In 1792 he was elected second in command of a volunteer battalion. He led his troops at Jemappes and Neerwinden. He was promoted to general of brigade in November 1793 and general of division in January 1794. A week later he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Army of the Ardennes. In May and June 1794, Charbonnier and Jacques Desjardin jointly led an army that tried three times to establish a foothold on the north bank of the Sambre River. After defeats in the battles of Grandreng, Erquelinnes and Gosselies, Charbonnier was recalled to Paris in semi-disgrace on 8 June 1794. After being unemployed for several months, he was assigned to command a series of garrisons in France and Belgium. He was governor of Maastricht from 1801 to 1814. He was buried in his hometown of Clamecy, Ni√®vre in 1833. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 4. Early career On 9 October 1754, Charbonnier was born the son of a shoemaker in Clamecy, a town in what later became the Ni√®vre departement. As a young man, he enlisted in the Vintimille Regiment as a simple soldier in 1780. The regiment was later renamed the 49th Line Infantry. His fellow soldiers gave him the nickname Fleur d'Orange (Orange Flower). On 18 July 1789 he joined the National Guard of Paris. Later that same year, he emerged as captain in the Clamecy National Guard. Soon appointed captain of a company in the 1st Ni√®vre Volunteer Battalion, he rose in rank to chef de bataillon (major) by the start of 1792. On 21 September 1792 he was elected second-in-command of the 21st National Volunteers Battalion. While with the Army of the North he fought under Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez in the battles of Jemappes and Neerwinden. A French order of battle for Jemappes does not list the 21st Battalion. However, the 1st Ni√®vre Battalion served in the 14th Brigade in the Left Wing under Jean Henri Becays Ferrand. Charbonnier was promoted to general of brigade on 14 November 1793. Army commander =Boussu-lez-Walcourt= Jacques Desjardin ‚Äì Charbonnier's colleague On 28 January 1794 Charbonnier was promoted again to general of division. From the same date he was appointed provisional commander of the Army of the Ardennes. He was named commander-in-chief of the army a week later, on 5 February. His chief of staff was Jean Victor Tharreau. During the winter the army's only activity was sending out foraging parties.Dupuis (1907), p. 33. The Army of the Ardennes was a subordinate force to the Army of the North and usually took its orders from that army's commander. On 4 April 1794, the army had 8,347 soldiers available for the field and 30,306 men in garrisons. The major garrisons were Givet and Philippeville while over 20 towns held smaller garrisons. The sole field division was led by Philippe Joseph Jacob and his brigadiers were Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge, Jean Louis Dessaubaz and Jean Baptiste Augier.Dupuis (1907), pp. 34‚Äì37. Opposite the French army were 27,000 Habsburg Austrian and Dutch soldiers led by Franz Wenzel, Graf von Kaunitz-Rietberg. The Coalition troops were strung out from west to east, with 5,000 near Dinant, 2,000 at Florennes, 2,000 at Boussu-lez- Walcourt, 5,000 at Beaumont, 2,000 at Erquelinnes, 10,000 at Bettignies and garrisons at Namur and Charleroi.Dupuis (1907), pp. 37‚Äì39. At the end of March, the Committee of Public Safety ordered Charbonnier to march on Namur. He received some reinforcements and assembled 15,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 15 position guns near Givet. In early April, the commander of the Army of the North Jean-Charles Pichegru directed Charbonnier to take position west of Philippeville. After a good deal of hesitation, the general finally marched his troops west to the new position on 22 April.Dupuis (1907), pp. 40‚Äì43. After fighting on 26 April his troops ousted the Austrians under Joseph Binder von Degenschild from Boussu-lez-Walcourt. The tactical direction of the clash was left to the leader of the advance guard, Jean Hardy. Degenschild retreated to the Sambre River at Thuin.Dupuis (1907), pp. 52‚Äì56. On the same day, Jacques Desjardin's division of the Army of the North attacked Beaumont which was farther west. On the 27th, Beaumont and Florennes were abandoned and their Coalition garrisons fell back to the Sambre.Dupuis (1907), pp. 65‚Äì66. =Grandreng= Franz von Kaunitz ‚Äì Charbonnier's adversary On 30 April 1794, the Coalition army under Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld successfully concluded the Siege of Landrecies.Smith (1998), p. 76. This event nearly split the Army of the North in half. The crisis precipitated a change in French strategy. Pichegru with 70,000 troops of the left wing was directed to capture Ypres and Tournai, while Jacques Ferrand and 24,000 soldiers held the center near Guise and Maubeuge. Desjardin with the right wing of the Army of the North and Charbonnier with the Army of the Ardennes were ordered to mass their 60,000 men near Philippeville. This force was directed to cross the Sambre near Thuin and advance northwest toward Mons. Amazingly, Pichegru neglected to appoint a single leader for the force, relying on the two generals to cooperate. Charbonnier received his orders on 6 May and immediately held a conference with Desjardin, Fran√ßois S√©verin Marceau-Desgraviers and their chiefs of staff where they drew up plans for the offensive.Dupuis (1907), p. 93. Shortly afterward, Charbonnier wanted to delay in order to get clearer instructions from Pichegru, but Desjardin emphasized that their orders were plain.Dupuis (1907), p. 94‚Äì95. In preparation, Charbonnier divided his 17,000-man field force into two divisions under Jacob and Marceau plus an independent detachment under Claude Vez√∫. The two divisions and Hardy's advanced guard were grouped into a corps under Marceau's tactical direction.Dupuis (1907), pp. 97‚Äì98 For his part, Desjardin commanded three divisions, his own and those of √âloi Laurent Despeaux and Jacques Fromentin plus an advanced guard under Guillaume Philibert Duhesme. Fran√ßois Muller took over Desjardin's former division.Dupuis (1907), pp. 101‚Äì103. The French offensive began on 10 May with an advance on the Sambre. By the 12th Kaunitz had withdrawn his forces from Merbes-le-Ch√¢teau into an intrenched position between Binche on the left and Grand-Reng on the right. In the Battle of Grandreng on 13 May, Muller and Despeaux assaulted Kaunitz's right flank, Fromentin attacked his center and the garrison of Maubeuge mounted a diversion. Austrian cavalry defeated Fromentin's division, then commanded by Duhesme after its commander was injured. Kaunitz counterattacked and compelled Desjardin to retreat to the south bank of the Sambre.Cust (1859), p. 205 The French suffered the loss of 4,000 men and 12 artillery pieces while Coalition losses numbered 2,800 killed, wounded and captured.Smith (1998), p. 79. During the fighting, the Army of the Ardennes divisions were inactive, leaving Desjardin's 35,000 men to fight Kaunitz's 22,000 Austrian and Dutch troops in a strong position. Screened by a handful of enemies, Jacob's division did not helpDupuis (1907), pp. 144‚Äì145. though it was nearby at Buverinnes. Marceau's division, accompanied by Charbonnier in person, was at Fontaine-l'√âv√™que baking bread!Dupuis (1907), p. 131. After Desjardin's withdrawal, Charbonnier's two idle divisions quickly followed suit.Dupuis (1907), p. 140 On 6 May two representatives on mission had written a letter to the Committee of Public Safety describing Charbonnier as incompetent and requesting a more experienced commander.Dupuis (1907), p. 121. It was probably during early May that a balloonist serving with the army overheard a weird conversation between the two commanders.Dupuis (1907), pp. 119‚Äì120. Charbonnier complained that his soldiers were starving in their encampments. He wanted to move across the Sambre in order to get food for his troops. Desjardin agreed but noted that they must organize the operation in the correct military way. Charbonnier replied, \\"Do you think so? Good, you arrange things militarily; you take charge of that. For me, I'm going to take charge of eating vegetables and pumping oils.\\" =Erquelinnes= Louis Saint-Just ‚Äì a dangerous man to oppose Alarmed by the panic that seized some French units on 13 May, representatives en mission Louis Antoine de Saint-Just and Philippe-Francois-Joseph Le Bas published an order promising death to any soldier who malingered or showed cowardice. In an attempt to unify the command structure Pichegru issued an order that called the Sambre force a single corps. To concert the force's actions, he created a council composed of Charbonnier, Desjardin, Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber and Barth√©lemy Louis Joseph Sch√©rer.Dupuis (1907), p. 149‚Äì150. In a reorganization, Jacob was replaced by Jean Adam Mayer, some battalions were exchanged between Mayer's and Marceau's divisions and Lorge was given command of an independent brigade called the Flankers of the Right.Dupuis (1907), p. 153‚Äì154. Soon after, Marceau became Desjardin's chief of staff and Vez√∫ took over Marceau's division.Dupuis (1907), p. 158 Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber ‚Äì saved the day On 20 May, the French crossed to the north bank of the Sambre and took up a position facing west with the left flank resting on Erquelinnes and the right flank at the Bonne-Esp√©rance Abbey. The following day Kaunitz mounted an attack on the new French position. The French were chased out of Erquelinnes but later recaptured the village and stopped the Coalition attack. Kl√©ber suggested using Mayer's unengaged division near Bonne-Esp√©rance to launch a counterattack on Kaunitz's left flank. But since Mayer belonged to the Army of the Ardennes, Desjardin declined to give the general a direct order. The order had to pass through Charbonnier, who was so far away that it was too late to do anything.Dupuis (1907), pp. 161‚Äì163. Vez√∫'s division was at Fontaine-l'√âv√™que and Charbonnier was preoccupied rounding up cattle and horses. There is evidence from his correspondence that Charbonnier was jealous of his authority as army commander-in-chief and was reluctant to follow Pichegru's instructions. He considered his army as an autonomous force and failed to appreciate that he must cooperate with Desjardin to gain success.Dupuis (1907), p. 164. On 22 May, the French troops built fieldworks to fortify their position. A council of war the following day determined to send Kl√©ber with 15,000 men on a raid north toward Nivelles.Dupuis (1907), pp. 166-169. Despite this decision, Charbonnier gave orders to Vez√∫ and Lorge to move east in the direction of Charleroi.Dupuis (1907), p. 171‚Äì172. The French generals completely ignored Kaunitz who formed his troops into five attack columns and a Dutch reserve.Dupuis (1907), pp. 173-174. The assault columns rolled forward at 2:30 AM on 24 May and achieved total surprise in the Battle of Erquelinnes. On the French left, the Austrians quickly overran Erquelinnes and forced the divisions of Anne Charles Basset Montaigu (formerly Despeaux's) and Muller to recross the river to Solre-le-Sambre. Near P√©chant (Peissant) Fromentin's division was also routed and fled.Dupuis (1907), pp. 175-177. Hearing the guns, Kl√©ber turned back from his mission and managed to block the Coalition pursuit long enough for Mayer's division to escape. The French lost 4,000 men, mostly prisoners, and 25 artillery pieces. Another authority estimated that the French lost 3,000 killed and wounded while the Coalition captured 2,400 men, 32 guns and three colors in the debacle. Kaunitz lost only 400 killed and wounded and 250 captured.Smith (1998), p. 81 =Gosselies= Fran√ßois Marceau ‚Äì division commander The next day, the representatives called a council of war at Thuin. The generals hoped for some time to reorganize and supply the soldiers with food and shoes, but during the meeting Saint-Just cut off all further discussion by declaring, \\"Tomorrow you will make a victory for the Republic: choose between a siege or a battle\\". Reinforcements from the Army of the Moselle were expected to arrive but Saint-Just was a very dangerous man to oppose.Cust (1859), p. 206 On a visit to the army in Alsace, Saint-Just announced that a general must be executed for the good of the army and Augustin-Joseph Isambert was shot for abandoning a position. The divisions of Montaigu and Muller were placed under Sch√©rer and ordered to guard the Sambre between Solre-le-Sambre and Aulne Abbey. Marceau was given a newly created division and the staffs of Charbonnier and Desjardin were merged. The forces of Marceau, Vez√∫, Mayer and Fromentin numbered about 30,000.Dupuis (1907), pp. 185-187 On 26 May Marceau advanced toward the La Tombe camp south of Charleroi. Fromentin's division was repulsed but other divisions crossed the Sambre again. Marceau's troops went on strike and refused to attack, but the Austrians were unaware of this and evacuated the La Tombe camp that night. Encouraged, the French bombarded and captured Marchienne-au-Pont on the 29th, allowing Marceau and Fromentin to cross the Sambre. On 30 May, Charleroi was completely invested by a ring of French troops and Mayer's division entrusted with the siege operations. Meanwhile, Kaunitz was replaced by the Hereditary Prince William of Orange and the Coalition army was reinforced to 35,000 troops on 1 June. Orange planned a concentric attack on the 3rd with one column attacking Fontaine-l'√âv√™que on the east side, a second Gosselies on the north, a third Ransart on the north-northeast and a fourth Fleurus on the northeast. In the Battle of Gosselies the third and fourth columns brushed aside Vez√∫'s division. Caught between the second and third columns, Fromentin had to retreat quickly. Mayer's division was nearly trapped between the successful Coalition attackers and the garrison of Charleroi, but managed to escape thanks to Marceau who held the bridge at Marchienne-au-Pont.Cust (1859), p. 207 The French lost 2,000 men and one cannon while Coalition losses numbered 444.Dupuis (1907), p. 212 Jean-Baptiste Jourdan arrived the next day with 40,000 men of the Army of the Moselle and took command of the entire force, which would soon be called the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse. After the Gosselies defeat, engineer officer Armand Samuel de Marescot wrote to his friend Lazare Carnot on the Committee of Public Safety, explaining that a divided command and bad tactics were the cause of the repeated defeats and that the soldiers were becoming discouraged. He noted that better leaders were wanted. La Bas returned to Paris at this time to report that the current command arrangements were not working. Consequently, the Committee of Public Safety directed Desjardin and Charbonnier to come to ParisDupuis (1907), pp. 262-263 The order arrived on 8 June. Later career After his recall Charbonnier was not used for a time. Returning to Clamecy in disgrace, he nevertheless remained popular in his hometown. While there, he took a prominent part in the Cult of the Supreme Being festival. Soon after, the Thermidorian Reaction resulted in the execution of Maximilien Robespierre and the fall of his government. At this time, Charbonnier reestablished the Clamecy Soci√©t√© Populaire which had been banned by Joseph Fouch√© and the radicals. Finally, he received instructions to take charge of the Clamecy National Guard on 7 December 1794. He became military governor of Boulogne- sur-Mer on 12 September 1795. He received temporary appointments to command Givet and Charlemont on 18 February 1796 and Li√®ge on 3 April 1798. He served as military governor of Maastricht starting on 21 April 1801. Among his duties was the supervision of advance posts on the south bank of the Scheldt during the Walcheren Campaign of 1809. He continued in command of Maastricht until May 1814, after Napoleon's abdication. He died on 2 June 1833. Two authorities asserted that he died at Givet while another source declared that he died in his hometown of Clamecy where he was buried.

It is a reboot of The Mummy franchise and is the first installment in Universal's Dark Universe franchise. The film stars Tom Cruise as U.S. Army Sergeant Nick Morton, a soldier of fortune who accidentally unearths the ancient tomb of entrapped Egyptian princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella). Annabelle Wallis, Jake Johnson, Courtney B. Vance, and Russell Crowe also star. The Mummy premiered at the State Theatre in Sydney, Australia, on May 22, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 9, 2017, in 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and despite grossing $410 million worldwide, it was considered a box-office bomb, losing the studio as much as $95 million. Plot In present-day London, construction workers discover the tomb of a crusader knight who was buried with an Egyptian ruby in 1127 AD. In Iraq, U.S. Army soldiers Sergeant Nick Morton and Corporal Chris Vail discover the tomb of Princess Ahmanet, who attempted to summon the deity Set; she was caught and mummified alive. They and archaeologist Jenny Halsey fly Ahmanet's sarcophagus to Britain. During the flight, Chris is possessed by Ahmanet through a spider that bit him in the tomb and attacks the others, and is killed by Nick. Many crows attack the plane, causing it to crash, killing the crew except Jenny, who escapes by a parachute Nick gives her. Nick returns to life in a morgue. Chris's ghost appears and tells him he has been cursed by Ahmanet, who seeks to use him as a vessel for Set. Ahmanet's mummy escapes from the sarcophagus and begins feeding on people to regenerate her body; she recovers the Dagger of Set and turns workers into zombies. They trap Nick and Jenny. Soldiers appear and subdue Ahmanet. Their leader, Dr. Henry Jekyll, explains that Jenny is an agent of Prodigium, a secret society dedicated to hunting supernatural threats. Nick and Jenny discover that Dr. Jekyll intends to allow Set to possess Nick completely, believing that this will render Set vulnerable. Jekyll transforms into Edward Hyde. Nick stops him with a serum that Jekyll invented for this purpose, and he and Jenny escape. Ahmanet finds them, regains the dagger, summons many crusader zombies, and creates a large sandstorm in London. Nick and Jenny escape again. The crusader zombies kill the Prodigium soldiers and Ahmanet recovers the ruby, combining it with the dagger in order to free Set. Guided by Chris's ghost, Nick and Jenny flee into the London Underground, where they are attacked by Ahmanet's minions. Ahmanet captures Jenny and drowns her. Nick is injured when he tries to attack Ahmanet, and he lets Ahmanet embrace him as a ruse to steal the dagger and shatter the ruby. He strikes the pommel of the dagger against the floor, cracking the ruby. As he is about to shatter the ruby, Ahmanet reminds him that the dagger could grant him the power to reverse death. Instead of destroying the gem, he stabs himself; because the ruby is cracked, he is only partially possessed by Set. Nick goes to Ahmanet, but, remembering the words of Jenny and Dr. Jekyll, he turns on her and uses Set's powers to extract Ahmanet's lifeforce and resurrect Jenny. Knowing the Prodigium are coming for him, he says goodbye to Jenny and vanishes. As Ahmanet is sealed back in her tomb, Jenny and Dr. Jekyll wonder whether Nick, now fused with Set, will use his powers for good. Nick returns to the desert and resurrects Chris. The two go on to a new adventure. Cast Director Alex Kurtzman with the film's main actors. Left to right: Sofia Boutella, Tom Cruise, Annabelle Wallis, Russell Crowe. * Tom Cruise as Nick Morton, a U.S. Army sergeant. * Sofia Boutella as Ahmanet, the title character.

Production =Development= Universal Pictures first announced plans for a modern reboot of The Mummy franchise in 2012. The project went through multiple directors, with Len Wiseman leaving the project in 2013, and a second director, Andr√©s Muschietti, in 2014. Tom Cruise began talks about playing the lead in November 2015, with Sofia Boutella beginning talks that December. Gwen Stefani, Jamie Chung, Lindsey Stirling and Brooke Shields were also considered. Kurtzman cast Boutella after seeing and being impressed by her largely mute performance in Kingsman: The Secret Service. Kurtzman noted that \\"if you look at her eyes, and this is what I got from watching Kingsman, there's a whole performance going on here. And in not saying anything but conveying that much to me, I thought oh my god, no matter how much prosthetics we put on her, no matter how much CG we put on her face, if I see this, she's going to convey something very emotional to me.\\" Other casting news was announced between March and May, with Russell Crowe joining during the latter month. Shortly after the film opened, Variety reported that Cruise had excessive control over the film and firm control of nearly every aspect of production and post-production, including re-writing the script and editing to his specifications, telling Kurtzman how to direct on set, and enlarging his role while downplaying Boutella's. Universal contractually guaranteed Cruise control of most aspects of the project, from script approval to post-production decisions. In a statement, Universal denied that Cruise had a negative influence on the production, ‚ÄúTom approaches every project with a level of commitment and dedication that is unmatched by most working in our business today,‚Äù the statement read. ‚ÄúHe has been a true partner and creative collaborator, and his goal with any project he works on is to provide audiences with a truly cinematic moviegoing experience.‚Äù Kurtzman said about the movie in a 2019 interview that, \\"The Mummy wasn‚Äôt what I wanted it to be. I‚Äôm no longer involved in that and have no idea what‚Äôs going on with it. I look back on it now [and] what felt painful at the time ended up being an incredible blessing for me.\\" =Filming= Principal photography on the film began on April 3, 2016, in Oxford, United Kingdom. Filming on the movie concluded on July 17, 2016, in London. Production then moved to Namibia for two weeks, with principal photography wrapping up on August 13, 2016. For the filming of the plane crash the production made use of The Vomit Comet and parabolic flight to simulate the illusion of weightlessness. The crew did a total of 64 takes with many of the crew becoming sick to their stomachs. Initially Kurtzman planned to shoot the scene entirely using wires and a rotating set, however Cruise's insistence changed his mind. Music Composer Brian Tyler started work on the music for the movie early, writing about a half hour of music before filming even began. Working on the film for a year and half, Tyler recorded with an 84-piece orchestra and 32-voice choir at London's Abbey Road. He ultimately wrote and recorded over two hours of music, which, given the length of the film (110 minutes), resulted in a soundtrack album longer than the film itself. Release Initially scheduled for a 2016 release, the film was released in the United States and Canada on June 9, 2017, with international roll out beginning the same day. The film was screened in various formats, such as 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D. On December 20, 2016, IMAX released a trailer with the wrong audio track attached; this unintentionally prompted the creation of memes and video montages featuring the mistakenly included audio track, which was missing most of the sound effects and instead featured Tom Cruise's grunts and screams. IMAX reacted by taking down the trailer and issuing DMCA takedown notices in an attempt to stop it from spreading. Reception =Box office= The Mummy grossed $80.2 million in the United States and Canada and $329.8 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $410 million. Due to a combined production and marketing cost of $345 million, it was estimated the film needed to gross $450 million in order to break-even, and ended up losing the studio between $60‚Äì100 million. United States and Canada In North America, the film was released alongside It Comes at Night and Megan Leavey and was originally projected to gross $35‚Äì40 million from 4,034 theaters in its opening weekend. However, after making $12 million on its first day (including $2.66 million from Thursday night previews), weekend projections were lowered to $30 million. It ended up debuting to $31.7 million, marking the lowest of the Mummy franchise and finishing second at the box office behind Wonder Woman ($58.2 million in its second week). Deadline Hollywood attributed the film's underperformance to poor critic and audience reactions, as well as \\"blockbuster fatigue.\\" In its second weekend the film made $14.5 million (dropping 54.2%), finishing 4th at the box office. It was pulled from 827 theaters in its third week and made $5.8 million, dropping another 60% and finishing 6th at the box office. International Outside North America, the film opened in 63 overseas territories, with China, the UK, Mexico, Germany, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Russia receiving the film the same day as in North America, and was projected to debut to $125‚Äì135 million. It opened on June 6, 2017 in South Korea and grossed $6.6 million on its first day, the biggest-ever debut for both Tom Cruise and Universal in the country. It ended up having a foreign debut of $140.7 million, the biggest of Cruise's career. In its opening weekend the film made $52.4 million in China, $7.4 million in Russia, $4.9 million in Mexico and $4.2 million in the United Kingdom. As of July 9, 2017, The film other big markets are China ($91.5 million), South Korea ($26.2 million), Russia and the CIS ($15.9 million) and Brazil ($13.2 million). =Critical response= The Mummy received generally negative reviews from critics, with criticism aimed at its narrative tone, acting, and plot points setting up the Dark Universe. On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 16% based on 307 reviews, with an average rating of 4.18/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Lacking the campy fun of the franchise's most recent entries and failing to deliver many monster-movie thrills, The Mummy suggests a speedy unraveling for the Dark Universe.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 34 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚àí\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 70% overall positive score. Vince Mancini of Uproxx gave the film a negative review, writing: \\"If you like incomprehensible collections of things that vaguely resemble other things you might've enjoyed in the past, The Mummy is the movie for you.\\" IndieWire's David Ehrlich gave the film a D‚Äì, calling it the worst film of Cruise's career and criticizing its lack of originality, saying: \\"It's one thing to excavate the iconography of old Hollywood, it's another to exploit it. This isn't filmmaking, it's tomb-raiding.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: \\"The problem at its heart is that the reality of what the movie is‚Äîa Tom Cruise vehicle‚Äîis at war with the material. The actor, at 54, is still playing that old Cruise trope, the selfish cocky semi-scoundrel who has to grow up. ... The trouble is that Cruise, at least in a high-powered potboiler like this one, is so devoted to maintaining his image as a clear and wholesome hero that his flirtation with the dark side is almost entirely theoretical.\\" Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film one star out of four, saying: \\"How meh is The Mummy? Let me count the ways. For all the huffing and puffing and digital desperation from overworked computers, this reboot lands onscreen with a resounding thud.\\" Glen Kenny of RogerEbert.com gave the film 1.5/4 stars, writing: \\"I found something almost admirable about the film's cheek. It's amazingly relentless in its naked borrowing from other, better horror and sci-fi movies that I was able to keep occupied making a checklist of the movies referenced.\\" Entertainment Weeklys Chis Nashawaty wrote that the film \\"feels derivative and unnecessary and like it was written by committee.\\" In BBC World News Culture, Nicholas Barber calls the film \\"a mish-mash of wildly varying tones and plot strands, from its convoluted beginning to its shameless non-end. Tom Cruise's new film barely qualifies as a film at all. None of it makes sense. The film delivers all the chases, explosions, zombies and ghosts you could ask for, and there are a few amusing lines and creepy moments, but, between the headache-inducing flashbacks and hallucinations, the narrative would be easier to follow if it were written in hieroglyphics.\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote that the film \\"has some nice moments but is basically a mess. The plot sags like an aeon-old decaying limb, a jumble of ideas and scenes from what look like different screenplay drafts.\\" The Guardian Empire film magazine was more positive, with Dan Jolin awarding the film three stars. \\"It's running and jumping grin-flashing business as usual for Cruise, once more on safe character territory as an Ethan Hunt-esque action protagonist who couples up with a much younger woman, while another woman chases after him,\\" he wrote. \\"And if the next installment- teasing conclusion is anything to go by, Cruise seemed to have enough fun making this that he may just return for more.\\" =Accolades= The film received 8 nominations at the 38th Golden Raspberry Awards. Cruise won the Razzie for Worst Actor. Other media =Video game= A video game based on the film, The Mummy Demastered, was released on October 24, 2017. It is a Metroidvania featuring a stand-alone story, which takes place concurrently with the events of the film and follows Prodigium soldiers under the command of Dr. Jekyll who fight the forces of Princess Ahmanet; unlike the film, it received positive reviews. Abandoned sequel The film was part of Universal Pictures' Dark Universe, an attempt to create a modern cinematic universe based on the classic Universal Monsters film series. A remake of Bride of Frankenstein was originally scheduled for release on February 14, 2019, but on October 5, 2017, Universal decided to postpone it to allow more work to be done on the script. The 2014 film Dracula Untold was originally considered to be the first film in the series; however, since the film's release, the connection to the Dark Universe was downplayed, and The Mummy was re- positioned as the first film in the series.‚ÄòInvisible Man‚Äô Finds Director, Sets New Course for Universal‚Äôs Monster Legacy (EXCLUSIVE) By 2019, Universal announced plans to return to standalone features instead of using a shared film narrative, which discontinues and cancels the Dark Universe.'Invisible Man' Finds Director, Sets New Course for Universal‚Äôs Monster Legacy (EXCLUSIVE) Notes References External links  Category:2017 films Category:2017 horror films Category:2010s action adventure films Category:2010s fantasy adventure films Category:Action films featuring female antagonists Category:American films Category:American film remakes Category:American fantasy adventure films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American monster movies Category:Dark fantasy films Category:Fantasy action films Category:Films based on Egyptian mythology Category:The Mummy (franchise) Category:Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde films Category:IMAX films Category:Mummy films Category:Reboot films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:K/O Paper Products films Category:Films produced by Chris Morgan Category:Films produced by Roberto Orci Category:Films produced by Sean Daniel Category:Films set in ancient Egypt Category:Films set in Iraq Category:Films set in London Category:Films shot in England Category:Films shot in Surrey Category:Films shot in Morocco Category:Films shot in Namibia Category:Films scored by Brian Tyler Category:Patricide in fiction Category:Films with screenplays by Christopher McQuarrie Category:Films with screenplays by David Koepp Category:Films about princesses Category:Dentsu films Category:Perfect World Pictures films Category:2010s monster movies Category:2017 3D films ","title":"The Mummy (2017 film)"},{"id":"42127126","text":"Daban () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Dabansky Rural Okrug of Olyokminsky District in the Sakha Republic, Russia, located from Olyokminsk, the administrative center of the district.Registry of the Administrative-Territorial Divisions of the Sakha Republic Its population as of the 2002 Census was 562.

In addition, if a large number of financial firms fail at the same time, this can disrupt the overall financial system. Therefore, micro-prudential regulation also reduces systemic risk.

Martha Gurney was a Baptist and abolitionist, active in the production of pamphlet literature.http://www.brycchancarey.com/abolition/gurney.htm Gurney also associated with the radical William Fox, and was a friend of William Hawes.http://www.brycchancarey.com/abolition/williamfox.htm Gurney was employed officially after 1790 to report civil cases in courts of law. In 1786 he attended as a reporter to some slave-trade inquiries in the House of Lords. Recognised as a leading figure in his field, Gurney once commented that, of all speakers, he had most difficulty in transcribing the words of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The reason was that it was difficult to anticipate how sentences would come to an end. At the Warren Hastings trial, Gurney acted as shorthand writer for the government; William Isaac Blanchard did so for the defence. The stenographic world was small, and Blanchard had previously been Gurney's assistant. Indeed, by the 1780s newspaper reporting was undermining the business model of commercial court reporters. In May 1789 the House of Commons called on Gurney to read, from his notes Edmund Burke's words accusing Sir Elijah Impey of murder; and a vote of censure on Burke was then passed. According to Thompson Cooper, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, this incident was the first public acknowledgment of the verbal accuracy of shorthand. In 1791 the House of Commons first used shorthand for reporting the proceedings of one of its committees on the Eau-Brink Drainage Bill. In the same year, Gurney took notes of six election petition committees. In 1802 an act was passed authorizing the regular use of shorthand in election committees; and in the following year, a select committee of the House of Commons having reported positively, it was generally applied to other committees. Works Gurney edited the ninth edition of his father Thomas Gurney's Brachygraphy in 1778. While Thomas Gurney had adopted the system of William Mason, his son as editor dropped mention of Mason's name. Gurney was known for printed reports of major contemporary trials from his official shorthand notes. An early example was from 1770, of the libel case brought by George Onslow against John Horne Tooke. By 1773, with the trial of John Mostyn, he was publishing reports as books. There were around 40 of those, and Gurney employed clerks to transcribe for him. The reports included: *The trial (at large) of the Rev. Henry Bate, with the previous proceedings, upon an information exhibited against him by His Grace the Duke of Richmond, for a libel (1780) *The Trial of George Gordon, Esquire, commonly called Lord George Gordon (1781 or 1782) *The Whole Proceedings on the Trial of the Hon. Major Henry Fitzroy Stanhope: At a Court Martial Held at the Horse Guards, in the Month of June 1783. *The Sentence of the Court-martial... for the Trial of the Hon. Lieut. Gen. James Murray, Late Governor of Minorca, on the Twenty-nine Articles Exhibited Against Him by Sir William Draper (1783) *The trial of John Horne Tooke, on a charge of high treason (1794, 1795) *The Trial of Thomas Hardy for High Treason: At the Sessions House in the Old Bailey, on Tuesday the Twenty-eighth, Wednesday the Twenty-ninth, Thursday the Thirtieth, Friday the Thirty-first of October, and on Saturday the First, Monday the Third, Tuesday the Fourth, and Wednesday the Fifth of November 1794 (1794 and further volumes) *The Trial of William Stone for High Treason, at the Bar of the Court of King's Bench, on Thursday the Twenty-Eighth, and Friday the Twenty-Ninth, of January 1796 (1796).

Gurney also edited The Gospel Magazine. He had a sideline in sermons, publishing some of George Whitefield. Samuel Fisher (1742‚Äì1803) was a Baptist minister and family connection, having married Rebecca Gurney's widowed mother. Gurney published his sermons.Edward Deacon, Samuel Fisher, Baptist minister of Norwich and Wisbech, England, 1742‚Äì1803 (1911), p. 31; archive.org. Family Gurney married Rebecca Brodie (1747‚Äì1818), daughter of William Brodie of Mansfield. Their two sons were Sir John Gurney, and William Brodie Gurney. Their daughter Elizabeth (1770‚Äì1840) was a close friend of Eliza Gould.Whelan, p. xxxiii.

It is identified by the initials Z. LI and falls within the boundaries of Municipio XV. The name La Storta (\\"the curve\\"; literally twisted or bent) refers to a series of curves that the Via Cassia makes through the settlement. History =Statio on the Via Francigena= During the Middle Ages the locality was positioned along the Via Francigena, and was specifically mentioned as being a stop on the itinerary of Sigeric the Serious during his journey to Rome to accept the pallium as archbishop of Canterbury. The surviving account of his journey refers to La Storta as [Submansio] Joannis VIIII, the first stop outside of the city of Rome. The stop was also referred to as San Giovanni in Nono (), since the way station was constructed next to a church dedicated to Saint John, and positioned at the nine-mile marker from the start of the Via Cassia. =Vision of Saint Ignatius= In November 1537, Ignatius of Loyola was traveling the Via Cassia towards Rome, accompanied by Peter Faber and Diego Laynez. The group paused at a small church in La Storta to pray. It was there that Ignatius is reported to have received a vision of God the Father and Christ holding the cross. Ignatius would later report that the Father had \\"given him ... to be henceforward consecrated wholly to His service,\\" and Christ spoke the words Ego tibi Romae propitius ero (\\"I will be favorable to you in Rome\\"). The meaning of the sentence was not immediately clear to Ignatius, who thought it could mean that the three might be martyred at Rome. Pope Paul III instead gave him a very friendly reception. The location of the apparition is memorialized today with a small chapel dedicated to Saint Ignatius in the Piazza della Visione (\\"Square of the Vision\\"). The site of the vision was a place of pilgrimage from the early days of the Society of Jesus, but the current form of the chapel was achieved only in the year 1700, when it was restored and decorated by the Superior General Thyrsus Gonz√°lez de Santalla. The community celebrates the vision with its own feast day, the Feast of the Vision of Saint Ignatius. (The feast day is not, however, an ancient tradition, having been celebrated for the first time in 2011.) The feast is celebrated on the second Sunday of November, and is marked by processions, bands, and a reenactment of the vision. =La Storta Massacre= On June 4, 1944, the Nazis, who were fleeing from Rome after its liberation, carried out the massacre of fourteen prisoners in the community. Twelve of the fourteen were Italians, including the trade unionist Bruno Buozzi; the other two were a Polish Jew and the Englishman John Armstrong. The German soldiers were moving out in a column of vehicles during the night of June 3 to June 4, attempting to escape the Allied advance on the city, and executed the prisoners on the grounds of the Grazioli estate in the country, a forested area down the Via Cassia from La Storta. It is not known who issued the order. =Ecclesiastical territory= La Storta is the seat of the bishop of the Suburbicarian Diocese of Porto-Santa Rufina, the territory of which stretches from the GRA to the Tyrrhenian Sea. The Cathedral of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary () is located in La Storta. The construction of the present-day cathedral building was abandoned in 1926, having been a project of a German Jesuit, Father Leopoldo Fonck, who intended the church to be dedicated to Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque. Construction was suspended, however, and the building was not completed until Cardinal Tisserant took a personal interest and raised funds from sources including the United States. The new cathedral was dedicated on March 25, 1950, hosted a diocesan synod in August 1957, and was visited by Pope Pius XII on October 27 of the same year. In 1990, construction of a diocesan curia building was completed nearby.  Geography  The territory of La Storta includes the urban zone 20H La Storta and part of the urban zone 19G Castelluccia. It also includes the locality of Pian Saccoccia (piano di zona B49): here is located an unauthorized settlement for which the municipality approved a restoration plan. =Boundaries= The zone borders, to the north, with Zona Cesano (Z. LII), from which is separated by the Rio Galeria and by Via di Baccanello, up to Via Cassia. Eastward, it borders with Zona Isola Farnese (Z. LV), whose border is marked by the stretch of Via Cassia between Via di Baccanello and Via Isola Farnese, by Via Isola Farnese itself, by the countryside up to Via Prato della Corte and by Via Prato della Corte up to the Cremera, the by the stream itself To the east, La Storta also borders with Zona La Giustiniana (Z. LIV), whose border is outlinde by the Cremera, by Via Anna Fo√†, by the countryside up to Via Giacomo Andreassi, then by Via Cassia and Via Trionfale, up to the GRA. To the south, the zone borders with Zona Ottavia (Z. L), from which is separated by the stretch of the GRA between Via Trionfale and Via Cogliate. Southward, La Storta also borders with Zona Casalotti (Z. XLVIII), whose border is outlined by the countryside between Via Cogliate and Via della Storta, by a stretch of Via della Storta itself, then by the countryside up to the Rio Galeria and by the stream itself. Westward, La Storta borders with Zona Santa Maria di Galeria (Z. XLIX), from which is separated by the Rio Galeria, up to Via Braccianese. =Odonymy= For the most part, odonyms of La Storta refers to Italian playwrights and theatre directors. In the southern part of the zone, some streets are named after cardinals, saints and religious benefactors. Streets in the locality of Pian Saccoccia are mainly named after prominent publishers.

(1922) The Free Exhibitions (Swedish: Den Fria Konstutst√§llningen, Finnish: Vapaat taiden√§yttelyt) were art exhibitions organized in Helsinki, Finland in the years 1896, 1898, 1900 and 1903. They were labeled \\"free\\" because they did not have a jury to decide whose paintings or sculptures could be on display as other art exhibitions in Finland did at the time. These exhibitions were organized by the artist Sigurd Wettenhovi- Aspa (1870‚Äì1946), who also had the largest number of works displayed in all of the Free Exhibitions. The artist Torsten Wasastjerna was also involved in the organization of the first two exhibitions. The exhibitions attracted attention among the press and public and even a few of Finland's most famous artists, including Eero J√§rnefelt and Walter Runeberg, participated in one of them. However, the exhibitions gradually lost their popularity, and at the last exhibition in 1903, Sigurd Wettenhovi-Aspa and his brother Ragnar Asp were the only two exhibitors.  Wettenhovi-Aspa as an artist  Wettenhovi-Aspa studied art in Denmark, where he was taught by artists such as Kristian Zahrtmann and Peder Severin Kr√∏yer. In 1892, Wettenhovi-Aspa moved to Paris after he was awarded a grant. While living in Paris, Wettenhovi-Aspa took part in the Salon de la Rose + Croix in 1893 with Finnish sculptor Ville Vallgren and in Salon de Champ-de-Mars in 1894. In 1895, he was awarded a gold medal in an art exhibition in St. Etienne, France. Wettenhovi-Aspa had made his debut as a painter in 1891 in the Finnish Art Society's exhibition. He was a regular participant in Finnish art exhibitions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but he also arranged many exhibitions in Finland and other Nordic countries. Throughout his career, Wettenhovi-Aspa was seen in the Finnish press as a person seeking publicity and sensation whose art was at best controversial and amateurish. Wettenhovi-Aspa was a much contested figure in the Finnish art world, but at the same time, he was friends with many famous Finnish creative artists including composer Jean Sibelius and painter Akseli Gall√©n-Kallela.  Free exhibitions = 1896 = The Ateneum in Helsinki (2013) All willing artists were urged to send their works to this Free Exhibition, which opened on 10 December 1896 in the Ateneum Art Museum's hall. The exhibition closed on 10 January 1897 and was seen by over 3,000 paying visitors. Wettenhovi-Aspa displayed 85 works of art and was thus the most substantial exhibitor. The other artists in the first Free Exhibition were Wettenhovi-Aspa's wife Divina Asp, his brother Ragnar Asp, co-organizer Torsten Wasastjerna, Thorsten Waenerberg, C. E. Sj√∂strand, Karin Nordenswan and Miss Boldt. The exhibition expanded after its opening as artists like A. J. Rapp send their work to be exhibited there. As the majority of the art work on view was Wettenhovi-Aspa's, the press had the notion that the Free Exhibition was, in fact, his solo exhibition. Likely due to this, the other artists' pieces were not reviewed as closely as Wettenhovi-Aspa's. The press seemed to believe that in an open exhibition the works of art on display were weak and inadequate; paintings or sculptures made with skill were not expected to be encountered. Generally speaking, the press responded to the exhibition critically and questioned its artistic value. Nonetheless, the first Free Exhibition was also described as interesting, worth the visit and possessing potential. =1898 = Eero J√§rnefelt (1920s) The second Free Exhibition opened on 2 April 1898 in the Ateneum Art Museum's hall, once again organized by Sigurd Wettenhovi-Aspa and Torsten Wasastjerna. Twenty-three painters and 4 sculptors entered the exhibition; in addition, there were 9 unsigned works. The artists were Walter Runeberg, Thorsten Waenerberg, Eero J√§rnefelt, Carl Eneas Sj√∂strand, Alex Federley, Vilhelm Sj√∂str√∂m, J. Montell, Hanna R√∂nnberg, G. Rosinsky, Oskar Svenberg, Alexander Barkoff, Arthur Harald Gall√©n, Maria Kolnitsch, Baron Taube, A. J. Rapp, H. Sjernvall, J. F. Tuhkanen, Adolf von Becker, Hugo Backmansson, A. Sandberg, Elis Nystr√∂m, A. Loux, Ragnar Asp, Divina Asp and naturally Sigurd Wettenhovi-Aspa and Torsten Wasastjerna. Wettenhovi-Aspa had on display several sculptures and approximately 20 paintings. In total, there were 120 words of art being exhibited; of these, 106 were paintings and the rest were sculptures. The exhibition expanded again after its opening when J. E. Engelberg, among others, sent a few landscapes to be displayed. The second Free Exhibition closed on 26 April 1898, and in all, it had over 4,000 visitors. Once again, the exhibition was seen in the press as mainly an exhibition of Wettenhovi-Aspa's works. Other artists' did not receive as much notice as Wettenhovi-Aspa, with the exception of Alexander Barkoff, whose art was seen both as trash and interesting. Some of the critics regarded the exhibition as refreshing and interesting and wished it plenty of visitors. Others considered the exhibition substandard. = 1900 = The Kappeli Restaurant (2007) Wettenhovi-Aspa organized the third Free Exhibition alone in 1900. The exhibition opened on 11 November 1900, and unlike the previous two exhibitions, was not held in the Ateneum Art Museum because it was under renovation. Instead, the exhibition was organized in the Kappeli Restaurant on Helsinki's Esplanade. There were 9 participants in the third Free Exhibition: Sigurd Wettenhovi-Aspa, his brother Ragnar Asp, Alexander Barkoff, John Rafael Eklund, Teuvo Koskelo, Arvid Liljelund, A. J. Rapp, Karl Walter Smedberg and an artist going by the pseudonym \\"Henni\\". Arvid Liljelund's artwork was exhibited posthumously. The exhibition closed on 11 November 1900, and during the month it was open, it had over 5,700 visitors. Press focused once again mainly on criticizing Wettenhovi-Aspa and his works of art. Alexander Barkoff was said to stand out, and the other artists who were exhibited were mentioned only briefly. The exhibition was, yet again, seen as Wettenhovi-Aspa's solo exhibition. The exhibition's critiques were somewhat inconsistent. While some reporters said the artwork on display was ugly and amateurish, others felt the exhibition gave pleasure and food for thought. = 1903 = The fourth and the last Free Exhibition opened to the public on 5 April 1903. The venue was once again the Ateneum Art Museum. There were musical performances in the opening, and it was announced as the biggest and the most interesting Free Exhibition to date. The only exhibitors in the fourth Free Exhibition were Sigurd Wettenhovi-Aspa and his brother Ragnar Asp. Wettenhovi-Aspa had 47 pieces of artwork on display and Ragnar Asp had 6. Wettenhovi-Aspa's pieces were history paintings, portraits, landscapes and busts. Ragnar Asp had made a few landscapes and a copy of a Rembrandt. Also, J. E. Engelberg sent a large landscape to the exhibition to be put on display after the opening. The exhibition was said to have had a substantial number of visitors when it closed on 28 April 1903. Because Wettenhovi-Aspa and his brother were the only participants in the exhibition, the press focused on Wettenhovi-Aspa's artwork and wrote virtually nothing about Ragnar Asp. Generally, it was thought that Wettenhovi-Aspa had grand ideas but that his technique was not good enough to realize them. = In relation to other art exhibitions in Nordic countries and in France = Ernest Josephson Frits Thaulow Art life in Nordic countries was changing in the late 19th century. Old traditions were questioned and new art exhibitions were founded. Swedish artists, including Carl Larsson and Ernst Josephson, had founded an artists' society named Konstn√§rsf√∂rbundet in 1886. The society protested against the Swedish art life and education, both of which were thought to be stagnant. The Royal Swedish Academy of Arts arranged exhibitions sporadically, but Konstn√§rsf√∂rbundet held an annual exhibition from the year 1886 onwards. In 1882 in Norway, artists, including Frits Thaulow and Christian Krohg, established The Autumn Exhibition as an objection to Cristiania's Art Society, which was viewed as bourgeois. Anyone could nominate their artwork to the exhibition, but there was a jury deciding whose pieces would be put on display. In Denmark, Den Frie Udstilling was founded in 1891 by young Danish artists. The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts was considered too conservative at the time and the artists wanted to create an alternative for their juried exhibitions. Den Frie Udstilling continues to arrange exhibitions that are free to all artists today. It could be argued that Den Frie Udstilling in Denmark and the Salon de la Rose + Croix in France influenced Wettenhovi-Aspa when he was living in Copenhagen and Paris. He might have wanted to bring something similar to the Finnish art world to what he had seen in Europe. The name Free Exhibition, Fria Utst√§llningen, is the first obvious indicator that the Danish exhibitions might have been the model for the Finnish Free Exhibitions. Another indicator is the fact that Wettenhovi-Aspa was living in Denmark when Den Frie Udstilling was founded in 1891 and also took his Free Exhibition to Copenhagen in 1901. Additionally, Salon des Ind√©pendants was a juryless exhibition, and in that regard, the similarities between it and the Free Exhibitions can be seen. As mentioned previously, Wettenhovi-Aspa took part in the Salon de la Rose + Croix. Jos√©phin P√©ladan The founder of the salon, Jos√©phin P√©ladan, was a peculiar character in late 19th century Paris who might have influenced the young Wettenhovi-Aspa. Similarities between P√©ladan and Wettenhovi-Aspa are found upon examination of their public personas. They both organized exhibitions that had grandiose openings with musical performances. In addition, Wettenhovi-Aspa arranged a game of tombola as part of the second Free Exhibition's opening. Also, they were both ridiculed and criticized for organizing their exhibitions. The purpose of Free Exhibitions was said to be giving young artists an opportunity to get their art on view without the restrictions of a jury. An alternative motive for organizing Free Exhibitions might have been Wettenhovi-Aspa's wish to gain more visibility for his own art. One plausible explanation for the Free Exhibitions running their course might be that they were at first interesting to the public, but as a result of their artistic value being weak, the public lost their interest and its attitude became even derisive. Furthermore, the Free Exhibitions in Finland were perhaps identified too much with one person and because of this were a fleeting phenomenon in the Finnish art history.

Devices based on this method are called bio-radars. Theoretical basis This technology is based on the reflected signal modulation caused by movements of the human body and internal organs. While the examinee maintains a calm state (e.g. is sleeping or sitting in a fixed pose) modulation of bio-radar signal is caused mainly by respiratory movements (0.2-0.5 Hz) and heart and superficial arteries pulsations (0.5‚Äì20 Hz). The amplitude of thorax surface displacement caused by respiratory muscles contractions is about 1 cm, while the same parameter for heart beating is only 1 mm.

Applications The main advantage of bio-radiolocation is its remote and contactless nature. At present, commercially available bio-radars are aimed at the detection of people and at tracking them behind buildings or other obstacles (e.g. during antiterrorist operations). There are also bio-radars, used by rescuers for finding people under building debris.M. Pieraccini, G. Grazzini, D. Dei, C. Atzeni, GPR system to locate survivors of natural disasters // Proc.

He is from Huntington Beach, California. Musical career Scott's first successful band was Human Lab, who signed a deal in 2000 with Atlantic Records that was negotiated by Ian Montone (manager of Jack White). The band wrote and recorded a debut album with producers Michael Beinhorn and Mark \\"Spike\\" Stent in Henson studios, Los Angeles and Olympic studios, UK, but the album was never released. Searching for a more visceral, dangerous sound, and after leaving Atlantic Records in 2004 Scott Holiday started a new band with Thomas Flowers of Oleander and J. Harley Gilmore (Weylon Krieger, Blu Cantrell) called Black Summer Crush in 2005. Gilmore departed in early 2006, leaving Holiday/Flowers in search for a rhythm section. After a series of auditions Holiday was introduced to Michael Miley and knew he was the right fit. After trying several bassists, Miley suggested Robin Everhart, who eventually joined the band. BSC recorded together from 2006 to 2009. In 2008 the band released the song Lucky Girl that featured on 20th Century Fox' blockbuster movie Jumper with Hayden Christensen, Jamie Bell, Rachel Bilson and Samuel L. Jackson. The band also played Przystanek Woodstock and soon after signed a deal with EMI. Scott Holiday was then introduced to producer Dave Cobb who became a writing partner for the new album with help from Michael Miley and Robin Everhart. This was Scott Holiday's first experience of writing on the spot that became a trade-mark of Rival Sons' sound. Scott was keen to find a writing partner and singer that felt right and came across Jay Buchanan's music on MySpace. Michael Miley had previously played with him in his band Buchanan. Scott knew straight away that Jay was the singer he'd been looking for, and they met up and discussed old vinyl, and Jay agreed to give Rival Sons a try. Scott Holiday said: \\"He looked at me and said, 'Guess we're gonna do this band.' And so we did.\\" The band re-recorded 'Before the Fire' with Jay Buchanan on vocals in 2009. He sang 'On My Way' in one take and from then on the band was Rival Sons. The guitarist played as a guest on the Randy Bachman song Ton of Bricks, on his 2015 album Heavy Blues.

It consists of 17 cycles with 72,000 lines in iambic tetrameter or catalectic trochaic tetrameter. Each cycle pertains to a different self- contained story. The most notable of which deals with the exploits of the hero Bantugan. In 2002, the Darangen was declared a National Cultural Treasure of the Philippines by the National Museum and a Provincial Treasure by the Lanao del Sur provincial government. The Darangen epic was also proclaimed as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2005 by UNESCO (inscribed in 2008). It is the longest surviving epic poetry in the Philippines. Darangen is meant to be narrated by singing or chanting. Select parts of it are performed by male and female singers during weddings and celebrations (traditionally at night time), usually accompanied by music from kulintang gong ensembles, tambor drums, and kudyapi stringed instruments. It is also traditionally accompanied by several dances, each interpreting specific episodes of the epic. Depending on the part being performed, the performance can last a few hours to a week. The epic also incorporates Maranao customary laws, social values, and practices prior to the Maranao conversion to Islam in the 14th century. Etymology The term Darangen literally means \\"that which is narrated by song or chant\\" in the Maranao language, from the verb darang (\\"to narrate in the form of songs or chants\\"). Provenance The Darangen was originally a purely oral tradition. Its importance was first recognized by Frank Charles Laubach, an American missionary and teacher then living in the Lanao Province. He first encountered it in February 1930 on a return trip to Lanao by boat after he had attended the Manila Carnival. He was accompanied by 35 Maranao leaders, two of them sang darangen (epics) of Bantugan for the two-day journey. After hearing parts of the Darangen, Laubach was so impressed by the \\"sustained beauty and dignity\\" of the songs that he immediately contacted Maranao people who could recite various parts of it. He transcribed them phonetically by typewriter. His best source was the nobleman Panggaga Mohammad, who also helped Laubach transcribe the epics. Laubach described Mohammad as a man who \\"knew more Maranao songs than any other living man.\\" Laubach published part of the Darangen in November 1930 in the journal Philippine Public Schools. This was the first time the oral epics have ever been recorded in print, and it was also the first instance of the Maranao language being published in the Latin script. Laubach's version, however, was incomplete. A more complete version was later compiled by modern scholars from the Folklore Division of the Mindanao State University Research Center (now the Mamitua Saber Research Center) under the sponsorship of the Toyota Foundation. They collected, transcribed, and translated various parts and versions of the Darangen from Maranao elders and from kirim (handwritten Maranao songbooks written in the Jawi alphabet) over a period of ten years. The entire epic was published from 1986 to 1988 in eight volumes, in both original Maranao and their English translations. Background The Darangen does not have a single author, but is rather a collection of tales passed down orally from generation to generation. It has 72,000 lines divided into 17 cycles (also called books or episodes) in iambic tetrameter or catalectic trochaic tetrameter. Each of the cycles can be treated as an independent story, but they are all connected sequentially. The epic is also recorded in the archaic Maranao language, which differs significantly from the modern colloquial version of Maranao. Darangen was memorized by their performers. Skilled chanters were known as onor. The epic were most commonly sung at night time, during weddings (kawing) and other celebrations. But it can also be used as a lullabye for children. A full performance of the entire epic usually takes about a week. In modern times, however, it is more common to only perform parts of the epic, which usually lasts for a few hours. The chanting or singing is commonly accompanied by dances and musical performances using traditional Maranao instruments like kulintang gong ensembles, tambor drums, and kudyapi stringed instruments. The Darangen originates from before the conversion of the Maranao people to Islam, and thus details the traditional pre-Islamic anito religions of the Maranao. The heroes in the epic worship and interact with various ancestor and guardian spirits (tonong) and nature spirits (diwata). An example is Batara-sa-Marudo,Compare with Bathala a nature spirit capable of bringing down floods and storms. Setting The Darangen features several locales, but the principal setting is the grand city of Bembaran (also spelled Bumbaran or Bembran),The town of Bumbaran (modern Amai Manabilang) of Lanao del Sur was named after the mythical Bembaran in 1977 the seat of the Kingdom of Bembaran, which was described as being near a great river. It supposedly does not exist anymore as it was enchanted and sank to the bottom of the sea. In the epic, Bembaran is described as being founded by Diwata Ndaw Gibon, the grandfather of Prince Bantugan. The epic also illuminates the inter-ethnic relationships of the Maranao people. They mention the Manobo, the mountain-dwellers, and the \\"Samar\\" (Sama-Bajau), the sea people, many times.

It means \\"To stand from the Darangen\\" and involves graceful movements of the fingers and hips with fans. *Sagayan - A war dance reenacting Prince Bantugan's preparation for battle. Also known as Kasagyan. *Singkil - A dance involving two pairs of clashing bamboos. The name of the dance derives from the ankle rings worn by the lead female dancer. It illustrates the abduction of Princess Gandingan and her rescue by Prince Bantugan. Also known as Kasingkil or Kasayaw sa Singkil. Modern adaptations The Bantugan cycle of the Darangen has been adapted into the ballet performance Darangen ni Bantugan by the Philippine Ballet Theatre. Conservation The conservation of the Darangen faces several challenges. Some modern Maranao Islamic religious leaders object to the non- Islamic themes of the Darangen. Some modern revisions have omitted mentions of the tonong and diwata entirely. Some older Darangen singers have refused to sing these versions as they are deemed inauthentic. The use of archaic Maranao in the Darangen also makes it less readily accessible to modern Maranao speakers, leading to decreasing interest among modern Maranao youth. Some versions are so old only the chanters can understand the words used. The number of people able to play instruments like the kulintang and kudyapi are also declining.

Aluminium diethyl phosphinate acts as a flame retardant in the condensed phase in contributing to charring of the polymer matrix and thus protecting the substrate against heat and oxygen attack. In parallel it acts in the gas phase by radical reactions removing from the combustion zone the high energy radicals H. and OH., which determine flame propagation and heat release.Braun, U.; Bahr, H.; Schartel, B.; Fire retardancy effect of aluminium phosphinate and melamine polyphosphate in glass fibre reinforced polyamide 6. e-Polymers.

Stab. 2007, 92, p. 1528-1545 Aluminium diethyl phosphinate is used as a halogen-free flame retardant for polyamides, polyesters, thermoset resins (e.g. epoxies) in electrical engineering and electronics (E&E;) applications for switches, plugs, PC fans, and structural and housing components. Smartphones, washing machines, and airplane parts, among others, contain the product. Other applications include thermosetting resins and adhesives as well as cable sheaths and insulation made from thermoplastic elastomers. Aluminium diethyl phosphinate can give these plastics flame retardant properties that are otherwise only achievable with expensive high-performance plastics, which are less easy to work with. Aluminium diethyl phosphinate is often used in combination with other halogen- free flame retardant additives like melamine polyphosphate or melamine cyanurate. In glass fibre reinforced (GF) polyamide 6 (Nylon 6) and 66 (Nylon 66) formulations as well as in polyesters like polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) and PET, aluminium diethyl phosphinate shows excellent performanceJimenez et al. New routes to flame retard polyamide 6,6 for electrical applications. J. Fire Sciences. Accepted 2012-05-08 in the UL 94 flammability tests UL 94. Tests for Flammability of Plastic Materials for Parts in Devices and Appliances. 2013-03-28 (UL 94 V0 specification is met down to 0.4 mm), as well as in the glow wire tests required for appliances. Here, formulations with aluminium diethyl phosphinate meet the glow wire ignition test (GWIT)Fire hazard testing - Part 2-13: Glowing/hot-wire based test methods - Glow-wire ignition temperature (GWIT) test method for materials (IEC 60695-2-13:2010) at 775 ¬∞C and the glow wire flammability test (GWFI)Fire hazard testing - Part 2-12: Glowing/hot-wire based test methods - Glow-wire flammability index (GWFI) test method for materials (IEC 60695-2-12:2010) at 960 ¬∞C. Another important criterion in E&E; applications is the Comparative Tracking Index (CTI),Comparative Tracking IndexMethod for the determination of the proof and the comparative tracking indices of solid insulating materials (IEC 60112:2003 + A1:2009) which determines the risk of electrical tracking of insulating material that is exposed to contaminating environments and surface conditions. With formulations containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate, the highest requirement of 600 V (numeric value of the highest voltage at which an electrical insulating material withstands 50 drops of electrolytic test solution) is achieved. Further benefits of polyamides and polyesters containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate are low smoke density which makes them suitable for rolling stock applications to EN 45545,EN 45545:2013. Railway applications - Fire protection on railway vehicles - Part 1: General, Part 2: Requirements for fire behaviour of materials and components as well as good light stability which is needed for outdoor applications. The EU‚Äôs RoHS directive forced E&E; manufacturers to switch to lead-free solder systems running at about 30 ¬∞C higher temperatures than traditional systems. In particular, in the so-called surface mount technology (SMT) used to connect semiconductor components mechanically and electrically to circuit boards, the resins have to withstand peak temperatures of 260 ¬∞C and more during the soldering process. This triggered the rapid growth of polymer resins based on polyamides with melting points above 300 ¬∞C, in particular PPAs and Nylon 46. The application requires the resin to pass GWIT and UL94 ratings mentioned above. Aluminium diethylphosphinate confers this flame retardancy on polyamides whilst meeting the other requirements such as CTI. A large variety of synergists is used to tune properties of polyamide and polyester compounds.  Human health and the environment  Human health and environmental facts of aluminium diethyl phosphinate are summarized in a fact sheet. Further data are given in the Arcadis Study carried out on behalf of the European Commission Health & Consumers DG, Contract number 17.020200/09/549040: ‚ÄúIdentification and evaluation of data on flame retardants in consumer products. Final Report‚Äù of 26 April 2011, Chapter 5.23, p. 168. Aluminium diethyl phosphinate has also been investigated in projects of the US EPA Design for Environment (DfE) programme and in the European FP7 research project Enfiro.Enfiro: Life cycle assessment of environment-compatible flame retardants (Sep 2009 to Nov 2012) http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/226563 With the exception of being persistent and thus not readily biodegradable, aluminium diethyl phosphinate has been shown to have a favourable environmental and health profile.

Joyland was \\"written in different places in the world while touring\\" as opposed to the first album which was primarily developed in Toronto. In Alfons' opinion that made a big difference, because the album was now influenced by the vast \\"energy from the live shows\\" and a boost of self-confidence. Alfons also states that this boost has led him to be \\"a bit more playful with many aspects of the record\\", especially his vocals. Composition Joyland is described as synth-pop, cold wave, dark wave, EBM and futurepop. The album's sound is \\"gallant, atmospheric, desirably ostentatious,\\" \\"often brave\\" and \\"lugubrious.\\" Joyland's beats and synths have been described as having a \\"hollow sheen.\\" Robert Alfons listed video game soundtracks, acid house and early techno music, Kate Bush, Elizabeth Fraser from the Cocteau Twins and Lee Hazlewood as influences for Joyland. The artist pointed out that on the album, he is \\"taking risks with vocals, and certain instrumentations, and sounds [he] hated in the past but now embrace[s].\\" Unlike TRST (2012), the album was produced, written and engineered solely by Alfons, whereas TR/ST's debut album was created in a collaboration with Maya Postepski.

The successor to the 1983 arcade game, Mario Bros., and the first in the Super Mario series of platformers, it was released in Japan in 1985 for the Famicom, and in North America and Europe for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985 and 1987 respectively. Players control Mario, or his brother Luigi in the multiplayer mode, as they travel the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Toadstool from Bowser (King Koopa). They must traverse side-scrolling stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and pits with the aid of power-ups such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Starman. The game was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka as \\"a grand culmination\\" of the Famicom team's three years of game mechanics and programming. The design of the first level, World 1-1, serves as a tutorial for first-time video gamers on the basic mechanics of platform gameplay. The aggressively size-optimized profile was intended as a farewell to the Famicom's cartridge medium in favor of the forthcoming Famicom Disk System, whose floppy disks temporarily became the dominant distribution medium for a few years. Super Mario Bros. is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time, with praise on its precise controls. It is one of the bestselling games of all time, with more than 40 million physical copies. It is credited alongside the NES as one of the key factors in reviving the video game industry after the 1983 crash, and helped popularize the side-scrolling platform game genre. Koji Kondo's soundtrack is one of the earliest and most popular in video games, making music into a centerpiece of game design. The game began a multimedia franchise including a long-running game series, an animated television series, and a feature film. It has been rereleased on most Nintendo systems. Alongside Mario himself, Super Mario Bros. has become prominent in popular culture.  Gameplay  Super Mario Bros. features various unique power-ups which assist Mario. In the above picture, Mario wields a alt=Refer to caption In Super Mario Bros., the player takes on the role of Mario, the protagonist of the series. Mario's younger brother, Luigi, is controlled by the second player in the game's multiplayer mode and assumes the same plot role and functionality as Mario. The objective is to race through the Mushroom Kingdom, survive the main antagonist Bowser's forces, and save Princess Toadstool. The game is a side-scrolling platformer; the player moves from the left side of the screen to the right side in order to reach the flag pole at the end of each level. The game world features coins scattered around for Mario to collect and special bricks marked with a question mark (?), which when hit from below by Mario may reveal more coins or a special item. Other \\"secret\\", often invisible, bricks may contain more coins or rare items. If the player gains a Super Mushroom, Mario grows to double his size and gains the ability to break bricks above him. If Mario gets hit in this mode, then instead of dying he turns back to regular Mario. Players start with a certain number of lives and may gain additional lives by picking up green spotted orange 1-up mushrooms hidden in bricks, or by collecting 100 coins, defeating several enemies in a row with a Koopa shell, or bouncing on enemies successively without touching the ground. Mario loses a life if he takes damage while small, falls in a bottomless pit, or runs out of time. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although a button input can be used on the game over screen to continue from the first level of the world in which the player died. Mario's primary attack is jumping on top of enemies, though many enemies have differing responses to this. For example, a Goomba will flatten and be defeated, while a Koopa Troopa will temporarily retract into its shell, allowing Mario to use it as a projectile. These shells may be deflected off a wall to destroy other enemies, though they can also bounce back against Mario, which will hurt or kill him. Other enemies, such as underwater foes and enemies with spiked tops, cannot be jumped on and damage the player instead. Mario can also defeat enemies above him by jumping to hit the brick that the enemy is standing on. Mario may also acquire the Fire Flower from certain \\"?\\" blocks that when picked up changes the color of Super Mario's outfit and allows him to throw fireballs. However, certain enemies such as Buzzy Beetles are immune to fireballs. A less common item is the Starman, which often appears when Mario hits certain concealed or otherwise invisible blocks. This item makes Mario temporarily invincible to most hazards and capable of defeating enemies on contact. The game consists of eight worlds with four sub-levels called \\"stages\\" in each world.\\" The final stage of each world takes place in a castle where Bowser is fought above a suspension bridge; the first seven of these Bowsers are \\"false Bowsers\\" whom are actually minions disguised as him, whilst the real Bowser is found in the 8th world. Bowser and his decoys are defeated by jumping over them and reaching the axe on the end of the bridge, although they can also be defeated using a Fire Flower. The game also includes some stages taking place underwater, which contain different enemies. In addition, there are bonuses and secret areas in the game. Most secret areas contain more coins for Mario to collect, but some contain \\"warp pipes\\" that allow Mario to advance directly to later worlds in the game without completing the intervening stages. After completing the game once, the player is rewarded with the ability to replay the game with changes made to increase its difficulty, such as all Goombas in the game being replaced with Buzzy Beetles. Synopsis In the fantasy setting of the Mushroom Kingdom, a tribe of turtle-like creatures known as the Koopa Troopas invade the kingdom and uses the magic of its king, Bowser, to turn its inhabitants, known as the Mushroom People, into inanimate objects such as bricks, stones and horsehair plants. Bowser and his army also kidnap Princess Toadstool, the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom and the only one with the ability to reverse Bowser's spell. After hearing the news, Mario sets out to save the princess and free the kingdom from Bowser. After traveling through various parts of the kingdom and fighting Bowser's forces along the way, Mario reaches Bowser's final stronghold, where he is able to defeat him by striking an axe on the bridge suspended over lava he is standing on, breaking the bridge, defeating Bowser, and allowing for the princess to be freed and saving the Mushroom Kingdom.  Development  Designers Takashi Tezuka (left) and Shigeru Miyamoto (center) and composer K≈çji Kond≈ç (right) in 2015 Super Mario Bros. was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka of the Nintendo Creative Department, and largely programmed by Toshihiko Nakago of SRD Company, Ltd. The original Mario Bros., released in 1983, is an arcade game that takes place on a single screen with a black background. For Super Mario Bros., Miyamoto wanted to create a more colorful game with a scrolling screen and larger characters. Development was a culmination of their technical knowledge from working on games such as Excitebike, Devil World, and Kung Fu and their desire to develop the platformer genre they had created with earlier games. Miyamoto also wanted to create a game that would be the \\"final exclamation point\\" for the ROM cartridge format before the forthcoming Famicom Disk System was released. Super Mario Bros. was made in tandem with The Legend of Zelda, another Famicom game directed and designed by Miyamoto and released in Japan five months later, and the games shared some elements; for instance, the fire bars that appear in the Mario castle levels began as objects in Zelda. To have a new game available for the end-of-year shopping season, Nintendo aimed for simplicity. They started with a prototype in which the player moved a 16x32-pixel square around a single screen. Tezuka suggested using Mario after seeing the sales figures of Mario Bros. The team chose the name Super Mario Bros. after implementing the Super Mushroom power-up. The game initially used a concept in which Mario or Luigi could fly a rocket ship while firing at enemies, but this went unused; the final game's sky-based bonus stages are a remnant of this concept. The team felt it was illogical that Mario was hurt by stomping on turtles in Mario Bros. so decided that future Mario games would \\"definitely have it so that you could jump on turtles all you want\\". Miyamoto initially imagined Bowser as an ox, inspired by the Ox King from the Toei Animation film Alakazam the Great (1960). However, Tezuka felt he looked more like a turtle, and they collaborated to create his final design.2009-08-11 The development of Super Mario Bros. is an early example of specialization in the video game industry, made possible and necessary by the Famicom's arcade- capable hardware. Miyamoto designed the game world and led a team of seven programmers and artists who turned his ideas into code, sprites, music, and sound effects. Developers of previous hit games joined the team, importing many special programming techniques, features, and design refinements such as these: \\"Donkey Kongs slopes, lifts, conveyor belts, and ladders; Donkey Kong Jr.s ropes, logs and springs; and Mario Bros.s enemy attacks, enemy movement, frozen platforms and POW Blocks\\". The team based the level design around a small Mario, intending to later make his size bigger in the final version, but decided it would be fun to let Mario change his size via a power-up. The early level design was focused on teaching players that mushrooms were distinct from Goombas and would be beneficial to them, so in the first level of the game, the first mushroom is difficult to avoid if it is released. The use of mushrooms to change size was influenced by Japanese folktales in which people wander into forests and eat magical mushrooms; this also resulted in the game world being named the \\"Mushroom Kingdom\\". The team had Mario begin levels as small Mario to make obtaining a mushroom more gratifying. Miyamoto explained: \\"When we made the prototype of the big Mario, we did not feel he was big enough. So, we came up with the idea of showing the smaller Mario first, who could be made bigger later in the game; then players could see and feel that he was bigger.\\" Miyamoto denied rumors that developers implemented a small Mario after a bug caused only his upper half to appear. Miyamoto said the shell-kicking 1-up trick was carefully tested, but \\"people turned out to be a lot better at pulling the trick off for ages on end than we thought\\". Other features, such as blocks containing multiple coins, were inspired by programming glitches. Super Mario Bros. was developed for a cartridge with 256 kilobits of program code and data and 64 kilobits of sprite and background graphics. Due to this storage limitation, the designers happily considered their aggressive search for space-saving opportunities to be akin to their own fun television game show competition. For instance, clouds and bushes in the game's backgrounds use that same sprite recolored, and background tiles are generated via an automatic algorithm. Sound effects were also recycled; the sound when Mario is damaged is the same as when he enters a pipe, and Mario jumping on an enemy is the same sound as each stroke when swimming. After completing the game, the development team decided that they should introduce players with a simple, easy-to-defeat enemy rather than beginning the game with Koopa Troopas. By this point, the project had nearly run out of memory, so the designers created the Goombas by making a single static image and flipping it back and forth to save space while creating a convincing character animation. After the addition of the game's music, around 20 bytes of open cartridge space remained. Miyamoto used this remaining space to add a sprite of a crown into the game, which would appear in the player's life counter as a reward for obtaining at least 10 lives. = World 1-1 = During the third generation of video game consoles, tutorials on gameplay were rare. Instead, players learned how a video game worked through being guided by level design. The opening section of Super Mario Bros. was therefore specifically designed in such a way that players would be forced to explore the mechanics of the game in order to be able to advance. Rather than confront the newly oriented player with obstacles, the first level of Super Mario Bros. lays down the variety of in-game hazards by means of repetition, iteration, and escalation. In an interview with Eurogamer, Miyamoto explained that he created \\"World 1-1\\" to contain everything a player needs to \\"gradually and naturally understand what they're doing\\", so that they can quickly understand how the game works. According to Miyamoto, once the player understands the mechanics of the game, the player will be able to play more freely and it becomes \\"their game.\\" = Music = Nintendo sound designer Koji Kondo wrote the six-track score for Super Mario Bros., as well as all of the game's sound effects. At the time he was composing, video game music was mostly meant to attract attention, not necessarily to enhance or conform to the game. Kondo's work on Super Mario Bros. was one of the major forces in the shift towards music becoming an integral and participatory part of video games. Kondo had two specific goals for his music: \\"to convey an unambiguous sonic image of the game world\\", and \\"to enhance the emotional and physical experience of the gamer\\". The music of Super Mario Bros. is coordinated with the onscreen animations of the various sprites, which was one way which Kondo created a sense of greater immersion. Kondo wasn't the first to do this in a video game; for instance, Space Invaders features a simple song that gets faster and faster as the aliens speed up, eliciting a sense of stress and impending doom which matches the increasing challenge of the game. (Order No. MR84768). Unlike most games at the time, for which composers were hired later in the process to add music to a nearly finished game, Kondo was a part of the development team almost from the beginning of production, working in tandem with the rest of the team to create the game's soundtrack. Kondo's compositions were largely influenced by the game's gameplay, intending for it to \\"heighten the feeling\\" of how the game controls. Before composition began, a prototype of the game was presented to Kondo so that he could get an idea of Mario's general environment and revolve the music around it. Kondo wrote the score with the help of a small piano to create appropriate melodies to fit the game's environments. After the development of the game showed progress, Kondo began to feel that his music did not quite fit the pace of the game, so he changed it a bit by increasing the songs' tempos. The music was further adjusted based on the expectations of Nintendo's playtesters. Release Super Mario Bros. was first released in Japan on September 13, 1985, for the Family Computer. It was released later that year in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Its exact North American release date is unknown and is frequently debated; though generally being cited as having been released alongside the NES in October 1985 as a launch game, several other sources conflict with this statement, suggesting that the game may have released in other varying time frames ranging from November 1985 to early 1986. The game was released in Europe two years later on May 15, 1987 for the NES. In 1988, the game was re-released along with the shooting range game Duck Hunt as part of a single ROM cartridge, which came packaged with the NES as a pack-in game, as part of the console's Action Set. This version of the game is extremely common in North America, with millions of copies of it having been manufactured and sold in the United States. In 1990, another cartridge, touting the two games as well as World Class Track Meet, was also released in North America as part of the NES Power Set. It was released on May 15, 1987 in Europe, and during that year in Australia as well. In 1988, the game was re-released in Europe in a cartridge containing the game plus Tetris and Nintendo World Cup. The compilation was sold alone or bundled with the revised version of the NES. =Re-releases= Super Mario Bros. has been ported several times since its release. On February 21, 1986, a port of the game was released there for the Famicom Disk System, Nintendo's proprietary floppy disk drive for the Family Computer. Super Mario Bros. Special A version of the game titled Super Mario Bros. Special developed by Hudson Soft was released in Japan in 1986 for the NEC PC-8801 and Sharp X1 personal computers. Though featuring similar controls and graphics, the game has different level designs and new items, as well as brand new enemies based on enemies from Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong. Game & Watch A handheld LCD game under the same name was released as a part of Nintendo's Game & Watch line of LCD games. =Vs. Super Mario Bros.= Vs. Super Mario Bros. is a 1986 arcade adaptation of Super Mario Bros (1985), released on the Nintendo VS. System and the Nintendo Vs. Unisystem (and its variant, Nintendo Vs. Dualsystem). Existing levels were made much more difficult, with narrower platforms, more dangerous enemies, fewer hidden power-ups, and 200 coins needed for an extra life instead of 100. Several of the new levels went on to be featured in the Japanese sequel, Super Mario Bros 2. The game was featured in an official contest during the 1986 ACME convention in Chicago. Although the game was not officially released in Japan, Japanese arcade operators were able to get access to the title. An emulated version of the game was released for the Nintendo Switch via the Arcade Archives collection on December 22, 2017. Playing that release, Chris Kohler of Kotaku called the game's intense difficulty \\"The meanest trick Nintendo ever played\\". =Modified versions= Several modified variants of the game have been released, many of which are ROM hacks of the original NES game. a promotional, graphically-modified version of Super Mario Bros., was officially released in Japan in December 1986 for the Famicom Disk System as a promotional item given away by the popular Japanese radio show All Night Nippon. The game was published by Fuji TV, the same company which later went on to publish Yume K≈çj≈ç: Doki Doki Panic (which was released outside of Japan as Super Mario Bros. 2). The game features graphics based upon the show, with sprites of the enemies, mushroom retainers, and other characters being changed to look like famous Japanese music idols, recording artists, and DJs as well as other people related to All-Night Nippon. The game also makes use of the same slightly upgraded graphics and alternate physics featured in Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels. This version of the game is considered extremely rare, with copies going online for upwards of nearly $500. On November 11, 2010, a special red variant of the Wii containing a pre-downloaded version of the game was released in Japan to celebrate Super Mario Bros.'s 25th anniversary. This version of the game features several graphical changes, such as changing \\"?\\" blocks to have the number \\"25\\" on them to symbolize the game's anniversary. Super Luigi Bros., a redux of the game featuring Luigi, was included as a feature within NES Remix 2, based on a mission featured in the first NES Remix featuring Luigi in a backwards version of World 1‚Äì2. The player now controls Luigi instead of Mario, who now jumps higher and slides more when running on the ground similar to his appearance in the Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 (if the game's two-player mode is selected, both players control as Luigi), and the game's level designs are exactly the same as they are in the original Super Mario Bros but completely mirrored, such as the game scrolling from left-to-right. =Remakes= Super Mario All-Stars Super Mario All- Stars, a compilation game released in 1993 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, featured a remade version of Super Mario Bros. alongside remakes of several of the other Super Mario games released for the NES. The version of Super Mario Bros. included in this compilation has improved graphics and sound to match the SNES's 16-bit capabilities, as well as minor alterations to some of the game's collision mechanics. The game also features the ability for a player to save their progress midway through the game and changes the game's multiplayer mode so that the two players switch off after every level in addition to whenever a player dies. Super Mario All-Stars was also re-released for the Wii as a re-packaged, 25th anniversary version, featuring the same version of the game, along with a 32-page art book and a compilation CD of music from various Super Mario games. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe sometimes referred to as Super Mario Bros. DX, was released on the Game Boy Color on May 10, 1999 in North America and Europe and in 2000 in Japan. Based on the original Super Mario Bros., it features an overworld level map, simultaneous multiplayer, a Challenge mode in which the player finds hidden objects and achieves a certain score in addition to normally completing the level, and eight additional worlds based on the main worlds of the Japanese 1986 game Super Mario Bros. 2. It is compatible with the Game Boy Printer. Compared to Super Mario Bros., the game features a few minor visual upgrades such as water and lava now being animated rather than static, and a smaller screen due to the lower resolution of the Game Boy Color. It was released on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2014. In Japan, users who registered a Nintendo Network ID on their Nintendo 3DS system between December 10, 2013 and January 10, 2014 received a free download code, with emails with download codes being sent out starting January 27, 2014. In Europe and Australia, users who registered a Nintendo Network ID on their Nintendo 3DS system between December 10, 2013 and January 31, 2014 received a free download code, with emails with download codes being sent out from February 13 to 28, 2014. It was released for purchase on the Nintendo 3DS eShop in Europe on February 27, 2014, in Australia on February 28, 2014, and in North America on December 25, 2014. GamesRadar+ placed the game number 15 of the greatest Game Boy games of all time explaining that they could have simply ported the game but instead they expanded on it. The staff opined the only downside was the camera in the game. Jeremy Parish of USGamer praised the game comparing it more popularly to Super Mario All-Stars which basically just gave a lift of Mario from 8-bit to 16-bit. Instead he praised Super Mario Bros. DX for adding \\"considerably more\\" to the original games like the secret unlockable bonus, the addition of The Lost Levels, new objectives, modes and multiplayer mechanics along with the ability to play with Luigi physics. He described it as \\"a comprehensive overhaul\\" of the whole Super Mario Bros. video game. Additionally Kevin Webb of Game Informer placed the game as one of greatest Game Boy games of all time. Meanwhile, the Esquire staff ranked it as the 9th greatest Game Boy game. =Emulation= As one of Nintendo's most popular games, Super Mario Bros. has been re-released and remade numerous times, with every single major Nintendo console up to the Nintendo Switch sporting its own port or remake of the game with the exception of the Nintendo 64. In early 2003, Super Mario Bros. was ported to the Game Boy Advance as a part of the Famicom Minis collection in Japan and as a part of the NES Series in the US. This version of the game is entirely emulated, making it completely identical to the original game. According to the NPD Group (which tracks game sales in North America), this re-released version of Super Mario Bros. was the best- selling Game Boy Advance game from June 2004 to December 2004. In 2005, Nintendo re-released this port of the game as a part of the game's 20th Anniversary; this special edition of the game went on to sell approximately 876,000 units. The game is one of the 19 unlockable NES games included in the GameCube game Animal Crossing, for which it was distributed by Famitsu as a prize for owners of Dobutsu no Mori+; outside of this, the game can't be unlocked through in-game conventional means, and the only way to access it is through the use of a third-party cheat device such as a GameShark or Action Replay. Super Mario Bros. is featured as one of the 30 included games with the NES Classic Edition, a dedicated video game console containing several NES games. This version of the game allows for the use of suspension points to save in-game progress, and can be played in various different display styles, including its original 4:3 resolution, a \\"pixel-perfect\\" resolution and a style emulating the look of a cathode ray tube television.  Virtual Console  Super Mario Bros. has been re-released for several of Nintendo's game systems as a part of their Virtual Console line of classic video game releases. It was first released for the Wii on December 2, 2006 in Japan, December 25, 2006 in North America and January 5, 2007 in PAL regions. The release is a complete emulation of the original game, meaning that nothing is changed from its original NES release. This version of the game is also one of the \\"trial games\\" made available in the \\"Masterpieces\\" section in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, where it can be demoed for a limited amount of time. A Nintendo 3DS release of the game was initially distributed exclusively to members of Nintendo's 3DS Ambassador Program in September 2011. A general release of the game later came through in Japan on January 5, 2012, in North America on February 16, 2012 and in Europe on March 1, 2012. The game was released for the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan on June 5, 2013, followed by Europe on September 12, 2013 and North America on September 19, 2013.  Reception  Super Mario Bros. was immensely successful and helped popularize side- scrolling platform games. Altogether, excluding ports and rereleases, the original NES version of the game has sold 40.24 million copies, making it the bestselling video game in the Mario series and one of the bestselling video games of all time, with 29 million copies sold in North America. The game was the all-time bestselling game for over 20 years until its lifetime sales were ultimately surpassed by Wii Sports. The game's Wii Virtual Console release was also successful, becoming the #1 selling game out of the service's lineup of games by mid-2007. Computer Entertainer / Video Game Update magazine highly praised Super Mario Bros., writing that the game was worthy of \\"a spot in the hall of fame reserved for truly addictive action games\\", praising its \\"cute and comical\\" graphics and its lively music. It stated that the game was a must-have for the system, and considered its greatest strength to be its depth of play. Retrospective critical analysis of the game has been extremely positive, with many touting it as one of the best video games of all- time.Sources calling Super Mario Bros. one of the all-time best games include these:     Nintendo Power listed it as the fourth best Nintendo Entertainment System video game, describing it as the game that started the modern era of video games as well as \\"Shigeru Miyamoto's masterpiece\\". The game ranked first on Electronic Gaming Monthly \\"Greatest 200 Games of Their Time\\" list and was named in IGN top 100 games of all-time list twice, in 2005 and 2007. The All-Stars edition of the game was ranked 37th in Electronic Gaming Monthlys 1997 list of the \\"100 Best Games of All Time\\". Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. In 2009, Game Informer put Super Mario Bros. in second place on its list of \\"The Top 200 Games of All Time\\", behind The Legend of Zelda, saying that it \\"remains a monument to brilliant design and fun gameplay\\". The Game Informer staff also ranked it the second best in their 2001 list of the top 100 games ever made. In 2012, G4 ranked Super Mario Bros. first of the \\"Top 100 Video Games of All Time\\", citing its revolutionary gameplay as well as its role in helping recover the NA gaming industry from the Video Game Crash of 1983. In 2014, IGN ranked Super Mario Bros. as the best Nintendo game in their \\"Top 125 Nintendo Games of All Time\\" list, saying that \\"this is the most important Nintendo game ever made\\". In a poll held by IGN in 2005, the game was ranked number one in the website's list of the 100 greatest video games of all-time. In 2017, Polygon ranked the game #8 out of the core Super Mario games, crediting the game with \\"kick[ing] off this franchise's habit of being an exception to so many rules\\". In 2018, Business Insider included the game as number 2 in their list of the top 10 Super Mario games. Several critics have praised the game for its precise controls, which allow the player to control how high and far Mario or Luigi jumps, and how fast he runs. AllGame gave Super Mario Bros. a five-star rating, stating that \\"[T]he sense of excitement, wonder and ‚Äì most of all ‚Äì enjoyment felt upon first playing this masterpiece of videogame can't barely be put into words. And while its sequels have far surpassed it in terms of length, graphics, sound and other aspects, Super Mario Bros., like any classic ‚Äì whether of a cinematic or musical nature ‚Äì has withstood the test of time, continuing to be fun and playable\\" and that any gamer \\"needs to play this game at least once, if not simply for a history lesson\\". Reviewing the Virtual Console Release of the game, IGN called it \\"an absolute must for any gamer's Virtual Console collection.\\" Darren Calvert of Nintendo Life called the game's visuals \\"unavoidably outdated\\" compared to newer games, but mused that they were impressive at the time that the game was released. The Game Boy Advance port of Super Mario Bros. holds an aggregate score of 84 on Metacritic. Many critics compared the port to previous ports of the game such as Super Mario Deluxe and Super Mario All-Stars, noting its seeming lack of brand new content to separate it from the original version of the game. Jeremy Parish of 1up.com called the game \\"The most fun you'll ever have while being robbed blind,\\" ultimately giving the game a score of 80% and praising its larger-scaling screen compared to Deluxe while greatly criticizing its lack of new features. IGN Craig Harris labeled the game as a \\"must-have,\\" but also mused \\"just don't expect much more than the original NES game repackaged on a tiny GBA cart.\\" GameSpot gave the port a 6.8 out of 10, generally praising the gameplay but musing that the port's graphical and technical differences from the original version of the game \\"prevent this reissue from being as super as the original game.\\" The Game Boy Color port of the game also received wide critical appraisal; IGN Craig Harris gave Super Mario Bros. Deluxe a perfect score, praising it as a perfect translation of the NES game. He hoped that it would be the example for other NES games to follow when being ported to the Game Boy Color. GameSpot gave the game a 9.9, hailing it as the \\"killer app\\" for the Game Boy Color and praising the controls and the visuals (it was also the highest rated game in the series, later surpassed by Super Mario Galaxy 2 which holds a perfect 10). Both gave it their Editors' Choice Award. Allgame Colin Williamson praised the porting of the game as well as the extras, noting the only flaw of the game being that sometimes the camera goes with Mario as he jumps up. Nintendo World Report Jon Lindemann, in 2009, called it their \\"(Likely) 1999 NWR Handheld Game of the Year,\\" calling the quality of its porting and offerings undeniable. Nintendo Life gave it a perfect score, noting that it retains the qualities of the original game and the extras. St. Petersburg Times Robb Guido commented that in this form, Super Mario Bros. \\"never looked better.\\" The Lakeland Ledger Nick S. agreed, praising the visuals and the controls. In 2004, a Game Boy Advance port of Super Mario Bros. (part of the Classic NES Series) was released, which had none of the extras or unlockables available in Super Mario Bros. Deluxe. Of that version, IGN noted that the version did not \\"offer nearly as much as what was already given on the Game Boy Color\\" and gave it an 8.0 out of 10. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe ranked third in the best-selling handheld game charts in the U.S. between June 6 and 12, 1999 and sold over 2.8 million copies in the U.S. It was included on Singapore Airlines flights in 2006. Lindemann noted Deluxe as a notable handheld release in 1999.  Legacy  The success of Super Mario Bros. led to the development of many successors in the Super Mario series of video games, which in turn form the core of the greater Mario franchise. Two of these sequels, Super Mario Bros. 2 and Super Mario Bros. 3, were direct sequels to the game and were released for the NES, experiencing similar levels of commercial success. A different sequel, also titled Super Mario Bros. 2, was released for the Famicom Disk System in 1986 exclusively in Japan, and was later released elsewhere as a part of Super Mario All-Stars under the name Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels. The gameplay concepts and elements established in Super Mario Bros. are prevalent in nearly every Super Mario game. The series consists of over 15 entries; at least one Super Mario game has been released on nearly every Nintendo console to date. Super Mario 64 is widely considered one of the greatest games ever made, and is largely credited with revolutionizing the platforming genre of video games and its step from 2D to 3D. The series is one of the best-selling, with more than 310 million copies of games sold worldwide . In 2010, Nintendo released special red variants of the Wii and Nintendo DSi XL consoles in re-packaged, Mario-themed limited edition bundles as part of the 25th anniversary of the game's original release. To celebrate the series' 30th anniversary, Nintendo released Super Mario Maker, a game for the Wii U which allows players to create custom platforming stages using assets from Super Mario games and in the style of Super Mario Bros. along with other styles based around different games in the series. The game's success helped to push Mario as a worldwide cultural icon; in 1990, a study taken in North America suggested that more children in the United States were familiar with Mario than they were with Mickey Mouse, another popular media character. The game's musical score composed by Koji Kondo, particularly the game's \\"overworld\\" theme, has also become a prevalent aspect of popular culture, with the latter theme being featured in nearly every single Super Mario game. Alongside the NES platform, Super Mario Bros. is often credited for having resurrected the video game industry after the market crash of 1983. In the United States Supreme Court case Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association, the Electronic Frontier Foundation submitted an amicus brief which supported the overturn a law which would ban violent video games in the state of California. The brief cited social research that declared Super Mario Bros, among several others, to contain cartoon violence similar to that found in children's programs such as Mighty Mouse and Road Runner that garnered little negative reaction from the public. Because of its status within the video game industry as well as one of the first titles published by Nintendo, mint condition copies of Super Mario Bros. have been considered collectors items. In 2019, the auction of a near-mint, sealed box version of the game sold for just over , and which is considered to have drawn wider interest in the field of video game collecting. A year later in July 2020, a similar near-mint sealed box copy of the game, from the period when Nintendo was transitioning from sticker-seals to shrinkwrap, went for , at the time the highest price ever for a single video game. The Super Mario Bros. series has inspired various media products. The 1986 anime film Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach! is acknowledged as one of the first feature-length films to be based directly off of a video game. A live-action film based on the game was released theatrically in 1993, starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo as Mario and Luigi, respectively. The American animated television series The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! ran from 1989 to 1990, starring professional wrestler Lou Albano as Mario and Danny Wells as Luigi. An animated film based on the series created by Illumination Entertainment is currently in production. Video game developer Yuji Naka has cited Super Mario Bros. as a large inspiration towards the concept for the immensely successful 1991 Sega Genesis game, Sonic the Hedgehog; according to Naka, the general idea for the game first materialized when he was playing through game and trying to beat the game's first level as quickly as possible, and thought about the concept of a platformer based around moving as fast as possible. Super Mario Bros. has served as inspiration for several fangames. In 2009, developer SwingSwing released Tuper Tario Tros, a game which combines elements of Super Mario Bros. with Tetris. Super Mario Bros. Crossover, a PC fangame developed by Jay Pavlina and released in 2010 as a free browser-based game, is a full recreation of Super Mario Bros. that allows the player to alternatively control various other characters from Nintendo games, including Mega Man, Link from The Legend of Zelda, Samus from Metroid, and Simon Belmont from Castlevania. Mari0, released in December 2012, combines elements of the game with that of Portal (2007) by giving Mario a portal-making gun with which to teleport through the level, and Full Screen Mario (2013) adds a level editor. In 2015, game designer Josh Millard released Ennuigi, a metafictional fangame with commentary on the original game which relates to Luigi's inability to come to terms with the game's overall lack of narrative. Super Mario Bros. is substantial in speedrunning esports, with coverage beyond video gaming and a specific version for Guinness World Records. = Minus World = The \\"Minus World\\" or \\"World Negative One\\" is an unbeatable glitch level present in the original NES release. World 1-2 contains a hidden warp zone, with warp pipes that transport the player to worlds 2, 3, and 4, accessed by running over a wall near the exit. If the player is able to exploit a bug that allows Mario to pass through bricks, the player can enter the warp zone by passing through the wall and the pipe to World 2-1 and 4-1 may instead transport the player to an underwater stage labeled \\"World -1\\". This stage's map is identical to worlds 2-2 and 7‚Äì2, and upon entering the warp pipe at the end, the player is taken back to the start of the level, thus trapping the player in the level until all lives have been lost. Although the level name is shown as \\" -1\\" with a leading space on the heads-up display, it is actually World 36‚Äì1, with the tile for 36 being shown as a blank space. The Minus World bug in the Japanese Famicom Disk System version of the game behaves differently and creates multiple, completable stages. \\"World -1\\" is an underwater version of World 1‚Äì3 with an underwater level color palette and underwater level music, and contains sprites of Princess Toadstool, Bowser, and Hammer Bros. World -2 is an identical copy of World 7‚Äì3, and World -3 is a copy of World 4‚Äì4 with an underground level color palette and underground level music, and does not loop if the player takes the wrong path, contrary to the original World 4-4. After completing the level, Toad's usual message is displayed, but Toad himself is absent. After completing these levels, the game returns to the title screen as if completed, and is now replayable as if in a harder mode, since it's higher than world 8. There are hundreds of glitch levels beyond the Minus World (256 worlds are present including the 8 playable ones), which can be accessed in a multitude of ways, such as cheat codes or ROM hacking.

Measurement of surgical stress is used in anaesthesia, physiology and surgery. Analysis of the surgical stress response can be used for evaluation of surgical techniques and comparisons of different anaesthetic protocols. Moreover, they can be performed both in the intraoperative or postoperative period. If there is a choice between different techniques for a surgical procedure, one method to evaluate and compare the surgical techniques is to subject one group of patients to one technique, and the other group of patients to another technique, after which the surgical stress responses triggered by the procedures are compared. Absent any other difference, the technique with the least surgical stress response is considered the best for the patient. Similarly, a group of patients can be subjected to a surgical procedure where one anaesthetic protocol is used, and another group of patients are subjected to the same surgical procedure but with a different anaesthetic protocol. The anaesthetic protocol that yields the least stress response is considered the most suitable for that surgical procedure. It is generally considered or hypothesized that a more invasive surgery, with extensive tissue trauma and noxious stimuli, triggers a more significant stress response. However, duration of surgery may affect the stress response which therefore may make comparisons of procedures that differ in time difficult.  Methods  Examples of used parameters are blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, photoplethysmography and skin conductance. Essentially, physiologic parameters are measured in order to assess sympathetic tone as a surrogate measure of stress. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring can also be used. Examples of commonly used biomarkers are adrenaline, cortisol, interleukins, noradrenaline and vasopressin.  History  Loss of nitrogen (urea) was observed already in the 1930s in fracture patients by the Scottish physician David Cuthbertson. The reason for the patients' catabolic response was not understood at the time, but later attention was turned to the stress reaction caused by the surgery. The evolutionary background is believed to be that a wounded animal increases its chance of survival by using stored energy reserves. The stress reaction thus initiates a catabolic state by an increased release of catabolic hormones. Additionally immunosuppressive hormones are also released. In a surgery patient, the stress reaction is considered detrimental for wound healing. However, surgical stress reduced mortality from endotoxin shock. Today, development of new surgical techniques and anaesthetic protocols aim to minimise the surgical stress reaction.

Beginning with her 1991 pioneering essay 'U.S. Third World Feminism: The Theory and Method of Oppositional Consciousness in the Postmodern World' Sandoval emerged as a significant voice for women of color and decolonial feminism.Angela Y.

She has four sisters, Janet, Robin, Sandy and Julie.Sandoval, Methodology of the Oppressed, xvi Education Sandoval received a bachelor of arts and a bachelor of science from UC Santa Cruz. She became interested in feminism in 1971 when she enrolled in a course \\"Women in Literature\\". As a result of this course, she became involved in the Santa Cruz Women's Media Collective, a group that made television programming for a local public access channel. In 1978, Sandoval moved to New York to intern at ABC News, a position arranged for her by Barbara Walters. However, ultimately Sandoval decided to pursue a doctorate rather than documentary film career. In a 2005 interview, Sandoval explained her decision as motivated by a desire to make activism more effective. \\"I felt the activism was...frustrating; we were repeating the same practices over and over again. I really needed to think about what we were committing our lives to, to see if there was another way to make positive social change. That's when I applied to HistCon to learn from activist- theorists and philosophers, in those early stages.\\"de la Riva, Interview with Chela Sandoval, Spectator, 89. http://cinema.usc.edu/archivedassets/097/15705.pdf Her professors in the History of Consciousness program included Stephen Heath, Teresa de Lauretis, Vivian Sobchack and Janey Place.Osa Hidalgo de la Riva, Interview with Chela Sandoval, Spectator 26.1(Spring 2006):91 http://cinema.usc.edu/archivedassets/097/15705.pdf She has cited Hayden White, Donna Haraway, James Clifford and Teresa de Lauretis as her mentors at Santa Cruz.Sandoval, Methodology of the Oppressed, xv Although she initially intended to write a dissertation on women and video, Sandoval's reading led her to philosophy. Her dissertation developed her first major theoretical contribution, the idea of oppositional consciousness.Oppositional consciousness in the postmodern world: U.S. third world feminism, semiotics, and the methodology of the oppressed Thesis (Ph. D.)--University of California, Santa Cruz, 1993. http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/213868615 Even as a graduate student, Sandoval played an important role in US feminism. She wrote a report on behalf of the Third World Women's Alliance following a divisive splintering around the 1981 National Women's Studies Association conference's theme of women and racism. Theories Her most important work, Methodology of the Oppressed, developed fully her idea of a differential oppositional consciousness, a mode of \\"ideology-praxis\\" rooted in the experiences of US Third World that resists binary categories of identity in favor of a fluidity that moves between them. She credits Frederic Jameson with recognizing the idea of oppositional consciousness in her work and encouraging her to develop it,Sandoval, U.S. Third World Feminism, 18 fn1 although her work is both a critique of and extension of Jameson's own work. Sandoval's work has been widely influential within second wave feminism and her notion of oppositional consciousness is central to Donna Haraway's cyborg feminism. However the concept has been adopted by scholars working in many fields. In more recent years, Sandoval has joined her earlier interests in culture with her work on oppositional consciousness to focus on what she terms artivism, a neologism she developed with Guisella LaTorre to describe activist art.Clara Rom√°n-Odio \\"Transnational Feminism, Globalization, and the Politics of Representation: Chicana Visual Art\\" in Marta Sierra and Clara Rom√°n-Odio eds Transnational Borderlands in Women's Global Networks: The Making of Cultural Resistance, Palgrave Macmillan 2011, 25.

Description Tegenaria abchasica differs from all other known species in the genus Tegenaria by the presence of two dark spots on the upper surface of the cephalothorax at the junction of the head and thorax. There is also a characteristic pattern on the under surface of the cephalothorax, consisting of a paler central line with a pair of lighter spots on either side (sometimes more than one pair). T. abchasica is variable in size; one female had a carapace of about long and an abdomen of about the same length. The male is somewhat smaller, particularly the abdomen. The longest leg is the fourth, around long in total. The legs have yellow femora with four dark gray-green half rings, yellow patellae, darkened distally (away from the body); yellow tibiae with three half rings coloured as the femora; and brown metatarsi, also with three similar half rings. Males appear to live only a year, maturing in August and September and dying in the winter; females hibernate. Taxonomy Tegenaria abchasica was first described in 1941 by D.E. Charitonov. Initially only the male was known; the female was first described in 2008. Distribution and habitat Tegenaria abchasica is known from Krasnodar Krai in Russia and neighbouring Abkhazia in Georgia.

The station is located on Littlehampton harbour side on the eastern bank of the River Arun, a quarter mile from the harbour entrance and the pier. The current lifeboat house on Fisherman's Quay was built in 2002. The lifeboat station currently operates with two inshore lifeboats: a lifeboat, and a lifeboat, . The of lifeboat (in service 1971‚Äì2008) was developed by the RNLI working with the now defunct William Osborne boatyard in Littlehampton and took its name from the River Arun, upon which Littlehampton harbour is built. No Arun-class lifeboats have been stationed at Littlehampton. Osborne's built more than 100 traditional lifeboats over the years, and also worked on the prototype Tyne class, and fitted out the prototypes for the Severn and Trent class lifeboats.  History  The RNLI opened the first lifeboat station in the town in 1884.For Those In Peril ‚Äì The Lifeboat Service of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Station by Station. Author: Leach, Nicholas. Publisher: Silver Link Publishing Ltd, First Issue 1999. Work:Part 2, South Coast of England ‚Äì Eastbourne to Weston-super-Mare, Page 74, Littlehampton. It was built on the east bank of the River Arun, near what is now the Harbour Park amusement park. The station's first pulling lifeboat was manned by local sailors and fishermen using oars and sail. During the next 37 years of operation, the lifeboats were launched 26 times before this original station closed in 1921. = Station re- location = In 1903 the boathouse was moved close to the lighthouse. The station was closed in 1921 due to lack of qualified staff, and the placement of a new motor lifeboat further west at Selsey. = The re-opening as an inshore lifeboat station = The RNLI noted that given the increase in the use of pleasure craft and leisure activities, the area was seeing a change in the pattern of casualties along the West Sussex coast and in the Arun river estuary. More services had been required to rescue bathers washed out to sea, people on lilos, dinghies, and various small water craft and as a result, faster first response was needed. The station re-opened in 1967 as an inshore lifeboat station operating a D-class lifeboat housed in a garage on the east bank of the river Arun. The cost was defrayed by a BBC Blue Peter fundraising appeal.Strong to Save ‚Äì Dramatic first-hand accounts of the RNLI lifeboat rescues around the British Iles. Author: Kipling, Ray and Susannah.

The lifeboat was called and with this placement came an association with the children's programme that has carried on since. = 1979 ‚Äì = In 1979, the station was improved with the construction of a bespoke new boathouse located near Fishermen's Quay in the town, from which lifeboats could be launched quickly down a short ramp into the river Arun. In 2002, the station underwent a large re-development. The new building is still located on Fishermen's Quay, but is in a slightly different situation to fit in with the recent waterside changes in the area. The new station has been designed specifically as a two-boat station at a cost of ¬£550,000. The new station saw the arrival of a lifeboat, Blue Peter 1 (B-779), at a cost of ¬£100,000. Blue Peter 1 was replaced in 2016 by a boat, Rennee Sherman (B-891). A new D-class inshore lifeboat, D-631 Spirit of Juniper, was donated by the Campaign for Real Gin in 2004 at a cost of ¬£25,000, and served until 2014. She was replaced by D-769 Ray of Hope, a later version of the D-Class IB1, funded by a private donor at a cost of ¬£42,000. In recent years, the station has typically responded to around 70 incidents each year, peaking at 109 in 2011.  Visitors  The lifeboat station is open most days between 10am and 3pm (4pm in the summer) to casual visitors. Organised groups are also welcomed, often in partnership with the neighbouring Look and Sea educational centre, contact details on www.littlehamptonlifeboat.org.uk. Members of the education and visits team also visit many groups and associations to present at their meetings.

Work: Chapter 7, page 154, From Whitehall to White City ‚Äì Blue Peter book appeal, the programmes producers decided to aim the appeal at raising funds for the RNLI with a view to providing a lifeboat. The programme asked its viewers to send in paperback books. The response was so great that the RNLI's warehouse at Borehamwood was overwhelmed with the second hand books. The proceeds of the appeal raised enough money to buy four inshore lifeboats for the institution, of which one was sent to Littlehampton with the other three going to , and . The Blue Peter era at Littlehampton comes to an end in 2016, after 49 years. The original boat has been replaced three times, funded by subsequent Blue Peter appeals, each boat bearing the same name of Blue Peter 1.

It is one of the five Bindu Upanishads, attached to the Atharvaveda, and one of twenty Yoga Upanishads in the four Vedas.GM Patil (1978), Ishvara in Yoga philosophy, The Brahmavadin, Volume 13, Vivekananda Prakashan Kendra, pages 209‚Äì210 The text is notable for condemning \\"bookish learning\\" and emphasizing practice, as well as for presenting a six limbed Yoga system which match five stages of the eight stage Patanjali's Yogasutras and offering a unique, different sixth stage. The Am·πõitabindu is listed at number 20 in the serial order of the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads. The text sometimes appears under the title Brahmabindu Upanishad or Amritanada Upanishad, in some anthologies. It shares over 20 Vedanta-philosophy related verses with Amritanada Upanishad in compilations where these two texts are separated into independent Upanishads. Nomenclature Paul Deussen states that the title has two meanings, first being \\"the esoteric doctrine of a bindu (point) or nada (reverberation) of the word Om which signifies Brahman\\", while the second meaning is a drop which grants immortality. The discussion of Om by the text, states Deussen, suggests that the former meaning may be more appropriate. It is one of five Upanishads whose title has the suffix \\"bindu\\" meaning \\"drop\\", while ‚Äúamrita‚Äù represents nectar of immortality like ambrosia in Greek literature parlance, but here its real emphasis is on mind. Amritabindu Upanishad, also meaning \\"Immortal Point,\\" differentiates between vocal recitation of the Om syllable and its non-vocal practice. The different names of similar texts may be the result of a scribal error that persisted as the text spread across India. However, the number of verses vary between the manuscripts, ranging from twenty two verses in Ayyangar translation, and 38 in Deussen translation. The text, states Deussen, has also been referred to as Amritanada Upanishad by medieval Indian scholars such as Sayana of the Vijayanagara Empire. David Gordon White states that Bindu and Nada Upanishads were related, deriving their nomenclature from the symbol Om and its relation to meditation on the Brahman metaphysical reality, the Nada texts \\"all show some similarities to the bindu texts\\", and may have origins in the Tantric traditions.David Gordon White (2011), Yoga in Practice, Princeton University Press, , pages 107‚Äì110, 240 The text of Amritabindu Upanishad, states White, appears under the title of Brahmabindu Upanishad in some older anthology.David Gordon White (2011), Yoga in Practice, Princeton University Press, , pages 109‚Äì110 Chronology and anthology Mircea Eliade suggests that Amritabindu Upanishad was possibly composed in the same period as the didactic parts of the Mahabharata, the chief Sannyasa Upanishads and along with other early Yoga Upanishads: Brahmabindu (probably composed about the same time as Maitri Upanishad), Ksurika, Tejobindu, Brahmavidya, Nadabindu, Yogashikha, Dhyanabindu and Yogatattva Upanishad. Eliade's suggestion places these in the final centuries of BCE or early centuries of the CE. All these, adds Eliade, were likely composed earlier than the ten or eleven later Yoga Upanishads such as the Yoga-kundali, Varaha and Pashupatabrahma Upanishads.Mircea Eliade (1970), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, , pages 128‚Äì129 Paul Deussen states that this text may have preceded Patanjali's Yogasutras text, because it lists six instead of eight limbs for yoga, and both Maitri Upanishad in section 6.18 and Amritabindu place Dharana after Dhyana, a sequence that is reverse of what is found in the Yogasutras and all later Yoga texts of Hinduism. Both Maitri and Amritabindu, adds Deussen, include the concept of Tarka in their verses, which may be important to their relative dating. Gavin Flood dates the Amritabindu text, along with other Yoga Upanishads, to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period. This Upanishad is among those which have been differently attached to two Vedas, depending on the region where the manuscript was found. Deussen states it and all Bindu Upanishads are attached to the Atharvaveda, while Ayyangar states it attached to the Krishna Yajurveda.Alain Danielou (1991), Yoga: Mastering the Secrets of Matter and the Universe, Inner Traditions, , page 168 In Colebrooke's version of 52 Upanishads popular in north India, the text is listed at number 19 along with the other four Bindu Upanishads with similar theme. The Narayana anthology also includes this Upanishad at number 11 in Bibliothica Indica. In the collection of Upanishads under the title \\"Oupanekhat\\", put together by Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh in 1656, consisting of a Persian translation of 50 Upanishads and who prefaced it as the best book on religion, it is listed at number 26 and is named Ambart bandeh(also known as Amrtabindu or Brahmabindu). Structure The text opens with an introduction consisting of four verses, followed by four sections of which three discuss the practice, rules and rewards of yoga, followed by a discourse on life-force (Prana, breath). The text ends with a one verse summary. Like almost all other Yoga Upanishads, the text is composed in verse form. The Amritabindu Upanishad is part of a group of five Bindu Upanishads, all dedicated to Yoga. All five of Bindu Upanishads emphasize the practice of Yoga and Dhyana (meditation) with Om, to apprehend Atman (soul, self). Contents =Introduction= The text opens stating that it is the wise, who after reading the text books repeatedly, throw away the books and proceed to the practice of yoga with meditation on the silent, invisible Om, in their pursuit of the Brahman- knowledge (ultimate unchanging reality). This lack of interest and esteem in learning or study of the Vedas is found in other Bindu Upanishads, states Deussen, and may reflect ancient trend among Yogins. In the initial verses the Upanishad differentiates the mind under pure and impure states, and assigns its character as \\"bondage and liberation\\". Further enquiry into the crux of the matter reveals that Truth is realized within Vasudev, which is one's Self. =The practice of yoga= The Amritabindu Upanishad states that there are six limbs of yoga, whose sequence and one limb is different from Patanjali's Yogasutras: #Pratyahara: the withdrawal of mind and sensory organs from external objects, and redirecting them to introspection. (Verses 5‚Äì6) #Dhyanam: meditation. (Verses 5‚Äì6) #Pranayama: breathing exercises consisting of Rechaka (exhaling completely), Paraka (inhaling deeply) and Kumbhaka (retaining breath for various intervals). (Verses 7‚Äì14) #Dharana: concentrated introspection on Atman (soul, self) with one's mind. (Verse 15) #Tarka: reflecting and inner reasoning between one's mind and soul. This is missing in the Yogasutras. (Verse 16) #Samadhi: communion with and in one's soul. (Verse 16) The verse 10 of the Upanishad recommends internally reciting Gayatri, Vyahrtis and Pranava (Om) mantras as counters to time the length of the breathing exercises, while the section reminds the yogi to drink water and breath deeply to cleanse the body and senses. =The rules of yoga= The verse 17 of the text begins the rules and recommendation for yoga practice. It begins by stating that one must pick a proper place for yoga, which translates Deussen, is \\"a level surface of ground, pleasant and free from faults\\". Place a mat, settle in, and enter an Asana, states the Upanishad, such as Padmasana, Svastikasana or even Bhadrasana. The yogi should face north, perform breathing exercises, alternating with the two nostrils, then in the state of comfort and being pacific, say Om and begin meditating. Close and cast your eyes within, asserts the text in verse 22, sit motionless, practice yoga. Reach rhythmic breathing, concentrate, chain in the mind, reflect and reason, and proceed towards the union in the soul. It is unclear, states Deussen, whether the text implies union of individual soul with highest soul (Anquetil's interpretation), or Prana and Apana (Narayana's interpretation), or is a choice left to the yogi. The yogi should be silent, still, lost from the outer world, reflecting or remembering the sacred syllable (Om) internally. In verse 27, the Upanishad lists the Yamas (ethics of yogi with others) and Niyamas (ethics of yogi with one's own body). =The rewards of yoga= Three months of dedicated yoga practice, asserts verse 28 of the text, begins to bring rewards to body. In four months the yogi sees the Devas within, strength marks the yogi in five months, and after six months from starting yoga there is an \\"absoluteness of will\\" and sense of blissful aloneness, independence (Kaivalya) in the yogi states verse 29. The verses 30‚Äì31 describe how meditation and concentration on different moras of the Om syllable, the yogi thinks through soul and in soul alone. =Theory of Prana= In some versions of the manuscript found in India, this section is much larger or called as Amritabindu Upanishad while the yoga part is titled separately as Amritanada Upanishad. Many medieval Indian scholars considered these as one. Ayyangar has translated this as a separate Upanishad. The two Upanishads when separate, states White, share over 20 similar verses. This section, adds White, represent exclusively classical Vedanta philosophy methods and goals. To quote Swami Madhavananda ‚Äì \\"the Amritabindu Upanishad inculcates, first, the control of the mind in the shape of desire-less-ness for sense-objects, as the most effective way to the attainment of liberation and the realisation of the One who is Knowledge and Bliss Absolute. Then, it discusses the real nature of the soul and the realisation of the highest truth which leads to unity. Thus, the central theme of all the Upanishads ‚Äì viz., \\"that the Jiva and Brahman are eternally one, and that all duality is a mere superimposition due to ignorance\\" is described in this text. :‡§Æ‡§® ‡§è‡§µ ‡§Æ‡§®‡•Å‡§∑‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§£‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§£‡§Ç ‡§¨‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡§Æ‡•ã‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§Ø‡•ã‡§É  :‡§¨‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∏‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•É‡§§‡§Æ‡•ç ‡•® In the above verse, Amritabindu Upanishad states that the mind is the cause of bondage and liberation. A mind that craves for something else is in bondage, one that doesn't is liberated. Spirituality is geared to obtain inner purity, calmness of the mind, and ultimately, liberation. In the state of liberation the mental components like virtue and vice become irrelevant. This section of Amritabindu text presents the Vedanta theory of non-dualism (Advaita).H Zimmer (1969), Philosophies of India, Routledge, , page 370 with footnote 43; Quote: \\"Amritabindu Upanishad 17‚Äì18: Vijnana (the plenitude of knowledge): the vi here refers to infinity, which is all comprehensive and leaves no margin wherein any not included, second entity might exist. Vijnana is therefore nondual (advaita) knowledge (jnana), and as such synonymous with the state known to Vedanta as Turiya, the Fourth.\\" It states that \\"there is only one Self in all creatures, that one appears many just as the moon appears many when reflected in many droplets\\", and the toughest connection yet most liberating connection one can make is with one's own Self (soul), which is difficult because it is concealed by Maya. When one successfully removes this veil, look within, one realizes the Self and its unity with the eternal, indestructible, unchanging truth that is one with the universe.Eknath Easwaran (1987), The Upanishads, Nilgiri Press, , pages 179‚Äì180, Amritabindu Translation Archive =Conclusion= The text concludes with a single verse, asserting that one who has realized this knowledge is never reborn again, no matter where he dies.

Its main intent is to ensure a common safety level in machinery placed on the market or put in service in all member states and to ensure freedom of movement within the European Union by stating that \\"member states shall not prohibit, restrict or impede the placing on the market and/or putting into service in their territory of machinery which complies with [the] Directive\\".  European economic directives  Economic directives apply to products. They were taken under the new approach in order to facilitate the free movement of goods and products in the European Union by removing barriers to trade in the European market. The particularity of these guidelines is that they set the basic requirements or Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSR) that apply to all manufacturers who wish to put their products on the European market. If a product meets the essential health and safety requirements, then the product can be placed on the market. One way of demonstrating compliance with the ESHR can be done through compliance with harmonised European standards or any other solution that allows demonstrating a similar level of safety. Consequently, the Machinery Directive belongs to the economic legislation. It applies to products designed to be sold (or enabled) in the European Union for the first time. It addresses manufacturers, importers, and dealers of machinery and safety components and applies to new equipment. This directive harmonises the level of safety of products designed and manufactured by different manufacturers. Already installed machines lie outside the scope of this Directive, because they are already on the market. Resale of used machines is governed by national laws.  Scope  The directive applies to machinery as well as interchangeable equipment, safety components, lifting accessories, chains/ropes/webbing, removable mechanical transmission devices and partly completed machinery. Machinery that is covered by more specific directives is excluded from the scope. This includes * agricultural and forestry tractors * motor vehicles and their trailers * certain electric and electronic products such as household appliances or office equipment  First Publication  The first publication of the Machinery Directive took place in 1989 ‚Äì Directive 89/392/EEC of 14/06/89 published in OJ L 183 of 06.29.89 according to Article 100a of the Rome Treaty. The date of entry into force of this Directive was 1 January 1993, with a mandatory effective date of 1 January 1995. The following directives were subsequently introduced amending Directive 89/392/EEC. * Directive 91/368/EEC, which extended the scope of the Machinery Directive to interchangeable equipment, machinery moving and lifting machinery (excluding people). Therefore, Annex I has been expanded (adding / modifying parts 3, 4 and 5 of Annex I of the Directive). * Directive 93/44/EEC, which extended the scope of the Machinery Directive: ** safety components, ** Machinery intended for lifting, ** the movement of people. * Directive 93/68/EEC has introduced harmonised provisions relating to \\"CE\\" marking.  Second Publication  A second publication of the Machinery Directive took place in 1998 ‚Äì Directive 98/37/EC of 22 June 1998 on the harmonisation of the laws of all Member States relating to machinery. This directive is the codified version of Directive 89/392/EEC as amended by the directives listed above. Machine Directive 1998/37/EC This was amended by the following directive: * Directive 98/79/EC has been a minor amendment relating to the exclusion of medical devices. Machinery Directive 98/37/EC remained in force until 29 December 2009.  Third Publication  The third publication of the Machinery Directive took place in 2006 ‚Äì called new Directive 2006/42/EC, and was adopted in April and 9 June 2006, published in the Official Journal of the EU. The first recital of Directive 2006/42/EC notes that this \\"new Machinery Directive \\" is not entirely new, but is based on Directive 98/37/EC which itself has codified Directive \\"Machinery\\" 89/392/EEC amended by Directives 91/368/EEC, 93/44/EEC, 93/68/EEC and 98/79/EC. Requirements of the new Machinery Directive were transcribed into national law of each country of the European Union (transcript had to be made before 29 June 2008) so that this new machine Directive shall apply starting from 29 December 2009 and replaces Machinery Directive 98/37/EC. Requirements of this new machinery directive and associated European regulations concerns both manufacturers of machine and safety components, machinery distributors and users. The new Directive 2006/42/EC lays down the foundation and regulatory basis for the harmonisation of Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSR) in the field of machinery at the Community level. No transition period took place in 2009, because manufacturers had more than three years to anticipate these developments and be aware of new requirements. Changes in relation to the Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSR) of the previous directive, do not deeply change the Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSR).

It is also one of the most important works of architecture in Girona. Offering unparalleled views of the city, it is the only one of the famous houses on the Onyar River open to the public. The house has been preserved with the furniture and decoration in Noucentisme style.ARAG√ì, Narc√≠s-jordi, FALG√ÄS, Jordi i GIL, Rosa Maria. Casa Mas√≥: Noucentista Life and Architecture. Girona- Sant Llu√≠s, Foundation Rafael Mas√≥ - Triangle Postals. 2012 . The river facade, Girona Facade A cursory study of the facade reveals Mas√≥ House was the result of the merging of four separate dwellings acquired by the Mas√≥ Valent√≠ family between the mid-19th century and the early 20th century. Today's facade is the result of the renovation work carried out by Rafael Mas√≥ between 1911 and 1919, the same time he unified and updated the interior spaces. The most outstanding element is the bow window on the third floor. On the ground floor, the architect's father managed the Mas√≥ Press, where he edited and printed the Diario de Gerona de Avisos y Noticias newspaper between 1889 and 1936. The large first-floor balcony was a privileged vantage point for watching the festivals and parades on Ballesteries Street. Entrance In 1911-12, Mas√≥ renovated the main entrance to the house, with the intention of reinforcing the image and prestige of his family by forging links with old Girona tradition. To his end, he combined elements from history (heraldic coats of arms on the tiled wainscoting), religion ( St Narcissus bas-relief and St Paula panel), and the vernacular architecture (semi-circular arches, wrought iron, stonework, and glazed ceramics). Hall Hall and stairs inside Casa Mas√≥ The predominance of wood, and the cream and chocolate colors of the hall transmit a warm, welcoming feeling to the home. The repetition of vertical, elongated geometrical shapes (decorative frieze below the ceiling, wainscoting, and stairway woodwork), and the brightness coming from the skylight at the back enabled Mas√≥ to create a sense of large, orderly, sober space. An outstanding feature is the French clock dating from the mid-19th century. Dining room The dining room was the scene of all the family celebrations. In this room, Mas√≥ was best able to express the noucentista concept of the home as an austere but comfortable place, a harmonious whole with great attention to detail, of humble traditional appearance but filled with cultured references. Outstanding features include objects designed by the architect, in particular the hanging lamp, the stained glass, the sideboard, and the cabinet, as well as the Woman with bundle (ca 1906) figure by noucentista sculptor Enric Casanovas. Gallery and sewing room Gallery overlooking the river Due to the slight curve of the River Onyar at this point, the glassed-in galleries provide a unique perspective of the River Onyar and its bridges, as well as the other houses overlooking the river. These were spaces for sewing, mending, and embroidering the enormous amount of clothing and household linen belonging to the large Mas√≥ family. The architect himself designed monograms and other motifs for pillowcases, cushions, handkerchiefs, tablecloths, bedspreads and quilts, which were embroidered by his wife and his sisters. In the gallery, we can see several planters designed by Mas√≥ with a geometrical decoration very similar to that used by Charles Rennie Mackintosh and to the Gitterwerk conceived by Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser for the Wiener Werkst√§tte. Kitchen The kitchen and the spiral staircase leading to the service quarters on the third floor recall the other persons living in the house: the cook and the maids who worked for the Mas√≥ family. Day-to-day living and the numerous parties and traditions of the time depended on the constant presence of servants, who took care of the children, as well as looking after the meals, the daily chores, and all the other aspects of running a household. Library and office Santiago Mas√≥ (1878‚Äì1960), the eldest of the Mas√≥ Valent√≠ siblings, inherited the family house on the death of both parents. He became a Doctor of Law in 1903 and pursued a distinguished professional career as a lawyer and politician. The furniture for his legal office was designed by his brother Rafael in 1918. The Mas√≥ House library contains a rich and diverse sample of the family's literary, political, and professional interests, and now remains open to researchers. Living room The living room contains some fine pieces from the Mas√≥ House art collection. The architect's father, a solicitor, politician, and journalist, was also an amateur painter with a keen interest in contemporary Catalan painting. Outstanding works include paintings by Laureano Barrau, Modest Urgell, Joan Brull, Llu√≠s Graner, Baldomero Gili (1873-1926), and Iu Pascual, among others. Inner staircase and bedrooms Rafael Mas√≥ designed the furniture for the first-floor bedroom in 1924, upon the marriage of his brother, Joan. The geometric forms of the bed headboard, wardrobe, and dressing table show Mas√≥'s preference for austere refinement combined with traditional craftsmanship. To accommodate the large Mas√≥ Valent√≠ family, the house originally contained many more bedrooms on the second floor, now occupied by the offices and exhibition rooms of the Foundation. The inner staircase, with its pronounced geometrical and vertical design, is an example of Mas√≥'s adaptations of the English Arts & Crafts interiors. on the second- floor landing there are two drawings attributed to Goya, as well as others by Mari√† Salvador Maella, Eugenio Lucas and Vicente L√≥pez, among others. Bathroom Glass door and window The bathroom is a magnificent example of how Mas√≥ combined design with different materials in order to imprint character on his interiors. In this case, the texture and color of the ceramic tiles and mosaic floor, together with the stained glass door and window, lend notes of warmth, hygiene, and refinement to this most private of all places, hitherto the objects of scant attention in the decoration of middle-class dwellings. Facade overlooking the river As Mas√≥ was remodeling and uniting the interiors of the four houses acquired by his family, he also unified the rear of the houses into one large facade, the largest of all those overlooking the river. He painted the facade white to set it apart from the rest of the row of houses, and distinguished it with yellow-glazed ceramic tiles, thus adding notes of color to go with the wooden blinds, the blue window frames, and the greenery in the planters.ARAG√ì, Narc√≠s-Jordi Rafael Mas√≥, ciutad√† de Girona, Girona, 2006 The Fundaci√≥ Rafael Mas√≥ The Foundation is a non- profit-making body set up in 2006 after the cession of the Mas√≥ House to Girona City Council by the architect's nephew and his wife, the last owners of the building. It is supported by Rafael Mas√≥'s heirs, the City Council, the Architects' Association, the Quantity Surveyors' Association, and the University of Girona. As well as the conservation and the visitor management of Mas√≥ House, the Foundation also promotes research, conservation, and dissemination of Mas√≥'s works and of Catalan Noucentisme in general. It also organizes exhibitions, publications, and educational activities for all ages in order to build awareness of the importance of architecture and urban planning for people and the society in which they live.

One of a family of sculptors, he studied in Rome with the neo-classical sculptor Antonio Canova and is linked to him in style. Life Plaza Bol√≠var, Caracas by Adamo Tadolini Adamo was born in Bologna into a family of sculptors, descending from his grandfather Petronio Tadolini (1727‚Äì1813). From 1808 to 1813 he attended the Accademia di Belle Arti in Bologna under the directorship of Giacomo De Maria (1762‚Äì1838). In 1813 Adamo won a prize for sculpture awarded by the Accademia Curlandese, with a terracotta relief showing Venus and Aeneas carrying weapons. He won a four-year scholarship to Rome. During his scholarship he created a plaster statue of Ajax cursing the Gods. He came to the attention of the famed Antonio Canova and was invited to work in his studio. He worked there until 1822 when Canova helped him set up his own studio at Via Del Babuino 150 in Rome which now exists as the Canova-Tadolini Museum and is a treasury of his, and his family's, huge range of work. His sons Scipione Tadolini (1822‚Äì1892) and Tito Tadolini (1828‚Äì1910) worked with him and Scipione took ownership of the studio on Adamo's death.

From Melbourne, Padman was a graduate in electrical engineering from Monash University, Australia, and specialised in radio astronomy. After her doctoral research, she has made contributions to research in stellar evolution (the formation of stars). She is now mainly involved in administrative works in teaching. Padman is a member of the International Astronomical Union. A trans woman, Padman underwent sex reassignment surgery in 1982 when she was undertaking a PhD in astronomy at the University of Cambridge. In 1996, she was elected a Fellow of Newnham College, one of three all-women colleges in the University of Cambridge at the time. She received opposition from some people, who argued, unsuccessfully, that Padman should not be made a Fellow as she was assigned male at birth. Early life and education Padman was born Russell Padman, in Melbourne, in 1954, and attended Melbourne High School in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra. She was the school cadet captain and won the rifle-shooting prize for two consecutive years. She obtained a first degree in Electrical Engineering from Monash University in Australia. She joined research work on radio astronomy at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Division of Radio Physics in Sydney, for two years. In her autobiographical essay, \\"Rachael's Story\\", she discussed her lifelong gender identity as female, and one motive behind going to England was a hope for an opportunity to address her gender issues. In 1977 she went to England to work for PhD in astronomy at an all- male St John's College, Cambridge, and did research at the Cavendish Laboratory in University of Cambridge. Among the first things she did on arrival in Cambridge was to approach John Randall at Charing Cross Hospital in London, who prescribed oestrogen. In 1978, she came out as transgender, and started with her PhD supervisor, Richard Hills. She said Rachael spontaneously came up as her name one morning; she initially thought about using Susan from a pupil from her primary school, before renouncing because there were already two Susans in her laboratory, including the secretary. She received her degree in 1982. She immediately went to US at the University of California, Berkeley, as a Miller Research Fellow. After two years in 1984, she returned to the Cavendish. Career At the Cavendish Laboratory, Padman was appointed Deputy Project Scientist for the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii in 1984. She worked there for four years until she became a University Lecturer in the Department of Physics, University of Cambridge, in 1998. From 2005 she has been primarily involved in the administration of teaching in the Department of Physics. She is Director of Education in School of Physical Sciences. At Newnham she is both teaching physics and serves as Director of Studies in Natural Sciences. She was publicly outed in the press in 1996, when Padman was elected Fellow of Newnham College. The college statutes allowed only female members in the institute. The Principal Dr. Onora O'Neill knew that Padman had undergone a sex-change operation. Famed radical feminist Germaine Greer, who was a member of the college's governing body, strongly opposed the appointment, saying that Padman was a man and male. Fellows, students, and staff of Cambridge University supported Padman, and she was admitted without further opposition. Clare Longrigg published an article titled \\"A Sister with No Fellow Feeling\\" in the 25 June 1997 issue of The Guardian making charges on Padman and containing remarks attributed to Greer. The article was retracted on 19 March 1998 as information was found to be false, and the accusation made against Greer was considered groundless.

It was their first collaborative album and was recorded in Marseille, France in February 1992. The music was composed by Frith, with libretto by Pesenti, and was conducted by Frith and Jean-Marc Montera. Frith and Pesenti do not perform on this album. Background In 1990, English multi-instrumentalist, composer and improvisor Fred Frith spent six months in Marseille, France working with Que d'la Gueule, a group of young unemployed rock musicians. He composed Helter Skelter for them to perform, a rock opera for two sopranos, one contralto and a large electric ensemble. Their style of playing and abilities varied considerably, but Frith found that this was what contributed to the success of the project. He said, \\"Somehow all their personalities infected the kind of music we ended up making together.\\" To add to the mix, Frith also encouraged them to create and play homemade instruments. Helter Skelter was billed as an \\"operatic tragedy\\", and was first performed in December 1990 at Theatre Toursky in Marseille. Later the work was also performed in Zagreb, Hamburg, St. Brieuc and Paris. The opera was recorded in February 1992 by Christian No√™l at Studio Cactus in Marseille, and later mixed in July 1992 by Benedykt Grodon, Fred Frith and Jean-Marc Montera at Sound Fabrik in Munich using additional material taken from concert performances. Reception In his book Plunderphonics, 'pataphysics & pop mechanics: an introduction to musique actuelle, Andrew Jones said that Que d'la Gueule \\"show themselves to be a powerful ensemble bristling with talent and volatile contradictions\\", and that in Helter Skelter they \\"sketch a broad canvas of despair and hope, an urban maelstrom with moments of pure beauty peering through the shards of electroacoustic reality.\\" Jones added that \\"Listening to [the opera] is like a ride on a subway and a stroll through a bustling market while listening to music on a walkman: striated fragments upon fragments leak through, from Eastern European jigs and dances ‚Ä¶, samples of street life, radio broadcasts, plaintive chords arising from the horns, a soprano singer launching into Catalani's La Romance, all layered in an astonishing dense, chaotic mix and anchored by two airtight drummers.\\" Track listing Music by Fred Frith, lyrics by Fran√ßois-Michel Pesenti.

It consists of three 19th century farm buildings, including the c. 1847 Greek Revival farmhouse, a large c. 1888 shop and barn, and a 19th-century privy which has been converted into a well pumphouse. These buildings were built by Jonathan Leavitt, a farmer and blacksmith, and were later owned by his son Almah, a sign painter. In the 1980s the property was used by the Concord Coach Society (now the Abbot-Downing Historical Society) as a headquarters and museum facility. The shop building in particular is notable for its adaptive reuse (as blacksmithy, paint shop, and museum), and for its second floor ballroom space, an unusual location for that type of social space. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history Leavitt Farm is located in an increasingly less rural area of eastern Concord, on the north side of Old Loudon Road a short way west of its junction with Loudon Road (New Hampshire Route 9). The farm now consists of about , bounded on the north by Interstate 393. The buildings are clustered near Old Loudon Road, with the house at the center, the barn to the left, the shop to the right, and the pumphouse behind the house. The house is a 1¬Ω-story Cape-style structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main entrance is flanked by sidelight windows, and is topped by a decorative panel incised with stars. The barn is finished in wooden clapboards and has an L shape, with the main gable facing the road and entrances facing front and right in the crook of the L. The shop is a two-story frame structure, with a utilitarian ground floor, and a ballroom on the upper level, finished in plaster with stencil decoration. The property was developed by Jonathan Leavitt, who bought the land in 1847. Initially a farmer, in his later years he also worked as a blacksmith, work he performed in the shop building. It is likely that he hosted social events for the community in the ballroom on the shop's second floor. Leavitt's son Almah, who purchased the property from his father in 1888, used the shop to paint carriages and signs. In 1980, the property was purchased by a local historical society and adapted for use as a museum devoted to carriages. The society has since relocated to facilities at the fairgrounds in Hopkinton; this is now private property.

The Israel‚Äôs permanent mission in the Philippines has been representing the country since the year 1962. The current ambassador of Israel to the Philippines is Ambassador Rafael Harpaz.  Historical Background  When Adolf Hitler became the chancellor of Germany in January 1933, he initiated the killing of almost six million Jews. More than a thousand of German and Austrian Jews escaped to the Philippines when no other country accepted them. The rescue strategy was decided while playing cards and smoking cigars by three men: President Manuel L. Quezon, Paul McNutt and Frieder family. President Quezon opened the country's doors to the fleeing refugees as \\"it was the right thing to do\\". McNutt, who was the American High Commissioner to the Philippines, jeopardized his career as he persuaded the US government to issue thousands of working visas for the Jews, while the Frieder brothers, provided jobs in their own cigar factory. He and his brothers also raised money for the Jews' transport to Manila and established shelters and schools.  Establishment of Relationship  In 1947, the Philippines was one of the 33 countries and the only Asian country who voted for the UN Resolution 181 referring to the partition of Palestine and the creation of the State of Israel. A Treaty of Friendship was signed on February 26, 1958 indicating full diplomatic relations between the two nations. The Philippine and Israel embassies were both opened in 1962, in Manila and Tel Aviv respectively. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed by both countries in 1997, establishing bilateral ties in economy, education, trade, science, and tourism.  Today  The good relations and cooperation between the State of Israel and the Republic of the Philippines is continuously growing. Various agreements between the countries have been signed and are being operated. The most recently signed agreement is the ‚ÄúAir Service Agreement‚Äù in which the number of flights was increased. The agreement also enabled Tel Aviv to be a stopover point on flights to Europe. Investors from Israel consider the Philippines as a viable investment site and are promoting the country as the best in Southeast Asia. Among the Israeli companies that invested in the Philippines are Amdocs Limited, ECI Telecom LTD and Vishay Intertechnology have already invested in the Philippines. Currently, there are about $200 million worth of bilateral contracts between the two countries. The Israel Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines, meanwhile, would like to focus more on tourism and plans to triple the bilateral contracts in the coming years. The strong cultural relation between the two countries can be seen in the different events and activities organized by the embassy. Some of the major events annually promoted by the embassy are the Israeli Film Festival (every fourth quarter of the year); the National Day of Israel held (every second quarter of the year); participation to the Philippine International Jazz and Arts Festival. The embassy has also brought Israeli artists to the Philippines such as the director Tomer Heymann; choreographer Ido Tadmor; musicians Guy Mentesh and Yahel Doron. As of 2013, an estimated number of 31,000 Filipinos are residing in Israel. Most of the Filipino migrants work as caregivers while a small portion works in hotels and restaurants. However, despite the close association of Filipinos being caregivers in Israel, Rose ‚ÄúOsang‚Äù Fostanes proved that Filipinos are talented and have so much in store. Osang came to Israel in 2008 to work as a caregiver. After six years of residing to the country, on January 14 of 2014, she won the first season of ‚ÄúX-Factor Israel‚Äù ‚Äìthis became possible with the enormous support given to her by the people of Israel. Furthermore, two documentary films focusing on Filipino workers based in Israel were shown in the Philippines and Israel ‚ÄìTransit and Paperdolls.‚ÄúTransit‚Äù (2013) is a Philippine independent film about the challenges of Filipino families living outside the country, as well as the dilemma of identities of two Filipino children living in Israel. On the other hand, the film ‚ÄúPaperdolls‚Äù (2006) is a documentary film by Tomer Heymann, an Israeli award-winning filmmaker. The film is about a community of transvestite Filipinos who make a living in Israel as live-in care givers 6 days a week and as a group of drag performers on their free night ‚Äìin which they are called ‚Äúthe paperdolls‚Äù. In November 2013, the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in history, typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines. The Israeli government, after hearing the devastating news, immediately sent a team of 148-member from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) assisted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). The government also reconstructed buildings, restored water supply, and set up a field hospital to provide immediate medical response such as delivery of babies, perform surgeries and treatment of more than 2,800 victims. They also conducted search and rescue operations and sent relief goods for the people affected by the disaster. Numerous organizations and institutions from Israel likewise helped the victims of the typhoon such as IsraAID (Israel forum for international Humanitarian Aid), Boys town Jerusalem, Israeli Relief Coalition and other volunteers from Israel has sent medical assistance to the victims.  MASHAV (Agency for International Development)  MASHAV is Israel's international development cooperation program. It was launched in 1957 with the purpose of spreading knowledge and related technologies which helped in the country's rapid development. The programs which Mashav prioritize today include poverty alleviation, empowerment of women, education services, assistance in agricultural methods, and other humanitarian projects. Since its establishment, the program has trained close to 270,000 course participants from 132 countries ‚Äìincluding the Philippines. Various MASHAV courses are being offered in the Philippines. Recently, the program offered new courses for the country which includes: International Training on Clean Technologies, Course on Developing and Organizing a Trauma System and MCS Organization, Feeding the Future: Food Safety and Technology in times of Global Change and Commercial Beekeeping in Modern Agriculture. Moreover, the program keeps its contacts with former course applicants for them to be part of the ‚Äú Shalom Club‚Äù ‚Äìit serves as forum for all MASHAV alumni. There are over 70 shalom clubs worldwide in which the members are encouraged to participate in social and professional activities, to attend fund-raising events, lectures ranging from AIDS education and business management and exchange ideas about a certain issue. The embassy of Israel in Manila is a partner of the Shalom Club in the Philippines. Their goal is to seek human and sustainable development, as well as to improve bilateral relations of the two countries.

Shot on location in San Francisco, it was followed by a 1987 sequel titled Criminally Insane 2. A third film, Crazy Fat Ethel, was released in 2016.  Plot  The morbidly obese Ethel Janowski (institutionalized due to her bouts of paranoia, depression, and violence) is released into the care of her grandmother, despite Doctor Gerard's unease regarding Ethel's discharge. Upon moving into her grandmother's San Francisco home, Ethel begins consuming massive amounts of food, repeatedly claiming that the employees of the institution were trying to starve her to death. In an attempt to stop Ethel's gorging, Mrs. Janowski empties the refrigerator and locks the cupboards. Ethel and her grandmother argue, and when the elder Janowski threatens to call the sanitarium, Ethel impales her with a knife and then mutilates the old woman's hand to get the cabinet key she was holding in a death grip. Ethel locks her grandmother's corpse in a bedroom, and places an order for more food. When the delivery boy arrives with the groceries, Ethel is unable to pay for them, and stabs the deliverer with a broken bottle when he tries to leave with the order. After Ethel moves the boy's body, her prostitute sister, Rosalie, arrives, and announces that she will staying for a while. Ethel ignores calls from her doctor, and attempts to cover up the odor of her decaying victims when Rosalie complains about the smell coming from the locked bedroom. While at a bar one night, Rosalie runs into John, her unfaithful and abusive ex-boyfriend, and pimp. John follows Rosalie home, and manages to get on her good side, despite at one point proclaiming, \\"Rosalie, I'm gonna tell you the truth for once, okay? You need a good beating every once in a while. All women do. And you especially. Okay?\\" When John and Rosalie fall asleep after having sex, Doctor Gerard visits, wanting to know why Ethel has been missing her appointments with him. Ethel bludgeons the doctor with a candlestick holder, and puts his body with the others. Three days after the murder of the delivery boy, Detective McDonough visits to question Ethel about his disappearance, and leaves after Ethel gives a few evasive statements. That night, Rosalie and John, unable to tolerate the stink coming from Mrs. Janowski's sealed room any longer, decide to break down the door in the morning. After her sister and John go back to bed, Ethel murders them with a cleaver, laughing maniacally while doing so. Ethel sleeps with John's body (possibly having sex with it) and is then shown doing things like destroying a mannequin, and frolicking near a cemetery in garish clothing. An alcoholic client of Rosalie drops by unexpectedly, and stumbles onto his Rosalie's remains, so Ethel strangles him. Detective McDonough returns to re- interview Ethel, and even though Ethel gives contradictory information, the detective leaves without incident. Ethel proceeds to dismember her victims, stuff the pieces in sacks, and drive them out to a seaside area with the intent of dumping them in the ocean. Since there are too many witnesses present, Ethel is forced to return home with the bags, which she drags back into the house, forgetting to close the trunk of her car on the way in. A suspicious neighbor peers into the trunk, and calls the police after finding a severed hand in it. The film ends with Detective McDonough walking in on Ethel eating one of her grandmother's arms.

Independent on September 13, 2005, as a part of a double-feature with Satan's Black Wedding.  Reception  Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews awarded the film a grade B-, calling it \\"an offbeat and obscure trashy comical horror thriller\\". Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave a grade 4¬Ω out of a possible 5 to the film, and wrote, \\"Oh Lord, you've GOT to love Criminally Insane. This unfettered freak show of a fright flick, starring the world's portliest serial killer (yes, even bigger than John Wayne Gacy and Leatherface, combined) is so downright depraved, so tantalizing in its turgid storytelling and squalid scenarios that words cannot begin to describe its baneful beauty\\" and \\"This is the type of movie the 70s are famous for, off the wall experiments in execution and excess. Imagine Kathy Bates blown up like a balloon and running around brandishing a butcher's knife and you start to get the idea of how stellar this fright flick really is. The terror is kept to a minimum, and the storyline is just an excuse to see Ethel eat and kill, but when it's as bloody and bold as this film, who really cares\\". Similarly, DVD Verdict's David Johnson wrote, \\"This flick is deserving of its title‚Äîit is absolutely crazy\\" and \\"This is just a fun, gruesome hour of weirdness\\". Alternately, The Terror Trap rated the film two and a half out of five stars, stating that the film never really takes off in spite of treating its premise as a straight psychological horror film and Alden's interesting performance.

In a story about a talent manager seeking the truth behind an actress's apparent suicide, who discovers the enigmatic individuals responsible for sourcing, trading, and distributing malicious rumors, factual or imagined, the film addresses the sensationalistic and poisonous tabloid culture of South Korea, where rumor-mongering drives lucrative web traffic while also wreaking unaccountable havoc on its victims' lives. Plot A scandalous rumor about Mi-jin (Go Won-hee), an up-and-coming actress, is included as a gossip item in a stock market tipsheet (jjirasi) and propagated by the tabloids, causing her to kill herself in an apparent suicide. Woo-gon (Kim Kang-woo), Mi-jin's devoted longtime manager who dedicated everything to building her career, initiates a vengeful investigation to expose the sources of the rumor. With unexpected assistance from tabloid distributor Mr. Park (Jung Jin-young) and legendary wiretapper Baek Moon (Ko Chang-seok), Woo unravels the opaque and lucrative world of secret tips and salacious rumors. The film portrays a particularly insidious and unexpected forum for tabloid gossip-mongering: jjirasi (from the Japanese word chirashi, meaning \\"leaflet\\"), or the stock market tipsheet. In weekly secret meetings consisting of corporate personnel, politicians, reporters, public officials, and others, insiders exchange information about the latest goings-on.

Hansing, 539 F.3d 1011 (9th Cir. 2008) is a diversity jurisdiction case brought by California resident, Paul Boschetto (\\"Boschetto\\") against certain private corporations with their principal place of business in Wisconsin. The case involved the determination of the question whether the sale of an item via the internet consumer-to-consumer trading portal, eBay, by the defendants in Wisconsin to the plaintiff in California, was sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant in the buyer's forum state. At the first instance, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California decided against Boschetto and held that a lone ‚ÄúeBay sale consummated with a California purchaser, was insufficient to establish jurisdiction over any of the defendants.‚Äù Boschetto appealed against the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The appellate court affirmed the decision of the district court and denied relief to Boschetto. The Court became the first federal appellate court to address whether personal jurisdiction in a forum state could be established when an out-of-state resident makes use of an intermediary website accessible by forum-state citizens.  Background  = Parties to the dispute and relevant facts = The plaintiff in the case, Paul Boschetto, was a resident of San Francisco, California. The defendants Frank-Boucher Chrysler Dodge-Jeep, Gordie Boucher Ford and Boucher Automotive Group (\\"Boucher defendants\\") were private corporations with their principal place of business in Wisconsin. Defendant, Hansing, was an employee of one of the Boucher defendants. The Boucher defendants were automobile dealers. Boschetto alleged, that on August 1, 2005, defendant Hansing posted a listing for auction on eBay.com advertising a 1964 Ford Galaxie car as an \\"R Code\\" in \\"awesome condition,\\" \\"recently rebuilt\\" and \\"ready to be driven.\\" The Boucher defendants also operated a website that advertised their auto dealership. However, this website was not referred to or connected to the transaction at issue. In response to the listing, Boschetto bid $34,106 and on the same day received a notification from eBay informing him that his bid had succeeded. Boschetto paid for the car and was told that he could pick up the car from the Wisconsin dealership where Hansing worked. He hired a delivery company to transport the vehicle to California and received it on September 15, 2005. Upon delivery, Boschetto discovered that the car was not an \\"R Code\\" as advertised and had several other problems too. He tried contacting eBay and the defendants to rescind the purchase but his efforts failed. Consequently, he filed a complaint in the United States District Court, Northern District of California on February 23, 2006. In his complaint, he alleged four state law causes of action (violation of the California Consumer Protection Act; breach of contract; misrepresentation; and fraud). He pleaded diversity jurisdiction pursuant to the federal statute, . The Boucher defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. The district court granted the defendant‚Äôs motion and held that a single \\"eBay sale consummated with a California purchaser, was insufficient to establish jurisdiction over any of the defendants.\\" Boschetto also requested the district court to permit additional discovery relevant to jurisdiction. But, the court exercised its discretion and denied the request stating that Boschetto's request was premised on \\"speculation without any support\\". Following these findings, Boschetto timely appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. = Issues before the Appellate Court = There were two issues before the Appellate Court: # Whether the sale of an item via the eBay Internet auction site provided sufficient \\"minimum contacts\\" to support personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant in the buyer‚Äôs forum state? # Whether the district court abused its discretion by denying Boschetto's request for jurisdictional discovery?  Appellate Court's holding  The Court of Appeals decided both the issues in favor of the Boucher defendants. With regard to the first issue the court held that the \\"sale of one automobile via the eBay website, without more, does not establish jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant in the forum state\\". And with regard to the second issue the court decided that since Boschetto did not submit any evidence or allegation that the defendants were involved in more than just one sale, \\"the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to allow jurisdictional discovery.\\"  Court‚Äôs rationale  = Personal jurisdiction over non-resident defendant =  Purposeful availment standard  In reaching its conclusion about the lack of personal jurisdiction, the court applied a three-part test from Schwarzenegger v. Fred Martin Motor Co., 374 F.3d 797 (9th Cir. 2004), which stated that to determine whether the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction is appropriate, \\"the non-resident defendant must purposefully direct his activities or consummate some transaction with the forum or resident thereof; or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws\\". Further, \\"the claim must be one which arises out of or relates to the defendant's forum-related activities\\"; and \\"the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with fair play and substantial justice\\". The court further observed that the plaintiff had the burden of proving the first two prongs of the foregoing test and only then the defendant was required to come forward and show that the \\"exercise of jurisdiction would not be reasonable\\". The court while clarifying the standard of \\"purposeful availment\\" as stated in first prong of the Scharzenegger test, stated that ‚Äúto have purposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing business in the forum, a defendant must have performed some type of affirmative conduct which allows or promotes the transaction of business within the forum state.‚Äù The court also noted that \\"a contract alone does not establish minimum contacts in the plaintiff‚Äôs home forum\\". Applying the \\"purposeful availment\\" standard to the facts of the case, the court noted that the arrangement between Boschetto and Hansing was a contract for a sale of a good and was \\"insufficient to have created a substantial connection with California\\". Further, \\"the Boucher Defendants did not create any ongoing obligations with Boschetto in California; once the car was sold the parties were to go their separate ways\\". Based on this reasoning, the court held that the Boucher defendants did not purposefully avail themselves of the privilege of doing business in California and therefore were not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in California.  Interactive websites  The court also discussed Cybersell, Inc. v. Cybersell, Inc. 130 F.3d 414 (9th Cir. 1997), wherein the court had looked at the level of interactivity of a website for the purposes of determining its jurisdictional effect. That court noted the lack of interactivity in Cybersell and concluded that the defendant had \\"done no act and consummated no transaction, nor has it performed any act by which it purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities, in Arizona, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of Arizona law\\". In Boschetto, the court observed that \\"where the Internet site actually belongs to and is operated by the defendant, the nature of the website has jurisdictional significance because the website allows the defendant to maintain some ongoing contact with the forum state\\". The Boucher defendants temporarily used the listing on eBay to \\"advertise a good for sale and that listing closed once the item was sold, thereby extinguishing the Internet contact for this transaction within the forum state\\". However, the court distinguished the conduct of the Boucher defendants with cases where the defendants were using eBay platform as a \\"broader vehicle for commercial activity\\". The court held, quoting from International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, that \\"where eBay is used as a means for establishing regular business with a remote forum such that a finding of personal jurisdiction comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.., then a defendant's use of eBay may be properly taken into account for purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction.\\" = Exercise of the discretion by the District Court in denying jurisdictional discovery = The court discussed the standard of reviewing the exercise of discretion by the district court in permitting or denying jurisdictional discovery and observed that the district court‚Äôs decision ‚Äúwill not be reversed except upon the clearest showing that denial of discovery results in actual and substantial prejudice to the complaining litigant.‚Äù The court further observed that the fact whether the Boucher defendants had used eBay to conduct significant quantities of sales of automobiles to California residents might have been jurisdictionally relevant, but Boschetto neither presented any evidence of such sales nor made any such allegation in his complaint. Therefore, \\"the denial of Boschetto's request for discovery, which was based on little more than a hunch that it might yield jurisdictionally relevant facts, was not an abuse of discretion.\\"‚Äù  Circuit Judge Pamela Ann Rymer‚Äôs concurrence  Judge Rhymer concurred with the opinion written by Judge B. Fletcher, but wrote separately to highlight her disagreement with Boschetto‚Äôs argument that the Boucher defendants, as sellers on ebay, necessarily availed themselves of the privilege of doing business in each state across the United States of America. While elaborating on the concept of \\"purposeful availment\\", she observed quoting from Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, that ‚Äúthe purposeful availment requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts.‚Äù Dealing with Boschetto's argument that the Boucher defendants could foresee that California residents would bid on their auction, and that they would benefit from their participation, she observed that \\"foreseeable participation by Californians [was] not enough. Hansing must have done something more to aim his auction expressly at the state, such as individually targeting California residents\\".

The Israeli Navy force consisted of Sa'ar 2-class, Sa'ar 3-class, and Sa'ar 4-class missile boats armed with Gabriel anti-ship missiles while the Syrian Navy force consisted of Soviet-made Komar- and Osa-class missile boats armed with Soviet-manufactured P-15 Termit (NATO reporting name SS-N-2 Styx) anti-ship missiles.\\"The Boats of Cherbourg\\" by Abraham Rabinovich, Chapter 24: Skirmish  Prelude  After losing three missile boats during the first Battle of Latakia on 7 October 1973, the Syrian Navy refused to engage the Israeli Navy in open battle at sea. Instead, it used its missile boats on short forays from harbor mouths to launch missiles, relying on coastal artillery batteries for defense. To provoke the Syrian missile boats into open combat, the commander of the Israeli Navy missile-boat flotilla, Michael Barkai, was dispatched with seven missile boats to launch a night attack on Syrian ports. Oil tanks at the ports were marked as secondary targets. Barkai split his force, assigning two Sa'ar 4-class missile boats to attack the Port of Banias and another two boats to attack the Syrian naval base at Mina Al-Baida. He assigned the other three missile boats, the Sa'ar 3-class boats and and the Sa'ar 2-class boat , to attack Latakia again.  Battle  As the boats began their attack, Barkai ordered them to turn their electronic countermeasures (ECM) on and at the same time proceed to their targets at 40 knots. As they had been during the earlier battle, Syrian radar operators were confused, believing they were tracking five groups of targets with a combined 17 ships between 12 and 15 nautical miles off the coast. The Syrian Navy dispatched two missile boats from Banias and two from Latakia to fire their missiles at the targets. Upon reaching Latakia, the Israelis found that the Syrian missile boats were using foreign merchant ships anchored off the harbor for protection, darting in and out from among the ships to fire their missiles. The Israeli boats were ordered to fire on the Syrian boats despite the risk of hitting the unarmed merchant ship. As a result, Israeli Gabriel missiles sank two of the merchant ships, one Japanese and one Greek. INS Hetz sighted one Styx missile missing her overhead, and a gunner on Hetz shot down another Styx. The battle lasted for almost two hours, with the Israeli boats zigzagging around the port trying to evade fire from the Syrian missile boats and coastal artillery, while at the same time alternately shooting at either the Syrian missile boats or at the oil tanks on shore. The Israelis ultimately failed to ignite any of the oil tanks and could only account for probable hits on one Osa-class and one Komar- class boat. Only the attack on the Port of Banias was successful in igniting the oil tanks on shore.

He does not believe in > juries, and it is his special delight to ridicule the Mayor's Court which > sits over the way.\\". He had a reputation for bluntness to the point of rudeness. In cases in which he was involved he variously told counsel, \\"You've said it three times; now say it three times more, and that will be once for each of the jury and once for me.\\" On another occasion he remarked \\"Don't talk, sir; hold your tongue. Get into Parliament, or the County Council, or some other talking-shop, if you want to talk, but you must not do it here.\\" On yet another occasion he told a solicitor to \\"go and buy a shilling Guide to the Law\\". However, his biographer said of him that \\"His rugged manners hid, and barely hid, a heart of gold\\". Kerr gave two windows to Govan Old church in Glasgow; the 'Emmaus' window in 1891, and 'Christ blessing the children' in 1902. Both were made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne.

Foot is best known for her work during World War II on military camouflage and for her post-war career as an artist and teacher in Scotland. Early life Camouflaging a Cruiser in Dock (1943) (Art. IWM LD 3016) Foot was born in Knowles Bank near Pembury in Kent and studied at the Central School of Art between 1938 and 1941. World War Two After the war began, the Central School of Art was evacuated to Northampton in 1941 and Foot gave up her studies to take a job as a Junior Technical Assistant in the Naval Section of the Directorate of Camouflage based in Leamington Spa. Her duties included painting camouflage designs onto models of ships. The models were all based on real ships; if the real ship was sunk or lost the model was retired from further use. Whilst at the Camouflage Directorate, Foot drew and painted her colleagues at work, both at Leamington Spa and at the docks where they painted their camouflage schemes onto ships. She submitted some of this work to the War Artists' Advisory Committee and had one painting, Camouflaging a Cruiser in Dock, purchased by the Committee in June 1943. Post-war career When the war ended, Foot returned to her art studies. She studied at the Chelsea School of Art for a short time before she moved to Edinburgh where she married Eric Schilsky, an artist whom she had first met at the Camouflage Unit. Schilsky was head of the School of Sculpture at Edinburgh College of Art and Foot enrolled there, gaining her Diploma in 1949. In 1949 Foot had her first solo exhibition at the Institute Francais in Edinburgh. She went on to exhibit with the New English Art Club, the London Group, at the Royal Academy and the Royal Scottish Academy. The critic Jack Beddington included Foot as one of the subjects in his 1957 book Young Artists of Promise. Foot also taught for periods of time, at the Edinburgh College of Art in 1950 and 1951, and at Oxenfoord Castle School, in Midlothian, throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In 1994 Foot donated her sketches from Leamington Spa to the Imperial War Museum. Works by Foot are also held by Aberdeen Art Gallery and the Scottish Arts Council.

The company's headquarters has been located in Bad Zurzach, Switzerland, since 1977, and it has branches in 45 countries. In addition to the Triumph brand, the company produces and distributes the products under the brands sloggi and AMO‚Äôs Style by Triumph. Triumph International has been an industry leader, particularly in women's and sleepwear, since the 1960s. Shares of the German subsidiary have been traded on the stock exchange until 2011.  History  corporate building in Heubach (2011) In 1886, Johann Gottfried Spiesshofer and Michael Braun founded a factory for the production of corsets in Heubach (Baden-Wurttemberg). They first employed six people on the same number of sewing machines. That number rose to 150 people in 1890, and in 1894 their first exports were sent abroad, to England. It was only in 1902 that Spieshofer and Braun registered the Triumph brand, which was reminiscent of the Parisian Arc de Triomphe, to which International was later added. After the economic boom in the 1920s, demand for the classic corset declined, which is why the company began parallel production of brassieres. In the 1930s, Triumph International also began producing corselets. In 1933, the first foreign branch was set up in Bad Zurzach (Switzerland). With the division of Germany in 1949, the Triumph International brand continued in the German Democratic Republic, but business activities there came to a virtual standstill. However, the internationalization of the company continued in the following period and beginning in the 1950s, offices were opened in Belgium, Great Britain, Sweden, Norway and Austria. Triumph International further expanded in 1960 by establishing its Asia-Pacific region headquarters in Hong Kong, and opening its first Japanese branch in 1963. At the time, observers already described it as a \\"cunning web\\" of companies, some of which were registered in the tax havens of Liechtenstein and Bermuda. In the late 1960s, Triumph International's market share for corsetry in Germany was about 50 percent. At that time, the group had generated sales of 620 million Deutsche Mark and employed 22,600 employees. In the mid-1960s Triumph International introduced broad scale electronic data processing. Due to the economic crisis, the company encountered significant difficulties for the first time at the beginning of the 1970s, meaning the company even had to introduce short-term work. The crisis also affected the company‚Äôs tights sales, which they had begun in 1969 and discontinued only three years later. At the same time, Triumph International began for the first time to produce products from lighter fabrics with fibers such as nylon or lycra. At the end of the 1970s, the new sloggi brand was introduced, under which underwear and other products with high cotton content were marketed. The company moved its headquarters from Germany to Switzerland in 1977, and its holding has since been headquartered in Bad Zurzach. By 1986, sales increased to 996 million Swiss francs and the number of employees fell slightly to 19,000 employees. At the same time, sales began in the People's Republic of China and beginning in 1988, individual Triumph products were manufactured under license in East Germany for the local market. This included swimwear in addition to underwear. With the takeover of two French name brands, HOM and Valis√®re, Triumph International ventured into the men's underwear and high-quality lingerie market. At the same time, the company announced in 1995 that in the future it would focus more on its Triumph umbrella brand, under which a number of brands would be classified. To that end, an advertising campaign was launched featuring Naomi Campbell and Helena Christensen. In the 1990s, Triumph International launched another phase of international expansion, and since 1998 it has been present on the subcontinent of India. In 2001, its newest production facility opened in Duna√∫jv√°ros (Hungary), which has been sold in the interim. After the turn of the millennium, Triumph was one of the biggest textile manufacturers in terms of sales in the domestic market. From 2008 to 2012, the company hosted the Triumph Inspiration Awards, where lingerie designers were able to compete according to an annually changing theme. The entries were evaluated both by a jury and according to the votes by visitors to the competition website. In 2009, the competition attracted broader attention, particularly as that event was held in London. Initially a local competition was held in the participating countries prior to the international final competition. Since 2012, all the collections of Triumph International have been tested for harmful substances and certified under the Oeko-tex standard for textiles, after individual products had been successfully tested as early as 1993 when the initiative was established. In recent years, the company has expanded, opening new stores of its own and acquiring competitors. In 2010, Triumph International acquired Beldona, the leading Swiss distributor of lingerie, and later purchased other distributors in Mexico and the United States. The Triumph International AG, headquartered in Munich, under which the company's German business is associated, was once again fully acquired by the company in 2011 through the exclusion of minority shareholders; by now, it has been transformed into a GmbH (Triumph International GmbH). Since then, company stocks have no longer been traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and the company is wholly owned by the Braun and Spiesshofer families. In 2017, Triumph made the decision to close its standalone stores in the United Kingdom, beginning to only sell online and through concessions in stores like Debenhams and House of Fraiser.  Brands  Triumph underwear from the 1950s Triumph bra presented in 2009 The Triumph brand is the focus of the company. Products are divided into several categories for different target groups, with Triumph International typically presenting several collections each year. As of 2010, the importance of shapewear for the company increased, and Triumph's sale of these products attracted special attention. In 2013, Triumph was honored as one of the best brands. In 2015, the Magic Wire bra received the Red Dot Design Award; at the 2018 ISPO, the almost seamless \\"Seamless Motion Sports Bra\\" from Triaction by Triumph is awarded the ISPO Award in the Health & Fitness category. In 2019, consumers called up by the influential German trade magazine \\"Textilwirtschaft\\" vote Triumph to be the by far most popular body wear manufacturer brand. In the late 1970s, Triumph International launched the sloggi cotton underwear brand, at first only for female customers and later also with products for men (sloggi Men) and swimwear (sloggi swim). Since the 1980s, Triumph International has also been targeting young customers aged up to 25 years old with the BeeDees brand. The products are characterized by accessories and patterned fabrics. In addition to sloggi and BeeDees, the company has also been marketing sports bras under Triaction since the late 1990s. In accordance with the company‚Äôs strategy to focus on its tow global brands, Triumph and sloggi, the BeeDees brand was sold in 2017 to the Jansen Fashion Group (in Wesseling, Germany). In the 1980s HOM, the French manufacturer of upscale underwear for men, was purchased and has since continued as a trademark within the company. The headquarters was located in Marseille. In early 2015, HOM was sold to the Austrian Huber Group, as Triumph wanted to streamline its portfolio. Valis√®re is the label for upper segment products, which beginning in 2007 became also available in Germany and was used primarily for luxury lingerie. Triumph products are distributed both via trade partners and department stores, as well as in their own shops. By the end of 2017, the company had built a network of 3,600 controlled points of sale in 120 countries, which are operated by Triumph itself, by franchisees or run by other partners. In addition, Triumph serves 40,000 retail trade partners. The company is one of the largest lingerie retailers in Germany based on the number of branches. The largest branch in terms of retail space was opened in Dresden's Centrum Gallery in 2012; 2018 saw the opening of the store in Hamburg‚Äôs Jungfernstieg; other flagships stores are, for example, in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Copenhagen. In addition, Triumph International operates several online stores. These were developed using a fulfillment service provider that is part of Arvato.  Criticism  In 2002, Triumph International had to close its factory in Myanmar due to public pressure. The Berne Declaration and Clean Clothes Campaign accused the company of renting land from the country's military regime and thus indirectly supporting it. In January 2002, Triumph International announced that it would close the affected factory and offer a social plan for the remaining employees because no buyer had been found. Moreover, Triumph International clarified that there had not been any forced laborers among the employees. In October 2003, the self- regulatory body of the French advertising industry criticized Triumph International for a campaign for the sloggi brand. At the center of the protest was a picture of scantily clad women on billboards which advertised thongs under the slogan \\"It's String Time\\". It was claimed that the ads violated the dignity of women and harmed the public perception of advertising, but the company did not adjust the campaign. It was also criticized for the same reason by leading French politicians like S√©gol√®ne Royal. In 2008, Triumph International came under fire after a female president of a local union was dismissed in Thailand. She had appeared on a Thai evening television program with a T-shirt on which a controversial political statement could be seen. The statement addressed the subject of a case of L√®se Majest√©, a crime prosecuted with high prison sentences in Thailand and a highly sensitive issue in the Kingdom. The company's management had the view that the appearance had harmed their public image and therefore laid off the staff member in question. One of the company‚Äôs Thai work councils, Triumph International Labor Union, protested and collected 2,500 signatures to petition for the rehiring of the union president, supported in solidarity in Germany, inter alia, by the ver.di youth. In November 2008, the Labor Court in Bangkok found the lay-off to have been lawful. Most recently, Triumph International has been the subject of even greater criticism after mass layoffs in Thailand and the Philippines at the end of 2009 were met with transnational protests by trade unions. The company regretted this step and made it clear that it was necessitated by the global economic crisis. Allegations that, parallel to the redundancies, another location was being set up in Thailand, were unfounded. In 2014, the Japanese division of Triumph issued a voluntary recall on around 22,000 bras for underwire fault. The recall applied to bras that were sold only in Japan. There have been no reports of injuries from the defect.

It was aired on March 5, 2014. The episode was written by Ben Karlin and directed by Gail Mancuso. Ty Burrell won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance in this episode. Plot Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) has accepted a new job and he is excited while preparing for his first day. Wendy (Aisha Tyler), his boss, tries to show him the office and introduce him to his co-workers but a series of misunderstandings leads Mitch to believe that Wendy is a monster who treats people poorly. He decides to stand up and tells her how horrible she is and when he realizes that he was mistaken and misinterpreted her signs, he apologizes. Cam (Eric Stonestreet) gets to run the school's spring dance and he is excited. Everything goes perfect for him until the moment Se√±or Kaplan (Will Sasso), the former Spanish teacher of the school, appears and steals his light. Cam feels excluded and he does everything he can to outdo him. When the moment of the faculty to dance comes, he gets on the dance floor to show his dance moves but Se√±or Kaplan joins him leading Cam to grab Claire (Julie Bowen), who is the chaperone of Alex (Ariel Winter) and Luke (Nolan Gould), and start dancing with her, catching him by surprise. Claire wants to help Alex and Luke with their dates. She first helps Rhonda (Arden Belle), Luke's date, to dress more like a girl and be beautiful. Luke is not really happy with that because he preferred her the way she was and asks Claire to \\"fix\\" her. As for Alex, Claire believes that Alex likes Drew (Joey Luthman) but she is afraid to say it so she tells Drew that she and Phil (Ty Burrell) will be back home late and she would like for him to keep Alex company till they get back. Alex also objects to Claire's meddling. Jay (Ed O'Neill) and Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) have to babysit Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) since Mitch is at work and Cam at the school's spring dance. Lily breaks Gloria's phone by accident but when she is asked who did it, she blames Joe. Jay and Gloria do not believe her and try to make her confess the truth with not much success. Phil has to host the realtor's banquet and asks Haley (Sarah Hyland) to escort him since Claire has to chaperone Alex and Luke. Haley is texting during Phil's performance, something that distracts him and makes him fall off the stage and hurt his foot. Phil is disappointed at Haley because she was apparently not paying attention to him while performing, but when he wins the big award of the night, Haley accepts it for him because he can not walk. Haley's speech moves Phil and makes him proud. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Spring-a-Ding-Fling\\" was watched by 9.22 million; up by 0.70 from the previous episode. =Reviews= \\"Spring-a-Ding-Fling\\" received positive reviews from critics, with many praising Ty Burrell's performance. Joshua Alston from The A.V. Club gave an A- rating to the episode, praising its cold open and saying it \\"felt like an uptick from the beginning [...] none of the plots in \\"Spring\\" sputtered or faded away in the third act, as has often been the case with the episodes this season. It's a finely tuned, admirably paced episode that easily stands among this season's three best.\\" Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.5/5 saying: \\"Most of the characters were doing a little peacock-ing on this latest installment. Since there are a couple of definitions for this out there, let's go with number-five on Urban Dictionary: when someone is blatantly obvious that they are proud of something.\\" Madina Papadopoulos of Paste Magazine rated the episode with 9.5/10 stating that Phil's performance as a host at the SCARB (Southern California Annual Realtor's Banquet) Awards was an Oscar worthy night. \\"There are many wonderful moments in this episode. Cam‚Äôs dance-off with Se√±or Kaplan, Claire pimping out Alex to her nerd date, Mitch blasting his boss only to realize she‚Äôs actually really nice. But the best scene, what really takes the cake, is Phil‚Äôs, \\"I‚Äôm Selling Away\\" performance, sung to the tune of \\"I‚Äôm Sailing Away.\\" Where do I even begin to praise this moment? It was blissful hilarity.\\" In addition, Jordan Adler from We Got This Covered gave a positive review to the episode calling it \\"charming\\" and \\"frequently funny\\". Adler also states that the best plot was Mitch's. \\"Despite a bit of clutter and compression, 'Spring-a-Ding-Fling' was a Modern Family episode that could have run in season two. The one-liners are sharp, the actors receive, for the most part, fresh plots that give them a chance to display their range and the two guest stars do not feel wasted.\\" Accolades Ty Burrell submitted this episode for an Emmy nomination & won his second and final Emmy Award for the show.

Major works =Anti-Judaism: The Western Tradition= Nirenberg's 2013 book Anti-Judaism: The Western Tradition is not a history of anti-Semitism, rather, it focuses \\"on the role of anti-Judaism as a constitutive idea and an explanatory force in Christian and post-Christian thought‚Äîthough it starts with Egyptian arguments against the Jews and includes a discussion of early Islam, whose writers echo, and apparently learned from, Christian polemics.\\" Pulling on an array of sources from across the centuries, Nirenberg demonstrates the potency of \\"imaginary Jews\\" in \\"works of the imagination, profound treatises, and acts of political radicalism.\\" Described as \\"an extraordinary scholarly achievement\\", Anti-Judaism: The Western Tradition argues \\"that a certain view of Judaism lies deep in the structure of Western civilization and has helped its intellectuals and polemicists explain Christian heresies, political tyrannies, medieval plagues, capitalist crises, and revolutionary movements.\\" Christopher Smith of King's College London argues that Anti-Judaism represents, \\"the culmination of a career volte-face in respects to his methodological approach. His 1996 work Communities of Violence: Persecution of Minorities in the Middle Ages rejected a longue dur√©e history of anti-Semitism.\\" Whereas, \\"in Anti-Judaism, Nirenberg allows for a continuation of trends in the development of a shared concept of anti-Judaism built on and progressed over\\" a period of three thousand years. Some historians, while praising Nirenberg's oeuvre, have expressed dissatisfaction with the parts concerning contemporary history (for instance, Maurice Kriegel.) =Communities of Violence; Persecution of Minorities in the Middle Ages= Nirenberg's \\"important\\"Review by Ann Kuzdale, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, 66 (1), Spring, 1998. 1996 book Communities of Violence; Persecution of Minorities in the Middle Ages, challenged interpretations that set inter-communal medieval violence (specifically, attacks on lepers, Jews, and Muslims) into larger teleological frameworks. It argued that each event must be understood in its own terms, in the context of economic and social tensions available for exploitation in a specific time and place. He argues that primacy should be given to understanding the local meaning of inter- communal violent events, and that violent events can be better understood as one of the mechanisms that in fact contributed to social stability and kept the overall amount of violence low. The book makes these broader arguments by focusing on Aragon in the 1300s. Nirenberg questions the longue duree approach that sets individual riots, attacks and pogroms into a series that he characterizes as a \\"march of intolerance\\" culminating in modern events, most notably the Holocaust. The book has been understood as a challenge to the entire concept of minority history, reinterpreting groups often cast as \\"other\\" or \\"marginal\\" as integral parts of the societies in which they dwelt. It has also been criticized for facile use of functionalist Anthropology and of the essayist Ren√© Girard's model.

UrbanSitter integrates with Facebook Connect and an internal database, allowing parents to view babysitters hired and reviewed by their Facebook friends and parents from children's schools, sports teams, and local parenting organizations. The company's online booking technology lets parents search for babysitters by specific time and date and schedule a booking. Alternatively, parents can post a job to a virtual job board. To date the company has raised a total of $22.75 million in venture funding. History UrbanSitter's founders conceived of the idea for the service in order to create an easier, faster, more personal way to book childcare. CEO Lynn Perkins remarked in a GigaOM article that \\"I just thought it was kind of ridiculous that you could go to OpenTable and book a restaurant, but when you actually go to find a sitter, it would take you hours and days.\\" Perkins and three co-founders launched UrbanSitter in 2010 with services in the San Francisco Bay Area. The company raised a total of $7.75 million in seed and Series A funding between 2011 and 2012. Since founding, the service has grown to 12 cities throughout the United States, including, among others, San Francisco, New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Seattle. UrbanSitter has approximately 170,000 babysitting jobs and a user base of 70,000 parents and 30,000 sitters as of February 2014. Forbes reported that UrbanSitter saw an \\"increase in clients and bookings of between 20% and 30% per month\\" throughout 2012 and 2013. In December 2013 the company announced that former Pandora executive Jessica Steel would become UrbanSitter's new president. In February 2014 UrbanSitter raised a $15 million Series B funding round. The investment was led by DBL Investors and included participation from Match Group, a division of IAC, Aspect Ventures, Canaan Partners, First Round Capital, Menlo Ventures, and Rustic Canyon Partners. Services Through its website and mobile application, UrbanSitter allows users to vet potential babysitters and nannies, establish regularly scheduled sittings, and find last-minute sitters. UrbanSitter leverages social networks by allowing its software platform to search through a user's Facebook connections via Facebook connect and other local parenting organizations via an internal database, letting parents search for babysitters that have been reviewed by friends or connections within social circles. Transactions are processed in cash or by credit card, with UrbanSitter charging parents a transactional or membership fee in some areas. =Features= UrbanSitter allows both parents and babysitters to create user accounts for free. Parents can view sitter reviews, pictures, videos, availability, hourly rates, as well as how many repeat customers a sitter has had, then schedule interviews and jobs with sitters by paying a pay-as-you-go fee or by subscribing to a monthly or annual membership. Search results can be filtered by a sitter's desired skills, certifications (such as CPR certification), experience, educational background, and response time. Babysitters can find and accept jobs for free or subscribe to a monthly or annual membership to receive a background check as well as other features.

Pagu was also politically active, being associated to the Brazilian Communist Party during the 1930 decade. Biography Born in a family of German descent, Galv√£o was an \\"advanced\\" woman for the moral and social standards of the time. When she was 15 years old, she collaborated with the Br√°s Jornal newspaper, using the pen name Patsy. She completed the course at the S√£o Paulo Normal School in 1928, and joined the Movimento Antropof√°gico, influenced by Oswald de Andrade and Tarsila do Amaral. The nickname \\"Pagu\\" was given to her by the poet Raul Bopp, who dedicated a poem to her (Coco de Pagu). In 1930, Pagu married Oswald de Andrade, who left Tarsila, then his wife. In the same year, Rud√° de Andrade, her first and Andrade's second son is born. Both became militants of the Brazilian Communist Party. From left to right: Pagu, Elsie Lessa, Tarsila do Amaral, Anita Malfatti & Eug√™nia √Ålvaro Moreyra circa 1928 Pagu was arrested in 1931 by participating in a harbor workers' strike in Santos, the first in a series of 23 detentions in her life. After her arrest she published the novel Parque Industrial (Industrial Park), under the pseudonym Mara Lobo. In 1935 she was arrested in Paris as a foreign communist using a false identity, and was repatriated to Brazil. She broke up with Andrade, after many quarrels. Pagu resumed her journalistic activity, but was again arrested and tortured by the forces of the dictatorship of Get√∫lio Vargas, and was jailed for five years. In those five years her son was raised by Andrade. Upon leaving prison in 1940, she broke away from the Communist Party, choosing to instead follow a socialism of Trotskyist line. She joined the newspaper A Vanguarda Socialista along with Geraldo Ferraz, art critic M√°rio Pedrosa, Hilcar Leite and Edmundo Moniz. She married Geraldo Ferraz and from this union her second son was born, Geraldo Galv√£o Ferraz, on June 18, 1941. She moved in with her two children and her husband. Around the same time she travelled to China, obtaining the first soybean seeds that were introduced in Brazil. In 1945 Pagu launched a new novel, A Famosa Revista, written with her husband Geraldo Ferraz. She unsuccessfully attempted a run for state representative in the 1950 elections. In 1952 she attended the School of Dramatic Art in S√£o Paulo, taking their shows to Santos. Linked to the avant-garde theater, they presented her translation of Ionesco's The Bald Singer. She translated and directed Fando et Lis by Fernando Arrabal, an amateur montage in which the young artist Pl√≠nio Marcos debuted. She also translated poems by authors such as Guillaume Apollinaire. Known as a major cultural influence in Santos, Pagu encouraged young talents such as actor and playwright Plinio Marcos and composer Gilberto Mendes. She devoted herself particularly to the stage, especially in encouraging amateur groups. While still working as an art critic, she was stricken with cancer. She traveled to Paris to undergo surgery, but without positive results. Disappointed and desperately sick, Pagu attempted suicide, but did not succeed. Of this episode, she wrote the pamphlet \\"Truth and Freedom\\": \\"A bullet got behind, between gauze pads and shattered memories.\\" She returned to Brazil and died on December 12, 1962, due to the disease. Literature Pagu published the novels Industrial Park (the author's edition, 1933), under the pseudonym Mara Lobo, considered the first Brazilian proletarian novel, and A Famosa Revista (The Famous Magazine) (Americ-Edit, 1945), in collaboration with Geraldo Ferraz. Industrial Park was published in the United States in translation of Kenneth David Jackson in 1994 by the University of Nebraska Press. She has also written detective stories under the pseudonym King Shelter, originally published in Detective magazine, directed by playwright Nelson Rodrigues, and then gathered in Safra Macabra (Livraria Jos√© Olympio Editora, 1998). In her work, along with theater groups, she revealed and translated great authors hitherto unpublished in Brazil, such as James Joyce, Eug√®ne Ionesco, Fernando Arrabal and Octavio Paz. Cultural depictions In 1988, the life of Pagu was told in the film Eternamente Pagu, the first movie directed by Norma Bengell. Carla Camurati played the title role. A song titled \\"Pagu\\" was composed by Rita Lee and Z√©lia Duncan.

Marshall (born 21 July 1978) is a British businessman who has been living in Hungary since 2006. Marshall is Owner and chairman of Aspire Group and Associates Ltd., and Chairman of V√°c FC. Early life Born in Liverpool, Marshall grew up in Aughton, a village approximately 12 miles from the centre of the city. His parents, Peter (originally from Bishop Auckland, Durham) and Daniela(a Czech national who came to the United Kingdom in 1972 at the age of 22) married in 1973. Marshall is the second of four children: two boys and two girls. Marshall attended Town Green School until the age of 11, after which he studied at Ormskirk Grammar School, then Ormskirk College until he turned 18 and moved to Aigburth, central Liverpool. This was when he started his working life as a door-to-door salesman. Business career He worked for a joint venture company of Calor Gas and Texaco 'Calortex' where his role was to build a team of sales representatives. In 2001, he joined Olan Mills Portrait Studios where he was responsible for over 80 studios nationwide throughout the UK. In 2003, he founded his first company, Tech Asia Recruitment Consultancy that was created to assist, find and place post-graduate students as English teachers in schools throughout South Korea. In 2004, he was appointed Sales Director of Homes Deluxe Ltd, that is a prestige Real Estate agency based in Marbella, specialised in exclusive, super deluxe homes. He moved to Budapest in 2006, and became the Development Director of Crown Global Ltd. He was involved in the initial architectural planning of The Gardens Budapest. In 2009, he founded Aspire Group & Associates Ltd that is represented in areas like real estate development, smartphone software development and sports investment. Aspire Group & Associates have bought a 100% shareholding in V√°c Football Club Ltd in July 2012. Marshall is also an associate member of the British Chamber of Commerce in Hungary. Football investments =V√°c FC= Aspire GA, owned by Marshall, started negotiations of buying V√°c FC in April 2012. Following the full scale audit and legal debates Marshall's company became 100% owner of the V√°c club in October 2012. In the next months the financial and legal situation of V√°c FC became more complicated as the previous owner J√≥zsef H√©ger debated Marshall's proprietary rights. Despite the ingravescent situation, the local government and the football players were committed to the British investor. As the situation between the previous club owner and Marshall did not show any sign of consolidation after the winter break, the V√°c government decided to revoke the rights of usage of the town- owned stadium. Following this step the football players, who did not receive their salary for months, called a strike. In this chaotic situation the Hungarian Football Federation started monitoring the legitimate operation of the club. As a result of this procedure the Federation revoked the club licence on 26 March 2013, not much later the club was disqualified from Nemzeti Bajnoks√°g II. At the end V√°c acquired the right to participate in the Pest County I. local division, so \\"the club that has legendary past and an enviable youth program can be taken in hand by the British owner with a clean slate\\". During the summer of 2013 Marshall signed up J√°nos Csank as head coach, who undertook the role due to his past with the club. \\"This club has a special place in my heart, I feel it's almost a duty to come back and help.\\" Marshall provided a HUF 40 million budget for V√°c FC in the 2013‚Äì14 season in order that they could get into NBIII for the next season. =Egri FC= In February 2013 according to the advice of his consultants Marshall bought 75% ownership of Egri FC as the previous owner did not want to finance the club further. Though the incurring costs were higher than expected, Marshall started to consolidate Egri FC with paying the players arrears of salary and starting to build the lighting system of the stadium. In April 2013 in spite all these efforts the local government announced that they would not sponsor the operations of Egri FC any more. As a result of this move Marshall decided to sell his part in the club. Since the end of May 2013 the new owner of Egri FC is S√°ndor K√≥sa.

Despite its youngness, it has played a considerable role in the economic, political, social and educational role in the region throughout history, from antiquity to the present. Early history The oldest ethno-cultural group who lived in the 6th and 5th millennia BC in the territory of Kosovo was the Starƒçevo culture. Members of this group constructed their homes near rivers and the river terraces. They made their homes of willows and mud, while their main profession was plowing and farming. Another ethno-cultural group, which took the place of Starƒçevo culture, is the Vinƒça culture. These population shifts occurred around 4300 BC. The newcomers also built their settlements near rivers. Such settlements were unfortified, with dense rows of willows and mud houses. Remnants of their material culture, mostly different forms of ceramic vessels and the large numbers of baked clay figures, testify on higher cultural level. The Bubanj-Hum culture, an eneolithic culture, followed. This cultural group expanded from the east, from the territory of today's Bulgaria. When carriers of this ethno-cultural group reached the region before the end of the 6th millennium BC, they destroyed Vinƒça settlements. Remnants of their material culture have not survived. After Bubanj-Hum, the Baden culture arrived from the Danube, representing its southernmost influence in Kosovo. Baden culture ended before the end of the 3rd millennium BC. In passing from the 2nd to 1st millennium BC in the period of the late Bronze Age, we find a unique way of burial, present in a large part of Central and Southern Europe, in the framework of which was also seen in Kosovo. The ashes of the dead were burned and placed with different items in a large clay pot, and then buried in the ground. Such an urn was accidentally discovered in Varosh. From the mid-8th century BC to the Roman conquest of the region, a new culture developed, belonging to the Dardani. The Dardani burned the dead and buried their remnants in tumuli tombs. In Ferizaj, two such necropolises have been found, one in the locality of Kuline, near G√´rlic√´, and the other in Mollopolc, along the Ferizaj-≈†timlje road. Around 280 BC, Dardania is recorded as a political community ruled by a king. Most of the information on the Dardani are about their wars against Macedonia. The first contact between the Dardani and the Romans was in 200 BC, when they offered military assistance in a fight against Macedonia. In 96 BC, Roman Emperor Sulla subdued the Dardani. Numerous Roman settlements were established across the valley, notably on the old lake terraces. These settlements also accompanied a road network, connecting cities such as Ulpiana and Skopje, which were part of the route connecting Macedonia to Dalmatia, passing through Ferizaj and the gorge of Ka√ßanik. Parts of the route have been discovered on the river bed of the Lepenac, near the village of Doganaj, and near the village of Reka. Middle Ages Ferizaj's close suburb at the time of the Middle Ages was of great importance. Thence passing was one of the most important routes of the Middle Ages, starting from the north, from Slovenia and Croatia through Sarajevo, to Vuƒçitrn, Pristina and Lipljan, then passing through Ferizaj and ending at Skopje in the south. With this main northern line, traffic affected the Shkod√´r-Prizren road. In the library of St Mark's Basilica, Venice, a manuscript was found, describing an anonymous traveler in 1559/60; \\"Costatinopoli viaggio da Venezia\\". During the continental trip from Venice to Istanbul, noted was as follows: \\"On July 3 I set off and came to a place named Villa Negra (from Italy to Carralev√´)... The valley is surrounded on all sides by hills.\\" He further writes that he reached Sopotnice, near modern-day Ferizaj, with the same name that is located near Ka√ßanik. He then writes that he continued on the path and arrived in Skopje on July 5. Jakov Saranco, Venetian deputy of the royal palace of Sultan Murad III (1575), while traveling to Istanbul route via the Shkod√´r-Prizren road arrived in the Zascodi village, which is located in an area between fertile and forested hills. As such, it is inferred that it referred to Zaskok, which is near Nerodim√´. In the district is a locality which, according to its modern name, Varosh, resembles a structure of a typical Byzantine settlement - more developed than a village, but again not a city. Kosovo became the center of regional activity, with cities such as the previously mentioned Nerodim√´, ≈†timlje, and others, with Prizren and Pristina retaining their status as political, economic and cultural hubs. Under the Ottoman Empire In the 1455 census conducted by the Turkish authorities in the province of Brankovic most villages belonging to the municipality of Ferizaj, then belonging to the province of Morava, 646 villages of this province villages of Ferizaj were larger than others. According to sources about 90% of the population were of Slavic origin, 10% Albanians, Vlachs, Greeks, and Bulgarians. Agriculture was the basic source of income in these villages, including other associated activities like crafts rural economy where distinguish: blacksmiths, potter, masters of lime, furrier, ranchers, and priests and monks. After the Austrian- Turkish wars of the late 17th century and the first half of the 18th century, major ethnic changes occur and begins the rapid Islamization from Ottoman Empire. Until the construction of the railway Skopje-Mitrovica, according to Turkish sources we do not find residence called Feriz-Bey (Ferizaj). At the beginning it was called \\"Tasjon\\" by surrounding villagers by the Turkish pronunciation of French word \\"Station\\", but the name Ferizaj is obtained by Mr. Feriz Shasivari. Ferizaj's rapid development starts with construction of the railway station and within a short period become the city with inns, warehouses, and permanent market. Traffic, traders of Kosovo Prizren -Shkod√´r which at that time was by caravan, was mainly diverted toward Thessaloniki. Exporting raw materials especially that of cereals went through Ferizaj and through aligned foreign goods turnover came from Thessaloniki and Skopje. This was the reason that Ferizaj for a period of thirty years become the city with about 400 houses and 200 shops. Most of the population work in trade, crafts and other activities related to trade. During this period, the opening of the colonial shops, craft workshops so accelerated development of the city enough that some passengers of the 20th century describing how the city at that time resembled and at that time the city had more stores than houses. Ferizaj regarded as a center of important historic events that brought revolution of Young Turks and removing the dispensation of Abdul Hamid II. As in other countries and in Kosovo and Ferizaj, are formed committees of Young Turks, majority led by Albanian officer. Even in the coming years Ferizaj continues to be the center of events. In July 1908 in Ferizaj Albanians demonstrate against big powers initially against Austria, Young Turks use this opportunity to direct demonstration against Sultan sending a telegram on behalf the Kosovo leaders calling for the restoration of the constitutional order the Sultan dispensation of Abdul Hamid II this also shows the arrival in power of Young Turks. That same year began fighting between the Albanian insurgents and the Turkish army. While during 1909 in all cities of Kosovo including Ferizaj, the Albanian secret committees formed for preparation of the uprising. In 1912 Albanian the insurgent forces, in general Balkans uprising took over leadership Pristina and other cities including Ferizaj. In Ferizaj focus bulk of Albanian forces led by Idriz Seferi, Isa Boletini and in order to put pressure on Skopje and when negotiations did not result positive Albanian forces on August 12 from Pristina and Ferizaj took over the leadership of Skopje through which reached the culmination of the Albanian uprising causing the decline of government forces in Ottoman Empire and came to send a delegation to negotiate with the other leaders of the uprising. Besides the rapid economic development and urban development in Ferizaj education and schools were not developed. The oldest school was Nerodime school. As in other cities in Ferizaj funds established church, after Young Turks revolution 1910‚Äì1912 period here established society of Kestrels. From the years 1913‚Äì1915 all schools of Kosovo involved in the Serbian school system. =The founding of the city= The founding of the city of Ferizaj came as a result of the construction of the railway line Mitrovica-Skopje that was completed in 1973. Construction of this railway was financed by Turkey, while the design and execution of works were made from the French, for that reason until recently the railway was called by the residents of Ferizaj \\"Udha e Frengut\\" (The French Way). In the same year the city has received the denomination that is today, so Ferizaj. City designation is based on the first caravanserai in the township Feriz Shasivari, in which has been operating for several decades and served mainly for accommodation of merchants. The exact location of this han that played a role in the naming of the city is not known precisely. Ferizaj is a rare case how a city was established on the basis of the construction of the railways. The development of the city had been on both sides of the railway, and the railway has played and plays a vital role in the lives of the citizens of Ferizaj. Balkan War and the establishment of the Serbian kingdom After forming of Great Powers blocks- Antanta and The Central Powers block, the process of formation of which ended in the first decade of the 20th century, in Europe interstate relations soured even more. Balkans was also influenced from this situation. The ruling circles of Serbia, Greece and Montenegro which shared the same interests for the different parts of Macedonia, Albania and Kosovo, created alliances between them to fight against the common enemy- the Ottoman Empire. The defeat in the Italian- Turkish war of 1911 and the domestic crises of the Ottoman Empire, were a greater motivation for the Balkan states to expedite preparations for the attack against Turkey. Negotiations for a treaty between Serbia and Bulgaria began since 1889 while in 1912 the treaty of alliance Serbian-Bulgarian was settled, which in its secret compliances predicted the partition of lands which would be occupied. With this treaty was decided that the lands in north and west of the ≈†ar Mountains (Kosovo Vilayet and Sanjak of Novi Pazar) would take Serbia whereas Bulgaria would take the eastern areas of Rhodope Mountains and Struma river. While provinces of middle Macedonia lying between ≈†ar and Rhodope mountains, the Aegean Sea and Ohrid Lake, if not formed an autonomous province, will then e divided between Serbia and Bulgaria. In late September the Balkan League was complemented with other members: Montenegro and Greece. From which Montenegro started the first war on October 9, 1912, then Serbia on October 17, to continue with Bulgaria and Greece, doing so to begin the first Balkan War. For Operations on Kosovo, respectively Ferizaj, was appointed The Third Army of Serbian Army under the command of general Bo≈æidar Jankoviƒá. Grouping of forces and supply of ammunition, food and people became in Pristina, when the night of 23/24 October the order from The Army lll of Serbian Army was given to march towards Skopje and Kumanovo. This insight was decided to be in two columns where Ferizaj was named in the column of the right, composed of: Division of Morava Call II and cavalry of the army, which was tasked to conduct permeation in Lipljan-Ferizaj-Ka√ßanik towards Skopje, on condition that the Army cavalry arrives on Oct.24 to Varosh village near Ferizaj, while Morava Division call I in Ferizaj's region. After a brief fight Lipljan was taken. From there on Oct. 24 the vanguard cavalry left to Ferizaj. Upon entering the city, the Diversion of vanguard occupied the key places such as the post, municipal building, railway station and army barracks. In the beginning the situation in the city and the surrounding was quiet but soon begins to change, breaks, especially when in Ferizaj came the main part of the Serbian army cavalry. To the city depart Turkish army units with artillery and organized groups of armed Albanians. The eskardon vanguard that was stationed in the northern hill of Ferizaj was attacked. After this attack, the commander of the Morava Division Call II, second regiment commanded by vanguard to accelerate the march toward the city. In the same manner was ordered main part of the Morava Division to accelerate towards the Jerli Prelez village and Sazli village. Morava Division on Oct. 24 arrived in the eastern part of the Lloshkobare village, where on Oct. 25 the bitter fighting between the Serbian army, Turkish forces and Albanian forces took place. Third Battalion of the middle column occupied the southern edge of the city and released the cavalry surrounded a day earlier in the city. =The resistance of Albanian population 1912‚Äì1915= Old picture of Ferizaj During this time the municipal governing bodies were composed of Mayor, the village leader and officer. Communities of cities formed the Municipal Council. Governing bodies and the court were appointed for one year. The competence of the Municipal Court was the same as in Serbia but conditional that judgements to address the police power. According to the newspaper Srpske Novine on 17 October 1912 was formed District of Ferizaj as administrative-territorial unit that was part of the district of Pristina.Srpske novine The proposal for such a decision was given by Milorad Ant. Vuji√ßiqi who was inspector of police, and was implemented by the Supreme Command of Vranje. According to statistics made by April 4, 1913, District of Ferizaj had 71 villages organized in 10 municipalities. Also were recorded 4897 houses (3141 Albanian, 984 Serbian and 308 Other), 32789 people (16417 women and 16372 men). While according to the leader of the Pristina District no. 3133 Dated. 8.5.1913, the number of residents in Ferizaj was 32802, while only the locality of Ferizaj had 3405 inhabitants. Besides the number of residents in this report has data on religious affiliation, where the number of inhabitants of the Serbian, Orthodox were 8694, Catholic 34, and Islamic faith were: Albanians 23454 and Roma 416. Throughout 1913 Ferizaj was recognized as the county town under Pristina, and was recognized by the name Ferizaj. By decision of the Ministerial Council of the Kingdom of Serbia on 16 January 1914, entered into force Serbian Law of 16 June 1886 for changing the names of places in Kosovo. According to this decision the name was officially changed from Ferizaj in Uro≈°evac. Also according to this decision Circle of Ferizaj was called Circle of Nerodime, that certainly came from the Nerodime river that runs mainly through this area. According to the 1914 Circle of Nerodime had 10 municipalities, 69 villages, 15 small villages, a town and 32845 inhabitants, where the town of Ferizaj numbered 3405 inhabitants. Now under this law this circle was part of the district of Kosovo. Noting that railways Ferizaj-Ka√ßanik-Skopje was a key factor for the economic development of this town, a time has been discontinued and has often been under the control of armed soldiers, we can conclude that caused the interruption of traffic, insecurity and stagnation trade. On October 24, 1912 it is known that the rail-road Skopje-Mitrovica, which had been badly damaged by the Turks, was now adjusted and will soon begin the movement of trains. After General Bo≈æidar Jankoviƒáha travelled to the first train released on November 3, the first railway station in Skopje line Ferizaj, the name was changed from Elez Han, as it was known until then, to the General Jankovic. Ferizaj in 1914, exported wheat, barley and oats. While in Ferizaj also exported corn, beans and leather. Among the crafts developed in Ferizaj 1914 were: shopkeepers, blacksmiths, tailors, hairdressers, butcher, tinsmith, watchmakers, bakers, carpenters, cart workers. During the years 1912‚Äì1915, in Ferizaj there was an entity creditor established by the fund of the church of St. Urosh and took the name Bank of Ferizaj. As a result of heavy taxes Albanian population were extremely impoverished. This led to their displacement in Turkey. Besides Turkey, the population of Ferizaj and of that time migrated to other countries, where only in America had gone about 500-600 people. During the world wars =First World War= The beginning of the First World War found Kosovo separated between Serbia and Montenegro and because both of them where involved directly from the beginning of the War and the Kosovo area was covered from the fightings. The War started on 28 July 1914 between the two opposing blocs, the bloc of Austro-Hungarian Monarchy with Bulgaria and Serbia with Montenegro bloc. The Kosovo areas that were already occupied during the Balkan Wars, part of which was Ferizaj were forced to do the collection of animals and food for the needs of the army, as well as the mobilization of the army with new Albanian recruits In October 1915 Bulgaria entered into the war and it had military developments in the Ferizaj area that was part of the main artery connecting Kumanovo and Skopje with Kosovo. New Corps Command therefore the Serbo-Montenegrin forces during this period were determined in Ferizaj. Ferizaj had served as a stopping point for the penetration from the Ka√ßanik Gorge for the Bulgarians. But the Serb resistance ended on 25 November 1915 when it was conquered by the Bulgarian Army, which was facilitated by Albanians in hopes that the situation will change and the hard situation will be over. On 1 April 1916 Ferizaj was left Bulgaria as a station key, but the possibility of using the railway was given in use also to the Austro - Hungarian command for the railway line Prizren - Ferizaj - Albania. One of the first actions that the Bulgarian government had made was the registration of the male residents from age 16 to 60 years who will mobilize the Bulgarian army and will work on building the railway Gostivar - Kicevo, in which worked 63 people from Ferizaj. During this period there was only one Albanian private school that was allowed by the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, which was in a Catholic church near Ferizaj, and had about 50 pupils and teacher was a Catholic priest. And to open other Albanian schools in this period was not allowed. So this period of Bulgarian occupation that lasted three years, brought very bad occurrences for the residents of Ferizaj, like kills, damage to private property, rape, etc. The difficult situation and poverty brought also starvation to the residents, as recorded by the head of District Ferizaj. During this period, many settlements were added Bulgarian suffixes - ov, - ev, and -ova. Based on this they named Ferizaj as Ferizovo. In September 1918 the decline was seen in Bulgaria, as well as taking Skopje from French and Serbian army was crucial for Bulgaria's capitulation. The French and Serbian army broke through the gorge of Ka√ßanik on October 4, 1918 and on October 5, 1918 the town of Ferizaj was put back under the rule of the Kingdom of Serbia. =Interwar period= In late October 1918 the French army and Serbian representatives arrived in the town to establish Serbian control. Serbian government was established on 31 October 1918 and Ferizaj was appointed temporarily under the Deputy Prefect of the Nerodimlje District. In 1920 it was established as an administrative division under this division Nerodimlje had 10 municipalities with 73 villages and 32,845 inhabitants. According to the 1921 census there were 22,401 Albanians (Muslims) and 7,834 Serbs in the District. The District of Nerodimlje in 1921 was distributed in the following municipalities, with number of inhabitants: Babu≈° (4,828), Gatnje (2,883), Gotovu≈°a (2,652), Kosin (2,218), Nerodimlje (4,129), Talinovac (1,793), ≈†timlje (5,269), ≈†trpce (4.551), Ferizoviƒá/Uro≈°evac (3.529). The district of Nerodimlje as such was active until the beginning of World War II. During this period the Kingdom of Serbia undertook actions to disarm the population, leading to many residents moving to Albania and Turkey. One of the government actions was the \\"Land Reform\\" that had quite negative consequences for the Albanians, in the region of Ferizaj this colonizing lasted from 1918 to 1941, but not as intensely as in other areas. Includes areas that were Agrarian Reform in the District of Nerodime were mostly marginal lands, which has been sufficient in the Municipality of Talinofcit, Kosines, Babush, Shtimje and its vicinity town of Ferizaj. Between the two world wars took place quite trade, all goods mainly cereals coming from most cities of that imported Kosovo in Skopje and Thessaloniki went through Ferizaj and also reciprocally, at this time Ferizaj numbered 117 trade importer. Before the start of Second World War was formed the first labor organization in Ferizaj, which came as a result of the development of several small industries and factories in Ferizaj. Important role played also the banking institutions, Bank of Ferizaj first fund was established by the Church of Saint Uroshit (1909) in 1919 and that work until the beginning of the Second World War. In the field of education and culture Ferizaj had great stagnation in this period, according to 1937 evidence the District of Nerodime had 23 schools (elementary, class 1-4), which teachings followed 3,063 students. Standoff in education had especially the Albanians. because the learnings took place only in Serbian language and the Albanian children did not know the Serbian language, so illiteracy amounted to 90%. An important role in the education of the Albanian residents played the Madrasa - Muslim religious school, the data shows that in 1931 there were 51 Albanian pupils who attend this school, the teaching process was in Albanian language and the teacher was Hasan Efendi Nahi and this school functioned until the beginning of Second World War. =Second World War= The early period of the Second World War had a positive impact for residents of Ferizaj for not realizing the Convention of 1938, which was signed between Yugoslavia and Turkey for the resettlement of Albanians in Turkey, and that included the massive resettlement of the residents of the District of Nerodime. Under this convention, this migration was to be realized in the period from 1939 until 1944. But the attack led of Italy to Albania that it had not been realized. With the invasion of Albanian lands by Italians and Germans, the Italian troops were deployed in Ferizaj, because it was found an auxiliary army airport of the Kingdom of Serbia, which served for descenting for the Italian military aircraft. In comparison with other territories that were occupied by the Germans and Bulgarians, the territories that were occupied by Italians the economic situation of residents was more favorable, because Italians also encouraged further development of trade. This economic development led many trade from Gjakova, Prizren, Peƒá and from other areas to take place in Ferizaj, as it was developed and a key point for trade in this period. In early 1941, the Communist Party's leading bodies of Ferizaj were committed that the more residents to join the National Liberation Movement, the end of this year in Ferizaj were already established groups of illegal armed before. With the capitulation of Italy, the country was occupied by Germany, where the behavior of the German occupation was favorable in comparison with the Italians against the Albanian population. Even after the German invasion the National Liberation Movement was strengthened even further to 1943 when the arrest and deportation of all participants began. This movement resulted in the liberation of the country and eventually came to the liberation of the city on December 2, 1944. After the liberation of the city before the National Liberation Movement stood two tasks: release and protect throughout the territory and rebuild the economy of the country. The second half of the 20th century On November 17, 1944 Ferizaj was liberated, characteristics of the social-economic relations and political situation of that time were: the city had 4000 inhabitants 2/3 of these were Albanian, who dealt mainly with trade, craft and agriculture and despite of this production was low. National Liberation Council from illegal became legal with liberation of the city, with 17 members, with Isa Sadriu as mayor and secretary Shuqe Avdijeviq on top. The National Council of the liberation of the district held on 11.12.1944 at meeting to the people was declared legal by 32 members and 7 stations. It was led by Hivzi Sylejman on top of the board while Valkovic Spira was secretary. At the same time military units were formed: The Command of country 18.11.1944 and immediately the command of the regions military which included National Liberation Council in Nerodime districts, the Ka√ßanik, Vitina, Gjilan and Kamenica. During the 1945 The Federal temporary assembly issued a law on agrarian reform and colonization, and in the second half of this year was implemented agrarian reform, was confiscated all land owners who did not deal with agriculture, was established the fund of land, where a part of them were handed to landless peasants, a part was returned to previous owners and the surplus joined the social agricultural sector formed at the time. Such a land of this nature turned to the Ferizaj municipality too. =The period of reconstruction= After the liberation of this region began immediately reconstruction of war-damaged economy. After the city bombing on 7 April 1941 except material damages were also victims, on the occasion of withdrawal by 16 November 1944 the enemy destroyed all communication lines connecting Ferizaj with other cities, as well as the building of the railway station, many tunnels and bridges in Ferizaj-Skopje road. Road and rail traffic was rebuilt in the next three months with volunteer work brigades and population, that was of particular significance for the circulation of passengers and wares. Also work brigades were formed, battalions and specialized groups to craft workers that worked not only with important facilities but also those with federal importance. Most of the youth were able of living by learning various crafts and professions. =Construction period= In the city of Ferizaj were also built industrial buildings. Along with their construction was formed the working class composed on the few number of mainly of craft workers. Also in this period were voluntarily built homes of cooperatives as centers in which except agricultural works were developed cultural, entertainment, and politics. Positive results are shown in eradicating illiteracy and expansion of the primary schools in which for the first time was developed education in Albanian language. Thus began to develop intensively entertaining and cultural life, the commitment of the party and popular government for the emancipation of Albanian nationality women, from attempted to be equal members of the socialist community. The construction and reconstruction of the country and fight for the realization of the five-year plan were followed by more material difficulties, political and economic pressures, from Eastern countries. = Society and self-governance of workers= In 1951 begin the self-governance of workers. During the years 1950‚Äì1951 were formed first workers councils of oil factory, combine wood, in enterprise of brick and tile, in commercial enterprise \\"November 17\\" and in the agricultural cooperative, where with their establishment was added interest of working class to the manufacturing. In 1953, constitutional law sanctioned situation and principles of self-government and created process of instituting social sphere, with this case were formed social government bodies in economic school, in all primary schools, health facilities, administration, bodies of jurisprudence, was given a special place to the worker class. In the Municipality of Ferizaj also for the first time in the election were elected members of the municipal chamber. In 1960‚Äì1966 years joined most of ≈†timlje and municipality of ≈†trpce to the territory of this municipality. Constitutional elections not only enabled the implementation of decentralization of power from the federation to the municipality, but the working class was possible to decide on expanded reproduction. Kosovo War (1998‚Äì99) Camp bondsteel Kosovo In 1999, during the war, the city of Ferizaj suffered extensive damage by the Serbian army that shelled and burned Albanian-populated neighborhoods. In March 1999 a large number of children were poisoned in schools, including some university students; around 7000‚Äì9000 were poisoned, some being residents of Ferizaj. After the war, the city of Ferizaj has had serious inter-ethnic trouble which has resulted in almost all of the rest of the Serbs and non-Albanian residents leave the city. Camp Bondsteel played an important role in the economy of the city of Ferizaj. The camp was established immediately after the war. The camp is quite large: 955 acres or 360,000 square meters. Bondsteel is located on rolling hills and farmland near the city of Ferizaj.

The ruins of the old parish church lie near the coastal village of Liscannor, which is also a part of the parish. Geography Liscannor Castle Kilmacrehy is part of the historical Barony of Corcomroe. It is about to the west of Ennistymon. It is on the north shore of Liscannor Bay on the western coast of Clare. The parish makes up the peninsula that extends to the basaltic promontory called Hag's Head.

Dough townland is the only part of the parish that lies on the south bank of the estuary of the Inagh River. The parish once had the alias of Quoranna, meaning \\"the distinct projection\\", an allusion to the imposing cliffs. An 1837 account says that the parish contained , as applotted under the tithe act, including pasture and arable land fertilized with seaweed. An 1845 account gives the parish a total area of , and dimensions of about . Today, part of the town of Lahinch is located in the townland of Dough. Townlands The parish includes the townlands of Ardnacraa, Ardnahea, Ballycotteen North, Ballycotteen South, Ballyea, Ballyheean, Ballyherragh, Ballylaan, Ballymaclinaun, Ballynalackan, Ballysteen, Ballyvorda, Ballyvrislaun, Beaghy, Caherbarnagh, Caherycahill, Cloghaundine, Derreen, Dough, Kilconnell, Kineilty, Laghcloon, Laghvally, Liscannor, Lislorkan North, Lislorkan South, Rannagh, Shingaunagh North, Shingaunagh South, Slievenageeragh and Teeraghbeg. History The parish is possibly named after Saint Mac Creiche, who according to tradition founded several churches in what is now County Clare. He may not have been a historical figure, however. The parish church of Kilmacrehy is the only one that bears his name. Some rocks out in the bay before the strand are called MacCreiche's Bed, and about to the northwest is MacCreiche's Well. In 1588 some ships of the Spanish Armada were wrecked on the shore. As of 1831 the parish's population was 3,343. By 1841 it was 4,264 in 673 houses. Antiquities The ruins of the old parish church in Laghcloon townland east of Liscannor include several fine specimens of arches and moldings in its walls. Despite the alleged early Christian roots, written documentation only goes back to the 14th century. Most of the ornamentation that survives today dates to much later. The nave features a holy water font, a window and a broken bell chamber on the west wall. A high semi-Gothic arch divides the nave from the chancel, which may be a later addition to the church. A recess in the north wall reportedly served as a tomb like a similar structure in Kilfenora Cathedral. A prominent hood is crowned by a mitred head. A recess in the south wall may have once been a window with two Gothic arches topped by a carved head wearing a flat cap. It was reconstructed in a drawing by Thomas Johnson Westropp. Aodh Bu√≠ Mac Cruit√≠n was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard. The parish also holds two ruined castles: Dough and Liscannor. Ecclesiastical parishes There is a holy well near Birchfield dedicated to Saint Bridget. The devotees and people looking for the cure of illness would visit the well on the eve of the first Sunday of August. In 1834 there were 3,571 Roman Catholics and 24 Protestants. As of 1837 the parish was part of the Catholic district of Liscanor, which also includes the parish of Killaspuglenane. From 1779 the Church of Ireland vicarage of Kilmacrehy was part of the archdeaconry of Kilfenora, which also included the vicarages of Kilmanaheen, Kilaspughenane, Killeilagh and Kilmoon, and after 1785 included the rectories of Carrune and Killeilagh.

The book (and Edward Skidelsky's writing generally) looks into the idea of the good life and how capitalism may have been the key to it, but we have now lost sense of the good life as a priority. The solutions offered to this problem are to \\"curb insatiability\\" and to consider a form of basic income for society.

Reports  At about 9:30 on the night of April 25, 1973, Henry McDaniel heard a scratching sound at his front door. He looked out, and saw something that he thought might be a bear. Taking a gun and flashlight, he headed outside into a strong wind and saw a creature between two rosebushes. He later said \\"It had three legs on it, a short body, two little short arms, and two pink eyes as big as flashlights. It stood four and a half feet tall and was grayish-colored.\\" He added later that it was \\"almost like a human body\\". McDaniel fired four shots at the creature, one shot hitting it and causing it to make a hiss \\"much like a wildcat's\\", before fleeing towards a nearby railway embankment, covering 50 feet in three jumps. McDaniel called the local authorities who discovered footprints in the soft earth near the house, which McDaniel described as dog-like in shape, with six toe pads. The police considered McDaniel to be \\"rational and sober\\" in his reporting of the incident. In a later press interview, McDaniel said \\"If they do find it, they will find more than one and they won't be from this planet, I can tell you that.\\" Investigators interviewing nearby residents were told that Greg Garrett, a ten-year-old neighbor of McDaniel, claimed to have encountered the creature half an hour before McDaniel did, and that the creature had stepped on his feet, tearing his tennis shoes to shreds. The boy later told Western Illinois University researchers that his report was a hoax \\"to tease Mr. M and have fun with an out of town newsman.\\" Two weeks later on May 6, McDaniel called the radio station WWKI claiming to have seen the creature again, at 3am that morning. It was negotiating the trestles of the railroad tracks near his home, and McDaniel said \\"I saw something moving out on the railroad track and there it stood. I didn't shoot at it or anything. It started on down the railroad track. It wasn't in a hurry or anything.\\" A search party including WWKI's news director Rick Rainbow explored the area later that day, and reported observing an \\"apelike\\" creature standing in an abandoned building near McDaniel's house. They claimed to have made a recording of the creature's cries, and fired a shot at it before it fled. Cryptozoologist Loren Coleman investigated the case and the sound recording. Two days later, a day after McDaniel was interviewed on local radio, the local press reported that police were called to investigate reports of gunfire, and arrested five young men from out of town who had come to Enfield in order to photograph the creature, carrying shotguns and rifles \\"for protection\\", the men having claimed to have sighted the creature. The White County sheriff dismissed reports of this as a \\"monster hunting expedition\\" as an exaggeration, saying that the men were just \\"out drinking and raising hell\\", mentioning the monster only briefly during questioning. The men were charged with hunting violations.  Reactions  The incidents were reported widely in the press at the time ‚Äì it appeared in newspapers throughout the state on 27 April 1973, and on 7 May there was an interview on radio station WGN, Chicago and articles in the Chicago Daily News, the Moline Dispatch, Champaign-Urbana Courier and the Alton Telegraph. There were earlier articles in the Carmi Times, and an updated summary of the events appeared in Pennsylvania's Reading Eagle in August 1973. After the arrest of the five men who had arrived to hunt the creature, residents of Enfield expressed fears that press coverage would lead to further \\"monster hunters\\", who might inadvertently shoot citizens or livestock. It was suggested that the creature may have been a kangaroo escaped from a nearby zoo, which would explain the \\"three legs\\" description as the tails of kangaroos look like a third leg. McDaniel was adamant that the creature \\"wasn't no kangaroo\\", having owned such a creature as a pet while on military service in Australia, and noting that kangaroos have narrow faces and tracks that leave claw marks. Following media coverage of the creature, an Ohio man contacted a local newspaper stating that the creature may have been his pet kangaroo, Macey, which had been lost or stolen a year previously. A few days after the event, United Press International quoted an anthropology student who suggested that the creature may have been a wild ape, noting that such animals had been reported throughout the Mississippi area since 1941.  University study  In 1978, researchers at Western Illinois University headed by David L. Miller investigated and analyzed the incident, publishing it as a case study in social contagion. The researchers found there were no more than three firsthand reports that had subsequently been exaggerated by news stories and local gossip into an \\"epidemic.\\" According to the study: > In this area of Southern Illinois, it is not unreasonable to assume Mr. M or > the radio news team had actually seen an animal. People we interviewed > framed the recent events in these terms. Their accounts admitted the > possibility that large dogs, calves, bears, deer, and wildcats had been > sighted. Some frames suggested that an exotic pet, such as an ape or a > kangaroo, was the catalyst for the monster reports. Finally, some people > tactfully suggested that Mr. M. had a notoriously overactive imagination and > had probably been shooting at shadows.

Neihsial traditional attire pattern The Neihsial is an ethnic group found in northeastern India.and parts of Myanmar. Members of this group are largely concentrated in the Churachandpur, Senapati, Chandel District and Tamenglong district of the Indian state of Manipur. There is also a sizable population in the neighboring Chin State of Myanmar. The Neihsial speak a Tibeto-Burman language which is unique and different from the Vaiphei and Gangte tribal dialects. Some of the Neihsial are scattered among the Vaiphei, Gangte, Paite and Thadou tribes in India, where as a large number of significant proportion speak the Neihsial dialect and followed its traditions. The word Neihsial is being spell in various variations such as Neihsiel and Neihsel due to others dialects and literature influences.Neihsial, Mung, \\"Neihsial\\", p.1 Currently, the Neihsial are not recognized as a tribe in India. Instead, the Neihsial are classified under the nomenclature ZOUMI and KUKI The Neihsial practice a subsistence form of agriculture, Jhum or slash-and-burn cultivation. Origin The meaning associated behind the word ‚ÄúNeihsial‚Äù is a combination of the words: 'neih' means to have/possess or owned and 'sial' means mithun(name of animal) or to boast . Scholars believe that the name was derived from the phrase \\"Owner of many mithun\\" or ‚Äúboasting of wealth.‚Äù.Pa Gho Khan Dal, Guite Khang Thu, Kalemyo, April,1986, p.15 As is the case with other neighboring tribes, the genesis of Neihsial cannot be effectively traced and produced, due to the lack of written historical evidence. However, mentions were made by many other researchers of which mention be made by the Lotjem clan of the Thadou speaking tribe describing the Neihsial Pa (pa stand as father/man) as \\"Sakhaupi Kuohpa\\" which means a man with a big pouch. Through the local traditions and oral traditions it was known that the cruelties and hardships their ancestor suffered in the Kale-Chindwinvalley at the hands of the Kawls (Burmans) were so severe that it led to the first wave of migration straight into the Arakans in about the year A.D. 1,000. The second wave moved over to the Chin hills during A.D. 1200‚Äì1400 taking shelter in whatever shelter was available‚Äîtick woods, crests of rocks and even caves, and they referred to one such big cave where they took shelter known as khuul.Dr. Neihsial Tualchin, ‚ÄúThe Origin and Early History of the Zoumis from Kawlzang Settlement to Occupation of Chin Hills‚Äù, p. 5 The Neihsial tribe is a composition of \\"bawngthum\\" meaning three groups of clans namely The Nunthuk clans, The Tungling Clans and the Haulai clans. The Nunthuk group consist of the Nunthuk clans, Thaanhing clans, Thukneel clans, Thaanvuum clans, Thuklai clans and Chiljaang clans. The Tungling group consist of the Tungling clan, Singtou clan, Singbul clan, Singlul clan, Daalvung clan, Santou clan, Timtong clan, Tuolkhen clan, Dolbak clan, Banlawng clan, Aikhoh clan, Khuptong clans - Kipging clan, Ngaithuom clan, Bawngmei clan, Lamthang clan, Sumai clan and Bianpi clan. The Haulai group consist of Haulai clans- Kimdeih clan, Chonmang clan, Ngalkip clan, Lengen clan and Thahgen clan with two more undiscovered clans from Haulai sept. The Neihsial people wander among the other tribes (Thadou, Paite, Vaiphei, Gangte, Hmar, Mizo, Zou etc.) after the destruction of the Sialgam (Sialthah-tuithang gam), consisting of the two capitals Sialthah Kulhpi and Tuithang Kulhpi. The region under the Sialthah Kulhpi was called Sialthahgam and the region under Tuithang Kulhpi was called Tuithanggam. The Neihsial people speak a unique language called Neihsial Pau. Neihsial people living in and around Churachandpur District and Tamenglong District of Manipur still use Neihsial Pau. Religion The traditional religion of the Neihsial ( i.e VOKPI DAWI ) is a combination of ancestor worship and animism. The Neihsial believed in the existence of a supreme deity whom they called ‚ÄúPathian‚Äù. Besides Pathian, the Neihsial revered and feared a number of supernatural beings. Sacrifices of fowls, pigs, dogs and goats were made to appease the deities. The important traditional festivals of the Neihsial include Sa-ai, Gallu-ai and Lawmzu nek. Above all the Neihsial tribe practice \\"VOKPI DAWI LAAM\\" Which is the supreme of all their traditional religious dance.Dr. Neihsial, Tualchin: History and Culture of the Zomi, 1993 The most important and unique festival of the Neihsial tribe was \\"SIAL-KUT\\". This very SIAL-KUT is unique and is famous for its role in the socio-religious life of the people.During the late 19th and early 20th centuries,Fuchs Stephen: The Aboriginal tribes of India, 1982, pp. 10‚Äì25foreign missionaries, mostly from the Western world, converted many Neihsials to Christianity.Lewis G.R: The Story of Lushai Pioneer Mission, 1907, pp. 11‚Äì77 They began to abandoned the traditional believes and faiths and discarded all kinds of traditional religions and worships. By the 20th century, the Neihsial Christian Association (NCA) was formed on May 11, 1989, at Neihsial Veng, Lamka, Churachandpur, Manipur. At its young stage, they were under the Manipur Christian Organization (MCO). After some years they formed alignment with the Wesleyan Methodist Church for about seven years. After parting from Methodist Church they reorganize NCA and function independently till these day. The denominational headquarters of NCA is at Neihsial Veng itself. They believe in trinity: the father, the son and the Holy Spirit. The NCA is headed by one executive secretary, who is assisted by clerk and choukider. There is an executive committee to deal with any important matters concerning with the institution.Neihsial, Mung, Op. Cit., p. 6Tinneinieng, ‚ÄúA Brief Ethnographic Study of the Neihsials‚Äù, 2004, p. 44 Moral values of the Neihsial The Neihsial society is patriarchal. It is patrilineal and patrilocal with a focus on the extended family. In the Neihsial society, it is a traditional practice that husband and wife never use each other's proper names as a sign of respect. Children also never use their parents' names. The parents are addressed as \\"Pa\\" (father) and \\"Nu\\" (Mother). The father and mother of another family are addressed by elders in the name of their eldest child, preceded by \\"Pa\\" or \\"Nu\\".

To be a climate-friendly gardener means considering both what happens in a garden and the materials brought into it and the impact they have on land use and climate. It can also include garden features or activities in the garden that help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere. Orchard garden showing orchard trees, herbaceous perennials and ground-cover plants, at Hergest Croft Gardens, Herefordshire, Britain.  Land use and greenhouse gases  Most of the excess greenhouse gases causing climate change have come from burning fossil fuel. But a special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that in the last 150 years fossil fuels and cement production were responsible for only about two-thirds of climate change: the other third has been caused by human land use. The three main greenhouse gases produced by unsustainable land use are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Black carbon or soot can also be caused by unsustainable land use, and, although not a gas, can behave like greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change. = Carbon dioxide = Carbon dioxide, , is a natural part of the carbon cycle, but human land uses often add more, especially from habitat destruction and the cultivation of soil. When woodlands, wetlands, and other natural habitats are turned into pasture, arable fields, buildings and roads, the carbon held in the soil and vegetation becomes extra carbon dioxide and methane to trap more heat in the atmosphere. Gardeners may cause extra carbon dioxide to be added to the atmosphere in several ways: * Using peat or potting compost containing peat; * Buying garden furniture or other wooden products made from woodland which has been destroyed rather than taken as a renewable crop from sustainably managed woodland; * Digging soil and leaving it bare so that the carbon in soil organic matter is oxidised; * Using power tools which burn fossil fuel or electricity generated by burning fossil fuel; * Using patio heaters; * Heating greenhouses by burning fossil fuel or electricity generated by burning fossil fuel; * Burning garden prunings and weeds on a bonfire; * Buying tools, pesticides, synthetic nitrogen fertilizers (over 2 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent is produced in the manufacture of each kilogram of ammonium nitrate), and other materials which have been manufactured using fossil fuel; * Heating and treating swimming pools by burning fossil fuel or electricity generated by burning fossil fuel; * Watering their gardens with tapwater, which has been treated and pumped by burning fossil fuel, with a greenhouse gas impact of about 1 kg CO2e/m3 water. Gardeners will also be responsible for extra carbon dioxide when they buy garden products which have been transported by vehicles powered by fossil fuel. = Methane = Methane, CH4, is a natural part of the carbon cycle, but human land uses often add more, especially from anaerobic soil, artificial wetlands such as rice fields, and from the guts of farm animals, especially ruminants such as cattle and sheep. Gardeners may cause extra methane to be added to the atmosphere in several ways: * Compacting soil so that it becomes anaerobic, for example by treading on soil when it is wet; * Allowing compost heaps to become compacted and anaerobic; * Creating homemade liquid feed by putting the leaves of plants such as comfrey under water, with the unintended consequence that the plants may release methane as they decay; * Killing pernicious weeds by covering them with water, with the unintended consequence that the plants may release methane as they decay; * Allowing ponds to become anaerobic, for example by adding unsuitable fish species which stir up sediment that then blocks light from and kills submerged oxygenating plants. = Nitrous oxide = Nitrous oxide, N2O, is a natural part of the nitrogen cycle, but human land uses often add more. Gardeners may cause extra nitrous oxide to be added to the atmosphere by: * Using synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, for example \\"weed and feed\\" on lawns, especially if it is applied when plants are not actively growing, the soil is compacted, or when other factors are limiting so that the plants cannot make use of the nitrogen; * Compacting the soil (for example by working in the garden when the soil is wet) which will increase the conversion of nitrates to nitrous oxide by soil bacteria; * Burning garden waste on bonfires. = Black carbon = Black carbon is not a gas, but it acts like a greenhouse gas because it can be suspended in the atmosphere and absorb heat. Gardeners may cause extra black carbon to be added to the atmosphere by burning garden prunings and weeds on bonfires, especially if the waste is wet and becomes black carbon in the form of soot. Gardeners will also be responsible for extra black carbon produced when they buy garden products which have been transported by vehicles powered by fossil fuel especially the diesel used in most lorries.  Gardening to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and absorb carbon dioxide  There are many ways in which climate-friendly gardeners may reduce their contribution to climate change and help their gardens absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Climate-friendly gardeners can find good ideas in many other sustainable approaches: * Agroforestry; * Forest gardening; * Orchards; * Organic gardening; * Permaculture; * Rain garden; * Vegan organic gardening; * Water-wise gardening; * Wildlife garden.  Protecting and enhancing carbon stores  = Protecting carbon stores in land beyond gardens = Woodland and wetland in the New Forest, Hampshire Woodland and trees in Herefordshire Kitchen garden at Charles Darwin's home, Down House, Kent, showing greenhouse, waterbutt, box hedging and vegetable beds. Alliums, lavender, box and other water-thrifty plants in the dry garden at Cambridge Botanic Garden Climate-friendly gardening includes actions which protect carbon stores beyond gardens. The biggest carbon stores in land are in soil; the two habitat types with the biggest carbon stores per hectare are woods and wetlands; and woods absorb more carbon dioxide per hectare per year than most other habitats. Climate- friendly gardeners therefore aim to ensure that nothing they do will harm these habitats. According to Morison and Morecroft (eds.)'s Plant Growth and Climate Change, the net primary productivity (the net amount of carbon absorbed each year) of various habitats is: * Tropical forests: 12.5 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year; * Temperate forests: 7.7 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year; * Temperate grasslands: 3.7 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year; * Croplands: 3.1 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Special Report Land use, land-use change, and forestry lists the carbon contained in different global habitats as: * Wetlands: 643 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil \\\\+ 43 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation = total 686 tonnes carbon per hectare; * Tropical forests: 123 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil \\\\+ 120 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation = total 243 tonnes carbon per hectare; * Temperate forests: 96 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil \\\\+ 57 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation = total 153 tonnes carbon per hectare; * Temperate grasslands: 164 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil \\\\+ 7 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation = total 171 tonnes carbon per hectare; * Croplands: 80 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil \\\\+ 2 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation = total 82 tonnes carbon per hectare. The figures quoted above are global averages. More recent research in 2009 has found that the habitat with the world's highest known total carbon density \\\\- 1,867 tonnes of carbon per hectare \\\\- is temperate moist forest of Eucalyptus regnans in the Central Highlands of south-east Australia; and, in general, that temperate forests contain more carbon than either boreal forests or tropical forests. =Carbon stores in Britain= According to Milne and Brown's 1997 paper \\"Carbon in the vegetation and soils of Great Britain\\", Britain's vegetation and soil are estimated to contain 9952 million tonnes of carbon, of which almost all is in the soil, and most in Scottish peatland soil: * Soils in Scotland: 6948 million tonnes carbon; * Soils in England and Wales: 2890 million tonnes carbon; * Vegetation in British woods and plantations (which cover only 11% of Britain's land area): 91 million tonnes carbon; * Other vegetation: 23 million tonnes carbon. A 2005 report suggested that British woodland soil may contain as much as 250 tonnes of carbon per hectare. Many studies of soil carbon only study the carbon in the top 30 centimetres, but soil is often much deeper than that, especially below woodland. One 2009 study of the United Kingdom's carbon stores by Keith Dyson and others gives figures for soil carbon down to 100 cm below the habitats, including \\"Forestland\\", \\"Cropland\\" and \\"Grassland\\", covered by the Kyoto Protocol reporting requirements. * Forestland soils: average figures in tonnes carbon per hectare are 160 (England), 428 (Scotland), 203 (Wales), and 366 (Northern Ireland). * Grassland soils: average figures in tonnes carbon per hectare are 148 (England), 386 (Scotland), 171 (Wales), and 304 (Northern Ireland). * Cropland soils: average figures in tonnes carbon per hectare are 110 (England), 159 (Scotland), 108 (Wales), and 222 (Northern Ireland). =Protecting carbon stores in wetland= Permeable paving of wood chip with birch-log edging at the Royal Horticultural Society garden at Wisley A ground-cover and rain-garden plant - Symphytum grandiflorum, creeping comfrey (with Cotinus coggygria) Climate-friendly gardeners choose peat-free composts because some of the planet's biggest carbon stores are in soil, and especially in the peatland soil of wetlands. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Special Report Land Use, Land- Use Change and Forestry gives a figure of 2011 gigatonnes of carbon for global carbon stocks in the top 1 metre of soils, much more than the carbon stores in the vegetation or the atmosphere. Climate-friendly gardeners also avoid using tapwater not only because of the greenhouse gases emitted when fossil fuels are burnt to treat and pump water, but because if water is taken from wetlands then carbon stores are more likely to be oxidised to carbon dioxide. A climate-friendly garden therefore does not contain large irrigated lawns, but instead includes water-butts to collect rainwater; water-thrifty plants which survive on rainwater and do not need watering after they are established; trees, shrubs and hedges to shelter gardens from the drying effects of sun and wind; and groundcover plants and organic mulch to protect the soil and keep it moist.p. 242p. 80‚Äì82 Climate-friendly gardeners will ensure that any paved surfaces in their gardens (which are kept to a minimum to increase carbon stores) are permeable, and may also make rain gardens, sunken areas into which rainwater from buildings and paving is directed, so that the rain can then be fed back into groundwater rather than going into storm drains. The plants in rain gardens must be able to grow in both dry and wet soils. =Protecting carbon stores in woodland= Wetlands may store the most carbon in their soils, but woods store more carbon in their living biomass than any other type of vegetation, and their soils store the most carbon after wetlands. Climate- friendly gardeners therefore ensure that any wooden products they buy, such as garden furniture, have been made of wood from sustainably managed woodland. = Protecting and increasing carbon stores in gardens = Juglans elaeopyren, an American walnut, at Cambridge Botanic Garden After rocks containing carbonate compounds, soil is the biggest store of carbon on land. Carbon is found in soil organic matter, including living organisms (plant roots, fungi, animals, protists, bacteria), dead organisms, and humus. One study of the environmental benefits of gardens estimates that 86% of carbon stores in gardens is in the soil. Wild strawberries in flower below a British hedge. The first priorities for climate-friendly gardeners are, therefore, to: * Protect the soil's existing carbon stores; * Increase the soil's carbon stores. To protect the soil, climate-friendly gardens: * Are based on plants rather than buildings and paving; * Have soil that is kept at a relatively stable temperature by shelter from trees, shrubs and/or hedges; * Have soil that is always kept covered and therefore moist and at a relatively stable temperature by groundcover plants, fast-growing green manures (which can be used as an intercrop in kitchen gardens of annual vegetables) and/or organic mulches. Mulch of woodchips protecting soil at the Royal Horticultural Society garden at Wisley in Surrey. Climate-friendly gardeners avoid things which may harm soil. They do not tread on the soil when it is wet, because it is then most vulnerable to compaction. They dig as little is possible, and only when the soil is moist rather than wet, because cultivation increases the oxidation of soil organic matter and produces carbon dioxide.p. 54‚Äì55 To increase soil carbon stores, climate-friendly gardeners ensure that their gardens create optimal conditions for vigorous healthy growth of plants, and other garden organisms above and below ground, and reduce the impact of any limiting factors. In general, the more biomass that the plants can create each year, the more carbon will be added to the soil.p. 54‚Äì55 However, only some biomass each year becomes long-term soil carbon or humus. In Soil Carbon and Organic Farming, a 2009 report for the Soil Association, Gundula Azeez discusses several factors which increase how much biomass is turned into humus. These include good soil structure, soil organisms such as fine root hairs, microorganisms, mycorrhizas and earthworms which increase soil aggregation, residues from plants (such as trees and shrubs) which have a high content of resistant chemicals such as lignin, and plant residues with a carbon to nitrogen ratio lower than about 32:1. Nitrogen-fixing nodules on Wisteria roots (hazelnut for scale) Climate-friendly gardens therefore include: * Hedges for shelter from wind; * A light canopy of late-leafing deciduous trees to let in enough sunlight for growth but not so much that the garden becomes too hot and dry (this is one of the principles behind many agroforestry systems, such as Paulownia's use in China partly because it is late-leafing and its canopy is sparse so that crops below it get shelter but also enough light); * Groundcover plants and organic mulches (such as woodchips over compost made from kitchen and garden \\"waste\\") to keep soil moist and at relatively stable temperatures; * Nitrogen-fixing plants, because soil nitrogen may be a limiting factor (but climate-friendly gardeners avoid synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, because these may cause mycorrhizal associations to break down); * Many layers of plants, including woody plants such as trees and shrubs, other perennials, groundcover plants, deep-rooted plants, all chosen according to 'right plant, right place', so that they are suited to their growing conditions and will grow well; * A wide diversity of disease-resistant, vigorous plants for resilience and to make the most of all available ecological niches; * Plants to feed and shelter wildlife, to increase total biomass, and to ensure biological control of pests and diseases. * Compost made from garden and kitchen \\"waste\\". Lawns, like other grasslands, can build up good levels of soil carbon, but they will grow more vigorously and store more carbon if besides grasses they also contain nitrogen-fixing plants such as clover, and if they are cut using a mulching mower which returns finely-chopped mowings to the lawn. More carbon, however, may be stored by other perennial plants such as trees and shrubs. They also do not need to be maintained using power tools. Climate-friendly gardeners will also aim to increase biodiversity not only for the sake of the wildlife itself, but so that the garden ecosystem is resilient and more likely to store as much carbon as possible as long as possible. They will therefore avoid pesticides, and increase the diversity of the habitats within their gardens.  Reducing greenhouse gas emissions  Climate-friendly gardeners can directly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from their own gardens, but can also use their gardens to indirectly reduce greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere. = Using gardens to reduce greenhouse gas emissions = Climate- friendly gardeners can use their gardens in ways which reduce greenhouse gases elsewhere, for example by using the sun and wind to dry washing on washing lines in the garden instead of using electricity generated by fossil fuel to dry washing in tumble dryers. From farmland Walnut, Juglans regia, with ripening walnuts Food is a major contributor to climate change. In the United Kingdom, according to Tara Garnett of the Food Climate Research Network, food contributes 19% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. Soil is the biggest store of carbon on land. It is therefore important to protect the soil organic matter in farmland. Farm animals, however, especially free- range pigs, may cause erosion, and cultivation of the soil increases the oxidation of soil organic matter into carbon dioxide. Other sources of greenhouse gases from farmland include: compaction caused by farm machinery or overgrazing by farm animals can make soil anaerobic and produce methane; farm animals produce methane; and nitrogen fertilizers can be converted to nitrous oxide. Most farmland consists of fields growing annual arable crops which are eaten directly by people or fed to farm animals, and grassland used as pasture, hay or silage to feed farm animals. Some perennial food plants are also grown, such as fruits and nuts in orchards, and watercress grown in water. Although all cultivation of the soil in arable fields produces carbon dioxide, some arable crops cause more damage to soil than others. Root crops such as potatoes and sugar-beet, and crops which are harvested not just once a year but over a long period such as green vegetables and salads, are considered \\"high risk\\" in catchment-sensitive farming. Climate-friendly gardeners therefore grow at least some of their food, and may choose food crops which therefore help to keep carbon in farmland soils if they grow such high-risk crops in small vegetable plots in their gardens, where it is easier to protect the soil than in large fields under commercial pressures. Climate- friendly gardeners may grow and eat plants such as sweet cicely which sweeten food, and so reduce the land area needed for sugar-beet. They may also choose to grow perennial food plants to not only reduce their indirect greenhouse gas emissions from farmland, but also to increase carbon stores in their own gardens. Grassland contains more carbon per hectare than arable fields, but farm animals, especially ruminants such as cattle or sheep, produce large amounts of methane, directly and from manure heaps and slurry. Slurry and manure may also produce nitrous oxide. Gardeners who want to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions can help themselves to eat less meat and dairy produce by growing nut trees which are a good source of tasty, protein-rich food, including walnuts which are an excellent source of the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid. Researchers and farmers are investigating and improving ways of farming which are more sustainable, such as agroforestry, forest farming, wildlife-friendly farming, soil management, catchment- sensitive farming (or water-friendly farming). For example, the organisation Farming Futures assists farmers in the United Kingdom to reduce their farms' greenhouse gas emissions. Farmers are aware that consumers are increasingly asking for \\"green credentials\\". Gardeners who understand climate-friendly practices can advocate their use by farmers. From industry Nitrogen- fixing and edible - Elaeagnus umbellatus at the Agroforestry Research Trust forest garden in Devon Climate-friendly gardeners aim to reduce their consumption in general. In particular, they try to avoid or reduce their consumption of tapwater because of the greenhouse gases emitted when fossil fuels are burnt to supply the energy needed to treat and pump it to them. Instead, gardeners can garden using only rainwater. Greenhouse gases are produced in the manufacture of many materials and products used by gardeners. For example, it takes a lot of energy to produce synthetic fertilizers, especially nitrogen fertilizers. Ammonium nitrate, for example, has an embodied energy of 67000 kilojoules/kilogramme, so climate-friendly gardeners will choose alternative ways of ensuring the soil in their gardens has optimal levels of nitrogen by alternative means such as nitrogen-fixing plants. Climate-friendly gardeners will also aim to follow \\"cradle-to-cradle design\\" and \\"circular economy\\" principles: when they choose to buy or make something, it should be possible to take it apart again and recycle or compost every part, so that there is no waste, only raw materials to be made into something else. This will reduce the greenhouse gases otherwise produced when extracting raw materials. From transport Gardeners can reduce not only their food miles by growing some of their own food, but also their \\"gardening miles\\" by reducing the amount of plants and other materials they import, obtaining them as locally as possible and with as little packaging as possible. This might include ordering plants by mail order from a specialist nursery if the plants are sent out bare-root, reducing transport demand and the use of peat-based composts; or growing plants from seed, which will also increase genetic diversity and therefore resilience; or growing plants vegetatively from cuttings or offsets from other local gardeners; or buying reclaimed materials from salvage firms. From houses Climbers as insulation - Boston ivy, Parthenocissus tricuspidata, Boston ivy, in autumn Climate-friendly gardeners can use their gardens in ways which reduce greenhouse gas emissions from homes by: * Using sunlight and wind to dry washing on washing lines instead of fossil fuel-generated electricity to run tumble dryers; * Planting deciduous climbers on houses and planting deciduous trees at suitable distances from the house to provide shade during the summer, reducing the consumption of electricity for air conditioning, but also such that at cooler times of year, sunlight can reach and warm a house, reducing heating costs and consumption; * Planting hedges, trees, shrubs and climbers to shelter houses from wind, reducing heating costs and consumption during the winter (as long as any planting does not create a wind-tunnel effect).p. 243 Climate-friendly gardeners may also choose to reduce their own personal greenhouse gas emissions by growing and eating carminative plants such as fennel and garlic which reduce intestinal gases such as methane. = Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from gardens = Slow-growing yew, Taxus baccata, as hedge at Charles Darwin's home, Down House, Kent Nitrogen-fixing red and white clover (Trifolium) as lawn plants Leaf cage, compost heap and wormery at the Royal Horticultural Society garden at Wisley There are some patent sources of greenhouse gas emissions in gardens and some more latent. Power tools which are powered by diesel or petrol, or electricity generated by burning other fossil fuels, emit carbon dioxide. Climate-friendly gardeners may therefore choose to use hand tools rather than power tools, or power tools powered by renewable electricity, or design their gardens to reduce or remove a need to use power tools. For example, they may choose dense, slow-growing species for hedges so that the hedges only need to be cut once a year. Lawns need[?] to be cut by lawn mowers and, in drier parts of the world, are often irrigated by tapwater. Climate-friendly gardeners will therefore do what they can to reduce this consumption by: * Replacing part of or all lawns with other perennial planting such as trees and shrubs with less ecologically demanding maintenance requirements; * Cut some or all lawns only once or twice a year, i.e. convert them into meadows; * Make lawn shapes simple so that they may be cut quickly; * Increase the cutting height of mower blades; * Use a mulching mower to return organic matter to the soil; * Sow clover to increase vigour (without the need for synthetic fertilisers) and resilience in dry periods; * Cut lawns with electric mowers using electricity from renewable energy; * Cut lawns with hand tools such as push mowers or scythes. Greenhouses can be used to grow crops which might otherwise be imported from warmer climates, but if they are heated by fossil fuel then they may cause more greenhouse gas emissions than they save. Climate-friendly gardeners will therefore use their greenhouses carefully by: * Choosing only annual plants which will only be in the greenhouse during warmer months, or perennial plants which do not need any extra heat during winter; * Using water tanks as heat stores and compost heaps as heat sources inside greenhouses so that they stay frost-free in winter. Climate-friendly gardeners will not put woody prunings on bonfires, which will emit carbon dioxide and black carbon, but instead burn them indoors in a wood- burning stove and therefore cut emissions from fossil fuel, or cut them up to use as mulch and increase soil carbon stores, or add the smaller prunings to compost heaps to keep them aerated, reducing methane emissions. To reduce the risk of fire, they will also choose fire-resistant plants from habitats which are not prone to wildfires and which do not catch fire easily, rather than fire-adapted plants from fire-prone habitats which are flammable and adapted to encourage fires and then gain a competitive advantage over less resistant species. Climate-friendly gardeners may use deep-rooted plants such as comfrey to bring nutrients closer to the surface topsoil, but will do so without making the leaves into a liquid feed, because the rotting leaves in the anaerobic conditions under water may emit methane. Nitrogen fertilizers may be oxidised to nitrous oxide, especially if fertilizer is applied in excess, or when plants are not actively growing. Climate-friendly gardeners may choose instead to use nitrogen-fixing plants which will add nitrogen to the soil without increasing nitrous oxide emissions.

Adelman then spent several years researching David Lowery‚Äôs previous band, Camper Van Beethoven, interviewing band members, roadies, fans, producers, managers, videographers. Dissatisfied with the result, he started it over under the name Camden Joy. The result was a novel that included accounts of both The David Lowery Band‚Äôs road trip and Camper Van Beethoven‚Äôs break-up. Much later, in 2000, Harper Collins published the novel as Boy Island under its Quill imprint.\\"Boy Island\\". Publishers Weekly. In 1994, Camden Joy wrote two tracts (‚ÄúLost Pamphlets‚Äù) entitled The Greatest Record Album Ever Told and The Greatest Record Album Singer That Ever Was. Joy moved from Los Angeles to New York in 1995, and attained a brief notoriety for his New York City postering projects and street manifestos. The Lost Manifestoes of Camden Joy were wheat-pasted around Manhattan and Brooklyn throughout the last months of 1995. This Poster Will Not Never Change Your Life { was a multi-poster project in 1996, as was the collaborative Dear CMJ... Joy‚Äôs final act of street postering occurred in the summer of 1997 when he unveiled the collaborative Fifty Posters About Souled American. Joy's essays, which were a combination of music criticism, memoir, and fiction, appeared in a number of periodicals, including the Village Voice, the Boston Phoenix, San Francisco Weekly, and McSweeney's and on This American Life. After hearing Liz Phair‚Äôs Exile in Guyville in 1993, Joy wrote a novel, The Last Rock Star Book or Liz Phair: A Rant, in response.\\"5 obscure music novels you need to read\\" . FasterLouder.

The book was published by Seattle's TNI Books.\\"Of Joy and obsession\\". Los Angeles Times. Retrospective On November 8, 2013, Joy appeared as the President's Keynote Speaker at the 55th Annual Convention of the Midwest Modern Language Association in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A roundtable on Joy's work was held the next day, entitled \\"Ode to Joy: The Career of Camden Joy.\\" Participants included Samuel Cohen, Trinie Dalton, Ben Bush, David N. Meyer, and Adam Wilson. Each spoke to the value of Joy's (by now) largely-forgotten works. Earlier the same week, a panel discussion entitled \\"Majesty of Impulse: On the Great Lost Works of Camden Joy\\" occurred at Housing Works Bookstore in New York. Justin Taylor joined the discussion along with many of the Milwaukee participants, each explaining how they first discovered Joy's works. Camden Joy addressed this event, masquerading as Joey F. Scarneckio, a professional look-alike who'd been called in at the last minute to read Joy's prepared remarks. Reissues On July 14, 2015, Verse Chorus Press of Portland, Oregon, brought \\"Lost Joy\\" back into print. Featuring an introduction by Jonathan Lethem, a foreword by Dennis Cooper, and blurbs from Dave Eggers and Ira Glass, with a new cover designed by Mark Lerner at Rag & Bone Shop, \\"Lost Joy\\" was the first of four Camden Joy books to be reissued by Verse Chorus; soon to follow are \\"Boy Island,\\" \\"3 by Joy\\" (his three novellas collected as one), and \\"The Last Rock Star Book.\\"\\"Bookforum talks with Camden Joy\\".

The episode was written by Melissa Rosenberg and was directed by Marcos Siega. Title The phrase is a common Sci-fi quote, prevalent in popular culture. It was frequently used by the Borg of the Star Trek franchise. Plot Under constant surveillance by federal agents, Dexter is unable to dispose of his latest victim's remains. He apologizes to Rita, admitting that his affair with Lila was a mistake, but she is still hesitant to forgive him, as Lila retaliates by pursuing Angel. After finding Dexter's collection of blood slides, Doakes seeks the advice of an old friend in Haiti to analyze them. The department begins to suspect Doakes's involvement in the Bay Harbor Butcher case, but cannot find him for questions. Debra and Lundy spend the night together and contemplate making their relationship public. Dexter is eventually caught by Doakes with the remains of Jiminez, the man who killed his mother. Doakes attempts to arrest Dexter but Dexter manages to choke him unconscious despite taking a bullet in the leg. He locks Doakes in Jiminez's house and leaves as Doakes screams that Dexter will have to kill him to stop his pursuit. Production Filming locations for the episode included Palos Verdes Estates, and Long Beach, California. Reception The episode was positively received. IGN's Eric Goldman gave the episode a rating of 9.5 out of 10, and commented \\"Wow. Dexter's second season has just gotten better and better and this week's episode was a true jaw-dropper, moving the plot along at an incredibly fast rate. [...] This is truly an excellent and nailbiting scenario the writers have crafted, leaving the show in a wonderfully suspenseful situation. In fact, it was so thrilling, it felt like the penultimate episode of the season, and it's hard to believe there's still three more weeks left. Either way, the show has certainly proved it can continue to grab the audience and I'm sure I'm not alone by far when I say I can't wait to see what happens next.\\" The A.V. Club critic Scott Tobias gave the episode a B+ grade and stated that \\"I'm having trouble figuring out what to write about the episode because so much of it involved the gears of the plot doing a lot of grinding, while leaving Dexter's characterization on the back burner. And yet I still found it a riveting hour, partly because the thriller mechanics were mostly very satisfying and partly because the writers found ways to make them illuminate character. In his distress and scramble to tie up numerous incriminating loose ends, Dexter is still telling us a lot about who he is.\\" References External links  \\"Resistance Is Futile\\" at Showtime's website Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Dexter (TV series) episodes ","title":"Resistance Is Futile (Dexter)"},{"id":"42130119","text":"Mark Boidman is an investment banker and attorney at law in the media and entertainment sector specialized in mergers and acquisitions.

He is a member of the New York and Massachusetts State Bars. Recent events In May 2013, Boidman joined New York investment bank PJ SOLOMON as Director in the Media, Entertainment, Communications and Technology Advisory Practice. At the time of the announcement, then president Kenneth T. Berliner stated: \\"Mark will deepen our presence in the media sector with his expertise in out-of-home advertising, TV broadcasting, and radio coverage.\\" He is a senior manager for the firm's digital and mixed media, and out-of-home media practices; including covering companies in the advertising sector, such as digital signage and digital out-of-home. He became managing director in March 2014. Early 2014, PJSC announced that Boidman would be a keynote speaker at the Digital Signage Expo DSE2014 in Las Vegas, Nevada. His keynote \\"How out-of-home advertising is facilitating the shift from e-commerce to m-commerce\\" explored how \\"With the convergence of media and retail with technology, DOOH advertisements are becoming the point-of-sale and the new shop window;\\" highlighting the importance of content, in advertising, as a vehicle to engage an audience. Additionally Boidman was elected to the board of directors of Digital Signage Federation. In November 2014, it was announced that Boidman would appear at the 2015 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES.) He presented on emerging Digital Out-of-Home technologies, and discussed the relationship between digital media, technology, and valuing content, alongside Michael LaSalle from Shamrock Capital and Allison Goldberg from Time Warner Investments. In February 2015, Boidman was appointed Member of the Advisory Board at Gimbal, Inc. a geofencing and digital beacon technology company developed as a part of Qualcomm Labs and spun off in May 2014.

The e-commerce company is dedicated to promoting antioxidant snacks, products, and healthy habits for cancer patients. Part of the annual profits are donated to universities researching the health effects of antioxidants. He is divorced from Andrea Boidman, former executive director of the Hearing Health Foundation, and current executive director of the Osteo Science Foundation, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to advancing hard and soft tissue regeneration in the area of oral, cranial, and maxillofacial surgery through high-quality basic and clinical research. Work In an interview, September 2013, Boidman expressed his views regarding the intersection between DOOH and other sectors like healthcare, radio and TV, transit, cinema and retail: :\\"There‚Äôs been a lot of talk about consolidation, but I really think that we are at the point where 2014 will see it happen,\\" :\\"In 2014, we see synergies in putting together companies in various sectors: in transit, in healthcare, and in entertainment ‚Äì which includes restaurants and theaters, too. Consolidation opens the door to different types of advertisers for many companies that are currently too small to attract them. It increases the number of eyeballs, and more eyeballs interest advertisers.\\" His article \\"Out- of-Home Media as the Gateway to Mobile Commerce and Retargeting\\" was published in February 2014 in the Journal of Retail Analytics, a quarterly publication by Platt Retail Institute, LLC. an international consulting and research firm that focuses on the use of technology to impact the customer experience. In this article, he addresses the role of new technology in delivering more capable and cost-effective DOOH media platforms to bridge the digital/mobile commerce gap. An example of these platforms is the public transportation network with digital signage included in taxis, public transit buses, and trains, where innovations in the application of DOOH emerge as transit authorities advance their usage. In May 2015, Boidman was one of seven featured speakers at the 2015 OAAA-TAB National Convention + Expo in San Diego, alongside the author, Malcolm Gladwell. Boidman made specific recommendations to the attendees, including using technology to demonstrate ROI of OOH advertising, and creating an open structure data management platform that would involve using data to target audiences. In July 2015, the City of New York announced an initiative to bring free, high-speed broadband service to more than 16,000 New Yorkers living in five public housing developments in Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. Smart city initiatives could represent a $1.5 trillion opportunity for the decade preceding 2015 for software and hardware companies, according to Boidman. :\\"Cisco and IBM have been focused on this space for a while, but they haven‚Äôt wanted to talk about it. Now they want to talk about it, and a lot of that has to do with Smart Cities,\\" said Boidman.\\"If you can use these solutions to help make out-of-home smarter, then more dollars should flow to digital out-of-home media.\\" Boidman is an advocate for better practices regarding privacy-friendly real-time data and analytics in the OOH and DOOH industries. His work in that field includes interviews and panels such as DSE's 2015 seminar focused on the way in which mobile is integrated into company strategies to provide a greater ROI. And DSE's 2016 keynote addressing the state of the industry. Mobile and beacon technologies transform OOH media, enabling advertisers to engage consumers on the go. OOH smart billboards feature beacons and other devices that help track travel patterns, behavior and other information of interest to advertisers. These billboards tap into the data on mobile phones of passersby. In Boidman's opinion, \\"In the world of online, they can track you with cookies, they know where you‚Äôve been and where you‚Äôre going next. It‚Äôs almost the same thing in real life.\\" \\"From a privacy standpoint, people are willing to give up information about themselves, as long as it‚Äôs aggregated and anonymous,\\" he says. \\"They‚Äôre very comfortable [doing so] in order to get valuable information in return that‚Äôs going to help them. Our view is it‚Äôs the same thing online. Some people find it okay that they‚Äôre being tracked and certain targeted ads head their way.\\" Regarding the impact that such developments as Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) and OpenCL, Boidman argues: \\"Everybody is looking for software to do more and for less money, and technologies such as HSA and OpenCL make it easier to design low-power devices and improve performance for the designer, the [designer‚Äôs OEM] customer and the user. Writing programs across platform solutions that allow people to connect seamlessly with digital signage is the future.\\" And advocates for the use of the term intelligent visual communications rather than digital signage.

He expressed by his preachings that the converted Rajputs, Meo and Jats (Muslim Rajputs) were in no way different from their Hindu counterparts in culture, customs and celebrations of religious festivals. He also defined by his preachings that they were not only pir- parast (Guru-worshippers) and grave worshiping (Qabr-parast); they were also idol-worshippers. They celebrated Holi, Diwali and other Hindu festivals with zeal and dressed in the Hindu fashion.http://voiceofdharma.org/books/tlmr/ch8.htmhttp://www.bharatvani.org/books/tfst/appi1.htm  Works as a reformer  \\"Hadi e Haryana\\" Shah Muhammad Ramzan Shaheed Mehami was the prominent reformer of Haryana who typified this Da'wa. He made the Rajput Muslim conscious of their separate identity from Hindus. Shah Muhammad Ramzan used to sojourn in areas inhabited by such converted Rajputs, dissuade them from practising Hindu rites and persuade them to marry their cousins (real uncle's daughters which converts persistently refused to do). They equally detested eating cow's flesh. To induce them to eat beef, he introduced new festivals like Mariyam ka Roza and Rot-bot (on this eves, people observed on 17 Rajjab, a pao of roasted beef placed on a fried bread, was distributed amongst relatives and near and dear ones). Ramzan also encouraged such people to build mosques in large numbers, and to establish the wearing of Muslim dress and the observance of Islamic obligation. Waa'z (sermons) were employed as method of Da'wa. Hindus also revered Shah Muhammad Ramzan and in several Hindu villages there were \\"Shah Ramzan ke Chabutre\\" (raised platforms for Shah Ramzan). Such endeavours have ruled out the possibility of reconversion and have helped in the Islamization of neo-Muslims.Travellers in Faith: Studies of the Tablƒ´ghƒ´ JamƒÅ ªat as a Transnational Islamic Movement for Faith Renewal  Early life and death  He was born in Meham District Rohtak (Haryana) Punjab in 1769. His father Shah Abdul Azeem ( d 1828 Meham ) was Majzoob ( ŸÖÿ¨ÿ∞Ÿàÿ® )Sufi. His grand father Shah Abdul Hakeem (1709- 1773) was a notable Urdu writer of his time. Shah Muhammad Ramzan was dissatisfied with the Sufi religious system under his father Shah Abdul Azeem whose Rajput devotees present him with a tithe from every thing taken in their raids. Therefore, at the age of fourteen he left his family to study with Shah Abdul Qadir and Shah Abdul Aziz Delhivi the sons of Shah Waliullah. There he studied for fourteen years (1783-1796). He has worked as a preacher and tablighi throughout his life. Shah Muhammad Ramzan was killed by his co-religionist Bohras at Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh when he was returned from \\"Hajj\\" on 18 January 1825.

Automobiles, developed during this early period by a man called F.Doutr√©, followed in 1911. The business was taken over by Georges Irat in or at some stage after 1920, and by 1925 production had been shifted the short distance to the Georges Irat home town of Chatou. Production ended in 1928. The cars The first car, the \\"Majola Type A\\" appeared in 1911. It was powered by a 4-cylinder engine of 1.3-litres. Soon afterwards a second model, the \\"Majola Type B\\" was added, also powered by a 4-cylinder engine, but the engine on the \\"Type B\\" was only a 1-litre unit. Both these models would reappear after the war. The two little 4-cylinder engined cars comprised the range exhibited at the 15th Paris Motor Show in October 1919.

The wheelbases were respectively and . Contemporary photographs show both cars fitted with \\"Torpedo\\" bodies which provided seating for four on the longer chassis and for two on the shorter one. At the 19th Paris Motor Show in October 1924 Majola again exhibited two small cars with 4-cylinder engines. The larger engine was still of 1,390cc. The smaller engine retained the piston stroke of the car exhibited five years before, but the cylinder diameter (bore) had been increased by giving rise to an overall capacity increase to 1,088cc. The increased cylinder bore also raised the car tax band and the car was branded as a \\"7 HP\\". The wheelbase of the larger model was, like the engine size, unchanged, but the less powerful model now sat on a wheelbase. In October 1924 The manufacturer was quoting a prices for the two cars, when fitted with a 4-seater \\"Torpedo\\" bodies. of 24,300 francs and 18,900 francs. There was no Paris Motor Show in October 1925, the venue having been booked instead for an Exhibition of Decorative Arts. In October 1926 the Motor Show returned. Majola again took a stand, and again exhibited their \\"7 HP\\" and \\"10 HP\\", powered by the same 1,088cc and 1,390cc engines as before. This time the familiar models were joined by a 5 HP Cyclecar powered by an air-cooled engine designed by an engineer called Vaslin, who had built his reputation as the creator of a succession of light-weight aero-engines. Competition A sports bodied 1,390cc Majola participated in the Le Mans 24 Hour race in 1925, driven by Jean Majola himself (partnered by Fernand Casellini), but the car failed to distinguish itself, retiring after 14 laps.

Set mainly in Imola, Italy, but also in other Italian cities, including Machiavelli's hometown Florence during the Renaissance, the story focuses on three months in the life of Niccolo Machiavelli, the Florentine politician, diplomat, philosopher and writer in the early years of the 16th century. The book was first published by Heinemann in 1946. It recollects Machiavelli's encounter with Cesare Borgia, who was the model on which Machiavelli based his Il Principe. Against that background, a love farce unfolds, in which Machiavelli tries to seduce the young wife of his host at Imola. The unsuccessful affair gave Machiavelli the idea of writing his first comedy - The Mandrake. Thus, Then and Now appears to combine the two best known works of Machiavelli - The Prince and The Mandrake.

Biography Born in Ilford, Essex, Hinton was the daughter of travelling opera singers who settled in Liverpool. Already in her mid-teens, she studied ballet there making her d√©but in 1943 as Helen of Troy in Dr Faustus at the Playhouse, Liverpool. The following year, Andr√©e Howard recommended her to the Ballet Rambert. Hinton was initially only given minor roles in ballets from the choreographers Frederick Ashton, Antony Tudor and Frank Staff. However she soon moved on to larger roles including the Queen of the Wilis in Giselle. After receiving further instruction from Stanislas Idzikowski and Audrey de Vos, she danced in Les Sylphides and played the lead in Howard's Lady into Fox. Her qualities were also noticed by their resident choreographer Walter Gore in 1948 who gave her leading roles in his Winter Night and Plaisance. During Ballet Rambert's 1948 tour of Australia, Gore created roles in Winter Night for himself, Sally Gilmour and Hinton, and the ballet's plot mirrored the actual \\"love triangle\\" between the three of them. Up to that point, Gore and Gilmour had been in a relationship. After appearing in a dramatic role in his Antonia, Hinton married Gore in January 1950. She made appearances with the Ballets Russes, dancing the lead in the opera-ballet Le Coq d'Or (music by Rimsky-Korsakov), and with Les Ballets des Champs- Elys√©es where she was burnt as a witch in Gore's La Damn√©e. All in all, Gore created some 20 roles for her in the various companies he led, above all in his short-lived London Ballet. Hinton also spent a considerable time dancing in the Netherlands as well as in Frankfurt, Germany. In the early 1970s, Hinton returned to England to dance as a guest with the Northern Dance Theatre in Manchester. The ballet, Dance Pictures, was a new work created by Gore for the company and premi√®red at The Place in London. Gore died in April 1979 while they were in Pamplona, Spain. Hinton attempted to revive Gore's ballets but with limited success. She died in Birkenhead on 5 November 1996, leaving no children.

He also lectured on matters of art. Kolb understood that unlike literature, theater and music, the visual arts did not assume a central position in Israel, and worked to raise the level. Among other things, he supported the establishment of the group of artists known as \\"New Horizons\\" (Ofakim Hadashim) and helped launch their careers. In 1950 he was appointed artistic adviser to the Tel Aviv Museum, and in 1952 he was appointed general manager.

He has been a professor at the University of Massachusetts, Clark University, and the University of Oklahoma. He is now a professor at Eastern Florida State College. Shary has focused on the representational politics of age and gender. His essays and reviews have appeared in Men and Masculinities, Film Quarterly, Sight & Sound, Journal of Film and Video, Film Criticism, Journal of Popular Film and Television, Wide Angle, and The Journal of Popular Culture. Education Shary earned his B.A. degree in 1991 at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, where his work focused on cinema studies. His Division III project (a thesis written for graduation) examined voyeurism in Alfred Hitchcock's films, and he also wrote \\"A History of Student Activities and Achievements at Hampshire College\\". Shary went on to earn an M.A. in Film Scholarship at Ohio University in 1992, where his thesis was entitled The Present Personal Truth: Three Properties of Video and Their Effect on the Reception of Contemporary Narrative Cinema. Much of that thesis was published in two journal articles: ‚ÄúPresent Personal Truths: The Alternative Phenomenology of Video in I‚Äôve Heard the Mermaids Singing‚ÄùWide Angle, vol. 15, #3, July 1993, pp. 37-55 and ‚ÄúVideo as Accessible Artifact and Artificial Access: The Early Films of Atom Egoyan‚Äù.Film Criticism, vol. 19, #3, spring 1995, pp. 2-29 In 1998, Shary earned his Ph.D. in Communication at the University of Massachusetts, with a dissertation entitled Generation Multiplex: The Image of Youth in American Cinema, 1981-1996. This study would be the foundation for his first book in 2002. Published works As Shary completed his doctoral studies and began teaching at Clark University, he published articles and reviews such as \\"The Teen Film and its Methods of Study\\" (Journal of Popular Film and Television), \\"Reification and Loss in Postmodern Puberty: The Cultural Logic of Fredric Jameson and Young Adult Movies\\" (Postmodernism in the Cinema), and \\"Film Genres and the Cinematic Image of Youth‚Äì A College Course File\\" (Journal of Film and Video). Shary had argued for the legitimacy of teen movies as a codified and potent American film genre throughout his early work, as evident in his anthologized essay ‚ÄúTeen Films: The Cinematic Image of Youth‚Äù, first published in Film Genre Reader III (ed. Barry Keith in 2003 and reprinted in 2012). He also began specific studies of gender representation and youth with articles such as ‚ÄúThe Nerdly Girl and Her Beautiful Sister: Torments of Intelligence for Teen Movie Girls‚Äù (Sugar, Spice, and Everything Nice: Cinemas of Girlhood) and ‚ÄúBad Boys and Hollywood Hype: Gendered Conflicts in Juvenile Delinquency Depictions‚Äù (Where the Boys Are: Cinemas of Masculinity and Youth). His work on gender continued in studies of youth cinema such as ‚ÄúVirgin Springs: A Survey of Teen Films' Quest for Sexcess‚Äù (Virgin Territory: Representing Sexual Inexperience in Film), ‚ÄúBuying Me Love: 1980s Class-Clash Teen Romances‚Äù (The Journal of Popular Culture), and ‚Äú‚ÄòThe only place to go is inside‚Äô: Confusions about Sexuality and Class from Kids to Superbad,‚Äù which has been published in numerous editions of Popping Culture since 1996. Shary continued with The Films of Amy Heckerling, which he co-edited with Frances Smith as part of the ReFocus series by the University of Edinburgh Press in 2016. He edited the collection Millennial Masculinity in 2013, based on his wider interests in gender on screen. In recent years, Shary began studying older characters in American cinema. His first publication of this research was ‚ÄúThe Politics of Aging in the May‚ÄìDecember Romance Plot‚Äù (Quarterly Review of Film and Video). He completed a new book with Nancy McVittie, Fade to Gray: Aging in American Cinema, which was published by the University of Texas Press in September, 2016. Shary authored a book-length study of the 2014 Richard Linklater film Boyhood (part of the Routledge series Cinema and Youth Cultures), which was published in 2017. He is now co-editing another collection in the ReFocus series with Frances Smith, on the films of John Hughes, scheduled for publication in 2020.

It was a country estate and served as a training college for the Jesuits.The Inventory of Architectural Heritage retrieved 25 October 2013 The Jesuits also had premises which are now the Evangelical Theological Faculty in Heverlee. These two sites originally served as the philosophy and theological college for all the Jesuits in Belgium. Plans were made in 1931 to have one college for the French-speaking Jesuits and another separate one for the Flemish- speaking Jesuits. In 1935, these plans had not materialised and when the Jesuits created separate administrative units (or provinces) for the Flemish- speaking Jesuits and the French-speaking Jesuits, they both still shared the building. =Construction= In 1953, a site was found for the construction of the college and the architect Jos Ritzen was contracted to design it. He had previously worked with Alphons Boosten. Together they built churches in Maastricht and Eygelshoven in the early 1920s. Building work stated on 31 July 1956 and it was completed in June 1958. The cost escalated during construction and on completion it was BEF72 million, which in 2010 would be ‚Ç¨11 million. As the French-speaking Jesuits had one tall building on one side of the River Dijle and the Flemish-speaking Jesuits had another on the other side of the river, students there would refer to the two buildings as the 'Two Towers'. =Expansion= In the 1960s vocations to religious life fell dramatically in the Catholic church and they had to expand the building's usage. The building still contained the Jesuit archives, but it was adapted to contain a conference centre, a Jesuit retirement home and a student hostel.Jezuietenhuis.be retrieved 21 October 2013 The Lerkeveld Student Hostel provides accommodation and study space for students of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.Lerkeveld.be retrieved 5 March 2014 The archive contains documents such as ones about education in the schools run by the Jesuits in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.Jesuit College in Ghent from State Archives in Belgium retrieved 25 October 2013 In 2004, the Flemish Jesuits moved 15,000 books of a collection called 'Jesuitica and Ignatiana' to the Maurits Sabbe Library of the Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.Features from Jesuits retrieved 21 October 2013About the Maurit Sabbe Library from Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies, Catholic University of Leuven retrieved 21 October 2013 Parish The Jesuit community there also serve the local Catholic population by regularly celebrating Mass.

Pikyaw follows a group of children: Abet, Tyrone, and Marco who finds themselves in a parallel universe that is the subject of revenge by Albion, a creature who lived in Calixto since he was a child. The film was written by Mahnnie Tolentino, and featured music by artists from Think Logic Records, who are all Ilonggo bands. Its executive producers were Mahnnie Tolentino(MAGE Inc.), Ralph Pe√±alosa(TL Records) and Seth dA. Nono(UI-PHINMA). MAGE, Inc., which produced events that focuses on Ilonggo artists development, particularly on comic book illustration, cosplay, photography, and animation, approached the University of Iloilo - PHINMA to co-produce an animated feature that would eventually become the first feature- length Ilonggo animated film. Mahnnie Tolentino wrote an early story treatment which was later discarded for being too edgy and mature. After several revisions focusing on a more child-friendly theme, MAGE, Inc., then consisting of a relatively small number of members, together with select students from the University of Iloilo - PHINMA, produced the film under minor financial constraints. Pikyaw was screened at SM City Iloilo and went on to earn around PhP100,000 in three(3) days, from February 26‚Äì28, 2014.  Plot  Saref, an encantada - aswang hybrid creature, told her companions of the coming of the red moon in four weeks. She adds that their revenge on the dwarves is at hand. The monsters, consisting of Albion, Craston, Kaeg and Agas are apparently happy of this development. They were later deployed by Albion to various points of Calixto, a parallel world inhabited by Ilonggo folk creatures. As this was happening in Calixto, two boys, Abet and Nathan, who lived in Iloilo City, Calixto's parallel world, cut class to play Pikyaw (an antiquated Filipino game) against Marco; a bully who is believed to be the best in the game. Along the way, they met Tyrone after Abet accidentally ripped Tyrone's bag. Abet and Nathan escaped the scene as Tyrone shouts for them to replace his bag. Meanwhile, two dwarves, Unico and Auros, were discussing between themselves of the potentials of Nathan and Marco as champions who they'll bring to Calixto and help them on their fight against Albion. Unico was very happy of getting two big and agile children, but Auros seems to be focused on Abet and his good heart. During the climax of the exciting Pikyaw game between Nathan and Marco, Tyrone came over the playing field with his mother so they can force Abet to replace his bag. While this exchange was going on, Auros alerted Unico that the champions have now gathered and it is time for them to take the champions to Calixto. A bright light suddenly enveloped the playing field. Abet, Tyrone and Marco find themselves alone with the dwarves who began to tell them of the plan to restore Calixto, but the conversations was cut off due to Auros' inability to keep the connection. The heroes then find themselves inside the University of Iloilo - PHINMA's campus where they defeated Agas and took his stick, which is actually the weapon for Abet. They were able to discover the plan of Albion to abduct Rebecca, Tyrone's househelp, and were able to stop it. The heroes fought with Craston and Kaeg to protect Rebecca from Albion, from which they recovered the Sword of the Mahentoy (Cyclopes) and the Bow of the Encantada (Fairies). After this, they hid at Jaro Cathedral where they met Unico. Unico explained that Albion (or Terrence as he is known in Iloilo) was one of the children that they took to Calixto as a playmate. This is not an unusual event in Filipino folklore: dwarves abducting children with special abilities/characteristics as playthings. The abduction is supposed to be temporary since the dwarves will have to bring the children back to their families to avoid detection. However, the situation changed when Terrence found a plate of black rice and began to eat some. According to folklore, once you eat food from Calixto, you won't be able to go back until the next selenelion, a rare phenomenon where the moon becomes red due to a lunar eclipse occurring at dawn or dusk. The dwarves, realizing that they have a rare opportunity to keep Terrence, passed up on several chances to bring him back to Iloilo. Terrence resented the dwarves for not doing anything to bring him back and left the dwarves. He rechristened himself as Albion, and with the support of the other folk creatures, set out on revenge against the dwarves. Saref was able to follow the heroes at Jaro Cathedral and fought with Tyrone and Marco, who took the Bow of the Encantada and the Sword of the Mahentoy, respectively. Their new weapons were able to spawn them new armor as well, and they held Saref off while Abet, Rebecca, and Unico escaped. During the escape, Unico found out that Abet holds half of the weapon of the dwarves: the Sticks of the Dwarves. Unico persuaded Abet to help Tyrone and Marco and gave him the other half of the weapon. When Abet combined the two weapons, he became Lakan, the champion of the dwarves, proficient in the use of Arnis, a Filipino martial art. The three were able to fight off Saref and bound her to the Jaro Belfry. Saref told them that they were too late to save Calixto, since the red moon has appeared and Rebecca isn't saved. It turned out that Saref was trying to save Rebecca from the dwarves. Unico revealed to Rebecca that Calixto's happiness depended on the dwarves' ability to control the psyche of Calixto. The dwarves' happiness will reflect on Calixto's, therefore their need to take Rebecca as replacement to Albion. Nathan, now the champion of the Kapres wielding a heavy ax, stalled Unico's plan until he was stopped by Abet, Tyrone and Marco. Nathan was helped later by Craston, Kaeg, Agas and Saref. Behind them is Albion, who took Rebecca and Unico. He knocked Unico unconscious and asked Nathan to start the ceremony: kill him and save Rebecca, which will stop the dwarves' system indefinitely. Nathan was later disarmed by Abet, Tyrone and Marco. Albion retaliated and held off Tyrone and Marco and forced Abet to kill him. Abet, left without any choices, changed to Lakan and proceeded to give Albion the killer blow. Rebecca, realizing that Calixto will not return to normal, interrupted the whole ceremony and sacrificed her future, accepting her fate as Albion's replacement. Albion was adamant that the ceremony continue and persuaded Rebecca not to do it, for she will never be happy in Calixto. Rebecca dismissed this, believing that making others happy is enough to make her happy. After that, Albion reverted to his old form and he returned to Iloilo, together with Abet, Tyrone, Marco and Nathan. The four children, after making amends and discovering a new bond of friendship, played Pikyaw together as Terrence, now a 46-year-old man, walks by.

The story was deemed too dark, and Mahnnie Tolentino took over the writing. Of all the story elements in the original by Arnold Fuentes, only the child, Abet and the main villain Albion (previously named Braguda) was left. Mahnnie Tolentino stated that he got the idea of child abduction by dwarves to his own experience when he was younger. \\"I had my usual siestas on top of a guava tree one afternoon. When I climbed down, there are several police at the house and my mother came to me and told me I was gone for three days.\\" The local albularyo later told his family that he was abducted by dwarves. Terrence, who later became Albion, is actually an albino, which made him attractive to the dwarves. Dwarves usually abducts children who have special powers or characteristics. This explains his white hair, even as a child. Saref is a halfling (encantada and aswang). She's an outcast because of being a halfling and served as Terrence's sitter. She later became Albion's most loyal follower. The three children (Abet, Tyrone and Marco) represented different adolescent personalities that is usually seen in Filipino children: cowardly (Abet), snobbish (Tyrone), and bullyish (Marco). The script was re-written 4 times to accommodate the character development of each child, especially Abet. In previous drafts, Abet's personality closely resembles Marco, but was later changed. Tyrone is the only character that didn't went to a rigorous rewrite. Marco's final design was only done in the final rewrite. ;Casting A casting call was made exclusively for the University of Iloilo - PHINMA. Numerous students from the College of Information Technology Education (CITE) auditioned for the major roles. Saref and Marco (Marylour and Augustus) were cast on the first day of audition. Voice actors for Albion and Tyrone's mother were also cast. A second casting call was scheduled again, this time for the Basic Education Department, elementary and high school. The roles for the dwarves, Abet, Tyrone, Lakan, the villains and most of the additional voices were cast. Mark Anthony Escoba√±ez, the voice of Albion, was the last to be recorded. He replaced another voice actor who wasn't able to record because of previous commitments. Gina Juarez also replaced another voice actress who wasn't able to come for the table read. ;Animation MAGE, Inc. decided to differentiate itself from other established animation styles. It was initially an anime-type animation but Arnold Fuentes decided to innovate an animation style that is inspired by several characters from Funny Komiks of the late 80s, a style that is very relatable to children. The action sequences were inspired by the Japanese Super Sentai series. The layouts for the backgrounds were made to match the animation style of the characters, hence the stylized corners and thick borders. All of the layouts were original digital drawings made from photographs collected from various Iloilo City sites. Marketing Marketing for the film included self-financed print advertising, aggressive internet advertising as well as partnerships with the Department of Education,http://www.depedregion6.ph/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,1162/Itemid,50/ the Commission on Higher Education, the City of Iloilo Tourism Board, Love Radio, Panay News and University of Iloilo's school organ. The marketing was also focused on elementary and high school students around the city, through a campus tour. Charity The proceeds of the movie will be donated to the Philippine National Red Cross and the PHINMA Helping Hands for the rehabilitation of the areas devastated by super typhoon Haiyan, locally named Yolanda.

Founded in 2008, The school is devoted to public policy research and education, and is led by Pierre-Gerlier Forest. Located at the University of Calgary‚Äôs downtown campus, it is home to over 60 full-time or part-time faculty and fellows. The school is organized into three policy areas: Economic and Social Policy, Energy and Environmental Policy, and International Policy. Since 2012 the school has offered a graduate degree program, the Master of Public Policy. The degree is structured as a 12-month program involving two semesters of classroom-based learning and one semester of project work.  History  = Founding = The School of Public Policy was founded in January 2008 as The School of Policy Studieshttps://www.ucalgary.ca/news/uofcpublications/oncampus/online/june14-07/publicpolicy when economist Jack Mintz left the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto to become Palmer Chair in Public Policy at the University of Calgary. The chair was established through a gift of $4 million from James S. Palmer and Barbara A. Palmer intended to create a school for policy studies at the University of Calgary. From its inception, The School of Public Policy was designed as an interdisciplinary institution that would draw on expertise from academics across various departments and faculties at the university, including the Department of Economics, Department of Political Science, the Centre for Military and Strategic Studies and the University of Calgary Faculty of Law. Among the university‚Äôs faculty contributing to early work by The School of Public Policy were Dr. Ron Kneebone, Dr. Herb Emery, Dr. David Bercuson and Dr. Robert Mansell. The school was formally launched on May 13, 2009, at an opening dinnerhttp://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/condoleezza-rice-gets-warm- reception-at-calgary-speech-1.844332 during which former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice delivered a keynote speech.  Academics  = Research structure = The School‚Äôs research is organized into three policy areas: Economic and Social Policy, Energy and Environmental Policy, and International Policy. Each area consists of underlying programs devoted to more specific policy areas. Research projects are guided and approved by a Research Committee. The School follows a strict model for academic objectivity. All research is requested by an independent research committee made up of academics at The School. Then, research is reviewed by two anonymous peer reviewers. Research is then edited and subjected to a final objectivity and quality review by an independent academic area director.http://policyschool.ucalgary.ca/?q=research = Research output = The school maintains its own peer-reviewed publication series. Papers focus on current public policy issues and are written by both internal and external authors. The publication series includes three different types of papers: Communiqu√©s, Research Papers and Technical Papers. In the 2013 calendar year, the school produced 43 publications. By comparison, it produced 32 in 2012, 20 in 2011 and 17 in 2010. The school publishes an annual global tax competitiveness ranking that compares the attractiveness to business investment of roughly 90 countries and the 10 Canadian provinces based on their tax regimes. The Marginal Effective Tax Rate (METR) of each jurisdiction is calculated, which then determines the rankings. Other notable research by the school includes a paper written by Martha Hall Findlay from June 2012, which called for the dismantling of Canada‚Äôs supply management regime for dairy and poultry products. A paper published in December 2011 regarding market potential for Canadian energy exports also drew attention from politicians and national media in the context of ongoing debate around pipeline projects, including Keystone XL. The report quantified potential gains for the Canadian and provincial economies if the country was able to match the demands of new emerging markets and argued that this was contingent on pipeline projects being completed. = Degrees = In September 2011, the school began offering its graduate degree program, the Master of Public Policy (MPP). The MPP is structured as a one-year program with three semesters. The first two semesters involve classroom study whereas in the final semester, students work on a capstone project for a sponsoring organization from the private or public sector. The school admits between 30 and 40 students to the program each year, including international students. Core courses in the MPP are taught out of the school‚Äôs classroom space at the University of Calgary‚Äôs Downtown Campus with some elective courses taught at the university‚Äôs main campus. The school offers a joint Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Public Policy (MPP) program. This program is run by both the school and the Haskayne School of Business. A joint Juris Doctor, Master of Public Policy program is also offered. =Conservatism= Some commentators have argued that the School functions as a publicly funded conservative lobby group.

He was one of the three older brothers of Andy Williams, and the two of them appeared together as The Williams Brothers. Biography Richard Blaine \\"Dick\\" Williams was born in Wall Lake, Iowa, the son of Jay Emerson and Florence (n√©e Finley) Williams. While living in Cheviot, Ohio, he attended Western Hills High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. He finished high school at University High School, in West Los Angeles, because of his family's move to California. Williams had three brothers: Bob, Don, and Andy. One of his first performances was in a children's choir at the local Presbyterian church. He and his brothers formed the Williams Brothers quartet in late 1938, and they performed on radio in the Midwest, first at WHO, in Des Moines, Iowa. In July 1940 the family moved to Chicago and received a job at WLS, in Chicago, and WLW, in Cincinnati. Moving to Los Angeles in 1943, the Williams Brothers sang with Bing Crosby on the hit record \\"Swinging on a Star\\" (1944). They appeared in four musical films: Janie (1944), Kansas City Kitty (1944), Something in the Wind (1947) and Ladies' Man (1947). The Brothers were signed by Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer to appear in Anchors Aweigh and Ziegfeld Follies (1945) but, before they went before the cameras, the oldest brother, Bob, was drafted into military service and the group's contract was canceled. Kay Thompson, a former radio star who was now head of the vocal department at MGM, had a nose for talent and hired the remaining three Williams brothers to sing in her large choir on many soundtracks for MGM films, including The Harvey Girls (1946). When Bob completed his military service, Kay hired all four brothers to sing on the soundtrack to Good News (1947). By then, Thompson was tired of working behind the scenes at MGM so, with the four Williams boys as her backup singers and dancers, she formed a nightclub act called Kay Thompson and the Williams Brothers. They made their debut in Las Vegas in 1947 and became an overnight sensation. Within a year, they were the highest paid nightclub act in the world, breaking records wherever they appeared. When the Thompson and Williams Brothers act ended in 1953, the brothers broke up and they went their own ways developing their own solo acts. Dick Williams went to sing with the Harry James band and later in August 1951 landed on Broadway.Billboard, August 18, 1951, page 14 In 1998, Andy, Don, Dick and their sister Jane, visited Wall Lake for the dedication of the Williams family home as a historic site and tourist attraction.Ken Mansfield The White Book: The Beatles, the Bands, the Biz 2007 p 154 \\"(Andy and Dick began their careers as two of the four brothers in the Williams Brothers Quartet.)

The house was previously a private residence, it now serves as a private school. The house along with the attached stables and lodge are Grade II listed buildings. History =Private house= Mylnhurst was built in 1883 for Major William Greaves Blake. Blake had served in the 6th Dragoon Guards and as a lieutenant had been awarded the Indian Mutiny Medal for his part in suppressing that uprising in 1857. British Medals Gives details of Indian Mutiny medal. When Mylnhurst was constructed it stood in an isolated rural situation consisting of open farmland interspersed with pockets of woodland. The Greaves Blake's nearest neighbour was Henry Vickers, the Lord Mayor of Sheffield in 1860, who lived at Holmwood 500 metres to the SW overlooking Ecclesall Woods. After the death of his first wife, William Greaves Blake married Rebecca Jessop in 1869, the daughter of Thomas Jessop steel maker and founder of Jessop Hospital and they moved into Mylnhurst in 1883. Jane's Genealogy Pages Gives details of Jessop family. Mylnhurst was constructed in the neo gothic style, it cost ¬£14,000, a considerable amount at the time, the house was large for a family home, but the Greaves Blakes needed the space as they had twelve children. Mylnhurst was renowned for its large beautiful gardens, with lake, Japanese garden, greenhouses and vinery. The early part of the 1900s saw a considerable parcel of land sold off to create the housing on Button Hill and Millhouses Lane, the lake was filled in at this time. In 1908 Major Greaves Blake's son Philip married Dorothy Barbour and they were given a piece of Mylnhurst land to construct their own home, known as Button Hill House at 1 Woodholm Road.\\"Ecclesall - Pocket Images\\", Ecclesall Local History Society, Nonsuch Publishing Ltd, , Page 56 Gives history of Mylnhurst, Button Hill House and school.

The adjacent Button Hill House was sold to the Sisters in 1936 and was used as a boarding house for Mylnhurst pupils, it later became known as St Gerards and housed novitiates, afterwards it was used as university lodgings before being demolished to make way for bungalows on Woodholm Road. The school began with seven pupils when it first opened and was known as Mylnhurst High School, changing later to Mylnhurst Convent School. By 1935 there were 96 pupils including 10 boarders and the old billiards room had been converted into a dining room.\\"Sheffield's Remarkable Houses\\", Roger Redfern, The Cottage Press, , Page 41 Gives general history of house. =New chapel added= In June 1962 a chapel was added to the building, designed by local architect John Rochford and opened by Bishop George Dwyer.

It is the deadliest automobile accident in United States history, according to the National Safety Council. The tragedy was a factor in the decision by Congress in 1964 to terminate the bracero program, despite its strong support among farmers. It also helped spur the Chicano Civil Rights Movement.  Background  The workers on the bus lived at the Earl Myers Co. labor camp in Salinas, Monterey County, California, and were returning after a ten-hour shift harvesting celery and other vegetables from two fields in the Salinas Valley. 53 were braceros contracted by the Growers Farm Labor Association of Salinas. There were also five non-bracero farm laborers, including one undocumented immigrant and two transients who were not Mexican-Americans. Of the five, only the undocumented immigrant was killed. The passengers were riding on two long board benches running the length of the vehicle, which was a flatbed truck covered with a canopy, with the passengers unable to communicate with the driver. It was typical of the converted vehicles used to transport farmworkers in California, which in subsequent years have been criticized for endangering the safety of farmworkers. Some of the workers were sitting on the floor of the bus amid long knives used in the harvesting and metal food containers. The driver was the workers' foreman, Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Espinosa, who was 34 years of age and a permanent resident alien.  Crash  At about 4:20 to 4:25 p.m., Espinosa was traveling east on Thomas Ranch Road, a private country lane, approaching a single railroad track just to the west of, and parallel to, U.S. Route 101, a mile south of Chualar and about eight miles south of Salinas. The crossing, which was privately maintained, was not marked by lights, signs or signals. There were no trees, crops or other objects impeding visibility down the train tracks. The current location of the crash site is the intersection of Foletta Road and Broome Road. A freight train from the Southern Pacific Railroad with four diesel locomotives, the lead unit being SP 5857, an ALCO RS-11, pulling 71 cars carrying sugar beets, and a caboose, was approaching from the south at a high rate of speed, 61 miles per hour according to the railroad and 67 miles per hour, according to the California Highway Patrol. The precise speed was never determined with certainty.According to the Galarza report, Southern Pacific and the train crew said it was 61 m.p.h. The California Highway Patrol based its determination on the train's tachometer, but that was disputed by Southern Pacific, which said the tachometer was malfunctioning. The train crew applied the emergency brake. Not realizing the train was approaching, the driver moved slowly across. The train collided with the bus. Despite the application of the emergency brake, the train did not come to a stop until the front of the train had proceeded 3,050 feet north of the intersection. Years later, a survivor recalled that the bus was struck in the rear, and that he survived because he went to the front.  Aftermath  The 32 dead and injured were scattered around the tracks, some thrown more than 100 feet. Twenty-three died at the scene and nine died en route to the hospital or afterwards. Fifteen ambulances carried victims from the scene. Many casualties were inflicted by being dragged along with the bus and direct impact by the train, while other injuries were caused by splintered flooring planks, jagged edges of twisted metal, harvest knives and metal equipment. One victim was cut in half by the wheels of the train. The injuries were so gruesome that blood flowed like water from one ambulance, according to one account. The dead ranged in age from 19 to 59, and a partial count indicated that they left behind 37 dependents under the age of 16. They came from the Mexican states of Sonora, Guanajuato, Michoac√°n, Puebla, Jalisco and Zacatecas. No one on the train was hurt, and the only person on the bus who was uninjured was the driver, Espinosa. Initially only twelve bodies were identified, because of the custom that the workers be identified only by number, not by name, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation was called in to identify most of the deceased. The failure to identify the bodies was cited by critics of the bracero program, who said it indicated how Mexican workers were not treated as persons. The funeral arrangements became a fiasco, with Salinas municipal authorities and the Mexican consulate fighting over who would handle the bodies. Local newspapers reported a \\"macabre funeral hassle\\". Ultimately the dispute was resolved, the town was allowed to participate, and 9,000 people attended the funeral, which was held at Palma High School in Salinas.  Court proceedings and investigations  Espinosa was arrested and charged with 32 counts of felony manslaughter, which were later reduced to misdemeanor counts after a grand jury recommended leniency. He claimed he did not hear or see the train approaching, and was acquitted in December 1963 after a four-day trial. An Interstate Commerce Commission investigation blamed the accident on him for failure to exercise \\"due caution\\" at the crossing. The ICC determined that Espinosa had \\"an unobstructed view of the railroad throughout a considerable distance,\\" and that \\"the driver could have readily observed the approaching northbound train if he had looked southward along the track.\\" Espinosa, in fear of retribution, fled California after his acquittal. In September 1964, a state official, who was seeking to serve notice of revocation of his driver's license, reported that his sister-in-law said Espinosa had been slain in Mexico by relatives of crash victims. That account was disputed. In 1967, a federal court lawsuit filed by the victims' families was settled by payment of $1.5 million. The sum was divided among 24 injured and 164 heirs of workers killed in the crash, most of whom lived in Mexico. The defendants in the suit were the Southern Pacific Railroad, Growers Farm Labor Association, Harden Farms and Myers Corporations of Salinas. The State Compensation Fund had already paid $450,000 to beneficiaries and was expected to pay $400,000 more. In 2014, a crash survivor recalled receiving 92,000 Mexican pesos as compensation in 1968. = Galarza inquiry = Ernesto Galarza, a Mexican- American labor activist, was appointed to investigate the tragedy by Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor of the U.S. House of Representatives. His investigation was opposed by the California Farm Bureau Federation, which contended that Galarza was biased, and met with local suspicion and hostility, as well as lack of cooperation from Demco Farms, the owner of the bus. Galarza reported that Espinosa was kept in seclusion, preventing him from giving testimony, and that Southern Pacific declined to permit inspection of its equipment until some time after the accident. His report also stated that survivor testimony was not put on the record of the Espinosa trial or any hearing. Galarza found that Espinosa was a diabetic, which curbed his field of vision, and the foreman sitting to his right impaired his view of the oncoming train. Although Espinosa's defense at the trial was that his field of view was limited by telephone poles and signal posts, as well as by his diabetes, Galarza had not found any manmade objects obstructing his view of the railroad track. Galarza also questioned how Espinosa could have obtained his chauffeur's license, since he did not speak English. His investigation concluded that the accident exemplified the growers' disregard for the safety of the bracero workers. He found that the accident was directly caused by negligence, exemplifying a practice in which flatbed trucks were illegally converted to buses, driven by poorly trained personnel, which had caused several other bus crashes causing multiple fatalities. He recommended that regulation of transportation of migrant workers be improved. Galarza's 72-page report to the House Education and Labor Committee was published in April 1964. He also wrote a book on the accident and its aftermath, Tragedy at Chualar, which was published in 1977. Legacy The accident has long been a rallying point for immigration rights and Chicano farmworker activists. All but two of the victims were Mexican or Mexican- American, and most were Mexican guest workers participating in the bracero program, which had been in place since 1942 and had been drawing mounting criticism from labor activists and civil rights workers who contended that it exploited Mexican laborers and deprived Americans of jobs. The accident supported the views of critics that Bracero workers were treated shabbily, helping to spur the demise of the program in 1964. The accident was a reminder of the braceros' vulnerability as guest workers in the United States. Union leaders and Mexican-American activists contended that the tragedy demonstrated the inequities in the bracero program, which they contended exploited Mexicans while displacing American workers. It spurred the development of the Chicano civil rights movement. The lead locomotive of the train, SP 5857, was repaired and put back into service, later being renumbered #2922. A crash test and approximate recreation of the collision was conducted in the 1980s with a Union Pacific Railroad GE U30C locomotive and an unoccupied school bus. Coincidentally, the locomotive used for the crash test was numbered 2922. Two survivors of the bus crash were still alive as of 2014.  Commemorations  The portion of Route 101 where the accident occurred was named \\"Bracero Memorial Highway\\" at the 50th anniversary of the accident in 2013. At that time two survivors of the crash were still alive.

He successively practiced jobs as pharmacy clerk, bookseller and tramway worker. His interest in the artistic representation manifested itself early. At the age of fifteen, he began frequenting the Foyer du soldat where he played skits and sang songs (he was a visionary and eccentric comic singer), becoming accustomed to venues. He precociously became familiar with drama. He attended galas Karsenty and performances by Georges Abiad and Azzedine's Egyptian theatre companies in the early twenties. This encounter with theater gave him the idea to produce plays. He thus began to produce sketches which dealt with subjects drawn primarily from everyday life: marriage, divorce, alcoholism. These themes were also included in the plays staged after 1926. Contacts with European and especially Edmond Yafil, a great connoisseur of Algerian classical music who devoted his life to the development of this art, made him understand and appreciate music. Allalou died on February 20, 1992, in Algiers.

Information is learned from many different sources and source monitoring (see also source-monitoring error) is important in understanding how people use information and decide which information is credible. Consider the example of a parent whose child has been diagnosed with hyperactivity; the parent searches the internet for information, reads books, participates in an online chat room with other parents in the same situation, and consults various medical professionals. Some of these sources will be credible (contain reliable information), and others will not. To be well-informed, the parent must filter information according to the reliability of the source. Children learn about the world in much the same way. They are told things by numerous people (e.g., teachers, parents, siblings, and friends), see things on the television or internet, and read information in books. Can children be effective consumers of information? At what age are they able to do this? How do they deal with ambiguous resources? This page will detail answers to those questions (and others) by drawing on peer-reviewed scientific research. The development of source monitoring Young children have more difficulty with understanding and recalling the sources of information than adults do. Although episodic memory improves throughout childhood, development in the area of source monitoring tends to occur between the ages of 3 and 8 years. At 3 years, children who are able to immediately recognize the source of the information they obtain have difficulty recalling this information after a short delay. The development of source monitoring is gradual, and children achieve and display competency in certain aspects of source monitoring before others. The developmental trajectory of source monitoring provides insight into what cognitive factors are necessary prerequisites. While there is no generally accepted unified theory for the development of source monitoring, five major theories contribute ideas about how source monitoring develops in children: source monitoring theory, fuzzy-trace theory, schema theory, person- based perspective, and the mental-state reasoning model. =Source monitoring theory= According to source monitoring theory, the source of information is attributed through a decision-making process, where source is inferred based on various characteristics inherent in the memory itself. This means that the sources are not directly encoded, but rather reconstructed, when information is recalled. This decision-making process can either be through automatic, unconscious processing, or through heightened demanding and systematic processing that may require reasoning, and the retrieval of supporting memories. This theory implicates the development of episodic memory and memory strategies in the development of source monitoring more generally. =Fuzzy- trace theory= Fuzzy-trace theory hypothesizes that the source-monitoring errors that children make are caused by problems with memory storage and retrieval. Memories are simultaneously stored in two different formats: the \\"gist\\" level (extracted from the experience), and the \\"verbatim\\" representation (information in exact detail). It is proposed that the source of information is encoded in memory as a verbatim detail. Memories for verbatim details decay more quickly over time than gist representations, and young children demonstrate faster decay of verbatim information than older children or adults. Younger children are more likely to experience memory intrusions due to weaker memory traces, which leads to a susceptibility to misleading information replacing memory traces from a previous event. For this reason, developmental changes in episodic memory performance are viewed as the driving factor in source monitoring development. =Schema theory= Schema theory, as a derivative of script theory, states that after repeated exposure to similar events, individuals form a general representation of what typically happens.Farrar, M. J., & Goodman, G. S. (1990). Developmental differences in the relation between scripts and episodic memory: Do they exist? In Knowing and remembering in young children, Fivush, Robyn, Hudson, Judith A. eds., (pp. 30-64). Cambridge University Press, New York, NY Some details are the same at each instance of repeated events, and others can vary from instance to instance. In the script for what usually happens, there is a \\"slot\\" for each variable detail and the detail for a particular time is chosen from a list of possible variations. If source information is encoded as a slot, errors in source monitoring can be the result of incorrect retrieval of a specific detail. This framework allows for the storage of a large amount of detailed information about specific events, however is very cognitively demanding for children. Because of their limited cognitive resources, young children require more experience with repeated events in order to generate a schema. Details that vary from instance to instance can be lost, and children rely instead on the generalized event representation when attempting to recall a particular instance. The main assumption is that the development of source monitoring depends on an increase in cognitive processing capacity. =Person-based perspective= Person-based perspective emphasizes prospective processes. Prospective processes relate actions to one another through operations such as sequencing and planning. These processes are affected by the perspective taken (self vs. other) or the goals and meaning to the individual. The meaning attached to the goal of an action can interfere with source monitoring by removing attention from the source details. The person-based perspective is social-cognitive in nature (more so than other theories of source monitoring) and assumes that development is reliant on socialization and theory of mind development. =Mental-state reasoning model= The mental-state reasoning model highlights possible mechanisms behind young children's suggestibility.Welch-Ross, M. (2000). A mental-state reasoning model of suggestibility and memory source monitoring. In Children's source monitoring, Roberts, Kim P., Blades, Mark, eds., (pp. 227-255). Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers, Mahwah, NJ Children who have difficulty with reasoning about conflicting mental representations are likely to overwrite their original memories with misinformation because they cannot reconcile two contradicting views of what actually occurred. Source monitoring and the understanding of knowledge states, play a key role in resisting suggestions. The development of source monitoring is presumed to be based on better understanding of knowledge states, metacognition and theory of mind. The origins of knowledge Being aware of how we have acquired information is particularly difficult for young children (specifically 3 to 5 year-olds). After feeling a soft ball, 3 and 4 year-olds can correctly identify whether they know the ball is soft or hard, but cannot always say how they know. Perhaps it is because they felt the ball, saw the ball, or were told it was soft. The ability to recognize the origin of their knowledge requires the understanding of how knowledge is acquired. =Knowledge and justification= When asked knowledge questions (\\"Do you know what is in the box?\\") then justification questions (\\"How do [or why don't] you know what is in the box?\\"), children who can correctly answer are able to reflect on knowledge that they have gained from a particular source and should be able to identify the source of information. 3 and 4 year-olds are better at answering these questions when the questions refer to themselves in comparison to referring to another person. When these children are shown a hidden object they can correctly report their perceptual access (responding correctly to \\"Did you look into the box?\\") and their knowledge access of what is in the box (responding correctly to \\"Do you know [not know] what is in the box?\\"). Despite their ability to answer correctly when referring to the self, 3 and 4 year-olds have difficulty responding to the \\"other's\\" knowledge, where they deny the \\"other\\" has the knowledge. 3-4 year-olds can correctly identify that the other person has in fact looked in a box, but when asked \\"Does [other] know what is in the box?\\" the child will deny that the other person knows what is in the box. The key assumption is then that although children are aware that perceptual access is needed, they are unable to acknowledge that the knowledge was gained from perceptual access. =Gaining knowledge through looking, touching, and asking= Gaining knowledge is knowing how to acquire new information. The ability to recognize how specific knowledge can be gained by perceptual access (looking, feeling or smelling) is the understanding of Aspectuality. Aspectuality understanding is the awareness that an object is made up of many different properties (colour, weight, odour), which can be determined by a specific perceptual action (looking, feeling, smelling). Identifying the colour of a car outside the window could involve asking someone for the information or looking out the window. In most cases, adults would acquire this knowledge from simply looking out the window. However, not all information can be gained in this manner. If you were asked to find out how old the driver of the car is, simply looking would not provide accurate information; you would have to ask. These two situations are dependent on whether the information being sought out is visible or invisible (respectively). Knowledge development depends on children's ability to efficiently pursue their informational goal. Children do not always make the most effective or efficient decision when acquiring new information. Age differences 6 year-olds are able to distinguish when gaining knowledge requires looking (the information is visible) or when gaining knowledge requires asking (the information is invisible). However, 4 year-olds do not perform as consistently. Even with an expert present, 4 year-olds will overestimate the knowledge they can gain through looking. However, when the information to be gained is regarding a group of friends and the expert is a friend of the group, 4 year-olds tend to overestimate knowledge acquisition through asking. When given access to pairs of objects, which could either be identified by seeing (identical objects: different in colour) or by touch/feeling (identical objects: 1 soft, 1 hard), children perform relatively well, generally recognizing when they have adequate information and when they have inadequate information (i.e., knowing the object is blue after seeing it or knowing the object is soft after feeling it). But, when young children are not given access (of seeing or feeling), they have difficulty predicting and identifying which mode of access would allow them to identify the object. In this case, 3 and 4 year-olds overestimate the knowledge that could be gained through feeling the object. 3 to 4 year-olds may not understand the perceptual access needed to acquire the specific knowledge. =Language and question phrasing= Waters and Beck (2012) state \\"understanding the link between perceptual access and consequent information (knowledge access) is a crucial component in the development of theory of mind\\". In a typical adult population, change in the phrasing of a particular question would not affect the understanding of what action needs to occur. \\"What colour is the bike that is outside?\\" or \\"Is the bike red?\\" should not change the action of looking to gain the needed information. However, children's performance is susceptible to this type of question phrasing. There are language effects on knowledge access through 3 different question types: #Identity: \\"Find out which one is in the tunnel\\", #Dimension: \\"Find out what colour the one in the tunnel is\\" #Aspect: \\"Find out if the one in the tunnel is the red one or the blue one\\". 4 and 5 year-olds are more likely to respond correctly to aspect and dimension questions in comparison to identity questions. Aspect and dimension questions are more explicit, which may be why performance is better in these categories. Identity questions require more cognitive effort as one has to remember how the objects were similar and how they differed. Judging the credibility of sources and understanding of trust Much of people's knowledge about the world is not obtained from direct experience, but indirectly from what other people or sources tell them. With widespread use of the internet people have access to nearly unlimited sources of information. Some of that information might be conflicting, and different sources of information vary in their accuracy and credibility. People can also deliberately deceive, be misunderstood, or be mistaken. It is important that people develop the necessary skills to assess the accuracy of what they are being told. =Adults' credibility judgments= Adults make credibility judgments based on two factors: expertise and trustworthiness. For example, we might trust information from published research articles more than information from blogs because we know that anyone can write a blog, but scientists (experts) who write peer-reviewed articles are highly trained. With regards to trustworthiness, adults are less likely to believe someone who they think is trying to deceive them, and they take into account the intentions of the information-provider. For example, if someone's intention is to sell you something, you might be more skeptical of the accuracy of the information they provide because their motives cause you to question their honesty. Adults can effectively use these cues to make judgments about the credibility of different sources, but whether children can also do so is an important area for research. =Children's ability to make credibility judgments= Even very young children show an early sensitivity to issues of source credibility. By the age of 4, children show similar patterns to adults in a preference for perception over testimony; that is, they would rather see something with their own eyes than be told about it. Children also feel more confident in their knowledge when they have directly perceived it than if they have been told by someone else, even if the speaker is well informed. However, children are not always able to directly perceive information, and they learn much of what they know from others. Some people are more credible sources of information than others, so children must actively evaluate information and decide whether or not to believe it. There are many factors or cues that children, by the age of 4, take into consideration when making judgements about whether or not to trust what a person says. For instance, knowledge and experience, traits, motivations, age, and reasoning or support. Credibility judgments based on knowledge and experience Young children have a reputation for credulity, or believing something without having any proof that it is true. Young children often trust what adults tell them, especially when they have no prior knowledge or expectations about the topic of the testimony. Because children tend to interact with adults who are more knowledgeable than themselves, if they have no reason to believe otherwise, they will trust what adults tell them. In particular, 3 year-olds tendency to believe others is based on a selective bias to trust what people tell them. This selective trust is adaptive in the early years as they are learning language and their way around the world. Children have difficulty disregarding information provided to them, even if the source has been unreliable in the past. 3 year-olds will often continue to believe what a person tells them even after being repeatedly deceived by that person, but 4 year-olds are far better able to disregard this unreliable information. Three-year-olds are better at making trust judgments when they are able to choose between two sources of knowledge, rather than deciding whether or not to believe a single person, and in this situation they are often able to choose the more reliable of two speakers. By age 4, young children take an informant's knowledge, expertise, and reliability into account in order to avoid learning from unreliable or problematic sources. They believe statements made by knowledgeable speakers more than ignorant speakers, before they can explicitly answer questions about who has access to knowledge. They also prefer to seek information from sources who have been knowledgeable in the past. 4 year-olds can spontaneously use others' past performance to guide their learning. Credibility judgments based on traits and motivation Almost all human institutions (e.g., family, community, business, government) are built on a foundation of trust. There are many factors that influence children's trust in people and one of the most important is honesty.Bacon, F. (1999). Selected philosophical works. Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc. There are various schools of philosophical thought that posits honesty to be morally right and lying to be morally wrong. On one end of the continuum, philosophers like Bok,Bok, S. (1978). Lying: Moral choice in public and private life. New York, NY: Random House. Kant,Kant, I. (1949). On a supposed right to lie from altruistic motives. In L.W. Beck (Ed.), Critical of practical reason and other writings (pp.346‚Äì350). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. and St. AugustineAugustine, St. (1952). Treaties on various issues. Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press. hold a deontological view that focuses on intrinsic duties relating to the treatment of others. In other words, telling the truth is intrinsically right and lying is intrinsically wrong. On the other end of the continuum is the utilitarian view that emphasizes the greater good, specifically with respect to the outcome of one's act. Therefore, lying and its moral implications are context dependent.see for example, Austin, J. L. (1962). How to do things with words. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. In some situations, such as when being polite to spare another person's feelings, making a \\"prosocial lie\\" or deliberate false statement are endorsed. Children consider motivation, as well as traits, when deciding whom to seek information from and whom to believe. In both Eastern and Western cultures, both adults and children adhere to the utilitarian perspective when giving moral evaluations of truths and lies in different social situations. In terms of people's characteristics, children tend to place trust in people who are honest, smart, or kind over people who are dishonest, not smart, or not kind. However, they also consider a person's intent or motivation. From age 7, children consider both honesty and benevolence when making trust judgments about other people, and older children are more likely to trust people who tell prosocial lies (to avoid hurting another person's feelings or to help another person) than young children. For younger children, honesty is more important than a person's intention. As children get older, they increasingly attend to motivation as a key factor. The relationship between telling the truth and trusting a person is stable, but when it comes to lying, children consider the motivation of the speaker when deciding whether or not to trust them. Credibility judgments based on age and reliability Children evaluate the credibility of a speaker by evaluating how reliable that person has been in the past and can make predictions about a speaker based on their age. Children as young as 3 years- old prefer to trust an unfamiliar adult rather than an unfamiliar child. When considering both age and reliability, age is often the primary cue used to determine another's credibility. For example, 3 and 4 year-olds found adults to be more trustworthy than peers, unless the peer demonstrated greater reliability (i.e., adult incorrectly mislabelled objects, whereas peer correctly labelled them). Children also consider both the prior history of accuracy and the level of perceptual access the speaker has when they provide information. Young children spontaneously keep track of the prior history of a person's accuracy or inaccuracy (reliability) and prefer to learn from someone with a good track record. Children commonly interpret the speaker's history of inaccuracy as a lasting trait and so the speaker is considered an unreliable informant, at least within the domain they have been wrong about. However, under certain conditions, children may excuse a person's past inaccuracy and later trust that person for information. If a speaker has limited information (e.g., lack of perceptual access) in making a claim ‚Äì for example, inaccurately identifying a toy while blindfolded ‚Äì then children as young as 3 years-old appropriately excuse their past inaccuracy especially when they are later well-informed. On the other hand, if a speaker has full access to information while making an inaccurate claim, children continue to regard him/her as unreliable. Credibility judgments based on reasoning or support Young children appreciate that people generally think and act sensibly when reasons are present, and they can evaluate a claim by assessing the quality of the reasoning provided. Thus, children create an epistemic profile of a person based on the quality of the reasons they offer when making a claim. As young as 3 years-old, children understand the difference between weak versus strong reasoning to support a statement. Children are more likely to trust someone when strong support is provided through: reliable testimony (\\"My teacher told me there's a book in the bag. I think that there's a book\\"), looking (\\"Before I came here, I looked and saw a ball in the bag. I think there's a ball in there\\"), and inference (\\"It's a backpack. Backpack holds books. I think there's a book in there\\"). On the other hand, desire (\\"I like crayons. I want there to be crayons in the bag. I think that there are crayons in there\\"), pretense (\\"I like to pretend. I'm going to pretend that there's a sandwich in the bag. I think there's a sandwich in there\\"), and guessing (\\"I don't know. I'm going to guess that there's a toy in the bag\\") are not viewed as strong support for a claim. Children recognize that the mental states that they and others may hold are not always reliable means for drawing specific conclusions. 3 and 4 year-olds can also choose the more reasonable of two people and continue to seek, as well as, accept new information from the more credible person (the one who had better reasons in the past). =Children's development of distrust= People are not always reliable in their provision of information and it is important to be able to differentiate between good sources and bad sources. Assessing someone's reliability is based not only on the knowledgeability of the speaker, but their motives/intentions as well. People may not always be motivated to tell the truth; instead, they may potentially lie to promote their own interest, or the interest of others. At about the age they begin preschool, children become better at distinguishing between helpful and deceptive people. 3 year-olds are not able to identify who is trying to help or trick another person and accept advice from both helpers and trickers. On the other hand, 4 year-olds are more sceptical and could differentiate between helpers and trickers, but have no preference in choosing whom to accept advice from. There may be a mismatch between knowledge and behaviour among 4 year-olds, in which they do not understand the implications of their knowledge or how to successfully apply it to their behaviour. 5 year- olds systematically preferred advice from helpers. Ultimately theory of mind, or children's understanding of mental states, is related to selective trust in helpers (versus trickers). Beginning at 5 years-old, children use a person's prior history of deception to make reliability judgments about that person.  Metacognition  Metacognition is an ability that allows people to think about their own thinking process, and how to use their thinking process to help themselves learn better. Metacognition includes two separate abilities: (1) knowledge of cognition and (2) regulation of cognition.Brown, A. L. (1987). Metacognition, executive control, self-regulation, and other more mysterious mechanisms. In F. E. Weinert & R. H. Kluwe (Eds.), Metacognition, motivation, and understanding (pp. 65-116). Hillsdale, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. Knowledge of one's thinking process is not enough to regulate an individual's behaviour, and are required to use specific strategies to help them regulate their behaviour. =Knowing you don't know= An important skill children need to learn is being able to identify when a message is incomplete and they don't have enough information to make an accurate interpretation. Being aware that an ambiguous situation has arisen is difficult for young children. Children accurately \\"know when they know\\", but often overestimate when they don't know. Children's behaviour does not seem to match their verbal ability to acknowledge their \\"lack of knowledge\\". Despite incorrectly stating that they \\"know\\" something, children are still capable of changing their response upon hearing contradicting information to an initial interpretation and/or event. Language plays an important role in children's accuracy in assessing their own knowledge. For children to accurately \\"know what they know\\" it is important for them to understand the various meanings of the word \\"know\\" as well as language used to describe certainty and uncertainty. =Children's judgments about ignorant and ambiguous sources= Ambiguous information is \\"a piece of information (word, message, or view) with multiple interpretations\\". Adults not only have the awareness to realize when ambiguity exists, but they also have strategies to deal with ambiguous input. Young children have difficulty with recognizing ambiguity and understanding how to handle it. Typically, it is not until the age of 6 or 7 that children have the ability to successfully deal with ambiguous input. However, it seems in certain contexts with certain tasks, younger children also display some ability to deal with ambiguous information.Mitchell, P . & Robinson, E. J. (1992). Children's understanding of the evidential connotation of 'know' in relation to overestimation of their own knowledge, Journal of Child Language, 19, 167-182. =The role of language and prior experience= Language can play an important role in the ability to correctly decipher ambiguous input. One can \\"know\\" someone in many different ways, for example, seeing them, talking to them, having a prior history with them, etc. This makes questions like \\"Do you know?\\" very complicated and difficult to respond to. More explicit definitions of \\"to know\\" seem to assist children in better assessing their own knowledge. Children as young as 4 years were able to make far more accurate statements about their actual knowledge when a question was phrased \\"Have you heard of\\" rather than \\"Do you know\\". By the age of 6, children are typically able to accurately assess their knowledge with very little impact on their future behaviours regardless of the language used. 4-5 year-old's, on the other hand, were so susceptible to change that the phrase used altered their response to future questions. 4-5 year-old's were also less likely to overestimate their knowledge of a target person if the initial question was phrased \\"Have you heard of\\" rather than \\"Do you know\\". Not only can responses from children be altered by the phrasing of the question, but the suggestion of lack of prior experience with the target is enough for children to change their response. In a study where children were asked if they really knew who a specific person was (between 2 pictures of people they had never seen before), they were more accurate in assessing that they didn't know when it was suggested that the target person had never been to the child's city before. While experience is important, children tend not to over-rely on prior experiences and only use it when they've had significant experience that would actually assist them in assessing their knowledge. =Partial information= Sometimes when confronted with ambiguous information, more than one piece of information is required to make and accurate interpretation. For example, in a study where children had to pick one of four pictures presented to them after hearing ambiguous information, they were capable of making tentative interpretations and then correctly changing their interpretations upon hearing contradicting, clarifying information. This strategy uses multiple pieces of information and has been seen in children as young as 15 months old. In situations where only partial information is available, young children make the best interpretation possible with the information given and go on to change this interpretation only when contradicting information emerges. =Delaying interpretation= The presentation of clarifying information is not always immediately accessible. In these situations, adults seem to delay interpretation and seek clarifying information when appropriate. Even more difficult than acknowledging that an ambiguous situation has arisen, is children's understanding in what actions they need to take for clarification. There are 2 different types of delay in interpreting ambiguous information: one that is intentional and one that is instinctual. The explicit decision to delay interpretation and seek further information is a difficult one as it involves being aware that the current information is not sufficient, and knowing how to acquire appropriate information necessary for clarification. Children are typically not successful in this process until the age of 7. However, when this explicit decision to delay is simplified, children aged 5 and up showed some ability in successfully choosing to delay their response. While the ability for intentionally delaying interpretation seems to be difficult, the ability to delay interpretation instinctively seems to be easier for young children. In one example, children were asked to stamp the correct snowman once they knew which one it was. Their knowledge of the correct snowman was based on a researcher slowly revealing the target snowman. The children's cards contained snowmen that differed by some feature visible on the 2nd half of the snowman only and therefore the children were required to wait until the 2nd half of the snowman was revealed in order to accurately assess which snowman was the correct one. In this scenario focusing on instinct, children as young as 5 were able to accurately delay interpretation. Therefore, while it is difficult for children to explicitly demonstrate their awareness of an ambiguous situation and how to resolve it, they are implicitly able to handle situations in which delaying interpretation may be beneficial. =Referents and meaning= It is difficult for younger children to grasp the idea that objects can be referred to in different ways and that people can have partial knowledge of the different references (i.e. a \\"bouncy ball\\" might also be referred to as a \\"rubber sphere\\"). A child might know by looking that a toy is a toy truck, but they may not be aware that the toy truck is also a present. Referential opacity is the concept of whether or not referring to an object changes its meaning. If something is referentially transparent (substitution insensitive), altering the referent term does not alter the meaning, and something that is referentially opaque (substitution sensitive) means that altering the referent term would alter the meaning. An example of this is a study with a puppet named Heinz. There is a ball in a box and children are told that Heinz knows that there is a ball in the box but does not know that the ball is a present. Children are then asked substitution- insensitive questions (i.e. Does Heinz know the ball is a present? ‚Äì asking, \\"Does Heinz know the rubber sphere is a present?\\" does not alter the meaning of the question) and substitution sensitive questions (i.e. Does Heinz know there's a present in the box? ‚Äì asking \\"Does Heinz know there is a rubber sphere in the box\\" does alter the meaning of the question). Regardless of age, substitution-insensitive questions seem to be easier than substitution- sensitive questions. The ability to correctly answer substitution-sensitive questions improves with age. The ability to answer these types of questions is closely related to effectively evaluating ambiguous messages. Success on substitution-insensitive questions is necessary but not sufficient for success on evaluation ambiguous messages. Alternatively, success on substitution- sensitive questions is necessary and sufficient for success at evaluating ambiguous messages. = Physical and epistemic uncertainty = Children can change their interpretation of information based on the context in which the interpretation is made. Robinson and colleagues (2006) studied children's interpretation of information in two different: physical and epistemic uncertainty. Physical uncertainty occurs when an event has not yet happened, and therefore the outcome of that event has not been determined (i.e. the dice has not yet been rolled). Epistemic uncertainty occurs when an event has already occurred, but the child is not aware of the outcome of the event (i.e. the dice have been rolled, but the dice are hidden from the participant). 4 to 8 year old children have the ability to realize multiple possibilities for an event that has not yet occurred (physical uncertainty), however they do not seem to acknowledge that there are exactly the same possibilities for an event that has already happened when they don't know the outcome (epistemic uncertainty). Under the conditions of epistemic uncertainty, children simply guess one of the possibilities. Beck and colleagues (2011) propose that this happens because it is much easier to imagine the outcome during epistemic uncertainty, basically knowing that there is only one outcome. Similarly, adults also prefer to make predictions or guess in epistemic uncertainty. = Feeling-of-knowing (FOK) = Feeling-of-knowing occurs when people are unable to easily recall a memory or a fact, but they know that they learned it and are able to recognize it, such as in a multiple-choice test.Nelson, T.O., & Narens, L. (1994). Why investigate metacognition? In J. Metcalife &A.P.; Shimamura (Eds.), Metacognition. Knowing about knowing (pp. 1‚Äì25). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. Adults' accuracy of feeling-of-knowing judgments is well above chance but not nearly perfect. It seems to be the same for children as well. Lockl and Schneider (2002) did not find any developmental trends in the accuracy of feeling-of-knowing judgments. Instead, similar to adults, children's accuracy of feeling-of knowing judgments was low, but still above chance for all age groups studied (grade 1 through grade 4). Getting a child to attend to this feeling-of-knowing (through language or prompting of prior experience) is one way to assist them in more accurately assessing their actual knowledge, allowing them to handle ambiguous situations at a much younger age. Forensic applications Children are highly susceptible to a \\"suggestibility effect\\", producing \\"false memories\\" and/or \\"incorrect, post- event information\\" (see misinformation effect) when asked to engage in memory recall. This has important implications for forensic interviewing and child witness testimony. Consider the prominent case of Kelly Michael's (see Wee Care Nursery School abuse trial), where improper interviewing techniques lead to a miscarriage of justice. In order to develop reliable and age-appropriate instruments for interviewing children, it is imperative to consider their cognitive development, verbal and mental abilities. =Forensic interviews and techniques= Factors that can impact disclosure It is critical for a forensic interviewer to recognize their power during an interview, especially with a child witness. An interviewer can impact the course of a child's testimony in numerous ways, including: * Eliciting \\"false allegations\\" through leading and suggestive questions * Determining the amount of detail a child may disclose * Prevent a child from disclosing * Interviewer's gender may also impact the quality and details of disclosure. Children between the ages of 4 and 6 are more likely to disclose to an interviewer of the same gender. The age of a child is also an important factor during interviewing. Younger children are more likely to provide shorter, less detailed accounts of an event in comparison to older children. Preschool children are more likely to disclose information in an \\"accidental way\\" through triggers and obvious cues, whereas older school children are more likely to make \\"intentional disclosures\\" based on the nature of the question they are asked. Improper interviewing There are varying techniques and extraneous factors that can influence the way a child discloses an event during child witness testimony (e.g., experiences of abuse by a parent or caregiver). There are two major types of barriers in forensic interviews: (1) improper interviewing and (2) clumsy interviewing Improper interviewing includes forensic techniques that are considered to be \\"risky and ineffective\\". Each of the following techniques can create critically negative consequences in witness testimony and result in false allegations or the potential for a reduced conviction: # Use of reinforcement: If an interviewer utilizes rewards and punishments to coerce disclosure # Social influence: If an interviewer informs a child of another child's disclosure or recollection # Asking suggestive or leading questions: This can occur when an interviewer provides a child with information that has not been previously known # Removing the child from direct experience: For example, asking a child \\"what might have happened\\" Clumsy interviewing involves interviews that fail to include best practices and recommended techniques. Interviewers who are not properly trained in forensic techniques can fail to follow structured interview guidelines and impact the outcome of a child's testimony and/or responses to questioning. This type of interviewing most often occurs when an interviewer lacks skill, forgets important procedures, and when there is a lack of necessary supervision. In order to prevent improper forensic interviewing, numerous methods to reduce suggestibility and the misinformation effect have been proven effective, including: taping interviews, recording transcripts, ensuring supervision by a qualified professional, experience in working with children, training in forensic interviewing, and maintaining a comfortable, safe environment. Types of interviewing The cognitive interview utilizes cognitive theory as a focal point in its interview methodology. The cognitive interview, first developed in 1992 by researchers Fisher and Geiselman, was originally developed for adults and later modified for children. It utilizes two major perspectives from cognitive theory, including the \\"encoding specificity principle\\" and a \\"multi-component view of memory traces\\". Specifically, this method utilizes four major techniques: # Report everything: i.e., \\"tell me everything you remember\\" # Context reinstatement: i.e., \\"think back to where you were at the time\\" # Reverse order: i.e., \\"now that you told me what happened, try to remember it again but this time starting at the end and recounting it in reverse chronological order\\" # Change perspective: i.e., \\"what would the perpetrator have seen and heard?\\" The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Protocol developed an investigative protocol in 2000 to create a structured interview technique for children, specifically those of child sexual abuse. It uses the following techniques: # Introductory phase: This is necessary for rapport building # Practice in free- recall: \\"Tell me about your last birthday party\\" # Information about the ground rules: \\"It's okay to say \\"I don't know\\"\\" # Open-ended questions: \\"Tell me why you came to talk to me\\" Stepwise interview utilizes open-ended questions through a \\"funnel-like strategy\\". It is primarily used by legal professionals, and is most often used in North America. This interview begins with open-ended questions and/or free recall and slowly incorporates more focused and detailed questions. Allegation blind interviews stress that an interviewer should refrain from gathering information prior to an interview in order to reduce suggestibility and increase interviewer patience and attentiveness. This also enhances the interviewer's ability to be non- judgmental and objective. Truth-lie discussions are most useful prior to commencing abuse-related questioning. This method allows the interviewer to create a baseline with the child about what the \\"truth\\" is and what a \\"lie\\" is. The interviewer is encouraged to ask questions with general examples, such as \\"tell me a lie about this chair\\". This strategy has been proven to result in a less misinformed child testimony. Touch survey was developed on the basis that \\"touch falls on a continuum\\", and is beneficial to screen for child abuse. It includes questions surrounding the child's experiences with touch (e.g., kissing, hugging, hitting), including where they have been touched and by whom. This tool might be more useful when used in conjunction with other forensic strategies. =Recommendations for forensic interviewing= Although there are varying suggestions for structured forensic interviewing, experts provide context into best practices that can significantly reduce suggestibility, false memories and the misinformation effect: # Interviews should be conducted in a safe, child-friendly environment. # A child's age should be considered when being interviewed, and practices should be modified accordingly. # Structured interview protocol should always be utilized. # Interviewers should engage in professional training when possible. # Ground rules are essential for the beginning of the interview so that the child is aware of the type of responses they can provide (e.g., \\"I don't know\\").

It was established in 1911 by Sommerstorff, who originally considered it to be an oomycete. It is common in a variety of freshwater habitats, such as ponds and sewage treatment plants. Morphology The mycelium is composed of non- septate hyphae that bear lateral adhesive pegs. Spores are sometimes septate long, fusiform merosporangia with tapered ends that are borne on lateral sporangiophores. Hyphae of Zoophagus insidians collected from a moss path in an intermittent stream/drainage ditch (Coventry Township, Summit County, Ohio, USA) with a trapped rotifer. Ecology Zoophagus species have been reported from ponds, brooks, and fens, usually in association with algae or decaying plant matter. Exceptions are Z. cornus, which was described from rice paddy mud, and Z. pectosporus, which was described from moss and additionally reported from leaf litter. Zoophagus insidians in particular has also been reported from sewage treatment plants where it can pose a significant threat to water quality. Zoophagus spp. prey on a variety of rotifer species. Zoophagus pectosporus primarily preys on nematodes and seems to be restricted to species of Bunonema, though it is also capable of trapping rotifers. When prey encounter one of the traps, an adhesive is released and the animal is caught. Hyphae later grow into the body and digest it.

It is native to the eastern United States and Canada. The female builds a miniature pot out of mud in which it lays an egg and places a live caterpillar. Its developing larva feeds on this whereas the adult wasp feeds primarily on nectar. Description Wasps in the genus Eumenes can be recognised by the fact that the first abdominal segment is long and slender, very thin at the front and widening towards the back. Eumenes fraternus is about long and is similar in appearance to other members of the genus. Its colouring is black with a scattering of ivory-coloured markings. The forewings are long in the male and in the female. It has shorter pubescence on the first segment of the antenna than do the otherwise similar E. crucifera and E. verticalis. Distribution and habitat Eumenes fraternus is found in the eastern United States and Canada. Its range extends west as far as Ontario, Minnesota, Kansas and Texas. It is on the wing from about April to November in North Carolina and is found in glades, rough shrubby areas and forest verges. Biology Potter wasp's nests in Arkansas Like other members of the genus, the female Eumenes fraternus builds a pitcher-shaped nest in which to lay an egg. This is made with mud, the wasp collecting a drop of water and then a dry particle of soil, dampening the soil and putting it in place. Several hundred such fragments will be needed and the pot may take one or two hours to build. When it is ready, the wasp inserts her abdomen into the hollow interior and lays an egg, suspending it on a fine thread. She then searches for suitable food to put inside the pot on which her developing larva may feed. Usually this is the larva of a butterfly or moth that has been stung to paralyse it and which will remain alive and fresh until the developing wasp larva needs it. When she has placed enough provisions in the pot, the wasp seals the top with damp soil and goes off to build another nest. The adult insects feed mainly on nectar that they gather from flowers, but they also feed on pollen with its higher protein content.

Initially a solo project by Paul Rooney, an artist and musician, the project became a gigging band when Colin Cromer and Ian S Jackson joined in 1999 prior to the band's first and only John Peel session that year. The project ended in 2002 when Paul Rooney decided to focus on other performance projects and gallery works. Rooney were musically reminiscent of lo-fi contemporaries such as Arab Strap, Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, and Spare Snare, earlier bands like Sebadoh and (early) Pavement, along with northern English post-punk (particularly Half Man Half Biscuit and The Fall). The band's approach to lyrics ‚Äî the deadpan delivery of absurdly banal descriptions of insignificant objects and events ‚Äî is, however, quite unique.  History  Rooney at the Magnet, Liverpool, 1999 Artist Paul Rooney recorded the first Rooney EP (this is not the US band of the same name), Got Up Late, in October 1997 in Newcastle-under-Lyme, using a mini-disc four-track recorder with Paul Rooney on all instruments and vocals. Initially only five copies were self-released on Common Culture Records. The lo-fi music incorporated sometimes humorous ‚Äî but often unsettling ‚Äî spoken-sung lyrics describing everyday, mundane activities and observations, an approach which was consistent across all Rooney releases.Bracewell, Michael. 'The Art of Paul Rooney', in Got Up Late the Other Day: Paul Rooney artist monograph. Firstsite, 2006. BBC Radio 1's John Peel and BBC Radio Merseyside's Roger Hill played tracks from the record, and from the subsequent EP Different Kinds of Road Signs. The debut album Time on Their Hands, released September 1998, was distributed by Cargo Records (UK), and featured the tracks Went to Town, Into The Lens, Throw Away, Touts, Scratched, Walked Round The Estate, and Fountainbridge amongst others. The writer Michael Bracewell described the album thus: '... [encountering] Time on Their Hands, 1998, by the group Rooney, the listener might be reminded of any and all of the following: Patrik Fitzgerald's dour requiem to hope, Tonight, the later songs of Ivor Cutler, the Intense Emotion Society of middle period Dexy's Midnight Runners, the industrial melancholy of Throbbing Gristle's Twenty Jazz Funk Greats and the ambiguous intellectualism of The Television Personalities, notably their re- issue, ...And Don't the Kids Just Love It.'

The album received extensive airplay, including BBC Radio 3's Mixing It. By 1999 Rooney had become a band with new members Colin Cromer and Half Man Half Biscuit/Jegsy Dodd and the Sons of Harry Cross ex-member Ian S Jackson (some of the final performances included Paul Rafferty, who was later a member of Hot Club de Paris), and were operating out of Liverpool, intermittently gigging at venues such as The Dublin Castle, London, and The Briton's Protection, Manchester.

Dec. 2000 though gigs continued sporadically until late 2002. In the years that followed Paul Rooney concentrated on artworks, however he also undertook a series of collaborative 'variety' performances, and toured a rock opera ‚Äì with various performers ‚Äì but this time as The NWRA House Band. He referred to the history (real and fictionalized) of the band Rooney in a number of his artworks and stories, references which usually centred on singer Dermot Bucknall from the pre-1997 period of the band. In 2006 comedian and writer Stewart Lee curated the Rooney track Into the Lens for the CD/book The Topography of Chance, which also included Mark E Smith, Derek Bailey and Simon Munnery. In 2014 the three Rooney albums were made available digitally on iTunes, Spotify and other streaming platforms, and the Rooney Peel session was repeated in 2016 on Gideon Coe's BBC 6 Music show. An EP of the session, entitled This Job's Forever - The Peel Session, was later released on Owd Scat Records in 2020. At time of writing there is muted to be an album of material from 2000-2006 planned.
