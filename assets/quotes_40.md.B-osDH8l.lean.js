Facts Mr Abernethy, a civil engineer, claimed unfair dismissal under the Industrial Relations Act 1971 section 24 from his firm of 20 years, Mott, Hay and Anderson, after declining a secondment to work for the Greater London Council and then being told he was redundant. He was offered ¬£850 in redundancy and ¬£750 ex gratia. They argued he was either redundant or incapable of doing the work the employers wanted him to do. The Tribunal held he was not redundant but the employers had shown he was incapable, and it was not unfair. The National Industrial Relations Court dismissed his appeal. Unwillingness to work related to capability. Judgment The Court of Appeal held the dismissal was fair, and the employer did not act unfairly by failing initially to give the principal reason to the employee for dismissal. Lord Denning MR said the following. Cairns LJ held that although the employer was wrong to say he was redundant to begin with, it could reformulate the real reason for dismissal as a different one, and if that was fair it was good. An employer could give a false reason because he wished to not hurt the worker‚Äôs feelings, though he might later have trouble giving evidence that the real reason was fair, and it could make a breach of procedural fairness in not giving the worker the accurate charge. Alternatively there could be a mistake of language. James LJ concurred.

In 1977, he founded the Journal of Pragmatics together with Jacob Mey. Currently, he is an editor of Pragmatics and Society together with Mey (Chief editor), Hermine Penz and Hans J√∏rgen Ladegaard, and an editor of Acta Linguistica Hafniensia, the journal of the Linguistic Circle of Copenhagen together with Lars Heltoft, Janus Mortensen, Sune S√∏nderberg Mortensen und Peter Juul Nielsen.Bent Preisler 2013. ‚ÄúHartmut Haberland‚Äù, The Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics, ed. Carol A. Chapelle. Blackwell Publishing Ltd. DOI: 10.1002/9781405198431.wbeal0488 The first widely known work by Haberland was a textbook, entitled \\"Soziologie + Linguistik. Die schlechte Aufhebung sozialer Ungleichheit durch Sprache\\" (Hager, Haberland, & Paris, 1973). This book was used at a number of universities in Europe for several years. The book was successful in establishing a point of view based on sociology in the study of language. The launching of the Journal of Pragmatics (with co-editor Jacob L. Mey) was a major achievement, because the journal aimed at the integration of linguistics, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, psychology, etc. Thus it militated against the Chomskian brand of linguistics which eschewed pragmatics or other aspects of language use confining them to a wastebasket (The Journal of Pragmatics did not take this garbage from the wastebasket to recycle it, but thought that language use in itself deserved being studied systematically). In fact, many seminal articles were published there, among which contributions by Asa Kasher, Raymond Gibbs, Frans van Eemeren and R Grootendorst, Yan Huang, Alessandro Ferrara, Mira Ariel, Rachel Giora, Sarah Blackwell, Alessandro Capone, Neal Norrick, Gunter Kress, Theodossia Pavlidou, Sophia Marmaridou, Richard Janney, Jef Verschueren, Johan van der Auwera, Sachiko Ide. Haberland has also done important work in the area of language contact and has expressed his views on the dangers of globalization, which has the effect of swallowing cultures as well as some of the domains of certain languages. In particular, he studied the process whereby English came to have such an influence on the Danish language that various areas of the lexicon were phagocytized by the English language, the latter language being in a position of power. Influenced by Gramsci's (Gramsci, 1992‚Äì6) ideas on power and ideology. Haberland launched the idea that hegemony (Gramsci, 1992‚Äì6) plays a role in the relationship between languages and determines that in the relationship there is a loser and a winner. Career Haberland graduated from Freie Universit√§t Berlin in 1971. After teaching at Freie Universit√§t Berlin he took a job at Roskilde University in 1974, first as an Associate Professor and then as a Senior Reader. Since 2012, he was professor of German language and the sociolinguistics of globalisation. He retired in 2018. Haberland taught in Berlin (Freie Universit√§t) 1972-1974, and in Roskilde since 1974 (in D√ºsseldorf 1979-1980). He was a guest professor, researcher or summer school professor in Athens (1993), Soka (Japan) (1995), Beijing (1996), Guangzhou (2006), Osaka (2009) and Hong Kong (2010).

The manuscript The manuscript was compiled by the principal scribe of the Capilla Real of Madrid, Claudio de la Sablonara (hence the name of the manuscript) for Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine and Duke of Neuburg, during his stay in the court of Philip IV in Madrid between 1624 and 1625. It is one of the few remnant music collections of Spanish court music from the early 17th century. Contributed to its preservation the fact that the manuscript was being kept in Munich when in 1734 a fire destroyed the Royal Alcazar of Madrid, its original place. Works The manuscript contains 75 songs or tonos, as they were called at that time. All works are polyphonic: 32 for four voices, 31 for three voices and 12 for two voices. The works come from the Royal Chapel of Madrid and were composed by some of the most famous Spanish composers of that time: Juan Blas de Castro, Joan Pau Pujol, Mateo Romero, √Ålvaro de los R√≠os, Gabriel D√≠az Bess√≥n, Miguel de Arizo etc. The texts of these songs were drawn from the works of great writers of the Spanish Golden Age, such as Lope de Vega.

Biography Ott was born in the unincorporated community of Mount Hermon in Washington Parish in southeastern Louisiana, one of the Florida Parishes. He was the sixth of ten children (one died on the day of birth), born to Elbert Weston Ott (1855-1924) of Mount Hermon, Louisiana, who was of German and French descent, and the former Martha Estelle Leggett (1860-1955, a native of Mississippi. His father was engaged in the mercantile and planting businesses and instituted the post office in Mount Hermon. Young Ott worked in his father's store and office and became self-educating in the field of accounting. The senior Ott was known for his strong support for prohibition of alcoholic beverages. In 1918, Ott moved to New Orleans to enter the accounting firm of Smith and Skinner. In 1921, he formed his own company, Ott and Prados. He was active in the Masonic lodge and the Young Men's Business Club. In 1940, Ott was elected to one of the eight state Senate slots from Orleans Parish. He served during the administrations of Governors Sam H. Jones and Jimmie Davis. He resigned in 1945 early in his second term. The next year, he was elected commissioner of finance on the New Orleans City Council under the city commission government. He was reelected as finance commissioner in 1950. The mayor at the time of Ott's two council terms was deLesseps Story Morrison, a subsequent three-time candidate for governor. In 1952, Ott joined the ticket of gubernatorial candidate James M. McLemore a cattleman from Alexandria in Central Louisiana, in an unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor. Much of the campaigning was conducted in the last few months of 1951.Minden Herald, January 3, 1952, p. 1The New Orleans Public Library (nutrias.org) erroneously states that Lionel Ott was the running-mate of Robert F. Kennon in 1952, instead of James M. McLemore. Elmer David Conner (1905-1965) of Jennings in Jefferson Davis Parish in southwestern Louisiana, was Kennon's running-mate and later his director of the Louisiana Department of Commerce and Industry. While Robert F. Kennon won the governorship, C. E. \\"Cap\\" Barham of Ruston, the choice of gubernatorial candidate Hale Boggs, the U.S. representative from Louisiana's 2nd congressional district,\\"Boggs '52 ticket listed\\", Minden Herald, October 19, 1951, p. 1 was placed into a runoff election with the later Governor John McKeithen for the second position. Barham prevailed and served one term until his own defeat in 1956 by the educator Lether Frazar. Ott was twice married; his wives were the former Helen Merritt and Carolyn McCormick (1912-2007). He had no children. He is interred beside his second wife at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans. Ott's papers are housed at the New Orleans Public Library.

She was employed by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in New York City from 1932 until her retirement in 1960. She was the first woman assistant vice president of Metropolitan Life. Early life and education Lydia Giberson was born in Bath, New Brunswick, Canada. She attended the University of Alberta in Edmonton as an undergraduate. In 1928 she graduated from the McGill University Faculty of Medicine in Montreal, Quebec. She interned in neurology at the Neurological Institute of New York and did postgraduate studies in psychiatry at the Emma Pendleton Bradley Hospital in East Providence, Rhode Island. Career Lydia Giberson began working for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company as a psychiatrist in 1932. In 1922 Metropolitan Life had become the first American company to employ a full-time psychiatrist. Giberson was the third person, and the third woman, to hold the position. Augusta Scott was the staff psychiatrist from 1922 to 1926, followed by Anne T. Bingham, who died in 1932. Giberson later moved from the company's medical to its personnel department. During the Second World War she acted as a consultant to the United States Public Health Service and the Office for Emergency Management. Shortly before her retirement in 1960 Giberson became the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's first woman assistant vice president, an accomplishment which earned her the title of New York State's outstanding professional woman of the year. During her career at Metropolitan Life Lydia Giberson published 70 journal articles and book chapters. She organized the American Psychiatric Association's first symposium on industrial psychiatry, which was held in 1939. She originated the concept of \\"emotional first aid\\" as an intervention for employees suffering from relatively minor emotional problems. In an address to an industrial medicine conference in New York in 1953, Giberson was quoted as saying that she did not consider \\"industrial psychiatry an exact science, but rather, 'an emotional first aid station'\\". This concept was later built upon by other practitioners and theorists, including Harry Levinson. She was the first woman associate editor of the Journal of Industrial Medicine and the first woman fellow of the American Association of Industrial Medicine. Her professional papers are held in the archives of the University of California, San Francisco. Later life In 1960 Lydia Giberson and her husband Jacques Deane retired to Santa Barbara, California. After his death in 1967 she moved to the Leisure World community in Laguna Woods, California, where she became a community leader, serving on boards and committees and spearheading community organizations such as Meals on Wheels and Planned Parenthood. Lydia Giberson died in Orange, California on 7 April 1994.

It is a song of thanks after communion. Luther's version in three stanzas was printed in the Erfurt Enchiridion of 1524 and in Johann Walter's choral hymnal Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn the same year. Today, the song appears in German hymnals, including both the Protestant Evangelisches Gesangbuch (EG 214), and in a different version in the Catholic Gotteslob (GL 215).  History  Text and melody are based on a Leise, a German congregational refrain ending on Kyrie eleison, of the Latin sequence Lauda Sion for Corpus Christi. Luther knew it in a version which first appeared at the end of the 14th century in a processional from the Franciscan monastery Miltenberg, made in Mainz, at the end of the 14th century: Luther praised the Leise in his writing Von der Winkelmesse und Pfaffenweihe in 1533, appreciating that it is focused on the sacrament of bread and wine, not on sacrifice. He made it a song of thanks after communion, by shortening the text for a first stanza, and by adding two stanzas. The second stanza mentions the anamnesis of the gifts of redemption, the third stanza is a prayer for spiritual fruits of the sacrament for the individual life of the Christian, and for the community. Luther's version appeared in the Erfurt Enchiridion of 1524 and in Johann Walter's choral hymnal Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn the same year. In the current German hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch, it appears as EG 214.  Lyrics  Luther in 1526 The hymn is in three stanzas of eight lines each, with \\"Kyrieleis\\" repeated every four lines.  Music  Johann Walter published a four-part setting of the melody in Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn in 1524. Johann Sebastian Bach composed a four-part setting, BWV 322.  Catholic version  Luther's first stanza, including his redaction, appeared in a Catholic hymnal by the Dominican Michael Vehe, New Gesangb√ºchlin Geistlicher Lieder, in Halle in 1537. In this hymnal, the song is continued by four more stanzas which are attributed to Caspar Querhammer. This version entered several subsequent hymnals. In the 20th century, a new version appeared in hymnals such as Kirchenlied, which took Luther's first stanza unchanged, but the second half of his second and third stanza replaced each time by the second half of the first, as a refrain. At first, Luther's name was not mentioned, instead only \\"16th century\\". This version was included in the first common Catholic hymnal Gotteslob of 1975 (as GL 494), now mentioning Luther's name, and was kept in the following edition, Gotteslob, as GL 215.

This Marian shrine was built around a 14th-century terracotta icon of the Madonna, which was credited with miracles. The Palio of Siena takes place on the day of veneration of this Marian devotion. Remote view with the dome History The church was consecrated on October 16, 1611 by the archbishop Camillo Borghesi. The image, which originally was in an aedicule on a wall next to a house, was carried by a procession (translated) into the church on this day. The event was painted by Taddeo Gregori. This painting is presently in the Sacristy of the Collegiata.La Madonna di Provenzano e le origini della sua chiesa: notizie storiche, by Francesco Bandini Piccolomini, (1895), page 88-89. The procession's members included the widowed former grand-duchess Cristina of Lorraine and the reigning Grand-Duchess Maria Maddalena d'Austria. A number of omens and events had fortified faith in the power of the 14th- century icon. Brandano, il pazzo di Cristo (the madman of Christ), had prophesied before 1555: > Siena, I see your evils and cannot heal you, because God is too angry with > you, Siena! ... Run the Signoria through the sieve, or it will go into the > brothel! Siena! ... Send your daughters barefoot to do penance in > Provenzano, because a great drowning flood nears... Senesi! Your well-being > rests with Provenzano and our Majestic Queen who has guarded Siena, and will > protect her foreverSiena! ‚Ä¶ io vedo i tuoi mali e non posso rimediarvi, > perch√© Iddio √® troppo adirato con te, Siena! ‚Ä¶ metti la Signoria nel > crivello, sinn√≤ andrai in bordello! Siena! ‚Ä¶ Manda le tue figliuole scalze a > far penitenza in Provenzano, perch√© t‚Äô√® vicina a venire addosso una gran > piena che t‚Äôaffogher√†‚Ä¶ Senesi! Il vostro benessere √® riposto in Provenzano e > l‚Äôalta Regina che ha guardata Siena, la guarder√† in eterno. Tradition holds that the lackluster faith of the Sienese led the Madonna to quit her protection, resulting in the ultimate subjugation of Siena by the Holy Roman Emperor and his Florentine allies. The Madonna di Provenzano terracotta was shattered. This was said to have resulted from either an errant or impertinent shot by a Spanish soldier in the occupying army of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. According to legend, the event caused a change on the soldier. He either died or repented from the event. Fifty years later, this neighborhood was considered one of the most morally insalubrious corners of town. An old prostitute from the neighborhood prayed to the icon of the Madonna, and overnight her ulcerous lesion was healed.Piccolomini, pp. 66-67. The image became a destination for devotion of the faithful. Soon the church relented and in 1594 commissioned construction of a church as a shrine for the icon; the architect Flaminio Del Turco was hired to design it. The Medici family were among the patrons who raised funds to build the new church. In 1806 the image was covered with a coating of silver, which was done out of respect and a desire to preserve the icon. Through conservation of the work, the silver has been partially revealed. In 1634 Pope Urban VIII named this as a collegiate church with its own chapter of canons.Collegiata Santa Maria di Provenzano Official site. Art and architecture Interior The main altar Construction of the Mannerist church building, with a Latin Cross layout, was begun in 1595. It has an imposing white marble facade and a peaked dome at the crossing of the transept. The first altar at the right depicts the Mass of San Cerbone (1630) by Rutilio Manetti. It depicts a miracle that occurred when the holy bishop of Massa Marittima saw apparitions of angels at a service he invoked for the pope. The canvas was commissioned by the bishop of Massa Marittima, Fabio Piccolomini. The second altar on the right has a canvas depicting Saints Catherine of Siena and Catherine of Alexandria by Francesco Rustici, and one of the Annunciation by Giovanni Domenico Manenti. The first altar on the left has an altarpiece depicting St Catherine of Siena has a Vision of the Martyrdom of St Lawrence (1685), by Dionisio Montorselli. The canvas was first hanged in the former Sienese church of San Lorenzo, which was destroyed. The second altar on the left has a 19th-century wooden crucifix. The spandrels of the cupola were frescoed with the four patron Saints of Siena: St Ansano (1715) painted by Giuseppe Nicola Nasini; St Savino and St Crescenzio (1727) by Vincenzo Meucci; and St Vittore (1726) by Gasparo Bidelli.Piccolomini, page 128. Along the walls are monochrome canvases depicting the Dream of St John the Evangelist and the Mass of St Gregory Magno by Bernardino Mei and Deifebo Burbarini. Along the nave are four large paintings depicting the Nativity of Mary, the Visitation, the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, and the Coronation of the Virgin by Luigi Boschi and Giovanni Bruni. In the transept are paintings depicting venerated individuals who had lived in the same neighborhood: St Bernardo Tolomei and the Blessed Savina Petrilli (2013), by Francesco Mori. The polychrome marble floor decoration below the cupola depicts the heraldic symbols of Grandukes of Tuscany Cosimo III de' Medici and Margherita Luisa d'Orl√©ans, and of the Florentine and Sienese states. It is surrounded by the symbols of the nearby bishoprics of the ancient Republic of Siena: Grosseto, Sovana, Pienza, Montalcino, Massa Marittima and Chiusi. The main altar shelters the terracotta icon of the Madonna di Provenzano in an architectural work (1617-1632) by Flaminio del Turco. The icon is surrounded by a \\"glory\\" of silver angels, and bronze statues of Saints Catherine and Bernardino sculpted by Giovanni Battista Querci. Some of the drapery on the altar has the symbols of Pope Alexander VII, the last pope from Siena. In the Sacristy is a Compianto sul Cristo morto by Alessandro Casolani. The apse displays a flag captured by Sienese mercenary Paolo Amerighi from the Turks during the Battle of Vienna (1683), at the height of the Ottoman invasion of Europe. In the counterfacade is a flag from the Medici Fortress in Siena, given by the Grand-Duke Peter Leopold as a sign of the demilitarization of the city. Below the church, in its former crypt, is the Oratory del Suffragio, the chapel for the Contrada of Giraffa. It has an entrance on Via della Vergine.

Born in Roermond, he was the twenty-second child of John Francis Desideratus, Prince of Nassau-Siegen, but the ninth born from his third and last marriage with the French Isabella Clara du Puget de la Serre. Life A member of the Catholic branch of the House of Nassau-Siegen, his status and that of his full brothers as dynastic members of the family was disputed because their parents' marriage was deemed morganatic. The marriage contract between John Francis Desideratus and Isabella Clara du Puget (signed one month after their marriage, on 13 March) stipulated that their offspring would have no higher rank than that of untitled nobles unless the male descendants of the Prince, through his two previous (and equal) marriages, became extinct. Despite this provision, after the death of John Francis Desideratus on 17 December 1699, Emmanuel Ignatius (who inherited the Barony de Renaix with his older brothers) and his surviving full-siblings assumed the title, name and arms of Nassau-Siegen. Their older half-brother William Hyacinth, Prince of Nassau-Siegen obtained from the Reichshofrat (in 1701) and the Reichskammergericht (in 1709) legal judgments denying dynastic titles of the Princes of Nassau-Siegen to the descendants of the John Francis Desideratus' third marriage on the grounds that the marriage contract signed in 1669 was for a morganatic union. Despite this, Emmanuel Ignatius and his siblings all used the title of Prince or Princess of Nassau, Count or Countess of Katzenelnbogen, Vianden and Diez, Baron or Baroness of Beilstein and Ronse.Morganatic and Unequal Marriages under German Law [retrieved 8 March 2016]. In Paris on 14 May 1711, Emmanuel Ignatius married with Charlotte (17 March 1688 - 17 March 1769), daughter of Louis II, Count de Mailly-Nesle.Louis II de Mailly-Nesle in: gw.geneanet.org [retrieved 1 March 2015].Louis II de Mailly-Besle in: histoireeurope.fr [retrieved 1 March 2015]. They had two sons, who died in infancy: [retrieved 1 March 2015]. Charles Nicholas (14 February 1712 - 1 July 1712) and Maximilian (29 August 1713 - 1714). Almost since the beginning, the marriage was extremely unhappy. In 1716 Emmanuel Ignatius and Charlotte became officially separated; since them, she maintained a dissolute life in Paris, and her husband had her imprisoned in a monastery for adultery. Emmanuel Ignatius pursued a military career, firstly in the Spanish army and since 1714 in the Austrian army. In 1718 he became a colonel and from 1723 he was Generalfeldwachtmeister, in 1733 being appointed a field marshal. He was also a captain in the army of Archduchess Maria Elisabeth, Governor of the Austrian Netherlands. In 1715 he was awarded the Order of the Golden Fleece and the Order of Saint Hubert in 1720. In 1722 Emmanuel Ignatius and Charlotte were reconciled, and on 25 October of that year, she gave birth to a third son, Maximilian William Adolph, who was initially recognized by Emmanuel Ignatius as his own. After the death of Frederick William Adolf, Prince of Nassau-Siegen in 1722, Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI authorized his fellow Roman Catholics, Emmanuel Ignatius and his two older brothers to receive part of the dynastic Nassau-Siegen inheritance. After expulsion of William Hyacinth, in 1727 the Emperor named Emmanuel Ignatius administrator of the Principality of Nassau-Siegen. However, his power was significantly restricted, because the real government was in the hands of the Electorate of Cologne; soon after, he returned to Brussels without further attempts to exercise authority in the principality.Johannes Arndt: Herrschaftskontrolle durch √ñffentlichkeit: Die publizistische Darstellung politischer Konflikte im Heiligen R√∂mischen Reich 1648-1750, G√∂ttingen 2013, p. 405. The hoped for Catholic succession in Nassau-Siegen after the death of Prince Frederick William II in 1734 never took place, because both Emmanuel Ignatius and his brother Francis Hugo died shortly after and within months of each other in 1735. On 26 August 1734 and close to his death, Emmanuel Ignatius rejected Maximilian William Adolph as his son, declaring him to be adulterous. Despite his posthumous, formal recognition by French courts (sentence du Chatelet, 31 January 1756), he was declared illegitimate in the Holy Roman Empire, within whose boundaries Nassau-Siegen was located, at the request of William IV, Prince of Orange by the Reichshofrat on 17 December 1744, that decision being confirmed by the Emperor on 15 October 1745. After his death in 1748, his pretensions were continued by his son Charles Henry but without results. Nassau-Siegen was eventually inherited by the Protestant Nassau-Diez branch of the princely family. Notes References *Erik A.

Main characters =Koro-sensei= is the main protagonist and anti-hero of the series. He is the homeroom teacher of Class 3-E of Kunugigaoka Junior High School. He is initially thought to be the perpetrator of the explosion of the Moon, which has rendered it permanently in a crescent shape; this is later revealed to be false, as the true culprit was a mouse implanted with his cells that had been sent to the moon as part of an experiment. Despite not having the intention to get killed, he offered to governments all over the world a chance to kill him under the condition that he is allowed to be the homeroom teacher of Class 3-E until the end of the year, when he will destroy the Earth by self-explosion unless he is killed. He is dedicated to his task as a teacher and imparting his knowledge of assassination to the students, despite knowing full well that he is their target. However, he is able to connect with each student individually, which is why all of his students respect him, despite knowing that he will destroy the planet in a year. He takes a form similar to an octopus with eight tentacles and his skin color changes depending on his mood. He is able to move at a maximum speed of Mach 20 (15345.383 miles per hour), which allows him to travel across the world in a short amount of time and makes him a hard target to hit. He is also intelligent to the point that he could teach almost every subject to all of his students single-handedly. He does however have a number of weaknesses, mainly to special rubber knives and BB pellets specifically designed to work against his body. While he is initially believed to be an alien, he later reveals that he was once a legendary human assassin who was the first 'God of Death'. After being betrayed by his apprentice, he was captured and sent to a facility where a series of experiments were performed on him, transforming his body. Koro-sensei was born in the slums of an unknown third world country, where he soon learned he had a natural talent for killing and an inborn lack of empathy. He became an assassin, murdering anyone for the right price, even world leaders and the heads of entire militaries. However, after being captured and used as a guinea pig, he begins to learn compassion and empathy from a female intern with whom he becomes close. His decision to become a teacher involves his promise to the intern who thought that he was suitable to become one, later revealed to be Class 3-E's former teacher, Aguri Yukimura, who was selected to be his observer during the experiments performed on him. According to Koro-sensei, his lifespan will be over by the end of the school year in March, and if he is not killed by then, the whole planet will perish with him due to the explosive release of the anti-matter in his body that was generated by the experiments performed on him. After a vicious clash with K≈çtar≈ç Yanagisawa, the scientist responsible for his current condition, and his former apprentice, the second 'God of Death', and using all of his energy left to save one of his students who was mortally injured during the confrontation, an exhausted Koro-sensei bids farewell to his students and finally allows them to kill him, with Nagisa ultimately doing so by stabbing him in the heart. After being assassinated, his body disintegrates into multiple floating orbs of light while his clothes are left behind. Koro- sensei's name is a pun on the words and . Koro-sensei appears as a playable character in the video game J-Stars Victory VS. =Nagisa Shiota= : : Actor portrayal: Ryosuke Yamada is one of the students in Class 3-E, the main student character, and the manga's narrator. Nagisa is seen as one of the weakest students in the class due to his small stature and mediocre physical abilities that are comparable to some of the girls in the class. However, he is actually the most talented to become an assassin out of all the students, something that is acknowledged by Koro-sensei and Karasuma. He is able to draw closer whilst hiding his blood lust to make a surprise attack and is able to make his opponents falter through his blood lust alone. Nagisa usually writes down Koro-sensei's weaknesses, which at first seem minor (since they do not look like major weaknesses). However, some of them are eventually revealed to be useful as the students are almost able to kill Koro-sensei because of one of these weaknesses. Outwardly friendly and polite to his friends and everyone, he hides a somewhat darker side of him as an assassin that is not noticeable during daily classes and is only revealed during training and assassination time. When engaged in battle, Nagisa becomes a brutal assassin who would throw away his life if it meant killing his target. According to Karasuma, whenever Nagisa unleashes his killing intent, he is not training and truly goes for a kill. At home, Nagisa lives with his chronically absent father and abusive mother. His mother tries to live vicariously through him by making him follow her exact life plan for him, because she experienced a lot of failure in life and was also never allowed to look like a \\"pretty girl\\" by her parents. This causes her to constantly tell him she wishes he was born a girl and make him grow his hair long, which she only lets him tie up because if she unties, it he still looks like a girl. His mother is also the foundation for his assassination talents, because whenever he tries to defy her when she is in what he perceives as a \\"gloomy\\" moment, she grabs and screams at him, so he learned to tell the difference between her \\"cheerful\\" and \\"gloomy\\" moments, in order to prevent some of her abuse. Nagisa realizes that this is similar to the \\"Wavelengths of Consciousness\\" that the \\"God of Death\\", the world's best assassin, talks about. After this realization, he tells Koro-sensei he has the talent to be an assassin in a career planning meeting. His home life improves and his desire to be an assassin wanes after he saves his mother from an assassin, which in turn gave him time to realize his talents can be used to save people and she realized that she cannot hold onto him forever. When the time comes for Class 3-E to finally end Koro- sensei's life, Nagisa offers to deal the killing blow, which he regrettably does. During the graduation ceremony, Nagisa learns, much to his joy, that before his death, Koro-sensei talked with his father as well and helped him reconcile with his mother. During his time with Koro-sensei, Nagisa eventually realizes that he wants to be a teacher like him. After completing his studies, he becomes an intern at Gokuraka Private High School assigned to a dysfunctional class full of male delinquents and gang members, much to his chagrin. Nevertheless, he sets to work teaching and rehabilitating delinquent students while intimidating them into compliance with his blood lust. In addition, Kaede implies that he will begin teaching at the old Class 3-E building in the future. He is also shown to have trimmed his long hair, although he sadly notes that he has not grown significantly taller at all since then. When Sumire Hara asks Kayano how things are between her and Nagisa, she bashfully replies that he is focused on his career at the moment. =Kaede Kayano / Akari Yukimura= : : Actor portrayal: Maika Yamamoto is one of Nagisa's classmates and close friends, being the one who is mostly seen with him. She has an apparent affinity for pudding, once attempting to assassinate Koro-sensei with a giant pudding with explosives inside. She experiences a slight inferiority complex when it comes to sex appeal, especially her bust size, as she usually gets flustered towards girls with large breasts. Kaede is the smallest student in Class 3-E and is even shorter than Nagisa and Manami. She is also the student who comes up with Koro- sensei's name. At the start of winter, she reveals her true identity to be professional method actress Akari Yukimura, the younger sister of Aguri Yukimura, the former Class 3-E teacher. Believing Koro-sensei to be her sister's killer, she stole and implanted tentacles from Shiro's facility onto the back of her neck and changed her identity in order to infiltrate Class 3-E, using her acting skills to hide her extensive blood lust from everyone until she was ready to make her move. However, using her tentacles in battle puts her life at risk, just like what happened with Itona, and before she dies, Koro-sensei manages to remove them from her body once Nagisa calms her down with a French kiss, shocking her to the point of passing out. It is also revealed that the time she spent with Koro-sensei and Class 3-E made her urge for vengeance falter over time and made her believe that there was more to Koro-sensei's past than what she had assumed. She then spends the winter break recovering at a hospital, and upon returning, decides to hide her newfound feelings for Nagisa in order to not give him trouble during their mission to assassinate Koro-sensei. During Koro-sensei's battle with Yanagisawa and the second God of Death, Kayano attempts to intervene, making use of the kinetic vision she obtained during the time she implanted the tentacles in her body, but is mortally wounded by the enemy, and to save her life, Koro-sensei performs an intricate surgery to restore her body up to the cellular level in order to save her life, a procedure he developed to ensure that the tragedy that happened with her sister would not be repeated, but exhausting himself in the process. After Koro-sensei's death, she resumes her acting career, becoming even more famous than before. When Sumire Hara asks Kayano how things are between her and Nagisa, she bashfully replies that he is focused on his career at the moment. =Karma Akabane= : : Actor portrayal: Masaki Suda is one of Nagisa's closest friends and considered to be the strongest and smartest among the Class 3-E students. He is the first one to be able to inflict injuries on Koro-sensei during their first meeting. He was suspended from school prior to Koro-sensei's arrival by his class' homeroom teacher due to his extremely violent behavior. Unlike most students in the class that were relegated there due to their low grades, Karma is one of the school's most gifted students as he is the only one able to match Gakush≈´ in terms of test results and grades, but developed a rebellious attitude due to his previous teacher's betrayal after he severely wounded a top third-year student while saving a bullied student from Class 3-E, as despite believing he has done the right thing, his teacher revealed that he was only siding with him due to his grades to increase his reputation and did not want to be held responsible for what happened. Karma then brutally beat the teacher, leading to his transfer to Class 3-E. Because of this experience, Karma originally distrusts Koro- sensei, but Karma begins to accept him after realizing Koro-sensei is unlike the other treacherous teachers at the school. After the battle to decide whether they should kill Koro-sensei or not, he grows closer to Nagisa and even begins addressing him without any prefixes. He is also one of two to tease Kaede about her feelings towards Nagisa together with Rio. After graduation, he decides to enlist on a government test with the intent of carving his own territory in politics. Antagonists ; : : Board Chairman of Kunugigaoka Junior High School and Gakush≈´ Asano's father. Responsible for Class 3-E's current condition, he and his son share a tense competitive relationship with each other. Gakuh≈ç's teaching skills are seemingly on par with Koro-sensei's, and he seems to know the latter's secret. He eventually takes over as the teacher of Class 3-A in order to prove their superiority over Class 3-E once and for all. Gakuh≈ç becomes more and more desperate as finals near, and eventually uses a teaching method that induces the entire Class 3-A, with the exception of Gakush≈´, into a zombie-like trance that makes them sacrifice their own personal well-being for the sake of studying. These events lead Gakush≈´ to conclude that his father is insane and must be stopped. Gakuh≈ç eventually falls into full-blown madness after his teaching methods fail to allow Class 3-A to beat Class 3-E and several 3-A students begin to contemplate transferring to Class 3-E. It is later revealed that when he had just started the Kunugigaoka Cram School, he was a passionate, caring, and talented teacher like Koro-sensei, but changed his ideal educational system after a tragic incident where one of his first three students, an aspiring basketball player, committed suicide due to constant bullying. He believed that it was due to him not teaching his students to be strong. This belief, combined with his guilt and grief, led him to become cold and calculating, and he avenged his student by ruining the lives of the bullies by getting them addicted to gambling. After being defeated by Koro-sensei personally, he accepts defeat and has shown some changes in his personality, while still refusing to give up on his educational policy. He also reconciles with Gakush≈´ after they both decide to sue each other and the two ultimately spend some time bonding over the filing of their individual suits and dreaming of the payouts they will get. He is apparently aware of Kayano's true identity as she was the student he demoted to Class 3-E for intentionally breaking one of his possessions when she first transferred to Kunugigaoka. After Koro-sensei's death, the Class 3-E system is abolished and Gakuh≈ç resigns from his position on the government's orders after the public found out about his draconian teaching methods. While he is packing up his office, however, he is visited by the remaining two students from his very first class, now adults, and begins catching up with them over a bottle of wine. ; : : Actor portrayal: Hiroki Narimiya :A mysterious scientist who cloaks himself in anti-sensei material, he first appears as Itona's guardian and tutor, bestowing him with the tentacles on his head and providing him the medication needed to treat it. After several failed attempts however, he abandons Itona, soon taking an interest in Kaede's potential. Once Kaede fails as well, he reveals himself as K≈çtar≈ç Yanagisawa, the lead scientist who performed the experiments that transformed the God of Death into Koro-sensei and destroyed the moon, thus making him the primary antagonist of the series. He also was Aguri's fiance√©, and always mistreated her due to her low birth in comparison to his wealthy and well-connected family. He holds a grudge against Koro-sensei, who completely shattered his pride upon taking control of the experiment and winning Aguri's favor. He later returns after taking the second God of Death under his guard and modifying his body for them to enact revenge of Koro- sensei together in the final hour of the deadline before his explosion. Yanagisawa's body ends up severely damaged when he is blown away by a beam fired by Koro-sensei against the Second God of Death and comes in contact with an anti-tentacle barrier originally set up to trap Koro-sensei, leaving him in a semi-vegetative state. ; : : Actor portrayal: Masanobu Takashima : A man who trained alongside Karasuma and was jealous of his abilities. He is sent to Class 3-E in order to take over their assassination training, but is forced to leave after being defeated by Nagisa, because of how sadistic his training was. He later returns, more insane than ever and he scarred his own face, he was laughed at by his peers after his defeat by Nagisa. During Class 3-E's field trip to Okinawa where he poisons more than half the class, with the only cure in his possession, he orders Nagisa and Kayano to bring Koro-sensei to him at his hotel room. Instead, Nagisa, Karasuma, and the remaining healthy students infiltrate his hotel and defeat his hired assassins, leading to a confrontation on the hotel roof. He then challenges Nagisa to a one on one fight to exact revenge for his earlier defeat, blowing up the case containing the cure to throw Nagisa into despair. However, after sustaining a beating at Takaoka's hands, Nagisa manages to stun him with Lovro's secret surefire assassination technique. Takaoka's worst fear is realized when Nagisa gives him the same innocent smile he had worn before surprising and defeating Takaoka the first time, before knocking him out with a stun baton. Takaoka stated that Nagisa's innocent smile will haunt him in his nightmares for the rest of the rest of his life. It is then revealed that the cure was unnecessary to begin with, as Takaoka's hired assassins had supplied him with a non-lethal poison, having privately agreed beforehand not to follow their employer's murderous plans. Takaoka is then taken away by the military. He was sent to jail and also was dishonorably discharged. ; : : The number one assassin in the world, who starts to hunt down other assassins and eventually targets Class 3-E and Koro-sensei. He initially appears as a harmless florist, but his true form is hidden behind killing intent so thick that he appears to be shrouded in darkness, leaving his true appearance a mystery. In actuality, he peeled the skin from his face so as to become a master of disguise and has heavily modified his own body to become an efficient killer, such as implanting a small caliber gun in his index finger. He eventually convinces Irina to join him and kidnaps Class 3-E to draw out Koro-sensei, but is thwarted by Taiga and S≈çsuke's skill with paint and cameras, before being betrayed by Irina and defeated by Karasuma in a fistfight before being detained and put under Yanagisawa's care. He is eventually revealed to be the second God of Death, the original being Koro-sensei, his former master, whom he betrayed upon believing that he had learned all he could from him. Initially he looked up to him and even to his death, wished to be acknowledged by him and to be just like him. Unfortunately, Koro-sensei only saw him as a tool since he had yet to learn compassion and empathy. Disillusioned, he took the title of God of Death after he betrayed Koro-sensei by letting him be captured by security guards after an assassination job. Since his confinement he went under Yanagisawa's experiments to prepare him for a final confrontation with Koro-sensei in order for both to enact their revenge on him, after the scientist revealed to him that his former mentor and the teacher of Class 3-E are the one and the same. Having a much more imposing and terrifying figure than his predecessor, the enhanced Second God of Death possesses many more tentacles than Koro-sensei and is capable of moving twice as fast than him. However, even with such improvements, he ends up defeated and killed by Koro-sensei, who apologizes to his former student for not guiding him properly during their time as master and pupil before promising to start over if they meet again in the afterlife.

Low was also one of golf's greatest‚Äîand unabashed‚Äîhustlers. He once reportedly said, \\"Show me a millionaire with a bad backswing and I can have a very pleasant afternoon\\". He was also reputedly one of the best putters the game has ever known. Counselor of putting to Arnold Palmer and his contemporaries, Low was renowned both as a player and a teacher of this most fragile art‚Äîthe sure putting stroke. Low died in Illinois on April 10, 1995 at the age of 82. Early life George Low was born in Springfield, New Jersey, in 1912. He was the son of Scottish-American golf professional George Low, Sr. He grew up on Baltusrol Golf Club where his father was the head professional and actually lived on the grounds. Low stated that he putted on the practice greens there as a child for four years before he ever stepped on a golf course to play an actual round. He would not actually take up the game until he was 15 years old. Golf career Low was active on the PGA Tour in the 1930s through the 1950s. Although a fine player, he was better known as a designer of putters. His Sportsman Wizard 600 model was used most famously by Jack Nicklaus in the prime year of his career. He was a putting instructor for Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino, among others. In the late 1940s, Low contracted with the Hansberger brothers, owners of Sportsman‚Äôs Golf (now Ram Golf), to manufacture the fine-line Wizard putters under both the Sportsman and Bristol brands. The George Low autograph Wizard 600 was produced and is now considered one of the world‚Äôs most collectible golf clubs, sometimes carrying a $25,000+ price tag. In 1936, Low was the head professional at Plymouth Country Club in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, and the following year he served as assistant at the Manufacturers Golf & Country Club in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania. He subsequently assisted his father at a driving range in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. Low was also one of the best putters the game has ever known. Low wrote (with Al Barkow) his only book, The Master of Putting, which was published in 1983. In the book, Low reveals the secrets of his amazingly dependable putting technique, addressing stance, grip, tempo, and the other putting fundamentals. Low's physical appearance was described by Los Angeles Times golf writer Jim Murray as \\"‚Ä¶ built along the general lines of a Chicago Bear linebacker, he had the gruff exterior of a Balkan border guard and he tried not to say anything good about anybody‚Äîit destroyed his image. But actually he had a left ventricle full of fudge\\". The 1957 Masters Tournament champion, Doug Ford, stated that \\"George Low was the greatest putter I ever saw outside of Tiger Woods. George could putt with his foot better than most guys could with their putter. That's the truth. I saw him beat a guy in Havana, [Florida], for $35,000 putting with his foot\\". Low‚Äôs father, George Low, Sr. (1874‚Äì1950), was a noted Scottish professional golfer who had four professional wins. The highlight of his father‚Äôs career was a T2 finish in the 1899 U.S. Open. Low was one of the great characters of 20th century golf. World Golf Hall of Fame member Dan Jenkins described him in his book, The Dogged Victims of Inexorable Fate, as follows: \\"He is, all at once, America's guest, underground comedian, consultant, inventor of the overlapping grip for a beer can, and, more importantly, a man who has conquered the two hardest things in life‚Äîhow to putt better than anyone ever, and how to live lavishly without an income\\". Low once stated: ‚ÄúI had been a test pilot for Foot Joys forever. I test their $65 alligator models to see if standing in them for long periods of time in a bar brings any serious harm [and] what effect spilling beer has on them‚Äù. Low's idol wasn't a golfer, it was the jockey Willie Shoemaker. Low told golf writer Jim Murray, \\"putting a two-ounce ball into a four-inch hole is nothin' compared to putting a 1,200-pound horse through a one-foot hole on the fence\\". Low would achieve his 15 minutes of fame on the golf course rather than at the track. He would often remind other pros that he was the one who broke Byron Nelson's string of 11 consecutive tour victories in 1945. It was complicated‚Äîmost things with Low were. An amateur, Fred Haas, actually won the 1945 Memphis Invitational Open but as an amateur he couldn't take the prize money. Instead, as low professional in the event, Low waltzed away with the cash (Nelson tied for fourth). There are many legends and half- truths that have been written, spoken and whispered about George‚Äôs remarkable putting ability. There are wild tales of George putting with a rake, a shovel, a pool cue or a broom handle and defeating an opponent who was using a legitimate club. There are stories of George kicking a ball with his foot and acing five out of nine holes in one round on the practice green. Other stories hint that George has given putting \\"secrets\\" to people like Arnold Palmer, Bing Crosby and Willie Mays that have enabled them at certain moments to display divine touches on the greens. And there are stories that in the old days George took so much money away from the tour champs in friendly putting games after tournaments were over that, as George said, \\"I shoulda been given a speeding ticket, I win so fast\\". Although Low never played in the Masters, he was a friend and sometimes putting mentor of four-time champion Arnold Palmer, who gave Low some credit after finishing birdie-birdie to win his second green jacket in 1960. \\"The only thing I did on those putts,\\" Palmer said at the time, \\"was keep thinking what my old friend George Low always says: 'Keep your head down and don't move.' \\" More infamously, from behind the gallery ropes Low called Palmer over to congratulate him on the 18th fairway during the final round in the 1961 Masters shortly before Palmer made a sloppy double bogey to hand the title to Gary Player, who just happened to be using a George Low signature putter manufactured after Palmer's win in 1960. With that exposure, George was suddenly more than a mystery man and began being sought out by sports writers around the country. Death Low died on April 10, 1995 at the age of 82.

It is perhaps the best preserved endowment of a Serbian noble of the 14th century, with well-preserved frescoes.  Location  The monastery is located on the south-west slopes of Mt Osogovo, in the middle of a volcanic crater. It lies at the beginning of Lesnovo village, at the height of 870 meters. The closest townlet is Zletovo which together with Lesnovo belongs to the municipality of Probi≈°tip.  Beginnings  St Gabriel of Lesnovo, a fresco from Lesnovo The monastery is located in a secluded region which was popular with hermits of the 11th century. One of them, St Gabriel of Lesnovo, lived in the local caves and died there as well. It remains still unsolved whether Gabriel founded a monastery or was it founded on the spot close to his hermitage. Very little is known of this original monastery since Gabriel's relics were taken away and the first and only mention of the old monastery comes only from 1330 in a chronicle by its monk Stanislav, a famous writer.  New beginning  Portrait of Despotes Jovan Oliver with the church of St Michael in his hands The new monastic complex known today was founded in 1341 by Despotes Jovan Oliver Grƒçiniƒá, a magnate of Serbian kingdom who owned the surrounding area. Jovan Oliver built a church dedicated to St Michael as well as new dwellings and bestowed a charter to Lesnovo in which he lists its numerous possessions. The monastery became immediately very rich, attracting a large and well educated fraternity. Next year (1342) Oliver gave the monastery with all its belongings to Chilandar, the highly revered Serbian monastery on Holy Mount Athos. In the Serbian state assembly held in Skopje in 1347 Emperor Du≈°an pronounced Lesnovo monastery as the seat of the newly established Zletovo bishopric. The new bishopric was intended to fill in the gap of the old, non-functional Morozvizd bishopric. Lesnovo received a new charter by which it was released from the power of Chilandar, got new villages and freed the peasants in them from state duties. As its founder, Jovan Oliver retained the right to appoint the abbot and to be present at the election of the bishop of Zletovo.John. V. A. Fine, The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest, University of Michigan Press, 1994, p. 300 https://books.google.com/books?id=Hh0Bu8C66TsC&hl;=en Most importantly, as the new seat of the bishopric the monastery church was enlarged with a narthex. From this period it is known that a number of hermitages (usually the number 16 is mentioned) operated in the caves around the monastery. Many from the numerous fraternity were also living as hermits, including the first bishop, Arsenije I, who was buried in one of them. We know little of what happened with Lesnovo in the tumulus years after Du≈°an's (1355) and his son, Uro≈°'s death (1371). In 1381, the local lord Konstantin Dejanoviƒá issued a third charter giving Lesnovo back to Chilandar and placing it under the supervision of the bishop of Velbu≈æd, his capital.  Under Ottoman rule  During the Ottoman onslaught the monastery was not destroyed but it is possible that late in 15th century its fraternity was dispersed for some time. The first renovation of a neglected monastery came in 1558, just one year after the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá was restored. The reconstruction undertaken by its abbot Neofit in that year opened a series of works by the rich people from the nearby mining town of Kratovo that at the time flourished itself. In 1581 duke Nikola Bojƒçiƒá recovered the monastery with lead and in 1588 duke Nikola Pepiƒá (brother of duke Dimitrije Pepiƒá) built the outer narthex. Monastery also got new dwellings, books as well as new possessions. In this period the monastery once became once more the seat of the bishopric. Later in 17th and the following centuries the monastery was subordinated to the bishop of Kratovo-≈†tip or that of ƒÜustendil.–ê–∑–±—É—á–Ω–∏–∫ –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–µ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω–µ —Ü—Ä–∫–≤–µ –ø–æ –†–∞–¥–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤—É –ì—Ä—É—ò–∏—õ—É, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ 1993, —Å—Ç—Ä. 90 In one Ottoman document from 1618 we learn that the monks assisted the brigands and some of them even joined their ranks.

It was renovated in 18th century but by its end it was again abandoned. A thorough renovation came after in 1805 monastic life was reestablished by monk Teodosije from Visoki Deƒçani monastery. In 19th century Lesnovo got famous for a number of valuable manuscripts that were sold by monks and that have reached many libraries (Belgrade, Sofia, St Petersburg...).  Today  The monastery is still active with a small fraternity. It belongs to the Macedonian Orthodox Church.  Architecture  Lesnovo monastery in 1912 The oldest part of the church, from 1341, is in form of an inscribed cross with a dome above its center. Its architecture follows Byzantine cannons with alternate layers of brick and stone and decorative arches in two levels (similar to the Church of St Michael in ≈†tip). The narthex, since it was built only a few years later (1347) forms a harmonious whole with same decoration of walls, a smaller dome above it and three double bay entrances. The westernmost part is the much lower addition by duke Nikola Pepiƒá from 1588. Deemed of much less worthy architecture, it was destroyed in the mid-20th century, only to be recently rebuilt in its original form.  Fresco painting  Portrait of Emperor Du≈°an Similarly to its architecture, the wall paintings of Lesnovo all come from a short time span. The original church was painted in 1346‚Äì47, the narthex in 1349. There were four painters of whom are known the names of the three, inscribed in medallions (Sevasto, Mihail and Marko). One of them has also painted his self-portrait, seated by the river of knowledge coming from the teachings of one of church fathers. Although painted in just several years the frescoes of Lesnovo show all the stylistic diversity of the current styles of painting. While some of the paintings in the nave follow the classicist examples from the beginning of the 14th century with their calm composition and mild color contrast, the painter of the cycle on St Michael emphasized movement and drama of the events, painting them in bright colors.–í. –à. –Ç—É—Ä–∏—õ, –ì. –ë–∞–±–∏—õ-–Ç–æ—Ä—í–µ–≤–∏—õ, –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∞ —É–º–µ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç —É –°—Ä–µ–¥—ö–µ–º –≤–µ–∫—É II, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ 1997, —Å—Ç—Ä. 73 Many of the paintings show rare or even unique depictions or iconographic solutions such as the red painted St Michael on a horse, represented as a commander of God's army or a cycle of archangels. More common is the grand composition of St Michael saving Constantinople from the Saracens. As depictions of king David's psalms there are interesting compositions of sun, moon and twelve zodiacal signs, a round dance to drums and cither and several other scenes from 14th-century life. On the walls of the church are also found the depictions of the three hermit monks from the area ‚Äì Gabriel of Lesnovo, Joachim of Osogovo and Prohor of Pƒçinja ‚Äì as well as the portraits of the founders of independent Serbian church, St Simeon and St Sava, which were common for each Serbian monastery. A monk in front of the monastery. The portraits of historical figures are of equal importance. In the endower's composition one sees despot Jovan Oliver in elaborate dress of a magnate together with his wife. Next to his portrait is a longer inscription that lists his rise to position as one of the most powerful lords of Serbia ‚Äì significant for the grading of baron's titles. Oliver's eyes were scratched by Bulgarian soldiers during the 1915‚Äì18 occupation of Macedonia. In the outer narthex is a three-meter-tall painting of Emperor Du≈°an with his wife, Empress Jelena. This subtle psychological study of a 40-year-old mighty ruler is Du≈°an's most commonly reproduced portrait.  Iconostasis  The large wooden iconostasis was done in 1811‚Äì14 by Petre Filipoviƒá and his band (tajfa) of woodcarvers from the Mijak clan in West Macedonia. This is the first of the four famous iconostases that this group carved. It is remarkable in its details and decoration. The icons are the work of masters of the Samokov school.  Monastery complex  The monastic dwellings of the monastery date mostly to the renovation of the early 19th century. The high tower was built in the same period. In it is the bell cast in 1860 in Kragujevac and bears an inscription that it presents the donation of Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá of Serbia. Next to the church grows a centuries- old mulberry tree, supposedly planted after the church was built in the 14th century.

History  Newbridge Colliery in Gelliwion, Pontypridd was sunk in 1844. Its owner was John Calvert (1812‚Äì1890), a Yorkshireman, who would give his name to this engine. Calvert had previously been a railway contractor, the major contractor of the Taff Vale Railway, but after his initial distrust of Wales he remained in the area once the line opened and switched to mining. The winding engine was installed in 1845, in which year production began from the 55 yard No.3 Rhondda seam. Winding was carried out with an iron flat chain, with wooden blocks through the links. The winding engine also powered the water pump for draining the mine. The pump was at the bottom of the shaft, worked by a vertical pump rod and linked to the engine by a 'tee bob'. Ventilation was by the bratticed split-shaft furnace method and so there was no fan engine for ventilation. Later the winding chain was replaced by rope. Steam was supplied from an egg-ended boiler at a pressure of between . The original engine was built in 1845 by the Varteg Ironworks of Cwmavon, near Blaenavon. This was the first steam winding engine to be installed in the Rhondda valley. The valve gear gab The hooked rod from the right is driven by the eccentric. When engaged, it rocks the valve arbor, the square shaft, back and forth. Bellcranks behind the shaft work the valves via the vertical pullrods. The cylinder was replaced in 1861 by Brown, Lenox and Co. of Newbridge Works, Pontypridd.Maker's name and date may still be seen cast into the cylinder and valve chest. This new cylinder was of bore, stroke. Although the original bore is unknown, the stroke remained the same, as the crank was unchanged. Reversing is by slip eccentric and gab valve gear. Similar engines were used for winding at both Glyn Pits and at Calvert's second pit, Gyfeillion, which would become the Great Western Colliery. Other dual-purpose engines were used at Welsh collieries at this time, but later it became more usual to use separate engines for each purpose. By 1869, ownership of the mine had passed to the Fowler Brothers. In 1880 it was owned by the Newbridge and Rhondda Coal Company. Later the Crawshay family owned it. At the end of the colliery's working, the Inspector of Mines' list of 1896 shows 489 employed there. The colliery closed in 1897 and the shaft was abandoned. The engine and winding house lay derelict. A widely known postcard of 1912 shows the hose overgrown with ivy, but the engine beam still in place. There is some question as to when the engine finally worked. The 1897 closure is well documented, but many sources also state that the engine was last worked in 1919. It is not clear if this is an error, in either direction, or that the engine was re-started for a time, possibly during World War I and then closed soon after.  Preservation  In 1913 a School of Mines was established for the Welsh coalfield. The school was owned and funded by the Welsh coal owners, through a levy of one tenth of a penny on each ton of coal produced by the companies involved. This South Wales and Monmouthshire School of Mines was based in Forest House, built by the Crawshay family on the site of Fforest Isaf farm at Trefforest, Pontypridd. It served the large coal mining industry in the South Wales Valleys. Around 1920 the engine was removed from the derelict colliery and re- erected nearby in the grounds of the School of Mines. This was a historical exhibit, more than a practical instruction. Engines of this type were thoroughly obsolete by this time. Although the last Cornish beam engines had been installed only a few years earlier, these were pumping engines, not rotative beam engines like this for winding. The school went through several different names and statuses over the years. Most recently it was the University of Glamorgan, now part of the University of South Wales. Surprisingly, Calvert's Engine is not listed in Crowley (1982), usually considered as one of the first standard works of modern-era steam preservation for such engines.

These were particularly active in four conflicts: the Russo-Turkish wars of 1735‚Äì39 and 1787‚Äì92, the Russian Civil War, and World War II (called, in Russia, the Great Patriotic War). The Dnieper Flotilla in the Russian Empire =Russo-Turkish War (1735‚Äì39)= Small naval vessels were built in Bryansk on the Desna River (a tributary of the Dnieper) from 1724. At the start of the Russo-Turkish war in 1735, the Dnieper Army of Field Marshal B. K. Minich requested naval assistance in capturing the Turkish fortress of Ochakiv on the Black Sea. At the instigation of Vice-Chancellor Count Osterman, the Governing Senate issued a decree on January 4, 1737 for the building at Bryansk of a flotilla for operations on the Dnieper River. At least ten British officers served with the flotilla For the construction and manning of the flotilla, 4650 sailors, soldiers, and craftsmen were sent to Bryansk. The boats constructed were mainly dubel boats, a type of shallow draft Russian 18th century rowing/sailing galley, of which 400 were ordered. According to some sources, though, most of the boats in the flotilla were Cossack boats which ‚Äì according to a report made in 1738 by Rear Admiral Yakov Barch ‚Äì were narrow, unstable, hard to row, suitable perhaps for Cossack journeys but very unfit for naval operations. Vasily Afanasievich-Mam√≥nov, first commander of the flotilla On February 3, 1737, by order of Empress Anna, Rear Admiral Vasily Afanasievich-Mam√≥nov took command of the flotilla. In the spring of 1737 a flotilla consisting 355 vessels with troops, supplies, siege artillery, and ammunition on board was sent down from Bryansk on the Desna to the Dnieper. Due to shallow water on the Dnieper that summer, most of the ships could not pass to the target destination (Ochakiv), and the first boats past the rapids arrived there only on July 17, when the fortress had already been taken by Russian troops. On September 3, 1737, at the insistence of Field Marshall Minich, command of the flotilla was given over to Vice-Admiral Naum Senyavin. Under Senyavin's leadership, construction work in Bryansk intensified. By October 1, 1737, there were only 18 boats remaining in the flotilla. On October 30, 40,000 Turkish troops supported by 12 galleys attacked Ochakiv; the Dneiper Flotilla played an active role in repelling the attack. Ochakiv remained besieged for two weeks, and naval combat continued in the area through October, during which time the flotilla was reinforced by another 30 small vessels. Although the Turks abandoned their attempt to retake Ochakiv, Russian access to the Black Sea remained blocked by the strong Turkish squadron. In the spring of 1738 plague broke out among the troops, claiming Vice Admiral Senyavin, who was replaced as flotilla leader by recalling Rear Admiral Afanasievich-Mam√≥nov. Under threat of the plague, the Russian ‚Äì both land troops and Dnieper Flotilla ‚Äì abandoned Ochakiv (as well as Kinburn Fortress on the tip of the Kinburn Peninsula at the extreme end of the Dnieper estuary). Afanasievich-Mam√≥nov in turn succumbed to the plague and was replaced by Rear Admiral Yakov Barch. The war ended with the Treaty of Ni≈° on October 3, 1739, and the Dnieper Flotilla ‚Äì by then numbering 647 boats ‚Äì was disbanded by 1741; most of the vessels were burned. =Russo-Turkish War (1787‚Äì92)= Nassau-Siegen The Dnieper Flotilla in the Russo-Turkish War of 1787‚Äì92 was commanded by Karl Heinrich von Nassau-Siegen. With 51 boats of various types ‚Äì dubel boats, cossack boats, and others ‚Äì the flotilla combined with a squadron of 13 ships of the Black Sea Fleet commanded by John Paul Jones for operations in the Liman (the Dnieper-Bug Estuary), part of the Siege of Ochakiv of 1788. The Turkish fleet was roughly equal in large ships, but somewhat inferior in smaller craft to the Dnieper Flotilla. The command structure in the Liman was difficult, as neither Jones nor Nassau-Siegen had operational control, each reporting to Potemkin, who, being in charge of all armed forces of the empire, was not in a position to exercise tactical command. In addition, Jones thought poorly of Nassau-Siegen's abilities ‚Äì an opinion shared by Jones's biographer, Samuel Eliot Morison ‚Äì and Nassau-Siegen was jealous of Jones's more luxurious flagship. At the First Battle of the Liman on the morning of June 7, 1788, the Turkish Fleet attacked the combined Russian fleet; Jones's big guns destroyed two Turkish vessels and the Turks retreated, but Nassau-Siegen did not pursue. He wrote to Potemkin \\"...unhappily, the wind was contrary, so our ships could not attack and had to retreat under the guns of the sailing squadron\\". Potemkin found this disingenuous, wondering why Nassau-Siegen's rowing boats could not go against the wind, especially considering that he had the current at his back. (Nevertheless, Nassau-Siegen ‚Äì better at politics than fighting ‚Äì was able to outmaneuver Jones politically, and eventually Jones was dismissed while Nassau-Siegen stayed.) The next major battle, on June 16 and 17, saw Nassau- Siegen distracted with claiming prizes while Jones entreated him to help repel a Turkish attack; unsuccessful with Nassau-Siegen, Jones nevertheless persuaded some of the flotilla's individual captains to rally to him. This battle ended with a grisly episode which saw the Dnieper Flotilla attack several grounded Turkish vessels with flaming missiles, immolating alive the Turkish rowers ‚Äì slaves and prisoners who were chained to their stations. Osten-Sacken, at bay, ignites the magazine Ultimately, the Siege of Ochakiv was successful and the Russians gained a permanent powerful presence on the Black Sea. In a legendary incident, a dubel boat of the Dnieper Flotilla commanded by Captain Second Class Christian Ivanovich Osten-Sacken, scouting for the Black Sea Fleet, was surrounded and outnumbered by Turkish vessels. As the Turks attempted to board, Osten-Sacken blew up his boat, destroying it and four Turkish vessels. The explosion warned the Russians at Ochakiv that the Turkish fleet was approaching. =Dubel boats= Dubel boat A main component of the Dnieper Flotilla in both the 1735‚Äì1739 and 1787‚Äì92 Turkish wars was the dubel boat (, with variant names also used). The dubel boat is a type of boat, unique to Russia, and extant from the 1730s to the 1790s, when they were replaced by gunboats. Their name may come from the English \\"double\\" in the sense of \\"duplicate\\", on the grounds that the boats appeared to be smaller versions of larger ships. Chief Quartermaster R. Broun designed the boats and made the first model (still existing, at the Central Naval Museum). The dubel boat was a shallow draft rowing and sailing galley with 18 pairs of oars and two masts rigged with lateen sails. They were designed to be able to pass the Dnieper rapids and also serve as bridge pontoons to move armies across the Dnieper or other rivers. The boats were armed with six two-pounder falcon guns mounted on swivels. They were capable of transporting 50 soldiers and two small battalion guns. Three dubel boats also accompanied Vitus Bering on the Great Northern Expedition (1733‚Äì1743). The Dnieper Flotilla in the Russian Civil War The Dnieper Flotilla of the Ukrainian Front was formed in Kiev on March 12, 1919 by order of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Ukrainian Front (a Soviet Army Group formed during the Russian Civil War for offensive operations into Ukraine) and its commander Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko. In May 1919, the flotilla was subordinated to the Office of Military Communications of the Ukrainian Front. On June 1, 1919, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee decided to disband the Ukrainian Front, which occurred on June 15, after which the Dnieper Flotilla was attached to the Soviet 12th Army. On August 27, 1919, control of the flotilla was transferred to the Commander of Naval Forces of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. As of March 21, 1919, the Dnieper Flotilla had this composition: *1st Squadron ‚Äì the Charlotte, and Armored Boat Number 1 through Armored Boat Number 5 *2nd Squadron ‚Äì the Courier, the Apollo, and the Samuel *3rd Squadron ‚Äì the Arnold, the Faithful, and the flotilla flagship, the Admiral By late March the flotilla consisted of 19 combat and support vessels. Armored boat Number 2 of the Dnieper Flotilla, armed with a machine gun in a turret The flotilla's combat vessels were of two kinds: gunboats and armored boats. The gunboats were usually conversions of boats confiscated from Kiev shipowners, on which were installed one or two guns of calibre (fore and aft, if two guns) and up to six machine guns ‚Äì Hotchkiss, Maxim, or whatever was available ‚Äì with some iron or steel sheet bolted on for protection if any was available. The armored boats were purpose-built patrol craft inherited from the Imperial Navy; their armament consisted of one Maxim machine gun in a rotating turret, with a crew of 7. The flotilla commander from March 12, 1919 to September 13, 1919, was A. V. Polupanov. Beginning in April 1919 the Dnieper Flotilla supported about 21,000 Soviet troops engaged in a campaign against anti-Soviet forces under the turncoat rebel Daniil Ilich Terpilo (known as Ataman Zelyony (, literally \\"Green\\")). The flotilla ultimately engaged in six campaigns against Zelyony. On April 11, 1919, the rebels stormed Soviet-occupied Kiev. 400 of Zelyony's men attacked the Kiev docks from the steamer Baron Ginzburg. Later the rebels seized the Dnieper, Salubrious, Gogol, Charlotte, and Zeus from the Dnieper Flotilla. Zelyony moved his headquarters to the Charlotte. Zelyony's insurgent army, calling itself Army of the Independent Soviet Ukraine, was thus able to block navigation of the Dnieper. But on May 1 and 2 of 1919 shelling by the Dnieper Flotilla destroyed much of the villages of Trypillia and Plyuty; on May 30 Trypillia was again shelled by the armed tugboat Taras Bulba and the armed steamer Courier. During fierce fighting near Trypillia in June and July 1919 Zelyony's captured boats were beaten back. The Trypillia Incident, where Zelyony's men massacred a Komsomol special forces detachment, occurred on July 3, 1919. By the end of July, Zelyony's army was defeated (although not destroyed) and forced to retreat from Trypillia. Crucial to this was an operation by the Dnieper Flotilla which landed troops in the rear of the rebel army and rendered their position in Trypillia untenable. On September 26, 1919, the boats of the Pripyat River Flotilla were added to the Dnieper Flotilla. In the Battle of Chernobyl of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, on April 25‚Äì27, 1920, the Dnieper Flotilla was defeated by the Riverine Flotilla of the Polish Navy. The Dnieper Flotilla was disbanded in December 1920. The Dnieper Flotilla in World War II A Dnieper Flotilla was constituted in June 1931, but disbanded in June 1940, its vessels distributed to the newly formed Danube Flotilla (since, with the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina the Soviets now had a border on the Danube) and the Pinsk Flotilla. During the war, with the advance of the Red Army to the Dnieper River, a new Dnieper Flotilla was constituted from ships of the Volga Flotilla in September 1943. By the beginning of the Spring 1944 offensive the Dnieper flotilla consisted of about 140 boats and ships, including: *16 armored gunboats *10 patrol boats *40 river minesweepers *32 motorboats *1 floating artillery battery *2 anti-aircraft units The commander of the Dnieper flotilla from October 1943 until the end of the war was Rear Admiral Vissarion Grigoriev. The flotilla's chief political commissar from April 1944 until the end of the war was P. B. Boyarchenkov. Flotilla chiefs of staff were J. V. Nebolsin in October and November 1943, and K. M. Balakirev from November 1943 to the end of the war. The Dnieper Flotilla operated on the Dnieper River and its tributaries, the Berezina River and the Pripyat River, and also on the Vistula River and its tributary the Western Bug, and on the Oder River and the Spree River (which flows through the heart of Berlin). The Dnieper and its tributaries drain into the Black Sea, while the Bug, Vistula, Oder, and Spree drain into the Baltic Sea; the Flotilla was able to cross between watersheds using then-existing canals. (Late-war operations in the Black Sea watershed were left to the Danube Flotilla). The Dnieper Flotilla's vessels contributed to the flank defense of advancing Soviet troops in Ukraine, Belarus, and Poland, and enabled the crossing of water obstacles, provided logistic support, and performed amphibious landings ‚Äì the largest being the Pinsk Landing during the liberation of that city, with others including landings at Zdudichi, Petrikovsky, Borkinsky, and Doroshevichinsky. Flotilla units continued fighting to end of the war, in battles on the Oder and Spree, and PG-117 motorboats of the Dnieper Flotilla participated in the storming of Berlin, the only naval units to do so. In the summer of 1945 Armored Gunboat Number 302 was transferred to the far east, where it became part of the Amur Flotilla and fought in the 1945 war against Japan. After the end of the war the Dnieper Flotilla was disbanded. =Types= Many different types of vessels served with the Dnieper Flotilla. BK type made into a monument in Kiev, showing the tank turret main armament One common type was the BK armored gunboats. This type served in large numbers with the Dnieper Flotilla as well as other Soviet river flotillas. At the time of the German invasion 85 of these were in commission, 68 were under construction, and a further 110 were ordered on August 18, 1941, all of which were completed during the war, and about 90 of which were lost. These boats carried a tank gun in a tank turret as their main armament ‚Äì early units using T-28 and T-35 turrets, later units using T-34 turrets when these became available in 1939, all fitted with a gun. Model BK-1124 had two turrets and BK-1125 one turret. long and wide, they displaced . They carried a crew of 10 and had a single gasoline engine generating 720 boiler horsepower for a speed of . Besides the 3-inch main armament, the boats carried a 12.7mm machine gun and two 7.6mm machine guns. Zheleznyakov at Sailor's Park in Kiev A much larger, slower, and less numerous but somewhat more powerful craft was the Zheleznyakov class river monitor. Five of these were built at Kiev between 1934 and 1939 and all served in the Dnieper Flotilla. All were lost except the class leader, which is preserved at Kiev. These boats were long and wide with a displacement of . They carried a crew of 70, had twin diesel engines generating 300 boiler horsepower for a speed of , and were armed with a twin main armament, two twin guns, and four machine guns. =Awards and monuments= Monument in Pinsk to the Pinsk Landing The Dnieper Flotilla was awarded the Order of the Red Banner in 1944 and, as a unit citation, the Order of Ushakov First Class in 1945. Some subunits of the flotilla were also awarded the Order of the Red Banner or were awarded Guards status or given honorary names memorializing battles (Pinsk, Bobruisk, Luninets, Berlin). Three thousand soldiers and sailors of the flotilla were awarded orders and medals of the state, twenty of these being Hero of the Soviet Union, including one awarded to Alexander Firsov. In Pinsk a memorial to the flotilla (a BK boat) was erected and a museum was created (closed in the early 1990s). A street in Pinsk was named Dnieper Flotilla Street.

Iraqi forces consisted of the Iraqi Army and the Popular Mobilization Forces (the bulk of the ground forces, consisting of Shia militiamen and also some Sunni tribesmen), receiving assistance from Iran's Quds Force officers on the ground, and air support from the American, British, and French air forces. The city of Tikrit, located in the central part of the Saladin Governorate in north of Baghdad and Samarra and lying adjacent to the Tigris River, was lost to ISIL during the huge strides made by the group during its offensive in June 2014. After its capture, ISIL retaliated with the massacre at Camp Speicher, a nearby training facility for the Iraqi Air Force. After months of preparation and intelligence-gathering, Iraqi forces engaged in offensive operations to fully encircle and subsequently retake the city, starting on 2 March 2015. The offensive was the largest anti-ISIL operation to date, involving some 20,000‚Äì30,000 Iraqi forces (outnumbering ISIL fighters more than 2-to-1), with an estimated 13,000 ISIL fighters present. It was reported that 90% of the residents of the city left out of fear both of ISIL and retaliatory attacks by Shia militias once the city is captured. As such, most of the residents fled to nearby cities, such as Baghdad and Samarra, or even further to Iraqi Kurdistan or Lebanon. On 4 April, after several days of heavy fighting and acts of vengeance committed by some Shia militias, the situation in the city was reported to have been stabilized, and the last pockets of ISIL resistance were eliminated, with an Iraqi Police Major reporting that \\"The situation now is calm.\\" However, on 5 April, continued resistance by 500 ISIL fighters in the city was reported in several pockets, which persisted for another week as government forces continued combing Tikrit for hiding ISIL fighters, especially in the northern Qadisiya District. On 12 April 2015, Iraqi forces declared that Tikrit was finally free of all ISIL forces, stating that it was safe for residents to return. However, pockets of resistance persisted until 17 April, when the last 140 ISIL sleeper agents in the city were killed. Cleanup and defusing operations in the city continued, but Iraqi officials predicted that it would take at least several months to remove the estimated 5,000‚Äì10,000 IEDs left behind by ISIL in Tikrit.  Background  Tikrit, the hometown of the ex-president Saddam Hussein, fell to ISIL during the offensive in June 2014. A first attempt to recapture the city in late June 2014 was repelled by ISIL after a few days, as well as another Iraqi attempt to recapture the city in July 2014. Subsequent efforts in December 2014 also failed to make headway against ISIL, which consolidated control over Tikrit and its environs. On the morning of 19 August 2014, Iraqi government troops and allied militiamen launched a major operation, to retake the city of Tikrit from the militants. The military push started early in the morning from the south and southwest of the city. However, by the afternoon, the offensive had been repelled by the insurgents. Additionally, the military lost its positions in the southern area of the city it had captured a few weeks earlier. The operation in Tikrit counted as the first major attempt by both Iraqi military and the Iran-backed Shiite to recapture ground seized by the Islamic State group since the previous summer.  Preparations  In early February 2015, Iraqi forces and their allies began preparations for an attack on Tikrit, with troops arriving in the nearby city of Samarra. The allied forces were composed of a heterogeneous make-up, including Iraqi security forces; a multitude of Shia militias which received support, training, and leaders from Iran; and a number of Sunni tribes. Iranian leaders included officers from the revolutionary guard's extraterritorial operations division, the Quds Force, including the commander of the Quds Force, General Qasem Soleimani himself. The Iraqi Army and Security Forces, along with Shia militia groups who call themselves Popular Mobilisation Units, were to push into Tikrit from several directions. Some Iranian commanders took part in leading the operation, with general Qasem Soleimani directing operations on the eastern flank from a village about 35 miles from Tikrit called Albu Rayash. The offensive was the biggest military operation in the Salahuddin region since the previous summer, when ISIL fighters killed hundreds of Iraq army soldiers who had abandoned their military base at Camp Speicher outside Tikrit. Soleimani was also spotted at Camp Speicher where he oversaw elements of the Kata'ib Imam Ali and the Badr brigades. The Shia paramilitary groups constituted by far the largest component of the allied forces at 20,000 fighters, with 3,000 being the total count of the Iraqi Security Forces and roughly a thousand or so Sunni tribesman making up the rest of the combined army. An adviser to the Iraqi government was quoted as saying that the attackers were divided into an initial assault force of 9,000, with another group made up of local Sunni tribesmen who were to \\"pacify\\" the city, and another group which would work on intelligence gathering, reconstruction work, and dealing with the expected refugee flow caused by the fighting. According to reports from locals, most of the civilian residents had left Tikrit for Iraqi Kurdistan and Baghdad, leaving mostly ISIL fighters inside the city. The UN estimated that about 28,000 civilians had reached Samarra following the outbreak of the offensive against ISIL. The U.S.-led Coalition was not initially a participant in the operation. As the battle commenced, Gen. Martin Dempsey mentioned that, while the U.S.-led Coalition had not been directly involved in the offensive, the continuous airstrikes along the length and breadth of ISIL territories in Syria and Iraq had greatly depleted the groups' capacity, and that the newest assault against Tikrit would not have been militarily feasible, were it not for the airstrike campaign in the preceding months throughout the country. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs also maintained that Iran's overt role could be positive and could only become problematic if it descended into sectarianism.  The offensive  = Encirclement = Tikrit Air Academy, (formerly COB Speicher), which was the site of the infamous Camp Speicher massacre by ISIL, was recaptured and used as an offensive launching platform for the second battle of Tikrit where Gen. Qasem Soleimani coordinated the Badr brigade & Kata'ib Imam Ali efforts. On 2 March 2015, the Iraqi government launched a massive military operation to recapture Tikrit, with 20,000‚Äì30,000 allied fighters, backed by aircraft, besieging the city on three fronts. On 3 March, the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) ‚Äì in cooperation with local tribes and militias ‚Äì captured the strategic oil fields of Alas and 'Ajeel in eastern Tikrit, after the ISIL militants were relentlessly bombarded by a barrage of artillery shells and gunfire from the east. Due to their withdrawal from the Alas and 'Ajeel Oil Fields, ISIL was forced to withdraw towards one of their last strongholds at the town of Al-'Alam, where ISIL was expected to prepare its last stand against the Iraqi Army and its allies in the northern sector of the conflict. Al-'Alam was the last land bridge left for ISIL's communications with the rest of its territories in the province, and if it was cut, it would result in their encirclement. Continuing their offensive, the ISF took complete control of the highway between Tuz Khumato and Tikrit, raising the Iraqi flag at the police headquarters in the town of Ksayba, following their fierce clashes with ISIL combatants. East of Tikrit, the ISF and their allies captured the Hamrin Mountains (Jabal Hamrin), killing a number of militants in the process. According to Iraqi media source Haidar Sumeri, four suicide bombers were killed during the battle, including a female identified among the dead militants. The high number of IEDs (improvised explosive devices) ISIL planted along the possible routes of advance towards Tikrit necessitated that the allied commanders operate with diligence and caution. Another factor contributing to the slowed advance of the allied forces was the large number of ISIL snipers present. On 5 March, ISIL militants set fire to oil wells in the Ajil field in an attempt to hinder airstrikes against their positions. According to military sources, the allied forces had retaken the village of al-Maibdi, on the road between Tikrit and Kirkuk, as well as the nearby Ajil and Alas oilfields. On 7 March the strategic town of al-Dour, located south of Tikrit, was captured from ISIL and secured, allowing the allies to progress further northward, in support of other contingents on the east bank of the Tigris River, towards Tikrit itself. On 9 March, the allied forces rapidly advanced on and captured the town of Al-Alam, which lies to the northeast of Tikrit and was the last line of communication ISIL militants had left with their territories to the north. The successful assault on al-Alam, which was commanded by Hadi al-Ameri under the advice of Qasem Soleimani, effectively completed the encirclement of ISIL in and around Tikrit. Despite ISIL's efforts to forestall the rapid advance of the allies on the east bank of the Tigris River, by blowing up the bridge leading to the city, the allies managed to mount a push across the river and establish a bridgehead, though other sources reported that the destruction of the bridge momentarily held up the advance in this sector, with a source saying that \\"ISIS jihadists blew up a vital bridge over the Tigris River, which may delay the progress operations in the eastern parts of Tikrit.\\" ISIL was suffering heavy casualties, with reports of their dead littering the streets, with only 2,000‚Äì3,000 militants left to make a last stand in the city itself. Also, at this time, ISIL hung dead bodies at the entrance to the northern town of Hawija, which were those of militants who deserted from Tikrit, according to Al Rai's chief correspondent Elijah J. Magnier. Still, ISIL reinforcements were being sent to Tikrit from other parts of Iraq. = Push into the city = The ground assault on the city itself started on 11 March, and by the next day, approximately three quarters of Tikrit was in allied hands according to Iraqi officials, while the rest remained under ISIL control with only a few hundred remaining ISIL militants reportedly holding out in defending the centre of Tikrit. Under these circumstances, ISIL reportedly resorted to the use of chlorine gas against the allied combatants. On 13 March, it was revealed that ISIL was still in control of around half of the city, while the ground offensive had stalled. Meanwhile, it was reported that Shia militia fighters and Iraqi government troops were torturing, and conducting revenge killings of, captured ISIL prisoners. Allegedly, captured militants were beaten, shot, beheaded, dismembered, and thrown from buildings by Iraqi forces, with the remains mutilated and photographs posted online. Among the pictures posted on pro-Shia and Iraqi forums and on Instagram were images of beheaded ISIL fighters, while other images showed militants shot and dragged behind trucks, and thrown from high buildings. According to reports, the killings were revenge for similar ISIL atrocities, especially the Camp Speicher massacre of June 2014. In response to the allegations, the Iraqi Army promised an investigation. By 14 March, the number of ISIL militants holed up in the center of Tikrit had been reduced to around 1,000 (some reports claimed 60 or 70), with Iraqi commanders claiming to be able to purge the city entirely of the enemy within a matter of days, in a slow and methodical approach to minimise casualties from the plethora of IEDs & booby-traps placed by ISIL in the urban area. A temporary halt to the advance was made in order to bring up specialists as well as elite troops with more urban warfare experience for the final push into the city center held by the remaining ISIL militants. There was a reported surge of material reinforcements for the allied forces during the later stages of the operation, with a myriad of Iranian-made weaponry making it to the frontline. These were said to include tanks, rocket systems, combat vehicles, and even UAVs as U.S. officials told the New York Times that Iran sent drones toward Tikrit, and Iran's state-owned Fars news agency claimed that unmanned vehicles were airborne over the city. In the period between 10 and 15 March, more than 200 mortar rounds had been launched into the Qadisiya district by the allied forces. On 16 March, various news outlets reported on the destruction of Saddam Hussein's tomb in his ancestral village of al-Awja. Allied soldiers stated that ISIL had planted IEDs throughout the mausoleum and booby-trapped the entire complex in an attempt to ambush the attackers. The building was completely leveled and only the pillars remained. After Iraqi forces took the control of al-Awja, Shia militiamen of the Popular Mobilization Committee placed the Shi'ite militia's insignia around the village, including that of the Iranian general Qassem Soleimani‚Äîtheir commander, and also a veteran of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War waged by Saddam Hussein. = Offensive stalled = Casualties mounted during urban warfare in the tight city streets of central Tikrit, where ISIL planted a massive number of bombs and prepared a very strong defense at the heart of the city. Due to the unexpected resistance, there were reports of mounting casualties sustained by the allied side, who called up their specialist forces to engage in urban warfare in the city center. One of the commanders of the Asa'ib Ahle-Haq militia stated that, \\"The battle to retake Tikrit will be difficult because of the preparations (ISIL) made. They planted bombs on all the streets, buildings, bridges, everything. For this reason, our forces were stopped by these defensive preparations. We need forces trained in urban warfare to break in...but any besieged person fights fiercely.\\" In downtown Tikrit alone, there was a reported total of some 6,500 IEDs. On 17 March, the allied reinforcements started to arrive at Tikrit, and there were also signs that civilians were returning to the recaptured outskirts, such as al-Alam. On 19 March, a U.S. official said that due to the fierce resistance from surviving ISIL forces in the city center, the recapture of Tikrit was \\"at least two weeks away.\\" On 23 March, Iraqi Security Forces discovered a tunnel connecting Al-Alam to the central part of the city of Tikrit, which was used by ISIL. = Coalition airstrikes, partial militia withdrawal = In return for air support, the United States demanded that the Iranian-led Shia militias withdraw from the battle. The Iraqi government agreed; though the militia commanders objected and said they would boycott the fight, this had the effect of clearing the way for U.S. involvement and liberation of the city. There were reports from the ground that the disengagement of the militias was incomplete. On 25 March, the allied forces were supposed to resume their offensive as the United States launched its first airstrikes on ISIL targets in Tikrit. That night, U.S. aircraft carried out 17 airstrikes in the center of Tikrit, which struck an ISIL building, two bridges, three checkpoints, two staging areas, two berms, a roadblock, and a command and control facility. However, the ground assault was pushed back by two days, due to disagreements between the various components of pro-government forces. The allied ground troops had mixed reactions towards the participation of the United States in the closing phase of the battle. A spokesman for Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq said, \\"We announced that we will suspend our operations as we won't accept the Iraqi government giving the victory to the Americans on a golden plate. There is no need for the American air strikes now as we have already liberated 90% of Tikrit. We won't let the Americans take the glory for the work they are doing for liberating 10%.\\" However, the most senior commander among the paramilitary groups, Hadi al-Ameri, said that, \\"From what I understand, Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi made the request. However, we respect his decision.\\" The number of remaining ISIL fighters, who continued to control 40 percent of the city, was estimated at 500‚Äì750 heavily armed combatants. On 26 March, Royal Air Force Tornado GR4's, supported by a Voyager tanker, used Paveway IV laser-guided bombs to attack three ISIL strongholds in Tikrit. On 27 March, the Shi'ite militias, with the exception of the Badr Organization, pulled out of the battle for Tikrit. On 28 March, the US-led coalition conducted eight airstrikes in and near Tikrit, hitting two large ISIL units, one tactical unit, a vehicle, a vehicle-borne explosive device and 12 fighting positions. Overall, the previous three days of coalition airstrikes had been described as \\"carpet bombing\\". Ground fighting itself was inconclusive, with back-and-forth fighting occurring where the same territory was changing hands every half an hour. The regular government troops were in no rush to capture the center of Tikrit, especially since they felt disappointed and in need of changing their plans after the paramilitary forces withdrew from the battle. On 29 March, an attempt by the Iraqi Army to advance from the southern Shisheen district was repelled when ISIL fighters destroyed a bulldozer being used by the military to clear a path around booby-trapped roads. Between 26 and 29 March 17 soldiers were killed and 100 were wounded in the street fighting. An RAF Tornado GR4 patrol provided close air support to Iraqi forces near Tikrit. A Brimstone missile was used to destroy an ISIL armoured personnel carrier positioned under a road bridge. = Battle for the city center = Map of the final push into the city center of Tikrit On 31 March, Iraqi Security Forces established fire-control over the city. Soon afterwards, the ISF advanced into the city center, seizing the Salaheddin provincial government headquarters and the Tikrit hospital, as they moved towards the presidential complex. The ISF and the Hashd Al-Sha'abi militia forces also captured the Central Prison and the Civil Defense Directorate. Soon after government troops reached the city center, the Iraqi Prime Minister declared the city to be captured. \\"The Iraqi forces have entered downtown Tikrit before a short time and have raised the Iraqi flag on its provincial government building,\\" Haider al-Abadi said in a press conference in Baghdad. However, U.S. military officials expressed scepticism that the battle was over. By the end of the day, ISIL resistance still remained. The final stage of the assault was conducted by some 4,000 ISF in conjunction with approximately 10,000 Shi'ite paramilitaries under nominal command of the ISF. At that time, it was also estimated that only 400 ISIL fighters remained inside the city. On 1 April 2015, it was reported that 150 ISIL fighters had been killed, reducing the number of ISIL in the city to around 250. Late on 1 April, Iraqi security forces reported that they had captured 95% of Tikrit, with only around 30 ISIL fighters reportedly left hiding inside of some houses in the northern parts of the city. They also stated that they expected the battle to end in the coming hours. Meanwhile, Iraqi forces continued dismantling IEDs and other booby traps left behind by ISIL in the city. However, an Iraqi military official in Tikrit stated they had only taken about half of the city. By 2 April, Iraqi forces had taken more parts of Tikrit, including Saddam Hussein's Presidential Palace. Three ISIL senior leaders were reported to have been killed in the Presidential Palace. However, heavy resistance from isolated ISIL pockets was still reported in the northern neighborhoods of Qadisiya and Alam, where a few hundred ISIL fighters were still present. Also, it was believed that after Tikrit had been fully secured, the Iraqi forces would redeploy to Baiji, to clear the ISIL from that city and the surrounding region, which an Iraqi official later confirmed on 3 April. = Clearing the city = An ISIL fighter captured by Iraqi Security Forces near Tikrit On 3 April, Iraqi forces continued combating ISIL fighters. Shi'ite militia leader Hadi al-Ameri stated that after the Saladin Governorate was liberated, their next target would be the Anbar Governorate, before finally going on to Mosul. Beginning on 1 April, Shi'ite militias entered the city, with multiple fighters burning buildings, looting, vandalizing, and mobbing and killing ISIL POWs, and sometimes mutilating their corpses. In one instance, a foreign ISIL fighter captured by the militias was stabbed to death and then hung from a street light, while local forces stood by and witnessed the lynching. Acts like these prompted Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi to order the arrest of anyone caught looting or vandalizing, on 3 April. On 4 April, 80% of the Shia militias pulled out of Tikrit, in response to complaints by locals that some of the fighters had spent several days looting the Sunni city after helping retake it from ISIL. Other reports indicated that looting and deliberate burning of houses and shops was a result of conflict between Sunnis that opposed ISIL and other Sunnis that supported ISIL. By 4 April, the battle had left Tikrit largely deserted and in ruins, with an Iraqi police major saying, \\"The situation now is calm\\" and Iraqi Captain Mahmoud Al- Sad reporting \\"There are no resistance pockets inside Tikrit.\\" However, on 5 April, it was reported that 500 ISIL fighters were still holed up in the northern Qadisiya district. On the same day, 12 ISIL militants were killed on the outskirts of Tikrit. Fighting continued through the next several days, with Brigadier General Thamer al-Hamdani, the director of the Anti-Explosives department in Tikrit, being killed when a booby-trapped house exploded in Qadisiya on 7 April. Throughout 7 and 8 April 79 ISIL militants were reportedly killed in Tikrit, with Iraqi forces also suffering some casualties. On 10 and 11 April, Iraqi Security Forces continued combing through the last pockets of ISIL resistance in Tikrit. On 12 April, the Iraqi government declared the city free of ISIL forces, stating that it was safe for residents to return home. However, many refugees from Tikrit still feared returning to the city. On the same day, Abu Maria, the ISIL leader of the parts of the Saladin Governorate stretching from Al-Hajaj to Albu-Tema, was killed by Iraqi forces near the Ajil Oilfield, to the northeast of Tikrit. It was revealed that he was killed with his top aide while fleeing from the city of Tikrit. Despite the Iraqi government declaring that was Tikrit free of ISIL, ISIL militants continued to hide in the city, until the remaining 140 ISIL sleeper agents were located and killed by Iraqi security forces on 17 April.  Aftermath  On 8 April 2015, Iraqi government forces built on their advances in the area around Tikrit and launched an offensive to liberate the Anbar Province from ISIL. As a result of the Iraqi offensive, ISIL launched a counterattack in the region, capturing 3 villages to the east of Ramadi on 15 April. Following the end of the battle, cleanup and defusing operations continued in Tikrit. However, Iraqi officials predicted that it would take several months to fully identify and remove all of the 5,000‚Äì10,000 IEDs that had been left behind by ISIL in the city. After the clearing and de-mining operations by the Iraqi army and militias, over 50% of the former inhabitants of the city of Tikrit returned, according to a statement by an Iraqi official. Other towns around Tikrit have also seen large numbers of displaced civilians returning. Al-Alam saw 90% of its population return by mid-September 2015.  Iran's role  The leader of the Iranian Quds force, Gen. Qasem Soleimani reportedly took up a prominent role in both the planning & execution of the offensive to liberate Tikrit from ISIL. Some U.S. commentators and media outlets expressed misgivings with regard to the clear and overt role played by Iran and the myriad of Shia militias under its influence and how this could conceivably give rise to further sectarian tensions in the Sunni population of the country. This is while the presence of Iranian military advisers was said to be highly effective on the battlefield, according to CNN. According to several analysts, Qasem Soleimani was organizing and directing the Shia militias in a more deliberate manner, which led to a better-planned assault than previous operations. It later transpired that Qasem Soleimani was present and participating in commanding the drive on al-Alam where Hadi al-Amiri, the commander of the Badr Organization (the largest militia force involved in the battle), said \\"He was giving very good advice. The battle ended now, and he returned to his operations headquarters\\". This effectively left the militants in Tikrit encircled and trapped. Hadi al-Amiri criticized those who were \\"kissing the hands of the Americans\\", saying that the U.S. failed to live up to its promises to help Iraq fight ISIL, unlike the \\"unconditional\\" assistance being given by Iran.  International response  U.S. and Iranian officials have repeatedly insisted that they do not coordinate on actions in Iraq. But both sides have taken steps not to interfere with one another's operations. The U.S. ended its involvement in the Second Battle of Tikrit beginning in early March 2015, and was no longer providing airstrikes as in other cases, and is reported to have had minimal or rather no involvement with the offensive at all. Despite this, American general Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has stated his belief that the Tikrit offensive would have been impossible without US air strikes against ISIS in other areas of Iraq.US claims its air strikes enabled Iraqi push poised to retake Tikrit from Isis, The Guardian, 7 March 2015. There are growing concerns on the U.S.' part that the success of the offensive will only draw Iraq further away and deeper into Iran's sphere of influence. In addition to this, there also seems to be no need or desire for U.S. and coalition support, especially by the largest component of the allied forces, that is the Shi'ite paramilitary groups which are very close to Iran. Iran's regional rival Saudi Arabia expressed alarm on Thursday, 5 March. \\"The situation in Tikrit is a prime example of what we are worried about. Iran is taking over the country,\\" Prince Saud al-Faisal, foreign minister of the Sunni Muslim kingdom, said after talks with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. Already there was speculation on the future course of the war against ISIL after the retaking of Tikrit, with analysts hinting at Mosul as the next great target of the allies' thrust northwards along the Tigris River. Prime Minister Abadi congratulated the Iraqi Armed Forces after the capture of Tikrit's city center.  Sectarian and humanitarian concerns  Iraqi Police (seen here in training) have been allegedly involved in a number of serious human rights abuses during the Second Battle of Tikrit. There have been reports of human rights abuses by both sides in the conflict. Videos have emerged allegedly showing Iraqi Special Operations Forces (U.S.-trained) carrying out various atrocities and war crimes against civilians and captured ISIL militants. After the American network ABC News discovered and compiled the list of visual and documentary evidence and submitted these to the Iraqi government, Iraqi officials announced that they had commenced an investigation, while officials from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International who reviewed the evidence assembled by ABC said that it was rare to see so much visual evidence of human rights abuses. The Iraqi Armed Forces are not the only component of the allied army suspected of abuses. The Shia paramilitary groups (trained and supported by Iran) were also accused of playing a part in the human rights violations. This is the case, despite the fact that a significant faction within the allied forces are Sunni tribesman who fought alongside the ISF & paramilitaries against ISIL. A prominent Iraqi Sunni preacher, Abdul Jabbar, has been quoted as saying \\"We ask that actions follow words to punish those who are attacking houses in Tikrit... we are sorry about those acting in revenge that might ignite tribal anger and add to our sectarian problems.\\"  Political ramifications  There were widespread concerns over the Sunnis becoming increasingly disenfranchised and alienated from the rest of Iraq if the aftermath of the battle took on a sectarian tone, with the local population being mistreated and thereby increasing the legitimacy of groups such as ISIL. The most crucial stage of the battle was seen as the aftermath and non- military actions taken by the victors, with General Matin Dempsey stating \\"if what follows the Tikrit operation is not that, if there's no reconstruction that follows it, if there's no inclusivity that follows it, if there's the movement of populations out of their homeland that follows it, then I think we've got a challenge in the campaign.\\" It remains unclear whether Iran can fully reign in the more zealous elements within their conglomeration of Shia paramilitaries, but it is evident that the Iranians have attempted a non- sectarian strategy both politically, by allowing the fall of Nouri Al-Maliki as well as the appointment of a Sunni to the office of defense minister, and militarily by providing arms to willing Sunni tribes. The Iranian foreign minister described sectarianism as the greatest threat to world security. Despite these claims however, the reports of abuse against Sunni citizens of Iraq at the hands of Iran's allies have not ceased completely. The French MP, Jacques Myard stated that the Iranians had been warning the Iraqis with regard to the possibilities of sectarian actions and the negative consequences which follow. There have were also reports of the militias engaging in humanitarian relief by handing out food and supplies to the local populace, who expressed gratitude and expressed their contentedness at having been freed from ISIL rule. A senior adviser to the Iraqi government, Zaid al-Ali, made mention of Shi'ite religious scholars (marja'een) from the city of Najaf travelling to the battlefield to advocate against acts of revenge and abuse. \\"Iranians will try to calm the fears of the Sunnis instead of persecuting them because the Iranian officials know that it is in their best interest to keep the Iraq united,\\" said Hadi Jalo, a Baghdad-based political analyst. \\"For the Iranians, it is easier to dominate one country instead of three separate states.\\" There have also been calls from Saudi Arabia to limit the growing influence of Iran in the country, claiming that Iran is expanding its \\"occupation of Iraq\\". = Asymmetric blow-back = The continuing success of the allied forces (composed of mostly Shia paramilitary groups, though they also contain a significant Sunni contingent), particularly in Sunni areas such as Tikrit, where ISIL had been losing a series of conventional battles, prompted them to utilise more guerilla-like tactics, such as sending out coordinated teams of suicide- bombers to Baghdad, the capital and political nerve centre of the Iraqi government, in order to bring some pressure to bear on the allies. The strategic logic of these operations was explained by an Iraq expert & security analyst Sajad Jiyad; \\"It's keeping the ISF on their toes. It's to let them know that they can strike anywhere, to force them to spread their forces thin. By letting off such a large series of explosions, it's sending a message that they are going to have to put their forces everywhere. It shows that ISIS can carry out these attacks at will and the ISF cannot relax its guard.\\"  Casualties and losses  The main four washing stations (where bodies are taken to be prepared for burial) in Najaf's Wadi-us-Salaam cemetery reported that around 40‚Äì60 bodies had been arriving daily from Tikrit, since the battle started, as of 16 March. On 20 March, reports circulated that 1,000 government fighters (5% of the attacking force) had been killed in the early days of the battle. In contrast, cemetery workers in Najaf reported the arrival of eight militia bodies per day from the entire country, but most from Tikrit. Lt. Gen. Abdul al-Wahab al-Saadi, the commander of the Tikrit offensive, stated 450‚Äì750 ISIL militants had been killed by 30 March. Sadiq Yari, one of the commanders of the Quds Force of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was killed during battle along with Seyed Ali Mousavi, deputy commander of the Kata'ib Imam Ali Brigades.

The multilingual warning (English, Hebrew, Arabic and Russian) on the optical cable manhole cover in Tel Aviv. An Israeli road sign in Hebrew, Arabic, and English. On some road signs (such as the ones above), the Arabic and English are transliterations of the Hebrew place names. On others, the local Arabic or conventional English names are used. The Arabic language in Israel is spoken natively by a large proportion of the population, reaching over 20 percent of the total population, mainly by the Arab citizens of Israel and among the Arabic-speaking Jews from the Arab world. Some refer to the modern Hebrew- influenced Levantine Arabic vernacular, spoken by many Israeli Arabs, as the Israeli Arabic dialect.Mendel, Y. The Creation of Israeli Arabic. Springer 2014.Dr. Dekel, N., Prof. Brosh, H. Languages in Contact: Preliminary Clues on an Emergence of an Israeli Arabic Variety. June 2013. Among most Arabs the vernacular spoken is similar to Palestinian Arabic, while Bedouin traditionally speak their own dialect of Arabic. The Northern part of the country is more influenced with Lebanese Arabic (Central Northern Levantine Arabic), especially among Druze. Many first-generation Mizrahi Jews in Israel can still speak Judeo-Arabic languages, while their Israeli-born descendants have overwhelmingly adopted Hebrew as their first (or sole) language. From the state's establishment in 1948, Standard Arabic was a co-official alongside Hebrew; this changed with the passing of the Basic Law: Israel as the Nation- State of the Jewish People in 2018. Its status is currently that of an auxiliary language and its use in government documents and in the public sphere is still mandated by law.  History  Modern Standard Arabic (also known as Standard Arabic or Literary Arabic), is currently an auxiliary language in Israel and its use on government documents is mandated by law. Spoken Arabic dialects are spoken primarily by Arab citizens of Israel and Israeli Druze, as well as by some Mizrahi Jews, particularly those of the older generation who immigrated from Arabic-speaking countries. In 1949, 156,000 Palestinian Arabs were left inside Israel's armistice line, most of whom did not speak Hebrew. Today the majority of Arab Israelis, who constitute over a fifth of the Israeli population, speak Hebrew fluently, as a second language. For many years the Israeli authorities were reluctant to use Arabic, except when explicitly ordered by law (for example, in warnings on dangerous chemicals), or when addressing the Arabic-speaking population. This has changed following a November 2000 supreme court ruling which ruled that although second to Hebrew, the use of Arabic should be much more extensive. Since then, all road signs, food labels, and messages published or posted by the government must also be translated into Literary Arabic, unless being issued by the local authority of an exclusively Hebrew-speaking community. Arabic was always considered a legitimate language for use in the Knesset, but only rarely have Arabic-speaking Knesset members made use of this privilege, as the majority of the members of Knesset are not sufficiently fluent in Arabic. Arabic lessons are widespread in Hebrew-speaking schools in from the seventh through ninth grades. Those who wish to do so may opt to continue their Arabic studies through the twelfth grade and take an Arabic matriculation exam. Many students who graduate high school with a high level of proficiency in Arabic are placed in positions in the army where they can utilize this language. Arabic courses are widespread in the Israel Defense Forces, where all soldiers are required to learn how to de-escalate potential terror attacks in both Hebrew and Arabic. Combat soldiers who are placed in parts of the West Bank and who deal with the civilian population on a daily basis are often sent to brief Arabic courses and Arabic use is widespread in all military intelligence positions. Israel's large population of Arabic- speakers, its location in the Middle East, decades of globalization, and the Mizrahi heritage of the majority of Israel's Jewish population have all influenced spoken Hebrew in Israel. After Hebrew and English, Arabic songs (sung both by native Arab speakers and by Mizrahi Israelis) are frequently played on the radio. A-WA's debut single, Habib-Galbi, released in 2015, was the first Arabic language song to reach number 1 on Israeli radio and Arabic plays a very prominent role in the \\"slang\\" (street language) of Israel's youth. In addition, when Eliezer Ben Yehuda, the pioneer of the Hebrew language's modern revival, began creating new Hebrew words to adapt to the modern world, he preferred borrowing words from Arabic and Aramaic (both Semitic languages, like Hebrew) than languages that were more linguistically removed from Hebrew. This modern revival, in addition to centuries of osmosis between the two neighbor-languages, have resulted in striking similarities in the two language's grammar and vocabulary. In March 2007, the Knesset approved a new law calling for the establishment of an Arabic Language Academy similar to the Academy of the Hebrew Language. This institute was established in 2008, its center is in Haifa and it is currently headed by Prof. Mahmud Ghanayem.The law in Hebrew in the Israeli official gazette (publication no. 2092 from 28 March 2007). In 2008, a group of Knesset members proposed a bill to remove Arabic's status as an official language. Similar bills have been proposed in 2011 and 2014. In 2009, Israel Katz, the transport minister, announced that signs on all major roads in Israel, East Jerusalem and possibly parts of the West Bank would be amended, replacing English and Arabic place names with straight transliterations of the Hebrew name. Currently most road signs are in all three languages. Nazareth, for example, would become \\"Natzrat\\". The Transport Ministry said signs would be replaced gradually as necessary due to wear and tear. This has been criticized as an attempt by the Israeli government to erase the Arabic language and Palestinian heritage in Israel.CounterPunch, 17 July 2009, Israeli Road Signs: Wiping Arabic Names Off the Map BBC, 13 July 2009, Row over 'standard' Hebrew signs Israel's governmental names' committee unanimously rejected that suggestion in 2011.

The club was constituted in 1887, and played its first game in 1888. Celtic play their home games at Celtic Park having moved there in 1892 from their original ground nearby. By 1994, Celtic had endured several years of decline and were encountering difficulties on and off the park. Expatriate businessman Fergus McCann wrested control of the club from the family dynasties that had run Celtic since its founding. The club was reconstituted as a PLC and floated on the stock market, raising ¬£14 million. The finance provided funding for the rebuilding of Celtic Park into a 60,000 all-seated stadium, the largest football stadium in Scotland. The team improved over the years that followed and in 1998 won the league title, their first championship success in ten years. The arrival of Martin O'Neill as manager in 2000 saw the club become one of two dominant forces in Scotland, winning three league titles in five years and reaching the UEFA Cup Final in 2003. The UEFA Cup final turnout by Celtic FC fans saw the club awarded the ‚ÄúBest Fans in Europe‚Äù by UEFA for that season. In 2005‚Äì06, Celtic's home games attracted an average attendance of 58,149, placing Celtic at the time behind only Manchester United and Newcastle United in terms of highest average attendance for any football club in the United Kingdom. Celtic are currently managed by Neil Lennon, who was appointed on a permanent basis after his Scottish Cup victory over Hearts in May 2019, having earlier in the season taken over on a caretaker basis following Brendan Rodgers' departure from the club. The Fergus McCann era (1994‚Äì1999) The Bank of Scotland informed Celtic on 3 March 1994 that it was calling in receivers as a result of the club exceeding a ¬£5 million overdraft. Expatriate businessman Fergus McCann, however, wrested control of the club from the family dynasties which had controlled Celtic since its founding, purchasing the club for a reported ¬£9 million. According to media reports, McCann took over the club minutes before it was to be declared bankrupt. At this time, the club was an estimated ¬£7 million in debt, and attendances at Parkhead frequently dipped below 20,000. The old board had insisted on a limit of only 7,000 season tickets, on the basis that \\"season tickets are more trouble than they're worth\\". Shortly prior to the takeover, the club was only valued at around ¬£20,000 due to the ordinary shares being artificially valued at ¬£1 each and the regulations of the private limited company which decreed that shares could only be traded with the permission of the directors, who had first refusal on any that became available. Most significantly, the shares were not allowed to \\"float\\" to their true value, as a result of which directors were able to purchase them for around ¬£3 each. Bulk holders such as Michael Kelly, Chris White and David Smith insisted on being paid around ¬£300 per share, leaving McCann resentful over the disappearance of funds that could have been used in the resuscitation of the business. In order to alleviate the club's debt, McCann reconstituted the then privately owned Celtic Football & Athletic Company Limited into a public limited company ‚Äì Celtic PLC. To finance this restructuring, McCann set up a share issue which generated ¬£14 million, one of the most successful stock market flotations in British financial history. =Tommy Burns spell= Celtic playing against Airdrie in the 1995 Scottish Cup Final; this was their first trophy since 1989 On the playing side, manager Lou Macari was sacked by McCann and replaced in the summer of 1994 by former Celtic player Tommy Burns, with Billy Stark as his assistant. Former player and manager Davie Hay also returned to the club, as chief scout. Celtic played their home games at Hampden Park in the first season under the new regime due to the redevelopment of Celtic Park. Celtic were poor in the league that season, but managed to win their first trophy in six years when they defeated Airdrie 1‚Äì0 in the Scottish Cup Final on 27 May 1995. The winning goal was scored by Dutch striker Pierre van Hooijdonk, who had been signed several months earlier from NAC Breda for ¬£1.2 million. The following season saw Celtic return to their home ground at Celtic Park. Former East German international striker Andreas Thom was signed over the summer for a then club record fee of ¬£2.2 million. During the pre-season, defender Tony Mowbray persuaded his teammates to engage in a pre-match huddle prior to a friendly against German side Kickers Emden in an effort to boost the players' camaraderie and togetherness. Although Mowbray would leave the club several weeks later, the pre-match huddle remains a constant ritual that is performed by Celtic players to this day prior to every game. Tommy Burns' second season saw him successfully restore a more attacking style of play to the side. The new strike pairing of Van Hooijdonk and Thom forged an accomplished partnership up front. The midfield duo of Paul McStay and John Collins were integral to Celtic's attractive football and Jackie McNamara and Simon Donnelly won praise for their link-up play on the right. Celtic only lost one league match during the 1995‚Äì96 season, but for all the plaudits they received, they remained unable to prevent Rangers from winning an eighth- straight league title. During this time, the club was under pressure to invest heavily in playing talent ‚Äì particularly from the fans ‚Äì to thwart Rangers' attempts to equal and surpass the nine-in-a-row record Celtic held. McCann was often criticised by the fans and media for his perceived frugality, but further signings were made in 1996, with Portuguese striker Jorge Cadete and Italian winger Paolo Di Canio arriving at Celtic Park. The 1996‚Äì97 season saw Tommy Burns under intense media scrutiny and pressure from the supporters as Rangers closed in on their ninth successive league title. Despite Van Hooijdonk, Cadete and Di Canio having outstanding seasons as individual players, Celtic struggled to match the form of the previous season. John Collins had left for Monaco in the summer and Paul McStay was toiling with injury. As a result, individual performances were unable to make up for the lack of overall team coherence and Celtic finished the season trophy-less, with Rangers winning their ninth successive league title and equalling Celtic's record set under Jock Stein. McCann found himself embroiled in contractual disputes with the trio of Van Hooijdonk, Cadete and Di Canio, labelling them the \\"Three Amigos\\". McCann refused to cave in to what he considered the excessive demands of these foreign mercurial talents and, to the frustration of fans, the three each left the club under a cloud, albeit for large transfer fees. With just three weeks left of the 1996‚Äì97 season, Burns was sacked, with the club's remaining coaching staff also leaving at the end of the season. Various names were touted in the media as being likely to take over, however McCann made a surprising choice in Dutch coach Wim Jansen. Furthermore, it was announced that the traditional manager's position at Celtic had been abolished, with the responsibilities to be split between the new roles of a head coach (Jansen) who would deal with coaching, tactics and team selection, and a general manager to deal with contracts and general administration duties. The office of the general manager was somewhat controversially taken up by solicitor and former TV football commentator Jock Brown. Davie Hay was promoted from his scouting role to Assistant General Manager, whilst former Celtic player Murdo MacLeod was appointed as assistant coach to Jansen. =League title under Jansen= The summer of 1997 saw substantial changes to Celtic's playing personnel. Scottish internationalists Darren Jackson and Craig Burley were Jansen's first signings, closely followed by Dutch winger Regi Blinker, Danish centre-half Marc Rieper and, more significantly, Swedish attacker Henrik Larsson from Feyenoord in a ¬£650,000 deal. Bradford City reserve goalkeeper Jonathan Gould also arrived at Celtic Park in a low-key transfer deal. Club captain Paul McStay, however, retired from playing that summer due to injury, after a playing career of 15 years and 678 appearances for the club. Rangers started the 1997‚Äì98 season as strong favourites for the league title and had themselves invested heavily over the summer in new players. Celtic made a poor start to the season, losing their first two league matches, but soon began to find their feet. Marc Rieper and Alan Stubbs quickly formed an impressive understanding in central defence, while Craig Burley proved to be a revelation in midfield with his energetic play and important goals. Jonathan Gould became the team's first choice goalkeeper and had an excellent season. Henrik Larsson had made an uninspiring start at Celtic, gifting Hibernian's Chic Charnley the winning goal through a careless pass on his debut and then scoring an own-goal in a UEFA Cup tie (Celtic still triumphed 6‚Äì3 on the night and won on aggregate). The Swede, however, soon established himself as a pivotal player in the side, at this time playing just off the main strikers. An injury time equaliser from Alan Stubbs in November 1997 against Rangers saw Celtic remain behind the Ibrox club in the league, but stay within reaching distance. The next Old Firm encounter at New Year saw Celtic win 2‚Äì0 with goals from Craig Burley and recent signing from Borussia Dortmund, Paul Lambert. Over the following months, Celtic and Rangers each had spells at the top of the table, and as the season reached its climax, both sides dropped unexpected points as nerves took hold. Celtic eventually clinched the league title win a 2‚Äì0 win over St Johnstone on the last day of the season, their first championship title in ten years. Despite the triumph, the title-winning celebrations soon soured when Wim Jansen made good his long held threat to resign, after difficulties working with Jock Brown and Fergus McCann. Jansen resigned just two days after the club sealed the title, with Brown widely portrayed as the villain of the piece. Davie Hay had been controversially sacked by Brown earlier in the season and Jansen's assistant, Murdo MacLeod, was sacked a week after Jansen's resignation. =Venglo≈° spell= A number of high-profile names were proferred as the replacement for Jansen, but the man eventually appointed by Celtic was Slovakian Jozef Venglo≈°. Many fans, swayed doubtless by the local media, were disappointed and angry at the decision, citing Venglo≈°' poor record whilst in charge of English club Aston Villa some years before. Following early exits in the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup and League Cup, and a poor start to their league campaign, Celtic and Venglo≈° were subject to intense media scrutiny. The lack of players signed during the close season was one area in which the club were strongly criticised for. Amidst the almost constant negative publicity surrounding the club, Jock Brown resigned in November 1998. Players did, however, begin to arrive in the late autumn: Norwegian defender Vidar Riseth, Swedish defensive midfielder Johan Mj√§llby, Slovakian play-maker ƒΩubom√≠r Moravƒç√≠k and Australian striker Mark Viduka all joined. Following this, Celtic's fortunes began to turn when they won 5‚Äì1 against Rangers, Larsson and Moravƒç√≠k both scoring twice. Venglo≈° now had Celtic playing good football and his deployment of Larsson as an out-and-out striker was proving to be a huge success, with the Swede eventually going on to score 38 goals that season. The signing of Lubomir Moravƒç√≠k had initially been ridiculed by the Scottish media, but the Slovakian's skills soon won the doubters over. Celtic rallied in the league but were still unable to prevent Rangers from winning the championship. Defeat in the Scottish Cup final, also against Rangers, only confirmed the club's lack of progress on the field. The redeveloped Celtic Park - a 60,832 capacity stadium Shortly after the end of the season, Venglo≈° resigned on health grounds but remained as an advisor and European scout for the club for a brief period. Although his tenure as head coach was strained, Venglo≈° is generally fondly regarded by fans, in particular for the signing of Moravƒç√≠k. In March 1999, Scottish Football Association (SFA) Chief Executive Jim Farry was fired as a result of him deliberately delaying the registration of Jorge Cadete in 1996. The delay resulted in Cadete missing several matches for Celtic he could have played in, in particular a Scottish Cup semi-final tie against Rangers which Celtic lost 2‚Äì1. Fergus McCann had complained about the matter initially to the SFA and then to an independent commission, who subsequently found Farry guilty of gross misconduct. Farry was sacked days after the commission's findings. On taking over Celtic in 1994, Fergus McCann stated that he would be only be at the club for five years. In September 1999, he officially announced that his majority stake in Celtic was for sale. By this time, the redevelopment of Celtic Park into a 60,000 all-seated capacity stadium was complete, at a cost of ¬£40 million., and the club had 53,000 season ticket holders. The club was now a successful business and the team vastly improved from when he took over in 1994. McCann sold his shares for ¬£40 million, making a profit of ¬£31 million on his initial investment. After McCann's exit, Irish billionaire Dermot Desmond was left as the largest shareholder, with a 20% stake in the club. Allan MacDonald was appointed chief executive/managing director. Martin O'Neill (1999‚Äì2005) =Barnes & Dalglish= The 1999‚Äì2000 season is widely considered one of the biggest disasters in the club's history. Kenny Dalglish returned to the club to fill the General Manager's post (which had been vacant since the departure of Jock Brown), while the head coach position was filled by former Liverpool and England player John Barnes. Barnes had never managed a professional club, and the fans' worst fears were realised when Celtic's title challenge drastically faltered shortly after the winter break. Following a series of poor results ‚Äì including elimination from the UEFA Cup and a broken leg away against Lyon for Henrik Larsson ‚Äì Rangers increased their lead at the top of the Scottish Premier League table and demands for Barnes to be sacked began. On 8 February 2000, Celtic hosted a rearranged Scottish Cup tie at home to Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Caley Thistle were an in-form side, fourth-placed in Division 1, although only in the Scottish Football League since 1994. Nevertheless, the match was still widely expected to be an easy victory for Celtic. However, Caley Thistle won the match 3‚Äì1 in one of the biggest Scottish Cup upsets ever, which sparked a protest involving over a hundred Celtic fans outside the stadium. The memorable headline in The Sun newspaper the following day read: \\"Super Caley Go Ballistic, Celtic Are Atrocious\\". Having refused to speak to the press after the match, Barnes held a press conference the next day, and implied that a dispute between him and Mark Viduka at half-time had badly unsettled the team and been responsible for the defeat. Barnes was sacked the following morning. Kenny Dalglish took over as head coach until the end of the season, and brought Tommy Burns back to assist him. While Dalglish generally retained the respect of the supporters, Celtic's league form deteriorated further and the club finished 21 points behind Rangers at the end of the season. A League Cup final victory over Aberdeen was the only consolation in one of the most embarrassing periods of the club's history. =The arrival of O'Neill= Following the sacking of John Barnes, Guus Hiddink emerged as Celtic chief executive Alan MacDonald's initial choice to take over as manager. However, Hiddink's apparent lack of interest in the Celtic post and the intervention of majority shareholder Dermot Desmond saw Leicester City manager Martin O'Neill come to the fore as the club's primary target. Martin O'Neill Martin O'Neill ‚Äì from Kilrea, Northern Ireland, a former European Cup winner in his playing days with Nottingham Forest ‚Äì arrived at the club in the wake of the Barnes/Dalglish fiasco in June 2000. O'Neill took full charge of all team matters, effectively re-establishing the traditional role of \\"manager\\" at Celtic. With the \\"general manager\\" role now redundant, Dalglish was sacked by Celtic at the end of June. Over the summer, O'Neill bought Chris Sutton from Chelsea for a club record ¬£6 million, while Mark Viduka moved south to join Leeds United. Belgian international centre-half Joos Valgaeren also arrived in the summer in a bid by O'Neill to shore up a porous Celtic defence. O'Neill's signings quickly settled in at Celtic; Sutton scored the winning goal on the first of the day of the season in a 2‚Äì1 win over Dundee United, while Valgaeren linked up well with Alan Stubbs and Tom Boyd in the centre of defence. Further players arrived over the course of 2000‚Äì01; left-sided midfielder Alan Thompson was signed from Aston Villa, the pacy Didier Agathe arrived from Hibernian, centre-half Ramon Vega headed north on loan from Tottenham Hotspur, goalkeeper Rab Douglas was signed up from Dundee and midfielder Neil Lennon was signed from O'Neill's old club Leicester City. That season saw Celtic go on to win their first domestic treble since 1969, winning the League, Scottish Cup and League Cup. O'Neill became only the second Celtic manager to achieve this, after Jock Stein. The season was also additionally memorable because of some excellent results against rivals Rangers. A famous 6‚Äì2 victory in the opening Old Firm encounter of the season at Celtic Park proved to everyone that the balance of power in Scotland had shifted. Two further league victories against Rangers: 1‚Äì0 (at Celtic Park), and 3‚Äì0 (at Ibrox) ensured O'Neill's first league title was won by a considerable distance. O'Neill's debut season also saw outstanding performances produced by players already at Celtic. Henrik Larsson scored 53 goals in all competitions and won the European Golden Shoe with his 35 league goals. Larsson was voted both SPFA and Scottish Football Writers Player of the Year. Young Bulgarian midfielder Stiliyan Petrov impressed as well, having been signed the previous season by John Barnes. In 2001, the 21-year-old Bulgarian became the first foreign winner of the SPFA Young Player of the Year award. =Impact in Europe= Celtic further strengthened their squad ‚Äì in every sense ‚Äì for the 2001‚Äì02 season with the signings of the powerfully-built Guinean defender Bobo Bald√© and Welsh striker John Hartson. On 8 August 2001, Celtic played Ajax in Amsterdam in the first leg of the qualifier tie for the 2001‚Äì02 Champions League, turning in an outstanding performance. First-half goals from Dutch winger Bobby Petta and Didier Agathe gave Celtic a 2‚Äì1 lead at half-time. Chris Sutton added a third in the second half with a powerful header to give Celtic an impressive 3‚Äì1 win. A nervy second leg performance at Parkhead saw Celtic lose 0‚Äì1 on the night but progress to the group stages on aggregate, their first involvement in the Champions League group stages since the redevelopment of the tournament in the 1990s. This was the first of three occasions that O'Neill's Celtic side qualified for the group stage of the Champions League, and on the only occasion they failed, they went on to reach the final of the UEFA Cup. Celtic made their debut in the group stages of the Champions League on 18 September 2001, losing 2‚Äì3 to Juventus in Turin. Celtic had recovered from a 2‚Äì0 deficit to level the match at 2‚Äì2, but lost a third goal near the end from a controversial penalty. Celtic recovered from that set-back to win their next two home matches against Porto and Rosenborg, but lost the away matches against the same opposition. Celtic's final group match was against Juventus at Parkhead on 31 October 2001. It was a memorable European night in Glasgow as a Chris Sutton brace and an outstanding performance from ƒΩubom√≠r Moravƒç√≠k helped Celtic to a famous 4‚Äì3 win. Despite finishing the group with nine points, however, Celtic failed to qualify for the next round and parachuted into the UEFA Cup. Celtic were drawn against Valencia in the UEFA Cup, and in the first leg in Spain had goalkeeper Rab Douglas to thank for keeping the score to a manageable 0‚Äì1 defeat. The second leg in Glasgow saw Henrik Larsson scoring to give Celtic a 1‚Äì0 win after 90 minutes to level the tie on aggregate. As no goals were scored during extra- time, the tie went to penalty-kicks. Celtic lost the penalty shoot-out and were knocked out. Celtic cruised to their second successive league title in 2001‚Äì02, their first back-to-back titles in 20 years and finished 18 points clear of second-placed Rangers. Rangers, under new manager Alex McLeish, did however enjoy a modicum of revenge in the cup tournaments, beating Celtic 2‚Äì1 in the semi-final of the League Cup and twice coming from behind in the Scottish Cup Final in May 2002 to win 3‚Äì2 through a last-minute goal. O'Neill's third season at Celtic, 2002‚Äì03, was probably the most memorable, even although the club did not win any silverware. The domestic cup tournaments again eluded Celtic; in the space of a week in March 2003, Celtic lost 2‚Äì1 to Rangers in the League Cup final and then were knocked out of the Scottish Cup a week later at the fourth round stage by Inverness Caledonian Thistle. The league campaign was a tight contest, and going into the last fixture both Celtic and Rangers were level on points. Both sides recorded high-scoring wins in their respective fixtures ‚Äì Celtic won 4‚Äì0 at Kilmarnock, but Rangers' 6‚Äì1 win at Ibrox over Dumfermline Athletic saw them win the league on goal difference. It was in Europe, however, that Celtic made their mark. Celtic's European campaign in 2002‚Äì03 began somewhat inauspiciously when they were beaten by Basel on away goals in a qualifier tie for the Champions League. Celtic dropped into the UEFA Cup, and in the first round eased to a 10‚Äì1 aggregate win over Lithuanian minnows FK S≈´duva. The next round, Celtic were paired with Blackburn Rovers, managed by former Rangers player-manager Graeme Souness Celtic were poor in the first leg at Parkhead, but a Henrik Larsson goal five minutes from full-time secured a crucial 1‚Äì0 win on the night and a narrow lead to take down to Ewood Park.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/3037111/Larsson-gives-Celtic-the- edge.html In the build-up to the return match, Blackburn captain Gary Flitcroft made public that Souness had commented in the dressing room after the first game that Blackburn were the better side and should have won: \\"That was men against boys.\\" In the second leg, Celtic showed much more composure and scored after 14 minutes through Larsson. Celtic controlled the game after that and Chris Sutton scored another goal for Celtic in the second half, with Celtic winning 2‚Äì0 on the night and 3‚Äì0 on aggregate. Celtic's third round UEFA cup opponents were Celta de Vigo. In a first-leg overshadowed by eccentric refereeing, Larsson scored the only goal of the game in Glasgow. The return match in Spain was won 2‚Äì1 by Celta, levelling the aggregate score at 2‚Äì2, but John Hartson's away goal won the tie for Celtic. This was the first time ever that Celtic had knocked out a Spanish club in European competition, and also the first time in 23 years that Celtic had remained in European competition beyond Christmas. Celtic fans at the UEFA Cup Final in Seville German Bundesliga team VfB Stuttgart were Celtic's fourth round opponents in the Spring of 2003. Celtic came from behind to win the first leg 3‚Äì1 at Parkhead. In the second leg, Celtic went 2‚Äì0 up early on, but a comeback by Stuttgart saw the Bundesliga side win 3‚Äì2 on the night; Celtic however won 5‚Äì4 on aggregate. The quarter-finals saw another English Premier League opponent for Celtic: Liverpool. The first leg took place at Celtic Park on 13 March 2003. The first leg ended 1‚Äì1 with Larsson scoring for Celtic in the first minute but the away goal gave Liverpool the advantage going in to their home tie at Anfield. During the first leg, Liverpool player El Hadji Diouf spat at a Celtic supporter, and was later fined ¬£5,000 at Glasgow's Sheriff Court for the incident. The return match at Anfield took place the following week. Celtic won 2‚Äì0, with the goals coming from an Alan Thompson free-kick and a long-range strike from John Hartson. Celtic's first European semi-final since the early 1970s saw them paired against Portuguese side Boavista. Celtic drew 1‚Äì1 in the first game at Parkhead, but a Henrik Larsson goal in the 80th minute of the return match in Portugal won the tie and ensured Celtic's progress to the UEFA Cup final. In May 2003, around 80,000 Celtic fans travelled to watch the club compete in the final, held in Seville. Celtic lost the final on 21 May 2003 3‚Äì2 to Porto after extra time, despite two goals from Henrik Larsson during normal play. Celtic's cause was not helped by the late sending-off of defender Bobo Bald√© and the referee's over-indulgence of Porto's time-wasting and their players' persistent feigning of injury. However, the exemplary conduct of the thousands of travelling Celtic supporters received widespread praise from the people of Seville and the fans were awarded prestigious Fair Play Awards from both FIFA and UEFA \\"for their extraordinarily loyal and sporting behaviour\\". =Continued success= Celtic and Rangers fans at Parkhead in 2004 Celtic regained the SPL title in 2003‚Äì04 in emphatic manner, winning by a margin of 18 points and scoring over 100 goals. The league campaign also saw Celtic win 25 games in a row, setting a new British record. Celtic recorded five wins (four in the league, one in the Scottish Cup) over rivals Rangers; a last minute Chris Sutton goal in May 2004 giving Celtic a 1‚Äì0 win in the final Old Firm fixture of the season and their first whitewash of wins over their rivals for over 30 years. Celtic qualified for the Champions League in 2003‚Äì04, but again could only finish third in the group stages and dropped into the UEFA Cup. After a straightforward aggregate win over FK Teplice, Celtic were drawn against Barcelona in the round of 16. A dramatic first leg in Glasgow saw Celtic win 1‚Äì0 through an Alan Thompson goal, but goalkeeper Rab Douglas and Barcelona's Thiago Motta were sent off during half-time for fighting in the tunnel. The return match in Spain saw Celtic fielding 19-year-old reserve goalkeeper David Marshall in place of Douglas and young defender John Kennedy standing in for Bobo Bald√©, who was also suspended. Celtic found themselves under a sustained barrage of pressure, but the two youngsters turned in outstanding performances. Marshall pulled off outstanding saves from Luis Enrique and Luis Garc√≠a, while Kennedy made a number of great tackles to keep Barcelona at bay. Celtic held out for a scoreless draw on the night to win on aggregate and progress to the quarter- finals. Celtic's run in Europe was finally ended in the next round by another Spanish side, Villarreal, losing 3‚Äì1 on aggregate. The Scottish Cup final was reached with ease; Celtic conceding only one goal as they knocked out Ross County, Hearts, Rangers and Livingston en route. The final against Dunfermline took place on 22 May 2004 and was the last match Henrik Larsson played for the club. The Swede ended his Celtic career on a high note, scoring twice as Celtic came from behind to win 3‚Äì1, completing a league and cup double for the season. The following season (2004‚Äì05), O'Neill's last at the club, saw Celtic struggle to maintain their dominance of recent years. Nevertheless, they took an early lead in the league campaign and won their first encounter against Rangers in August 2004, their seventh consecutive win in Old Firm games. The league contest went to the final day of the season with Celtic needing to win away at Motherwell to guarantee the title. Celtic led for most of the match, and with two minutes of normal time remaining looked set for another SPL title. However, two late Scott McDonald goals for Motherwell saw Celtic beaten 2‚Äì1 and hand the title to rivals Rangers. The season did end in silverware for Celtic as they retained the Scottish Cup, defeating Dundee United 1‚Äì0 in the final. At the end of the season, Martin O'Neill parted ways with the club, to care for his ill wife. Under O'Neill's five year leadership, Celtic won the league three times, three Scottish Cup finals and the League Cup once. In European competition, teams such as Juventus, Porto, Valencia, and Barcelona all visited Glasgow to face Celtic and returned home defeated. He led Celtic to their first European final in 33 years, albeit losing narrowly after extra time. Celtic also commenced an unbeaten run of 77 home matches, which spanned from 2001 to 2004 and notched up an SPL record for the most consecutive wins in a single season. In conclusion, O'Neill's tenure as manager at Celtic was the club's most successful period since the time of Jock Stein. Gordon Strachan and Tony Mowbray (2005‚Äì2010) Gordon Strachan Gordon Strachan was announced in June 2005 as Martin O'Neill's replacement, after apparently being recommended by O'Neill himself. Strachan faced a number of challenges, not least in inheriting an aged squad who were highly expensive and one that had still failed to replace the talismanic Henrik Larsson. Strachan made an unpromising start, in particular his first game in which Celtic lost 0‚Äì5 to Slovakian side Artmedia Bratislava and recorded their worst ever European result, Celtic, however, quickly regained form and confidence and went on to become the fastest team to win the SPL championship ever, along with the League Cup in the 2005‚Äì06 season. The title was clinched before the league was split with a 1‚Äì0 home victory over second-placed Hearts. Shaun Maloney had an outstanding season for Celtic and became the first player to win both Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year awards from PFA Scotland in the same season. Celtic's home games that season attracted an average attendance of 58,149, placing Celtic at the time behind only Manchester United in terms of highest average attendance for any football club in the UK. Celtic Chairman 2007-2011, John ReidDuring the 2006‚Äì07 season Celtic continued their domination of the Scottish Premier League, despite a huge effort by Strachan and the club to reduce the wage bill. Expensive mainstays of the O'Neill years such as Hartson and Sutton, who on average delivered 40 goals per season between them, were moved on and replaced by far younger, and less expensive, players. The team proved unerringly consistent, as had O'Neill's, despite their youth and comparative lack of experience. By the close of the January transfer window, Celtic were 19 points ahead of second-placed Rangers, something which may have been a large contribution to a complete loss of form and partial loss of points in the second half of the season. They completed their quest for back-to-back titles on 22 April 2007 with a 2‚Äì1 win against Kilmarnock. Shunsuke Nakamura ensured the victory with a goal from a free kick from 25 yards in the final minute, leaving Celtic 13 points clear of Rangers with four matches remaining. That season also saw Strachan guide Celtic into last 16 of the Champions League for the first time. Celtic secured their progress from the group stages courtesy of Shunsuke Nakamura's 30-yard free- kick against Manchester United in a 1‚Äì0 win at Parkhead. The win on the night, and qualification to the last 16, was clinched when Artur Boruc saved Louis Saha's 88th-minute penalty kick. Celtic lost 0‚Äì1 in the last 16 round to the eventual winners of the cup, Milan, after a goal from Kak√° in extra time. On 26 May 2007, Celtic again won the Scottish Cup, for a 34th time, beating Dunfermline 1‚Äì0, completing another league and cup double. The Cup final was also captain Neil Lennon's final appearance as a Celtic player. On 28 September 2007 it was announced John Reid would become chairman of Celtic and he took over from Brian Quinn on 7 November. Reid is a lifelong supporter of the club and described the appointment as \\"the greatest honour of my life\\". His appointment was approved by a large majority of shareholders, though many fans opposed the motion at Celtic's annual general meeting over Reid's role in the British Government during the Iraq War. The start of Strachan's third season saw further changes to the team. Neil Lennon had left in the summer and centre-half Stephen McManus was now made captain of the side.McManus named new Celtic captain, BBC Sport, 31 July 2007 In May, Celtic completed the signing of midfielder Scott Brown from Hibernian for a fee of around ¬£4.4 million, the largest transfer fee exchanged between two Scottish clubs. Motherwell striker Scott McDonald also arrived at Celtic Park, signed for a fee of ¬£700,000, and having been the player who famously scored two late goals against Celtic on the last day of the season in 2005 to effectively hand Rangers the title. Shunsuke Nakamura against Falkirk in December 2006 As the 2007‚Äì08 season progressed, Celtic found themselves embroiled in a tight contest with Rangers for the SPL title. Celtic led for the early part of the season, but a series of poor results in the winter and early spring saw Rangers overtake them. A Kevin Thomson goal on 31 March 2008 gave Rangers a 1‚Äì0 win at Ibrox over Celtic, leaving Celtic trailing their rivals in the league by six points. A few days later, Neil Lennon returned to Celtic as a coach, effectively replacing first-team coach Tommy Burns, who was being treated for cancer. A dramatic, and seemingly unlikely, turnaround in Celtic's fortunes then began on 16 April, when the Old Firm met again at Celtic Park. A re-invigorated Celtic dominated the opening proceedings and took the lead when Shunsuke Nakamura scored with a spectacular swerving shot from 30 yards. Nacho Novo equalised for Rangers early in the second half, but Celtic got a chance to retake the lead when Nakamura's curling shot was handled off the line by Rangers defender Carlos Cu√©llar, who was sent off. Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, however, despite having an injured ankle, saved Scott McDonald's penalty kick. Rangers looked like holding on for a vital point until in the third minute of injury time Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink bundled the ball into the goal to clinch a 2‚Äì1 win for Celtic. Celtic began to claw back on Rangers lead in the league, and by the time of the final league fixture of the season were league leaders. A Vennegoor of Hesselink headed goal gave Celtic a 1‚Äì0 win on the night away at Dundee United, clinching the title for Celtic. This ensured Strachan's place in the history books of Celtic, becoming only the third manager to win three successive league titles, behind Willie Maley and Jock Stein. The victory was also dedicated to the memory of Tommy Burns, former player, manager and coach, who had died earlier that week. Maiej Zurawski in action for Celtic in a pre-season game against FC Basel in July 2007 The 2007‚Äì08 season saw Celtic again taking part in the Champions League. Celtic qualified for the group stages by knocking out Spartak Moscow in the prelims, the tie eventually going to penalty kicks with Artur Boruc saving twice. Celtic won all three home games in the group stages; a last minute Scott McDonald goal giving Celtic a 2‚Äì1 win over Milan, Aiden McGeady scoring the only goal in a 1‚Äì0 win over Benfica and Massimo Donati scoring an injury time winner against Shakhtar Donetsk. Despite losing all three of their corresponding away fixtures, Celtic qualified for the round of 16 for the second successive season. In the first leg of the round of 16 tie against Barcelona, Celtic twice took the lead at Parkhead, but finished losing 3‚Äì2. They were unable to recover the deficit in the return match and were knocked out. In March 2009, Celtic won the League Cup beating Rangers 2‚Äì0 in the final after extra time. Celtic failed to win the SPL title, finishing second to Rangers and Strachan resigned from the manager's position at the end of the season. Tony Mowbray, showing the strain Tony Mowbray was announced as the replacement for Strachan on 16 June 2009. He moved from his managerial post at West Bromwich Albion. It was a return to Celtic for the Englishman after playing there for four years between 1991 and 1995 and is considered to be the player who started the famous Celtic prematch \\"Huddle\\". He promised a \\"Barcelona-esque\\" style of football, and more attacking play, never afraid to hide his admiration for the likes of Arsenal manager Ars√®ne Wenger. Things started well, he won his first trophy shortly after signing for Celtic, with victory in the Wembley Cup. He brought Marc-Antoine Fortun√©, Landry N'Gu√©mo and Danny Fox to the club. Because of the previous season league position, two qualifying rounds were required to enter the Champions league group stages. After a 1‚Äì0 loss to Dynamo Moscow at home, Mowbray lead Celtic to a 2‚Äì0 win in Moscow, ending a long run of not winning any away games in the Champions league. This was also the first time ever that Celtic had won a European tie after losing the first keg at home. Celtic were then drawn with English side Arsenal. Celtic lost the home leg, 2‚Äì0. In the return leg in the Emirates Stadium, Celtic were holding Arsenal 0‚Äì0 until a dive by Arsenal striker Eduardo won them a penalty, which Eduardo stepped up to put the ball past Artur Boruc from the spot, sending Arsenal en route to a 3‚Äì1 win. A rejuvenated Massimo Donati scored Celtic's only goal in the last minute. Things began to slide after that though, Celtic began hemorrhaging points to the so-called \\"smaller teams\\" in the league. Celtic then exited the UEFA Europa League before Christmas despite a promising draw of group opponents. Despite a big squad shake-up in the January transfer window, including the departure of club captain Stephen McManus (loaned to Middlesbrough),https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jan/25/stephen- macmanus-celtic-middlesbrough leading goalscorer Scott McDonald, Barry Robson, the newly acquired Danny Foxhttps://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/danny-fox-celtic-money- men-1049456 and a number of other fringe players; and the bringing in of Republic of Ireland striker Robbie Keane, Diomansy Kamarahttps://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/feb/01/celtic-diomansy-kamara- tony-mowbray and others, Tony Mowbray was sacked by the club the day after their 4‚Äì0 defeat by St Mirren on 24 March 2010 and Neil Lennon took charge for the remainder of the 2009‚Äì10 season. Neil Lennon (2010‚Äì2014) =\\"Bring back the thunder\\"= Former Celtic captain, Neil Lennon Neil Lennon became the caretaker manager after Tony Mowbray was fired, bringing in former teammate Johan Mj√§llby as his assistant. Celtic were ten points behind Rangers, who had played two less games, when Lennon took over. Despite having no management experience Lennon lead Celtic to eight wins from the eight remaining league matches, finishing six points behind their Old Firm rivals who they also beat 2‚Äì1 in the final Old Firm match of the season. This provided a much needed morale boost to the club. Celtic's one chance for silverware was the Scottish Cup, they faced First Division Ross County in the semi-final but lost 2‚Äì0. In the aftermath of the Ross County match, Lennon spoke frankly about his opinion of the players and their performances over the course of the season; he said that the players had lacked \\"hunger and desire\\" and that whether he was installed as manager or not, he would be recommending a serious clear-out of players to the board. On 9 June 2010, despite concern over his lack of experience, Lennon was officially announced as the new Celtic manager He retained Mj√§llby as his assistant, as well as former Celtic teammate Alan Thompson and former Leicester City teammate Garry Parker as first-team coaches Lennon stated his desire to \\"bring back the thunder\\" to Celtic Park. 2010‚Äì11 Lennon made considerable changes to the Celtic team for the 2010‚Äì11 season. A number of players left the club over the summer, including Aiden McGeady, who was sold for a then Scottish record ¬£9.5 million In turn, a large number of talented, young, cheap, relatively unknown players from England and smaller leagues around the world were signed. Several more experienced players also arrived at this time to strengthen the squad. Gary Hooper, Beram Kayal and Emilio Izaguirre all had excellent seasons and earned many plaudits, with Izaguirre winning both the SPFA and Scottish Football Writers' Player of the Year awards. Goalkeeper Fraser Forster, signed on loan from Newcastle United, on became first choice goalkeeper and helped set a new SPL record for most clean sheets in a season.Emilio Izaguirre was voted SPFA Player of the Year in 2011 Celtic were knocked out of the Champions League and Europa League at the first hurdles, losing to Braga and Utrecht respectively. Celtic and Rangers both won their first eight SPL games,Celtic v Rangers as it happened BBC Sport, 24 October 2010 but when the sides first clashed Celtic lost 3‚Äì1. Celtic played fairly well up until the next Old Firm match, but still went into the New Year fixture at Ibrox as underdogs. However, Celtic won 2‚Äì0 thanks to a Georgios Samaras bracehttp://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/9330644.stm and went onto win 15 out of their 19 matches in the second half of the season. Draws at Hamilton Academical and Ibrox, however, as well as losses at Inverness and Motherwell, saw them lose the league by a point. However, Celtic did have the best defensive record only conceding 22 goals. Celtic got to the final of both domestic cups in 2010‚Äì11. They lost the League Cup final 2‚Äì1 to Rangers but won the Scottish Cup final 3‚Äì0 against Motherwell. Celtic fans show their support for Neil Lennon in 2011 In 2011, Neil Lennon was subject to a terror campaign. In January he, along with two other Northern Irish, Catholic, Celtic players Niall McGinn and Paddy McCourt, were sent packages containing bullets in the post. In March and April two parcel bombs were sent to high-profile fans of Celtic and two bombs were sent to Lennon. Trish Godman MSP and Paul McBride QC, who had represented Celtic in their court cases with the SFA, were both sent bombs through the Royal Mail. All of the devices were addressed to their places of work. The bombs, described by Strathclyde Police as being designed to \\"kill or maim\\", were widely condemned by footballing and political authorities. Scottish Labour leader, Iain Gray, described the act as \\"terrorism\\" and First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond said that, \\"It is time to remember what we value in society, and unite to condemn those who use football as a pretext for their pathetic and dangerous prejudices.\\" Lennon and his family had to receive 24-hour police protection because of the bombs and threats. He also had to receive police protection at matches due to the threats against him. However, this did not stop a man at a match against Hearts at Tynecastle running onto the pitch and attacking him. Lennon was uninjured, and the man was charged with assault and breach of the peace, both aggravated by religious prejudice. 2011‚Äì12 The 2011‚Äì12 season saw Celtic make a poor start to their league campaign. Despite rising concerns about their financial situation, Rangers under new manager Ally McCoist topped the league table for the first few months. Celtic were run ragged by Rangers in the first Old Firm game of the season, a 4‚Äì2 win for the Ibrox club on 18 September 2011. By October 2011, Celtic were 15 points behind Rangers in the league, albeit Rangers had played two more games than Celtic. On 15 October 2011 at Rugby Park, Celtic trailed 0‚Äì3 at half-time to Kilmarnock. Lennon later admitted that had Celtic conceded a further goal he would have resigned. Instead, Celtic rallied in the second half and two goals from Anthony Stokes and a header from Charlie Mulgrew secured an unlikely 3‚Äì3 draw. Celtic began to find form, and by Christmas had closed the gap between themselves and Rangers to one point. This run included a 1‚Äì0 win over Hearts on 10 December 2011 where Victor Wanyama, signed from Belgium club Beerschot for ¬£900,000 in July, scored his first goal for Celtic with a powerful 25-yard shot. In the same match, Hearts were awarded a controversial penalty in the last minute but Fraser Forster saved Eggert Jonsson's penalty kick. A Joe Ledley goal on 28 December 2011 gave Celtic a 1‚Äì0 win over Rangers at Parkhead, and saw them go top of the table two points clear of Rangers. By February 2012, Celtic had increased their lead to four points. The title was then all but secured when Rangers entered into administration on 14 February 2012, with the Ibrox club incurring a ten-point deduction from the Scottish Premier League. Celtic's unbeaten league run continued up to the next Old Firm game on 25 March 2012 when a poor performance exacerbated by several contentious refereeing decisions saw Rangers win 3‚Äì2 and prevent their rivals clinching the league title that day. The title was eventually secured in style a couple of weeks later with an emphatic 6‚Äì0 win over Kilmarnock at Rugby Park, Gary Hooper and Charlie Mulgrew both scoring twice. Celtic's next league fixture saw them comfortably beat Rangers 3‚Äì0 in a party atmosphere at Parkhead in a match more notable for the Celtic fans colourful banners mocking Rangers on-going financial problems rather than events on the pitch. The domestic cup tournaments proved a source of disappointment in the 2011‚Äì12 season. Celtic reached the League Cup final and were strong favourites to win against unfancied Kilmarnock. However, Celtic were uninspiring on the day and a headed goal six minutes from the end by Dieter van Tornhout won the League Cup for the Ayrshire side. In the Scottish Cup, Celtic reached the semi-final and were drawn to play Hearts. Again, Celtic were not at their best and Craig Beattie's stoppage time penalty secured a 2‚Äì1 win for The Jambos. Celtic qualified for the Europa League group stages in 2011‚Äì12 in bizarre circumstances. Swiss side Sion defeated Celtic 3‚Äì1 on aggregate in the qualifying tie, however Sion were thrown out of the tournament by UEFA due to them fielding ineligible players in the two games against Celtic. Celtic were reinstated, eventually finishing third in Group I, behind Atl√©tico Madrid and Udinese and ahead of Rennes. Despite failing to progress from the group stages of the Europa League, Celtic had a respectable campaign and their performances on the European stage are considered to have acted as a catalyst for the improvement in their domestic form as the season progressed. =A new era= 2012‚Äì13 Victor Wanyama - voted the SPL Young Player of the Year in 2013 The summer of 2012 saw extraordinary developments in Scottish football. Rangers, who were being pursued by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for alleged unpaid tax, effectively went into liquidation on 12 June 2012 when HMRC rejected the club's proposed Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). A new company was quickly formed and the club re-constituted. However, despite an at-times hysterical media campaign making references to financial \\"Armageddon\\" for the other clubs in Scotland, the re-formed Rangers were not allowed re-entry to the Scottish Premier League and instead were placed in the lowest tier of the Scottish Football League, the Third Division. Ignoring the ongoing furore surrounding Rangers' financial crisis, Celtic went about their 2012‚Äì13 league campaign in a steady if not always inspiring manner. Motherwell, Inverness Caley Thistle and briefly Hibernian all either had spells at the top of the table, or thereabouts, but by Christmas Celtic had found a steady run of form to pull themselves comfortably clear of the pack. Celtic eventually clinched their 44th League title on 21 April 2013 with a 4‚Äì1 win over Inverness CT at Parkhead. Celtic's run in the League Cup saw them comfortably dispose of Raith Rovers (4‚Äì1) and St Johnstone (5‚Äì0) in the earlier rounds. St Mirren, however, pulled off an unexpected but deserved 3‚Äì2 win over Celtic in the semi-final. In the Scottish Cup, Celtic knocked out Arbroath, Raith Rovers, and St Mirren in the earlier rounds. In the semi-final at Hampden Park, Celtic won a thrilling match by 4‚Äì3 after extra time against Dundee United. Celtic met Hibernian in the Scottish Cup final on 26 May 2013. For the first time in its history, the Cup Final was played on a Sunday. This was done to comply with UEFA regulations which prohibit televised matches being played on the same day as the UEFA Champions League Final. Celtic won the cup and clinched a League and Cup double with a 3‚Äì0 win, Gary Hooper scoring twice in the first half before Joe Ledley added a third late on in the second half. As Scottish Champions from the previous season, Celtic took part in the 2012‚Äì13 Champions League, negotiating two qualifying rounds to qualify for the tournament proper. On 2 October 2012, Celtic achieved their first ever away win in the group stages of the Champions League with a 3‚Äì2 win in Russia over Spartak Moscow, Georgios Samaras scoring the winning goal in the 90th minute. Celtic's home match with Barcelona in November 2012 coincided with the week of Celtic's 125th Anniversary. As such, an Ultras styled section of the Celtic support called the Green Brigade organised a full stadium pre-match card display (a tifo) to celebrate the club's 125th anniversary. The display featured a Celtic cross, green and white hoops and 125 Celtic in written form, with supporters earning the praise of club chairman Peter Lawwell. A memorable night was completed when goals from Victor Wanyama and 18-year-old striker Tony Watt gave Celtic a shock 2‚Äì1 win over Barcelona. Goalkeeper Fraser Forster produced an outstanding performance in the game, winning the praise of the Spanish media who nicknamed him \\"La Gran Muralla\\" (\\"The Great Wall\\"). Celtic secured their progress to the knock- out stages of the Champions League on 5 December 2012 with a 2‚Äì1 home win over Spartak Moscow, Kris Commons scoring the winning goal in 82 minutes with a penalty. Celtic were drawn against Juventus but succumbed to 5‚Äì0 aggregate defeat in the Spring of 2013 to go out of the tournament. Despite the emphatic scoreline over the two legs, Celtic were not outclassed by their Italian opponents in terms of general play but while Juventus defended with a ruthless defiance, Celtic in contrast shipped their goals all far too easily. Despite the result against Juventus, Celtic and Neil Lennon won praise for their Champions League campaign. 2013‚Äì14 Over the summer, Gary Hooper and Kelvin Wilson were sold to Norwich City and Nottingham Forest respectively, while the highly rated Victor Wanyama was sold to Southampton for a Scottish record fee of ¬£12.5 million. Neil Lennon rebuilt his squad by signing Virgil van Dijk and Amido Bald√© in the summer, and Teemu Pukki from Schalke 04 on transfer deadline day. Kris Commons ‚Äì Celtic's top scorer in 2014 and Scottish Player of the Year Celtic again started their season playing in the qualifying rounds of the Champions League, knocking out Northern Irish champions Cliftonville and Swedish side IF Elfsborg to reach the final play-off round. Celtic were drawn with Kazakh champions Shakhter Karagandy and found themselves losing the first leg away in Karagandy 2‚Äì0. Celtic rallied in the return leg at Celtic Park in the home leg, overcoming the 2‚Äì0 deficit to level the aggregate score thanks to goals either side of half-time by Kris Commons and Georgios Samaras. James Forrest completed the comeback for Celtic with a 90th-minute strike, seeing Celtic progress to the Group stages. The campaign from then on was dismal though; winning only once with a 2‚Äì1 home win over Ajax, and slumping to a 6‚Äì1 rout away against Barcelona in the final group match. That game saw Celtic concede the most goals they had ever done in a single European tie, and equalled their previous heaviest defeat in Europe (5-0 against Artmedia Bratislava). The domestic campaign had ups and downs; towards the end of February, Celtic had not lost a single game in the league, and drew just twice against Dundee United and Hibernian. Their league success did not translate to cup competition however; going out of the League Cup (0‚Äì1 to Greenock Morton), and the Scottish Cup(1‚Äì2 to Aberdeen), both at Celtic Park. Celtic also struggled to find a suitable strike partner for Anthony Stokes, forcing Kris Commons into a striking role. Neil Lennon signed former Hibs striker Leigh Griffiths on transfer deadline day in January 2014, as well as Stefan Johansen earlier in the month. After being unable to reach an agreement on a new contract, Joe Ledley left Celtic for Crystal Palace. On 2 February 2014, goalkeeper Fraser Forster set a new a club-record of 11 league clean sheets in a row, surpassing a record of 10 clean sheets set by Charlie Shaw in the 1921‚Äì22 season. On 22 February, he broke Bobby Clark's Scottish League record of 1155 minutes without conceding a goal in a league match. Celtic won 2‚Äì0 away at Hearts, and Forster racked up his 13th consecutive clean sheet in the league. Forster's clean sheet run finally ended on 1,256 minutes against Aberdeen on 25 February 2014, as Aberdeen defeated Celtic 2‚Äì1 to end their unbeaten run in the league. Celtic finished the season as league champions again, their third consecutive Scottish League title, scoring 102 goals in the process. Kris Commons was the top scorer in Scotland, netting 32 goals, and won both the PFA Scotland and Scottish Football Writers' Player of the Year awards. On 22 May 2014, Neil Lennon announced that he was leaving Celtic after four years as manager. \\"I have parted company with Celtic,\\" the 42-year-old Northern Irishman said in a brief statement, adding, \\"The club are in a very strong position and I wish the fans and the club all the very best for the future.\\" Ronny Deila (2014‚Äì2016) Norwegian Ronny Deila was appointed manager of Celtic on 6 June 2014. He signed a 12-month rolling contract with the club, with former Celtic midfielder and Scotland international John Collins appointed as his assistant. =2014‚Äì15= After going unbeaten on a pre-season tour in Austria, Deila's first competitive match as manager of Celtic, a Champions League qualifying tie away against KR Reykjavik on 15 July 2014, ended in a 1‚Äì0 win with midfielder Callum McGregor scoring the decisive goal on 84 minutes. Celtic eased to a 4‚Äì0 win in the return match in Scotland, but were comprehensively beaten and outplayed in the next qualifying round, losing 6‚Äì1 on aggregate to Legia Warsaw. Despite this, Celtic were given a reprieve when it was discovered that Legia had fielded an ineligible player in the second leg, Bartosz Bereszy≈Ñski coming on as a substitute in the last four minutes. UEFA punished the Polish club by awarding the game 3‚Äì0 to Celtic, levelling the aggregate score at 4‚Äì4 and seeing the Scottish champions progress on away goals. Despite this astonishing piece of luck, Celtic failed abjectly to take advantage in the final qualifier against Maribor, losing 2‚Äì1 on aggregate to drop down to the Europa League. Red Bull Salzburg during the group stage of their UEFA Europa League campaign in 2014. Celtic were unconvincing in the early stages of the league as well, but improved as the season progressed and also qualified from their Europa League group. Deila won the Manager of the Month award for November 2014. By February 2015, Celtic had won 15 of their last 17 domestic games and comfortably defeated Rangers 2‚Äì0 in the semi-final of the League Cup. Celtic played Inter Milan in the round of 16 stage of the Europa League, rallying to draw 3‚Äì3 at Parkhead from an early 0‚Äì2 deficit in a pulsating encounter, then losing 1‚Äì0 in Milan to go out on aggregate despite a highly credible performance. In the league, Celtic thrashed second-placed Aberdeen 4‚Äì0 on 1 March to go six points clear with a game in hand and a vastly superior goal difference. It was Celtic's eighth consecutive win in the league, and the turn around in form saw previous critics of Deila review their opinion of him. Former Celtic striker John Hartson had branded Deila as \\"clueless\\" in October, but now stated that Deila has \\"..turned it round to his credit and they‚Äôre playing some brilliant football at the moment\\". Deila celebrating winning the 2015‚Äì16 Scottish Premiership league title in May 2016 In March 2015, Celtic agreed a new kit deal with Boston-based sportswear manufacturer New Balance to replace Nike from the start of the 2015‚Äì16 season. It is believed to be the biggest kit contract in the club's history, outdoing the decade-long deal with Nike who paid Celtic ¬£5 million a year to make their shirts. Deila won his first trophy at Celtic on 15 March; Celtic's defeating Dundee United 2‚Äì0 in the League Cup final. Kris Commons opened the scoring in the first half and James Forrest steered the ball into the net from 20 yards out to double Celtic's lead in the second half. Celtic's bid for a domestic treble ended when they were beaten by Inverness Caledonian Thistle in the semi-final of the Scottish Cup on 19 April 2015. The match however was controversial, with Inverness defender Josh Meekings' deliberate handball of Leigh Griffiths' goal-bound header just before half-time going unpunished by the match officials. Insult was added to injury in the second half when Craig Gordon was sent off (correctly) for fouling Marley Watkins in the penalty box. Greg Tansey converted the resultant penalty to level the tie at 1‚Äì1. Down to ten men, Celtic struggled for the rest of the match and eventually lost 3‚Äì2 after extra-time. Celtic clinched their fourth successive league title in May, with manager Deila commenting \\"We've had a terrific few months - we deserved to win the league.\\" =2015‚Äì16= Celtic began the season again attempting to qualify for the Champions League. They knocked out Stjarnan from Iceland and Qarabaƒü from Azerbaijan in the early qualifying rounds, but lost 4‚Äì3 on aggregate to Swedish side Malm√∂ FF in the final play-off round. This meant for the second successive season, Celtic dropped in to the Europa League. Celtic's Europa League campaign was poor and littered with individual errors which contributed to dropped points in every match. Celtic failed to qualify, finishing bottom of their group, and was the first time Celtic went through a group stage of a European competition without recording a single victory. Deila was criticised for Celtic's poor European campaign, and a series of indifferent performances in the league saw him placed under further scrutiny. In April 2016, Celtic suffered a 5‚Äì4 loss on penalties to Old Firm rivals Rangers in the semi-final of the Scottish Cup, after a 2‚Äì2 extra-time draw in which Celtic fought back against the newly promoted Championship side twice to level the score. Three days later, Deila announced his resignation from his post once Celtic had finished the season. Nevertheless, Deila led Celtic to their fifth consecutive League championship, clinching the title on 8 May with a 3-2 win over nearest challengers Aberdeen. Celtic finished the season a week later with an emphatic 7‚Äì0 win over Motherwell, seeing Deila depart the club on a high note after two years in charge. The seventh goal in that game was scored by debutant Jack Aitchison, who at 16 years and 71 days old became both the youngest player ever to represent the club in a competitive match and the youngest goalscorer. Although Celtic had been generally mediocre, striker Leigh Griffiths had an outstanding season, scoring 40 goals and winning both the PFA Scotland and Scottish Football Writers' Association Player of the Year awards. The season also saw 18 year old Kieran Tierney emerge as one of the most promising prospects in Scottish football, establishing himself as first-choice left-back at Celtic and making his full international debut for Scotland. Brendan Rodgers: Invincibles and trebles Rail seating at Celtic Park On 20 May 2016, it was confirmed that 43-year-old Brendan Rodgers would take over at the club with immediate effect, the Irishman having previously managed Swansea City and Liverpool in the English Premier League. In the days that followed, Chris Davies was named as assistant manager and Glen Driscoll appointed as head of performance.https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/celtic-appoint-glen- driscoll-new-head-performance-1475656 Both men had previously worked with Rodgers at Swansea and Liverpool. Brendan Rodgers led Celtic to two consecutive domestic treblesOn 14 July 2016, Celtic formally unveiled their new 2,600 capacity \\"rail seating\\" area within Celtic Park, becoming the first British club to do so. The club had obtained a \\"safe standing\\" certificate 13 months earlier after years of negotiations with supporters, football authorities and Glasgow City Council. Rail seating is particularly common in Germany's Bundesliga, most notably at Borussia Dortmund's Westfalenstadion, a ground with a reputation on par with Celtic Park for its intensity and atmosphere. =2016‚Äì17= Celtic's first competitive match under Rodgers, saw the team lose 1-0 against Gibraltan minnows Lincoln Red Imps in the first leg of the Second Round Champions League qualifiers, a result described by The Scotsman as a \\"humiliation\\" and mooted by other media as being one of the worst results in the club's history. Celtic quickly found their feet though, winning the second leg 3-0 and going on to eliminate Astana and Hapoel Be'er Sheva in the subsequent qualifying rounds to progress into the Champions League group stages for the first time since 2013. Celtic's new signings Scott Sinclair and Moussa Demb√©l√© also helped the club make a strong start to their league campaign, with Sinclair scoring in each of the first six league matches and Demb√©l√© scoring a hat-trick in Celtic's 5-1 win over newly promoted Rangers, becoming the first Celtic player to score three goals against Rangers since Harry Hood in 1973. Scott Sinclair, one of Brendan Rodger's new signings, scored in each of Celtic's first six league matches of the season, and finished as top goalscorer in the Scottish PremiershipThe team's opening match in the Champions League on 13 September 2016 proved to be a humbling experience though as Barcelona delivered a footballing lesson in a 7-0 rout, the club's heaviest ever European defeat and the second-heaviest in the club's history. A level of pride was restored in the next Champions League tie, Celtic holding Manchester City to a 3-3 draw at Celtic Park and ending the high-spending English club's run of ten consecutive wins, with Demb√©l√© scoring twice. Further draws away at Borussia M√∂nchengladbach and in the return match at Manchester City saw Celtic finish the group on three points, albeit coming fourth and going out of Europe. Celtic continued their unbeaten run in domestic competitions into the New Year, during which time the club won their 100th major trophy, defeating Aberdeen 3‚Äì0 in the League Cup Final on 27 November 2016. Celtic's 5-2 win away at St Johnstone on 5 February 2017 saw them extend their lead in the league to 27 points over second-placed Aberdeen, and was their 19th consecutive league win, with the only points dropped in the season so far being in a 2-2 draw away at Inverness in September. They continued undefeated through March, going to extend their winning run to 22 consecutive league games, although dropped points in a 1-1 draw at Parkhead against Rangers. Celtic clinched their sixth successive league title on 2 April 2017, with a record eight league games to spare. As Celtic's unbeaten domestic run continued, they subjected Rangers to their heaviest defeat at Ibrox since 1915, thrashing their rivals 5-1 on 29 April. Celtic's 2-0 win over Hearts on 21 May saw them finish 30 points ahead of second-placed Aberdeen in the league, win a record 106 points, and the team become the first Scottish side to complete a top-flight season undefeated since 1899. On 27 May 2017, Celtic clinched their fourth treble by defeating Aberdeen 2‚Äì1 in the Scottish Cup final, with Tom Rogic scoring the winning goal in injury time. The cup final win saw Celtic go through the entire domestic season unbeaten. =2017‚Äì18= Celtic entered the 2017‚Äì18 UEFA Champions League at the 2nd qualifying round, they defeated Linfield 6‚Äì0, Rosenborg 1‚Äì0 and Astana 8‚Äì4 on aggregate to enter the group stages. Celtic achieved only 3 points over the six games, but did win 3‚Äì0 away at Anderlecht, their first group stages (Champions League and Europa League) win in 16 games. Celtic finished the group in third place despite losing 5‚Äì0 (at home) and 7‚Äì1 (away) to Paris Saint Germain. On 26 November 2017, Celtic won their fourth consecutive domestic trophy, for the first time since Jock Stein's side in 1970, with a 2‚Äì0 win against Motherwell in the Scottish League Cup final. Celtic set the British record for consecutive unbeaten domestic games at 69, beating their own record of 62 set by Willie Maley's side in 1917, before finally losing 4‚Äì0 to Hearts. Over 585 days, Celtic won 60 of those 69 games, drawing the other 9, with 197 goals scored and 38 clean sheets in the process. Brendan Rodgers said of his Celtic team after the loss to Hearts, that \\"They've set a record that may well never be beaten\\". By finishing third in the Champions League group stages, Celtic qualified for the knockout round of 32 in the Europa League where they were drawn against Zenit Saint Petersburg. Celtic won the first leg 1‚Äì0 after a late winner by Callum McGregor, but succumbed to a disappointing 3‚Äì0 defeat in Saint Petersburg and were subsequently knocked out of the competition. On 29 April 2018, Celtic secured their seventh consecutive league title with a 5‚Äì0 win over Rangers at Celtic Park. This win also extended Celtic's unbeaten run over Rangers to 12 games. Celtic's season ended on 19 May 2018 when they secured the first ever 'Double-Treble' (a treble in two consecutive seasons) in Scottish football history with a 2‚Äì0 Scottish Cup Final win over Motherwell. =2018‚Äì19= Into his third season, Rodgers led Celtic to another League Cup, defeating Aberdeen in the final, and by February 2019 the club were eight points clear in the league. However, on 26 February 2019 Rodgers left Celtic in a surprise move to take over as manager of Leicester City. Return of Neil Lennon =2018‚Äì19= Neil Lennon returned to Celtic to work as caretaker manager until the end of the season. He went on to help Celtic complete their eighth successive league title, and then to a 2‚Äì1 win over Hearts in the 2019 Scottish Cup Final to clinch the treble for the third season in a row (the \\"treble treble\\"). The following week, Lennon was confirmed as full-time manager for the second time. =2019‚Äì20= Into the first full season of his second spell as manager, Neil Lennon led Celtic to a 1‚Äì0 win over Rangers in the 2019 Scottish League Cup Final, the club's tenth consecutive domestic trophy. By March 2020, Celtic were 13 points clear in the league and well on the way to a ninth consecutive title: However, all professional football in Scotland was suspended later that month due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, with media demands made for the league season to be declared \\"null and void\\". On 18 May, the SPFL officially ended the season, and Celtic were awarded their ninth consecutive league title.https://spfl.co.uk/news/ladbrokes-premiership-and-spfl-season-201920-cur See also *History of Celtic F.C.

It was designed by Richard Gailey and built from 1888 to 1889 by George Gazzard. It is also known as Hill's Buildings. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former Queensland Country Life Building was constructed in 1888-89 as a speculative venture for influential Queensland pastoralists, politicians, company directors and businessmen, Charles Lumley Hill and John Stevenson. Known originally as Hill's Buildings, this group of four warehouses was sited opposite the Customs House and close to the municipal wharves at Petrie Bight, and was designed to attract shipping companies, merchants, warehousemen, bond storekeepers, insurance companies and others as tenants. Together with the Customs House, the building was constructed during a building boom which saw a number of notable public and commercial buildings erected in Brisbane during the 1880s. The present Customs House was constructed between 1886 and 1889, replacing a smaller building erected in 1850. The site for the Customs House was chosen in 1849 after considerable discussion as to the most suitable location. At the time, shipping activity was centred on the South Brisbane Reach, and the decision to locate the Customs House at the northern end of the Town Reach acted as an impetus for the development of wharves on this part of the river, and warehouses in the immediate vicinity. The earlier building became increasingly inadequate as Brisbane developed as the major port in the colony, and in 1884 the Queensland Government decided to construct a new Customs House. The growing importance of this part of the city is further reflected in the construction of the Eagle Street Fountain (also known as the Mooney Memorial Fountain) between 1878 and 1880 as part of measures to enhance the visual character of the area. The warehouses were constructed as a four- storeyed masonry building divided into four bays, with individual entrances, and were erected in two consecutive stages. Part of the site was transferred to Hill in August 1881, part also to Hill in January 1888, and the remainder to Stevenson in October 1888. In January 1888, established Brisbane architect Richard Gailey, acting for Charles Lumley Hill, invited expressions of interest from prospective tenants in new business premises to be erected opposite the Customs House, with a frontage of to Queen Street. He indicated that no expense was to be spared in either design or utility. In March 1888, Gailey called tenders, again on Lumley Hill's behalf, for the construction of two warehouses at Petrie Bight. A contract for the two warehouses was let in April to George Gazzard, who tendered with a price of . Gailey and Gazzard had collaborated on a number of major Brisbane projects in the 1880s, including the Regatta Hotel (1886), Treasury Chambers (1886‚Äì87), and Brisbane Girls Grammar School. In July 1888, Gailey called tenders for the construction of another two warehouses at Petrie's Bight, and the successful tenderer was again George Gazzard, with a price of . The warehouses were completed toward the end of the boom decade, and proved slow to let. One of the first tenants was Taylor, Enoch & Co., wholesale boot importers, who occupied the northern warehouse . The other three warehouses were listed as vacant in the 1891 Brisbane Post Office Directory, but RL Armour, warehousemen and importers of general drapery and fancy goods, had moved to the building by 1892. WJ Weatherill, consular agent for the United States of America, importer, and manager of the Queensland Post Office Directory, occupied offices in Hill's Buildings during the second half of the 1890s. The shipping line William Howard Smith and Sons later occupied offices in the building. Edward Butler and Sons (initially Edward Butler & Frederick Rathbone), importers of wholesale saddlery, leased part of the building from January 1899 until 1948, when Edward Butler & Co purchased the warehouse they were leasing. In 1905, Stevenson's part of the property passed to the Australian Mutual Provident Society, as mortgagee. Lumley Hill died in 1909, and his widow sold her interest in this property in 1911. There followed a variety of owners and lessees of the four warehouses, but the two most closely associated with the building in the second half of the 19th century were the United Graziers' Association and the Queensland Country Life newspaper. In late 1955, Queensland Country Life announced that it was moving to ground floor premises in the United Graziers' Association building at 432 Queen Street. In 1964 the trustees of the United Graziers' Association of Queensland, Union of Employers, purchased part of the site, and in 1977 this was transferred to Queensland Country Life Newspaper Pty Ltd. In 1973 the northern warehouse was sold and subsequently demolished for the construction of an adjoining highrise. The existing facade was retained when the remainder of the building was demolished in 1991. The facade stood with minimal support on an empty site for many years until it was incorporated into the development of the Aurora Tower, then the tallest residential tower in Brisbane, built between 2003-2006.  Description  Part of the \\"Queensland Country Life\\" signage remains on the side of the building, 2015 The existing main facade comprises three identical bays. The northern matching bay and the remainder of the building have been demolished. The facade is lavishly decorated with Victorian Italianate detail executed in rendered brickwork, on the upper three of its four storeys. The three remaining bays are identical in elevation. At street level all the original detailing has been removed, except for the large curved pediments above each entry. The first and second floors are linked by giant order Corinthian pilasters which support a highly moulded frieze and cornice. The central pilasters of each bay have a pediment, which rises above the cornice. On the top floor the line of the large lower pilasters is continued by smaller paired pilasters. The bays of the building at parapet level are divided by pedestals supporting urns. Each bay has a central semi-circular pediment containing the date A.D. 1888 in raised lettering, and is topped by a small finial which completes a striking silhouette.  Heritage listing  The Queensland Country Life Building facade was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The facade of the former Queensland Country Life Building dates from 1888‚Äì89, and together with the Customs House opposite, is one of the few structures which provide evidence of the official entrance to the former Port of Brisbane. As a remnant of a commercial warehouse, the facade provides important evidence of the development of the Town Reach area as an important commercial warehousing district. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It survives as an example of the work of architect Richard Gailey, whose firm was responsible for many of the ornamental boom-era commercial buildings of the 1880s, which defined Brisbane's image as a late-Victorian city until well into the middle of the 20th century. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The facade makes a strong contribution to the streetscape as an important element near the intersection of Queen and Wharf Street, and as a complement in scale and style to the Customs House opposite.

He is particularly known for extremely minimalist, understated garments following the American sportswear principle, in neutral colors (occasionally red, purple or blue) and high quality natural fabrics such as silk, linen and cashmere wool. His clothes have been described as \\"Gap for the very rich\\", and as \\"revolutionary\\" due to being designed without \\"built-in obsolescence\\". Early life Born in the Banat in 1947, Zoran trained as an architect before migrating to the United States in 1972 where he worked in clothing retail and as an accessory designer for Scott Barrie before launching his label. In 1983, Zoran stated that he considered himself an American. Fashion Zoran's first collection, produced in 1976, offered five simple, one-size-fits-all designs made in white or black crepe- de-chine; all he could afford at the time. This collection, named \\"Five Easy Pieces\\", was sold through Henri Bendel, where it sold out quickly, leading to increasingly larger orders. In 1982 Zoran offered some of his garments in cotton knit for summer, which enabled a wider range of customers to afford them, and also produced velour resort wear which could be worn both on the beach and for formal occasions. Zoran received his first Coty Award nomination in 1980, but did not win until 1982, when he was awarded a Special Award for menswear separates. He was also shortlisted for the Coty in 1983, but declined his nomination. By 1983 Zoran's name had become a byword for clothing that reflected his minimalist purity of line. He was based in Greenwich Village, rather than in the Seventh Avenue, the focus of New York's garment industry. Also in 1983, with the exception of Barneys, Zoran pulled his clothes from sale through the major American stores, and opened his first shop in Washington D.C.. Whilst also selling clothes through the London boutique Browns, he also chose to focus on private clients such as Queen Noor of Jordan, Isabella Rossellini and Lauren Hutton. By 1999, he was again selling through department stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue. In 1993, Zoran described his approach to fashion as \\"simplicity in fabric and way of cut. You cannot produce complicated clothes or spend 10 days making a dress. Mine is all done by scaling measurements. I use the body as the land, as when building a house.\\" Suzy Menkes described his work at the time as based on loose and easy fits, playing only with proportion, color and texture, such as lining chiffon with lam√©, or pairing velvet with alpaca. Although his clothes were extremely expensive and the designer refused to allow them to be reduced in price, they consistently sold well. In 1999, The New York Times noted that wholesale revenues of Zoran were probably around the $25 million mark; with profit margins equivalent to those of Armani. Philip B. Miller, the then chairman of Saks, declared that Zoran was ranked \\"at the very top\\". While regularly referred to as \\"reclusive and recalcitrant\\", and as someone maintaining a \\"low profile\\", Zoran is noted for his strong opinions. In 1983 he declared that the only jewelry a woman should wear with his clothing should be her children or her husband. In the same interview, when asked what designers he admired, alongside Coco Chanel, he declared Chairman Mao Zedong's wife, Jiang Qing \\"the ultimate designer, the designer of the century\\", for having helped create the uniform worn by a billion Chinese. In 1993, he told Menkes, \\"Clothes should never touch the body,\\" declaring that only prostitutes wore tight clothing. Zoran's clients have recalled being advised not to wear make-up or painted toenails with his clothing, with Gloria Vanderbilt describing how when the designer saw her wearing an Armani suit at a book reading, he promptly covered her outfit with one of his own chiffon stoles. Zoran relied on the loyalty of his customer base and the high quality of his deliberately logo-free clothing for his success, notably avoiding publicity, advertising, and licensing deals for his name. He rarely held fashion shows. In the early 2000s he withdrew from traditional retail and as of 2014, is believed to currently work on a private basis for individual clients.

Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Rogers Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. For a portion of its length, Rogers Creek is in a broad valley with glacial deposits lying underneath it. Further downstream, the creek flows through a narrow bedrock gorge with several waterfalls. During pre-glacial times, Rogers Creek likely flowed through a saddle to the north of the gorge through which it currently flows. The saddle is now filled with glacial deposits and the road from Harveyville to Muhlenburg runs through its former location. The surficial geology along Rogers Creek mainly consists of alluvium and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. In most of the rest of the creek's watershed, the surficial geology features a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till. Wisconsinan Outwash also occurs near the creek's headwaters. There is a patch of wetland in the watershed. Watershed The watershed of Rogers Creek has an area of . The creek is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Shickshinny. History Rogers Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1185391. The creek is also known as Marsh Creek. This name appears on county highway maps published by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. The first gristmill in Huntington Township was constructed at the mouth of Rogers Creek in 1788 by a Mr. Hopkins. Hopkins also constructed a sawmill at the same location. Nathan Beach constructed the Rogers Mill on the creek in 1798. In the early 1900s, the Commissioners of Luzerne County requested permission to construct a bridge over the creek two miles east of Harveyville.

The start and end of this STEM pipeline are disputed, but it is often considered to begin in early education and extend into graduation or an adult career in STEM.  Description  The \\"pipeline\\" metaphor is based on the idea that having sufficient graduates requires both having sufficient input of students at the beginning of their studies, and retaining these students through completion of their academic program. The STEM pipeline is a key component of workplace diversity and of workforce development that ensures sufficient qualified candidates are available to fill scientific and technical positions. The STEM pipeline was promoted in the United States from the 1970s onwards, as ‚Äúthe push for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education appears to have grown from a concern for the low number of future professionals to fill STEM jobs and careers and economic and educational competitiveness.‚Äù Today, this metaphor is commonly used to describe retention problems in STEM fields, called ‚Äúleaks‚Äù in the pipeline. For example, the White House reported in 2012 that 80% of minority groups and women who enroll in a STEM field switch to a non-STEM field or drop out during their undergraduate education. These leaks often vary by field, gender, ethnic and racial identity, socioeconomic background, and other factors, drawing attention to structural inequities involved in STEM education and careers. Current efforts The STEM pipeline concept is a useful tool for programs aiming at increasing the total number of graduates, and is especially important in efforts to increase the number of underrepresented minorities and women in STEM fields. Using STEM methodology, educational policymakers can examine the quantity and retention of students at all stages of the K-12 educational process and beyond, and devise programs and interventions to improve educational processes and outcomes. STEM programs focus on increasing social and academic supports for students. STEM programs may also focus on bringing students together with professionals in their field, to provide mentoring, role models and learning opportunities in industry. Maintaining a healthy and diverse STEM pipeline has been a concern in several developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany. =United States= In the United States, although efforts to increase the number of women and African Americans in STEM fields have been ongoing, as recently as 2010 the results have been evaluated as \\"poor\\". In 2014, one report declared that \\"traditionally underrepresented groups remain underrepresented\\", while another article commented, \\"You can go through your entire scholarly trajectory in computer science without seeing one face of color\\", where \\"of color\\" refers to African Americans. STEM pipeline programs in the US have been created at various levels. Examples include: the Technology Leadership Institute at the University of Pittsburgh at the college and university level, the Nevada STEM pipeline at the state level and the Broadening Participation in Computing Alliances at the national level.  Educational attainment factors  High Schools in the United States implement a STEM pipeline program that combines a dual pathway that enhances mathematical, engineering, and scientific skills along with a supportive group that aims to help underrepresented students aspire to become leaders in the STEM field. Students benefit from the moral support and motivational skills that mentors implement for their correct academic preparation. Teachers, and college mentors become in the life of the students in the program a guidance in their path to be the next generation of leaders. Furthermore, staff members aid students to feel integrated and cared for their well-being. In their path to pursue higher education in the STEM fields, underrepresented students are awarded scholarships that aid them throughout their college years. Scholarships are a factor that allows underrepresented to focus on their academic and allows them to be persistent throughout their years in college. The STEM pipeline program provides a multitude of workshops, and extracurricular activities to work on social and professional development. Moreover, it arranges networking with minorities that went through the program and now currently work in the science, or health field. In addition, to the benefits as an alumnus of the program, every student is invited to become advocates within their community with the goal of increasing the amount of underrepresented students in STEM fields The support of programs such as the STEM pipeline program aims to increase diversity in the workplace with the ambition to create an inclusive safe area where all the members of the team can contribute to the development of innovative ideas in their respective field. Additionally, the diversity of collaborating with different ideas enhances the outcome of the team's desired goal, and facilitates better planning of the timeline. Public reactions The concept of the STEM pipeline has been met with resistance for its pragmatic overtones. National Science Board Vice Chairman Kelvin Droegemeier calls for a movement away from thinking about the necessary number of STEM workers, in favor of considering the necessary knowledge and skills for the success of all workers. The linearity of the STEM pipeline concept has been criticized as neglecting the wide variety of possible career pathways, including interdisciplinary studies, intermittent careers, and STEM-informed work in non-technical fields. A 2015 commentary in Inside Higher Ed suggested that the \\"leaky pipeline\\" metaphor may be viewed as pejorative towards individuals who leave the academic track for employment, or use their technical background as the basis for a career in a non-technical field. A 2015 commentary in Science observed that Margaret Thatcher and Angela Merkel could be considered two \\"leaks\\" in the pipeline. Some have said that increasing the STEM pipeline is not enough to promote workplace diversity. Advocates for women and minorities in STEM such as Tracy Chou have argued that STEM companies must also focus on internal reforms, such as reevaluating inequitable hiring practices and unsupportive workplace culture.

Mart√≠nez-Pati√±o was dismissed after a competition that would have set her up for participation at the 1988 Summer Olympics. She was shamed publicly when she participated in a hurdles event in the Spanish national championships in 1986, but fought the loss of her IAAF license successfully and was able to compete for participation in the 1992 Olympics. Since then she has written about her experience, and her test and its fallout has become a highly publicized and frequently cited case concerning sex testing as well as the privacy of athletes. Athletic career Mart√≠nez-Pati√±o participated in the 100 metres hurdles, where her best time is 13.71 (Madrid 1983). Her best performance in international competition was 13.78, at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics in Helsinki. =Gender testing= Mart√≠nez-Pati√±o is a 46,XY woman who has androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). She passed a gender test in 1983 at the IAAF World Championships, and received her \\"certificate of femininity\\". However, she failed the sex chromatin test in 1985, and thus was ruled ineligible to participate in women's athletics. The test was taken during the 1985 World University Games in Kobe, Japan, as a result of her having forgotten to bring the result from a test two years before, which she passed. The sex chromatin test was, at the time, the first step in the gender verification process, and not intended to provide a definitive and final decision, but officials from the International Olympic Committee and the International Association of Athletics Federations routinely advised athletes to fake an injury after such a test so they could withdraw from competition quietly and protect their privacy. This is what Mart√≠nez- Pati√±o was advised to do, and she complied. Two months later she received a letter that classified her as male, citing her karyotype, 46,XY, though any perceived advantage she could be said to have is negated by her AIS: \\"she was disqualified for an advantage that she did not have\\". In 1986, she entered the 60 metres hurdles event in the Spanish national championships but was told that she could either withdraw quietly or be denounced in public. She competed and won, and was punished in the Spanish press. She lost her scholarship and her athletic residency, besides paying a high personal price by losing her privacy and her fianc√©. She continued to fight her expulsion: in 1988 she was defended by the genetic scientist Albert de la Chapelle; and her IAAF license was restored three months later. She tried to qualify for the 1992 Olympics, but fell short by one-tenth of a second. Published works Mart√≠nez-Pati√±o described her experience in \\"Personal Account: A woman Tried and Tested\\", published by The Lancet in 2005. In \\"Reexamining Rationales of 'Fairness': An Athlete and Insider's Perspective on the New Policies on Hyperandrogenism in Elite Female Athletes\\" published by the American Journal of Bioethics in 2012, Mart√≠nez-Pati√±o and co-author Hida Viloria discussed current sex testing practices in sport.

Vulture Mine Vulture Mine was a gold mine which was discovered in 1863. It was the most productive gold mine in the history of Arizona. From 1863 to 1942, the mine produced 340,000 ounces of gold and 260,000 ounces of silver.Jon E. Spencer and others, 1989, \\"Geology of the Vulture gold mine,\\" Arizona Geology, v.19 n.4. The Vulture mine was discovered when Henry Wickenburg, a prospector from California's gold rush, stumbled upon a quartz deposit containing gold while traveling in Arizona. Wickenburg began mining the outcrop himself. In 1863, after Henry Wickenburg discovered the Vulture mine, Vulture City, a small mining town, was established in the area. Vulture City's post office was established on October 4, 1880, and Henry Wickenburg was the town's first Post Master. The town had more than five boarding houses and several buildings. The huge Vulture Mine- Assay Office building, built in 1884, still stands today. The town also had cookhouse and mess hall plus stores, saloons and even a school.Vulture Mine The town once had a population of 5,000 citizens. The town was marked by violence. Eighteen men were hanged on an ironwood tree located by the ruins of Henry Wickenburg's house.Vulture City - Ghost Town Abandoned Vulture City After the mine closed, the city was abandoned and its buildings decayed, becoming a \\"ghost town\\". The deposit was later sold to Benjamin Phelps, who represented a group of investors that eventually organized under the name of Vulture Mining Company. The mine continued to produce at a decreased level until World War II, when it was permanently closed. The buildings and the Vulture Mine are privately owned. The owner offers a two-hour, dirt path guided walking tour at the historic Vulture mine, The tour offers a glimpse of the olden days through a tour of some of the remaining buildings of Vulture City, the once booming mining town.

Biography She was born into an anarchist family; her siblings Acracio, Juan and Luis would also be active within the anarchist movement. She was noted for her participation in Mujeres Libres, a libertarian women's organization, which she joined in 1936, and its periodical. Characterized as a \\"reactionary\\", she served as the organization's national vice-secretary. She was also active in Libertarian Youth and Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo. Portales was one of the interviewees in Vivir la utop√≠a. She became an exile in the UK in 1939. In November 1964, she began editing the journal Mujeres Libres from London. When the Spanish Revolution and Civil War broke out she moved to Guadalajara, where she helped advise peasants. She was devoted to improving literacy among peasants and helped found Mujeres Libres groups in Guadalajara, Horche, Y√©lamos de Arriba, Y√©lamos de Abajo, Tendilla, Mazuecos, and Mond√©jar. When the war was over she fled to the port of Alicante where with 183 others she managed to board the Galatea bound for Britain. In London she was sheltered at the house of Peggy Spenser for some time. While in London Portales continued to stay connected and participate in activities of the Spanish anarchist movement and kept in touch with the underground resistance back home, where her brother Juan was in jail. She continued to write for Spanish libertarian publications and participate in every demonstration against the Francoist regime, including those to protest the visits of Francoist ministers to London, Fernando Mar√≠a Castiella in July 1960 and Manuel Fraga Iribarne in November 1963. In 1961 Portales represented the London group of exiles at the Congress of the CNT in Limoges in France. Shortly after she contacted more Spanish libertarian exiles in France and helped refound the Mujeres Libres magazine. She launched a special edition of this entitled Mujeres Libres in Exile. She also contributed to other libertarian publications like Espoir in Toulouse and Frente Libertario in Paris. In 1972 she moved to Montady, near B√©ziers, in France, where she contributed to Mujeres Libres magazine up until 1976. Shortly after she returned to Spain and began to re-organise the CNT in Guadalajara along with Saturnino Mauricio and others. She took part and spoke at the massive rally of the CNT in San Sebastian de Los Reyes near Madrid in March 1977. In the 1980s she moved to Novelda in Alicante province and took part in the reconstruction of the Mujeres Libres organisation, though she had certain reservations about the latter orientation of the organization. The last public event she attended was a 60th Anniversary celebration of the founding of Mujeres Libres. Finally she moved to Seville, where he died, at age of 94 on 23 January 1999.

It is a medium to large leafy tree, growing in wet areas such as on the edges of coastal lagoons. It has papery bark, relatively large, blue-green leaves and spikes of cream-coloured flowers over a long period. Description Melaleuca dealbata is a relatively slow- growing tree to with blue-grey foliage, hairy, pendulous branchlets and papery, layered bark. The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are elliptic to oval in shape, long, wide and have five to seven prominent longitudinal veins. Young shoots and twigs are densely clothed in erect, white or silver hairs. The small, creamy-white flowers are loosely arranged in 7 to 28 groups of three on spikes up to long and wide. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower with 5 to 8 stamens per bundle. Flowering occurs from May to December but mainly in spring, and the fruit that follows are cup or barrel-shaped woody capsules, wide and long. When the fruit matures, the fine, sawdust-like seeds are released. The paperbark trunk of M. dealbata. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca dealbata was first formally described in 1968 by S.T. Blake in Contributions from the Queensland Herbarium. The specific epithet (dealbata) is from the Latin dealbatus, meaning \\"covered with a white powder\\". There are a large number of common names for this plant, including karnbor, swamp tea-tree, soapy tea-tree, blue- leaved paperbark, blue paperbark, honey tree and cloudy tea-tree. Distribution and habitat Karnbor occurs in southern Papua New Guinea, Irian Jaya, Indonesia and northern Australia from north of Maryborough in Queensland through north Queensland to the Top End of the Northern Territory and into the Broome-Derby area and Weaber Range in the east Kimberley region of Western Australia. It grows in warm to hot, humid, frost-free zones where the mean annual rainfall is mainly in summer. It is found in swampy areas near the coast and inland, mostly on wet sites along stream banks, on seasonally swampy ground and on the edges of lagoons with a range of soil types from sand to clay. Ecology The nectar-rich flowers of this tree attract parrots, honeyeaters, flying foxes and possums. Uses The timber from Melaleuca dealbata is moderately heavy and very strong suggesting its potential use for posts and poles. The tree is very decorative and useful for shelterbelts and soil stabilisation and has been used for the restoration of bauxite mining sites in northern Australia. It is an excellent source of nectar for honey production. The species has been tested for its oil components and found to produce an essential oil in low yield, including predominantly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes with variation between individual plants.

Hurtubise's earliest work appeared in his first attempt at a comics magazine was L'Hydroc√©phale Illustr√© in November 1971, in collaboration with Gilles Desjardins and Fran√ßoise Barrette. It was not a success. Following it, he founded a group of young Canadian artists called the Coop√©rative des Petits Dessins. Throughout the 1970s he produced over 200 comic strips for the newspaper Le Jour. In these strips appeared the characters le Sombre Vilain and his sidekick Bill, the gluttonous boa constrictor who loved to eat pizza delivery men. These adventures continued in the humorous magazine Croc, which he founded in 1979 with H√©l√®ne Fleury and Roch C√¥t√©. Hurtubise is one of only two Qu√©b√©cois cartoonists, with Albert Chartier, to appear in Le Dictionnaire mondial de la Bande Dessin√©e and The World Encyclopedia of Comics.

The Badger Game had its world premiere at the 2014 Arizona Underground Film Festival and had its international premiere at the Twisted Celluloid Film Festival in Cork, Ireland. The film was released on digital VOD by Stadium Media in June 2015, and on Blu-ray and DVD by Intervision Picture Corp in November 2015.  Premise  Alex (Augie Duke) and Jane (Sasha Higgins) are the bitter mistresses of Liam (Sam Boxleitner), a married man with money to burn and a healthy appetite for infidelity. Together, they hatch a plan to kidnap their cheating boyfriend and extort him for millions. To execute the caper, Alex enlists the help of Kip (Patrick Cronen), her unhinged brother, and Shelly (Jillian Leigh), her childhood friend. Sensing Shelly's financial desperation, Alex convinces her to bait Liam into a compromising position, at which point Kip will subdue him long enough to extort a healthy ransom. Donning rubber animal masks, the captors tie-up Liam and confine him to a locked garage. There, they show him a series of incriminating photos and threaten to tell his wife, unless he buys their silence. Liam proves to be less-than-cooperative, and in the long night ahead, the four would-be schemers are forced to reconcile impossible odds, and test the limits of their own morality.

History = Operations of the main faction = Mortar teams of the Fastaqim Union in 2015. The Fastaqim Union takes its name from a Quranic verse, and was founded as an \\"Islamist umbrella movement\\" of pro-Free Syrian Army factions in December 2012.Aron Lund The Mujahideen Army of Aleppo, Carnegie Middle East Centre, April 08, 2014 Its first overall commander was Sheikh Tawfiq Shahabuddin who headed the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement which was one of the Fastaqim Union's member groups at the time. Later on, Peace Brigade commander Mustafa Berro (\\"Saqr Abu Quteiba\\") became the Fastaqim Union's overall leader. Berro was described by one analyst in 2014 as \\"a young FSA-linked fighter\\". Analyst Nicholas A. Heras described Berro as moderate Islamist who regarded his uprising as being motivated by \\"secular idealism\\" yet also as part of a \\"jihad against the al-Assad government\\". By early 2014, the Fastaqim Union controlled territory in Aleppo city and the Aleppo countryside. It was one of the most important rebel groups involved in the Battle of Aleppo (2012‚Äì16), and served as a leading faction within several operations rooms and alliances such as the Levant Front. In January 2014, it joined the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement and other rebel factions in the Aleppo-based Army of Mujahideen coalition. The group and the overall Army of Mujahideen caused controversy in March 2014 when other opposition groups criticised it for stopping Marcell Shehwaro, a Christian anti-government activist in Aleppo, and demanding that she wear a hijab. Shehwaro refused to do so, and was detained and forced by the fighters to sign an agreement pledging to wear a hijab from then on. A Fastaqim and Mujahideen commander released a statement which apologised and claimed that the arrest was a mistake by local commanders. However, he still demanded that Shehwaro wear a hijab. On 26 April 2015, along with other major Aleppo based groups, they established the Fatah Halab joint operations room. = Collapse and remnant groups = On 2 November 2016, during the Aleppo offensive, Fastaqim Union fighters captured a military commander of the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement. In response, al-Zenki fighters attacked the Fastaqim Union's headquarters in the Salaheddine District and al-Ansari district of Aleppo. At least one rebel were killed and more than 25 wounded on both sides in the raid. The next day, the Levant Front and the Abu Amara Brigades began to patrol the streets to arrest any rebels taking part in the clashes. At least 18 rebels were killed in the infighting. The group was mostly dissolved when the Nour al-Din al- Zenki Movement and the Abu Amara Brigades eventually captured all positions of the Fastaqim Union in eastern Aleppo in November 2016. Dozens of rebels from the latter group surrendered and were either captured, joined Abu Amara Brigades' parent group Ahrar al-Sham, or deserted. Some remnants of the Union remained active, but they were considered very weak. As the rebel-held parts of Aleppo were finally conquered by the Syrian Army in December 2016, the loyalist remnants of the Fastaqim Union were among the rebels that were evacuated from Aleppo to Idlib Governorate. On 25 January 2017, the remaining members of the union's Aleppo branch joined Ahrar al-Sham. Former Fastaqim Union spokesman Ammar Sakkar explained that this move had become \\"a necessity\\", as the rebel factions had to unite in face of recent government gains, most notably the fall of rebel-held Aleppo. According to him \\"division has become illogical and would neither build a state nor establish a system of governance, which is an objective of the Syrian revolution\\". Despite the January 2017 merger of the remaining members of Fastaqim Union with Ahrar al- Sham, some members of the group remained independent. Lord Fourati, the former office director of the Fastaqim Union, called his group pledging allegiance to Ahrar al-Sham \\"shameful and illogical\\". On 11 May 2017, a former military commander of Fastaqim Union, Abu Hasanayn, was requested to a meeting in Idlib after coming from al-Bab. Once in Idlib, he was arrested by Ahrar al-Sham. The latter then demanded the remaining holdouts of the Fastaqim Union to surrender their weapons, leading to a clash. Less than an hour later, the Fastaqim headquarter was captured by Ahrar al-Sham. The incident was described as the \\"final nail in the coffin\\" for the group. Ammar Sakkar, the group's former spokesperson, was also arrested by Ahrar al-Sham. Despite this, a Fastaqim Union remnant group under the command of Abu Abdo al-Zir was still active in the northern Aleppo countryside by November 2017, and under Hisham Eskif, it took part in the Turkish military operation in Afrin in early 2018.  Organization  Mustafa Berro (\\"Saqr Abu Quteiba\\"), commander of the Fastaqim Union, in 2015. Before it mostly collapsed in 2016, the Fastaqim Union was a umbrella organization for several militias, most of them operating on a \\"neighborhood level\\". It had around 1,500-3,000 fighters by 2015 and was supported by the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, Turkey, and Qatar. The Fastaqim Union attempted to improve the fighting quality of its member groups through training by defected Syrian officers. As part of the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army, the Fastaqim Union and its former member group the Peace Brigade are nominally organized as part of the 344th Brigade of the 34th Division of the SNA's 3rd Legion, alongside the 23rd Division.

Oftentimes these cultural artifacts have been underwater for a great length of time. Without conservation, most artifacts would perish and important historical data would be lost.Hamilton, D. (1996). Introduction and Overview of Conservation in Archeology. In Basic methods of conserving underwater archaeological material culture (pp. 1‚Äì7). Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Defense, Legacy Resource Management Program. In archaeological terms, it is usually the responsibility of an archaeologist and conservator to ensure that material recovered from a shipwreck is properly cared for. The conservation phase is often time-consuming and expensive (sometimes costing more than the original excavation), which is one of the most important considerations when planning and implementing any action involving the recovery of artifacts from a shipwreck. Background Artifacts recovered from a saltwater environment are saturated with salt that must be removed when the artifacts are recovered.Hamilton, D. (1996). Basic Conservation Procedure. In Basic Methods of Conserving Underwater Archaeological Material Culture (pp. 8‚Äì11). Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Defense, Legacy Resource Management Program. Although they are often naturally preserved, they are also fragile and friable. Once these artifacts are exposed to air and light they will degrade rapidly,Martin, C. (n.d.). An Introduction to Marine Archaeology. Retrieved from: http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/archaeology/marine_01.shtml#four a concern which highlights the importance of timely conservation efforts. Organic material, such as wood, leather, and textiles, can deteriorate and crumble in a matter of hours if allowed to dry without appropriate treatment. Other materials, such as bone, glass, and pottery, if not conserved, will slowly devitrify and in extreme cases will degenerate into a pile of slivers. =Basic conservation of shipwreck artifacts by material type= Bone and ivory \\\\---- Approximately 70% of bone and ivory is made up of an inorganic lattice composed of calcium phosphate and various carbonates and fluorides, and at least 30% is ossein, which is organic. It's difficult to distinguish them unless examined microscopically.Hamilton, D. (1996). Bone, Ivory, Teeth and Antler. In Basic Methods of Conserving Underwater Archaeological Material Culture (pp. 16‚Äì18). Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Defense, Legacy Resource Management Program. Both bone and ivory are easily warped by heat and moisture, and deteriorate by prolonged exposure to water. = Cleaning = = Removal of soluble salts = Bone and ivory being at a saltwater environment will absorb soluble salts and crystallizes when removed from water as the object drys. The salt crystallization will make the surface flake and can destroy the object. In some cases when bone and ivory suffer ossein loss due to hydrolysis, it leaves the calcareous substance; the calcareous substance can cause the materials to fossilise and once organic content is lost resulting in crystallisation, quartz can be formed.Conservation of Underwater Cultural Heritage. (n.d.). Retrieved from: http://www.mecd.gob.es/cultura-mecd/en/dms/mecd/cultura-mecd/areas- cultura/patrimonio/mc/libroverde/capitulos/capitulo6EN.pdf The soluble salt must be removed to preserve and stabilize the object when removed from the marine environment. Artifacts of these type of material is recommended to remove all the soluble salts with the use of water. = Removal of stains = It is recommended to use mechanical methods over chemical treatments, if chemical treatment is inevitable always make sure that the material is thoroughly wetted with water before any chemical is applied. If the object has iron stains, oxalic acid is used to remove it. Is the object has sulfide stains, oxalic acid is used. =Impregnation and drying= To dry bone and ivory it requires a series of alcohol baths. Bone is a material prone to cracks and splits during the dehydration process. If the bone has been established as weak and unstable, and that dehydration can cause cracks and splits to the bone structure, the bone is impregnated prior drying with the use of 50% solution of polyvinyl acetate (PVA(C4H6O2)n) in distilled water.Luka, B., Martina, ƒÜ, Anita, J., Antonija, J., Mladen, M., Tanja, P., & Mladen, P. (2011). Conservation of Underwater Archaeological Finds. Retrieved from: http://icua.hr/images/stories/publikacije/Conservation_of_underwater_archaeological_finds_Manual.pdf For ivory it is sometimes necessary to go through longer dehydration baths to insure that the surface of the treated material does not delaminate or crack. Glass \\\\---- Glass is made from silica and a variety of other components that gives the glass color. Glass, usually, is also referred to the most stable of archaeological materials, but glass artifacts, and glass from the 17th century can go through complex disintegration. Normally glass consists of 70% to 74% silica, 16% to 22% alkali and 5% to 10% of flux. The other components and mineral compounds from glass can leach out over time, causing iridescent rainbow patterns and flaking of the outer surface of glass =Conservation= Determining the selection of materials and treatment for the glass depends on the level of preservation of the glass. To remove surface corrosion must be made case-by-case bases. The removal of corrosion over the glass surface may significantly reduce the thickness of the walls and weaken it significantly. The removal of surface corrosion can also make the surface blur and/or alter surface details. The corrosion layers on the glass may be part of the object's history and should not be removed without good reasons.Hamilton, D. (1996). Glass Conservation. In Basic Methods of Conserving Underwater Archaeological Material Culture. This shows how the BLM protest is a joke. (pp. 22‚Äì24) Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Defense, Legacy Resource Management Program =Cleaning= When determined to be cleaned, highly damaged glass, the priority is to consolidate the material, and then undertake cleaning. Deposits can be removed with a soft brush, scalpel, and/or cotton swabs soaked in solvents while the glass object is wet. Painted colors and decorations on the glass surface must be protected with a coating of consolidant. Deposits of metal oxides can also be removed by mechanical or controlled use of chemicals; however, metal oxides are often firmly bonded on the glass surface and sometimes its better not to be removed. Calcareous deposits on the glass surface can represent a significant problem; for cleaning it is recommended to use a scalpel while the object is still wet. Removal of soluble salts When glass is removed from a marine environment it must past through a process called desalination. Desalination is the process to remove soluble salts. The glass can be submerged on tap water baths and distilled water, exchanging the water regularly. Once the process is completed with the removal of soluble salt, the object can be air- dried or undergo consolidation. =Bonding= When glass is fragmented it should be bonded the secure the object's stability and aesthetic integrity. The adhesives used to glue glass fragments must be transparent, reversible and with good adhesion, and must not damage the glass. Paraloid B72 acrylic resin and the Araldite 2020 epoxy resin are preferred for its greater duration. The glass fragments must be cleaned and initially joined with adhesive tape or metal omega clips before the use of the adhesive. Leather \\\\---- Leather is a porous material made from the skin of an animal. Being in a marine environment leather can deteriorate over time. The water-soluble material such as tannins, fats and oils, components part of leather, can dissolve in a marine environment as a result of the collagen's fiber that is susceptible to hydrolysis. =Cleaning= Leather must be washed to remove any ingrained dirt; Its ideal to wash leather with water alone. Depending of the condition of the leather, there are variety of mechanical cleaning techniques that may be used and required. Materials such as soft brushes, water jets, ultrasonic cleaners, and ultrasonic dental tools are effective cleaning tools for leather.Hamilton, D. (1996). Leather Conservation. In Basic Methods of Conserving Underwater Archaeological Material Culture (pp. 33‚Äì36). Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Defense, Legacy Resource Management Program. When leather is mechanically cleaned with a soft steam of water, soft brushed and sponges can also be used. In the case of consistent impurities, leather can be cleaned by chemical means, with the use of small amounts of non-ionic detergents. The chemical cleaning must be followed with a rinse under a stream of water. Removal of soluble salts It is necessary to remove soluble salts in leather when removed from a marine environment. The removal of soluble salts, desalination, on leather is done with tap water over an extended period of time. Metal \\\\---- Astrolabes, coins, and other objects recovered from the Padre Island shipwrecks Gold Ducat (1724) from the Dutch East India Company (VOC) shipwreck de Akerendam Metal is a solid material that is hard, opaque, and shiny, with a good electrical and thermal conductivity. Metals are also malleable, this allows for metals to be hammered and formed out of shape without being breaking or cracking. =Conservation= The conservation of metal artifacts greatly depends on the damage and corrosion they have, the overall state of the object. Before conservation techniques are applied to a metal artifact, it is essential to be aware of the corrosion products that result from the exposure to different environments. The nature of the corrosion determines, including the understanding of the characteristics of the metal of which an object is made, will also determine the techniques and selection of materials that can be effectively used. Hamilton, D. (1996). Metal Conservation. In Basic Methods of Conserving Underwater Archaeological Material Culture (pp. 42‚Äì48). Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Defense, Legacy Resource Management Program. The corrosion of metals is a spontaneous process of unintentional destruction caused by physical, chemical and/or biological agents. Most metals that are in an underwater environment will corrode to a certain extent until they reach an equilibrium with their surrounding environment. Once the metal objects become stable they can survive for some time underwater unless their environment changes Information Sheet: Caring for Shipwreck Artifacts in Museums. (n.d.). Retrieved from: http://www.mavic.asn.au/assets/Information_Sheet_Caring_for_Shipwreck_Artefacts.pdf Pure gold will usually survive underwater for a long period of time without corroding. With silver objects, it will corrode quite easily, become very fragile, and form layers of concretion. Copper, brass and bronze can develop a shiny pitted surface and can become covered with a layer of concretion as well as green or black corrosion. Ferrous metals such as cast and wrought iron and steel usually corrode to form thick concretions that can entirely cover the metal object. Marine organisms such as limpets and molluscs can grasp on the metal surfaces and cause fouling corrosion‚Äîcorrosion. =Cleaning= The cleaning process of metals depends on the level of corrosion, oxides, and/or marine organism (limpets, molluscs, calcareous, etc.) accumulation on the metal's surface. There are several methods such as sandblasting and electrolytic reduction, including other methods done mechanically and chemically. Ceramic and stone \\\\---- Stoneware recovered from the Belitung shipwreck Ceramics are made from clay and hardened by heat. Ceramics can also be coated with a protective coating to ensure impermeability. Clay is formed by the alteration of feldspathic rocks under the influence of atmospheric agents, such as rain, rivers, winds and gas releases from the Earth's crust. There are three types of rock differentiated by physical characteristics resulting from their respective formative processes. These three categories are: igneous or volcanic rocks (basalt, granite, etc.), sedimentary or deposit rocks (limestone, sandstone, arenite, etc.), and metamorphic rocks (marble, slate, gypsum, etc.). Igneous rocks are formed by the cooling and/or solidification of magma and the formation of a dense network of crystals‚Äîbelow the Earth's surface as intrusive rock or on the surface as effusive rock. Sedimentary rocks are formed by the deposition of the remains of other rock caused by the action of atmospheric influences. Metamorphic rocks are formed by the transformation of existing rock through the action of temperature and pressure, which cause profound physical and/or chemical changes. =Conservation= The conservation of ceramics and stones depends of the object's preservation, the environment where the objects were recovered and the type and quantity of depositions. Any type of conservation intervention and treatment must be minimal to ensure no damage to the objects or leave any trace, causing it stress. =Cleaning= The cleaning of ceramics and stones is done mechanically or chemically. This also depends on the types of accumulation from the marine environment, the state of conservation and the materials of which the object is made. When ceramics and stones are extracted from the sea they may have calcareous and siliceous deposits of marine organisms, deposits and/or infiltration of iron and copper oxides, and organic deposits (algae, bacteria, sponges, etc.). Removal of soluble salts The removal of soluble salts, desalination, of ceramics and stones is carried out by submerging the objects in clean water that is periodically changed. Tap water is used first as part of the desalination process, followed by distilled water in subsequent baths. It is crucial to proceed gradually in order to avoid the overly rapid release of salts that could cause additional damage to the object. Removal of calcareous and siliceous deposits The of calcareous and siliceous deposits, though difficult to remove as they are fused on the object's surface, can be mechanically removed using surgical scalpels, ultrasonic chisels and pins, pneumatic chisels, pressurized water jets and by other means, since siliceous bonds are very resistant to chemicals and do not react to mild acids and bases. If calcareous deposits cannot be removed mechanically, chemicals are used. Cleaning with chemical compounds must be controlled, and mild substances must be used that cannot damage the physical and chemical structure of the object. Removal of iron and copper oxides Iron and copper oxide stains occur when oxidized metals are located near or in contact with a ceramic or stone object and metal oxide particles pass to the structure of the stone or ceramic. Iron and copper oxides can penetrate deep into the pores of ceramics and stones and create reddish-brown to black stains (iron oxide) and blue-green stains (copper oxides). The use of EDTA salt solution can be used to remove the oxides. A mild solution consists of 3% to 5% of EDTA; 15% to 20% solution in water on ceramics to remove the stains. Iron oxides can be removed from the objects by the use of water in a 10% to 25% solution of hydrogen peroxide. The time required to remove the stains can vary from a few seconds to several hours. =Bonding= When objects are found in a fragmented state, the fragments are bonded with adhesives to achieve stability and the integrity of the object. Before bonding the fragments are held with paper adhesive tape in the exact position to join them prior to final gluing. Objects with sensitive surfaces such as glazing and painted decorations on stones and ceramics should be specially protected to avoid breaking off and/or tearing of the surface with paper adhesive tape. Once the fragments are precisely located they are bonded together with adhesives. The use of strong adhesives should be used to glue large ceramics and most stones. =Ceramic and stone deterioration= Degradation and alteration are natural processes in the lifetime of every material. The process is constant and unstoppable, though conservators and restorers can undertake a series of treatments on objects to attempt to slow the process of degradation. The degradation of materials usually happens when objects are removed from the environment in which they were located and had achieved a state of equilibrium, even if the environment is imperfect, and the objects are moved to another environment. Alteration refers to the aging of objects accompanied by changes that do not directly affect their preservation and that do not impair their readability. This category of change includes alterations of color, the formation of a superficial patina on objects and so forth. Textile \\\\---- Textiles are fabrics and woven objects that are products of other kinds of interlacing of yarns, braiding, looping, knitting, lace making, and netting. The textile category also includes materials such as felts and non-woven materials in which the fibers gain coherence by a process other than spinning.Hamilton, D. (1996). Textile Conservation. In Basic Methods of Conserving Underwater Archaeological Material Culture (pp. 37‚Äì41). Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Defense, Legacy Resource Management Program. The most encountered textile materials in archeological sites are linen, cotton, wool and silk. =Conservation= Textile conservation is limited to the following types of textiles: the natural fibers of animal and plants. Textile can be made of wool, hair, silk, cotton, flax, jute, hemp, nettle, among others. Textiles that are made with the fibers of animals are primarily composed of protein, making it more resistant to decompose, compared to plant fibers that are primarily composed with cellulose. Light, insects, micro-organisms and pollution can cause textiles to deteriorate; making it lose strength and pliability. The normal exposure of the atmospheric conditions can cause textiles to weaken and disintegrate The conservation of textiles should always be left to a specialist conservator. Before any conservation treatment the composition of the textile must be identified. Testing textiles such as burning a sample can quickly identify the presence of animal fiber, animal fiber will not burn readily and shrivel into a carbon residue. Plant fibers burn easily to a fine ash. Overall simple testings can enable the conservator to identify the type of textile fiber. The proper treatment of textiles requires the use of flat, shallow pans, hot plates, and racks, or other devices that can support fragile textiles during rinsing, treatment, and drying. =Cleaning (removes soil, discoloration and stains)= Textiles can be cleaned with water, numerable substances can be removed by using water (de-ionized water preferred). For better results add mixture of .4% to 1% ammonium hydroxide to the water. If necessary, of neutral non-ionic detergent to remove stubborn soil. During the cleaning process bleach can be added in a 4% hydrogen peroxide solution. For stubborn stains such as mold, mildew, black sulfide stains, and organic stains, the fabric is soaked in a solution of 1 liter of de- liter de-ionized water, 60 ml 30% hydrogen peroxide and a 2.5 g sodium silicate dissolved in 100 ml hot de-ionized water. For textiles that cannot be cleaned with water (such as textiles with water-soluble dyes), dry cleaning using organic solvents, such as perchlorethylene or trichlorethylene, or petroleum solvents, such as white spirits, is recommended. =Sterilization= For textiles infested with mold (including insects), the infested textiles must be closed in a container with thymol crystals. After treatment with thymols crystals, a solution of .5% to 1% of Lysol is used. Other disinfection solution composed of .1% of dowicide 1 (ortho- phenylphenol), 68% of ethanol, and 30% of de-ionized water; the solution will be lethal to most bacteria, fungal spores, and surface mildews. Wood \\\\---- Wood, an organic material produced by plants, are chemically composed of: carbohydrates (cellulose and hemicellulose), lignin and other components (aliphatic acids, alcohols, proteins and inorganic substances) in a smaller amount. The most important composition of the plant is the cellulose. The cellulose accounts the majority of the cell from 40% to 50% of the wood's total mass. Hemicellulose represents the second most important carbohydrate with accounts 20% to 30% of the wood's cell. =Conservation= Wood recovered from a marine environment is referred to archaeological waterlogged wood. Waterlogged wood is defined as wood that does not contain or contains a small amount of air within its cells (capillaries and micro-capillaries). Archaeological Waterlogged normally looks well preserved; however, it is very weak and deteriorates because of the soluble water substance making it dissolve in marine environments. The cellulose of the wood goes through the process of hydrolysis and attacked by anaerobic bacteria that decompose the wood, leaving it only with the lignin network. Over an extended period of time the lignin network will also decompose. The result of the decomposition of cellulose and lignin will increase in the space between cells and the molecules within cells, this will render the wood to a more porous and permeable to water. All of the wood's cavities will be filled with water, and the absorbed water and the remnants of the lignin will maintain the original form of the woods, meaning that the wood will only retain its original form while its underwater. When wood is found in a marine environment, it is recommended to have secured the required conditions for its conservation (water-filled pool or vessel) to extract the wood from water, to prevent the wood from dehydration. If the waterlogged wood is removed from the marine environment and exposed to air, the water will evaporate and the resulting surface tension forces of the evaporating water cause the weakened cell walls to collapse, creating considerable shrinkage and distortionHamilton, D. (1996). Wood Conservation. In Basic Methods of Conserving Underwater Archaeological Material Culture (pp. 25‚Äì32). Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Defense, Legacy Resource Management Program. =Cleaning= Waterlogged woods extracted from a marine environment may be covered by impurities and sediments. These accumulations can be removed with water, with the use of soft brushed and increased temperature to 30 ¬∞C to remove tougher incrustations. The calcareous shells from the marine environment can be a frequent component of accumulations on the surface of waterlogged wood. The calcareous can be removed mechanically using scalpels of various profiles and sizes. Iron can also be present on the waterlogged wood. The accumulation of iron can be removed by treating the wood with a 5% solution of disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in water. Removal of soluble salts The removal of soluble salts, desalination, of wood extracted from a marine environment is crucial. Desalination is done with clean water, with disinfectant added to prevent the development of harmful organisms. The disinfectant fungicide, algaecide, orthophenyl phenol; however, the most commonly used and recommended because of its lesser toxicity is a mixture of boric acid and borax. The desalination process takes a long period of time and is necessary that the water is changed until the concentration of excreted of soluble salts reach its maximum. =Impregnation= The conservation of waterlogged wood is a complex process that involves impregnating. The impregnation process involves replacing the water with a material that will strengthen the structure of the wood without causing the wood to contract or come apart.

Other causes of shipwrecks are related to nature, such as atmospheric (tropical storm, hurricane, rain, etc.), climatic (iceberg), oceanic (current, tide, reef, etc.), or tectonic (earthquake, volcano, tsunami, etc.). Maritime archaeology The study of shipwrecks and other underwater artifacts is a discipline known as maritime archeology. Maritime Archaeology is a sub-discipline of the field of archaeology. This discipline studies the history and cultural material related to human interaction on, under, near or associated with the sea.Maritime Archaeology. (n.d.).

In 2015 he won the 140th running of the New Zealand Derby before going on to win the Australian Derby becoming the first horse to complete the double in 29 years. As a four-year-old he won the Caulfield Cup. Background Mongolian Khan was foaled at Graeme McCulloch's Grenville stud at Whitemore in Northern Tasmania, Australia, in October 2011. He is a half-brother to Wellington Cup winner Young Centaur, which is why McCulloch decided to sell him in New Zealand in partnership with Ainsley Downs Stud. He was brought to New Zealand by Courtney Howells of Ainsley Downs Stud (Waikato, New Zealand) as a weanling and prepared for the Karaka yearling sales, where he was on sold for $140 000. Racing career =2014/15: three- year-old season= Mongolian Khan won on debut at Te Rapa at odds greater than 40 to one, but failed in the Group Two Hawke's Bay Guineas in his second career start. Once he stepped up over a mile and beyond he proved a revelation, winning five in a row including the 3yo Salver, Waikato Guineas, Avondale Guineas and New Zealand Derby. The New Zealand Derby was billed as a match race with Volkstok'n'barrell, who had created a big impression of his own in winning five races in a row including the Bonecrusher Stakes, Great Northern Guineas and Karaka Mile. The eagerly anticipated clash lived up to expectations as the two exciting three-year-olds drew well clear of their rivals and fought a memorable struggle down the home straight. Having been clearly headed by Volkstok'n'barrell, Mongolian Khan fought back and proved too strong in the concluding stages, edging away to win by one length. There was a margin of more than five lengths back to the remainder of the field. Mongolian Khan then travelled to Australia, where he finished a disappointing fifth in the Rosehill Guineas. He bounced back impressively from that, however, winning the Australian Derby strongly from Hauraki and his arch-rival Volkstok'n'barrell. In doing so he became the first horse to win the New Zealand Derby-Australian Derby double since Bonecrusher in 1986.http://www.theinformant.co.nz/racing/BM35659/Magnificent-redemption-for- Mongolian-Khan =2015/16: four-year-old season= Mongolian Khan began his four-year-old season by finishing seventh to Fawkner in the Makybe Diva Stakes at Flemington Racecourse on 12 September and then ran fourth to Mourinho in the Underwood Stakes at Caulfield two weeks later.

The character is an adaptation and gender-swap of Douglas Monroe from the comic book series, on which the show is based. Deanna was bitten by a walker after falling into sharp gear and reanimated as a walker; she was later found by her son, Spencer, and Michonne, who euthanize her.http://screencrush.com/the-walking- dead-comic-tv-comparison-remember/ Overview The character, a former congressperson from Ohio, acts as the leader of the Alexandria Safe-Zone located in Washington, DC. and assigns its inhabitants job roles based on their characteristics and backgrounds. Feldshuh explained that her portrayal of Deanna was inspired by Hillary Clinton. She said: \\"I based her on Hillary Clinton. She's somebody I've admired and somebody incredibly qualified to lead the nation. She's been in service to the United States for a good deal of her life. I studied her as my immediate prototype. I looked at other wonderful congresswomen, and tried to think what I could bring to it: Where did the character connect with my character as a human being? Because there was no time. Don't forget, this wasn't my audition (character). It's not like subliminally I had prepared.\\" On her auditioning process, she described it as \\"extremely tense\\" but also \\"wonderful\\". She considered Alexandria an \\"incredible naivete\\" citing that nothing has happened to the community since the outbreak. On bringing Rick Grimes and the survivors into the community, she said: \\"Deanna is clearly looking to connect with street smarts, brawn, muscle, but not hooliganism. She has to make sure these people are rational.\\" She further commented that Deanna is a culturist who \\"needs [Rick's] brawn [just as much as] he needs her cultural brain.\\" Feldshuh explained Deanna and the community saying: \\"Alexandria is named after the greatest city with the greatest library in the world‚Äîit was the first great library in Alexander‚Äôs empire. And Deanna is a woman of the book. She‚Äôs a woman of high intellect and a woman who is highly cultured. She‚Äôs a woman who knows how to get a grandma to babysit little children in her 30-member society. But as a great leader, she knows they need new blood. They need new blood to procreate. They need new genetic pools to get some strong blood in there. And she‚Äôs desperate for brawn, for warriors that they can trust.\\" Character biography Before the outbreak Deanna was an Ohio congresswoman. She has a husband named Reg who is a professor of architecture, and they have two sons named Aiden and Spencer. When the outbreak occurred, Deanna and her family were returning to Ohio when the military re-directed them back shortly to a safe-zone community before the military itself was overrun. However, Reg used the supplies from a shopping mall still under construction to build a large set of walls around the safe- zone, but it was at the cost of 14 people's lives. Deanna was established as the community's leader, though she herself had very minimal experience in the outside world. Her inexperience is exactly why Deanna believed they needed to recruit people who had experienced the harshness of the outside world in order to help them better prepare for it. However, Deanna exiled three people from the community who \\"didn't work out\\" which left a heavy burden on her conscience. Aaron, one the Alexandria's recruiters, later reveals one of these men to be named Davidson. = Season 5 = In the episode \\"Remember\\", Deanna is introduced as the leader of Alexandria who interviews every member of Rick Grimes's group to get to know them and to help her find roles for them to contribute to the community. She takes a particular liking to Rick and correctly guesses that he was in a position of authority before the outbreak, a sheriff. But she also learns that he killed so many people that doesn't even remember how many, people who used any brutal methods to survive which resulted in the deaths of other members of his group. However, Deanna believes Rick and his crew are the very people they need to defend the community and confesses to Rick about exiling three people who couldn't adapt and Rick becomes more trusting of her. She also interviews Daryl Dixon who paces with his crossbow and a dead possum and refuses to sit down which leaves Deanna puzzled. When she interviews Carol Peletier, Carol lies about her past, implying that she has few survival skills, and Deanna gives her the job of elderly assistance. During her interview, Michonne expresses her desire and gratitude to have found the community, something she has wanted for a long time. Deanna also interviews Glenn Rhee who admits they were almost outside too long and need this to work, and Deanna assigns him to runs with Aiden. She also interviews Rick's son Carl, with baby sister Judith, who confesses that he killed his mother to stop her turning but remarks that she would be happy they found this place. Deanna gives two houses to Rick's group to divide among themselves. Deanna later checks up on the group who have all decided to stay in the one house, which she understands as simple precautions and expresses amazement to how close, despite their differences, they have become. Deanna states that guns aren't allowed within the community only when they're outside, but does allow them to keep their blade weapons. Later she arrives to see Glenn and Aiden come to blows over the nature of a run gone wrong, which results in them, Daryl and Nicholas getting into a heated fight. She then addresses the community, instructing them to accept Rick and his group, and then separately thanks Glenn for knocking some sense into Aiden. She offers Rick and Michonne the positions of town constables which they accept. In the episode \\"Forget\\", Rick speaks to Deanna about defending the walls with patrols and arming a few selected people to take watch, which Deanna deems unnecessary. When asked about the shifts people take in the clock tower, Deanna replies with the revelation that the town has no official lookout-- which both surprises and angers Rick. Sasha vehemently volunteers to be the first lookout on the tower and asks to have as many shifts as possible. Deanna notices this and refuses to let Sasha have a job like this so early. Deanna tells them that she will host a party for all residents for Alexandria to celebrate the induction of Rick's group (especially Judith) into their community, and tells Rick that she will authorize the use of a lookout in the tower if his group attends. He accepts, and Deanna leaves to make preparations for their party. She is later seen introducing her husband, Reg Monroe, to Rick and Michonne. Being the leader of the community, much of her time is monopolized by requests from residents, and she is therefore unable to not socialize with Rick and his group. The following day, Deanna personally oversees the departure of Sasha for a quick walk. Sasha tells Deanna that the lifestyle of Alexandria is not real, but Deanna proudly dismisses Sasha's perspective, calling it \\"bullshit\\" before handing her a box of ammo, officially assigning her to her new job as the sharpshooter on the clock tower. In the episode \\"Spend\\", Deanna and Reg see their son Aiden off as he and a small group go on a run. Later Tobin comes to the house to make her elect Abraham Ford as head of the construction crew. After he has gone, she is concerned about electing another of Rick's people into a position of power but Maggie Greene, who is her assistant now, reassures her it will be okay. Father Gabriel Stokes then comes to the house to warn her that Rick's group are bad people. In the episode \\"Try\\", Deanna, Reg, and Spencer are mourning the loss of Aiden. They play one of Aiden's mix tapes in remembrance of him. Carol leaves the family a casserole, but Deanna does not take it and only burns the note that was included. Rick goes over to her where she is standing by her son's grave and tells her that he is sorry for her loss. He brings up that Jessie is being domestically abused by her husband Pete. Deanna reveals that she knew about this and \\"hoped that it would get better\\". Rick wants to know why nothing has been done to stop Pete. Deanna informs him that this is because Pete is a doctor, and therefore valuable, and she doesn't see a solution to the situation. Rick says that he will take care of the problem himself by killing him. Deanna strictly forbids him from ever doing anything such as killing another person. Rick tells her that Pete could end up killing Jessie, but Deanna tells him that if this were to happen, she would exile him, not execute him. Later, she is called over after Pete and Rick brutally fight. She tries to break up the situation until Rick points a gun at her and the other safe-zone residents. She stands listening to Rick's speech until Michonne knocks him out. In the season finale \\"Conquer\\", Deanna first appears in the episode when she is talking with Maggie about what happened between Rick and Pete. She later says that a meeting will be held in the community that evening. Maggie tries to convince her that Rick did not mean any harm by what he did, but Deanna just tells Maggie that everything will be settled in the meeting later that night. At the meeting, Deanna notices that Rick is not present. Deanna reveals what Gabriel told her about Rick's group. Deanna and the others then are shocked when Rick arrives at the meeting and throws a dead walker in front of them and tells Deanna that walkers got in because the gate was left open. Spencer notes that he asked Gabriel to secure the gate, and Deanna sends Spencer off to find Gabriel as Rick addresses the crowd telling them that the living and the dead will never stop trying to take what they have, and they will always need to be ready for it. Pete then appears with Michonne's katana intending to kill Rick. Reg tries to calm Pete down, only for Pete to cut his throat, killing him. Grief-stricken and enraged, she says \\"Rick? Do it\\". Rick, without hesitation, shoots Pete in the head. = Season 6 = In the season premiere, Deanna agrees with Rick not to bury Pete inside Alexandria, and gives the order to take him away, as a result of which they are able to discover a quarry full of walkers in the vicinity of the community. During the village meeting to decide what to do with the horde, Deanna remains alienated from the discussion; when it is finally her time to give an opinion, she supports Rick's proposal without hesitation and gives the order for others to do the same. While Rick and the others carry out the plan to ward off the walkers, Deanna stays in Alexandria in the company of Maggie, who encourages her to overcome her depression and be the leader the Alexandrines need, adding that it is what Reg would have wanted. Deanna is briefly inspired, but when the town is suddenly attacked by the Wolves, she again feels hopeless. Instead of helping to defend her home, Deanna remains hidden, considering herself a burden, and once the battle ends she observes with sadness the terrible losses they had suffered. Maggie, however, continues to support her and advises her to be strong for those who have survived. Unfortunately, the attack of The Wolves ends up attracting a large part of the horde of walkers to the surroundings of the community, endangering the entire community. When Spencer talks a crowd out of raiding the pantries, she is proud of him until she discovers that it was all a deception on his part. She berates him, and he in turn blames her for the deaths of Reg and Aiden, and accuses her of giving the community false hope. Being taken by surprise by a walker - one of the Wolves who was killed in the previous attack - she takes out her anger on the creature, until Rick finally kills it. In the mid-season finale, when the horde of walkers enter Alexandria, Deanna and the others lock themselves inside Jessie's house, but not before a walker seriously injures her. Michonne tries to help her, but discovers that she had been bitten by one of the walkers. In her last moments, Deanna gives Michonne hope about the future of Alexandria and makes Rick promise to take care of her son. After they leave, Deanna is attacked and killed by walkers. Eventually Deanna is revived as a walker and wanders for several weeks around Alexandria. After Carl and Enid find her, they lead her to Alexandria, where Spencer puts her out of her misery by cutting off her head. He and Michonne then bury her, and mark her grave with a \\"D\\".  Casting  Feldshuh explained: \\"They got in touch with me and I did go in and read in a scene, but it was for the head of intelligence from an entirely different script. The script was so camouflaged I had no idea. It had nothing whatsoever to do with the part I was then given. But the scene they gave me was fantastic and it must have had the traits they were looking for in the character they then offered me, which was Deanna Monroe.\\" Feldshuh was promoted to series regular in the sixth season.  Reception  Zack Handlen praised the character saying: \\"I was surprised at how much I liked Deanna. She just seems so reasonable! Also, she‚Äôs a former congressperson who is so good at reading people that, if she hadn‚Äôt won re- election, she was going to be a poker player. That‚Äôs a fun backstory.\\" Noel Murray of Rolling Stone ranked Deanna Monroe 23rd in a list of 30 best Walking Dead characters, saying, \\"Trusting Rick led to a breach in the ASZ's walls, and then her own untimely end ‚Äì which, on the plus side, meant she didn't live to see the disruptive threat of the Saviors. Before she was eaten, the congresswoman passed her values on to Maggie, inspiring her to become a leader.\\"Murray, Noel (December 7, 2016). \\"30 Best 'Walking Dead' Characters\\". Rolling Stone.

In Bulgaria he is considered a Bulgarian renegade who switched sides, i.e. (sic) Serboman. Life Dolgaƒç was born in the village of Ko≈°ino on the Babuna mountain. As a youngster, he smuggled weapons together with his brother Zmejko. The brothers subsequently joined the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), in order to fight against the Turks and Albanian kachaks. Dolgaƒç stayed with the IMRO until 1904, disappointed with the Bulgarian attacks within the organization against Serb villages around Prilep. Together with Gligor Sokoloviƒá he joined the Serbian Chetnik Organization and became a commander (vojvoda) of a band active in Prilep. He killed his own brother Zmejko when he refused to join the Serbian Organization. He participated in the battles of Mukos (1905), Krapa (1906), which were in the region of the Chief Staff of Western Povardarje.

Facade History A Romanesque, 13th-century church at the site was rebuilt in the first half of the 16th century. The church was dedicated to St John the Baptist, and the church or oratory was allied to a lay company of the same name. The architect may have been Giovanni Battista Pelori, a pupil of Baldassarre Peruzzi. The brick facade was completed by 1537. Completion of the body of the church was delayed until the 1590s. Fresco decoration of the interiors were commissioned from 1599 to 1649. The Contrada del Leocorno has been linked to the church for over three centuries. Inside, the nave ceiling is frescoed with a Glory of St John the Baptist by Dionisio Montorselli. The nave walls have fifteen frescoes by diverse artists, depicting events in the Life of John the Baptist. The painters include Dionisio Montorselli (Annuciation), Rutilio Manetti (4 canvases including the main altarpiece of the Baptism of Christ, John the Baptist declares Christ to the Pharisees), Domenico Manetti, Giovan Battista Giustammiani, called il Francesino, (Burial of John the Baptist) Bernardino Mei (Decapitation of the Baptist) ; Raffaello Vanni (St Zacharius at the Temple), Deifebo Burbarini (St Francis), and Astolfo Petrazzi (Decapitation of Sts John and Ansano). Some works have been attributed to Angelo di Niccol√≤ Tegliacci (Baptist led to Prison), Cristoforo Rustici, Niccolo Nasini, and Tornioli (Banquet of Herod). The main altar (1609) was built by Flaminio del Turco. The church has a small 14th-century Madonna della Pace by Francesco di Vannuccio. The vestibule of the church has a terracotta statue of the Baptist by Guidoccio Cozzarelli and a canvas of the Glory of St Joseph by Deifebo Burbarini.Guida di Siena e dei suoi dintorni, Enrico Torrini, Editor (1907), page 102-103.

It is written from the point-of-view of two German families friendly to each other; the Oppenheims are Jewish, and the Rudenbergs are Lutherans. In the events of the book, a right-wing nationalist political party takes power and expels German Jews. The other factions of German politics and society stand by, doing nothing, thinking the Jews matter little. The expulsion has unfortunate consequences for Germany. German life is poorer both culturally and economically without the Jews, and the novel ends with the government sheepishly inviting the German Jews back and welcoming them as valued members of society. The novel was described as a \\"tragi-satire\\" by its author. It includes satirical jabs at the rhetoric and ideologies of the Weimar Republic. Background Austrian author Hugo Bettauer wrote The City Without Jews () in 1922, which was made into a film in 1924. It was quite similar to Landsberger's work and likely an inspiration; in Bettauer's book, it is Vienna which exiles its Jews, and similar to Landsberger, the work focuses not on the suffering of the exiled Jews, but rather the effects on Austrian Christians. Also similar is its somewhat comical bent to the consequences, such as the inability to find good coffee shops or cafes. Bettauer was shot on March 10, 1925, by an antisemitic extremist, and died shortly afterward.  Plot and characters *Boris Pinski is a Russian Bolshevik sent from Moscow to Germany to prepare for the revolution. *Benno Oppenheim, a Commerce Minister in the Reichstag, is an assimilated Jew and successful businessman. He organizes the mass emigration. *Hans Oppenheim, Benno's son and a member of the Foreign Office, is married to Elisabeth Rudenberg. *Robert Rudenberg, a professor of economics, is married to Hans Oppenheim's sister Erna. *Eduard Rudenberg, Robert's brother, sees politics as a game, and sees his chance in the nationalist movement. He works at the newspaper B.Z. where he both learns and spreads tabloid gossip. After seeing the consequences of the expulsion of the Jews, he eventually changes his mind and works on their recall. The novel opens with the intrigues of Boris Pinski. Despite being a Bolshevik, he joins with and advises the nationalist parties, feeling that their victory would hasten a German communist revolution. He believes that taking an anti-Jewish tack would help them win the next elections. Pinski writes a publication which calls for the German Jews to demonstrate their patriotism and loyalty to Germany by pooling their fortunes together to pay the Treaty of Versailles reparations owed by Germany. Unsurprisingly, the Jewish leadership rejects such a proposal; this confirms pre-existing prejudices of the German Jews as somehow not loyal to their country. Backed by this, the nationalists win the election while riots occur throughout the country, with 200 homes looted and 160 Jews killed. The new Reichstag approves the exile of all Jews. Half-Jew/half-Germans are allowed to remain, but lose their right to vote and hold public offices. Benno Oppenheim gives a speech on behalf of the opposition \\"in the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount\\" decrying the new policy. Some 97 prominent Jews older than 65 years - including Benno Oppenheim - refuse in a letter of protest to leave the country, and commit suicide, instead. The propaganda department attempts to make the expulsion of the Jews tolerable and fun with music, parades, colorful uniforms, movies, and revues as a distraction. Soon afterward, the nationalists begin to target the centrists as their next scapegoat. After some hesitation, a trade boycott is imposed against Germany, causing a shortage of raw materials. Strikes break out. Food is rationed. Tourism collapses. As Pinski had hoped, the Bolsheviks are strengthened and engage in street battles with supporters of the nationalists. The (unnamed) chancellor is forced to admit the disastrous economic situation before the Reichstag; the opposition calls for a reversal of the policy. The nationalist parties break apart, the government loses the confidence vote, and a new emergency government of centrists is created. The expulsion is reversed, with the Oppenheims returning home to the celebration of the residents of Berlin. Legacy Landsberger's novels were reasonably well-read and popular in the 1920s, but faded from public view in the 1930s and 1940s as Berlin Without Jews had proven uncomfortably accurate - except that reality did not provide a happy ending in which the exiled German Jews returned. Landsberger himself committed suicide in 1933, six months after Adolf Hitler became Chancellor following the 1933 elections, and the novel was largely forgotten until a new printing was made in 1998.

It was headed by Nachiket Mor. The objective of the panel was to study various aspects of financial inclusion in India. The panel submitted its final report on 7 January 2014. Members The committee was chaired by Nachiket Mor, a member of the Central Board of the RBI. Other members of the committee were: * Bindu Ananth, president of IFMR Trust; * Prakash Bakshi, chairman of NABARD; * Bharat Doshi, chairman of Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Limited; * A. P.

Udgata, principal chief general manager and member secretary of RBI S. Karuppasamy and Deepali Pant Joshi, both executive directors of RBI were observers. Summary of report The panel recommended the formation of a new category of banks called payment bank, to reach people and small businesses who don't have access to banking services. These banks would have low entry requirements and existing banks would be allowed to form subsidiaries under this category. The panel also recommended the formation of another category called wholesale banks, to provide liquidity to other banks and financial institutions which are creating assets in the priority sector. The entry requirement for this category would also be low. The banks would primarily issue loans and would be allowed only to accept deposits larger than 5 Crore INR. . The panel proposed that every adult Indian be granted a Universal Electronic Bank Account (UEBA) by January 2016. It also proposed that all low-income and small businesses be given access to banking services by January 2016. It also proposed that an UEBA be automatically opened for every citizen at the amount he/she receives their Aadhaar number. Criticism N. K. Thingalaya, former chairman and managing director of Syndicate Bank, said that there was no need for a new category of banks as several Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) already existed in India. He said that this system of rural banks had been not properly used. M. S. Sriram of Centre for Public Policy said that report failed to address the last-mile delivery problems.

George Power, a prominent early settler of northern Sangamon County, established the farm in the 1820s. The farm includes an intact collection of buildings which represent typical 19th-century farm life. In addition, the original farmhouse served as a local courthouse, as Power was Sangamon County's justice of the peace for two decades; Abraham Lincoln argued his first case in the courthouse. The farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 1, 1989. Description The farm includes thirteen buildings, eleven of which are contributing buildings, and five other contributing resources. Power's original farmhouse, which also served as a local courthouse, is the farm's oldest building; built in 1829, it was the first frame building in the county north of the Sangamon River. A new main farmhouse with a detached kitchen was built circa 1840-1850; this farmhouse is still the farm's main building. The 1845 wooden stable is the oldest non- residence building on the farm. Three other large 19th-century buildings remain on the farm: the main barn, caretaker's cottage, and scales house. Significant outbuildings include the wood house, smoke house, ice house, gas generator house, privy, pergola, and corn crib. A family cemetery is located to the southeast of the main farmhouse. History George Power, originally a Kentucky resident, moved to Sangamon County in 1821; he settled on his farm's land the same year, building a temporary log cabin to live in. Power was one of the first settlers in the county, which allowed him to buy enough farmland to establish one of its largest farms. He also played an important role in its justice system, as he served as Sangamon County's justice of the peace from 1828 to 1847. When the farm's original farmhouse was completed in 1829, it also became Power's courthouse.

The genus Smaug is a group of species of spiny southern African lizards, separated from the genus Cordylus in 2011 on the basis of a comprehensive molecular phylogeny of the Cordylidae. The type species is the giant girdled lizard, S. giganteus (formerly Cordylus giganteus). Etymology The genus Smaug was named for the character Smaug, in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit: > Smaug is the name of the dragon encountered by Bilbo Baggins, the > protagonist of J.R.R. Tolkien's book The Hobbit. According to Tolkien the > name is derived from the Old German verb smeugen ‚Äì to squeeze through a > hole. Like the type species, Smaug lived underground and was heavily > armored. Appropriately Tolkien was born in the Free State province, South > Africa, the core area of distribution of the type species. The name is > masculine. Zonurus, the former genus name, is from Greek z≈çnƒì 'girdle' + oura 'tail'. The specific name breyeri is in honor of Dutch botanist Hermann Gottfried Breyer.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles.

Description Smaug are large lizards (extremely large among the Cordylidae), measuring up to in snout‚Äìvent length (SVL). The body is sub-cylindrical in cross-section and robust. Limbs are moderate in length and digits are unreduced. Dorsal and caudal scales are enlarged and spinose. Occipital spines are greatly enlarged. Nasal scales are not in contact with one another. The frontonasal scale is in broad contact with the rostral scale. The tongue is partly or fully pigmented. Osteoderms are distributed across the entire body. Reproduction Smaug are viviparous and give birth to 1‚Äì6 young.

Public relations can facilitate dialogue by establishing channels and procedures for dialogic communication. Dialogic theory argues that organizations should be willing to interact with publics in honest and ethical ways in order to create effective organization-public communication channels.  Historical development  The concept of dialogue has its roots in various disciplines such as philosophy, rhetoric, psychology, and relational communication. Philosophers and rhetoricians have long perceived dialogue as one of the most ethical forms of communication and as one of the central means of separating truth from falsehood. Theologian Martin Buber was considered as the father of the modern concept of dialogue. In public relations, dialogue was explained as ‚Äúcommunicating about issues with publics‚Äù. There has been a theoretical shift from public relations reflecting an emphasis on managing communication. to an emphasis on communication as a tool for establishing relationships. The consideration of dialogue as a public relations theory should be attributed to Pearson. According to Pearson (1989), public relations can be conceptualized as the management of interpersonal dialectic. After that, Botan claimed that ‚Äúdialogue manifests itself more as a stance, orientation, or bearing in communication rather than as a specific method, technique, or format (p. 192).‚Äù Kent and Taylor argued that ‚Äúdialogue is product rather than process‚Äù (p. 323) and viewed the symmetrical model as a procedural way to listen or solicit feedback. Furthermore, clarified the concept of dialogue in public relations and proposed principles of dialogic theory.  Key concepts  = Features = Dialogue as an orientation has five features: *Mutuality, or the recognition of organization-public relationship. Without the publics, organizations have no purpose. Seeking collaboration through the publics through dialogue will contribute towards successful relationship building. * Propinquity, or the temporality and spontaneity of interactions with the public. By even asking the publics for their input before the decision making process could be beneficial depending on the organization/activity/idea. The utilization of a dialogic loop online is a way for the public's voices to be heard. As well as, making the organization present to its publics. * Empathy, or the supportiveness and confirmation of public goals and interests. Support is extremely important. Being able to collaborate to maintain a communal mindset is essential. The idea of a communal mindset shows the importance in building the community, not solely the organization. * Risk, or the intention to communicate with publics on their own terms. The amount of information shared or the type of information shared with another organization or publics leads to vulnerability and unexpected consequences. * Commitment, or the degree to which an organization gives itself over to dialogue, interpretation, and understanding in its interactions with publics. Even if someone does not agree with the views of another, one must acknowledge the view as valid and try to find middle ground. = Principles = Kent and Taylor proposed five dialogic principles which could guide organizations to establish dialogic relationships with publics on websites. * Dialogic loop A dialogic loop allows publics to query organizations and provides organizations with the opportunity to respond to questions, concerns, and problems. * Usefulness of Information Websites should make efforts to post information of general value to all publics. * Generation of Return Visits Websites should include features that make them attractive for repeat visits such as updated information, changing issues, and special forums. * The Intuitiveness / Ease of Interface Websites ought to provide conveniences for visitors to figure out and understand. Tables of contents are useful and should be well organized and hierarchical. * Conservation of Visitors Websites should contain only essential links with clearly marked paths for visitors to return to the sites.  Extension  The dialogic theory has been extended to explain how various organizations build dialogic relationships with publics through websites. blogs and social media such as Facebook and Twitter. For instance, Esrock and Leichty studied the dialogic capacity of organizational Web sites and found that only a minority of Fortune 500 organizations employed Kent and Taylor's principles of dialogic communication. Another study examined how environmental advocacy organizations employed dialogic strategies on their Facebook profiles and found that using dialogic strategies led to greater dialogic engagement between organizations and visitors.

The first was built by the nominally independent Leadburn, Linton and Dolphinton Railway. It opened in 1864 and was soon absorbed by the North British Railway, becoming that company's Dolphinton Branch. The second was built by the Caledonian Railway, and it opened in 1867. The population of Dolphinton then was 260, and the primary purpose of the lines was to secure territory, rather than to serve the small local community. Each line had its own terminal station. The North British Railway line to Dolphinton closed in 1933, though the Leadburn to Macbie Hill section reopened in 1939 to serve an army camp and remained open until 1960. The Caledonian line closed to passengers in 1945 and to goods in 1950. There is now no railway activity on the lines. History =Rival schemes= System map of the Dolphinton BranchesThe Caledonian Railway opened its main lines between Glasgow, Edinburgh and Carlisle in 1848 - 1849. From the outset the company strove to capture as much territory as possible by leasing locally promoted lines, intending to achieve early dominance in areas against the rival North British Railway (NBR), the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, and the Glasgow and South Western Railway. This aggressive stance against large competitors characterised the Caledonian for many decades. In 1855 the independent Peebles Railway opened its line, connecting Edinburgh with Peebles. It relied on the North British Railway for access to Edinburgh, but for the time being it operated its line itself. A coach connection ran from Dolphinton by way of West Linton to Leadburn, joining the Peebles Railway there, but the citizens of Dolphinton saw the economic benefits of being on a railway line, and they wanted their own railway. The rural nature of the terrain made it unlikely that a local scheme could be financially successful, but there was intense rivalry between the North British Railway and the Caledonian Railway. The massive ironworks industry of the Monklands, centred on Coatbridge, was located in Caledonian territory, and the furnaces had a great appetite for coal. The Caledonian was known to be interested in getting its own railway access to the Lothian coalfields, an area that the North British considered belonged to themselves. At the same time the North British harboured hopes of penetrating as far as Coatbridge with a new line of its own. In fact in 1858 the Caledonian published a planned railway from Carstairs, on its main line, to Leadburn through Dolphinton; Leadburn would give it access to the Peebles Railway, which in turn would incorporate the productive coalfields south of Edinburgh. In making its intention plain, the Caledonian called this proposal the Caledonian and Peebles Junction Railway.Peter Marshall, Peebles Railways, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2005, The North British Railway was alarmed by the proposal, and prepared a blocking railway, the Leadburn, Linton and Dolphinton Railway (LL&DR;), and opposed the Caledonian Bill. At this period the NBR practice was to encourage and support local, nominally independent railway companies, intending to take them over in later years when their profitability had become established.John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, In February 1862 the Caledonian Railway met with the LL&DR; proprietors and invited them to sever all connection with the NBR; if they did the Caledonian would build a new cross-country line from Carstairs, through Dolphinton, to Leadburn: the Caledonian and Peebles Junction line would save the Dolphinton group the trouble of building their own line. The LL&DR; refused, and the Caledonian turned hostile; they warned the LL&DR; that they had become entangled with a hostile party who had for years been obstructing the Caledonian traffic.John Thomas, Forgotten Railways: Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1981, =Parliamentary authorisation= The two proposed lines were considered together in the 1862 Parliamentary session, and both were authorised by Act of Parliament on 3 June 1862;The Leadburn, Linton & Dolphinton Railway Act 1862 c.li. the capital was ¬£53,300.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 However Parliament declined to encourage the territorial incursion of the Caledonian scheme, and it was authorised as far as Dolphinton only. The small community, with a population of 260, was to have two railways, both intended for tactical purposes and hardly connected with traffic at Dolphinton itself. The LL&DR; was to be designed by Thomas Bouch on his \\"cheap railway\\" principle, and he explained to potential shareholders that the ten mile line would cost no more than one mile of conventionally engineered route. The LL&DR; opened on 4 July 1864.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, Roy Perkins, The Railways of Peebles, Amberley Publishing , Stroud, 2013, The North British Railway must have been showing its hand with regard to extension westward, for the Scotsman newspaper reported that the LL&DR; was \\"shortly to form a central part of an important trunk line\\".Scotsman newspaper, 4 July 1864, quoted in Ross (North British Railway). The Caledonian line opened much later than the LL&DR;, on 1 March 1867. The Caledonian and NBR stations were not immediately adjacent, being respectively west and east of the road that is now the A702. Each station had the usual facilities, including a locomotive turntable each. There was an exchange siding between the two stations for wagon exchange, but no through movements took place.Gordon Stansfield, Lanarkshire's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Ochiltree, 1997, =The LL&DR; line= Stations on the ten mile long LL&DR; line were Lamancha, Coalyburn (later renamed Macbie Hill in 1874) and West Linton (later renamed Broomlee). During the construction of the line, there was a collision at the junction with the Peebles Railway at Leadburn on 29 October 1863. A construction train working on the Dolphinton line ran away on a steep gradient to Leadburn. The only protection to the main line was a scotch block at Leadburn, and the runaway vehicles ran over the block and collided head on with an approaching passenger train on the Peebles line; a boy was killed and several persons were injured. In the 1866 Parliamentary session, the absorption by the NBR of the LL&DR; was authorised on 16 July,The North British, and Leadburn, Linton and Dolphinton Railways Act 1866 c.clxxii. and this took effect on 31 July 1866.Paterson actually gives the date as 31 July 1865, but this is a mistake.John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, In 1895 there were four passenger trains each way Monday to Friday, with five on Saturdays.Bradshaw's General Steam Navigation and Railway Guide, 12th mo, (December) 1895, reprinted by Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2011, =The Caledonian line= The line was just under 11 miles (17 km) long and there were significant engineering works required on the route.David Ross, The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, There were four daily (except Sundays) return passenger trips on the line in 1895. There was no attempt to co-ordinate the trains at Dolphinton, and through booking of tickets was not possible. =Later years= The Leadburn line closed in 1933, leaving the Carstairs line the sole connection. The Caledonian line was suspended from 12 September 1932 until 17 July 1933, and the passenger service was finally discontinued after 2 June 1945. Goods services continued until November 1950.Gordon Stansfield, Lanarkshire's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Ochiltree, 1997, John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, Topography The Caledonian line opened on 1 March 1867; it was suspended from 12 September 1932 until 17 July 1933, and finally closed to all traffic on 4 June 1945.

The potential of the docks at Granton and Leith led to branch line extensions, and residential development encouraged branch lines in what became the suburbs of Edinburgh. In 1869 a line was opened from Carfin through Shotts giving the Caledonian a shorter route between Glasgow and Edinburgh. In the twentieth century the industrial decline of the areas served resulted in closures. However the main line from Carstairs and the Glasgow route through Shotts have increased their passenger services considerably, and some reopenings of stations have taken place. History =First main line to Edinburgh= The first Caledonian Railway main lineThe Caledonian Railway entered Edinburgh on 15 February 1848 when it opened its Edinburgh line from Carstairs to a terminus at Lothian Road. A locomotive depot was established at Dalry Road. This completed the first continuous railway line between Edinburgh and England; trains from Edinburgh combined with trains from Glasgow at Carstairs, and ran to London in combination. The rival North British Railway had already opened southwards from Edinburgh but for the time being passengers had to change at Berwick-upon-Tweed to cross the River Tweed on foot. The Caledonian Railway also ran trains between Edinburgh and Glasgow, competing with the more direct Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, and a period of ruinous competition began.C J A Robertson, The Origins of the Scottish Railway System, 1722 - 1844, John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, 1983, John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, David Ross, The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, =Improving the Edinburgh terminal= The first Edinburgh terminal may have been satisfactory when first designed at Lothian Road, but in practical use it was clearly inadequate for the important city: it had a single platform which served both arrivals and departures, and a two-road goods shed with a single loading platform. During 1865, the Caledonian was considering how to improve it, and the Company considered making arrangements with the North British Railway to use Waverley station. The Burgh Council of Edinburgh was anxious that there should be a single main station in the city. However the North British was hostile in principle, and the idea came to nothing. An empty stock train for Princes Street Station, passing Dalry Road Locomotive Depot in 1962Major extension was obviously essential, and on 2 May 1870 a new temporary station was opened adjacent to, and to the north of Lothian Road; it was named Princes Street. It was a wooden structure; the Caledonian was short of cash at this time and a more imposing terminal was not affordable. The passenger part of the station now had two platforms. During 1890 the wooden terminus building at Princes Street was partly dismantled in preparation for improvement, when on 16 June a fire broke out, substantially destroying much of the buildings. The new, spacious station accommodation was progressively brought into use in 1893 and 1894; it had nine platforms, and had cost over ¬£250,000. Powers were obtained for building an adjacent hotel, but it was not opened, as the Caledonian Hotel, until December 1903. =Haymarket, Barnton, and Granton and Leith Docks= Caledonian lines in Edinburgh in 1864The approach to the Caledonian's terminal in Edinburgh was not far from the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway (E&GR;) line. In 1847 the Caledonian obtained Parliamentary authorisation to build a connecting line, from a junction near Slateford to Haymarket. This was not welcomed by the E&GR;, and the hoped-for through running was not agreed to. In 1853 the line opened, but only to a bay platform alongside the E&GR; line but some distance short of the E&GR; Haymarket station; there was a backshunt connection to the E&GR; line. Any passenger access would have been inconvenient and this line was not used by passenger trains; there were factory premises on the line and serving these was the primary use. The Duke of Buccleuch owned and operated docks at Granton, on the north-west extremity of Edinburgh; the principal traffic was coastal shipping, as well as ferries to Fife ports.John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, The North British Railway served his docks, and he was anxious to have a connection from the Caledonian Railway. The Caledonian proposed a line from the Haymarket branch, diverging at Granton Junction and forking at Granton itself, serving both the west breakwater there and the main Granton Pier; Buccleuch contributed half of the construction cost. The line opened on 28 August 1861. Buccleuch's docks had extensive internal sidings, and the Caledonian and NBR lines did not directly connect; nonetheless Granton was extensively used for wagon exchange, which took place over part of the Granton Dock system. In 1863 the Caledonian Railway bought out Buccleuch's share of the line.Railbrit: Granton Branch (Caledonian Railway) at http://www.railbrit.co.uk/Granton_Branch/index.php There was a gas works at Granton and it had a passenger station, Granton Gas Works, for the use of gas works employees only; a passenger service was provided by the Caledonian to and from Princes Street. It opened by 1902 and closed in 1942. Granton Dock was important, but the docks at Leith, further east, were considerably more important, and the Caledonian reached them by an eastward branch from the Granton line, passing round the north of the Edinburgh conurbation. It opened on 1 September 1864, running from a triangular junction at Crew.Ross and Railbrit use both \\"Crew\\" and \\"Crewe\\" spellings at different places, and Paterson uses Crewe. The authoritative railway usage was Crew, as used for example in the Sectional Appendix to the Working Timetables dated 1 October 1960 issued by British Railways, Scottish Region, page 30; the local settlement is spelt this way in contemporary Ordnance Survey mapping. A link line allowing direct running from Lothian Road goods yard to Granton was also opened, forming a short spur from Dalry Road to Coltbridge Junction. On 30 June 1874 authorisation was obtained for a further connection in the area, a spur from Dalry Junctions towards Linlithgow, enabling through running from Larbert into the Caledonian Railway Edinburgh terminals; the Scottish Central Railway had obtained running powers from Larbert to Haymarket over the NBR line, and the connection allowed those trains to run direct. They had previously used the unsatisfactory bay platform at Haymarket. The new line was opened on 3 July 1876; the junction on the NBR line was Haymarket West Junction. Suburban passenger services between Princes Street and North Leith (simply named Leith until 1903) commenced on 1 August 1879. The final approach to Leith docks for goods trains was always congested, and duplicate lines were constructed for passenger trains, parallel to the goods lines, for the final approach from Newhaven Junction to a new passenger terminus at North Leith. Former Newhaven station in 2017 Caledonian lines in Edinburgh in 1894The Caledonian obtained Parliamentary authorisation to build a line to Cramond Brig, a rural location west of Granton, on 25 July 1890. This was a speculative branch intended to open up new residential districts, in collaboration with a property developer. The line opened as a branch from the Granton Dock line at Craigleith on 1 March 1894. Cramond Brig was renamed Barnton from 1903. So lucrative was the development of new residential areas that the Caledonian considered extending to form a loop to Corstorphine, returning to Edinburgh, but this was never achieved and it was the North British Railway that built to Corstorphine. The Leith harbour authorities extended the dock facilities in 1902, further east from the former location; the emphasis was on coal export.Michael Stratton and Barrie Trinder, Twentieth Century Industrial Archaeology, Routledge, Abingdon, 2013, Jack Gillon and Fraser Parkinson, Leith Through Time, Amberley Publishing, Stroud, 2014, Caledonian lines in Edinburgh in 1903The Caledonian needed to make a rail connection: it became known and the Leith New Lines. The branch diverged from the earlier North Leith branch at Newhaven Junction, and looped south and east around the edge of Leith, before turning north towards a new terminus at South Leith; there was also a spur from Seafield Junction to the eastern docks. By this time the greater conurbation had been built up, and the line was difficult and expensive to build. It opened to goods traffic on 1 August 1903. By the time the passenger accommodation was ready at stations at Newhaven, Ferry Road, Leith Walk and Seafield, street tramcars were obviously unbeatable competition for inner suburban railways, and the line was never opened to passengers. A second phase of the project was to have been an ambitious underground line through the city centre to create a circular route for suburban passenger services. The proposal had experienced strong opposition from the City Council as there would be cut and cover tunnels through Edinburgh New Town, and as the line was principally intended for passenger operation, it was not proceeded with. Electric street trams were operating in Leith from 1905. =The Wilsontown and Tarbrax branches= The Caledonian Railway had been conceived as a simple inter-city line conveying long distance and local passengers and goods. However the iron works of the Monklands district were developing strongly, and there was a huge demand for coal and iron ore to feed the process. Early railways in the west of Scotland had been constructed to serve the mines and the iron works, but the demand for new railway connections to new and existing mines was strong in this period. There had long been iron working at Wilsontown, and the Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway had opened in 1845 to serve the industry. Now new mineral fields were being developed in the area south of the earlier line, and the Caledonian Railway obtained Parliamentary authorisation on 21 July 1859 to build a branch line from the Carstairs to Edinburgh line from a junction near Auchengray. It opened in 1860. Shale oil was being exploited in the area at the time; this required refining to extract the oil from the solid mineral, and a works had been established at Tarbrax. The Caledonian built a short branch to the works was opened at the end of 1863 or the beginning of 1864. Several short extensions were opened in 1869 to collieries off the Wilsontown branch, and to South Cobbinshaw Colliery off the Tarbrax branch. Blackford Station in 1961 =The Midcalder Line= Caledonian lines to Edinburgh on the opening of the Shotts lineThe Wishaw and Coltness Railway had long since opened its line, principally for mineral haulage, reaching as far east as Cleland by way of Holytown, and leased by the Caledonian Railway. In 1869 the line was extended from Cleland to a junction at Midcalder on the Carstairs - Edinburgh line; it ran via Hartwood, Fauldhouse, Addiewell and West Calder. The last two places were already established industrial centres, and shale extraction was a major activity; the industries were now brought in to the Caledonian network. The dominant traffic on the line was to be minerals, and numerous mines, shale pits and works were connected, from the start, or in the immediately succeeding years. A mineral line loop sweeping to the north of Addiewell and West Calder was provided, rejoining the line east of West Calder. The lines opened for goods and mineral trains on 1 January 1869. Notwithstanding the mineral traffic dominance, a passenger service was started on 9 July 1869, between Glasgow and Edinburgh. This route was considerably shorter than the Caledonian's former route between the cities, and not much inferior to the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway route, although the gradients of the Midcalder line were more challenging. Two stopping trains and two expresses ran each way daily, and the fares were set cheaper than the E&G; fares; the latter had to be reduced to compete. =The Balerno line= The Balerno railway of the Caledonian RailwayThe main line from Carstairs to Edinburgh ran in a direct line, and approaching Slateford the line ran parallel to, and some distance on the north side of, the Water of Leith. Considerable industrial development took place adjacent to the watercourse: there were three paper mills, two quarries, a salt works and a tannery on the proposed line. On 29 June 1865 the Caledonian obtained Parliamentary authorisation to build a double track railway, the Balerno Branch, from a junction near Slateford, serving the industrial sites. Authorised share capital was ¬£150,000, but when the Caledonian had raised most of the money, other priorities intruded and the cash was spent on other schemes for the time being. The original Act had specified a penalty of ¬£50 a day if the completion of the line was delayed, so in 1869 authorisation was sought to abandon the Balerno branch. The following year however the scheme was resurrected, this time as a cheaper, single track line, but continuing from Balerno to rejoin the Carstairs line at Ravelrig, forming a loop. The new Caledonian Railway (Additional Powers) Act was obtained on 20 June 1870. The line finally opened on 1 August 1874. Balerno had a goods station in the location earlier intended as the passenger terminus in 1865, on a stub from the loop line. There was a passing loop on the single line at Currie. Ravelrig was a complex junction, and there were two mineral lines serving nearby quarries. The stations generated considerable volumes of residential passenger traffic. The attractive area also generated worthwhile volumes of \\"picnic\\" traffic in the summer months, and special excursion trains were run. The extension from Balerno to Ravelrig did not have a regular service for extended periods, as was occasionally used for stabling the Royal Train when in the area.Gordon Stansfield, Lost Railways of the Lothians, Stenlake Publishing Limited, 2003, Nonetheless the considerable extent of residential housing encouraged an excellent bus service from the 1930s, and travel by train became unattractive: the line closed to passenger traffic in 1943, temporarily. It was intended to reopen the line after the War, but this was never done. The official closure date is sometimes given as 1 June 1949. Goods trains ceased running in 1967. =Strawfrank curve= When the Caledonian main line had been opened, a direct line was provided by-passing Carstairs for trains running from Carlisle to Edinburgh; it was from Float Junction to Lampits Junction. In fact all passenger trains called at Carstairs; Edinburgh portions were detached and attached there, and did not use the curve. It is likely that goods traffic ran via Carstairs station also. The Lampits line closed in 1860. On 10 October 1872 a new curve was opened, much closer to Carstairs station and much tighter; it was known as the Strawfrank curve. It is use today by most passenger trains between Edinburgh and Carlisle. =Later changes= After the first decades of the twentieth century, the extractive industries that had supported the heavy mineral traffic on these lines began to decline, and after 1950 collieries and the shale industries experienced a significant decline. In step with this, the importance of Leith and Granton harbours also declined. Street tramways and then motor buses made suburban passenger routes unattractive, and in rural areas too bus and lorry transport became more practical than the railway service. All of the local branches and many of the local stations closed, and in 1965 Princes Street station was closed, its main line traffic from Carstairs being transferred to Edinburgh Waverley over a connection near Haymarket that was a close relative of the 1853 connection. The only other remaining line in the area under consideration was the line from Glasgow via Cleland and Fauldhouse, usually thought of as the Shotts line, remained in operation although with an infrequent passenger service. A short connection was however built in 1961 at Slateford; at this point the line passed over the Edinburgh Suburban Railway and a spur was put in during 1961Col M H Cobb, The Railways of Great Britain -- A Historical Atlas, Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003, giving access for freight trains off the Carstairs and Shotts line towards the new marshalling yard being built at Millerhill. From about 1980 there was a revival of interest in passenger rail travel, and daily travel to work over longer distances became commonplace. This led to some reopening of stations, and the Shotts Line now serves Edinburgh commuters as well as the rural towns on its route. At present (2015) the Carstairs to Edinburgh route carries a significant long-distance passenger traffic to English destinations, as well as a medium distance semi- fast service between Edinburgh and Ayr via Glasgow. The Shotts line carries two trains an hour (typically) between Edinburgh and Glasgow, alternating stopping and semi-fast services.

It stars Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Plot In a town in the Old West, the girl beagle comes to a bank to make a deposit. The banker is none other than Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Momentarily a gun-slinging rotweiler also comes to the bank, and causes a frenzy, even shoving an umbrella down an old woman's throat. Oswald flees the bank with the girl beagle's money. Oswald leaves town on a horse, although he is being followed by the rotweiler who is also on a horse. The chase continues until they reach a cabin which Oswald enters. Unfortunately, the house is occupied by a thin dog who is an accomplice of the rotweiler. After the rotweiler breaks in, another frenzy ensues until the thin dog gets thrown out of the cabin. Nearby buzzards eat at the thin dog until that canine is nothing but a skeleton. Back in the cabin, Oswald is still having trouble with the rotweiler. To protect the girl beagle's cash, Oswald swallows the sack. The rotweiler punches Oswald. The punch sends Oswald bouncing off the walls until he knocks off a goat's skull that falls on and covers his head. Oswald uses the skull to bash the rotweiler around and out of the cabin before locking the door. The rotweiler tries to break back in using a log. But upon doing so, the rotweiler overshoots and falls into a canyon which is on the other side of the house. The rotweiler ends up in the bottom, getting pummeled by two jaguars. Oswald is seen just outside the cabin relaxed. He is momentarily greeted and approached by the girl beagle. When Oswald tries to kiss her, the girl beagle asks for her money. Oswald manages to pull out the sack through his mouth. The rabbit and his canine girlfriend go on with the kissing. Reused animation The part where Oswald bounces off the walls is reused from A Wet Knight. Other spellings In a Guild/Firelight Video reissue, the film is presented as Wild and Wooly. And in Michael Fitzgerald's book Universal Pictures, it is mentioned as Wild and Wooley.

Both current account and savings accounts can be operated by such banks. Payments banks can issue ATM cards or debit cards and provide online or mobile banking. Bharti Airtel set up India's first live payments bank. History On 23 September 2013, Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and Low Income Households, headed by Nachiket Mor, was formed by the RBI. On 7 January 2014, the Nachiket Mor committee submitted its final report. Among its various recommendations, it recommended the formation of a new category of bank called payments bank. On 17 July 2014, the RBI released the draft guidelines for payment banks, seeking comments for interested entities and the general public. On 27 November, RBI released the final guidelines for payment banks. In February 2015, RBI released the list of entities which had applied for a payments bank licence. There were 41 applicants. It was also announced that an external advisory committee (EAC) headed by Nachiket Mor would evaluate the licence applications. On 28 February 2015, during the presentation of the Budget it was announced that India Post will use its large network to run payments bank. The external advisory committee headed by Nachiket Mor submitted its findings on 6 July 2015. The applicant entities were examined for their financial track record and governance issues. On 19 August 2015, the Reserve Bank of India gave \\"in-principle\\" licences to eleven entities to launch payments banks. The \\"in-principle\\" license was valid for 18 months within which the entities must fulfil the requirements and they were not allowed to engage in banking activities within the period. The RBI will grant full licenses under Section 22 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, after it is satisfied that the conditions have been fulfilled. Regulations The minimum capital requirement is 100 crore. For the first five years, the stake of the promoter should remain at least 40%. Foreign share holding will be allowed in these banks as per the rules for FDI in private banks in India. The voting rights will be regulated by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The voting right of any shareholder is capped at 10%, which can be raised to 26% by Reserve Bank of India. Any acquisition of more than 5% will require approval of the RBI. The majority of the bank's board of directors should consist of independent directors, appointed according to RBI guidelines. The bank should be fully networked from the beginning. The bank can accept utility bills. It cannot form subsidiaries to undertake non-banking activities. Initially, the deposits will be capped at per customer, but it may be raised by the RBI based on the performance of the bank. Payment Banks are not be permitted to lend to any person including their directors. 25% of its branches must be in the unbanked rural area. The bank must use the term \\"payments bank\\" in its name to differentiate it from other types of bank. The banks will be licensed as payments banks under Section 22 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and will be registered as public limited company under the Companies Act, 2013.

Family His son Raees Ghulam Mustafa Khan Bhurgri, who was a member of the Sindh Assembly, was the greatest opponent of One Unit and voted against the bill during the Sindh assembly session in 1957 at Hyderabad, on 17 September 1957, a resolution was moved against unification of West Pakistan was by Ghulam Mustafa Bhurgri. Professional career After his return, he started a practice in Hyderabad (Sindh). Political career He was the first Sindhi Muslim barrister, who rose to the highest status of politician in the subcontinent as a Sindhi. Ghulam Mohammad Bhurgri was among the foremost Muslim leaders of Sindh whose activities had a significant impact on mainstream Indian politics. He was active at one time or another in several major political organisations. He was the first to clamor for compulsory free education and in this connection moved the 'Muslim Education Cess Bill' (to recover just one 'pie' per rupee for this purpose) in the then Bombay Legislative Assembly. This move was strenuously opposed and defeated by the Zamindars and other vested interests who feared the possible dangers of spreading education, especially amongst the Haris and landless -labourers. His relentless efforts brought in more grants to the local boards, besides more facilities to the cultivators and drastic improvements in the conditions of irrigation canals and roads. He also clamored for many other welfare causes and liberally helped the needy, especially poor litigants and students. He was elected as a member of the Bombay Legislative Council in 1909; he was re- elected in 1913 and again in 1916. He was a member of the Indian National Congress in 1917. In February 1920 he became President of the All India Khilafat Conference (1919‚Äì29). On 10 July 1919, G M Bhurgri accompanied the Jinnah leader of deputation for Khilafat to London. =Muslim League= He remained a dedicated member of the All India Muslim League all through his life and attended all its annual sessions. He was a member of the Reforms Committee (8th session, Bombay, December 1915-January 1916), a member of the Committee to Discuss Congress-League Scheme (10th session - Calcutta, December 1917- January 1918) and a member of the Committee of Moplah Trouble (14th session, Ahmedabad, December 1921). He was elected President of the All India Muslim League (15th session) at Lucknow in March‚ÄìApril 1923. In his presidential address, Bhurgri touched upon, among other things, the Turkish and Khilafat question and the possibility of a league of Oriental Nations. Bhurgri was a Muslim League delegate, under the leadership of Quaid-e-Azam, to give evidence before the Selbourne Committee of British Parliament on India Bill. =Role for Sindh= He championed the cause of separation of Sindh from Bombay Presidency with a view to safeguarding the interests of Sindhi Muslims. He with his friends came to the conclusion that the issue must be brought to all India political forums. All India National Congress had been made aware of the issue since 1913, and now All India Muslim League must also be asked to play its part. In December 1925, in its seventeenth session, the Muslim League passed the resolution that Sindh should be separated from Bombay and constituted into a separate province. Bhurgri continuously lobbied for a separate province, proposing resolutions at all-India moots, from 1925 onwards. He repeatedly urged the Aga Khan who led the Muslim delegation to the Round Table Conferences (1930‚Äì32) and Jinnah to get the Sindh separation issue settled favourably during the London confabulations. Sindh Provincial Political Conference (1920-30s) Azad Sindh Conference (1930) He started the Sindhi weekly Al-Amin from Hyderabad which was edited by Shaikh Abdul Majeed Sindhi. Bhurgri was an accomplished lawyer and defended Sheikh Abdul Majeed Sindhi against Government prosecution under press laws. As President of Muhammedan Educational Conference, Poona, he tried to expand educational facilities in rural areas Death He died on 10 March 1924 and was buried in his ancestral graveyard. In recognition of his services, the Sindh Government changed the name of the town and Taluka of Jamesabad to Kot Ghulam Muhammad Bhurgri.

History =1980s= Adem was one of the first thrash metal bands to emerge from Kyiv. They were pioneers of the style in Ukraine and former USSR in the middle of 1980s. Adem was formed in 1985 by founding members Yuriy Fedoretenko (guitar) and Viktor Lukianov (bass guitar), later joined by drummer Simon Rymar and second guitarist Volodymyr Stetsenko. At the end of 1986 the group‚Äôs line-up was changed - Yuriy Fedoretenko and Volodymyr Stetsenko were replaced by Ihor Shilin (guitars, vocals) and Vadym Virvalsky (second guitarist). In late 1980s Adem recorded two studio albums: \\"Time of Maddness\\" (1988) and \\"Golgotha\\" (1989) The band was well received on their first tour around Ukriaine and Russia in 1987. The next tour was to Rock Festival \\"Drama\\" in Gda≈Ñsk (Poland), it took place in 1989. In 1990 the group's line-up changed again. Ihor Shilin, Simon Rymar and Vadym Virvalsky left the band, and were replaced by Andriy Antonenko (guitars, vocals) and Yarik (drums). The new album \\"Fight Without Rules\\" was released in 1996. Adem stopped touring and recording sometime in 1997. In 2003 ex-drummer Simon Rymar collected and restored previously recorded albums \\"Times of Maddness\\" and \\"Golgotha\\" at the Backstage Studio (United States). The materials were used by Moon Records Studio Recording Company to release these two albums in Ukraine, in 2004. Their new album, \\"The Souls of Aggression\\" was released in 2005.

Then the band \\"changed the letter so that we wouldn't find a band with the same name again like it was the case with Darkness.\\" Nokturnal Mortum gained their first Western recognition with the release of their album Goat Horns, their second full-length album, notable for having two keyboardists play on the album, often on the same song, and for mixing traditional Ukrainian music with black metal. The band's first albums were released through The End Records and (as licence pressings) through Nuclear Blast,Aaron McKay: The Genesis of the End. CoC interviews Andreas Katsambas of The End Records. but the label and band separated after releasing the album Nechrist and a re-release of the Lunar Poetry demo due to a disagreement.

They owe us some money. That was enough for a conflict.\\" Band frontman Knjaz Varggoth is one of the foremost figures in Eastern European National Socialist Black Metal (NSBM) and has played in various NSBM bands, like Aryan Terrorism, Warhead and Temnozor. Nokturnal Mortum's albums \\"Weltanschauung\\" and the live album \\"Live in Katowice\\" were released by No Colours Records, a German label associated with NSBM. In an interview with Frostkamp, Varggoth said that the album \\"Weltanschauung\\" is influenced by Miguel Serrano, a former Chilean diplomat, holocaust denier and major figure in Esoteric Hitlerism.http://frostkamp.wordpress.com/2008/08/05/nokturnal-mortum- interview/ Soulrest appeared in 1996 in Uzhhorod, Ukraine. In the beginning, the band consisted of Doni (drums), Lemi (guitars, vocals) and Yasya (guitarist). They prepared their first demo, which contained compositions written mainly by Lemi. But after some discords, Lemi left the band. In the end of 1996 Dyma (keyboards) and Carcass (vocals) joined the band. In November 1996, this new staff recorded three albums: \\"Pathological Processes\\", \\"This is my Life\\", and \\"Perpetual Decay\\". In the beginning of 1997 Ihor, the second guitarist, entered the band, and 5 new songs were recorded with him in April, 1997. At the end of spring, 1997, Soulrest released the demo entitled \\"Pathological Processes\\", consisting of 8 compositions (40 min). Releasing the demo, Soulrest took part in many concerts and becomes the leading band in Transcarpathia. At the end of 1997, Carcass leaves the band, and Kasym becomes a new vocalist. With this staff, Soulrest had a concert in Slovakia on the Open Air festival. After a number concerts in Transcarpathia Kasym left the band and Soulrest continued to play without a vocalist. In 1999 Doni left the band and the new members of Soulrest became Laci (bass) and Tibi (drums).

Kroda is a black metal band formed in 2003 in Dnipropetrovsk. The band's primary lyrical themes are paganism, nature and history. Their sixth full-length album was released on May 1, 2015. The band was formed by two musicians, Eisenslav and Viterzgir, in March 2003. The name of the band was taken from the Old East Slavic language and means \\"The fire of burial bonfire\\". According to legend, when the bodies of the warriors burned, their souls were carried away with the smoke to the Heavenly Palaces of the Gods. The smoke was a kind of a guide to Rod.

It was formed in 2004 in Lviv, Ukraine. The music style of the band can be described as melodic gothic metal, with several songs referring to symphonic metal and doom metal. Having created their first material, in early 2005 they recorded a demo, which included four songs. In a couple of months \\"Polynove Pole\\" started to participate in concerts and rock festivals in Lviv and other cities. After the considerable changes in the cast at the beginning of 2007 their music changed in a way. It has become tangibly heavier, more melodic and closer to the formerly chosen gothic metal style. New members joined the band (among them ‚Äì the soloist of Lviv Philharmonic Marianna Laba). Since autumn of 2008 the musicians have got down to work on studio records, where they created their first official album \\"Pure Souls\\". The second official album On Seven Winds was released out in spring 2009, combining the best of the band from all the previous years. In December 2009 they released the album Under The Cold Stone.

He is best known for his role in the elucidation of the genetics of hereditary colorectal cancer and Lynch syndrome. Biography =Personal life and education= Albert de la Chapelle was born in 1933, one of three sons (along with Cla√´s-Henrik and Gustaf) of Cla√´s Carl Fredrik Ren√© de la Chapelle (1900-1974) and Stina Serlachius (1902-1984). He spent his early childhood on his parents' apple growing estate. He attended school locally, transferring later to high school in Helsinki. Graduating from high school in 1950 he enrolled directly into medical school at the University of Helsinki, obtaining his MD in 1957 after a hiatus to complete 11 months of military service resulting in the rank of lieutenant. He then worked on his PhD graduating from the University of Helsinki in 1962. He is board certified in internal medicine and clinical genetics in Finland. De la Chapelle was married to Clara D. Bloomfield =Career= De la Chapelle worked for two years in the biochemistry lab of Dr. Paul Marks at Columbia University, New York, 1966‚Äì1968; for a semester in the Blood Group Unit of Ruth Sanger and Rob Race at the University of London 1974, and a year in the molecular genetics lab of Dr. Jean-Claude Kaplan at the University of Paris 1981‚Äì82. He held Finland's first Chair in Medical Genetics at the University of Helsinki between 1974 and 1997, when he moved to Ohio State University with the aim of building a Human Cancer Genetics Program. He presently holds a chair in Human Cancer Genetics in the program which comprises greater than 20 faculty and greater than 200 total personnel. De la Chapelle was married to Dr. Clara D. Bloomfield, an expert on leukemia. =Contributions to science= Genetics of sex determination De la Chapelle was in clinical training in Endocrinology when a paper appeared in 1959 describing the loss of an X chromosome (45,X) in Turner's syndrome. He founded the first human cytogenetics laboratory in Finland and at first concentrated on the cytogenetics of Turner's syndrome. It turned out that in addition to 45,X, structural abnormalities of the single X chromosome were commonly involved, as well as mosaicism. Genotype/phenotype correlations were described. The resulting publication became de la Chapelle's first breakthrough publication and also his Ph.D. thesis on the cytogenetics in Turner syndrome; at that time it was the most extensive study in the field. The XX male syndrome Targeting abnormalities affecting sex determination de la Chapelle published the first example of a male with the karyotype XX. This was the first step towards the establishment of the XX male syndrome. It is now referred to by OMIM as 46,XX sex reversal 1, abbreviated SRXX1, OMIM #400045 (http://omim.org). Obviously XX males might provide valuable insight into sex determination genes and mechanisms that were unknown at the time. De la Chapelle worked with Finnish, French and US geneticists to solve the mystery of maleness without a Y. In the period between 1964 and 1990 he authored 45 peer-reviewed articles on the subject of sex determination. In the end it was detected (i) that the X and Y chromosomes share a tiny pseudoautosomal region that pairs and recombines in meiosis, (ii) that most XX males arise as a consequence of accidental unequal recombination in the paternal meiosis, transferring the male-determining region from the Y to the X). Soon after this had become known the male determining gene SRY was cloned (by others). de la Chapelle dysplasia In 1972 a rare novel recessively inherited lethal skeletal dysplasia characterized by extreme micromelia (short limbs) was described.de la Chapelle A, Maroteaux P, Havu N, Granroth G: Une rare dysplasie osseuse l√©thale de transmission recessive autosomique (A rare skeletal dysplasia with autosomal recessive inheritance). Arch Franc Pediat 29:759-770, 1972 The underlying mutation, homozygosity for pT512K in the SLC26A2 gene was later found to be responsible for the syndrome. The syndrome is called \\"de la Chapelle dysplasia\\" (DLCD; OMIM #256050). An alternative name is Atelosteogenesis type 2. Linkage mapping and positional cloning of disease-causing genes De la Chapelle decided to begin to clarify the genetic basis of some 30 disorders (mostly recessively inherited) that were known to be greatly over-represented in the Finnish population due to its founder nature, i.e. the present population derives from a small number of settlers without significant recent influx. The diseases are said to comprise the ‚ÄúFinnish Disease Heritage‚Äù. The de la Chapelle laboratory soon was transformed into a molecular genetics one working mainly with restriction fragment length polymorphisms as markers. Prominent use of the strong linkage disequilibrium patterns was an important tool. Disease after disease was mapped to critical genomic intervals. By positional cloning the culpable genes were identified based on the occurrence of pathogenic mutations. The number of diseases studied is approximately 24, including a few ‚Äúnon-Finnish‚Äù disorders such as Peutz‚ÄìJeghers syndrome, and a few in which the de la Chapelle group precision mapped the region but the gene was found by others. These extensive findings were published between approximately 1987 (Choroideremia, a ‚ÄúFinnish‚Äù disorder), and 2011 (MOPD1 disease in the Ohio Amish). The genetic basis of Lynch Syndrome Dr. Henry Lynch's name is attached to a condition, Lynch Syndrome (formerly Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer, HNPCC), characterized by a greatly increased risk of colorectal and endometrial cancer, plus a moderately increased risk of ~7 other cancers. In 1992 collaborations between Finnish, US, New Zealand and Canadian researchers had led to the study of 2 exceptionally large families favorable for linkage analysis. Genotyping these in Helsinki led to a breakthrough; convincing linkage was found to a locus on chromosome 2p which was subsequently shown to harbor the MSH2 gene. This for the first time proved that Lynch syndrome exists as a Mendelian disorder. In addition, tumors from these families were shown to display greatly reduced DNA repair, nowadays referred to and measured as microsatellite instability (MSI) or mismatch repair deficiency. This paper was the first of 3 early descriptions of microsatellite instability, representing a major breakthrough with translational consequences. In addition it established the link between microsatellite instability and the hereditary form of colorectal cancer. In 2015, two decades later, Dr. de la Chapelle co- authored a paper describing dramatic results of therapy with anti-PD-1 antibodies in patients with microsatellite unstable tumors. The mapping of MSH2 and the detection of MSI led to an avalanche of research targeting the presumptive human homologs of already known yeast mismatch repair genes. In the end, 4 mismatch repair genes were cloned and shown to cause Lynch syndrome, MSH2 (2p), MLH1 (3p); MSH6 (2p) and PMS2 (7p). Dr. de la Chapelle's group contributed to the cloning and characterization of these genes. The unraveling of Lynch syndrome has had and will have important implications because morbidity and mortality can be substantially reduced in mutation- positive individuals through clinical surveillance and interventions. It is estimated that some 30,000 new cases of LS would be detected each year in the US provided all at-risk family members of affected individuals were screened for the proband's mutation. Such screening is increasingly practiced in numerous institutions and hospitals around the globe. Genes predisposing to thyroid cancer Beginning in 1997 a main component of de la Chapelle's research has centered on detecting and annotating gene mutations that predispose to thyroid cancer, TC. Relying on ample experience from work with the Finnish Disease Heritage (see above) the de la Chapelle laboratory has used linkage and linkage disequilibrium analysis in search of genes with high penetrance. For genes with low penetrance, genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) has been carried out. Presently some 10 high-penetrance genes and some 15 low-penetrance variants have been found and annotated. It is becoming increasingly clear that many predisposing genes of high penetrance exist, but each is rare or ultra-rare. Instead, single nucleotide polymorphisms and other variants of low penetrance account for most of the genetically determined risk. Ongoing research in the de la Chapelle lab aims at elucidating the functional aspects of the detected genes or variants. Ultimately, when up and downstream pathways are established, this information will inform research attempting to create drugs to treat TC. Moreover, the low-penetrance variants‚Äô effects are additive, allowing the extent of genetic risk of TC to be predicted in individuals under study for TC. The de la Chapelle lab belongs to a large and active Thyroid Cancer Program at The Ohio State University. The clinical arm of the group is essential in providing crucial material for the laboratory experiments at hand. Moreover, with an active group of genetic counselors at OSU the acquisition and characterization of families with more than one member affected by TC is efficient and useful for genetic studies. Gender in sports De la Chapelle is one of the first scientists who rose to oppose the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) handling of the issue of gender verification in sports. In the 1960s there was negative publicity regarding certain athletes competing as females. Their appearance was said to be masculine and it was hypothesized that they were males masquerading as females. The IOC adopted a ‚Äúgender verification‚Äù procedure that relied on typing female athletes for sex chromatin, a simple procedure. It was obvious that some women would test ‚Äúnegative‚Äù for X chromatin even though they have no masculine traits at all. This group of women comprises individuals with the androgen insensitivity syndrome whose karyotype is 46,XY but whose anatomy is normal, and other conditions. They would \\"fail\\" the sex chromatin test and would not be allowed to compete as females. The IOC was unwilling to admit this mistake, which was unmasked in a landmark paper by de la Chapelle.de la Chapelle A: The use and misuse of sex chromatin screening for \\"gender identification\\" of female athletes. JAMA 256:1920-1923,1986. Also published in Italian (JAMA 11:942-946, 1986), French (JAMA 12:191-195, 1987) and Japanese (JAMA 6:85-88, 1987) Soon other scientists joined forces and after years of public and closed door argumentation the IOC finally abandoned the sex chromatin (and later SRY gene) testing. The issue of women with a masculine appearance (and muscle strength) due to congenital abnormalities of sex hormone metabolism requires detailed study of those rare individuals who are affected and who compete in sports. =Other activities= De la Chapelle has many interests beyond genetics. He grew up with hunting and fishing and his devotion to nature continues. Skeet-shooting became more than a hobby; he represented Finland in World Cups and other shooting competitions. His best result was a bronze medal in a European Championship. He has edited and co- authored three books that describe the history and sociology of three locations in which he has lived. Den lilla boken om Kalby describes his summer house in Tenala, Finland, located about 1 km from his childhood home. In Patricierhuset vid skv√§ren the property at Bulevarden 10 in downtown Helsinki is described in great detail. De la Chapelle lived there between approximately 1941 and 1963. 8060 Olentangy River Road, Delaware, Ohio 43015 describes a property in Delaware County, Ohio on the outskirts of Columbus.

The single-span covered bridge structure was built by Henry Wolf in 1863 and dismantled in 1923-25. History =Construction= Very little recorded history remains for this bridge. According to an early account, though, the bridge may have been the second bridge at this location, the first being of an open design. According to legend, in 1863, a group of young people set out from Bloomingdale in a wagon to visit Turkey Run. While crossing the bridge it collapsed and sent the horses, wagon, and the young people into the water, which because of the nearby mill dam, was around six to seven feet deep. The horse team was unable to be saved but all of the passengers were. However, the truth of this story is unknown because records of the earlier open bridge and its covered bridge replacement have not been found in the Parke County Commissioners' records. Even information on the mill is very limited. There is a photograph of a bicyclist at the Roaring Creek Covered Bridge, from 1912, showing the bridge had squared off portals in the style of Henry Wolf, indicating that he could have been the builder. The bridge also appears to be around 40 to 60 feet in length. =Destruction= The bridge was dismantled and removed sometime between 1923 and 1925 when the new US 41 was constructed. The mill dam is even still visible from the US 41 bridge.

He is the author of Sweetness and Blood (2010), about the history of surfing, and The Desert and the Sea (2018), a memoir about his captivity in Somalia. Moore graduated from University of California, San Diego in 1991 with a degree in German Literature. He lives in Berlin and also holds German citizenship. In January 2012, he was abducted in Galkayo, Somalia while researching a book about piracy. Moore was held captive for over two and a half years, and released September 22, 2014. Abduction Moore (right) with fellow hostage Rolly Tambara at a reunion in Seychelles in 2018 Moore traveled to Somalia on a grant from the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting to research a book on piracy. He was abducted by a local gang of pirates in January 2012 in the town of Galkayo. Several days later, two aid workers, Jessica Buchanan and Poul Thisted, also being held by Somali pirates, were rescued by a Navy SEAL operation. The gang holding Moore subsequently demanded $20 million. American officials and the German Foreign Ministry collaborated on negotiations with the pirates, until Moore was freed September 22, 2014. It took 977 days for Moore to be released by the pirates after 1.6 million dollars was paid. Career Moore has published three books, including the novel Too Much of Nothing, published by Carroll & Graf, and the nonfiction history of surfing Sweetness and Blood: How Surfing Spread from Hawaii and California to the Rest of the World, with Some Unexpected Results, published by Rodale in 2010. Sweetness and Blood was named a Best Book of 2010 by The Economist and PopMatters. The Desert and the Sea became a Nielsen besteller in August 2018, shortly after its publication on July 24, 2018. Moore worked as the theater columnist for SF Weekly, until he moved to Berlin, Germany in 2005. In Germany he worked as both a staff and a freelance editor for Spiegel Online International. In 2010-11 he covered a trial of ten Somali pirates in Hamburg who were charged with trying to hijack the MV Taipan. His journalism has been published in The Atlantic Monthly, The New Republic, and the Los Angeles Times. From 2009-2012 he also wrote a weekly column for Miller-McCune (now Pacific Standard) on trans-Atlantic issues, including the NATO effort against Somali pirates. In 2009, for the column, he sailed on the Turkish frigate Gediz which had been charged with catching pirates in the Gulf of Aden.

The old channel of the Sava can be seen in the southern part of the village, where the river flowed before it was regulated during construction of the Austrian Southern Railway. The soil is sandy and fertile. The A1 Freeway runs directly east of the old village center. Name The name ≈†entjakob ob Savi literally means 'Saint James on the Sava River'. The name ≈†entjakob is a compound of Slovene ≈°ent 'saint' and Jakob 'James', after whom the church in the village is named. History Folk tradition says that a castle stood on the hill above the hamlet of Soteska and was destroyed by the Ottomans, but no trace of the structure remains today. ≈†entjakob ob Savi was a ferry point across the Sava River until 1584, when a bridge was built to serve the postal connection between Graz and Venice. The postal route was relocated via Kamnik in 1717 because of frequent flooding of the Sava. A part-time school was established in ≈†entjakob ob Savi in 1788, and regular schooling started in 1869. School was held in the sexton's house until 1903, when a schoolhouse was built. Before the Second World War, weaving straw was a traditional economic activity in the village, where they also produced tote bags made of straw.

For a number of years Ruben competed on the PKRA freestyle world tour with a second position overall in 2005 as his best ranking. Ruben was one of the first riders to try radical high-powered moves in gale force conditions, easily jumping over 15 m high.

(see photo link below) In recent years Ruben has moved away from the competition scene and focused on other projects like producing kiteboarding movies and creating and organizing new kiteboarding concepts and events like the LEN10 Megaloop challenge. Ruben was instrumental in developing a new competition format that caters more to the public, featuring an easy to follow scoring system and higher and more spectacular jumps.

About 70% of its business is from the sale of jewelry and gold bullion, and the company also manufactures dental alloys and industrial gold. Zlatarna Celje's retail stores are mainly located in Slovenia and the countries of the former Yugoslavia. Today, the company markets its products under the Zlatarna Celje and Lencia brand names, the latter of which has developed a collection line with Tina Maze, a Slovenian skier. It has also invested in the construction of the Plaza hotel BTC City (Ljubljana).  History  Giuseppe (Johanna) Pacchiaf, an Italian goldsmith opened a 100-employee workshop in Gaberje, Celje in 1921 with two brothers, Alojz and Ivan Knez. Following the World War II, the new government confiscated half the company's shares from the Pacchiaf's heir. Not long after, the government nationalized the shares of Ivan Knez as well. In 1963 the company was under the management of Municipal People Committee's (MLO) Celje and continued to operate as a craft enterprise, only to be transformed into the Zlatarna Celje industrial company. Over time the company became one of the most important companies in this sector and in this part of Europe; exporting products to Europe, North America, Australia and Asia. In 1974 the company reached a million dollars of annual exports. After the independence of Slovenia, Zlatarna Celje was in financial distress, mostly due to the loss of Yugoslav markets, but also because of inefficiency and poor marketing. In 1997 the company was bankrupt, but before it had to shut down the business, it was rescued by Aurodent, a subsidiary. In 1999 it was taken over by the Albreht family through the AL Company, which provided capital for the brand's successful relaunch. Bojan Albreht owns a 55% controlling interest in the corporation and is the Chairman of the Board. Following the company's business review in 2011, the World Gold Council association added Zlatarna Celje to its list of trustworthy gold traders.

Early life, education, and training Judith Helen Chazin, born in New York City, spent her childhood in Jamaica, Queens, where her father, Maurice Chazin, was chair of the Department of Romance Languages at Queens College. Her mother, Mary (Berry) Chazin, was a former high-school English teacher.\\"Bennahum, Judith Chazin,\\" in Contemporary Authors (Farmington Hills, Mich.: Thomson Gale, 2004). http://media.server.amazon.com. Retrieved 25 February 2015. She began her dance training at age eight, studying tap and ballet with a local teacher, and quickly developed a passion for ballet. When she was ten, she persuaded her mother to take her into Manhattan and enroll her in classes at the Fokine Ballet School, in the upper-floor studios in Carnegie Hall. There she studied with Frank Lester and was observed with interest by Vitale Fokine, son of Michel Fokine and Vera Fokina. Both Lester and Fokine recommended that she audition for entrance into the High School of Performing Arts, which she did, successfully, when she was twelve years old. There, Chazin studied ballet and modern dance with Lucas Hoving, Bella Malinka, Doris Rudko, Robert Joffrey, who was her principal ballet teacher, and, in her senior year, Benjamin Harkarvy. Selma Jeanne Cohen was her instructor in dance history. During her school years, she and other students performed at various venues in New York City, and in July 1953, when she was sixteen, she went to the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Massachusetts, to dance with the Robert Joffrey Ballet Company in his Scaramouche and Umpateedle. When she finished high school, her father insisted that she go to college rather than pursue a career in dance. Upon application, she received a full scholarship to Brandeis University, near Boston, and spent the next four years there as a theater arts major, with an emphasis on dance. Upon her graduation with a bachelor of arts degree, magna cum laude, in 1958, she determined to make a career as a dancer.Curriculum vitae Judith Chazin-Bennahum, supplement, 2015, in personnel files of the Department of Theatre and Dance, University of New Mexico. A principal source of information on her dance career, used by permission of the subject. Dance career Soon after she graduated from Brandeis in June 1958, Chazin auditioned for Agnes de Mille and was hired for the dancing ensemble of Goldilocks, a Broadway show starring Don Ameche, Elaine Stritch, and Russell Nype. Rehearsals began in July, and the show opened on 11 October 1958. For the next few months, until February 1959, Chazin appeared in eight shows a week, dancing in seven lively dance scenes devised by de Mille to the music of Leroy Anderson. The following summer she returned to Jacob's Pillow as a member of the Pearl Lang Dance Theater, appearing in Lang's Persephone, with Lang in the title role, Dirk Sanders as Hermes, and Deborah Jowitt as Demeter.Program notes for Pearl Lang Dance Theater, June‚ÄìJuly 1959, in the Jacob's Pillow Archives, Becket, Massachusetts. During her stint on Broadway and in the months thereafter, she continued to take ballet classes from Robert Joffrey, hoping to join his company. In one of his classes, she met Nancy King, a member of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet Company, who told her of auditions then being held at the opera house. Chazin attended an audition in the summer of 1959 and was hired as a member of the corps de ballet. For the next several years, Chazin danced in many operas on the Metropolitan stage and continued her classes with Antony Tudor, Alfredo Corvino, and Margaret Craske in the Met's ballet school. Tudor was then head of the school faculty; Corvino was ballet master of the company as well as a teacher at the school. Both he and Craske were specialists in the Cecchetti method of teaching. Under their tutelage, Chazin was soon appointed principal soloist and was given featured roles in many Met productions, dancing the ballets of various choreographers. Tudor's dances for Gluck's Alceste, Monteverdi's Orfeo, and Wagner's TannhƒÅuser were particular favorites. She was often partnered by such leading dancers as Thomas Andrew, Donald Mahler, Howard Sayette, Ron Sequoio, and Vincent Warren, but she sometimes danced solo, as in Cilea's Adrianna Lecouvreur, choreographed by Alexandra Danilova.Program notes for Metropolitan Opera performances, 1959-1962, in the Metropolitan Opera Archives, New York City. During the summers, when the Met was dark, Chazin went to New Mexico, to dance in productions at the Santa Fe Opera. There she met Vera Zorina, who encouraged her to audition for George Balanchine, artistic director of New York City Ballet. Upon returning to New York, Chazin danced for Balanchine and was invited to join his company. After she started working with him, in 1961, she began to experience foot problems, but she worked through the pain and continued dancing. In the fall of 1961, right after the Berlin Wall was erected, she went to Europe with the Santa Fe Opera company and danced on stages in Berlin and Belgrade. The following summer, in 1962, she returned once more to Jacob's Pillow with Thomas Andrew and Company and danced in his Invitations and Images in Five, with guest artists Nathalie Krassovska and Igor Youskevitch.Program notes for Thomas Andrew and Company, July 1962, in Jacob's Pillow Archives, Becket, Massachusetts. Upon rejoining New York City Ballet that fall, however, she found that her foot problems had worsened, and she was unable to go on the company's historic tour of Russia in October 1962. She then returned to the Met ballet company, where choreographic requirements for pointe work were less demanding than at New York City Ballet. Her next move was to Geneva, Switzerland, to be near her fianc√©, David Bennahum, who was a medical student there. During her Swiss sojourn, in 1963, she took classes for a short time with Valodia Skouratoff, a former Ballets Russes dancer, before returning to America with her new husband and a new surname, hyphenated as Chazin-Bennahum. Academic career In New York City, Chazin- Bennahum pursued her interest in French literature at Columbia University but did not take a degree. When her husband, a physician, was ready to complete his training, they decided to move to New Mexico, where, as she has noted, \\"the sun shines and the sky is blue.\\"Curriculum vitae, Judith Chazin-Bennahum, supplement, 2015. There, at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, she earned a master's degree in French literature in 1971 and a doctoral degree in Romance languages in 1981. She had discovered the topic of her doctoral dissertation when her mentor, Selma Jeanne Cohen, referred her to French dance historian Marie-Fran√ßoise Christout, who suggested that she focus on ballet at the time of the French Revolution (1789-1799). So began a kind of love affair for her with that period of French history. Her Ph.D. dissertation,\\"Livrets of Ballet and Pantomime in Paris during the French Revolution,\\" eventually formed the core of her first book, Dance in the Shadow of the Guillotine (1988). =Teaching and university appointments= When a friend became head of dance in the Department of Theatre and Dance at the University of New Mexico, Chazin-Bennahum was asked to teach ballet technique classes, then a dance history class, and then a number of different seminars in dance. She also learned to teach French Baroque dance forms, 1650-1800, as she continued her interest in early dance. She soon rose from adjunct professor of dance to full-time faculty membership, eventually establishing courses in ballet repertoire, dance criticism, dance appreciation, performance theory, and introduction to graduate studies. In dance history, she created courses at four levels: graduate studies in contemporary dance, feminism, postmodern theory, and African-American dance in performance. In 1987-1988, Chazin- Bennahum served as head of the dance program in the Department of Theatre and Dance, a post in which she served again in 1991-1993. In 1993, she was promoted to full professor of theater and dance, a title she bore until her retirement.

A principal source of information on her academic career, used by permission of the subject. =Extracurricular activities= During the 1980s, Chazin-Bennahum worked as choreographer and movement coach in local community theaters, including the Opera Studio of the University of New Mexico and the SouthWest Ballet Company, directed by Edward Ambrose. In 1998, she went to Italy to begin the first of three full summer seasons (1998-2000) as choreographer in residence at the Opera Academy of Rome, where performances were given in the Basilica of San Clemente. In 2006, she organized and produced a symposium in Albuquerque on \\"Crosscurrents in the Indigenous Arts,\\" featuring the Dineh Tah Navajo Dancers, Ballet Folkl√≥rico de M√©xico, the Bernalillo Matachines Dance Company, and presentations by Carlo Bonfiglioli, Sylvia Rodriguez, and other scholars. At the national level, Chazin-Bennahum has served as an evaluator of proposals for the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Scholar Program, and the Comparative and International Education Society. She has also served the Society of Dance History Scholars in various capacities: as president, as a member of the board of directors, as chair of the editorial board, and as program director of an annual conference. She has chaired the dance panel of the New Mexico Endowment for the Arts and has served on the advisory boards of Dance Chronicle, the foremost scholarly journal of dance history, and the Council of Researchers of Pedagogical Studies in Ballet (CORPS de Ballet) International, an organization devoted to the development and advancement of ballet in higher education. She has been an active member of the American Dance Guild, the American Society for Theater Research, the Congress on Research in Dance, the Dance Critics Association, the Society of Dance Research in London, and the Association Europ√©enne des Historiens de la Danse in Paris. In the course of her academic career, Chazin-Bennahum has presented papers at many meetings of scholarly organizations and has delivered lectures at numerous institutions in North America, Europe, and Asia. Among American colleges and universities that have invited her to lecture are Barnard College, Dartmouth College, Goucher College, Harvard University, the Juilliard School, the North Carolina School of the Arts, Ohio State University, Skidmore College, and Temple University. Beyond the borders of the United States, she has lectured at universities in Canada, England, France, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, and Norway. Writing Throughout her academic career, writing about dance in France occupied much of Chazin-Bennahum's time and attention. She did not, however, abandon her interest in and admiration for the ballets of Antony Tudor (1908-1987), her former teacher at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School. He was known as the \\"father of psychological ballet,\\" and Chazin-Bennahum felt a special affinity for his work. During a visit with him in New York, she expressed interest in writing about his ballets. With his permission and his blessing, she applied for and received grants to study his works and choreographic approach. Her research in London, Stockholm, Paris, Copenhagen, Oslo, and New York led to publication of her second book, The Ballets of Antony Tudor: Studies in Psyche and Satire (1994). She subsequently devoted her research and writing skills to a study of French fashion magazines and ballet costume in the period 1780-1830, to a reference book article on French dance theorist Jean-Georges Noverre, and to a book- length biography of Ren√© Blum, one of the founders of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo.Curriculum vitae Judith Chazin-Bennahum (2014). Ren√© Blum (1878-1942), born into a prosperous Jewish family in Paris, was the younger brother of L√©on Blum (1872-1950), a lawyer, literary critic, and three-time prime minister of France. He was a winner of the Croix de Guerre in World War I, becoming a national hero, and a prominent litt√©rateur on the French cultural scene as well as an influential theatrical impresario. In the early years of World War II, in December 1941, he was among the first Jews arrested by the French police. He was confined to concentration camps and was put to death by the Nazis at Auschwitz in September 1942. Chazin-Bennahum's biography, Ren√© Blum and the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo: In Search of a Lost Life (2011), thus deals not only with the world of ballet but necessarily with the festering political situation in Europe in the 1930s and in wartime France. Upon publication, it received favorable notices in the French press as well as in the United States. The Blum family was so pleased with it that they wrote to the mayor of Paris and requested that a street be named in his honor, like those that are named for his elder brother. Their request was granted in 2014. Accordingly, a street near where he lived will, in September 2015, be officially designated rue Ren√©-Blum.Personal communication from Laurent Hyafil, great-nephew of Renƒó Blum, on behalf of the Family of L√©on and Ren√© Blum, to Judith Chazin-Bennahum, January 2015; used with her permission.

It started shipping on March 19. The D7200 was superseded by the Nikon D7500, announced on April 12, 2017. Features Image zoom 1:1 quality test The D7200 is equipped with features intended for semi-professional use (two SD card slots, the availability of a battery grip, and metering support for old manual focus Nikon AI type (Non- CPU) lensesNikon D7500 Ken Rockwell), which have been removed from the D7500. Being the successor of the Nikon D7100 it has (among other things) the following enhancements:Nikon D7200 Review: Digital Photography Review * An improved buffer size that at its highest frame rate (6 frames per second) can store eighteen raw images (entire APS-C frame recorded, 14-bit lossless compressed), whereas the D7100 can store six images. * The optical CMOS sensor has been exchanged to a different model, which (unlike the D7100's) is not prone to generating faint striped patterns (banding noise) in night photography with strongly amplified dark tones (a scenario typical for Astrophotography). * Sensor-related image quality measures have been determined to lead the APS-C camera class (as of April 2015) * All 51 autofocus (AF) sensors have an improved performance at very low light scenes, with the effect of its light sensitivity being one exposure value better (-3 EV) than the D7100 (-2 EV). -3 EV allows for autofocusing in outdoor scenes only lit by the full Moon, or equivalently dark artificial light or candle light scenes. * The electronic processor has been updated, (EXPEED 4 replaced EXPEED 3). * Power consumption has been lowered, so that a battery charge lasts for typical 1110 exposures, which is 160 more than the D7100 under the same conditions. * Wi-Fi is now built-in, as is NFC, offering simpler smartphone connectivity. * The layout of the shoulder display has been simplified. Its overall size is the same as before, but some secondary information has been removed in favor for tidiness and for important items to appear bigger. * The back screen's visual interface has been changed slightly. * A new picture processing mode (called \\"Flat Picture Control\\"), which does not change the original tone reproduction curve, has been adopted from higher- end models. This is to benefit RAW and JPEG photographers and videographers, who prefer to see histograms and preview images with high tone fidelity during shooting of scenes with a high dynamic range, and prefer to postpone any tonal adjustments to later post-processing. * The maximum video quality mode (1080 lines/60 frames per second at a frame size reduced by the factor 1.3) has been improved to be non-interlaced (60p), where the D7100 was interlaced (60i). Otherwise, it has also been described as \\"by no means a radical upgrade\\" compared to its predecessor, \\"yet it still adds some important features\\". The camera body shape has been left unchanged, in particular the deeper-grip update of other latest models such as the D5500 hasn't been adopted for the D7200.

It is a dense, bushy shrub to about with numerous slender, arching branches and oblong heads of mauve flower spikes in spring and sparsely throughout the year. Description Melaleuca gibbosa is a medium- sized shrub, about tall and wide with egg-shaped leaves which are about long and wide. The leaves are sessile and arranged in crowded, alternating, opposite pairs along the stem (decussate). The flowers are mauve, in dense, cylindrical spikes about long, containing up to about ten pairs of flowers. The stamens are conspicuous, long and arranged in five bundles around each flower, each with between 5 and 25 stamens. Flowers appear mainly in November to December but often appear at other times of the year. The fruit are woody capsules, about across but wider at the base where they become embedded in the woody stem. The seeds are retained in the capsules until the plant, or that part of it, dies. Flowers of M. gibbosa. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca gibbosa was first formally described in 1806 by the French biologist, Jacques Labillardi√®re in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. The specific epithet (gibbosa) from the Latin gibbosus, meaning \\"gibbous\\" or more swollen in one place than another, referring to the sunken fruits making the stems appear lumpy. Distribution and habitat Slender honey-myrtle occurs along the coasts of South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania as well as on Kangaroo Island and Flinders Island. It grows in heath in swampy areas and in scrub from sea level to approximately . It grows vigorously in exposed positions such as Cape Bruny at the southern tip of Bruny Island and Hurricane Heath on the Tasman Peninsula. Ecology This species of melaleuca provides food for some species of caterpillar, including those of the tactile tuft-moth, Aquita tactalis (Walker, 1863). Uses In cultivation, M. gibbosa is a very hardy plant, suited to most soils and aspects. It is drought hardy, frost tolerant and tolerates waterlogging. It can be propagated easily from seed collected from capsules one or two years old, or from semi-hard wood cuttings.

Prior to white settlement, a grassy woodland surrounding what is now called Bendigo Creek. At that time the creek was little more than a chain of pools and billabongs. This area would have been an important source of food and water for the indigenous Dja Dja Wrung people living in dry central Victoria. In the 1850s gold was discovered in the area, radically transforming the area that is now Rosalind Park. Bendigo was one of the richest gold mining regions in the world, with more gold found in the region from 1850 to 1900 than anywhere else in the world. At present it remains the seventh richest goldfield in the world. Puddling mills, shafts and piles of mine wastes and cast offs dominated the landscape. In 1852 the area was officially designated a Government Camp precinct, the bounds of which still roughly designate the park today. The Government Camp area comprised 66 acres and contained police barracks, gaol and lock-up, a courthouse (which is still in use), a gold office and other government buildings, offices and quarters. In 1856 the local Gold Commissioner, Joseph Panton, first suggested that the camp should be turned into a park, but it was not until 1861 that 59 acres were formally reserved for the park and handed over to the Sandhurst Borough Council (now the City of Greater Bendigo). The first park gardener was appointed in 1870 and established the basic layout of Rosalind Park which remains to this day. Overview The park is effectively bounded by View Street, Pall Mall, Bridge Street, Park Road and Barnard Street, but shares some of this space with the Queen Elizabeth Oval, Bendigo Senior Secondary College, Courthouse, former Bendigo Post Office (now a tourist information centre), Camp Hill Primary School and old Bendigo Jail, which is now Ulumburra Theatre. The Rosalind Park area is of historic significance as the site of one of the largest government camps in the Victorian goldfields as well as a significant example of a late nineteenth century public park. The area is of archaeological significance given its past importance in the Bendigo goldfields as well as architectural and botanic features. The cast iron conservatory within the grounds of the parks is only surviving example of a nineteenth century conservatory in a public park in Victoria. Rosalind Park contains a number of notable trees and plants, some listed on heritage registers in their own right. Of note are the Bunya-Bunya Pine, Hoop Pine, South African Yellowwood, River Red Gums, Canary Island Pines, Cedar, California Bay (also known as the headache tree and the only example in Victoria), a Crows Ash (one of three in Victoria), Queensland Kauri along with a number elm and oak species. Of particular interest to some is the Chilean Wine Palm, now rare in Chile, which thrives despite the climate being less than ideal for this plant. Conservatory Gardens Prior to being turned into a park this area was used as a rubbish tip. This garden now comprises an ornate cast iron fence as well as some notable exotic palms (Washington Fan Palm) which were planted in the late 1800s. The garden contains the ornate cast iron conservatory well as a range of statuary. Right is shown The conservatory was erected in 1897. This garden area is used to showcase a range of floral exhibitions throughout the year, both in the garden beds and within the conservatory. \\"Man Fighting Wild Animals\\" Presented by Mayor Harkness, 1899 Venus (1901). Presented to the Citizens of Bendigo by W M Hunter 1901 Creek area View of Bendigo Creek as it runs through Rosalind Park In the early days of settlement the Bendigo Creek was the only practical source of water and soon became completely inadequate to service the growing population. The Bendigo Creek as it appears today is a direct result of a \\"competition\\" held in 1862 to find a way to transport water from the Coliban River to the goldfields, this \\"artificial creek\\" was completed in 1877. This constructed system is still in use today, though Bendigo is no longer dependent on it as its sole source of water. The portion of the Bendigo Creek that flows through the Rosalind Park precinct reached its current form in the late 1800s and is bridged by three cast iron bridges installed in 1882. The creek itself is lined with hand laid flagstone and sandstone and is capped with granite. It represents a significant example of the infrastructure and craftsmanship of the time. Fernery The fernery was initially proposed in 1879 and is notable as being the last remaining fernery from this era on public land. It was constructed by filling in the existing billabong, however some of the larger trees, typically River Red Gums, where preserved to provide a shelting canopy for the ferns that are planted below. Poppet head lookout Poppet head lookout The lookout, situated at the top of Camp Hill, was originally a poppet head from the Garden Gully United mine (one of Bendigo's richest mines) and was installed in its current location in 1931. During goldrush times, prior to the poppet head's installation, a flag was flown at the top of Camp Hill to signal that the mail had arrived in town. At this time Camp Hill was completely denuded of trees and the flag could effectively be seen from across the town. At the foot of the poppet head lookout is the Bendigo Heritage Mosaic which was completed in 1987 and designed by mosaic artist Maery Gabriel. The installation work was completed by local volunteers. The mosaic depicts various aspects of the town's history and is designed to be viewed while looking down from the lookout. Cascades Typical in nineteenth-century gardens were water features, and in 1880 the \\"Cascades\\" were constructed. Designed by notable local architect William Vahland after being advised by George Lansell after he returned from a European trip. The cascades originally featured statues and fountains that may have been operating around the 1880s. It is thought that the cascades were not reliable due to the available pumps' technology being inadequate, but the historic record is not clear on this matter, and they fell into disrepair in the early nineteenth century. The cascades were effectively buried until they were partially restored in 1997. Queen Victoria Gardens Located opposite the Alexandra Fountain the Queen Victoria Gardens are especially notable for the inclusion of an imposing statue of Queen Victoria (1903) as well as bust of Sir John Quick (1934), one of the \\"fathers of federation\\". There are also a number of notable plants and garden features in the area. The inscription reads \\"Victoria\\" \\"Queen of Earthly Queens\\" \\"1837-1901\\" \\"Erected by the Citizens of Bendigo\\" Lansell Gardens Statue of George Lansell, the 'Quartz King', holding a piece of quartz in his hand. This small garden contains an imposing statue of George Lansell with a large piece of quartz held in his hand. This statue is shown right: the inscription at the base reads \\"In appreciation of the indomitable courage and persistent enterprise of George Lansell in the development of Bendigo's gold resources. This memorial was erected by the citizens of Bendigo. 1823 ‚Äì 1906\\". Lansell was one of the most famous and successful miners in the Bendigo region. Future development In 2014 the City of Greater Bendigo Council unveiled plans to create a revitalised park space that draws in Rosalind Park, the Queen Elizabeth Oval, the Tom Flood Velodrome, the Chinese precinct and other spaces into a single integrated multi-use park area. Work on this new vision of the park is yet to commence and still the subject of community discussion.

(B) Dependence of Tm1 and Tm2 on the pH of the buffer of all tested conditions. nanoDSF is a modified differential scanning fluorimetry method to determine protein stability employing intrinsic tryptophan or tyrosin fluorescence. Protein stability is typically addressed by thermal or chemical unfolding experiments. In thermal unfolding experiments, a linear temperature ramp is applied to unfold proteins, whereas chemical unfolding experiments use chemical denaturants in increasing concentrations. The thermal stability of a protein is typically described by the 'melting temperature' or 'Tm', at which 50% of the protein population is unfolded, corresponding to the midpoint of the transition from folded to unfolded. In contrast to conventional DSF methods, nanoDSF uses tryptophan or tyrosin fluorescence to monitor protein unfolding. Both the fluorescence intensity and the fluorescence maximum strongly depends on the close surroundings of the tryptophan. Therefore, the ratio of the fluorescence intensities at 350 nm and 330 nm is suitable to detect any changes in protein structure, for example due to protein unfolding. Its applications include antibody engineering, membrane protein research, quality control and formulation development. nanoDSF has also been utilized to rapidly evaluate the melting points of enzyme libraries for biotechnological applications.

Biography He was the elder son of George Macartney, son of the last of the Macartneys of Blacket in Scotland, who had settled at Belfast in 1630; his mother Martha was of the same family as Sir John Davies. His younger brother Isaac served as High Sheriff of Antrim and was the father of William Macartney MP.Sir Bernard Burke, A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain and Ireland (1863) vol. II, p. 926. Macartney entered the Army during the reign of William III, and served with much credit under the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene. After the War of the Spanish Succession began, he was appointed Colonel of a new regiment, McCartney's Regiment of Foot, which initially served under Marlborough in Flanders before being sent to Spain in 1706. He was wounded at the Battle of Almanza, where the regiment suffered heavy casualties and after returning to the Low Countries in 1709, was promoted Major-general.Richard Cannon, Historical Record of the Sixth Regiment of Dragoon Guards, or the Carabineers (1839) p. 96. His regiment fought at the siege of Douai in 1710, after which he became Lieutenant-General. Lord Mohun; McCartney's involvement in the Hamilton‚ÄìMohun Duel led to his exile in 1712. In 1712, Macartney acted as second to Lord Mohun, in the Hamilton‚ÄìMohun Duel where both parties were killed. Like Mohun, Macartney was a Whig and was accused by his Tory opponents of stabbing Hamilton while the duellists were rolling on the ground. It was then common practice for seconds to join the fight and both MacCartney and the unrelated Colonel Hamilton were arrested; McCartney escaped to Hanover, where he remained until 1714, when he returned with George I. Soon after this, he demanded to be tried for the offence which had been laid to his charge, and on the evidence of the keepers of Hyde Park, who had witnessed the duel throughout all its phases, was honourably acquitted. His former regiment having been disbanded at the peace of Utrecht, he was appointed to the colonelcy of the Royal North British Fusiliers on 12 July 1716,Cannon, Historical Record of the Twenty-First Regiment, or the Royal North British Fusiliers (1849) p. 56. from which he was removed on 9 March 1727 to the Carabiniers, and he retained this appointment until his decease on 7 July 1730. He was at the time of his death commander-in-chief of the forces in Ireland and governor of Portsmouth. He married the widow of General Douglas, and by her had issue.

The double span Burr Arch covered bridge structure was built by Joseph J. Daniels in 1866 and destroyed by arson in 1910. This was the second bridge at this location. History =Construction= The Parke County Commissioners ordered an engineering plan for the Roseville Covered Bridge from Joseph J. Daniels on September 7, 1865. Requests for bids were placed with the bids being open on October 4, 1865. J. J. Daniels was awarded the contract for $15,000 and the bridge was completed the following September, 1866. The bridge was built the same year as the Harrison Covered Bridge. =Destruction= By 1910 Roseville was entering a new period of prosperity. With a sand plant northwest of the bridge and numerous coal mines in full production. The steep hillside on the west side of Big Raccoon Creek was lined with hotels, saloons, and stores, all hastily built in boomtown style. With the first floors of the buildings set against the hillside, and built on stilt like pilings, long flights of stairs were required to reach the first floor from the road. Even the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad was running four passenger trains and 16 freight or coal trains through Roseville every day. Saturday, April 9, 1910, would turn out to be a bad day for Roseville and two young men. After arriving at the glass sand plant, near the bridge, in a surly mood, the younger of the two would be arsonist argued with the foreman and was fired. The older of the two, 25, walked off the job with him. From there they visited the local \\"blind tiger\\" to drink. Around 11pm that evening the night watchman at the glass sand plant discovered a fire on the roof. With the help of several others they were able to put the fire out. That's when they found an oil soaked rag had been thrown on the roof to start the fire. After midnight, when the men that had helped fight the fire started home, they found that the bridge was on fire but was too far gone already to save it. There had been some tracks allegedly left by the arsonists but because of the pairs attitude at the fire attention was focused on them. Because the Parke County Sheriff wasn't available one of the counties deputies started an investigation. He deputized another man and had Blake Gloss drive them from Rockville to Roseville. Acting on reports on the younger man, he was soon arrested. When they checked the home of the older man they didn't find him. Following another report that he was walking toward Rosedale the deputy started that way. The older arsonist changed his mind though and turned back toward home. While walking past the bridge ruins he was recognized and the assistant deputy started chasing him. The arsonist ran down the railroad tracks but was caught. They were both moved to Rockville sometime after noon on Sunday and placed in the Parke County Jail. On Monday they confessed and a few weeks later they were sentenced to 2-21 year terms at the State Reformatory at Jeffersonville. It would seem though that the two men were unrepentant of their crime. While waiting in the Rockville jail they composed a ballad describing their adventure. Only the first stanza though is remembered: \\"We first set fire to the sand plant. And went on up the ridge. And it didn't prove successful. So we went and burned the bridge.\\" The Roseville Covered Bridge was the only bridge in Parke County that had fire insurance, but, by the time of the fire, it had long expired.

The death of Alberto Nisman, an Argentine lawyer who specialized in international terrorism, became known in the early hours of Monday, January 19, 2015. He was found shot in the head in his apartment in the Torre del Parque building in the upscale Le Parc Puerto Madero development in the neighborhood of Puerto Madero in Buenos Aires. In September 2017, the National Gendarmerie issued a report concluding that Nisman had been murdered.¬´Para Gendarmer√≠a, el fiscal Alberto Nisman fue \\"asesinado\\"¬ª, published 20 September 2017 El D√≠a (Buenos Aires). Background Natalio Alberto Nisman had been the special prosecutor in charge of the 1994 AMIA bombing investigation since 13 September 2004. The case had been marked by judicial misconduct, and had reached an impasse. The 2013 signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with Iran to facilitate the investigation led to a breach between Nisman and President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Nisman alleged that the signing of the memorandum with Iran was part of an effort to cover-up alleged Iranian complicity in the AMIA bombing in exchange for improved trade relations. The accusation was based on Nisman's belief that the administration had petitioned Interpol to lift Red Notices against numerous Iranian officials during the negotiations. The Secretary General of Interpol at the time, Ronald Noble, said on 15 January 2015 that no such requests had been made, and that Foreign Minister H√©ctor Timerman had stated on each occasion the case was discussed that Interpol should keep the red notices effective, and that \\"Prosecutor Nisman's assertion is false.\\" Nisman's body was found 19 January. The discovery of the body came hours before the prosecutor was to present his complaint to the Criminal Law Committee of the Chamber of Deputies;¬´El fiscal Alberto Nisman ir√° al Congreso para informar sobre la imputaci√≥n a Cristina Kirchner y Timerman¬ª, 20.1.2015 La Naci√≥n (Buenos Aires).¬´Qui√©n era el fiscal Nisman¬ª, 19.1.2015 La Naci√≥n (Buenos Aires)¬´C√≥mo son las torres Le Parc y el departamento donde muri√≥ Nisman¬ª, 19.1.2015 La Naci√≥n (Buenos Aires). Nisman had already submitted his complaint and wiretap transcripts to Judge Ariel Lijo on 14 January. The Nisman death is under investigation by Federal Judge Emma Palmaghini and Special Prosecutor Viviana Fein. It is unknown if the death was a suicide, a forced suicide, or a murder. Federal Judge Daniel Rafecas dismissed the Nisman complaint, which had been resubmitted to the courts by Federal Prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita, on 26 February. Judge Rafecas held in his ruling that \\"none of the two hypotheses of a crime put forward by prosecutor Pollicita in his writ stand up to the minimum level of scrutiny\\". Pollicita did not succeed Nisman as chief AMIA prosecutor; this office was headed as of 13 February by a prosecution task force led by coordinator Juan Murray.  Complaint  In a complaint issued on Tuesday January 13, 2015, Nisman accused President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, Minister of Foreign Relations H√©ctor Timerman, deputy Andr√©s Larroque and the piqueteros Luis D'Elia and Fernando Esteche of concealment. According to Nisman, they had guaranteed impunity of Iran with the memorandum to unblock relations with this country and impute some called \\"local fascists\\". The complaint was based on eavesdropping on an alleged Iranian spy who spoke on different occasions to D'Elia, Esteche, and Larroque, and on Nisman's stated belief that the administration had petitioned Interpol to lift Red Notices against numerous Iranian officials during said negotiations. The Secretary General of Interpol at the time, Ronald Noble, noted on 15 January 2015 however that no such requests had been made, and that ‚Äúon each occasion that [Foreign Minister H√©ctor Timerman] and I spoke about the Interpol red notices issued in connection to the AMIA case, [Timerman] stated that Interpol should keep the red notices effective.‚Äù Noble added on 18 January that \\"Prosecutor Nisman's assertion is false.\\" Nisman claimed that Cristina Fernandez had ordered an agent of the \\"SIDE\\" (Secretariat of Intelligence) she trusts or Andr√©s Larroque, and both delivered that to Esteche or to D'Elia. D'Elia communicated to the alleged Iranian agent Alejandro Yussuf Khalil, who telephoned Mohsen Rabbani (one of the parties accused of the 1994 bombing). According to Nisman, the reasons for the orders were intended to overcome \\"the Argentina energy crisis through an exchange of [Iranian] oil with [Argentine] grains\\" and \\"even sell arms [to Iran]\\". Nisman claimed that to finalize the memorandum, the condition that Interpol red notices against several officials of Iran be rescinded was included, an assertion discredited by Interpol director Ronald Noble.Wikileaks claims that \\"Wikileaks cables also revealed that the U.S. Embassy in Argentina had given Nisman direct orders not to investigate any local connections to the AMIA bombing as well as any Syrian links to same and that he was instead to assume guilt on the part of the Iranian suspects in the case regardless of evidence.\\", but cable actually said \\"Legatt officers have for the past two years recommended to Nisman that he focus on the perpetrators of the terrorist attack and not on the possible mishandling of the first investigation.\\"https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08BUENOSAIRES717_a.html  Death  Woman with a sign \\"We are all Nisman\\" in a march in Buenos Aires the day after his death. Demonstration one year after his death. Nisman was found next to a Bersa gun, .22 caliber, in his 13th-floor apartment in the Torre del Parque building within the upscale Le Parc Puerto Madero development located in Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires. At 3 a.m. on Monday, 19 January 2015, after Nisman's mother failed, to open the bathroom door, a locksmith managed to open a service door which was locked from inside. When they managed to get inside, Nisman's body was found lifeless on the floor, along with a pistol and a cap bullet.¬´Deceso del Dr. Nisman¬ª, art√≠culo en el sitio web del Ministerio de Seguridad (Buenos Aires). According to the autopsy, Nisman died the previous afternoon and had an entry bullet wound on the right parietal (temple) of his head, two inches above the ear; the bullet remained inside the head with no exit wound. His body was found inside the bathroom and blocking the door, and there were no signs of forced entry or robbery in the apartment. The paraffin test did not reveal any gunshot residue on Nisman's hands, suggesting that he may not have fired the gun himself. The results of such a test, however, may not be conclusive, as the gun involved is of small caliber and may leave no trace. His body did not have signs of physical attack, and Prosecutor Fein commented that there were no items suggesting the presence of other people at the crime scene. Fein announced on 9 February, however, that DNA from a second person was found on a coffee cup in the kitchen sink. Nisman had made numerous cryptic comments shortly before his death, including a WhatsApp message that said \\"I'm better than ever and sooner than later the truth will prevail\\". The gun found did not belong to Nisman. It was registered in the name of an employee of the prosecutor, computer repair technician Diego Lagomarsino. Lagomarsino was a frequent guest at the Nisman residence, and is the last person known to have seen him alive. He last visited Nisman at around 8 p.m. on the day of Nisman's death, and according to Le Parc security records, stayed there as late as 12:54 a.m. While the .22 caliber weapon that fired the fatal shot belonged to Lagomarsino, he could not explain how no fingerprints of his were present on the weapon, as would be expected. He claimed to have brought it to the apartment upon request, because Nisman distrusted his own custody. Accordingly, Nisman's 10-man security detail were not at home watching when Nisman died. Lagomarsino earned an unusually large salary as Nisman's personal computer technician (40,000 pesos a month during 2014; US$5,000 at the time). He was asked in a 5 February press conference if he had a homosexual relationship with Nisman as well as a professional one, which he denied. Senator Salvador Cabral stated on 25 February that he had proof to that effect, and was subpoenaed by prosecutor Fein to provide an affidavit. Senior Secretariat of Intelligence officer Antonio \\"Jaime\\" Stiusso, who conducted many of the wiretaps ordered by Nisman, had been dismissed in a December 2014 agency shakeup and had persuaded Nisman to dismiss his 10-man security detail days before his death. Stiusso presented himself on 18 February for questioning by Special Prosecutor Fein after initially evading the subpoenas. Facing unrelated charges of smuggling, he reportedly fled the country for neighboring Uruguay a week later in a black pickup registered to one of the companies allegedly involved in the smuggling operation. Nisman's death caused an international stir and appeared in many news media worldwide. The death generated more than a million tweets. The prosecutor in the case said: \\"There are no witnesses, and no neighbors who could provide data on what happened\\". It remains unknown if the death was a suicide, a forced suicide, or a murder. Following his death there were massive protests across the country demanding justice and uncovering the cause of death. The official report released in 2017, concluded that Nisman was murdered which contradicts previous government claims that he committed suicide. It states he was assaulted by two people, beaten and shot.https://www.algemeiner.com/2017/10/02/official-report-death-of-argentine- prosecutor-in-1994-buenos-aires-jewish-center-bombing-case-was-result-of- murder-not-suicide/  18-F  On the 18 February 2015, there was a silent demonstration, convened by the Attorney congregation and federal attorney, in various cities in Argentina and abroad, in order to commemorate the death of Nisman a month earlier. An estimated 400,000 marched in silence in Buenos Aires in torrential rains to honour and mark his death.

The group combined no wave and proto-punk musical influences with frontwoman Cynthia Genser's feminist poetry.  History  = Formation in Seattle = New York City native and lyricist Cynthia Genser (n√©e Kraman) had experienced the evolution of the early punk rock scene with bands like the Ramones, Patti Smith and Television. When Genser relocated to Seattle in the mid-1970s she connected with the city's blooming punk rock underground to recruit musicians for her own project Chinas Comidas (itself a Mexican slang expression meaning \\"Chinese food\\").Clark Humphrey: Loser: The Real Seattle Music Story. Updated and revised 2nd edition, MISCmedia, Seattle, 1999, p. 36. The first line-up consisted of members of fellow Seattle art-punk groups Red Dress and The Tupperwares, including drummer Eldon \\"El Duce\\" Hoke (who would soon leave Chinas Comidas to focus on his own shock rock outfit the Mentors).Chinas Comidas at Seattle's Georgetown Records By 1978, a stable line-up consisting of Genser, Red Dress guitarist Richard Riggins, bassist Dag Midtskog, keyboard player Mark Wheaton and his brother Brock Wheaton on drums had been established. Chinas Comidas performances were highly influenced by Patti Smith and alternated between the band playing the Clash and Television influenced songs and Genser's recitals of radical feminist and highly political poetry. This concept often provoked resistance from the more traditional punk rock crowd, and staged violence would often occur during shows, even including brawls with members of other punk rock groups. The band shared the stage with other early Seattle underground acts like the Telepaths (and their follow-up band The Blackouts), the Tupperwares (who were later renamed to The Screamers and moved to San Francisco), the Beakers, and the aforementioned Red Dress. Touring bands for which Chinas Comidas played as the opening act included D.O.A., Black Flag and Ultravox. In addition to band shows, Genser also did solo poetry readings and shared the stage with fellow Seattle beat poet Steven Jesse Bernstein.Fallout From the Past Makes Its Way to Ballard, and Chinas Comidas Get Their Due. Article by Hannah Levin in Seattle Weekly, July 10, 2007. = Relocation to Los Angeles = In 1978, Chinas Comidas released their first EP entitled Peasant/Slave on their own label Exquisite Corpse Records. The record helped garner attention to the band and was followed by the 7\\" single Snap (Portrait of a Fan) the following year. Like other ambitious Seattle bands (including among others the Blackouts and the Tupperwares), Chinas Comidas were frustrated by the limited potential of the city's late seventies independent music scene. After planning to open for the Dead Kennedys on selected dates (only one of which, in Philadelphia, actually took place) the group decided to relocate to Los Angeles. The Chinas Comidas singles had received very positive reviews in the L.A.-based Slash punk rock fanzine, and the editor had invited the band to come there and possibly help getting more songs recorded.Article by Dennis White on Chinas Comidas on jivetimerecords.com, September 4, 2018 Chinas Comidas played venues like the Whisky A Go-Go and shared bills with Fear, Germs, Redd Kross and other classic West Coast punk rock and hardcore punk groups. The band was well-received by music critics as well as fellow musicians such as Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore who stated: \\"Chinas Comidas were the real deal. Exciting, intriguing and intoxicating‚Äù. However, no record contract could be secured - a tentative signing to Slash Records reportedly didn't come to fruition as the label had just signed The Go-Go's and didn't have enough capacity to promote both bands - and in 1980 Chinas Comidas disbanded. = Post-breakup = After Chinas Comidas broke up, Genser and Riggins returned to New York and Seattle respectively while the remaining band members stayed in Los Angeles, collaborating among others with fellow Seattle expatriate Johanna Went.Clark Humphrey: Loser: The Real Seattle Music Story.

He was described by NBC News as \\"a leader of a South Korean group that has maintained friendly ties with North Korean groups\\". =Arrest= Ro was arrested in July 2012 after he returned from an unauthorized visit to North Korea, via the Joint Security Area (JSA) in Panmunjom, where he called for the reunification of the two Koreas and bitterly criticized President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea for his hard-line North Korea policy. At the JSA, he was sent off by a large group of North Korean civilians waving the flag of reunified Korea and carrying bouquets of flowers. Associated Press film footage of the vent showed Ro's approach to the border-line while a large group of South Korean security officials, South Korean Army personnel assigned to the Joint Security Area (JSA) and military policemen already awaiting his crossing in preparation for his arrest. As he set foot back in South Korea, he was immediately seized and carried away (he had struggled against his captors), while the by-now furious North Koreans behind the border hurled insults at and fiercely protested the action. No North Korean border guards present intervened. He had entered North Korea via China in March for a memorial service marking the 100th day since the death of ruler Kim Jong-il. In February 2013, he was sentenced to four years in prison, and the Seoul Central District Court also ordered that his rights, such as suffrage, be stripped for three years after his release from prison.

Though she never set foot in Canada,Parkman, Francis. Count Frontenac And New France Under Louis XIV. Boston: Little, Brown, 1877. p. 12. La Grange played an important role in the development of the colony as Frontenac's ambassador in the court of Louis XIV.W. J. Eccles, \\"Buade, Louis de, Comte de Frontenac et de Pallau,‚Äù in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 1, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003‚Äì, accessed February 26, 2015 __TOC__  Early life and courtship  Anne was the daughter of La Grange-Trianon, Sieur de Neufville and lived under the care of a relative in the Quai des C√©lestins neighborhood of Paris, close to the family of Louis de Buade de Frontenac. While little is known about her childhood, at some point during 1648, La Grange and Frontenac met and fell in love at the ages of 16 and 28, respectively. It does not appear that it was a relationship of purely romantic attraction, however. Frontenac was a career soldier from minor nobility who occupied a privileged position within the court and Anne was in line to inherit a sizable fortune from the estate of her deceased mother. La Grange, described as possessing a great beauty and wit, desired an opportunity to live a courtly life. Frontenac was in chronic debt. Married, the couple could provide one another with a path to the opportunities they both craved. More immediately, La Grange and Frontenac both possessed a notably impetuous nature which led to the couple's marriage against the wishes and without the knowledge of La Grange's family in the church of St. Pierre aux Boeufs on October 28 of that year.Colby, Charles W. The Fighting Governor: A Chronicle of Frontenac. Toronto: Glasgow, Brook & Company, 1915.Parkman, p. 6 De Neufville, unaware of the marriage, arranged for Anne to be sent to a convent as a measure to separate the young couple. He strongly disproved of the financially insolvent Frontenac as an inappropriate match for his daughter and her inheritance. When De Neufville found out about the secret wedding in April 1649, he was outraged, disowning his daughter and vowing to remarry so he could produce a new heir to his estate.  Later life  The first intense period of romance, however, was short lived. La Grange had a \\"restless craving for excitement\\" which put her at odds with Frontenac's equally strong personality. She gave birth to a son, Francois-Louis in May 1651, but shortly afterwards parted company with Frontenac due to their difficulties cohabiting.William John Eccles, ‚ÄúFrontenac and New France, 1672‚Äì1698‚Äù (Ph.Dd diss., McGill University, 1955) p. 43.Parkman, p.7 In the aftermath of these events, La Grange entered the entourage of Madame Montpensier for a time, the granddaughter of Henry IV famous for her role in the Fronde. La Grange enjoyed the favor of Montpensier for a time, following her through her exile and partaking of notable events such as breaking into the city of Orl√©ans with a group of boatmen. However, as with Frontenac, La Grange's energetic nature soon became at odds with her benefactor. Mademoiselle Montpensier began to suspect that La Grange was plotting against her and her family, and banished her from her private court. La Grange moved back in with Frontenac in a townhouse, and the pair began a campaign of petty annoyance when La Grange failed to enter back into Montpensier's favor. Attempts on her part to get the couple banned from the royal court failed, and they went out of their way to harass Montpensier whenever they could.Eccles, \\"Frontenac and New France\\", p. 44Parkman, p. 10 Meanwhile, La Grange and Frontenac were accruing massive amounts of debt through extravagant living. By 1664 they had accumulated 325,878 livres in debt, plus interest to creditors.Eccles, \\"Frontenac and New France\\", p. 23 In 1672, still deep in debt, Frontenac was appointed the Governor General of New France. This allowed him to escape the seizure of his property, but rumors abounded that he took the post to escape La Grange, who did not follow him to the colony. Despite the distance, La Grange and Frontenac benefited each other more during his terms as governor than at any other time. Frontenac's salary was paid directly to La Grange, and La Grange was a strong advocate for her husband at court.Parkman, p. 13Eccles, \\"Buade, Louis de\\"Eccles, \\"Frontenac and New France\\", p. 470 Frontenac very carefully built his legend by sending his diaries and accounts of his exploits to La Grange who would circulate them among the influential people in the French court. Around the same time as Frontenac's appointment as governor in 1672, Francois-Louis had died in battle in Germany leaving the couple without an heir. Frontenac himself died in 1698. Anne de La Grange lived until 1707, dying on January 20 of that year.

History These snapshots of WA Club history up to the 1980s are extracted from Caroline de Mori‚Äôs, A club for all seasons : a history of the Western Australian Club (Inc). The Western Australian Club began, in 1893, as a gentlemen‚Äôs club. The Club was a Limited Company with capital of, \\"Five hundred pounds divided into 500 Shares of ¬£1 each.\\" The original Memorandum of Association included the Club purpose: \\"For the purpose of establishing a Club of a non political character for the accommodation and mutual benefit and privilege of the members of the Company and to provide a Club house and other accommodation and convenience for the use of the members of the Company and to furnish and maintain the same and to permit the same to be used by the members of the Company.\\" By 1894 there were 310 members, drawn from the rich and powerful of Western Australia. The gentlemen‚Äôs club ethos was well established: \\"Members puffed imported cigars, drank the finest wines and spirits and ate the best food from fine bone china set down on crisp white linen cloths, sparkling with sterling silver cutlery. It was a haven for kindred spirits, a place to rub shoulders with the colony‚Äôs leading men free from the distraction of women, rowdy children and demanding workers. A strict code of conduct ensured that bad language, insulting behaviour, drunkenness and other unacceptable acts were quickly dealt with by the club‚Äôs committee.\\" The gentlemen‚Äôs club continued into the 1950s. Membership continued to include many names which are familiar from the business, development, politics and history of Western Australia. The financial fortunes of the club also tended to rise and fall with the fortunes of the state. By the 1960s the state itself was changing. There was rapid economic growth in non-traditional areas. This growth brought new people to the state. The club, perhaps because it included accommodation for members, kept its existing members but had difficulty attracting new members: \\"While there is no evidence that the club was actually formed to meet the needs of pastoralists and graziers visiting Perth from the far reaches the State, the club has until recent years drawn its membership largely from the rural districts... They found warm and comfortable accommodation, good food, cards, billiards and a well-stocked bar. More importantly they found companionship.\\" The economic growth of the state also brought increased competition for club services. In order to survive and grow, the club made changes to its role, its rules and its services. In the mid 1970s, \\"members expected the best services and facilities yet were critical of the efforts of management and the Committee to deal with finances in difficult times.\\" There was a financial crisis, yet the club survived. By the 1980s the Western Australian Club was no longer strictly a \\"gentlemen‚Äôs club\\". Women were full members. Pastoralist and country members were less than one fifth of membership. Despite the changes, many traditional aspects of the club were maintained. In 1988 the club president wrote, \\"The goal of the club must always be to provide an atmosphere in which [men and women]* of integrity, ability and capacity can find relaxation and mental stimulation from mixing with their peers with ultimate benefit to the whole community.\\" * The actual reference was to ‚Äúmen‚Äù. As in the general community, language equality trailed after intentions. Since then the club has refined its role, changed it premises and maintained its tradition of providing both relaxation and mental stimulation for members. Premises have been fitted-out to suit the club role, \\"[to be] Western Australia‚Äôs pre-eminent club for leaders and achievers from all walks of life.\\" There are regular events with meals and expert speakers. There are rooms available for meetings. Or members may simply relax in familiar and comfortable surroundings. = Membership = Original members of the club included Sir John Forrest and his brother Alexander.

He was best known for his lithographic children's books, his contemporaries include Jan Lewitt, George Him, Hans Tisdall and Barnett Freedman. Early life Jack Townend was born on 30 March 1918 in Bingley, Yorkshire. He attended the local grammar school, obtaining a school certificate, and in 1936 enrolled in the Bradford College of Arts and Crafts, graduating in 1938. At 20, Townend moved first to Hampstead, London, and then to Watford. He studied at the Slade School of Art ‚Äì under the direction of Randolph Schwabe. With the outbreak of war, Schwabe oversaw the evacuation of the Slade to the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art, University of Oxford. He collaborated with his friend Albert Rutherston, the Ruskin Master of Drawing, to combine the two schools for the duration of the war...Clark, Gill. Randolphe Schwabe.Samson & Company, 2012 Townend moved to Oxford in 1940 for the final year of his diploma, living at 70 Walton Street and remaining in the city for the next 50 years. Among his Slade contemporaries were landscape painter Kyffin Williams, Picasso scholar John Richardson, interior designer and antiques dealer Geoffrey Bennison, and artist Milein Cosman. Townend graduated with a Diploma in Fine Art in June 1941, and won two first prize awards of ¬£3 for engraving and lithography,[Pearson, Joe. Drawn Direct to the Plate. Penguin Collector's Society, 2010] possibly while studying under illustrator Harold Jones. Publications During the war, Townend wrote and illustrated books for the London publishing house Faber and Faber. The first, A Railway ABC, was released in 1942 and was printed at Gilmour & Dean in Glasgow. It was later published in the US by Franklin Watts as Railroad ABC, with different colour illustrations by Denison Budd[Powers, Alan. Children's Book Covers. Mitchell Beazley, 2003] In 1944, Townend published two more books with Faber and Faber: Jenny the Jeep a tale of a bullied, pink army jeep who saves the day and becomes a war hero; Ben a love story about a hardworking lonely steam roller who falls for Matilda, another steam roller. In 1945, A Story about Ducks was released; a group of ducks go on a series of adventures only to realise there is no place like home. These three books were published lithographically at the Baynard Press in London, during a period of ink and paper rationing.[Artmonsky,Ruth. The Pleasures of Printing. Artmonsky Arts, 2012] Around this time the press was also printing books by artists such as Enid Marx and Leslie Wood. In 1947, Townend produced one of his most celebrated books: The Clothes We Wear, number 64 in the Puffin Picture Book series.[Baines, Phil. Puffin by Design. Penguin-Allen Lane, 2010] It was described by Joe Pearson in Drawn Direct to Plate (2010) as being ‚Äúthe only title‚Ä¶to offer a modernist cover‚Ä¶one of the most striking of the series with Freedmanesque lettering.‚Äù This was also printed at the Baynard Press. Through the 1950s and 1960s, it is believed that Townend only illustrated a handful of books: Charles Dickens‚Äô David Copperfield for Oxford University Press, Eric Baxter‚Äôs The Study Book of Water Supply for the Bodley Head, Evan Owen‚Äôs What Happened Today: An Almanack of History, and in 1971, Alan James‚Äô book Buses and Coaches. His children's books form part of the Renier Collection of Children's Literature in the Victoria and Albert Museum‚Äôs National Art Library, which includes over 100,000 children‚Äôs books.[Eastment, Mark. 'Jack Townend: Lost Master'. Illustration, Spring 2014] Previously out of print, A Railway ABC, Jenny the Jeep, Ben and A Story about Ducks were reprinted by V&A; Publishing, London, in 2014 and 2015. Teaching, appointments and awards Very little is known about Townend‚Äôs war work, although his Oxford Slade records show that he was an Acting Pilot Officer on probation. It is unknown how long this lasted, nor why the post seems to have finished before the war ended. Townend‚Äôs name is included, however, on the Slade-Ruskin‚Äôs assistant staff list for the academic year 1942‚Äì43, and in 1944‚Äì45, he stayed on as a wood-engraving tutor. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1946. This honour is granted to those who have demonstrated significant achievements in the arts. In 1949‚Äì51, he was employed by the Ruskin School of Art to teach lithography composition, design and wood- engraving. He tutored, among others, author and illustrator Shirley Hughes. In A Life Drawing: Recollections of an Illustrator (2002), Hughes recalls a lithography class taught one day a week by Townend. A ‚Äúdapper, bearded and bow-tied figure with a high falsetto voice‚Ä¶[He was] a strict, critical and humorous teacher. He took the work we did seriously and he taught me a lot.‚Äù She credits Townend as being responsible for her career in book illustration Between 1952 and 1961 Townend taught graphic design, lithography and printmaking at the Ruskin, where Enid Marx is also listed as a teacher for the 1952‚Äì53 academic year. During the 1950s and 1960s, he taught at the New College and Greycotes schools, and later acted as an art advisor for the Oxford City Council. In the 1990s, Townend left Oxford and returned to his hometown, Bingley. He settled in a house just around the corner from where he was raised. He died on 15 May 2005, soon after his 87th birthday.

Her practice combines performance, film, photo, and site-specific installation using textile, light, and sound. Kimsooja's work investigates questions concerning the conditions of humanity, while engaging issues of aesthetics, culture, politics, and the environment. Her principle of ‚Äònon-doing‚Äô and ‚Äònon-making,‚Äô which follows a conceptual and structural investigation of performance through modes of mobility and immobility, inverts the notion of the artist as the predominant actor. Kimsooja's recent major projects include Sowing into Painting, Wanas Konst, Sweden, Travers√©es\\\\Kimsooja, Poitiers, France (2019-2020), To Breathe, Public Commission for the new metro station Mairie de Saint-Ouen in Paris (2020), 21st century new stained-glass commission for the Saint-Etienne Cathedral in Metz, France (2021), Asia Society Triennial, New York (2020).

Kimsooja represented Korea for the 55th Venice Biennale Korean Pavilion (2013), and for the 24th S√£o Paulo Biennale (1998), participated in Kassel Documenta 14: ANTIDORON ‚Äì The EMST Collection (2017), and has taken part in international biennials and triennials: Busan (2016, 2002), Venice (2019, 2013, 2007, 2005, 2001, 1999), Gwangju (2012, 2002,1995), Moscow(2009), Istanbul (1997), Lyon(2002), and Manifesta 1 (1996) among others. Name After having to pick a domain name for her website, Kimsooja thought about the conceptual implications of combining her name into one word. She commemorated this act in a conceptual piece titled A One-Word Name Is An Anarchist's Name (2003). Kimsooja links this project along with sharing the importance of her name and describes this action as, \\"A one word name refuses gender identity, marital status, socio-political or cultural and geographical identity by not separating the family name and the first name...\\" Early career Kimsooja was born in Daegu, South Korea, in 1957. She studied Western painting at the Hongik University in Seoul and her origin as a painter was a crucial starting point for the development of her art.Arum Sok, Christina, Kimsooja: A Modern Day Global Nomad Transcending boundaries, re- constructing a global identity 2014, paper Abstract, in Kimsooja's official website: http://www.kimsooja.com/texts/sok_2014.html While in University, she discovered her love for understanding the connection of aesthetics and human psychology which lead to the motive behind many of her works. Kimsooja references, from her first work to her most recent, how humans react to fabric, paint, sculpture and more, and how we experience the world as humans. Kimsooja's \\"Sewing\\" series (1983‚Äì1992), her first work with fabric, brought forth an assemblage of fabric forming cruciform structures that synthesized an entangled and knotted vision of the world into a system of horizontals and verticals.Suh Young‚Äìhee, Contemplating a System of Horizontals and Verticals, Vancouver Art Museum, 2013. Like the Spatialist painter Lucio Fontana, who pierced the uni-colored canvas with a sharped-edged dagger, Kimsooja also made art that was no longer a screen of illusion but a three-dimensional structure as she weaved through the surface of the work, piercing holes into it. These early sewn works, in turn, were inspired by the fabric and clothes that her grandmother had owned, while also fueled by Kimmsoja's own interest in the traditional association between female labour and needlework in Korean culture. Subsequent to a residency at MoMA PS1 in 1992‚Äì93, Kimsooja initiated a series of site-specific installations that found their origin in the Korean color spectrum (obangsaek).Mello Laetitia, The Pilgrimage of Our Own Existence, Arte Al Limite, Published by Arte Al Limite, March 2012. Pp.30-38 She created sculptures inspired from Korean bedcover cloth bundles that are associated in Korean culture with travel and migration, and may also be interpreted in her work as an allusion to restrictions on female activities.Yilmaz Dziewior, Cities on the Move, exhibition catalogue, Art- Worlds in Dialogue: From Gauguin to the Global Present, Museum Ludwig Cologne, 2000. These bedcover bundles inspired the title of a number of sculptures and installation works that Kimsooja titled after the Korean word, bottari, that intimates the idea of travel but also refers to concepts of wrapping and unfolding. In 1992, the installation Deductive Objects, shown at MoMA PS1, took up an entire brick wall where small torn pieces of used Korean bedcover fabric were inserted by the artist in tiny holes between the bricks. The sculptural elements alongside the wall installation were composed of everyday objects wrapped in Bottari cloth, such as a carrier, a doorframe, a hook, a saw, a spool, a shovel, a clothing rack, or a ladder. While any kind of fabric can be used to make bottari, Kimsooja favours second-hand clothes to allude to the passage of time and the objects‚Äô previous life before they were transformed into works of art. The bottari and the act of travel continue to be central themes for her work Bottari Truck in Exile (1999), made on the road as a truck heaped with piles of clothing, wrapped in silk bedcovers, travelled from one location to another. Kimsooja dedicated the piece, which was presented at the Venice Biennale, to refugees of the Kosovo war. Performance and Video Works =Early performance and video works= alt= In Kimsooja's first video performance, Sewing into Walking-Kyungju (1994), Kimsooja is seen atop the valleys of Gwangju (formerly spelled Kwangju), South Korea, picking up scattered bedcovers on the valley's floor and wrapping them into a bundle. A year later, Kimsooja returned to the valley for the first Gwangju Biennale in Korea and scattered various clothes made of traditional Korean fabrics on the ground of a forest. This installation, made of 2.5 tons of second-hand clothes and entitled Sewing into Walking- Dedicated to the victims of Kwangju, commemorated the victims of the suppression of a democratic protest in Gwangju in 1980. This work established an analogy between the structure of fabric and that of the land, which was of particular importance in terms of confirming the three-dimensionality and spatial topology of fabric in Kimsooja's work, as well as establishing her body in performance as a needle that weaves through the fabric of humanity and nature.Brewinska, Maria, from the exhibition catalogue Kimsooja at the Zacheta Gallery of Art, Warsaw, 2003. =Cities on the Move: 2727km Bottari Truck and Bottari Truck - Migrateurs = In Cities on the Move ‚Äì 2727 km Bottari Truck, Kimsooja sits atop a mound of bottari being transported across the country. Documenting part of her 11-day performance on her journey to places she resided before she made a cultural exile from Korea to New York at the end of the 1990s. In 2007, Kimsooja records her performance in Paris, where she contemplates our reality of constant migration in a global society that drives us as migrateurs of every society we come from and are heading toward. The Bottari Truck - Migrateurs was made of local immigrants‚Äô bedcovers and used clothing donated from all over Paris that was loaded on top of an old French Peugeot pick-up truck. Kim started from ‚ÄòPlace de la Liberation‚Äô where Mus√©e MAC/VAL, which commissioned the piece, is located, and at the same time which is just on the border of south east of Paris, where many immigrants from China, the Middle East, Africa and Europe live. She moves on to different neighborhoods of Paris, which signifies the history of immigrants in France: Ivry (large Chinese community), Place d‚ÄôItaly, Bastille, Place de la Republic, Canal Saint-Martin(which used to have tents along the canal area from homeless people, now much cleaned, making a water tunnel), Gare du Nord, Goutte d‚ÄôOr (a large African, Middle Eastern, Indian community), to the destination ‚Äò√âglise Saint-Bernard‚Äô, where most of the illegal immigrants settled down and protested their right to live in France in 1996; that has become a big political issue in French society. =A Needle Woman= left In 1999, Kimsooja presented her most iconic work: A Needle Woman, a performance video piece that premiered at CCA Kitakyushu and further evolved in subsequent showings as a multi-channel video projection. In A Needle Woman, the artist is seen with her back facing the camera, wearing precisely the same clothes and standing precisely the same way in various metropolises:Madoff, Steven Henry, \\"Gnomon of Place, Gnomon of foreignness.\\" Host & Guest catalogue for group exhibition at Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2013 Tokyo, Shanghai, Delhi, New York, Mexico City, Cairo, Lagos, London, Patan, Nepal (1999‚Äì2001); and in a second series of performances: Havana, Cuba; N‚ÄôDjamena, Chad; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Sana‚Äôa, Yemen; and Jerusalem (2005). Some locations visited in the work are places of violence, disrepair, or unresolved conflict, lending to the needle a metaphoric function as an instrument of healing. Also in A Laundry Woman (2000), a performance video piece shot in India, Kimsooja is seen immobile and standing in front of a river where debris seemingly drift. A Needle Woman and A Laundry Woman exposed the artist's stances on non-doing and immobility as a form of art practice; specifically, lending to the action of immobility the virtue of inverting an audience's linear perception of space and time. The first version of A Needle Woman presented the artist laying horizontally on a rock and it established nature and spatial orientation as a central subject in her work. As well, her use of the Korean color spectrum (Obangsaek), in which each color stands for a cardinal direction in Korean tradition, took up great importance.Geusa, Antonio, Calm Chaos: Earth-Water- Fire-Air, catalogue for exhibition at Permm, Published by Permm, Russia, 2012 pp.30‚Äì38 Kimsooja, Earth-Water-Fire-Air, 2009 Kimsooja, Thread Routes - Chapter I, 2010 alt= = Other video and film works = For A Mirror Woman: The Sun and The Moon, commissioned by the Shiseido Art Foundation in 2008, Kimsooja filmed the sun setting and the moon rising along the beach of Goa, India. The artist then digitally layered an eclipse, in which the footage of the Sun and the Moon were fused together. In Earth ‚Äì Water ‚Äì Fire ‚Äì Air, a multi-channel video projection that premiered at the 2009 Lanzarote Biennale, Spain, the fusion of basic elements was grasped live by the artist on the Island of Lanzarote in the Canary Island, Guatemala, and Greenland. Here, the concept of fusion enhanced the idea of earlier experiments in immobility, continually incarnated in the artist's persistent representation of permanence and impermanence, horizontal and vertical structures, the forward and backward movements of sewing.Ingrid Commandeur, Kimsooja: Black holes, Meditative Vanishings and Nature as a Mirror of the Universe, in Windflower, Perceptions of Nature, NAI and Kroller-Muller Museum, 2012 Starting in 2010, Kimsooja initiated a 16mm film project entitled Thread Routes. Divided into six chapters, the series unfolds as an anthropological poem that takes the act of threading as a central subject. It takes place in six different cultural zones around the world, its six preliminary chapters shot in Peru, Europe, India, China, North America, and North Africa. To Breathe: Invisible Mirror/ Invisible Needle, which premiered at La Fenice, Venice in 2006, was a nine- minute video projection of a color spectrum that filled the entirety of the theater's stage. A five-channel audio track entitled The Weaving Factory (2004) accompanied the piece, forming a couplet of inhalation and exhalation of the artist's own breathing that became increasingly less agile as the color spectrum continued its gestation.Ricky D'ambrose, Kim Sooja: To Breathe: Invisible Mirror / Invisible Needle, les presses du reel, 2013 Site-specific installations Kimsooja, To Breathe: Bottari, Solo Exhibition at The Korean Pavilion, Venice, 2013. alt= Over the last two decades, Kimsooja has developed works that uses lights and color‚Äìin parallel to Obangseak color spectrum, which represents 5 cardinal directionality in Korean philosophy‚Äìin response to many historical and modern buildings. A Lighthouse Woman (2002) was a site- specific installation where Kimsooja used light, color, and sound to transform the abandoned lighthouse in Morris Island (Charleston, South Carolina) for the 2002 Spoleto Festival. A Lighthouse Woman inaugurated a series of work the artist created as memorial projects that includes: Sewing Into Walking - Dedicated to the victims of Kwangju (1995); Planted Names (2002); Mandala: Chant for Auschwitz (2010); and A Mirror Woman: The Ground of Nowhere (2003). [47] Another commemorative work, Kimsooja's An Album: Hudson Guild, is a video project created in collaboration with the Hudson Guild Senior Center in Chelsea, New York, in 2009. To Breathe ‚Äì A Mirror Woman, was developed for the Palacio de Cristal in Madrid in 2006, was a mirror installation that covered the flooring of the Palacio. The entire cupola of the palace was covered with a translucent film that diffracted daylight and the Palacio was also replete with the sound of the artist's breathing.Doris Van Drathen, Standing at the Point Zero Catalogue for a solo exhibition Kimsooja, A Mirror Woman: The Sun & The Moon at the Shiseido Gallery, Tokyo, Published by Shiseido Corporate Culture Department, 2008 In Lotus: Zone of Zero was first installed at Palais Rameau, Lille, Kimsooja hung six rows of concentric circles consisting of 384 temple lanterns in the shape of lotus blossoms from the glass pavilion. Six speakers aligned the circle simultaneously played Gregorian, Tibetan, and Islamic chants, which echoed throughout the room and united at the hollow center. According to Kimsooja, this is the realm of \\"Zero,\\" in which different faiths form a harmonious union that transcends into a space for meditation and contemplation. The many lanterns hung overhead were meant to humble the viewer and remind them of their relationship with their community. Kimsooja created Lotus: Zone of Zero in response to the Iraq War; she wanted to create a place where different religions and people of different cultures could live in a state of harmonious coexistence. Kimsooja represented Korea for the South Korean pavilion at the 55th Venice Biennale in 2013. For the piece entitled To Breathe: Bottari, Kimsooja wrapped the entirety of the national pavilion's interior with a translucent film that diffracted daylight, showering the internal structure with spectrums of light. Her sound piece The Weaving Factory (2004‚Äì2013) also filled the pavilion with the sound of the artist inhaling and exhaling. These aspects of light and sound were further heightened by To Breathe: Blackout (2013), an anechoic chamber where the audience would be cast in complete darkness and devoid of sound except for that of the viewer's own body. Other notable public commissions include: A Needle Woman: Galaxy was a Memory, Earth is a Souvenir (2014), a monumental 46-foot-tall sculpture commissioned and installed for the Cornell Council for the Arts 2014 Biennial on the campus of Cornell University; and Mandala: Zone of Zero, which premiered at The Project in New York City in 2003 and consisted of the sound of Tibetan, Gregorian, and Islamic chants animating a large target-shaped jukebox. In 2019, Kimsooja takes over the City of Poitiers for the first edition of Travers√©es, a new international artistic and cultural event, closely linked to the fate of a major landmark, the Palace of the Dukes of Aquitaine, and its surrounding district, the heart of the city's history and heritage. For Travers√©es\\\\Kimsooja, curated by the artistic directors Emma Lavigne and Emmanuelle de Montgazon, the artist presented more than a dozen specific installations within the historic monuments of the city, including Archive of Mind (2019), To Breathe (2019), To Breathe - The Flags (2019), and Bottari 1999-2019 (2019) consisting in a shipping container painted using Obangseak colors and filled with the artist's personal belongings, accumulated in her New York apartment over twenty years. Kimsooja wraps her belongings in a container, and transports them from one continent to another, a metaphor for her perpetual nomadic Bottari. In 2020, Kimsooja is the first contemporary artist of the 21st century to have been commissioned permanent stained glasses for the Metz Cathedral in France. In the summer of 2020, Kimsooja opened up a new installation in Wan√•s, Sweden called \\"Sowing into Painting\\" where she featured film, sculpture, painting, and planting. This projected was created with the idea of, \\"By planting a field of flax plants, she metaphorically encapsulates the entire cycle of material production and considers the interplay of impermanence and perpetuity, and of life and art. These plants, which are grown and harvested in a period of several months, will transform into paintings that could last for centuries.\\" Exhibitions (selection) *We Do Not Dream Alone, Inaugural Asia Society Triennial, New York, USA, 2020 *Kimsooja: Sowing into Painting, Wan√•s Foundation, Wan√•s, Sweden, 2020 *Travers√©es\\\\Kimsooja, Inaugural biennale featuring more than ten site-specific installations, Poitiers, France, 2019 *Kimsooja: To Breathe, Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Wakefield, UK, 2019 *Kimsooja: Archive of Mind, Peabody Essex Museum, Salem, USA, 2019 *Zone of Nowhere, PICA, Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts, Perth, Australia, 2018 *To Breathe - The Flags, Perth Festival, Perth, Australia, 2018 *Weaving the World, Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein, Vaduz, Liechtenstein, 2017 *KIMSOOJA / Archive of Mind, MMCA, Seoul, Korea, 2016 *Kimsooja, To Breathe, Centre Pompidou Metz, 2015 * Kimsooja, Thread Routes, Guggenheim Bilbao, 2015. * Kimsooja, To Breathe: Bottari, The Korean Pavilion, 55th Venice Biennale, Venice, Italy, 2013. * Kimsooja / Unfolding, Vancouver Art Gallery, Vancouver, Canada, 2013. * Kimsooja, Mumbai: A Laundry Field, Feldkirch Church, Co-organized by Kunstmuseum Lichtenstein, Lichtenstein, 2010. * A Needle Woman - Paris, H√¥tel De Ville Paris, Commissioned by Nuit Blanche, Paris, France, 2009. * Black Box: Kimsooja, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington D.C., United States, 2008. * Kimsooja, To Breathe - A Mirror Woman, a site-specific installation at the Crystal Palace, commissioned by Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a, Madrid, Spain, 2006. * Kimsooja, To Breathe / Respirare, A Site-Specific Installation at La Fenice Theater, in conjunction with a joint Solo Exhibition at Fondazione Bevilacqua la Masa, Venice, Italy, 2006. * Kimsooja, To Breathe: Invisible Mirror / Invisible Needle, Theatre Chatelet, Commissioned by Nuit Blanche Paris, France, 2006. * Kimsooja, A Wind Woman, The Project, New York, United States, 2006. * Kimsooja, A Wind Woman, Peter Blum Gallery, Chelsea New York, 2006. * Kimsooja, Conditions of Humanity, traveling solo show, Museum Kunst Palast, D√ºsseldorf, Germany; Padiglione d'Arte Contemporanea, PAC, Milan; Museum of Contemporary Art, Lyon 2004. * Kimsooja, A Laundry Woman, Kunsthalle, Wien, Austria, 2002. * Kimsooja, A Needle Woman, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center / MOMA, New York, United States, 2001. * Kimsooja, A Needle Woman, Kunsthalle Bern, Bern, Switzerland 2001. * Kimsooja, Bottari, Sprengel Museum, Hanover, Germany, 2001. * Kimsooja, A Needle Woman, ICC, Tokyo, Japan, 2000. * Kimsooja, Bottari Truck in Exile, 48th Venice Biennale, Venice, Italy, 1999.

He ruled from 994 to 1007 CE. History Jagat Malla gets special attention in the history of the Malla dynasty, as it is believed that as per the direction of the Goddess Jagadamba Ma Mrinmoyee, he shifted his capital from Pradyumnapur to Bishnupur. According to myth, Jagat Malla once went to Bishnupur for a hunt. The then Bishnupur was covered with a dense forest. At that place he noticed that a heron, sitting on a branch of a tree, repeatedly attacked one of his hunting dogs. Upon seeing that he was very astonished and thought that the place has definitely some supernatural power. Then Ma Mrinmoyee appeared to him and told him to shift his capital to Bishnupur and he did so. It is told that Bishnupur was previously a village and named Bishnupur as per the name of the guardian deity Vishnu. In 997 CE., Jagat Malla established Mrinmoyee temple. During his rule, Bishnupur was a very developed and also was a self-sufficient kingdom. Jagat Malla reigned for thirteen years. There were several Malla Kings after Jagat Malla, among them Prithwi Malla (1295 CE. to 1319 CE.), Dinabandhu Malla (1334 CE. to 1345 CE.) and Shiv Singh Malla (1370 CE. to 1460 CE.).

In light of this evidence, Steinacher further analyzes these three major institutions (the ICRC, the US government and the Catholic Church) aided Nazi war criminals in their escape from Justice. In many ways, Steinacher argues, the threat of the spread of Communism provided an impulse for the US government and the Catholic Church to aid Nazis who might potentially become new allies in their war against Godless Communism.

It is part of the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis catalogue (BWV catalogue) of the works of J. S. Bach, and sometimes called the \\"Orchestral Suite No. 5\\", but was almost certainly not composed by him. It is more likely that the composer was W. F. Bach. It is a French suite with an overture and several dances, which has a similar structure with the 4 orchestral suites known to have been written by J. S. Bach. Different from those by J. S. Bach, however, the opening movement bears a different form, and the entire work has one movement not in the home key. History Modern publications of the suite derive from a collection of manuscript parts prepared by Christian Friedrich Penzel, one of J. S. Bach's last pupils, in 1753. The suite was first published by the Bach Gesellschaft in 1897, in volume 45 of their publication of J. S. Bach's complete works. In 1950, Wolfgang Schmieder assigned to the suite the number 1070 in the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV) catalogue. Identity of the composer Despite the inclusion of the suite in the BWV catalogue, the suite's composer is not known. The British musicologist Nicholas Kenyon writes that the suite is \\"certainly not by J. S. Bach\\", and that it is \\"likely to be by an unknown composer or possibly W. F. Bach\\". The American musicologist David Schulenberg, who published a detailed study of the suite in 2010, also considers that W. F. Bach is \\"the most likely candidate\\" among the suite's possible composers, citing Wilhelm Friedemann's close relationship with Penzel, the copyist, and stylistic similarities between the suite and Wilhelm Friedemann's other compositions. Instrumentation This suite is scored for strings and basso continuo. Structure This suite consists of five movements. #Larghetto - Un poco allegro (G minor, prelude and double fugue) #Torneo (G minor, binary form) #Aria (Adagio) (E-flat major, binary form with possible allusions to sonata form) #Menuetto alternativo - Trio (G minor, minuet and trio form, trio in G major) #Capriccio (G minor, double fugue) See also J.

It is native to Papua New Guinea and northern Australia. It adapts readily to captivity and can be kept in a small freshwater aquarium. Taxonomy Max Carl Wilhelm Weber described Pseudomugil gertrudae in 1911 from specimens collected from Trangan Island in the Aru Islands, naming it in honour of Gertrude, the wife of Dr. Hugo Merton, who visited the islands in 1907‚Äì08. Common names include spotted blue-eye, delicate blue-eye, Gertrude's blue-eye, and northern blue-eye. Description The spotted blue-eye has an elongated body generally up to 2.5 cm (1 in), or rarely 3 cm (1.2 in) in length. The overall colour is transparent to pale silver-white, sometimes with tints of tan or yellow. The rear half of the body is marked with three horizontal black lines, breaking up into spots anteriorly. The fins are yellow with black markings. Body size, colour and shape vary across its range: fish from the Aru Islands are larger, those from the vicinity of Darwin have orange pectoral fins, while fish from Goanna Lagoon in Arnhem Land have an orange body. left Distribution and habitat The spotted blue-eye is found in rivers in southern New Guinea, the Aru Islands, and the Northern Territory and Cape York Peninsula (Queensland) in Australia. Their habitat includes small slow-moving streams, often less than 60 cm (2 ft) deep, pools, and Melaleuca or Pandanus swamps. They have been found in water of pH 3.68 to 9.4. Feeding Though its diet has been little- studied, algae and small invertebrates make up a large part of it.

Today, the Makor Chaim Educational Institution operates a high school located in the Gush Etzion area, south of Jerusalem. It has been recognized by the Ministry of Education as an Experimental School and a Teacher Training Institution as well.http://www.nbn.org.il/aliyahpedia/education-ulpan/school-profiles/mekor- chaim-yeshiva/ The senior Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Dov Singer is ably assisted by Rabbi David Rabinowitz. In addition to the high school which serves close to 300 students annually, Makor Chaim also operates the \\"Beit Midrash L'Hitchadshut\\" (the Renewal Outreach Center), a nationwide outreach study andprayer program for personal spiritual development as well as several training and development programs for educators, administrators and others committed to focusing on the student rather than on subject material. Educational and religious philosophy The Yeshiva is known for its Neo- Chassidic ideology. Having said that, The Yeshiva encourages students to find their own path in their Avodat Hashem (Worship of G-d). It is very common to find two students sitting next to each other in the Bet Midrash, with one learning Likutei Moharan (Hebrew: ◊ú◊ô◊ß◊ï◊ò◊ô ◊û◊ï◊î◊®\\"◊ü, one the main books of the Breslav Chassidic sect), and the other learning a book such as Nefesh Hachaim (Hebrew: ◊†◊§◊© ◊î◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ù, whose author, R' Chaim of Volozhin was a prominent student of the Vilna Gaon and a pioneer of Lithuanian-style yeshivas). The Educational philosophy of the Yeshiva is one that encourages the individual student to excel in the area that interests him, and the yeshiva will readily offer assistance to a student who is in need of additional help. The focus is on realizing the potential of the individual student. This can be seen in the unique programs for Talmud Study that the Yeshiva offers for its students. In the morning Talmud Study period, a high level Talmud class, known as \\"Eshkolot Iyun\\" (Hebrew: ◊ê◊©◊õ◊ï◊ú◊ï◊™ ◊¢◊ô◊ï◊ü) is offered for interested 10th and 11th graders. The focus of this program is developing the students analytical skills, and being able to find the conceptual underpinnings of the matter at hand. A program bearing the same name is offered for students of all ages during the nightly Talmud Study period. Students have the option of learning a full double-sided pholio (Daf) of Talmud, as opposed to a one sided pholio (Amud). This range of options gives the student the opportunity to find what is best for him, and allows him to develop his own path in Torah learning. Another example of this is found in the afternoon Torah Study period after afternoon prayers. This is a time for students to learn whatever their heart desires, and many develop a deep love and appreciation for the torah by studying a part of the torah that they feel uniquely connected to. Many students say that it is this time of the day that they cherish the most. The same is true regarding the secular studies. The core curriculum as set by the Ministry of Education is taught, but many additional options are available for interested students. Part of the core curriculum are the electives that 11th and 12th graders study. These include Physics, Biology, Literature, Environmental Studies, Computer Science, Land of Israel Studies and History. The student is encouraged to choose what is best for him, and the teaching staff is always ready to assist a student in need of guidance. In 2005, the Senior Rosh Yeshiva, Rav Dov Singer established the Bet Hamidrash for Renewal (Hebrew: ◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊î◊û◊ì◊®◊© ◊ú◊î◊™◊ó◊ì◊©◊ï◊™), and the educational philosophy of the Yeshiva started to spread throughout the Israeli educational system. Since 2007, the school has offered a joint exchange program with Yeshiva University High School for Boys in which a number of YUHSB students spend a half semester at Makor Chaim and then return with a number of YMC students who spend time at YUHSB. It is also offering a similar program with Yeshiva College of South Africa. Those programs include a class of approximately 25 foreign students living and learning in Makor Chaim for about a month, and four students from Makor Chaim going abroad for 5-6 weeks. The goal of those programs is to uplift the sense of zionism and \\"chious\\", spirit of life, in the foreign schools students' . Daily schedule The daily schedule starts at 7:00 am with morning prayers, followed by breakfast. From 9:00 until 12:30 students learn Judaic studies, where they primarily engage in rigorous Talmud Study. Classes in Jewish Thought and philosophy are also taught in this portion of the day. After luch, the secular studies begin at 13:30, and end at 18:30, with afternoon prayers and additional torah study from 16:20-17:10. This is followed by dinner. Evening prayers begin at 19:15, followed by an hour or two (depending on the learning program in which the student is enrolled) of Talmud Study. The remaining night hours are dedicated to homework, hobbies, relaxing, clubs, and sleep. The Three Boys In June 2014, a national tragedy struck Makor Chaim.http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/07/01/rabbi-adin-steinsaltz-his-murdered- students-and-a-call-to-action/ Three students were kidnapped from outside the grounds of the Center on a Thursday evening as they prepared to make their way home for the Sabbath. Naftali Fraenkel, Gile'ad Shear and Eyal Ifrach never made it home.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/30/bodies-missing- israeli-teenagers-found-west-bank An eighteen-day intensive search resulted in the discovery that the 3 boys had been murdered by their Hamas abductors moments after they were snatched. Three months after the abduction, buoyed by the allocation of 32 dunams of land by the State of Israel, Makor Chaim and the She'ar, Ifrach and Fraenkel families \\"Chose Life\\". A campaign to build a permanent new educational campus in memory of Eyal, Gilad and Naftali was launched. The new campus project was to begin construction by the summer of 2015. A special event marking the first anniversary of the boys kidnapping was held in June 2015.

The psychological sense of \\"I\\" am experience is ahamkƒÅra which comes about as and when owing to avidya , Brahman, the Universal transcendental Self, is distinguished from the Jiva, the empirical individual self. Sanga (one's associations), mamkƒÅra (attachments) and moha (attractions) are the three aspects of abhimƒÅna (ego-consciousness) which produces katrtva (the sense agency) as the deliberate consciousness of ni≈õcaya (decision) without which there would be no difference between the self and other material objects; buddhi (intellect), which manifests according to vƒÅsanƒÅs (impressions), is deliberate decision. : ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§É‡§ï‡§∞‡§£‡§Æ‡•á‡§§‡•á‡§∑‡•Å ‡§ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§¶‡§ø‡§∑‡•Å ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑‡•ç‡§Æ‡§£‡§ø  : ‡§Ö‡§π‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§≠‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•á‡§® ‡§§‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§†‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∏‡§§‡•á‡§ú‡§∏‡§æ  : \\" The antahkarana (internal organ, the mind) has its seat in these, the eye and other organs of the body identifying itself with them with the sense of \\"I\\" by reflection of the ƒÅtman in it. \\" ‚Äì Vivekachudamani (105) Shankara tells us that the mind or manas dwells in the organs and body as aham (ego) with abhimƒÅna ‚Äì ‡§Ö‡§π‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§≠‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•á‡§® in the reflected brightness of the atman as the kartƒÅ (doer) and the bhoktƒÅ (enjoyer) experiencing all three states of consciousness but the atman, the witness of everything, limited by buddhi is not tainted by anything that buddhi does ‚Äì ‡§Ö‡§∂‡•á‡§∑‡§∏‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•Ä for the taint of action attaches only to the actor, the ƒÅtman does not act. This abhimƒÅna or identification with names and forms dependent on the perishable body, as also with the subtle body, needs to be given up entirely in order to realize akhanda ƒÅnanda (inseparable bliss). VƒÅcaspati Mi≈õra explains that it is ahamkƒÅra (empirical ego) which presides over the objects intuited by the sense-organs and then definitely perceived by the mind; and that the sense-organ intuits the object, manas reflects on it, ahamkƒÅra appropriates it and finally buddhi (intellect) resolves which way the intended action must proceed. AbhimƒÅna is the false sense of \\"I\\" and \\"mine\\"; it is because of the emphatic identity (abhimƒÅna) with one's body etc., that there is pramata (cognising subject) and involvement with pramƒÅnas (acts or processes of knowing, perception, inference and the rest) owing to functioning of the senses as resulting from avidyƒÅ (ignorance) and resulting in bondage. Examined from the level of social consciousness, ƒÅtman or the transcendental consciousness is certainly essential for man's being but upadhis (limitations) are its accidental parts the self-identification with which gives rise to abhimƒÅna (identification with the body) that makes man a socio-spiritual being subjective and objective, both, and becomes the basis for his adhikƒÅra (social and ritual eligibility). According to the Shudha Advaita school of Vallabha Acharya, saguna means ‚Äì one having the abhimƒÅna of gunas (forming part of one's own self), the nirguna is one having no abhimƒÅna. The Lakshmi Tantra tells us that \\"ahamkƒÅra which is a cognitive-sense, is identical with abhimƒÅna\\" and \\"the awareness of the knower in relating time and place to himself is called abhimƒÅna\\". For most people desiring success, incidental gains and weighed down by sense of self-respect abhimƒÅna is a virtue but for those who are wise and contented, it is mere pride associated with arrogance. Bhoja, who outlined the theory of Rasa (experience of delight), attaches great importance to abhimƒÅna or ahankƒÅra (ego). He states that the rasika who has rasa in him has it because of sringara (peak), ahamkƒÅra and abhimƒÅna, enjoyable as a guna of his atman; he uses the term abhimƒÅna in a good sense. From ahamkƒÅra rises abhimƒÅna that originates sringƒÅra, and from abhimƒÅna rises rati (love, amorousness), and from rati are originated all rasas.

When she was just 15, she published Le C≈ìur en poche, which sold over 100,000 copies. Bibliography The daughter of a Dutch teacher, Aventin was born in Hermalle-sous-Argenteau near Li√®ge in southwestern Belgium. She studied French language and literature at Li√®ge University and English literature at Leeds University. She went on to teach Belgian literature at the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w, Poland. In 1988, when she was 15, she published Le C≈ìur en poche. It tells the story of Alexandre, a prostitute's daughter, whose life is split between days with her friends at high school and nights in the world of prostitution. In order to get it published as quickly as possible, she took the manuscript to the Mercure de France publishing house, explaining that she was the daughter of a prostitute and had written her autobiography. She admitted later that she had made it all up but the book had already sold over 100,000 copies. She was compared to Fran√ßoise Sagan who gained fame with Bonjour Tristesse when she was 18. After her second book Le Diable Peint (1988), which was far less successful, Aventin graduated at Li√®ge with a m√©moire on Nathalie Barney : le mythe de la litt√©rature lesbienne. After a period in Krak√≥w, she worked as a journalist before writing her third novel, Le d√©sir demeur√© (2001), re-edited as Le somnambule (2006). Her next novel, Portrait nu (2005), is a powerful erotic novel, the story of how the narrator becomes sexually involved with a bar owner and a woman young enough to be his daughter. It is divided into three parts: the first covers a night, the second a week and the third a season in the author's attempt to convey a sense of increasing speed. After her first novel, Aventin has tried to improve her style, adopting a poetic but precise approach and a strictly thought-out structure. \\"In each book,\\" she explains, \\"I try to achieve an appropriate style and structure. It's a matter of finding the one-and-only correct structure and language for what I have to say. It obviously takes time to write the first few pages but then, like a living body, the heart beats, the blood circulates...\\" Her most recent work, Red Shoes (2012), is the script for a 50-minute show revealing how Judy experiences the development of her body as she grows from childhood into an adult.

The APM technology was originally developed by Westinghouse, then owned by Adtranz, and most recently acquired by Bombardier in 2001. Since its market debut in 1971, there have been three generations ‚Äì Innovia APM 100 (known originally as C-100 and CX-100), Innovia APM 200 (originally known as just Innovia people mover) and the latest Innovia APM 300. Innovia APM at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. History Development began in the 1960s when Westinghouse (bought by AEG in 1988, later Adtranz in 1996) first engineered the South Park APM demonstration project in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1963. The technology came to be known as the Skybus, because it was a rubber-tired vehicle, similar to a bus that operated on a designated elevated roadway. From the very beginning, it was designed to be an automated rapid transit system. Engineers believed that it would be able to move 5,000 to 14,000 per hour per direction, and could offer around-the-clock service every two minutes. The first attempts to bring the Skybus technology to market were controversial, with political leaders holding opposing views on the prospects of a rubber-tired mass transit system. Eventually plans to implement a Skybus system in Pennsylvania were rejected. Despite this, work continued on the technology. DFW Skylink at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport In 1971, the first airport people mover system was opened at Tampa International Airport ‚Äì beginning a new chapter in transportation history. After Westinghouse was acquired by Adtranz, the technology was marketed as the Adtranz C-100 automated people mover system. The C-100 system (and the newer CX-100 system) was relatively successful in the 1980s and 1990s with 14 new systems delivered. As the competing Mitsubishi Crystal Mover technology grew in popularity, Adtranz began developing a new, more aerodynamic model known as Innovia, which started testing in 1999. In addition to its sleeker appearance, the new Innovia people mover also offered greater speeds, tighter turns, full composite construction and a choice in end caps. The first Innovia people mover system delivered opened in 2005 at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Despite the development of this newer model, Bombardier continued to sell the CX-100 technology under then name Innovia APM 100 while it also marketed the new Innovia people mover technology (last Innovia APM 100 system delivered in 2010). However, after the development of a third generation model and a rebranding strategy by Bombardier to label its entire automated transit system portfolio as ‚ÄòINNOVIA‚Äô, the two previous models became legacy systems and are no longer marketed to new customers. Although, existing customers can and do still order more vehicles as needed. The third and latest model is called the Innovia APM 300 system. It looks very similar to the original Innovia people mover (now called the Innovia APM 200 system), but is longer, more energy efficient and capable of 6-car train configurations. In November 2014, Bombardier signed a joint venture (JV) agreement with CSR Puzhen in China to develop and manufacture Innovia APM vehicles (as well as Innovia Monorail vehicles) for the Chinese market. Production Innovia APM vehicles are assembled in West Mifflin, part of the Greater Pittsburgh Area, Pennsylvania. The multi-building facility specializes in automated people mover technology and has three test tracks.

Currently there are three urban systems used as feeder systems as part of a larger mass transit network. Innovia APM systems operate in tunnels, on elevated guideways, and sometimes in an open cut (pit) or a combination of tunnels and elevated guideways. They can assume three different system configurations ‚Äì shuttle,https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/Bombardier- Celebrates-Opening-iw-707388192.html loop, and pinched loop.http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?283768 The shuttle system is the least complex. One train operates on each lane of a dual lane guideway. After the train dwells in one of the end stations for passengers for entry and exit, it reverses direction and returns to the opposite end station. Because Innovia APM vehicles are fully automated, they do not require a driver's cab, which allows them to be bidirectional. A loop is an enclosed system that connects multiple stations along a track or guideway that is a continuous circle or closed curve. Loop systems can be designed as either a single lane or a dual lane configuration. A pinched-loop system shares common characteristics with both the shuttle and the loop systems. Pinched loops look like a dual-lane shuttle (with two parallel guideways), but trains can go from one track to the other changing direction via switches at each end. As a result, traffic on a pinched loop flows in opposite directions on two parallel tracks, but can accommodate many stations.http://ntl.bts.gov/DOCS/11877/Chapter_24.htm  Versions  * Bombardier Innovia APM 100 - the first generation model, formerly known as ADtranz CX-100 ** Bombardier Innovia APM 100 C801 for Bukit Panjang LRT since 1999 ** Bombardier Innovia APM 100 C801A for Bukit Panjang LRT since 2014 *Bombardier Innovia APM 200 - the second generation model * Bombardier Innovia APM 256 * Bombardier Innovia APM 300 - the third generation model ** Bombardier Innovia APM 300 C801B for Bukit Panjang LRT from 2021 See also * Automated people mover systems * Bombardier Guided Light Transit * Bombardier Innovia - automated transit system * Bombardier Innovia Metro - automated metro systems * Bombardier Innovia Monorail - automated monorail systems Competing systems: * Cable Liner by DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car *Mitsubishi Crystal Mover *V√©hicule Automatique L√©ger References  External links  * American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) - Automated People Mover Standards Committee Innovia APM ","title":"Bombardier Innovia APM"},{"id":"45554218","text":"Chhalia is a 1973 Hindi-language Indian feature film directed by Mukul Dutt and starring Navin Nischol, Nanda, Shatrughan Sinha, Rajendra Nath and Helen.

She is known for the wide ranging topics of her plays, though a central feature running through most of them is the focus on flawed characters in both ordinary and extraordinary circumstances. She is particularly well known for Blonde Poison which has had seven productions worldwide including at the Sydney Opera House. Early life Louw was born in Johannesburg to a middle class Jewish family. Her father, Maish Levy, was a second generation Jew from Lithuanian parents. Her mother, Ruth Levy (nee Wallach) was born in Berlin in 1924. Ruth managed to get a student visa to Tel Aviv in April 1939. Her parents were deported to Minsk and were killed by the Nazis in 1942. Ruth and her sister Gila were told by the Red Cross at the end of the war that their parents had survived and were living in America. On the following day, they received a phone call to tell them that their parents had in fact been killed. Ruth lived in Israel until she met Maish who was volunteering at the time in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. They returned to South Africa in 1948 for the birth of their son, Brian. Louw left South Africa to live in Israel after finishing school at 17. She was one of the first students on the Mount Scopus campus in Jerusalem. She returned to Johannesburg to continue her studies in 1971. She studied at the University of Witwatersrand for a degree in English and a teachers‚Äô diploma. Louw moved to Brighton in the UK in 1976. After a variety of jobs, she received a PhD in the area of Organisational Informatics in the NHS at Brighton University in 1994. After a training fellowship at the Institute of Child Health in Systematic Reviews, she began teaching at the University of Brighton and became the Progamme Leader in Public Health at the Institute of Postgraduate Medicine. Career in theatre Louw undertook a Postgraduate Diploma and later an MA in Dramatic Writing at Sussex University in 2000. With the support of New Writing South she was taken under the wing of Tony Milner from New Vic Productions who produced and directed many of her earlier plays. =Plays with Jewish themes= Her earliest plays all dealt with Jewish themes particularly related to her mother. Two Sisters, a semi-biographical retelling of the relationship of her mother and aunt, is set on a kibbutz in Israel. This play has had three productions; two different ones in the UK, one directed by Louw, and one in Los Angeles directed by Stewart Zully for Theatre 40. A fourth production, translated into the Hebrew and directed by Roy Horovitz is due to be produced in 2020 in Israel. Other early plays on a Jewish theme include Herschel, based on the story of Herschel Grynszpan who killed a top Nazi official in 1938 and precipitated Kristallnacht, Killing Faith, her first produced play, and Steps Out Of Time, originally called Shabat in Zfat. Her most performed play, Blonde Poison, is discussed below. A later play, Eishes Chayill ‚Äì Woman of Valour, returns to the Jewish theme by using music to explore marriage, feminism and frustration in a Haredi community. Although not a Jewish play, Joe Ho Ho is a four-hander which looks at sexual frustration, fantasy and the commitment a daughter feels for her mother. In this case the mother has Alzheimers; Louw used much of her experience caring for her own mother who suffered with Alzheimers in later life. =Political plays= Duwayne had a tagline ‚Äì He survived Stephen Lawrence‚Äôs killers: Can he survive the Met? This play won Best New Play at Brighton Festival in 2014. It portrays the experience Duwayne Brooks had at the hands of the Metropolitan Police. Actors were: Adrian DeCosta as Duwayne, David Aja and Andy De Marquez as various policemen. The Ice Cream Boys is based on a fictionalised meeting between Jacob Zuma and Ronnie Kasrils. This play was put on at Jermyn Street Theatre in October 2019 and at Theatre on the Square in August 2020. Actors were Jack Klaff as Kasrils, Andrew Francis as Zuma and Bu Kunene as the Nurse and others. =Monologues= Louw is particularly known for her monologues. All her monologues share a firmly held principle that the protagonist must be talking to someone, or several people, or people who change, or him/herself, but they are not talking to the audience. Three of her most far-reaching plays are monologues: Blonde Poison, Shackleton‚Äôs Carpenter, and \\"And This is My Friend Mr Laurel.'' Blonde Poison is Louw's best known and most accomplished play. It has had eight productions worldwide: a UK based one with Elizabeth Counsell as Stella Goldschlag; Salome Jens Theatre 40 in Beverly Hills Los Angeles; Carole Adams Fritsche at Verona Studio in Salem, Oregon; Belinda Giblin at the Sydney Opera House Sydney and at MTC Melbourne; Fiona Ramsay at Theatre on the Square in Johannesburg; Elizabeth Hawthorne in Auckland, New Zealand; Loureline Snedeker in Boca Raton, Florida; and Dulcie Smart in Berlin. Fiona Ramsay brought her production to London in June 2020. Several of the actors were nominated for prizes or won them. And This Is My Friend Mr Laurel was commissioned by Jeffrey Holland who has performed the role in the UK and Ireland as well as on cruise ships for a number of years. Shackleton‚Äôs Carpenter has been widely performed for many years by Malcolm Rennie. He has been nominated for an Offies award for best Male Performer in a play, after his three week run at Jermyn Street Theatre in August 2019. He has toured the play several times throughout the UK and Ireland and has had over 100 performances including at Chichester Festival Theatre. Shackleton‚Äôs Carpenter had a dramatized reading with Peter FitzSimons at the Maritime Museum in Sydney for six nights. The Mitfords is a one-woman play where four of the Mitford sisters are represented; Jessica, Diana, Verity and Nancy. The play featured Heather Long in the role(s), and was sold out for its entire run. Larkin Descending is a one-man play about the poet Philip Larkin in his older days, talking to Monica. Graham White played Larkin and had a role in developing the play. Being Brahms won a Sussex and Surrey Radio award as best play of the year (Jeffrey Thompson). It featured Andrew Wheaton as Anton/Brahms and is based on a real story by Paul Humpolitz. The Good Dad (A Love Story) is based on a true story from the 1980s. It is a on- woman play with three roles; the actress plays the protagonist, her mother and her twin. The play is based on a young woman who was sexually abused by her father, but who ended up living and having several children with him. The lack of conflict and anger in the household contributed to a culture of silence and acceptance. In addition, he was seen as a good dad, who looked after all the members of both his families, providing love and care. His tricky heart resulted in the status quo continuing until he began to take an interest in the next generation. The production ran for 4 nights at The Old Red Lion in 2020, followed by a three week run at The Hope Theatre in London. =Plays based on real people= Miss Dietrich Regrets is based on the last months of Marlene Dietrich's life as she lay 24/7 in her bed in her Paris apartment. It is a two-hander with her and her daughter, Maria Riva, and explores the conflict between them. It is a revealing and poignant look at the aging Marlene battling with her daughter to retain her independence to the very end. There have been three productions of this play. The South African production won a Naledi award for Fiona Ramsay as Best Actress. A Czech production Miss Dietrich Latuje has been extremely successful in Prague and has had repeated runs since 2017. The original production was with Elizabeth Counsell and Moira Brooker. The Ice Cream Boys and Duwayne, which are discussed above in Political Plays, are also based on well known people. Blonde Poison, And This is my friend Mr Laurel, The Mitfords, Larkin Descending and Shackleton‚Äôs Carpenter, discussed above under Monologues, are all based on real people, some well known. =Plays based on real events= A Life Twice Given is based on the first part of the David Daniel‚Äôs book of the same name. Part of the story relates to real events (the death of his child) and part to a fictional development (cloning the dead child). The three-hander included Natalia Campbell, Damian Reyes-Fox, and Johnny Neal. The Good Dad (A Love Story) is discussed above under Monologues and is based on a real event. =LGBT plays= The Half-Life of Love was produced in the UK with Jack Klaff, Paul Moriarty and Laurence Bown, and at the Verona Theatre in 2017 with Raissa Fleming, Pamela Bilderbeck and Barry Sexton. Junto Diaz said ‚ÄòThe half-life of love is forever.‚ÄôDiaz Junot (2013). This is How You Lose Her. Faber & Faber It remains toxic, poisoning life long after love is over. The Numpty is a play about a family isolated and blown apart by poverty, lack of understanding and acceptance of crucial changes in gender identification. Tina, a lesbian transsexual, is forced to provide lodging to her ex-wife, a woman destroyed by poverty, poor education and prejudice, but feisty, funny and formidable. Their son however, refuses to let them attempt to make a life together. This play has not as yet had a production. My Beautiful Arse looks at the dangers that Cameroonian gay men have to endure. Set amongst a group of dancers, the play explores the culture of ‚Äòwitch‚Äô and social adhesion that is used to reinforce acceptable sexual and behavioural norms. This play has not as yet had a production. =Plays= * Killing Faith (2008) * Two Sisters (2010, 2016, 2017) * Joe Ho Ho (2010) * Blonde Poison (2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2019, 2020) * Miss Dietrich Regrets (2015, 2015, 2017/18/19) * Duwayne (2014) * And This Is My Friend Mr Laurel (2012‚Äì2020) * Shackleton‚Äôs Carpenter (2014, 2015, 2018, 2019) * The Half-Life of Love (2016, 2017) * The Mitfords (2017) * Larkin Descending (2018) * Being Brahms (2019) * A Life Twice Given (2019) * The Ice Cream Boys (2019, 2020) * The Good Dad (A Love Story) 2020 Books Oberon Books has published three collections with four plays in each book: * Gail Louw: Collected Plays (2015) ** Blonde Poison, Miss Dietrich Regrets, Shackleton‚Äôs Carpenter, Two Sisters * Gail Louw: Plays Two (2018) ** Duwayne, The Mitfords, The Half-Life of Love, Joe Ho Ho * Gail Louw: Plays Three (2019) ** The Ice Cream Boys, Being Brahms, A Life Twice Given, Killing Faith * Blonde Poison (2013) * The Ice Cream Boys (2019) References External links * Category:1951 births Category:British women dramatists and playwrights Category:South African dramatists and playwrights Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Johannesburg Category:Jewish musicians by nationality Category:Jewish British musicians Category:University of the Witwatersrand alumni Category:People educated at Brighton College ","title":"Gail Louw"},{"id":"45554272","text":"Madhukar Balvantray Parekh is an Indian entrepreneur, Chairman of Pidilite Industries, a global company among the leaders in adhesives and sealants, construction chemicals, hobby colors.

Built in 1902, it is one of the rural community's most sophisticated architectural buildings. It was designed and built by a local contractor, and has well-proportioned Colonial Revival features. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history Sangerville Town Hall is set facing east on the west side of South Main Street (Maine State Route 23) in Sangerville's village center, a short way south of the Piscataquis River. It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a dormered slate hip roof, weatherboard siding, and a granite foundation. Its main facade is three bays wide, with the center entrance sheltered by a portico that is supported by thin square posts and features an elaborately decorated entablature. The entry itself consists of a double door set in a wide arch, flanked by arched Queen Anne-style windows with colored panes. Above the entry on the second level are a grouping of three sash windows, with a Palladian window at the third level. The side bays have single sash windows at the ground level and doubled sash windows above, joined between levels by a paneled course. The north elevation repeats the window patterns of the flanking bays, with a side entrance occupying the fourth bay (of five), which faces the parking lot. The south elevation repeats the window plan of the upper levels of the north side, but has two entrances on the ground level, flanked by either single or paired sash windows. The rear of the building originally housed a wide entrance for fire equipment; this has been closed off. The interior houses municipal offices and the library on the ground floor, and a large performance space on the upper levels, which include a third-floor gallery level. The rear of the building was built to house a fire truck and hearse; the library later expanded into this space. The building was designed and built in 1901-02 by C. L. Smith, a local contractor about whom little is known. It was built during a period of prosperity brought about by the construction of several woolen mills in the town, and is one of several buildings of architectural sophistication built in the town during that period.

Their music is a mix of punk rock, hardcore punk, folk music and Celtic music with traditional melodies and musical instruments like tin whistle and fiddle. This musical style is commonly called Celtic punk or folk punk. Their lyrics, sung in English, talk about social criticism, diverse historical events, and drinking and partying. History Drink Hunters was created in 2008 in Barcelona. Aaron (lead vocals and bassist) and Pau (drums and vocals) chose the Celtic punk way after some music projects. They mentioned it to Raja (guitarist and vocals), and then they looked for musicians who play traditional instruments to complete their punk rock mixed with Irish folk influences. They called Rosa (accordion) and Nando (fiddle) for that. In January 2010, they recorded their first EP, a self-produced demo. During that same year, they signed with their first label Discos Rayados. They also appeared on Whiskey Devils a tribute to The Mahones covering The Mahones' song called \\"Take no Prisoners\\". In 2011, With my Crew (first album of the band) appeared on the Celtic punk scene. It was well received by the public and by critics. This was soon followed by many concerts around Catalonia and Spain. In March 2012, they took part in the Paddy Rock compilation (Paddy Rock Vol. 4), providing the song \\"With my Crew\\" and sharing this appearance with other bands as The Rumjacks and The Mahones. In September 2014, they released their newest album called Lurking Behind the Woods, which was later shown on their first European tour crossing France, Italy, Germany, Slovakia and Czech Republic. That year, they also released their first clip of the song of their new album \\"The Big Fella\\". Drink Hunters has shared the stage with bands like: The Real Mckenzies, Mad Caddies, Pipes and Pints, The Dreadnoughts, La Plebe, Blowfuse, Freygolo, Bastards on Parade, Skontra, and Brutus Daughters, among others.

MTF presents technological innovations and artistic experimentation, performance, new inventions, commercial applications, and academic research. Music Tech Fest events are streamed live online, and videos of individual presentations are made available on YouTube. The festival runs a 24-hour weekend hackathon and an academic symposium known as the 'afterparty' on the Monday following the weekend's event. At the Boston afterparty, participants collaborated on the composition of a Manifesto for the Future of Music Technology Research.Manifesto for the Future of Music Technology Research. History Music Tech Fest began as result of the Roadmap for Music Information Research (MIReS), a European FP7 project run by seven European research centers: Music Technology Group at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona; Stromatolite; OFAI, Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Vienna, Austria; INESCP, Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, Porto, Portugal; IRCAM at the Centre Pompidou in Paris; Centre for Digital Music (C4DM), Queen Mary, University of London, UK; and Barcelona Music and Audio Technology (BMAT), Barcelona, Spain. The project's Scientific Director Michela Magas of Stromatolite launched the first Music Tech Fest event in London 2012 as a way to bring academics and practitioners together. The first festival included contributions from EMI, BBC, Spotify, SoundCloud and Shazam as well as academic researchers, makers, developers and artists. MTF London 2012 featured 54 performers and presenters, 70 hackers and 70 creatives. In May 2013 the festival ran again in London with the additional involvement of all of the major record labels. In September of that year, Professor Andrew Dubber from Birmingham City University joined as festival director. In 2014, the festival went on tour with events in Wellington, Boston, London, Berlin and Paris. In 2015 festival organisers scheduled larger regional events, rather than focusing on individual cities: MTF Scandinavia in Ume√• and MTF Central Europe in Ljubljana.. In September 2018, MTF took part in Stockholm, Sweden. It had more than 500 participants and some prominent artists as guests, including Imogene Heap. MTF is also a proud supporter of women in music and tech. While most music festivals struggle to find enough female representatives and oblige themselves to reach 50% of a female lineup by 2020, MTF achieved that in 2018. Starting with 2015, the Music Tech Fest is supported by the EU Horizon 2020 project MusicBricks which aims at fostering creative development of new ideas around music technology and supporting pilots which lead to market prototypes. This opens the pathway to reach a wider community of creative SME innovators. Hack Camp  Music Tech Fest supports the growing hack culture, and promotes it as an important source of creativity. The festival frequently contains its own hackathon, MTF Hack Camp, which runs for 24 hours from Saturday afternoon to Sunday. Like Music Hack Day events, the MTF hack camp focuses on music-related hack challenges, but with a particular focus on performance with tangible objects, physical concepts and new integrations between software and hardware. There are competitions held at each MTF hack camp where individuals and groups work in response to particular challenges that reflect the themes of each festival. MTF hack camp challenges have engaged with ideas of accessibility (London 2014), fashion and wearables (Paris 2014), and creative spaces (Berlin 2014). The festivals in London and Ume√• also involve a Kids Hack which Andrew Dubber discussed in an interview for WebTVspot as an 'opportunity for families and young people to get involved'.http://www.vk.se/tv?video=3beca3e9-dc2b-4a17-95c5-ad30a52cb47b The MTF website and YouTube pages show performances from the Kids Hack, of participants presenting simple gestural controllers and instruments. Some of the older 'hackers' showed some more complex projects including a remote controlled Tricopter with a camera which was connected to some video goggles to navigate and film the Tricopters flight.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ssk3RKOJgY  Trackathon  Similar to a hackathon but for music producers, Music Tech Fest's trackathon gives musicians 24 hours, audio tools and samples with which to make a piece of music adhering to a unique challenge or brief set by the festival. For example, remixing a song by English indie rock band Everything Everything (London 2013) or making a 'sad banger' (Stockholm 2018). At MTF Stockholm the winning tracks were released as an album, the proceeds of which went to the charity Musicians Without Borders.  #MTFLabs  Music Tech Fest promotes cross-discipline communication and collaboration as a method of pushing innovation throughout the creative industries. #MTFLabs is typically a five- day event, in which hand-picked artists, scientists and inventors work on a single final performance, tying in a central theme such as fuzzification (Stockholm 2018) or vocal AI (Frankfurt 2019). #MTFLabs have been run in partnership with MIT Media Lab, Ars Electronica Future Lab, #MusicBricks, with participants such as Viktoria Modesta, Anouk Wipprecht, Eska, Reeps One, Moritz Waldemeyer, and have been covered by WIRED, Make, Radio Eins, Midem, and Makery.  MTF Scandinavia 2015  MTF Scandinavia took place in Ume√• Sweden from the 29‚Äì31 May 2015. The festival included presentations and performances from Jon Eades from Abbey Road Red, Abbey Road's new technology and innovation incubator, electronic artist Scanner, Robin Rimbaud and founder of English electronic group 808 State, Graham Massey. The 24hr Hack Camp had four hack challenges of which there were seven winning teams. Each challenge reflected the values and ideas spread by MTF; the 'Music Things for Music Ecosystems' and 'The Sound Objects in Smart Homes' challenge connected with ideas of collaboration and the Internet of Things, IoT. The Cymatics Challenge aimed to explore the relationships between sonic and visual art through this interdisciplinary medium. The final challenge from MTF Scandinavia was the 'Music as Communication' which focused on music tools that were communicative and accessible. Four winning teams used the #MusicBricks technologies which, led to the funding and incubation of their projects to develop them further. Incubation was also awarded to the two winning hacks from the 'Music Things for Music Ecosystems' and 'Music as Communication' prizes from Ume√• based incubators eXpression, and the final winning Cymatics team were awarded the materials to help with future endeavours. The Volvo Kids Hack ran on Sunday morning 10:00-12:00, led by Siobhan Ramsey of Sandbox Education, with presentations on stage in the afternoon at 14:00. Young Hackers, aged between 8-12 used tools from Arduino and Bare Conductive to create interactive instruments and musical interfaces. MTF Scandinavia also included two new editions, a Jam Camp which lasted the duration of the festival and a Trackathon which ran for a week. The Jam Camp, led by Obi Blanche, was a space for people to try out music technology and play together. This culminated in a Jam performance on stage on the final night of the festival. The trackathon was sponsored by Toontrack and was a competition to create a track using the Toontrack drum packages. The two winners of the challenge, CJ Carr and Matan Berkowitz had their tracks mastered and released on Bandcamp by members of the judging panel including Vince Lynch, Pascal Guyon and Phonat (Michele Balduzzi). All money raised went to a charity supporting artists suffering from depression. MTF Scandinavia was held at Sliperiet - a co-creative space in Ume√• Arts Campus where MTF is based, alongside many other creative enterprises. Throughout the weekend, organisations from Sliperiet put on sound installations around the upper floors of the building. These included ‚ÄòThe Voice Harvester‚Äô by Swedish ICT Interactive, ‚ÄòAudification of Absence‚Äô by Willem Zwagers,Willem Zwagers and ‚ÄòBubble Room Instrument‚Äô, ‚ÄòBridging Realities Collaborative‚Äô, ‚ÄòUntitled 5:22mins‚Äô and ‚ÄòSilent Forest‚Äô by JAQ. There were also two installations on the ground floor from outside of Sliperiet; James Brewster's Electro Acoustic Cafe, and ‚ÄòThe Worlds Biggest Midi Controller‚Äô by Hakan Lidbo. There was also a gamification workshop on Saturday, which led to the development of the CreaCity platform for the city of Ume√•, Sweden. CreaCity was released as part of the European SPECIFI project to develop tools for engagement with city culture and local businesses.

The app left MartianCraft's app in limbo for the foreseeable future. In 2013, MartianCraft launched their Briefs app. Briefs was initially launched as an iOS app in May 2013, and the tool was created for prototyping iOS apps. Macworld featured the app explaining that while the app wasn't for programming apps, explaining that it was therefore not a direct competitor to Apple's Xcode. At the time of release, Briefs was said to cost $199 and allowed the user to develop a working prototype of their app. Gizmodo featured MartianCraft writing on their blog about Apple's design changes when they launched OS X Yosemite. The analysis predominantly covered the icon changes Apple had made to their operating system. In February 2014, it was stated on Storify that the consultancy firm, Empirical Development were to merge. Following the announcement, one of the founders of Empirical Development featured in Fast Company, discussing the legacy app updates for iOS7. Later that month, MartianCraft acquired BitBQ, who were in control of the TouchPad and NumPad apps. TouchPad was then redesigned for iOS7 in 2014. The redesign came on the popular app, which was acquired by MartianCraft years earlier. Later in 2014, MartianCraft acquired the Denver-based software developer, Dragon Forged Software, which was founded in 2004. The software company had primarily focused on developing Apple-based software before their acquisition. MartianCraft therefore took over the control of Slender, Resolve, and Trivium. The final acquisition of 2014, came when Zarra Studios was acquired by MartianCraft. MartianCraft was named to the Inc. 5000 list as a fastest growing private company in 2015 and again in 2016. Briefs Following its release, Briefs was analysed by Fast Company. Briefs was put on hold by MartianCraft for nearly 3 years. After working on other projects, the app was accepted by Apple in 2013. While the project was delayed for a number of years, the creator stated that the delay had made the app better. It was stated that when Briefs was designed, it didn't want to affect the existing workflow, it would rather add to it. Briefs would be able to sit alongside tools designers and developers already use. The app was said to have taken influences from Final Cut Pro, Adobe Photoshop and also Adobe Illustrator. Briefs had an overall positive reception when it was released. The app was rated by Macworld 4 out of 5 in their official review. Publications Many members of staff of MartianCraft have written or been quoted in numerous publications. These have included Jeff LaMarche, Alan Bradburne, Kyle Richter, Joe Keeley, Dave Wood, Matt Henderson, Cory Bohon, Marcus Zarra, Kirby Turner, Michael Hay and Eric Blair. The majority of their publication coverage has been as authors, co-authors or technical reviewers.

From 1907 until his death he was Master of Downing College, Cambridge. Life Howard Marsh was born in 1839 in a small village in eastern England, near Bungay, on the Suffolk / Norfolk border. His father, Edward Brunning Marsh,The Cambridge Medical School: A Biographical History, Sir Humphry Davy Rolleston, 1932, pg 221 is described as a \\"gentleman farmer\\", of Homersfield, on the Waveney, Suffolk. His mother Maria, n√©e Haward, daughter of Charles and Maria,A Memoir of Howard Marsh, Violet Susan Marsh, Murray, 1921, pg 2 came from Brook, near Norwich. The Marsh family was 'old- established East Anglian farming stock', originally from Eye.A Memoir of Howard Marsh, Violet Susan Marsh, Murray, 1921, pg 1 He studied at St Bartholomew's Hospital (\\"Bart's\\") in London, where he signed on in December 1858, becoming a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in June 1861. He was appointed house surgeon at the hospital in 1862, working under Frederic Skey. He obtained his F.R.C.S. diploma in 1866 and in 1868 was appointed Administrator of Chloroform. He held a succession of progressively more senior appointments as assistant surgeon before eventually becoming a full surgeon in 1891. By this time he had already, since 1868, worked as a surgeon at the Hospital for Sick Children in Great Ormond Street (as it was then known) where he became full surgeon in 1879 and consulting surgeon in 1888. Also in the late 1860s Marsh became surgeon to the Queen Square House of Relief for Children with Chronic Disease of the Joints, an establishment founded \\"in great part through the exertions of Miss Perceval\\". Howard Marsh married Jane Perceval, daughter of Spencer Perceval, and the grand daughter of an assassinated British prime minister, in 1870. In 1903 Marsh was appointed Professor of Surgery at Cambridge University in belated succession to Sir George Murray Humphry (who had died in 1896). Marsh resigned from his post at Bart's and relocated to Cambridge, becoming a fellow of King's College. Four years later he relocated again, half a mile to the south, becoming Master of Downing College, Cambridge. As Master of Downing College Marsh resisted government pressure to restrict access for students from India, then an important British Colony. Approximately one third of all Indian students attending Cambridge University during the early years of the twentieth century chose Downing College: Marsh attributed this to the college's reputation for excellent teaching of law, a subject favoured by India's burgeoning mercantile classes. Government pressure was part of a wider political strategy to limit anti-colonial activism in British universities. After consulting with fellow members of the college governing body Marsh politely rejected the British minister's request to restrict admissions in a way which would have been \\"a rebuff to Indian students\\". Family Marsh was father to the polymath Edward Marsh and father-in-law of the controversial general and writer, Frederick Barton Maurice. A grand daughter was the economist Joan Robinson.

It is located in an architecturally distinguished Colonial Revival building at 34 Mount Desert Street in the town's main village. The building was built in 1910-11, donated to the community by Mrs. Morris K. Jesup in memory of her late husband, both of them longtime summer residents of the area, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 for its architecture. Architecture and history The Jesup Library is set on the south side of Mount Desert Street (Maine State Route 3), about one block west of Bar Harbor's village green. It is a single-story brick building, with a slate hip roof. Its front facade is five bays wide, with a centered entrance recessed in a limestone arch flanked by paired pilasters, and a medallion above the doorway depicting an open book. The flanking bays have sash windows topped by rounded limestone panels with bullseye insets. The roof cornice is modillioned, and a pair of chimneys rise from the interior. The windows on the sides have a similar treatment to those on the front. An ell extends from the center of the rear, giving the building a T shape. Bar Harbor's first library was organized by summer residents in 1875, and was at first a very small affair, operating out of people's homes before a small library building was built in 1877. By the early 1900s the library collection had grown to more than 8,000 volumes. Mrs. Morris K. Jesup, a longtime Bar Harbor summer resident, funded the $70,000 to build this building, and gave a $50,000 endowment for its maintenance. It was designed by the New York City firm of Delano and Aldrich and built in 1910-11.

It began in March 2014 and was initially headed by investigative judge S√©rgio Moro, and in 2019 by Judge . It has resulted in more than a thousand warrants of various types. According to the Operation Car Wash task force, investigations implicate administrative members of the state-owned oil company Petrobras, politicians from Brazil's largest parties (including presidents of the Republic), presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate, state governors, and businessmen from large Brazilian companies. The Federal Police consider it the largest corruption investigation in the country's history. Originally a money laundering investigation, it expanded to cover allegations of corruption at Petrobras, where executives allegedly accepted bribes in return for awarding contracts to construction firms at inflated prices. This criminal scheme was initially known as (Portuguese for \\"big oil\\") because of the Petrobras scandal. The investigation is called \\"Operation Car Wash\\" because it was first uncovered at a car wash in Bras√≠lia. The aim of the investigation is to ascertain the extent of a money laundering scheme, estimated by the Regional Superintendent of the Federal Police of Paran√° State in 2015 at (US$‚Äì billion), largely through the embezzlement of Petrobras funds. It has included more than a thousand warrants for search and seizure, temporary and preventive detention, and plea bargaining, against business figures and politicians in numerous parties. At least eleven other countries were involved, mostly in Latin America, and the Brazilian company Odebrecht was deeply implicated.Kurtenbach, S., & Nolte, D. (2017). Latin America's Fight against Corruption: The End of Impunity. GIGA Focus Lateinamerika, (03). Investigators indicted and jailed some well-known politicians, including former presidents Fernando Collor de Mello, Michel Temer and Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva. The scandal seemed to challenge the impunity of politicians and business leaders and the structural corruption in the political and economic system that had prevailed until then. This was initially thought possible because of the independence of the judiciary. However, documents leaked in June 2019 to Glenn Greenwald at The Intercept suggest that Judge S√©rgio Moro may have been partial in his decisions, passing on 'advice, investigative leads, and inside information to the prosecutors' to 'prevent Lula‚Äôs Workers‚Äô Party from winning' the 2018 elections. Several top jurisprudence authorities and experts in the world have reacted to the leaks by describing former President Lula as a political prisoner and calling for his release. Lula was ultimately released on 8 November 2019.  Investigation  The initial accusation came from businessman Hermes Magnus in 2008, who reported an attempt to launder money through his company, Dunel Ind√∫stria e Com√©rcio, a manufacturer of electronic components. Ensuing investigations culminated in the identification of four large criminal rings, headed by: , Alberto Youssef, , and Raul Henrique Srour. Investigation at first focused on the four black-market currency dealers and improper payments to Alberto Youssef by companies who had won contracts at Petrobras' Abreu and Lima refinery. After they discovered that \\"doleiro\\" (black-market dealer) Alberto Youssef had acquired a Range Rover Evoque for , a former director of Petrobras, the investigation expanded nationwide. Costa agreed after he was charged to provide evidence to the investigation.Kamm, T. (2015). Making sense of Brazil‚Äôs Lava Jato scandal. Brunswick Group, April. A newly adopted law introduced 'rewarded collaboration' () a type of plea bargaining involving sentence reductions for defendants who cooperate in investigations. Costa's deposition showed which political parties controlled Petrobras.Arruda de Almeida, M., & Zagaris, B. (2015). Political Capture in the Petrobus Corruption Scandal: The Sad Tale of an Oil Giant. Fletcher F. World Aff., 39, 87. It also led to a wave of arrests. Fernando Soares, also known as \\"Fernando Baiano,\\" a businessman and lobbyist, was allegedly the connection between major Brazilian construction firms and the government formed by the Workers‚Äô Party (PT) and Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB). After Costa and Soares, many others agreed to collaborate with the prosecution and between 2014 and February 2016, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office () filed 37 criminal charges against 179 people, mostly politicians and businessmen.Fausto, S. (2017). The Lengthy Brazilian Crisis Is Not Yet Over. Issue Brief, 2. In December 2017, nearly three hundred people had been accused of crimes in the scandal. After Marcelo Odebrecht, grandson of the company founder, was sentenced to 19 years in prison, he and other Odebrecht executives were willing to act as witnesses and to give information about the broader corruption scheme, because of the sentence reduction incentives of the 'rewarded collaboration' law. Odebrecht had a secret branch used to make illegal payments in several Latin American countries, from Hugo Ch√°vez in Venezuela to Ricardo Martinelli in Panama. Odebrecht was charged with fines totalling $2.6 billion by authorities of Brazil, Switzerland, and the United States after they admitted bribing officials in twelve countries for some $788 million. Costa and Youssef entered into a plea bargain with prosecutors and the scope of the investigation widened to nine major Brazilian construction firms: Camargo Correa, , , Odebrecht, , , , , and , as well as politicians involved with Petrobras. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, who chaired the board of Petrobras from 2003 to 2010, denied knowledge of any wrongdoing. The Brazilian Supreme Court authorized the investigation of 48 current and former legislators, including former President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, in March 2016. Eduardo Cunha, president of the Chamber of Deputies from 2015 to 2016, was convicted of taking approximately $40 million in bribes and hiding funds in secret bank accounts and sentenced to 15 years in prison. On 19 January 2017, a small plane carrying Supreme Court Justice Teori Zavascki crashed into the sea near the tourist city of Paraty in the state of Rio de Janeiro, killing the magistrate and four other people. Zavascki had been handling Operation Car Wash corruption trials. A Miami Herald report noted in September 2017 that when Operation Car Wash began, fewer than 10,000 electronic monitoring bracelets were in use to enforce home detentions sentences; by September 2017 the number had ballooned to more than 24,000. Caption to the photo within the article by Andre Penner of the AP  Effect on Petrobras  Petrobras delayed reporting its annual financial results for 2014, and in April 2015 released \\"audited financial statements\\" showing $2.1 billion in bribes and a total of almost $17 billion in write-downs due to graft and overvalued assets, which the company characterized as a \\"conservative\\" estimate. Had the report been delayed by another week, Petrobras bondholders would have had the right to demand early repayment. Petrobras also suspended dividend payments for 2015. Due in part to the impact of the scandal, as well as to its high debt burden and the low price of oil, Petrobras was also forced to cut capital expenditures and announced it would sell $13.7 billion in assets over the following two years.  Domestic politics  * The treasurer of the Workers' Party (PT), Jo√£o Vaccari Neto, was arrested for receiving \\"irregular donations\\". * The former chief of staff for President Lula, Jos√© Dirceu, was arrested for organising a large part of the bribery. * The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Eduardo Cunha (PMDB-RJ), investigated for receiving more than US$40 million in kickbacks and bribes. * Former president and current Senator Fernando Collor de Mello, of the Christian- conservative Christian Labour Party (PTC), was charged with corruption. On 8 March 2016, Marcelo Odebrecht, CEO of Odebrecht and grandson of the company's founder, was sentenced to 19 years in prison after being convicted of paying more than $30 million in bribes to Petrobras executives. In April 2018, former president Lu√≠z In√°cio Lula da Silva ‚Äì after having been sentenced for passive corruption and money laundering in relation to a luxury apartment in Guaruj√° received from Grupo OAS ‚Äì entered prison in Curitiba to serve his 12 year sentence. However, illegal communications between Car Wash prosecutors and its lead judge came to light in mid-2019, in which the parties suggested that their prosecutorial motive was to prevent Lula's re-election. There were calls to release the former president (see Leaked conversations below). As a result, he was released on 8 November 2019 after a supreme court ruling. On 3 July 2018, failed Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista was convicted of bribing former Rio de Janeiro governor S√©rgio Cabral for state government contracts, having paid Cabral US$16.6 million, and was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment.Biller, David \\"Former Brazil Billionaire Batista Hit With 30-Year Sentence,\\" Bloomberg News, 3 July 2018. Retrieved 3 July 2018. = Political parties =  Lula and the Worker's Party  Em√≠lio Odebrecht said in a written report to the Attorney General of Brazil's Office (PGR) that he discussed donations to Worker's Party's (PT) campaigns with former PT president Lula. Financial support, according to the contractor, came even before Lula became president. Marcelo Odebrecht said that the \\"Amigo\\" account for former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, was created in 2010 with a balance of R$40 million. In his statement, he said he gave the money to Antonio Palocci, former Finance Minister and Rousseff's chief of staff, who had been the PT contact with Odebrecht since the prior administration, when and Pedro Novis had handled payments. He said that in the middle of 2010, at the end of the Lula administration, he knew that Dilma Rousseff was going to take over and that the balance of the account would be \\"managed by her at her request\\". Thus, he set apart a sum that would be destined exclusively for the former president. He said that Lula never asked directly for donations and that everything was done through Palocci, but it became clear that the donations were ultimately for the former president. On 4 March 2016, Lula was questioned for three hours as part of the fraud inquiry into the dealings of Petrobras, and his house raided by federal police agents. Lula, who left office in 2011, denied allegations of corruption. Police said they had evidence that Lula, 70, had received kickbacks. Lula's institute called actions against him \\"arbitrary, illegal and unjustifiable\\", since he had been cooperating with the investigations.BBC News Brazil Petrobras scandal: Former president Lula questioned Lula, convicted of accepting bribes worth 3.7 million reals (1.2 million dollars), was sentenced on 12 July to nine and a half years in prison. He appealed the sentence to the Federal Regional Court-4, which increased his sentence to twelve years and a month. On 5 April 2018, Moro ordered his imprisonment, and he surrendered two days later.  Temer and Brazilian Democratic Movement  The plea bargain testimony by Odebrecht Engenharia Industrial's former president M√°rcio Faria da Silva said that on 15 July 2010, President Michel Temer led a meeting about an agreement to pay approximately US$40 million in bribes to the Brazilian Democratic Movement in exchange for contracts with the international Board of Directors of Petrobras. According to Faria, Temer, who at the time was a candidate for vice-president on Dilma Rousseff's ticket, delegated to Eduardo Cunha and Henrique Eduardo Alves, then deputies and present at the meeting, the task of making the payments which represented 5% of the contract's value. The meeting took place in Temer's political office in S√£o Paulo. He did not discuss any details about the financial agreement, limiting himself to trivial conversations about politics.  A√©cio and Brazilian Social Democracy Party  Marcelo Odebrecht said in his plea bargain testimony that the Social Democratid (PSDB) party, led by Senator A√©cio Neves (PSDB-MG), received at least 50 million reals in exchange for favoring the business contractor in energy deals. He said that improper payments were made due to business deals with two state companies: Furnas and Cemig. The first federal investigation was under the leadership of Dimas Toledo, an ally of Neves, in the early years of the Lula administration (2003‚Äì2005). The second state-run investigation was influenced by A√©cio during the period when the PSDB was in power in Minas Gerais (2003‚Äì2014). = Political families = Odebrecht also discussed family involvement. In eleven cases under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Federal Court (STF), investigations implicate father and son, husband and wife, or siblings. The president of the Chamber, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), has the most family members implicated. Maia was charged in the same investigation as his father, councilor and former mayor Cesar Maia. According to the Odebrecht testimony, Rodrigo obtained cash resources both for his father's campaign and also for himself. The Brazilian Democratic Movement leader of the Senate, Renan Calheiros (AL), was charged along with his son, the governor of Alagoas Renan Filho (PMDB), in two inquiries. They allegedly participated in an agreement to divert resources from work on the Canal do Sert√£o and also received resources in the form of a slush fund they refer to as a caixa 2. In the case of the father, two other inquiries are ongoing. The governor of Rio Grande do Norte, Robinson Faria (PSD), was charged along with his son, federal deputy F√°bio Faria (PSD-RN). The two allegedly received contributions through a slush fund in return for defending Odebrecht Ambiental's interests in the area of basic sanitation in the state. The president of the PMDB, Senator Romero Juc√° (RR), and his son Rodrigo Juc√° both figured in one of the inquiries. The father helped Odebrecht negotiate a provisional measure and obtained an electoral donation of 150,000 reals for his son. Romero Juc√° was also charged in four other inquiries. A father asking for a contribution for a son was also why former minister Jos√© Dirceu was investigated along with , federal deputy. The father was able to raise the money for Zeca in exchange for the acting for Odebrecht interests in the government. In the Chamber of Deputies, the sons Ant√¥nio Britto (PSD-BA) and (PMDB-GO) were also investigated along with their parents, (PTB-BA) and Maguito Vilela (PMDB-GO). Senator K√°tia Abreu (PMDB-TO) was accompanied by her husband Mois√©s Pinto Gomes, who brokered cash payments for her in 2014. Senator Vanessa Grazziotin (PCdoB-AM) is accompanied by her husband, , said to have asked for slush fund cash donations for her. Federal Deputy (PT-SC) also requested slush funds for the Blumenau municipal campaign in 2012 of his wife, state deputy Ana Paula Lima (PT-SC). The Viana brothers of Acre, Governor Ti√£o Viana (PT) and Senator Jorge Viana (PT), were also charged together.

They were released in April 2017 after a judge ruled they had cooperated with the investigation and ordered them each to pay $500,000 in bail. = Peru = During the Peruvian presidential election in February 2016, a report by the Brazilian Federal Police implicated President Ollanta Humala in bribery by Odebrecht for public works contracts. President Humala denied the charge and has avoided questions from the media on this matter. In July 2017, Humala and his wife were arrested and held in pre-trial detention following investigations into his involvement in the Odebrecht scandal. Investigations revealed that Brazilian president Lula da Silva pressured Odebrecht to pay millions of dollars toward Humala's presidential campaign. In December 2017 Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski appeared before Congress to defend himself against impeachment over allegations of covering up illegal payments of $782,000 from Odebrecht to Kuczynski's company Westfield Group Capital Ltd. Keiko Fujimori, who had lost the 2016 presidential elections to Kuczynski by a margin of fewer than 50,000 votes, was championing impeachment; her party had already forced out five government ministers. Fujimori herself was later implicated in the Odebrecht scandal over alleged campaign contributions and on 31 October 2018 a judge sent her to 36 months of pretrial detention. Kuczynski resigned the Presidency on 21 March 2018 and was sent to pretrial detention on 10 April 2019. On 17 April 2019, Alan Garc√≠a, a former President of Peru who was also implicated in the scandal, died by suicide from shooting himself in the head while police attempted to arrest him.\\"Alan Garc√≠a: Peru's former president kills himself ahead of arrest\\", BBC, 17 April 2019. Retrieved 31 May 2019. Former president Alejandro Toledo (2001‚Äì2006) was also implicated in the bribery scandal, and was arrested in Redwood City, California in July 2019 for allegedly taking bribes in connection with a highway construction contract. = Venezuela = In late 2017, Euzenando Prazeres de Azevedo, president of Constructora Odebrecht in Venezuela, told investigators that Odebrecht had made $35 million in campaign contributions to Nicolas Maduro's 2013 presidential campaign in return for Odebrecht projects receiving priority in Venezuela, that Americo Mata, Maduro's campaign manager, initially asked for $50 million for Maduro, settled in the end for $35 million. In May 2018, Transparency International showed that only 9 of 33 projects started by Odebrecht in Venezuela between 1999 and 2013 were completed.  Leaked conversations  On 9 June 2019, Greenwald and other journalists from investigative journalism magazine The Intercept Brasil started publishing several leaked chat messages exchanged via the Telegram app between members of the Brazilian judiciary system. Some, including then Car Wash judge and former Minister of Justice S√©rgio Moro and lead prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol are accused of violating legal procedure during the investigation, trial and arrest of former president Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva allegedly for the sake of preventing him to run for a third term in the 2018 Brazilian general election, among other crimes. Other news agencies, such as Folha de S√£o Paulo and Veja confirmed the authenticity of the messages and worked in partnership with The Intercept Brasil to sort the rest of the material in their possession before releasing it. On 23 July, Brazilian Federal Police made public that they had arrested and were investigating Araraquara hacker Walter Delgatti Neto for breaking into the authorities' Telegram accounts. Neto confessed to the hack and to having given the chat logs to Greenwald. Police said the attack had been perpetrated by abusing Telegram's phone number verification and exploiting vulnerabilities in voicemail technology in use in Brazil using a spoofed phone number. The Intercept neither confirmed nor denied that Neto was their source and cited provisions for freedom of the press in the 1988 Brazilian Constitution. Greenwald has faced death threats and homophobic harassment from supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro due to his reporting on the Telegram messages. A New York Times profile of Greenwald and his husband David Miranda, a left-wing congressman, said the couple have become targets of homophobia from Bolsonaro supporters as a result of the reporting. The Washington Post reported that Greenwald had been targeted with tax investigations by the Bolsonaro government as retaliation for the reporting, while AP called Greenwald's reporting the first test case for a free press in the Bolsonaro era. The Guardian, reporting on retaliation against Greenwald from the Bolsonaro government and its supporters, said the articles published by Greenwald and The Intercept \\"have had an explosive impact on Brazilian politics and dominated headlines for weeks,\\" adding that the expos√©s \\"appeared to show prosecutors in the sweeping Operation Car Wash corruption inquiry colluding with S√©rgio Moro, the judge who became a hero in Brazil for jailing powerful businessmen, middlemen and politicians.\\" After Bolsonaro explicitly threatened to imprison Greenwald for this reporting, Supreme Court justice Gilmar Mendes ruled that any investigation of Greenwald in connection with the reporting would be illegal under Brazilian constitution, calling freedom of the press a \\"pillar of democracy\\". Glenn Greenwald reported that the leaked file is bigger than the one in the Snowden case. Fernando Haddad considered the leaks to have potential to become the \\"greatest institutional scandal in the history of the Brazilian republic\\". In response to the leaks, several top jurisprudence authorities and experts in Europe and the Americas, such as Susan Rose-Ackerman (praised by Car Wash prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol as the world's top corruption expert), Bruce Ackerman, and Luigi Ferrajoli, voiced their shock at the conduct of the Brazilian authorities and described former President Lula as a political prisoner, calling for his release.  Legal aspects in 2019  The decision against Aldemir Bendine was annulled by the Supreme Federal Court due to objections to the trial procedure.  Winding down  As of September 2020, there were fears that political forces were about to bring an end to Operation Car Wash, according to prosecutors in Brazil. Chief prosectuor Deltan Dallagnol said, \\"Today there is a very strong alignment of political forces against the Lava Jato operation. Much more than [just] an operation, the Brazilian effort against corruption itself is at risk.\\" One of the reasons Jair Bolsonaro was elected president in 2018, was because of his promises to attack corruption, but since he and his family members became embroiled, he has cooled on it. Bolsonaro's attorney general Augusto Aras complained that the investigations went to far, and were biased politically, and campaigned against it, gaining support from Bolsonaro family members such as son Flavio who was caught up in it. Dallagnol claimed that the slow down and efforts to stop the investigations were because the investigations were getting close to revealing corruption at the highest levels. Other branches of government also oppose the investigations, including Congress and the Supreme Court, which have been targets, as well as political parties such as the Worker's Party, which was a target of the investigations which ultimately toppled Lula da Silva from the presidency. Analysts see a concerted effort to back down from aggressive anti-corruption efforts in Brazil.  Dramatizations  There are two dramatizations of Operation Car Wash. One is the 2017 film Pol√≠cia Federal: A Lei √â para Todos (Federal Police: The Law Is for Everyone), directed by Marcelo Antunez (2017), and the other is the Netflix series The Mechanism. The Netfllix documentary and Academy Award nominee The Edge of Democracy, by Petra Costa (2019), about the political crisis between 2016 and the election of Jair Bolsonaro, in 2018, has Operation Car Wash as an important character as well.

Akerbeltz or Aker (from the Basque language: Aker, billy goat and Beltz, black) is a spirit in the folk mythology of the Basque people. It is said to live inside the land and is believed to have as many elves as servants. In Christianity, Akerbeltz is considered the live image of the devil, performing sexual abuses against members of Christian covens. Contemporary belief holds that Akerbeltz was an ancient deity who protected animals. The billy goat was adored in other European countries as well as the Basque Country. Some beliefs about this mythological creature have endured. During history and in other mythologies Pierre de Lancrek, an inquisitor who went looking for women from Labourd and Lower Navarre who were supposed to be witches, wrote a book called Tableu de I¬¥Inostance in which he documented the testimony of a supposed witch: \\"Akerbeltz has a man's face, big and terrifying\\". Another witch said that he had two faces, one in front and the other one in the back. In words of other inquisitors, Akerbeltz was similar to an enormous dog or to a big ox which is incorrect or lies. This last case could be related to the myth of the Aatxe (another creature of the Basque mythology). As men who look for witches said, Aker gave a parody of the Catholic mass to his followers, and during the mass, they offer him eggs, bread and money. In the mass explained before, Aker gave a parody sermon, and after that speech, he organised a lunch with his witches and elves. In that lunch it was served human-meat and his horns functioned as gigantic candles. To continue with the celebration, Aker and his followers danced together with the sound of a tabor. And finally, the witches made their spells. Folklorists say that Akerbeltz was similar to some ancient deities such as Dionysus, in terms of excesses, and Pan, in terms of sexual abuses. Jose Miguel Barandiaran, who investigated and compiled the Basque culture, said that the picture of Akerbeltz was similar to Mari (another spirit from the Basque mythology) because they had some characteristics in common. There were some other beliefs which say that he was the animals' and houses' protector, and he had the power for treating the animals. He was also the life image of the fertility. And as he was black, many people from the Basque Country had had a black billy-goat in their stable in order to protect the rest of the animals. Tales *He had the power for creating storms and to dress the animals he had under his care. That is why in some Baserri they used to have a billy- goat. *He was supposed to be in the entrance of the caves of Zugarramurdi where elves, lamia, and witches met. Once a priest entered in a cave with a host. While he was touching the gold he was wearing, a snake appeared and ate his hands so he left the cave without hands. From inside the cave some mysterious voices could be heard, and they said :\\" thanks what you were wearing in your chest, because if not you will have to stay here\\". After this, it can be heard a Basque saying which says: \\"Auza, han baduk gauza; baina neok ezin har\\". *Neighbours from Baigorri say that Aker's ghost lived in some caves in the area. *In Urepel, from the Biurretabuxtan baserri Juan Monakok said that there was a cave full of gold, and near that gold there were a snake and Aker. Many times had a priest gone praying to the cave so that the snake and Akerbeltz go, but they have never gone from there. Other beliefs *Black billy-goats have always been very valuable in Aragon and in the Basque Pyrenees because as the myths say, they can take care of the rest of the animals and the house. *People from the Pyrenees thought that witches, Akerbeltz and the demon could go to any house and take the beard from a billy- goat in order to make hail. That is the reason why in Freser they have always said: \\"A la casa han tosa la cabra, aquesta tarde tindrem pedra\\"; \\"They have cut the billy goat's beard, this afternoon it is going to hail\\".

When applied to thangkas of significant cultural heritage, this activity is generally undertaken by a conservator-restorer. Thangkas are scroll painting that are vertical in format, usually in a size that is easy rolled up, often about half to one and a half meters high, although large thangkas for special ceremonies can require dozens of people to unroll and display them. Like religious wall paintings, thangkas are considered to function as intermediaries between the mortal and divine worlds. The thangka started off as a traditional Nepalese art form. This form was originally exported to Tibet after Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal married Songts√§n Gampo. In the early days, these painted scrolls became very popular with travelling monks because of their portability. During the Ming (1368 ‚Äì 1644) and Qing (1644 ‚Äì 1912) Dynasty, the painting of thangkas flourished in Tibet.  Ethical considerations  Thangkas on the wall during a Tibetan Buddhist puja Some early conservation treatment of thangkas involved the following well-intentioned mistakes: # removed and discarded the mounting altogether and treated the painting with methods appropriate for a Western oil painting; including matting and framing the painting in a Western aesthetic # removed and discarded the mounting and treated the painting with methods appropriate for a Chinese or Japanese scroll painting on silk or paper, then mounted the painting in a scroll-painting aesthetic # left the painting in the mounting and lined it in-situ with a method appropriate for a Western-style painting # in-painted without an understanding of the iconography or original painting methods # left the painting in place in the mounting and trimmed the top and bottom dowels off, then framed the entire thangka in a traditional Western- style frame # removed and discarded the cover # given every mounting a strong chemical treatment for bacterial growth, when perhaps mild cleaning, airing, and proper display and storage would have sufficed # lined the paintings with an aqueous adhesive mixture of animal glue and wheat flour, risking moisture penetrating the ground and paint layers from behind. Before undertaking conservation, it is important for conservators to take into consideration the iconographic content and social significance. Ideally, no aspect of the treatment must compromise the original purpose of the object. To acquire and apply this attitude of respect requires extensive research into the cultural significance of the object to be treated and the materials and methods of its construction. Such research requires informants from the culture, both artists and religious authorities. Conservators need also to recognize that the brocade and the mounting technique are integral to the piece, and must retain these elements as much as possible.  Different types of thangkas  Traditional painted Thangkas were composed using mineral and vegetable pigments in a hide glue medium, with silk brocade borders becoming common during the early Ming and Qing period. Contemporary Thangkas are typically painted in gouache on cotton fabric. Apart from the typical paint on cotton fabric thangkas, the following types of thangkas were also available: # The dpar ma, woodblock printed thangka that is produced on a canvas. A wood block is engraved with the painting outline before printed onto the canvas. This simplifies the painting process and gives special effects. # The metal thangka, whose durability and foldable concept was to serve travelling needs. # The Papier-m√¢ch√© thangka which is unique for the three-dimensional appearance of the central picture. # The tshen drub ma, embroidered thangka which is typically executed in the far eastern part of Tibet and China for trade export. # The woven thangka. This form of thangka was created in the post-1950s period due to the lack of traditional thangka-painting artists at that time. # The dras-drab-ma, gos-sku, appliqu√© thangka which consists of many single pieces of cloth in a thangka.  Typical damages to thangkas  = Physical and mechanical damage = The thangka is devised to be conveniently rolled for transportation and this is a source of physical and mechanical damage. Rolling compresses and abrades the surface and abrasion is aggravated when the cover is missing. It is not an easy task to roll it with all its different components and more so if it is distorted. Moreover, the various components of the thangka rarely have the same composition or thickness. Consequently, when it is rolled, the pressure is unequal on all the parts which results in the occurrence of folds and creases. These folds and creases are destructive because they form areas of weakness. Large thangkas are at higher risk of such damage. The most susceptible element of these multi-media painted scrolls is their cloth borders, often made of silk brocade. The silk is vulnerable and quickly weakened by the damp walls of the monastery, the weight of the painting, and the weight of the heavy bottom rod, which easily fractures the cloth borders, especially with the repeated rolling and unrolling of the paintings for display. The borders are typically the first of the complex structure to fail. The condition is further aggravated by thangka construction. The weight difference between the central picture and the borders, and the weight of the heavy bottom rod, creates tension from all directions. Repeated rolling and unrolling further enhance the extent of fractures. Thangkas are constructed by stitching, which creates potential areas of weakness because the fabric is pierced and compressed. When stitching threads degrade more rapidly than the fabric, the overall fragility in the structure is increased. The tension caused by weight differences between the central picture and the borders, the weight of the heavy bottom rod, further enhance the extent of fractures. The borders are usually the first to fail, as they get separated from each other and from the central picture; losses in borders are common and original borders are rare. The upper borders are usually at highest risk. Creasing in the lining has been observed as well; the main cause has been suggested to be due to the dimension of the lining being greater than the thangka, which may be an original concept in thangka construction. = Display conditions= When thangkas are on display in their original Tibetan settings, they were exposed to soot and airborne debris from burning butter lamp and incense. Although butter or oil was sometimes spread over the painted thangka in an attempt to preserve it, the accumulation of dirt and grease darkens the surface and can obliterate the image and the colors beneath. Besides being difficult to remove, the presence of butter or oil in the fibers accelerate fiber degradation. = Damp conditions = Conservation image showing water damage and tidelines The source of dampness can be relative humidity, water in the walls, sprinkled holy water, or water in the adhesive materials used during treatment. Water damage may show up as bleeding of colours, leaving tidelines. The different materials on the thangkas respond differently to changes in relative humidity, and therefore causing dimensional stresses and distortion. = Light = There are three types of light: ultraviolet (UV) light, infrared radiation and visible light. All three types are harmful to artifacts and the damage caused by all light is cumulative and irreversible. Exposure to light in all forms causes a chemical reaction to happen within the molecular level of an artifact. Light exposure can cause textiles to weaken and fade, dyes and paints to darken or change color, and paper to become weak, bleached, yellowed or darkened. Therefore, thangkas are chemically and physically altered when exposed to light. The ultraviolet in light hastens fibre and dye degradation through photo- oxidation. = Pests = Pests can cause severe damage to thangkas. Animal pests such rats and birds can physically attack thangkas for food or nesting materials or soil them with droppings. Insect pests are commonly found on thangkas because of the organic nature of these scroll paintings. Mould grows easily on cellulosic fabrics, decomposing them and the attack can easily spread to other textiles. Tell-tale signs of mould damage include musty odour, presence of black or white powdery growth, yellow or multi-coloured stains, and condensation. = Losses = Often the veils, ribbons and mountings, or rods have been lost. Some possible explanations are that they were discarded when they become severely deteriorated and were not replaced. But there are also times when they were intentionally removed. The mounting may be removed to enable transport out of the country. Dealers or collectors or the museum sometimes remove them for particular reasons.  Conservation treatments  Prior to conducting conservation treatments, conservators should always conduct scientific investigation on the original materials used. The conservator is responsible for choosing materials and methods appropriate to the objectives of each specific treatment and consistent with currently accepted practice. The advantages of the materials and methods chosen must be balanced against their potential adverse effects on future examination, scientific investigation, treatment, and function. Conservator should also ensure the treatment procedures and materials used are properly documented. The following details typical treatment methods for thangkas: = Separation = The original sewing used to attach the thangka to the textile border was carefully unpicked and retain the original sewing thread. This is to separate the thangka paintings (typically done in paper) with their textile borders, and ensure that each component is properly treated with a suitable procedure. = Removal of previous repair stitching = The purpose was to remove damaging and disfiguring repair on the thangka and its lining. By doing this, re-stitching of vulnerable areas could be done. = Surface clean = Cleaning can improve the aesthetics of the thangka and aid its interpretation, which may be difficult when dirt accumulates. Besides, removal of soiling facilitates good contact and bonding between the silk and support in the adhesive treatment. It will also reduce the risk of further soiling penetration into the silk during humidification. = Humidification = Humidification introduces moisture in the form of water vapour into the thangka to relax the fibers quickly. It is then followed by drying and flattening under precisely controlled conditions such as sandwiching the thangka between sheets of a blotting material and under fairly heavy weight to prevent cockling. = Pest eradication = Pests infestations such as beetles and frass are common in thangka due to its organic nature. A common method for removing pests are fumigation with nitrogen in a Controlled Atmosphere Treatment (CAT). This gas creates an asphyxiation effect on the target insect pests such as cloth moth (Tineola sp.), silverfish (Lepisma saccharina) and other textile pests. This fumigation method is known as CAT (Controlled Atmosphere Treatment) and is widely use in the conservation of antiques, artifacts and valuable books. = Relining = When the original support/fabric of the components is too weak, brittle or torn, unable to serve its purpose, it will be necessary to support a structurally unsound thangka. It would be necessary to take into account the spiritual character of the thangka and to maintain the possibility of a religious traditional use, thus allowing for a traditional vertical display. The relining had to be flexible enough to allow rolling and unrolling, even if this would not necessarily be the case after treatment. It also had to allow visual access to the back, to read the inscription which is part of the consecration of the thangka and confers its spiritual presence. = Loss compensation = Certain losses can disrupt one's ability to interpret the thangka or appreciate it. Ethically loss compensation and/or total replacement has been done to safeguard the design or the form of the art. It aims to preserve the significance and values that have been diminished by losses. This is where conceptual integrity takes precedence over material integrity . However, conservators must ensure any intervention to compensate for loss should be detectable by common examination methods. Such compensation should be reversible and should not falsely modify the known aesthetic, conceptual, and physical characteristics of the cultural property, especially by removing or obscuring original material. = Mounting = The mounting is an inherent part of the thangka. And as it is important both structurally and symbolically, an attempt is always made to save it. It may be possible to ascertain if the current mounting is, in fact, the original by close examination of the edges of the main panel. The presence of several rows of stitch holes can indicate that the mounting has been changed. If the original mounting is no longer suitable to be reuse, conservators can seek similar design textile borders or silk brocades and dye it to the same color as the original. The color and design of textile borders and silk brocades plays an important role in complimenting the thangka painting. = Preventive conservation = Prevention is better than cure. The factors that aggravate deterioration have been considered and favorable conditions for preservation and measures for protection against future damage have been instigated. The following are preventive measures for the care of thangkas: # The use of two thick ribbons, slightly shorter than the thangka, stitched to the ends of both rods on the reverse side of the thangka, to prevent the lower rod from straining the thangka. # The rolling of the thangka to be done on a flat surface and not in hanging position to minimise creasing, rolling carefully but firmly on the lower rod. # The practice of display rotation as opposed to permanent displays, in order to achieve long term preservation. This has been justified on the grounds that it is usual practice in temple or monastery to put the thangka on only on special occasions and that such practice in effect preserved the thangka. # The use of showcases to prevent the accumulation of dirt. # The use of appropriate lighting and light levels. # The provision of handling instructions, condition checklist and display recommendations such as restrictions on traditional sprinkling of water to minimize the problems. # Use of inert materials for storage and display. Storage methods  Archival Box Storage for long-term preservation has also been developed with the consideration of the various needs of the thangka. The following are some of the recommendations. # Storage of thangkas individually in flat position archival grade boxes lined with acid-free paper. # Ensure micro-climate in storage place is suitable such as through the use of silica gel. # Rolled on dowels with 2\\" of soft padding. The soft padding is to accommodate cockles in the painting, and large diameter to reduce the curvature of the rolled painting. The dowels are suspended in clam shell archival boxes so that the weight of the thangka is not carried by parts of the painting. The clam shell boxes protect the thangkas from dust, light and pressure and allow efficient use of storage space. # Ensure storage conditions are clean from pests and mould. # Ensure the storage location temperature is kept constant at approximately 24 Degree Celsius.

The New York Times described a microadventure as \\"short, perspective-shifting bursts of travel closer to home, inspiring followers to pitch a tent in nearby woods, explore their city by moonlight, or hold a family slumber party in the backyard.\\" The concept is flexible enough in its definition to allow the individual to choose the location, duration, and overall scope of the adventure. Microadventures are generally considered affordable in that little to no specialized gear is required, travel costs are trivial or nonexistent, and only a minimal amount of provisions are needed for the outing. Often participants will sleep out under the stars using a bivvy bag, rather than a tent, and wild swims are actively encouraged. Microadventures have proved popular with people whose lives are busy with work and/or family commitments. The Collins Dictionary blog recognised 'microadventure' as a neologism in April 2014. Microadventure is popular as an online hashtag, used on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to share microadventure experiences.  Publications  In 2012, Humphreys was nominated a National Geographic Adventurer of the year for his campaign to involve ordinary people in microadventures. Humphreys published a microadventures book in June 2014, which documents a series of \\"short, inexpensive trips\\" around the UK. For 2015, Humphreys put together a 'Year of Microadventure', a calendar suggesting activities for followers to take part in once a month, all-year-round. Microadventures have been discussed on both BBC Radio 5Live and Talk Sport. In the US, Outside Magazine described \\"The Benefits of Microadventure\\" in a series of articles written of \\"A Quest to Boost Happiness\\".

In Helsing√∏r, tradition since at least the late 18th century located \\"Hamlet's grave\\" just north of what is now H√∏jstrup halt. Touristic interest in visiting Hamlet's Grave arose in the 1850s. By that time, a stone obelisk marked Hamlet's Grave in the park of Marienlyst Castle (), on an old fortification on the crest of a hill.\\"Hamlet's Grave, Elsinore\\" Frank Leslie's New York Journal of Romance, General Literature, Science and Art, July 1856. \\"Hamlet's grave is marked by a single stone obelisk, evidently of very early date; it is surrounded by tables and chairs, where citizens from Copenhagen consume beer and coffee and defile with their heeltaps the sepulchre of a king.\\" According to Jacob Riis, there were two stone obelisks erected (subsequently) at the spot, which were both eventually carried away by relic-seekers. Therefore, in 1879, J.S. Nathanson, who rented Marienlyst castle and operated a luxury hotel there from 1859 to 1896, marked Hamlet's grave with a large heap of stones. He would re-supply the stones regularly as they were carried away as relics by tourists. Nathanson's display of Hamlet's grave for the benefit of \\"the credulous and sentimental\\" and the aggressive use of the name of Hamlet in the advertisement of Hotel Marienlyst was much criticized at the time.Elise Lathrop, Where Shakespeare Set His Stage (1906), p. 168.) A granite stone shaped like a sarcophagus was erected on the site in 1926, on the occasion of Helsing√∏r's 500-years anniversary. The relief on the stone was designed by Einar Utzon- Frank. At this point, no pretense was made to the effect that the site was in any way the historical burial-place of Hamlet. Postcards of the period identify the monument as Hamlets mindesten (\\"Hamlet's memorial stone\\").\\"Hamlets mindesten\\" (helsingorleksikon.dk) At a later time, a bronze plaque was added to the stone reading :Einar Utzon-Frank, Hamlets Mindegrav, p√• Sarkofagen Symboler for mandlig Styrke og Jomfruelighed, 1926 :\\"Einar Utzon-Frank, Hamlet's memorial grave, on the sarcophagus symbols of virile strength and of virginity, 1926\\" This refers to the design of Utzon-Frank's relief, showing a lion-like creature on one side (for Hamlet) and a unicorn on the other (for Ophelia).Lars Bj√∏rn Madsen, Monumenternes Helsing√∏r (1997), 12-14\\\\. helsingorleksikon.dk. Ammelhede On 27 April 1932, O. L√∏ye, pharmacist at the L√∏veapoteket drug store in Randers, Jutland, published an article in the local newspaper in which he claimed to be able to prove that a local burial mound known as Kongsh√∏j (\\"king's howe\\"; ) was the tomb of Hamlet. The mound in question is situated in Ammelhede, the name of a pasture and farmstead in Essenb√¶k Sogn (formerly S√∏nderhald Municipality, since 2007 part of Randers Municipality). L√∏ye interpreted the toponym as Amleds hede \\"Amleth's heath\\". In the account of Saxo Grammaticus, Amlethus dies in battle against Wiglek and is indeed buried on a plain in Jutland, which was afterwards named after him.Insignis eius sepultura ac nomine campus apud Iutiam exstat. \\"A plain in Jutland is to be found, famous for his name and burial-place.\\" Gesta Danorum 4.2.4, trans. Oliver Elton (1905) . L√∏ye's article triggered a lively debate, including scathing criticism published in Fyns Venstreblad. On 30 April, Politiken published a sarcastic article which made the tongue-in-cheek suggestion that the people of Randers were free to exploit the theory and erect a stone to Hamlet on the mound in an attempt to draw away tourism from the much-criticized \\"fraudulent\\" monument in Marienlyst park. The following year, on 3 September 1933, such a stone was indeed raised on the mound by the recently founded Randers tourist board (Turistforeningen), citing the support of J√∏rgen Olrik, curator of the Danish folklore museum, and Hans Ellekilde, archivist of the Danish folklore collection.Michael Skovmand, Verdens bedst kendte dansker: Hamlet er s√• levende som aldre f√∏r\\" , Kronik, Aarhus Stiftstidende, 1 February 1992, at Department of English, University of Aarhus historiskatlas.dk (with a photograph of the unveiling ceremony of the monument).

Plot The story revolves around a series of adventures involving the Fulani Sunsaye family, particularly, Mai Sunsaye, head of the household and chief of Dokan Toro. Mai Sunsaye rescues a slave-girl, Fatimeh from the servant of a rough man known as Shehu. With the appearance of Fatimeh in the family, its existence turns topsy-turvy, leading Shaitu, Mai Sunsaye's wife to view her as bad luck. First, Rikku, Mai Sunsaye's youngest son seems to have fallen in love with Fatimeh who is much older than him. Hodio, Rikku's brother, and Mai Sunsaye's second son, however, runs away with Fatimeh, leaving Rikku love- sick. Mai Sunsaye vows to do anything possible to make Rikku feel better. During that same period, Mai Sunsaye's rival to the throne of Dokan Toro, Ardo, casts a spell on Mai Sunsaye by the aid of a talisman bound to the leg of a \\"grey-breasted\\" and \\"red-toed\\" \\"Senegal dove\\". The spell, known as the \\"sokugo\\" or the \\"wandering sickness\\" is a magic charm that \\"turned studious men into wanderers, that led husbands to desert their wives, Chiefs their people, and sane men their reason\\". Under the sway of this wanderlust- inspiring spell, Mai Sunsaye is launched into several adventures, in the course of which he crosses path with Jalla, his oldest son, and other characters, including Baba, an old man he meets in the deserted village of Old Chanka (which was evacuated by the British authorities, and its inhabitants relocated to New Chanka, due to an outbreak of the tse-tse fly, the vector of the sleeping sickness), and a herds-woman known as Ligu, \\"the champion cattle- herder\\". At the close of the novel, most of the family is reunited once more in Dokan Toro, and Mai Sunsaye finally dies. Setting The story takes place in colonial North Nigeria, as evidenced by the Bodejo, a British tax-collector and veterinarian, and the burning grass of Northern Nigeria referred to at the opening of the novel.

It is commonly known as the underworld windowskate or Pluto skate. The underworld windowskate is known from patches of continental slope in the western Atlantic Ocean between the coasts of the southern United States and Suriname. Etymology The underworld windowskate's genus name, Fenestraja, comes from a combination of two words. Fenestre is a Latin word meaning window, which in this case refers to a small opening in bone.Romero, P., 2002. An etymological dictionary of taxonomy. Madrid, unpublished. A second Latin word, Raja simply refers to the genus as a skate/ray of the family Rajidae. Its species name is a reference to Pluto (, ') the Greek god of the underworld.William Hansen, Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans. Oxford University Press, 2005 Taxonomy Samuel Garman The underworld windowskate was initially described by Samuel Garman in 1881 as Raja plutoni. Garman also considered placing the species in other genera such as Breviraja and Gurgesiella.Garman, S. 1881 (Apr.) Report on the selachians. Reports on the results of dredging, ... along the Atlantic coast of the United States during the summer of 1880, by the U. S. Coast Survey Steamer \\"Blake,\\" Commander J. R. Bartlett, U. S. N., commanding. XII. Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology v. 8 (no. 11): 231-237. The first specimens had been caught during dredging of the Atlantic coast during the summer of the previous year. In 1947, another skate from the Gulf Stream was described by Henry Fowler as Raja acanthiderma.Fowler, H. W. 1947 (June) A new skate from the Gulf Stream off east Florida. The Fish Culturist v. 26 (no. 10): 73-75. However this species designation has been suggested to be a synonym for the underworld windowskate, once the species was officially moved from Raja to Fenestraja.McEachran, J.D. and K.A. Dunn, 1998. Phylogenetic analysis of skates, a morphologically conservative clade of elasmobranchs (Chondrichthyes: Rajidae). Copeia 1998(2):271-290. Description The underworld windowskate has a heart-shaped disc, with denticles on the blunt snout, around the eyes, on the pectoral fins and down the sides of the long tail.Kells, Val., Carpenter, Kent. A Field Guide to Coastal Fishes From Maine to Texas. 2011. Johns Hopkins University Press. pg 86. It is generally yellowish, grayish, or purplish brown on top, with dark spots. The ventral surface is yellow-white, and the tail has several dark bands. Distribution and habitat According to the IUCN, five populations of the underworld windowskate are known, all from the western Atlantic Ocean. The northernmost ranges on the North American continental shelf from North Carolina to Key West, including the Straights of Florida. Another population is known from the waters around Andros Island in the Bahamas and in the Tongue of the Ocean. A third area of continental shelf, this time in the Gulf of Mexico from the Chattahoochee River delta to the Mississippi River Delta is also known to contain the species. Finally, two widely separated groups occupy the southern Caribbean Sea, the first off Costa Rica, near Puerto Limon, and the second from the South American continental shelf near Caracas, Venezuela, to Paramaribo, Suriname. Outside of these general ranges, specimens have been collected from the waters off Colombia, Ellesmere Island, in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and James Bay, Canada.Global Biodiversity Information Facility Records. 6 June, 2014 Individuals have also been spotted by divers in southern Mexico, and in 1891 a specimen supposedly belonging to F. plutonia was collected from the California coast, even though the underworld windowskate is overwhelmingly an Atlantic species.Global Biodiversity Information Facility, Occurrence Records. 2 May 2015 See also *Fenestraja *IUCN Red List data deficient species (Chordata) References External links *Underworld windowskate at Fishbase Category:Rajiformes Category:Fish of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Fish described in 1881 ","title":"Fenestraja plutonia"},{"id":"45554994","text":"Uroleucon minutum, is an aphid in the superfamily Aphidoidea in the order Hemiptera.

Finally in 2011, following a corporate crisis, summarizes the old name of \\"AN Brescia\\". In the swimming area now experienced its greatest splendor between the eighties and the nineties thanks to the extraordinary victories of Giorgio Lamberti, who won the title in the 100, 200 and 400m freestyle at the Italian and European championships.

The property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the Department of the Interior in 1975 due to its archeological and cultural significance. This area was first surveyed in 1893 by W.H. Winchell and again in 1899 by J.V. Brower and David I. Bushnell. Brower and Bushnell identified 128 mounds and noted that the site was an ideal location for a village site. In 1936, a group from the University of Minnesota, led by Gordon Erkholm, excavated 13 mounds. The information from this survey was the basis for Dr. Wilford's \\"Mille Lacs Aspect\\" of the Minnesota Woodland period. Over the past hundred years, there has been a number of factors that have led to the destruction of over half of the original mound group. Many of the mounds were leveled in 1939 during the building of highway 18, others were leveled in order to build lake cottages, and many have small pits dug into them. No scholarly work has been done at the site since 1970. Today, the remaining mound group is privately owned and part of Malmo Bay Campground.1963 paper by G.W. Hume A type of pottery, known as Malmo Ware, is named after this site. From the University of Minnesota Anthropology Department: \\"Malmo ware vessels are smooth surfaced, grit- or limestone-tempered, conoidal-shaped jars with a wide mouth, straight rim, and slight or no constriction of the neck. Vessels are undecorated or decorated on the upper exterior surface with various combinations of horizontal bands of dentate stamping, slashes, punctuates, bosses, or other decorative techniques. Malmo ware is thought to be the earliest pottery ware in the Mille Lacs locality. There is some uncertainty as to the earliest and latest dates of the ware, but they seem firmly dated to the Initial Woodland period.\\" References Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Protected areas of Aitkin County, Minnesota Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Mounds in Minnesota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Aitkin County, Minnesota ","title":"Malmo Mounds and Village Site"},{"id":"45555116","text":"The Asian Woolly Hackberry Aphid, (Shivaphis celti), also known as Shivaphis (Shivaphis) celti, is an aphid in the superfamily Aphidoidea in the order Hemiptera.

The programme aims to strengthen children's body confidence and self- esteem through interactive activities, designed by experts in body confidence. The programme has reached girls and boys from over 101 countries since 2014. Free Being Me Activity Packs The Free Being Me activity packs, targeted at 7-10 and 11-14 years olds are available in 18 languages and can be downloaded freely in English, French, Spanish, Arabic and Swahili from the group's website. During Free Being Me sessions girls learn to stand up to social pressures, value their bodies and challenge beauty stereotypes promoted in the media. Girls also have the opportunity to do a 'Take Action' project where they engage with others to pass on the body confidence message, promoting a healthy body image to their friends and community. Programme in the UK Free Being Me is run through the Peer Education programme in the UK(Previously known as \\"4\\"). Girls aged 16-25 attend Regional or National training where they are trained to deliver sessions on the Free Being Me topic to girls. The sessions are designed to cover Brownies (age 7-10) and Guides (age 10-16). There is not currently a programme for older girls. The programme is delivered over 2 or 3 sessions typically lasting 90 minutes each. The initial session covers \\"What is the Body Myth\\" with the second session covering \\"Breaking the Body Myth\\". Girls can choose to take the activities further and spread the message of what they have learned on body image to other girls, by doing so they can earn the Free Being Me badge.

Production of Beemster is similar to other hard cheeses such as Gouda. The specific taste of Beemster stems from the ingredients (milk from grass grown on sea-clay in a polder 4 meters below sea-level) and from the fact that part of the production process (the stirring of the curd) is done by hand and that the cheeses are ripened in changing conditions. History After the completion of the Beemster-polder in 1612 farming was made possible. The new land--four meters below sea-level-- was fertile and suitable for agriculture and dairy farming. Until 1901 most of the dairy farmers delivered their milk and home-made cheese to local merchants. The dependency on these merchants did not always please them. In 1901 a number of dairy farmers in several villages all decided to start cooperatives. The different cooperatives built small cheese factories. One of these was the cooperative Wilhelmina, opened in 1907. In 1930 they joined with another factory in the polder, De Unie, forming the joint cooperative cheesemaking facility called De Tijd (\\"The Time\\"). In 1947 two other cooperatives (Concordia from Oudendijk and Ons Belang from Middelie) joined to form the De Combinatie (\\"The Combination\\"). In 1950 the cheese factory Neerlandia in Stompetoren was added. Finally, in 1991 De Combinatie joined with another cooperative, De Vechtstreek, forming CONO Cheesemakers. In the seventies, there was growing competition in the Dutch cheese market. This led to the introduction of Beemster kaas (Beemster cheese). Its handicraft nature results from the hand-stirring of the curd plus the ripening in different temperatures and humidities. CONO has about 475 farmers, and is one of the country's smallest such cooperatives; it produces about 30,000 tons of Beemster each year. In 2001 the Queen of The Netherlands awarded the title 'By Appointment to the Court of the Netherlands'. Beemsterkaas is one of the main attractions of the area. Today CONO makes a wide variety of cheeses all based on the Beemster cheese. They also are the exclusive provider of milk to Ben & Jerry's in Europe.

It is endemic to the Canary Islands, where three subspecies occur on three separate islands (Tenerife, La Gomera and El Hierro). The species has been assessed as endangered in the IUCN Red List, being known only from small separated areas and facing a variety of threats. Description Cistus chinamadensis is a shrub, usually tall. The woody stems have dark brown bark that easily frays and strips off. The upper branches have a dense velvety covering of fine hairs (indumentum), beige to off-white in colour. The oppositely arranged leaves are light green (in subsp. gomerae) or greyish green (in subsp. chinamadensis), around long by wide, with a pointed tip. The leaves have three prominent veins. Opposite pairs of leaves are joined together at the base by a long sheath, the outside of which is furrowed and the inside covered in hairs (as is the outside in subsp. gomerae). The upper sides of the leaves are more-or- less smooth, the lower sides rough and reticulate, to a varying degree between the subspecies. The flowers are arranged in open, slightly branched cymes, with 4‚Äì8 flowers to each inflorescence. The sepals have a short tooth, up to long, at the apex and are of two distinct sizes. Two outer sepals are around long by wide; three inner sepals are considerably larger, around long by wide. The petals are pink with yellowish bases, more-or-less rounded, about long and wide. The yellow stamens are somewhat shorter than the sepals. The ovary is high, topped by a style about long. In its native habitat, C. chinamadenis flowers in May and produces seeds in June to July. Taxonomy and phylogeny Cistus chinamadensis was first described in 1991 by √Ångel Ba√±ares Baudet and Pedro Romero Manrique. The species was first found at Roque de los Pinos near to the village of Chinamada in the Anaga region of Tenerife; hence the specific epithet chinamadensis meaning \\"from Chinamada\\". Two subspecies were initially described, C. chinamadensis subsp. chinamadensis and C. ch. subsp. gomerae. In 2005 a further subspecies, C. ch. subsp. ombriosus, was described by Jean-Pierre Demoly and M. Marrero. A 2011 molecular phylogenetic study placed C. chinamadensis as a member of the purple and pink flowered clade of Cistus species, along with some other Canary Island endemics (Cistus asper, Cistus horrens, Cistus ocreatus, and Cistus symphytifolius), although the three subspecies did not form a clade, with some analyses separating C. ch. subsp. ombriosus in particular from the other two subspecies. Distribution and habitat Cistus chinamadensis is endemic to the Canary Islands. The three subspecies are found on different islands: C. ch. subsp. chinamadensis in the north of Tenerife in three locations in the Anaga region at altitudes of around ; C. ch. subsp. gomerae in one natural location and several introduced locations in La Gomera at around ; and C. ch. subsp. ombriosus in one location in El Hierro at . Conservation In 2011 when its status was assessed as \\"endangered\\" according to the IUCN Red List criteria, Cistus chinamadensis was known from seven locations in the Canary Islands. C. ch. ssp. chinamadensis from Tenerife was present in three locations; its population appeared to be stable or increasing. C. ch. ssp. gomerae from La Gomera was found in two natural locations and has since been introduced to four others. Its range appeared to be decreasing. C. ch. subsp. ombriosus from El Hierro was present in a single location with an area of about . Threats to the species include a variety of natural hazards, such as landslides, fires and drought, and biological hazards, such as grazing.

Goals of organizations spearheading the movement for criminal justice reform include decreasing the United States' prison population or decarceration, reducing prison sentences that are perceived to be too harsh and long, altering drug sentencing policy, policing reform, reducing overcriminalization, and juvenile justice reform. Criminal justice reform also targets reforming policies for those with criminal convictions that are receiving other consequences from food assistance programs, outside of serving their time in prison. There are many organizations that advocate to reform the criminal justice system such as: ACLU,https://www.aclu.org/issues/smart-justice Penal Reform International, Sentencing Project, Brennan Center for Justice, Cut 50 and the Innocence Project. Most states have a criminal justice reform act as well. These organizations use legal disputes and public events to make the problems aware to the public but mostly the state and federal governments.  Areas for reform  = Sentencing = Sentencing laws within the U.S. criminal justice system are criticized for being both draconian and racially discriminatory. Additionally, they are cited as the main contributor to the growing and excessive prison population known as mass incarceration.  Discriminatory sentencing  In 2016, according to the Sentencing Project's Fact Sheet on Trends in U.S. Corrections, 2.1 million individuals were in America's prisons or jails. Trends in U.S. Corrections. The Sentencing Project, 2017, Trends in U.S. Corrections, sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Trends-in- US-Corrections.pdf. This reflects a 500% increase since the mid-1980s, which has come to be known as mass incarceration. Those in support of criminal justice reform perceive the issue to be an increase in surveillance and the use of draconian sentencing laws, especially within communities of color. While some researches claim that racial sentencing disparities are a reflection of differences in criminal activity, crime seriousness, and recidivism between different communities, other researchers believe that racial minorities are punished more harshly than their white counterparts who commit similar crimes.Spohn, Cassia. \\"Thirty years of sentencing reform: The quest for a racially neutral sentencing process.\\" Criminal justice 3 (2000): 427‚Äì501 Findings from a study done by Cassia C. Spohn, explained in ‚ÄúThirty Years of Sentencing Reform: The Quest for a Racial Neutral Sentencing Process‚Äù indicate that an individual's race and ethnicity play a role in sentencing outcomes.  Sentencing regulation  Individuals are sentenced more often and for longer with the average sentence in the U.S. being nearly twice as long as Australian and five times as long as German sentences. Truth in Sentencing laws and mandatory minimums are perceived to be two forms of draconian policies that contribute to prison overcrowding. Truth in sentencing law requires that offenders serve the majority of their sentences before being eligible for release, restricting or eliminating sentencing exceptions such as good-time, earned-time, and parole board release. The majority of truth in sentencing laws require offenders to complete at least 85% of their sentence. Due to the formation of the Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in- Sentencing Incentive Grants Program by Congress in 1994, states are given grants if they require violent offenders to serve at least 85% of their sentences. Mandatory minimum laws are those that require judges to sentence an individual to a specified minimum for the committed crime. This shifts power from the power of judges to prosecutors who have the ability to use the threat of an extremely long sentence in order to pressure defendants into accepting a plea bargain. = Drug policy = Proponents of drug policy reform point to the war on drugs, marijuana law reform, and reducing drug harm as key issues. Advocates for policy change such as the Drug Policy Alliance believe that the War on Drugs was and is a policy failure that has led to wasted resources, human potential, and a violation of rights. The mass incarceration of drug users is viewed as a waste of taxpayer money by drug reform advocated. The United States spends over $51 million yearly on the war on drugs. Organizations that focus on reform such as the Sentencing Project and Campaign Zero also claim that the likelihood of imprisonment for drug related charges is racially disparate. In her book The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, Michelle Alexander originates the claim that the War on Drugs is a new form of systematic oppression and social control that resembles Jim Crow laws that enforced racial segregation.Alexander, Michelle. The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness. New Press, 2016. The enactment of the War on Drugs in the 1980s is primarily responsible for the dramatic rise in incarceration rates in the U.S. In the 1980s, 40,900 individuals were incarcerated due to drug offenses, and by 2015 there were 469,545. In 2016 1,572,579 individuals were arrested for drug law violations (84% of which were due to possession). Of this number, 643,249 were arrested due to marijuana violations (89% of which were due to possession). Approximately half of the individuals currently incarcerated in federal prisons are there due to a drug offense. [1]Half of the individuals in federal prison are there due to a drug offense. Compared to 1980, there are ten times as many people in state prisons for drug offenses. The focus of the War on Drugs is cited as being misguided for stigmatizing drug users. Drug use is framed as a criminal rather than addiction and health issue. The Drug Policy Alliance points to countries that focus on the reduction of drug-related harms such as overdose, addiction, and disease as metrics for drug policy success. Portugal is often cited as extremely successful for their drug policies since decriminalizing low-level drug possession in 2001 and shifting towards a health-based approach to drug use. Since doing so Portugal has seen a decrease in violent crime, addiction, and the transmission of diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C. = Policing = Policing reform typically focuses on police brutality and the use of dangerous force against minority individuals. Police brutality refers to the \\"use of excessive physical force or verbal assault and psychological intimidation\\" by law enforcement against individuals.Chaney, Cassandra, and Ray V. Robertson. ‚ÄúRacism and Police Brutality in America.‚Äù Journal of African American Studies, vol. 17, no. 4, 2013, pp. 480‚Äì505. JSTOR, JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/43525523. According to Mapping Police Violence, police killed 1,147 individuals in 2017. This shows an increase from previous years with 963 individuals killed by fatal force in 2016 and 995 killed in 2015. The distribution of these killings varies widely by state with the majority of incidences occurring in states such as California, Texas, Florida, and Arizona and the least in Rhode Island, Vermont and North Dakota. While the distribution of killings by state within the U.S. is not even, overall more individuals die due to police shootings and other acts of excessive force than in any other Western, developed nation. Additionally, there are racial disparities within statistics of police killings.30% of the Black victims were unarmed, compared to 21% of White Victims that were.  Police brutality  People in favor of criminal justice reform point to recurring examples of discriminatory violence towards individuals such as the Watts Riots of 1965, the beating of Rodney King in 1991, and the death of Amadou Diallo in the 1990s. Theories from various fields including sociology and psychology have attempted to explain the phenomena of police brutality.‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòCauses‚Äô of Police Brutality: Theory and Evidence on Police Use of Force .‚Äù Criminal Justice Theory: Explaining the Nature and Behavior of Criminal Justice, by Edward R. Maguire and David E. Duffee, Taylor and Francis Ltd, 2015. Sociological theories of brutality focus on the way in which interactions between police and individuals are influenced by the status of the individual. This means that differences race, gender, and socioeconomic status result in disparate treatment by law enforcement. Additionally, ‚Äúsituational factors‚Äù such as the character of the neighborhood also affect the interactions. Each of these factors are cues that push officers to make judgements about how to proceed. So, according to this theory minorities are overrepresented in police killings simply due to perceptions of their race. Psychological theories of police brutality emphasizes that different outlooks and personalities result in differing behavior by the police. This follows behavioral psychology in suggesting that differences in gender, socioeconomic status, educational and experiences affect one's responses. Organizational theory suggests that police brutality is a result of the organizational structure of law enforcement. The use of excessive force is seen as a response to disrespecting their authority. In his book Punishing Race, Michael Tonry of University of Michigan, claims that White individuals and groups typically excuse police brutality due to a deep-seated prejudice towards Blacks.Tonry, Michael H. Punishing Race: a Continuing American Dilemma. Oxford University Press, 2012. Media representations of Black individuals and disparate sentencing contribute to the idea that Black individuals are inherently more criminal. Research reveals that Black males with features considered Afrocentric such as darker skin tone, broad noses, and full lips, receive longer sentences than their lighter-skinned counterparts with Eurocentric features.  Broken windows policing  Broken windows policing, or quality of life policing, is based on a criminological theory known as broken windows theory. This theory suggests that repairing broken windows in buildings and other forms of physical disorder within a city indicate whether or not there is crime. When translated to policing tactics, minor offenses are targeted as a way to deter greater, more serious crime. Reformers point to the ways that broken windows policing negatively impacts communities of color through criminalization and excessive force. Additionally, it is typically seen as responsible for over policing and the militarization of neighborhoods. Offenses such as drug possession, ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù activities or mental health crises often lead to the characterization of a neighborhood as disorderly and in need of stronger policing. Opponents of broken windows policing and theory suggest that this leads to the inherent criminalization of poor, minority and homeless individuals. It creates a stigma that reinforces the underlying problems that lead to the perception of crime within the neighborhood. Additionally, those that oppose the theory suggest that these issues are improperly addressed by law enforcement and instead should be treated by social workers or healthcare professionals.  Predictive policing  Predictive policing is an analytical technique used by law enforcement in order to predict where crime is likely to occur.Brayne, Srah, et al. ‚ÄúPredictive Policing.‚ÄùData&Civil; Rights: A New Era of Policing and Justice, 27 Oct. 2015. It involves predicting both the potential time and place of crimes and individuals likely to commit them. It is used as an alternative to full reliance and trust in the ‚Äúhunches‚Äù and instincts of law enforcement that are believed to come with training. Proponents of predictive policing believe that it is a way to minimize bias and discriminatory practices within policing. Opponents of predictive policing point to the fact that (1) the data used to isolate patterns of criminal behavior uses a privatized algorithm that only companies have access to and (2) its potential to reinforce existing biases against poor and minority communities. Because predictive policing algorithms use existing data to make predictions, it would follow that existing bias within the system is not eliminated but amplified. Additionally, opponents believe that it is a way to ‚Äúmanufacture‚Äù crime; it reinforces the idea that crime in an area exists and just needs to be found by law enforcement.  Stop and frisk  Stop-and-frisk stops refer to \\"a brief non-intrusive police stop of a suspect\\" warranted by \\"reasonable suspicion\\" that often involve a pat-down of the suspect. Stop-and-frisk policies became a large part of criminal justice reform efforts following NYPD's use of the tactic. NYPD vowed to end its implementation of stop and frisk policies August 12, 2013 when ruled unconstitutional in Floyd v. City of New York.Vaughan, Bernard (August 12, 2013). \\"NYPD's 'stop-and-frisk' practice is unconstitutional, judge rules\\". Reuters. Retrieved August 12, 2013. Although this is the case, similar policies are used in other cities throughout the U.S. Stop and frisk has saved thousands of lives according to former New York City Michael Bloomberg, and has been responsible for taking thousands of illegal weapons off the streets of New York. According to Bloomberg Stop and Frisk has reduced the incarceration rate by 30 percent. \\"People also have a right to walk down the street without being killed or mugged\\", said Bloomberg, \\"And for those rights to be protected, we have to give the members of our Police Department the tools they need to do their job...\\" Opponents of stop- and-frisk believe that it is unconstitutional, ineffective, and racist. Most cases in which stop and frisk is used are a result of the War on Drugs.Laser, Rachel Karen. ‚ÄúUnreasonable Suspicion: Relying on Refusals to Support Terry Stops.‚Äù The University of Chicago Law Review, vol. 62, no. 3, 1995, pp. 1161‚Äì1185. JSTOR, JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/1600058. In line with this, the majority of those targeted are racial minorities, specifically African Americans. A report by the Public Advocate's office indicates that of the 532,911 stops made in 2012 in New York City, 53% of individuals were Black and 31% were Hispanic. Additionally, the New York Civil Liberties Union indicated that only 97,296 stops were made in 2002, or less than a fifth of those made in 2012. Opponents point to the fact that stop-and-frisk is often unproductive and fails to fulfill its aim. Of the 2.3 million instances of police stopping Black males based on reasonable suspicion between 2004 and 2012, only 16,000 resulted in the seizure of illicit goods. = Re-entry = Those that believe re-entry programs need reform typically point to recidivism rates within the United States criminal justice system. While those against reform claim that recidivism rates are indicative of inherent criminality amongst certain groups, those in support of reform believe it is indicative of the ineffectiveness of re-entry and parole programs. Different types of disenfranchisement exist that affect the formerly incarcerated after their release. Advocates of criminal justice reform in the United States often also push for the reform of restrictions on federal aid and societal participation. Federal restrictions that exist include bans on the use of welfare programs and federal financial aid for education. Restrictions on societal participation include felons not being allowed to hold public office, teach or work in child care, or vote. Voting restrictions are known as felony disenfranchisement. This refers to the regulations that prevent those with a felony conviction from voting in local, state, and federal elections on the basis of their conviction. 6.1 million individuals were unable to vote due to felony disenfranchisement in 2016. Former prisoners are incarcerated multiple times, increasing recidivism rates, because they are unable to follow strict rules and regulations. Advocates of parole reform perceive these regulations as not being focus on community well being but instead on controlling parolees. A report for Columbia University's Justice lab showed that in the four years since January 1, 2018, New York City's jail population declined by 21%. However, during this time period, the population of individuals incarcerated due to parole violations increased by 15%. The challenge of finding employment opportunities is another barrier for reintegration. Many employers deny applicants due to criminal records. Other reasons for difficulty finding employment is lack of available support such as personal networks and resources from correction systems. The chance of successful reintegration can come from the community surrounding the newly released individual. Those who return to disadvantaged neighborhoods have a higher chance of recidivism than those who return to communities with rich and affluent resources. Lack of stable housing and resources to combat mental health and drug and alcohol abuse create obstacles for formerly incarcerated to successfully reintegrate. Former prisoners are incarcerated multiple times, increasing recidivism rates, because of many factors that often do not include real crime. Most often they are re-incarcerated because of strict parole rules and regulations. Advocates of parole reform perceive these regulations as not being focus on community well being but instead on controlling parolees. A report for Columbia University's Justice lab showed that in the four years since January 1, 2018, New York City's jail population declined by 21%. However, during this time period, the population of individuals incarcerated due to parole violations increased by 15%. There are many forms of successful re-entry. Government intervention such as implementing \\"wrap-around\\" services are proven to help income and boost employment. Comprehensive social services that offer independent housing and jobs alongside counseling and rehabilitation help formerly incarcerated reintegrate. The Second Chance Act was passed with bipartisan support in an effort to reduce recidivism rates and improve outcomes for individuals following their released from juvenile facilities, jails and prisons. Second Chance Grant Programs include those that focus on substance use and mental disorders, mentoring and transitional services for adults, improvement for the outcomes for youth in the juvenile justice system, and technology career training. The \\"Ban the Box\\" Act is a program that has been implemented in 23 states that offers fair chance hiring for the formerly incarcerated by eliminating the requirement of addressing criminal history on employment applications. This act strives to end criminal record discrimination and has improved employment opportunities for formerly incarcerated with employers such as Target, Starbucks, and Home Depot. \\"Ban the Box\\" also influences racial discrimination as employers began to guess who has criminal records, and individuals mostly targeted by these assumptions are Hispanics and Blacks. = Juvenile justice reform = The push for reform within juvenile justice highlights the notion that Black and Latinx individuals, especially males, are criminalized prior to adulthood.Victor M. Rios (2006) The Hyper-Criminalization of Black and Latino Male Youth in the Era of Mass Incarceration, Souls, 8:2, 40‚Äì54 The juvenile justice system is viewed in the same light as the criminal justice system as a form of social control that incapacitates Black and Latinx youth. Criminalization is also thought to occur in other social institutions such as school businesses, the streets and community centers. The juvenile justice system itself is also often criticized by reformers for perpetuating the notion that non-criminal individuals are criminal. The majority of individuals that enter the system have committed non-violent offenses, but still experience the effects of indirect punishment, direct punishment, and criminalization of their violent counterparts. Overall, this criminalization is thought to be harmful due to its impact on the perception and Black and Latinx youth have of themselves and their capability to be successful within society. Many also believe that the juvenile justice system is a part of the school to prison pipeline which funnels individuals from public school to the criminal and juvenile justice systems. Harsher disciplinary rules prevent individuals from re-entering schools following an offense, making it more likely for them to experience social pressures such as law income and unemployment that reform groups perceive to lead to criminal activity. Additionally, in school arrests contribute to the pipeline. Advocates of reform point to the fact that 70% of students arrested at school are Black, further contributing to the criminalization and mass incarceration of Black individuals. ‚ÄúThere is a growing body of evidence that identifies child maltreatment as a predictor of lifetime anti-social and criminal behavior‚Äù (Basto-Pereira, Miranda, Ribeiro, & Maia. (2016). Whatever the reason for the criminal behavior, there must be countermeasures that are developed to keep people that are more than likely to commit a crime from committing them. After school programs, community involvement in youth, diversionary programs must be in place to keep youth that have a higher risk of committing a crime from continuing their crime involvement. If you do not start something at the beginning, you will never address the cause of the issue.Basto-Pereira, Miranda, Ribeiro, and Maia. \\"Growing up with Adversity: From Juvenile Justice Involvement to Criminal Persistence and Psychosocial Problems in Young Adulthood.\\" Child Abuse & Neglect 62 (2016): 63-75.  Arguments on criminal justice reform  Arguments exist for and against criminal justice reform in the United States. While it is more common for those on the left to support reform, some conservative groups and individuals also believe that the system must be reformed. = Support for reform =  Conservative support for reform  There is a push from conservative groups such as Right on Crime to reclaim ground in the debate for criminal justice reform. Although support for reform is typically associated with liberal ideology, conservative criminological views emphasize the role of individual responsibility in crime. This parts from the liberal viewpoint that societal pressures contribute to crime in society. Conservative responses to crime emphasize holding prisoners accountable. They also strongly believe in the concept of victim reconciliation, or restorative justice. Restorative justice focuses on mediation between a victim and offender in order to satisfy both parties.Braithwaite, John. ‚ÄúRestorative Justice: Assessing Optimistic and Pessimistic Accounts.‚Äù Crime and Justice, vol. 25, 1999, pp. 1‚Äì127. JSTOR, JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/1147608. Furthermore, they believe that victim engagement benefits victims and offenders because a large part of rehabilitation is the recognition of the impact of their criminal acts. The conservative case for criminal justice reform is based on a moral belief in the need to help offenders turn their lives around, but also necessary for public safety. The conservative belief is that high incarceration rates reflect an expansion of government power. Fiscal discipline reflects a large portion of conservative support for reform. Those that have been advanced in support of criminal justice reform include that the prison population of the United States costs about $80 billion per year to maintain. The push for reform emphasizes that it is inefficient to continue to spend such a large portion of state and national taxpayer dollars on incarcerating such a large number of individuals. Additionally, conservatives believe that the government should have greater accountability in reducing rates. Their proposed reforms have been criticized by some who claim the reforms are driven primarily by cost benefit analysis and recidivism, not a concern for justice and human rights, including sociologist Marie Gottschalk, who stated \\"cost-benefit analysis is one of the principal tools of the neoliberal politics on which the carceral state is founded.\\"  Liberal support for reform  Liberal reformers believe that since the civil rights era, a form of color-blind racism has developed, reflecting a shift from de jure to de facto racism.Brewer, Rose M., and Nancy A. Heitzeg. \\"The racialization of crime and punishment: Criminal justice, color-blind racism, and the political economy of the prison industrial complex.\\" American Behavioral Scientist 51.5 (2008): 625‚Äì644. Within this, racial minorities, most often African Americans of a low socioeconomic status, ‚Äúare subject to unequal protection of the laws, excessive surveillance, extreme segregation, and neo-slave labor via incarceration, all in the name of crime control.‚Äù Beyond tangible punishments there are ‚Äúinvisible punishments‚Äù such as felony disenfrachisment, restrictions on holding public office, occupational bans on professions such as law enforcement, teaching and child care, bans on welfare and federal assistance, and federal financial aid for education. Because mass incarceration and ‚Äúinvisible punishments‚Äù that also impact communities of color are thought of and referred to as the New Jim Crow, or another form of racialized social control, prison abolitionists draw parallels between prison abolition and the abolition of slaves. The prison abolition movement, typically believed to be on the far left, view prisons as a form of Neo- slavery that is unjust and racist.Davis, Angela Y., et al. ‚ÄúAre Prisons Obsolete?‚Äù By Angela Y. Davis, https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108428.Are_Prisons_Obsolete_. The movement dates back to Emma Goldman's 1911 abolitionist essay, The Priest and the Devil to open Prisons: A Social Crime and Failure. There exists the belief that prisons are obsolete, financially motivated, and better replaced by more humane institutions that directly focus on the rehabilitation of individuals. The abolition movement believes that prisons should not be reformed by replaced as they are not productive social institutions and instead only serve to incapacitate individuals. = Opposition to reform = Opposition to criminal justice reform typically is expressed by conservatives who do not perceive errors in the criminal justice system. Those that believe this also typically reject the claim from reform activists that the criminal justice system acts in a way that is racially disparate, and do not acknowledge the War on Drugs as \\"the new Jim Crow.\\" Instead, \\"blue racism,\\" or discrimination against law enforcement is seen as existing. Policing is viewed as a colorblind process that has no consideration for the race of offenders. Right wing media outlets frequently fight the notion of racially disparate policing that groups such as Black Lives Matter and Campaign Zero with the idea that police officers are reacting to compromising situations in a normal and rational way. Crime is cited as the rationale for any police reaction, and ‚Äúviolent criminal attacks are (cited as) the best predictor of whom police might shoot in America\\" according to those opposed to reform.  Reform organizations  Several non-profits, organizations, and initiatives also focus on criminal justice reform including the ACLU, Campaign Zero, Right on Crime, The Innocence Project, The Sentencing Project, and the Marshall Project. The goals of these organizations is to spread awareness about perceived injustices within the criminal justice system and to promote action against it through social and policy change. In 2015 a number of reformers, including the ACLU, the Center for American Progress, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, Koch family foundations, the Coalition for Public Safety, and the MacArthur Foundation, announced a bipartisan resolution to reform the criminal justice system in the United States. Their efforts were lauded by President Obama who noted these reforms will improve rehabilitation and workforce opportunities for those who have served their sentences.  Reform in the States  A common theme of reform bills in the states aim for reform on sentencing laws, civil asset forfeiture laws, bail reform, \\"ban the box\\" policies, and juvenile justice reform. = Alabama = Reformed the policy of allowing people with a felony drug conviction apply for assistance programs such as food and cash assistance. Alabama reformed this policy to expand the criteria as a case-by-case premise. = Alaska = In 2016, Alaska chose not to participate in the law that doesn't allow people with a felony drug conviction to apply for programs to assist in their living and family situations. Include in their new policy under Senate Bill 91, someone with a felony drug conviction must follow the court's rehabilitation treatments and remain on good behavior under the assigned parole requirements. = Arizona = In April 2017, Arizona amended the civil assets forfeiture law allowing agencies of the government to take property from criminal enterprises whether there was a conviction or not. = Arkansas = Most recently Arkansas passed Act 423 of 2017 to allow offenders who break probation or parole to be housed in a different, more rehabilitative facility for a shorter amount of time instead of overcrowding the prison system. This law also keeps offenders who commit crimes from being intoxicated by drugs or because of their mental health out of prison and jails. Their focus is on reducing the prison population. They agree, bipartisan, to do this by reducing prison sentences and adding reentry programs while keeping it cost-effective. = California = The recent governor of California proposed to reduce the population of prisons with three new eligibility requirements approved by the public. Proposition 57 included on policy for judge's approval on juvenile offenders being tried as an adult, changing the eligibility requirements for an adult with violent convictions allowing them to be granted parole, and advising the prison system to be more lenient on the \\"good behavior\\" rules for those incarcerated to be released early. = Colorado = Senate Bill 181 was created in 2016 and allows juveniles that were previously sentenced to life without the option of parole to file for a resentencing hearing, in hopes of reducing the prison population. = Connecticut = In August 2017, the governor passed a reform bill for the criminal justice system of Connecticut. This bill included a bail reform to get ride of cash bail for misdemeanor level and non-violent offenses. It also included a requirement of a criminal conviction before seizing the asset(s) someone put up for bail. The governor also created \\"Second Chance Society\\" to reduced the consequences of drug possession and offenders who committed non-violent offenses to apply for parole or get their conviction pardoned. = Delaware = Delaware amended the \\"three-strikes\\" law by allowing more convictions before the offender was sentenced under the law. Under Senate Bill 163 Delaware lowered the sentencing requirement for the \\"three-strikes\\" law and is allowing offenders already convicted to be resentenced. In 2016, Delaware also reformed their policy that made people with convicted felonies to pay their fines off before they could vote. SB 242 allows convicted felons to vote without paying off their fines. = Florida = Florida reformed one of their sentencing policies in 2016. Aggravated assault is no longer a crime that sentences a 10 to 20 or 20 to Life mandatory minimum statue, under SB 228. = Georgia = Georgia, like Alabama amended their policy for food assistance programs for a case-by-case premise under Senate Bill 367. = Hawaii = The summer of 2012 the governor enacted two bills to reform the justice system for both juveniles and adults. House Bill 2515 and Senate Bill 2776, which was agreed upon by both parties, were signed to reduce the number of prisoners by reducing recidivism rates and use rehabilitation more than prisons. = Idaho = In 2005, Idaho created a group of members from the branches of government to contemplate the issues in the criminal justice system and find the most cost effective and safe practices to keep the public safe and reform the system. They have created guidelines to reduce recidivism rates in their state. Idaho, most recently, has revised a policy for posting cash bail bonds for low-level driving offenses. = Illinois = Illinois adopted House Bill 1437, in 2016, requiring the Criminal Justice Information Authority to evaluate the reporting practices. It also regulates the requirements for reporting practices such as arrest without charges, most involving racial demographics. = Indiana = There has been framework to amend sentencing policies that coincide with the offense rather than the standard for everyone. It includes the use of rehabilitation for drug offenders to keep them out prison and tightening the ropes of offenders on probation. = Iowa = In 2016 Iowa reduced the mandatory minimum sentencing for second degree robbery offenses from seven years to five or six years. The House File 2064 also allows offenders who committed non-violent drug offenses to be released early after serving half their mandatory minimum sentence. = Kansas = In April 2016, Kansas passed Senate Bill 367 to save money on offenders who are considered \\"low-risk\\" by serving their time helping the community while they live at home. Instead, the bill intends that the money is spent rehabilitating the \\"high-risk\\" offenders to keep them from entering the criminal justice system again after they are released. SB 367 is also aimed at fixing the juvenile justice system by categorizing them as \\"low-risk\\" offenders and keeping them out of the prison systems to lower incarceration rates. = Kentucky = Kentucky passed House Bill 40 to allow offenders to file to have their low-level conviction removed from their record. This also allows people with their felony records removed to vote. = Louisiana = Louisiana allowed House Bill 266, a ‚Äúban the box‚Äù policy that holds up the question ‚Äúhave you ever been convicted of a felony‚Äù on employment applications to give a fair chance to those that have. In 2016, they also passed Senate Bill 324, changing the age for juveniles to be considered criminally responsible to 18. = Maine = This reform is aimed at fixing police misconduct and the policies that impact the public of an indigent nature. In April, the governor enacted a bill that reformed the bail system, waiving fines and fee in certain cases, called LD 1639. = Maryland = With House Bill 1312, Maryland reversed the mandatory minimum sentence for drug crimes that weren't violent. It also allowed offenders that are incarcerated and can apply for aged and medical parole earlier and allowing the prison system to award more credits to offenders for finishing programs that are educational. Maryland also allowed HB 980, without the governor's permission, to allow offenders in felony parole to vote. = Massachusetts = In Massachusetts, a person will no longer get their license suspended if they are convicted of a drug offense also getting rid of the fee to get one's license back, under Senate Bill 2021. = Michigan = The governor signed to enact multiple bills in March 2017. One includes Senate Bill 8, a bill that will reform the recidivism rates by applying supervision practices for offenders on probation or parole to agencies that get state funding. SB 22 is another bill that reforms the rehabilitative services to those in the age range of 18 and 22. Lastly, SB 9 reforms the reentry program to make it an easier transition back to functioning society. = Minnesota = Minnesota has become more lenient on the sale and possession laws by reducing the imprisonment time for first-degree and second-degree sales and possession charges for drugs including heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamines. With Senate File 3481, Minnesota has increased the amount for a first-degree sale and possession charge from 10 grams to 17. For offenses with violent factors such as firearms, the imprisonment term has increased. = Mississippi = House Bill 812 was signed by the governor to regulate civil forfeiture reporting made easier for departments in the state. = Missouri = Missouri also amended their law defining the voting requirements for offenders in the state. The governor also held up the ‚Äúban the box‚Äù policy. = Montana = In October 2017, Montana signed into law House Bill 133. This bill reforms the system by reforming sentencing for a wide range of first-time misdemeanors or by eliminating incarceration time. It also got rid of mandatory minimum sentences for felony drug offenses but revised the mandatory minimum statutes for felony sex crimes. = Nebraska = Nebraska passed three bills reforming the criminal justice system. Legislative Bill 172 which was directed towards sentencing of midlevel felon charges by reducing or getting id of the mandatory minimum sentences. LB 173 was directed towards the ‚Äúthree-strikes‚Äù law by reducing the requirements to only violent crimes. Lastly, LB 483 which would reenact a rule from the 1980s. This is the \\"one-third\\" rule that forces judges to apply minimum sentences that are a third of the maximum sentence. = Nevada = Nevada has reformed the policy for voting by allowing convicted felons to vote in Assembly Bill 181. They have reformed the amount of time to file for a petition to seal conviction records in Senate Bill 125 and allowing offenders who are incarcerated to speak with their families to find a job for when they reenter society in Senate Bill 420. = New Hampshire = Most recently in New Hampshire, they have decriminalized a small amount of marijuana with House Bill 640. Senate Bill 200 reduces the likeliness that you will have served jail time for not being able to afford a fine and its fees. = New Jersey = New Jersey passed a bill reforming the treatment of offenders while they are incarcerated by only allowing offenders to be housed in solitary confinement for less than 15 consecutive days at a time. S51 also prohibits solitary confinement for those with disabilities, mental illnesses, and the LGBTQ community. If an offender is housed in solitary confinement, S51 requires they are seen by a medical professional every day for their stay. = New Mexico = The reform for New Mexico has focused mostly on making the sentencing tougher, but there has been a campaign that advocates for reform called New Mexico Safe. = New York = New York passed a 2017 Criminal Justice Reform Act only approving, so far, reforming the bail determination system, raising the age of juvenile offenders, and providing a speedy trial for all. = North Carolina = Most recent controversy about North Carolina is the passing of House Bill 142 that prevents the protection of the members in the LGBTQ community. Senate Bill 145 puts a limit on the role of the highway department patrol enforcing federal immigration laws. = North Dakota = North Dakota has passed two bills reforming the criminal justice system in different ways. One bill, House Bill 1221, reforms the confidential informant use by the police restricting juveniles to be an informant, making sure the informant has spoken with a lawyer and both parties are aware of the safety risks. The other bill, House Bill 1195, reforms the juvenile sentencing for murder. Instead of being sentenced as an adult, if they are tried as an adult, they are sentenced as a juvenile so they won't receive the sentence of life without the option of parole. = Ohio = Most recently, Ohio has passed Senate Bill 97 to increase the amount of time someone who has committed a crime with a weapon spends in prison by 50%. It also restricts offenders with a violent background and violent criminal history to buy or use a firearm. They have also passed a variation of the ‚Äúban the box‚Äù policy by requiring employers of the public to not consider the criminal background as the first thing to rule them out. = Oklahoma = Oklahoma has amended classifications for drug possession charges and property offenses to reflect as misdemeanors under State Question 780. They also approved State Question 781 to use the money funding offenders in the previous state question towards rehabilitation instead. In 2016, Oklahoma also held up the ‚Äúban the box‚Äù policy. = Oregon = Most recent efforts from Oregon is a complain, _They Report to you_ , to make the criminal justice system clearer to the average person, focus on the reason an offender commits a crime but also with a prevention and rehabilitative approach. = Pennsylvania = Reform in Pennsylvania has enacted a Senate Bill 100, Criminal Justice Reform Act that changes laws such as sending offenders who violate parole conditions to a community correction center instead of prison and to sentencing offenders of misdemeanor level offenses to prison. = Rhode Island = Rhode Island has passed a human trafficking reform this past year (2017) and a Juvenile Reinvestment package. = South Carolina = The age for criminal responsibility was increased with Senate Bill 916 to age 17. = South Dakota = South Dakota has eliminated the life without the option of parole for juveniles completely for people under 18 years old when they committed the crime with Senate Bill 140. = Tennessee = In recent years, many groups have been created to battle the task of reforming the criminal justice system. They all aim to impact the bail system, and juvenile justice. In 2017 a juvenile justice reform bill was passed that makes judges let juveniles know when they can and cannot expunge their record and lowered the age of allowing them to do that to 17. = Texas = Texas, just like Alabama, Missouri, and Georgia has reformed the voting eligibility requirements for offenders based on their cases. In Texas in 2007 they were seeking to build more prisons at a cost of 2 billion dollars. The legislature enacted criminal justice reforms and by 2010 they closed 4 prisons and are planning on closing more and the crime rate dropped. A person that has paid his or her debt to society should get \\"ALL\\" American Rights back. Depending on if he or she has led a good life after said debt has been paid in full and should not be held against him or her after 20 years of no other felony convictions. = Utah = With House Bill 405, Utah also eliminated the life without parole for juveniles under 18 for capital offenses. = Vermont = In 2016, Vermont granted House Bill 95 and got rid of the discretion for the state to charge juveniles as adults for certain and less serious offenses. = Virginia = The governor pushed executive orders that allowed about 70,000 people who have completed their sentence, parole included to vote in 2016. = Washington = Washington has reformed their sentencing structure also while restructuring their discretionary powers for those involved in the criminal justice system. In September 2017, the voting rights of people with felony convictions were reenacted allowing them to vote once their sentence is completed. Another reform Washington is working towards is bail reform. = West Virginia = Senate Bill 393 was passed in April 2015 to reform the juvenile justice system by keeping the juveniles at home instead of incarcerated. = Wisconsin = Wisconsin has also recently adopted a form the ‚Äúban the box‚Äù policy to require the employers of state jobs to hold off on asking about any criminal convictions until the end of the application process in the Wisconsin Act 150. The state has also pursued more options for those who committed low-level nonviolent crimes out of prisons and jails and more resources in the community in Assembly 657. They have also tightened the penalty process for repeat offenders of driving while intoxicated in AB 536 and Senate Bill 455. = Wyoming = One bill in 2017 aimed at fixing the criminal justice system wasn't passed in the Senate. It was aimed at reforming sentences and reforming the parole and probation violations and the conditions and resentencing. Global criminal justice reform efforts As an example, in 2016, it was reported that Britain was considering reforming its own criminal justice system in similar ways that Texas had done so in recent years. There is an organization called the United Nations Office of Drug and Crime. They advocate for criminal justice reform globally as well. They advocate for reform in the police departments, prosecutorial reform, court reform, prison reform, and mostly for restorative justice. UNODC helps countries develop plans such as legislature to pass to reform their entire criminal justice system. They also work closely with other groups mostly fixating on the global drug problem.

It was described for the first time in 2008. It is endemic to a small area in the north of the island of Gran Canaria. Description Cistus grancanariae is a shrub, usually high, densely branched, with grey-green leaves clustered towards the end of the branches. The oppositely arranged leaves are around long by wide, with three (or occasionally up to five) very obvious main veins. The upper sides of the leaves are covered with short stellate (star-shaped) hairs and long simple hairs, some glandular. The undersides of the leaves are whitish and more densely covered with hairs. The flowers are arranged in cymes, with 3‚Äì25 flowers to each inflorescence. Individual flowers are across. The petals are white, more-or-less rounded, about long and wide, with a wavy truncated apex and a short narrowed pale yellow tinged base. There are 35-70 stamens, longer than the pistil, with filaments long. The style is very short, usually less than long. Fertilized flowers produce 7‚Äì20 blackish-brown seeds up to long. Taxonomy Cistus grancanariae was first described in 2008 by √Åguedo Marrero, Rafael Almeida and Carlos R√≠os. One of the group of white-flowered species of Cistus, it was previously mistaken for Cistus monspeliensis, common in Gran Canaria. The leaves of the two species are different: C. monspeliensis has narrower leaves, more rolled under at the edges (more revolute), with upper surfaces that are green, sticky (viscous), and without stellate hairs. Distribution and habitat Cistus grancanariae is only found in a small region in the north of the island of Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands, at elevations of , where it can form quite extensive stands. There are two main populations (Cabo Verde‚ÄìLos Toscales and the Monta√±a de Gu√≠a) and three that are more fragmented. Plants are found in areas affected by human activity, such as deforestation, cultivation and grazing. The region is influenced by moist Atlantic winds, and has a Mediterranean-type climate, generally somewhat arid or with only seasonal rainfall, totalling a year. Conservation Cistus grancanariae grows only in a limited area. Two of its locations are within protected areas, but these contain few individuals. Most of its range is unprotected and subject to human disturbance. In view of these factors, Marrero et al. consider that the species is eligible for vulnerable (VU) status under the IUCN Red List criteria.

The events took place on May 15 and 16, 2015, at the Ted Reeve Arena in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with the first night airing live on internet pay-per-view (iPPV) and the second on tape delay as part of the weekly Ring of Honor Wrestling program. Global Wars '15 was the second annual Global Wars event co-produced by ROH and NJPW, following Global Wars, which took place on May 10, 2014, also at the Ted Reeve Arena. Production =Background= On January 4, 2015, at their Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome show, New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) announced that it would for the second year in a row co-produce an event with Ring of Honor (ROH) in May. At that point, no specific dates were announced and only the United States was named as a location. However, on February 25, ROH sent out a press release, announcing three co-produced events, as opposed to two shows in 2014, with War of the Worlds '15 taking place on May 13 in Philadelphia and Global Wars '15 on May 15 and 16 in Toronto, Canada. On March 7, War of the Worlds '15 was also expanded to a two-day event, taking place over May 12 and 13. ROH began announcing the NJPW wrestlers taking part in the events on April 1, starting with Hiroshi Tanahashi. Over the next nine days, ROH announced the remaining NJPW participants; Kazuchika Okada, Jyushin Thunder Liger, Tetsuya Naito, Takaaki Watanabe, Kushida, Gedo, and finally Shinsuke Nakamura. On April 16, ROH announced that the Bullet Club quintet of A.J. Styles, Doc Gallows, Karl Anderson, Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson would also be taking part in the Global Wars '15 events. On April 22, ROH announced all nine matches for the first night of Global Wars '15. The following day, ROH announced seven matches for the second night. An eighth match for the second night was announced on May 6. Also announced were pre-show autograph sessions for May 15 and 16, which would be attended by both NJPW and ROH wrestlers taking part in the tour. =Storylines= The two Global Wars '15 events featured nine and fourteen professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Due to featuring wrestlers from two different promotions, the events focused less on storyline rivalries and more on interpromotional matchups, including the only title match of the two events, which saw ROH's Jay Lethal defend the ROH World Television Championship against NJPW's Tetsuya Naito on the first night. The first night was scheduled to feature a match between ROH's Chris Sabin and NJPW's Kushida, who are connected through their partnerships with Alex Shelley; Sabin was previously one half of The Motor City Machine Guns with Shelley, who now teamed with Kushida as the Time Splitters. On the day of the show, Kyle O'Reilly was added to the match, when his reDRagon tag team partner Bobby Fish, whom he was supposed to team with in a four-way tag team match, could not make the event due to travel issues. The first night also featured another interpromotional match between Cedric Alexander and Kazuchika Okada, which was originally announced for the previous year's War of the Worlds, but was canceled after Alexander was removed from the show with a storyline injury. The Bullet Club stable main evented both nights, facing a team of ROH's top wrestlers in a ten-man tag team match on the first night and the NJPW stable Chaos in a six-man tag team match on the second night. The main event of the second night also builds to a future IWGP Heavyweight Championship match between A.J. Styles and Kazuchika Okada. Reception In his review of the first night, Pro Wrestling Dot Net's Zack Zimmerman wrote that in his mind the show \\"definitely delivered\\", but while there were no disappointing matches on the show, nothing reached the caliber of War of the Worlds '15's top matches. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter called the show very good and stated that it was worth ordering just for the main event, which he called \\"ridiculous\\". He later awarded it four and a half stars out of five. However, in what he stated was a testament to the quality of the four shows, Meltzer also called the first night the weakest of the shows. In wrapping up the week, Meltzer dubbed Roderick Strong the ROH MVP of the four shows, writing that both Hiroshi Tanahashi and Shinsuke Nakamura were giving him rave reviews. Pro Wrestling Torch's Mike Metzger called the undercard of the first show \\"solid\\", stating that it did not overshadow the main event, which he awarded four and a quarter stars out of five. Aftermath Matches from the second night started airing on Ring of Honor Wrestling on May 30. On August 21, 2015, NJPW and ROH declared that the relationship between the two promotions was stronger than ever, announcing two ROH shows in Tokyo in February 2016 and another NJPW tour of North America for May 2016, featuring new locations and wrestlers.

This principle can be used also for non-contact infrared non-destructive testing (IRNDT) of materials. The IRNDTActive thermography laboratory, University of West Bohemia, New Technologies - Research Centre, department Thermomechanics of Technological Processes method is based on an excitation of a tested material by an external source, which brings some energy to the material. Halogen lamps, flash-lamps, ultrasonic horn or other sources can be used as the excitation source for the IRNDT. The excitation causes a tested material thermal response, which is measured by an infrared camera. It is possible to obtain information about the tested material surface and sub-surface defects or material inhomogeneities by using a suitable combination of excitation source, excitation procedure, infrared camera and evaluation method. Modern thermographic systems with high-speed and high-sensitivity IR cameras extend the possibilities of the inspection method. Modularity of the systems allows their usage for research and development applications as well as in modern industrial production lines. Thermovision nondestructive testing of components can be carried out on a wide range of various materials. Thermographic inspection of material can be regarded as a method of infrared defectoscopy, that is capable of revealing material imperfections such as cracks, defects, voids, cavities and other inhomogeneities. The thermographic testing can be provided on individual components in a laboratory or directly on technology facilities that are in duty.  Introduction to infrared thermography  Infrared (IR) thermographyLaboratory of thermal fields measurement, University of West Bohemia, New Technologies - Research Centre, department Thermomechanics of Technological Processes is an analysis technique based on the detection of radiation in the IR part of the electromagnetic spectrum. According to the black body radiation law, all objects with temperature greater than absolute zero emit IR radiation. The device detecting and composing a 2D image of the IR radiation is generally called an IR camera or a thermographic camera, also referred to as an infrared camera. The result of the thermographic recording is an image or a sequence, which corresponds to the intensity of the thermal radiation of the recorded object. The recording is called a thermogram. The intensity of the thermal radiation of the object is directly connected with the object temperature. The thermogram is therefore an image of the object surface temperature distribution. IR thermography is in the most cases used for non-contact measurement of spatial and time distribution of temperature fields. Scheme of the principles and factors influencing a thermographic measurement. = Properties = IR thermography has a number of advantages ‚Äì it is non-contact measurement, it captures an area (similarly to the classical video camera in visible spectrum) or it can measure moving or rotating objects, even if the objects have a very high temperature. However, the IR radiation intensity detected by the infrared camera does not depend solely on the measured object temperature. The main drawback of IR thermography is the fact that the result is influenced by a number of factors such as the thermo- optical properties of the object (emissivity, transmissivity, reflectivity),Laboratory of optical properties measurement, University of West Bohemia, New Technologies - Research Centre, department Thermomechanics of Technological Processes ambient temperature, environment properties, etc. Especially the knowledge of the measured object optical properties are fundamental for an accurate temperature measurement. Determination of these properties is often a complicated task and it requires both experience and the appropriate equipment. = Classification = Thermography can be classified as qualitative or quantitative, and passive or active. Qualitative thermography usually does not require an accurate temperature measurement. It only evaluates temperature differences between particular components, between different spots on the same object or between the measured object and the background. Qualitative thermography has many important applications, for example a thermal leaks diagnostics, thermal components diagnostics, searching for persons or in medicine. In contrast, the goal of quantitative thermography is an accurate temperature measurement of inspected objects. Knowledge of thermo-optical properties of the measured objects is essential in this case. Moreover, the thermo-optical properties often depend on temperature and it is also necessary to take into account an influence of environment. Important applications of quantitative thermography include temperature monitoring during thermal processing or determination of thermal boundary conditions for numerical simulations of thermal processes. Both the qualitative and quantitative approaches can be applied in terms of passive or active thermography. If the object temperature is not artificially affected during its measuring, it is called the passive thermography. If an artificial excitation using an external source is applied on the measured object, it is called active thermography. The external excitation causes temperature contrasts associated with material inhomogeneities or defects occurrence or it can be used for material properties identification. The active thermography is the important technique used for finding defects in materials, so called infrared non-destructive testing (IRNDT). Active thermography can be also applied for material thermal properties determination.  Infrared non- destructive testing (IRNDT)  = Active thermography = Scheme of the active thermography principle. Active thermography uses an external source for measured object excitation, that means introducing an energy into the object. The excitation sources can be classified by the principles: * optical radiation or microwaves absorption, * electromagnetic induction, * elastic waves transformation (e.g. ultrasound), * convection (e.g. hot air), * plastic deformation transformation (thermoplastic effect during mechanical loading). Various excitation sources can be used for the active thermography and nondestructive testing, for example laser heating, flash lamps, halogen lamps, electrical heating, ultrasonic horn, eddy currents, microwaves, and others. The measured object can be heated by an external source directly, e.g. by halogen lamps or hot air. The material inhomogeneities or defects cause then a distortion of temperature field. This distortion is detected as temperature differences on the material surface. Another possibility is to use thermophysical processes in the material, when mechanical or electrical energy is transformed into thermal energy due to defects and inhomogeneities. It creates local temperature sources, which cause temperature differences detected on the object surface by infrared techniques. It is the case of ultrasound excitation for example. = IRNDT methods = A lot of methods were developed for active thermography for the nondestructive testing measurement evaluation. The evaluation methods selection depends on application, used excitation source and excitation type (pulse, periodic, continuous). In the simplest case, the response is evident from a thermogram directly. However, it is necessary to use advanced analysis techniques in most cases. The most common methods include Lock-In, Pulse or Transient (Step thermography) evaluation techniques. Continuous excitation can also be used in some cases. * Lock-In thermography (periodic excitation method). A modulated periodic source is used for the excitation. The phase and amplitude shift of the measured signal are evaluated and the analysis can be done by various techniques. Halogen lamps, LED lamps, ultrasound excitation or an electric current are suitable excitation sources. It has the advantage that it can be used on large surfaces and it puts a low thermal energy on the part being inspected. The disadvantage is a longer measurement time and dependence of detection capabilities on a geometrical orientation of defects (except of an indirect excitation such as ultrasound). The Lock-In method is suitable for testing components with a low thermal diffusivity and it has many modifications for various specific applications (such as Lock-In Ref, Lock-In Online, etc.). * Pulse thermography (pulse method). A very short pulse ‚Äì usually in the units of milliseconds ‚Äì is used to excite the object. The cooling process is then analyzed. A flash lamp is typically used as an excitation source. The advantage of this method is the speed of the analysis and a possibility to estimate the defects depth. The disadvantage is a limited depth of the analysis, a limited area that can be inspected (with regard to a usable power of excitation sources) and a dependence of detection capabilities on geometrical orientation of defects. * Transient thermography (step thermography, thermal wave method). In principle, the excitation and evaluation are similar to the pulse thermography, however, the pulse length is much bigger. Less powerful excitation sources are required compared to the pulse thermography. It is therefore possible to analyze larger areas and the measurement time is shorter than in the case of Lock-In thermography. As in the pulse thermography, the sensitivity of the method is limited by the geometrical orientation of defects. Halogen lamps are the suitable excitation source for this type of evaluation. * Continual excitation. The simplest method usable only in special applications. A high-speed cooled infrared camera with a high sensitivity is commonly used for IRNDT applications. However, an uncooled bolometric infrared camera can be used for specific applications. It can significantly reduce acquisition costs of the measurement system. The IR nondestructive testing system are usually modular. It means that various excitation sources can be combined with various infrared cameras and various evaluation methods depending on application, tested material, measuring time demands, size of a tested area, etc. The modularity allows universal usage of the system for various industrial, scientific and research applications.  Application examples  IRNDT (infra-red nondestructive testing) method is suitable for detection and inspection of cracks, defects, cavities, voids and inhomogeneities in material, it is also possible to use the method for inspection of welded joints of metal and plastic parts, inspection of solar cells and solar panels, determination of internal structure of material etc. The main advantage of IRNDT method is availability for inspection of various materials in wide range of industrial and research applications. IRNDT measurement is fast, nondestructive and noncontact. Restrictive condition for IRNDT method is inspection depth combined with dimension and orientation of defect/crack/inhomogeneity in material. = Pulse IRNDT analysis of a demonstration sample = Demonstration of tested specimen and IRNDT analysis results. The demonstration and calibration sample is made of carbon fiber-epoxy composite. There are six holes of different depths on one side to simulate defects at different depths in range from 1 to 4 mm under the surface. The IRNDT analysis is performed from the flat side. The results from the flash-pulse analysis show that the holes appear in different time frames of the evaluation ‚Äì according to their depth. So the flash-pulse analysis does not only detect the presence of defects but also determine their depth under the surface if a thermal diffusivity of the sample is known. = Inspection of laser welded plastic parts = IRNDT analysis of laser welded plastic part with a defective weld and with a correct weld. Laser welding of plastics is a progressive technology of connecting materials with different optical properties. Classical methods for testing of welding performance and weld joints quality ‚Äì such as the metallographic cut microscopic analysis or X-ray tomography ‚Äì are not suitable for routine measurements. Pulse IRNDT analysis can be successfully used for weld inspection in many cases. The images show an example of plastic parts inspection with a defective weld and with a correct weld. The gaps in the defective weld and the correct uninterrupted weld line are both well visible in the results of the IRNDT flash-pulse analysis. = Inspection of laser welded joints = IRNDT evaluation with an indication of weld imperfections and a correct weld of lap joint. Laser beam welding is a modern technology of fusion welding. Currently finds its wide usage not only in the field of scientific research but also establishes itself in a variety of industries. Among the most frequent users belong the automotive industry, which due to its stable continuous innovation enables fast implementation of advanced technologies in their production. It is clear that laser welding significantly enhances engineering designs and thus brings a number of new products which previously could not be made by conventional methods. The laser welding can produce quality welds of different types, both extremely thin and thick blanks. Weldable are common carbon steels, stainless steels, aluminum and its alloys, copper, titanium and last but not least, special materials and its combinations. An integral part of the weldments production is a quality control. Unlike conventional non-destructive test methods, IRNDT is used not only after the laser welding process, but also during it. This makes possible to decide whether or not to the weldment comply with established quality criteria during manufacture process.

The outer two sepals of C. h. subsp. heterophyllus average about long by wide, whereas those of C. h. subsp. carthaginensis are smaller, averaging about long by wide. The petals of C. h. subsp. heterophyllus are about long by wide, making the flower diameter typically . Although there is considerable variation and the size ranges overlap, the petals of C. h. subsp. carthaginensis may be as small as long and wide, making the flower diameter typically . Taxonomy and phylogeny Sweet's Cystineae; probably subsp. heterophyllus as said to be \\"from Algeria\\" Cistus heterophyllus was first described by Ren√© Louiche Desfontaines in 1798. The specific epithet heterophyllus means \\"with leaves of different shapes\\", the upper being unstalked, the lower shortly stalked. Two subspecies are accepted: * Cistus heterophyllus subsp. carthaginensis (Pau) M.B.Crespo & Mateo ‚Äì mainland Spain * Cistus heterophyllus subsp. heterophyllus ‚Äì north Africa The two subspecies have been artificially crossed forming a hybrid subspecies called C. h. nothosubsp. marzoi. A 2011 molecular phylogenetic study placed C. heterophyllus in the purple and pink flowered clade (PPC) of Cistus species, in a subclade with C. albidus and C. creticus. Distribution Cistus heterophyllus has a disjoint distribution. C. h. subsp. heterophyllus is native to western North Africa, along the coastal Mediterranean region from the Spanish island of Pe√±√≥n de Alhucemas and Targuist in Morocco to Algiers. C. h. subsp. carthaginensis is found only in two locations in mainland Spain: near La Pobla de Vallbona in Valencia and in the Calblanque Regional Park in Murcia. Conservation Cistus heterophyllus subsp. carthaginensis is listed as critically endangered (CR) in the IUCN Red List. Fewer than 30 individuals were known in 2011 (only one at the Valencian site) and some appear to be hybrids with Cistus albidus. The subspecies is threatened by fires and human disturbance. Seeds have been stored in seedbanks, and attempts are being made to increase plants in cultivation, both from seed and in vitro.

It is endemic to Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands. First described as a species in 2004, it was previously identified as Cistus symphytifolius, which it resembles. Description Cistus horrens generally resembles the more widespread Cistus symphytifolius. Differences include young branches covered with simple hairs; leaf blades grayer and shorter, densely covered with simple, glandular and stellate hairs on the upper surface and with longer simple hairs on the lower surface, with glandular hairs only on the nerves; sepals densely covered with simple hairs; and smaller fruiting capsules with fewer seeds. The leaves are elliptical to lanceolate, stalked (petiolate) and have netted (reticulate) veins. The stigmas are longer than the stamens. Taxonomy and phylogeny Cistus horrens was first described as a new species by Jean-Pierre Demoly in 2004; it had previously been treated as C. symphytifolius. The specific epithet horrens is Latin for \\"standing erect, bristling\\". A 2011 molecular phylogenetic study placed C. horrens as a member of the purple and pink flowered clade (PPC) of Cistus species, along with some other Canary Island endemics (Cistus asper, Cistus chinamadensis, Cistus ocreatus, and Cistus symphytifolius). Distribution and habitat Cistus horrens is endemic to Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands, being found in the south-west sector of the island. It is typically found at elevations of in pine forests, in semiarid conditions.
